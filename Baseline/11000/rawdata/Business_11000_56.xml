      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4560">An '''active ingredient''' ('''AI''') is the [[ingredient]] in a [[pharmaceutical drug]] or [[Pesticide|pesticide]] that is [[biological activity|biologically active]]. The similar terms '''active pharmaceutical ingredient''' ('''API''') and '''bulk active''' are also used in medicine, and the term '''active substance''' may be used for natural products.  Some medication products may contain more than one active ingredient.  The traditional word for the API is '''pharmacon''' or '''pharmakon''' (from {{lang-el|φάρμακον}}, adapted from [[pharmacos]]) which originally denoted a magical substance or drug. 

The terms '''active constituent''' or '''active principle''' are often chosen when referring to the active [[chemical substance|substance]] of interest in a plant (such as [[salicylic acid]] in [[willow]] bark or [[arecoline]] in [[areca nut]]s), because the word ''ingredient'' in many minds [[connotation|connotes]] a sense of human agency (that is, something that a person combines with other substances), whereas the [[natural product]]s present in plants were not added by any human agency but rather occurred naturally ("a plant doesn't have ingredients"). 

In contrast with the active ingredients, the inactive ingredients are usually called [[excipient]]s in pharmaceutical contexts. The main excipient that serves as a medium for conveying the active ingredient is usually called the [[wikt:vehicle#Noun|vehicle]]. [[Petroleum jelly|Petrolatum]] and [[mineral oil]] are common vehicles.

== Pharmaceuticals ==

The [[dosage form]] for a pharmaceutical contains the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), which is the drug itself, and [[excipient]]s, which are the substances of the tablet, or the liquid the API is suspended in, or other material that is pharmaceutically [[Inert ingredient|inert]]. Drugs are chosen primarily for their active ingredients. 

Patients often have difficulty identifying the active ingredients in their medication, and are often unaware of the notion of an active ingredient. When patients are on multiple medications, active ingredients can interfere with each other, often resulting in severe or life-threatening complications.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite web| author=Lee, Dennis | author2=Marks, Jay M. (ed.) | url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=18972 | deadurl=no&lt;!--present in Internet Archive--&gt; | website=[[MedicineNet]] | title=Drug Interactions: Know the Ingredients, Consult Your Physician | date=April 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There now exist online services which can identify the active ingredient of most medications, such as the Medicines database providing information on medications available in Australia.&lt;ref name=finder&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nps.org.au/medicines | deadurl=no&lt;!--present in Internet Archive--&gt; | title=Medicines | publisher=[[NPS MedicineWise]] | date=October 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Herbal medicine ==

In phytopharmaceutical or [[herbal medicine]], the active ingredient may be either unknown or may require [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] in order to achieve therapeutic goals. This leads to complications in labelling. One way manufacturers have attempted to indicate strength is to engage in [[standardization]] to a [[Biomarker|marker]] compound.  However, standardization has not been achieved yet: different companies use different markers, or different levels of the same markers, or different methods of testing for marker compounds.   For instance, [[Hypericum perforatum|St John's wort]] is often standardized to the [[hypericin]] which is now known not to be the "active ingredient" for antidepressant use.  Other companies standardize to [[hyperforin]] or both, although there may be some 24 known possible active constituents. Many herbalists believe that the active ingredient in a plant is the plant itself.&lt;ref&gt;1992, ''American Herbalism'' edited by [[Michael Tierra]] Crossings Press&lt;/ref&gt;

'''André Borschberg''' [[Royal Scottish Geographical Society|FRSGS]] (born December 13, 1952) is a Swiss entrepreneur, explorer, pilot and speaker. He is the co-founder of the [[Solar Impulse project]], the first ever round-the-world solar flight, successfully completed in July 2016. During the Japan-to-Hawaii leg, André broke the world record for longest solo flight in an airplane of any kind: 117 hours and 52 minutes, breaking [[Steve Fossett]]'s 2006 record. Before that, on 7 July 2010, André completed the first 24-hour solar powered flight. The flight set records for the longest manned [[Solar power|solar-powered]] flight and the greatest height reached by a manned [[Electric aircraft|solar aircraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/09/world/europe/09plane.html|accessdate=8 July 2010|work=The New York Times|author=Alan Cowell|title=Solar-Powered Plane Flies for 26 Hours | date=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He currently holds 14 [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|FAI]] world records in: free distance, free distance along a course, straight distance, straight distance predeclared waypoints, distance along a course, duration, absolute altitude, gain of height.
His groundbreaking record: the longest solo flight in an airplane of any kind: 117 hours and 52 minutes.

Borschberg flew as a jet pilot in the [[Swiss Air Force]] prior to his work with Solar Impulse. An engineer by education and a graduate of the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]], André Borschberg has solid experience in creating and managing companies. His passion for aviation and his interest in innovative solutions have led him to team up with [[Bertrand Piccard]] as CEO, co-founder and pilot of Solar Impulse.

For his role in delivering and piloting Solar Impulse, André was awarded the prestigious Mungo Park Medal by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society in 2018. This was awarded jointly with [[Bertrand Piccard]].

==Pilot career==
Fascinated by aviation from his earliest youth, André Borschberg trained as a pilot in the [[Swiss air force]], flying first [[De Havilland Venom|Venoms]] and then [[Hawker Hunter|Hunters]] and [[Northrop F-5E Tiger II|Tigers]] for over 20 years. Today he holds both professional aeroplane and helicopter pilots' licences and also does aerobatics in his spare time.

==Engineer and management career==
After graduating from the [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]] (EPFL) in mechanics and thermodynamics, André Borschberg has constantly developed and led numerous technology projects, companies and start-ups, as both investor and entrepreneur. He very quickly supplemented his training with a Master's in Management Science from the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]], preceded by certificates in financial management and business management at HEC Lausanne. He first joined McKinsey, one of the world's leading business consultancies, as a consultant for five years, before starting his own entrepreneurial activities.

His strong points are business organisation, management and development. From finance to marketing, from engineering to human resources, André Borschberg has acquired solid experience as an entrepreneur, manager and consultant for over 20 years. He went initially into partnership with a venture capital company, Lowe Finance. His vast range of professional skills, his versatility and his perseverance enabled him to successfully launch two start-ups in the Internet and new technologies field. With a technical team from EPFL, he co-founded Innovative Silicon, a technology company in the field of microprocessor memories.

André Borschberg and Bertrand Piccard released in 2017 ''Objectif Soleil'', a book about how they lived through [[Solar Impulse]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/magazine/grand-angle/le-parisien-magazine-les-coulisses-de-l-exploit-17-02-2017-6684036.php|title=Solar Impulse, les coulisses de l’exploit|website=Le Parisien|date=16 February 2017|accessdate=8 June 2017}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/environnement/solar-impulse-1000-solutions-pour-un-monde-durable_1879438.html|title=Solar Impulse: "1000 solutions pour un monde durable"|author=Interview by Isabelle Hennebelle|website=lexpress.fr|date=17 February 2017|accessdate=8 June 2017}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Management===
At the head of the project Solar Impulse with Bertrand Piccard, André Borschberg brings the essential skills of an entrepreneur who contributes to convert vision into reality. As the CEO, he has put together and motivated a team of 65 top specialists and numerous partners, all from very diverse horizons and origins. "This diversity we have sought at every level stimulates their creativity and gives them their strength. It is from this pooling of experiences that original and totally-new solutions arise.”

===Engineering===
As a mechanical engineer and pilot, he is directing the construction of the aircraft and the preparation of the flight missions. "We need to find a way to build an aircraft that is super-robust &amp; super-light at the same time, and above all extremely efficient with energy consumption, so as to need only minuscule amounts of energy in order to fly. But with the same degree of resistance as a normal airplane. Hence the great complexity of the project, which gives the true measure of its philosophy and its objectives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/?/video/tech/2011/11/29/solar-impulse-aircraft.cnn|accessdate=29 November 2011|work=CNN|author=CNN|title=Can solar power fuel future flight| date=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Solar Impulse 1'' missions===
* ''Solar Night Flight'':

On 7 July 2010, André Borschberg has, for the first time in history, flown 26 hours with the Solar Impulse aeroplane, demonstrating at the same time the possibilities to fly day and night with only solar energy to propel the aeroplane.

* ''European Solar Flights'':

Solar Impulse HB-SIA, piloted by André Borschberg, completed three international flights during the European campaign: Payerne to Brussels on 13 May (630&amp;nbsp;km), Brussels to Paris-Le Bourget on 14 June (395&amp;nbsp;km) and Paris-Le Bourget to Payerne on 3 July (426&amp;nbsp;km).

* ''Crossing frontiers'':

Solar Impulse, piloted alternately by André Borschberg and Bertrand Piccard, made its first intercontinental flight in 2012 from Switzerland (Payerne) to Toulouse, and then on to Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;"Bertrand Piccard; Explorer, c'est aller au delà des évidences", ''L'Express'', 1 August 2012, pp. 6–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Across America'':

Solar Impulse has completed the historic crossing of the United States over a 2-month period of the summer of 2013. Bertrand Piccard and André Borschberg, the two pilots, flew from San Francisco to New York, stopping over in cities along the way.

With the goal of the [[Solar Impulse#Circumnavigation flight .282015.29|world's first solar powered round the world flight]] initiated on March 9, 2015, these flights have provided good learning opportunities in terms of slotting the solar aircraft into international air space and landing at international airports.

===''Solar Impulse 2'' missions===

Taking turns at the controls of the airplane with his partner Bertrand Piccard for the first ever round-the-world solar flight, successfully achieved in July 2016.

===FAI world records===
André Borschberg achieved 8 [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|FAI]] world records flying with ''Solar Impulse 1''. During three historical flights (2010 night flight, 2012 Payerne to Madrid and 2013 Phoenix to Dallas), he was awarded 8 FAI World records: free distance, free distance along a course, straight distance, straight distance predeclared waypoints, distance along a course, duration, absolute altitude, gain of height.

With the ''Solar Impulse 2'', he broke the record of the longest solo flight, previously held by [[Steve Fosset]]. On 3 July 2015, Borschberg flew the solar powered airplane between [[Nagoya]] (Japan) and [[Kalaeloa, Hawaii]] (US) for a duration of 4 days, 21 hours and 52 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Howard, [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/03/solar-impulse-lands-in-hawaii-after-longest-non-stop-solo-flight-in-history "Solar Impulse lands in Hawaii after longest non-stop solo flight in history "], ''[[The Guardian]]'', Friday 3 July 2015 (page visited on 5 July 2015); FAI, [http://www.fai.org/records/news-of-records/39587-he-made-it-borscherg-flies-solar-impulse-across-the-pacific-ocean] (page visited on Wednesday 8 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Deira Skyline on 8 May 2007.jpg|thumb|250px|The Bur Dubai [[Dubai Creek|creek]] area, facing [[Deira, Dubai|Deira]].]]
'''Bur Dubai''' (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: بر دبي ) is a historic district in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]], located on the western side of the [[Dubai Creek]]. The name literally translates to ''Mainland Dubai'', a reference to the traditional separation of the Bur Dubai area from [[Deira, Dubai|Deira]] by the Dubai Creek. This is because Bur Dubai historically consisted of all districts between the western bank of the Creek and [[Jumeirah]]. The Ruler's Court is located in the district adjacent to the Grand Mosque.

The district is home to several [[mosques]] including the [[Grand Mosque (Dubai)|Grand Mosque]] with the city's tallest [[minaret]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dubaicity.com/Attractions/..%5CAttractions%5Cgrand-mosque.htm DubaiCity.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216073338/http://www.dubaicity.com/Attractions/..%5CAttractions%5Cgrand-mosque.htm |date=December 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the blue tiled [[Iranian Mosque, Bur Dubai|Iranian Mosque]]. The [[Hindu Temple, Dubai|country's only Hindu temple]] is situated between the Grand Mosque and the Creek.

It is home to several popular places for tourists including renovated historic buildings and museums. The district has many shopping streets and [[souqs]] (or souk), including the textile souq near the [[Abra (boat)|abra]] boat station, though most of the well known souqs are located in Deira.

==Historic area==
{{main|Al Bastakiya}}

'''Charles Mathew Gray''' (1853 – 11 June 1918) was a New Zealand [[Independent politician|Independent]] [[New Zealand Parliament|Member of Parliament]] for [[Christchurch North (New Zealand electorate)|Christchurch North]], and [[Mayor of Christchurch]].

==Early life==
Charles Gray was born in [[Geelong]], Victoria, in Australia and came to New Zealand in 1862.

The two candidates were the incumbent, [[Samuel Manning]], and Gray, who received 492 and 665 votes, respectively. Gray was thus elected as the 17th mayor of Christchurch.&lt;ref name="1890 mayoral elections"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=TS18901127.2.54 | title=The Mayoral Elections | work=[[The Star (Christchurch)|The Star]] | date=27 November 1890 | accessdate=28 April 2010 | issue=7021}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was mayor until 1892. On 18 April 1904, he succeeded [[Henry Wigram]] as mayor, when he was declared elected unopposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Election of Mayor |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=CHP19040419.2.70.1 |accessdate=10 May 2016 |work=[[The Press]] |volume=LXI |issue=11871 |date=19 April 1904 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served for one year, and his chief aims were beautifying the city, drainage, sanitation, lighting and high pressure water supply.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4587">The [[theory]] of '''collective capitalism''' was advanced by American [[economist]] G. Means in the 1960s. It was intended to overcome the failings of traditional [[capitalism]], using the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s as an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Problems and Prospects of Collective Capitalism|jstor=4223994}}&lt;/ref&gt; It rejects the principles advanced by [[Adam Smith]], who created the notion of the "[[invisible hand]]" of 'self-correcting' [[Market (economics)|market forces]]. The theory expresses the capitalist socialization of production, but only in a distorted manner. For example, Japan's collective capitalism relies on cooperation, but ignores the fact that the means of production  are private. It cannot be considered socialist because the means of production belongs to corporations.

==Collective capitalist theory==
The essence of the theory of collective capitalism is expressed by Means in the following proposition:

“We now have single corporate enterprises employing hundreds of thousands of workers, having hundreds of thousands of stockholders, using billions of dollars’ worth of the instruments of production, serving millions of customers, and controlled by a single management group. These are great collectives of enterprises, and a system composed of them or dominated by them might well be called ’collective capitalism’”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collective Capitalism, Theory of|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Collective+Capitalism,+Theory+of|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=IAIuAAAAMAAJ}}|title=The Corporate Revolution in America: Economic Reality Vs. Economic Theory|last=Means|first=Gardiner Coit|publisher=Crowell-Collier Press|year=1962|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collective capitalism places an emphasis on cooperative long-term relationships, resulting in an [[economy]] directed by "relational markets". An example of this is interlocking share ownership, in which [[Company|companies]] own shares in other companies; this results in a spirit of cooperation between the involved companies, since each has an interest in the other's performance. An important example of this is the [[Economy of Japan|Japanese economy]], in which 40% of the shares traded on the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]] are owned by the collection of industrial groups known as the ''Kigyo Shudan'', and a further 30% is owned by the network of cross-shareholdings known as the ''[[keiretsu]]''. This results in stable ownership, lessening the potential for [[hostile takeover]]s and also "friendly" competition; companies are encouraged to excel but for the benefit of others as well as themselves.

==History==
Japan is the only example of collective capitalism in practical form. It stems from Japan's economic and social restructuring following [[World War II|World War Two]]. This program of industrial development was successful until the 1990s. Japan has the world's third-largest economy by [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP) and the second largest by [[Market (economics)|market]] [[exchange rates]].

Collective capitalism's influence can be seen elsewhere in modern Japan. Workers, particularly those who work for large businesses, become involved in their firms in ways unlike other capitalist systems. In return for loyalty and hard work, workers traditionally expect more from their employers than their western counterparts, including job security - often for life - [[pensions]] and social protection. This system of collective cooperation and the domination of the worker in corporate policy led to the Japanese system being dubbed "peoplism" by some critics.&lt;ref name="peoplism"&gt;[http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=011005C TCS Daily article "Japan's Economic Comeback?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310223450/http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=011005C |date=2007-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Many critics voiced concerns that while collective capitalism often provides benefits for workers, it also placed a high demand on them and their families. Long hours and high levels of discipline are commonplace, resulting in high levels of [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] and the emergence of ''[[karōshi]],'' or "death by overwork," within the Japanese workforce.

The '''Critics Adult Film Association''' (CAFA) was a [[New York City|New York]]-based group of [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] adult sex [[Film criticism|film critics]], which bestowed [[award]]s upon those working in [[pornographic film]] during the 1980s. The awards were first presented in 1981, honoring the movies of the previous year. ''Talk Dirty to Me,'' a sex [[comedy film|comedy]] starring [[John Leslie (pornographic actor)|John Leslie]], who won Best Actor, was voted best film of 1980. [[Samantha Fox (actress)|Samantha Fox]] was the first Best Actress, winning for her role in ''This Lady Is A Tramp,'' another sex comedy.

''[[Amanda By Night]]'', an adult [[Crime film|crime-drama]] and ''Roommates'', also a drama, would become CAFA's most-honored movies, with the latter being presented with seven awards in 1983, including Best Director ([[Chuck Vincent (director)|Chuck Vincent]]) and Best [[Actress]] ([[Veronica Hart]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Film Journal'' Volume 87, Pubsun Corp., 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Amanda By Night'' scooped six awards the previous year in a ceremony "held at the famed [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]]":&lt;ref name="stagerotic8208"&gt;"1981 Adult Film Critics Awards", ''Porn Stars: The Stag Erotic Series'' Vol. 3 No. 4, July/August 1982, pp. 6–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Best Film, Best Actress (Hart), Best [[Supporting actor|Supporting Actress]] ([[Lisa De Leeuw]]), Best Director ([[Gary Graver|Robert McCallum]]), Best [[Screenplay]] and Best Editing.

The CAFA and [[Adult Film Association of America]] awards were considered the major adult film awards of the [[Golden Age of Porn]]. By 1985, sex news magazine ''Cheri'' declared: "Held at the Silver Lining, a snazzy little [[bistro]] on the [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]]'s Restaurant Row, the fifth-annual Critics Adult Film Awards was a gentle reminder that porn films can be measured against standards other than the [[Penile plethysmograph|Peter Meter]]."&lt;ref name="cheri1085"&gt;"CAFA Capers: The N.Y. Critics Salute Porndom's Finest", ''Cheri Magazine'', October 1985, pp. 24-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The seventh CAFA Awards were presented May 27, 1987 in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name="cinemablue8711"&gt;Will H. Jarvis, "The 7th Annual CAFA Awards: The X-rated stars cum out at night!", ''Cinema Blue'' magazine, Vol. 4, No. 8, November 1987, pp. 6-9.&lt;/ref&gt; The association seems to have faded away after that, as did the New York-based adult film industry, overtaken by the [[X-Rated Critics Organization]] and its [[XRCO Award|Heart-On Awards]], which had first been presented two years earlier and which were based in California, the new centre of porn production.

In 1986 all three awards programs chose the same Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actress.&lt;ref name="stag1286"&gt;Bill Bottiggi, "The 10th Annual Erotica Awards", ''Stag'' magazine, December 1986, pp. 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

== CAFA Awards ==
The [[Trophy|trophies]] were called the Critics Adult Film Award and each was inscribed with the year the award was being given for, on a gold-plated round icon with decorative edges on a wooden base.&lt;ref name="spelvin-cafa"&gt;Photo [http://voices.yahoo.com/image/592220/index.html?cat=49 (enlarged)] accompanying [http://voices.yahoo.com/an-interview-porn-star-icon-georgina-3431958.html?cat=49 "An Interview with Porn Star Icon Georgina Spelvin"] by Charles Shea LeMone, June 8, 2009. Retrieved 2012-05-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, ''Cinema Blue'' magazine described the voting as a two-stage process: "CAFA President Jack Shugg and officers Steffani Martin, Colette Connor and Will H. Jarvis, aided and abetted by the members of CAFA...mail out two ballots to the New York porn critics. On the first ballot, the critics make five choices for best movies and performers in each category. (This year, any film or video released between January 1, 1986 and February 28, 1987 was eligible.) The ballots are then mailed back and the officers and their assistants count them. The choices with the most votes are then listed on a second ballot and again mailed to the critics who make one final choice in each category. These votes are once again tabulated and the movie or performer in each category with the most votes becomes the winner."&lt;ref name="cinemablue8711" /&gt;

Winners are listed below by the year in which the awards presentation was held, not by year the award was for, which was the previous year.

=== Other Categories ===
Like the [[Academy Awards]], CAFA also honored the best in various production categories. For example, at the awards show held in 1985, ''Every Woman Has a Fantasy'' scooped up [[cinematography]] and music awards, ''Raw Talent'' polished off top honors for editing prowess and Sandy Amsterdam's production design and ''Talk DIrty to Me III'' netted make-up and costuming kudos for [[Traci Lords]]' mermaid tail.&lt;ref name="cheri1085" /&gt;

However, unlike the Academy Awards, CAFA also presented awards in categories specific to the pornographic movie industry, such as Best Group Scene, bestowed in 1987 to ''[[The Devil in Miss Jones#The Devil in Miss Jones 3: A New Beginning|The Devil in Miss Jones 3: A New Beginning]]'' with [[Vanessa del Rio]] and seven studs.&lt;ref name="cinemablue8711" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VdR-blog" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dian Hanson and Vanessa del Rio, [http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/sex/reading_room/175.thats_slut_with_a_capital_s.5.htm "That's 'Slut' with a capital 'S' "], Taschen Books. Retrieved 2012-05-22.&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of pornography on video, a Best Adult Video award was created, won by [[Candida Royalle]] for ''Urban Heat''&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Eve, [http://www.dreve.co.za/shop/femme-productions-–dvd.html "Femme Productions – DVD"]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1985 and ''Christine's Secret'' in 1987.&lt;ref name="cinemablue8711" /&gt;

The annual [[Gerard Damiano]] Special Achievement Award, named after the producer, writer and director of the [[1972 in film|1972]] cult classic ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'', went to actress [[Georgina Spelvin]] in 1982,&lt;ref name="stagerotic8208" /&gt;&lt;ref name="spelvin-cafa" /&gt; Erica Eaton, publicist and former CAFA chairperson, in 1985&lt;ref name="cheri1085" /&gt; and [[Gloria Leonard]] in 1987.&lt;ref name="cinemablue8711" /&gt;&lt;ref name="exfg8801" /&gt;

== Notes ==
{{Refbegin}}
{{note|byron|1}}There is a discrepancy as to which movie(s) Tom Byron won for in 1985. ''Cheri'' magazine states "He managed to walk off with Best Actor (for ''Sister Dearest'') and Best Supporting Actor (''Talk Dirty To Me III'')".&lt;ref name="cheri1085" /&gt; Internet Adult Film Database founder Peter Van Aarle lists ''Private Teacher'' as his Best Actor win and ''Sister Dearest'' as his Best Supporting Actor award.&lt;ref name="rame" /&gt;

{{note|snake|2}} In the book ''The X-Rated Videotape Guide II'', author [[Robert Rimmer]] states, "In May 1987, the CAFA (a New York film critics group) gave ''Snake Eyes II'' awards for Best Script (Anne Randall), Best Actor (Jerry Butler, who also received it for the original ''Snake Eyes''), and Best Director (Cecil Howard)."&lt;ref name="Rimmer"&gt;Robert H. Rimmer, [https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/087975673X/ref=sib_dp_ptu#reader-link ''The X-Rated Videotape Guide II''], p. 522. Prometheus Books, 1991. {{ISBN|0-87975-673-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this seems unlikely as ''Snake Eyes II'' was not released until 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0191473|''Snake Eyes II''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iafd"&gt;Data for ''Snake Eyes 2'' was taken from the [http://www.iafd.com/title.rme/title=snake+eyes+2/year=1987/snake-eyes-2.htm Internet Adult Film Database].&lt;/ref&gt; and it contradicts two other sources that list Butler and Howard winning in 1987 for ''Star Angel'' and no category called Best Script.&lt;ref name="cinemablue8711" /&gt;&lt;ref name="exfg8801" /&gt; Possibly ''Snake Eyes II'' won the following year, however, there doesn't seem to be a record of whether any awards were held in 1988.

'''David Appel''' ({{lang-he|דוד אפל}}, born 7 August 1950) is an Israeli [[businessman]], [[general contractor]], and [[Likud]] party [[activist]].

==Background==
Appel was raised by his grandparents, and educated in an [[World ORT|ORT]] technical dormitory school in [[Hod HaSharon#Magdiel|Magdiel]], where he studied [[printing]]. He was not drafted into the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] due to an injury sustained when printing machinery fell on his hand. At age 20 he joined the Likud youth organisation, where he formed lifelong friendships with many people who would later become influential [[Politics of Israel|Israeli politicians]].

In 1975 he opened a baby products store in [[Tel Aviv]], which eventually became a national chain. He was also a partner in the [[Gaza City|Gazan]] UP-7 company. In 1977 he sold his chain and opened a general contracting firm with partner ''Shalom Prussak'', which became state-recognised within three years and ultimately built thousands of housing units, many of them under contract for the Israeli Housing Ministry.

==Corruption charges==
The [[Attorney General of Israel]] ruled that between 1983 and 1986, Appel's contracting company had operated in a manner violating the law, and only 13 years later in 1997 he was cleared of all charges.

In 2003 the State again brought charges against Appel, this time dealing with four separate cases of [[bribery]] and dishonest business practices.&lt;ref&gt;Yitzhak Danon, "David Appel Indicted on Bribery Charges", ''Asia-Africa Intelligence Wire'', 11 September 2003, [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-24406713_ITM] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522193707/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-24406713_ITM |date=22 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The indictment charged that he had promised civil servants reelection in exchange for approving his projects in [[Central District (Israel)|Central Israel]], especially [[Lod]] and [[Giv'at Shmuel]]. Among those accused of accepting bribes were former MK Nehama Ronen, then director of the Environment Ministry, [[Israel Land Administration]] official Oded Tal, Lod mayor Benny Regev, and Giv'at Shmuel council head Zamir ben Ari.

In 2004 he was charged with [[bribery|bribing]] [[Israeli prime minister]] [[Ariel Sharon]], in what became known as the [[Greek Island Affair]], and was also charged with five other bribe offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/the-amended-bribery-indictment-against-david-appel-1.111791 |title=The amended bribery indictment against David Appel |publisher=Haaretz, |date=23 January 2004 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attorney General [[Menachem Mazuz]] eventually ruled that Sharon could not be charged with receiving bribes from Appel. As of September 2008 all but one bribery charge against Appel had been dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Tomer Zarchin |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/businessman-and-defendant-police-manipulate-justice-system-1.254586 |title=Businessman and defendant: Police manipulate justice system |work=Haaretz |date=25 September 2008 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Domenico Scala''' (born 1965 in Basel, Switzerland) is a Swiss-Italian manager in the [[biopharmaceutical]] industry, and the former chairman of the [[FIFA]] Audit &amp; Compliance Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/fifa-wer-ist-der-neue-boss-domenico-scala-a-1036840.html|title=Interimschef Domenico Scala: Dieser Mann soll jetzt die Fifa führen|publisher=Spiegel Online|work=spiegel.de|date=2015-06-02|language=German|accessdate=2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Scala has a university degree in economics from the [[University of Basel]]. After his studies he worked for Nestlé, Panalpina and Roche, where he held various senior leadership positions.

==Dental appointments==
In 2003, he became CFO of Syngenta AG and in 2007 CEO of the Swedish-Swiss dental company [[Nobel Biocare]], specializing in dental implants. He is on the advisory board of [[Tufts University]] in Boston, the second largest dental faculty in North America. Since November 2011 he is Vice-Chairman of [[Basilea Pharmaceutica|Basilea Pharmaceutica Ltd.]] and since January 2015 Chairman of i-net innovation networks Switzerland. In 2004, he was one of a selected few executives to be named "Young Global Leader" by the World Economic Forum (WEF).

== Football ==
In May 2013 the FIFA congress elected Scala as chairman of the Audit &amp; Compliance Committee of [[FIFA]], [[association football]]'s international governing body. The committee has the task of overseeing FIFA's business practices. In June 2, 2015, he assumed the oversight/leadership of a reform program within FIFA. On September 10, 2015, he published a comprehensive governance reform report on FIFA. On February 26, 2016 the FIFA congress approved significant governance reforms, which have largely been devised by Domenico Scala along his reform "blueprint" published in September 2015. Scala's proposals are essentially looking to reshape FIFA along the lines of a modern corporation. Scala's most significant reforms are to introduce term limits and to split the governing executive committee along the lines of large corporations. They have a board to set strategy and oversee the work of an executive board, which conducts the day-to-day business. Domenico Scala has also called for the six confederations to themselves undergo reforms, including integrity checks for their officials along the lines of those introduced at FIFA for all elected officials.

In an interview published on 7 June 2015, Scala stated that [[Russia]] and [[Qatar]] would possibly no longer be eligible to host the [[FIFA World Cup]] competitions in 2018 and 2022 if evidence of bribery was proven, saying "Should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33041467|title='Russia &amp; Qatar may lose World Cups' - Fifa official|publisher=BBC News|date=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/07/russia-qatar-lose-world-cups-if-bribery-found-fifa|title=Russia and Qatar may lose World Cups if evidence of bribery is found|author=Owen Gibson|date=7 June 2015|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scala resigned from his position at FIFA on May 14, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36293324&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5437">'''Ferdinand Osvald Conrad Anker''' (12 December 1876 – 23 April 1954) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] businessperson.

==Pre-war career==
Anker was born in [[Oslo|Christiania]], attended commerce school and resided in [[Germany]] and [[France]] between 1897 and 1899. In 1899 he started his own company, trading in iron, steel and other construction metals. He later expanded the company with the selling of [[agricultural machinery]]. In 1910 he abandoned the company he had started in order to take the head job of [[P. Schreiner sen. &amp; Co]], a company ran by his father beforehand.&lt;ref name=merkbio&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor-last=Hoffstad|editor-first=Einar|editor-link=Einar Hoffstad|title=Anker, F(erdinand)|encyclopedia=[[Merkantilt biografisk leksikon]]|publisher=Yrkesforlaget|location=Oslo|year=1935|page=34|url=http://runeberg.org/merkbio/0108.html|language=Norwegian|accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anker became a board member of [[Kværner Brug]] in 1910, and advanced to chairman in 1914. He also chaired [[Myrens Verksted]], [[Moss Værft &amp; Dokk]], Landbruk Maskin (in both Oslo and Florø), A/S Staal &amp; Jern and Jernmetal.&lt;ref name=merkbio/&gt; He was a main shareholder in Landbruk Maskin, Staal &amp; Jern and Jernmetal, and a board member of [[Elektrisk Bureau]],&lt;ref name=lagmann&gt;{{cite news|title=Saken mot Ferdinand Anker for lagmannsrett|date=5 September 1946|work=[[Verdens Gang]]|page=5|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; supervisory council member of [[Nationaltheatret]] and [[Christiania Bank og Kreditkasse]], and also chaired two philanthropical institutions run by his family. Heavily engaged in politics, Anker was a member of the financial committee of the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]]'s central board from 1909 to 1916. From 1925 he chaired the [[employers' association]] Jerngrossistenes Forening.&lt;ref name=merkbio/&gt;

==Second World War and later life==
In February 1946 Anker was arrested together with the office manager in P. Schreiner sen. &amp; Co, on suspicion of "economic treason", as a part of the [[legal purge in Norway after World War II]]. Specific accounts were his involvement in the collection of 8000 tons of [[tin]] for [[Wehrmacht]], stockpiling of 12,100 tons of iron for the [[Kriegsmarine]]werft in [[Horten]], stockpiling of iron at the grounds of his companies in Florø, Harstad and Trondheim, as well as utilization of forced labour in doing so, delivery of spikes to a ''Luftgau-Kommando'', building of armed whaling vessels for the ''Kriegsmarine'', "statements during the war" and collection of business orders issued by Germany while the [[Norwegian Campaign|Second World War]] was still ongoing in Norway.&lt;ref name=lagmann/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ferdinand Anker for forhørsrett i dag|date=25 February 1946|work=Verdens Gang|page=1|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lagmann2&gt;{{cite news|title=Ferdinand Anker husker ikke "detaljer"|date=11 September 1946|work=Verdens Gang|page=8|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anker pleaded not guilty, and referred to his office manager who handled the daily affairs.&lt;ref name=lagmann2/&gt; He was found not guilty of the spike deliverance. In spite of this, he was found guilty of high treason, and sentenced to one year of prison and a {{NOK|3 million|link=yes}} fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anker fikk 1 års lengsel og 3 millioners bot|date=24 September 1946|work=Verdens Gang|page=1|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2011}}, This represents about {{NOK|54,4 million}} in currency (about {{USD|10 million|link=yes}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssb.no/vis/kpi/kpiregn.html|title=Konsumprisindeksen|publisher=[[Statistics Norway]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950 Anker was sued, as chairman of Moss Værft &amp; Dokk, by [[Øivind Lorentzen]]'s company Sobral. Sobral claimed that Moss Værft &amp; Dokk negliged their contract agreement regarding the construction of two vessels during the war. First, claimed Sobral, Moss Værft &amp; Dokk had instead used their capacity on arming whaling vessels. The two vessels had been delayed, and when they were completed, they had been taken over by ''Kriegsmarine'' as [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s. The court case lasted several years, reaching the Court of Appeal in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Erstatningskrav på 7 mill kroner mot Moss Værft &amp; Dokk|date=20 February 1950|work=Verdens Gang|page=1|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Millionsak i Lagmannsretten|date=16 February 1954|work=Verdens Gang|page=10|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Franz Josef Popp''' (14 January 1886 in [[Vienna]] &amp;ndash; 29 July 1954 in [[Stuttgart]]) was one of three men responsible for the founding of [[BMW|BMW AG]] and the First General Director of BMW AG from 1922 to 1942.

A number of different candidates have been put forward as the “founders” of BMW AG. In the absence of [[Karl Rapp]], [[Gustav Otto]], [[Max Friz]] or [[Camillo Castiglioni]] the company would probably never have been born.  However, Franz Josef Popp can lay claim to being the prime force in the development of the mobility company we know today. He was “General Director” of the company from its foundation until he was forced to relinquish his position in 1942.

==Early years==
Popp was born in [[Vienna]] in 1886 and in 1901 his family moved to [[Brno]] where he completed his university entrance qualification at the local grammar school. He went on to study mechanical and electrical engineering at the local Technical College and qualified with a degree in engineering in 1909. When he returned to [[Vienna]], Franz Josef Popp joined the Viennese company [[AEG]]-Union as an electrical engineer. He soon became head of the department for “Electric Trains and Locomotives”, and one of his responsibilities was to develop electric locomotives for the [[Mittenwald]] railway.  At the start of the First World War, Popp joined the [[Kaiserliche und Konigliche Luftfahrtruppen]] or "[[K.u.K. Luftfahrtruppen]]" ([[Austro-Hungarian Imperial and Royal Aviation Troops]]) as a marine engineer at the Pula base on the [[Adriatic Sea]] (in present-day [[Croatia]]). This is where he had spent his military service as a one-year volunteer during his course of studies. However, three weeks later he was ordered back to Vienna to oversee construction for aircraft engine production, initially at [[AEG]] and then at the [[Austro-Daimler]] works in [[Wiener Neustadt]]. In this capacity, Popp traveled to Germany a number of times to visit the biggest aircraft engine manufacturers in the Reich- [[Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft|Daimler]], [[Neue Automobil Gesellschaft|NAG]] and [[Benz &amp; Cie.|Benz]]. The purpose was to explore opportunities for the production under license of German prototypes at the Austro-Daimler works. Unfortunately, these exploratory talks came to nothing. The Austro-Daimler works went on to develop their own new 12-cylinder aircraft engine for the Austrian navy, although there was not sufficient capacity available for production of this engine. It was necessary to find a production facility that was in a position to manufacture the engine in the quantities required by the military authorities.  While he was serving in [[Pula|Pola]], Popp had got to know the [[Rapp Motorenwerke]] (Rapp Engine Works) in [[Munich]]. This company had the necessary skilled workforce and production facilities for manufacturing aircraft engines, but it lacked a competitive product since its engines were not successful as aircraft engines. Given this scenario, Popp regarded the Rapp Engine works as an ideal production facility for manufacturing the 12-cylinder Austro-Daimler engine. He lobbied hard for this solution and was successful in convincing the responsible authorities to take up his suggestion. In 1916, he was dispatched to Munich as the representative of the Austrian Navy to supervise production under license at the [[Rapp Motorenwerke]] (Rapp Motor Works).  However, Popp was worried about unsatisfactory decisions and targets set by the technical and commercial managers.  He became concerned that volumes determined contractually would not be complied with. To ensure compliance with production targets, Popp effectively began to take on the role of factory manager.  Popp ensured that [[Max Friz]], a very talented young engineer at Daimler who had recently applied for a position, was hired by Rapp (Friz and Rapp were colleagues together at Austro-Daimler) .  Popp understood that Rapp Motorenwerke very much needed a chief engineer with new ideas on making aircraft engines.

==The “General Director” ==
[[Image:Appointment certificate for Franz Josef Popp 1917.jpg|130px|thumb|Appointment Certificate naming Popp as General Director of BMW GmbH in 1917]]
After the success of the [[BMW IIIa]] aeromotor, it was decided that Karl Rapp's contract be terminated by the managing board of Rapp Motorenwerke.&lt;ref&gt;D. Kiley (2004)''Driven: Inside BMW, the Most Admired Car Company in the World''p.50;John Wiley and Sons ;{{ISBN|0-471-26920-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franz Josef Popp was appointed as managing director of the company, while at the same time, the name of the company was changed from Rapp Motorenwerke into [[Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH]]. This was intended to signal a new beginning to the outside world. Following conversion into a joint-stock company, he was head of the Bayerische Motoren Werke as Chairman of the Board of Management with the title General Director. At the end of the First World War, Popp was responsible for switching the young company from aircraft engine production to peacetime production. With this aim in mind, he worked towards creating a link with Knorr Bremse AG, and from 1919 onwards, the factory started manufacturing Knorr brakes for the Bavarian Railway. In 1922, Popp was responsible for transferring the most important patents, machinery and personnel for engine manufacture “to the umbrella of the [[BMW|Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG]]”, together with the company name “[[Bayerische Motoren Werke AG]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Handelsregister-Auszüge July 6, 1922&lt;/ref&gt; He was assisted in this endeavor by the Austrian financier [[Camillo Castiglioni]]. In this way he was able to break free from [[Knorr Bremse AG]] and start up engine construction once more.

==New areas of business==
The rise of BMW to one of Bavaria’s and Germany’s big industrial companies began in 1922 under Popp’s management. The product range of BMW AG was expanded and soon it extended beyond engines for the aircraft industry to include motorcycles as broader sections of the population gained access to motorized transport. This was an area to which Popp devoted considerable attention. Under his chairmanship, BMW AG further expanded its product range and know-how in 1928 by purchasing the vehicle manufacturing factory [[Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach]] (FFE). This was the
first time that cars bore the BMW brand on the roads.In 1928, Popp also concluded a license agreement with the US American company Pratt &amp; Whitney, allowing BMW to manufacture two air-cooled radial engines. This ensured that BMW had access to key know-how in an area of aircraft engine construction with a great future. The expertise acquired through production under license allowed BMW to develop air-cooled radial engines under its own steam during the 1930s. Construction of the BMW aircraft engine factory in [[Allach-Untermenzing|Allach]] (1935), expansion of the manufacturing facilities in Eisenach (1937) and acquisition of the Brandenburg Motor Works (Bramo) in Berlin-Spandau enabled BMW to expand capacities for aircraft engine manufacture under Popp’s leadership.  Following the acquisition of Bramo in 1939, BMW enjoyed a monopoly for the production of air-cooled aircraft engines in Germany. This made BMW a key strategic company for the German aviation industry as the [[Third Reich]] rearmed. However, Popp was skeptical of the rapid expansion and redirection of the company for purposes of arming Germany in preparation for war.

==Political meddling==
These reservations were not politically motivated. Even though Popp admitted that he joined the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]] on 1 May 1933 under pressure from [[Adolf Wagner|Gauleiter Wagner]], head of the Bavarian administrative district, he kept his distance from the party. Looking back, he maintained that joining the party shortly after
the National Socialists seized power was simply intended to prevent his removal as General Director of BMW. In February 1936, the local group leader of the National Socialist Party started proceedings to exclude Popp from the party. This was based on accusations that despite warnings, Popp continued to allow his family to be treated by a Jewish family doctor. Following an official “warning” from the Munich Party Court, Popp put the matter to rest, not least to prevent the issue from escalating and endangering his position as Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG. Popp’s skepticism against shifting the focus of production at BMW to aircraft engine production was based on his thinking that this would provide a one sided orientation for the group by focusing its activities on armament in preparation for war. Although this area was financially lucrative, it would mean that the group was heavily dependent on decisions made by the National Socialist regime. In June 1940, he wrote to the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, [[Emil Georg von Stauss]], explaining that the situation could “threaten the very existence of BMW AG if there were any setback to aircraft engine production”.  The strategically important position of BMW for air armament would lead to a rise in the volume of specifications and more interference from political and military agencies, which would in turn increasingly restrict the scope for entrepreneurial manoeuvre. This would weaken the position of the group’s management.  It would also erode the position of Franz Josef Popp, who up until then had directed the company largely autonomously and autocratically.

==Tense climate==
As the war progressed, the increasing shortage of labor and raw materials combined with the opaque procurement policy of the Reich Air Ministry to ensure that BMW fell well behind the production output requested. This increased the pressure pervading the already tense atmosphere between Popp and the responsible General Aviation Supervisor Erhard Milch in the Air Ministry. Popp’s attempts to gain backing from influential official quarters
against Milch’s demands and to obtain realistic production requirements proved counter-productive. The General Aviation Supervisor felt slighted by Popp’s actions and accused him of refusing to perform his duty and of
sabotage. Since Popp’s management style had already caused significant tensions in the BMW Board of Management
prior to the disputes with the ministry, the Supervisory Board attempted to solve the conflicts by granting Popp leave of absence in January 1942. To prevent public speculation about the management change, Popp was appointed to the Supervisory Board but was no longer able to influence the day-to-day running of the company from this position.

==Unsuccessful comeback==
Directly after the end of the war, at the age of 59, Popp was again appointed by the Supervisory Board to the Board of Management in May 1945. One month later, the Allies arrested him on account of his title Military Economic Leader, which he had been granted in the course of the war. During the denazification process he was designated as a “nominal member of the Nazi party” and was finally, after an appeal, classified as
“untainted”.&lt;ref&gt;Certificate of non-involvement (''[[Persilschein]]'') for Franz-Josef Popp, February 5, 1946;BMW Historical Archives&lt;/ref&gt;  Franz Josef Popp then once more attempted to join the Board of Management at the Bayerische Motoren Werke. However, his attempts were completely unsuccessful and his move to Stuttgart marked the end of these ambitions. Popp died there on 29 July 1954.

[[File:Ruben, Gad and Hans Rausing with the first Tetra Pak filling machine.jpg|thumbnail|Ruben, Gad and Hans Rausing with the first Tetra Pak filling machine prototype, 1967]]

Dr. '''Gad Rausing''' (19 May 1922 &amp;ndash; 28 January 2000) was a Swedish industrialist and archaeologist. Together with his brother [[Hans Rausing|Hans]] he inherited the Swedish packaging company [[Tetra Pak]], founded by their father [[Ruben Rausing]] and currently the largest [[food packaging]] company in the world by sales (2011).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2011-06/20/content_12732084.htm "Creating a Benchmark for Recycling Rubbish"], ''China Daily'', retrieved 7 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 Rausing bought out his brother's interest in the company in what was at the time the most extensive private buyout in Europe.&lt;ref name="Ingram"&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/tetra-pak-international-s-a Tetra Pak International S.A.] Frederick C. Ingram in ''The Gale Directory of Company Histories'', retrieved 4 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Gad Rausing had a lifelong passion for archaeology and the humanities and was an accomplished scholar, earning his PhD. from the [[University of Lund]] in 1967 with a dissertation on Scandinavian pre-historic bows and arrow-heads.&lt;ref name="Ravo"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/08/business/gad-rausing-77-swedish-innovator-of-beverage-containers.html "Gad Rausing, 77, Swedish Innovator of Beverage Containers"], ''New York Times'', 8 February 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/713607/Gad-Anders-Rausing Gad Anders Rausing] Encyclopædia Britannica, retrieved 30 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his work as Deputy Managing Director at [[Tetra Pak]] he was a frequent lecturer at the Institute of Archaeology at [[Lund University]] and the author of several books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/vemardet/1969/0802.html Gad Rausing] Who's Who 1969 (Swedish), retrieved 8 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Rausing was born in [[Bromma]], outside of [[Stockholm]], in 1922 as the eldest son of industrialist [[Ruben Rausing]] and his wife Elisabeth (née Varenius). He had two younger brothers, [[Hans Rausing|Hans]] and Sven.

==Career==
Rausing studied chemistry at the [[University of Lund]] and began his career as the head of the research laboratory at [[Åkerlund &amp; Rausing]], his father's company, where he was in charge of the team developing suitable materials for the newly invented [[tetrahedron]] package.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/329074 "Gad Rausing"], ''The Economist'', 3 February 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The [[tetrahedron]] subsequently became the central product of [[Tetra Pak]], which was founded in 1951 as a subsidiary to Åkerlund &amp; Rausing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tetrapak.com/about_tetra_pak/the_company/history/pages/ourhistory.aspx "Our History"], Tetrapak.com, retrieved 8 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Rausing joined [[Tetra Pak]] as Deputy Managing Director in 1954. Over the years the company evolved from a small family business with six full-time employees, in 1954, into a multi-national corporation with over 20,000 employees (2011), a development much of which has been credited to the leadership of Rausing and his brother throughout the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="Ingram"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ravo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tetrapak.com/about_tetra_pak/the_company/facts_and_figures/pages/default.aspx "Company Facts and Figures"], Tetrapak.com, retrieved 30 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The great success of the business was largely the result of their development of [[aseptic processing|aseptic packaging technology]], developed in the 1950s and early 1960s and later called the most important food packaging innovation of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/tetra-pak-international-s-a Tetra Pak International S.A.] Frederick C. Ingram in ''The Gale Directory of Company Histories'', retrieved 30 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Rausing had a parallel career as a scholar in pre-historic Scandinavian archaeology and was a [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] at the Institute of Archaeology at [[Lund University]].&lt;ref&gt;Leander, Lars, ''Tetra Pak. A Vision Becomes Reality.

A '''Geospatial Information Officer (GIO)''' is the head of [[geospatial]] [[information technology]] within a civilian, business, government and/or military organization. The high demand for efficient geospatial data requires dedicated leadership in data collection, production and analysis.

== U.S. Military ==

In March 2008, the U.S. Army Geospatial–Enterprise Governance Board (GGB) created the GIO position, with the Director, U.S. Army Topographic Engineering Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tec.army.mil |title=Army Geospatial Center, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers |publisher=Tec.army.mil |date= |accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; (TEC) as the U.S. Army's "central manager responsible for coordination, assessment, and synchronization of all Army policies and standardization requirements for the geospatial information enterprise."

Robert Burkhardt, the Army's first GIO stated, “The technology is available to enable battle command systems to collect information once and allow discovery and exploitation by all, however, without these standards, it is difficult to present unified, understandable solutions within and outside of the Army.”{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Dr. Joseph Fontanella, Director of the U.S. Army Geospatial Center, is the current GIO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agc.army.mil/About/Leadership/Bio-Article-View/Article/480940/dr-joseph-f-fontanella/ |title=Army Geospatial Center, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers |publisher=agc.army.mil |date= |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gil Oved''' (born 16 August 1975) is a South African entrepreneur who is the co-founder and co-CEO of [[The Creative Counsel]], [[South Africa]]’s largest [[advertising agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.entrepreneurmag.co.za/advice/success-stories/entrepreneur-profiles/the-creative-counsel-ran-neu-ner-and-gil-oved/ |title=The Creative Counsel: Ran Neu-Ner and Gil Oved |author= Juliet Pitman |date=1 October 2012 |publisher=Entrepreneur Magazine |access-date=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of the global [[Young Presidents’ Organisation]] where he is the [[Johannesburg]] chapter chair as well as the Africa regional forum officer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ypo.org/ypopodcast/why-did-you-join-ypo-interview-with-gil-oved-group-co-ceo-of-the-creative-counsel/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of the Dragons on the hugely popular television reality show [[Dragons’ Den]] South Africa which premiered in the last quarter of 2014 on [[DSTV]].&lt;ref&gt;http://mzansimagic.dstv.com/profiles/gil-oved/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Oved was chosen as the first "Shark" on the new series of [[Shark Tank]] on [[M-NET]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channel24.co.za/TV/News/meet-the-first-shark-of-shark-tank-sa-20160721 |title=Meet the first 'shark' of Shark Tank SA |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=21 July 2016 |website= |publisher=Channel24 |access-date=22 July 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life==
Oved was born on 16 August 1975 in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]].He matriculated at [[Crawford College, Sandton]], earned a Bachelor of Commerce degree (Cum Laude) at the [[University of South Africa]], and subsequently obtained a chartered financial analyst (CFA) qualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://joburgnorth.getitonline.co.za/2015/01/26/getting-know-gil-oved/|title=Getting to know Gil Oved|date=2015-01-26|work=Get It Online Joburg North|access-date=2018-06-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager at the time of South Africa’s first democratic elections in 1994, Oved’s imagination was fired by the country’s new potential for transformation. He became an anchor presenter for the country’s first multi-racial television teen magazine programme called Zap Mag. He was the anchor presenter from 1990-1995, along with a Vusi Twala. Twala and Oved became close friends and, after they matriculated, started a television production company in 1996 known as Jewazi (a combination of the words Jew and Swazi).

The production company saw some successes over its approximate three years of existence and had programmes commissioned by the SABC (South African Broadcasting Corporation) most noteworthy SuperKidz, but never got the traction needed to create a sustainable business. Oved set his sights on the next goal. He teamed up with a friend from school, [[Ran Neu-Ner]], to start an Internet trading company just as the dot.com bubble was expanding.

The pair raised almost a million dollars and invested three years in developing their business called Wealthmaker but, when the dot.com bubble burst in the early 2000s, their investors went bankrupt, and they followed suit.
Observing that Neu-Ner’s girlfriend of the time, a student who was earning extra money as a promotional field worker, was earning considerably more than they were, Oved and Neu-Ner decided to set up a small low risk, low barrier-to-entry business placing promotional staff.

Although initially a ‘stop-gap’ initiative, both men found that they enjoyed the process of helping clients think through campaigns and began to take very seriously the creative process and execution of brand building through promotions and activations. 

The company grew exponentially, through the acquisition of new clients as well as other businesses in the advertising and marketing sector attracting the attention of Publicis Groupe who bought the Company in September 2015. TCC operates under Publicis Africa Group. Oved remains group co-CEO together with Neu-Ner. The Creative Counsel has retained its name.

Oved lives in the Johannesburg region.

In 2014 Oved became one of the dragons in the first season of South Africa's [[Dragons' Den]] along with [[Vinny Lingham]], [[Lebo Gunguluza]], [[Vusi Thembekwayo]] and [[Polo Leteka Radebe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.destinyman.com/2014/08/08/meet-sas-own-dragons/ |title=Meet SA’s own Dragons |author=Destiny Reporter |date=8 August 2014 |publisher=Ndalo Media |access-date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 was chosen as the first 'Shark' in the South African version of the [[Shark Tank]] series by [[M-Net|MNET]]. The Shark Tank series is sponsored in full by [[Telkom South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/entertainment/2016/07/22/Multi-millionaire-Gil-Oved-set-to-be-the-first-shark-in-M-Net%E2%80%99s-Shark-Tank |title=Multi-millionaire Gil Oved set to be the first shark in M-Net’s Shark Tank |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=22 July 2016 |publisher=TimesLive |access-date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''honesty bar''' is an unattended beverage [[Bar (establishment)|bar]], typically in the lobby or lounge of a [[hotel]], where payment is left to the guest. Honesty bars differ significantly from in-room [[mini-bar]]s, where any consumption is automatically charged to the guest's account. 

Honesty bars are less common than staffed bars, but can be found in a number of [[boutique hotel]]s and other small hotels,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Travel Weekly Group, London.|last=Watt|first=S|date=2012|work=The Independent|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the executive floors of fine hotels. No staff attend the bar and therefore it is left to the honesty of the guest to report his or her own consumption. Honesty bars are convenient, since a guest can make or serve a drink at any time, keeping a tab for himself or herself for the length of the stay. Generally drinks are cheaper in an honesty bar, since no staff must be paid to attend the area continuously.

Honesty bars are generally stocked with popular beverages, mixers, and feature a standard bar setup. It is common to find a manual of basic cocktails.

'''Ignacio María Agirrezabala Ibarbia''', nicknamed '''Chirri II''' (10 May 1909 &amp;ndash; 11 September 1979) was a Spanish [[association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]]. He played four times for [[Spain national football team|Spain]].&lt;ref name=eusko/&gt;&lt;ref name=cerebro/&gt;

==Career==
At club level, he played for [[Athletic Bilbao]] for eight seasons, coinciding with the introduction of [[La Liga]] in 1929;&lt;ref name=tres&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://as.com/futbol/2016/03/02/primera/1456885081_399224.amp.html |title=Las tres grandes delanteras que hubo en la historia el Athletic |trans-title=The three great forward lines in the history of Athletic |language=es |work=[[Diario AS]] |date=2 March 2016 |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.athletic-club.eus/en/1928-1937.html |title=History: 1928-1937 |publisher=[[Athletic Bilbao]] |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he won three national titles ([[1929–30 La Liga|1929–30]], [[1930–31 La Liga|1930–31]], [[1933–34 La Liga|1933–34]]), three consecutive [[Copa del Rey|Copas del Rey]] ([[1930 Copa del Rey Final|1930]], [[1931 Copa del Rey Final|1931]], [[1932 Copa del Rey Final|1932]],&lt;ref name=bombin/&gt;&lt;ref name=eusko/&gt; also contributing to a fourth in [[1933 Copa del Rey Final|1933]] although he did not take part in the final) and several editions of the regional [[Biscay Championship]], all before he elected to withdraw from playing at the age of 26.&lt;ref name=cerebro/&gt;

Chirri II was an integral part of what became known as the 'first historic front line' of Athletic Bilbao, combining with [[José Iraragorri]], [[Agustín Sauto Arana|Bata]], [[Guillermo Gorostiza]], [[Ramón de la Fuente Leal|Lafuente]] (as well as [[Víctor Unamuno]]).&lt;ref name=cerebro/&gt;&lt;ref name=tres/&gt;&lt;ref name=official/&gt;&lt;ref name=balaroja&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.futbolprimera.es/2012/03/12/el-abecedario-del-futbol-guillermo-gorostiza-la-bala-roja-de-san-mames |title=El 'Abecedario' del fútbol: Guillermo Gorostiza, la bala roja de San Mamés |trans-title=The 'ABC' of football: Guillermo Gorostiza, the red bullet of San Mamés |language=es |website=Fútbol Primera |date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=history9836&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inbedwithmaradona.com/retro/2012/7/4/the-history-of-athletic-bilbao-1898-1936.html|title=The history of Athletic Bilbao 1898-1936|last=Radnedge|first=Keir|publisher=[[World Soccer (magazine)|World Soccer]] (via In Bed With Maradona)|date=1 August 1977|accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been characterised as a playmaker whose focus was on the creative and technical aspects of the game, in contrast to most forwards of the era who relied mainly on physical power to overcome opponents.&lt;ref name=cerebro/&gt;&lt;ref name=mitica&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.elenganche.es/2009/05/equipos-historicos-la-delantera-mitica/ |title=Equipos históricos: La delantera mítica |trans-title=Historical teams: The mythical forward line |language=es  |website=El Enganche |date=12 May 2009|accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to have initiated the practice of destroying the bowler hat worn by the coach [[Fred Pentland]] after victories, which became a regular ritual for the successful team.&lt;ref name=bombin&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://athletic.elcorreo.com/final-copa-rey-2015/noticias/201505/16/quinto-bombin-20150515150048.html |title=El quinto bombín |trans-title=The fifth bowler hat |language=es |work=[[El Correo]] |date=16 May 2015 |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mitica/&gt;

When the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out in 1936, he joined the [[Basque Country national football team]] which toured Europe and Latin America in exile,&lt;ref name=balaroja/&gt;&lt;ref name=eusko/&gt; remaining in Argentina when the rest of the squad moved on to Mexico where they founded a [[CD Euzkadi]] club team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://as.com/futbol/2016/03/02/primera/1456885081_399224.amp.html |title=La selección de Euskadi parte para América (1937) |trans-title=The selection of Euskadi leaves for America (1937) |language=es |work=[[Diario AS]] |date=2 March 2016 |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agirrezabala worked in an engineering and construction firm before deciding to return to Bilbao with his family after eight years, where he became a director of a company in the same industry.&lt;ref name=cerebro/&gt;&lt;ref name=eusko&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://aunamendi.eusko-ikaskuntza.eus/en/aguirrezabala-ibarbia-ignacio/ar-17597/ |title=Aguirrezabala Ibarbia, Ignacio |language=es |publisher=Eusko Ikaskuntza  |year=2007|accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sociology}}
'''Industrial sociology''', until recently a crucial research area within the field of '''sociology of work''', examines
{{quote|the direction and implications of trends in [[technological]] change, [[globalization]], labour markets, work organization, [[managerial]] practices and [[division of labour|employment relations]] to the extent to which these trends are intimately related to changing patterns of inequality in modern societies and to the changing experiences of individuals and families the ways in which workers challenge, resist and make their own contributions to the patterning of work and shaping of work institutions.{{sfn|Watson|2008|p=392}}}}

== Labour process theory ==
One branch of industrial sociology is [[labour process theory]] (LPT). In 1974, [[Harry Braverman]] wrote ''[[Labor and Monopoly Capital]]'', which provided a critical analysis of scientific management. This book analysed [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[economic production|productive]] relations from a [[Marxist]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Meiksins |first=Peter |year=1994 |title='Labor and Monopoly Capital' for the 1990s: A Review and Critique of the Labor Process Debate |magazine=Monthly Review |volume=46 |issue=6 |location=New York |issn=0027-0520}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Marx, Braverman argued that work within capitalist organizations was exploitative and alienating, and therefore workers had to be coerced into servitude. For Braverman the pursuit of capitalist interests over time ultimately leads to deskilling and routinization of the worker. The [[Taylorism|Taylorist]] work design is the ultimate embodiment of this tendency.

Braverman demonstrated several mechanisms of control in both the factory [[blue-collar]] and clerical [[white-collar worker|white-collar]] labour force.
His key contribution is his "[[deskilling]]" thesis.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}  Braverman argued that capitalist owners and managers were incessantly driven to deskill the labour force to lower production costs{{sfn|Attewell|1987|pp=324–325}} and ensure higher productivity.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Deskilled labour is cheap and above all easy to control due to the workers' lack of direct engagement in the production process.{{sfn|Attewell|1987|pp=324–325}} In turn work becomes intellectually or emotionally unfulfilling; the lack of capitalist reliance on human skill reduces the need of employers to reward workers in anything but a minimal economic way.

Braverman's contribution to the sociology of work and industry (i.e., industrial sociology) has been important and his theories of the labour process continue to inform teaching and research.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Braverman's thesis has, however, been contested, {{citation needed span |date=July 2018 |text=notably}} by Andrew Freidman in his work ''Industry and Labour'' (1977).{{sfn|Friedman|1977|pp=80–82}}{{verification needed|date=July 2018}} In it, Freidman suggests that whilst the direct control of labour is beneficial for the capitalist under certain circumstances, a degree of "responsible autonomy" can be granted to unionized or "core" workers, in order to harness their skill under controlled conditions. Also, Richard Edwards showed in 1979 that although hierarchy in organizations has remained constant, additional forms of control (such as technical control via email monitoring, call monitoring; bureaucratic control via procedures for leave, sickness etc.) has been added to gain the interests of the capitalist class versus the workers. Duncan Gallie{{sfn|Gallie|1991}} has shown how important it is to approach the question of skill from a social class perspective. In his study, the majority of non-manual, intermediate and skilled manual workers believed that their work had come to demand a higher level of skill, but the majority of manual worker felt that the responsibility and skill needed in their work had either remained constant or declined. This means that Braverman's claims can't be applied to all social classes.

The notion the particular type of technology workers were exposed to shapes their experience was most forcefully argued in a classic study by [[Robert Blauner]].{{sfn|Blauner|1964}} He argued that some work is alienating more than other types because of the different technologies workers use.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Alienation, to Blauner, has four dimensions: powerlessness, meaninglessness, isolation, and self-estrangement.{{sfn|Blauner|1964|pp=15–16}} Individuals are powerless when they can't control their own actions or conditions of work; work is meaningless when it gives employees little or no sense of value, interest or worth; work is isolating when workers cannot identify with their workplace; and work is self-estranging when, at the subjective level, the worker has no sense of involvement in the job.

Blauner's claims however fail to recognize that the same technology can be experienced in a variety of ways. Studies have shown that cultural differences with regard to management–union relations, levels of hierarchical control, and reward and [[performance appraisal]] policies mean that the experience of the same kind of work can vary considerably between countries and firms.{{sfn|Jenkins|1994}} The individualization of work and the need for workers to have more flexible skills in order to respond to technological changes means that Blauner's characterization of work experience is no longer valid. Additionally, workers today may work in teams to alleviate workers' sense of alienation, since they are involved in the entire process, rather than just a small part of it. In conclusion, automative technologies and computerized work systems have typically enhanced workers' job satisfaction and skill deployment in the better-paid, secure public and private sector jobs. But, in more non-skilled manual work, they have just perpetuated job dissatisfaction, especially for the many women involved in this type of work.

Born in [[Limerick]], [[Ireland]], McManus began his business career at his family's construction plant hire firm, and then became an on-course bookmaker at Limerick's [[Markets Field]] greyhound track. He later moved into horse ownership and punting and laying horses on the advice of his associate Jimmy Hayes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In 1982, he and his wife, Noreen, a former mental health nurse,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} bought Martinstown Stud on over {{convert|400|acre|km2}} in [[County Limerick]] from the McCalmont family.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} McManus's first horse was Cill Dara, which had been owned by the late Edenderry solicitor and gambler, Tim O'Toole.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} McManus is now [[National Hunt racing]]'s largest owner, with over 100 horses in training.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In 2006, he built a €20&amp;nbsp;million residence next to Martinstown Stud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Construction starts on JP McManus mansion, mother of all stately homes|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/construction-starts-on-jp-mcmanus-mansion-mother-of-all-stately-homes-26223793.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, he completed a €150&amp;nbsp;million home in Barbados.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Eugene |last=Phelan |title=JP McManus’ €150m Barbados mansion almost complete |url=http://www.limerickleader.ie/news/business/business-news/jp-mcmanus-150m-barbados-mansion-almost-complete-1-5571527 |work=Limerick Leader |publisher=Johnston Publishing |date=10 October 2013 |accessdate=3 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
McManus's first Cheltenham Festival winner was a horse called Mister Donovan in 1982.&lt;ref name="Legend"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Brough|title=The stuff of Legend - Independent.ie|url=https://www.independent.ie/sport/horse-racing/cheltenham/the-stuff-of-legend-30062555.html|accessdate=19 March 2018|work=Independent.ie|date=8 March 2014|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mister Donovan was the second favourite and won the race after the favourite, Angelo Salvini, whipped around at the start.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The rider of Angelo Silvani - Alan Brown - rarely ever rode again. McManus's distinctive green-and-gold-hooped racing colours are those of the [[South Liberties GAA Club]], in Co Limerick. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The most famous{{By whom|date=May 2011}} of his horses is [[Istabraq]], a three-time winner of the [[Champion Hurdle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Connell|first1=Brian|title=Istabraq is floored again|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/istabraq-is-floored-again-1.305079|accessdate=20 March 2018|work=The Irish Times|date=28 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty time champion jockey [[Tony McCoy]] was retained as his stable jockey for a large part of his career, a role that [[Barry Geraghty]] has taken over since McCoy's retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Marcus |last=Townsend |title=Barry Geraghty to replace Tony McCoy as No 1 jockey to leading owner JP McManus.|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/racing/article-3133767/Barry-Geraghty-replace-Tony-McCoy-No-1-jockey-leading-owner-JP-McManus.html |work=Daily Mail |publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd |date=21 June 2015 |accessdate=3 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former champion jockey [[Jonjo O'Neill]] trains some of his horses at the Jackdaws Castle facility which McManus owns. He has often appeared at race meetings in recent years with the British actor Clive Owen. McManus was once close to jockeys Ted Walsh (Greasepaint at Fairyhouse one Easter Monday) and Niall Madden, T. Busteed, F. Codd and C. Roche, Micky Flynn and a slew of others. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

McManus's horse [[Don't Push It]], ridden by McCoy and trained by O'Neill, won the 2010 [[Grand National]] Steeplechase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/horseracing/7575964/Grand-National-2010-Dont-Push-It-is-lucky-15-for-Tony-McCoy-at-Aintree.html|title=Grand National 2010: Don't Push It is lucky 15 for Tony McCoy at Aintree|last=Armytage|first=Marcus|date=10 April 2010|website=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|access-date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, McManus's horse [[Synchronised (horse)|Synchronised]] won the [[Cheltenham Gold Cup]]. Synchronised went on to run in the 2012 [[John Smiths]] [[Grand National]] with champion jockey [[Tony McCoy]] on 14 April 2012. Synchronised threw McCoy on the way to the starting area; after being caught and veterinary checks were performed, Synchronised was re-entered. However, he fell at [[Becher's Brook]] and sadly broke two legs and had to be put down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Death of Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Synchronised at The Grand National 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/apr/14/synchronised-grand-national |accessdate=15 April 2012 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |location=London |first=Greg |last=Wood |date=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; McManus had his 50th Cheltenham festival winner when [[Buveur d'Air]] won the [[2017 Champion Hurdle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Grady|first1=Sean|title=JP all smiles as he notches 50th festival winner - Independent.ie|url=https://m.independent.ie/sport/horse-racing/cheltenham/jp-all-smiles-as-he-notches-50th-festival-winner-35532653.html|accessdate=19 March 2018|work=Independent.ie|date=15 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Currency exchange and business ==
A significant part of McManus' wealth, though not all, appears to have been derived as a private [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] [[Trader (finance)|trader]], though seasoned traders doubt this very much, which McManus operates from a small office over a jewellery shop in Geneva, Switzerland, his city of official residence.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} McManus also had a permanent suite at London's [[Dorchester Hotel]]{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} for over thirty years and he returns to Ireland regularly. Currencies  are apparently his speciality,{{clarify|date=November 2014}} always{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} working on the advice of his good friends [[Dermot Desmond]] and [[Joe Lewis (British businessman)|Joe Lewis]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} He now{{when|date=November 2014}} has a wide portfolio of investments from leisure centres and betting shops to pubs and nursing homes.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} He is a large shareholder in Ladbrokes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} McManus appears to have been a holder of Junior Irish bonds at the time of the downturn.

==Sporting interests==
Together with business associate [[John Magnier]], McManus built up a 28.89 per cent shareholding in [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], which they sold on to businessman [[Malcolm Glazer]] after falling out with manager [[Alex Ferguson]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In 2004, McManus began sponsoring the [[Limerick GAA]] teams, choosing to use the non-commercial Sporting Limerick promotional brand on the jerseys.

He is also a keen [[golf]]er and a close friend of [[Tiger Woods]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} who married at the [[Sandy Lane (resort)|Sandy Lane Hotel]] in Barbados, which McManus co-owns. The wedding at Sandy Lane was a gift from the owners of Sandy Lane to Woods.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

McManus routinely competes in [[Pro-Am]] golf events. He is a two-time winner of the [[Alfred Dunhill Links Championship]] pro-am pairs competition,{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} partnering with [[Pádraig Harrington]] on both occasions.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Glackin Report==
In 1991, an Irish company law inspector, solicitor John Glackin, was appointed by the Irish Government to investigate complicated dealings involving [[Dermot Desmond]] and the purchase and sale of the former Johnston Mooney and O’Brien site in [[Ballsbridge]], Dublin, to [[Telecom Éireann]]. While Desmond represented himself as an intermediary in the sale, Glackin’s report said Mr Desmond, businessman JP McManus and [[John Magnier]] were beneficiaries of the sale. Mr Desmond strenuously disputed Glackin’s findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/0323/1224292846891.html | work=The Irish Times | first=Colm | last=Keena | title=Financier is no stranger to business and political rows | date=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Glackin Report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Author Gavin Sheridan |url=http://thestory.ie/2012/01/17/the-glackin-report-complete/ |title=The Glackin Report – complete – |publisher=Thestory.ie |date=17 January 2012 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoddle Investments (the vehicle through which the deal was handled) executed two contracts with Telecom Éireann for the sale of the Johnston Mooney &amp; O'Brien site for an aggregate price of £9.4&amp;nbsp;million, on 7 May 1990. Glackin concluded that McManus had loaned £1.5&amp;nbsp;million to Chestvale to purchase the site from the liquidator in August 1989. McManus made the investment through an AIB account in Jersey in the name of J&amp;N McMahon. Whether this account was to the benefit of John and Noreen McManus was not confirmed as AIB refused to break client confidentiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1993/0708/Pg001.html | work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report concluded that McManus was a beneficiary of the sale of the site to Telecom Éireann, and received £500,000 in cash from the transaction, which Dermot Desmond had stored in a tennis holdall in his safe. At paragraph 5.4.4 of the report, Glackin concludes that:

{{Quote|text="I am satisfied, on a basis that I believe is reasonable, that Mr. McManus was promised by Mr. Desmond as his consideration for the advance a share of the profits and that this was either agreed in advance or during the period between 29th June 1990 when the money was received from Telecom, and 19th July 1990 when the request was made to Ansbacher for the first cash withdrawal of £100,000. I can find no evidence that any other person received any of the cash of £500,000 and find accordingly that it was received by Mr. McManus."}}No criminal charges were made against McManus or the other principals involved resulting from the findings of the Glackin Report.

== Wealth ==
McManus's personal fortune is estimated at €4&amp;nbsp;billion.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} McManus is reputed to have been affected by the economic downturn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/specials/rich_list/article3800777.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=JP McManus | date=27 April 2008 | accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Charitable contributions ==
In 1996, McManus established the J. P. McManus Scholarship Award which provides €6,750 each year for third level education to eight selected students at his former secondary school C.B.S. Sexton Street in Limerick.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Every five years, he organises the J. P. McManus Invitation Pro-Am golf tournament in Limerick to raise funds for Limerick charities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} He has been awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Limerick and has funded the new Kemmy Business School at the University. Jim Kemmy was a close friend of McManus's. Kemmy introduced the famous Irish [[tax amnesty]] onto the floor of Dáil Éireann.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In July 2012, McManus donated over €1&amp;nbsp;million to the Daughters of Charity foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.limerickleader.ie/community/community-news/latest-news/jp-donates-over-1m-to-daughters-of-charity-in-limerick-1-4105121|title=Profile: JP donates over €1m to Daughters of Charity in Limerick|publisher=Limerick Leader|accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He has donated land money and horses to the st Josephs Foundation to help build Liskennett Farm Equine Therapy Centre,Limerick for adults and children with autism.

== Gambling ==
McManus won millions{{clarify|date=June 2014}} from gamblers [[Terry Ramsden]] and the late Robert Sangster by laying horses.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} He says he "rarely bets" these days and when he does he usually describes them as "little bets".{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} He says betting is "not an obsession".{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} In 2012, he won $17.4m gambling in the United States, of which $5.2m was retained as [[income tax]] by the US [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS).&lt;ref name="it2543096"/&gt; In 2016, ''[[The Irish Times]]'' reported that he was seeking a refund of the tax on the basis of the US [[double taxation treaty]] with Ireland; the IRS stated that McManus was a self-confessed tax exile out of Ireland and therefore - despite McManus's sworn affidavits to the contrary  - not a [[legal resident]] of Ireland in 2012.&lt;ref name="it2543096"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/us-insists-jp-mcmanus-not-irish-resident-when-over-17m-won-1.2543096|title=US insists JP McManus not Irish resident when over $17m won|last=Keena|first=Colm|date=22 February 2016|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health ==
McManus was diagnosed with cancer in late 2008 and after receiving treatment in the United States, he is said to be recovering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Lavery – 24 April 2009 12:00 PM |url=http://www.herald.ie/national-news/jp-mcmanus-fights-cancer-in-us-clinic-1718899.html |title=JP McManus fights cancer in US clinic |publisher=Herald.ie |date=24 April 2009 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jacob Stepanovich Esipov''' ({{lang-ru|Яков Степанович Есипов}}), (date and place of birth are not known - died 1805, St. Petersburg, Russia), Russian inventor in the field of sugar beet industry. In 1799-1801 he was first to developed a technology for obtaining sugar from beets under industrial conditions in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.help-rus-student.ru/text/26/106.htm "Есипов Яков Степанович"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercialization==
In November 1802, J.S. Esipov built the first [[Sugar beet|beet sugar]] and alcohol distillery in Russia, in partnership with [[Yegor Ivanovich Blankennagel]] in the [[village of Alyabyevo]] ({{lang-ru|Алябьево}}) of the [[Chernovsky County]] ({{lang-ru|Чернский уезд}}) of the [[Tula Governorate]] ({{lang-ru|Тульская губерния}}). During 1802-1803 the factory produced 4.9 tons of raw sugar from beets harvested from 11 tithe of crops (1 tithe = 1.09 ha). The purity of raw sugar was approximately 85%. Waste of sugar production (molasses, etc.) was processed into ethyl alcohol. In 1807, the sugar-refining department was added to operation at the plant. For the first time in Russia J.S. Esipov introduced the purification of beet juice with lime. This method is still used at present time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://slovar.wikireading.ru/2456463 "slovar.wikireading"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landwirt.ru/2009-12-12-16-06-01/441 "History of sugar production"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fall of 1802 J.S. Esipov built the second, more advanced beet sugar plant with a sugar refining capabilities in the [[village of Nikolskoe]] ({{lang-ru|Никольское}}). In 1803-1804, it produced not only raw sugar, but also white sugar, alcohol, and liquor. The byproduct of manufacturing was used for animal feed. According to calculations by Mr. Esipov, the yield of raw sugar from beet was 3.1% of the beet mass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landwirt.ru/2009-12-12-16-06-01/441 "History of sugar production"]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the Founder Chairman of the [[CMA CGM|CMA CGM Group]], a French [[Containerization|container]] transportation and shipping company, third largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Alphaliner - TOP 100 - Existing fleet on February 2016|url = http://www.alphaliner.com/top100/index.php|website = www.alphaliner.com|access-date = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CMA-CGM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cma-cgm.com/AboutUs/Presentation/BoardOfDirectors.aspx|title=CMA CGM's Board Of Directors|publisher=CMA CGM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Jacques R. Saadé  was born on 7 February 1937 in [[Latakia, Syria|Latakia]], [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?client=ms-android-samsung&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=Jacques+Saadé+Né+lé+7+février+1937+à+Tripoli+(Liban)&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwik8_bx2u7bAhVH3aQKHQZsB1IQBQggKAA&amp;biw=412&amp;bih=652&amp;dpr=2.63]&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[London School of Economics]] in 1957 and took over the family business after the death of his father. His father had “established plants in [[Syria]], we were producing tobacco, cotton seed, olive oil, ice, etc.&lt;ref name="BORDET"&gt;{{cite news|last=BORDET|first=Marie|title=Jacques Saadé, confidences d'un tycoon des mers|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/economie/saade-confidences-d-un-tycoon-des-mers-06-06-2013-1683881_28.php|accessdate=6 June 2013|newspaper=Les Echos}}&lt;/ref&gt;”.

Based on his fathers advice, Saadé did an internship in New York to learn about shipping after his graduation. This is where he discovered the container (capacity: one cubic metre) used by the American army during the Vietnam war. In a [[Les Échos (newspaper)|Les Echos]] article, Saadé said: “''I thought the [[Intermodal container|container]] was an excellent idea for transporting goods as it was closed, easy and quick.''&lt;ref name="BORDET"/&gt;”

The 1978 War in Lebanon prompted him to move to [[Marseille]]. This is where he set up ''Compagnie maritime d’affrètement'' (CMA) with his brother Johnny on September 13 the same year. The company initially operated services between Marseille, Beirut and Syria. Saadé said: “''I wanted the sea. Marseille is beautiful and the sea looks a little like that in Beirut.''”&lt;ref name="BORDET" /&gt;

In the beginning there was family tension between Jacques Saadé and his brother Johnny. After difficult family disputes, Jacques Saadé took the helm alone.&lt;ref name="COSNARD"&gt;{{cite news|last=COSNARD|first=Denis|title=La revanche du patriarche des mers|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2013/06/01/cma-cgm-la-revanche-du-patriarche-des-mers_3422204_3234.html|accessdate=1 June 2013|newspaper=Le Monde}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Saadé made the decision to cross the [[Suez Canal]] and extended the company lines to [[Port Sultan Qaboos|Mina-Qaboos]] in the [[Gulf of Oman]]. Jacques Saadé was trying to prepare the company for the "Far East" to win a competitive advantage over other carriers.

In 1986, after noticing that volumes from Asia were constantly on the rise, he decided to extend CMA's shipping lines to Asia (including Japan). He later traveled to China himself  in 1992 to open the first regional office in [[Shanghai]], entrusting the management of the company's development in Asia to John Wang, a professor at the [[Shanghai Maritime University]].  

In 1996 Jacques Saadé acquired CGM (Compagnie Générale Maritime) following privatization.

Two years later in 1998  came acquisition by CMA of the [[Australian National Line|National Australian Line ANL]] and in the following year 1999 merger of CMA and CGM and creation of the CMA CGM Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = History {{!}} CMA CGM Group|url = http://www.cma-cgm.com/the-group/about-us/history|website = www.cma-cgm.com|access-date = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Saadé concludes the acquisition of [[Delmas (shipping company)|DELMAS]] and the CMA CGM Group becomes the third largest shipping Group in the world. Three additional acquisitions were made in 2007: Chinese Company Cheng Lie Navigation Ltd, U.S. Lines, and COMANAV.

At the height of the crisis in 2009, the shipping industry was badly affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Container Crisis: Shipping Industry Fights for Survival|url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/the-container-crisis-shipping-industry-fights-for-survival-a-641513.html|website = SPIEGEL ONLINE|access-date = 2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacques R. Saadé was opposed to breaking up the Group. Supported by his son Rodolphe Saadé, and daughter Tanya Saadé, he was convinced container transport sector would bounce back. In 2010, CMA CGM signed an agreement with the family-run industrial Turkish group YILDIRIM. The agreement enabled the Group to strengthen its financial structure and secure finance for its investment plans. This also later led him to invest, notably in building the Group’s first three 16,000 teu vessels:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Containers - CMA CGM confirms 16,000 teu upgrades for three ships on order - Lloyd's List|url = http://www.lloydslist.com/ll/sector/containers/article371281.ece|website = www.lloydslist.com|access-date = 2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[CMA CGM Marco Polo]], the [[CMA CGM Alexander von Humboldt|CMA CGM Alexander Von Humboldt]], and the [[:fr:CMA CGM Jules Verne|CMA CGM Jules Verne]].

In 2011, he built the Group’s headquarters in Marseille: the [[CMA CGM Tower]] designed by [[Zaha Hadid]], 147m in height with 33 floors. Today the CMA CGM Group is the city’s biggest employer (2,400 staff).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ville de Marseille - De Delmas à CMA CGM : Un dispositif innovant d’aide à la mobilité pour des salariés|url = http://www.marseille.fr/newslettereco/jsp/site/Portal.jsp?document_id=277&amp;portlet_id=20|website = www.marseille.fr|access-date = 2016-02-24|first = Ville de|last = Marseille}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, and for the first time since 1962, it was the President of the French Republic, [[François Hollande]], welcomed by Jacques Saadé, who inaugurated the CMA CGM Jules Verne, flagship of the CMA CGM fleet at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hollande inaugure le porte-conteneurs géant Jules Verne à Marseille|url = http://www.lefigaro.fr/societes/2013/06/04/20005-20130604ARTFIG00428-hollande-inaugure-le-porte-conteneurs-geant-jules-verne-a-marseille.php|website = Le Figaro|access-date = 2016-02-24|last = lefigaro.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Le porte-conteneurs géant|url = http://www.usinenouvelle.com/article/le-porte-conteneurs-geant-jules-verne-inaugure-a-marseille.N198286|website = usinenouvelle.com|date = 2013-06-04|access-date = 2016-02-24|language = fr-FR|first = L'Usine|last = Nouvelle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hollande in Marseille for launch of world's largest container ship|url = http://www.english.rfi.fr/asia-pacific/20130604-hollande-marseille-launch-worlds-largest-container-ship|website = RFI|access-date = 2016-02-24|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French President met Jacques Saadé again in 2015 for the inauguration of the CMA CGM Bougainville in [[Port of Le Havre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The CMA CGM BOUGAINVILLE inaugurated by French President François Hollande|url = https://www.ajot.com/news/the-cma-cgm-bougainville-inaugurated-by-french-president-francois-hollande|website = www.ajot.com|access-date = 2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Le Havre Nouvelle escale du géant CMA-CGM Bougainville, au Havre, dix jours après son inauguration|url = http://www.normandie-actu.fr/nouvelle-escale-du-geant-cma-cgm-bougainville-au-havre-dix-jours-apres-son-inauguration_161752/|website = Normandie-actu|access-date = 2016-02-24|language = fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Baptême au Havre pour le CMA CGM Bougainville|url = http://www.meretmarine.com/fr/content/bapteme-au-havre-pour-le-cma-cgm-bougainville|website = Mer et Marine|access-date = 2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Presidential christening for new CMA CGM flagship|url = http://www.seatrade-maritime.com/news/europe/presidential-christening-for-new-cma-cgm-flagship.html|website = www.seatrade-maritime.com|access-date = 2016-02-24|first = Bob|last = Jaques}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statements and actions regarding the environment ==
On the environment front, Jacques R. Saadé declared: ''"Our growth and a responsible attitude cannot be dissociated when facing the issues of our modern societies. CMA CGM must lead by example in terms of environmental protection, whether it be by acting against climate change or by preserving the maritime environment."'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Environment and sustainability {{!}} CMA CGM|url = https://www.cma-cgm.com/the-group/corporate-social-responsibility/environment|website = www.cma-cgm.com|access-date = 2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the reasons he was awarded the "Containerization International Lifetime Achievement Award" &lt;ref name="ci-awards.com"/&gt; was for ''"being one of the first lines to use innovative technologies as a means of helping reduce emissions, thereby reducing his company's impact on the environment."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CMA CGM founder Jacques Saade wins CI Lifetime Achievement Award|url = http://www.infinitycargo.com/index.php/en/services/104-news-and-events/news/530-cma-cgm-founder-jacques-saade-wins-ci-lifetime-achievement-award|website = www.infinitycargo.com|access-date = 2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He chose to equip his fleet with new large capacity vessels fitted with the latest green technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Welcome to the Port of Hamburg|url = http://www.hafen-hamburg.de/en/news/the-cma-cgm-georg-forster-2nd-of-the-group-s-18-000-teus-capacity-vessel-series-enters-the-cma-cgm-fleet---34173|website = The official website of the Port of Hamburg.|access-date = 2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CMA CGM Hails "Latest Environmental Technologies" on New Box Ship|url = http://shipandbunker.com/news/world/583270-cma-cgm-hails-latest-environmental-technologies-on-new-box-ship|website = Ship &amp; Bunker|access-date = 2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CMA CGM gets new environmental friendly vessel|url = http://www.green4sea.com/cma-cgm-gets-new-environmental-friendly-vessel/|website = GREEN4SEA|access-date = 2016-02-24|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CMA CGM’s biggest containership ever built in a Chinese shipyard - ShipInsight|url = https://www.shipinsight.com/cma-cgms-biggest-containership-ever-built-in-a-chinese-shipyard/|website = ShipInsight|access-date = 2016-02-24|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CMA CGM takes delivery of 18,000 TEU giant|url = http://www.marinelog.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=9494:cma-cgm-takes-delivery-of-18000-teu-giant&amp;Itemid=230|website = www.marinelog.com|access-date = 2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These vessels, combined with various other actions, allowed the group to reduce by 50% its carbon emissions per shipped container per km on its owned fleet between 2007 and 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Climate change and air quality {{!}} CMA CGM|url = http://www.cma-cgm.com/the-group/corporate-social-responsibility/environment/CO2-energy-efficiency|website = www.cma-cgm.com|access-date = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; confirming an objective set in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CMA CGM confirms objective to reduce CO2 by 50% - The Loadstar|url = http://theloadstar.co.uk/cma-cgm-group-confirms-objective-reduce-co2-emissions-50/|website = The Loadstar|access-date = 2016-02-24|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family business model ==
When writing an article about family capitalism, Aymeric Dewimille wrote: “''Loyally supported by his son Rodolphe, now Executive Officer in the Group, and his daughter Tanya, head of communications and on the Board of Directors, Jacques Saadé is totally committed to human values that traditionally underpin the governance of family-run companies... While the family-run company may not necessarily be called upon to save capitalism, one thing is proven, the family spirit can save companies.''”&lt;ref name="DEWIMILLE"&gt;{{cite news|last=DEWIMILLE|first=Aymeric|title=Le capitalisme familial, un modèle qui traverse les crises|url=http://lecercle.lesechos.fr/economie-societe/politique-eco-conjoncture/autres/221137144/capitalisme-familial-modele-traverse-cri|accessdate=25 August 2011|newspaper=Les Echos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CMA CGM attitude has garnered the attention of the Anglo-Saxon analysts at [[Lloyd's List|Lloyd’s List]]. In its 11 July 2011 edition, the British daily, a reference in the shipping industry, highlighted the fact that “''with the support of a solid family network, Jacques R. Saadé fought tooth and nail during the crisis, keeping the creditors at bay, juggling the order books and deployment of his fleet, and having the courage to reject several potential investors waiting for a partner that does not interfere in the way he runs the company''”.

However, according to these British analysts, his tenacity paid off – the CMA CGM Group has since returned to profit. The daily French financial newspaper [[Les Échos (newspaper)|Les Echos]] said:  “''Many observers thought CMA CGM would not recover from the losses suffered two years ago, while Jacques R. Saadé said he always knew his company would survive.''” &lt;ref name="DEWIMILLE"/&gt;

Inclined to vote for the family-run way of managing the business, the board is attracted by the boost to the portfolio that an IPO would bring about. The possibility has been alluded to officially, with the proviso that the Saadé family would keep control.&lt;ref name="COSNARD"/&gt;

'''Jay William Schulberg''' (July 17, 1939 &amp;ndash; January 12, 2005) was an American advertising executive who had chief creative positions at both [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather]] and [[Bozell|Bozell Worldwide]], with an approach to developing concise ads with memorable [[tagline]]s. He was responsible for creating many notable [[advertising slogan|advertising campaign]]s including the [[Got Milk?]] milk mustache campaign, the "[[Excedrin Headache]]" that could only be cured by the "extra-strength pain reliever", and the [[American Express]]" [[Don't Leave Home Without It]]" campaign with [[Karl Malden]] as spokesman.

==Biography==
Born in [[Manhattan]] on July 17, 1939, Schulberg attended [[New York University]], from which he graduated in 1961. He had originally planned to pursue a career as a screenwriter, following in the path of his cousin [[Budd Schulberg]], who had written the [[Academy Award]]-winning screenplay for ''[[On the Waterfront]]''.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Bayot, Jennifer. [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/14/business/media/14schulberg.html "Jay Schulberg Dies at 65; Creator of Milk Campaign"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 14, 2005. Accessed April 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advertising===
He was hired by [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather]] in 1961 as a junior [[copywriting|copywriter]]. In the 1970s, he used Karl Malden, then starring in the police drama ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]'', to deliver the line "Don't Leave Home Without It" to emphasize the safety of [[American Express]] [[traveler's cheque|traveler's checks]]. "A dry baby is a happy baby" was a line developed for [[Huggies]] diapers, used in ads with happy infants. &lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

Other campaigns pitched the "extra-strength pain reliever" as the cure for an "Excedrin headache" and used an older actor to introduce consumers to the "good old-fashioned lemonade" flavor of [[Country Time]] [[lemonade]]. Other clients at Ogilvy &amp; Mather included [[AT&amp;T]], [[Duracell]], [[The Hershey Company|Hershey's]], [[Maxwell House]] and ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

He was hired by Bozell in November 1987 as executive vice president, creative director.&lt;ref&gt;Dougherty, Philip H. [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/23/business/advertising-former-ogilvy-official-joining-bozell-jacobs.html "Advertising; Former Ogilvy Official Joining Bozell, Jacobs"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 23, 1987. Accessed April 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He developed a campaign for the National Milk Processors Board in 1994 featuring celebrities drinking milk, as part of an effort to increase milk consumption. The campaign, created by art director Bernie Hogya and copywriter Jennifer Gold, featured celebrity photographs by [[Annie Leibovitz]] of notables such as [[Lauren Bacall]] and [[Naomi Campbell]] with a milk mustache and the tagline "Milk. What a surprise!" The program next included men as well as women with milk above their lip, and the slogan "Where's your mustache?" and later, "[[Got milk?]]". Schulberg recounted his experiences in the 1998 [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' best-seller]] ''The Milk Mustache Book'', co-written with Bernie Hogya and Sal Taibi.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

After retiring in 1999, he worked as creative director of a $10 million public service campaign initiated in 2001 that promoted values such as determination, perseverance and selflessness, featuring everyday people as "the heroes all around us, whose stories are rarely told".

===Personal===
A longtime resident of [[Solebury Township, Pennsylvania]], Schulberg died at age 65 in [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania]] on January 12, 2005 due to [[pancreatic cancer]]. He was survived by his wife, Kathryn.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

Tetzchner holds a master's degree in computer science from the [[University of Oslo]].&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opera.com/company/executive/|title=About Opera, Executive team|accessdate=25 July 2014|publisher=Opera Software|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081214142807/http://www.opera.com/company/executive/|archivedate=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opera Software ==
Tetzchner worked at the [[Norway|Norwegian]] state phone company (now known as [[Telenor]]) from 1991 to 1995.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; There, he and [[Geir Ivarsøy]] developed browsing software called MultiTorg Opera. The project was abandoned by Telenor, but Ivarsøy and von Tetzchner obtained the rights to the software, formed a company named Opera Software in 1995 and continued working on the [[Opera (web browser)|Opera browser]].&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

On 21 April 2005, Tetzchner proclaimed at an internal meeting of Opera Software that if the download numbers of the browser's new version Opera 8 reached one million within four days, he would swim across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] from Norway to the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.operasoftware.com/press/releases/desktop/the-one-million-download-challenge-of-opera-8-opera-s-ceo-will-swim-from-norway-to-the-usa|title=The one million download challenge of Opera 8: Opera's CEO will swim from Norway to the USA|accessdate=25 July 2014|date=21 April 2005|publisher=Opera Software}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two days later, on the 23rd, the downloads reached 1,050,000 and Tetzchner had to fulfill his challenge.&lt;ref name="geek"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.geek.com/news/opera-ceo-fulfills-download-challenge-sort-of-559773/|title = Opera CEO fulfills Download Challenge … sort of|accessdate = 25 July 2014|date = 27 April 2005|publisher = Geek.com|last = Osborne|first = Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Opera site covered the swim and his quick failure.&lt;ref name="geek"/&gt;

Under his leadership, Jon took Opera into a global company with more than 750 employees in 13 countries. Opera was an early pioneer in mobile web browser and more than 350 million people use Opera to enjoy the web on their own terms.

In January 2010, Tetzchner stepped down as Chief Executive Officer of Opera Software, but he continued to serve Opera as a strategic adviser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.operasoftware.com/press/releases/general/opera-appoints-lars-boilesen-new-chief-executive-officer|title=Opera appoints Lars Boilesen new Chief Executive Officer|accessdate=25 July 2014|date=5 January 2010|publisher=Opera Software}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, Tetzchner announced that he was leaving Opera Software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.operasoftware.com/press/releases/general/jon-s.-von-tetzchner-is-leaving-opera-software|title=Jon S. von Tetzchner is leaving Opera Software|accessdate=25 July 2014|date=24 June 2011|publisher=Opera Software}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vivaldi Technologies ==
In December 2013, Tetzchner founded the company [[Vivaldi Technologies]] and launched the [[online community]] site vivaldi.net, which includes a forum, blogs, chat, photo sharing and a free email service named Vivaldi Mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/23/operas-former-ceo-launches-vivaldi-a-new-community-site-and-email-service/|title=Opera’s Former CEO Launches Vivaldi, A New Community Site And Email Service|last=Lardinois|first=Frederic|accessdate=25 July 2014|date=23 January 2014|publisher=Techcrunch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 January 2015, Vivaldi Technologies announced the release of its new web browser [[Vivaldi (web browser)|Vivaldi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/06/us-internet-vivaldi-idUSKBN0LA1JH20150206 | title=Vivaldi browser hits 500,000 downloads in first 10 days | work=[[Reuters]] | date=February 6, 2015 | last=Dagenborg | first=Joachim|accessdate=May 2, 2015|location=Oslo, Norway|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208202934/https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/06/us-internet-vivaldi-idUSKBN0LA1JH20150206|archivedate=8 February 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its 1.0 version came out in April 2016. Jon von Tetzchner and his team are making a personal and a feature-rich browser that takes into consideration the needs of every user. Vivaldi is self-funded and aims to be this way where the employees hold equity.

[[File:Sousedík.jpg|thumbnail|right|Josef Sousedík]]
'''Josef Sousedík''' (18 December 1894 – 15 December 1944) was [[Czech people|Czech]] inventor, industrialist and resistance fighter.&lt;ref name="vsetin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mestovsetin.cz/EN/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=100315&amp;id=1002&amp;p1=1001&amp;vol_stavzobrazeni=2 |title=Important personalities in Vsetín history |publisher=Vsetín official city website |author= |date=January 8, 2007 |accessdate=September 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Josef Sousedík grew up in a poor family in [[Vsetín]] in [[Czechoslovakia]]. After finishing elementary school he trained as an electrician. He fought in the [[Austria-Hungary]] army during [[World War I]] and participated in the [[Battle of Slovakia]] in 1918. He opened his own workshop in 1919,&lt;ref name="vsetin"/&gt; using his patents and inventions. The workshop expanded into a factory employing over 200 people by 1934.&lt;ref name="vsetin"/&gt; The factory went bankrupt in 1934 during the [[Great Depression]] and was bought by [[Tatra (company)|Ringhoffer-Tatra]], which employed Sousedík as a CEO.

He was twice elected mayor of [[Vsetín]] from 1927–1938.&lt;ref name="vsetin"/&gt;

Sousedík was an anti-Nazi resistance leader during [[World War II]], collaborating with the [[Clay Eva]] group and the [[1st Czechoslovak Partisan Brigade of Jan Žižka]]. He was arrested in 1944 and shot dead after a fight during an interrogation.&lt;ref name="vsetin"/&gt; Sousedík was decorated with the [[Czechoslovak War Cross 1939–1945|Czechoslovak War Cross]] ({{lang-cs|Válečný kříž}}) in memoriam by Czechoslovak president [[Edvard Beneš]].

The [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948–89)|Communist dictatorship]] suppressed recognition of Sousedík's acts due to his collaboration with Western states and factory ownership.&lt;ref name="vsetin"/&gt;

==Inventions and products==

Sousedík owned over 50 patents, mostly in the electrical field, such as an electrical rudder. His factory produced electrical parts for the [[ČSD Class M 290.0]] and for the [[Tatra T86]].

== Biography ==
=== Youth, education and early career ===
Charles Lee Galloway was born in [[Durand, Wisconsin]] in 1871, son of William D. Galloway and Ellen (Laskey) Galloway, natives respectively of Canada and England. He obtained his BSc at the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1896, his MA from [[Columbia University]] in 1900, and his PhD from the [[New York University]] in 1907.&lt;ref name="NCAB 1927"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WWA 1944"&gt;''Who's Who in America,''Vol. 23 1944-45. p. 745&lt;/ref&gt;

For his graduate work Galloway had spent some time in European Universities, and was visiting scholar with the British economic historian [[William Ashley (economic historian)|Sir William Ashley]] at the University of Birmingham, and with the German economist [[Johannes Conrad]] at the University of Halle.&lt;ref name="NCAB 1927"/&gt; 

After his graduation at the University of Minnesota in 1896, Galloway had started his working life as school teacher in Minnesota. From 1901 to 1905 he was assistant principal at a high school in Minneapolis and served as superintendent of city schools at [[South St. Paul, Minnesota|South St. Paul]] and [[Two Harbors, Minnesota|Two Harbors]].&lt;ref name="NCAB 1927"/&gt;

=== Further career in education and publishing ===
After his graduation at the New York University in 1907, Galloway joined their faculty.&lt;ref name="NCAB 1927"/&gt; By 1911 he was Assistant Professor of Commerce and Industry in the New York University School of Commerce, now [[New York University Stern School of Business]].&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Walter Kemmerer. ''The Economic Bulletin.'' Volume 3, 1911. p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918 he was appointed Professor of Commerce and Industry, and in 1919 head of its department of business management. In 1920 he founded and became director of the school of retailing financed by the leading department stores of New York City.&lt;ref name="NCAB 1927"/&gt; 

In 1912 Galloway had entered the publishing business. He became chairman of the board of The Ronald Press Company, and editor-in-chief. He was consulting editor for a series ''Department Store Merchandise Manuals'' at Ronald Press in 1917, editor of the ''Administration Magazine'' and member of the Advisory Council of the ''Journal of Business''.&lt;ref name="WWA 1944"/&gt;  

In 1912-13 Galloway and [[Frederick C. Henderschott]] had played a pioneering role in the establishing of [[The National Association of Corporation Schools]], where both continued to participate in executive roles.

=== Personal ===
Galloway married June 8, 1900 to Hetty G. Buehler, daughter of William G. Buehler of Minneapolis&lt;ref name="NCAB 1927"/&gt;. She had graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;''The Minnesota Alumni Weekly.'' Vol. XIII November 17, 1913 No. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

=== Management Department at New York University ===
The [[New York University]] in 1914 introduced its first course in [[industrial management]] in a new industrial engineering program. It introduced lesson in ''Factory Organization'' and in ''System  and Organization in Commercial Business,'' about the implications of [[scientific management]] for office and service activities. Nelson (1992) summarized. that in 1916 the New York University:

:"... created a Management department, headed by Lee Galloway, that taught a variety of management courses and a management seminar devoted to controversies over the application of scientific management. No university responded more quickly to the opportunities of the moment. In the following years NYU introduced more specialized courses on industrial and labor management in response to the demands of the swelling student population. Yet courses disappeared as fast as they appeared, faculty turnover was high, and there was no evidence that the swollen curriculum was more than a reaction to the uproar over scientific management and the labor problems of the war period."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Daniel. "Scientific management and the transformation of university business education." in: ''A Mental Revolution: Scientific Management since Taylor,'' Columbus, OH: Ohio State University Press 1992 (1992): 77-101. p. 93-94&lt;/ref&gt;

Galloway in 1921 published his standard work ''Office Management, Its Principles and Practice,''&lt;ref&gt;Harry Braverman. ''Labor and Monopoly Capital: The Degradation of Work in the Twentieth Century.'' 1998. p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; which would become a well-known book in [[office management]].&lt;ref&gt;Strom, Sharon H. ''Beyond the typewriter: gender, class, and the origins of modern American office work, 1900-1930.'' Vol. 118. University of Illinois Press, 1994. p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Movielink''' was a [[World Wide Web|web]]-based [[video on demand]] (VOD) and [[electronic sell-through]] (EST) service offering movies, TV shows and other videos for rental or purchase. Movielink drew its content offerings from the libraries of [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[Universal Studios]], [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Entertainment]], [[Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group|Buena Vista Pictures]] (including [[Miramax Films|Miramax]]), [[Twentieth Century Fox]], [[Koch Entertainment]] and others on a non-exclusive basis.  While it was only available to users in the United States, it was the first company in the world to offer legally downloadable movies from major studios.

In general, movies obtained through Movielink could only be viewed on the computer or a TV connected to the computer that the movie was purchased from.  However, consumer electronics devices such as the [[Xbox 360]] game console also allowed users to more easily view these digital media on a traditional TV screen.&lt;ref name="PC to TV"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.movielink.com/kb/user/article.jsf?id=4 |title=Movielink FAQ: How do I connect my PC to my TV? |accessdate=2007-08-10 |publisher=Movielink.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812033259/http://www.movielink.com/kb/user/article.jsf?id=4 |archivedate=August 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, Movielink had deals with certain set top box companies to offer its movies downloaded directly to people's TV's (including AT&amp;T's Homezone product).&lt;ref name="Homezone"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.movielink.com/store/web/help/watchOnTV.jsp |title=Movielink - Watch Movielink on Your TV! |accessdate=2007-08-10 |publisher=Movielink.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712030356/http://www.movielink.com/store/web/help/watchOnTV.jsp |archivedate=July 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Experimentation with other [[business model]]s was underway, including a feature which allowed users to purchase, download, and burn a DVD of a selected film.

==History==
Movielink was launched on November 11, 2002. Movielink used [[digital rights management]] software from [[Microsoft]] and [[RealNetworks]] to protect their content.  Consequently, compatibility was limited to [[Wintel|Intel-based computers]] running [[Microsoft Windows 2000]], [[Microsoft Windows XP|XP]],or [[Microsoft Windows Vista|Vista]] and [[Windows Media Player]] version 9 or later.&lt;ref name="Sys Req"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.movielink.com/kb/user/article.jsf?id=300007 |title=Movielink FAQ: What are the system requirements? |accessdate=2007-08-10 |publisher=Movielink.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016101903/http://movielink.com/kb/user/article.jsf?id=300007 |archivedate=October 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They offered daily weekday specials for under 99 cents, and certain films for half price every week.

On June 1, 2006, it was revealed that Movielink's initial investors—a joint venture of Paramount, Sony, MGM, Universal, and Warner Bros—were looking to sell the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/may2006/tc20060531_484649.htm?campaign_id=rss_tech |title=Bloomberg Business |work=Bloomberg.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625083655/http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/may2006/tc20060531_484649.htm?campaign_id=rss_tech |archivedate=2006-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This came shortly after numerous studios announced their intent to work with a range of potential Movielink competitors, such as [[Amazon.com]], [[Apple Computer]], [[BitTorrent Inc.]], [[Jaman]] and [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox]].

On August 8, 2007, Blockbuster purchased Movielink.  According to the 8-K filing by Blockbuster, the total purchase price was $6.6 million. The deal included content agreements thus giving Blockbuster access to one of the largest libraries of downloadable movies.  With the acquisition of Movielink, Blockbuster was positioned for media content delivery in [[brick and mortar]] rentals, [[DVD-by-mail]], and online delivery of movies.&lt;ref name="Blockbuster acquisition"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/070809/mvw073.html?.v=1|title=Press Release: MultiVu Video Feed: Blockbuster Inc.

On December 16, 2008, the Movielink website was shut down. The site was re-directed to the [[Blockbuster Inc.|Blockbuster]] [[home page]]. Customers were notified 30 days in advance that all movies rented or purchased prior to the shutdown date must be downloaded by no later than 12/15/08 11:59 P.M. Pacific Time.

In addition to its headquarters in Perm, PROGNOZ has offices in [[Beijing]], [[Brussels]], [[Moscow]], and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].&lt;ref name="idc-cema.com"/&gt;    The company name derives from the Russian word for “forecast.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.rususa.com/dictionary/russian.asp|title = www.rususa.com/dictionary/russian.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

PROGNOZ was founded as the result of a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era collaboration between the Russian Academy of Science and the Ministry of the Economy.  In 1987, a team of economists and scientists from the Academy’s Institute of Economics gathered at Perm State University to conduct a series of economic forecasting projects for the Ministry.  Four years later, after the establishment of the Russian Federation opened the national economy, one of these economists, Dmitry L. Andrianov, founded PROGNOZ to address the need for business software that analyzed and forecast economic information.  (Andrianov continues to serve as PROGNOZ’s CEO today).  A year later, in 1992, PROGNOZ introduced the PROGNOZ Analytical Suite, a software application for statistical analysis and econometric modeling, and a predecessor to the PROGNOZ 5 Platform.  In 2001, PROGNOZ expanded its operations from Perm and opened an office in Moscow.  This expansion continued in 2006 with offices in Beijing, Philadelphia, Washington DC, Kiev and other locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.prognoz.com|title = www.prognoz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first job in the field of quality was that of test technician in the quality department at [[Powel Crosley, Jr.|Crosley Corporation]] in [[Richmond, Indiana]] beginning in 1952.  He left for a better-paying position as [[Reliability engineering|reliability engineer]] at [[Bendix Corporation]] in [[Mishawaka, Indiana]] in 1955, working on the [[RIM-8 Talos]] missile.  He left after less than two years to become senior quality engineer at [[Glenn L. Martin Company|The Martin Company]]'s new [[Orlando, Florida]] organization to develop the [[Pershing missile]].  There he developed the [[Zero Defects]] concept.&lt;ref name="Harwood"&gt;{{cite book | last = Harwood | first = William B. | title = Raise Heaven and Earth: The Story of Martin Marietta People and Their Pioneering Achievements | year = 1993 | publisher = [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | location = [[New York City|New York]] | isbn = 9780671749989 | oclc = 28710737 | page = 350 | chapter = 27: "Zero Defects" Was Invented Here | quote = Zero Defects was the brainchild of a gifted and articulate young engineer named Philip Crosby, who conceived it while working as quality control manager on Pershing.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He eventually rose to become department head before leaving for [[ITT Corporation]] in 1965 to become director of quality.

==Philip Crosby Associates==
In 1979, Crosby started the [[management consulting]] company Philip Crosby Associates, Inc.&lt;ref name="PCA"/&gt; This consulting group provided educational courses in quality management both at their headquarters in [[Winter Park, Florida]], and at eight foreign locations. Also in 1979, Crosby published his first business book, ''Quality Is Free''. This book would become popular at the time because of the crisis in North American quality. During the late 1970s and into the 1980s, North American manufacturers were losing market share to Japanese products largely due to the superior quality of the Japanese goods.

Crosby's response to the quality crisis was the principle of  ''"doing it right the first time"'' (DIRFT).  He also included four major principles:&lt;ref name="Creech"&gt;{{cite book | last = Creech | first = Bill | authorlink = Wilbur L.

:#''The definition of quality is conformance to requirements (requirements meaning both the product and the customer's requirements)
:#''The system of quality is prevention
:#''The performance standard is [[zero defects]] (relative to requirements)
:#''The measurement of quality is the [[Quality costs|price of nonconformance]]

His belief was that an organization that establishes good quality management principles will see savings returns that more than pay for the cost of the quality system: "quality is free". It is less expensive to do it right the first time than to pay for rework and repairs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10957">The '''Reciprocal Tariff Act''' (enacted June 12, 1934, ch. 474, {{USStat|48|943}}, {{usc|19|1351}}) provided for the negotiation of [[tariff]] agreements between the United States and separate nations,  particularly [[Latin America]]n countries.&lt;ref&gt;"The Institutional Roots of American Trade Policy: Politics, Coalitions, and International Trade." Michael Bailey, Judith Goldstein, and Barry Weingast. World Politics, Volume 49, No. 3, 1997."&lt;/ref&gt; The Act served as an institutional reform intended to authorize the president to negotiate with foreign nations to reduce tariffs in return for reciprocal reductions in tariffs in the United States. It resulted in a reduction of duties.

== Reciprocal Tariff Act of 1934 ==

President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act (RTAA) into law in 1934.  RTAA gave the president power to negotiate bilateral, [[Trade pact|reciprocal trade agreement]]s with other countries.  This law enabled Roosevelt to liberalize [[Trade policy of the United States|American trade policy]] around the globe.  It is widely credited with ushering in the era of liberal [[trade policy]] that persisted through the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Hiscox"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hiscox|first=Michael J.|title=The Magic Bullet? The RTAA, Institutional Reform, and Trade Liberalization|journal=International Organization|date=Autumn 1999|volume=53|issue=4|pages=669–98|doi=10.1162/002081899551039|url=http://web.stanford.edu/class/polisci243b/readings/v0002090.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tariff]]s in the United States were at historically high levels from the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] period through the 1920s.  In response to the [[Great Depression]], [[United States Congress|Congress]] accelerated its protectionist policies, culminating in the [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act|Smoot–Hawley Act of 1930]].  The Smoot-Hawley Act was a smorgasbord of high tariffs across many American industries.  At the same time, countries in Europe enacted protectionist policies. The RTAA marked a sharp departure from the era of [[protectionism]] in the United States.  American duties on foreign products declined from an average of 46% in 1934 to 12% by 1962.&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=Michael A.|author2=Goldstein, Weingast |title=The Institutional Roots of American Trade Policy|journal=World Politics|date=April 1997|volume=49|pages=309–38|doi=10.1353/wp.1997.0007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== How the RTAA was different from other trade agreements ===
Before the RTAA, if Congress wanted to establish a lower tariff for particular [[import]]s, it would act unilaterally, taking the foreign country's tariff rate as fixed. Congress would choose a tariff rate that was either a little higher or lower than the median preferred tariff, depending upon the composition of the Congress.  Generally, a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] controlled Congress would prefer higher tariffs and a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] controlled Congress would prefer lower tariffs.  Thus, tariffs were chosen based on the [[domestic politics]] of the United States.  Individual members of Congress were under great pressure from industry [[lobbyist]]s to raise tariffs to protect them from the negative effects of foreign imports.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;   
	
The RTAA’s novel approach freed Roosevelt and Congress to break this trend of tariff increases.  First, it tied tariff reductions by the United States to reciprocal tariff reductions with international partners. It also allowed Congress to approve the tariffs with a [[majority|simple majority]], as opposed to the requisite [[two-thirds majority]] necessary for other treaties.  Lastly, the president had the authority to negotiate the terms.  These three innovations in trade policy created the political will and feasibility to enact a more liberal American trade policy.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt; 
	
[[Reciprocity (international relations)|Reciprocity]] was an important tenet of the [[trade agreement]]s brokered under RTAA because it gave Congress more of an incentive to lower tariffs.  As more foreign countries entered into bilateral tariff reduction deals with the United States, American exporters had more incentive to lobby Congress for even lower tariffs across many industries.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt; 
	
By giving the President the authority to negotiate these deals, the Congress effectively ceded a part of their power (authorized under US Constitution, Article I, Section VIII) to the executive branch.  The President had to consider the aggregate welfare of all Americans, his [[foreign policy]] priorities, and what was feasible with other countries in making his decisions on tariffs. These considerations generally left presidents more inclined to reduce tariffs than the Congress.&lt;ref name="Alt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alt|first=James E.|author2=Gilligan, Michael |title=The Political Economy of Trading States: Factor Specificity, Collective Action Problems and Domestic Political Institutions|journal=The Journal of Political Philosophy|year=1994|volume=2|issue=2|pages=165–92|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9760.1994.tb00020.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Whether Roosevelt or Congress foresaw this result is a matter of historical debate.

=== The historical partisan divide over tariffs and the RTAA ===
After the Civil War, Democrats were generally the party of [[trade liberalization]], while Republicans were generally for higher tariffs. This pattern was clear in congressional votes for tariffs from 1860 until 1930. Democrats were the congressional minority in the majority of Congresses between the Civil War and the election of Roosevelt. During their brief stints in the majority, Democrats passed several tariff reduction bills. Examples include the [[Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act|Wilson–Gorman Act of 1894]] and the [[Revenue Act of 1913|Underwood Tariff Act of 1913]]. However, subsequent Republican majorities always undid these unilateral tariff reductions.&lt;ref name="Hiscox"/&gt; 
	
By the Great Depression, tariffs were at historic highs. Members of Congress commonly entered in informal ''[[quid pro quo]]'' agreements where they voted for other members’ preferred tariffs in order to secure support for their own. At no point did anyone take into account the aggregate toll on American [[consumer]]s or [[exporter]]s. This practice is commonly referred to as [[logrolling]]. President Roosevelt and key members of his administration were intent on stopping this practice.&lt;ref name="Alt"/&gt;  
	
Though Democrats voted for trade liberalization far more often than Republicans, they were not uniform in their preferences. Democrats skeptical of reducing tariffs during the Depression included Representative [[Henry Rainey]] (D-IL) and members of Roosevelt’s own administration – [[Rexford Tugwell]], [[Raymond Moley]] and [[Adolf Berle]]. However, the administration decided to take advantage of having a Democratic-controlled Congress and Presidency to push through the RTAA. In 1936 and 1940, the Republican Party ran on a platform of repealing the tariff reductions secured under the RTAA. But when they won back Congress in 1946, they did not act to remove the tariffs. In the years since the enactment of the RTAA in 1934, the economies of Europe and [[East Asia]] had been decimated by the violence of [[World War II]]. This left a huge global production vacuum that was filled by American exporters.&lt;ref name="Hiscox"/&gt; In the World War II period, the United States had its highest positive account balance in its history. Republican preferences for tariffs started shifting as exporters from their home districts began to benefit from increased [[international trade]]. By the 1950s, there was no statistically significant difference between Republicans and Democrats on tariff policies. This change has endured to the present day.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;

=== The durability of the RTAA ===

Another key feature of the RTAA was the fact that if Congress wanted to repeal a tariff reduction, it would take a two-thirds [[supermajority]]. That means that the tariff would have to be especially onerous and that the Congress would have to be especially protectionist. Once enacted, tariff reductions tended to stick.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt; 
	
As more American [[Industry|industries]] began to benefit from tariff reductions, some of them began to lobby Congress for lower tariffs. Prior to RTAA, Congress was mostly lobbied by industries seeking to create or increase tariffs to protect their industry. This change also helped to lock in many of the gains in trade liberalization. In short, the political [[incentive]] to raise tariffs decreased while the political incentive to lower tariffs increased.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;

=== How RTAA changed the world ===
As American duties dropped off dramatically, global markets also increasingly liberalized. World trade expanded at a rapid pace. The RTAA, though a law of the United States, provided the first widespread system of guidelines for bilateral trade agreements. The United States and the European nations began avoiding [[beggar thy neighbour]] policies (which pursued national trade objectives at the expense of other nations). Instead, countries started to realize the gains from trade cooperation.
	
Led by the United States and the United Kingdom, international cooperation flourished and concrete institutions were created. In talks begun at the [[Bretton Woods Conference]] of 1944, the [[International Monetary Fund]] was created. By 1949, the first international board governing trade, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) was established. In 1994, GATT was replaced with the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), which oversees international trade agreements today.&lt;ref name="Oatley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Oatley|first=Thomas|title=International Political Economy|year=2010|pages=71–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruggie|first=John Gerard|title=International regimes, transactions, and change: embedded liberalism in the postwar economic order|journal=International Organization|date=Spring 1982|volume=36|series=2|pages=379–415|doi=10.1017/s0020818300018993}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
The [[United States Department of State]] also found good use of the expansion of [[free trade]] after [[World War II]]. Many in the State Department saw multilateral trade agreements as a way to engage the world in accordance with the [[Marshall Plan]] and the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. US trade policy became an integral part of [[United States foreign policy|US foreign policy]]. This pursuit of free-trade-cum-[[diplomacy]] intensified during the [[Cold War]], as the United States competed with the [[Soviet Union]] for relationships around the globe.&lt;ref name="Oatley"/&gt;

'''Retail outsourcing''' is a form of [[business process outsourcing]] practiced in retail, logistic and restaurant business. It involves the contracting of the operations and responsibilities of transportation, cooking, customer servicing or settlement of accounts business processes to a third-party service provider. Such provider bears the ultimate responsibility for the proper execution of the designated functions at stores, warehouses or catering facilities. The service supplier carries out the internal (back office) and front office duties including [[Recruitment|recruiting]], training and legalizing human resources, tracking their job conduct, reporting and solving the problems, performing daily production tasks. Retail outsourcing is typically contracted for operational segments requiring large amounts of unskilled work force in such spheres as shipment, cash desk processing, counter servicing, bread baking, meat and fish cutting, cleaning, dish washing, packing, boxing or bundling.

Initially, the concept of retail outsourcing has been conceived in Russia. It has fully matured by the end of the 2000s. Currently, retail outsourcing is practiced by all major Russian retailers. It accounts for more than 25% of their total business operations. Even the abolition of the [[Contingent_work|contingent]] labor (2016) failed to impact these services significantly. It only put a ban on specific segments (primarily, cash desk processing) but left other parts almost intact.

'''Subordination''' in [[banking]] and [[finance]] refers to the order of priorities in claims for [[ownership]] or interest in various [[assets]].

==United States law==
===Subordination of debt===
'''Subordination''' is the process by which a creditor is placed in a lower priority for the collection of its debt from its debtor's assets than the priority the creditor previously had,&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]], 4th Ed. 1951, defining "subordinate."&lt;/ref&gt; In common parlance, the debt is said to be subordinated but in reality, it is the right of the creditor to collect the debt that has been reduced in priority. The priority of right to collect the debt is important when a debtor owes more than one creditor but has assets of insufficient value to pay them all in full at the time of a default. Except in [[bankruptcy]] proceedings, the creditor with the first priority for collection will generally have the first claim on the debtor's assets for its debt and the creditors whose rights are subordinate will thus have fewer assets to satisfy their claims. Subordination can take place by operation of law or by agreement among the creditors.

===Subordination of security priority===
Subordination is also an issue in the priority of [[security interest]]s in the ownership of property.  For example, in [[real estate]], [[mortgages]] and other [[liens]] on the title to secure the payment or repayment of money usually take their priority from the time they attach to the title.  The purpose of this ordering of priority is to determine, in a [[foreclosure]] resulting from a default, who gets paid first with the sale proceeds from the foreclosure proceeding.  Earlier mortgages or other liens are often subordinated by their holders to later ones in order to accomplish agreed-upon ends.  An example is for the holder of a mortgage on undeveloped land to subordinate that mortgage to a later construction loan mortgage.  The motivation is either the belief that improvement of the land will benefit the first lender or that the first mortgage requires that it be subordinated to a future construction loan.

The ''subordination percentage'' of a security is the percentage of the total capital which is subordinate to the security in question.  Thus, the security will not suffer any losses until after that percentage of capital has been lost.

====Dealer subordinable debt====
In the automotive financing industry, many dealerships are allowed to designate personal loans which are payable to the ownership as subordinable debt. The finance institution and dealership may come to an agreement which allows this debt to stay within the confines of the financial statement and concurrently improve the dealership financial position from a liquidity perspective.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

===Equitable subordination===
[[United States bankruptcy court|Bankruptcy courts in the United States]] have the power and authority to subordinate prior claims on the assets of a bankrupt debtor to the claims of junior claimants based on principles of equity.  This is a remedy called "equitable subordination."&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|11|510}}(c)&lt;/ref&gt; The basis for subordination is usually the inequitable conduct of the prior claimant with respect to junior claimants.&lt;ref&gt; See, e.g., ''Murphy v. Meritor Savings Bank'', [[Case citation|126 B.R. 370, 393, 413]] ([[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|Bankr. D. Mass.]] 1991), in which an [[Leveraged buyout|LBO]] left the corporation with insufficient cash to operate for longer than 10 days.  In that case, the court not only avoided the mortgage securing the LBO debt, but it also subordinated the resulting lender's unsecured claim to the claims of all other creditors of the bankrupt debtor.&lt;/ref&gt;  Equitable subordination can be used to subordinate both secured and unsecured claims.

He often goes to training boxing at Yontarakit, the famous boxing gym at that time, located near his native. He competed in the [[Thailand National Games]] and won a gold medal in [[Bantamweight]] (118 lb) division. After that, he turned professional boxing and won by [[knocked out]] every consecutive six times at [[Lumpinee Stadium]],&lt;ref name="หนึ่ง"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siamsport.co.th/boxing/other/view/21842|title=1 เดียวในโลก ดรีมทีม...พิสิฐวุฒินันท์|date=August 30, 2017|accessdate=November 3, 2017|work=Siamsport|language=thai}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was a boxing partner for [[Venice Borkhorsor]], a [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] &amp; [[The Ring Magazine|The Ring]] [[Flyweight]] (112 lb) world title holder. He is considered a boxer who is good enough to be a world champion.&lt;ref name="เสี่ย"/&gt;

But his father did not like it for fear that he will be traumatized. When he was 18 years old, his father sent him to be a cinema manager in [[Chachoengsao province]]. But he still does not leave the boxing. He continued to visit the boxing match and catching up with the news feed in the boxing circles often.&lt;ref name="ป๊อป"/&gt;

After the match, the victory was Román. He brought his eldest son, "Pop" Chokchai, to sit on Román's lap and take a photo together. He often takes him to visit the boxing match often, he has a dream Chokchai in the future will be the first Thai boxer to win the [[Summer Olympic Games]] gold medal. He instilled a love of boxing for all his children.&lt;ref name="ป๊อป"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD3-wVs4xWw|title=เบรก 1 คนเป็นข่าว ออน 16 01 57 ค่ายมวยนครหลวงโปรโมชั่่น|language=thai|date=January 17, 2017|accessdate=November 3, 2017|work=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tourism''' is [[travel]] for pleasure or business; also the theory and practice of touring, the business of attracting, accommodating, and entertaining tourists, and the business of operating tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|tourism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourism may be international, or within the traveller's country. The [[World Tourism Organization]] defines tourism more generally, in terms which go "beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only", as people "traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours, business and other purposes".&lt;ref name="unwto1034"&gt;{{cite web|year=1995 |url=http://pub.unwto.org/WebRoot/Store/Shops/Infoshop/Products/1034/1034-1.pdf |title=UNWTO technical manual: Collection of Tourism Expenditure Statistics |page=10 |publisher=World Tourism Organization |access-date=26 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922120940/http://pub.unwto.org/WebRoot/Store/Shops/Infoshop/Products/1034/1034-1.pdf |archivedate=22 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism can be domestic or international, and international tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country's [[balance of payments]]. Today, tourism is a major source of income for many countries, and affects the economy of both the source and host countries, in some cases being of vital importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journal.georgetown.edu/the-growing-importance-of-tourism-in-the-global-economy-and-international-affairs/|title=The Growing Importance of Tourism in the Global Economy and International Affairs {{!}}|website=journal.georgetown.edu|language=en-US|access-date=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism suffered as a result of a strong economic slowdown of the [[late-2000s recession]], between the second half of 2008 and the end of 2009, and the outbreak of the [[2009 flu pandemic|H1N1 influenza virus]],&lt;ref name=Barom2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=WTOaugust10/&gt; but slowly recovered. International tourism receipts (the travel item in the [[balance of payments]]) grew to {{USD|1.03}} trillion ({{euro|740}} billion) in 2011, corresponding to an increase in [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real terms]] of 3.8% from 2010.&lt;ref name="pr12027"/&gt; International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012,&lt;ref name=Barom2012/&gt; [[emerging markets]] such as [[China]], [[Russia]], and [[Brazil]] had significantly increased their spending over the previous decade.&lt;ref name="Barom201304"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.unwto.org/en/press-release/2013-04-04/china-new-number-one-tourism-source-market-world |title=China – the new number one tourism source market in the world|publisher=[[World Tourism Organization]]|date=4 April 2013|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ITB Berlin]] is the world's leading tourism [[trade fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITB Berlin: The World's Leading Travel Trade Show|url=http://www.expodatabase.com/tradeshow/itb-berlin-the-worlds-leading-travel-trade-show-908.html|website=www.expodatabase.com|publisher=M+A Expo Database|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global tourism accounts for ca. 8% of global [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref&gt;Lenzen et al.

==Etymology==
[[File:Vysoké Tatry r.1922.jpg|thumb|1922 postcard of tourists in the [[High Tatras]], [[Slovakia]].]]

The word ''tourist'' was used in 1772&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Griffiths|first1=Ralph|authorlink1=Ralph Griffiths|author2=Griffiths, G. E. |title=Pennant's Tour in Scotland in 1769|journal=[[Monthly Review (London)|The Monthly Review, Or, Literary Journal]]|year=1772|volume=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xS8oAAAAYAAJ&amp;vq=tourist&amp;dq=tourist&amp;pg=PA150|accessdate=23 December 2011|location=London|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''tourism'' in 1811.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=tour&amp;searchmode=none|title=tour (n.)|first1=Douglas|last1=Harper|authorlink1=Douglas Harper|work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is formed from the word ''tour'', which is derived from Old English ''turian'', from Old French ''torner'', from Latin ''tornare''; 'to turn on a lathe,' which is itself from Ancient Greek ''tornos'' (τόρνος); 'lathe'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=turn&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=etymonline.com|access-date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance of tourism==

Not only does the service sector grow thanks to tourism, but also local [[Craft|manufacturers]] (like those producing the strandkorb chairs), [[retail]]ers, the [[Real estate development|real-estate sector]] and the general [[City marketing|image of a location]] can benefit.]]

Tourism has become an important, even vital, source of income for many regions and even entire countries. The ''Manila Declaration on World Tourism of 1980'' recognized its importance as "an activity essential to the life of nations because of its direct effects on the social, cultural, educational, and economic sectors of national societies and on their international relations."&lt;ref name="unwto1034"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url= http://www.univeur.org/cuebc/downloads/PDF%20carte/65.%20Manila.PDF |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121120180003/http://www.univeur.org/CMS/UserFiles/65.%20Manila.PDF |archivedate= 20 November 2012 |title=  Manila Declaration on World Tourism |date= 10 October 1980|pages= 1–4|location= [[Manila]], [[Philippines]] |conference= World Tourism Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism brings large amounts of income into a local economy in the form of payment for [[goods and services]] needed by tourists, accounting {{as of | 2011 | lc = on}} for 30% of the world's [[trade]] in services, and for 6% of overall [[export]]s of goods and services.&lt;ref name="pr12027"/&gt; It also generates opportunities for [[employment]] in the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service sector of the economy]] associated with tourism.&lt;ref name="WTO2012Highlights"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://mkt.unwto.org/sites/all/files/docpdf/unwtohighlights12enlr_1.pdf |title= 2012 Tourism Highlights |publisher= UNWTO |accessdate= 17 June 2012 |date= June 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120709215809/http://mkt.unwto.org/sites/all/files/docpdf/unwtohighlights12enlr_1.pdf |archivedate= 9 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hospitality industries which benefit from tourism include [[transport |transportation services]] (such as [[airline]]s, [[cruise ship]]s, [[train]]s and [[taxicab]]s); [[hospitality service]]s (such as [[lodging|accommodations]], including [[hotel]]s and [[resort]]s); and entertainment venues (such as [[amusement park]]s, [[restaurant]]s, [[casino]]s, [[shopping mall]]s, [[music venue]]s, and [[theatre|theaters]]). This is in addition to goods bought by tourists, including [[souvenir]]s.

On the flip-side, tourism can degrade people and sour relationships between host and guest.&lt;ref&gt;

==Definitions==
In 1936, the [[League of Nations]] defined a ''foreign tourist'' as "someone traveling abroad for at least twenty-four hours". Its successor, the [[United Nations]], amended this definition in 1945, by including a maximum stay of six months.&lt;ref name="theobald"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9dvK2ajv7zIC&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=league%20of%20nations%20tourism%201936&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q=league%20of%20nations%20tourism%201936|title=Global Tourism|last=Theobald|first=William F.|publisher=[[Butterworth–Heinemann]]|year=1998|isbn=978-0-7506-4022-0|edition= 2nd|location=Oxford [England]|pages=6–7|oclc=40330075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Hunziker and Kraft defined tourism as "the sum of the phenomena and relationships arising from the travel and stay of non-residents, insofar as they do not lead to [[Permanent residency|permanent residence]] and are not connected with any earning activity."&lt;ref name="1941define"&gt;{{cite book|title=Grundriß Der Allgemeinen Fremdenverkehrslehre|last1=Hunziker |first1=W|authorlink1=Walter Hunziker|last2=Krapf|first2=K|oclc=180109383|publisher=Polygr.

It includes movements for all purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beaver|first=Allan|title=A Dictionary of Travel and Tourism Terminology|year=2002|publisher=CAB International|isbn=978-0-85199-582-3|page=313|location=Wallingford |oclc=301675778}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, the International Association of Scientific Experts in Tourism defined tourism in terms of particular activities chosen and undertaken outside the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The AIEST, its character and aims|url=http://www.aiest.org/org/idt/idt_aiest.nsf/en/index.html|author=International Association of Scientific Experts in Tourism|accessdate=29 March 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126143828/http://www.aiest.org/org/idt/idt_aiest.nsf/en/index.html|archivedate=26 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the [[United Nations]] identified three forms of tourism in its ''Recommendations on Tourism Statistics'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=1994|title=Recommendations on Tourism Statistics|url=https://unstats.un.org/unsd/newsletter/unsd_workshops/tourism/st_esa_stat_ser_M_83.pdf|journal=|series=M|location=New York|volume=|issue=83|page=5|pages=|work=Statistical Papers|accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Domestic tourism, involving residents of the given country traveling only within this country
* Inbound tourism, involving non-residents traveling in the given country
* Outbound tourism, involving residents traveling in another country

The terms ''tourism'' and ''travel'' are sometimes used interchangeably. In this context, travel has a similar definition to tourism, but implies a more purposeful journey. The terms ''tourism'' and ''tourist'' are sometimes used pejoratively, to imply a shallow interest in the cultures or locations visited. By contrast, ''traveler'' is often used as a sign of distinction. The sociology of tourism has studied the cultural values underpinning these distinctions and their implications for class relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Tourists_at_the_Taj.html?id=YjLxR2H-YCYC|title=Tourists at the Taj: Performance and Meaning at a Symbolic Site|last=Edensor|first=Tim|date=1 January 1998|publisher=Psychology Press|year=|isbn=9780415167123|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International tourist arrivals reached 1.035 billion in 2012, up from over 996 million in 2011, and 952 million in 2010.&lt;ref name="Barom2012"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/pdf/unwto_barom13_01_jan_excerpt_0.pdf |title=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer |journal=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer |date=January 2013 |volume=11 |issue=1 |accessdate=9 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228162347/http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/pdf/unwto_barom13_01_jan_excerpt_0.pdf |archivedate=28 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 and 2012, international [[Travel behavior|travel demand]] continued to recover from the losses resulting from the [[late-2000s recession]], where tourism suffered a strong slowdown from the second half of 2008 through the end of 2009.

===Antiquity===
{{see also|Travel literature}}
Travel outside a person's local area for leisure was largely confined to wealthy classes, who at times traveled to distant parts of the world, to see great buildings and works of art, [[multilingualism|learn new languages]], experience new cultures, and to taste different [[cuisine]]s. As early as [[Shulgi]], however, kings praised themselves for protecting roads and building way stations for travelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HFWjoeVCLk0C|title=Introduction To Tourism|last=Jayapalan|first=N.|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist|isbn=9788171569779|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Travelling for pleasure can be seen in [[Egypt]] as early on as 1500 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Casson|first1=Lionel|title=Travel in the Ancient World|date=1994|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Roman Republic]], [[spa]]s and coastal resorts such as [[Baiae]] were popular among the rich. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] wrote his ''Description of Greece'' in the 2nd century AD. In [[ancient China]], nobles sometimes made a point of visiting [[Mount Tai]] and, on occasion, all [[five Sacred Mountains]].

===Middle Ages===
By the [[Middle Ages]], [[Christian pilgrimage|Christianity]] and [[Buddhist pilgrimage|Buddhism]] had traditions of [[pilgrimage]]. [[Chaucer]]'s [[Canterbury Tales]] and [[Wu Cheng'en]]'s ''[[Journey to the West]]'' remain classics of [[English literature|English]] and [[Chinese literature]].

The 10th- to 13th-century [[Song dynasty]] also saw secular [[travel literature|travel writers]] such as [[Su Shi]] (11th century) and [[Fan Chengda]] (12th century) become popular in [[China]]. Under the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]], [[Xu Xiake]] continued the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Hargett, James. "Some Preliminary Remarks on the Travel Records of the Song Dynasty (960-1279)" in ''Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews'', {{nowrap|Vol. 7}}, {{nowrap|No. 1/2}}, {{nowrap|pp. 67–93}}. 1985. {{doi|10.2307/495194}}. {{JSTOR|495194}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[medieval Italy]], [[Francesco Petrarch]] also wrote an allegorical account of his 1336 ascent of [[Mount Ventoux]] that praised the act of traveling and criticized ''frigida incuriositas'' ("cold lack of curiosity"). The [[Duke of Burgundy|Burgundian]] poet {{Interlanguage link multi|Michault Taillevent|fr}} later composed his own horrified recollections of a 1430 trip through the [[Jura Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7yqsIYSNmLMC&amp;pg=PA32 | title=Un poète bourguignon du XVe siècle, Michault Taillevent: édition et étude | publisher=Librairie Droz |author1=Deschaux, Robert |author2=Taillevent, Michault | year=1975 | pages=31–32| isbn=9782600028318 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grand Tour===
[[File:Willem van Haecht Władysław Vasa.JPG|thumb|Prince Ladislaus Sigismund of Poland visiting Gallery of [[Cornelis van der Geest]] in [[Brussels]] in 1624.]]
{{See also|Grand Tour}}
Modern tourism can be traced to what was known as the [[Grand Tour]], which was a traditional trip around [[Europe]] (especially [[Germany]] and [[Italy]]), undertaken by mainly [[Upper class|upper-class]] European young men of means, mainly from Western and Northern European countries. In 1624, young Prince of [[Poland]], [[Władysław IV Vasa|Ladislaus Sigismund Vasa]], the eldest son and heir of [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund III]], embarked for a journey across Europe, as was in [[Norm (sociology)|custom]] among Polish nobility.&lt;ref name="wladcy12b"&gt;[[Tomasz Bohun]], ''Podróże po Europie'', ''Władysław IV Wasa'', Władcy Polski, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; He travelled through territories of today's Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, where he admired the [[Siege of Breda (1624)|Siege of Breda]] by Spanish forces, France, Switzerland to Italy, Austria, and the [[Czech Republic]].&lt;ref name="wladcy12b"/&gt; It was an educational journey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adam Kucharski |title=Dyplomacja i turystyka&amp;nbsp;– królewicz Władysław Waza w posiadłościach hiszpańskich (1624–1625)|url=http://www.wilanow-palac.art.pl/dyplomacja_i_turystyka_krolewicz_wladyslaw_waza_w_posiadlosciach_hiszpanskich_1624_1625.html |work=Silva Rerum |accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the outcomes was introduction of [[Polish opera|Italian opera]] in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].&lt;ref&gt;’’The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera’’, ed. Roger Parker (1994): chapter on Central and Eastern European opera by John Warrack, p. 240; ‘’The Viking Opera Guide’’, ed. Amanda Holden (1993): articles on Polish composers, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom flourished from about 1660 until the advent of large-scale [[rail transport|rail]] transit in the 1840s, and generally followed a standard [[Travel itinerary|itinerary]]. It was an educational opportunity and [[rite of passage]]. Though primarily associated with the [[British nobility]] and wealthy [[landed gentry]], similar trips were made by wealthy young men of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Northern Europe]]an nations on the [[Continental Europe|Continent]], and from the second half of the 18th century some South American, US, and other overseas youth joined in. The tradition was extended to include more of the [[middle class]] after rail and steamship travel made the journey easier, and [[Thomas Cook &amp; Son|Thomas Cook]] made the "Cook's Tour" a byword.

The Grand Tour became a real status symbol for upper class students in the 18th and 19th centuries. In this period, Johann Joachim Winckelmann's theories about the supremacy of classic culture became very popular and appreciated in the European academic world. Artists, writers and travellers (such as [[Goethe]]) affirmed the supremacy of classic art of which Italy, France and Greece provide excellent examples. For these reasons, the Grand Tour's main destinations were to those centres, where upper-class students could find rare examples of classic art and history.

''[[The New York Times]]'' recently described the Grand Tour in this way:

{{Quote|text=Three hundred years ago, wealthy young Englishmen began taking a post-[[Oxbridge]] trek through France and Italy in search of art, culture and the roots of [[Western culture|Western civilization]]. With nearly unlimited funds, aristocratic connections and months (or years) to roam, they [[Commission (art)|commissioned paintings]], perfected their language skills and mingled with the upper crust of the Continent.|sign=Gross, Matt.|source=[http://frugaltraveler.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/05/lesons-from-the-frugal-grand-tour/index.html Lessons From the Frugal Grand Tour]." ''New York Times'' 5 September 2008.}}

The primary value of the Grand Tour, it was believed, laid in the exposure both to the cultural legacy of [[classical antiquity]] and the [[Renaissance]], and to the aristocratic and fashionably polite society of the European continent.

The British origin of this new industry is reflected in many place names. In [[Nice]], France, one of the first and best-established holiday resorts on the [[French Riviera]], the long esplanade along the seafront is known to this day as the ''[[Promenade des Anglais]]''; in many other historic resorts in [[continental Europe]], old, well-established palace hotels have names like the ''[[Hotel Bristol]]'', ''Hotel Carlton'', or ''Hotel Majestic''{{spaced ndash}}reflecting the dominance of English customers.

A pioneer of the travel agency business, [[Thomas Cook]]'s idea to offer excursions came to him while waiting for the stagecoach on the London Road at [[Kibworth]]. With the opening of the extended [[Midland Counties Railway]], he arranged to take a group of 540 [[Temperance Movement|temperance campaigners]] from [[Leicester]] [[Leicester Campbell Street railway station|Campbell Street station]] to a rally in [[Loughborough]], {{convert|11|mi|km|spell=in}} away. On 5 July 1841, Thomas Cook arranged for the rail company to charge one [[shilling]] per person; this included rail tickets and food for the journey. Cook was paid a share of the fares charged to the passengers, as the railway tickets, being legal contracts between company and passenger, could not have been issued at his own price.{{clarify|date=April 2017}} This was the first privately chartered [[excursion train]] to be advertised to the general public; Cook himself acknowledged that there had been previous, unadvertised, private excursion trains.&lt;ref&gt;Ingle, R., 1991 ''Thomas Cook of Leicester'', Bangor, Headstart History&lt;/ref&gt; During the following three summers he planned and conducted outings for temperance societies and [[Sunday school]] children. In 1844 the Midland Counties Railway Company agreed to make a permanent arrangement with him, provided he found the passengers. This success led him to start his own business running rail excursions for pleasure, taking a percentage of the railway fares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thomascook.com/thomas-cook-history/|title=Thomas Cook History|website=www.thomascook.com|access-date=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1855, he planned his first excursion abroad, when he took a group from Leicester to [[Calais]] to coincide with the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Paris Exhibition]]. The following year he started his "grand circular tours" of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thomascook.com/thomas-cook-history/key-dates/|title=Key Dates 1841–2014 {{!}} Thomas Cook|website=www.thomascook.com|access-date=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1860s he took parties to Switzerland, Italy, Egypt and the United States. Cook established "inclusive independent travel", whereby the traveller went independently but his agency charged for travel, food and accommodation for a fixed period over any chosen route. Such was his success that the Scottish railway companies withdrew their support between 1862 and 1863 to try the excursion business for themselves.

==Cruise shipping==
[[File:Prinzessin Victoria Luise LOC det.4a15439.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Prinzessin Victoria Luise]], the first [[cruise ship]] of the world, launched in June 1900 in [[Hamburg]] (Germany)]]
Cruising is a popular form of [[water tourism]].
Leisure [[cruise ship]]s were introduced by the ''[[Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation Company]]'' (P&amp;O) in 1844, sailing from [[Southampton]] to destinations such as [[Gibraltar]], [[Malta]] and [[Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.btnews.co.uk/article/5037|title=CRUISE NEWS JUNE 2012|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, German businessman [[Albert Ballin]] sailed the ship [[Augusta Victoria (ship)|''Augusta Victoria'']] from [[Hamburg]] into the Mediterranean Sea. June 29, 1900 saw the launching of the first purpose-built cruise ship was ''[[Prinzessin Victoria Luise]]'', built in Hamburg for the Hamburg America Line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cruiselinehistory.com/the-prinzessin-victoria-luise-worlds-first-cruise-ship/|title=The Prinzessin Victoria Luise – world’s first cruise ship.|work=CRUISING THE PAST|access-date=2018-08-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern day tourism==

Many leisure-oriented tourists travel to [[seaside resort]]s on their nearest coast or further afield. Coastal areas in the tropics are popular in both summer and winter.

===Mass tourism===
[[File:Adolf Friedrich Erdmann von Menzel 044.jpg|thumb|''Reisepläne'' (''Travel plans'') by [[Adolph Menzel]] (1875)]]
[[File:Rom fountain of Trevi.jpg|thumb|Mass tourism at the [[Trevi Fountain]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]]]
[[File:Barceloneta 2007.jpg|thumb|Tourists at the Mediterranean Coast of [[Barcelona]], 2007]]

Academics have defined mass tourism as travel by groups on pre-scheduled tours, usually under the organization of tourism professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Golden Age of Mass Tourism: Its History and Development, Erkan Sezgin and Medet Yolal, [[Anadolu University]], p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; This form of tourism developed during the second half of the 19th century in the [[United Kingdom]] and was pioneered by [[Thomas Cook]]. Cook took advantage of Europe's rapidly expanding railway network and established a company that offered affordable day trip excursions to [[the masses]], in addition to longer holidays to Continental Europe, India, Asia and the Western Hemisphere which attracted wealthier customers. By the 1890s over 20,000 tourists per year used [[Thomas Cook &amp; Son]].&lt;ref name="Mass Tourism p. 74"&gt;Golden Age of Mass Tourism: Its History and Development, Erkan Sezgin and Medet Yolal, [[Anadolu University]], p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between tourism companies, transportation operators and hotels is a central feature of mass tourism. Cook was able to offer prices that were below the publicly advertised price because his company purchased large numbers of tickets from railroads.&lt;ref name="Mass Tourism p. 74"/&gt; One contemporary form of mass tourism, [[package tour]]ism, still incorporates the partnership between these three groups.

Travel developed during the early 20th century and was facilitated by the development of the automobiles and later by airplanes.
Improvements in transport allowed many people to travel quickly to places of leisure interest, so that more people could begin to enjoy the benefits of leisure time.

In [[Continental Europe]], early [[seaside resort]]s included: [[Heiligendamm]], founded in 1793 at the [[Baltic Sea]], being the first seaside resort; [[Ostend]], popularised by the people of [[Brussels]]; [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] and [[Deauville]] for the [[Paris]]ians; [[Taormina]] in [[Sicily]]. In the [[United States]], the first seaside resorts in the European style were at [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]] and [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

By the mid-20th century the Mediterranean Coast became the principal mass tourism destination. The 1960s and 1970s saw mass tourism play a major role in the [[Spanish miracle#Mass tourism and emigration|Spanish economic "miracle"]].

===Niche tourism===
{{main list|List of adjectival tourisms}}
[[File:Cristo Rei (36211699613).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Christ the King (Almada)|Sanctuary of Christ the King]], in [[Almada]], has become one of the most religious tourism visited places.]]

Niche tourism refers to the numerous specialty forms of tourism that have emerged over the years, each with its own adjective. Many of these terms have come into common use by the tourism industry and academics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lew|first=Alan A.|title=Long Tail Tourism: New geographies for marketing niche tourism products|journal=Journal of Travel &amp; Tourism Marketing|year=2008|volume=25|issue=3–4|pages=409–19|doi=10.1080/10548400802508515|url=http://www.geog.nau.edu/publications/Long-Tail-Tourism-Lew.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614084130/http://www.geog.nau.edu/publications/Long-Tail-Tourism-Lew.pdf|archivedate=14 June 2010|df=dmy-all|citeseerx=10.1.1.467.6320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others are emerging concepts that may or may not gain popular usage. Examples of the more common niche tourism markets are:
{{colbegin}}
* [[Agritourism]]
* [[Birth tourism]]
* [[Culinary tourism]]
* [[Cultural tourism]]
* [[Dark tourism]] (also called "black tourism" or "grief tourism") 
* [[Eco tourism]]
* [[Extreme tourism]]
* [[Geotourism]]
* [[Heritage tourism]]
* [[LGBT tourism]]
* [[Medical tourism]]
* [[Movie tourism]]
* [[Nautical tourism]]
* [[Pop-culture tourism]]
* [[Religious tourism]]
* [[Sex tourism]]
* [[Slum tourism]]
* [[Sports tourism]]
* [[Virtual tourism]]
* [[War tourism]]
* [[Wellness tourism]]
* [[Wildlife tourism]]
{{colend}}

Other terms used for niche or specialty travel forms include the term "destination" in the descriptions, such as [[destination wedding]]s, and terms such as [[location vacation]].

===Winter tourism===
{{See also|List of ski areas and resorts|Winter sport}}
[[St. Moritz]], [[Switzerland]] became the cradle of the developing winter tourism in the 1860s: hotel manager Johannes Badrutt invited some summer guests from England to return in the winter to see the snowy landscape, thereby inaugurating a popular trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stmoritz.ch/en/winter/village/spirit-history/birthplace-of-winter-tourism.html|title=Birthplace of winter tourism|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017122131/http://www.stmoritz.ch/en/winter/village/spirit-history/birthplace-of-winter-tourism.html|archivedate=17 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early Winter Tourism|url=http://www.kulmhotel-stmoritz.ch/en/portrait/tradition-history/early-winter-tourism.html|work=Tradition &amp; History|publisher=Kulm Hotel|accessdate=23 December 2011|location=[[St. Moritz]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219230025/http://www.kulmhotel-stmoritz.ch/en/portrait/tradition-history/early-winter-tourism.html|archivedate=19 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was, however, only in the 1970s when winter tourism took over the lead from summer tourism in many of the Swiss ski resorts. Even in winter, up to one third of all guests (depending on the location) consist of non-skiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.graubuenden.ch/winter-walking-switzerland.html |title=Winter hiking in Switzerland-Graubünden|publisher=graubuenden.ch |accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major [[ski resort]]s are located mostly in the various European countries (e.g. [[Andorra]], [[Austria]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Cyprus]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], Greece, [[Iceland]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[List of ski areas and resorts in Europe#Poland|Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Sweden]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], [[Turkey]]), [[Canada]], the [[United States]] (e.g. Montana, Utah, Colorado, California, Wyoming, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York) [[Argentina]], [[New Zealand]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Chile]], and [[Lebanon]].

Some places that already have ski opportunities can also have glaciers in the area. Some of theses places already offer a glacier hike to see the glaciers in another way that they can. One of these places are New Zealand. New Zealand has several glaciers that are available for this experience. The Franz Josef is one of these glaciers that tourism is available. The only way to get to the glacier is via a helicopter. Before helicopters were invented the way that people were able to get up to the glacier was by hiking up to the glacier. The companies have to make sure that people are safe from when they are on the glacier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Purdie|first=Heather|date=1 November 2013|title=Glacier Retreat and Tourism: Insights from New Zealand|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-12-00073.1|journal=Mountain Research and Development|volume=33|issue=4|pages=463–472|doi=10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-12-00073.1|issn=0276-4741}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would fall under environmental tourism as well as winter tourism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Recent developments==
[[File:Aerial view Yacht Harbour Residence Rostock Yachthafenresidenz Hohe Düne 6.jpg|thumb|right|A [[destination hotel]] in [[Germany]]: ''Yacht Harbour Residence'' in [[Warnemünde|Rostock]], [[Mecklenburg]].]]
[[File:Can you see the surfer? (33988985575).jpg|thumb|right|[[Nazaré, Portugal]], is now listed on the [[Guinness World Records]] for the biggest waves ever surfed and has become a worldwide tourist attraction.]]
There has been an up-trend in tourism over the last few decades,{{vague|date=November 2013}} especially in Europe, where international travel for short breaks is common. Tourists have a wide range of budgets and tastes, and a wide variety of resorts and hotels have developed to cater for them. For example, some people prefer simple beach vacations, while others want more specialised holidays, quieter resorts, family-oriented holidays, or niche market-targeted [[destination hotel]]s.

The developments in [[Aviation|air transport]] infrastructure, such as [[Wide-body aircraft|jumbo jets]], [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost airlines]], and more [[accessible tourism|accessible]] [[airport]]s have made many types of tourism more affordable. The [[WHO]] estimated in 2009 that there are around half a million people on board aircraft at any given time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8477508 Swine flu prompts EU warning on travel to US]. ''The Guardian.'' 28 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been changes in lifestyle, for example some retirement-age people sustain year round tourism. This is facilitated by [[Electronic commerce|internet sales]] of tourist services. Some sites have now started to offer [[dynamic packaging]], in which an inclusive price is quoted for a tailor-made package requested by the customer upon impulse.

There have been a few setbacks in tourism, such as the [[September 11 attacks]] and [[terrorism|terrorist threats]] to [[tourist destination]]s, such as in [[Bali]] and several European cities. Also, on 26 December 2004, a [[tsunami]], caused by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]], hit the [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Asia|Asian countries]] on the [[Indian Ocean]], including the [[Maldives]]. Thousands of lives were lost including many tourists. This, together with the vast [[clean-up]] operations, stopped or severely hampered tourism in the area for a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://travelcupio.com/category/destination/asia-pacific/india/|title=India Top Tourist Destinations &amp; Attractions|website=TravelCupio|language=en-US|access-date=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual low-price or even zero-price overnight stays have become more popular in the 2000s, especially with a strong growth in the [[hostel]] market and services like [[CouchSurfing]] and [[airbnb]] being established.&lt;ref name="newyorkercouch"&gt;{{cite web|last=Marx|first=Patricia|title=Couch-surfing the globe|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/04/16/120416fa_fact_marx|publisher=The New Yorker|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been examples of jurisdictions wherein a significant portion of GDP is being spent on altering the primary sources of revenue towards tourism, as has occurred for instance in [[Dubai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cadene|first1=Philippe|title=Atlas of the Gulf States|date=2013|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable tourism===
{{Main|Sustainable tourism}}

"Sustainable tourism is envisaged as leading to management of all resources in such a way that economic, social and aesthetic needs can be fulfilled while maintaining cultural integrity, essential ecological processes, [[Biodiversity|biological diversity]] and life support systems." ([[World Tourism Organization]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainable Tourism: Turning the Tide |url=http://www.stakeholderforum.org/fileadmin/files/SF_Briefing_Papers/bp_tourism.pdf|work=Towards Earth Summit 2002|publisher=[[Stakeholder Forum for a Sustainable Future]]|access-date=22 January 2012|date=August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sustainable development]] implies "meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." ([[Bruntland Commission|World Commission on Environment and Development]], 1987)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a42r187.htm|work=42/187. Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development|publisher=[[The Conference of NGOs]]|access-date=21 January 2012|date=11 December 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important part of sustainable tourism is something known as the three pillars of sustainability which include Economic, Environmental/Ecological and Socio-cultural. For a destination to be truly sustainable it must have an equal balance which the three pillars. Economic is in relation to money and making and maintaining a certain amount of cash. Environmental is of course in relation to the environment it looks into whether the local ecosystems can support the influx of visitors and also how these visitors effect the ecosystem. Then finally Socio-cultural is about how well the culture of this area is able to maintain its traditions with the incoming tourists.  These pillars are important because they are the true key to being sustainable when discussing tourism.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Sustainable tourism can be seen as having regard to ecological and social-cultural carrying capacities and includes involving the community of the destination in tourism development planning (that was done e.g. in [[Fruška Gora]] National Park in [[Serbia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vujko|first=Aleksandra|last2=Plavša|first2=Jovan|last3=Petrović|first3=Marko|last4=Radovanović|first4=Milan|last5=Gajić|first5=Tamara|date=13 March 2017|title=Modelling of carrying capacity in National Park - Fruška Gora (Serbia) case study|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/geo.2017.9.issue-1/issue-files/geo.2017.9.issue-1.xml|journal=Open Geosciences|volume=9|issue=1|pages=61–72|doi=10.1515/geo-2017-0005|issn=2391-5447|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). It also involves integrating tourism to match current economic and growth policies so as to mitigate some of the negative economic and social [[impacts of tourism|impacts]] of '[[mass tourism]]'. Murphy (1985) advocates the use of an 'ecological approach', to consider both 'plants' and 'people' when implementing the sustainable tourism development process. This is in contrast to the '[[boosterism]]' and '[[economic]]' approaches to tourism planning, neither of which consider the detrimental ecological or sociological impacts of tourism development to a destination.

However, Butler questions the exposition of the term 'sustainable' in the context of tourism, citing its ambiguity and stating that "the emerging sustainable development philosophy of the 1990s can be viewed as an extension of the broader realization that a preoccupation with economic growth without regard to its social and environmental consequences is self-defeating in the long term." Thus 'sustainable tourism development' is seldom considered as an autonomous function of economic regeneration as separate from general economic growth.

===Ecotourism===
{{Main|Ecotourism}}
Ecotourism, also known as ecological tourism, is responsible travel to fragile, pristine, and usually protected areas that strives to be low-impact and (often) small-scale. It helps educate the traveler; provides funds for conservation; directly benefits the economic development and political empowerment of local communities; and fosters respect for different cultures and for human rights.''Take only memories and leave only footprints'' is a very common slogan in protected areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pinterest.com/marymo393/take-only-memories-leave-only-footprints-chief-sea/|title=Morgan Gamble|work=Pinterest|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourist destinations are shifting to low carbon emissions following the trend of visitors more focused in being environmentally responsible adopting a sustainable behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Entrepreneuring Sustainable Tourism, [[Jack Soifer]] Editor, Lisboa, 2008, {{ISBN|978-989-95976-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movie tourism===
The movie tourism is a form of tourism for those who visit the film and television locations, ie the places used for filming a film or a television series. In addition to organized tours (and not) to film locations lately has widened the tendency to a type of tourism, linked to the cinema, which relates to events, conventions and more like the case of the [[Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico]].

===Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico===
The Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico is an artistic costume movement originally born as a journalistic column on various online and paper publications officially in 2012 (with a genesis formed in the previous decade) but, in the following years, it has become a real costume fashion popularized in sites, associations, institutions, municipal administrations, political parties, movements and television listings all over the world. It also includes Museums and Sports Groups linked to its brand. The purpose of the work is varied: from the redevelopment of territorial areas thanks to the artistic interest raised to be film and fiction locations ([[Movie tourism]]) to promote events linked to the Cinema as film anniversaries, festivals, parties to theme (Toga Party, Monster Party, Cosplay Party, Hollywood Party, Pajamas Party, etc ...), manifestations born in films or that the cinema has helped to divulge (though already existing) as, for example, the Demolition Derby, village festivals disseminated by the Cinema (such as those appearing in the [[Mondo Cane]] film series, etc ...). We wanted to differentiate from Movie Tourism  (a fashion that has existed for several decades) to be more varied and not limited to tourism (that is a part of the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico).
In the mid-2000s, the student of video advertising and journalistic communications at the [[Turin]] branch of the Fellini Institute [[Davide Lingua]] (called Dave Lingua), obsessed with customary phenomena, has in mind to create a totally new object to redevelop areas territories hit by the crisis but fun and that leads to fashion accessible to all. This is the genesis for the creation of the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico. A few years later (between 2010, the beginning of the collaboration, and 2012) creates with this name a column (which initially deals with Cine tourism, Cinema Museums and Costume Party with a cinematic theme) within the site (in that period related to the homonymous paper magazine) of the Milan group [[Mondadori]] [[filmtv.it]] which soon became the most popular of the magazine with a myriad of collaborators. In the following period the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico appears as a column in various newspapers and magazines (the Netweek group, La Voce, is mentioned in [[La Stampa]] and many other newspapers) and officially appears as a cultural movement that gives full freedom to all to join simply using the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico (respecting however the topics of interest of the movement) coming to create totally independent sections (but always within legally registered bodies or associations), with their own statutes and directives but with only provided that the official founder (helped at the beginning by the first members) Davide Lingua is recognized as Permanent Director for life (in fact director and not president because he wants to underline the journalistic origin of the project).

From its birth until today the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico is a worldwide journalistic column, television broadcasting, has sections in many associations, institutions that collaborate with municipal administrations, has dealt with the official celebrations of film shooting anniversaries (for example [[Salasco]] of the film [[Bitter Rice]]), appears in the credits of many films for the collaboration given, organizes communication courses, cultural and sporting events, etc ...

===Volunteer tourism===

Volunteer tourism (or voluntourism) is growing as a largely Western phenomenon, with volunteers travelling to aid those less fortunate than themselves in order to counter global inequalities. Wearing (2001) defines volunteer tourism as applying “to those tourists who, for various reasons, volunteer in an organised way to undertake holidays that might involve aiding or alleviating the material poverty of some groups in society”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Volunteer Tourism: Experiences That Make a Difference|publisher=CABI}}&lt;/ref&gt; VSO was founded in the UK in 1958 and the US Peace Corps was subsequently founded in 1960. These were the first large scale voluntary sending organisations, initially arising to modernise less economically developed countries, which it was hoped would curb the influence of communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butcher|first=J|last2=Smith|first2=P|date=2010|title=‘Making a difference’: Volunteer tourism and development|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02508281.2010.11081616|journal=Tourism Recreation Research|volume=35|pages=27–36|doi=10.1080/02508281.2010.11081616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of tourism is largely praised for its more sustainable approach to travel, with tourists attempting to assimilate into local cultures, and avoiding the criticisms of consumptive and exploitative mass tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Terry|first=W|date=2014|title=Solving labor problems and building capacity unsustainable agriculture through volunteer tourism|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160738314001091|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=49|pages=94–107|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2014.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, increasingly voluntourism is being criticised by scholars who suggest it may have negative effects as it begins to undermine local labour, and force unwilling host communities to adopt Western initiatives,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guttentag|first=D|date=2009|title=The possible negative impacts of volunteer tourism|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jtr.727/full|journal=International Journal of Tourism Research|volume=11|issue=6|pages=537–51|doi=10.1002/jtr.727}}&lt;/ref&gt; while host communities without a strong heritage fail to retain volunteers who become dissatisfied with experiences and volunteer shortages persist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curran|first=Ross|last2=Taheri|first2=Babak|last3=MacIntosh|first3=Robert|last4=O'Gorman|first4=Kevin|date=2016|title=Nonprofit Brand Heritage: Its Ability to Influence Volunteer Retention, Engagement, and Satisfaction|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0899764016633532|journal=Nonprofit and Volutary Sector Quarterly|volume=45|issue=6|pages=1234–57|doi=10.1177/0899764016633532}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly organisations such as VSO have been concerned with community-centric volunteer programmes where power to control the future of the community is in the hands of local people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Jamie|last2=Curran|first2=Ross|last3=O'Gorman|first3=Kevin|date=2017|title=A modern day panopticon: Using power and control theory to manage volunteer tourists in Bolivia|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221197361730003X|journal=Tourism Management Perspectives|volume=22|pages=34–43|doi=10.1016/j.tmp.2017.01.003|hdl=10373/2606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pro-poor tourism, which seeks to help the poorest people in developing countries, has been receiving increasing attention by those involved in development; the issue has been addressed through small-scale projects in local communities and through attempts by Ministries of Tourism to attract large numbers of tourists. Research by the [[Overseas Development Institute]] suggests that neither is the best way to encourage tourists' money to reach the poorest as only 25% or less (far less in some cases) ever reaches the poor; successful examples of money reaching the poor include mountain-climbing in [[Tanzania]] and cultural tourism in [[Luang Prabang]], [[Laos]].&lt;ref name="odi.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2675&amp;title=value-chains-tourism-poverty-reduction |title=Value chain analysis and poverty reduction at scale  |author=Jonathan Mitchel |year=2009 |publisher=Overseas Development Institute |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the possibility of pro-poor tourism principles being adopted in centre sites of regeneration in the developed world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=Richard|last2=Curran|first2=Ross|last3=O'Gorman|first3=Kevin D.|date=1 September 2013|title=Pro-Poor Tourism in a First World Urban Setting: Case Study of Glasgow Govan|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jtr.1888/abstract|journal=International Journal of Tourism Research|language=en|volume=15|issue=5|pages=443–57|doi=10.1002/jtr.1888|issn=1522-1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recession tourism===
Recession tourism is a travel trend which evolved by way of the world economic crisis. Recession tourism is defined by low-cost and high-value experiences taking place of once-popular generic retreats. Various recession tourism hotspots have seen business boom during the recession thanks to comparatively low costs of living and a slow world job market suggesting travelers are elongating trips where their money travels further. This concept is not widely used in tourism research. It is related to the short-lived phenomenon that is more widely known as [[staycation]].

===Medical tourism===
{{Main|Medical tourism}}
When there is a significant price difference between countries for a given medical procedure, particularly in [[Southeast Asia]], [[India]], [[Eastern Europe]], [[Cuba]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/world/americas/americans-may-see-appeal-of-medical-tourism-in-cuba.html|title=Americans May See Appeal of Medical Tourism in Cuba|last=Neuman|first=William|date=17 February 2015|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.deloitte.com/ca/en/pages/life-sciences-and-healthcare/articles/evolving-medical-tourism-in-canada.html|title=Evolving medical tourism in Canada {{!}} Deloitte Canada|website=Deloitte Canada|access-date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where there are different regulatory regimes, in relation to particular medical procedures (e.g. [[dentistry]]), traveling to take advantage of the price or regulatory differences is often referred to as "medical tourism".

===Educational tourism===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
Educational tourism is developed because of the growing popularity of teaching and learning of knowledge and the enhancing of technical competency outside of classroom environment. In educational tourism, the main focus of the tour or leisure activity includes visiting another country to learn about the culture, study tours, or to work and apply skills learned inside the classroom in a different environment, such as in the International Practicum Training Program.

=== Event tourism ===
This type of tourism is focused tourists coming into a region to either participate in an event  or to see an organized event put on by the city/region.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/760291882|title=Tourism management : an introduction|last=Clare.|first=Inkson,|date=2012|publisher=SAGE|others=Minnaert, Lynn.|isbn=9781848608696|location=Los Angeles|oclc=760291882}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of tourism can also fall under [[sustainable tourism]] as well and companies that create a [[Sustainable event management|sustainable event]] to attend open up a chance to not only the consumer but their workers to learn and develop from the experience. Creating a sustainable atmosphere it creates a chance to inform and encourage sustainable practices. An example of event tourism would be the music festival [[South by Southwest]] that is hosted in [[Austin, Texas]] annually. This is a perfect example because very year people from all over the world flock to this one city for one week to sit in on technology talks and see a whole city of bands perform. These people are being drawn here to experience something that they are not able to experience in their hometown which is exactly what event tourism is about.

===Creative tourism===
[[File:FF of Hartwell welcomes Indonesians.jpg|thumb|left|[[Friendship Force International|Friendship Force]] visitors from Indonesia meet their hosts in [[Hartwell, Georgia]], USA.]]
Creative tourism has existed as a form of [[cultural tourism]], since the early beginnings of tourism itself. Its European roots date back to the time of the [[Grand Tour]], which saw the sons of aristocratic families traveling for the purpose of mostly interactive, educational experiences. More recently, creative tourism has been given its own name by Crispin Raymond and Greg Richards,&lt;ref name="ct"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wurzburger|first=Rebecca|title=Creative Tourism: A Global Conversation: How to Provide Unique Creative Experiences for Travelers Worldwide: As Presented at the 2008 Santa Fe &amp; UNESCO International Conference on Creative Tourism in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA|publisher=Sunstone Press|location=Santa Fe|year=2009|isbn=978-0-86534-724-3|oclc=370387178|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; who as members of the Association for Tourism and Leisure Education (ATLAS), have directed a number of projects for the [[European Commission]], including cultural and crafts tourism, known as [[sustainable tourism]]. They have defined "creative tourism" as tourism related to the active participation of travellers in the [[culture]] of the host community, through interactive workshops and informal learning experiences.&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt;

Meanwhile, the concept of creative tourism has been picked up by high-profile organizations such as [[UNESCO]], who through the [[Creative Cities Network]], have endorsed creative tourism as an engaged, [[authenticity (reenactment)|authentic]] experience that promotes an active understanding of the specific cultural features of a [[Location (geography)|place]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

[[File:Greg Richards - Conferencia Turismo Creativo.jpg|thumb|A tourism conference underway.]]
More recently, creative tourism has gained popularity as a form of cultural tourism, drawing on active participation by travelers in the culture of the host communities they visit. Several countries offer examples of this type of tourism development, including the United Kingdom, Austria, France, the Bahamas, Jamaica, Spain, Italy, New Zealand and South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legco.gov.hk/research-publications/english/essentials-1617ise03-creative-tourism.htm|title=Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region - Creative tourism|last=Lau|first=Samantha|date=14 November 2016|website=Legislative Council of Hong Kong|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The growing interest of tourists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Charlie Mansfield Lecturer in Tourism Management and French |url=http://www.tourismconsumption.org/ |title=JTCaP Tourism Consumption Online Journal |publisher=Tourismconsumption.org |accessdate=10 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415231711/http://www.tourismconsumption.org/ |archivedate=15 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in this new way to discover a culture regards particularly the operators and branding managers, attentive to the possibility of attracting a quality tourism, highlighting the intangible heritage (craft workshops, cooking classes, etc.) and optimizing the use of existing infrastructure (for example, through the rent of halls and auditorium).

===Experiential tourism===
[[Experiential travel]] (or "immersion travel") is one of the major market trends in the modern tourism industry. It is an approach to travelling which focuses on experiencing a country, city or particular place by connecting to its [[history]], people, food and [[culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/nyregion/your-home-the-new-frontier-for-tourists-in-new-york-city.html|title=Your Home, the New Frontier for Tourists in New York City|first=Ginia|last=Bellafante|date=6 July 2012|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term “Experiential travel” is already mentioned in publications from 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=o_QJAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22experiential+travel%22&amp;dq=%22experiential+travel%22|title=Insights in Strategic Retail Management|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; – however it was discovered as a meaningful market trend much later.

===Dark tourism===
{{Main|Dark tourism}}
[[File:Poland - Czermna - Chapel of Skulls - interior 06.jpg|thumb|The [[Skull Chapel, Czermna|Skull Chapel]] in south-western [[Poland]] is an example of [[dark tourism]]. Its interior walls, ceiling and foundations are adorned by human remains. It is the only such monument in Poland, and one of six in [[Europe]].]]
One emerging area of special interest has been identified by Lennon and Foley (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-dar2.htm|title=Dark Tourism|last=Quinion|first=Michael|date=26 November 2005|work=World Wide Words|accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lennon|first1=J. John |first2=Malcolm|last2=Foley|location=London|title=Dark Tourism|publisher=Continuum|year=2000|isbn=978-0-8264-5063-0 |oclc=44603703}}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Dark tourism|"dark" tourism]]. This type of tourism involves visits to "dark" sites, such as battlegrounds, scenes of horrific crimes or acts of [[genocide]], for example [[Internment|concentration camps]]. Its origins are rooted in fairgrounds and medieval fairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=Chris|title=Tourism: Principles and Practice|publisher=[[Pearson Education]]|location=Harlow|year=2005|edition= 3rd|isbn=978-0-273-68406-0|oclc=466952897|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Stone]] argues that dark tourism is a way of imagining one's own death through the real death of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stone|first=Philip R.|date=1 July 2012|title=Dark tourism and significant other death: Towards a Model of Mortality Mediation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160738312000564|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=39|issue=3|pages=1565–87|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2012.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erik H Cohen]] introduces the term "[[populo sites]]" to evidence the educational character of dark tourism. Populo sites transmit the story of victimized people to visitors. Based on a study at [[Yad Vashem]], the Shoah (Holocaust) memorial museum in Jerusalem, a new term—''in populo''—is proposed to describe dark tourism sites at a spiritual and population center of the people to whom a tragedy befell. Learning about the Shoah in Jerusalem offers an encounter with the subject which is different from visits to sites in Europe, but equally authentic. It is argued that a dichotomy between "authentic" sites at the location of a tragedy and "created" sites elsewhere is insufficient. Participants' evaluations of seminars for European teachers at Yad Vashem indicate that the location is an important aspect of a meaningful encounter with the subject. Implications for other cases of dark tourism at ''in populo'' locations are discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Erik H.|date=1 January 2011|title=Educational dark tourism at an in populo site: The Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160738310001040|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=38|issue=1|pages=193–209|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2010.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this vein, [[Peter Tarlow]] defines dark tourism as the tendency to visit the scenes of tragedies or historically noteworthy deaths, which continue to impact our lives. This issue cannot be understood without the figure of trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ciW6GbT5jNEC|title=Niche Tourism|last=Novelli|first=Marina|date=1 June 2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1136376177|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social tourism===
Social tourism is making tourism available to poor people who otherwise could not afford to travel for their education or recreation. It includes [[youth hostels]] and low-priced holiday accommodation run by church and [[voluntary organisation]]s, [[trade unions]], or in Communist times [[combine (enterprise)|publicly owned enterprises]]. In May 1959, at the second Congress of Social Tourism in Austria, [[Walter Hunziker#Social tourism|Walter Hunziker]] proposed the following definition: "Social tourism is a type of tourism practiced by low income groups, and which is rendered possible and facilitated by entirely separate and therefore easily recognizable services".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/261135450|title=Tourism : principles, practices, philosophies|last=R.|first=Goeldner, Charles|date=2009|publisher=John Wiley|others=Ritchie, J.

===Doom tourism===
[[File:Perito Moreno Glacier Patagonia Argentina Luca Galuzzi 2005.JPG|thumb|[[Perito Moreno Glacier]], [[Patagonia]], [[Argentina]].]]

Also known as "Tourism of Doom," or "Last Chance Tourism" this emerging trend involves traveling to places that are environmentally or otherwise threatened (such as the ice caps of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], the melting glaciers of [[Patagonia]], or the coral of the [[Great Barrier Reef]]) before it is too late. Identified by travel trade magazine [[Travel Age West]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shapiro |first=Kenneth |url=http://www.travelagewest.com/Travel-News/Viewpoint/The-Tourism-of-Doom/ |title=TravelAge West – TravelAge West |publisher=Travelagewest.com |date=11 May 2007 |accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; editor-in-chief Kenneth Shapiro in 2007 and later explored in ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Salkin |first=Allen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/16/world/americas/16iht-tourism.1.8762449.html |title='Tourism of doom' on rise|publisher=Nytimes.com |date=16 December 2007 |accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; this type of tourism is believed to be on the rise. Some see the trend as related to [[sustainable tourism]] or [[ecotourism]] due to the fact that a number of these tourist destinations are considered threatened by environmental factors such as global warming, overpopulation or climate change. Others worry that travel to many of these threatened locations increases an individual’s [[carbon footprint]] and only hastens problems threatened locations are already facing.&lt;ref&gt;Lemelin, H., Dawson, J., &amp; Stewart, E.

===Religious tourism===
{{Main|Religious tourism}}
[[File:Saint Peter's Basilica facade, Rome, Italy.jpg|thumb|[[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Vatican City]], the papal enclave within the Italian city of Rome, is one of the largest religious tourism sites in the world.]]
Religious tourism, in particular religious travel, is used to strengthen faith and show devotion both of which are central tenets of many major religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jafari|first=Jafar|last2=Scott|first2=Noel|date=1 January 2014|title=Muslim world and its tourisms|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160738313001199|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=44|pages=1–19|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2013.08.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious tourists seek destinations whose image encourages them to believe that they can strengthen the religious elements of their self-identity in a positive manner. Given this, the perceived image of a destination may be positively influenced by whether it conforms to the requirements of their religious self-identity or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gannon|first=Martin Joseph|last2=Baxter|first2=Ian W.

==Growth==
The [[World Tourism Organization]] (UNWTO) forecasts that international tourism will continue growing at the average annual rate of 4%.&lt;ref name="predict"&gt;{{cite web| year = 2004| url = http://www.world-tourism.org/market_research/facts/market_trends.htm| title = Long-term Prospects: Tourism 2020 Vision| publisher = World Tourism| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040619001112/http://www.world-tourism.org/market_research/facts/market_trends.htm| archivedate = 19 June 2004| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of [[electronic commerce|e-commerce]], tourism products have become one of the most traded items on the internet. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Tourism products and services have been made available through intermediaries, although tourism providers (hotels, airlines, etc.), including small-scale operators, can sell their services directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lu|first=Jie|last2=Lu|first2=Zi|date=1 July 2004|title=Development, Distribution and Evaluation of Online Tourism Services in China|journal=Electronic Commerce Research|language=en|volume=4|issue=3|pages=221–39|doi=10.1023/B:ELEC.0000027981.81945.2a|issn=1389-5753}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karanasios|first=Stan|last2=Burgess|first2=Stephen|date=1 March 2008|title=Tourism and internet adoption: a developing world perspective|journal=International Journal of Tourism Research|language=en|volume=10|issue=2|pages=169–82|doi=10.1002/jtr.649|issn=1522-1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has put pressure on intermediaries from both on-line and traditional shops.

It has been suggested there is a strong correlation between tourism expenditure per capita and the degree to which countries play in the global context.&lt;ref name="correl"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2007| url = http://global-culture.org/blog/2007/01/27/airports-tourists/ | title =airports &amp; tourists | publisher = Global Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only as a result of the important economic contribution of the tourism industry, but also as an indicator of the degree of confidence with which global citizens leverage the resources of the globe for the benefit of their [[Community-based economics|local economies]]. This is why any projections of growth in tourism may serve as an indication of the relative influence that each country will exercise in the future.

There has been a limited amount of orbital [[space tourism]], with only the [[Russian Space Agency]] providing transport to date.

{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Since the late 1980s, [[sports tourism]] has become increasingly popular. Events such as rugby, Olympics, Commonwealth games, Asian Games and football World Cups have enabled specialist travel companies to gain official ticket allocation and then sell them in packages that include flights, hotels and excursions.

===Latest trends===
As a result of the [[late-2000s recession]], international arrivals suffered a strong slowdown beginning in June 2008. Growth from 2007 to 2008 was only 3.7% during the first eight months of 2008. This slowdown on international tourism demand was also reflected in the air transport industry, with a negative growth in September 2008 and a 3.3% growth in passenger traffic through September. The hotel industry also reported a slowdown, with room occupancy declining. In 2009 worldwide tourism arrivals decreased by 3.8%.&lt;ref name="UNWTO"&gt;{{cite web|last=UNWTO|title=UNWTO Tourism Highlights|url=http://mkt.unwto.org/sites/all/files/docpdf/unwtohighlights11enhr_1.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=UNWTO|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the first quarter of 2009, real travel demand in the United States had fallen 6% over six quarters. While this is considerably milder than what occurred after the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]], the decline was at twice the rate as real GDP has fallen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/economics/commerce/tourism-impacts-world-economic-crisis-north-america/ | title=Impacts of the World Recession and Economic Crisis on Tourism: North America}} JournalistsResource.org.

However, evidence suggests that tourism as a global phenomenon shows no signs of substantially abating in the long term. It has been suggested that travel is necessary in order to maintain relationships, as social life is increasingly networked and conducted at a distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Urry|first=John|title=Social Networks, Travel and Talk|journal=British Journal of Sociology|year=2003|volume=54|issue=2|pages=155–75|doi=10.1080/0007131032000080186|pmid=12945865}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many people vacations and travel are increasingly being viewed as a necessity rather than a luxury, and this is reflected in tourist numbers recovering some 6.6% globally over 2009, with growth up to 8% in emerging economies.&lt;ref name="UNWTO"/&gt;

'''Venture Cup''' is a type of a Scandinavian business plan competition in which entrepreneurs with unique business ideas compete for investment capital.

Run by non-profit organizations in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, Venture Cup competitions are the largest business plan competitions in the world. Used to promote [[entrepreneurship]] within Scandinavian universities and to generate high-growth start-up companies within Scandinavian society, the various organizations award more than half a million euros across Scandinavia on a yearly basis. Each organization runs its competition differently; some consist of several stages, in which participating teams submit  ideas or projects for consideration to a professional jury and then develop those ideas into investment-ready [[business plan]]s. Others (in Denmark, for example) run separate competitions for unique business concepts and well-developed business plans.

== VENTURE CUP DENMARK ==

'''[http://venturecup.dk/ Venture Cup Denmark]''' is a world-leading startup organization for university students based in Denmark.

In law, '''wrongful dismissal''', also called '''wrongful termination''' or '''wrongful discharge''', is a situation in which an employee's [[contract of employment]] has been terminated by the employer, where the termination breaches one or more terms of the contract of employment, or a [[statutory|statute]] provision or rule in [[employment law]]. Laws governing wrongful dismissal vary according to the terms of the employment contract, as well as under the laws and public policies of the [[jurisdiction]].

A related concept is [[constructive dismissal]] in which an employee feels no choice but to resign from employment for reasons that result from the employer's violation of the employee's legal rights.

==Forms of wrongful dismissal==
Being terminated for any of the items listed below may constitute wrongful termination:

* '''Discrimination''': The employer cannot terminate employment because the employee is a certain race, nationality, religion, sex, age, or (in some jurisdictions) sexual orientation.
* '''Retaliation''': An employer cannot fire an employee because the employee filed a claim of discrimination or is participating in an investigation for discrimination. In the US, this "retaliation" is forbidden under civil rights law.
* '''Employee's refusal to commit an illegal act''': An employer is not permitted to fire an employee because the employee refuses to commit an act that is illegal.
* '''Employer is not following the company's own termination procedures''': In some cases, an employee handbook or company policy outlines a procedure that must be followed before an employee is terminated. If the employer fires an employee without following this procedure, depending upon the laws of the jurisdiction in which the termination occurs, the employee may have a claim for wrongful termination.

The absence of a formal contract of employment does not preclude wrongful dismissal in jurisdictions in which a ''de facto'' contract is taken to exist by virtue of the employment relationship. Terms of such a contract may include obligations and rights outlined in an [[employee handbook]].

Many jurisdictions provide tribunals or courts which that hear actions for wrongful dismissal. A proven wrongful dismissal will tend to lead to the award of one or both of the following remedies:
*reinstatement of the dismissed employee;
*monetary compensation for the wrongfully dismissed.

==Probationary employees==
One way to avoid potential liability for wrongful dismissal with newer employees is to institute an [[probation (workplace)|employment probation]] period after which a new employee is automatically terminated unless there is sufficient justification not to do so. The dismissed employee may still assert a claim, but proof will be more difficult, as the employer may have broad discretion with retaining such a temporary employee.

==United States==
In the United States, there is no single “wrongful termination” law. Rather there are several state and federal laws and court decisions that define this concept.

In all U.S. states except Montana,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://dli.mt.gov/resources/faq|website=Montana Department of Labor &amp; Industry|publisher=State of Montana|accessdate=20 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222051735/http://dli.mt.gov/resources/faq|archivedate=22 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; workers are considered by default to be [[At-will employment|at-will employees]], meaning that they may be fired at any time without cause.

Some employees have contracts of employment that limit their employers' ability to terminate them without cause. Other employees may be members of unions and benefit from a [[Collective agreement|collective bargaining agreement]] that defines disciplinary proceedings and limits when an employee may be terminated. Employees who work for government agencies normally benefit from civil service protections that restrict termination. Those employees, if terminated, may attempt to bring wrongful termination claims under the terms of the contract or agreement, or civil service law.

===Termination of at-will employment===
Although at-will employees are protected from termination by civil rights laws and other laws that prohibit retaliatory termination, in the absence of a contract of employment or collective bargaining agreement, or civil service protections extended to government workers, they have few protections from being fired.&lt;ref name="lars"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Wrongful Termination of At Will Employment|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/employment/at_will.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=20 December 2017|date=5 August 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222050932/https://www.expertlaw.com/library/employment/at_will.html|archivedate=22 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some situations an at-will employee may be able to claim wrongful termination. Three leading grounds for claiming wrongful termination are:
#'''Implied contract''': In some situations a court might find an implied contract of employment that restricts the employer's ability to terminate an employee without cause. For example, the terms of an employee manual may support an employee's claim that the employer must follow a defined disciplinary process prior to termination.
#'''Public policy''': In many states it is possible to argue that the employer's reasons for terminating an employee, although not in violation of a statute, violated the state's public policy such that a wrongful termination claim should be allowed. For example, a court might allow a claim by an employee who was fired for refusing to take an action that was in violation of the law, for reporting a violation of the law to an enforcement agency, or for otherwise exercising the employee's rights under the law.
#'''Covenant of good faith and fair dealing''': In what is in many senses an extension of public policy doctrine, some states allow an at-will employee to pursue a wrongful termination claim if the cause for the termination is deemed to reflect bad faith on the part of the employer. For example, a state might apply this doctrine to allow a claim against an employer that terminated an employee a week before that employee's pension benefits vested, for no reason other than to avoid paying the employee a pension.

A 2016 study found evidence that the implied-contract exception to at-will employment reduced state employment rates by 0.8% to 1.7%. The initial impact is largest for female and less-educated workers (those who change jobs frequently), while the longer-term effect is greater for older and more-educated workers (those most likely to litigate). By contrast, we find no robust employment or wage effects of two other widely recognized wrongful-discharge laws: the public-policy and goodfaith exceptions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Autor|first=David H|last2=Donohue|first2=John J|last3=Schwab|first3=Stewart J|date=2006-05-01|title=The Costs of Wrongful-Discharge Laws|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1162/rest.88.2.211|journal=Review of Economics and Statistics|volume=88|issue=2|pages=211–231|doi=10.1162/rest.88.2.211|issn=0034-6535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Termination in violation of the law===
In the United States, termination of employment is not legal if it is based on your membership in a group protected from discrimination by law.&lt;ref name="lars"/&gt; It is unlawful for an employer to terminate an employee based upon factors including employee's race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, disability, medical condition, pregnancy, or age (over 40), pursuant to U.S. federal laws such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm|website=Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|publisher=U.S. Government|accessdate=20 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171219201431/https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm|archivedate=19 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)|url=https://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.htm|website=Americans with Disabilities website|publisher=U.S. Government|accessdate=28 June 2018|deadurl=no|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/adea.cfm|website=Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|publisher=U.S. Government|accessdate=28 June 2018|deadurl=no|}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Many states also have civil rights laws that protect workers from discrimination. For example, those forms of discrimination are prohibited by the [[California Fair Employment and Housing Act|California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act]] (FEHA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unlawful Discrimination|url=http://ag.ca.gov/civilrights/pdf/01cr_handbook.pdf|website=California Attorney General's Office|accessdate=20 December 2017|date=August 2001|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231104941/http://ag.ca.gov/civilrights/pdf/01cr_handbook.pdf|archivedate=31 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many laws also prohibit termination, even of at-will employees. For example, [[whistleblower]] laws may protect an employee who reports a legal or safety violation by the employer to an appropriate oversight agency. Most states prohibit employers from firing employees in retaliation for filing a workers' compensation claim, or making a wage complaint over unpaid wages.

==Canada==
In Canadian law, absent a written contract which addresses how to end the employment relationship, the law implies into the employment relationship a term that it will not be ended without "notice" of its termination.

Notice is advanced warning an employer must provide an employee that their employment will be terminated. It is measured in units of time. The employer has the option to provide one of two kinds of notice:
# working notice, or
# pay in lieu of notice

If an adjudicator determines a dismissal was unjust, the employer may be ordered to reinstate the employee with or without compensation for lost wages, pay compensation for lost wages without reinstating the employee, or do anything that is equitable to remedy any consequences of the dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/labour-standards/reports/unjust-dismissal.html#h2.6|title=Unjust Dismissal|last=|first=|date=|website=Government of Canada|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Working notice ===

Working notice is legal in Canada. Therefore, if the employee is provided a reasonable amount of working notice, the employer owes the employee no additional money.

=== Pay in lieu of notice ===

Pay in lieu of notice, sometimes referred to as termination pay, is the amount of money the employer must pay the employee if the employer seeks to immediately terminate the employee without working notice.

=== Notice is measured in two different ways: statutory notice and common law "reasonable notice". ===

Employees may be entitled to either statutory or reasonable notice, which ever is greater, but at the very minimum, must receive statutory notice. Provincial legislation such as Ontario's Employment Standards Act, delineates statutory notice by way of a formula.

Reasonable notice, on the other hand, has no formula. The [[common law]] dictates how much reasonable notice an employee is entitled to.[http://www.slaw.ca/2015/11/29/the-new-bardal-factors-may-just-be-the-old-bardal-factors/] In this regard, the length of reasonable notice depends on a number of factors, best described by [[James Chalmers McRuer|McRuer CJHC]] in the 1960 Ontario decision of ''Bardal v Globe &amp; Mail'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Bardal v Globe &amp; Mail|vol= 24|reporter= DLR (2d)|opinion= 140|pinpoint= 145|court= Ont. H.C.|date= 1960|url= |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There could be no catalogue laid down as to what was reasonable notice in particular classes of cases. The reasonableness of the notice must be decided with reference to each particular case, having regard to the character of the employment, the length of the service of the servant, the age of the servant and the availability of similar employment, having regard to the experience, training and qualifications of the servant.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the so-called "Bardal Factors" feature in hundreds of cases, predictive modeling is now possible.[http://www.bardalfactors.ca/new-blog/2017/11/16/predictive-analytics-what-are-they] Notwithstanding the above, the courts are open to creative interpretations of reasonable notice. For example, if an employee was persuaded to leave a job to come to another (i.e. inducement), the courts may take that into account in calculating the employee’s length of service and thus drastically increase the notice period.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] has significantly expanded the scope of wrongful dismissal in Canadian jurisprudence:

:*''[[Wallace v United Grain Growers Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Wallace v United Grain Growers Ltd|link=Wallace v United Grain Growers Ltd|year=1997|court=scc|num=332|format=canlii|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[1997] 3 SCR 701|date=1997-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; holds that extra damages will be recoverable when an employer handles a termination in circumstances that constitute [[bad faith]];
:* ''[[Honda Canada Inc v Keays]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Honda Canada Inc v Keays|link=Honda Canada Inc v Keays|year=2008|court=scc|num=39|format=|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[2008] 2 SCR 362|date=2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; incorporated ''[[Hadley v Baxendale]]''&lt;ref&gt;where a breaching party is [[liable]] for all losses that the contracting parties should have foreseen, but is not liable for any losses that the breaching party could not have foreseen on the information available to him.&lt;/ref&gt; into Canadian employment law, as well as holding that awards are not affected by the type of position an employee may have had;
:* ''[[Seneca College v Bhadauria]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Seneca College v Bhadauria|link=Seneca College v Bhadauria|year=1981|court=scc|num=29|format=canlii|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[1981] 2 SCR 181|date=1981-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; holds that human rights violations do not constitute independent actionable wrongs in wrongful dismissal cases, and they must be pursued through the separate schemes provided under human rights legislation.
:* ''[[Wilson v Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Wilson v Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd|link=Wilson v Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd|year=2016|court=scc|num=29|parallelcite=|date=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides that, where a jurisdiction provides a remedy for terminations arising from [[unjust dismissal]], it cannot be displaced through [[severance package]]s (with connected [[Legal release|release]]s) provided by an employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Fine|first= Sean|date= July 14, 2016|title= Supreme Court ruling protects federally regulated workers from unfair dismissal|url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/supreme-court-rules-federally-regulated-workers-have-protection-against-unfair-dismissal/article30913518/|newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]]|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170515042607/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/supreme-court-rules-federally-regulated-workers-have-protection-against-unfair-dismissal/article30913518/|archivedate= 15 May 2017|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An employer is entitled to dismiss an employee according to the terms of the employment contract. There are oral employment contracts, and written employment contracts, and combinations of oral and written employment contracts. In Canadian common law, there is a basic distinction as to dismissals. There are two basic types of dismissals, or terminations: dismissal with cause and termination without cause. An example of cause would be an employee's behaviour which constitutes a fundamental breach of the terms of the employment contract. Where cause exists, the employer can dismiss the employee without providing any notice. If no cause exists yet the employer dismisses without providing lawful notice, then the dismissal is a wrongful dismissal. A wrongful dismissal will allow the employee to claim monetary damages in an amount that compensates the employee for the wages, commissions, bonuses, profit sharing and other such emoluments the employee would have earned or received during the lawful notice period, minus earnings from new employment obtained during the lawful notice period. In Canadian employment law, in those jurisdictions where a remedy for [[unjust dismissal]] is not available, it has long been the rule that reinstatement is not a remedy available to either the employer or the employee{{em dash}}damages must be paid instead.

Although Canadian employment law provides some of the above remedies, each (provincial) jurisdiction may treat employment law differently. It is important to determine which jurisdiction the employment occurs in or is regulated by, then seek appropriate legal advice relevant to that jurisdiction and its particular employment laws.

'''Yrjö Waldemar Vesa''' (12 April 1898 — 4 December 1967) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[engineer]], [[businessman]] and [[vuorineuvos]].

Vesa was born and he did his studies in [[Helsinki]]. Following his graduation as [[Mechanical Engineer]] in 1921 he worked in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] and United States in [[engineering]] and [[automotive]] companies. He returned in Finland in 1927 working for the following five years for [[Tampella|Tampereen Pellava- ja Rauta-Teollisuus Oy]] in [[Tampere]].

Yrjö Vesa started his career in Helsinki-based engineering company [[Kone ja Silta]] in 1932. The company was taken over by [[Wärtsilä]] and by time Vesa became manager of Kone ja Silta, and subsequently he was Deputy Director of Wärtsilä until 1947.

During the 1930s and 1940s Vesa was board member and later chairman of the Finnish Employers' Central Association (STK). His most difficult time as negotiator was after the [[World War II]], when [[communist]]s organised several [[Strike action|strikes]] and reached for weight in companies.

Yrjö Vesa became the first manager of state-owned [[Valmet]]. He was involved at starting [[Valmet tractor|tractor]] and [[paper machine]] production, which later grew flourishing businesses. The company's [[shipyard]]s created problems, and when the board wanted to produce ships unprofitably due to employment reasons, Vesa was against it, and became subsequently fired. For the rest of his career he managed an [[insurance company]].

== Early years and studies ==
Vesa's parents were Matti Viktor Vesa and Maria Theresia [[née]] Gustafsson. He did studied in [[Helsingin normaalilyseo|Helsinki Finnish Normal Lyceum]] and did his [[Matriculation exam (Finland)|matriculation exam]] in 1917. Vesa continued his studies in [[Helsinki University of Technology|Finnish University of Technology]] and graduated [[Diplomi-insinööri|MSc]] in [[Mechanical Engineering]] in 1921.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt;

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
Already during his studies, in 1919–1920, Vesa had worked as manager of Motor Battalion workshop; he worked as depot manager in 1921–1922. At the same time he worked in patent office under [[Ministry of Trade and Industry (Finland)|Ministry of Trade and Industry]]. In 1922 Vesa moved to [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] where he worked as workshop engineer for [[Siemens-Schuckert|Siemens-Schuckert-Werke GmbH]] and [[Protos of Nonnendamm|Protos Automobile GmbH]] in 1922–1924. In 1925 Vesa moved to the United States where he first worked as [[mechanic]] at H. Drexler in [[New York City]], then he became [[draftsman]] at [[American Machine and Foundry|American Machine &amp; Foundry Co.]] in [[Brooklyn]]. Still in the same year he changed to [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric Co.]] where he worked as draftsman until 1926. During 1926–1927 he was employed by Columbus Die &amp; Tool Co. in [[Columbus, Ohio]] as special tool designer. Vesa returned in Finland in 1927. During 1927–1932 Vesa worked as workshop engineer for [[Tampella|Tampereen Pellava- ja Rauta-Teollisuus Oy]] in [[Tampere]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt;

=== Kone- ja Siltarakennus and Wärtsilä ===
In 1932 Vesa changed to [[Kone- ja Siltarakennus]] (Kone ja Silta), a Helsinki-based engineering company. He started as manager of [[Separator (milk)|separator]] workshop. Vesa was appointed [[Technical Manager]] in 1934. In 1935 the company was taken over by [[Wärtsilä]]. The Wärtsilä manager [[Wilhelm Wahlforss]] trusted Vesa who had a similar vivid temper and style of making decisions quickly. Wahlforss first made him Deputy Director and in the end of 1936 Vesa was appointed Manager of Kone ja Silta. In spring 1939 Vesa participated in Wärtsilä trade negotiations with [[Soviet Union]]. The negotiations were successful, the company was to get orders for [[steamships]], [[Pulp (paper)|pulp]] [[Boiler (power generation)|boilers]] and steam boilers, but the [[Winter War]], that bursted out in the same year, cancelled the agreement.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt;

In 1942, during the [[Continuation War]], Wahlforss appointed Vesa Deputy Manager of Wärtsilä Group. Running up and managing military supply production kept Vesa busy. After the war ended to [[Moscow Armistice]], Vesa negotiated about [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union|war reparations]] as representative of the Finnish war reparation industry.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt;

=== Employers' organisation ===
During 1937–1941 Vesa had been deputy chairman in Finnish Engineering Industry Employers' Association and Deputy Board member of the Finnish Employers' Central Association (STK). Wahlforss had been member of board of STK since 1931 and Deputy Chairman in 1937–1942. Despite of requests, he did not want to become chairman. In 1941 Vesa became actual board member of STK and in 1942 he was selected as a chairman. The association manager, [[Antti Hackzell]], was a close friend of Wahlforss and Wärtsilä board member. The strong presence of engineering industry, and Wärtsilä in particular, caused concern amongst the STK [[Forest industry in Finland|forest industry]] representatives, who accused the engineering industry about coup d'état.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt;

In January 1940 STK and the [[trade union]] [[Finnish Federation of Trade Unions]] (SAK) officially recognised each other as representative, negotiating parties. Since then, the employers' side had been expecting initiatives from the union. In spring 1943 SAK proposed a general agreement. The negotiations began with meetings between chairmen of both parties. At the beginning of the process Vesa tried to exclude [[collective agreement]] from the package, but eventually failed; the pressure from the union side was high, and finally, in spring 1944, Vesa had to sign the general agreement, which included a collective agreement.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt;

After the war against Soviet Union ended in September 1944, labour disputed bursted out as number of legal and illegal [[Strike action|strikes]]. This created challenges to the war reparations industry which had to follow the strict schedule set in the armistice. Moreover, the strikes often included volatile [[Demonstration (protest)|demonstrations]], which were feared to escalate [[riot]]s leading communists rising to power.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt;

A critical occasion took place in [[Turku]] in spring 1945 when workers of [[Crichton-Vulcan]] shipyard started [[overtime ban]]. According to the armistice, the yard capacity was prioritised to [[Soviet Navy]] vessels which were needed in the Soviet [[East Pomeranian Offensive]]. Many of the Soviet vessels brought to the yard, mostly [[submarine]]s, were severely damaged. The yard workers were tired because of the intense workload and required a such increase to their salaries that it would assure livelihood by normal working hours.&lt;ref name="Knorring: s.119-125"&gt;{{cite book |last1=von Knorring |first1=Nils |title= Aurajoen veistämöt ja telakat |trans-title=Aurajoki boatworks and shipyards |year=1995 |publisher=Schildts Förlags Ab |location=Espoo, Finland |language=Finnish |isbn=951-50-0735-6 |pages=119–125 |chapter=Sodan jälkeen }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet military leadership had no understanding towards Finnish labour disputes. [[Prime Minister of Finland|Prime minister]] [[Paasikivi]] was afraid that Soviet Union would even occupy Finland if the dispute would not be resolved; he called Vesa into his office and told him that the union action must be ended at any cost. Vesa went directly to meet the communist [[Minister of the Interior (Finland)|Minister of the Interior]], [[Yrjö Leino]], who had been his classmate in the Normal Lyceum. Leino made him a document that included an order to end the action. After Vesa showed the paper in Turku&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt; the overtime ban was withdrawn in March 1945.&lt;ref name="Knorring: s.119-125"/&gt;

Communist minister [[Yrjö Murto]] suggested creating production committees at workplaces. The employers saw it as an attempt to promote [[socialism]]. The employers started countermeasures under Vesa's lead, and finally the Production Committee Act introduced in 1946 defined the committees purely advisory.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt;

The intense war reparation industry required professional leadership, which was not sufficiently available. Vesa initiated founding of industrial management institute in STK board meeting in 1945. STK collected the funding and the Management Institute of Industry was started already in the following year when it organised ten management courses. Vesa also criticised the contemporary [[Education in Finland|Finnish school system]] in which the children were put to select the line of their studies at an early stage. He suggested creating a such school which would give basic education for the whole generation.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt;

In 1947 Vesa was awarded [[vuorineuvos]] title due to his contribution as company and employers' association. He worked as STK chairman until 1947 when he started as manager in newly formed [[Valmet|Valtion Metallitehtaat]] (State Metalworks) company and he was forced to give up his position in STK; this was due to demand of the political left wing, which at first did not accept membership of employers' association for managers of the state owned companies.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt;

=== From State Metalworks to Valmet ===
When Yrjö Vesa started as manager of Valtion Metallitehtaat, it was a miscellaneous group of small companies which had been collected together in 1946. The companies had produced military supplies during the wartime after which they had focused on war reparations. Management and administration of a such arrangement turned out to be problematic, and therefore the state put them under one company, Valmet Oy, which was founded at the end of 1950.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt;

Vesa was involved at starting [[Valmet tractor|tractor]] and [[paper machine]] production; these divisions grew later successful lines of business.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt;

The Valmet shipyards caused a lot of problems. During the war they had operated as repairs yards and for the war reparations they had built such ships which other yards had refused to produce. After the war reparations were paid off the yards did not have enough of orders. The government pressed Valmet to produce ships to Soviet Union with unprofitable prices due to employment reasons. The company board decided that the Helsinki yard must get enough of orders from Soviet Union even if they would not be profitable, or cover all the costs. Vesa stood against such business and subsequently he was removed from office in 1954.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt;

After Valmet, Vesa worked for over ten years as manager for Teollisuuden Auto- ja vastuuvakuutus (Vehicle and Liability Insurance Company of Industry) in 1954–1965.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Yrjö Vesa"/&gt;
