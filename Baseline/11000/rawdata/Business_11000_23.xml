He has major holdings and close political relationships in [[Kazakhstan]].  He holds both Kazakh and [[Israel]]i citizenship; according to the [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]], he usually travels on his Israeli passport and "rarely spends more than a week each month in Kazakhstan."&lt;ref name="Krichevsky"&gt;{{cite web|last=Krichevsky |first=Lev |date=18 October 2004 |url=http://www.ncsj.org/AuxPages/101804JTA_Mashkevich.shtml |title=Wealthy Kazakh businessman looks to make mark on Jewish world |work=www.ncsj.org |publisher=''[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]'' |accessdate=2007-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026091634/http://www.ncsj.org/AuxPages/101804JTA_Mashkevich.shtml |archivedate=26 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Mashkevich was born in [[Bishkek|Frunze]], [[Kyrgyz SSR]], [[Soviet Union]], in 1954. His father Anton, a doctor born in [[Lithuania]], and his mother, Rakhel Yoffe, a lawyer born in [[Vitebsk]], were evacuated to Kyrgyzstan in 1941.&lt;ref name="tengrin"/&gt; His family background is [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian Jewish]]. He is a graduate of Kyrgyz State University where he studied [[philology]]. Mashkevich started out an academic career but became a businessman during [[perestroika]]. Mashkevich, [[Patokh Chodiev]], and [[Alijan Ibragimov]] form "the Trio," a group of Kazakh businessmen who became billionaires.&lt;ref name="Krichevsky"/&gt; The Trio gained control of the recently privatized [[chromium]], [[alumina]], and [[gas]] operations in Kazakhstan (some of the largest ones in the world).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=24 July 2002|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2146757.stm|title=The Steel Maharajah|work=BBC|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kazhegeldin|first=Akezhan|date=December 24, 2004|url=http://iicas.org/2004en/publ_30_12_04.htm|title=The end of the "controlled" democracy|work="Respublika"|publisher=International Eurasian Institute for Economic and Political Research|accessdate=2006-05-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060506041451/http://iicas.org/2004en/publ_30_12_04.htm| archivedate= 6 May 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his partners Chodiev and Ibragimov, Mashkevich helped to develop these assets, and is a major shareholder in [[Eurasian National Resources Corporation]] (ENRC), now one of the world's leading natural resources groups. ENRC, based in London, operates a number of metals assets in Kazakhstan and Africa, having acquired numerous mining operations in [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Africa]].  In 2009, ENRC generated a $1,462 million profit on sales of $3.8 billion.

ENRC was floated on the [[London Stock Exchange]] in December 2007, with a market capitalisation on Admission of approximately £6.8 billion.

Mashkevich served as president of the Euro-Asian Jewish Congress (EAJC) until 2011. The EAJC is one of the five regional branches of [[World Jewish Congress|World Jewish Congress (WJC)]]. In this capacity, he has visited a number of [[synagogue]]s around the world and met with many prominent individuals. In 2002, Mashkevich had a private meeting with then-Foreign Minister [[Shimon Peres]].&lt;ref name="Galili"&gt;{{cite web|last=Galili |first=Lily |date=29 October 2002 |url=http://www.ncsj.org/AuxPages/102902Haaretz.shtml |title=A Kazakh Oligarch Trying To Be a Jewish Tycoon |work=www.ncsj.org |publisher=''[[Ha'aretz]]'' |accessdate=2007-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011232308/http://www.ncsj.org/AuxPages/102902Haaretz.shtml |archivedate=11 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In apparent consultation with Israeli Defense Minister [[Binyamin Ben-Eliezer]], he asked his personal friend Kazakh President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] to intervene with [[Iran]] concerning Israeli soldiers captured by [[Hizbullah]].&lt;ref name="Galili"/&gt; Also, while in Israel, Mashkevich "several times rather closely cooperated" with Kazakh Ambassador, now Deputy Foreign Minister, Kairat Abdurakhmanov.&lt;ref name="Rozen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rozen|first=Sami|date=March 9, 2006|url=http://www.axisglobe.com/article.asp?article=722|title=Kazakh Historian Turned Deputy Minister After Stay in Israel|work=www.axisglobe.com|publisher=''Axis''|accessdate=2007-02-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070303031635/http://www.axisglobe.com/article.asp?article=722| archivedate= 3 March 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American-Hawaiian Steamship Company''' was founded in 1899 to carry cargos of [[sugar]] from [[Hawaii]] to the [[United States]] and manufactured goods back to Hawaii. Brothers-in-law George Dearborn and [[Lewis Henry Lapham]] were the key players in the founding of the company. The company began in 1899 with three ships, operated nine by 1904 and was operating seventeen by 1911 with three on order.{{sfn|Johnson|1912|p=8}}

At the time of the company's founding, its steamships sailed around South America via the [[Straits of Magellan]] to reach the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] ports. By 1907, the company began using the Mexican [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] Route.{{sfn|Johnson|1912|p=8}} Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route would transship at Atlantic port of [[Coatzacoalcos]] (formerly Puerto) or the Pacific port of [[Salina Cruz]] and would traverse the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on the {{convert|310|km|mi|1}} [[Tehuantepec National Railway]].{{sfn|Heubner|p=102}}{{sfn|Hovey|p=84}} The contract, binding until completion of the Panama Canal, with American-Hawaiian for its entire cargo moving between oceans and assuring a minimum of 500,000 tons of sugar and other cargo was important in the railway's economic plans from its beginning.{{sfn|Hovey|pp=82, 83}} For the steamship line the Tehuantepec route enabled the company to serve both a New York—Honolulu route and a coastal route from Salina Cruz to Pacific ports of the United States.{{sfn|Hovey|p=82}} With new ships to be delivered the company planned to have four 8,000 ton ships on the New York—Coatzacoalcos route, six 12,000 ton ships operating on the Salina Cruz—Honolulu route and two 6,000 ton ships serving the West Coast route.{{sfn|Hovey|pp=82, 84}}

Company ships were used on both the Pacific and Atlantic routes.{{sfn|Heubner}} When American political troubles with Mexico closed that route, American-Hawaiian returned to the Straits of Magellan route.

When the [[Panama Canal]] opened for traffic in August 1914, American-Hawaiian began routing all of its ships via this route. The temporary closure of the canal because of a series of landslides forced the company to return to the Straits of Magellan route for the third time in its history.

During [[World War I]], twelve of the company's ships were [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] into the [[United States Navy]]; a further five were sunk by submarines or mines during the conflict.

[[Roger Dearborn Lapham]], a future mayor of [[San Francisco, California]], served as company president in the mid-1920s.

During [[World War II]], the company operated ships under the War Shipping Administration, some of which were company owned and taken over by WSA as was ''Nebraskan'', and others wartime built and delivered directly to WSA for operation by commercial agents including ''Benjamin Goodhue'', ''[[SS Chanute Victory]]'', ''John Milledge'', ''John Drake Sloat'', and [[USNS Private Leonard C.

Kenyon and Daniel Feakes, ''The Creation of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons: A Case Study in the Birth of an Intergovernmental Organisation'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007: {{ISBN|9067042412}}), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; (at its founding in 1872&lt;ref&gt;Manufacturing Chemists' Association, ''The Chemical Industry Facts Book'' (Manufacturing Chemists' Association, Inc., 1961), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;) and then as the '''Chemical Manufacturers' Association'''&lt;ref&gt;Cary Coglianese and Jennifer Nash, ''Regulating from the Inside: Can Environmental Management Systems Achieve Policy Goals?'' (Resources for the Future, 2001: {{ISBN|1-891853-41-4}}), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; (from 1978 until 2000&lt;ref&gt;Brian Rothery, ''Standards and Certification in Europe'' (Gower, 1996: {{ISBN|0-566-07644-6}}), p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Perrow, ''The Next Catastrophe: Reducing Our Vulnerabilities to Natural, Industrial, and Terrorist Disasters'' (Princeton University Press, 2007: {{ISBN|0-691-12997-5}}), p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;), is an industry [[trade association]] for American chemical companies, based in [[Washington, D.C.]]

==Activities==
[[File:Albatross at Midway Atoll Refuge (8080507529).jpg|thumb|In 2011, the ACC was a major sponsor of the 5th International Marine Debris Conference which endorsed the [[Honolulu Commitment]] to reduce harmful plastics in the environment&lt;ref&gt;[https://5imdc.wordpress.com/ Fifth International Marine Debris Conference], 5imdc.org. URL accessed February 18, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;]]The mission of the American Chemistry Council is to promote the interests of companies engaged in the [[chemical industry|business of chemistry]]. The trade group represents US chemical companies as well as the plastics and chlorine industries, formerly known as the [[American Plastics Council]], the Center for the Polyurethanes Industry and the Chlorine Chemistry Council.

The ACC implemented the [[Responsible Care]] program in 1988. At least 52 countries have implemented this initiative. It is managed at a global level by the [[International Council of Chemical Associations]].

The ACC has a [[political action committee]] that gives money to members of the [[Congress of the United States]].

The ACC launched a $35 million "essential2" public relations campaign in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases-test/american-chemistry-council-celebrates-launch-of-essential2-campaign-55421652.html |title=American Chemistry Council Celebrates Launch of 'essential2'  |publisher=Prnewswire.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; "essential2" attempted to improve the industry's image by emphasizing the importance of chemical industry products&amp;nbsp;– especially [[plastic]]s&amp;nbsp;– to everyday life, and by using the term "American Chemistry" rather than "[[chemical]] industry". The ACC later shifted to a more directed lobbying and policy-shaping effort,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanchemistry.com/Media/PressReleasesTranscripts/ACC-news-releases/ACC-Launches-New-PlatformHighlights-Innovation-Jobs-and-Safety.html |title=ACC Launches New Platform&amp;nbsp;– Highlights Innovation, Jobs and Safety |publisher=Americanchemistry.com |date=2011-05-24 |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; including taking legal action against federal efforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/News/2013/04_-_April/Supreme_Court_asked_to_hear_EPA_greenhouse_gas_challenge/ |title=Supreme Court asked to hear EPA greenhouse gas challenge |publisher=Newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com |date=2013-04-22 |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some critics{{who|date=October 2011}} believe that the Responsible Care program is intended to help the industry avoid regulation by imposing its own safety and environmental regulations, and to improve its [[public relations|public image]] in the wake of the 1984 [[Bhopal disaster]].  Defenders{{who|date=October 2011}} of the Responsible Care standard claim the program has improved safety and that its standards are higher than some [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] regulations.

[[Environmentalist]]s and those concerned about the health effects of chemicals in the environment traditionally oppose the ACC's initiatives.  They view campaigns like "essential2" as efforts to distract public attention away from products and practices that they view as harmful and dangerous.  Among the most vocal opponents are groups such as [[Pesticide Action Network]] and [[Environmental Working Group]].

The American Chemistry Council is involved in and shaping [[public policy]] discussions when necessary to defend its members' special needs from the effects of legislation. This has proven particularly true when the public interest points to changes in industry practice that might be detrimental to the relative financial success of members.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} By combining funds from the collective [[chemical industry]] as a whole and then using this money to steer public debate, the American Chemistry Council has repeatedly demonstrated its efficiency at obtaining outcomes favorable for the special interests of the chemical industry.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Sometime in 2008, the ACC launched a campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpafacts.org/ |title=Facts About BPA |publisher=Bpafacts.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; to oppose [[California State Legislature|California]] SB1713&amp;nbsp;– a bill to ban [[bisphenol A]] statewide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislature.ca.gov/cgi-bin/port-postquery?bill_number=sb_1713&amp;sess=CUR&amp;house=B&amp;author=migden |title=Bill Document |publisher=Legislature.ca.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– including bulk postal mailings in July and August encouraging California citizens to demand opposition of their representing legislators.

The American Chemistry Council's stance on chemical regulation was heavily criticized in the 2015 documentary [[Stink!]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stink! The Movie The Chemical Industry Doesn't Want You To See|url=https://stinkmovie.com/|website=Stink! Movie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plastic bag regulation==
The ACC was heavily engaged in fighting governmental restrictions and bans on [[plastic shopping bag]]s.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The [[phase-out of lightweight plastic bags]] has been proposed or implemented in many countries since 2002. In the United States, in July 2008, the [[Seattle City Council]] voted to impose an additional 20 cent fee on each [[plastic bag]] purchased from stores by shoppers as a convenience for transportation of goods. This effort was suspended until a referendum could be held in 2009, allowing voters a chance to weigh in on the issue of whether they should continue to be encouraged to support industry by purchasing plastic bags without considering disposal costs. During the period leading up to the referendum vote the American Chemistry Council stepped into this local affair, ultimately spending some $1.4 million on their successful effort to thwart the proposed system of [[full cost accounting|fully accounting for the cost]] of plastic bags. Seattle in 2012 overcame ACC objections and successfully enacted a bag ban.

In 2010 the ACC was quoted by ''[[The New York Times]]'' in opposition to a California bill to outlaw plastic bags, claiming that new law "amounts to a $1 billion tax added to [Californian's] grocery bills."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/03/science/earth/03bags.html | work=The New York Times | first=Felicity | last=Barringer | title=In California, a Step Toward B.Y.O.B. (Bring Your Own Bag) | date=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But subsequent ACC efforts to prevent adoption of municipal ordinances banning plastic bags have not been successful. Over ACC opposition, San Jose, California, in 2010 adopted California's strictest ban. The ordinance, in effect since 2012, prohibits supermarkets, pharmacies, corner shops and others from distributing single-use plastic bags, with fines for violations. Retailers can sell [[paper bag]]s made of 40 percent recycled materials for 10 cents each, gradually increasing to 25 cents by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/green/article/San-Jose-OKs-state-s-toughest-ban-on-plastic-bags-2453280.php |title=San Jose OKs state's toughest ban on plastic bags |publisher=SFGate |date=2010-12-15 |accessdate=2013-06-17 |first=Kelly |last=Zito}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, California voters approved a statewide ban on carry-out plastic bags.&lt;ref name="cal-16"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luna|first1=Taryn|title=Californians say farewell to the plastic bag|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article113898813.html|accessdate=21 February 2018|work=The Sacramento Bee|date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word '''AMGen''' is a [[portmanteau]] of the company's original name, '''A'''pplied '''M'''olecular '''Gen'''etics, which became the official name of the company in 1983 (three years after incorporation and coincident with its [[initial public offering]]). The company's first [[chief executive officer]], from 1980, was co-founder [[George Rathmann|George B. Rathmann]], followed by [[Gordon Binder|Gordon M.

The company has made at least five major [[Mergers and acquisitions|corporate acquisitions]].

==Timeline==
*1980. William Bowes from Cetus Corporation recruits Winston Salser from UCLA to start Amgen with a scientific advisory board consisting of [[Norman Davidson (biologist)|Normam Davidson]], [[Leroy Hood]], [[Arnold Berk]], [[John Carbon]], [[Robert Schimke]], [[Arno Motulsky]], [[Marvin H. Caruthers]], and Dave Gibson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amgen—A biotechnology success story {{!}} From drug development to the mass market|url=https://www.marsdd.com/mars-library/amgen-a-biotechnology-success-story-from-drug-development-to-the-mass-market/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1989. Amgen received approval for the first recombinant human erythropoetin product, Epogen, for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney failure. Epogen (also marketed by Johnson and Johnson under the tradename Procrit) would later be approved for anemia due to cancer chemotherapy, anemia due to treatment with certain HIV drugs, and for the reduction of the need for transfusions associated with surgery.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.Set_Current_Drug&amp;ApplNo=103795&amp;DrugName=ENBREL&amp;ActiveIngred=ETANERCEPT&amp;SponsorApplicant=IMMUNEX&amp;ProductMktStatus=1&amp;goto=Search.DrugDetails |title=Drugs@FDA: FDA Approved Drug Products |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1998. In November 1998, Immunex, a future acquisition of Amgen, received approval for Enbrel (etanercept), the first rheumatoid arthritis drug targeting tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; A 2006 assessment by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence of the United Kingdom concluded that etanercept and related rheumatoid arthritis drugs later introduced by competitors "are effective treatments compared with placebo for RA patients who are not well controlled by conventional DMARDs, improving control of symptoms, improving physical function, and slowing radiographic changes in joints."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen YF, Jobanputra P, Barton P |title=A systematic review of the effectiveness of adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults and an economic evaluation of their cost-effectiveness |journal=Health Technol Assess |volume=10 |issue=42 |pages=iii–iv, xi–xiii, 1–229 |date=November 2006 |pmid=17049139 |doi= 10.3310/hta10420|url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent study demonstrated that compared to traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, treatment with etanercept improved survival, reduced cardiovascular events and reduced the incidence of hematological cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morgan CL, Emery P, Porter D |title=Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with etanercept with reference to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs: long-term safety and survival using prospective, observational data |journal=Rheumatology (Oxford) |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=186–94 |date=January 2014 |pmid=24140761 |doi=10.1093/rheumatology/ket333 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 2012. Illegal marketing practices. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported on December 18, 2012, that AMGEN pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $150 million in criminal penalty and $612 million to resolve 11 related [[whistleblower]] complaints.

==Biography==
Born on 9 January 1977 in Gaitania, [[Planadas]], in the Colombian department of [[Tolima Department|Tolima]], Astrid Medina Pereira is the daughter of Aureliano Medina Arce and Rosalba Pereira. She is the fifth in a family of 14 children.&lt;ref name=ace/&gt; Following in the footsteps of her paternal grandfather and her father, who introduced her to coffee farming when she was 14, Medina graduated in agricultural production technology at [[National Service of Learning (Colombia)|Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje]] (SENA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/colombia/otras-ciudades/cultivadores-de-cafe-del-tolima-exportan-su-grano-a-nivel-mundial-139594|title=En medio de la guerra, Astrid cultivó un café de talla mundial|author=Ibagué|publisher=''El Tiempo''|date=10 October 2017|accessdate=10 April 2018 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=collab&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collaborativecoffeesource.com/the-collaborative-blog/2018/3/13/astrid-medina-en-sus-propias-palabras|title=Astrid Medina en sus propias palabras|publisher=Collaborative Coffee Source|date=13 March 2018|accessdate=10 April 2018|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, together with three younger siblings, she inherited the Buena Vista farm from her father who had been killed by Marxist rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.datamark.com.br/en/news/2017/2/peace-deal-may-help-colombia-to-produce-more-coffee-225318/|title=Peace deal may help Colombia to produce more coffee|author=Willis, Andrew|publisher=Bloomberg|date=14 February 2017|accessdate=10 April 2018 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother and one of her brothers had died earlier when they were swept into the river by a landslide near their home.&lt;ref name=bw&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/philippines/business-world/20150430/281694023332524|title=Colombian coffee from former rebel territory stands out at auction|publisher=''Business World''|date=30 April 2015|accessdate=10 April 2018 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The farm is now owned by Medina, her husband Raúl Antonio Durán (who also comes from a family of local coffee farmers) and her younger sister.&lt;ref name=ace/&gt;&lt;ref name=collab/&gt; At an altitude of over {{Convert|1,800|m|ft}}, it is located in a remote region of southern Tolima which until recently was not popular with coffee buyers as a result of conflicts with guerrillas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hub.cropster.com/store/listings/1589|title=Astrid Medina #10|publisher=Cropster|accessdate=10 April 2018 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Medina started to produce speciality coffee under a scheme for developing late-harvest coffee launched by the [[National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia|National Federation of Coffee Growers]]. On 13 March 2015, she won the annual Cup of Excellence award for Colombian coffee in a ceremony held in [[Ibagué]], the departmental capital of Tolima.&lt;ref name=perga/&gt; The judges commented on the coffee's "creamy body with sweet and fruity notes".&lt;ref name=bw/&gt; Medina subsequently reported that the award had changed her life, as her speciality coffee sold for over 10 times the normal price of [[Coffea arabica|Arabica]]. The profits have allowed her to improve the farm's infrastructure, to travel abroad and to offer her children a good education.&lt;ref name=collab/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cafedecolombia.com/cci-fnc-es/index.php/comments/caficultora_de_tolima_recibio_en_subasta_coe_10_veces_el_precio_de_mercado_|title=Caficultora de Tolima recibió en subasta CoE 10 veces el precio de mercado por su café|publisher=Café de Colombia|date=April 2015|accessdate=10 April 2018 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** Book abstract: "The [[Seagram building]] rises over New York's [[Park Avenue]], seeming to float above the street with perfect lines of bronze and glass. Considered one of the greatest icons of twentieth-century architecture, the building was commissioned by [[Samuel Bronfman]], founder of the Canadian distillery dynasty Seagram. Bronfman's daughter [[Phyllis Lambert]] was twenty-seven years old when she took over the search for an architect and chose [[Mies van der Rohe]] (1886-1969), a pioneering modern master of what he termed "skin and bones" architecture. Mies, who designed the elegant, deceptively simple thirty-eight story tower along with [[Philip Johnson]] (1906-2005), emphasized the beauty of structure and fine materials, and set the building back from the avenue, creating an urban oasis with the building's plaza. Through her choice, Lambert established her role as a leading architectural patron and singlehandedly changed the face of American urban architecture. Building Seagram is a comprehensive personal and scholarly history of a major building and its architectural, cultural, and urban legacies. Lambert makes use of previously unpublished personal archives, company correspondence, and photographs to tell an insider's view of the debates, resolutions, and unknown dramas of the building's construction, as well as its crucial role in the history of modern art and architectural culture."&lt;ref name=WorldCat-BuildingSeagram&gt;{{cite web|title=Building Seagram|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/building-seagram/oclc/813392773|work=WorldCat|publisher=OCLC|accessdate=25 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gerardus Jozef Dusseldorp''' {{post-nominals|country=USA-cats|AO}} (2 December 1918{{spaced ndash}}22 April 2000) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[engineer]] and the founder of [[Civil and Civic]], the financing arm of which later emerged as [[Lend Lease Corporation]], one of [[Australia]]'s largest companies.

==Career==
Born in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] in the [[Netherlands]] in December 1918,&lt;ref name=book&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1YBcy4lR1RwC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=Dick+Dusseldorp&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6lhKAlZHXS&amp;sig=eD5AiCs4WEwFFpQjRcy-jF7wo90&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wP5iSqPhMYWhjAfuwKzxDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8 Clark, L. Page 18]&lt;/ref&gt; Gerardus Dusseldorp was known as ''Dik'' as a child, the [[anglicise]]d version of which stuck with him for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, L. Page 19&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], as a [[Netherlands|Dutchman]] of working age, he was deported to [[Berlin]], to work as forced labour.&lt;ref name="Clark, L. Page 22"&gt;Clark, L. Page 22&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to the [[Netherlands]], he secured work with a [[Denmark|Danish]] firm building a railway from [[Copenhagen]] to [[Hamburg]].&lt;ref name="Clark, L. Page 22"/&gt; In late 1943 he was transported to [[Kraków]], again as forced labour but this time for the [[Siemens|Siemens Organisation]].&lt;ref name="Clark, L. Page 22"/&gt; In Summer 1944 he escaped and returned again to the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="Clark, L. Page 22"/&gt;

In 1945 he and his brother Hank secured jobs at ''Bredero's Bouwbedrijf'', a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] housebuilder established in the 1870s.&lt;ref name="Clark, L. Page 24"&gt;Clark, L. Page 24&lt;/ref&gt; By 1947 he had been promoted to Construction Manager.&lt;ref name="Clark, L. Page 24"/&gt; In March 1951 Bredero's sent him to [[Australia]] to seek out business opportunities: there he established [[Civil and Civic]], the success of which was based on the principle that the designer should be employed by the contractor rather than the other way round.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, L. Page 30&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s he undertook residential housing developments such as Harbour Heights Estate and was a competitor of [[Leslie Joseph Hooker]] and [[LJ Hooker|Hooker]]’s housing developments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willoughbydhs.org.au/History/Suburbs/Suburbs-MiddleCove.html Middle Cove].

Houzz. 5 October 2014. Retrieved 1 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 he secured the contract to build the podium for the [[Sydney Opera House]] and, having established his reputation, built the business into an international concern.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, L. Page 31&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to establish a financing arm for [[Civil and Civic]]; this emerged as [[Lend Lease Corporation]] of which he was [[Chairman]] for many years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/money/story/0,26860,24379922-5015795,00.htm Stuart Hornery's illustrious career was shaped by his mentor] Daily Telegraph, 22 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

He eventually retired from the business in 1988 and in retirement became a significant [[philanthropist]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/15/1097784025099.html?from=storylhs Rise and shine] Sydney Morning Herald, 16 October 2004
&lt;/ref&gt; He was the founder of the ''Dusseldorp Skills Forum'', an organisation that develops and advances the innovative practices of those who engage young Australians in acquiring skills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsf.org.au/ Dusseldorp Skills Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; He died in April 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lendlease.com.au/llweb/llc/main.nsf/all/news_20000426 Lend Lease: Death of our Founder]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
On Australia Day 1988 he was appointed an Honorary Officer of the [[Order of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=871004&amp;search_type=simple&amp;showInd=true It's an Honour]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
He was married to Anne and together they went on to have several children.&lt;ref name="Clark, L. Page 22"/&gt; Australian actress [[Marta Dusseldorp]] is his granddaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Keenan |first=Catherine |date=16 October 2004 |title=Rise and Shine |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/15/1097784025099.html |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |access-date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Dusseldorp was the founder of two [[Sydney]] suburbs, one of them being the prestigious [[Middle Cove, New South Wales|Middle Cove]] where the Dusseldorp family lived from 1959 until 2004. The house which Dusseldorp built in [[Middle Cove, New South Wales|Middle Cove]] is one of the top five house designs in Australia: it is based on [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]'s inspirational honeycomb house design and is a good example of [[Organic Architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanessamcalexander.com/middle-cove-1958.html Heritage Study: The Sydney Suburb of Middlecove 2068]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''EFQM Excellence Award''' is a [[List of national quality awards|transnational quality award]] that recognises European businesses with "excellent and sustainable results" across all areas of the [[EFQM Excellence Model]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228599823_The_EFQM_excellence_model_European_and_Dutch_experiences_with_the_EFQM_approach_in_health_care The EFQM excellence model: European and Dutch experiences with the EFQM approach in health care]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3846/13923730.2013.843582 | volume=20 | title=EFQM excellence model as the TQM model of the construction industry of southeastern Europe | year=2014 | journal=Journal of Civil Engineering and Management | pages=70–81 | last1 = Vukomanovic | first1 = Mladen | last2 = Radujkovic | first2 = Mladen | last3 = Marija Nahod | first3 = Maja}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in October 1991 as the [[European Quality Award]] by the European Foundation for Quality Management ([[EFQM]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Evans | first = James R | last2 = Lindsay | first2 = William M | year = 1999 | title = The Management and Control of Quality | chapter = 4: Managing for Quality and High Performance | edition = 4 | publisher = South-Western College Publishing | publication-place = [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, Ohio]] | pages = 143–144 | isbn = 9780538882422 | oclc = 38475486}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The assessment process is one of the most robust of any award, with a team of independent assessors spending an average of 500 hours per applicant reviewing documentation and conducting interviews on-site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zawya.com/mena/en/story/ZAWYA20160615090848/ Sharjah Chamber of Commerce and Industry introduces the Sharjah Top 10 Business Award]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2016}}

== Award Categories ==
The Award is open to organisations from both the Private and Public Sectors.  Applicants will either be recognized as "Finalists", "Prize Winners" or "Award Winners".  An "Award Winner" is an organisation that is able to demonstrate that they are considered a role model for the Fundamental Concepts of Excellence, as defined in the [[EFQM Excellence Model]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infocalidad.net/archives/noticia/el-madrileno-ayuntamiento-de-alcobendas-nominado-al-efqm-excellence-award-2016 El madrileño Ayuntamiento de Alcobendas, nominado al EFQM Excellence Award 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.automobil-produktion.de/technik-produktion/produktionstechnik/efqm-excellence-award-fuer-bmw-regensburg-257.html EFQM Excellence Award für BMW Regensburg]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-39313-qatar-rail-becomes-full-member-of-efqm/ Qatar Rail becomes full member of EFQM]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabianaerospace.aero/emirates-group-security-awarded-the-dubai-quality-award.html Emirates Group Security awarded the Dubai Quality Award]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advertiser.ie/galway/article/37141/galway-bay-hotel-wins-prestigious-efqm-excellence-award Galway Bay Hotel wins prestigious EFQM Excellence award]&lt;/ref&gt;
There are 4 categories:

1.  Large Private Sector (over 1000 employees)

2.  Small / Medium Private Sector (less than 1000 employees)

3.  Large Public Sector (over 1000 employees)

4.  Small / Medium Public Sector (less than 1000 employees)

An independent jury of experts review the applications and the reports from the assessments.  Each year, they can decide to give multiple awards, in line with the Award Categories.  The last time there were multiple winners was 2008, when [[BMW]] won in the Large Private Sector category and St. Mary's College won in the Small / Medium Public Sector category.  However, if no organisation can adequately demonstrate they are a role model, they can decide there is no Award Winner that year.  This last happened in 2010.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

      <comment>Not an entrepreneur - this is a puffery term. She was the heiress to a multi-generational family business.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7413">'''Amalie Luise Elisabeth Haub''' (September 20, 1899 in [[Mülheim an der Ruhr]] &amp;ndash; January 24, 1977 in [[Bonn]]) was a German heiress, [[philanthropist]] and [[environmentalist]].

==Life and work==
Elisabeth was born in 1899 to entrepreneur Karl Schmitz-Scholl Sr. and his wife Elisabeth, née Weynen, in Mülheimer, to what was a merchant family. When her father died in 1933, she and her brother Karl Schmitz-Scholl Jr. inherited their father's company, Unternehmensgruppe Tengelmann, now [[Tengelmann Group|Tengelmann Warenhandelsgesellschaft KG]]. She looked after the business until her brother's return from captivity in 1947. Her son, [[Erivan Haub]] took over in 1969 after Karl Schmitz-Scholl Jr.'s death as he was childless, remaining at the helm for three decades.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cruz|first1=Julie|last2=De Jong|first2=David|title=Tengelmann Billionaire Haub Retires as Outsiders Win Role|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-01-21/tengelmann-billionaire-haub-retires-as-outsiders-win-role|website=Bloomberg|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
To mark the centenary of her father's birth, she founded the Karl Schmitz-Scholl Fund in 1968, a foundation for the promotion of environmental protection.&lt;ref name="KissBurhenne-Guilmin1994"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alexandre Charles Kiss|author2=Françoise Burhenne-Guilmin|title=A Law for the Environment: Essays in Honour of Wolfgang E.

Since 1973, the International Council of Environmental Law (ICEL) and the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]] have annually awarded the Elizabeth Haub Prize for Environmental Law. This task is performed by an international jury consisting of six prominent environment lawyers, which considers the most important diplomatic achievements in the field of environmental law and policy in the preceding year.&lt;ref name="University of Delaware"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boyle|first1=Elizabeth|title=Cicin-Sain named laureate for Haub Award for Environmental Diplomacy|url=http://www.udel.edu/udaily/2011/feb/environmental-diplomacy-021011.html|website=University of Delaware|publisher=University of Delaware|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, this task was taken over by the [[University of Stockholm]]. Since 1998, the ICEL together with [[Pace University]] also award the Elizabeth Haub Prize for Environmental Diplomacy.&lt;ref name="Lausche2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3247">A '''Fluidized Bed Scrubber''' system uses carefully selected hollow [[plastic]] elements of varying shapes, according to the process requirements, to generate a three phase [[fluidized bed]] in which increased [[Reynolds number]]s (turbulence) in the gaseous phase, and the liquid phase, provoke an intense enhancement of turbulent action.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.turboscrubber.com/fba-index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  This is claimed to lead to substantial increases in overall mass and heat transfer coefficients, and interphase surface renewal rates, as compared to classical packings and other scrubbing technologies (see below).

==Particulate removal==
In addition, the fluid bed simultaneously removes [[particulate]]s down to very fine sub half [[micron]] diameters. System design varies from application to application as process operations, or [[pollution control]] needs, vary widely.

==Quenching==
When very hot gases are to be treated and cleaned using the fluidized bed scrubber technology, they are first passed through a quench chamber, which is usually integrated with the scrubber such that [[Quenching (scrubber)|quenching]] can occur in two steps, using both the inlet quench section and a specially designed sump to maximum effect. The cooled gases are then passed on directly to the fluidized bed where ascending gas is intimately mixed by the fluidized packing elements with the descending, and usually recirculated, liquid.

==Applications==
The fluidized bed scrubber system allows operation with [[Slurry|slurries]], [[mud]]s and oily or [[viscous]] liquids due to the claimed 100% non-clogging &lt;ref&gt;http://www.fluid-technologies.com/turbostripper.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ospreycorporation.com/OSP-SCRUB.htm&lt;/ref&gt; nature of the fluidized bed.

==Comparisons==
Below are two real case comparisons of equivalent efficiency alternative technologies commonly used in industrial applications.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.turboscrubber.com/fba-index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

RigneyDolphin's annual turnover in 2006 was €20.2&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="sbp-expansion" /&gt;

In 2007 a new RigneyDolphin call center was opened in Waterford by the then [[Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation|Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment]] [[Micheál Martin]].&lt;ref name="sbp-expansion" /&gt; It cost €5&amp;nbsp;million and can accommodate 400 people.&lt;ref name="indo-jobs"&gt;{{Cite news

In December 2010 RigneyDolphin opened a 300 seat call centre in Derry. The company received £1.2m from [[Invest Northern Ireland]] to fund the new centre. The new call centre, and its potential for employment, received praise from [[Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment]] minister [[Arlene Foster]] and [[Martina Anderson]] of [[Sinn Féin]].&lt;ref name="bbc-derry1" /&gt;

In February 2012 [[Taoiseach]] [[Enda Kenny]] announced that RigneyDolphin would provide patient management, patient outreach and telephone services to the [[Cleveland Clinic]].&lt;ref name="it-cleveland-jobs"&gt;{{Cite news

==Health Service==
In 2009 Dolphin was appointed chairman of [[Children's University Hospital, Temple Street]].&lt;ref name="herald-temple-chairman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="imt-temple"&gt;{{Cite web

In July 2010 the [[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Minister for Health and Children]] [[Mary Harney]] announced that Dolphin would assume the role of Chairman of the [[Health Service Executive]] with effect from 15 August 2010.&lt;ref name="dohc-chairman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="it-hse-chairman" /&gt; Dolphin stepped down from this role in December 2011.&lt;ref name="dohc-review"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.dohc.ie/press/releases/2012/20120316.html |title=Announcement of the composition of the Review Group into the National Paediatric Hospital |publisher=Department of Health and Children |date=16 March 2012 |accessdate=20 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203160302/http://www.dohc.ie/press/releases/2012/20120316.html |archivedate=3 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012 Dolphin was chosen to lead the review group for the construction of [[new children's hospital (Dublin)|a new children's hospital]], following the refusal by [[An Bord Pleanála]] to give planning permission for the proposed Children's Hospital of Ireland at a site on Eccles Street.&lt;ref name="dohc-review" /&gt; [[Enda Kenny]] stated that the report this group put forward (the "Dolphin Report") would be the only one used to decide on the location of the proposed hospital.&lt;ref name="it-only-dolphin-report"&gt;{{Cite news

'''Hans Fugger''' ''von der Lilie'', full name ''Hans, Freiherr Fugger, Herr zu Kirchheim, Glött, Mickhausen, Stettenfels und Schmiechen'', (4 September 1531 - 19 April 1598; buried in [[Kirchheim in Schwaben]]) was a German arts patron, businessman and politician of the [[Fugger]] family.

==Life==
[[File:St. Peter und Paul (Kirchheim in Schwaben) 74.JPG|thumbnail|Epitaph of Hans Fugger, St. Peter and Paul, Kirchheim in Swabia]]
He was the second son of [[Anton Fugger]] (1493–1560) and Anna Rehlinger. As befitted the family's new standing, he and his brothers [[Markus Fugger|Marx]] (1529–1597), Hieronimus (1533–1573) and Jakob (1542–1598) received a cultural and philosophical education as well as a mercantile one. Throughout his life Hans served the family's commercial interests in different areas, ranging from the Netherlands to Spain to his native Augsburg.

After his father Anton's death in 1560 he and his brothers managed the now-substantial family estates and business together. In 1573 the brothers divided the business up between them, with Hans getting (among others) the lands in [[Kirchheim in Schwaben|Kirchheim]], [[Glött]], [[Burg Stettenfels]] and [[Schloss Duttenstein|Duttenstein]]. In 1583 Hans and his brothers had their lands made [[Imperial State]]s in the [[Swabian College of Imperial Counts|Schwäbischen Reichsgrafenkollegium]] and raised to Kreisstand status in the Swabian [[Imperial Circle]]. On his brother Marx's death in 1597, Hans was elected head of the whole Fugger business.

Hans was a great patron of the arts, partly to impress his business clients, showing off his collections in his Burg Stettenfels, the Fuggerschloss Kirchheim and what are now known as the ''Badstuben'' in the [[Fuggerhäuser]] in [[Augsburg]]. His correspondence is also to be found in [[cartulary]]s now in the Fuggerarchiv in [[Dillingen an der Donau]] - precises of these have recently been made available.

'''Imraz Iqbal Ali''' is a [[Fiji]]an businessman, political activist, and former Television  journalist, of [[India]]n descent.  He does not normally use his last name, except for legal purposes. Together with [[Laisa Digitaki]], he is the co-owner of a magazine, ''[[Fiji Living]]'', based in Digitaki's home in the [[Lami, Fiji|Lami]] suburb of [[Vugalei]]. Iqbal also hosted a popular Fiji Diving adventure show during his Television Career.

He contested the [[Nasinu (Indian Communal Constituency, Fiji)|Nasinu]] [[Indians in Fiji|Indian]] [[Communal constituencies|Communal Constituency]] for the [[Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua]] Party (SDL) at the [[Fijian general election, 2006|parliamentary election]] held on 6–13 May 2006.  He polled only 226 votes out of more than 12,000 - some 1.9 percent of the total.

Iqbal strongly condemned the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces]] for the [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|coup d'état]] of 5 December 2006.  An article he published in ''Fiji Living'' resulted in [[Navy]] Commander [[Francis Kean]] summoning him to [[Suva]]'s [[Queen Elizabeth Barracks, Suva|Queen Elizabeth Barracks]] and warning him against speaking out against the Military, according to the [[Fiji Times]] and [[Fiji Village]] (11 December).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fijivillage.com/artman/publish/article_34325.shtml Fijivillage]&lt;/ref&gt;
A studio belonging to Iqbal (Infocus Arts Production House, on Disraeli Road) was destroyed by fire in the early hours of 24 December 2006, [[Fiji Television]] reported.  Some [[Fijian dollar|F$250,000]] of equipment was lost.  Iqbal said that with the [[National Fire Authority (Fiji)|National Fire Authority]] ruling out an electrical fault, he regarded the fire as suspicious.

In the early hours of 25 December, Iqbal was again summoned to the barracks, along with Digitaki, feminist leader [[Virisila Buadromo]], and a number of others.  They were allegedly assaulted by soldiers before being ordered to walk home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?ref=archive&amp;id=54128 FijiTimes]&lt;/ref&gt;
Commodore Bainimarama said the military would resist any attempts to destabilise it or thwart it's cleanup campaign. Speaking on a Fijian radio station talk back show, he named individuals that they were monitoring because they were inciting civil unrest. He warned members of the public and non government activists that included Fiji Women's Rights Movement executive director [[Virisila Buadromo]], Human right activists [[Imrana Jalal|Imarana (Patricia) Jalal]], journalist Imraz Iqbal and businesswoman [[Laisa Digitaki]] to stop saying things that would incite unrest in the country. Mr Bainimarama said these individuals had blamed the military for a fire in Lami the previous week, and he stated it was not the doing of the military. He said that these individuals should shut their mouth or else the military would shut it for them and they should not forget the death that had occurred at the military camp on November 2.

In September 2008 Iqbal again had a brush with the law. This time the Fiji Police force alleged him to be in possession of the missing gun of the 2000 coup. He was arrested and held for 3 days by the Fiji police force and released after numerous raids and searches found no weapons in his possession. His elderly father was also held by the police.

In an interview with [[Fiji Television]] immediately after his release, Iqbal thanked the Fiji Police force for being very professional in their conduct during his arrest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25096">The '''International Electrical Congress''' was a series of international meetings, from 1881 - 1904, in the then new field of [[electrical engineering|applied electricity]]. The first meeting was initiated by the French government, including official national representatives, leading scientists, and others. Subsequent meetings also included official representatives, leading scientists, and others. Primary aims were to develop reliable standards, both in relation to electrical units and electrical apparatus.

==Historical background==
In 1881, both within and across countries, different electrical units were being used. There were at least 12 different units of electromotive force, 10 different units
of electric current and 15 different units of resistance.&lt;ref name=Petley483&gt;{{cite journal |last=Petley, B.W.|first= |date=1994-95 |title=A Brief History of the Electrical Units to 1964 |url=http://stacks.iop.org/0026-1394/31/i=6/a=007 |subscription=yes|journal=Metrologia |volume=31 |page=483 |doi= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other international Congresses were held, and sometimes referred to as International Electrical Congress, Electrical Conference, and similar variations. Secondary sources make different judgments about how to classify the Congresses.  In this article, the Congresses with representatives from national governments are identified as ''International Electrical Congress''. Other Congresses — often addressing the same issues  — are identified here as ''Concurrent Related International Electrical Congresses''. Some of these related conferences were devoted to preparing for an International Electrical Congress.

In 1906 the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title = Overview: Summary |work = IEC History
 |publisher  = International Electrotechnical Commission  |url = http://www.iec.ch/about/history/overview |accessdate = 2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congresses were organised under its auspices were also sometimes referred to as ''International Electrical Congress''. In this article, Congresses organized by the Commission are listed under ''International Electrotechnical Congresses'', while other related Congresses are listed under ''Related International Electrotechnical Conferences''.

: Dealt mainly with magnetic units.&lt;ref name=IEC/&gt; During this Congress, names were proposed for four magnetic-circuit units in the C.G.S. System.  Only two were accepted by vote: the C.G.S. unit for [[magnetic flux]] ( '''{{math|&amp;Phi;}}''') was named ''[[maxwell (unit)|maxwell]]'' and C.G.S. unit of [[magnetising force]] (or [[magnetic field intensity]]) was named ''[[gauss]]'' ('''H''').&lt;ref name=Kennelly33-144/&gt; Some delegates mistakenly believed and reported that the gauss was adopted as the C.G.S. unit of [[flux density]] ('''B''').&lt;ref name=Kennelly33-144/&gt; This mistake has been reproduced in contemporary texts,&lt;ref name=Tunbridge46/&gt; which have cited a mistaken report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Kennelly |first=A.E. |date=5 March 1904 |volume=43|page=468|title=A historical sketch of International Electrical Congresses |url=https://archive.org/stream/electricalworld43newy#page/468/mode/1up |magazine=Electrical World and Engineer  |location= |publisher= |access-date=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is relevant to note that the Congress's official formulation for the gauss was in French, ''{{lang|fr|champ magnetique}},''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author= |title= Congrès International d'électricité|chapter=Rapport de la Commission des Unités|url=https://archive.org/stream/congrsinternati00hospgoog#page/n395/mode/2up|location=Paris |publisher= |date= 1901 |isbn=|language=fr|page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would be translated into English as ''magnetic field'', which has been used to refer both to ('''B''') and ('''H'''), noted in [[Magnetic_field#Definitions,_units,_and_measurement|magnetic field]]. In 1930 the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] decided that the magnetic [[Magnetic field#Definitions.2C units.2C and measurement|field strength]] ('''H''') was  different  from the [[Magnetic field#Definitions.2C units.2C and measurement|magnetic flux density]] ('''B'''), but now assigned the ''gauss'' to refer to magnetic flux density ('''B'''), in contrast to the decision from this Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kennelly |first1=A.E.|date=1933 |title=Conference of the Symbols, Units and Nomenclature (S.

==Concurrent Related International Electrical Congresses==
During the period that the Electrical Congresses were held, other conferences and international Congresses were held, sometimes in preparation to the official Electrical Congresses. These events are listed here.

===1882 in Paris===

''Conférence international pour la détermination des unités électriques'' (International Conference for Determination of Electrical Units)

===1905 in Berlin===
''Internationale Konferenz über Elektrische Masseinheiten'' (International Conference on Electrical Units)

Held 23-25 October at [[Physikalisch-Technischen Reichsanstalt]] at [[Charlottenburg]]. The 1904 Congress recommended holding an international conference to address discrepancies in the electrical units and their interpretation. [[Emil Warburg]], president of the [[Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt]] in Germany, invited representatives from corresponding national laboratories in the United States ([[National Bureau of Standards]]), the United Kingdom ([[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]]), and the official standards commissions in Austria and Belgium to an informal conference on electrical standards and units.&lt;ref name=L244&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Lagerstrom |first=L.R. |date=1992 |title=Constructing uniformity: The standardization of international electromagnetic measures, 1860-1912 |type=doctoral dissertation |chapter= |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |url= |access-date=}}pp. 243-244&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally Mascart (France), Rayleigh (United Kingdom) and [[Henry Smith Carhart |Carhart]] (USA) were invited because of their expertise and influence.&lt;ref name=L244/&gt; Thirteen of the fifteen invited persons participated in the conference, six from the Reichsanstalt, two from the Belgian Commission on Electrical Units, two from the Austrian Commission on Standardization, [[Richard Glazebrook]] from the National Physical Laboratory, Mascart, and Carhart. The non-attendees were [[Samuel Wesley Stratton]], director of the National Bureau of Standard, who sent three papers outlining the positions and proposals of the Bureau, and Rayleigh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Lagerstrom |first=L.R. |date=1992 |title=Constructing uniformity: The standardization of international electromagnetic measures, 1860-1912 |type=doctoral dissertation |chapter= |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |url= |access-date=}}p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; A proceedings was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Verhandlungen der Internationalen konferenz über elektrische masseinheiten abgehalten in der Physikalischtechnischen reichsanstalt zu Charlottenburg vom 23. bis 25. oktober 1905 |date=1906 |author=Internationale Konferenz über Elektrische Masseinheiten |publisher=Reichsdruckerei |url=https://books.google.com?id=TKD2ZwEACAAJ |access-date=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: Concentrated on the redefinition of the ohm, ampere, and volt, as resolved in the 1904 Congress. The aim was to attain true international uniformity in definitions of these concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Lagerstrom |first=L.R. |date=1992 |title=Constructing uniformity: The standardization of international electromagnetic measures, 1860-1912 |type=doctoral dissertation |chapter= |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |url= |access-date=}}p. 351 &lt;/ref&gt; The main question was whether ''ohm'', ''ampere'', and ''volt'' should be independent of each other, or only two should be defined, and which two.&lt;ref name=Tunbridge49&gt;{{cite book | author=Tunbridge, P. | title=Lord Kelvin: His Influence on Electrical Measurements and Units | location=Peter Peregrinus | publisher=London | year=1992 |pages=49-51| isbn=0-86341-237-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bZUK624LZBMC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference concluded that only two electrical units should be taken as fundamental: the [[Ohm#international ohm|international ohm]] and the [[international ampere]].&lt;ref name=Tunbridge49/&gt;  It also adopted the Western Cadmium Cell as the standard cell,&lt;ref name=Tunbridge49/&gt; and added rules about the preparation and use of the mercury tube, whose geometry was specified at the 1893 Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Lagerstrom |first=L.R. |date=1992 |title=Constructing uniformity: The standardization of international electromagnetic measures, 1860-1912 |type=doctoral dissertation |chapter= |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |url= |access-date=}}p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; The conference resolved that another international conference in the course of a year should be held to establish an agreement about the electric standards in use, because different countries had different laws about electrical units.&lt;ref name=Tunbridge49/&gt;

Held 14-19 September, in connection with the L'exposition internationale des applications de l'électricité.&lt;ref name=Turin/&gt; A three-volume proceedings was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= |title= Congrès international des applications de l'électricité Marseille (3 vol.)|url= |publisher=Gauthier-Villars |page= |date=1909 |location=Paris|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Orphan|date=October 2016}}

The '''Logemann Family''' is a Brazilian family of northern German descent. They operate as a family enterprise, and have a full stake in Grupo SLC, a conglomerate of agroindustrial companies, one of them being [[SLC Agrícola]] , an agricultural company and land-holding corporation with properties totalling around {{convert|400000|ha|sqmi}}, which ranks the Logemann Family as the 53rd largest private landowner globally.&lt;ref name=Lovemoney&gt;{{cite web|title=The World's biggest private landowners|url=https://www.lovemoney.com/galleries/70168/revealed-the-worlds-biggest-private-landowners?page=49
|website=lovemoney.com|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family, after selling their [[John Deere]] stake in 1999, heavily invested in cotton, which placed them at the very top of global production. &lt;ref name=IstoéDinheiro&gt;{{cite web|title=Os Novos Reis do Algodão|url=https://www.istoedinheiro.com.br/noticias/negocios/20040406/novos-reis-algodao/17418|website=istoedinheiro.com.br|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All family members live in [[Porto Alegre]], the capital of Brazil's southern-most state [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. According to ''[[Forbes]]'' in 2014, the family shares a 3 billion-dollar empire divided between 19 blood members.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Complete List Of the 150 Richest of Brazil|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andersonantunes/2014/09/18/the-complete-list-with-the-150-richest-people-in-brazil/#28dd34ac7968|website=Forbes.com|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family has kept away from media attention, valuing discretion above all else.

== Business Activities==

The Logemann family began its business activities with Frederico Jorge Logemann, who founded Schneider &amp; Logemann Cia LDTA. This company had a humble shop that repaired and manufactured agricultural tools for the village. Upon  development, the company began producing their own threshers.&lt;ref name="SLC"&gt;{{cite web|title= Historia da SLC|url=http://www.slc.com.br/?page_id=4
|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jorge Antonio Dahne Logemann then took control upon his father's death, and began development of automotive harvesting machines, being the first of the Southern Hemisphere to ever produce one. Mr. Jorge Logemann then founded [[SLC Agrícola]] in 1977 (now the family's main business) and in 1979 he merged SLC with [[John Deere]] for a [[Joint venture]] in Brazil.&lt;ref name="SLC"&gt;{{cite web|title= Historia da SLC|url=http://www.slc.com.br/?page_id=4
|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Mr. Jorge Antonio Logemann passes away, and his two sons Eduardo and Jorge Luis took leadership of the family's businesses. In 1999, Eduardo and Jorge sell SLC &amp; John Deere back to the John Deere group, and exit the business of tool and machine fabrication.&lt;ref name="SLC"&gt;{{cite web|title= Historia da SLC|url=http://www.slc.com.br/?page_id=4
|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the family issues shares of [[SLC Agricola]] in [[B3 (stock exchange)]], which allowed [[SLC Agrícola]] to become one of the 10 most important company of [[Rio Grande do Sul]].&lt;ref name="SLC"&gt;{{cite web|title= Historia da SLC|url=http://www.slc.com.br/?page_id=4
|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the family sold one of their businesses, Ferramentas Gerias, to Grupo OVD for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref name="Amanha"&gt;{{cite web|title= Paranaense OVD anuncia compra da Ferramentas Gerais|url=http://www.amanha.com.br/posts/view/4835|website=amanha.com.br|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable Members==
'''Frederico Jorge Logemann''', German engineer from [[Bremen]], founds in 1927 the village of Belo Horizonte, today's [[Horizontina]]. In 1945 he and his partner Balduíno Schneider found Schneider &amp; Logemann Cia LTDA, focused in the fabrication and maintenance of agricultural tools. Two years after, the company constructed its first thresher. Mr. Logemann passed away in 1947, after which his only son, Jorge Antonio Dahne Logemann, continued his work.&lt;ref name=SLC&gt;{{cite web|title=Grupo SLC|url=http://www.slc.com.br/?page_id=4|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zaira Logemann''', who passed away in 2017, was the oldest member of the family since 1987, belonging to the second generation. She was married to Jorge Antonio Logemann, the member responsible for the creation of SLC and the joint venture with John Deere in 1977. Mrs. Zaira has also been at the forefront of a construction for a new hospital wing in Porto Alegre, which now take on her name. &lt;ref name=Yooying&gt;{{cite web|title=Voluntárias Pela Vida|url=https://www.yooying.com/p/1639147107415163015|website=yooring.com|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eduardo Logemann''', eldest son of Zaira, is the current chairman of the family's companies. He is connected to seven different boards, and served as vice president of [[Federação das Indústrias do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul]].&lt;ref name="Federação das Indústrias do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eduardo Silva Logemann Executive Profile|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=36508873&amp;privcapId=35016821|website=bloomberg.com|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Abrams was born Max Alexander Abramowitz in Edmonton, North London in 1906 to Jewish parents who had emigrated from Lithuania and Latvia to the [[East End of London]] in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford ODNB: Abrams, Mark Alexander|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/54696}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later described his father Abram Abramowitz, a journeyman bootmaker, shopkeeper, and house agent, as a 'philosophical anarchist'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An interview with Mark Abrams (19 September 1984) 1. Family Origins|url=http://surveyresearch.weebly.com/an-interview-with-mark-abrams-audio-files.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Abrams received a scholarship to attend [[The Latymer School]], then read economics at the [[London School of Economics]]. He went on to complete a PhD in early modern English economic history under the supervision of [[R. H. Tawney]] in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Abrams, 'The Gold and Silver Thread Monopolies of James I', unpublished PhD dissertation, London School of Economics, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Between 1931-1933 Abrams was a research fellow at the progressive [[Brookings Institution]] in Washington, DC. In 1933 he joined the research department of the [[London Press Exchange]], one of Britain's leading advertising agencies. Here Abrams began developing his pioneering work in social investigation, market research, and opinion polling by conducting large-scale statistical surveys into consumer behaviour. His national newspaper readership surveys, which included over 20,000 participants between 1934-38, were landmarks in survey research and were credited with establishing the widespread use of the [[NRS social grade|ABC1 system]] of social classification in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Dawn Mitchell, 'Research for the Truth: Mark Abrams (1906-1994), ''Guardian'', 27 September 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Abrams's contacts with other social scientists working abroad during this period led to his work retrieving refugees from [[Nazi]] Europe (in 1939 helping [[Sigmund Freud]] make his final move to England).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford ODNB: Abrams, Mark Alexander|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/54696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War Two]] Abrams was employed first in the [[BBC]] Overseas Research Department, then at the Psychological Warfare Board, where he carried out government surveys into working-class diets under rationing and the impact of bombing on civilian morale, and also commissioned covert psychological analysis into the mind of [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inside Hitler's Mind, University of Cambridge Research (4 May 2012).|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/inside-hitlers-mind}}&lt;/ref&gt; His studies of food consumption during the war contributed to the establishment of the National Food Survey in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Data Service: National Food Survey 1940-2000|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/54696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abrams returned to the London Press Exchange in 1946 to direct its research department as an independent subsidiary consultancy, Research Services Ltd. By the early 1960s the company employed over ninety members of staff and produced surveys for 300 clients a year, including academic as well as commercial, political, and public sector organisations.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Schwarzkopf, 'The Statisticalization of the Consumer in British Market Research, c. 1920-1960: Profiling a Good Society', in Glen O'Hara and Tom Crook (eds.), ''Statistics and the Public Sphere: Numbers and the People in Modern Britain'' (London: Routledge, 2012), pp. 144-62.&lt;/ref&gt; Research Services Ltd. was commissioned to undertake social surveys prior to the building of [[Peterlee]] new town and the establishment of [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Black, 'The Impression of Affluence: Political Culture in the 1950s and 1960s', in Lawrence Black and Hugh Pemberton (eds.) ''An Affluent Society? Britain's Post-War 'Golden Age' Revisited'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2004), p. 99; Mark Clapson, 'The Rise and Fall of Monica Felton, British Town Planner and Peace Activist, 1930s to 1950s', ''Planning Perspectives'', 30:2 (2015): 216.&lt;/ref&gt; Abrams, along with contemporary pollsters such as [[Henry William Durant|Henry Durant]] of the [[British Institute of Public Opinion]], gained a reputation as an expert authority on market research and mass communication techniques in Britain, and published widely in academic journals as well as newspapers and the popular press.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Moran, 'Mass Observation, Market Research, and the Birth of the Focus Group 1937-1997', ''Journal of British Studies'' 47:4 (2008): 827-51.&lt;/ref&gt; Two of his most influential market research reports coined the phrase 'teenage consumer'&lt;ref&gt;Mark Abrams, ''The Teenage Consumer'' (London: London Press Exchange, 1959) and Mark Abrams, ''Teenage Consumer Spending in 1959'' (London: London Press Exchange, 1961).&lt;/ref&gt;, drawing attention to the new significance of a rapidly expanding youth market for products and advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Nixon, 'Understanding Ordinary Women: Advertising, Consumer Research and Mass Consumption in Britain, 1948-67', ''Journal of Cultural Economy'', 2:3 (2009): fn. 14, p. 320; [[David Kynaston]], ''Modernity Britain, 1957-62'' (London: Bloomsbury, 2013), p. 341. cf. David Fowler, ''The First Teenagers: The Lifestyle of Young Wage-Earners in Interwar Britain'' (Oxford: Routledge, 1995) pp. 93-94&lt;/ref&gt; Abrams was one of the founding members of the [[Market Research Society]] and an advisor of the [[Which?|Consumers' Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Market Research Society: History|url=https://www.mrs.org.uk/mrs/history}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research Services Ltd. (later known as RSL) was one of the founder companies of [[Ipsos MORI]].

From the mid-1950s Abrams became closely connected with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and carried out many of their private opinion polls, first with the modernisers in the party aligned with [[Hugh Gaitskell]] and then [[Harold Wilson]], for whom he worked on the development of Labour's publicity campaign for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;Dominic Wring, ''The Politics of Marketing the Labour Party'' (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2005), pp. 67-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abrams left his chairmanship of Research Services Limited in 1970 to become Director of the Survey Research Unit at the [[Economic and Social Research Council|Social Science Research Council]], under [[Michael Young, Baron Young of Dartington|Michael Young]]. Between 1971 and 1975 he worked on the 'Quality of Life in Britain' surveys, which included the innovative use of 'subjective social indicators' to track perceptions of social change.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Anthony, 'Governing for Happiness: Mark Abrams, Subjective Social Indicators and the Post-war Explosion of 'Middle-Opinion', in Don Leggett and Charlotte Sleigh (eds.), ''Scientific Governance in Britain, 1914-79'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2016), pp. 274-94.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1976-1985, Abrams was Research Director at the Age Concern Institute of Gerontology, King's College London, where he undertook studies of living standards among people aged 65 and over. He was also Vice-President of the [[Policy Studies Institute]] between 1978-1994.

{{Nihongo|'''Masao Horiba'''|堀場 雅夫|Horiba Masao| December 1, 1924 – July 14, 2015}} was a Japanese businessman. In 1945, he founded Horiba Radio Laboratory, now [[Horiba|Horiba Ltd.]], a manufacturer of advanced analytical and measurement technology. Masao Horiba received several awards from the Japanese government including a national [[Medals of Honor (Japan)|Blue Ribbon Medal]], and was the first non-American to receive the [[Pittcon Heritage Award]].&lt;ref name=Magazine /&gt;

== Early  life and education ==
Masao Horiba was born on December 1, 1924,&lt;ref name=OralHistory /&gt; in [[Shimogyō-ku, Kyoto]], Japan. He was the second son of Shinkichi Horiba, a chemistry professor at Kyoto Imperial University, and his wife Mikiko.&lt;ref name=Kwansei&gt;{{cite web|title=Masao Horiba|url=http://www.kwansei-ac.jp/iba/entre/en/library/vol8.html|publisher=Center for Research in Business, Kwansei Gakuin University|accessdate=March 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a child, Horiba suffered from juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;ref name=OralHistory&gt;{{cite web|author=Center for Oral History| title= Masao Horiba |url=https://oh.sciencehistory.org/oral-histories/horiba-masao|website= [[Science History Institute]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="transcript"&gt;{{cite book|first=David C. |last=Brock |title=Masao Horiba, Transcript of Interviews Conducted by David C. Brock at HORIBA, Ltd. Kyoto, Japan on 19 and 20 November 2004  |date=20 November 2004 |url=https://oh.sciencehistory.org/sites/default/files/horiba_m_0305_suppl.pdf|place=Philadelphia, PA|publisher=[[Science History Institute|Chemical Heritage Foundation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He attended Kyoto Teachers' School's Elementary School and Konan Junior High and Senior High Schools in [[Kobe]], Japan.&lt;ref name=Kwansei /&gt;

Originally interested in mathematics and astronomy, Horiba was introduced to nuclear physics by one of his high school teachers&lt;ref name=Speech2011 /&gt; at the Konan Boys' High School.&lt;ref name=OralHistory /&gt; He received a  B.S. in physics,&lt;ref name=OralHistory /&gt; and hoped to study nuclear physics with [[Bunsaku Arakatsu]] at [[Kyoto University]]. However, further study in nuclear physics was not possible in post-war Japan. The American authorities had banned such study, and instruments and testing devices had been removed or destroyed.&lt;ref name=Kwansei /&gt;&lt;ref name=Speech2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horiba|first=Masao|title=Speech In Honouring the Masao Horiba Award Winners|journal=Readout (English edition)|publisher=Horiba Technical Reports|date=February 2011|issue=14|url=http://www.horiba.com/uploads/media/R14E_03_01.pdf|accessdate=March 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Establishing a company ==
Horiba, who was in his second year at Kyoto University, left the university in 1945 to start his own business, Horiba Radio Laboratory (HRL). In addition to producing electronic parts and repairing electronic instruments, they reconditioned batteries.&lt;ref name=Magazine /&gt; The power distribution system after the war was unreliable, so there was a strong demand for storage batteries for electric lights that could be used in the case of blackouts. Horiba acquired discarded storage batteries and selenium rectifiers which the company Nihon Denchi had produced for wartime use.&lt;ref name=Speech2011/&gt; Sales of Horiba's reconditioned "Teidento" batteries were a profitable source of income for the Horiba company.&lt;ref name=Magazine /&gt;

One of the instruments that Horiba produced and repaired was an electric-pulse oscillator, used in brain surgery. When an oscillator stopped working in the middle of an operation, Masao Horiba was called upon to make emergency repairs. He got the instrument working so the surgeons could finish the operation, and then took the instrument home to examine it in more detail.  Examination of the components showed that an [[electrolytic capacitor]] had failed. When it proved difficult to buy low-cost reliable replacements, Horiba started producing electrolytic capacitors. By integrating [[quality control]] into the production process, he was able to produce high-quality products. He partnered with an investor but their plans to build a capacitor plant fell through when the Korean war caused Japanese metal prices to rise.&lt;ref name=Magazine /&gt;

One of the instruments needed for the capacitor manufacturing processes was the [[pH meter]]. Imported pH meters tended to be unreliable, possibly because of Japan's hot and humid climate.&lt;ref name=OralHistory /&gt; They were also expensive.  Rather than buy imported pH meters, Horiba had built his own pH meters for capacitor testing.&lt;ref name=Magazine /&gt; He saw a potential market for reliable, low-cost pH meters in Japan's food and chemical industries, and partnered with Kitahama Works, a major scientific instruments company, to sell them. The pH meters were sold to [[fertilizer]] plants throughout Japan to monitor pH levels in the production of [[ammonium sulfate]] fertilizer for use in [[rice]] production.&lt;ref name=Speech2011 /&gt; In 1953, "Horiba Radio Laboratory" was renamed "Horiba Ltd."&lt;ref name=Magazine /&gt;

==Technology development==

Masao Horiba continued to look for new opportunities for his company. After investigating [[gas chromatography]], Horiba decided instead to develop instruments for [[Infrared spectroscopy|infrared analysis]]. The Horiba company already had some experience in creating [[Boule (crystal)|synthetic single crystals]] for use in infrared instruments. With support from the Japanese [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]], the first Horiba IR infrared-based gas analyzer was sold in 1958, followed by a model for industrial use in 1962.&lt;ref name=Magazine /&gt;

Masao Horiba visited the United States in 1958 as part of a study tour for delegates approved by the Japan Productivity Center. He was particularly interested in seeing the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|National Bureau of Standards]].&lt;ref name=Speech2011 /&gt; During this trip, he also met representatives of [[Hitachi|Hitachi, Ltd.]], beginning a relationship with the Hitachi company.&lt;ref name=Kwansei /&gt;&lt;ref name=OralHistory /&gt;

The next major product developed at the Horiba company resulted from the work of Masahiro Oura, a young researcher who saw the potential for an [[Motor vehicle emissions|auto-emissions]] measurement instrument. Masao Horiba supported the project once he learned that Oura had orders from several major automobile manufacturers. The company's MEXA-1 air emissions analyzer, which came out in 1964, was the first in a series of analysis devices of increasing sensitivity. The MEXA-1 became important for the company's international expansion. In 1970, Horiba partnered with (and later acquired) Olson Laboratories, expanding into Europe and the UK.&lt;ref name=Magazine /&gt; In 1975, a MEXA analyzer was sold to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA). The Horiba model MEXA-200 infrared CO analyzer was adopted by the EPA for the regulation auto emissions.&lt;ref name=MexaVideo&gt;{{cite web|title=Horiba Mexa-200|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/horiba-mexa-200-co-analyzer|publisher=Science History Institute|accessdate=26 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MEXA systems were bought by [[Mercedes-Benz]] in Germany, and [[Renault]] in France.&lt;ref name=Magazine /&gt;

==Writing and lecturing==
In 1978, at the age of 53, Horiba became chairman of the company, passing the role of president to Masahiro Oura. In 1992, Oura was succeeded by [[Atsushi Horiba]], Horiba's son.&lt;ref name=Magazine /&gt;

Horiba actively promoted [[venture capital]] investment, particularly in the Kyoto area, as an adviser to the Advanced Software Technology and Mechatronics Research Institute of Kyoto (ASTEM), one of the largest start-up incubator organizations in Japan. He was a representative of the Japan Association of New Business Incubation Organization (JANBO) which was established in 1999 as a nationwide network for the support of new businesses in Japan. He served as the chairman of the Innovation Initiative Network Japan (Innovation-Net)  established in 2009 to revitalize regional economies by promoting collaboration between industries and universities.&lt;ref name=Innovation-Net&gt;{{cite web|title=Winner of the METI Minister’s Award under the Third Commendation Program for Supporting Regional Industries (Innovation-Net Award 2014)|url=http://www.meti.go.jp/english/press/2014/0314_02.html|publisher=Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry|accessdate=March 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Masao Horiba was also a founder and past president of the Association of Asian Business Incubation (AABI) which encourages support of  initiatives throughout Asia, not just in Japan.&lt;ref name=Magazine /&gt;

Horiba wrote and lectured on [[business]] and [[management]]. He published several books, including ''Keiei Kokoroe-cho'' (''The Management Handbook'') and ''Iyanara Yamero'' (''Joy and Fun'').&lt;ref name=Magazine /&gt; Horiba promoted the corporate philosophy of ''Omoshiro Okashiku'' or ''Live Merrily and Cheerfully''.&lt;ref name=Kwansei /&gt; He advocated that work should be meaningful and fulfilling, and that employees should be encouraged to be creative, take risks, and question accepted practices. Employers are encouraged to "let the nail stand out", a significant departure from the Japanese [[adage]] that "The nail that stands out gets beaten down."&lt;ref name=Magazine&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ulrych|first=Richard|title=A Japanese instrument pioneer|journal=Chemical Heritage Magazine|year=2004 |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=12–13, 35–37 |accessdate=March 21, 2014|url=http://pdc-connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/12722282/japanese-instrument-pioneer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The Masao Horiba Awards were established through the Horiba company to recognize young scientists in analytical science, outside the group companies, "who are devoting themselves to research and development of innovative technology in analysis and measurement."&lt;ref name=MasaoAwards&gt;{{cite web|title=Masao Horiba Awards|url=http://www.horiba.com/about-horiba/technical-expertise/masao-horiba-awards/|publisher=Horiba|accessdate=March 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Horiba received the [[Medals of Honor (Japan)|Blue Ribbon Medal of Honor]] from the Government of Japan, awarded to individuals who have made significant achievements in public service or public welfare.

In recognition of his entrepreneurship and contributions to scientific instrumentation and to society, Masao Horiba was awarded the [[Pittcon Heritage Award]] in 2006, at the [[Pittsburgh Conference on Analytical Chemistry and Applied Spectroscopy]] and the [[Chemical Heritage Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Pittcon"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pittcon Heritage Award|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/pittcon-heritage-award|website=[[Science History Institute]]|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award is given to those "whose entrepreneurial careers shaped the instrumentation community, inspired achievement, promoted public understanding of the modern instrumentation sciences, and highlighted the role of analytical chemistry in world economies." &lt;ref name=LCGC&gt;{{cite news|last=Patel-Predd|first=Prachi|title=Masao Horiba gets Pittcon Heritage Award|url=http://www.chromatographyonline.com/lcgc/Misc/Masao-Horiba-gets-Pittcon-Heritage-Award/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/312157|accessdate=March 21, 2014|newspaper=LC GC Chromatography Online|date=March 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Masao Horiba is the first non-American to receive the Pittcon Award.&lt;ref name=NonAmerican&gt;{{cite news|title=The First Non-American to Receive the Prize and Be Inducted into the Hall of Fame HORIBA's Founder, Masao Horiba Receives Analytical Chemistry Prize|url=http://www.horiba.com/us/en/corporate-news/news/article/the-first-non-american-to-receive-the-prize-and-be-inducted-into-the-hall-of-fame-horibas-founder-masao-horiba-receives-analytical-chemistry-prize-4593/|accessdate=March 22, 2014|newspaper=Horiba Ltd.|date=March 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gustavo Herrero, executive director of the [[Harvard Business School]] Latin American Research Center, told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that local politics were to blame for the imprisonment of Campiani and his private equity partners, stating they were “ideal scapegoats.” A ''Mercero Press'' report covering the Pluna imprisonment stated that there was a “political” side to Leadgate.  According to this article, when Pluna Leadgate was launched in 2007, Agriculture Minister and future president [[José Mujica]] allegedly said: “I don’t like the looks of these cocky Argentines from Buenos Aires.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.mercopress.com/2013/12/21/uruguay-economy-minister-resigns-over-scandal-involving-flag-air-carrier-pluna |title=Uruguay Economy Minister Resigns Over Scandal Involving Flag Air Carrier PLUNA |publisher=''Merco Press'' |date=December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, the [[Supreme Court of Uruguay]] took up Campiani's appeal for release from jail. He was released on May 22, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/campiani-libre-abrio-polemica-sistema.html&lt;/ref&gt;  No formal charges have been filed against Camipani, as of May 2016.

The '''National Day of Mourning''', or '''Workers’ Mourning Day''' is observed in [[Canada]] on 28 April. It commemorates workers who have been killed, injured or suffered illness due to workplace related hazards and occupational exposures.

Workers' Memorial Day was started when two labour activists, Colin Lambert and Dr. Ray Sentes, were driving in early April 1983 to a union meeting, and were stopped by a funeral procession for a firefighter that had been killed in the line of duty&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=BC Labour Heritage Centre|title=Day of Mourning The Untold Story (2017)|date=2017-04-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP0JvrXjmgo&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They worried that other workers who died because of work did not receive similar honours, and recalled how members of the United Steelworkers in Elliott Lake held each year a "Workers' Remembrance Day" for uranium miners who had succumbed to exposures. Lambert and Sentes sought endorsements from union officials for the idea to hold a national day of mourning, and the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) passed a resolution to that effect at its annual convention in 1983, and the Canadian Labour Congress followed suit at its annual convention the following year. The AFL-CIO declared a day of mourning in 1989 and a "workers' Memorial Day" is observed in over 100 countries.

In December 1990, this day became a national observance in Canada with the passing of the Workers Mourning Day Act, so that on April 28, 1991, it was officially the National Day of Mourning for persons killed or injured in the workplace; making April 28, an official Workers’ Mourning Day.&lt;ref name="Manchester"&gt;[[Greater Manchester Hazards Centre]] Fact Sheet 28 April 2006 (GMHC is part of the [[Hazards Campaign]] recognised and affiliated to the UK [[Trades Union Congress]]) Author Hilda Palmer, (no ISBN); available at {{cite web |url=http://www.gmhazards.org.uk/WMDLft06.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518055811/http://www.gmhazards.org.uk/WMDLft06.pdf |archivedate=2006-05-18 |df= }} Also '''Safety Express' March/ April 2006 Page 5'' 'April 28th is...Workers' Memorial Day' (no ISBN); published by The [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents]] ([[ROSPA]]) UK [[registered charity]] No. 207823&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ohs"&gt;TUC Certificate in Occupational Health &amp; Safety course notes 2004/5 Section C page 69 (no ISBN); more info available at {{cite web |url=http://www.tuc.org.uk/h_and_s/index.cfm?mins=293 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217003146/http://www.tuc.org.uk/h_and_s/index.cfm?mins=293 |archivedate=2010-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Injuries and deaths in the workplace continue to be a matter of important concern across Canada. Many Canadians members work hard each day in an effort to minimize accidents and incidents.  Risk is an inherent element of many jobs, and this is why safety should be one of the core values in any workplace. Since its inception, the observance has spread to over 80 countries around the world, but is known is most other countries as the [[Workers' Memorial Day]]. The date 28 April was picked because on that day in 1914, the [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/workers-compensation/ Workers Compensation Act] received its third reading. In 2001 the [[International Labour Organization]] first observed World Day for Safety and Health at Work on this day.  Commemorating those who have been hurt or killed in the workplace shows respect for the fallen, while serving as a reminder of the importance of occupational health and safety.

The Canadian flag is flown at half-mast from sunrise to sunset on all federal government buildings, including on Parliament Hill. Workers and employees observe this day in various ways including lighting candles, donning ribbons and black armbands, and observing a moment of silence at 1100 hrs. The purpose of Day of Mourning is twofold- to remember and honour those lives lost or injured and to renew the commitment to improving health and safety in the workplace - to prevent further deaths, injuries and diseases from work.

==Young Workers==
Young workers aged from 15-24 are more likely than any other group to be injured on the job, in fact 1/3 of all injuries occur in this age group, and males are twice as likely to be injured as female workers.&lt;ref name="YoungStats"&gt;[[WorkSafeBC]] Young Workers Rights and Facts, http://www.labourheritagecentre.ca/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/6-FactSheet-Bugged-Revision-3-.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The highest rate of injury happens in construction and hospitality industries. These rates have led to specific laws in many provinces that provide for additional and special training for young and new workers.&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;[[WorkSafeBC]] Young Workers Resource and Fact Page, http://www2.worksafebc.com/Topics/YoungWorker/Home.asp.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these statistics, there has been renewed push to use this holiday to educate young workers of their rights in schools.&lt;ref name="Schools"&gt;Day of Mourning, BC Schools Project, http://www.labourheritagecentre.ca/domschoolsproject/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oscar Hammerstein I''' (8 May 1846{{spaced ndash}}1 August 1919) was a German-born businessman, [[theater]] [[impresario]], and composer in [[New York City]].  His passion for [[opera]] led him to open several opera houses, and he rekindled opera's popularity in America.  He was the grandfather of American lyricist [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] and the father of theater manager [[Willie Hammerstein|William Hammerstein]] and American producer [[Arthur Hammerstein]].

==Early life==
Oscar Hammerstein I was born in [[Szczecin|Stettin]] (capital of the [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|province of Pomerania]]), [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (now Szczecin, [[Poland]]), to [[German (language)|German]] [[Jew]]ish parents Abraham and Berthe Hammerstein.  He took up the [[flute]], [[piano]], and [[violin]] at an early age.  His mother died when he was fifteen years old.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}  During his youth, Hammerstein's father wanted him to continue with his education, and to specialize in subjects such as [[algebra]], but Hammerstein wanted to pursue music.  After Oscar went skating in a park one day, his father found out and whipped him as punishment; this would spur Hammerstein to run away to [[North America]].  After selling his violin, Hammerstein ran away to [[Liverpool]],&lt;ref&gt;"Oscar Hammerstein."  Jewish Virtual Library.  The American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise, 2012.  Web.  4 Mar 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and from there, took a three-month journey to the United States arriving in New York City in 1864.

==Cigar manufacturer==
Hammerstein made ends meet initially by working at a [[cigar]] factory on [[Pearl Street (Manhattan)|Pearl Street]].  He worked his way up to become a cigar maker himself, and also founded the ''U.S Tobacco Journal.''  Hammerstein would eventually become the owner of at least 80 patents, with most of them being related to the machines he made for the cigar-making process.  Hammerstein's most well-known contribution to the cigar-making process is adding an air-suctioning component to the traditional cigar-making machines, and the component would hold down the [[tobacco]] leaves firmly so that they could be cut more cleanly.&lt;ref&gt;"Grand Opera Built on Smoke." New York Times (1857-1922): SM5. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851-2008). Nov 18 1906. Web. 5 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial machine only sold for $6,000, but later reinventions would boost his machine's worth to around $200,000.  Another invention that Hammerstein created was a more efficient [[plumbing]] system for his sink when it had leaked one night.

He also moonlighted as a theater manager in the downtown German theaters.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

He became wealthy industrializing cigar manufacturing, and his tobacco fortune provided the money he used to pursue his theater interests.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Producer and impresario==
Hammerstein built his first theater, the [[Harlem Opera House]], on [[125th Street (Manhattan)|125th Street]] in 1889, along with 50 housing developments. His second theater, the Columbus Theatre, was built in 1890 on the same street, featuring light theatrical productions.

His third theater was the first Manhattan Opera House, built in 1893 on 34th Street.  This failed as an opera house and was used, in partnership with [[Koster and Bial's Music Hall|Koster and Bial]], to present [[variety show]]s. Hammerstein was displeased with the partnership to the point that it fell into bitterness: "When I get through with you, everybody will forget there ever was a Koster and Bial.  I will build a house the likes of which has never been seen in the whole world.".&lt;ref&gt;"Grand Opera Built on Smoke." ''The New York Times'' (1857-1922): SM5. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: ''The New York Times'' (1851-2008). Nov 18 1906. Web. 5 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895 he opened a fourth venue, the [[Olympia Theatre (New York)|Olympia Theatre]], on [[Longacre Square]], where he presented a [[comic opera]] that he wrote himself, ''[[Santa Maria (operetta)|Santa Maria]]'' (1896).  While it was positively received by ''[[The New York Times]]'', Hammerstein's personal experience was less than peaceful, with the production being plagued by monetary issues with the cast and stage set.  In the end, Hammerstein had profited only one-tenth of the costs that were put into the ''Santa Maria'' production.&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Vincent. Oscar Hammerstein I. The Life and Exploits of an Impresario. (1956). Jewish Social Studies, 18, 310&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine years later, Longacre Square was renamed [[Times Square]], and the area had become, through his efforts, a thriving theater district.

Hammerstein built three more theaters there, the [[Victoria Theater (Hammerstein's)|Victoria Theatre]] (1899), which turned to [[vaudeville]] presentation in 1904 and was managed by his son, [[Willie Hammerstein]] before closing in 1915; the [[New Victory Theater|Theatre Republic]] was built in 1900 and leased to eccentric producer [[David Belasco]], in 1901, and the [[Wallack's Theatre|Lew Fields Theatre]] for [[Lew Fields]] (half of the Vaudeville team Weber and Fields, and the father of lyricist [[Dorothy Fields]]), in 1904.  He wrote a [[Musical theater|musical]] called ''Punch, Judy &amp; Co.''  in 1903.  Hammerstein also opened Hammerstein's [[Paradise Roof Garden]] above the Victoria and Republic theatres.

==Opera and later years==
[[Image:Oscar Hammerstein I and Cleofonte Campanini.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Oscar Hammerstein I (left) with conductor [[Cleofonte Campanini]] in New York, 1908.]]

In 1906, Hammerstein, dissatisfied with the [[Metropolitan Opera]]'s productions, opened an eighth theater, his second [[Manhattan Center|Manhattan Opera House]], to directly (and successfully) compete with it. He also opened the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Philadelphia)|Philadelphia Opera House]] in 1908, which, however, he sold early in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;"Philadelphia Opera House" at the ''[[New International Encyclopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

He produced contemporary operas and presented the American premieres of ''[[Louise (opera)|Louise]]'', ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelleas et Melisande]]'', ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'', ''[[Le Jongleur de Notre-Dame]]'', ''[[Thaïs (opera)|Thaïs]]'', and ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'', as well as the American debuts of [[Mary Garden]] and [[Luisa Tetrazzini]]. Since the star soprano [[Nellie Melba]] was disenchanted with the Metropolitan, she deserted it for Hammerstein's company, rescuing it financially with a successful season.  He also produced the successful [[Victor Herbert]] [[operetta]] ''[[Naughty Marietta (operetta)|Naughty Marietta]]'' in 1910.

Hammerstein became famous during his opera years for putting noticeably large budgets out for his productions, ''Santa Maria'' being one example.  More often than not, he would fall into financial trouble within a short period of time.  ''The New York Times'' conducted an interview with Hammerstein, and when the interviewer asked him about his financial habits, Hammerstein responded:

:Financially, I never undertake anything without plenty of ammunition.  I am never afraid of being ambushed in this account.  I decided that my preliminary contracts should be drawn up provisionally upon my success in securing the great stars.  I always contemplated an honorable retreat.&lt;ref&gt;"Hammerstein Tells how to Start an Opera Company." New York Times (1857-1922): X5. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851-2008). May 06 1906. Web. 6 Mar. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, Hammerstein's high-quality productions were ultimately too expensive to sustain, and by his fourth opera season, he was going bankrupt. The costs at the Metropolitan, too, were skyrocketing, as the Metropolitan spent more and more in order to effectively compete. Hammerstein's son [[Arthur Hammerstein|Arthur]] negotiated a payment of $1.2&amp;nbsp;million from the Metropolitan in exchange for an agreement not to produce grand opera in the United States for 10 years.

With this money, Hammerstein built his tenth theater, the [[London Opera House]], in London, where he again entered competition with an established opera house, [[Covent Garden]]'s [[Royal Opera House]]. He had run through his money in two years and thereupon returned to America.  During a trip to [[Paris]], a special cable was sent to him out of curiosity asking whether he wanted to quit opera in New York, given that during his 1909-1910 opera seasons in New York and Philadelphia, Hammerstein had failed in successfully maintaining audiences in his two venues in each city.  He simply responded by saying, "[Opera in New York is] what I'm here for.  I can't say anymore." &lt;ref&gt;"Before Hammerstein Heard." ''The New York Times'' (1857-1922): 2. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851-2008). Apr 28 1910. Web. 5 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

With money obtained selling the sole booking rights to the Victoria Theatre, he built his eleventh and final theatre, the ''Lexington Opera House.''  Unable to present opera there, he opened it as a movie theatre, selling it shortly thereafter.  On April 28, 1910, Hammerstein officially ended producing opera, opting to solely focus on dramatic productions.  All of his contracts and buildings of operation were turned over to the Metropolitan Opera Company.&lt;ref&gt;"Quits Opera for Good", ''The New York Times'' (1857-1922): 9. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851-2008). Apr 29 1910. Web. 5 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hammerstein's first wife was Rosa (Rose) Blau.  After Rosa died, he married Melvina Jacobi.  The marriage took place on December 7, 1879 in [[Montgomery, Alabama]].  Melvina's parents, Henrietta and Simon Jacobi, were Jews from Bavaria (Ingerheim) who settled in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] and, later, Montgomery, Alabama.  Melvina and Oscar had two daughters - Rose and Estella ([[Stella Hammerstein|Stella]]).

==Legal problems==
[[File:Stella Hammerstein 001.jpg|thumb|90px|Stella Hammerstein]]
Late in his career, Hammerstein experienced numerous legal troubles, most of them in regards to his opera houses.  He went through many of them with an air of pride.{{clarify|date=July 2012}}

One of his more infamous accusations was from a Frances Lee, an opera singer, who accused him of preventing her from singing in the Manhattan Opera House after one performance.  Hammerstein was found not guilty and settled his possible payment for up to $35.&lt;ref&gt;"Did i Write? Sure, Says Hammerstein." New York Times (1857-1922): 11. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851-2008). Nov 22 1908. Web. 5 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hammerstein had given his two daughters, Stella and Rose Hammerstein, $200 a week for financial support after the death of his first wife.  The payments were given to them by the [[Equitable Trust Company]] securely in exchange for stock shares in Hammerstein's Victoria Theatre.  In 1912, Hammerstein requested his stocks back from the company and chose to no longer pay for his daughters.  Stella and Rose sought to fight against their father, who believed that they could support themselves on their own.  Infamously, he compared paying his daughters to "the eccentricities and actions of the late lamented [[King Lear]]."&lt;ref&gt;"Hammerstein Wont Support Daughters." New York Times (1857-1922): 1. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851-2008). Oct 09 1912. Web. 5 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Hammerstein contracted [[kidney]] problems and [[paralysis]], eventually permanently falling into a [[coma]]. He died in 1919 in [[Lenox Hill Hospital]] at [[Park Avenue]] and 77th Street in Manhattan. His contractual ban on presenting opera was due to expire in 1920; at his death he was busy planning his return to the opera stage.

The Manhattan Opera House was bid for $145,000 by Hammerstein's two daughters.  They would also sue Hammerstein's third wife, Emma Swift Hammerstein, over money and ownership of the building.  Emma Hammerstein would go to court claiming ownership through Hammerstein Opera Company stock, but the stocks were found to be null and void by the judge.&lt;ref&gt;"Manhattan Opera House is Auctioned." New York Times (1857-1922): 27. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851-2008). Jun 23 1921. Web. 5 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manhattan Opera House on 34th Street in New York City was renamed the "[[Hammerstein Ballroom]]" at the [[Manhattan Center|Manhattan Center Studios]] in his honor.

'''''Patterns''''' is a 1956 American [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Fielder Cook]] and starring [[Van Heflin]], [[Everett Sloane]], and [[Ed Begley]]. The screenplay by [[Rod Serling]] was an adaptation of his teleplay ''[[Patterns (Kraft Television Theatre)|Patterns]]'' originally telecast January 12, 1955 on the ''[[Kraft Television Theatre]]'', which starred Sloane, Begley and [[Richard Kiley]].&lt;ref name="AFI"/&gt;

==Plot==
Most of the scenes are set in the corporate boardroom and surrounding offices of Ramsey &amp; Co., a Manhattan industrial empire headed by the ruthless Walter Ramsey. He brings youthful industrial engineer Fred Staples, whose performance at a company Ramsey has recently acquired has impressed him, to do a top executive job at the head office. Ramsey is grooming Staples to replace the aging Bill Briggs as the second in command at the company.

Briggs has been with the firm for decades, having worked for and admired the company's founder, Ramsey's father. His concern for the employees clashes repeatedly with Ramsey's ruthless methods. Ramsey will not fire Briggs outright but does everything in his power to sabotage and humiliate his subordinate into resigning. The old man stubbornly refuses to give in. Staples has mixed feelings about the messy situation, his ambition conflicting with his sympathy for Briggs.

The stress gets to Briggs, who collapses after a confrontation with Ramsey and later dies. This causes a heated showdown between Ramsey and Staples, in which Staples announces he is quitting and Ramsey says that only high performers have any right to leading posts. In the end, Ramsey persuades him to stay, telling him that he is the only one who can function at Briggs's level and that he would not be able to reach his full potential anywhere else. Staples accepts a promotion with double his salary and stock options but warns Ramsey that he will actively work to replace him in the company.  Staples also tells Ramsey of Briggs' "one pitiful little dream" of someday walking in and breaking Ramsey's jaw.  He now reserves that dream for himself.  Ramsey says he'll have it written into the contract agreement and will attach a special rider giving him the same privilege.  Ramsey notes that Briggs' son will be "taken care of" and Staples asks if that will let him sleep better tonight.  Ramsey smiles and says, "It begins."

==From play to film==
Apart from establishing shots on New York City streets, the film's screenplay makes a couple of major changes from the teleplay - after the death of Andy Sloane, Fred Staples is shown at a bar, where his wife comes to pick him up and take him home, insisting he is in no condition to drive. Staples is more insistent in the film than in the play that he and his wife leave town, even telling her to pack. The final confrontation between Staples and Ramsey takes place the next day, not immediately afterwards. For the film, Andy Sloane's name was altered to "Bill Briggs." Also, Ramsey and Company is depicted as a huge corporate machine, with expansive quarters downtown. And the company does things "in a big way." In the teleplay, Staples tells Ramsey he and his wife have "found a house", but the film version has Staples moving into a big home more or less provided by the company, and stocked with "all the essentials" including beer in the ice box and food in the freezer.

While Sloane and Begley reprised their roles, Heflin replaced Kiley in the role of up-and-coming executive Fred Staples, though at 46, he was arguably a little too old to play a junior executive. But Serling also changed Staples's character. Instead of a junior-level manager of a small factory that had done some sub-contracting work for Ramsey, he was now shown as the manager of a presumably much larger facility taken over by Ramsey and Company, and whose performance there in keeping the factory afloat during that period impressed Ramsey enough to hire Staples direct. In the teleplay, the other execs talk of having expected a much older man. That was also omitted from the film version.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Film critic Dennis Schwartz highly praised the film and also discussed the background of the production in his review, "''Patterns'' is based on the teleplay of Rod Serling which was aired live on TV in January of 1955 on Kraft Television Theater, and was so-well received that it was repeated four weeks later. That was something not done during that period. This brilliant script by the creator of the ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'', Rod Serling, is considered by many as the finest piece of writing he has ever done and brought him instant acclaim. It is ably directed by Fielder Cook ... The ensemble cast is superb, with special kudos to Van Heflin, Ed Begley, Beatrice Straight and Everett Sloane. This is Van Heflin's finest role since ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' (1953)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepages.sover.net/~ozus/patterns.htm Schwartz, Dennis]. ''Ozus' World Movie Reviews'', film review, September 27, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the April 27, 2008 edition of ''TV Week'', the television critic [[Tom Shales]] compared the movie unfavorably to the live TV production:
:Some people thought live TV was the beginning of a truly new storytelling medium—one uniquely suited to intimate, unadorned, psychological dramas—but it turned out to be a beginning with a tiny middle and a rushed end... ''Patterns'' was so well-received that Kraft mounted a live repeat of the show a month later, and the intimate TV show was turned into a less intimate (and somehow less satisfying) movie in 1956. Except for the use of terms like “mimeographed” and “teletype,” little about the drama seems dated, unless one is of the opinion that corporate politics and boardroom bloodletting no longer exist... With minimally judicious scene-setting (shots of clocks, a building directory, a switchboard) and a rapid introduction of characters, Serling pulls a viewer almost immediately into his story, a tale of corporate morality—or the lack of it—and such everyday battles as the ones waged between conscience and ambition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvweek.com/news/2008/04/serlings_patterns_an_icon_of_l.php Shales, Tom. "Serling's ''Patterns'' an Icon of Lost Era," ''TV Week'', April 27, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phoenix New City''' or '''Phoenix New Town'''  ({{Zh|s=凤凰新城|t=鳳凰新城}}) is a [[district of China|special district]] of [[Tangshan]], [[People's Republic of China|China]] that developed as its [[central business district]].

==Economy==

Taking advantage of its good ecological environment, Phoenix New City, which is under construction, aims at the domestic first-class CBD development standards. Sixty-eight key projects are comprehensively promoted with a total investment of 63.5 billion [[Renminbi|yuan]].

Different from the traditional expansion type of many cities, Phoenix New City aims at the highest town planning standards in developed countries from the very beginning with commercial, administrative, culture, and green land axes co-existing. "Eco-oriented", "new urbanism", "smart growth" and other advanced international concepts were introduced into the construction to build the domestic first class central business district with eco-tourism and leisure, business services, financial center, the headquarters base, high technology, creative cultural industries, etc.

In accordance with the strategy of inviting business (focusing on inviting global business and strategic investors to improve core competitiveness) which was brought up in early 2010, the Administrative Committee of Tangshan Phoenix New City targeted at [[Fortune 500]] companies home and abroad to carry out a variety of effective activities to invite business, which achieved remarkable results. In 2010, Tangshan received 200 batches of Chinese and foreign visiting groups. Among these groups, 11 are from global Fortune 500 enterprises, 16 are from China fortune 500 enterprises, and 15 are from China's top 500 private enterprises and top 100 specialized enterprises.

Among these projects, the residential and commercial projects co-developed by Hong Kong Kerry Group and China Resources Land Group, as well as the residential and commercial projects co-developed by China Water Power Group and China Petroleum Jidong Oil Company started construction. The South Korean Lotte urban complex project and Pangda Automobile Trade Group Jidong Material Building project reached an agreement with the administrative committee and will start construction in 2011. Yicheng Group urban complex project and Beijing Wanke real estate project will be started soon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14614">A '''public-sector trade union''' (or '''public-sector labor union''') is a [[trade union]] which primarily represents the interests of employees within [[public sector]] or governmental organizations.

==History==
Labor unions generally bypassed government employees because they were controlled mostly by the patronage system used by the political parties before the arrival of civil service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Terry M. Moe|title=Special Interest: Teachers Unions and America's Public Schools|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lDFz6oYRtuIC&amp;pg=PA33|year=2011|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postal unions===
Post Office workers did form unions. The [[National Association of Letter Carriers]] started in 1889 and grew quickly. It had  52 branches with 4,600 members in 1890, and 335 branches by 1892. It focused on forcing postmasters to honor federal law mandating an 8 hour day for federal employees. In 1893 it won a Supreme Court decision and $3.5 million in back overtime pay.  Local postmasters vigorously opposed the union.  It joined the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nalc.org/nalc/facthist/brhist.html |accessdate=May 18, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513230856/http://www.nalc.org/nalc/facthist/brhist.html |archivedate=May 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the mid-1960s it had 175,000 members in 6,400 local branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Morris S. Ogul|title=Congress Oversees the Bureaucracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MxHpmVLxj1kC&amp;pg=PA65|date=15 May 1976|publisher=U. of Pittsburgh Press|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two organizations of postal clerks emerged in the 1890s; they merged in 1899 into the United National Association of Post Office Clerks (UNAPOC).  It was too conservative for the AFL, which in 1906 sponsored the National Federation of Post Office Clerks (NFPOC), which soon surpassed the UNAPOC.  NFPOC grew from 16,000 members in 1922 36,000 in 1932, and nearly{{peacock term|date=October 2015}} 50,000 by 1940. It did not engage in strikes, but spent much of its efforts in opposing hostile Congressional legislation.  Additional rivals were formed in the 1930s but the first serious rival was the National Postal Clerks Union (NPCU) that began in 1958 and by 1970 reach the membership of 80,000.  Merger discussions dragged on for years, until the NFPOC, UNMAPOC and others merged in 1961 as the United Federation of Postal Clerks.  Another round of mergers in 1971 produced the [[American Postal Workers Union]] (APWU).  In 2012 the APWU had 330,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;Gary M Fink, ed., ''Labor Unions'' (1977)  pp 291-94&lt;/ref&gt;

The postal unions did not engage in strikes, but there was the [[U.S. postal strike of 1970]], a two-week wildcat walkout in New York City and 12 other cities by 200,000 of the 750,000 postal employees. It was not officially sponsored and ended when the Army started delivering the mail in "Operation Graphic Hand."&lt;ref&gt;William Gardner Bell, ed., ''Department of the Army Historical Summary: Fiscal Year 1970'' (1973) [http://www.history.army.mil/books/DAHSUM page 15]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1919===
{{main|Boston Police Strike}}
Historian Joseph Slater, says, "Unfortunately for public sector unions, the most searing and enduring image of their history in the first half of the twentieth century was the Boston police strike. The strike was routinely cited by courts and officials through the end of the 1940s."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Slater, "The Boston Police Strike'' in Aaron Brenner et al. eds. ''The Encyclopedia of Strikes in American History'' (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=EHzk54IjNpEC&amp;pg=PA241]&lt;/ref&gt; It came in the strike-ridden year of 1919 when the Boston city police formed a union, affiliated with the AFL, and [[Boston Police Strike|walked out on strike]]. A severe popular backlash came as looting of stores and street violence broke out that terrorized citizens. Governor [[Calvin Coolidge]] sent in the National Guard; there were hundreds of casualties and at least nine deaths. &lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Lyons, "The Boston Police Strike of 1919." ''New England Quarterly'' (1947): 147-168. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/361175 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Coolidge broke the strike and the legislature took control of the police away from city officials. The episode made Coolidge nationally famous--he became the Republican nominee for Vice president in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Russell, ''A city in terror: Calvin Coolidge and the 1919 Boston police strike'' (Beacon Press, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;  

The police strike chilled union interest in the public sector in the 1920s. The major exception was the emergence of unions of public school teachers in the largest cities; they formed the [[American Federation of Teachers]] (AFT), affiliated with the AFL.  In suburbs and small cities, the [[National Education Association]] (NEA) became active, but it insisted it was not a labor union but a professional organization.&lt;ref&gt;Marjorie Murphy, ''Blackboard Unions: The AFT and the NEA, 1900-1980'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Deal era===
Unionization remained uncommon among government employees outside the Post Office. In the mid 1930s efforts were made to unionize  WPA workers, but were opposed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Alan Goldberg, "Contesting the Status of Relief Workers during the New Deal The Workers Alliance of America and the Works Progress Administration, 1935-1941." ''Social Science History'' (2005) 29#3 pp: 337-371.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moe points out that Roosevelt, "an ardent supporter of collective bargaining in the private sector, was opposed to it in the public sector."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Terry M. Moe|title=Special Interest: Teachers Unions and America's Public Schools|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lDFz6oYRtuIC&amp;pg=PA33|year=2011|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roosevelt in 1937 told the nation what the position of his government was:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All Government employees should realize that the process of collective bargaining, as usually understood, cannot be transplanted into the public service. It has its distinct and insurmountable limitations when applied to public personnel management. The very nature and purposes of government make it impossible for administrative officials to represent fully or to bind the employer in mutual discussions with government employee organizations. The employer is the whole people, who speak by means of laws enacted by their representatives in Congress. Accordingly, administrative officials and employees alike are governed and guided, and in many instances restricted, by laws which establish policies, procedures, or rules in personnel matters. Particularly, I want to emphasize my conviction that militant tactics have no place in the functions of any organization of government employees. Upon employees in the Federal service rests the obligation to serve the whole people, whose interests and welfare require orderliness and continuity in the conduct of government activities. This obligation is paramount. Since their own services have to do with the functioning of the Government, a strike of public employees manifests nothing less than an intent on their part to prevent or obstruct the operations of Government until their demands are satisfied. Such action, looking toward the paralysis of Government by those who have sworn to support it, is unthinkable and intolerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=15445#axzz1Jy35UQb9 |title=Franklin D. Roosevelt: Letter on the Resolution of Federation of Federal Employees Against Strikes in Federal Service |publisher=Presidency.ucsb.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Wagner Act of 1935 facilitated unions in the private sector but did not apply to the public sector in state or local government, since the federal government could not interfere in state government.&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Kearney and David G. Carnevale, ''Labor relations in the public sector'' (2001) pp 1-22&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Little New Deal" era===
Change came in the 1950s. In 1958 New York mayor [[Robert Wagner, Jr.]] issued an executive order, called  "the little Wagner Act," giving city employees certain bargaining rights, and gave their unions with exclusive representation (that is, the unions alone were legally authorized to speak for all city workers, regardless of whether or not some workers were members.)  Management complained but the unions had power in city politics.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony C. Russo, "Management's View of the New York City Experience," ''Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science'' Vol. 30, No. 2, "Unionization of Municipal Employees" (Dec., 1970), pp. 81-93 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1173366 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first U.S. state to permit [[collective bargaining]] by public employees was Wisconsin, in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/18/the-first-blow-against-public-employees/hitting-the-unions-where-it-hurts |title=Hitting the Unions Where It Hurts |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=2011-07-18 |accessdate=2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collective bargaining is now permitted in three fourths of U.S. states.&lt;ref name="watershed"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/19/us/19union.html|title=A Watershed Moment for Public-Sector Unions|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
By the 1960s and 1970s public-sector unions expanded rapidly to cover teachers, clerks, firemen, police, prison guards and others. In 1962, President [[John Kennedy]] issued [[Executive Order 10988]], upgrading the status of unions of federal workers.&lt;ref&gt;David Schultz, ''Encyclopedia of public administration and public policy'' (2004) p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent years==
After 1960 public sector unions grew rapidly and secured good wages and high pensions for their members. While manufacturing and farming steadily declined, state- and local-government employment quadrupled from 4 million workers in 1950 to 12 million in 1976 and 16.6 million in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Census Bureau,  [https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/governments/cb10-132.html "Census Bureau Reports State and Local Government Employment Remains at 16.6 Million" (press release Aug. 10, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Adding in the 3.7 million federal civilian employees there were 20 million government employees. In 2010 8.4 million government workers were represented by unions,&lt;ref&gt;This includes some people who are covered by union contracts but are not themselves members.&lt;/ref&gt; including 31% of federal workers, 35% of state workers and 46% of local workers.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labour Statistics, [http://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.t03.htm "Table 3. Union affiliation of employed wage and salary workers by occupation and industry"]&lt;/ref&gt;  As Daniel Disalvo notes, "In today's public sector, good pay, generous benefits, and job security make possible a stable middle-class existence for nearly everyone from janitors to jailors."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Disalvo, [http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-trouble-with-public-sector-unions "The Trouble with Public Sector Unions," ''National Affairs" (issue 5 Fall 2010) ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the U.S. membership of public sector unions surpassed membership of private sector unions for the first time, at 7.9m and 7.4m respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-trouble-with-public-sector-unions |title=The Trouble with Public Sector Unions &gt; Publications &gt; |publisher=National Affairs |date=2010-09-17 |accessdate=2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 states faced a growing fiscal crisis and the Republicans had made major gains in the 2010 elections. Public sector unions came under heavy attack [[2011 Wisconsin budget protests|especially in Wisconsin]], as well as Indiana, New Jersey and Ohio from conservative Republican legislatures.&lt;ref name="watershed"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Logan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/mar/11/us-unions-wisconsin |title=Is this the end for organised labour in the US? &amp;#124; John Logan &amp;#124; Comment is free |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/18/the-first-blow-against-public-employees |title=The First Blow Against Public Employees - Room for Debate |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=2011-02-18 |accessdate=2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/state-budget-crisis/index.html |title=States in budget crisis |publisher=The Washington Post |date= |accessdate=2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative state legislatures tried to drastically reduce the abilities of unions to collectively bargain.  Conservatives argued that public unions were too powerful since they helped elect their bosses, and that overly generous pension systems were too heavy a drain on state budgets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Theda Skocpol|author2=Vanessa Williamson|title=The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gm56Pg3um2IC&amp;pg=PA192|year=2012|publisher=Oxford UP|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sebastian Luke (Seb) Bishop''' (born 1974)&lt;ref name="Register"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=Patrick|last2=Davies|first2=Ian F|title=Highgate School Register 1833-1988|page=432|edition=7th|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the CEO of [[Goop (company)|GOOP]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]'s lifestyle company, from 2011 to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Emily|title=Goop CEO quits after Paltrow’s ‘uncoupling’|url=https://pagesix.com/2014/04/16/gwyneths-goop-ceo-quits-in-corporate-uncoupling/?_ga=1.63963820.2064880802.1392929408|accessdate=11 August 2017|work=[[Page Six]]|date=17 April 2014|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to joining GOOP, Bishop was the International CEO of (RED), the organisation created by [[Bono]] and [[Bobby Shriver]] to raise money for [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]]. He had previously started the firm [[Espotting]] at the age of 26.&lt;ref name="Miva.com"/&gt;

Bishop was educated at [[Highgate School]]&lt;ref name="Register"/&gt; and began Espotting with his school-friend [[Daniel Ishag]] in a basement flat in 2000. He expanded the business across Europe before merging with US based FindWhat.com in June 2004 in a deal which valued the company at $186m.&lt;ref name="Miva.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.miva.com/us/content/about/pressroom/pressreleases/pressrelease.asp?page=070104 |title=Miva Merchant &amp;#124; Ecommerce Software and Hosting |publisher=Miva.com |date= |accessdate=9 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121201110/http://www.miva.com/us/content/about/pressroom/pressreleases/pressrelease.asp?page=070104 |archivedate=21 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt; He is also the Chairman of Steak, a search-inspired communications agency.  

In 2007 Bishop was one of 8 British entrepreneurs featured in the Channel 4 documentary 'Millionaires' Mission.' He spent 3 weeks in a remote region of [[Uganda]], using Western entrepreneurial skills to try and bring sustainable relief from poverty to affected communities.&lt;ref name="channel1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/microsites/A/africa/index.html |title=Millionaires' Mission |publisher=Channel 4 |date= |accessdate=9 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526054644/http://www.channel4.com/news/microsites/A/africa/index.html |archivedate=26 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Bishop and (RED)==
He joined (RED) as their International CEO in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Luke Heads (RED)|journal=The Cholmeleian|issue=Winter 2009|page=7|url=http://www.highgateschool.org.uk/images/news/cholmeleian_winter09.pdf|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of (RED) was that the companies could make products using the (RED) logo in exchange for donating up to half their profits from those products directly to the Global Fund for AIDS programs in Africa.  

Since launch (RED) has grown to 9 partners (and growing): American Express (UK only), Converse, Gap, Emporio Armani, Dell, Windows, Apple, Hallmark and Starbucks. On 1 December 2008 (World AIDS Day), (RED)wire was launched – (RED)'s music subscription service.

(RED) partners and events have generated over $120 million to help eliminate AIDS in Africa through The Global Fund (January 2009).

==Espotting and MIVA (now Vertro)==
In 2000, at the age of 26, Bishop founded Espotting – the company that pioneered [[search marketing]] and [[pay per click|Pay-Per-Click]] advertising in Europe. He expanded the business across Europe before merging with US based FindWhat.com in June 2004 in a deal which valued the company at $186m.&lt;ref name="Miva.com"/&gt; In 2005, he led the global rebrand of the combined company under the MIVA name. Following the merger Bishop became President and chief marketing officer of MIVA ({{NASDAQ|MIVA}}). The online advertising model of Pay-Per-Click advertising which Luke pioneered in 2000 has driven much of the growth in the online advertising market, and in 2003 both [[Google]] (with their AdWords programme)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/press/pressrel/adwords_uk.html |title=U.K. news announcements – News from Google – Google |publisher=Google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=9 August 2014}} {{404|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yahoo!]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corporate-ir.net/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=over&amp;script=410&amp;layout=-6&amp;item_id=456317]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050408061217/http://www.corporate-ir.net/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=over&amp;script=410&amp;layout=-6&amp;item_id=456317 |date=8 April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently followed Espotting into the UK market.

One of the youngest presidents of a [[NASDAQ]] listed company (appointed to the role at the age of 31), Bishop began working in advertising at the age of 14 at Yellowhammer during his summer holidays and at 19 joined [[Publicis]] as an [[art director]]. From Publicis he moved on to Rainey Kelly Campbell Rolfe and was part of the company when they successfully took over [[Young &amp; Rubicam|Y&amp;R]] London. During his advertising agency years, Luke created the award-winning campaign that launched [[Coca-Cola]] in Russia as well as campaigns for some of the world's most famous brands including [[Virgin Group|Virgin]], [[Diet Coke]], [[hewlett-packard|HP]], [[Renault]] and [[Nintendo]].

Under Bishop's leadership, Espotting and MIVA have won a number of industry awards including 'Most Dynamic UK Media Company' (Media Momentum Awards), 'Fastest growing IT company' (Europe's 500 Awards) and 'Top 50 Creative Business' (''[[Financial Times]]'').

==''Millionaires' Mission''==
In 2007 Bishop featured in ''Millionairess' Mission'',&lt;ref name="channel1"/&gt; a new [[Channel 4]] documentary in which eight British business leaders spend three weeks in a remote region of [[Uganda]], using Western entrepreneurial skills to try and bring sustainable relief from poverty to affected communities.

In the programme, Bishop helped create two businesses within the local communities – a farmer's co-operative and Teach Inn, an innovative eco-tourism hotel.

The first episode of the 4-part series aired on Channel 4 in the UK on 19 September 2007.&lt;ref name="channel1"/&gt;

In [[finance]], '''seniority''' refers to the order of repayment in the event of a sale or [[bankruptcy]] of the issuer. Seniority can refer to either [[debt]] or [[preferred stock]]. Senior debt must be repaid before subordinated (or junior) debt is repaid.&lt;ref&gt;The American Heritage Dictionary of Businessurt Publishing Company, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Each security, either debt or equity, that a company issues has a specific seniority or ranking. Bonds that have the same seniority in a company's [[capital structure]] are described as being [[pari passu]]. Preferred stock is '''senior''' to common stock in a sale when preferred shareholders must receive back their '''preference''', typically their original investment amount, before the common shareholders receive anything.

==FpML==
The seniority of bonds recognised in [[FpML]] (Financial products Markup Language) are as follows:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15230">A '''service system''' (or '''customer service system''', '''CSS''') is a configuration of technology and organizational networks designed to deliver [[Service (economics)|services]] that satisfy the needs, wants, or aspirations of customers.

"Service system" is a term very frequently used in the [[service management]], service operations, [[services marketing]], service engineering, and [[service design]] literature. While the term frequently appears, it is rarely defined.

One recent definition of a service system is a value coproduction configuration of people, technology, internal and external service systems connected via value propositions, and shared information (language, laws, measures, etc.).   The smallest service system is a single [[person]] and the largest service system is the [[world economy]].  The external service system of the global economy is considered to be [[ecosystem services]].  Service systems can be characterized by the [[Value (economics)|value]] that results from [[interaction]] between service systems, whether the interactions are between people, businesses, or nations.  Most service system interactions aspire to be win-win, non-coercive, and non-intrusive.  However, some service systems may perform coercive service activities.  For example, agents of the state may use coercion in accordance with laws of the land.

Another definition for service system&lt;ref name=Cardoso2015&gt;{{cite book | first1=Jorge | last1=Cardoso | first2=Hansjörg | last2=Fromm | first3=Stefan | last3=Nickel | first4=Gerhard | last4=Satzger | first5=Rudi | last5=Studer | first6=Christof | last6=Weinhardt | title=Fundamentals of Service Systems | edition=1st | publisher=Springer | year=2015 | url=https://www.springer.com/978-3-319-23194-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that a service system consists of elements (e.g., people, facilities, tools, and computer programs) that have a [[structure]] (i.e., an organization), a [[behavior]] (possibly described as a [[business process]]), and a [[purpose]] (or [[goal]]).

A service system worldview is a [[system of systems]] that interact via value propositions.

A much simpler and more limited definition is that a service system is a [[work system]] that produces services. A work system is a system in which human participants and/or machines perform work (processes and activities) using information, technology, and other resources to produce products/services for internal or external customers. Co-production occurs in work systems in which customers are also participants, e.g., many work systems that provide medical care, education, and consulting. (Alter, 2013)

== History ==
Usages of the term '''service system''' (bold added) are provided below:

The earliest known usage of the phrase service system in a book title is ''Stochastic Service Systems'' by John Riordan.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book|author=Riordan, John|title=Stochastic Service Systems|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|year=1962|pages=x + 139 pp.&amp;nbsp;Illus|quote="Anyone seeking an introduction to queueing theory..."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/citation/137/3532/742-a|journal=Science|title=Book review: Stochastic Service Systems by John Riordan|date=7 September 1962|volume=137|number=3532|page=742|doi=10.1126/science.137.3532.742-a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usages from Quinn and Paquette (1990) Technology in Services: Creating Organizational Revolutions. MIT Sloan Management Review. 31(2).

"Properly designed '''service technology systems''' allow relatively inexperienced people to perform very sophisticated tasks quickly—vaulting them over normal learning curve delays."

''Examples:'' "Domino's Pizza ... industrial engineering and food science research automated the making of a pizza to as near a science as possible, eliminating much of the drudgery in such tasks, yet ensuring higher quality and uniformity. Then, finding that its store managers were still spending fifteen to twenty hours per week on paperwork, Domino's introduced NCR "mini-tower" systems at its stores to handle all of the ordering, payroll, marketing, cash flow, inventory, and work control functions ... Federal Express ... Its DADS (computer aided delivery) and COSMOS II(automated tracking) systems give FedEx maximum responsiveness."

''Inferred definition:'' Service systems, also known as service technology systems, are designed to allow inexperienced people to perform very sophisticated service provisioning tasks quickly.

Usages from Cook, Goh, and Chung (1999) Service Typologies: A State of the Art Survey.  ''Production and Operations Management'', 8(3).

"Customer contact is one of the primary criteria used to classify service operations and refers to the physical presence of the customers in the service system during the provision of the service...  '''Service systems''' can be placed on a continuum that ranges from high customer contact to low customer contact during the creation of the service."

"Capital intensity of the '''service system''' also serves as the basis of classification... The capital intensity of the '''service system''' ranges from low to high."

"The level of customer involvement in the creation of a service is also a dimension used to classify services... Customer involvement means the level of interaction the customer has with the '''service system''' and the level to which the customer can actually affect the service delivery process."

"Customer satisfaction is the most basic concept underlying TQM.  It is, therefore, of critical importance that the '''service system''' and the services it is designed to deliver satisfy the needs and wants of the organization's customers."

"Not only does one have to consider the implications on product design and how this affects marketing, but is also may have significant implications for the design of the '''service system'''. This illustrates the need to address interactions between the marketing and operations functions and to integrate these functions for the betterment of the firm."

"The environment in which a service organization operates will be instrumental in determining how the '''service system''', as well as the services themselves, should be designed... Global service organizations must also appreciate and understand local customers, laws, and culture to successfully operate internationally."

''Examples:'' "Pure services (e.g., health centers and personal services) represent the highest level of customer contact. Progressing down the continuum toward lower custom contact are mixed services (e.g., branch offices of post offices), quasimanufacturing (e.g., home office of banks), and manufacturing (e.g., automobile assembly plants)... ...When a client contracts with an architect to design a home, a relationship involving high customer involvement is created. On the other hand, a customer who has purchased an airline ticket has little opportunity for involvement in the service delivery or to impact how the service is  going to be provided."

''Inferred definition:'' Service systems are organizations designed to delivery services that satisfy the needs and wants of the organization's customers.  Marketing, operations, and global environment considerations have significant implications for the design of a service system. Three criteria used to classify service systems include: customer contact, capital intensity, and level of customer involvement.

Usages from Lusch, Vargo, and Malter (2006) Marketing as Service-Exchange: Taking a Leadership Role in Global Marketing Management. ''Organizational Dynamics'', 35(3).

"Stated alternatively, service-dominant logic offers opportunity for the organization to focus on selling a flow of service. This would encourage it to determine the optimal configuration of goods, if any, for a level of service, the optimal organization or network configuration to maintain the service, and the optimal payment mechanism in exchange for providing the service. That is, the organization is encouraged to think about the '''service ''system'''''."

''Examples:'' "For example, if a heating and air conditioning equipment manufacturer views itself in the temperature control business, then it could decide to sell climate control for a building rather than just mechanical devices.  It could charge per cubic foot of climate maintained on a monthly or annual basis and/or through a payment plan involving gain sharing, in which costs are reduced as system performance rises, thus benefiting financially both the firm and the customer. A seller entering into such an arrangement has an incentive to look at everything about the building that will influence heating and cooling costs."

''Inferred definition:'' Service systems are optimal configurations of goods, organizational networks, and payment mechanisms for providing a level of service.

=== Design ===
Marketing, operations, and global environment considerations have significant implications for the design of a service system. Three criteria used to classify service systems include:
* customer contact,
* capital intensity, and
* level of customer involvement.
Properly designed service systems employ technology or organizational networks that can allow relatively inexperienced people to perform very sophisticated tasks quickly—vaulting them over normal [[learning curve]] delays.  Ideally, [[empowerment]] of both service provider [[employees]] and [[customers]] (often via [[self service]]) results from well designed service systems.

=== Types of service design ===
Service systems range from an individual person equipped with tools of the trade (e.g., architect, entrepreneur) to a portion of a government agency or business (e.g., branch office of a post office or bank) to complete multinational corporations and their information systems (e.g., Domino's Pizza, Federal Express).  Hospitals, universities, cities, and national governments are designed service systems.

The language, norms, attitudes, and beliefs of the people that make up a service system may evolve over time, as people adjust to new circumstances.  In this sense, service systems are a type of [[complex system]] that is partially designed and partially evolving.  Service systems are designed to deliver or ''provision'' services, but they often consume services as well.

Every service system is both a [[service provider]] and a customer of multiple types of [[Service (economics)|services]]. Because service systems are designed both in how they provision and consume services, services systems are often linked into a complex service [[value chain]] or [[value network]] where each link is a [[value proposition]].  Service systems may be nested inside of service systems (e.g., staff and operating room unit inside a hospital that is part of a nationwide healthcare provider network).

Service system designers or architects often seek to exploit an economic [[:wikt:complementarity|complementarity]] or [[network effect]] to rapidly grow and scale up the service.  For example, credit cards usage is part of a service system in which the more people and businesses that use and accept the credit cards, the more value the credit cards have to the provider and all stakeholders in the service system.  Service system innovation often requires integrating technology innovation, business model (or value proposition) innovation, social-organizational innovation, and demand (new customer wants, needs, aspirations) innovation.

For example, a national service system may be designed with policies that enable more [[citizens]] (the customers of the nation) to become an [[entrepreneur]], and thereby create more innovation and wealth for the nation.  Service systems may include [[payment]] mechanisms for selecting a level of service to be provided (upfront or one time payment) or payment based on downstream value sharing or taxation derived from customers who received the benefit of the service (downstream or ongoing payment). Payments may also be in the form of [[credit (creative arts)]] or other types of intangible value (see [[anthropological theories of value]] and [[theory of value (economics)|theory of value]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="639">In [[finance]], a '''structurer''' is a person who designs [[structured product]]s and determines how the pay rules will distribute [[cash flow]]s for a deal.  Structurers will also typically build [[Computer simulation|computer model]]s to mimic the pay rules in order to see how collateral payments affect the bond payments. 
All the above should be done before a deal settles, afterward it should be in the hands of the Bond administration to apply the rules as described in the deal [[Legal instrument|legal document]]s.

'''''The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine''''' is a non-fiction book by [[Michael Lewis]] about the build-up of the [[United States housing bubble]] during the 2000s. The book was released on March 15, 2010, by [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]. It spent 28 weeks on ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[The New York Times best seller list|best-seller list]], and was the basis for a 2015 [[The Big Short (film)|film of the same name]].

==Summary==
''The Big Short'' describes several of the main players in the creation of the [[credit default swap]] market that sought to bet against the [[collateralized debt obligation]] (CDO) [[economic bubble|bubble]] and thus ended up profiting from the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]]. The book also highlights the eccentric nature of the type of person who bets against the market or goes against the grain.

The work follows people who believed the bubble was going to burst, like [[Meredith Whitney]], who predicted the demise of [[Citigroup]] and [[Bear Stearns]]; [[Steve Eisman]], an outspoken [[hedge fund]] manager; [[Greg Lippmann]], a [[Deutsche Bank]] trader; Eugene Xu, a [[quantitative analyst]] who created the first CDO market by matching buyers and sellers; the founders of [[Cornwall Capital]], who started a hedge fund in their garage with $110,000 and built it into $120&amp;nbsp;million when the market crashed; and [[Michael Burry]], an ex-[[neurologist]] who created [[Scion Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Michael, [http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2010/04/wall-street-excerpt-201004 Betting on the Blind Side"], ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also highlights some people involved in the biggest losses created by the market crash: like [[Merrill Lynch|Merrill]]'s $300 million mezzanine CDO manager Wing Chau; [[Howie Hubler]], known as the person who lost $9&amp;nbsp;billion in one trade, the largest single loss in history;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.observer.com/people/howie-hubler "Stories on Howie Hubler"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823043941/http://www.observer.com/people/howie-hubler |date=August 23, 2010 }}, ''[[The New York Observer]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Joseph Cassano]]'s [[AIG Financial Products]], which suffered over $99&amp;nbsp;billion in losses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29455792/ "U.S. offers more funds to help fraught AIG: $30 billion more in loans; $61.7 billion lost in the fourth quarter"], [[MSNBC]], March 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The book was shortlisted for the 2010 [[Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award|''Financial Times'' and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award]]. It spent 28 weeks on ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} non-fiction bestseller list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawes.com/2010/2010-10-10.pdf|title=The New York Times Bestseller List|publisher=The New York Times|date=October 10, 2010|accessdate=2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
It also received the 2011 [[Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights Book Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RFK Center Book Awards|url=http://rfkcenter.org/who-we-are/awards/rfk-book-awards/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Maya Declaration''' is a statement of common principles regarding the development of [[financial inclusion]] policy made by a group of developing nation regulatory institutions during the [[Alliance for Financial Inclusion|Alliance for Financial Inclusion's (AFI)]] 2011 [[AFI Global Policy Forum|Global Policy Forum]] held in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/maya-declaration-urges-financial-inclusion-for-worlds-unbanked-populations-130887928.html|title=Maya Declaration Urges Financial Inclusion for Worlds Unbanked |publisher=PR Newswire|date= |accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The Maya Declaration is broad in nature, focusing on: creating the right environment; implementing the correct framework; ensuring consumer protection measures are taken and using data to inform and track financial inclusion efforts. This declaration was made through the [[Alliance for Financial Inclusion]] network of regulatory institutions and although no vote was taken, the common principles have been implicitly adopted by all of the network's members.

17 of the institutions followed up on the declaration with very specific commitments for their national efforts. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhMt-wa0HA4 Superintendencia de Banca, Seguros y AFP (SBS) del Peru] for example, committed to "enact a law regulating the use of electronic money and to increase correspondent cashiers from 30% to 50%". While the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdi8uV83ChI&amp;list=UUrPqBAv5iDzM_FLVVw9n8Ag&amp;index=9&amp;feature=plpp_video Comision Nacional Bancarias y de Valores (CNBV) Mexico] committed to having "a banking agent or a banking branch in every municipality by 2014".

The specific nature of these and other commitments under the broad principles of the Maya Declaration have attracted the attention of other international organizations with an interest in financial inclusion including the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), [[GSMA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsma.com/articles/gpf-2011-ends-successfully-with-the-signing-of-the-maya-declaration-on-financial-inclusion/18687/|title=GPF 2011 Successfully Ends with Signing of Maya Declaration|publisher= GSMA|date= |accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[World Bank]], the G20&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpfi.org/featured/afi-member-countries-make-financial-inclusion-commitments-line-g20-principles|title=AFI Member Countries Make Financial Inclusion Commitments|publisher= GPFI|date= |accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Princess Máxima of the Netherlands]] in her capacity as UN Secretary-General’s Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koninklijkhuis.nl/globale-paginas/taalrubrieken/english/speeches/speeches-archive/|title=Speech by Princess Máxima of the Netherlands UNSG’s Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development.|publisher= Het Koninklijk Huis|date= |accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Maya Declaration on Financial Inclusion'''

:
:We, the Members of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion, a network of central banks, supervisors and other financial regulatory authorities met in Riviera Maya, Mexico, 28 to 30 September 2011, on the occasion of the Third AFI Global Policy Forum,

:
:''Recognize'' the critical importance of financial inclusion to empowering and transforming the lives of all our people, especially the poor, its role in improving national and global financial stability and integrity and its essential contribution to strong and inclusive growth in developing and emerging market countries;

:
:''Reaffirm'' the value of peer-to-peer knowledge exchange and learning among financial regulators and policymakers for the design and implementation of innovative financial inclusion policy solutions relevant to the developing world;

:
:''Recall'' our efforts over the last two years to strengthen and expand the AFI network and to identify and explore high-priority areas for financial inclusion policy in the developing world through AFI’s working groups;

:
:''Commit'' as a network of developing and emerging market financial regulators and policymakers to:

::a.    Putting in place a financial inclusion policy that creates an enabling environment for costeffective access to financial services that makes full use of appropriate innovative technology and substantially lowers the unit cost of financial services;

::b.   Implementing a sound and proportional regulatory framework that achieves the complementary goals of financial inclusion, financial stability, and financial integrity;

::c.    Recognizing consumer protection and empowerment as key pillars of financial inclusion efforts to ensure that all people are included in their country’s financial sector;

::d.    Making evidence-based financial inclusion policy a priority by collecting and analyzing comprehensive data, tracking the changing profile of financial inclusion, and producing comparable indicators in the network.

:
:We remain dedicated to making financial inclusion a reality through concerted domestic and global actions, and actively sharing our knowledge and experience through the AFI network. We commit to delivering concrete financial inclusion outcomes for the developing world to provide sustainable, relevant, cost-effective, and meaningful financial services for the world’s financially unserved populations.

'''''{{lang|ms|Universiti Sains Malaysia}}''''' (acronym: '''USM)''' is the only Accelerated Programs for Excellence (APEX) government funded [[Autonomous university|Autonomous]] [[university]] in  [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20110715172754844|title=MALAYSIA: Autonomy for five universities - University World News|website=www.universityworldnews.com|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/277499|title=Four more universities get autonomy|website=www.thesundaily.my|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; USM is a full spectrum highest sustainability conceptualized university in the region, striving to achieve "GLOBAL sustainable university status". Founded on 1 June 1969 as a statutory body with its own constitution, it is among the oldest institute of higher learning (IHL) in Northern [[Malaysia]]. It has three campuses, a main campus on the island of [[Penang]], a health campus in [[Kelantan]], and an [[Universiti Sains Malaysia Engineering Campus|engineering campus]] in [[Nibong Tebal]]. There is overseas collaboration with KLE University, [[India]] offering the Doctor of Medicine (USM) undergraduate degree. USM plans to open a Global Campus (Kuala Lumpur Campus) located at Kuala Lumpur Education City (KLCE).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.klec.com.my/klecgroup/group-partners-03.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usm.my/index.php/about-usm/news-archive/67-papercutting-/6643-USM-to-join-KL-Academic-Park-.html&lt;/ref&gt; With around 28,300 postgraduate and undergraduate students in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usm.my/index.php/en/about-usm/making-a-difference/facts-a-figures.html]&lt;/ref&gt; USM is one of the biggest universities in terms of enrolment in Malaysia. The number of [[lecturer]]s is about 1,479, which leads to a student-lecturer ratio of around 19:1.

==History==
The idea of a university in Penang was first mooted by [[D. S. Ramanathan]] in 1959 in the State Assembly and later crystallised when he was nominated chairman of the Penang University Project committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Community/2013/10/05/George-Towns-first-mayor-a-fiery-man/|title=Community: George Town's first mayor a fiery man Community|authors=wong chun wai|website=The Star Online|date=5 August 2013|accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisition of a piece of land in Sungai Ara was then followed by the ceremonial laying of the foundation stone by the then Prime Minister of Malaysia, Y.T.M Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj on 7 August 1967.

USM was established as a statutory body in 1969 as the second university in Malaysia. It was first known as '''Universiti Pulau Pinang'''. The university operated on borrowed premises at the Malayan Teachers' Training College at Gelugor. In 1971, it moved to its present 239-hectare site at Minden (formerly [[Minden Barracks]] of the [[British Far East Command]]) in [[Gelugor]], 10 kilometres from the city of Georgetown.

There are two other USM campuses: one at [[Kubang Kerian]] in [[Kelantan]], known as the Health campus, and the other at Seri Ampangan, [[Nibong Tebal]] in [[Penang]], known as the Engineering campus. The former houses the School of Medical Sciences, the School of Health Sciences and the School of Dental Sciences, while the latter houses the six engineering schools.

Universiti Sains Malaysia teaches in the fields of Pure Sciences, Applied Sciences, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Building Science and Technology, Social Sciences, Humanities and Education as well as conducts research.

USM offers courses at undergraduate and postgraduate levels to more than 28,000 students. USM has won the Asian Innovation Award in which USM emerged as the only winner from this country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usm.my/en/pdf/prospectus08.pdf|title=USM - Universiti Sains Malaysia Official Website - Utama|publisher=|accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
The management of the university is carried out through the executive power of the Board of Directors, made up of members chosen from the university, representatives from government departments and those appointed by the Ministry of Higher Education. There are three Deputy Vice-Chancellors led by the Vice-Chancellor.

===Ombudsman===
In August 2011 USM created a new role of Ombudsman to deal with staff issues and protect whistleblowers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/123456789/19542 USM to set up ombudsman] Retrieved on 12/08/11&lt;/ref&gt;  The USM Ombudsman is Prof. Dato' Seri Dr. MD. Salleh Yaapar, who is a former staff of the USM and is on a rolling 2-year contract.

===Chief Integrity Officer===
In July 2012, following a presentation by the Chief of [[Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission]], the VC of USM promises to create a new role of Chief Integrity Officer to cultivate academic integrity among students, lecturers and staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2012/7/21/nation/11703783&amp;sec=nation] Retrieved on 22 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
The current Chief Integrity Officer is Khairul Anuar Che Azmi, the university’s first ombudsman and is also the Legal Advisor.

==Academic programmes==
Twenty four academic schools, 14 centres and 7 units have been established. Of the schools, 12 are applied science and technology-based schools: Civil Engineering, Aerospace Engineering; Chemical Engineering; Electrical and Electronic Engineering; Materials and Mineral Resources Engineering; Mechanical Engineering; Housing, Building and Planning; Industrial Technology; Medical Sciences; Dental Sciences; Health Sciences; and Pharmaceutical Sciences. The three liberal arts schools are Educational Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences. The pure science schools are Biological Sciences, Chemical Sciences, Mathematical Sciences, Computer Sciences, and Physics, all of which offer courses that are similar to those available in other universities. There is offshore collaboration with KLE University, [[India]] offering the Doctor of Medicine(USM) undergraduate degree. This offshore five-year M.D. programme is conducted at the [[Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College (Belgaum)]], KLE University, Belgaum, [[India]]. In [[India]], USM also has a collaboration with the James Lind Institute for conducting [[Translational Medicine]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://202.170.56.249/index.php/en/news-archive/9352-usm-komited-bantu-negara-palestin-perkukuh-jenama-di-india.html|title=USM KOMITED BANTU NEGARA PALESTIN, PERKUKUH JENAMA DI INDIA|first=Mohd.

In December 1989, the School of Management was set up, having evolved from the Management program within the School of Social Sciences. As part of its continuing expansion, the university established the School of Computer Sciences and the School of Communication as of March 1995.

In 2008, Professor [[Maqsudul Alam]], set up the Centre for Chemical Biology (CCB)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccb.usm.my/index.php/en/|title=Home|first=Super|last=User|website=www.ccb.usm.my|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he became its first Chief Executive Officer and Director, and sequenced the genome for rubber in Malaysia.

The centres and ancillary services include the Centre for Languages and Translation, the National Poison Centre, the Doping Control Centre, the Centre for Archaeological Research Malaysia, the Centre for Educational Technology and Multimedia, the Computer Centre, the Centre for Knowledge, Communication and Technology and the Islamic Centre. There are research centres, namely the Centre for Policy Research, the Centre for Drug Research and the Centre for Marine and Coastal Studies. The distance education program offered through the School of Distance Education was adopted by the university in 1971.
[[File:Main gate at the Universiti Sains Malaysia.jpg|thumb|The main gate of the main campus]]
USM is one of five universities in Malaysia that have been identified as [[research]]-intensive universities, with the other being [[University of Malaya]], [[Universiti Putra Malaysia]], [[University of Technology, Malaysia|Universiti Teknologi Malaysia]] and [[Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia]].

== Campuses ==
The Main campus has the name of a German city ([[Minden]]) because the campus was built on the territory of the former British [[Minden Barracks]], which themselves were named after the [[Battle of Minden]].

Besides the main campus in Minden, USM has one at [[Kubang Kerian]] in [[Kelantan]] known as Health Campus and another at Seri Ampangan, [[Nibong Tebal]] in mainland Penang known as [[Engineering Campus]].

Started as a USM hospital in 1982, the Health campus has expanded after the School of Medical Science was moved from the main campus to the present site which is 73 hectares. The School of Medical Science was moved from the main campus in June 1984. There are two other schools in the health campus — the School of Dental Science and the School of Allied Health Sciences.

The [[Universiti Sains Malaysia Engineering Campus|Engineering Campus]] was originally located at [[Tronoh]], Perak, and named Perak Branch Campus (KCP). After operating in the state for 15 years (1986–2001), the [[Universiti Sains Malaysia Engineering Campus|Engineering Campus]] moved to the present site in [[Nibong Tebal]], Penang.

== Schools ==
USM is the one of the Malaysian public universities to use term [[school]] (in Malay; ''Pusat Pengajian'') instead of the term [[Faculty (division)|faculty]] that is used in other Malaysian public universities.

== Research ==
[[File:USMDewanTuanku.jpg|left|thumb|Dewan Tuanku Syed Putra: The main auditorium of USM on the main campus on [[Penang|Penang Island]]]]
The Science Fund funding is the main source of R&amp;D for USM. However, to promote research, the university allocates money from its operating funds annually as incentive and for short-term research purposes. External funds, mainly in the form of research grants, awards and consultancies won by individual academic staff members, also feature prominently. There are external sources of funding as well, but these are largely ad hoc and do not, as a rule, result in the development of major research facilities. Some external research links have been established through individual and through institutional networking arrangements.

=== Research areas ===
Research areas at USM include brain and neuroscience, environmental science, aquaculture, biomedical and pharmaceutical studies, natural language processing and computer aided translation, information technology, food technology, polymer science and technology,  biotechnology, distance education, geographical information system, structure analysis, materials science, engineering, surface chemistry, and robotic vision. Penang has research facilities for collaborative search, particularly in coastal pollution, mangrove ecosystem and marine aquaculture.

== Education ==

=== Graduate studies ===
[[File:USMInternational.jpg|thumb|The international office of USM now known as International Mobility &amp; Collaboration Centre or IMCC]]
USM offers three modes of study for the graduate programmes, i.e., by research, by a combination of coursework and research (mixed mode), or by coursework. In 2009, there were 9,011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usm.my/index.php/en/about-usm/making-a-difference/facts-a-figures.html |title=BASIC DATA - UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA}}&lt;/ref&gt; students in the master’s and doctoral level programmes with 24.9% of them  nationals from more than 40 countries. The majority of the foreign students are from other parts of Southeast Asia as well as the [[Middle East]].

=== Undergraduate studies ===
Almost all undergraduate degree programmes at the university require a minimum full-time residence of three years. Degrees in engineering, health sciences, pharmacy, medicine and dentistry require minimum periods of study between four and five years. Most undergraduate courses are taught in English, especially in science courses, except for humanities and social science. International students have to demonstrate a level of proficiency in the national language as part of the entrance criteria. However they will be taught as one of compulsory subjects once they enroll as a student. 

=== Other study programmes ===
USM has programmes for foreign students, and they can undertake one or two semesters. These students are considered full-time and enjoy the benefits of USM's academic and physical facilities.

The School of Distance Education was established in 1971 to provide opportunities for local working adults to obtain a tertiary qualification. These students are able to undertake undergraduate courses while they are in full-time employment. At present four undergraduate degree programmes are available through distance learning: Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Social Science, Bachelor of Arts, and Bachelor of Management.

=== Collaboration with Overseas Universities ===
The University and the [[University of Indonesia]] (UI) collaborates with the [[Singapore University of Social Sciences]] (SUSS) on SUSS’s BA Malay Language and Literature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collaborations with Overseas Universities|url=http://www.suss.edu.sg/Partnership/UProgrammes/Pages/Overview.aspx|newspaper=SUSS|date=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Activities==
[[File:USMFootball.jpg|thumb|The football field on USM main campus]]
USM has facilities for student accommodation, sporting and recreation. The university offers housing for approximately 75% of its students. They are known as student villages or hostels (''Desasiswa'' in Malay), and they are on campus. Cafeterias can be found all around the university area.

USM provides sporting facilities such as archery range, cricket, football field, badminton courts, tennis courts, hockey ground, rugby field, softball, squash courts, and basketball courts. Its ground was used for the [[2008 U/19 Cricket World Cup]].

Other activities include cultural activities, leadership programs, community service programs and excellence programs with the co-operation of the Student Advisory and Development Unit, the Sports Unit, the Arts and Cultural Development Unit, Hostel Management. Activities are realised through societies, clubs, sports and cultural activities, motivation workshops and debate competitions. Among others, USM has a jazz orchestra called the USM Jazz Band that is composed of student musicians from various schools in the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=USM Jazz Band|title=A Jazzy Mélange|date=2016|publisher=Pearl Island Brainchild|location=Penang|isbn=978-967-10607-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ranking ==
The university was ranked 111th in the [http://registry.usm.my/portalreg/top200.pdf World University Rankings 2004]&lt;ref&gt;World University Rankings 2004&lt;/ref&gt; published by the ''[[Times Higher Education Supplement]]''. However, it dropped out of the list of top 200 universities in the world in 2005.

USM's then vice-chancellor Prof Tan Sri Dato' Dzulkifli Abdul Razak said that the addition of new criteria such as the employer survey could have contributed to the sharp drop in the university's integrity: "Our poor standing could also be attributed to the fact that we are a relatively young university compared to UM which is 100 years old. They have built up a stable reputation in that time." Prof. Dzulkifli also cited the poor staff-student ratio in Malaysian universities: "Over the past years we have doubled our intake. USM now has 35,000 students including 28,000 undergraduates but the number of lecturers, about 1,400 has not increased in tandem." {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

On 3 September 2008, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) was declared the Apex (Accelerated Programme for Excellence) University by the Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia. In 2010, USM achieved the position of 123 under the category of Life Sciences and Biomedicine (''Times Higher Education'' QS World University Rankings).

For the 2010 [[QS World University Rankings|QS Asian University rankings]], USM was at 69th&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/asian-university-rankings/2010|title=QS University Rankings: Asia|work=Top Universities|accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; place.
