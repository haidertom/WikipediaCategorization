      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3760">An '''agency shop''' is a form of [[union security agreement]] where the employer may hire [[trade union|union]] or non-union workers, and employees need not join the union in order to remain employed.&lt;ref name="Pynes"&gt;Pynes, Joan. ''Human Resources Management for Public and Nonprofit Organizations.'' 2d ed. Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley and Sons, 2004. {{ISBN|0-7879-7078-6}}{{page needed|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the non-union worker must pay a fee to cover collective bargaining costs.&lt;ref name="Pynes" /&gt; The fee paid by non-union members under the agency shop is known as the "agency fee".&lt;ref name="Guerin"&gt;Guerin, Lisa and DelPo, Amy. ''The Manager's Legal Handbook.'' Rev. 4th ed. Berkeley, Calif.: Nolo, 2007. {{ISBN|1-4133-0718-3}}{{page needed|date=November 2011}}; {{cite journal |last1=Mc Closkey |first1=Margie Ransom |last2=Rubin |first2=Richard S. |title=Union Security in the Public Sector: Types, Problems, Trends |journal=[[The Journal of Collective Negotiations]] |volume=6 |issue=4 |year=1977 |pages=1 |doi=10.2190/UJAU-1DJJ-0H1C-NBRJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mauer"&gt;Mauer, Michael.

Annapolis, Md.: Union Communication Services, Inc., 2001. {{ISBN|0-9659486-1-7}}{{page needed|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the agency shop is illegal, as is common in labor law governing [[United States|American]] [[public sector]] unions, a "fair share provision" may be agreed to by the union and the employer.&lt;ref name="Guerin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mauer" /&gt; The provision requires non-union employees to pay a "fair share fee" to cover the costs of the union's collective bargaining activities. The "fair share" is similar to the agency shop, but usually more restrictive as to what may be charged to the non-member.{{clarify|date=November 2013|reason=If this is the only difference, it needs to be specified.}}&lt;ref name="Guerin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mauer" /&gt; In Canada, the agency fee is usually known as the [[Rand formula]].&lt;ref&gt;McMenemy, John. ''The Language of Canadian Politics: A Guide to Important Terms and Concepts.'' Rev. ed. Waterloo, Ontario, Canada: Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1995. {{ISBN|0-88920-230-3}}{{page needed|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, compelling payment of agency fees from non-union employees in the public sector was held unconstitutional in [[Janus v. AFSCME]], in June 2018. 

[[International Labour Organization]] covenants do not address the legality of agency fee provisions, leaving the question up to each individual nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/pdconv.pl?host=status01&amp;textbase=iloeng&amp;document=1905&amp;chapter=3&amp;query=(Denmark)+%40ref&amp;highlight=&amp;querytype=bool&amp;context=0 "Case(s) No(s). 188, Report No. 34 (Denmark): Complaints against the Government of Denmark presented by Swiss Printing Workers' Union and the Swiss Federation of National Christian Trade Unions".] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604190504/http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/pdconv.pl?host=status01&amp;textbase=iloeng&amp;document=1905&amp;chapter=3&amp;query=(Denmark)+@ref&amp;highlight=&amp;querytype=bool&amp;context=0 |date=2011-06-04 }} Document No. 031960034188. Cases of the Committee on Freedom of Association. International Labor Organization. March 4, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; The legal status of agency shop agreements varies widely from country to country, ranging from bans on the agreement to extensive regulation of the agreement to not mentioning it at all.

'''ARCAP''' (Autoreview Car Assessment Program) is an automobile safety assessment program founded by the Russian [[automobile magazine|car magazine]] [[Autoreview]]. It was Russia's first independent rating for the [[passive safety]] of a car, presenting itself as the local edition of the [[Euro NCAP]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All You Need to Know About Crash Tests - Motorward|url=http://www.motorward.com/2014/03/need-know-crash-tests/|accessdate=28 May 2017|work=Motorward.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202014614/http://www.motorward.com/2014/03/need-know-crash-tests/|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also provides exclusive test results on some models not marketed in Europe or North America, such as [[AvtoVAZ]] vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Две звезды и меньше. Самые скандальные краш-тесты|url=https://auto.mail.ru/article/39656-dve_zvezdy_i_menshe_samye_skandalnye_krash-testy/|accessdate=28 May 2017|work=Авто Mail.Ru|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408035851/https://auto.mail.ru/article/39656-dve_zvezdy_i_menshe_samye_skandalnye_krash-testy/|archivedate=8 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since 1996, Autoreview has been conducting the independent crash tests for cars sold in the Russian market.&lt;ref name="orei"&gt;{{cite news|title=О рейтинге|url=https://autoreview.ru/arcap/about|accessdate=28 May 2017|work=Авторевю|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211105510/https://autoreview.ru/arcap/about|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early tests did not comply with international car safety testing methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Опасный патриотизм: итоги краш-теста УАЗ Патриот|url=http://ulgrad.ru/?p=153589|accessdate=28 May 2017|work=Город Ульяновск - новости и всё о городе|language=ru-ru|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170617090203/http://ulgrad.ru/?p=153589|archivedate=17 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the first test was carried out according to the rules of [[EuroNCAP]], though only for frontal impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Опции из группы риска|url=http://auto.mail.ru/article.html?id=36768|accessdate=28 May 2017|work=Авто Mail.Ru|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203003944/http://auto.mail.ru/article.html?id=36768|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first the score could deviate from testing norms: in 2002 the [[VAZ-2110]], which would have scored only 0.7 points out of 16 by normal testing criteria, was awarded an additional four points to set it apart from the even less safe [[Izh Oda]] and [[VAZ-2106]].&lt;ref name="orei"/&gt; For similar reasons it was decided to distinguish between cars with low levels of safety, and cars that in addition to being unsafe were structurally unsound.&lt;ref name="orei"/&gt;

In 2017, ARCAP agreed to perform a second crash test on the new [[UAZ Patriot]], after the manufacturer had complained about its methodology following a disappointing rating. The second test ultimately assigned the car a similarly low rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=«Авторевю» рассказало о результатах второго краш-теста обновленного UAZ Patriot|url=http://news.drom.ru/UAZ-Patriot-50255.html|accessdate=28 May 2017|work=Drom.ru|language=ru|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205170856/http://news.drom.ru/UAZ-Patriot-50255.html|archivedate=5 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology and ratings==
According to the results of crash tests (frontal impact of a deformable barrier at 64&amp;nbsp;km/h with a 40% offset),&lt;ref name="autworld"/&gt; the car is rated on a scale (0 to 16) following the protocol for the EuroNCAP frontal impact. The score is converted into a star rating, from zero to four stars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Две звезды и меньше. Самые скандальные краш-тесты|url=https://auto.mail.ru/article/39656-dve_zvezdy_i_menshe_samye_skandalnye_krash-testy/|accessdate=28 May 2017|work=Авто Mail.Ru|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408035851/https://auto.mail.ru/article/39656-dve_zvezdy_i_menshe_samye_skandalnye_krash-testy/|archivedate=8 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that does not coincide with an EuroNCAP rating. By December 2010, over 20 models were assigned a zero-star rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alvarez|first1=Fernando|title=Test de choque en Rusia: los Lada Laika y el Niva matan a todos los dummies|url=http://www.highmotor.com/test-choque-rusia-lada-laika-niva-matan-dummies.html|accessdate=28 May 2017|work=Highmotor|date=25 December 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102082546/http://www.highmotor.com/test-choque-rusia-lada-laika-niva-matan-dummies.html|archivedate=2 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to a lack of sufficient funds,&lt;ref name="orei"/&gt; Euro NCAP standards are applied only in part, as only passive safety is tested, and only for the frontal part of the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Легче предотвратить аварию, чем разбираться с последствиями|url=http://autorc.ru/news/legche-predotvratit-avariyu-chem-razbiratsya-s-posledstviyami.html|accessdate=28 May 2017|publisher=Центр испытаний "НАМИ"|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006085838/http://autorc.ru/news/legche-predotvratit-avariyu-chem-razbiratsya-s-posledstviyami.html|archivedate=6 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; No side crash tests are carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lada Vesta Achieves The Maximum 4 Stars At Russian Crash Test|url=http://www.ultimatecarblog.com/lada-vesta-achieves-maximum-4-stars-russian-crash-test/|accessdate=28 May 2017|work=Ultimate Car Blog|date=5 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108173420/http://www.ultimatecarblog.com/lada-vesta-achieves-maximum-4-stars-russian-crash-test/|archivedate=8 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active electronic components such as [[anti-lock braking system]]s or [[electronic stability program]]s are not considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Лучников|first1=Антон|title=Почему ответ АвтоВАЗа Кашину не повод для гордости|url=https://tjournal.ru/10016-pochemu-otvet-avtovaza-kashinu-ne-povod-dlya-gordosti|accessdate=28 May 2017|date=21 July 2015|language=ru|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006085837/https://tjournal.ru/10016-pochemu-otvet-avtovaza-kashinu-ne-povod-dlya-gordosti|archivedate=6 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ratings include symbols for the driver, passenger and car. The car symbol is crossed out in the test result if the impact seriously compromised the structural integrity of the vehicle body. The symbols of the driver and passengers are crossed out where vehicle occupants may be at increased risk of injury to vital organs.&lt;ref name="orei"/&gt;

==Test facilities==
Tests are conducted in the [[Dmitrovsky District, Moscow Oblast|Dmitrovsky District]] test grounds of the [[Central Scientific Research Automobile and Automotive Engines Institute|NAMI]] research institute,&lt;ref name="autworld"&gt;{{cite news|title=LADA Vesta gets maximum score in ARCAP crash test conducted by Autoreview|url=http://www.automotiveworld.com/news-releases/lada-vesta-gets-maximum-score-arcap-crash-test-conducted-autoreview/|accessdate=28 May 2017|publisher=Automotive World|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006085838/https://www.automotiveworld.com/news-releases/lada-vesta-gets-maximum-score-arcap-crash-test-conducted-autoreview/|archivedate=6 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Laboratory Impact Testing of [[AvtoVAZ]]. The Dmitrovsky test grounds near [[Moscow]] and AvtoVAZ are the only facilities in Russia to provide access to acceleration catapults and modern [[Hybrid III]] dummies, with the equipment required for their calibration.&lt;ref name="orei"/&gt; Outside of Russia, ARCAP uses test grounds of the [[TÜV SÜD]] subsidiary in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name="protocol"&gt;{{cite news|title=Что такое краш-тест Авторевю — Авторевю|url=https://autoreview.ru/arcap/protocol|accessdate=28 May 2017|work=Autoreview.ru|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211105239/https://autoreview.ru/arcap/protocol|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Biohazard symbol (black and yellow).png|alt=A black symbol on a yellow background|thumb|The biohazard symbol]]'''Biological hazards''', also known as '''biohazards''', refer to [[biological]] substances that pose a threat to the health of [[living organisms]], primarily that of humans. This can include samples of a [[microorganism]], [[virus]] or [[toxin]] (from a biological source) that can affect human [[health]]. It can also include substances harmful to other animals.
[[File:Biohazard Symbol Specification.png|thumb|alt=The Biohazard Symbol with dimensions as defined in https://archive.org/stream/federalregister39kunit#page/n849/mode/1up]]

The term and [[Hazard symbol#Biohazard sign|its associated symbol]] are generally used as a warning, so that those potentially exposed to the substances will know to take precautions.  The biohazard symbol was developed in 1966 by Charles Baldwin, an environmental-health engineer working for the [[Dow Chemical Company]] on the containment products.&lt;ref name="waterloo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/BiosafetyResources/History-of-Biohazard-Symbol.htm |title=Biohazard Symbol History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213165520/http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/biosafetyresources/history-of-biohazard-symbol.htm |archivedate=February 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used in the labeling of biological materials that carry a significant health risk, including viral samples and used [[hypodermic needles]].

In [[Unicode]], the [[biohazard symbol]] is U+2623 (&lt;span style="font-size: larger;"&gt;☣&lt;/span&gt;).

The United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) categorizes various diseases in levels of biohazard, Level 1 being minimum risk and Level 4 being extreme risk.  Laboratories and other facilities are categorized as BSL ([[Biosafety Level]]) 1–4 or as ''P1'' through ''P4'' for short (Pathogen or Protection Level).

* '''Biohazard Level 1:''' Bacteria and viruses including ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'', [[Canidae|canine]] [[hepatitis]], ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', and [[varicella]] ([[chicken pox]]), as well as some cell cultures and non-infectious bacteria. At this level precautions against the biohazardous materials in question are minimal, most likely involving gloves and some sort of facial protection.
* '''Biohazard Level 2:''' Bacteria and viruses that cause only mild disease to humans, or are difficult to contract via [[aerosol]] in a lab setting, such as hepatitis [[hepatitis A|A]], [[hepatitis B|B]], and [[hepatitis C|C]], some [[influenza A]] strains, [[Lyme disease]], [[salmonella]], [[mumps]], [[measles]], [[scrapie]], [[dengue fever]], and [[Human immunodeficiency virus|HIV]]. Routine diagnostic work with clinical specimens can be done safely at Biosafety Level 2, using Biosafety Level 2 practices and procedures. Research work (including co-cultivation, virus replication studies, or manipulations involving concentrated virus) can be done in a BSL-2 (P2) '''facility''', using BSL-3 practices and procedures.
* '''Biohazard Level 3:''' Bacteria and viruses that can cause severe to fatal disease in humans, but for which vaccines or other treatments exist, such as [[Anthrax disease|anthrax]], [[West Nile virus]], [[Venezuelan equine encephalitis]], [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome|SARS virus]], [[Middle East respiratory syndrome|MERS coronavirus]], [[hantaviruses]], [[tuberculosis]], [[typhus]], [[Rift Valley fever]], [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]], [[yellow fever]], and [[malaria]]. 
* '''Biohazard Level 4:''' Viruses that cause severe to fatal disease in humans, and for which vaccines or other treatments are ''not'' available, such as [[Bolivian hemorrhagic fever]], [[Marburg virus]], [[Ebola virus]], [[Lassa fever virus]], [[Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever]], and other [[viral hemorrhagic fever|hemorrhagic]] diseases and rishibola.  [[Variola virus]] ([[smallpox]]) is an agent that is worked with at BSL-4 despite the existence of a vaccine, as it has been eradicated.  When dealing with biological hazards at this level the use of a [[positive pressure personnel suit]], with a segregated air supply, is mandatory. The entrance and exit of a Level Four biolab will contain multiple showers, a vacuum room, an [[ultraviolet]] light room, [[Autonomous Detection System|autonomous detection system]], and other safety precautions designed to destroy all traces of the biohazard. Multiple airlocks are employed and are electronically secured to prevent both doors opening at the same time. All air and water service going to and coming from a [[Biosafety level#Levels|Biosafety Level 4]] (P4) lab will undergo similar decontamination procedures to eliminate the possibility of an accidental release. Currently there are no bacteria classified at this level.

==Symbol==
{{Duplication|section=yes|dupe=Hazard symbol#Biohazard sign}}
The [[Hazard symbol#Biohazard sign|biohazard symbol]] was developed by the [[Dow Chemical Company]] in 1966 for their containment products.&lt;ref name="waterloo"/&gt; According to Charles Baldwin,&lt;ref name="waterloo"/&gt; an environmental-health engineer who contributed to its development: "We wanted something that was memorable but meaningless, so we could educate people as to what it means." In an article he wrote for ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iconglobe.net/blog/2011/01/07/biohazard-symbol-history/{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; the symbol was presented as the new standard for all biological hazards ("biohazards"). The article explained that over 40 symbols were drawn up by Dow artists, and all of the symbols investigated had to meet a number of criteria:
# Striking in form in order to draw immediate attention;
# Unique and unambiguous, in order not to be confused with symbols used for other purposes;
# Quickly recognizable and easily recalled;
# Symmetrical, in order to appear identical from all angles of approach;
# Acceptable to groups of varying ethnic backgrounds.
The chosen symbol scored the best on nationwide testing for memorability.&lt;ref name=BiohazardScience&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baldwin|first=CL|author2=Runkle, RS|title=Biohazards symbol: development of a biological hazards warning signal|journal=Science|date=Oct 13, 1967|volume=158|issue=798|pages=264–5|doi=10.1126/science.158.3798.264|url=http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/BiosafetyResources/1967-10-13-Science-paper-Biohazard-Symbol.pdf|accessdate=29 August 2011|pmid=6053882|bibcode=1967Sci...158..264B|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928072239/http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/BiosafetyResources/1967-10-13-Science-paper-Biohazard-Symbol.pdf|archivedate=28 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design was first specified in [https://archive.org/stream/federalregister39kunit#page/n849/mode/1up 39 FR 23680] but was dropped in the succeeding amendment. However, various US states adopted the specification for their state code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lni.wa.gov/wisha/rules/corerules/html/296-800-110.htm WAC 296-800-11045] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210222735/http://www.lni.wa.gov/wisha/rules/corerules/html/296-800-110.htm |date=February 10, 2012 }}, see PDF for a high resolution graphic&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four circles within the symbol, signifying the chain of infection.
# Agent: The type of microorganism, that causes infection or hazardous condition.
# Host: The organism in which the microorganism Infect. The new host must be susceptible.
# Source: The host from which the microorganism originate. The carrier host might not show symptoms.
# Transmission: The means of transmission, mostly direct or indirect. Some routes of transmission include air, insect, direct contact and contaminated surfaces.

'''Clark L. Wilson''' (August 31, 1913 – August 12, 2006 in [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]], [[Virginia]]) was an American industrial psychologist who introduced the concept of 360 feedback surveys for management training and development applications. From 1970-1973 he developed his first [[360-degree feedback]] survey, the "Survey of Management Practices". It was based on a learning sequence he called the Task-Cycle-Theory. Today, 360 feedback surveys of many types are standard tools for management training and development worldwide.

==Background==
Wilson studied under psychologist [[J.P. Guilford]] as a University of Southern California graduate student after World War II. Guilford had expanded on the work by [[Louis Leon Thurstone]], pioneer in the field of psychometrics, by using factor analysis to assess management skills. Guilford’s work led Wilson to experiment with identifying important management and leadership skills through psychometrics. He eventually developed his Task Cycle assessment tools as an application of Guilford’s statistical approach.

Wilson borrowed the concept of multi-rater feedback from the field of psychological assessment, particularly as it was being applied by the [[US Army]] during World War II. Managers and leaders, he believed, could learn and improve if they knew how others perceived their skills and behaviors. He also believed that management skills can be learned, like any other skill, through a learning sequence. While Wilson started out calling this system multi-level feedback, others eventually dubbed it 360-degree feedback—the name by which it is now best known. It is also sometimes called multi-rater feedback.

===Early Developments===
He developed the Survey of Management Practices as a teaching tool for his management classes at the University of Bridgeport (Connecticut) Graduate School of Business, where he was the Warner G. Bradford Proofessor of Management. He had students use the survey in their workplaces.

The feedback consisted of survey statements which were rated on a seven-point agree/disagree scale. The statements were strictly limited to observations about behaviors such as planning or communications, avoiding aspects of [[Personality psychology|personality]] such as sociability or excitability. Each individual would rate him or herself on the same survey as the supervisor, direct reports, and peers who were also providing ratings.

By the mid-1970s more companies, including [[Dow Chemical]], [[Pitney Bowes]] and several utilities were using the instrument and contributing data to the norm database. With wider use and accumulated data, Wilson was able to study the reliability and validity of the instrument. He also studied performance data on feedback recipients and was able to verify a mathematical basis for the Task Cycle learning sequence. He found that when a manager or executive practiced the Task Cycle skills with balance and in sequence, a measurable increase in effectiveness could be documented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.performanceprograms.com/Surveys/FAQWilsonHistory.shtm Performance Programs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516041957/http://www.performanceprograms.com/Surveys/FAQWilsonHistory.shtm |date=2008-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business===
The Clark Wilson Group, formed in 1973, merged with [http://www.boothco.com/ The Booth Company] in 2017. The Task Cycle® line of assessments now consists of ten off-the-shelf offerings, with dozens of customized versions in circulation.

===Research Conclusions===
Up to the time of his death, Wilson continued to develop and publish a full range of assessment tools. He published his last book in 2003 at the age of 89. ''How and Why Effective Managers Balance Their Skills'' offers conclusions based on 30 years of research. Wilson summarizes: "After over 30 years of analysis, the problem of most managers is very clear. Too many managers try to exercise control without providing the technical and teambuilding skills needed to achieve their goals". This imbalance derails individuals and undermines organizational performance, he asserted, while the presence of these skills—which can be learned—measurably improves business outcomes.

===Academic and Professional===
Clark Wilson received his A.B. from [[Stanford University]] in 1935. He joined the U.S. Navy in World War II and served in the submarine force in the Pacific theater and was awarded the [[Silver Star]] and [[Gold Star]]. He earned a Ph.D. in applied psychology from the [[University of Southern California]] in 1948. He was a Fellow of the [[American Psychological Association]] and a Fellow of the [[Society of Industrial and Organizational Psychologists]].

Dr. Wilson died in August, 2006.

[[File:Pope John XXIII - Time Magazine Cover - January 4, 1963.jpg|thumb|[[Time (magazine)|Time]] cover from 1963. Copyright was not renewed, so the collective work is in the public domain. The artist, [[Bernard Safran]] (1924–95), created 73 covers for Time.{{sfn|Bernard Safran: Paintings – safran-arts}}]]
A '''collective work''' is a work that contains the works of several authors assembled and published under the direction of one natural or legal person who owns the [[copyright]] in the work as a whole. 
Definitions vary considerably from one country to another, but usually treat ownership of the work as a whole as distinct from ownership of the individual contributions, so the individual authors may retain the right to publish their work elsewhere.
It is common for publication of articles on the Internet, when isolated from the context of the overall work, to be considered to be outside of the standard agreement between the author and the owner of the collective work.

==General==

===International agreements===

Many countries have agreed to be bound by the terms of the [[Berne Convention]] and/or the [[TRIPS Agreement]].

Article 2.5 of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (Paris Text 1971) specifies: "Collections of literary or artistic works such as encyclopaedias and anthologies which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations shall be protected as such, without prejudice to the copyright in each of the works forming part of such collections."{{sfn|Berne Convention ... 1971}}

Section 10.2 of the TRIPS Agreement, to which members of the [[World Trade Organization]] are bound, states, "Compilations of data or other material, whether in machine readable or other form, which by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents constitute intellectual creations shall be protected as such. Such protection, which shall not extend to the data or material itself, shall be without prejudice to any copyright subsisting in the data or material itself."{{sfn|Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights – WTO}}

===Limitation on publisher rights===

In general, the author of a contribution to a collective work retains the copyright, and the publisher does not have the right to reuse the contribution in some context other than the collective work without the express consent of the author. 
In England it has been held that exploiting the work of a freelance newspaper photographer in a back numbers website was a use that had not been contemplated in the original license and was not covered by the license.
Such reuse would also infringe the journalist's copyright in the United States.
In a 1997 case in the Netherlands it was held that reuse of newspaper articles on a website and CD-ROM went beyond the implied license.
In Germany any attempt by the author to grant rights to exploit their work in a way that was unknown when the contract was made is null and void under the law.
In France, online publication is considered fundamentally different from print publication.{{sfn|Stokes|2014|p=138}}

===Creative Commons===

The Creative Commons legal code for Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0 (CC2.0) defines a collective work as:
{{quote|"'''Collective Work'''" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.{{sfn|Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0 – Creative Commons}} }}
The license for a CC2.0 work allows the user to incorporate the CC2.0 work in a collective work in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The collective work does not have to be released under a Creative Commons license, but access to the incorporated CC2.0 work must be consistent with the CC2.0 license, and the author must be credited.{{sfn|Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0 – Creative Commons}}

==Common law countries==

The British [[Statute of Anne]] (1710) was the first copyright law in the world.{{sfn|Tallmo|2014}}
The statute is considered a "watershed event in Anglo-American copyright history ... transforming what had been the publishers' private law copyright into a public law grant".{{sfn|Patterson|Joyce|2003|p=916}}  
Under the statute, copyright was for the first time vested in authors rather than publishers; it also included provisions for the public interest, such as a [[legal deposit]] scheme. The Statute was an influence on copyright law in several other nations, including the [[United States]], and even in the 21st century is "frequently invoked by modern judges and academics as embodying the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] underpinnings of copyright law".{{sfn|Alexander|2010|p=17}}

===Australia===

In Australia a collective work is a work composed of separate parts that each attract their own copyright.
An example would be a song in which the author of the music and the author of the lyrics each have copyright in their contribution.{{sfn|Caenegem|2010|p=36}}
The authors have a moral right to be attributed, but only if they are author of a substantial part and it is reasonable to identify the author.{{sfn|Sainsbury|2003|p=50}}
It may be unreasonable to attribute each author in a collective work such as an encyclopedia.{{sfn|Sainsbury|2003|p=51}}

===Canada===

Under Canadian copyright law, a collective work means{{sfn|Copyright Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-42)|pp=2–3}} 
:(a) an encyclopaedia, dictionary, year book or similar work,
:(b) a newspaper, review, magazine or similar periodical, and
:(c) any work written in distinct parts by different authors, or in which works or parts of works of different authors are incorporated; 

When the author of a work is the first owner of copyright, any rights granted by the author revert to his estate.
However, this does not apply to the assignment of the copyright in a collective work or a licence to publish a work or part of a work as
part of a collective work.{{sfn|Copyright Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-42)|loc=14 (1)}}

''[[Robertson v Thomson Corp]]'', {{lexum-scc3|2006|43|2 |363}} is a 2006 [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision on the ownership of copyright in published text that are stored in databases.  The ruling held that though a newspaper held the copyright in the collection and the arrangement of freelance articles and in its newspaper, it could not publish the articles within a database.  Publication within the database would remove the articles from the context of the collective work and therefore their publication as such was not within the rights held by the newspaper.{{sfn|Robertson v. Thomson Corp., [2006]}}
Robertson decided that freelance journalists' copyright can stop the republication of their articles onto databases which display one article at a time but not onto CD-ROMs featuring whole newspapers. The court decided that a CD-ROM in which individual articles may only be viewed in the context of a whole newspaper is not a republication of an individual article as an individual work, but is rather a reproduction of the newspaper as a whole as a work.

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom section 178 of the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] (CDPA) defines a collective work as either “(a) a work of joint authorship or (b) a work in which there are distinct contributions by different authors or in which works or parts of works of different authors are incorporated.”{{sfn|Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 UK|loc=s.178}}
The general principle is that authors who contribute to a collective work have the right to control future exploitation in their works unless this is expressly waived in the contract.{{sfn|D'Agostino|2010|p=262}}
The editor receives a separate copyright in the collective work for their efforts as long as they meet the originality standard set by the government.{{sfn|Goldstein|Hugenholtz|2012|pp=254}}
The copyright law related to collective works does not provide an exception to the general European term of protection of 70 years following death, which would apply to death of the last surviving author.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=8}}

The [[Copyright Act 1842]] stated that the authors of contributions to collective works did not retain full copyright control over their works. However, they had the right to be paid, the right to refuse consent for additional uses of their work, reversion of copyright after 28 years and (if agreed with the owner of the collective work) the ability to publish their own work.{{sfn|D'Agostino|2010|p=262}}
The 1911 Act, which replaced the 1842 Act, stated that the owner of a collective work would only gain ownership of the copyright of contributions where they had given or promised some valuable consideration and there was no agreement to the contrary.
The author would retain copyright if this could be inferred from the mutual intention of the parties.{{sfn|D'Agostino|2010|p=262}}
Under the [[Copyright Act 1911]], no copyright vests in the proprietor of a collective work unless the author is employed under a contract of service or apprenticeship, or there is an assignment in writing; and when the copyright vests in the proprietor of a periodical by reason of a contract of service or apprenticeship, the author may restrain separate publication.{{sfn|Macgillivray|1912}}

With the 1911 Act the author of a contribution would regain copyright after 25 years, but this would be concurrent with the publisher's right in the collective work. 
It was argued that reversion of full rights to the author would have been "a great hardship to proprietors of collective works, particularly of those permanent in nature, such as ecyclopaedias, if they could not have acquired from the author an unfettered right to produce the work at any future time as part of the collective work."
The author could, however, restrain the publisher from transferring or licensing their work to others.{{sfn|D'Agostino|2010|p=60}}
Under the [[Copyright Act 1956]] employees retained copyright in their work unless there was an agreement to the contrary.{{sfn|D'Agostino|2010|p=262}}
The  CDPA removed the waiver on employee rights.{{sfn|D'Agostino|2010|p=262}}

===United States===

{{main|Collective work (US)}}

In the [[Copyright law of the United States]], the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], section 101, defines a collective work as "a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology, or encyclopedia, in which a number of contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole". 
It is protected as long as the "author" can show that the selection and organization of the contributions is original, and that these contribution can themselves be protected, as opposed to being mere facts such as statistical data.{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}

Article 201 (c) states, "Copyright in each separate contribution to a collective work is distinct from copyright in the collective work as a whole, and vests initially in the author of the contribution. In the absence of an express transfer of the copyright or of any rights under it, the owner of copyright in the collective work is presumed to have acquired only the privilege of reproducing and distributing the contribution as part of that particular collective work, any revision of that collective work, and any later collective work in the same series".{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}
The compiler, or author of the collection, owns copyright in the expression he or she contributed, which is primarily the selection and arrangement of the separate contributions, but may include such things as a preface, advertisements, etc., that the collective author created.{{sfn|Barrett|2012|loc=PT449}}
The contributions remain the property of the authors by default, but the property may be passed to the owner of the collective work by contract.
They may also obtain ownership of the contributions if they are [[Work for hire|works made for hire]].{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}

The Supreme Court case of ''[[New York Times Co. v. Tasini]]'' (2001) concerned free-lance journalists who had been paid for their contributions to paper editions of newspapers and magazines, but their contracts had not covered digital rights for reproduction on CD-ROMs or publication on the Internet.
When the articles were distributed in electronic form a few years later, the court ruled that this did not constitute a revision of the work, because the articles could be accessed individually.
A revision must maintain the articles in their context of origin.{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}
In ''Faulkner v. National Geographic Enterprises Inc.'' (2005), a Court of Appeal ruled that an electronic version of a newspaper was a revision of the collective work if it reproduced the paper version identically, including advertisements and photographs.{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}

==European countries==

"The New Renaissance", the report of the ''Comité des Sages'' Reflection Group on Bringing Europe’s Cultural Heritage Online, published on 10 January 2011, stated that the public sector had a duty to digitize their cultural heritage. Under the heading of "Ensuring wide access to and use of digitised public domain material" the report stated:{{sfn|European Union|Comité des Sages|2011}}
{{blockquote|
* Cultural institutions should make public domain material digitised with public funding as widely available as possible for access and re-use. This cross-border access should be part of the funding conditions for digitisation across Europe. The use of intrusive watermarks or other means that limit the use of the material should be avoided.{{sfn|European Union|Comité des Sages|2011}}
* The European Commission should consider ways and means to eliminate the differences in the rights status of digitised material between the Member States in a context where cross-border access and use is the norm. In principle the mere digitisation process should not generate any new rights.{{sfn|European Union|Comité des Sages|2011}}}}
The [[Copyright Term Directive]] of 2006 was intended to address the second concern, but has not been effective in harmonizing the terms and definitions.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=2}}
It does state that the term of protection for works whose right-holder is a legal person, as well as for collective works, is 70 years after the work is made available to the public.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=3}}
It also states that where "the natural persons who have created the [collective] work are identified as such in the versions of the works which are made available to the public" the duration of protection is 70 years after the death of the last surviving author.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=8}}
However, there is no standard European definition of the terms "works of joint authorship" and "collective works", so each country must define laws and make legal decisions over when a work with multiple authors is a work of joint authorship, collective work or simply a collection of separate works.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=4}}

=== Czech Republic===

In the Czech Republic a collective work is a work that is created with the participation of more than one authors at the initiative and under the management of a natural person or of a legal entity and made available to the public under that person’s or entity’s name and where the individual contributions involved in the work are not capable of independent use. The work is protected for 70 years after it was made publicly available.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}

===France===
{{main|Collective work (France)}}

The concept of a collective work (''œuvre collective'') in the [[copyright law of France]] is complex, and case law and scholarly views do not always agree.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}
Bernard Edelman, in his ''l’œuvre collective : une définition introuvable'' (1998), describes the legal definition of collective works as "obscure and tangled".{{sfn|Jacobacci Avocats|2014}}
However, all authorities agree that the concept of an ''oeuvre collective'' in France covers dictionaries, encyclopaedias and periodical works such as newspapers or magazines.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}

A "collective work" in France is a work created at the initiative of a natural or legal person who edits it, publishes it and discloses it under his direction and name and in which the personal contributions of the various authors who participated in its production are merged in the overall work for which they were conceived, without it being possible to attribute to each author a separate right in the work as created.
"A collective work shall be the property, unless proved otherwise, of the natural or legal person under whose name it has been disclosed.  The author’s rights shall vest in such person."{{sfn|Intellectual Property Code – Legifrance|p=2–3}}
"In the case of ... collective works, the term of the exclusive right shall be 70 years from January 1 of the calendar year following that in which the work was published."{{sfn|Intellectual Property Code – Legifrance|p=7}}

It does not matter whether the contributors are identified or remain anonymous.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}{{sfn|Bermann|Picard|2008|p=179}}
The ''maître'' takes all the ownership rights in a collective work, and these rights are directly vested in the ''maître'' rather than transferred from the contributors, as long as the ''maître'' directed the creative process enough for it to be considered a collective work.{{sfn|Sutherland Asbill &amp; Brennan LLP|2004|p=9}}
In a 22 March 2012 decision the [[Court of Cassation (France)|French Supreme Court]] (''Cour de cassation'') stated that "the natural or legal person at the initiative of a collective work is vested with the author's rights over this work and, in particular, the moral rights prerogatives".{{sfn|Bretonnière|2012}}
Each contributor to the collective work retains the moral rights to their contribution.{{sfn|Bouche|2011|p=86}}

The rise of the Internet has opened new questions about the rights of the authors of contributions to a collective work.{{sfn|France: Industrial Relations ... Press Reference}}
When a newspaper is reproduced in its entirety the reproduction falls under the collective work regime.
Publication in successive editions of a newspaper during the course of the day, each of which reproduces a large part of the previous edition, is not seen as publication in another newspaper.
Electronic publication of the entire newspaper could therefore be seen as an edition of the same collective work.
However, partial or selective reproduction may require the agreement of the contributors.
Further, the contributors to a newspaper may have the right to separately publish a thematic selection of articles without infringing the rights of the owner of the collective work.{{sfn|Ader|1997}}

===Germany===

The main relevant law in Germany is the Copyright Act of 9 September 1965, the ''Gesetz über Urheberrecht und verwandte Schutzrechte '' (UrhG).
German copyright law defines collective works as collections of works, data, or other independent elements, provided that the collection itself is a personal intellectual creation (UrhG, sec. 4 para 1), in other words: a work as defined by UrhG, sec. 2 para 2.
The authors grant the rights of exploitation to a third party who decides what works to include in the collection.
The difference from a work of joint authorship is that it is practical to separately exploit the parts of a collective work, while that cannot be done with parts of a work of joint authorship. 
It is possible to distinguish between the collection as a work and the parts as different works.{{sfn|Engelhardt|Jaeger}}

Since the authors retain copyright in their contributions, both the authors and the creator of the collective work must consent to its exploitation.
The creator and the authors of the contributions may enforce their rights separately.{{sfn|Engelhardt|Jaeger}}
The copyright term of each contribution is measured from the death of the author of the contribution.{{sfn|Goldstein|Hugenholtz|2012|p=253}}
The collective work resembles a joint work in that the author of each contribution may require the consent to alteration or exploitation of all the contributors "if such consent may reasonably be demanded of them."{{sfn|Goldstein|Hugenholtz|2012|pp=253-254}}
Two years after granting an exploitation right to an editor, or after delivering the work to the editor, the author can revoke the grant if the work has not been published and the author has been harmed as a result.{{sfn|Goldstein|Hugenholtz|2012|p=269}}

===Hungary===

In Hungary a work shall be regarded as a collective work if the contributions of the authors co-operating in the creation of the work are combined in the product of joint creation in a manner which makes the separate determination of the individual authors' rights impossible.  In the case of a collective work ... the copyright shall be transferred by legal succession to the natural or legal person,   business company or legal entity at whose initiative and under whose instructions the work was created and who published it in his own name.{{sfn|Act No. LXXVI of 1999 on copyright – Hungary|loc=Art 6}}
The term of protection of a collective work shall be seventy years counted from the first day of the year following the first disclosure of the work.{{sfn|Act No. LXXVI of 1999 on copyright – Hungary|loc=Art 31}}

===Italy===

Article 3 of the Italian Copyright Law defines collective works as formed by “the assembling of works or parts of works possessing the character of a self-contained creation resulting from selection
and coordination with a specific literary, scientific, didactic, religious, political or artistic aim, such as encyclopaedias, dictionaries, anthologies, magazines and newspapers”. The collective work as a whole is protected for 70 years from publication. For magazines, newspapers and other periodical works, each individual part or issue is given an independent term.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}
The collective works shall be protected as original works, independently and without prejudice to the copyright on the works or parts of works of which they are composed."

Article 7 of the Copyright Law considers the author as the one who organizes and directs the creation of the work: "The author of a collective work is considered to be the person who organizes and directs its creation itself."
What characterizes the collective work is not so much the structural element as the creative coexistence of two levels: that of individual contributions that make up the work and the total ideation of the work and the choice and coordination of contributions or of organization and direction of creative activity carried out by employees.

The individual parts of the collective work are deemed creative works, so the rights to them are retained by their individual creators. This is stated in paragraph 2 of Article 38 of the Copyright Law stating: "The right to use their own contributions separately is reserved for the individual employees of the collective work, in compliance with the agreed terms, and failing that, the following standards."
Moreover, the Article 38 also provides that: "With a collective work, unless otherwise agreed, the right to economic use is with the publisher of the same" where "publisher" means the natural or legal person who assumes the economic risk and bear the costs imposed by the creation and publication of the work.

As part of these works we must therefore distinguish three distinct holders of rights: the author (who organizes and directs its creation), the publisher (who owns only the economic rights) and individual authors. 
Article 42 allows the use of a fragment from the collective work by the author provided it indicates the collective work from which it was taken, and the date of publication:
"The author of the article or other work that is reproduced in a collective work shall be entitled to reproduce it in separate publications or collected in a volume, provided that it indicates the collective work from which it is taken and the date of publication."

===Kosovo===

In Kosovo the copyright in the collective work lasts for seventy years after the lawful disclosure of the work, unless the natural persons who have created the work are identified as such in the versions of the work which are disclosed to the public. 
In case of identification of the authors, copyright will last for seventy years from the date of death of the last surviving author.{{sfn|Law No. 04/L-065 of 30 November 2011 – Kosovo|loc=Art 61}}
Property rights and other copyrights pertaining to a database or collective work created during employment are considered to have passed to the employer exclusively and without limitations, unless the contract provides otherwise,{{sfn|Law No. 04/L-065 of 30 November 2011 – Kosovo|loc=Art 128}} 

A collective copyright work is a work created by collaboration of several authors, by combining their contribution separately into a whole such as encyclopedias, lexicons, databases, computer programs, collections and similar works at the initiative and under the direction of a natural or legal person as the ordering party. 
It is considered that the authors transfer unlimited and exclusive rights to all the material and other copyright in the collective work, unless otherwise provided by contract. 
The principal of the collective copyright work has the right to publish and use the work in its own name, but every copy of the work must contain a list of authors participating in 
the creation of collective work.{{sfn|Law No. 04/L-065 of 30 November 2011 – Kosovo|loc=Art 106}}

===Netherlands===

Under Dutch copyright law Article 5 states that “if a literary, scientific or artistic work consists of separate works by two or more persons, the person under whose guidance and supervision the work as a whole has been made or, if there is no such person, the compiler of the various works, shall be deemed the author of the whole work, without prejudice to the copyright in each of the works separately”. This could apply to works such as anthologies or encyclopedias.
The term of protection is not specified, so by default the collective work may be assumed to be protected until 70 years after the death of the person deemed to be author of the whole work. If this person is a legal person, protection would be for 70 years after publication.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=8}}

===Norway===

In Norway a work is protected for 70 years following the year of death of the author. 
In a collective or joint work, this is counted from the death of the longest surviving author. 
For a motion picture, the following are considered authors: main director, scriptwriter, dialogue author, and composer of original musical score.{{sfn|Hannemyr|2009|p=2}}

===Spain===

Under the 1987 [[copyright law of Spain]] collections of other works, such as anthologies, and other elements or data that by the selection or arrangement of materials constitute intellectual creations, are considered protected works without prejudice to the rights of the authors of the original works.{{sfn|Juan Carlos I|1987|loc=Art. 12}}
A collective work is a work created by the initiative and under the coordination of a natural or legal person who edits and publishes it under their name and consists of the collection of contributions from different authors whose personal contributions are based on autonomous creation, and for whom it is not possible to attribute separately a right over the whole of the work. Unless otherwise agreed, the rights to the collective work belong to the person who publishes and disseminates it under their name.{{sfn|Juan Carlos I|1987|loc=Art. 9}}
The duration of rights over a collective work shall be sixty years from the date of its disclosure.{{sfn|Juan Carlos I|1987|loc=Art. 28}}
Article 28 of the 1996 revision to this law grants collective works protection for 70 years following  lawful disclosure of the work.{{sfn|Real Decreto Legislativo 1/1996 – Spain|loc=Art. 28}}

==Other countries==

===Algeria===

In Algeria a collective work is protected for 50 years from publication, 50 years from the time it was made accessible to the public if unpublished, or 50 years from the time it is realized that it has not been made available to the public within 50 years of creation.{{sfn|DZ001: Droits d'auteur, Ordonnance ... Algeria|loc=Art. 56}}

===China===

Chinese law is in some ways closer to that of common law countries than to European civil law. 
It follows the general principle that ownership is originally vested in the author, but makes an exception with collective works.
Article 11 of the Chinese copyright code states that when a legal entity or organization directs creation of a work and bears responsibility for the work, that entity is considered the author of
the work. All rights vest in the organizational author.{{sfn|Sutherland Asbill &amp; Brennan LLP|2004|p=11–12}}

===Philippines===

Under the [[copyright law of the Philippines]], a "collective work" is a work which has been created by two or more natural persons at the initiative and under the direction of another with the understanding that it will be disclosed by the latter under his own name and that contributing natural persons will not be identified.{{sfn|Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines - Part Four|loc=171.2}}
When an author contributes to a collective work, his right to have his contribution attributed to him is deemed waived unless he expressly reserves it.{{sfn|Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines - Part Four|loc=196}}

===Vanuatu===

In Vanuatu a "collective work" is a work created by 2 or more individuals at the initiative and under the direction of another person on the understanding that (a) the work will be disclosed by that other person under that person’s own name; and (b) the identity of the contributing individuals will not be indicated.{{sfn|Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 ... Vanuatu|p=3}}
The person who initiated and directed the creation of a collective work is the original owner of the economic rights.{{sfn|Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 ... Vanuatu|p=13}} 
A "work of joint authorship" is a work created by 2 or more authors and in which the contribution of each author is not separate from the contribution of the other author or the contributions of the other authors, but does not include a collective work.{{sfn|Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 ... Vanuatu|p=5}} 
For a collective work (other than an work of applied art) and an audiovisual work protection extends for 50 years on and after the date on which the work: was made; or first made available to the public; first published; whichever date is the latest.{{sfn|Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 ... Vanuatu|p=12}}

'''Cost accounting''' is the process of recording, classifying, analyzing, summarizing, and allocating costs associated with a process, and then developing various courses of action to control the costs. Its goal is to advise the [[management]] on how to optimize business practices and processes based on cost efficiency and capability. Cost accounting provides the detailed cost information that management needs to control current operations and plan for the future.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books ?id=G9msXSOdIa8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Cost+accounting&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=G30wUc1mwZzQBaiTgdgJ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Cost%20accounting&amp;f=false |title=Principles of Cost Accounting - Edward J. Vanderbeck - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since managers are making decisions only for their own organization, there is no need for the information to be comparable to similar information from other organizations. Instead, information must be relevant for a particular environment. Cost accounting information is commonly used in [[financial accounting]] information, but its primary function is for use by managers to facilitate making decisions.

==Origins==
All types of businesses, whether service, manufacturing or trading, require cost accounting to track their activities.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; Cost accounting has long been used to help managers understand the [[cost]]s of running a business. Modern cost accounting originated during the [[industrial revolution]], when the complexities of running a large scale business led to the development of systems for recording and tracking costs to help business owners and managers make decisions.

In the early industrial age, most of the costs incurred by a business were what modern accountants call "[[variable cost]]s" because they varied directly with the amount of production. Money was spent on labor, raw materials, power to run a factory, etc. in direct proportion to production. Managers could simply total the variable costs for a product and use this as a rough guide for decision-making processes.

Some costs tend to remain the same even during busy periods, unlike variable costs, which rise and fall with volume of work. Over time, these "[[fixed cost]]s" have become more important to managers. Examples of fixed costs include the depreciation of plant and equipment, and the cost of departments such as maintenance, tooling, production control, purchasing, quality control, storage and handling, plant supervision and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Performance management, Paper f5. Kapalan publishing UK. Pg 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early nineteenth century, these costs were of little importance to most businesses. However, with the growth of railroads, steel and large scale manufacturing, by the late nineteenth century these costs were often more important than the variable cost of a product, and allocating them to a broad range of products led to bad decision making. Managers must understand fixed costs in order to make decisions about products and pricing.

For example: A company produced railway coaches and had only one product. To make each coach, the company needed to purchase $60 of raw materials and components, and pay 6 laborers $40 each. Therefore, total variable cost for each coach was $300. Knowing that making a coach required spending $300, managers knew they couldn't sell below that price without losing money on each coach. Any price above $300 became a contribution to the fixed costs of the company. If the fixed costs were, say, $1000 per month for rent, insurance and owner's salary, the company could therefore sell 5 coaches per month for a total of $3000 (priced at $600 each), or 10 coaches for a total of $4500 (priced at $450 each), and make a profit of $500 in both cases.

== Cost accounting vs financial accounting==
{{see also|Financial accounting}}
*Financial accounting computes the current or accounting period status and results, in the form of Profit and Loss, Account, and Balance Sheet. Cost Accounting computes the cost of production/service in a rigorous manner and facilitates cost control and cost reduction.
*Financial accounting reports the results and position of business to  government, creditors, investors, and external parties. Cost Accounting is an internal reporting system for an organization’s own management for decision making.
*In financial accounting, cost classification is based on type of transactions, e.g. salaries, repairs, insurance, offices, travel, stores etc. In cost accounting, classification is based on functions, activities, products, process and on internal planning and control and information needs of the organization.
*Financial accounting aims at presenting ‘true and fair’ view of  transactions,  profit and loss for a period and Statement of financial position (Balance Sheet) on a given date.  It aims at computing ‘true and fair’ view of the cost of production/services offered by the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cost and Management Accounting. Intermediate|publisher=ICA|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cost accounting is analysis based and may combine objective and subjective assessment of the costs contributing to a standard result

== Types of cost accounting ==
The following are different cost accounting approaches:
* [[Standard cost accounting]]
* [[Activity-based costing]]
* [[Resource consumption accounting]]
* [[Throughput accounting]]
* [[Whole-life cost|Life Cycle Costing]]
* [[Environmental accounting]]
* [[Target costing]]

==Elements of cost accounting ==

** Salaries/payroll including wages, pensions, and paycheck deductions (e.g., NI and PAYE in the UK, FICA in the US)
** [[Occupancy]] (rent, mortgage, property taxes)
** Depreciation  (durable goods including machinery and office equipment)
** Other fixed expenses

These categories are flexible and sometimes overlapping. For example, in some companies, machine cost is segregated from overhead and reported as a separate element altogether, and payroll costs are sometimes separated form other production costs.

==Classification of costs==
Classification of cost means, the grouping of costs according to their common characteristics. The important ways of classification of costs are:
# By Nature or Traceability: Direct Costs and [[Indirect costs]]. Direct Costs are Directly attributable/traceable to [[Cost object]]. Direct costs are assigned to Cost Object.  Indirect Costs are not directly attributable/traceable to Cost Object. Indirect costs are allocated or apportioned to cost objects.
# By Functions: production,administration, selling and distribution, R&amp;D.
# By Behavior: fixed, variable, semi-variable. Costs are classified according to their behavior in relation to change in relation to production volume within given period of time. Fixed Costs remain fixed irrespective of changes in the production volume in given period of time. Variable costs change according to volume of production. Semi-variable costs are partly fixed and partly variable.
# By control ability: controllable, uncontrollable costs. Controllable costs are those which can be controlled or influenced by a conscious management action. Uncontrollable costs cannot be controlled or influenced by a conscious management action.
# By normality: normal costs and  abnormal costs. Normal costs arise during routine day-to-day business operations. Abnormal costs arise because of any abnormal activity or event not part of routine business operations. E.g. costs arising of floods, riots, accidents etc.
# By Time: [[Historical costs]] and predetermined costs. Historical costs are costs incurred in the past. Predetermined costs are computed in advance on basis of factors affecting cost elements. Example: Standard Costs.
# By Decision making Costs: These costs are used for managerial decision making.And these are :- 
*[[Marginal costs]]: Marginal cost is the change in the aggregate costs due to change in the volume of output by one unit.
*Differential costs: This cost is the difference in total cost that will arise from the selection of one alternative to the other.
*Opportunity costs: It is the value of benefit sacrificed in favor of an alternative course of action.
*Relevant cost: The relevant cost is a cost which is relevant in various decisions of management.
*Replacement cost: This cost is the cost at which existing items of material or fixed assets can be replaced. Thus this is the cost of replacing existing assets at present or at a future date.
*Shutdown cost:These costs are the costs which are incurred if the operations are shut down and they will disappear if the operations are continued.
*Capacity cost: These costs are normally fixed costs. The cost incurred by a company for providing production, administration and selling and distribution capabilities in order to perform various functions.
*Sunken cost: cost already incurred
* Other costs

==Standard cost accounting==
{{Cleanup|section|reason=quality|date=July 2018}}
{{main|Standard cost accounting}}
In modern cost account of recording historical costs was taken further, by allocating the company's fixed costs over a given period of time to the items produced during that period, and recording the result as the total cost of production. This allowed the ''full cost'' of products that were not sold in the period they were produced to be recorded in inventory using a variety of complex accounting methods, which was consistent with the principles of [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles|GAAP]] (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles). It also essentially enabled managers to ignore the fixed costs, and look at the results of each period in relation to the "standard cost" for any given product.

:For example: if the railway coach company normally produced 40 coaches per month, and the fixed costs were still $1000/month, then each coach could be said to incur an Operating Cost/overhead of $25 =($1000 / 40). Adding this to the variable costs of $300 per coach produced a full cost of $325 per coach.

This method tended to slightly distort the resulting unit cost, but in mass-production industries that made one product line, and where the fixed costs were relatively low, the distortion was very minor.

:For example: if the railway coach company made 100 coaches one month, then the unit cost would become $310 per coach ($300 + ($1000 / 100)). If the next month the company made 50 coaches, then the unit cost = $320 per coach ($300 + ($1000 / 50)), a relatively minor difference.

An important part of standard cost accounting is a [[Variance analysis (accounting)|variance analysis]], which breaks down the variation between actual cost and standard costs into various components (volume variation, material cost variation, labor cost variation, etc.) so managers can understand ''why costs were different from what was planned'' and take appropriate action to correct the situation.

==The development of throughput accounting==
{{main|Throughput accounting}}

As business became more complex and began producing a greater variety of products,
the use of cost accounting to make decisions to maximize profitability came into question. Management circles became increasingly aware of the [[Theory of Constraints]] in the 1980s, and began to understand that "every production process has a limiting factor" somewhere in the chain of production. As business management learned to identify the constraints, they increasingly adopted [[throughput accounting]] to manage them and "maximize the ''throughput dollars''" (or other currency) from each unit of constrained resource.
Throughput accounting aims to make the best use of scarce resources(bottle neck) in a (JIT) Just in time environment.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Performance management, Paper f5. Kapalan publishing UK. Pg 17&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematical Formula ===

''''''
:&lt;math&gt;\text{throughput accounting ratio} = \frac{\text{return}}{\text {factory hours}}&lt;/math&gt;
(20/10)

==Activity-based costing==
{{main|Activity-based costing}}
[[Activity-based costing]] (ABC) is a system for assigning costs to products based on the activities they require. In this case, activities are those regular actions performed inside a company.&lt;ref&gt;Performance management, Paper f5. Kaplan publishing UK. Pg 6&lt;/ref&gt; "Talking with customer regarding invoice questions" is an example of an activity inside most companies.

Companies may be moved to adopt ABC by a need to improve costing accuracy, that is, understand better the true costs and profitability of individual products, services, or initiatives. ABC gets closer to true costs in these areas by turning many costs that standard cost accounting views as indirect costs essentially into direct costs. By contrast, standard cost accounting typically determines so-called indirect and overhead costs simply as a percentage of certain direct costs, which may or may not reflect actual resource usage for individual items.

Under ABC, accountants assign 100% of each employee's time to the different activities performed inside a company (many will use surveys to have the workers themselves assign their time to the different activities). The accountant then can determine the total cost spent on each activity by summing up the percentage of each worker's salary spent on that activity.

A company can use the resulting activity cost data to determine where to focus their operational improvements. For example, a job-based manufacturer may find that a high percentage of its workers are spending their time trying to figure out a hastily written customer order. Via (ABC) Activity based costing, the accountants now have a currency amount pegged to the activity of "Researching Customer Work Order Specifications". Senior management can now decide how much focus or money to budget for resolving this process deficiency. [[Activity-based management]] includes (but is not restricted to) the use of activity-based costing to manage a business.

While (ABC) Activity based costing may be able to pinpoint the cost of each activity and resources into the ultimate product, the process could be tedious, costly and subject to errors.

As it is a tool for a more accurate way of allocating fixed costs into product, these fixed costs do not vary according to each month's production volume. For example, an elimination of one product would not eliminate the overhead or even direct labor cost assigned to it.Activity based costing (ABC) better identifies product costing in the long run, but may not be too helpful in day-to-day decision-making.

== Integrating EVA and Process Based Costing ==

Recently, Mocciaro Li Destri, Picone &amp; Minà (2012).&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Mocciaro Li Destri A., Picone P. M. &amp; Minà A. (2012), Bringing Strategy Back into Financial Systems of Performance Measurement: Integrating EVA and PBC, Business System Review, Vol 1., Issue 1. pp.85-102.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a performance and cost measurement system that integrates the Economic Value Added criteria with Process Based Costing (PBC). The EVA-PBC methodology allows us to implement the EVA management logic not only at the firm level, but also at lower levels of the organization. EVA-PBC methodology plays an interesting role in bringing strategy back into financial performance measures.

==Lean accounting==
{{main|Lean accounting}}

[[Lean accounting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maskell &amp; Baggaley|title=Practical Lean Accounting|journal=Productivity Press, New York, NY|date=December 19, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; has developed in recent years to provide the accounting, control, and measurement methods supporting [[lean manufacturing]] and other applications of lean thinking such as healthcare, construction, insurance, banking, education, government, and other industries.

There are two main thrusts for Lean Accounting. The first is the application of lean methods to the company's accounting, control, and measurement processes. This is not different from applying lean methods to any other processes. The objective is to eliminate waste, free up capacity, speed up the process, eliminate errors &amp; defects, and make the process clear and understandable.
The second (and more important) thrust of Lean Accounting is to fundamentally change the accounting, control, and measurement processes so they motivate lean change &amp; improvement, provide information that is suitable for control and decision-making, provide an understanding of customer value, correctly assess the financial impact of lean improvement, and are themselves simple, visual, and low-waste. Lean Accounting does not require the traditional management accounting methods like [[standard costing]], activity-based costing, variance reporting, cost-plus pricing, complex transactional control systems, and untimely &amp; confusing financial reports. These are replaced by:
* lean-focused performance measurements
* simple summary direct costing of the value streams
* decision-making and reporting using a ''box score''
* financial reports that are timely and presented in "plain English" that everyone can understand
* radical simplification and elimination of transactional control systems by eliminating the need for them
* driving lean changes from a deep understanding of the value created for the customers
* eliminating traditional budgeting through monthly sales, operations, and financial planning processes (SOFP)
* value-based pricing
* correct understanding of the financial impact of lean change

As an organization becomes more mature with lean thinking and methods, they recognize that the combined methods of lean accounting in fact creates a lean management system (LMS) designed to provide the planning, the operational and financial reporting, and the motivation for change required to prosper the company's on-going lean transformation.

==Marginal costing==
{{see also|Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis|Marginal cost}}

The cost-volume-profit analysis is the systematic examination of the relationship between selling prices, sales, production volumes, costs, expenses and profits. This analysis provides very useful information for decision-making in the management of a company. For example, the analysis can be used in establishing sales prices, in the product mix selection to sell, in the decision to choose marketing strategies, and in the analysis of the impact on profits by changes in costs. In the current environment of business, a business administration must act and take decisions in a fast and accurate manner. As a result, the importance of cost-volume-profit is still increasing as time passes.

''CONTRIBUTION MARGIN''

A relationship between the cost, volume and profit is the contribution margin. The contribution margin is the revenue excess from sales over variable costs. The concept of contribution margin is particularly useful in the planning of business because it gives an insight into the potential profits that a business can generate. The following chart shows the income statement of a company X, which has been prepared to show its contribution margin:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Sales || $1,000,000
|-
| (-) Variable Costs || $600,000
|-
| Contribution Margin || $400,000
|-
| (-) Fixed Costs || $300,000
|-
| Income from Operations || $100,000
|}

''CONTRIBUTION MARGIN RATIO''

The contribution margin can also be expressed as a percentage. The contribution margin ratio, which is sometimes called the profit-volume ratio, indicates the percentage of each sales dollar available to cover fixed costs and to provide operating revenue. For the company Fusion, Inc. the contribution margin ratio is 40%, which is computed as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Contribution Margin Ratio} = (\text{Sales - Variable Costs}) / \text{Sales}&lt;/math&gt;

The contribution margin ratio measures the effect on operating income of an increase or a decrease in sales volume. For example, assume that the management of Fusion, Inc. is studying the effect of adding $80,000 in sales orders. Multiplying the contribution margin ratio (40%) by the change in sales volume ($80,000) indicates that operating income will increase $32,000 if additional orders are obtained. To validate this analysis the table below shows the income statement of the company including additional orders:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Sales || $1,080,000
|-
| (-) Variable Costs || $648,000 (1,080,000 x 60%)
|-
| Contribution Margin || $432,000 (1,080,000 x 40%)
|-
| (-) Fixed Costs || $300,000
|-
| Income from Operations || $132,000
|}

Variable costs as a percentage of sales are equal to 100% minus the contribution margin ratio. Thus, in the above income statement, the variable costs are 60% (100% - 40%) of sales, or $648,000 ($1,080,000 X 60%). The total contribution margin $432,000, can also be computed directly by multiplying the sales by the contribution margin ratio ($1,080,000 X 40%).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10879">In [[computing]], the term '''data warehouse appliance''' (DWA) was coined by Foster Hinshaw&lt;ref name="infostor.com"&gt;[http://www.infostor.com/index/articles/display/293088/articles/infostor/top-news/introducing-data-warehouse-appliances.html Infostor » Introducing 'data warehouse appliances']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tdwi.org"&gt;[http://tdwi.org/articles/2007/05/23/still-another-data-warehouse-appliance-is-coming.aspx TDWI » Still Another Data Warehouse Appliance Is Coming!]&lt;/ref&gt; for a computer architecture for [[data warehouse]]s (DW) specifically marketed for [[big data]] [[data analysis|analysis]] and discovery that is simple to use (not a pre-configuration) and high performance for the workload. A DWA includes an integrated set of servers, storage, [[operating system]]s, and [[database]]s.

In marketing, the term evolved to include pre-installed and pre-optimized hardware and software as well as similar software-only systems&lt;ref&gt;[http://ianalyze.net/2008/06/when-is-appliance-not-appliance.html Queries From Hell blog » When is an appliance not an appliance?]

[http://www.springerlink.com/content/vh3004748x33j461/ Database Are Not Toasters: A Framework for Comparing Data Warehouse Appliances]
&lt;/ref&gt; These are marketing uses of the term and do not reflect the technical definition.

A DWA is designed specifically for high performance big data analytics and is delivered as an easy-to-use packaged system. 
DW appliances are marketed for data volumes in the [[terabyte]] to [[petabyte]] range.

== Technology ==
The data warehouse appliance (DWA) has several characteristics which differentiate that architecture from similar machines in a [[data center]], such as an enterprise data warehouse (EDW).

# A DWA has a very tight integration of its internal components which are optimized for "data-centric" operations in contrast to "compute-centric" operations. The latter tend to emphasize number of CPU's, cores and network bandwidth. 

# A DWA is trivial to use and install. In contrast to a "pre-configuration" of components, a DWA has very few configuration switches or options. The elimination of such options significantly reduces configuration error – the number one cause for failure in large systems.

# A DWA is optimized for analytics on [[big data]]. In contrast, preceding architectures (including parallel ones) focused on "enterprise data warehouse" being a general-purpose repository for data and supporting analytics as an ancillary task.

Most DW appliances use [[massively parallel]] processing (MPP) architectures to provide high query performance and platform [[scalability]]. MPP architectures consist of independent processors or servers executing in parallel. Most MPP architectures implement a "[[shared-nothing architecture]]" where each server operates self-sufficiently and controls its own memory and disk. DW appliances distribute data onto dedicated disk storage units connected to each server in the appliance. This distribution allows DW appliances to resolve a [[relational query]] by scanning data on each server in parallel. The divide-and-conquer approach delivers high performance and scales linearly as new servers are added into the architecture.

== History ==
"Data warehouse appliance" is a term coined by Foster Hinshaw,&lt;ref name="infostor.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tdwi.org"/&gt; the founder of [[Netezza]]. In creating the first data warehouse appliance, Hinshaw and Netezza used the foundations developed by [[Model 204]], [[Teradata]], and others, to pioneer a new category to address consumer analytics efficiently by providing a modular, scalable, easy-to-manage database system that’s cost effective.

MPP database architectures have a long pedigree.  
Some consider [[Teradata]]'s initial product as the first DW appliance — or [[Britton Lee, Inc.|Britton-Lee]]'s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teradata Goes Appliance, Officially|quote=Teradata effectively established the DW appliance market a quarter-century ago when it rolled out the first in a long line of preconfigured, preoptimized solutions that combine CPUs, storage, software, and database to address the most demanding analytical and decision support requirements|url=http://blogs.forrester.com/james_kobielus/08-04-22-teradata_goes_appliance_officially|author=Kobielus, James|date=April 22, 2008|accessdate =2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Database machines and data warehouse appliances – the early days|quote=But for all practical purposes, the first two significant “database machine” vendors were Britton-Lee and Teradata. And since Britton-Lee eventually sold out to Teradata (after a brief name change to ShareBase), Teradata is entitled to whatever historical glory accrues from having innovated the database management appliance category.|url=http://www.softwarememories.com/2008/09/15/database-machines/|publisher=Monash Research|date=September 15, 2008 |accessdate =2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Teradata acquired Britton Lee — renamed ShareBase — in June, 1990.&lt;ref name="sharebase"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Teradata Corp. suffers first quarterly loss in four years
|url= http://www.allbusiness.com/north-america/united-states-california-metro-areas/123633-1.html
|journal=Los Angeles Business Journal |date=November 5, 1990 |accessdate=2008-07-14|author=Todd White}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Others disagree, considering appliances as a "disruptive technology" for Teradata&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Will a Data Warehouse Appliance Work for You?|quote=DATAllegro has a site at Sears. Sears uses [the appliance] as a front end to their Teradata warehouse to calculate aggregates. So when they want to do slice-and-dice, how many we sold in which stores and of what color, they use the appliance...I think [appliances] could be a disruptive technology for Teradata|url=http://www.itbusinessedge.com/cm/community/features/interviews/blog/will-a-data-warehouse-appliance-work-for-you/?cs=22447|author=All, Ann|date=Apr 6, 2007|accessdate =2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional vendors, including [[Tandem Computers]], and [[Sequent Computer Systems]] also offered MPP architectures in the 1980s.  [[Open source]] and [[commodity computing]] components aided a re-emergence of MPP data warehouse appliances. Advances in technology reduced costs and improved performance in storage devices, [[multi-core]] CPUs and networking components. Open-source [[RDBMS]] products, such as [[Ingres (database)|Ingres]] and [[PostgreSQL]], reduce software-license costs and allow DW-appliance vendors to focus on optimization rather than providing basic database functionality. 
Open-source [[Linux]] became a common operating system for DW appliances.

Other DW appliance vendors use specialized hardware and advanced software, instead of MPP architectures.&lt;ref name="tpc.org"&gt;[http://www.tpc.org/tpch/results/tpch_price_perf_results.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[Netezza]] announced a "data appliance" in 2003, and used specialized [[field-programmable gate array]] hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Netezza Performance Server (NPS™) 8000 Series |work= Product web page |publisher= Netezza |url= http://www.netezza.com/products/index.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040203155216/http://www.netezza.com/products/index.html |archivedate=February 3, 2004 |accessdate= August 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kickfire followed in 2008 with what they called a [[dataflow]] "sql chip".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kickfire.com/blog/?m=200811]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=not sure the company's own blog is a reliable source for this 'first to market' assertion |date=July 2009}}

In 2009 more DW appliances emerged. IBM integrated its [[IBM InfoSphere|InfoSphere]] warehouse (formerly DB2 Warehouse) with its own servers and storage to create the [[IBM Balanced Configuration Unit|IBM InfoSphere Balanced Warehouse]]. Netezza introduced its TwinFin platform based on commodity IBM hardware. Other DW appliance vendors have also partnered with major hardware vendors.  [[DATAllegro]], prior to acquisition by [[Microsoft]], partnered with [[EMC Corporation]] and [[Dell]] and implemented open-source Ingres on Linux.  [[Greenplum]] had a partnership with [[Sun Microsystems]] and implements Greenplum Database (based on PostgreSQL) on [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] using the [[ZFS]] file system. [[HP Neoview]] uses HP [[NonStop SQL]].

The market has also seen the emergence of data-warehouse bundles where vendors combine their hardware and database software together as a data warehouse platform. The [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] Optimized Warehouse Initiative combines the Oracle Database with hardware from various computer manufacturers ([[Dell]], [[EMC Corporation|EMC]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[IBM]], [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] and [[Sun Microsystems]]). Oracle's Optimized Warehouses offer pre-validated configurations and the database software comes pre-installed. 
In September 2008 Oracle began offering a more classic appliance offering, the HP Oracle Database Machine, a jointly developed and co-branded platform that Oracle sold and supported and HP built in configurations specifically for Oracle.&lt;ref&gt;

In [[variance analysis (accounting)]] '''direct material total variance''' is the difference between the [[actual cost]] of [[actual number]] of units produced  and its budgeted cost in terms of material.  Direct material total variance can be divided into two components:
*the [[direct material price variance]],
*the [[direct material usage variance]].

==Example==
Let us assume that standard direct material cost of [[Widget (economics)|widget]] is as follows:
:2 kg of [[unobtainium]] at $ 60 per kg ( = $ 120 per unit). 
Let us assume further that during the given period, 100 widgets were manufactured, using 212&amp;nbsp;kg of [[unobtainium]] which cost $ 13,144.

Under those assumptions direct material total variance can be calculated as:
{{Infobox VarianceAnalysis VarianceBox|tx1=100 units should have cost (&amp;times; $ 120 per unit)
|tx2=but did cost
|tx3=Direct material total variance
|am1=12,000
|am2=13,144
|am3=1,144
|va1=A
}}
Direct material total variance can be reconciled to [[direct material price variance]] and [[direct material usage variance]] by:
{{Infobox VarianceAnalysis VarianceBoxRec|tx1=Direct material usage variance
|tx2=Direct material price variance
|tx3=Direct material total variance
|am1=720
|am2=424
|am3=1,144
|va1=A
|va2=A
|va3=A
}}
See [[direct material usage variance#Example]] and [[direct material price variance#Example]] for computations of both components.

'''Sir Donald Currie''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|GCMG}} (17 September 1825{{snd}}13 April 1909) was a Scottish shipowner, politician and philanthropist.

==Early life and career==
He was born at [[Greenock]], Renfrewshire, on 17 September 1825, the third son of ten children of James Currie (1797–1851) and Elizabeth (1798–1839), daughter of Donald Martin, all of Greenock. 
His parents moved to [[Belfast]] in 1826, and Currie was sent at seven to the [[Belfast Academy]], and subsequently to the [[Royal Belfast Academical Institution]]; at both schools he distinguished himself. 
As a boy he interested himself in the sea and shipping, and at fourteen entered the shipping office of a relative in Greenock.
After four years there, he joined in 1844 the [[Cunard Steamship Company]], Liverpool, owners of the only regular line of steamers sailing between Europe and America, which numbered no more than three the ''Caledonia'', the ''Arcadia'', and the ''Britannia'', all of small tonnage. 
Currie became head of the company's cargo department. 
In 1849, in order to take advantage of the [[abolition of the navigation laws]], the company sent him to establish branch houses at [[Le Havre]] and [[Paris]], and in a short time they had a steamer running between Havre and America via Liverpool. 
He also established branch offices at [[Bremen]] and [[Antwerp]], returning to Liverpool in 1854.{{sfn|Hamilton|1912}}

In 1862, determining to start for himself, he established the 'Castle' shipping company, which consisted at first of sailing ships plying between Liverpool and [[Calcutta]], owned by a circle of personal friends. 
Currie first introduced the plan of despatching sailing ships on fixed dates.  
In 1865, he made London the port of departure of his vessels and took up his residence there.{{sfn|Hamilton|1912}}

==Development of the Union-Castle line==
[[File:Union-Castle liners in the East India Docks.jpg|thumb|300px|Union-Castle liners in [[East India Docks]], London in 1902]]
[[Image:CastleMail.png|right|thumb|Curries own "House Flag" used on his shipping line]]
The line grew steadily in strength and importance, and he resolved on a line of steamers from England to Cape Town, the first of which, the ''Iceland'', a vessel of 946 tons, started on her outward trip on 23 January 1872. 
At the time the [[Union-Castle Line#Predecessor lines|Union Steamship Company]], founded in 1853, carried on the principal trade between England and South Africa and had the contract for the mail service.{{sfn|Hamilton|1912}}

In 1876, the Cape parliament resolved to divide this service equally between the old company and the new. 
Ultimately in 1900, the two were amalgamated under the name of the Union-Castle Mail Steamship Company, Limited, the joint concern being managed by Messrs. Donald Currie &amp; Co. Before Sir Donald's death the fleet of the united company consisted of forty-seven steamers, with a gross tonnage of 295,411 tons. 
The enormous improvement of communication between England and South Africa was largely due to Sir Donald and his ships.{{sfn|Hamilton|1912}}

Currie soon became recognised as one of the highest authorities on shipping. In 1875, he was elected chairman of a committee of ship-owners to consider proposed changes in laws affecting the mercantile marine, and he was responsible for important amendments of the [[Merchant Shipping Act 1876|Merchant Shipping Act of 1876]].{{sfn|Hamilton|1912}}

Although the Cape Prime Minister [[John Molteno]] was a personal friend of Donald Currie, he refused to authorise Currie to run a monopoly – desiring instead to preserve a state of competition between the principal shipping companies. 
Molteno therefore ordered the South African mail service to be shared equally, between Currie's Castle Company and its older rival, the [[Union Company|Union Line]]. 
After lengthy negotiations, Currie agreed to alternating services, speed premiums and other clauses to promote competition. 
The new mail contract was signed on 5 October 1876 and Currie created the [[Union-Castle Line|Castle Mail Packets Company]], with the offices located at the Castle Shipping Line headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, M: ''Union-Castle Chronicle: 1853–1953''. Longmans Green, 1953. p.74&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially forbidden by the contract from amalgamating, keen competition ensued between the companies. This competition led to their shipping services running at unprecedented speed and efficiency. However the contract eventually expired and several decades later, in 1900, Castle Shipping Line and Union Line would merge and become the [[Union-Castle Line]].&lt;ref&gt;P.A.

London: Smith, Elder &amp; Co, 1900. Vol.II, p.120. {{ISBN|1-146-67157-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political service in South Africa and Britain==
[[File:Donald Currie Vanity Fair 21 June 1884.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;"the Knight of the Cruise of Mr Gladstone"&lt;br&gt;Currie as caricatured by Ape ([[Carlo Pellegrini (caricaturist)|Carlo Pellegrini]]) in [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]], June 1884&lt;/center&gt;]]
His knowledge of South African affairs often proved of advantage to the British government. 
In 1875 [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Carnarvon]], the colonial secretary, entrusted him with the conduct of negotiations with [[Johannes Brand|President Brand]] of the [[Orange Free State]] and [[Thomas François Burgers|President Burgers]] of the [[Transvaal Republic]] regarding the occupation of the [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] diamond fields. Currie defined the boundaries, and arranged the terms of agreement. 
Currie supplied the home government with the first news of the disaster of [[Isandhlwana]] during the [[Zulu war]] in January 1879. 
There was at that time no [[telegraphic]] connection between England and South Africa; the despatch announcing the calamity was sent from Cape Town by a Castle liner to St. Vincent, and thence telegraphed to Currie in London. 
Within forty-eight hours, one of the Castle liners started for South Africa with reinforcements. 
In 1883, on Currie's representations, the British flag was hoisted at [[St. Lucia Bay]] in [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]], which the Germans would have captured a few days later.{{sfn|Hamilton|1912}}

In 1877, [[Paul Kruger]] and two others came to England as a deputation from the [[Transvaal Boers]] to the British government, begging for self-government. 
They sought Currie's aid. 
He introduced them to Lord Carnarvon, supporting their appeal; but his advice was not taken. When the [[South African war]] broke out in 1899, Currie's services were of great value in the conveyance of troops. 
His ships carried altogether 172,835 men to and from South Africa, together with thousands of tons of stores, and this without an accident. 
At the critical juncture in December 1899, when [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]] and [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] were ordered to the seat of war, he arranged that the Castle liner which conveyed Lord Roberts from England should be so timed as to meet Lord Kitchener at [[Gibraltar]] on his arrival there from Egypt, so that the two generals might travel together to Cape Town.{{sfn|Hamilton|1912}}

== Member of Parliament ==
In 1880, Currie had entered parliament in the [[Liberal Party (Scotland)|Liberal]] interest as one of the members for [[Perthshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Perthshire]]. This seat he held until 1885, when, on the division of the constituency, he was elected for [[West Perthshire (UK Parliament constituency)|West Perthshire]]. 
In 1886, he broke on the [[Irish home rule]] question with Gladstone, whom he had hitherto followed. He represented West Perthshire as a [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionist]] from 1886 until his retirement from parliament in 1900. 
He remained on intimate social terms with Gladstone, who was on several occasions between 1883 and 1895 his guest with other distinguished persons on one or other of his ships for summer cruises.{{sfn|Hamilton|1912}}

==Glenlyon and Fortingall==
In 1880 Currie purchased the Garth estate in Perthshire. 
In 1884, he added to this great property the adjoining [[Glen Lyon]] estate, and in 1903 that of [[Chesthill]]. 
He also purchased from [[Baron Macdonald|Lord Macdonald]] the island of [[Scalpay, Inner Hebrides|Scalpay]], off Skye, and the adjacent islands of [[Longa Island|Longa]], [[Guillamon]], and [[Paba (island)|Paba]].{{sfn|Hamilton|1912}}

To his tenants on all these properties Currie proved a generous landlord. 
New breeds of cattle and sheep were introduced, and large sums expended on the erection and improvement of churches, schools, and cottages. 
He delighted in sport in his [[deer-forests]], on his [[grouse moors]], and [[salmon rivers]].{{sfn|Hamilton|1912}}

==Philanthropy==
In his later years Currie was munificent in public gifts. In 1904 he gave to University College Hospital, London, ₤80,000 for a school of final medical studies, and ₤20,000 for a nurses' home and a maternity students' house. To the University of Edinburgh ho gave ₤25,000 for 'The Donald Currie Lectureship Endowment Fund,' and ₤6000 for the enlargement of the Students' Union. He also bestowed numerous benefactions on the United Free church of Scotland (he had 'come out' with his minister at the disruption of 1843) and the presbyterian church of England. He restored at a large cost the choir of Dunkeld cathedral. To Belfast, where he spent his boyhood, he was especially generous. To the 'Better Equipment Fund' of Queen's College there he gave ₤20,000, a gift which 'The Donald Currie Laboratories' there commemorate. He contributed a fourth of the cost of an athletic field for the Belfast students. In the Belfast Royal Academy, his first school, he founded scholarships at a cost of ₤2000, and, scholarships in the Royal Belfast Academical Institution at an expense of ₤1000. He helped, too, to pay off the debt of Fisherwick presbyterian church, Belfast, of which his father had been a member.{{sfn|Hamilton|1912}}

He died on 13 April 1909 at the Manor House, Sidmouth, Devonshire, and was buried in the churchyard of Fortingal, beside his Highland home.{{sfn|Hamilton|1912}}

==Family==
Currie was married in 1851 to Margaret, daughter of John Miller of Liverpool and Ardencraig, Bute, who survived him. He left three daughters, who are erecting at a cost of ₤25,000 a university hall to their father's memory in the University of Cape Town, of which the foundation stone was laid by the duke of Connaught in 1910.{{sfn|Hamilton|1912}}

Donald's brother, James Currie (d.1900) ran '''James Currie &amp; Co''' and founded the shipping company the '''Currie Line''' in [[Leith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/leith/31.htm|title=The Story of Leith - XXXI. The Commerce of Leith|website=www.electricscotland.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; James' son and Donald's nephew [[James Currie (shipowner)|James Currie]] [[FRSE]] (1863-1930) was a prominent amateur mineralogist and botanist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Former Fellows of The Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783 – 2002| publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh| isbn= 0 902 198 84 X| date=July 2006| url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and honours==
Currie was the recipient of many honours. 
In 1880, he was awarded the [[Fothergill gold medal]] of the [[Royal Society of Arts]] in recognition of 'the improvements which he had introduced into his passenger steamers.' 
In 1881, he was created C.M.G., and in 1897 [[Order of St Michael and St George|G.C.M.G.]] 
In 1906, he was made hon. LL.D. at Edinburgh, and received the freedom of the city of Belfast.{{sfn|Hamilton|1912}}

'''East London Tech City''' (also known as '''Tech City''' and '''Silicon Roundabout''') is the term for a [[Science park|technology cluster]] of high-tech companies located in [[Shoreditch]]/[[St Luke's, London|St Luke's]] and also in [[Hackney Wick]] in [[London]], England.&lt;ref name=bbcreveal&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-11689437|title=Cameron reveals Silicon Valley vision for east London|accessdate=4 November 2010|publisher=BBC News|date=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20101103-723812.html |title=UK's Cameron To Reveal Plans For Tech City In East London |accessdate=4 November 2010 |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=4 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107034514/http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20101103-723812.html |archivedate=7 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/silicon-valley-ndash-but-in-the-east-end-promises-pm-2124592.html|title=Silicon Valley – but in the East End, promises PM|accessdate=4 November 2010|publisher=The Independent|date=4 November 2010|location=London|first=Andrew|last=Grice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its nucleus broadly occupies an area between [[St Luke's, London|St Luke's]] and [[Hackney Road]].&lt;ref name=bbcreveal/&gt; 

A cluster of web businesses initially developed around the [[Old Street Roundabout]] in 2008. The area had historically been relatively run down compared to the City. The [[Great Recession|2008–09 recession]] further suppressed rents through the closure of numerous firms, making it affordable to technology start-ups, while redundancies from financial services companies, such as [[investment bank]]s, released a pool of experienced talent interested in entrepreneurship.&lt;ref name=Telegraph20180318&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/the-silicon-joke/|title=The Silicon joke?

From 2010, as the cluster developed, both local and national government supported its growth, with the goal of creating a cluster comparable to [[Silicon Valley]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=bbcreveal/&gt;&lt;ref name=tech&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/first-came-the-artists-then-came-the-hackers-the-strange-history-of-londons-own-silicon-valley|title=First came the artists, then came the hackers: The strange history of London’s own Silicon Valley|accessdate=16 January 2014|publisher=Tech Republic|date=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]], [[Facebook]], [[Google]], [[Intel Corporation|Intel]], [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] and [[Microsoft]] are among the companies that have invested in the area.&lt;ref name=no10announce&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/topstorynews/2010/11/pm-announces-east-london-tech-city-56606|title=PM announces East London ‘tech city’|publisher=Number 10|accessdate=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[City, University of London]], [[London Metropolitan University]], [[Imperial College London]], [[Queen Mary University of London]] and [[University College London]] are all academic partners in projects based in the cluster.&lt;ref name=speech&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/speeches-and-transcripts/2010/11/east-end-tech-city-speech-56602|title=East End tech city speech|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130109092234/http://number10.gov.uk/news/east-end-tech-city-speech/|publisher=Number 10|accessdate=4 November 2010 | archivedate = 9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MDE&gt;{{cite web|title=Mapping the Digital Economy: Tech City and the University|url=http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/fms/MRSite/Research/cities/Publications%202011/Mapping_the_Digital_Economy%5b1%5d.pdf|publisher=Cities Institute, London Metropolitan Business School|accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Technology companies located in the area in 2008 included [[Dopplr]], [[Last.fm]], Consolidated Independent, Trampoline Systems, [[Avoiding Mass Extinctions Engine|AMEE]], Skimbit (now [[Skimlinks]]), [[Songkick]], Poke London, Kizoom, Redmonk, [[moo.com|MOO]], LShift, Ket Lai, Solstice and Schulze &amp; Webb.&lt;ref name=Telegraph20180318/&gt; Other early companies to locate there were Tinker.it, [[flubit]], [[TweetDeck]], Berg, Fotango, weartical.com, Rummble, [[Squiz]], Techlightenment, BrightLemon, Believe.in, [[Livemusic]] and WAYN.

Plans to help accelerate the growth of the cluster were announced by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] in a speech given in east London on 4 November 2010.&lt;ref name=no10announce/&gt; A year later, Cameron announced that he was appointing entrepreneur [[Eric van der Kleij]] to lead the initiative.&lt;ref name="indy"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/eric-van-der-kleij-no-10-guru-set-to-super-charge-uks-tech-city-2350920.html|title=Eric van der Kleij: No 10 guru set to super charge UK's Tech City|last=Clark|first=Nick|date=8 September 2011|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=18 November 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 there were 85 startup companies in the area.&lt;ref name=WiredSR&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2010/02/start/silicon-roundabout |publisher=Wired Magazine |title=London's Silicon Roundabout |date=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011, approximately 200 firms were occupying the area, signifying a rapid increase in interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.searchofficespace.com/sos-news/tech-city-london%E2%80%99s-silicon-valley.html|title=Tech-City, London’s Silicon Valley|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine updated this figure in 2012 and suggested some 5,000 tech companies were located in the wider area centred on the Old Street roundabout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-02/06/silicon-roundabout|title=London's Silicon Roundabout|first=|last=WIRED|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wired maintains a topic on the area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.co.uk/topics/silicon-roundabout here]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 September 2011 it was announced that Google had acquired a seven-storey building near Old Street roundabout. Google said that the building, in Bonhill Street, would host "a range of activities, such as speaker series, [[hackathon]]s, training workshops and product demonstrations" in addition to providing workspace for new companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15088359 |publisher=BBC News |title=Google Boosts London's Silicon Roundabout \date=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building, known as Campus London, opened in March 2012.

In 2013 the Nominet Trust selected "5 startups making positive social change" which are based in the cluster: [[Streetbank]], [[Give What You’re Good At]], [[Videre Est Credere]], [[Buddy App]] and [[PaveGen]].&lt;ref&gt;Tech City News, "[http://techcitynews.com/2013/08/15/londons-top-tech-for-social-good/ London's Top Tech for Social Good]," 13 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by [[Ernst &amp; Young|EY]] published in 2016 highlighted the importance of London to the UK's [[FinTech]] industry in terms of availability of expertise and demand for services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An evaluation of the international FinTech sector|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/502995/UK_FinTech_-_On_the_cutting_edge_-_Full_Report.pdf|publisher=EY|accessdate=25 February 2016|date=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investment===
Investment in London's technology sector was $2.28 billion in 2015, 69 per cent higher than the $1.3 billion raised in 2014. Since 2010, London-based technology companies have collectively raised $5.2 billion of venture capital funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK tech firms smash venture capital funding record|url=http://www.londonandpartners.com/media-centre/press-releases/2016/20160106-vc-barometer-q4|publisher=London &amp; Partners|accessdate=2 February 2016|date=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Unreferenced|date=July 2009}}

A '''general union''' is a [[trade union]] (called ''[[labor union]]'' in [[American English]]) which represents [[worker]]s from all industries and companies, rather than just one organisation or a particular sector, as in a [[craft union]] or [[industrial union]]. A general union differs from a [[union federation]] or [[trades council]] in that its members are individuals, not unions. The creation of general unions, from the early nineteenth century in the United Kingdom and somewhat later elsewhere, occurred around the same time as efforts began to unionise workers in new industries, in particular those where employment could be irregular.

Proponents of general unions claim that their broader range of members allows more opportunities for [[solidarity action]] and better coordination in [[general strike]]s and the like. Detractors claim that the broader remit means they tend to be more [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] and respond less effectively to events in a single industry.

In the United Kingdom, general unions include the [[GMB (trade union)|GMB]] and the [[Transport and General Workers' Union]]. In Australia a good example of a general union is the [[Australian Workers' Union]].

An '''isoquant''' (derived from quantity and the Greek word iso, meaning equal) is a [[contour line]] drawn through the set of points at which the same quantity of output is produced while changing the quantities of two or more inputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Varian |first=Hal R. |title=Microeconomic Analysis |edition=Third |publisher=Norton |year=1992 |isbn=0-393-95735-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m20iQAAACAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chiang |first=Alpha C. |title=Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics |edition=Third |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1984 |isbn=0-07-010813-7 |pages=359&amp;ndash;363 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6gcoAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA359 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While an [[indifference curve]] mapping helps to solve the utility-maximizing problem of consumers, the isoquant mapping deals with the cost-minimization problem of producers. Isoquants are typically drawn along with [[isocost ]]curves in [[Conditional factor demands|capital-labor graph]]s, showing the technological tradeoff between capital and labor in the [[production function]], and the decreasing marginal returns of both inputs. Adding one input while holding the other constant eventually leads to decreasing marginal output, and this is reflected in the shape of the isoquant. A family of isoquants can be represented by an '''isoquant map''', a graph combining a number of isoquants, each representing a different quantity of output. Isoquants are also called equal product curves.

[[File:TE-Production-Isoquant.png|thumb|250px|left|Production isoquant (strictly convex) and [[isocost]] curve (linear)]]

An isoquant shows that extent to which the firm in question has the ability to substitute between the two different inputs at will in order to produce the same level of output. An isoquant map can also indicate decreasing or increasing [[returns to scale]] based on increasing or decreasing distances between the isoquant pairs of fixed output increment, as output increases. If the distance between those isoquants increases as output increases, the firm's production function is exhibiting decreasing returns to scale; doubling both inputs will result in placement on an isoquant with less than double the output of the previous isoquant. Conversely, if the distance is decreasing as output increases, the firm is experiencing increasing returns to scale; doubling both inputs results in placement on an isoquant with more than twice the output of the original isoquant.

As with indifference curves, two isoquants can never cross. Also, every possible combination of inputs is on an isoquant. Finally, any combination of inputs above or to the right of an isoquant results in more output than any point on the isoquant. Although the marginal product of an input decreases as you increase the quantity of the input while holding all other inputs constant, the marginal product is never negative in the empirically observed range since a [[Rational choice theory|rational]] firm would never increase an input to decrease output.

An isoquants shows all those combinations of  factors which produce same level of output. An isoquants is also known as equal product curve or iso-product curve.
It describes the firm's alternative methods for producing a given level of output.

==Shapes of Isoquants==
If the two inputs are perfect substitutes, the resulting isoquant map generated is represented in fig. A; with a given level of production Q3, input X can be replaced by input Y at an unchanging rate. The perfect substitute inputs do not experience decreasing marginal rates of return when they are substituted for each other in the production function.

If the two inputs are perfect complements, the isoquant map takes the form of fig. B; with a level of production Q3, input X and input Y can only be combined efficiently in the certain ratio occurring at the kink in the isoquant. The firm will combine the two inputs in the required ratio to maximize profit.

Isoquants are typically combined with [[isocost]] lines in order to solve a cost-minimization problem for given level of output.  In the typical case shown in the top figure, with smoothly curved isoquants, a firm with fixed unit costs of the inputs will have isocost curves that are linear and downward sloped;  any point of tangency between an isoquant and an isocost curve represents the cost-minimizing input combination for producing the output level associated with that isoquant. A line joining tangency points of isoquants and isocosts (with input prices held constant) is called the [[expansion path]].&lt;ref name="Salvatore"&gt;Salvatore, Dominick (1989). ''Schaum's outline of theory and problems of managerial economics,'' McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|978-0-07-054513-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only relevant portion of the isoquant is the one that is convex to the origin, part of the curve which is not convex to the origin implies negative marginal product for factors of production.
The higher the isoquant, the higher the production.

Dowd, with the help of his wife Tina, co-founded Sundance Vacations in 1991 after working in the [[vacation]] industry.

Dowd purchased a new property and built the current headquarters of his business in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hinerfeldcommercial.com/2007/11/14/detter-helps-sundance-vacations-find-new-home/ | title=Detter Helps Sundance Vacations Find New Home | publisher=Hinerfeld Commercial Real Estate | date=November 14, 2007 | accessdate=October 6, 2015 | last=Detter | first=Shannon | website=hinerfeldcommercial.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life, education and career==
Dowd was born in [[Sunbury, Pennsylvania]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and attended [[Shikellamy High School]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Later, he received a [[Bachelor of Engineering]] from [[Penn State University]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Dowd also served as an Army Reservist with the [[United States Army Reserve]].

His career with Sundance Vacations started in 1991 as a small marketing operation with just himself and his wife. The company has since grown to employ over 700 employees&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and has offices in four states. Dowd began the [[permission marketing]] portion of Sundance Vacations in 2003.

==Charitable endeavors==
In 2013, Dowd, along with his wife Tina, donated $50,000 to St. Vincent de Paul Soup Kitchen located in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://citizensvoice.com/news/sundance-vacations-owners-donate-50-000-to-food-kitchen-1.1223850|title = Sundance Vacations owners donate $50,000 to food kitchen|last = Wellock|first = Bill|date = October 27, 2011|work = Citizens' Voice|access-date = September 10, 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company donated $5,000 to the Wyoming Valley Children's Association (WVCA) and was the presenting sponsor for the April 22, 2017 [http://www.wvcakids.org/support-our-students/walk-a-thon/ Walk-a-Thon]. Sundance Vacations is also a supporter of [[Volunteers in Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteers_in_Medicine|title=Volunteers in Medicine|last=Miller|first=Mark|date=June 22, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=April 2018}} This year, they were the Hulu sponsor at the $5,000 level for the annual fundraiser that they have participated in for over three years. John Dowd is partnering with the [[United Way of America|United Way]] of NEPA and [[NASCAR]] for the Race for the Kids covered by [http://wnep.com/2017/07/28/racing-to-feed-the-hungry/ WNEP]. This event held at the [[Pocono Raceway]], also known as the "tricky triangle" will raise awareness of, and generate revenue for early childhood education in the community. [[Derrike Cope|Derrick Cope]], #55 is the sponsored driver for the event .

==Awards==
Dowd was named to the [[Glassdoor]] list of the Highest Rated CEOs for Small and Medium Businesses in North America on June 10, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://fortune.com/2015/06/10/top-small-business-ceos/|title = These are the top-rated small business CEOs|last = Roberts|first = Daniel|date = June 10, 2015|work = Fortune Magazine|access-date = September 10, 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dowd was honored by the Association of Fundraising Professionals, in 2014, as an Outstanding [[Philanthropist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/business/business-briefcase-november-16-2014-1.1788584|title = Business Briefcase, November 16, 2014|last = Baress|first = Joe|date = November 16, 2014|work = The Times-Tribune|access-date = September 10, 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kim played Bruce Lee to training [[Kurt McKinney]]'s martial artist.

Following Bates' [[Chinese Bridge]] success in September 2010 he joined The Travel Channel China as their newest host, where he began a regular travel series filmed throughout the Chinese countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2011-06/10/content_12670862.htm |title=Way of a warrior |publisher=Europe.chinadaily.com.cn |date=2011-06-10 |accessdate=2013-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2011-03/22/content_12206179.htm |title=Road warrior gives thumbs-up to freewheeling hitchhiking |publisher=Chinadaily.com.cn |date=2011-03-22 |accessdate=2013-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first shows focused on rural life in [[Hunan]], [[Guizhou]] and other Chinese provinces. Each show had Bates spending a week living with farmers and learning about their local cultures.

In 2011 Bates and 'The Travel Channel China' team spent two weeks in his home country of [[Switzerland]], filming several aspects of Swiss life:  chocolate-making, Alpine cowherding and cheese production, [[Swiss military]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.swisscham.org/bei/pdf/chinese_discover_switzerland_eng.pdf | title=Chinese discover Switzerland through eyes of Swiss youth | date=27 July 2011 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710202722/http://www.swisscham.org/bei/pdf/chinese_discover_switzerland_eng.pdf | archivedate=2012-07-10 | type=Press release}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting television show broke numerous records in China, with the first 30-minute episode registering 1.5 million views on video-sharing website [[Youku]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=/00:00 |url=http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMzAxNjIzNDI0.html |title=跟着老外回家乡第一集 我爱我家 110905—在线播放—《有多远走多远 2011》—综艺—优酷网，视频高清在线观看 |publisher=V.youku.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bates became more widely known in China than in his home country.

In early 2012 Bates began a new series, ''A Love for Adventure'' (我爱大冒险) and the ''Last Tribe'' (最后的部落). In this show, he travelled around the world seeking out small tribes who have maintained their traditional lifestyles in order to learn their survival techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=/00:00 |url=http://tv.cntv.cn/video/C11297/52fb4874af503ddd2e87d78c0a4e5c44 |title=《有多远走多远》 20130717 最后的部落 |publisher=tv.cntv.cn |date= |accessdate=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Bates completed filming of a new series for the [[Discovery Channel]], "Expedition X: Silk Road Rising".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=/00:00 |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/denise-keller-adventurer-liam-bates-073500739.html |title=Denise Keller and Adventurer Liam Bates Discover What Defines China's Ancient Silk Road Today, on EXPEDITION X: SILK ROAD RISING |publisher=Yahoo Finance |date= |accessdate=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrepreneur==

Bates started his first company in 2006 at 17 years old, Beijing-based Bridges to China.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bridgestochina.com/index.php?page=about |title=Learn martial arts and kung fu in China |publisher=Bridges to China |date= |accessdate=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Bates co-founded Kaiterra (formerly Origins Technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebeijinger.com/blog/2017/04/14/origins-ofo-and-other-beijing-startup-stars-make-forbes-30-under-30-asia-list|title=Laser Egg's Creators Make Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia List; Rebrand as Kaiterra|first=Kyle|last=Mullin|date=14 April 2017|website=www.thebeijinger.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;), a startup that develops IoT hardware and software products to measure global air quality and pollution levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technode.com/2016/04/07/manufacturing-hardware-in-china-from-scratch-as-an-expat-qa-with-liam-bates-co-founder-of-origins-technology/ |title=Manufacturing hardware in China from scratch as an Expat - QA with Liam Bates, co-founder of Origins Technology |publisher=Tech in Asia |date= |accessdate=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaiterra has raised an undisclosed amount from angel investors in an initial round of funding in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/origins-2|title=Origins Technology {{!}} crunchbase|website=www.crunchbase.com|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, Kaiterra's consumer air quality monitor, the Laser Egg, entered the Apple Stores across China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-gadgets-help-pollution-weary-chinese-breathe-easier-1460919605 |title=New Gadgets Help Pollution Weary Chinese Breathe Easier |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date= |accessdate=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Bates and Kaiterra co-founder Jessica Lam were selected for the Forbes 30 under 30 list.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt;

==Hangzhou Ambassador==

In May 2013 Bates was officially appointed tourism ambassador to the Chinese city of [[Hangzhou]]. Bates was awarded a €40,000/year contract to regularly visit and explore [[Hangzhou]], sharing his experiences on social media under the title of the 'Modern Marco Polo'. This made him the first foreigner ever to be appointed by China's government in such an official role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-2634905/Briton-promote-China-Facebook-locals-banned-site.html |title=The Daily Mail » Briton appointed by Chinese government to promote the country on Facebook (but locals are still banned from the site) |publisher=The Daily Mail |date= |accessdate=2014-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Xiangsheng==

Bates was formally invited to begin the study of ''[[xiangsheng]]'' (a traditional form of "crosstalk" comedy) by famous Chinese comedian [[Ding Guangquan]] after his success in the [[Chinese Bridge]] contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Justine |url=http://french.china.org.cn/culture/txt/2012-04/25/content_25229471.htm |title=La modernisation du xiangsheng pourrait favoriser sa renaissance |publisher=French.china.org.cn |date=2012-04-25 |accessdate=2013-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2012, in a traditional ceremony at the [[Confucius Institute]], [[University of Hawaii]], he was formally accepted into the xiangsheng hierarchy when he took [[Ding Guangquan]] to be his [[Sifu|Shifu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://confuciusinstitutehawaii.org/upcoming-events/past-events/xiangsheng-comic-dialogue-festival-with-master-ding-guangquan/ |title=» Xiangsheng (comic dialogue) festival with Master Ding Guangquan |publisher=Confuciusinstitutehawaii.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423053126/http://confuciusinstitutehawaii.org/upcoming-events/past-events/xiangsheng-comic-dialogue-festival-with-master-ding-guangquan/ |archivedate=2013-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today ''[[xiangsheng]]'' is still a large part of Bates' work, and he performs regularly on [[China Central Television]].

==Other work==

Bates became known publicly through [[Chinese Bridge]] and his travel shows, but he gradually expanded into other activities, including hosting live events and leading outdoors/survival courses. His popularity as a performer and foreign personality on Chinese television has grown steadily: his Chinese micro-blog has grown to tens of thousands of registered followers in just two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2011-04/22/content_12376555.htm |title=Information flow draws more people to weibo |publisher=Europe.chinadaily.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2013-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mahan Coal Limited''' is a disputed coal mine project in [[Singrauli district]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], India.   The project has been opposed by environmentalists since it seeks to pull down 1200 acres of old sal forests&lt;ref name=fp/&gt; for a coal mine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/mahan-at-all-costs-34230&lt;/ref&gt;  At least 500,000 prime [[sal tree]]s would be chopped, and 54 villages&lt;ref&gt;http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/fAB8jZp3H6OUkFxdAUVbXK/A-war-to-save-our-forests.html&lt;/ref&gt; with a considerable tribal population would be displaced.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-32443739 | title=How tribal Indians beat big coal firms | date=11 May 2015 | publisher=BBC | accessdate=8 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a group of villagers have also been supporting the mine since it would boost the local economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/madhya-pradesh-battle-for-coal-divides-mahan-villages/story-yyKkfeKOULc869B9wUVe3I.html | title=Madhya Pradesh: Battle for coal divides Mahan villages  | date=4 February 2015 | newspaper=Hindustan Times | first=Neeraj | last=Santoshi | accessdate=8 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
Mahan Coal Ltd is a Rs 5,000-crore joint venture between [[Essar Energy]] and the [[Aditya Birla Group]] (Hindalco).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.financialexpress.com/article/industry/companies/essar-hindalcos-mahan-coal-block-lobbying-for-3-yrs-greenpeace-claims-clearance-given-under-pressure/29279/&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the controversy is based on claims by [[Greenpeace India]] that the sanction for the coal mine was given based on a Gram Sabha (village board) resolution that had been forged.&lt;ref&gt;

}}Quote: Greenpeace alleged
that signatures of most of the villagers had been forged and that the
resolution also included signatures of at least six villagers who were not
alive.
&lt;/ref&gt;  The land was allocated to the company based on this document.  However, in 2014, the coal block land was deallocated by the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-supreme-court-cancels-214-of-218-coal-block-allocations-gives-operational-mines-6-months-to-wrap-up-2021185&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in sharp drops in the company's stocks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/jspl-hindalco-drop-on-concerns-over-de-allocation-of-coal-mines-114090400273_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Its original allocation in 2006 is part of the [[Indian coal allocation scam]]. During investigations, the Ministry of Power stated that it had opposed a role for Hindalco in the mine,&lt;ref name=fp&gt;

quote: Ministry of Power [told the CBI] that it did not recommend the 2006
allocation of 
Mahan coal block to Hindalco. Instead, it claimed to have asked the Ministry
of Coal to allocate Mahan to Essar Power.
&lt;/ref&gt; but the coal ministry under [[Manmohan Singh]] allocated the mine to the joint company.

===Opposition by Greenpeace India===
Since the BJP government came to power, the project has seen considerable support, and has been linked in the media for the Government actions against Greenpeace India.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/nda-govt-s-grouse-with-greenpeace-mahan-coal-block-protests-115022000023_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, Priya Pillai, a Greenpeace campaigner very active in Mahan, was [[Priya Pillai Offloading|offloaded from a flight]] while she was to meet some British MPs inquiring into the matter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-greenpeace-campaigner-priya-pillai-speaks-to-british-mp-s-via-skype-2052620&lt;/ref&gt;  The issue is relevant to Britain since Essar Power is listed in the London Stock Exchange.

This incident was seen

In March 2015, the Ministry of Environment did not give a clearance for the project,&lt;ref&gt;http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mahan-coal-block-mp-greenpeace-union-government/1/429588.html&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently Ministry of Coal announced that the Mahan coal block would not be auctioned for mining, which was viewed as a victory by the tribespeople living in the villages.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

'''Mohamed M. Abou El Enein''' (born September 5, 1951) is an Egyptian businessman, investor, public figure and politician. He is the chairman and founder of Cleopatra Group&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cleopatraceramics.com/Content/AboutUS?lang=en|title=Abou El Enein's statement on the Company website|website=cleopatraceramics.com|access-date=2016-08-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909142545/http://cleopatraceramics.com/Content/AboutUS?lang=en|archivedate=2016-09-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the founder of many major projects spread all over [[Egypt]].

He won several international awards and certificates of honor for his contribution to the various fields of business.

Abou El Enein founded Cleopatra Group in 1983. At the time, he started with the ceramics industry, with one factory. Within a very short period of time, this business expanded to encompass 60% of the local market share, in addition to opening up business in new international markets. Based on this leap forward, Abou El Enein’s business ventures were diversified to include the areas of agriculture, mining, real estate, tourism, media, high-tech projects and aviation (Abou El Enein is also a certified pilot&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aviationweek.com/paris-air-show-2015/egypt-s-cleopatra-group-signs-g600|title=Egypt’s Cleopatra Group Signs for G600|website=aviationweek.com|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Cleopatra branding and licensing ==
Beyond his traditional ventures in the ceramics industry, and having carved out a niche for the Cleopatra brand within his industries, Abou El Enein has since then moved on to establish the Cleopatra name and brand in a multitude of other industries and products.

A '''multilateral exchange''' is a transaction, or forum for transactions, which involve more than two parties.

For example, Alice gives Bob an apple in exchange for an orange, that is a bilateral exchange.
A multilateral exchange would involve a third party, for example:
Alice gives an apple to Bob who gives an orange to Charles, who gives a pear to Alice.

In the real world, such transactions are spread over time, and involved items of different values, and involve many more parties. A special type of accounting is used for this, called [[mutual credit]], or [[credit clearing]].

==Accounting==
Although any accounting framework can be used, there is one approach that fits naturally for multilateral exchange. It is the simplest possible database/spreadsheet design, [[single-entry bookkeeping system|single-entry bookkeeping]] rather than [[Double-entry bookkeeping system|double-entry bookkeeping]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

All accounts begin with a balance of zero, meaning they owe nothing and are owed nothing. An account may only close at zero, meaning it has given as much as it has received, i.e. that the exchange is complete with respect to all the other accounts. When a transaction happens, an entry is made in an accounting journal of a payment, or credit flowing in the opposite direction.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! #id !! Payee !! Payer !! Amount !! Description
|-
| 1 || Ann || Bob || 10 || Bob gave Ann an Apple
|-
| 2 || Bob || Charlie || 5 || Charlie gave Bob an Apricot
|-
| 3 || Charlie || Ann || 10 || Ann gave Charlie an Orange
|-
| Volume ||  ||  || 15 ||
|}
Account balances are derived by 'adding up' the journal.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Name !! Balance !!  Meaning
|-
| Ann || 0 || Balanced - Ann may close her account
|-
| Bob || +10-5=5 || Bob is owed (and obliged to take) goods and services to the value of 5 units
|-
| Charlie || +5-10=-5 || Charlie owes (and is obliged to give) goods and services to the value of 5 units
|-
| Total || 0 || nothing entered or left this closed system of accounts.
|}
The sum of all account balances is ''a priori'' [[zero]]. Accounts which close (or are retired) above zero have given more value to the other accounts than they have received and vice versa. Thus a positive balance represents not value *in* the account, but value *owed* to that account by (the aggregate of) all other accounts.

An account's balance in such a system, indicates not the position of the account with respect to past activities with other accounts, but also the activity needed to complete the exchange. thus a balance of +10 means that not only has the account delivered +10 more value to the other members than it has received, but that in order to complete the exchange it intends to receive +10 more in the future than it delivers.

Bob's obligation to spend 5, exactly matches Charlie's obligation to earn 5.

'''Nasser Ibrahim Al-Rashid''' (born 1939) ({{lang-ar|ناصر إبراهيم الرشيد الليلا}}) is a [[Saudi]] businessman. He is reputedly an influential advisor to the [[Saudi royal family]] and a US dollar billionaire. However he is not included in the ''[[Forbes]]'' list of the world's richest people as his personal wealth, like that of many Saudi insiders, cannot be assessed with much accuracy from publicly available information.

Al-Rashid completed his B.S. at the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] in 1965, and his PhD at the university in 1970. He has since remained a prominent donor to the University of Texas, and has been honoured by the university at its Distinguished Alumnus Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name="Communications1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Emmis Communications|title=The Alcalde|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yNYDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA19|date=March 1992|publisher=Emmis Communications|pages=19–|issn=1535-993X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dr Nasser Ibrahim Al-Rashid Strength and Training Center at the university is named in his honour. He is also a large donor to the [[University of Miami]] (FL) and its medical school. He owns one of the largest yachts in the world, the ''[[Lady Moura]]'', which reportedly cost over [[US$]]200 mm to build in the late 1980s. In March 1987 Al-Rashid was one of the guests at a state banquet hosted by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] for [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]] at Buckingham Palace.&lt;ref name=TimesMar87&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=Court Circular|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=wes_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=IF500264869&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|accessdate=13 November 2015|work=The Times|issue=62725|date=25 March 1987|page=16|subscription=yes|via=The Times Digital Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His previous wife, [[Mouna Ayoub]], a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] woman, is considered to be a French socialite. Ayoub subsequently wrote a memoir of their marriage, ''La vérité (The Truth)'', in which Nasser Ibrahim Al-Rashid is referred to as "Amir al-Tharik".&lt;ref name=TelegOct15&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/27/style/tmagazine/t_w_1505_remix_eastern_.html|title=Petro Dollies|author=Sameer Reddy|date=24 October 2015|work=The New York Times|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the memoir Ayoub likened her marriage to a "...a gilded cage where I felt myself to be unjustly treated and powerless...I was given the most sumptuous dresses and amassed a huge collection of jewels, yet I could only wear my black Arab robe and a veil. I was forbidden to speak to men, forbidden to see female friends not approved by my husband, forbidden to play sport, forbidden to laugh, or speak loudly in public." Al-Rashid and his eldest son with Ayoub subsequently sued the publishers of the memoir in the French courts to try and stop publication of the memoir, alleging a breach of their privacy.&lt;ref name=GuardJun00&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jun/20/jonhenley|title=Style victim blames it all on Saudis|author=Jon Henley|date=20 June 2000|work=The Guardian|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is currently married to Safia El Malqui, they have been together since early 1998. Not much is known publicly of al-Rashid, who prior to taking delivery of his yacht, maintained a relatively low profile among the wealthy Saudi elite.

Nasser Ibrahim Al-Rashid was one of three Saudi Arabian businessmen to donate over $US1 million to the [[Clinton Presidential Center]].&lt;ref name=TimesNov98&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=Distant donors|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=wes_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=IF503798530&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|accessdate=13 November 2015|work=The Times|issue=69486|date=20 November 2008|page=48|subscription=yes|via=The Times Digital Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
*On Saturday 19 May 2007, one of his yachts, ''[[Lady Moura]]'', nearly ran aground by the [[Cannes]] coastline during the film festival, where it suffered  hull damage and took on water. It was moored in Monaco. On 2 February 2010 ''Lady Moura'' was moored in [[Palma, Majorca]], however it has since returned to Monaco.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tf1.lci.fr/infos/france/faits-divers/0,,3450496,00-enorme-yacht-echoue-baie-cannes-.html Mer : Un énorme yacht s'échoue en baie de Cannes - France&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NewSport''' is a defunct American [[cable television|cable]] and [[satellite television|satellite]] [[television network]] that was owned by Rainbow Programming Holdings, a [[joint venture]] between the [[Rainbow Media]] subsidiary of [[Cablevision]], [[NBC]] and [[Liberty Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ailes cure for CNBC, talk web|url=https://variety.com/1993/scene/news/ailes-cure-for-cnbc-talk-web-110057/|author=John Dempsey|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=August 31, 1993|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predating the launch of the originally similar [[ESPNews]] by three years, it focused on 24-hour coverage of [[sports journalism|sports news]] and analysis.

==History==
NewSport debuted on October 1, 1993, replacing [[SportsChannel America]], a national version spun off of Rainbow's SportsChannel [[regional sports network]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ESPN 2 Ready For Prime Time|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/05/sports/espn-2-ready-for-prime-time.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 5, 1993|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; NewSport developed a unique [[news ticker|sports ticker]], known as the "NewSport Score Box", which debuted in 1995 and provided constantly updated score information on ongoing games and schedules for upcoming sports events at the bottom right of the screen.

The network also aired original programs such as ''NewSport Talk'' (a sports discussion program), ''NewSport Journal'', ''NewSport Tonite'' (a nightly program featuring news and analysis on the day in sports) and ''Scoreboard Central'' (which premiered on April 29, 1995, a 12-hour sports news program that aired on Saturdays and Sundays from 12:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. to 12:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NEWSPORT TO LAUNCH NEWS PROGRAM SCOREBOARD CENTRAL|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/1995/04/26/Sports-Media/NEWSPORT-TO-LAUNCH-NEWS-PROGRAM-SCOREBOARD-CENTRAL.aspx?hl=NewSport&amp;sc=0|periodical=Sports Business Journal|date=April 26, 1995|accessdate=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The network was slow to grow in coverage, with relatively limited carriage on cable system operators besides Cablevision, owner of SportsChannel and NewSport parent Rainbow Media. Ironically, even Cablevision did not give the network full-time coverage as it carried NewSport on the channel slots also occupied by [[The Weather Channel]] on some of their systems through a time-share arrangement. At its peak, NewSport had only about 10 million subscribers nationwide. This slow growth and lack of viewers, combined with the wide distribution and success of ESPNEWS and Rainbow reportedly losing more than $20 million operating the network, resulted in Rainbow Programming Holdings deciding to shut down NewSport on July 9, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NEWSPORT ENDS OPERATION; SUBSCRIBERS GET NEW CLASSIC CHANNEL|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/1997/05/2/Sports-Media/NEWSPORT-ENDS-OPERATION-SUBSCRIBERS-GET-NEW-CLASSIC-CHANNEL.aspx?hl=NewSport&amp;sc=0|periodical=Sports Business Journal|date=May 2, 1997|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Sports Classics==
'''American Sports Classics''' is a network that focused on sports nostalgia programming; it was originally set to launch after NewSport ceased operations on July 9, 1997, however its launch was postponed "indefinitely" for a time, after Rainbow Media transferred control of the network to Fox/Liberty Networks, a joint venture between [[News Corporation]], Liberty Media and Cablevision created after News Corporation acquired a 40% stake in Cablevision's sports properties for $850 million in June 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SPORTS LANDSCAPE ALTERED WITH FOX/LIBERTY-CABLEVISION DEAL|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/1997/06/23/Sports-Media/SPORTS-LANDSCAPE-ALTERED-WITH-FOXLIBERTY-CABLEVISION-DEAL.aspx?hl=American%20Sports%20Classics&amp;sc=1|periodical=Sports Business Journal|date=June 23, 1997|accessdate=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it launched that fall, the network featured a broad mix of biographical and magazine-style programs.

ASC's format contrasted with the similarly focused Classic Sports Network (which later became [[ESPN Classic]]), which at the time mostly showed archived sports event telecasts. Indeed, the reason why the launch was postponed in the first place was due to problems Rainbow faced in trying to obtain the rebroadcast rights to sporting events from the major professional and collegiate sports leagues or their broadcast partners, forcing American Sports Classics to rely on the magazine and biographical programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AMERICAN SPORTS CLASSICS' LAUNCH ON HOLD "INDEFINITELY"|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/1997/07/9/Sports-Media/AMERICAN-SPORTS-CLASSICS-LAUNCH-ON-HOLD-INDEFINITELY.aspx?hl=American%20Sports%20Classics&amp;sc=1|periodical=Sports Business Journal|date=July 9, 1997|accessdate=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like NewSport, ASC was unable to stand up to its competitors, specifically Classic Sports Network. The network ceased operations in mid-1998, shortly after SportsChannel discontinued operations upon its merger with [[Fox Sports Networks|Fox Sports Net]].

'''Ole Kirk Christiansen''' (7 April 1891 &amp;ndash; 11 March 1958) was the founder of the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[construction toy]] company [[The Lego Group]]. 

Christiansen was born in [[:da:Filskov|Filskov, South Jutland]], Denmark, the 10th son of an impoverished family in [[Jutland]]. {{cn|date=September 2017}} He trained as a [[carpenter]] and started making wooden toys in 1932 to make a living after having lost his job during the [[Great Depression]]. Soon after, his wife Kirstine died, leaving him to raise his four sons. Christiansen was inspired to construct a small wooden duck toy for his children. He never remarried. He soon learned his sons loved the new toy and decided to put the ducks into production, using the leftover wood from his old business.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

In 1942, a fire broke out at the factory, forcing them to rebuild. Initially, he made miniature versions of the houses and furniture as he worked on as a carpenter, but in 1947 moved to using plastics, which were originally small plastic bears and rattles. By 1949 he had produced over 200 plastic and wooden toys.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

Ole wanted a name for the group. In 1934 he launched a competition to name the company. The prize was a bottle of his own homemade wine. He won it himself.{{Failed verification|date=May 2018|reason=These sentences were probably lifted from some official Lego book rather than citing it, I've heard it before but its not in these citations}} Lego is a shortened form of the Danish words ''leg godt'', meaning "play well", and the company grew to become The Lego Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/bllego.htm|title=Timeline: Lego Group|publisher=Inventors.about.com|author=Mary Bellis|date=1 May 1954|accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 11 March 1958, Christiansen died from a heart attack at the age of 66,{{cn|date=May 2018}} and his third son [[Godtfred Kirk Christiansen|Godtfred]] promptly took over the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/christiansen.html|title=Inventor of the Week: Ole Kirk Christiansen|publisher=Lemelson-MIT Program|date=December 2004|archivedate=27 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527123958/http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/christiansen.html |accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SampleBankbook.png|200px|right|thumb|Sample passbook (open), containing the same transactions as the [[bank statement]]]]
A '''passbook''' or '''bankbook''' is a paper book used to record bank, or [[building society]] transactions on a [[deposit account]].

[[File:Inside a Post Office Savings Bank deposit book.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=A page with a pre-printed table.  It has handwritten entries showing amounts of deposits and withdrawals, and the balance.  Each entry has a post office date stamp.|The [[National Savings and Investments|Post Office Savings Bank]] introduced passbooks to rural 19th century Britain]]

Traditionally, a passbook is used for accounts with a low transaction volume, such as a [[savings account]]. A [[bank teller]] or [[postmaster]] would write, by hand, the date and amount of the transaction, the updated balance, and enter his or her initials. In the late 20th century, small [[dot matrix printer|dot matrix]] or [[inkjet printer]]s were introduced capable of updating the passbook at the account holder's convenience, either at an [[automated teller machine]] or a passbook printer, either in a self-serve mode, by post, or in a [[branch (banking)|branch]].

==History==
Passbooks appeared in the 18th century, allowing customers to hold transaction information in their own hands for the first time.  Up until then transactions were recorded in ledgers at the bank only, so that customers had no history of their own deposits and withdrawals.

The passbook, which was around the size of a passport, ensured that customers had control over their own information, and was called a "passbook" because it was used as a way to identify the account holder without needing further identification. It also regularly passed between the bank and the account holder for updating.&lt;ref name=telegraphpass&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/savings/9326252/Back-to-the-future-savings-passbook-trumps-the-internet.html |title=Back to the future' savings passbook trumps the internet |date=June 12, 2012 |publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
===Credits and deposits===
To add credit to an account by bringing [[cash]] to a bank in person, the account holder can fill a small '''''credit slip''''' or '''''deposit slip'''''. The total amount of each note and coin is counted and entered on the slip, along with who it is paid in by and the date. The cash and details are counted and checked by the teller at the bank, if everything is in order the deposit is credited to the account, the ''credit slip'' is then kept by the bank and the ''credit slip booklet'' is stamped with the date and then returned to the account holder. An account holder uses their passbook to record their history of transactions with their bank.

===Debits and withdrawals===
Withdrawals normally required the account holder to visit the branch where the account was held, where a '''''debit slip''''' or '''''withdrawal slip''''' would be prepared and signed. If the account holder was not known to the teller, the signature on the slip and the authorities would be checked against the signature card at the branch, before money was paid out. In the 1980s, banks adopted the black light signature system for passbooks, which enabled withdrawals to be made from passbooks at a branch other than the one where an account was opened, unless prior arrangements were made to transfer the signature card to the other branch. Under this system, the passbook's owner would sign in the back of the passbook in an invisible ink and the signing authorities would also be noted. At the paying branch, the signature on the withdrawal slip would be checked against the signature in the book, which required a special ultraviolet reader to read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/sponsored-films/commonwealth-bank-school-bank/clip2/ |title=Commonwealth Bank – The School Bank (1951) |date= |author= |publisher=Australia Screen |accessdate=23 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, customer verification is more likely to be by [[Personal identification number|PIN]] and commonly from an [[automated teller machine]].

==Direct banking==
{{Main|Direct bank}}
For people who feel uneasy with [[telephone banking|telephone]] or [[online banking]], the use of a passbook is an alternative to obtain, in real-time, the account activity without waiting for a [[bank statement]]. However, contrary to some bank statements, some passbooks offer fewer details, replacing easy-to-understand descriptions with short codes.&lt;ref name=telegraphpass&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

King Hussein hosted Peter Bawden in 1979 as an official guest of the Country of Jordan.]][[File:Bawden Drilling Houston Office--500px.png|thumb|Bawden Drilling United States headquarters in Houston, Texas.]] Bawden founded and built the world’s largest (at the time) privately owned oil and gas drilling company.  In business for over 35 years, and consisting of a large fleet of offshore and land rigs operated from offices worldwide, Bawden Drilling worked closely with Shell Oil, Mobil Corporation and Dome Petroleum, among others.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, A. (2015). We gambled everything: The life and times of an oilman.&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to Alberta in the fall of 1950 and founded Peter Bawden Drilling in 1952 shortly after his arrival in Calgary. In 1960, at the age of 31, Peter Bawden’s first drilling rig struck oil. With its acquisition of Trident Drilling, Bawden Drilling became Canada’s largest drilling company. In 1968, Peter Bawden Drilling acquired Brown Drilling in California. Thereafter, as a land drilling contractor, Bawden expanded the company's on-shore operations throughout North America, from the Arctic to the Gulf of Mexico, to Norway, Algeria, Australia, New Guinea, Indonesia, Philippines, Guatemala, Venezuela, Colombia, Madagascar, and the Middle East. Eventually having operations on every continent in the world.

A notable contribution of the Bawden organization was the development of Canadian oilfield expertise and technology in many parts of the world. Bawden’s first offshore assignments began in 1968 off the coast of Australia where the company operated that continent’s first self-containing platform rigs. In the North Sea, Bawden Drilling became the largest development-drilling contractor in the United Kingdom. Well known for technological, industry advances, Bawden designed and built the world’s largest (at that time) semi-submersible rig for Shell Oil. They also had large platform rig operations off the California coast, in the Persian Gulf and off the coast of Malaysia.

Bawden set many industry records including drilling a deviated well -11,324 feet in eighteen days from a fixed platform in the North Sea. Other notable rigs were located in the middle of the Pasadena Raceway and behind the Beverly Hills high school. He was a visionary trailblazer in his 1964 activities to promote Canada as an exporter of LNG (Liquefied Petroleum Gases). In 1977, he created Mosswood Oil &amp; Gas expanding into oil production.

Peter Bawden committed his life to the search for oil, gas and geothermal energy. Geothermal Drilling was a Bawden specialty with over 20 years of experience in the challenging tapping of hot water and steam reservoirs. Bawden won numerous industry awards for its emphasis on safety. The company also received the Canadian Export Award in 1985 and Export Achievement Awards in the years 1981, 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986.

Accessed 2010-07-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career in journalism==
Zahavi was born in [[Ness Ziona]] in 1943, the son of a shopkeeper who sold building materials to local tradesmen. He has two elder sisters and a brother.&lt;ref name="From journalist to sports Svengali"&gt;Wilson, Jonathan. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080604180332/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7d18fc5a-1ba6-11dc-bc55-000b5df10621.html "From journalist to sports Svengali"], [[The Financial Times]] 16 June 2007.

Retrieved 2010-07-27&lt;/ref&gt;

Zahavi began a career as a football journalist after dropping out of university.&lt;ref name="The go-between who oils wheels for Abramovich"&gt;Bower, Tom. [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+go-between+who+oils+wheels+for+Abramovich%3b+CHELSEA+REVOLUTION.-a0107736671 "The go-between who oils wheels for Abramovich"], [[The Daily Mail]] 13 September 2003.

Zahavi negotiated his first deal in 1979, the transfer of Israeli defender [[Avi Cohen]] from [[Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv]] to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. As a sports journalist, he built up a network of contacts throughout the 1980s. He gave up his job as a journalist in 1998 and negotiated his second deal the following year. This marked the beginning of his career as an agent and he continued to develop close ties in the football world by organising friendly internationals in Israel, inviting players, including [[Graeme Souness]] and [[Kenny Dalglish]], to holiday at his villa in [[Eilat]],&lt;ref name="From journalist to sports Svengali"/&gt; and even taking oranges to Melwood, Liverpool's training ground, as a gift for players and staff.&lt;ref name="Profile: Pini Zahavi"/&gt;

==Career as an agent==

===First transfer dealings===
Zahavi's first transfer deal was undertaken in 1979 when he helped arrange the transfer of  Israeli defender Avi Cohen from Maccabi Tel Aviv to Liverpool for £200,000.&lt;ref name="From journalist to sports Svengali"/&gt; Zahavi, who traveled to England regularly to watch football, recommended Cohen to Liverpool when he saw Peter Robinson, the then secretary of the club, at [[Heathrow]] airport during a flight delay caused by fog.&lt;ref name="Profile: Pini Zahavi"/&gt; The player had got to know Zahavi through his coverage of Maccabi Tel Aviv in ''Yedioth Ahronoth''.&lt;ref name="Profile: Pini Zahavi"/&gt; Zahavi was paid an introduction fee for his part in the deal.&lt;ref name="The go-between who oils wheels for Abramovich"/&gt;

A year later, Zahavi arranged a loan move to Maccabi Tel Aviv for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] player [[Barry Silkman]], with whom Zahavi would later be associated with when Silkman became a football [[sports agent|agent]].&lt;ref name="How Zahavi made contact sport an art form and became English football's kingmaker"&gt;Conn, David. [https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jan/17/sport.comment1 "How Zahavi made contact sport an art form and became English football's kingmaker"], [[The Guardian]] 17 January 2007. Retrieved 2010-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Zahavi negotiated the transfer of another Israeli player, forward [[Ronnie Rosenthal]], from [[Standard Liège]] to Liverpool.&lt;ref name="From journalist to sports Svengali"/&gt; [[Kenny Dalglish]] was by then Liverpool's manager.&lt;ref name="From journalist to sports Svengali"/&gt;

===Rio Ferdinand===
By this time, Zahavi had built an extensive network of contacts within English football. His friendships included not just [[Graeme Souness]] and Dalglish, but also [[Terry Venables]], [[Ron Atkinson]] and [[Alex Ferguson]], as well as many more among the next generation of managers and players.

In 1997, Zahavi negotiated the transfer of Israeli midfielder [[Eyal Berkovic]] from [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] to [[West Ham United]].&lt;ref name="Profile: Pini Zahavi"/&gt; Zahavi's association with Berkovic had already been responsible for the player's move from [[Maccabi Haifa F.C.|Maccabi Haifa]] to English football at Southampton, then being managed by Zahavi's friend, Graeme Souness.&lt;ref name="Pini plots world domination"&gt;Bond, David, Northcroft, Jonathan and Hawkey, Ian. "Pini plots world domination", [[The Sunday Times]], 13 July 2003. [http://find.galegroup.com/gps/infomark.do?&amp;contentSet=IAC-Documents&amp;type=retrieve&amp;tabID=T004&amp;prodId=IPS&amp;docId=CJ105424543&amp;source=gale&amp;srcprod=SP00&amp;userGroupName=suf_earl&amp;version=1.0 Link to article on InfoTrac National Newspapers Database (login required)]. Retrieved 2010-07-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

A side effect of the West Ham deal was that it was brought Zahavi into contact with [[Rio Ferdinand]]. Zahavi handled the transfer that took Ferdinand from West Ham to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] for £18&amp;nbsp;million in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leeds_united/1035797.stm "Leeds ready for place among elite"], [[BBC]], 22 November 2000. Retrieved 2010-07-27&lt;/ref&gt; and then his £30&amp;nbsp;million transfer from Leeds to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in 2002. As part of the deal, Zahavi was himself paid £1.13&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Why transfers and transparency still do not mix"&gt;Conn, David.

Retrieved 2010-07-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zahavi was a friend of the Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, whom he had first got to know in the late 1980s, and by the time of the Ferdinand transfer he was responsible for brokering almost every major Manchester United deal, including the sale of [[Jaap Stam]] to [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] for £16.5&amp;nbsp;million and the purchase of [[Juan Sebastián Verón]] from the same club for £28.1&amp;nbsp;million in 2001. [[Juan Sebastián Verón]] had been signed for Lazio by another friend of Zahavi's, [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]], whom he knew first as a young coach at [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]].&lt;ref name="Pini plots world domination"/&gt;

===Roman Abramovich and Chelsea===
In 2003, Zahavi played an important and central role in [[Roman Abramovich]]'s acquisition of [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and to the influx of players that followed.&lt;ref name="Profile: Pini Zahavi"/&gt; Zahavi became an influential member of Abramovich's inner circle&lt;ref name="'Mr Fix-it' trusted by top clubs' executives"/&gt; and was estimated to have earned as much as £5&amp;nbsp;million from the £111&amp;nbsp;million that Chelsea spent on players that summer.&lt;ref name="Profile: Pini Zahavi"/&gt;

In 1998, Zahavi had been introduced to Abramovich in [[Moscow]] by a mutual friend and so was able to provide an introduction when he was approached by Trevor Birch, the chief executive of the heavily indebted Chelsea, who were on the verge of being unable to pay their players' wages.&lt;ref name="Profile: Pini Zahavi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="One Oligarch's story"&gt;Belash, Vyacheslav.

==="Tapping-up" controversies===
====Ashley Cole====
In 2005, [[The Football Association]] (FA) recommended that Zahavi be investigated by the responsible bodies for his part in the "tapping-up" of the [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] left back [[Ashley Cole]], who was approached by Chelsea in contravention of [[Premier League]] regulations.&lt;ref name="The full judgement on Cole affair"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/4601247.stm "The full judgement on Cole affair"], [[BBC]] 1 June 2005.

===Portsmouth===
====Beginning of association and Yakubu transfer====
Zahavi became associated with [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] under the ownership of [[Milan Mandarić]]. He worked on the signings of Eyal Berkovic and [[Yakubu (footballer)|Yakubu]] from Maccabi Haifa, owned by Zahavi's school friend [[Ya'akov Shahar]], in April 2003 and was involved in the recruitment of [[Collins Mbesuma]] in August 2005.&lt;ref name="How Zahavi made contact sport an art form and became English football's kingmaker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="agent with his finger in many Portsmouth pies"&gt;Conn, David.

In July 2005, Zahavi agreed a fee of £3.64&amp;nbsp;million for his part in Yakubu's transfer from Portsmouth to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. The fee, agreed with middlesbrough's chief executive Keith Lamb, was to be paid in ten installments over five years if Yakubu remained at the club.

Retrieved 2010-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the deal, Zahavi made payments to Barry Silkman, the agent who is understood to have spotted Yakubu's potential when he was playing in Nigeria and to have been responsible for the $500,000 transfer that took the player to Maccabi Haifa in 1999.&lt;ref name="How Zahavi made contact sport an art form and became English football's kingmaker"/&gt;

====Takeover by Alexandre Gaydamak====
In January 2006, Zahavi, together with his partner, assisted with the sale of Portsmouth to [[Alexandre Gaydamak]].&lt;ref name="Gaydamak masters the game with no rules"&gt;Conn, David.

Zahavi worked on a number of deals for Portsmouth's new regime, bringing [[Avram Grant]] to the club, initially as a technical director in June 2006, signing a two-year scouting contract worth £800,000, and being involved in signing and selling a number of players.

When Portsmouth went into administration after multiple changes of owner in February 2010, Zahavi was among the 24 agents to whom the club owed almost £9&amp;nbsp;million. His own share of the outstanding amount totalled £2.074&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="agent with his finger in many Portsmouth pies"/&gt;

==Other business interests==
With his friend and associate, the businessman [[Eli Azur]], Zahavi co-owns a media company, Charlton, that holds the television rights in Israel for major sports, including those of the English Premier League and the [[Israeli Premier League|top flight of Israel's domestic football]].&lt;ref name="Pini plots world domination"/&gt; The decision of the company to broadcast the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] through a pay-per-view offering proved very unpopular in Israel, leading to a boycott of the service and compromising Zahavi's reputation in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Shaul Adar.

Retrieved 2010-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zahavi is also holds actions of HAZ Racing Team, one of the top motorsport teams in Argentina (the "Z" on HAZ comes from his last name).

==Personal life==
Zahavi is a widower with two children. He lives modestly in a seaside apartment in the north of [[Tel Aviv]] and rents a flat in [[Marble Arch]], London.&lt;ref name="Profile: Pini Zahavi"/&gt; He is the great uncle of footballer [[Alex Zahavi]].

'''''Re Taylor''''' is a leading [[New Zealand]] case on when the [[High Court of New Zealand|High Court]] will exercise its discretion and refuse to adjudicate a debtor [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]].

==Background==
The background to the application to adjudicate Mr Taylor bankrupt was summarised by [[Ted Thomas (judge)|Justice Thomas]],&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr Taylor's creditors, Mr and Mrs Greenwood, obtained a summary judgment against Mr Taylor on 17 April 1991 for $21,448.86. The [[summary judgment]] application had not been opposed. The judgment sum represented unpaid rent and outgoings for which Mr Taylor and his wife were liable under a lease which they had taken from Mr and Mrs Greenwood. The lease related to business premises occupied by Mr and Mrs Taylor's company. Sensitive readers liable to be easily disturbed should look the other way when I recite that the company went by the awful name of "Bath and Dunny Shop Limited". As befits its name it went down the drain, and it is now in liquidation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Following judgment, Mr and Mrs Greenwood were unable to obtain repayment of any part of their [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] debt. They sought execution against Mr and Mrs Taylor's assets, including their [[real property]], but the assets and property proved worthless, and there was no equity available for them or any other unsecured creditors. Consequently, on 16 March last, Mr and Mrs Greenwood issued a bankruptcy notice against Mr Taylor. It was renewed on 16 April 1992 and was finally served on Mr Taylor on 16 May.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Taylor'' (1992) 4 NZBLC 102,875.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Judgment==
The debtor, Mr Taylor, made an application in opposition to a [[bankruptcy]] notice. Although Taylor had no [[Legal technicality|technical]] grounds on which to oppose the notice, [[Ted Thomas (judge)|Justice Thomas]] held, &lt;blockquote&gt;For my part, I consider that adjudicating a person bankrupt when that person is essentially a victim of the current downturn in this country’s economy may, in certain circumstances, be unnecessarily severe. In Mr Taylor’s case I believe that the collapse of his business can be directly traced to the [[Rogernomics|political and economic developments]] which took place at the time. But for those developments, Mr and Mrs Taylor would probably have a thriving business today. Bankruptcy will not now realise one cent in the dollar for Mr and Mrs Greenwood. Moreover it is difficult to perceive any [[public interest]] element which would be served by making Mr Taylor bankrupt. He cannot get a job and it is unlikely that he will get credit. To make Mr Taylor bankrupt would be purely punitive and serve no practical or useful purpose. To my mind, sufficient cause exists for no order of adjudication to be made. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The only question, therefore, is whether the issue of bankruptcy should be left to be finally decided at the hearing of the petition, should Mr and Mrs Greenwood decide to pursue that course, or whether I should [[Stay of proceedings|stay the proceeding]] now. There is much merit in Mr Sadler’s observation that this proceeding should be brought to an end one way or another today. I therefore propose to grant a stay. In the event that Mr and Mrs Greenwood obtain evidence that Mr and Mrs Taylor’s fortunes have changed for the better it would be open to them to apply to the Court to uplift this stay. The debt as Mr and Mrs Taylor will appreciate, remains due and owing.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Taylor'' (1992) 4 NZBLC 102,875 at 879.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Significance==

The rule in ''Re Taylor'' is codified in the Insolvency Act 2006 which states that a court may at its discretion refuse to adjudicate a [[debtor]] bankrupt if "it is just and equitable that the court does not make an order of adjudication".&lt;ref&gt;Insolvency Act, s 37(c).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6052">'''Robert Hermann Garbe ''' (pronounced 'Garber') (9 January 1847 – 23 May 1932) was a German railway engineer and chief engineer of the [[Berlin]] division in the [[Prussian state railways]] from 1895 to 1917. He was especially known for his [[steam locomotive]] designs&lt;ref&gt;{{Herring-Ultimate Train}}, 150.&lt;/ref&gt; and is described as one of the greatest authorities on the locomotive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ransome-Wallis Encyclopedia}}, 498.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first to suggest the use of [[superheated steam]], universally. However, he saw superheated steam as competing with other innovations such as double expansion [[compound steam engine]]s (he held a grudge against Hannver's [[August von Borries|August Borries]] that his pupil [[Richard Paul Wagner]] inherited) or [[combustion chamber]]s.

His designs were, on the one hand, simple to maintain and operate; on the other hand, he blocked innovations that every other pre-Reichsbahn state railway used successfully. He held the belief that two coupled axles were enough for any express engine (his masterpiece being the [[Prussian S 6]] class) and trailing axles as in the "Pacific" configuration were unnecessary. The [[Prussian P 8]] class had to be re-designed almost entirely from his design to become successful, and he envisaged it as an express engine.

In that way, he is known as one of the key pioneers of locomotive design because of his achievements concerning the use of superheated steam; his image is tarnished, however, by a conservatism that was proven wrong time and again contemporarily (eg by the [[Bavarian S 3/6]]) and thereafter [[André Chapelon]] designed highly-successful modern compound locomotives, proving the success of every single innovation Garbe rejected).

== Childhood and Education ==
Born in [[Opole|Oppeln]] (present-day Opole, [[Opole Voivodeship]]), in [[Prussia]]n [[Upper Silesia]] on 9 January 1847, Garbe was the eldest son of the master [[locksmith]], Ferdinand Garbe. He went to elementary school in Oppeln and learned his father's locksmith trade. The desire for further education led him to the technical school at [[Breslau]], where he worked in the main workshops of the Upper Silesian Railway and passed his exams as an engine driver in 1867. He also visited the provincial trade school in [[Brzeg|Brieg]], passed the leaving exams with distinction and went, in 1869, to the Royal Prussian Trade Academy in Berlin (later the Berlin-Charlottenburg Technical High School and, today, the [[Berlin Technical University]]). He finished his studies in 1872 with top marks in all disciplines.

==Prussian Railway Division ==
Afterwards, Garbe was the director of the Central Railway Workshop in [[Frankfurt (Oder)]]. In 1877 the Ministry entrusted him with leading the main workshop in Berlin-[[Rummelsburg]].  In 1895 Garbe was nominated simultaneously as a board member of the Prussian Railway Division at Berlin and Head of Department for the Design and Procurement of Locomotives. In this capacity he also chaired the locomotive committee that had to make recommendations about future locomotive procurement to the Ministry of Public Works.

In  1907 the Prussian Railway Central Office was founded in Berlin. Here, Garbe took over the sphere of "Construction of  Superheated Steam Locomotives and Tenders". Inspired by the work of [[Wilhelm Schmidt (engineer)|Wilhelm Schmidt]] ('Hot Steam Schmidt') from [[Kassel]], Garbe was already in 1893 of the view that the use of [[superheated steam]] would give steam locomotives a power advantage.

== Locomotive Development ==
The locomotives developed on the basis of the policy issued by Garbe were characterised above all by good performance and simple construction. Consciously, he did not strive for high performance with his designs, but gave priority to reliability and ease of maintenance. By the time Garbe retired, a total of 13 superheated steam locomotive classes had been developed along those lines for all the important locomotive duties, together with a number of experimental designs. Garbe's design fundamentals had been so much part of Prussian locomotive development that they continued to be used even after his retirement.  

The [[Prussian P 8]] symbolises to a great extent Garbe's design principles. A total of 3,948 examples were built (including the Rumanian copies) and they were working German railway routes until the end of the steam era around 1972-1974. 

Garbe's major achievement in the field of technical steam locomotive development was the introduction of [[superheating]], for which he was a keen advocate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Herring-Ultimate Train}}, 150&lt;/ref&gt; He  disapproved of [[compound locomotive|compound working]]; he saw superheating as a total replacement for complicated and maintenance-intensive compound systems, not as an enhancement of them to produce increased power.

The most significant acknowledgement was granted to Garbe after he left the service of the state. The Berlin-Charlottenburg Technical High School awarded him an Honorary Doctorate of Engineering for his services in developing the superheated steam locomotive. 

He died on 23 May 1932 in [[Berlin]].

'''Karl Rudolf Walden''' (December 1, 1878 in [[Helsinki]] – October 25, 1946) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] industrialist and a military leader.

==Education==
Walden received his military education at the [[Hamina Cadet School]] and graduated in 1900. He was dismissed from service in 1902, in connection with a conscription strike.

==Finnish civil war==
From 20 February 1918, till 5 March 1918, Walden was chief of [[Vaasa]] military district. From then till 6 May 1918, he was chief of headquarters of the rear. He then became chief of security of the occupied areas until 22 May 1918. On 28 November 1918, Walden became minister of war and held this position until 15 August 1919. Walden was then promoted to commander in chief of the Finnish army and the [[Suojeluskunta|Civil Guard]] (27 November 1918 - 30 December 1918). Walden and general of the White army [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]] developed a close working relationship that continued throughout the inter war period (head of Finnish Red Cross in the 20th century) and during the Winter War and Continuation War.

==Finnish paper industry==
After leaving the army, Walden sought a career in business. He moved to [[Saint Petersburg]], the capital of the [[Russian Empire]], and after few years founded a sales agency for Finnish paper. As a steadfast patriot, Walden also became a prominent figure in the large Finnish community of Saint Petersburg. From 1906 to 1946, Walden worked in the [[Pulp and paper industry|paper industry]]. He worked to consolidate the Finnish paper industry. He founded ''[[:fi:Yhtyneet Paperitehtaat|Yhtyneet Paperitehtaat Oy]]'' ([[UPM (company)|United Paper Mills Ltd]]) and was the first president of "Finpap", a Finnish paper sales association.

==Winter War==
During the Finnish-Soviet [[Winter War]], Walden was recalled to active service. From 3 December 1939 to 27 March 1940, he was a member of the war cabinet. On 27 March 1940 he became [[Minister of Defence (Finland)|Minister of Defence]] and continued in this role till 27 November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://valtioneuvosto.fi/tietoa/historiaa/hallitukset-ja-ministerit/raportti/-/r/v9l/11 |title=Council of State - Ministers of Defence|publisher=Valtioneuvosto.fi |accessdate=30 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Walden was able to maintain important diplomatic relationships with [[Sweden]] and the [[United States]]. Walden represented Finland at the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Finnish)|Treaty of Tartu]] of 1920, the [[Moscow Peace Treaty (1940)]], and the [[Paris Peace Treaty|Armistice treaty of Moscow (1944)]].

After the Civil war and during the 1930s there was general distrust of the labour movement and the [[Spirit of the Winter War|patriotism of the Finnish worker]]. In Winter War this proved unfounded and the nation was united. Industrial leader Walden and [[Väinö Tanner]] ([[Social Democrat]] leader and Finnish foreign minister) had developed mutual respect and worked well together. In the so-called [[Betrothal of January]] 1940, Finland's industry associations acknowledged the trade unions as negotiation partners regarding labour issues.

== Civilian and military decorations ==
In 1919, Walden became Commander of the [[Order of the White Rose]]. Later, he received the Grand Cross of the order. For his services during and after the [[Finnish Civil War]] he was awarded the [[Order of the Cross of Liberty|Grand Cross of Liberty]]. He was also awarded the [[Iron Cross]] (1918). During the 1920s, Walden became a knight of the [[Order of the Polar Star]] (Sweden). In 1928, Walden received the Danish Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Dannebrog]] personally from King [[Christian X]]. During his service as minister of defence, Walden received several decorations including the Swedish [[Order of the Sword]], the German [[Order of the German Eagle]] and [[Iron Cross]] (1939) 1st and 2nd class, the Hungarian Grand Cross of Order of Merit, and the Romanian Grand Cross of [[Steaua României|Order of the Star]]. On 2 December 1944 he received the [[Mannerheim Cross]] of the [[Order of the Cross of Liberty]] for his services to the country.

'''Salvatore Grimaldi'''{{Needs IPA|Swedish}} ({{IPA-it|salvaˈtoːre ɡriˈmaldi|lang}}; born 25 May 1945) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] entrepreneur and speaker. He is the chairman of Företagarna and the CEO of [[Grimaldi Industri|Grimaldi Industri AB]].&lt;ref name="kristoffert&amp;ouml;rnmalm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/cykelkungen-har-sitt-italien-i-hjartat|title="Cykelkungen" har sitt Italien i hjärtat|author=Kristoffer Törnmalm|work=SvD.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Salvatore Grimaldi was born in [[Taranto]], [[Italy]]. He migrated from Italy to [[Västerås]], Sweden with his parents in the early 1950s.&lt;ref name="kristoffert&amp;ouml;rnmalm"/&gt; His mother came to Sweden to visit her brothers, who had found work at a company called Asea. She found Sweden to be such a beautiful country that she decided to stay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/livsstil/reportage/salvatore-grimaldi-mor-hade-sju-syskon-som-kom-hit-vi-skapade-ett-little-italy-i-vasteras/|title=Salvatore Grimaldi: Mor hade sju syskon som kom hit – vi skapade ett Little Italy i Västerås.|work=DN.SE|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After working at [[Volvo]], Grimaldi founded a grind mill in his own garage in [[Köping]] in 1970. In 1982, he started acquiring companies, including [[Bianchi Bicycles|Bianchi]], [[Monark]], [[Crescent]] and [[Stiga]]. He then restructured these companies and sold off portions of the companies that did not contribute to his business objectives. Grimaldi ultimately acquired substantial wealth from these transactions.&lt;ref name="kristoffert&amp;ouml;rnmalm"/&gt;

==Personal life==

'''Samir "Sam"  Hammam''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: سمير همام) is a Lebanese businessman, well known for his high-profile involvement in British [[association football|football]] clubs, and presently holding a life presidency at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-23439428.stm "Sam Hammam urges Cardiff FC fans to back Vincent Tan"][[BBC]]Retrieved on 17 August 2013,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wimbledon==
Originally moving to the area due to being a keen [[tennis]] fan, Hammam became involved in football by buying £40,000 worth of shares at [[Non-League football|non-league]] [[Wimbledon F.C.]] in two years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://football.guardian.co.uk/FA_Cup/Story/0,,629335,00.html "The Guardian: Still crazy"]&lt;/ref&gt; eventually taking full control of the club in 1977.&lt;ref name=inside&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/656552.stm|title=Hammam sells Wimbledon stake|date=25 February 2000|accessdate=5 January 2015|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Hammam, Wimbledon achieved four promotions in nine years, becoming a [[Football League First Division]] club in 1986 and winning the [[FA Cup]] in [[1987–88 FA Cup|1988]].

In 1990, before Wimbledon had moved out of their [[Plough Lane]] ground to groundshare at [[Selhurst Park]] with local rivals [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], Hammam bought out a covenant held on the ground by the [[London Borough of Merton|Council]] that required it to be retained for sporting use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisa.org.uk/cgi/l/articles/index.cgi?action=show&amp;id=523 "WISA article on lifting of Plough Lane covenant"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426070543/http://www.wisa.org.uk/cgi/l/articles/index.cgi?action=show&amp;id=523 |date=26 April 2012 }} Retrieved on 23 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s, Hammam failed in an attempt to relocate the club to [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/championship/3010879/Inside-Sport-Hammam-cast-in-villains-role-as-Dons-seek-happy-ending.html|title=Inside Sport: Hammam cast in villain's role as Dons seek happy ending|date=16 August 2001|accessdate=5 January 2015|work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Hammam sold 80% of his shares in Wimbledon to [[Bjørn Rune Gjelsten]] and [[Kjell Inge Røkke]]. He sold the remaining 20% to Gjelsten and Røkke in February 2000, three months before the club's relegation from the [[Premier League]].&lt;ref name=inside/&gt; In 2004, Wimbledon F.C. was relocated to [[Milton Keynes]] and rebranded as the [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|MK Dons]], with the newly formed [[AFC Wimbledon]] often considered the successor club to the original Wimbledon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/9223993.stm|title=AFC Wimbledon chase FA Cup history against Stevenage |date=25 November 2010|accessdate=5 January 2014|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cardiff City==
Hammam purchased control of Cardiff City F.C. at the end of 2000, where he picked up where he left off with Wimbledon. After taking over at Cardiff, Hammam controversially pledged to get the entire Welsh nation to support Cardiff by renaming the club ''"The Cardiff Celts"'' and changing the club colours to green, red and white.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/wales/846497.stm BBC Wales: Hammam: 'I will die for Cardiff Celts']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/wales/863572.stm BBC Wales: Fans are Hammam's big worry]&lt;/ref&gt;

At Cardiff he became a [[cult following|cult]]-hero with fans for taking part in their head-patting '[[The Ayatollah (football celebration)|do the Ayatollah]]' chant. One such game saw him performing the celebration during an infamous 2–1 home win in the [[FA Cup]] against then-[[Premier League]] side [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in 2002. This, along with other aspects of his behaviour during the match, was blamed for contributing to the subsequent violence between Leeds and Cardiff fans at the end of the match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/sport/Cardiff-supremo-rejects-mayhem-claims.2292427.jp "Cardiff supremo rejects mayham claims"], ''[[The Scotsman]]'' Retrieved on 6 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

After failing to get the new stadium plans agreed by [[Cardiff Council]] due to concerns over financial security in 2006, Hammam agreed to a takeover by a consortium led by new chairman [[Peter Ridsdale]] and including local businessman Paul Guy. In March 2008, Cardiff City began a court case against financial backers Langston over the repayment of a loan believed to be worth around £31 million. During the hearing the barrister representing the club named Sam Hammam as the man they believe to be behind the company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7290681.stm "Hammam named in Cardiff loan case"] [[BBC]] Retrieved on 14 March 2008,&lt;/ref&gt; No settlement was reached in the case.

In July 2013, following Cardiff City's promotion to the Premier League, it emerged that Malaysian businessman [[Vincent Tan]], who had taken effective control of the club in 2010, was in advanced talks with Hammam – confirmed as Langston's spokesman – about repayment of the loan, then thought to be around £24 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-23362625.stm "Vincent Tan: Cardiff City could be debt-free in 'days'"] [[BBC]] Retrieved on 17 August 2013,&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, on 18 July 2013, Tan announced that an "amicable resolution" had been reached between Cardiff City and Langston over the debt issue, with Sam Hammam becoming a life president of the club.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23413324.stm "Cardiff City: Tan &amp; Langston reach "amicable resolution""]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} [[BBC]] Retrieved on 17 August 2013,&lt;/ref&gt; Hammam confirmed this in an interview with the [[BBC]] on 24 July, requesting that fans of the club back the Malaysian owner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-23439428.stm "Sam Hammam urges Cardiff FC fans to back Vincent Tan"][[BBC]] Retrieved on 17 August 2013,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Hammam has achieved a level of notoriety in English football for his unusual antics at matches, frequently walking around the pitchside during games, and his eccentric methods of publicising himself and his players. On at least one occasion he made a player eat sheep's testicles prior to signing with Cardiff City.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/cardiff_city/1411563.stm BBC Sport:Prior moves to Cardiff 28 June 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tulio Alberto Gómez Giraldo''' (Manizales, Colombia), is a [[businessperson|business person]] and the 21st President and biggest shareholder of the Colombian football club [[América de Cali]]. He's the founder and owner of supermarket chains ''Superinter''.

== Career ==
He founded supermarkets Supeinter in the city of [[Cali]], in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cita web|url=http://www.elpais.com.co/deportes/america-de-cali-los-genes-de-don-tulio.html|title=América de Cali: los genes de don Tulio|access-date=4 December 2016|website=elpais.com.co|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 he bought a few shares in the [[America de Cali]] on advice from his wife, but realizing that he did not have so many rights, he bought more and kept 53% of the shares of the club that allowed him to make all the decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cita web|url=https://www.radionacional.co/noticia/actualidad/presidente-del-america-paso-vender-ganado-alimentos-a-negociar-futbol-0|title=La historia de Tulio Gómez, presidente del América de Cali|access-date=20 September 2016|website=radionacional.co|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 10 of 2016 he became the new Chairman of America de Cali.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cita web|url=https://colombia.as.com/colombia/2016/05/05/futbol/1462467970_048039.html|title=Tulio Gómez, el nuevo mandamás del América de Cali|access-date=5 May 2016|website=colombia.as.com|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 27, 2016, Tulio Gómez was one of the architect men in the rise of América de Cali to the [[Categoría Primera A]] of Colombian football, together with the team's coach that year [[Hernán Torres]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cita web|url=https://www.elespectador.com/deportes/futbolcolombiano/tulio-gomez-el-artifice-del-ascenso-articulo-667790|title=Tulio Gómez, el artífice del ascenso|access-date=27 November 2016|website=elespectador.com|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of Queensland Business School''' is the [[business school]] of the [[University of Queensland]], located in Brisbane, Australia. There are seven areas of research expertise across UQ Business School: Accounting, Business Information Systems, Finance, Management, Marketing, Strategy and Tourism.

The school began teaching its [[MBA]] program in 1972, the very first to be offered in [[Queensland]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} It became the first business school in Australia to meet the standards of the accrediting bodies - the US-based [[AACSB]] International&lt;ref&gt;https://datadirect.aacsb.edu/public/profiles/profile.cfm?runReport=1&amp;unitid=54855&amp;userType=All&lt;/ref&gt; and Europe’s [[EQUIS]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.efmd.org/accreditation-main/equis/accredited-schools&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Economist]]'' has ranked the UQ Business School 10th in the world in its 2016 Global Business School Rankings and 1st in the Asia-Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.economist.com/whichmba/full-time-mba-ranking&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 ''[[The Australian Financial Review|Australian Financial Review]]'' BOSS MBA Rankings ranked the school first in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afr.com/p/national/education/queensland_beats_melbourne_to_offer_qqYlQG2uOqyKsZ0owMygBL&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, along with Faculty of Business, Economics &amp; Law, UQ Business School collaborates with [[Mahidol University International College]] and [[The Chinese University of Hong Kong]] to introduce [https://bel.uq.edu.au/bihtm-exchange-opportunity-thailand-and-hong-kong Asia-Pacific Hospitality Management Program], exclusively available to its Bachelor of International and Tourism Management students. &lt;ref&gt;https://bel.uq.edu.au/bihtm-exchange-opportunity-thailand-and-hong-kong&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
UQ Business School’s origins date back to 1926 when the University of Queensland first began to offer accounting degrees. The Department of Accountancy was set up in 1961, and later became the School of Commerce. Management education began in 1972, when the first [[MBA]] students enrolled.

The school was renamed the Department of Business Administration and later became School of Management in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.business.uq.edu.au/about&lt;/ref&gt;

UQ Business School was formed in 2002 with the merger of the Schools of Commerce and Management, and two years later it expanded further when it merged with the Technology and Innovation Management Centre (TIMC).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.business.uq.edu.au/about&lt;/ref&gt;

UQ Business School was the first business school in Australia to gain dual accreditation from AACSB International and EQUIS - the most prestigious standards a business school can achieve.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.business.uq.edu.au/about&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campuses ==
UQ Business School operates over two sites. Most of the school’s staff are located at the St Lucia campus, a 114-acre site located seven miles from the centre of Brisbane within a bend in the [[Brisbane River]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

UQ Business School Downtown (UQBS Downtown) is situated in Brisbane’s central business district and is home to the school’s Corporate Education and MBA programs. It opened in 2004. This learning and conference centre won the Queensland Architecture Award (Interiors) in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecture.com.au/i-cms?page=6797 Australian Institute of Architects]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
{{unreferenced-section|date=August 2018}}
The WHEF seeks to bring together financially successful individuals from the Hindu Society, such as traders, bankers, technocrats, investors, industrialists, businessmen, professionals, economists, and thinkers under one roof so that each group can share their business knowledge, experience, and expertise with their fellow brethren to make them understand the principles of surplus wealth generation to make society prosperous.

==History==
{{unreferenced-section|date=August 2018}}
The forum was founded by Shri Swami Vigyananand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldhindunews.com/2014/08/07/29204/bio-profile-of-swami-vigyananand-ji/ |title=Bio-Profile of Swami Vigyananand ji |publisher=World Hindu News }}&lt;/ref&gt; , an Alumnus of the [[Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur]]. He says "We are now living in the 21st century, equipped with all the advanced technologies like airplane, internet, mobiles, and other modern facilities. When we go back in time to recollect the age of torture, destruction, suppression and humiliation that our forefathers underwent, we should derive inspiration from the fact that when our ancestors worked and survived in such difficult times and conditions, so what stops us from excelling in these technologically advanced times?"
