      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5533">The '''ambiguity effect''' is a [[cognitive bias]] where [[decision making]] is affected by a lack of information, or "ambiguity".&lt;ref name="CroskerryCosby2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Croskerry|first1=Pat|last2=Cosby|first2=Karen S.|title=Patient Safety in Emergency Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2SzgAFMw0RUC&amp;pg=PA220|year=2009|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-7727-8|page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect implies that people tend to select options for which the [[probability]] of a favorable outcome is known, over an option for which the probability of a favorable outcome is unknown. The effect was first described by [[Daniel Ellsberg]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borcherding|first1=Katrin|last2=Laričev|first2=Oleg Ivanovič|last3=Messick|first3=David M.|title=Contemporary Issues in Decision Making|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W3l9AAAAMAAJ|year=1990|publisher=North-Holland|isbn=978-0-444-88618-7|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
When buying a house, many people choose a fixed rate mortgage, where the interest rate is set in stone, over a variable rate mortgage, where the interest rate fluctuates with the market. This is the case even though a variable rate mortgage has statistically been shown to save money.

As an example, consider a bucket containing 30 balls. The balls are either red, black or white. Ten of the balls are red, and the remaining 20 are either black or white, with all combinations of black and white being equally likely. In option X, drawing a red ball wins a person $100, and in option Y, drawing a black ball wins them $100. The probability of picking a winning ball is the same for both options X and Y. In option X, the probability of selecting a winning ball is 1 in 3 (10 red balls out of 30 total balls). In option Y, despite the fact that the number of black balls is uncertain, the probability of selecting a winning ball is also 1 in 3. This is because the number of black balls is equally distributed among all possibilities between 0 and 20. The difference between the two options is that in option X, the probability of a favorable outcome is known, but in option Y, the probability of a favorable outcome is unknown ("ambiguous").

In spite of the equal probability of a favorable outcome, people have a greater tendency to select a ball under option X, where the probability of selecting a winning ball is perceived to be more certain. The uncertainty as to the number of black balls means that option Y tends to be viewed less favorably. Despite the fact that there could possibly be twice as many black balls as red balls, people tend not to want to take the opposing risk that there may be fewer than 10 black balls. The "ambiguity" behind option Y means that people tend to favor option X, even when the probability is the same.

A more realistic example might be the way people invest money. A risk-averse investor might tend to put their money into "safe" investments such as government bonds and bank deposits, as opposed to more volatile investments such as stocks and funds. Even though the stock market is likely to provide a significantly higher return over time, the investor might prefer the "safe" investment in which the return is known, instead of the less predictable stock market in which the return is not known.{{clarify|reason=The risk-averse investor actually has a lesser probability of losing money if he puts it into safe investments—in contrast to the ball-picking case, where the difference of probability is imagined. That is not an example of the effect.|date=January 2016}} The ambiguity effect is a possible explanation why people are reluctant to adopt new practices in the work place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Stephen D. |last1=Ritchie|title=Pro .NET Best Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DdoWkN4_rI8C&amp;pg=PA320|year=2011|publisher=Apress|isbn=978-1-4302-4023-5|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is human to avoid ambiguous knowledge - to assume things are knowable when they are not. This is related to the [[clustering illusion]]. When presented with large amounts of confounding variables, people still tend to claim knowledge of the unknowable.  This produces cognitive dissonance which when avoided leads people to try to change venues to something with more certainty.

== Explanation ==
One possible explanation of the effect is that people have a rule of thumb ([[Heuristic#Psychology|heuristic]]) to avoid options where information is missing.&lt;ref name="FrischBaron1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frisch|first1=Deborah|last2=Baron|first2=Jonathan|title=Ambiguity and rationality|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|volume=1|issue=3|year=1988|pages=149–157|doi=10.1002/bdm.3960010303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RitovBaron1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ritov|first1=Ilana|last2=Baron|first2=Jonathan|title=Reluctance to vaccinate: Omission bias and ambiguity|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|volume=3|issue=4|year=1990|pages=263–277|doi=10.1002/bdm.3960030404|url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~baron/papers.htm/vac.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will often lead them to seek out the missing information. In many cases, though, the information cannot be obtained. The effect is often the result of calling some particular missing piece of information to the person's attention.

'''Analogy''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀναλογία, ''analogia'', "proportion", from ''ana-'' "upon, according to" [also "against", "anew"] + ''logos'' "ratio" [also "word, speech, reckoning"]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da)nalogi%2Fa ἀναλογία],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones, with the assistance of Roderick McKenzie (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1940) on Perseus Digital Library. {{Cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da)nalogi%2Fa |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-05-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423101123/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da)nalogi%2Fa |archive-date=2016-04-23 |dead-url=bot: unknown |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=analogy analogy], Online Etymology Dictionary. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324131913/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=analogy|date=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[cognition|cognitive]] process of transferring [[information]] or [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] from a particular subject (the analog, or source) to another (the target), or a [[language|linguistic]] expression corresponding to such a process. In a narrower sense, analogy is an [[inference]] or an [[Logical argument|argument]] from one particular to another particular, as opposed to [[deductive reasoning|deduction]], [[inductive reasoning|induction]], and [[abductive reasoning|abduction]], in which at least one of the [[premise]]s, or the conclusion, is general rather than particular in nature. The term analogy can also refer to the relation between the source and the target themselves, which is often (though not always) a [[:wikt:similarity|similarity]], as in the [[analogy (biology)|biological notion of analogy]].
[[Image:Bohr atom model English.svg|thumb|200px|right|[[Ernest Rutherford|Rutherford's]] [[Rutherford model|model]] of the [[atom]] ([[Bohr model|modified]] by [[Niels Bohr]]) made an analogy between the atom and the [[Solar System|solar system]].]]

Analogy plays a significant role in [[problem solving]], as well as [[decision making]], [[argumentation]], [[perception]], [[generalization]], [[memory]], [[creativity]], [[invention]], prediction, [[emotion]], [[explanation]], [[conceptualization]] and [[communication]]. It lies behind basic tasks such as the identification of places, objects and people, for example, in [[face perception]] and [[facial recognition system]]s. It has been argued that analogy is "the core of cognition".&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter]] in Gentner et al. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Specific analogical language comprises [[wikt:exemplar|exemplification]], [[Comparison (grammar)|comparisons]], [[metaphor]]s, [[simile]]s, [[allegory|allegories]], and [[parable]]s, but ''not'' [[metonymy]]. Phrases like ''and so on'', ''and the like'', ''as if'', and the very word ''[[like]]'' also rely on an analogical understanding by the receiver of a [[message]] including them. Analogy is important not only in [[ordinary language philosophy|ordinary language]] and [[common sense]] (where [[proverb]]s and [[idiom]]s give many examples of its application) but also in [[science]], [[philosophy]], [[law]] and the [[humanities]]. The concepts of [[association (psychology)|association]], comparison, [[correspondence (mathematics)|correspondence]], [[homology (mathematics)|mathematical]] and [[homology (biology)|morphological homology]], [[homomorphism]], [[iconicity]], [[isomorphism]], [[metaphor]], resemblance, and similarity are closely related to analogy. In [[cognitive linguistics]], the notion of [[conceptual metaphor]] may be equivalent to that of analogy. Analogy is also a basis for any comparative arguments as well as experiments whose results are transmitted to objects that have been not under examination (e.g., experiments on rats when results are applied to humans).

Analogy has been studied and discussed since [[classical antiquity]] by philosophers, scientists, theologists and [[law]]yers. The last few decades have shown a renewed interest in analogy, most notably in [[cognitive science]].

==Usage of the terms "source" and "target"==
With respect to the terms ''source'' and ''target'' there are two distinct traditions of usage:

* The logical and cultures and economics tradition speaks of an ''arrow'', ''[[homomorphism]]'', ''[[Map (mathematics)|mapping]]'', or ''[[morphism]]'' from what is typically the more complex ''domain'' or ''source'' to what is typically the less complex ''[[codomain]]'' or ''target'', using all of these words in the sense of mathematical [[category theory]].
* The tradition in [[cognitive psychology]], in [[literary theory]], and in specializations within [[philosophy]] outside of [[logic]], speaks of a [[Conceptual metaphor#Mappings|mapping]] from what is typically the more familiar area of experience, the ''source'', to what is typically the more problematic area of experience, the ''target''.

==Models and theories==

===Identity of relation===

In ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] the word ''αναλογια'' (''analogia'') originally meant [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]], in the mathematical sense, and it was indeed sometimes translated to [[Latin]] as ''proportio''. From there analogy was understood as identity of relation between any two [[ordered pair]]s, whether of mathematical nature or not. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' held to this notion. Kant argued that there can be exactly the same [[Logic of relatives|relation]] between two completely different objects. The same notion of analogy was used in the [[United States|US]]-based [[SAT]] tests, that included "analogy questions" in the form "A is to B as C is to ''what''?" For example, "Hand is to palm as foot is to ____?" These questions were usually given in the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] format: HAND : PALM : : FOOT : ____ While most competent [[English language|English]] speakers will immediately give the right answer to the analogy question (''sole''), it is more difficult to identify and describe the exact relation that holds both between pairs such as ''hand'' and ''palm'', and between ''foot'' and ''sole''. This relation is not apparent in some [[lexical definition]]s of ''palm'' and ''sole'', where the former is defined as ''the inner surface of the hand'', and the latter as ''the underside of the foot''. Analogy and [[abstraction]] are different cognitive processes, and analogy is often an easier one. This analogy is not comparing ''all'' the properties between a hand and a foot, but rather comparing the ''relationship'' between a hand and its palm to a foot and its sole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v11n2/martin.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307062856/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v11n2/martin.html |archivedate=2013-03-07 |df= }},
Michael A. Martin, ''The Use of Analogies and Heuristics in Teaching Introductory Statistical Methods''&lt;/ref&gt; While a hand and a foot have many dissimilarities, the analogy focuses on their similarity in having an inner surface. A computer algorithm has achieved human-level performance on multiple-choice analogy questions from the [[SAT]] test. The algorithm measures the similarity of relations between pairs of words (e.g., the similarity between the pairs HAND:PALM and FOOT:SOLE) by statistical analysis of a large collection of text. It answers SAT questions by selecting the choice with the highest relational similarity.&lt;ref&gt;Turney 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shared abstraction===

[[Image:Crepuscular rays8 - NOAA.jpg|thumb|300px|In several [[culture]]s,{{which|date=December 2012}} the [[Sun]] is the source of an analogy to [[God]].]]
Greek philosophers such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] actually used a wider notion of analogy. They saw analogy as a shared abstraction.&lt;ref name="Shelley"&gt;Shelley 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Analogous objects did not share necessarily a relation, but also an idea, a pattern, a regularity, an attribute, an effect or a philosophy. These authors also accepted that comparisons, metaphors and "images" (allegories) could be used as [[argument]]s, and sometimes they called them ''analogies''. Analogies should also make those abstractions easier to understand and give confidence to the ones using them.

The [[Middle Age]] saw an increased use and theorization of analogy. [[Rome|Roman]] lawyers had already used analogical reasoning and the Greek word ''analogia''. Medieval lawyers distinguished ''analogia legis'' and ''analogia iuris'' (see below). In [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|Islamic logic]], analogical reasoning was used for the process of qiyas in Islamic [[sharia]] law and [[fiqh]] jurisprudence. In [[Christianity|Christian]] [[theology]], analogical arguments were accepted in order to explain the attributes of [[God]]. [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] made a distinction between ''equivocal'', ''univocal'' and ''analogical'' terms, the last being those like ''healthy'' that have different but related meanings. Not only a person can be "healthy", but also the food that is good for health (see the contemporary distinction between [[polysemy]] and [[homonymy]]). [[Thomas Cajetan]] wrote an influential treatise on analogy. In all of these cases, the wide Platonic and Aristotelian notion of analogy was preserved. [[James Francis Ross]] in ''Portraying Analogy'' (1982), the first substantive examination of the topic since Cajetan's ''De Nominum Analogia'', demonstrated that analogy is a systematic and universal feature of natural languages, with identifiable and law-like characteristics which explain how the meanings of words in a sentence are interdependent.

===Special case of induction===
On the contrary, [[Ibn Taymiyya]],&lt;ref name="Hallaq-94-5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Logic of Legal Reasoning in Religious and Non-Religious Cultures: The Case of Islamic Law and the Common Law|last=Hallaq|first=Wael B.|journal=Cleveland State Law Review|volume=34|year=1985–1986|pages=79–96 [93–5]|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

;Premises
:''a'' is C, D, E, F, G
: ''b'' is C, D, E, F
;Conclusion
: ''b'' is probably G.

This view does not accept analogy as an autonomous mode of thought or inference, [[reduction (philosophy)|reducing]] it to induction. However, autonomous analogical arguments are still useful in science, philosophy and the humanities (see below), which makes this reduction philosophically uninteresting. Moreover, induction tries to achieve general conclusions, while analogy looks for particular ones.

===Shared structure===
[[Image:Latimeria chalumnae01.jpg|thumb|left|300px|According to Shelley (2003), the study of the [[coelacanth]] drew heavily on analogies from other fish.]]
Contemporary cognitive scientists use a wide notion of analogy, [[Extension (semantics)|extensionally]] close to that of Plato and Aristotle, but framed by Gentner's (1983) structure mapping theory.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Dedre Gentner]] et al. 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The same idea of [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]] between source and target is used by [[conceptual metaphor]] and [[conceptual blending]] theorists. Structure mapping theory concerns both [[psychology]] and [[computer science]]. According to this view, analogy depends on the [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]] or alignment of the elements of source and target. The mapping takes place not only between objects, but also between relations of objects and between relations of relations. The whole mapping yields the assignment of a predicate or a relation to the target. Structure mapping theory has been applied and has found considerable confirmation in [[psychology]]. It has had reasonable success in computer science and artificial intelligence (see below). Some studies extended the approach to specific subjects, such as [[metaphor]] and similarity.&lt;ref&gt;See Gentner et al. 2001 and [http://groups.psych.northwestern.edu/gentner/publications2.htm Gentner's publication page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614055322/http://groups.psych.northwestern.edu/gentner/publications2.htm |date=2010-06-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Keith Holyoak]] and [[Paul Thagard]] (1997) developed their multiconstraint theory within structure mapping theory. They defend that the "[[coherence theory of truth|coherence]]" of an analogy depends on structural consistency, [[semantic similarity]] and purpose. Structural consistency is maximal when the analogy is an [[isomorphism]], although lower levels are admitted. Similarity demands that the mapping connects similar elements and relations of source and target, at any level of abstraction. It is maximal when there are identical relations and when connected elements have many identical attributes. An analogy achieves its purpose insofar as it helps solve the problem at hand. The multiconstraint theory faces some difficulties when there are multiple sources, but these can be overcome.&lt;ref name="Shelley"/&gt; Hummel and Holyoak (2005) recast the multiconstraint theory within a [[neural network]] architecture. A problem for the multiconstraint theory arises from its concept of similarity, which, in this respect, is not obviously different from analogy itself. Computer applications demand that there are some ''identical'' attributes or relations at some level of abstraction. The model was extended (Doumas, Hummel, and Sandhofer, 2008) to learn relations from unstructured examples (providing the only current account of how symbolic representations can be learned from examples).&lt;ref&gt;Doumas, Hummel, and Sandhofer, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Keane]] and Brayshaw (1988) developed their ''Incremental Analogy Machine'' (IAM) to include working memory constraints as well as structural, semantic and pragmatic constraints, so that a subset of the base analog is selected and mapping from base to target occurs in a serial manner.&lt;ref&gt;Keane, M.T. and Brayshaw, M. (1988). The Incremental Analogical Machine: a computational model of analogy. In [[Derek H. Sleeman|D. Sleeman]] (Ed). European working session on learning. (pp.53–62). London: Pitman.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Keane | first1 = M.T. Ledgeway | last2 = Duff | first2 = S | year = 1994 | title = Constraints on analogical mapping: a comparison of three models | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 18 | issue = | pages =  387–438| doi=10.1016/0364-0213(94)90015-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empirical evidence]] shows that human analogical mapping performance is influenced by information presentation order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Keane | first1 = M.T. | year = 1997 | title = What makes an analogy difficult?

Eqaan Doug and his team&lt;ref&gt;See Chalmers et al. 1991&lt;/ref&gt; challenged the shared structure theory and mostly its applications in computer science. They argue that there is no line between [[perception]], including high-level perception, and analogical thought. In fact, analogy occurs not only after, but also before and at the same time as high-level perception. In high-level perception, humans make [[Knowledge representation|representations]] by selecting relevant information from low-level [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]. Perception is necessary for analogy, but analogy is also necessary for high-level perception. Chalmers et al. conclude that analogy actually is high-level perception. Forbus et al. (1998) claim that this is only a metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;Forbus et al., 1998&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued (Morrison and Dietrich 1995) that Hofstadter's and Gentner's groups do not defend opposite views, but are instead dealing with different aspects of analogy.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison and Dietrich, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Actes des 11èmes Journées Françaises de l’Apprentissage''. Sète.&lt;/ref&gt; has presented analogy as a ''principle of economy'' and ''computational complexity''.

Reasoning by analogy is a process of, from a given pair ''(x,f(x))'', extrapolating the function ''f''. In the standard modeling, analogical reasoning involves two "objects": the ''source'' and the ''target''. The target is supposed to be incomplete and in need for a complete description using the source. The target has an existing part ''S&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' and a missing part ''R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''. We assume that we can isolate a situation of the source ''S&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', which corresponds to a situation of target ''S&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the result of the source ''R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', which correspond to the result of the target ''R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''. With ''B&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', the relation between ''S&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', we want ''B&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'', the relation between ''S&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''.

'''''If the source and target are completely known:'''''

Using [[Kolmogorov complexity]] ''K(x)'', defined as the size of the smallest description of ''x'' and [[Solomonoff]]'s approach to [[inductive inference|induction]], Rissanen (89),&lt;ref&gt;Rissanen J. (1989) : ''Stochastical Complexity and Statistical Inquiry''. World Scientific
Publishing Company, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Wallace (computer scientist)|Wallace]] &amp; Boulton (68) proposed the principle of [[minimum description length]]. This principle leads to minimize the complexity ''K(target | Source)'' of producing the target from the source.

This is unattractive in Artificial Intelligence, as it requires a computation over abstract Turing machines. Suppose that ''M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''M&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' are local theories of the source and the target, available to the observer. The best analogy between a source case and a target case is the analogy that minimizes:

:''K(M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(S&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(B&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(M&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(S&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(B&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;)'' (1).

'''''If the target is completely unknown:'''''

All models and descriptions ''M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''M&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''B&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''S&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''S&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' leading to the minimization of:

:''K(M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(S&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(B&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(M&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(S&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;)'' (2)

are also those who allow to obtain the relationship ''B&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'', and thus the most satisfactory ''R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' for formula (1).

The analogical hypothesis, which solves an analogy between a source case and a target case, has two parts:
* Analogy, like induction, is a ''principle of economy''. The best analogy between two cases is the one which minimizes the amount of information necessary for the derivation of the source from the target (1). Its most fundamental measure is the computational complexity theory.
* When solving or completing a target case with a source case, the parameters which minimize (2) are postulated to minimize (1), and thus, produce the best response.

However, a ''cognitive agent'' may simply reduce the amount of information necessary for the interpretation of the source and the target, without taking into account the cost of data replication. So, it may prefer to the minimization of (2) the minimization of the following simplified formula:

:''K(M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(B&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(M&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;)

==Applications and types==

===In language===

====Language, literature and humour====

* Under the guise of metaphor, analogy enables people to transmit their thoughts and outlooks in an indirect or allusive manner.
* In literature and poetry analogy is used in order to make people laugh. The humoristic value of analogy can easily be noticed in cartoons and comic performances.
* Analogy helps humans in making linguistic generalizations and categorization.
* Analogy can be discerned in the creation and emergence of terms present in language (similarity that obtains between the persons, animals, things or events yields the need of understanding them together under one common notion).&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski (2017) Multiple Functions of Analogical Reasoning in Science and Everyday Life. Polish Sociological Review no. 1/2017, pp. 13-16.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Analogy may facilitate the using of particular terms and concepts as well as understanding  - upon the terms and phrases coined in language - the ways in which people comprehend the world and relate to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski (2017) Multiple Functions of Analogical Reasoning in Science and Everyday Life. Polish Sociological Review no. 1/2017, pp. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Logic====
Logicians analyze how analogical reasoning is used in [[Argument from analogy|arguments from analogy]].

{{anchor|Analogy symbolism}}&lt;!--Redirect target--&gt;
An analogy can be stated using ''is to'' and ''as'' to represent the analogous relationship between two pairs of expressions, for example, "Smile is to mouth, as wink is to eye."  In the field of mathematics and logic, this can be formalized with [[Colon (punctuation)#Mathematics and logic|colon notation]] to represent the relationships, using single colon for ratio, and double colon for equality.&lt;ref name="REA-1994"&gt;{{cite book |author=Research and Education Association |editor1-last=Fogiel |editor1-first=M |title=Verbal Tutor for the SAT |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A17t-PP5xkgC&amp;pg=PA84 |accessdate=25 January 2018 |date=June 1994 |publisher=Research &amp; Education Assoc. |location=Piscataway, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-87891-963-5 |pages=84–86 |chapter=2. Analogies |oclc=32747316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of testing, the colon notation of ratios and equality is often borrowed, so that the example above might be rendered,  "Smile : mouth :: wink : eye" and pronounced the same way.&lt;ref name="REA-1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwartz-2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schwartz |first1=Linda |last2=Heidrich |first2=Stanley H.  |last3=Heidrich |first3=Delana S.  |title=Power Practice: Analogies and Idioms, eBook |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PaWURypwLcUC&amp;pg=PA4 |accessdate=25 January 2018 |date=1 January 2007 |publisher=Creative Teaching Press |location=Huntington Beach, Calif. |isbn=978-1-59198-953-0 |pages=4– |oclc=232131611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rhetoric and argumentation====
* An analogy is a [[speech communication|spoken]] or [[Writing|textual]] comparison between two words (or sets of words) or situations to highlight some form of [[semantics|semantic]] or relational similarity between them. Such analogies can be used for purpose of persuasion, formation of attitudes and other forms of argumentation. They function more as ex post justification (or rationalization) of a decision one made before than as a means of inventing solutions for a given problem. Analogy may strengthen [[Politics|political]], theological and [[Philosophy|philosophical]] [[Logical argument|arguments]], even when the semantic (superficial) similarity is weak or non-existent, provided their being crafted carefully for the audience. Analogies are sometimes used to persuade those who cannot detect the flawed or non-existent arguments. The persuasive force of an analogy used for the sake of argumentation may stem not only from the mere similarity between the items (situations) compared, but also from the very emotions (both positive and negative) that are transferred from the things, persons or events chosen as a point of comparison.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski (2017) Multiple Functions of Analogical Reasoning in Science and Everyday Life. Polish Sociological Review no. 1/2017, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Linguistics====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Comparative method]] --&gt;
* An analogy can be the [[linguistics|linguistic]] process that reduces word forms perceived as irregular by remaking them in the shape of more common forms that are governed by rules. For example, the [[English language|English]] [[verb]] ''[[wiktionary:help|help]]'' once had the [[preterite]] ''holp'' and the past participle ''holpen''. These [[obsolete]] forms have been discarded and replaced by ''helped'' by the power of analogy (or by widened application of the [[productive (linguistics)|productive]] Verb-''ed'' rule.) This is called ''[[Morphological leveling|leveling]].'' However, irregular forms can sometimes be created by analogy; one example is the [[Comparison of American and British English#Verb morphology|American English]] past tense form of ''[[wiktionary:dive|dive]]'': ''dove'', formed on analogy with words such as ''drive'': ''drove''.
* [[Neologisms]] can also be formed by analogy with existing words. A good example is ''[[software]]'', formed by analogy with ''[[computer hardware|hardware]]''; other analogous neologisms such as ''[[firmware]]'' and ''[[vaporware]]'' have followed. Another example is the humorous&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/underwhelm|title=underwhelm - definition of underwhelm in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-04-07|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816122000/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/underwhelm|archivedate=2016-08-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; term ''underwhelm'', formed by analogy with ''overwhelm''.
* Analogy is often presented as an alternative mechanism to [[generative linguistics|generative ''rules'']] for explaining [[productivity (linguistics)|productive]] formation of structures such as words. Others argue that in fact they are the same mechanism, that rules are analogies that have become entrenched as standard parts of the linguistic system, whereas clearer cases of analogy have simply not (yet) done so (e.g. Langacker 1987.445–447). This view has obvious resonances with the current views of analogy in cognitive science which are discussed above.

===In science===
* Analogies are above all used as a means of conceiving new ideas and hypotheses, which is called a heuristic function of analogical reasoning.
* Analogical arguments can play also probabative function, serving then as a means of proving the rightness of particular theses and theories. This application of analogical reasoning in science is, however, debatable. Probative value of analogy is of importance especially to those kinds of science in which logical or empirical proof is not possible such as theology, philosophy or cosmology in part where it relates to those areas of the cosmos (the universe) that are beyond any empirical observation and knowledge about them stems from the human insight and unsensory cognition.
* Analogy may be used in order to illustrate and teach (in order to enlighten pupils on the relations that happens between or inside certain things or phenomena, a teacher may refer to other things or phenomena that pupils are more familiar with).
* Analogy may help in creating or elucidating one theory (theoretical model) via the workings of another theory (theoretical model). Thus it can be used in theoretical and applied sciences in the form of models or simulations which can be considered as strong analogies. Other much weaker analogies assist in understanding and describing functional behaviours of similar systems. For instance, an analogy commonly used in electronics textbooks compares electrical circuits to hydraulics.&lt;ref&gt;Going with the flow: Using analogies to explain electric circuits. Mark D. Walker and David Garlovsky. School Science Review, 97, no. 361 (2016): 51-58.https://www.academia.edu/33380466/Going_with_the_flow_Using_analogies_to_explain_electric_circuits_Going_with_the_flow_Using_analogies_to_explain_electric_circuits&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the [[analog ear]] based on electrical, electronic or mechanical devices.
* Analogy can be helpful for the creation of notions and their systematization and classification, especially enabling scientists to make generalizations upon the discovery of an analogous structure or analogous internal laws present in different events or objects.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski (2017) Multiple Functions of Analogical Reasoning in Science and Everyday Life. Polish Sociological Review no. 1/2017, pp. 4-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mathematics====
Some types of analogies can have a precise [[mathematical]] formulation through the concept of [[isomorphism]]. In detail, this means that given two mathematical structures of the same type, an analogy between them can be thought of as a [[bijection]] between them which preserves some or all of the relevant structure. For example, &lt;math&gt; \Bbb{R}^2 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \Bbb{C} &lt;/math&gt; are isomorphic as vector spaces, but the [[complex numbers]], &lt;math&gt; \Bbb{C} &lt;/math&gt;, have more structure than &lt;math&gt; \Bbb{R}^2 &lt;/math&gt; does: &lt;math&gt; \Bbb{C} &lt;/math&gt; is a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] as well as a [[vector space]].

[[Category theory]] takes the idea of mathematical analogy much further with the concept of [[functor]]s. Given two categories C and D, a functor ''f'' from C to D can be thought of as an analogy between C and D, because ''f'' has to map objects of C to objects of D and arrows of C to arrows of D in such a way that the compositional structure of the two categories is preserved. This is similar to the [[Analogy#Shared structure|structure mapping theory of analogy]] of Dedre Gentner, in that it formalizes the idea of analogy as a function which satisfies certain conditions.

Thus, the mind may use analogies between domains whose internal structures fit according with a [[natural transformation]] and reject those that do not.

See also [[case-based reasoning]].

====Anatomy====
{{See also|Analogy (biology)}}
In [[anatomy]], two anatomical structures are considered to be ''analogous'' when they serve similar [[role|functions]] but are not [[evolution]]arily related, such as the [[Leg (anatomy)|legs]] of [[vertebrate]]s and the legs of [[insect]]s. Analogous structures are the result of [[convergent evolution]] and should be contrasted with [[homology (biology)|homologous]] structures.

==== Engineering ====

Often a physical [[prototype]] is built to model and represent some other physical object. For example, [[wind tunnels]] are used to test scale models of wings and aircraft, which act as an analogy to full-size wings and aircraft.

For example, the [[MONIAC Computer|MONIAC]] (an [[analog computer]]) used the flow of water in its pipes as an analog to the flow of money in an economy.

==== Cybernetics ====

Where there is dependence and hence interaction between a pair or more of biological or physical participants communication occurs and the stresses produced describe internal models inside the participants. [[Gordon Pask|Pask]] in his [[Conversation Theory]] asserts there exists an [[Conversation Theory#Conversation|analogy]] exhibiting both similarities and differences between any pair of the participants' internal models or concepts.

===In normative matters===

====Morality====
Analogical reasoning plays a very important part in [[morality]]. This may be in part because morality is supposed to be impartial and fair. If it is wrong to do something in a situation A, and situation B is analogous to A in all relevant features, then it is also wrong to perform that action in situation B. [[Moral particularism]] accepts analogical moral reasoning, rejecting both deduction and induction, since only the former can do without moral principles.

====Law====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Communist crime]] --&gt;
In [[law]], analogy is primarily used to resolve issues on which there is no previous authority. A distinction can be made between analogical reasoning employed in statutory law and analogical reasoning present in precedential law (case law).

=====Analogies in statutory law=====
In statutory law analogy is used in order to fill the so-called [[Non liquet|lacunas]] or gaps or loopholes.

First, a gap arises when a specific case or legal issue is not explicitly dealt with in written law. Then, one may try to identify a statutory provision which covers the cases that are similar to the case at hand and apply to this case this provision by analogy. Such a gap, in civil law countries, is referred to as a gap extra legem (outside of the law), while analogy which liquidates it is termed analogy extra legem (outside of the law). The very case at hand is named: an unprovided case.

Second, a gap comes into being when there is a statutory provision which applies to the case at hand but this provision leads in this case to an unwanted outcome. Then, upon analogy to another statutory provision that covers cases similar to the case at hand, this case is resolved upon this provision instead of the provision that applies to it directly. This gap is called a gap contra legem (against the law), while analogy which fills this gap is referred to as analogy contra legem (against the law).

Third, a gap occurs when there is a statutory provision which regulates the case at hand, but this provision is vague or equivocal. In such circumstances, to decide the case at hand, one may try to ascertain the meaning of this provision by recourse to statutory provisions which address cases that are similar to the case at hand or other cases that are regulated by vague/equivocal provision. A gap of this type is named gap intra legem (within the law) and analogy which deals with it is referred to as analogy intra legem (within the law).

The similarity upon which statutory analogy depends on may stem from the resemblance of raw facts of the cases being compared, the purpose (the so-called ratio legis which is generally the will of the legislature) of a statutory provision which is applied by analogy or some other sources.

Statutory analogy may be also based upon more than one statutory provision or even a spirit of law. In the latter case, it is called analogy iuris (from the law in general) as opposed to analogy legis (from a specific legal provision or provisions).

In statutory law analogy is also sometimes applied in order to liquidate the so-called conflicting or logical gap (i.e. the situation when two or more statutory provisions contradict each other) or the sui generis gap which stems from the lack of statutory regulation enabling the delivering of a decision whose passing is required by the law. Some other - less common as so-called ‘pertinent application of law’, ejusdem generis, typological notions  or presence of analogical pattern of reasoning in an a fortiori and comparative argument  - usages are also distinguished.&lt;ref&gt;See Maciej Koszowski, 	[http://www.aijcrnet.com/journals/Vol_7_No_1_March_2017/3.pdf The Scope of Application of Analogical Reasoning in Statutory Law]. American International Journal of Contemporary Research no. 1/2017 (v. 7): 16-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Analogies in precedential law (case law)=====
First, in precedential law (case law), analogies can be drawn from precedent cases (cases decided in past). The judge who decides the case at hand may find that the facts of this case are similar to the facts of one of precedential cases to an extent that the outcomes of these cases are justified to be the same or similar. Such use of analogy in precedential law pertains mainly to the so-called: cases of first impression, i.e. the cases which as yet have not been regulated by any binding judicial precedent (are not covered by a ratio decidendi of such a precedent).

Second, in precedential law, reasoning from (dis)analogy is amply employed, while a judge is distinguishing a precedent. That is, upon the discerned differences between the case at hand and the precedential case, a judge reject to decide the case upon the precedent whose ratio decidendi (precedential rule) embraces the case at hand.

Third, there is also much room for some other usages of analogy in the province of precedential law. One of them is resort to analogical reasoning, while resolving the conflict between two or more precedents which all apply to the case at hand despite dictating different legal outcome for that case. Analogy can also take part in ascertaining the contents of ratio decidendi, deciding upon obsolete precedents or quoting precedents form other jurisdictions. It is too visible in legal eductaion, notably in the US (the so-called 'case method').

An argument from analogy employed in precedential law is called case analogy as opposed to analogy employed in statutory law which is accordingly termed statutory analogy.&lt;ref&gt;See Maciej Koszowski, The Scope of Application of Analogical Reasoning in Precedential Law. Liverpool Law Review no. 1/2016 (v. 37): 9-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Analogies as a means of application of legal rules=====

In precedential law as well as in statutory law, analogy is also considered as a means of application of legal rules (statutory and precedential), serving thus as an alternative to legal deduction ([[legal syllogism]]). Then, there are compared instances to which a given rule applies with certainty with the facts of the case at hand. If the sufficient (relevant) similarity between them obtains, the rule is applied to the case at hand. Otherwise, the rule is deemed as inadequate for this case. Such analogy becomes a legal method.

Application of legal rules through analogy is more typical of the common law legal systems, especially when one deals with the so-called holdings (the denotation of a binding element of a judicial precedent in the US), being in civil law legal systems rather a proposition than an official mode of applying the law.

The instances from which analogy starts here off are called: base points, typical instances or paradigmatic cases.&lt;ref&gt;See Maciej Koszowski, Legal Analogy as an Alternative to the Deductive Mode of Legal Reasoning. The Indonesian Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law no. 1/2017: 73-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Restrictions on the use of analogy in law=====

In legal matters, sometimes the use of analogy is forbidden (by the very law or common agreement between judges and scholars). The most common instances concern criminal, administrative and tax law.

Analogy should not be resorted to in criminal matters whenever its outcome would be unfavorable to the accused or suspect. Such a ban finds its footing in the very principle: “''nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege''”, a principle which is understood in the way that there is no crime (punishment) unless it is expressly provided for in a statutory provision or an already existing judicial precedent.

Analogy should be applied with caution in the domain of tax law. Here, the principle: “''nullum tributum sine lege''” justifies a general ban on the employment of analogy that would lead to an increase in taxation or whose results would – for some other reason(s) – be to the detriment to the interests of taxpayers.

Extending by analogy those provisions of administrative law that restrict human rights and the rights of the citizens (particularly the category of the so-called “individual rights” or “basic rights”) is as a rule prohibited. Analogy generally should also not be resorted to in order to make  the citizen's burdens and obligations larger or more vexatious.

The other limitations on the use of analogy in law, among many others, pertain to:

* the analogical extension of statutory provisions that invlove exceptions to more general statutory regulation or provisions (this restriction flows from the well-known, especially in civil law continental legal systems, Latin maxims: “''exceptiones non sunt excendentae''”, “''exception est strictissimae interpretationis''” and “''singularia non sunt extendenda''”)
* the making of the use of an analogical argument with regard to those statutory provisions which comprise enumerations (lists)
* extending by analogy those statutory provisions that give impression that the Legislator intended to regulate some issues in an exclusive (exhaustive) manner (such a manner is especially implied when the wording of a given statutory provision involves such pointers as: “only”, “exclusively”, “solely”, “always”, “never”) or which have a plain precise meaning.

In civil (private) law, the use of analogy is as a rule permitted or even ordered by law. But also in this branch of law there are some restrictions confining the possible scope of the use of an analogical argument. Such is, for instance, the prohibition to use analogy in relation to provisions regarding time limits or a general ban on the recourse to analogical arguments which lead to extension of those statutory provisions which envisage some obligations or burdens or which order (mandate) something. The other examples concern the usage of analogy  in the field of property law, especially when one is going to create some new property rights by it or to extend these statutory provisions whose terms are unambiguous (unequivocal) and plain (clear), e.g.: be of or under cartian age.

The aforementioned bans on the use of analogy concern rather analogy which goes beyond the possible linguistic meaning of a statutory provision in question and do not pertain to analogy whose conclusions would remain within this meaning.&lt;ref&gt;See Maciej Koszowski, Restrictions on the Use of Analogy in Law. Liverpool Law Review no. 3/2016 (v. 37): 137-151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Maciej Koszowski, The Scope of Application of Analogical Reasoning in Precedential Law. Liverpool Law Review no. 1/2016 (v. 37): 29-30&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Nomenclature=====

Analogy in law – apart from the terminological distinctions mentioned above – can be found also under such Latin names and phrases as:

* “argumentum a simile (a simili)”, i.e. an argument from similarity or an inference based upon similarity
* an argument or reasoning “a pari”
* “argumentum a similibus ad similia”
* “argumentum (inference) per analogiam”
* an argument "ab exemplo", i.e. an argument from paradigmatic examples.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, 	[http://www.aijcrnet.com/journals/Vol_7_No_1_March_2017/3.pdf The Scope of Application of Analogical Reasoning in Statutory Law]. American International Journal of Contemporary Research no. 1/2017 (v. 7): 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Uniqueness of legal analogy=====

Legal analogy is sometimes claimed to be of a different nature than analogy that occurs in empirical science and everyday life. It is due to several peculiar factors. First, there is the lack of possibility of verification of conclusions of legal analogy on empirical grounds, which entails the necessity of performance of a legal analogical argument both heuristic and probative function. Second, legal analogy, as the law itself, is by definition prescriptive, non-descriptive. Third, it has an obligatory character: a judge is in many circumstances obliged to reason by analogy (treat similar cases in a similar manner). Fourth, the use of analogy in law  rather does not hinge on complex underling doctrines or theories. Fifth, serious practical consequences flow from the use of analogy in law. Sixth, the points of comparison are easily recognizable in case of legal analogy. Seventh, analogy in law becomes a vehicle for extension of authority. Eighth, how to reason by analogy is a subject of legal training and education. Ninth, legal analogy has gained enormous amount of  attention and scrutiny amongst scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, 	[http://journals.umcs.pl/sil/article/download/2830/pdf Why is analogy in empirical science and everyday life different from analogy in law?]. Studia Iuridica Lublinensia no. 2/ 2016: 127-143.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Structure of legal analogy=====

Legal analogy usually assumes the classical structure:

A case A possesses features X, Y, Z and has ascribed legal consequence G (the first premise).

An unregulated (unprovided) case B possesses features X, Y, Z (the second premise).

Therefore, the case B should be ascribed the legal consequence G (the analogical conclusion).

or:

There is a rule in force which addresses cases which features are A, B, C, D (the first premise).

There are unregulated (unprovided) cases which features are A, B, C and E or cases which features are A, B, C, D and E or cases which features are A, B, C and non-D (the second premise).

Therefore, there should be also a rule in force which addresses cases which features are A, B, C and E or A, B, C, D and E or  A, B, C and non-D that prescribes the same or similar legal consequece for these cases as the rule which addresses cases which features are A, B, C, D (the analogical conclusion).

Legal analogy can, however, assume also the structure of (mathematical) proportion, i.e.: A is to B as C is to D or A is to B as B is to C.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, [http://archiwum.ivr.org.pl/?ddownload=1482|Chaïm Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca’s Account of Analogy Applied to Law: the Proportional Model of Analogical Legal Reasoning], Archiwum Filozofii Prawa i Filozofii Społecznej no. 2/2016, pp. 8-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary proponents of proportional analogy, including legal one, are Chaïm Perelman and Lucie Olbrechts Tyteca.,&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, [http://archiwum.ivr.org.pl/?ddownload=1482|Chaïm Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca’s Account of Analogy Applied to Law: the Proportional Model of Analogical Legal Reasoning], Archiwum Filozofii Prawa i Filozofii Społecznej no. 2/2016, pp. 6-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaim Perelman i Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca, The New Rhetoric: A Treatise on Argumentation, Notre Dame 1969, for instance, p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, in law, analogy of proportion takes the form:

1) Determination of the relation that obtains between the facts of the regulated (provided) case and its legal consequence.

2) Determination of the relation that obtains between the facts of the case at hand and their posited legal consequence (i.e. the consequence that is supposed to be potentially adequate for this case).

3) Having ascertained that the relations pointed out in points 1 and 2 are identical or similar to each other, attribution to the case at hand  the legal consequence which has been posited for that case.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, [http://archiwum.ivr.org.pl/?ddownload=1482|Chaïm Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca’s Account of Analogy Applied to Law: the Proportional Model of Analogical Legal Reasoning], Archiwum Filozofii Prawa i Filozofii Społecznej no. 2/2016, pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In teaching strategies===
Analogies as defined in rhetoric are a comparison between words, but an analogy can be used in teaching as well. An analogy as used in teaching would be comparing a topic that students are already familiar with, with a new topic that is being introduced so that students can get a better understanding of the topic and relate back to previous knowledge. Shawn Glynn, a professor in the department of educational psychology and instructional technology at the University of Georgia,&lt;ref&gt;University of Georgia. Curriculum Vitae of Shawn M. Glynn. 2012. 16 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; developed a theory on teaching with analogies and developed steps to explain the process of teaching with this method. The steps for teaching with analogies are as follows: Step one is introducing the new topic that is about to be taught and giving some general knowledge on the subject. Step two is reviewing the concept that the students already know to ensure they have the proper knowledge to assess the similarities between the two concepts. Step three is finding relevant features within the analogy of the two concepts. Step four is finding similarities between the two concepts so students are able to compare and contrast them in order to understand. Step five is indicating where the analogy breaks down between the two concepts. And finally, step six is drawing a conclusion about the analogy and comparison of the new material with the already learned material. Typically this method is used to learn topics in science.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn, Shawn M. Teaching with Analogies. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 Kerry Ruef, a teacher, began an entire program, which she titled [[The Private Eye Project]]. It is a method of teaching that revolves around using analogies in the classroom to better explain topics. She thought of the idea to use analogies as a part of curriculum because she was observing objects once and she said, "my mind was noting what else each object reminded me of..." This led her to teach with the question, "what does [the subject or topic] remind you of?" The idea of comparing subjects and concepts led to the development of The Private Eye Project as a method of teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Katie. Educational Leadership: Exploring the World with the Private Eye. September 1995. 16 October 2013 .&lt;/ref&gt; The program is designed to build critical thinking skills with analogies as one of the main themes revolving around it. While Glynn focuses on using analogies to teach science, The Private Eye Project can be used for any subject including writing, math, art, social studies, and invention. It is now used by thousands of schools around the country.&lt;ref&gt;The Private Eye Project. The Private Eye Project. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
There are also various pedagogic innovations now emerging that use visual analogies for cross-disciplinary teaching and research, for instance between science and the humanities.&lt;ref name=Petrucci&gt;{{Cite journal  | author = Mario Petrucci  | title = Crosstalk, Mutation, Chaos: bridge-building between the sciences and literary studies using Visual Analogy  | url = http://www.mariopetrucci.com/Visualizations.htm  | deadurl = no  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130925113131/http://mariopetrucci.com/Visualizations.htm  | archivedate = 2013-09-25  | df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
====Catholic====
The Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 taught: ''For between creator and creature there can be noted no similarity so great that a greater dissimilarity cannot be seen between them.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/councils/ecum12-2.htm#2 Fourth Lateran Council of 1215]&lt;/ref&gt;

The theological exploration of this subject is called the ''analogia entis''. The consequence of this theory is that all true statements concerning God (excluding the concrete details of Jesus' earthly life) are analogical and approximations, without that implying any falsity.  Such analogical and true statements would include ''God is'', ''God is Love'', ''God is a consuming fire'', ''God is near to all who call him'', or God as Trinity, where ''being'', ''love'', ''fire'', ''distance'', ''number'' must be classed as analogies that allow human cognition of what is infinitely beyond positive or [[Via negativa|negative]] language.

The use of theological statements in syllogisms must take into account their essential analogical character, in that every analogy breaks down when stretched beyond its intended meaning.

===Everyday life===
* Analogy can be used in order to find solutions for the problematic situations (problems) that occur in everyday life. If something works with one thing, it may also work with another thing which is similar to the former.
* Analogy facilitates choices and predictions as well as opinions/assessments people are forced to do daily.
* Analogy is helpful in distribution of goods and privileges,  partition of burdens and dispension of treatment of other kind people deal with in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski (2017) Multiple Functions of Analogical Reasoning in Science and Everyday Life. Polish Sociological Review no. 1/2017, pp. 10-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hybrid analogies operating between disciplines===
Visual analogies have been developed that enable researchers to "investigate literary studies by means of attractive analogies taken principally from science and mathematics.  These analogies bring to literary discourse a stock of exciting visual ideas for teaching and research..." &lt;ref&gt;Visual Analogy/ Visualizations http://www.mariopetrucci.com/Visualizations.htm Retrieved: 08-05-2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anga Lipi''' (অঙ্গ লিপি) is a historical [[writing system]] or script of the [[Anga area]] of India.It is believed to have been originated from Mithilakshara or the [[Tirhuta]] script used to write [[Maithili language|Maithili]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}

==Etymology and history==
''[[Anga]]'' refers to a region in what is now [[Bihar]] and [[Jharkhand]] states of [[India]], and ''Lipi'' means ''script''. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Olivelle | first1 = Patrick | title =Between the empires: society in India 300 BCE to 400 CE | date = 2006 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = [[Oxford University]]  | isbn = 0-19-530532-9 | page =  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=efaOR_-YsIcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Anga Script is mentioned in an ancient Sanskrit language Buddhist book the [[Lalitavistara Sūtra|"Lalitvistar"]] (ललितविस्तर), which names Anga Lipi relatively early in the list of 64 scripts known to the Buddha. The script was specific to the [[Anga]] region, or [[Anga Mahajanapada]], and was among those known to Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Wilson  | first1 =John |  title =Indian Caste | date = 2005 | publisher = Adamant Media Corporation | location =   | isbn = 1-4021-7996-0 | page =  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2vPtVVNPcIC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;dq=anga+lipi&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=krkcTPfdOYqVrAertvzpCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEEQuwUwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=anga%20lipi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The script was mentioned as the fourth most important script of Ancient India in one version. [[Arthur Coke Burnell]] thought that some of the sixty four scripts mentioned in "Lalitvistar" were mythical, but he considered some, including Dravid, Anga and Banga, to be real, though not appearing as distinct alphabets until the 9th or 10th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 =Coke Burnell  | first1 =Arthur  |  title =Elements of South-Indian Palaeography | date = 1878| publisher = Trübner &amp; Co | location = London | isbn =  | page =  52 |url= https://archive.org/stream/elementssouthin05burngoog#page/n70/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Burnell regarded this passage as a late [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolation]].)

==Characteristics and comparison==
Anga Lipi and [[Eastern Nagari script]] might have been derived from Brahmic, with some regional characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Sircar  | first1 =D.C. |  title =Journal of ancient Indian history | date = 1986 | publisher = [[University of Calcutta]],Dept. of Ancient Indian History and Culture | location =  | isbn = | page =  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LfxtAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=anga+lipi&amp;dq=anga+lipi&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=I7McTMn7KsmGrQfuvaDfCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw}}&lt;/ref&gt; This supports the belief that the development of local characteristics in alphabets was continuing from earlier times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 =  K.L.M.  | first1 = Firma |  title =The people and culture of Bengal, a study in origins | date = 2002 |location =  | isbn =  | page =  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=viRuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=anga+lipi&amp;dq=anga+lipi&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=I7McTMn7KsmGrQfuvaDfCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apaurusheya''' ([[Sanskrit]]: अपौरुषेय, {{IAST|Apauruṣeya}}), literally means "not of a man" and "superhuman".&lt;ref&gt;Vaman Shivaram Apte, [http://www.aa.tufs.ac.jp/~tjun/sktdic/ ''The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary''], see apauruSeya&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used to describe the [[Vedas]], the earliest [[Hindu scripture|scripture]] in the [[Historical Vedic religion|World]].&lt;ref name=ds&gt;D Sharma, Classical Indian Philosophy: A Reader, Columbia University Press, ISBN , pages 196-197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Westerhoff (2009), Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka: A Philosophical Introduction, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195384963}}, page 290&lt;/ref&gt;

''Apaurusheya'' is a central concept in the [[Vedanta]] and [[Mimamsa]] schools of [[philosophy]]. These schools accept the ''[[Vedas]]'' as ''svatah pramana'' ("self-evident [[pramana|means of knowledge]]"). The Mimamsa school asserts that since the Vedas are composed of words ([[shabda]]) and the words  are composed of [[varna (phoneme)|phonemes]], the phonemes being [[Brahman|eternal]], the Vedas are also eternal.{{cn|date=January 2015}} To this, if asked whether all words and sentences are eternal, the Mimamsa philosophers reply that the rules behind combination of phonemes are fixed and pre-determined for the Vedas, unlike other words and sentences. The Vedanta school also accepts this line of argument.{{cn|date=January 2015}}

The '''Association for Contextual Behavioral Science''' ('''ACBS''') is a worldwide nonprofit professional membership organization associated with [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT), and [[relational frame theory]] (RFT) among other topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JlqqlVJ1iTUC&amp;pg=PA256#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Acceptance and Mindfulness in Cognitive Behavior Therapy  |author1=James D. Herbert |author2=Evan M. Forman |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|date= Nov 2010 |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "contextual behavioral science" refers to the application of [[functional contextualism]] to human behavior, including contextual forms of [[applied behavior analysis]], [[cognitive behavior therapy]], and [[evolution]] science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.nuim.ie/documents/Behavior%20Analysis%20and%20Contextualism.ppt#256,1,|title=Maynooth University Department of Psychology|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the applied area [[Acceptance and Commitment Therapy]] is perhaps the best known wing of contextual behavioral science, and is an emphasis of ACBS, along with other types of contextual CBT, and efforts in education, organizational behavior, and other areas. ACT is considered an empirically validated treatment by the [[American Psychological Association]], with the status of "Modest Research Support" in depression and "Strong Research Support" in chronic pain, with several others specific areas such as psychosis and work site stress currently under review.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=APA website on empirical treatments |url=http://www.div12.org/PsychologicalTreatments/treatments.html |accessdate=2009-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101005034058/http://www.div12.org/PsychologicalTreatments/treatments.html |archivedate=2010-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ACT is also listed as evidence-based by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of the United States federal government which has examined randomized trials for ACT in the areas of psychosis, work site stress, and obsessive compulsive disorder, including depression outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=SAMHSA's National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices |url=http://nrepp.samhsa.gov/ViewIntervention.aspx?id=191 |accessdate=2011-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823110657/http://nrepp.samhsa.gov/ViewIntervention.aspx?id=191 |archivedate=2011-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the basic area, [[Relational Frame Theory]] is a research program in language and cognition that is considered part of contextual behavioral science, and is a focus of ACBS.&lt;ref&gt;Blackledge, J.T. (2003).

''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 3, 421–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the better known behavioral approach proposed by [[B.F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1887">{{Refimprove|date=February 2014}}'''Bandhu''' (1), [[Sanskrit]] for ''friend'' connected with ''bandhan'' or ''ties'' which are the connections that, according to the  [[Vedas]] link the outer and the inner worlds. [[Vedas|Vedic]] texts {{which|date=November 2011}} speak, for example, of the 360 bones of the fetus that fuse into the 206 bones of the adult (after the 360 days of the year). Recently, the word has been used in a Song of a Bollywood Feature Film " Cocktail ", Where a Man Calls a girl(Tum hi ho Bandhu)he likes and Rates her as an Angel from the outer world Connected to him. It is used commonly in ''Hindi'' in the sense of "brother".  Synonyms: "Hindi", it may mean ''bhai" as in "Twamecha Bandhu, sakha twameva", part of the Krishna stotra, where Lord Krishna is being referred to as "brother".  In ''Urdu'' it takes the meaning of ''bhai''.

[[Rajiv Malhotra]] in his book [[Being Different]] describes how 'Bandhuta/Bandhu' is an in-built feature of this universe. In the story&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-02-29/vintage-wisdom/30341831_1_devas-universe-vedas&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prajapati]] attempts to create the Universe keeping Order and Chaos in dynamic balance. His initial attempts fail because they're too 'Jami'/homogenous or too 'Prthak'/different. Finally he gets the combination just-right, by using the principle of 'Bandhuta'/'Bandhu' i.e. binding together dissimilar things by what is common across all things in the entire creation.

As per Dharma traditions 'Bandhuta' exists in all planes/fields connecting them together. Few noteworthy fields are 'Nrittya'/Dance, 'Sangeet'/Music, 'Jyotish'/Astrology, 'Vastu-Shastra', [[Yoga]], [[Ayurveda]]/Medicine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10536">The '''beheading of Bhausaheb Maruti Talekar''' by Pakistani soldiers and over two-dozen [[HuJI]] terrorists led by [[Ilyas Kashmiri]] happened in the [[Rajouri]] district of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[India]] on 27 February 2000. Talekar was an Indian soldier on guard duty at the Ashok Listening Post which is surrounded on three sides by Pakistani posts. His post was attacked under the cover of mortar and rocket fire from Pakistani troops in which all seven soldiers on duty from the [[Maratha Light Infantry|17 Maratha Light Infantry]] battalion were killed. Talekar was beheaded and his severed head was carried across the [[line of control]].

After the beheading of Talekar, allegations of other incidents of [[Decapitation|beheading]] by both countries have frequently been reported.

==Biography of Talekar==
Talekar was a resident of Kolgaon village in [[Ahmednagar district]], [[Maharashtra]], India. He was the son of daily laborers and had studied till the 10th grade before joining the army. He was unmarried and 24 years old at the time of his death. According to natives of his village, the family of Talekar did not knew that he was beheaded. The army declined the Talekar's sister request to see his face.&lt;ref name="TIE0902"/&gt; His last rites were performed at his village.&lt;ref name="TIE0902"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TIE09"/&gt;

===The inquiry against the commanding officer===
The commanding officer of the unit was [[Colonel]] Sandes. He had communicated to the superiors seeking permission to shift the Ashok listening post because of the possibility of a sneaking attack such as the one which happened on the 27 February 2000, but he was denied permission. He faced a court of inquiry after the incident which exonerated him, but his superiors had reported that colonel Sandes was unfit for commanding a unit. The colonel had to fight a legal battle to be eligible for promotion. Sandes was promoted to the rank of [[Brigadier]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="ToI02"/&gt;

===Talekar's memory===
The army took up the responsibility of the education of his sister after the incident. His family continues to receive a [[pension]] of {{INR}}10,000 per month. A sum of 12 lakh rupees was given to Talekar's family as compensation.&lt;ref name="TIE0902"/&gt;

In his memory, a community hall was built in his village. His sister is pursuing{{when|date=October 2016}} the hope to start a school for special children in his memory.&lt;ref name="TIE0902"/&gt;

===Similar incidents===
Since the torture and murder of [[Saurabh Kalia]] during the Kargil war in the custody of Pakistani troops; many allegations of mistreatment of soldiers by the other side have been reported from Kashmir. The beheading of Talekar happened one year after the [[Kargil war]] ended.

A '''caffè sospeso''' ({{IPA-it|kafˈfɛ ssoˈspeːso; -eːzo|pron}}; {{langnf||Italian|"suspended coffee"}}) or '''pending coffee''' is a cup of [[coffee]] paid for in advance as an anonymous act of [[Charity (practice)|charity]]. The tradition began in the working-class [[café|café]]s of [[Naples]], where someone who had experienced good luck would order a ''sospeso'', paying the price of two coffees but receiving and consuming only one. A poor person enquiring later whether there was a ''sospeso'' available would then be served a coffee for free.&lt;ref name="theage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sofiaecho"/&gt; Coffee shops in other countries have adopted the sospeso to increase sales, and to promote kindness and caring.

==History==

One 2010 account claims the tradition was over 100 years old, but declined during the [[History of the Italian Republic#The 1950s and 1960s: the Economic Boom|postwar economic boom]], so that it is mainly observed around Christmas time.&lt;ref name="scalzi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessitaly.com/post/italian-coffee-break-part-1-e28094-paying-it-forward-in-naples.aspx|title=Italian Coffee Break part 1 — Paying it Forward in Naples|last=Scalzi|first=Mario|date=7 April 2010|work=Access Italy|accessdate=2013-03-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331040125/http://www.accessitaly.com/post/italian-coffee-break-part-1-e28094-paying-it-forward-in-naples.aspx|archivedate=31 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 article reported the tradition was obsolescent, the reporter having visited three bars where it had not been observed for at least 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://corrieredelmezzogiorno.corriere.it/campania/a_tavola/articoli/2008/10_Ottobre/06/caff%C3%A8_sospeso.shtml|title=Caffè sospeso, tradizione "sospesa" a un filo Rischia di scomparire la tazzulella benefica|last=W.|first=R.|work=Corriere del Mezzogiorno Campania|publisher=[[Corriere della Sera]]|language=Italian|accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aurelio De Laurentiis]] is reported to pay for ten ''sospesi'' after each victory by [[S.S.C.

The ''sospeso'' gave the title to a 2008 journalism collection by Neapolitan [[Luciano De Crescenzo]], ''Il caffe sospeso: Saggezza quotidiana in piccoli sorsi'', which helped publicise the tradition throughout Italy.&lt;ref name="sofiaecho"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sofiaecho.com/2012/02/21/1770809_free-coffee-anyone|title=Free coffee, anyone?|last=Zhuk|first=Alyona|date=21 February 2012|work=The Sofia Echo|accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crescenzo2010"&gt;{{cite book|title=Il caffè sospeso|last=Crescenzo|first=Luciano De|date=2010-10-07|publisher=Edizioni Mondadori|isbn=9788852014161|language=Italian}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2013-03-28--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The idea has been reported in cafés in [[Bulgaria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/World/News/Bulgarian-cafes-get-an-Italian-twist-20130325|title=Bulgarian cafés get an Italian twist|author=[[Agence France-Presse]]|date=25 March 2013|publisher=News24|accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ukraine]],&lt;ref name="sofiaecho"/&gt; [[Australia]],&lt;ref name="theage"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/entertainment/epicure/espresso/2009/04/20/1240079594155.html|title=Espresso: Coffee goodness|last=Dubecki|first=Larissa|date=21 April 2009|work=[[The Age]]|accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/le-soleil/vivre-ici/societe/201304/11/01-4640087-un-premier-cafe-en-attente-a-quebec.php |title=Un premier "café en attente" à Québec &amp;#124; Claudette Samson &amp;#124; Société |publisher=Lapresse.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Romania]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.getlokal.ro/en/page/suspended-coffee-romania|date= |title=Suspended coffee in Romania|work=getlokal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.ruvr.ru/2012/01/07/63427265/|title=Coffee free of charge|last=Faustova|first=Milena|date=7 January 2012|work=Voice of Russia|accessdate=2013-03-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523041404/http://english.ruvr.ru/2012/01/07/63427265/#|archive-date=2013-05-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cafespendientes.es/ |title=Cafés Pendientes &amp;#124; ¿Te sumas a la iniciativa del Café Pendiente? #CafesPendientes |publisher=Cafespendientes.es |date=2013-11-07 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Argentina]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncafependiente.com.ar/ |title=Cafe Pendiente |publisher=Uncafependiente.com.ar |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/steve_duin/index.ssf/2013/05/steve_duin_portland_joins_susp.html |title=Portland joins suspended coffee movement |publisher=OregonLive.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Costa Rica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nacion.com/nacional/ticos-aprenden-regalar-Cafe-Pendiente_0_1350864923.html |title=Los ticos aprenden el arte de regalar café sin mirar a quién con el Café Pendiente |publisher=Nacion.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea received a revival in Italy in 2011 with several small Italian festivals forming a Suspended Coffee Network to encourage solidarity in response to cultural budget cuts,&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt; and a Dutch campaign at Christmas 2011 gave a discount on the price of the donated coffee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.at5.nl/artikelen/73480/caffe-sospeso-voor-inloophuizen|title=Caffè Sospeso voor inloophuizen -|date=21 December 2011|work=AT5 Echt Amsterdams Nieuws|language=Dutch|accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, Neapolitan authorities declared an annual "Suspended Coffee Day".&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt;

In March 2013, John Sweeney launched a Facebook page for "Suspended Coffees", which by 2015 had led to the purchase of over 15 million coffees in 34 countries.&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Razavi|first1=Lauren|title=Movement To Pay It Forward With A Cup Of Coffee Spills Into U.S.|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/12/17/460001377/movement-to-pay-it-forward-with-a-cup-of-coffee-spills-into-u-s|accessdate=13 April 2017|work=NPR.org|date=17 December 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK arm of coffee chain [[Starbucks]] signed up for a charity initiative based on the suspended coffee concept in April 2013, in which it said it would match the value of each suspended coffee with a cash donation to the [[Oasis Trust|Oasis charity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reynolds |first=John |url=http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/article/1177756/Starbucks-joins-Suspended-Coffee-homeless-initiative |title=Starbucks joins Suspended Coffee homeless initiative |publisher=Marketing Magazine |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of the trend in other coffee shops in the UK also received media coverage around the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22267613 |title=BBC News - Would you buy a 'suspended coffee' for someone in need? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-04-24 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 July 2013, a Tuesday, an anonymous customer in [[Edmonton|Edmonton, Alberta]], [[Canada]], [[North America]] paid for 500 large coffees at Canadian coffee chain [[Tim Hortons]]. This started a trend that spread to a total of 30 locations with over 10,000 cups of coffee being paid for by donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Davidson |first=Janet |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/are-we-hard-wired-to-buy-timmies-for-hundreds-of-strangers-1.1403205 |title=Are we hard-wired to buy Timmies for hundreds of strangers? |publisher=CBC |date=2013-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==

The ''caffè sospeso'' has been identified as a symbol of grassroots social solidarity, prompting its revival in response to the [[Great Recession|2008 recession]] and [[European sovereign-debt crisis|ensuing eurozone crisis]].&lt;ref name="scalzi" /&gt; In 2004, a ''giornata nazionale del sospeso'' at Easter was announced by the ''Ronde della carità'' charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nove.firenze.it/vediarticolo.asp?id=a4.04.12.08.29|title=Oggi giornata nazionale del caffé "sospeso"|date=12 April 2004|work=Nove da Firenze|language=Italian|accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, a ''Giornata del Caffè Sospeso'' was scheduled to coincide with [[Human Rights Day]] in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemaitaliano.info/news/10505/la-voce-del-corpo-di-luca-vullo-in-tour.html|title=La Voce del Corpo di Luca Vullo in tour|date=29 November 2011|work=CinemaItaliano.info|language=Italian|accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collection of Italian arts festivals emphasising social solidarity in 2010 came together under the umbrella "Rete del Caffè Sospeso".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retedelcaffesospeso.com/principi/|title=Principi|publisher=Rete del Caffè Sospeso|language=Italian|accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Italian fundraising website started by Luca Argentero is called 1caffe.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1caffe.org/|title=1 Caffè|language=Italian|accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.greenews.info/rubriche/una-iena-piu-verde-che-nera-intervista-a-luca-argentero-20111223/|title=Una Iena più verde che nera.

'''Case Solvers''' is a company founded in September 2012 and run by young Hungarian professionals{{Who|date=March 2018}}. Case Solvers' mission is to train young [[problem solver]]s, and to create a platform between graduates and the actors of the labor market. The organization was called Hungarian Business Case Society until 2013, then it gradually took up the name 'Case Solvers'. The team of 35 young Hungarians held more than 250 trainings to talented university students in 27 countries by 2017.

== History ==
Case Solvers was founded as Hungarian Business Case Society in September 2012 by Zsolt Ábrahám, Gergely Balázs and István Juhász.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forbes.hu/extra/forbes30/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the organization functioned as a blog where professional articles about case solving were published continually. The page, case-study.hu aimed to spread case solving as a teaching method among Hungarian and international business students as well.

Case Solvers (then known as HBCS) held its first training at the College of Management ([[Hungary]]) in March 2013, which was soon followed by several case interview trainings. The team organized its first case study camp, the Case Camp in August 2013. Within a year, Case Solvers held training courses in its home country's most prestigious business universities and prepared top teams for national and international case study competitions.

HBCS held its first training course as Case Solvers in November 2013, in India. The first training was soon followed by another in Romania, then in the Netherlands. By 2017, Case Solvers held more than 250 trainings in 27 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://24.hu/fn/uzleti-tippek/2017/04/29/case-solvers-a-fiatal-magyar-ceg-amely-evente-duplazza-a-beveteleit-vilagszerte/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trainings ==
One of the main activities of Case Solvers is training business students in case solving. There are two main groups of trainings: Case Solving Training and Case Interview Training.

=== Case-solving training ===
Conventional case solving training, where problem solving, structured thinking and logical deduction are the obtainable skills. The case solver's task is to give a solution for an ill-structured, complex business problem, that they also need to present in front of a professional jury. Case Solvers hold trainings in several formats: from one afternoon they can even last a whole weekend. The amount and complexity of the material taught on trainings depend on the length of the training. Case Solvers often prepares teams for specific case competitions, both national and international ones.

=== Case-interview training ===
Corporations, multinationals and consulting firms are likely to choose between candidates based on case interviews. The point is that job candidates must find a solution to a problem during the interview. This is usually a real problem that the interviewer has already faced in the company. The case interviews are perfect for assessing the candidate's abilities. At certain companies, this is a key point in the recruitment process, therefore careful preparation is required from the applicant.

Case interview trainings by Case Solvers prepare for situations like this: students can learn the methods of case interviewing by professionals, who have already undergone similar situations and who are currently working in the most prestigious consulting firms or multinational companies themselves. Case Interview Training – similar to Case Solving – could last from just a half-day up to an entire weekend as well. The amount and complexity of the material taught depends on the length of the training.

=== Investment-banking training ===
IB Day is about revealing the mystery of investment banks by showing training participants what they actually do, and how their recruitment and hiring processes work.

== Case competitions ==
In addition to preparing teams for national and international case competitions, Case Solvers also organizes its own competitions.

=== Case Solver of the Year ranking and competition&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://evesetoldoja.hu/|title=Az év esetoldója|last=Solvers|first=Case|website=evesetoldoja.hu|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
The Case Solver of The Year Ranking (founded in 2013) aims to differentiate the case study competitions in Hungary and to make the competitor's performance measurable. The ranking is proposed to present the most successful competitors of the given year to the public, who are among Hungary's best case solvers based on their performance in case study competitions. The most prestigious case competitions of the academic year are the ones that matter in the Ranking.

Case Solver of the Year, the final competition organized by Case Solvers and Vialto Consulting is an invitational competition.  The event aims to create a platform for the country's top case solvers where they can challenge themselves against the other outstanding students from the Case Solver of The Year Ranking. The contestant with the highest score gets a trophy for being the Case Solver of The Year.

Former case studies of the Case Solver of The Year Competition:

'''2014: Gránit Bank'''

'''2015: Budapesti Közlekedési Központ (Centre for Budapest Transport)'''

'''2016: Hungarian Telekom'''

'''2017: ENKSZ'''

=== Solvers’ Cup&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://solverscup.com/|title=What they said about Solvers' Cup 2016 – Solvers' Cup|website=Solvers' Cup|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Solvers' Cup is Hungary's unique international case competition both as an invitational and online competition, which was first organized in 2016. The invitational part of Solvers' Cup, which included teams from Europe's top universities was held in Budapest, at the Corvinus University. Competitors were representatives of Consulting Clubs from for example Oxford and St. Gallen, as well as Czech, Austrian and Hungarian teams, among others. During the three-day event, participants had to provide a solution to a complex business problem followed by two rounds of presentations in front of the professional jury. Among the jury members we could find the dean of the Corvinus University and representatives of Loxon Solutions, DHL Consulting, Roland Berger, PwC, Philip Morris and Ringier Axel Springer.

Case Solvers created an online surface to give an opportunity for case solvers all over the world to join the contest. The 130 registered students had the same task as the invited competitors, but the case solving time was only 10 hours long for them. The online competition gave a chance to participate and to experience dynamic thinking and quick decision-making given the short deadline to all those who did not have the opportunity to compete personally in Budapest. Considering the first year's success, Case Solvers intents to organize Solvers' Cup every year from now on.

== Research ==
Case Solvers continuously publishes international research related to case solving and the expectations of the young generation at work. The research is aimed to inform the key actors of the labor market and to transfer their accumulated international knowledge.

=== Career ambitions report ===
Case Solvers' team first published an English report – Career Ambitions Report – on career expectations of the young entrants of the labor market in March 2016. The survey is made up of three modules:

1.      How students collect information

2.      How students evaluate information

3.      The key aspects of the students’ decision-making process

The 2015 survey reflects the opinion of the youth interested in management consulting from six countries (Hungary, Romania, Switzerland, the Netherlands, India and Ukraine), while the report of 2016 was enlarged by university students of three other countries: Brazil, Argentina and the South African Republic.

=== Case study report&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://case-study.hu/hu/csapat/esetversenyek-riport-2016|title=Esetversenyek riport 2016|date=22 November 2016|work=CASE STUDY|access-date=2017-12-23|language=hu-HU}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Case competitions play every year more important role in the life of business students. The good results achieved in these competitions become an advantage when it comes to finding a job, especially in the consulting area. Case Solvers' research covers the current situation of the Hungarian case competitions, as well as the motivations and opinion of the participants.

The survey was based on interviews and questionnaires, overall it summarizes the opinion of more than a hundred university students. The main conclusions are the following: every year there are a significant increase in the number of case competitions in Hungary, and the main motivation of the competitors is to gain professional experience.

== Corporate social responsibility ==
Case Solvers placed great emphasis on the development of the Hungarian youth from the beginning. In December 2013, they co-founded the National Secondary School Problem Solving Contest (Országos Középiskolai Problémamegoldó Verseny) with Mathias Corvinus Collegium, and they launched the “Where to continue my studies?” (Hol tanuljak tovább?, HTT) initiative in November 2014. To support these projects, Problema Solvenda Foundation was established in January 2016 with the purpose of educating Hungarian high school students.

=== HTT program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://holtanuljaktovabb.hu/|title=Hol Tanuljak Tovább? {{!}} Amit minden diáknak érdemes elolvasnia|website=holtanuljaktovabb.hu|language=hu|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
HTT is a non-profit project of Case Solvers that helps secondary school students make thoughtful decisions about their further studies. On the program's website, people with different fields of education and profession talk about their every day working lives, bringing it closer to graduating students.

OKPV is a program for high school students that gives them an insight into the world of the future academic case competitions. The task is problem solving of course, but the participants have to take on a historical figure’s character and make decisions with their minds. OKPV in 2017 is now the fourth competition in a row – in cooperation with Mathias Corvinus Collegium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/kultura/20150305_mai_gimisek_lebeszeltek_Tisza_Istvan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to the Problema Solvenda&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://problemasolvenda.com/|title=ProblemaSolvenda {{!}} LandingPage|website=problemasolvenda.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foundation, the competition is now held in Slovenia, Romania and Ukraine as well.

{{Political anthropology|expanded=Basic concepts}}

'''Caste''' is a form of [[social stratification]] characterized by [[endogamy]], hereditary transmission of a lifestyle which often includes an occupation, status in a hierarchy, customary social interaction, and exclusion.{{Sfn|Scott|Marshall|2005|p=66}}{{Sfn|Winthrop|1991|pp=27–30}} It is an extreme evolution of a system of legally-entrenched social classes, also endogamous and hereditary, such as that of feudal Europe.  Although caste systems exist in various regions, its paradigmatic ethnographic example is the division of Indian society into rigid social groups, with roots in India's ancient history and persisting until today;{{Sfn|Béteille|2002|p=66}} it is sometimes used as an analogical basis for the study of caste-like social divisions existing outside India.  In biology, the term is applied to role stratification in [[eusocial]] animals like ants and termites, though the analogy is imperfect as these also involve extremely stratified [[queen ant|reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Wilson |first= E. O. |year= 1979 |title= The Evolution of Caste Systems in Social Insects |journal= Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |volume= 123 |number=4 |pages= 204–210 |jstor= 986579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The origins of the term 'caste' are attributed to the Spanish and Portuguese ''[[casta]]'', which, according to the [[John Minsheu]]'s Spanish dictionary (1599), means "race, lineage, or breed".&lt;ref name=oed-caste&gt;{{Cite OED|caste|id=28546}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the Spanish colonized the [[New World]], they used the word to mean a "clan or lineage". It was, however, the Portuguese who first employed ''casta'' in the primary modern sense of the English word ‘caste’ when they applied it to the thousands of endogamous, hereditary Indian social groups they encountered upon their arrival in India in 1498&lt;ref name=oed-caste/&gt;&lt;ref name=pitt-rivers&gt;{{citation|last=Pitt-Rivers|first=Julian|editor=T O Beidelman|title=The translation of culture essays to E.E.

The use of the spelling "caste", with this latter meaning, is first attested in English in 1613.&lt;ref name=oed-caste/&gt;

{{Main|Caste system in India}}
{{commons category|Castes in India}}
Modern India's caste system is based on the social groupings called ''[[jāti]]'' and the  theoretical ''[[varna (Hinduism)|varna]]''. The system of ''varnas'' appears in Hindu texts dating back to 1000 BCE and envisages the society divided into four classes: [[Brahmins]] (scholars and priests), [[Kshatriya]]s (warriors and nobles), [[Vaishyas]] (farmers, merchants, and artisans) and [[Shudras]] (laborers/service providers). The texts do not mention any separate, untouchable category in ''[[varna (Hinduism)|varna]]'' classification. Scholars believe that the system of ''varnas'' was a theoretical classification envisioned by the Brahmins, but never truly operational in society. The practical division of the society had always been in terms of ''jātis'' (birth groups), which are not based on any specific principle, but could vary from ethnic origins to occupations. The ''jātis'' have been endogamous groups without any fixed hierarchy but subject to vague notions of rank articulated over time based on lifestyle and social, political or economic status. In many instances, as in Bengal, historically the kings and rulers had been called upon, when required, to mediate on the ranks of ''jātis'', which might number in thousands all over the subcontinent and vary by region. In practice, the ''jātis'' may or may not fit into the ''varna'' classes and many prominent ''jatis'', for example the Jats and Yadavs, straddled two varnas i.e. Kshatriyas and Vaishyas, and the ''varna'' status of ''jātis'' itself was subject to articulation over time.

Starting with the British colonial Census of 1901 led by [[Herbert Hope Risley]], all the ''jātis'' were grouped under the theoretical ''varnas'' categories.&lt;ref name=dirks&gt;{{cite book|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7191.html|author=Nicholas B. Dirks|title=Castes of Mind: Colonialism and the Making of New India|year=2001|isbn=978-0-691-08895-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to political scientist [[Lloyd Rudolph]], Risley believed that ''varna'', however ancient, could be applied to all the modern castes found in India, and "[he] meant to identify and place several hundred million Indians within it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3vnsnma5nW4C |title=The Modernity of Tradition: Political Development in India |first=Lloyd I. |last=Rudolph |authorlink=Lloyd I. Rudolph |others=[[Susanne Hoeber Rudolph|Rudolph, Susanne Hoeber]] |year=1984 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |pages=116–117 |isbn=0-226-73137-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''varna'' (conceptual classification based on occupation) and ''jāti'' (groups) are two distinct concepts: while ''varna'' is the idealised four-part division envisaged by the [[Dvija|Twice-Borns]], ''jāti'' (community) refers to the thousands of actual endogamous groups prevalent across the subcontinent. The classical authors scarcely speak of anything other than the ''varnas'', as it provided a convenient shorthand; but a problem arises when even Indologists sometimes confuse the two.&lt;ref name="Chicago"&gt;{{citation |author=Dumont, Louis |title=Homo hierarchicus: the caste system and its implications |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1980 |pages=66–67 |isbn=0-226-16963-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon independence from Britain, the Indian Constitution listed 1,108 castes across the country as Scheduled Castes in 1950, for positive discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/ld/subord/rule3a.htm |title=The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order 1950 |publisher=Lawmin.nic.in |date= |access-date=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Untouchable communities are sometimes called ''[[Scheduled Castes]]'', ''[[Dalit]]'' or ''[[Harijan]]'' in contemporary literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scaling Caste Walls With Capitalism’s Ladders in India|publisher=The New York Times|author=Lydia Polgreen|date=21 December 2011|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/22/world/asia/indias-boom-creates-openings-for-untouchables.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Dalits were 16.2% of India's population.&lt;ref name=censtat01&gt;{{cite web|title=Scheduled castes and scheduled tribes population: Census 2001|year=2004|publisher=Government of India|url=http://censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/India_at_glance/scst.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the 15 million bonded child workers are from the lowest castes.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.unicef.org/pon95/chil0016.html Children pay high price for cheap labour]".

The socio-economic limitations of the caste system are reduced due to urbanization and [[affirmative action]]. Nevertheless, the caste system still exists in [[endogamy]] and [[Family patrimony|patrimony]], and thrives in the politics of democracy, where caste provides ready made constituencies to politicians. The globalization and economic opportunities from foreign businesses has influenced the growth of India's middle-class population. Some members of the Chhattisgarh Potter Caste Community (CPCC) are middle-class urban professionals and no longer potters unlike the remaining majority of traditional rural potter members. The co-existence of the middle-class and traditional members in the CPCC has created [[intersectionality]] between caste and class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Natrajan|first1=Balmurli|title=Caste, class, and community in india: An ethnographic approach|journal=Ethnology|date=2005|volume=4|issue=3|pages=227–241}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is persistence of caste in Indian politics. Caste associations have evolved into caste-based political parties. Political parties and the state perceive caste as an important factor for mobilization of people and policy development. It is not politics that gets caste-ridden; it is caste that gets politicized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sen|first1=Ronojoy.|title=The persistence of caste in indian politics|journal=Pacific Affairs|date=2012|volume=85|issue=2|pages=363–369|doi=10.5509/2012852363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies by Bhatt and Beteille have shown changes in status, openness, mobility in the social aspects of Indian society. As a result of the modern social pressures on the country, India is experiencing a change in their social sphere dynamic as well as economically in the caste system. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gandhi|first1=Rag S.|title=FROM CASTE TO CLASS IN INDIAN SOCIETY|journal=Humboldt Journal of Social Relations|date=1980|volume=7|issue=2|pages=1-14|}} &lt;/ref&gt; While arranged marriages are still the most common practice in India, the internet has helped the younger generation of Indians to have more control over their marriages through the use of dating apps. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Gandhi|first1=Divya.|title= Running in the family|magazine=The Hindu|date=April 2, 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt; Hypergamy is still a common practice in India and Hindu culture. Men can marry a lower caste or a woman of an equal one. If the girl marries up, then her children will take the status of their father. If the girl marries down, her entire family is reduced to the social status of their son in law. Geographical factors also determine the loosening of the caste system. Many Northern villages are more likely to experience exogamous marriages, due to a lack of people within the same caste. Women in North India have been found to be less likely to leave or divorce their husbands since they are of a relatively lower caste system, and have higher restrictions on their freedoms. On the other hand, Pahari women have much more freedom to leave their husbands without stigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Berreman|first1=Gerald D.|title=Village Exogamy in Northernmost India|date=1962|volume=18|issue=1|pages=55-58|}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Nepal===
{{Main|Caste system in Nepal}}
The [[Nepal]]ese caste system resembles that of the Indian ''jāti'' system with numerous ''jāti'' divisions with a ''varna'' system superimposed for a rough equivalence. But since the culture and the society is different some of the things are different. Inscriptions attest the beginnings of a caste system during the [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Licchavi]] period.  Jayasthiti Malla (1382–1395) categorized Newars into 64 castes (Gellner 2001). A similar exercise was made during the reign of Mahindra Malla (1506–1575). The Hindu social code was later set up in Gorkha by Ram Shah (1603–1636).

Ancient Sri Lankan texts such as the Pujavaliya, Sadharmaratnavaliya and Yogaratnakaraya and inscriptional evidence show that the above hierarchy prevailed throughout the feudal period. The repetition of the same caste hierarchy even as recently as the 18th century, in the British/Kandyan period Kadayimpoth – Boundary books as well, indicates the continuation of the tradition right up to the end of Sri Lanka's monarchy.

[[Bali]]nese caste structure has been described in early 20th-century European literature to be based on three categories – triwangsa (thrice born) or the nobility, ''dwijāti'' (twice born) in contrast to ''ekajāti'' (once born) the low folks. Four statuses were identified in these sociological studies, spelled a bit differently from the caste categories for India:&lt;ref name=boon&gt;{{cite book|title=The Anthropological Romance of Bali 1597-1972: Dynamic Perspectives in Marriage and Caste, Politics and Religion|author=James Boon|year=1977|isbn=0-521-21398-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Brahmin]]as – [[priest]]
*Satrias – [[knight]]hood
*Wesias – commerce
*Sudras – servitude

The Brahmana caste was further subdivided by these Dutch ethnographers into two: Siwa and Buda. The Siwa caste was subdivided into five: Kemenuh, Keniten, Mas, Manuba and Petapan. This classification was to accommodate the observed marriage between higher-caste Brahmana men with lower-caste women. The other castes were similarly further sub-classified by these 19th-century and early-20th-century ethnographers based on numerous criteria ranging from profession, endogamy or exogamy or polygamy, and a host of other factors in a manner similar to ''castas'' in Spanish colonies such as Mexico, and caste system studies in British colonies such as India.&lt;ref name=boon/&gt;

During the period of [[Yuan Dynasty]], ruler [[Kublai Khan]] enforced a ''Four Class System'', which was a legal caste system. The order of four classes of people was maintained by the information of the descending order were:-
* [[Mongols|Mongolian]]
* [[Semu]] people
* [[Han Chinese|Han]] people (in the northern areas of China)
* Southerners (people of the former Southern [[Song dynasty]])

There is also significant controversy over the [[social classes of Tibet]], especially with regards to the [[serfdom in Tibet controversy]].

===Japan===
{{Main|Edo society}}
[[File:Samurai and servant.jpg|thumb|Japanese [[samurai]] of importance and servant.]]

In Japan's history, social strata based on inherited position rather than personal merit, were rigid and highly formalized in a system called ''mibunsei'' (身分制). At the top were the Emperor and Court nobles ([[kuge]]), together with the Shōgun and daimyō. Below them, the population was divided into [[Four occupations|four classes]]: [[samurai]], peasants, craftsmen and merchants. Only samurai were allowed to bear arms. A samurai had a right to kill any peasants, craftsman or merchant who he felt were disrespectful. Merchants were the lowest caste because they did not produce any products. The castes were further sub-divided; for example, peasants were labelled as ''furiuri'', ''tanagari'', ''mizunomi-byakusho'' among others. As in Europe, the castes and sub-classes were of the same race, religion and culture.

Howell, in his review of [[Japan]]ese society notes that if a Western power had colonized Japan in the 19th century, they would have discovered and imposed a rigid four-caste hierarchy in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geographies of identity in nineteenth-century Japan|author=David L. Howell|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-24085-5|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Vos and Wagatsuma observe that Japanese society had a systematic and extensive caste system. They discuss how alleged caste impurity and alleged racial inferiority, concepts often  assumed to be different, are superficial terms, and are due to identical inner psychological processes, which expressed themselves in Japan and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=gdvhw&gt;{{cite book|title=Japan's invisible race: caste in culture and personality|author=George De Vos and Hiroshi Wagatsuma|publisher=University of California Press|year=1966|isbn=978-0-520-00306-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Endogamy was common because marriage across caste lines was socially unacceptable.&lt;ref name=gdvhw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Japanese Fashion: A Cultural History|author=Toby Slade|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84788-252-3|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Japan]] had its own untouchable caste, shunned and ostracized, historically referred to by the insulting term ''Eta'', now called ''[[Burakumin]]''. While modern law has officially abolished the class hierarchy, there are reports of discrimination against the [[Buraku]] or [[Burakumin]] underclasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrdc.net/sahrdc/hrfeatures/HRF39.htm |title=Class, Ethnicity and Nationality: Japan Finds Plenty of Space for Discrimination |publisher=Hrdc.net |date=2001-06-18 |accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Burakumin are regarded as "ostracised".&lt;ref&gt;

===Korea===
{{Korean caste system}}
[[File:Korea-History-Goban Game in Seoul Korea 1904 (LOC).jpg|thumbnail|A typical Yangban family scene from 1904.  The Yoon family had an enduring presence in Korean politics from the 1800s until the 1970s.]]

The [[baekjeong]] (백정) were an "untouchable" outcaste of Korea. The meaning today is that of butcher. It originates in the [[Goryeo-Khitan Wars|Khitan invasion of Korea]] in the 11th century. The defeated [[Khitans]] who surrendered were settled in isolated communities throughout Goryeo to forestall rebellion.  They were valued for their skills in hunting, herding, butchering, and making of leather, common skill sets among nomads.  Over time, their ethnic origin was forgotten, and they formed the bottom layer of Korean society.

In 1392, with the foundation of the Confucian [[Joseon dynasty]], Korea systemised its own native class system. At the top were the two official classes, the [[Yangban]], which literally means "two classes". It was composed of scholars (''munban'') and warriors (''muban''). Scholars had a significant social advantage over the warriors. Below were the ''jung-in'' (중인-中人: literally "middle people". This was a small class of specialized professions such as medicine, accounting, translators, regional bureaucrats, etc. Below that were the ''sangmin'' (상민-常民: literally 'commoner'), farmers working their own fields. Korea also had a [[serf]] population known as the ''nobi''. The nobi population could fluctuate up to about one third of the population, but on average the nobi made up about 10% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Junius P.|title=The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780874368857|page=392|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ATq5_6h2AT0C&amp;pg=RA1-PA392&amp;dq=%2210+percent+of+the+total+population+on+average,+but+it+could+rise+up+to+one-third+of+the+total%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%2210%20percent%20of%20the%20total%20population%20on%20average%2C%20but%20it%20could%20rise%20up%20to%20one-third%20of%20the%20total%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 February 2017|language=en|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1801, the vast majority of government nobi were emancipated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Youngmin|last2=Pettid|first2=Michael J.|title=Women and Confucianism in Choson Korea: New Perspectives|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9781438437774|page=141|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UwgUa6WWFBMC&amp;pg=PA141#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 February 2017|language=en|date=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1858 the nobi population stood at about 1.5% of the total population of Korea.&lt;ref name="nobi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Gwyn|title=Structure of Slavery in Indian Ocean Africa and Asia|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135759179|page=163|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J0iRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA163#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 February 2017|language=en|date=2004-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hereditary nobi system was officially abolished around 1886–87 and the rest of the nobi system was abolished with the [[Gabo Reform]] of 1894,&lt;ref name="nobi" /&gt; but traces remained until 1930.

The opening of Korea to foreign Christian missionary activity in the late 19th century saw some improvement in the status of the ''baekjeong''. However, everyone was not equal under the Christian congregation, and even so protests erupted when missionaries tried to integrate ''baekjeong'' into worship, with non-''baekjeong'' finding this attempt insensitive to traditional notions of hierarchical advantage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Around the same time, the ''baekjeong'' began to resist open social discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=In Search of Human Rights: The Paekchŏng Movement in Colonial Korea|title=Colonial Modernity in Korea|first=Joong-Seop|last=Kim|editor=Gi-Wook Shin and Michael Robinson|year=1999|pages=326|isbn=0-674-00594-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; They focused on social and economic injustices affecting them, hoping to create an [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] Korean society. Their efforts included attacking social discrimination by upper class, authorities, and "commoners", and the use of degrading language against children in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Korean Paekjŏng under Japanese rule: the quest for equality and human rights|first=Joong-Seop|last=Kim|year=2003|pages=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Gabo reform]] of 1896, the class system of Korea was officially abolished. Following the collapse of the [[Enlightenment Party|Gabo government]], the new cabinet, which became the Gwangmu government after the establishment of the Korean Empire, introduced systematic measures for abolishing the traditional class system. One measure was the new household registration system, reflecting the goals of formal [[social equality]], which was implemented by the loyalists' cabinet. Whereas the old registration system signified household members according to their hierarchical social status, the new system called for an occupation.&lt;ref name="proper"&gt;Hwang, Kyung Moon (2004), University of Southern California. ''Citizenship, Social Equality and Government Reform: Changes in the Household Registration System in Korea, 1894–1910''&lt;/ref&gt;

While most Koreans by then had surnames and even [[bongwan]], although still substantial number of [[cheonmin]], mostly consisted of [[serfs]] and slaves, and [[Untouchability|untouchables]] did not. According to the new system, they were then required to fill in the blanks for surname in order to be registered as constituting separate households. Instead of creating their own family name, some cheonmins appropriated their masters' surname, while others simply took the most common surname and its bongwan in the local area. Along with this example, activists within and outside the Korean government had based their visions of a new relationship between the government and people through the concept of citizenship, employing the term ''inmin'' ("people") and later, ''kungmin'' ("citizen").&lt;ref name="proper"/&gt;

====North Korea====
{{Main|Songbun}}

The [[Committee for Human Rights in North Korea]] reported that "Every North Korean citizen is assigned a heredity-based class and socio-political rank over which the individual exercises no control but which determines all aspects of his or her life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=06 Jun 2012 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/9313174/North-Korea-caste-system-underpins-human-rights-abuses.html |title=North Korea caste system 'underpins human rights abuses' |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2012-06-06 |accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarded as ''Songbun'', [[Barbara Demick]] describes this "class structure" as an updating of the hereditary "caste system", combining Confucianism and Stalinism.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Demick, ''Nothing to Envy: Love, Life and Death in North Korea'', Fourth Estate, London, 2010, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; She claims that a bad family background is called "tainted blood", and that by law this "tainted blood" lasts for three generations.&lt;ref&gt;Demick, pp. 28, 197, 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tibet===
{{See also|Social classes of Tibet}}

Heidi Fjeld has put forth the argument that pre-1950s Tibetan society was functionally a caste system, in contrast to previous scholars who defined the Tibetan social class system as similar to European feudal serfdom, as well as non-scholarly western accounts which seek to romanticize a supposedly 'egalitarian' ancient Tibetan society.

In other cases, such as the ''Nupe'' of Nigeria, the ''Beni Amer'' of East Africa, and the ''Tira'' of Sudan, the exclusionary principle has been driven by evolving social factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Caste and government in primitive society|author=SF Nadel|journal=Journal of Anthropological Society|volume=8|pages=9–22|year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Africa===
[[File:GriotFête.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A [[Griot]], who have been described as an endogamous caste of West Africa who specialize in oral story telling and culture preservation. They have been also referred to as the bard caste.]]
Among the Igbo of [[Nigeria]] – especially [[Enugu State|Enugu]], [[Anambra State|Anambra]], [[Imo State|Imo]], [[Abia State|Abia]], [[Ebonyi State|Ebonyi]], [[Edo State|Edo]] and [[Delta state|Delta]] states of the country – Obinna finds Osu caste system has been and continues to be a major social issue. The Osu caste is determined by one's birth into a particular family irrespective of the religion practised by the individual. Once born into Osu caste, this Nigerian person is an outcast, shunned and ostracized, with limited opportunities or acceptance, regardless of his or her ability or merit. Obinna discusses how this caste system-related identity and power is deployed within government, Church and indigenous communities.&lt;ref name=Obinna1/&gt;

The ''osu'' class systems of eastern [[Nigeria]] and southern [[Cameroon]] are derived from indigenous religious beliefs and discriminate against the "Osus" people as "owned by deities" and outcasts.

The Songhai economy was based on a caste system. The most common were metalworkers, fishermen, and carpenters. Lower caste participants consisted of mostly non-farm working immigrants, who at times were provided special privileges and held high positions in society. At the top were noblemen and direct descendants of the original Songhai people, followed by freemen and traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africankingdoms.com|title=AFRICAN KINGDOMS - Kingdoms of Ancient African History|website=www.africankingdoms.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of social stratification systems in Africa, Richter reports that the term caste has been used by French and American scholars to many groups of West African artisans. These groups have been described as inferior, deprived of all political power, have a specific occupation, are hereditary and sometimes despised by others. Richter illustrates caste system in [[Ivory Coast]], with six sub-caste categories. Unlike other parts of the world, mobility is sometimes possible within sub-castes, but not across caste lines. Farmers and artisans have been, claims Richter, distinct castes. Certain sub-castes are shunned more than others. For example, exogamy is rare for women born into families of woodcarvers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Further considerations of caste in West Africa: The Senufo|author=Dolores Richter|journal=Africa|date= January 1980|volume=50|pages=37–54|doi=10.2307/1158641|jstor=1158641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the [[Mandé peoples|Mandé]] societies in [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Liberia]], [[Senegal]] and [[Sierra Leone]] have social stratification systems that divide society by ethnic ties. The Mande class system regards the ''jonow'' slaves as inferior. Similarly, the [[Wolof people|Wolof]] in Senegal is divided into three main groups, the ''geer'' (freeborn/nobles), ''jaam'' (slaves and slave descendants) and the underclass ''neeno''. In various parts of West Africa, [[Fula people|Fulani]] societies also have class divisions. Other castes include ''Griots'', ''Forgerons'', and ''Cordonniers''.

Tamari has described endogamous castes of over fifteen West African peoples, including the Tukulor, Songhay, Dogon, Senufo, Minianka, Moors, Manding, Soninke, Wolof, Serer, Fulani, and Tuareg. Castes appeared among the ''Malinke'' people no later than 14th century, and was present among the ''Wolof'' and ''Soninke'', as well as some ''Songhay'' and ''Fulani'' populations, no later than 16th century. Tamari claims that wars, such as the ''Sosso-Malinke'' war described in the ''Sunjata'' epic, led to the formation of blacksmith and bard castes among the people that ultimately became the Mali empire.

As West Africa evolved over time, sub-castes emerged that acquired secondary specializations or changed occupations. Endogamy was prevalent within a caste or among a limited number of castes, yet castes did not form demographic isolates according to Tamari. Social status according to caste was inherited by off-springs automatically; but this inheritance was paternal. That is, children of higher caste men and lower caste or slave concubines would have the caste status of the father.&lt;ref name=tamari1&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1991|volume=32|issue=2|pages=221–250|doi=10.1017/S0021853700025718|title=The Development of Caste Systems in West Africa|author=Tal Tamari}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Africa===
Ethel M. Albert in 1960 claimed that the societies in [[Central Africa]] were caste-like social stratification systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Socio-Political Organization and Receptivity to Change: Some Differences between Ruanda and Urundi|author=Ethel M. Albert|journal=Southwestern Journal of Anthropology|volume=16|number= 1|date= Spring 1960|pages=46–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in 1961, Maquet notes that the society in [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]] can be best described as castes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Premise of Inequality in Ruanda: A Study of Political Relations in a Central African Kingdom|author= Jacques J.

In a review published in 1977, Todd reports that numerous scholars report a system of social stratification in different parts of Africa that resembles some or all aspects of caste system. Examples of such caste systems, he claims, are to be found in Ethiopia in communities such as the [[Gurage people|Gurage]] and [[Konso people|Konso]]. He then presents the Dime of Southwestern Ethiopia, amongst whom there operates a system which Todd claims can be unequivocally labelled as caste system. The Dime have seven castes whose size varies considerably. Each broad caste level is a hierarchical order that is based on notions of purity, non-purity and impurity. It uses the concepts of defilement to limit contacts between caste categories and to preserve the purity of the upper castes. These caste categories have been exclusionary, endogamous and the social identity inherited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=LA CASTE EN AFRIQUE? (Caste in Africa?)|author=D. M.

Among the [[Kingdom of Kafa|Kafa]], there were also traditionally groups labeled as castes. "Based on research done before the Derg regime, these studies generally presume the existence of a social hierarchy similar to the caste system. At the top of this hierarchy were the Kafa, followed by occupational groups including blacksmiths (Qemmo), weavers (Shammano), bards (Shatto), potters, and tanners (Manno). In this hierarchy, the Manjo were commonly referred to as hunters, given the lowest status equal only to slaves."&lt;ref&gt;p. 299. Sayuri Yoshida. "Why did the Manjo convert to Protestant?

The [[Borana Oromo]] of southern [[Ethiopia]] in the [[Horn of Africa]] also have a class system, wherein the Wata, an acculturated hunter-gatherer group, represent the lowest class. Though the Wata today speak the [[Oromo language]], they have traditions of having previously spoken another language before adopting Oromo.&lt;ref name="Westermann"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diedrich Westermann|first=Edwin William Smith, Cyril Daryll Forde|title=Africa|year=1981|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==

===Basque country===
For centuries, through the modern times, the majority regarded [[Cagot]]s who lived primarily in the Basque region of France and Spain as an inferior caste, the untouchables. While they had the same skin color and religion as the majority, in the churches they had to use segregated doors, drink from segregated fonts, and receive communion on the end of long wooden spoons. It was a closed social system. The socially isolated Cagots were endogamous, and chances of social mobility non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The last untouchable in Europe|author=Sean Thomas|date=28 July 2008|publisher=The Independent, United Kingdom|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-last-untouchable-in-europe-878705.html|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansson1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anders Hansson|title=Chinese Outcasts: Discrimination and Emancipation in Late Imperial China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Ibp1RTW0AoC&amp;pg=PA15|year=1996|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-10596-6|pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In July 2013, the UK government announced its intention to amend the [[Equality Act 2010]] to "introduce legislation on caste, including any necessary exceptions to the caste provisions, within the framework of domestic discrimination law".&lt;ref&gt;Government Equalities Office, [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/225658/130726-Caste-Discrimination.pdf Caste legislation introduction – programme and timetable], accessed 2 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Section 9(5) of the Equality Act 2010 provides that "a [[Minister (government)|Minister]] may by [[Statutory order|order]] amend the statutory definition of race to include caste and may provide for exceptions in the Act to apply or not to apply to caste".

From September 2013 to February 2014, [[Meena Dhanda]] led a project on "Caste in Britain" for the UK [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] (EHRC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/publication-download/research-report-91-caste-britain-socio-legal-review|title=Research report 91: Caste in Britain: Socio-legal Review {{!}} Equality and Human Rights Commission|website=www.equalityhumanrights.com|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

According to Gerald D. Berreman, in the two systems, there are rigid rules of avoidance and certain types of contacts are defined as contaminating. In India, there are complex religious features which make up the system, whereas in the United States race and color are the basis of differentiation. The caste system in India and in the United States has higher groups which desire to retain their position for themselves and thus perpetuate the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berreman|first=Gerald|date=September 1960|title=Caste in India and the United States|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2773155?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=66|pages=120-127|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the increased immigration to the United States, many Indian Americans have created a similar system. A survey commissioned by Equality Labs finds that caste discrimination is playing out in the United States as well. 2/3 of the members of the lowest caste, called Dalits, said that they have faced workplace discrimination due to their caste. 41% have experienced discrimination in education because of it in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Subramanian Shankar Feed Subramanian Shankar, and University of Hawaii.“Does America Have a Caste System?” CityLab, The Atlantic Monthly Group, 26 Jan. 2018, www.citylab.com/equity/2018/01/does-america-have-a-caste-system/551591/.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a legal context, a '''chilling effect''' is the inhibition or discouragement of the legitimate exercise of [[natural and legal rights]] by the threat of legal sanction.&lt;ref&gt;chilling effect. (n.d.). Retrieved October 19, 2011, from http://law.yourdictionary.com/chilling-effect&lt;/ref&gt; The right that is most often described as being suppressed by a chilling effect is the US [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|constitutional right to free speech]]. A chilling effect may be caused by legal actions such as the passing of a law, the decision of a court, or the [[legal threat|threat of a lawsuit]]; any legal action that would cause people to hesitate to exercise a legitimate right (freedom of speech or otherwise) for fear of legal repercussions. When that fear is brought about by the threat of a [[libel]] lawsuit, it is called '''libel chill'''.&lt;ref&gt;Green, A. (October 15, 2009). Banish the libel chill. The Guardian. Retrieved from https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/oct/15/simon-singh-libel-laws-chiropractic&lt;/ref&gt; A lawsuit initiated specifically for the purpose of creating a chilling effect may be called a [[Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation]], or more commonly, a "[[SLAPP suit]]".

"Chilling" in this context normally implies an undesirable slowing. Outside the legal context in common usage; any [[coercion]] or threat of coercion (or other unpleasantries) can have a chilling effect on a group of people regarding a specific behavior, and often can be statistically measured or be plainly observed. For example, the news headline "Flood insurance [price] spikes have chilling effect on some home sales,"&lt;ref name="Price Spikes"&gt;October 15, 2013, WWL‑TV Eyewitness News Headline: [http://www.wwltv.com/news/Skyrocketing-flood-insurance-rates-has-chilling-effect-on-some-home-sales-227940191.html Flood insurance spikes have chilling effect on some home sales.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131119055232/http://www.wwltv.com/news/Skyrocketing-flood-insurance-rates-has-chilling-effect-on-some-home-sales-227940191.html |date=November 19, 2013 }} "Realtors say [price spikes are] already causing home sales to fall through when buyers realize they can't afford the flood insurance." Retrieved January 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and the abstract title of a two‐part survey of 160 college students involved in dating relationships: "The chilling effect of aggressive potential on the expression of complaints in intimate relationships."&lt;ref name="Dating-1993"&gt;Communication Monographs, Volume 60, Issue 3, 1993 &lt;br&gt; Denise H. Clovena &amp; Michael E. Roloffb pages 199–219 &lt;br&gt; "THE CHILLING EFFECT OF AGGRESSIVE POTENTIAL ON THE EXPRESSION OF COMPLAINTS IN INTIMATE RELATIONSHIPS" &lt;br&gt; [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03637759309376309?journalCode=rcmm20#.Uua5-NLTlxA Abstract, by DH Cloven – 1993 -Published online: 02 Jun 2009] – (Cited by 99) &lt;br&gt; "A two‐part survey of 160 college students involved in dating relationships.... This chilling effect was greater when individuals who generally feared conflict anticipated aggressive repercussions (p &lt; .001), and when people anticipated symbolic aggression from relationally independent partners (p &lt; .05)."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

In United States and [[Canadian law]], the term ''chilling effects'' refers to the stifling effect that vague or excessively broad laws may have on legitimate speech activity.

However, the term is also now commonly used outside American legal [[jargon]], such as the chilling effects of high prices&lt;ref name="Price Spikes" /&gt; or of [[corrupt police]], or of "anticipated aggressive repercussions" (in say, personal relationships&lt;ref name="Dating-1993" /&gt;).

A chilling effect is an effect that reduces, suppresses, discourages, delays, or otherwise retards reporting concerns of any kind.

An example of the "chilling effect" in Canadian case law can be found in ''Iorfida v. MacIntyre'' where the constitutionality of a criminal law prohibiting the publication of literature depicting illicit drug use was challenged. The court found that the law had a "chilling effect" on legitimate forms of expression and could stifle political debate on issues such as the legalization of marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;Iorfida v. MacIntyre, 1994 CanLII 7341 (ON SC)at para. 20, &lt;{{cite web |url=http://canlii.ca/s/wwhi |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120713212406/http://canlii.ca/s/wwhi |archivedate=July 13, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&gt; retrieved on 2011-10-25&lt;/ref&gt; The court noted that it did not adopt the same "chilling effect" analysis used in American law but considered the chilling effect of the law as a part of its own analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Iorfida v. MacIntyre, 1994 CanLII 7341 (ON SC) at para. 37, &lt;{{cite web |url=http://canlii.ca/s/wwhi |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120713212406/http://canlii.ca/s/wwhi |archivedate=July 13, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&gt; retrieved on 2011-10-25&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1644 [[John Milton]] expressed the chilling effect of censorship in ''[[Areopagitica]]'':

{{quote|For to distrust the judgement and the honesty of one who hath but a common repute in learning and never yet offended, as not to count him fit to print his mind without a tutor or examiner, lest he should drop a schism or something of corruption, is the greatest displeasure and indignity to a free and knowing spirit that can be put upon him.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Milton]] (1644) [[Areopagitica]], edited by [[George H. Sabine]] (1951), page 29, [[Appleton-Century-Crofts]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term ''chilling effect'' has been in use in the United States since as early as 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Supreme Court first refers to the "chilling effect" in the context of the United States Constitution in ''[[Wieman v. Updegraff]]'' in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Chilling Effect in Constitutional Law|journal=[[Columbia Law Review]]|volume=69|issue=5|date=May 1969|pages=808–842|jstor=1121147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It, however, became further used as a legal term when [[William J. Brennan]], a [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|justice]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], used it in a judicial decision (''[[Lamont v. Postmaster General]]'') which overturned a law requiring a postal patron receiving "communist political propaganda"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Lamont'' case, however, did not center around a law that explicitly stifles free speech. The "chilling effect" referred to at the time was a "deterrent effect" on freedom of expression—even when there is no law explicitly prohibiting it. However, in general, "chilling effect" is now often used in reference to laws or actions that do not explicitly prohibit legitimate speech, but that impose undue burdens.&lt;ref name=lamont /&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2009}}

== Example in popular media ==

* In Season 2, episode 8 of [[The West Wing]], [[Toby Ziegler]] explains to [[Leo McGarry]] that the real stakes of the [[school prayer]] fight are the chilling effect that allowing even 'voluntary' school prayers has on children who are not part of the dominant religion:
&lt;blockquote&gt;TOBY: But I'll tell you why [School Prayer] should be front and center. It's not the first amendment, it's not religious freedom, it's not church and state, it's not... abstract...
LEO: What is it?
TOBY: It's the fourth grader who gets his ass kicked at recess 'cause he sat out the voluntary prayer in homeroom. It's another way of making kids different from other kids when they're required by law to be there. That’s why you want it front and center; fourth grader; that's the prize.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''cladogram''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''clados'' "branch" and ''gramma'' "character") is a diagram used in [[cladistics]] to show relations among organisms. A cladogram is not, however, an [[evolutionary tree]] because it does not show how ancestors are related to descendants, nor does it show how much they have changed; many evolutionary trees can be inferred from a single cladogram.&lt;ref name=mayr&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0469.1974.tb00160.x |title=Cladistic analysis or cladistic classification? |journal=Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research |volume=12 |pages=94–128 |year=2009 |last1=Mayr |first1=Ernst }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Foote&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Mike |last1=Foote |date=Spring 1996 |title=On the Probability of Ancestors in the Fossil Record |journal=Paleobiology |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=141–51 |jstor=2401114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dayrat&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Benoît |last1=Dayrat |date=Summer 2005 |title=Ancestor-Descendant Relationships and the Reconstruction of the Tree of Life |journal=Paleobiology |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=347–53 |jstor=4096939 |doi=10.1666/0094-8373(2005)031[0347:aratro]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PC&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(00)02026-7 |title=Intraspecific gene genealogies: Trees grafting into networks |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=16 |pages=37–45 |year=2001 |last1=Posada |first1=David |last2=Crandall |first2=Keith A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Podani&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2012.00423.x |title=Tree thinking, time and topology: Comments on the interpretation of tree diagrams in evolutionary/phylogenetic systematics |journal=Cladistics |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=315–327 |year=2013 |last1=Podani |first1=János |url=http://real.mtak.hu/9727/1/PodaniOnTreesFINAL.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A cladogram uses lines that branch off in different directions ending at a [[clade]], a group of organisms with a [[last common ancestor]]. There are many shapes of cladograms but they all have lines that branch off from other lines.  The lines can be traced back to where they branch off.  These branching off points represent a hypothetical ancestor (not an actual entity) which can be inferred to exhibit the traits shared among the terminal taxa above it.&lt;ref name=PC /&gt;&lt;ref name=sc&gt;{{cite book |first1=Randall T. |last1=Schuh |year=2000 |title=Biological Systematics: Principles and Applications |isbn=978-0-8014-3675-8}}{{page needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This hypothetical ancestor might then provide clues about the order of evolution of various features, adaptation, and other evolutionary narratives about ancestors.  Although traditionally such cladograms were generated largely on the basis of morphological characters, [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] sequencing data and [[computational phylogenetics]] are now very commonly used in the generation of cladograms, either on their own or in combination with morphology.

==Generating a cladogram==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}

===Molecular versus morphological data===

The characteristics used to create a cladogram can be roughly categorized as either morphological (synapsid skull, warm blooded, [[notochord]], unicellular, etc.) or molecular (DNA, RNA, or other genetic information).&lt;ref name="DeSalle"&gt;{{cite book |last=DeSalle |first=Rob |year=2002 |title=Techniques in Molecular Systematics and Evolution |publisher=Birkhauser |isbn=3-7643-6257-X}}{{page needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the advent of DNA sequencing, cladistic analysis primarily used morphological data.  Behavioral data (for animals) may also be used.&lt;ref name="Wenzel"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wenzel |first=John W. |year=1992  |title=Behavioral homology and phylogeny  |journal=Annu. Rev. Ecol.

As [[DNA sequencing]] has become cheaper and easier, [[molecular systematics]] has become a more and more popular way to infer phylogenetic hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hillis|first=David|title=Molecular Systematics |year=1996 |publisher=Sinaur|isbn=0-87893-282-8 |authorlink=David Hillis}}{{page needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a parsimony criterion is only one of several methods to infer a phylogeny from molecular data. Approaches such as [[maximum likelihood]], which incorporate explicit models of sequence evolution, are non-Hennigian ways to evaluate sequence data. Another powerful method of reconstructing phylogenies is the use of genomic [[retrotransposon marker]]s, which are thought to be less prone to the problem of [[reversion (genetics)|reversion]] that plagues sequence data. They are also generally assumed to have a low incidence of homoplasies because it was once thought that their integration into the [[genome]] was entirely random; this seems at least sometimes not to be the case, however.

[[Image:Cladistics-Apomorphy.png|thumb|250px|[[Apomorphy]] in cladistics.  This diagram indicates "A" and "C" as ancestral states, and "B", "D" and "E" as states that are present in terminal taxa.  Note that in practice, ancestral conditions are not known ''a priori'' (as shown in this heuristic example), but must be inferred from the pattern of shared states observed in the terminals.  Given that each terminal in this example has a unique state, in reality we would not be able to infer anything conclusive about the ancestral states (other than the fact that the existence of unobserved states "A" and "C" would be unparsimonious inferences!)]]

===Plesiomorphies and synapomorphies===

Researchers must decide which character states are "ancestral" (''[[plesiomorphy|plesiomorphies]]'') and which are derived (''[[synapomorphy|synapomorphies]]''), because only synapomorphic character states provide evidence of grouping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hennig |first=Willi |title=Phylogenetic Systematics |year=1966 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |authorlink=Willi Hennig}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This determination is usually done by comparison to the character states of one or more ''outgroups''.  States shared between the outgroup and some members of the in-group are symplesiomorphies; states that are present only in a subset of the in-group are synapomorphies.  Note that character states unique to a single terminal (autapomorphies) do not provide evidence of grouping.  The choice of an outgroup is a crucial step in cladistic analysis because different outgroups can produce trees with profoundly different topologies.

===Homoplasies===

A [[homoplasy]] is a character state that is shared by two or more taxa due to some cause ''other'' than common ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=West-Eberhard|first=Mary Jane| authorlink=Mary Jane West-Eberhard | title=Developmental Plasticity and Evolution |pages=353–376| year=2003 |publisher=Oxford Univ. Press | isbn=0-19-512235-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two main types of homoplasy are convergence (evolution of the "same" character in at least two distinct lineages) and reversion (the return to an ancestral character state). Characters that are obviously homoplastic, such as white fur in different lineages of Arctic mammals, should not be included as a character in a phylogenetic analysis as they do not contribute anything to our understanding of relationships.  However, homoplasy is often not evident from inspection of the character itself (as in DNA sequence, for example), and is then detected by its incongruence (unparsimonious distribution) on a most-parsimonious cladogram.  Note that characters that are homoplastic may still contain phylogenetic signal.&lt;ref&gt;Källersjö, M., V. A. Albert, and J. S. Farris. 1999. Homoplasy increases phylogenetic structure. Cladistics 15:91-94.
&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known example of homoplasy due to convergent evolution would be the character, "presence of wings". Although the wings of birds, [[bat]]s, and insects serve the same function, each evolved independently, as can be seen by their [[anatomy]]. If a bird, bat, and a winged insect were scored for the character, "presence of wings", a homoplasy would be introduced into the dataset, and this could potentially confound the analysis, possibly resulting in a false hypothesis of relationships.  Of course, the only reason a homoplasy is recognizable in the first place is because there are other characters that imply a pattern of relationships that reveal its homoplastic distribution.

===What is not a cladogram===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
A cladogram is the diagrammatic result of an analysis, which groups taxa on the basis of synapomorphies alone.  There are many other phylogenetic algorithms that treat data somewhat differently, and result in phylogenetic trees that look like cladograms but are not cladograms.  For example, phenetic algorithms, such as UPGMA and Neighbor-Joining, group by overall similarity, and treat both synapomorphies and symplesiomorphies as evidence of grouping,  The resulting diagrams are phenograms, not cladograms,  Similarly, the results of model-based methods (Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian approaches) that take into account both branching order and "branch length," count both synapomorphies and autapomorphies as evidence for or against grouping,  The diagrams resulting from those sorts of analysis are not cladograms, either.&lt;ref&gt;Brower, A. V. Z. 2016. What is a cladogram and what is not? Cladistics 32:573-576.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cladogram selection===
There are several [[algorithms]] available to identify the "best" cladogram.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Most algorithms use a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] to measure how consistent a candidate cladogram is with the data. Most cladogram algorithms use the mathematical techniques of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] and minimization.

In general, cladogram generation algorithms must be implemented as computer programs, although some algorithms can be performed manually when the data sets are modest (for example, just a few species and a couple of characteristics).

Some algorithms are useful only when the characteristic data are molecular (DNA, RNA); other algorithms are useful only when the characteristic data are morphological. Other algorithms can be used when the characteristic data includes both molecular and morphological data.

Algorithms for cladograms or other types of phylogenetic trees include [[least squares]], [[neighbor-joining]], [[Occam's razor|parsimony]], [[maximum likelihood]], and [[Bayesian inference]].

Biologists sometimes use the term [[Maximum parsimony (phylogenetics)|parsimony]] for a specific kind of cladogram generation algorithm and sometimes as an umbrella term for all phylogenetic algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/361603a0 |pmid=8437621 |title=The powers and pitfalls of parsimony |journal=Nature |volume=361 |issue=6413 |pages=603–7 |year=1993 |last1=Stewart |first1=Caro-Beth |bibcode=1993Natur.361..603S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algorithms that perform optimization tasks (such as building cladograms) can be sensitive to the order in which the input data (the list of species and their characteristics) is presented. Inputting the data in various orders can cause the same algorithm to produce different "best" cladograms. In these situations, the user should input the data in various orders and compare the results.

Using different algorithms on a single data set can sometimes yield different "best" cladograms, because each algorithm may have a unique definition of what is "best".

Because of the astronomical number of possible cladograms, algorithms cannot guarantee that the solution is the overall best solution. A nonoptimal cladogram will be selected if the program settles on a local minimum rather than the desired global minimum.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; To help solve this problem, many cladogram algorithms use a [[simulated annealing]] approach to increase the likelihood that the selected cladogram is the optimal one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.1999.tb00277.x |title=The Parsimony Ratchet, a New Method for Rapid Parsimony Analysis |journal=Cladistics |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=407–414 |year=1999 |last1=Nixon |first1=Kevin C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal position]] is the direction of the base (or root) of a rooted phylogenetic tree or cladogram. A basal clade is the earliest clade (of a given taxonomic rank[a]) to branch within a larger clade.

==Statistics==

===Incongruence length difference test (or partition homogeneity test)===

The incongruence length difference test (ILD) is a measurement of how the combination of different datasets (e.g. morphological and molecular, plastid and nuclear genes) contributes to a longer tree. It is measured by first calculating the total tree length of each partition and summing them. Then replicates are made by making randomly assembled partitions consisting of the original partitions. The lengths are summed. A p value of 0.01 is obtained for 100 replicates if 99 replicates have longer combined tree lengths.

===Measuring homoplasy===
{{Further|Convergent evolution}}
Some measures attempt to measure the amount of homoplasy in a dataset with reference to a tree,&lt;ref&gt;reviewed in {{cite book |doi=10.1016/B978-012618030-5/50008-3 |chapter=Measures of Homoplasy |title=Homoplasy |pages=153–188 |year=1996 |last1=Archie |first1=James W. |editor-first=Michael J. |editor-last=Sanderson |editor-first2=Larry |editor-last2=Hufford |isbn=9780126180305}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is not necessarily clear precisely what property these measures aim to quantify&lt;ref&gt;CHANG, J. T. and KIM, J. 1996. The measurement of homoplasy: a stochastic view. In SANDERSON, M. J. and HUFFORD, L. (eds.) Homoplasy: The Recurrence of Similarity in Evolution, Academic Press, 189–203 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Consistency index====

The consistency index (CI) measures the consistency of a tree to a set of data – a measure of the minimum amount of homoplasy implied by the tree.&lt;ref name="KLUGE, A. G 1969"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kluge | first1 = A. G. | last2 = Farris | first2 = J. S. | year = 1969 | title = Quantitative Phyletics and the Evolution of Anurans | url = | journal = Systematic Zoology | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 1–32 | doi=10.2307/2412407}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is calculated by counting the minimum number of changes in a dataset and dividing it by the actual number of changes needed for the cladogram.&lt;ref name="KLUGE, A. G 1969"/&gt;  A consistency index can also be calculated for an individual character ''i'', denoted c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.

Besides reflecting the amount of homoplasy, the metric also reflects the number of taxa in the dataset,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Archie | first1 = J. W. | last2 = Felsenstein | first2 = J. | year = 1993 | title = The Number of Evolutionary Steps on Random and Minimum Length Trees for Random Evolutionary Data | url = | journal = Theoretical Population Biology | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 52–79 | doi = 10.1006/tpbi.1993.1003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (to a lesser extent) the number of characters in a dataset,&lt;ref name="ARCHIE, J. W 1989"/&gt; the degree to which each character carries phylogenetic information,&lt;ref name="Jennifer F p C"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2009.00270.x|title=A formula for maximum possible steps in multistate characters: Isolating matrix parameter effects on measures of evolutionary convergence|journal=Cladistics|volume=26|pages=98–102|year=2010|last1=Hoyal Cuthill|first1=Jennifer F.|last2=Braddy|first2=Simon J.|last3=Donoghue|first3=Philip C. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fashion in which additive characters are coded, rendering it unfit for purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sanderson | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Donoghue | first2 = M. J. | year = 1989 | title = Patterns of variations in levels of homoplasy | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 1781–1795 | doi=10.2307/2409392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; occupies a range from 1 to 1/[''n.taxa''/2] in binary characters with an even state distribution; its minimum value is larger when states are not evenly spread.&lt;ref name="Jennifer F p C"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Archie1996 /&gt;

====Retention index====

The retention index (RI) was proposed as an improvement of the CI "for certain applications"&lt;ref name="FARRIS, J. S 1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Farris | first1 = J. S. | year = 1989 | title = The retention index and the rescaled consistency index | url = | journal = Cladistics | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 417–419 | doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.1989.tb00573.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This metric also purports to measure of the amount of homoplasy, but also measures how well synapomorphies explain the tree. It is calculated taking the (maximum number of changes on a tree minus the number of changes on the tree), and dividing by the (maximum number of changes on the tree minus the minimum number of changes in the dataset).

The rescaled consistency index (RC) is obtained by multiplying the CI by the RI; in effect this stretches the range of the CI such that its minimum theoretically attainable value is rescaled to 0, with its maximum remaining at 1.&lt;ref name=Archie1996&gt;ARCHIE, J. W. 1996. Measures of homoplasy. In Homoplasy, Elsevier, 153–188 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FARRIS, J. S 1989"/&gt; The homoplasy index (HI) is simply 1 &amp;minus; CI.

==== Homoplasy Excess Ratio ====

This measures the amount of homoplasy observed on a tree relative to the maximum amount of homoplasy that could theoretically be present – 1 &amp;minus; (observed homoplasy excess) / (maximum homoplasy excess).&lt;ref name="ARCHIE, J. W 1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Archie | first1 = J.

W 1989"/&gt;  The HER is presented as the best measure of homoplasy currently available.&lt;ref name=Archie1996/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2014.10.033|pmid=25451518|title=The size of the character state space affects the occurrence and detection of homoplasy: Modelling the probability of incompatibility for unordered phylogenetic characters|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=366|pages=24–32|year=2015|last1=Hoyal Cuthill|first1=Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It holds that objects have certain pairs of complementary properties which cannot all be observed or measured simultaneously.

The complementarity principle was formulated by [[Niels Bohr]], a leading founder of quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Evan Harris|title=The Physics of Consciousness|year=2000|publisher=Perseus|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-7382-0436-6|page=271|quote=...the founders of quantum mechanics – [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], [[Schrödinger]] and Bohr...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of complementary properties that Bohr considered:

* [[uncertainty principle|Position and momentum]]
* Energy and duration
* [[Spin (physics)|Spin]] on different axes
* [[Wave-particle duality|Wave and particle]]-related properties
* Value of a [[Field (physics)|field]] and its change (at a certain position)
* [[Quantum entanglement|Entanglement]] and coherence&lt;ref&gt; Cramer, J. G. et al. "An Inquiry into the Possibility of Nonlocal Quantum Communication". Foundation of Phys. Submitted. Revised Feb., 2015 [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.5098v2.pdf]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
For example, the [[wave-particle duality|particle and wave aspects]] of physical objects are such complementary phenomena.  Both concepts are borrowed from [[classical mechanics]], where it is impossible to be a particle and wave at the same time. Therefore, it is impossible to measure  the ''full'' properties of the wave and particle at a particular moment.&lt;ref name="Baggott2011"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Jim Baggott]] |title=The Quantum Story: A History in|year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn= |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Bohr implies that it is not possible to regard objects governed by quantum mechanics as having intrinsic properties independent of determination with a measuring device, a viewpoint supported by the [[Kochen-Specker theorem]]. The type of measurement determines which property is shown. However the single and [[double-slit experiment]] and other experiments show that ''some'' effects of wave and particle can be measured in one measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = María C. | last = Boscá Díaz-Pintado | title = Updating the wave-particle duality | booktitle = 15th UK and European Meeting on the Foundations of Physics | pages = | publisher = | date = 29–31 March 2007 | location = Leeds, UK | url = http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00003568/ | doi = | accessdate = 2008-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature==
An aspect of complementarity is that it not only applies to measurability or knowability of some property of a physical entity, but more importantly it applies to the limitations of that physical entity’s very manifestation of the property in the physical world.  All properties of physical entities exist only in pairs, which Bohr described as complementary or conjugate pairs.  Physical reality is determined and defined by manifestations of properties which are limited by trade-offs between these complementary pairs.  For example, an electron can manifest a greater and greater accuracy of its position only in even trade for a complementary loss in accuracy of manifesting its momentum.  This means that there is a limitation on the precision with which an electron can possess (i.e., manifest) position, since an infinitely precise position would dictate that its manifested momentum would be infinitely imprecise, or undefined (i.e., non-manifest or not possessed), which is not possible.  The ultimate limitations in precision of property manifestations are quantified by the Heisenberg [[uncertainty principle]] and [[Planck units]].  Complementarity and Uncertainty dictate that therefore all properties and actions in the physical world manifest themselves as non-deterministic to some degree.

Physicists F.A.M. Frescura and [[Basil Hiley]] have summarized the reasons for the introduction of the principle of complementarity in physics as follows:&lt;ref&gt;F. A. M. Frescura, [[Basil Hiley|B. J. Hiley]]: [http://www.bbk.ac.uk/tpru/BasilHiley/P12FrescandHiley3.pdf ''Algebras, quantum theory and pre-space''], published in Revista Brasileira de Fisica, Volume Especial, Julho 1984, Os 70 anos de Mario Schonberg, pp. 49–86, p.&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/ref&gt;
::“In the traditional view, it is assumed that there exists a reality in space-time and that this reality is a given thing, all of whose aspects can be viewed or articulated at any given moment. Bohr was the first to point out that quantum mechanics called this traditional outlook into question. To him the ‘indivisibility of the quantum of action’, which was his way of describing the uncertainty principle, implied that not all aspects of a system can be viewed simultaneously. By using one particular piece of apparatus only certain features could be made manifest at the expense of others, while with a different piece of apparatus another complementary aspect could be made manifest in such a way that the original set became non-manifest, that is, the original attributes were no longer well defined. For Bohr, this was an indication that the principle of complementarity, a principle that he had previously known to appear extensively in other intellectual disciplines but which did not appear in classical physics, should be adopted as a universal principle.”
The emergence of complementarity in a system occurs when one considers the circumstances under which one attempts to measure its properties; as Bohr noted, the principle of complementarity "implies the impossibility of any sharp separation between the behaviour of atomic objects and the interaction with the measuring instruments that serve to define the conditions under which the phenomena appear."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Foundations of Quantum Physics II (1933-1958) |author=Jørgen Kalckar, [[Niels Bohr]], [[Léon Rosenfeld]], Erik Rüdinger, Finn Aaserud |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yet5P7f_63oC&amp;pg=RA1-PA210&amp;dq=impossibility+of+any+sharp+separation+between+the+behaviour+of+atomic+objects+and+the+interaction+with+the+measuring+instruments#v=onepage&amp;q=impossibility%20of%20any%20sharp%20separation%20between%20the%20behaviour%20of%20atomic%20objects%20and%20the%20interaction%20with%20the%20measuring%20instruments&amp;f=false |publisher=Elsevier |page=210 |isbn=978-0-444-89892-0 |year=1996 |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important to distinguish, as did Bohr in his original statements, the principle of complementarity from a statement of the uncertainty principle. For a technical discussion of contemporary issues surrounding complementarity in physics see, e.g., Bandyopadhyay (2000),&lt;ref name="Bandyopadhyay2000"&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=quant-ph/0003073 |title=Welcher Weg Experiments and the Orthodox Bohr's Complementarity Principle |first=Supriyo |last=Bandyopadhyay |year=2000 |doi=10.1016/S0375-9601(00)00670-8|bibcode = 2000PhLA..276..233B |journal=Physics Letters A |volume=276 |issue=5–6 |pages=233–239 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from which parts of this discussion were drawn.

==Additional considerations==
In his original lecture on the topic, Bohr pointed out that just as the finitude of the speed of light implies the impossibility of a sharp separation between space and time (relativity), the finitude of the [[Planck constant|quantum of action]] implies the impossibility of a sharp separation between the behavior of a system and its interaction with the measuring instruments and leads to the well known difficulties with the concept of 'state' in quantum theory; the notion of complementarity is intended to symbolize this new situation in epistemology created by quantum theory. Some people consider it a philosophical adjunct to [[quantum mechanics]], while others consider it to be a discovery that is as important as the formal aspects of quantum theory. Examples of the latter include [[Leon Rosenfeld]], who claimed that "[C]omplementarity is not a philosophical superstructure invented by Bohr to be placed as a decoration on top of the quantal formalism, it is the bedrock of the quantal description.",&lt;ref name="Bohr1996a"&gt;{{cite book |author=Niels Bohr |authorlink=Niels Bohr |author2=fwd.

==Experiments==
The quintessential example of wave–particle complementarity in the laboratory is the [[double slit]]. The crux of the complementary behavior is the question: "What information exists – embedded in the constituents of the universe – that can reveal the history of the signal particles as they pass through the double slit?" If information exists (even if it [[quantum eraser|is not measured by a conscious observer]]) that reveals "which slit" each particle traversed, then each particle will exhibit no wave interference with the other slit. This is the particle-like behavior. But if ''no information'' exists about which slit – so that no conscious observer, no matter how well equipped, will ever be able to determine which slit each particle traverses – then the signal particles will interfere with themselves as if they traveled through both slits at the same time, as a wave. This is the wave-like behavior. These behaviors are complementary, according to the [[Englert–Greenberger duality relation]], because when one behavior is observed the other is absent. Both behaviors ''can'' be observed at the same time, but each only as lesser manifestations of their full behavior (as determined by the duality relation). This superposition of complementary behaviors exists whenever there is partial "which slit" information. While there is some contention to the duality relation, and thus complementarity itself, the [[Afshar experiment|contrary position]] is not accepted by mainstream physics.&lt;ref name=Haroche&gt;{{cite book | last1 =Haroche | first1 =Serge | last2 =Raimond | first2 =Jean-Michel | title =Exploring the Quantum: Atoms, Cavities, and Photons | publisher =Oxford University Press | edition =1st  | year =2006 | isbn =978-0198509141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|35–40}} Double slit experiments with single photons show clearly that photons are particles at the same time as they are waves. Photons impact the screen where they are detected in points, and when enough points have accumulated the wave aspect is clearly visible. Also the particle and wave aspect is seen at the same time in photons that are stationary.

Various [[neutron interferometry]] experiments demonstrate the subtlety of the notions of duality and complementarity. By passing through the [[interferometer]], the [[neutron]] appears to act as a wave.  Yet upon passage, the neutron is subject to [[gravitation]]. As the neutron interferometer is rotated through Earth's [[gravitational field]] a phase change between the two arms of the interferometer can be observed, accompanied by a change in the constructive and destructive interference of the neutron waves on exit from the interferometer.  Some interpretations claim that understanding the interference effect requires one to concede that a single neutron takes both paths through the interferometer at the same time; a single neutron would "be in two places at once", as it were.  Since the two paths through a neutron interferometer can be as far as {{nowrap|5 cm}} to {{nowrap|15 cm}} apart, the effect is hardly microscopic. This is similar to traditional double-slit and mirror interferometer experiments where the slits (or mirrors) can be arbitrarily far apart. So, in interference and diffraction experiments, neutrons behave the same way as photons (or electrons) of corresponding wavelength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==History==
Niels Bohr apparently conceived of the principle of complementarity during a skiing vacation in Norway in February and March 1927, during which he received a letter from [[Werner Heisenberg]] regarding the latter's newly discovered (and not yet published) [[uncertainty principle]].  Upon returning from his vacation, by which time Heisenberg had already submitted his paper on the uncertainty principle for publication, he convinced Heisenberg that the uncertainty principle was a manifestation of the deeper concept of complementarity.&lt;ref name="Baggott2011"/&gt; Heisenberg duly appended a note to this effect to his paper on the uncertainty principle, before its publication, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Bohr has brought to my attention [that] the uncertainty in our observation does not arise exclusively from the occurrence of discontinuities, but is tied directly to the demand that we ascribe equal validity to the quite different experiments which show up in the [particulate] theory on one hand, and in the wave theory on the other hand.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bohr publicly introduced the principle of complementarity in a lecture he delivered on 16 September 1927 at the International Physics Congress held in [[Como, Italy]], attended by most of the leading physicists of the era, with the notable exceptions of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]], and [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]].  However, these three were in attendance one month later when Bohr again presented the principle at the [[Solvay Congress|Fifth Solvay Congress]] in [[Brussels, Belgium]].  The lecture was published in the proceedings of both of these conferences, and was republished the following year in ''Naturwissenschaften'' (in German) and in ''Nature'' (in English).&lt;ref name="Bohr1928English"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bohr N |title=The Quantum Postulate and the Recent Development of Atomic Theory |journal=Nature |volume=121 |pages=580–590 |year=1928 |doi= 10.1038/121580a0|bibcode =   1928Natur.121..580B}}  Available in the collection of Bohr's early writings, ''Atomic Theory and the Description of Nature'' (1934).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''conflict between [[good and evil]]''' is one of the most common conventional themes in [[literature]], and is sometimes considered to be a universal part of the [[human condition]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldtransformation.com/good-vs-evil/ ''Good vs Evil''&lt;/ref&gt;. There are several variations on this conflict, one being the battle between individuals or ideologies, with one side held up as ''[[Goodness and value theory|Good]]'', while the other is portrayed as ''[[Evil]]''. Another variation is the inner struggle in characters (and by extension, humans in reality) between good and evil. 

==Classical tragedy==
The form of tragedy described as best by [[Aristotle]] and exemplified by ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' is, properly, concerned more with the tragic operations of fate than with a thematized conflict between good and evil. Nevertheless, the conflict between the good and the flawed aspects of the [[tragic hero]] form an important part of tragic [[catharsis]] in Aristotle's theory. There is, moreover, the form of tragedy with a happy ending that, although denigrated from Aristotle, was quite common in antiquity. This form, perhaps best exemplified by the [[Alcestis]] of [[Euripides]], ends with a hero or god decisively beating an evil character.  [[Northrop Frye]] has suggested that this form of "tragedy" is, in fact, the basic template for [[melodrama]].

Sometimes referred to as "The Good War," the Second World War has arguably come in western discourse to signify the very idea of a [[Just War Theory|just war]] between Good (The Allies) and Evil (The Axis), in both popular and at times even academic spheres.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Jewish and Christian literature==
Writers from the earliest times have thematized the conflict between good and evil, understood, of course, in religious terms.  In the [[Old Testament]], [[Yahweh]] asks the prophet [[Jeremiah]]: "The heart is devious above all else; it is perverse—who can understand it?" ({{bibleref|Jeremiah|17:9}}, [[NRSV]]). Compare also the [[Book of Job]].
  
In addition to explicating [[classical antiquity|classical]] myth and stories to reveal a hidden conflict between good and evil in them, they wrote into their own texts different versions of the conflict.  The basic forms may be described as the [[apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]], in which the writer describes real, social events (whether historical or imagined) as manifestations of the eternal conflict between [[God]] and [[Satan]], good and evil &amp;mdash; a struggle that, if controlled in the end by God's [[omnipotence]], was nevertheless of deep importance for humans.  In a different way, Christian writers could focus on the internal struggle to find or maintain belief. This literature is exemplified by the ''[[Psychomachia]]'' of [[Prudentius]], whose title continues to signify great psychological turmoil, and supremely by [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine of Hippo's]] ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'', the model for countless later psychological biographies. Special mention might also be made of the ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' of [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]], a work that combines Platonic, Christian, and Stoic thought on the nature of suffering.

== The inner evil conflict ==
[[Joseph Conrad]] defined all humans as having an "inner evil" or ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' in his novella of the same name.

While certainly not as widely seen as the direct good vs. evil conflict, the concept of "individual vs. self" is often much more compelling to a reader/watcher, especially if it is the [[protagonist]]. In both [[literature]] and [[film]], it requires well-written character development in order to truly succeed.

[[Joseph Conrad]]'s version of the inner evil conflict, known as the [[Heart of Darkness]], is a [[human]]'s struggle with their own [[morals]], and their own battle with their hidden evil. Although first chiefly used in the novel, this improved device was commonly used, as opposed to the old devices used in literature before the turn of the century. It is a conflict that exists outside of literature as well, making it a universal truth of the human condition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12359">'''Defensive pessimism '''is a [[cognitive strategy]] identified by [[Nancy Cantor]] and her students in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Norem, J.K. (2001). [https://www.academia.edu/download/34814974/Optimisrm.pdf#page=69 Defensive pessimism, optimism, and pessimism]. In Chang, Edward (Ed). ''Optimism &amp; pessimism: Implication for theory, research, and practice'' (pp. 77–100). Washington DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals use defensive pessimism as a strategy to prepare for anxiety-provoking events or performances. When implementing defensive pessimism, individuals set low expectations for their performance, regardless of how well they have done in the past. Defensive pessimists then think through specific negative events and setbacks that could adversely influence their goal pursuits. By envisioning possible negative outcomes, defensive pessimists can take action to avoid or prepare for them.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Norem, J. K. (2008). Defensive pessimism, anxiety, and the complexity of evaluating self-regulation. ''Social and Personality Psychology Compass, 2,'' 121-134.&lt;/ref&gt; Using this strategy, defensive pessimists can advantageously harness anxiety that might otherwise harm their performance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Norem. J. K., &amp; Cantor, N. (1986) [https://www.academia.edu/download/44539514/Norem_CantorJPSP86.pdf Defensive pessimism: Harnessing anxiety as motivation]. ''Journal of Personality and Psychology, 51,'' 1208–1217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Defensive pessimism is utilized in a variety of domains, and [[public speaking]] provides a good example of the process involved in this strategy. Defensive pessimists could alleviate their anxiety over public speaking by imagining possible obstacles such as forgetting the speech, being thirsty, or staining their shirts before the event. Because defensive pessimists have thought of these problems, they can appropriately prepare to face the challenges ahead. The speaker could, for instance, create note cards with cues about the speech, place a cup of water on the podium to alleviate thirst, and bring a bleach pen to remove shirt stains. These preventative actions both reduce anxiety and promote superior performance.

==Strategy effectiveness==
Though defensive pessimists are less satisfied with their performances and rate themselves higher in "need for improvement," they do not actually perform worse than people with a more optimistic strategy. Norem and Cantor (1986) investigated whether encouraging defensive pessimists, and thereby interfering with their typical negative thinking, would result in worse performances. Participants in the study were in either encouragement or non-encouragement scenarios as they prepared to complete anagram and puzzle tasks. In the encouragement condition, the defensive pessimists were told that, based on their GPA, they should expect to do well. Defensive pessimists performed worse when encouraged than the defensive pessimists whose strategy was not manipulated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Defensive pessimism is an adaptive strategy for those who struggle with anxiety: their performance decreases if they are unable to appropriately manage and counteract their anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Norem, J. (2001). ''The Positive Power of Negative Thinking''. Cambridge, MA: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key components==

===Prefactual thinking===
[[File:The Prefactual Thought Experiment.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of a prefactual thought experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.143.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Prefactual (i.e., "before the fact") thinking is an essential component of defensive pessimism. Synonymous with [[anticipation]], it denotes a cognitive strategy in which people imagine possible outcomes of a future scenario. The term '''prefactual''' was specifically coined by Lawrence J. Sanna, in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;He did so in order to contrast and distinguish the ''[[Thought_experiment#Prefactual|prefactual sort of thought experiment]]'' from both ''[[Thought_experiment#Semifactual|the semifactual]]'' and ''[[Thought_experiment#Counterfactual|the counterfactual sort of thought experiments]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; to denote those activities that speculate on possible future outcomes, given the present, and ask "What will be the outcome if event E occurs?"

The imagined outcomes are either positive/desirable, negative/undesirable, or neutral. Prefactual thinking can be advantageous because it allows the individual to prepare for possible outcomes of a scenario.

For defensive pessimists, prefactual thinking offers the primary and critical method to alleviate anxiety.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Usually, this prefactual thinking is paired with a pessimistic outlook, resulting in negative/undesirable imagined scenarios. With regard to the earlier example, the public speaking defensive pessimist anticipates forgetting the speech or becoming thirsty as opposed to giving an amazing speech and receiving a standing ovation.

===Anxiety===
As defensive pessimism is motivated by a need to manage anxiety, it is unsurprisingly also correlated with trait anxiety and [[neuroticism]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Negative mood states promote defensive pessimists' goal attainment strategy by facilitating the generation of potential setbacks and negative outcomes that could arise during goal pursuit, which can then be anticipated and prevented. When defensive pessimists are encouraged into positive or even just neutral mood states, they perform worse on experimental tasks than when in a negative mood state. They are more anxious because they are prevented from properly implementing their preferred cognitive strategy for goal attainment.&lt;ref&gt;del Valle, C. H. &amp; Mateos, P. M. (2008). Dispositional pessimism, defensive pessimism and optimism: The effect of induced mood on prefactual and counterfactual thinking and performance. ''Cognition and Emotion, 22''(8). 1600-1612.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-esteem==
Defensive pessimism is generally related to lower [[self-esteem]] since the strategy involves self-criticism, pessimism, and discounting previous successful performances. Indeed, Norem and Burdzovic Andreas (2006) found that, compared to optimists, defensive pessimists had lower self-esteem entering college. At the end of four years of college, however, the self-esteem of the defensive pessimists had increased to nearly equal levels as optimists. The self-esteem of optimists had not changed, and the self-esteem of pessimists who did not employ defensive pessimism had fallen slightly by the end of college.&lt;ref&gt;Norem, J. K., &amp; Burdzovic Andreas, J. (2006). Understanding journeys: Individual  growth analysis as a tool for studying individual differences in change over time. In A. D. Ong  &amp; M. van Dulmen (Eds.), ''Handbook of Methods in Positive Psychology'' (pp. 1036-1058). London: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; While defensive pessimism may have implications for self-esteem, it appears that these effects lessen over time.

==Compared to pessimism==
Unlike [[pessimism]], defensive pessimism is not an internal, global, and stable attribution style, but rather a cognitive strategy utilized within the context of certain goals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Pessimism involves rumination about possible negative outcomes of a situation without proactive behavior to counteract these outcomes. Defensive pessimism, on the other hand, utilizes the foresight of negative situations in order to prepare against them. The negative possible outcomes of a situation often motivate defensive pessimists to work harder for success. Since defensive pessimists are anxious, but not certain, that negative situations will arise, they still feel that they can control their outcomes.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Norem, J. K. (2008). Defensive pessimism as a positive self-critical tool. In Chang, Edward (Ed). ''Self-criticism and self enhancement: Theory and research and clinical implications'' (pp. 89-104). Washington DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a defensive pessimist would not avoid all job interviews for fear of failing one. Instead, a defensive pessimist would anticipate possible challenges that could come in an upcoming job interview – such as dress code, stubborn interviewers, and tough questions – and prepare rigorously to face them. Defensive pessimism is not a reaction to stressful events nor does it entail ruminating on events of the past, and should therefore be distinguished from pessimism as a trait or a more general negative outlook. Instead, defensive pessimists are able to stop using this strategy once it is no longer beneficial (i.e., does not serve a preparatory role).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Compared to other cognitive strategies==

===Self-handicapping===
Elliot and Church (2003) determined that people adopt defensive pessimism or self-handicapping strategies for the same reason: to deal with anxiety-provoking situations. [[Self-handicapping]] is a cognitive strategy in which people construct obstacles to their own success to keep failure from damaging their self-esteem. The difference between self-handicapping and defensive pessimism lies in the motivation behind the strategies. Beyond managing anxiety, defensive pessimism is further motivated by a desire for high achievement. Self-handicappers, however, feel no such need. Elliot and Church found that the self-handicapping strategy undermined goal achievement while defensive pessimism aided achievement. People who self-handicapped were high in avoidance motivation and low in approach motivation. They wanted to avoid anxiety but were not motivated to approach success. Defensive pessimists, on the other hand, were motivated to approach success and goal attainment while simultaneously avoiding the anxiety associated with performance. Although it was found that defensive pessimism was positively correlated with goals related to both performance-avoidance and performance-avoidance, it was not found to be a predictor of one's mastery of goals. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Elliot, A.J., Church, M.A. (2003). [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7a8a/a7a6ec3688e79c203b11215ee95d9e1743d1.pdf A Motivational Analysis of Defensive Pessimism and Self-Handicapping]. ''Journal of Personality, 71''(3), 369-396.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategic optimism===
In research, defensive pessimism is frequently contrasted with strategic optimism, another cognitive strategy. When facing performance situations, strategic optimists feel that they will end well. Therefore, though they plan ahead, they plan only minimally because they do not have any anxiety to face. While defensive pessimists set low expectations, feel anxious, and rehearse possible negative outcomes of situations, strategic optimists set high expectations, feel calm, and do not reflect on the situation any more than absolutely necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, S.M. &amp; Norem, J.K. (1996). Reflection and distraction: Defensive pessimism, strategic optimism, and performance. ''Personal Social Psychology Bulletin, 22,'' 354–365.&lt;/ref&gt; Strategic optimists start out with different motivations and obstacles: unlike defensive pessimists, strategic optimists do not have any anxiety to surmount. In spite of their differences in motivation, strategic optimists and defensive pessimists have similar objective performance outcomes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For both strategic optimists and defensive pessimists, their respective cognitive strategies are adaptive and promote success.

'''Desert''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ᵻ|ˈ|z|ɜːr|t}}) in [[philosophy]] is the condition of being deserving of something, whether good or bad.

==Nomenclature==
{{wiktionary|just deserts}}

The word is related to [[justice]], [[revenge]], [[blame]], [[punishment]] and many topics central to moral philosophy, also "moral desert". In the English language, the word "desert" with this meaning tends to be a rather uncommon word [[colloquial]]ly; it is almost exclusively used in the phrase "just deserts" (e.g. "Although she was not at first arrested for the crime, she later on received her just deserts."). The phrase "just desserts" is a pun on this original term and is often confused as the correct spelling of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.oup.com/2007/10/corpus-2/|title=Are We Giving Free Rei(g)n to New Spellings? {{!}} OUPblog|date=2007-10-18|work=OUPblog|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ordinary usage, to deserve is to earn or merit a reward; in philosophy, the distinction is drawn in the term desert to include the case that which one receives as one's just deserts may well be unwelcome, or a reward. For example, if one scratches off a winning lottery ticket, one may be ''entitled'' to the money, but one does not necessarily ''deserve'' it in the same way one would deserve $5 for mowing a lawn, or a round of applause for performing a solo. While "moral desert" refers to any type of outcome that morally 'fits' or reflects one's actions,{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} the punned term "moral desserts" refers specifically to a reward, as one might receive a 'reward' of dessert for eating their meal.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Formulation==
''Desert claims'' may be generally expressed as: ''Thing '''X''' deserves '''Y''' in virtue of '''Z'''.'' For example, ''I (X) deserve a good grade on my test (Y) because I studied hard (Z)''; ''Cincinnati (X) deserves to be praised (Y) because it is a pretty city (Z).'' Some authors have added a further criterion, qualifying '''Z'''. That is, Agent X deserves Y in virtue of Z ''if X is responsible for Z (or, alternatively, if X is also deserving of Z)''. Considering this stipulation, one does not deserve respect simply because one is a human being, because one is not responsible for being a human being (Z). Arguments such as this are contentious as they suggest an untenability of [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|intrinsic]] desert claims—that is, claims wherein Z means simply to be X. Less controversially, if one (X) uses steroids to win in a footrace, one is said not to deserve to win (Y) because one is not responsible for, and so does not deserve, one's enhanced physical abilities (Z).

==Controversies around Rawls dismissal of the concept of desert==
One of the most controversial rejections of the concept of desert was made by the political philosopher [[John Rawls]]. Rawls, writing in the mid to late twentieth century, claimed that a person cannot claim credit for being born with greater natural endowments (such as superior intelligence or athletic abilities), as it is purely the result of the 'natural lottery'. Therefore, that person does not morally deserve the fruits of his or her talents and/or efforts, such as a good job or a high salary. However, Rawls was careful to explain that, even though he dismissed the concept of moral Desert, people can still legitimately expect to receive the benefits of their efforts and/or talents. The distinction here lies between Desert and, in 
Rawls' own words, 'Legitimate Expectations'.&lt;ref&gt;See Rawls, John (1972), ''A Theory of Justice'', Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Rawls' remarks about natural endowments provoked an often-referred response by [[Robert Nozick]]. Nozick claimed that to treat peoples' natural talents as collective assets is to contradict the very basis of the deontological liberalism Rawls wishes to defend, i.e. respect for the individual and the distinction between persons.&lt;ref&gt;Nozick, Robert (1974), ''Anarchy, State, and Utopia'', New York: Basic Books, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Nozick argued that Rawls' suggestion that not only natural talents but also virtues of character are undeserved aspects of ourselves for which we cannot take credit, "can succeed in blocking the introduction of a person's autonomous choices and actions (and their results) only by attributing everything noteworthy about the person completely to certain sorts of 'external' factors. So denigrating a person's autonomy and prime responsibility for his actions is a risky line to take for a theory that otherwise wishes to buttress the dignity and self-respect of autonomous beings."&lt;ref&gt;Nozick, Robert (1974), ''Anarchy, State, and Utopia'', New York: Basic Books, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Nozick's critique has been interpreted in different ways. The conventional understanding of it is as a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] assessment of procedural justice, which maintains that while it might be true that people's actions are wholly or partly determined by factors that are morally arbitrary, this is irrelevant to assignments of distributive shares.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Andrew (1999), "Rewarding Effort", ''The Journal of Political Philosophy'' 7: 404-418, at p. 406f.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals are self-owners with inviolable rights in their bodies and talents, and they have the freedom to take advantage of these regardless of whether the self-owned properties are theirs for reasons that are morally arbitrary or not.

Others have suggested that Rawls has entirely mistaken the very logic of desert.&lt;ref&gt;Zuckert, Michael (1981) Justice deserted: a critique of Rawls' "A Theory of Justice", Polity, Volume 13, Issue 3, Pages 466-483&lt;/ref&gt; If justice is getting what one is due, then the basis of desert must ultimately be undeserved. However, desert is a relational concept that expresses a relationship between a deserved{{clarify|date=July 2018}} and a basis of desert. It simply destroys the character of desert to demand, as Rawls does, that the basis of desert be itself deserved. For example, if we say a man deserves some primary good because of some quality or action "Y", we can always ask, as Rawls does, "but does he deserve 'Y'?" and so on. We then either have an infinite regress of bases of desert or arrive at some basis, some beginning point, which the individual cannot claim to have deserved or to be responsible for, but only to have or have been given by nature. After all, no human being exists [[causa sui]]; even to reduce the basis of claims to the very narrow one of life itself reveals Rawls' difficulty: surely no one can "deserve" or "claim credit for" their own existence.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

To demand, as Rawls does, that no just claim rest on an undeserved base simply means that we must cease speaking about justice, for on the basis of that demand there can never be any just claims - not even for equality.{{cn|date=July 2018}} Rawls' analysis of justice rests on a notion of desert which violates the concept of desert and therefore does not provide a more precise notion of the bases of desert, but rather dissolves entirely the concept of desert and with it justice.{{cn|date=July 2018}} The many debates over justice in political life and in philosophy concern the actual substantive question of what are the proper bases of desert.{{cn|date=July 2018}} That is, underlying every conception of justice must be a claim of right, a positive claim of desert.{{cn|date=July 2018}} The great failing of Rawls' argument is that he provides no substantive basis for a claim right or desert; but this failing is, paradoxically, also the source of the great appeal or excitement about Rawls' theory.{{cn|date=July 2018}} His approach seems to avoid the difficulties of the traditional debates and the value questions they necessarily raise and yet seems to enable him to discuss normative questions such as justice.&lt;ref&gt;Zuckert, Michael (1981), Justice deserted: a critique of Rawls' "A Theory of Justice", Polity, Volume 13, Issue 3, Pages 466-483&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jean Hampton==
Another, more unconventional{{cn|date=July 2018}} interpretation of Nozick's critique is proposed by [[Jean Hampton]]. She points out that there seems to be a subterranean assumption in Nozick's rejection of Rawls' account of natural endowments as collective assets. This assumption is the idea that the choices individuals make regarding how they will use their labor and their property are ones for which they should be held responsible. People who do not work hard and invest imprudently should be held responsible for those choices and not receive assistance from an egalitarian welfare state. If they do work hard and invest well however, they should also be held responsible for those choices and allowed to reap the benefits from their strivings. Hampton asks the question "whether the ground of Nozick's conception of absolute rights is not only a conception of liberty but also a conception of moral responsibility that is […] closely associated to our notion of liberty."&lt;ref&gt;Hampton, Jean (1997), ''Political Philosophy'', Oxford: Westview Press, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other political philosophers who endorse the position Hampton outlines. Their main observation is that sometimes people who are badly off might be so because of their own irresponsible conduct, and the charge is that theories favoring policies of redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor ignore this crucial point, i.e. that people might be unequally deserving because of their actions.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kekes, John (1997)'' Against Liberalism'', New York: Cornell University Press, p. 132f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
Sometimes the claim is that the redistributive systems often favored by [[egalitarian]] political theorists might have disastrous consequences in that they promote sloth and allow free riding on the productive by the lazy. These arguments are ''instrumental'' in their appeal to undeservingness. They refer to the allegedly bad consequences of a redistributive social system and do not necessarily involve any reference to the moral worthiness of those who make greater efforts, wiser investments, and so on.

At other times however, the argument invokes a moral ideal holding desert valuable for its own sake. On this view, helping the undeserving and failing to help the deserving is deemed ''intrinsically'' unfair regardless of further consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Arneson, Richard J. (1997), "Egalitarianism and the Undeserving Poor", ''The Journal of Political Philosophy'' 5: 327-350, at pp. 330f.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the charge against Rawls is that people actually might deserve the gains flowing from their natural endowments, or at least those they achieve by striving conscientiously.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kernohan, Andrew (1993), "Desert and Self-Ownership", ''Journal of Value Inquiry'' 27: 197-202, at p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Destructive dilemma'''&lt;ref&gt;Hurley, Patrick. A Concise Introduction to Logic With Ilrn Printed Access Card. Wadsworth Pub Co, 2008. Page 361&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore and Parker&lt;/ref&gt; is the name of a [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[rule of inference]] of [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]]. It is the [[inference]] that, if ''P'' implies ''Q'' and ''R'' implies ''S'' and either ''Q'' is false or ''S'' is false, then either ''P'' or ''R'' must be false. In sum, if two [[material conditional|conditionals]] are true, but one of their [[consequent]]s is false, then one of their [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]]s has to be false. ''Destructive dilemma'' is the [[Logical disjunction|disjunctive]] version of ''[[modus tollens]]''. The disjunctive version of ''[[modus ponens]]'' is the [[constructive dilemma]]. The rule can be stated:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P \to Q, R \to S, \neg Q \lor \neg S}{\therefore \neg P \lor \neg R}&lt;/math&gt;

where the rule is that wherever instances of "&lt;math&gt;P \to Q&lt;/math&gt;", "&lt;math&gt;R \to S&lt;/math&gt;", and "&lt;math&gt;\neg Q \lor \neg S&lt;/math&gt;" appear on lines of a proof, "&lt;math&gt;\neg P \lor \neg R&lt;/math&gt;" can be placed on a subsequent line.

==Formal notation==
The ''destructive dilemma'' rule may be written in [[sequent]] notation:

: &lt;math&gt;(P \to Q), (R \to S), (\neg Q \lor \neg S) \vdash (\neg P \lor \neg R)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; is a [[metalogic]]al symbol meaning that &lt;math&gt;\neg P \lor  \neg R&lt;/math&gt; is a [[logical consequence|syntactic consequence]] of &lt;math&gt;P \to Q&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R \to S&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\neg Q \lor \neg S&lt;/math&gt; in some [[formal system|logical system]];

and expressed as a truth-functional [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] or [[theorem]] of propositional logic:

:&lt;math&gt;(((P \to Q) \land (R \to S)) \land (\neg Q \lor \neg S)) \to (\neg P \lor \neg R)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are propositions expressed in some [[formal system]].

==Natural language example==

:If it rains, we will stay inside.
:If it is sunny, we will go for a walk.
:Either we will not stay inside, or we will not go for a walk, or both.
:Therefore, either it will not rain, or it will not be sunny, or both.

==Origins==
Von Hausswolff and Elggren formed the name out of their own names and define the country as being the [[border]]s of other countries. The decision to found the country and name themselves kings was in reaction to Sweden still having a monarchy.&lt;ref name=venice&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/09/arts/design/09bien.html|title=At Venice Biennale, Artists Plant Flag for Their State (of Mind)|work=New York Times|last=Kennedy|first=Randy|date=June 9, 2007|accessdate=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country was announced in an advert in ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' newspaper. It was announced on May 27, 1992.&lt;ref name=exist&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ThnYCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT221|title=An Atlas of Countries That Don't Exist: A compendium of fifty unrecognized and largely unnoticed states|last=Middleton|first=Nick|date=November 5, 2015|publisher=Pan Macmillan|page=221|accessdate=June 22, 2016|isbn=9781447295297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Scandinavian artists have had micronations, such as [[Lars Vilks]]' [[Ladonia (micronation)|Ladonia]].&lt;ref name=expressen/&gt;

Elgaland-Vargaland has a flag&lt;ref name=nowandthen/&gt; and national anthem, issues passports and stamps on request, and has had a number of "embassies" (art exhibitions).&lt;ref name=venice/&gt; Elggren often invokes "the image of a street-corner lunatic with a paper crown who declares himself King".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lN85AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=elgaland&amp;dq=elgaland|title=Micro-bionic: Radical Electronic Music and Sound Art in the 21st Century|first1=Thomas|last1=Bey|first2=William|last2=Bailey|publisher=Creation Books|date=2009|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1994, they opened a "general consulate" at [[Thomas Nordanstad Gallery]] in New York and applied for membership of the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New Art Examiner|volume=25|issue=7-10|page=23|date=1998|publisher=New Art Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, on the tenth anniversary, a group of 10 travelled from Sweden to Estonia carrying only Elgaland-Vargaland passports - they were detained and their passports confiscated, and they were returned to Sweden the next day. They had planned to be turned away from each country in turn, indefinitely.&lt;ref name=exist/&gt; The same year, they released a musical album titled "The kingdoms of Elgaland-Vargaland, 1992-2002", published by Ash International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kudosrecords.co.uk/release/ash6.6/various-artists-the-kingdoms-of-elgaland-vargaland.html|title=Various Artists, The Kingdoms of Elgaland Vargaland|work=Ash International|date=July 15, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Elgaland-Vargaland attended a conference of micronations in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variant.org.uk/events/Market30/MM_Market.pdf|title=Between a Rock and a Hard Place – The Possibilities for Contemporary Art Institutions to Function as Critical Political Spaces|last=Muukkonen|first=Marita|date=2007|work=Variant.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2007, the country had around 850 citizens&lt;ref name=venice/&gt; and by 2014 they claimed 980 citizens.&lt;ref name=nowandthen&gt;{{cite news|url=http://artforum.com/diary/id=46029|title=Now and Then|last=Yablonsky|first=Linda|date=March 31, 2014|work=Art Forum|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 they had 20 ambassadors;&lt;ref name=venice/&gt; the embassy in Reykjavik opened in 1994 at the Nýlistasafninu (Museum of Fine Arts)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/131237/|title=Konungsríkin Elgaland - Vargaland|work=Morgunbladid|date=March 26, 1994|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the embassy in Berlin was opened in 2006 at the [[Haus der Kulturen der Welt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hkw.de/en/programm/projekte/veranstaltung/p_13838.php|title=The Opening of the Embassy of the Kingdom of Elgaland-Vargaland|work=HKW|date=October 21, 2006|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Moroccan embassy opened in 2014 before the [[Marrakech Biennale]].&lt;ref name=nowandthen/&gt; A "Consulate General" was held at [[Gallery 400]] in Chicago for two months in 2007-8 as part of the city's Festival of Maps.&lt;ref name=gallery400/&gt; They have a number of Ministers, mainly artists, including trumpeter Greg Kelley who is Minister of Fanfares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gapersblock.com/transmission/2011/11/16/a_curious_of_crowns_leif_elggren_at_lampo/|title=A Curious of Crowns: Leif Elggren at Lampo|work=Transmission|publisher=Gapers Block|date=November 16, 2011|last=Sienko|first=Chris|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The claims extend to other "interstitial territories" such as the transition from being asleep to wakefulness (the hypnogogic state),&lt;ref name=mass/&gt; and [[limbo]]&lt;ref name=exist/&gt; and they also regard all dead people as being citizens. In 2007, they declared at the [[Venice Biennale]] that they had annexed the [[Isola di San Michele]], an island cemetery.&lt;ref name=venice/&gt; This annexation project appeared at the Gallery Niklas Belenius in 2008.&lt;ref name=expressen&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.expressen.se/kultur/konst/elgaland-vargaland--galleri-niklas-belenius/|title=Elgaland-Vargaland / Galleri Niklas Belenius|work=Expressen|date=March 12, 2008|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
KREV has been described as an art project that criticises the principles of the nation state and von Hausswolff and Elggren has, with the projects hierarchical diagram, clearly stated their disgust towards any kind of racism, fascism and oligarchy.

The term '''empowerment''' refers to measures designed to increase the degree of autonomy and self-determination in people and in communities in order to enable them to represent their interests in a responsible and self-determined way, acting on their own authority. It is the process of becoming stronger and more confident, especially in controlling one's life and claiming one's rights. Empowerment as action refers both to the process of self-empowerment and to professional support of people, which enables them to overcome their sense of powerlessness and lack of influence, and to recognize and use their resources. To do work with power.

The term empowerment originates from American [[community psychology]] and is associated{{by whom|date=June 2016}} with the social scientist [[Julian Rappaport]] (1981).&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport, Julian. In praise of paradox. A social policy of empowerment over prevention, in: American Journal of Community Psychology, Vol. 9 (1), 1981, 1–25 (13)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the roots of empowerment theory extend further into history and are linked to Marxist sociological theory. These sociological ideas have continued to be developed and refined through Neo-Marxist Theory (also known as Critical Theory).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compsy.org.uk/rethemp.htm|title=Rethinking empowerment: shared action against powerlessness|last=Burton &amp; Kagan|first=|date=1996|website=compsy.org.uk|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[social work]], empowerment forms a practical approach of resource-oriented intervention. In the field of [[citizenship education (subject)|citizenship education]] and [[democratic education]], empowerment is seen{{by whom|date=June 2016}} as a tool to increase the responsibility of the citizen. Empowerment is a key concept in the discourse on promoting [[civic engagement]]. Empowerment as a concept, which is characterized by a move away from a [[wikt:deficit|deficit]]-oriented towards a more strength-oriented perception, can increasingly be found in management concepts, as well as in the areas of [[continuing education]] and [[self-help]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Definitions==
Robert Adams points to the limitations of any single definition of 'empowerment', and the danger that academic or specialist definitions might take away the word and the connected practices from the very people they are supposed to belong to.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert. ''Empowerment, participation and social work''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, he offers a minimal definition of the term: 
'Empowerment: the capacity of individuals, groups and/or communities to take control of their circumstances, exercise power and achieve their own goals, and the process by which, individually and collectively, they are able to help themselves and others to maximize the quality of their lives.'&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert. ''Empowerment, participation and social work''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, p.xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

One definition for the term is "an intentional, ongoing process centered in the local community, involving mutual respect, critical reflection, caring, and group participation, through which people lacking an equal share of resources gain greater access to and control over those resources".&lt;ref&gt;Cornell Empowerment Group. (1989, October). Empowerment and family support. Networking Bulletin, 1(1)2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, M.A. (2000). Empowerment Theory: Psychological, Organizational and Community Levels of Analysis. "Handbook of Community Psychology," 43–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rappaport's (1984) definition includes: "Empowerment is viewed as a process: the mechanism by which people, organizations, and communities gain mastery over their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport, J. (1984). Studies in empowerment: Introduction to the issue. "Prevention in Human Services," 3, 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociological empowerment often addresses members of groups that social discrimination processes have excluded from decision-making processes through – for example – discrimination based on disability, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], ethnicity, religion, or gender. Empowerment as a methodology is also associated with [[feminism]].

==Process==
Empowerment is the process of obtaining basic opportunities for [[marginalized]] people, either directly by those people, or through the help of non-marginalized others who share their own access to these opportunities. It also includes actively thwarting attempts to deny those opportunities. Empowerment also includes encouraging, and developing the skills for, [[self-sufficiency]], with a focus on eliminating the future need for [[Charity (practice)|charity]] or welfare in the individuals of the group. This process can be difficult to start and to implement effectively.

===Strategy===
One empowerment strategy is to assist marginalized people to create their own [[nonprofit organization]], using the rationale that only the marginalized people, themselves, can know what their own people need most, and that control of the organization by outsiders can actually help to further entrench marginalization. Charitable organizations lead from outside of the community, for example, can disempower the community by entrenching a dependence charity or welfare. A nonprofit organization can target strategies that cause structural changes, reducing the need for ongoing dependence. [[Red Cross]], for example, can focus on improving the health of indigenous people, but does not have authority in its charter to install water-delivery and purification systems, even though the lack of such a system profoundly, directly and negatively impacts health. A nonprofit composed of the indigenous people, however, could ensure their own organization does have such authority and could set their own agendas, make their own plans, seek the needed resources, do as much of the work as they can, and take responsibility – and credit – for the success of their projects (or the consequences, should they fail).

The process of which enables individuals/groups to fully access personal or collective power, authority and influence, and to employ that strength when engaging with other people, institutions or society. In other words, "Empowerment is not giving people power, people already have plenty of power, in the wealth of their knowledge and motivation, to do their jobs magnificently. We define empowerment as letting this power out."&lt;ref name=blanchard/&gt;  It encourages people to gain the skills and knowledge that will allow them to overcome obstacles in life or work environment and ultimately, help them develop within themselves or in the society.

To empower a female "...sounds as though we are dismissing or ignoring males, but the truth is, both genders desperately need to be equally empowered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccpa-accp.ca/blog/?p=2273|title=Encouraging and Empowering Girls - Canadian Counselling and Psychotherapy Association|date=13 July 2012|website=Ccpa-accp.ca|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Empowerment occurs through improvement of conditions, standards, events, and a global perspective of life.

===Criticism===
Before there can be the finding that a particular group requires empowerment and that therefore their self-esteem needs to be consolidated on the basis of awareness of their strengths, there needs to be a deficit diagnosis usually carried out by experts assessing the problems of this group. The fundamental asymmetry of the relationship between experts and clients is usually not questioned by empowerment processes. It also needs to be regarded critically, in how far the empowerment approach is really applicable to all patients/clients. It is particularly questionable whether [[mentally ill]] people in acute crisis situations are in a position to make their own decisions. According to Albert Lenz, people behave primarily regressive in acute crisis situations and tend to leave the responsibility to professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Lenz: ''Empowerment und Ressourcenaktivierung – Perspektiven für die psychosoziale Praxis.''&lt;/ref&gt; It must be assumed, therefore, that the implementation of the empowerment concept requires a minimum level of communication and reflectivity of the persons involved.

== In social work and community psychology ==
[[File:Altenheim 12.jpg|thumb|Empowerment in the work for senior citizens in a residential home in Germany]]
In [[social work]], empowerment offers an approach that allows social workers to increase the capacity for self-help of their clients. For example, this allows clients not to be seen as passive, helpless 'victims' to be rescued but instead as a self-empowered person fighting abuse/ oppression; a fight, in which the social worker takes the position of a facilitator, instead of the position of a 'rescuer'.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert. ''Empowerment, participation and social work''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, p.12ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marginalized people who lack self-sufficiency become, at a minimum, dependent on charity, or welfare.  They lose their self-confidence because they cannot be fully self-supporting.  The opportunities denied them also deprive them of the pride of accomplishment which others, who have those opportunities, can develop for themselves. This in turn can lead to psychological, social and even mental health problems. "[[Marginalized]]" here refers to the overt or covert trends within societies whereby those perceived as lacking desirable traits or deviating from the group norms tend to be excluded by wider society and ostracized as undesirables.

===In health promotion practice and research===
As a concept, and model of practice, empowerment is also used in health promotion research and practice.
The key principle is for individuals to gain increased control over factors that influence their health status &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.who.int/healthpromotion/about/HPR%20Glossary%201998.pdf|title= Health Promotion Glossary - World Health Organization|website=WHO.int|accessdate=4 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

To empower individuals and to obtain more equity in health, it is also important to address health-related behaviors &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.who.int/healthpromotion/about/HPR%20Glossary%201998.pdf|title= Health Promotion Glossary - World Health Organization|website=WHO.int|accessdate=4 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Studies suggest that health promotion interventions aiming at empowering adolescents should enable active learning activities, use visualizing tools to facilitate self-reflection, and allow the adolescents to influence intervention activities &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holmberg|first=Christopher|last2=Larsson|first2=Christel|last3=Korp|first3=Peter| last4=Lindgren|first4=Eva-Carin|last5=Jonsson|first5=Linus|last6=Fröberg|first6=Andreas|last7=Chaplin|first7=John E.|last8=Berg|first8=Christina|date=2018-07-04|title=Empowering aspects for healthy food and physical activity habits: adolescents’ experiences of a school-based intervention in a disadvantaged urban community|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17482631.2018.1487759|journal=International Journal of Qualitative Studies on Health and Well-being|volume=13|issue=sup 1|doi=10.1080/17482631.2018.1487759|}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==In economics==
According to Robert Adams, there is a long tradition in the UK and the USA respectively to advance forms of self-help that have developed and contributed to more recent concepts of empowerment. For example, the free enterprise economic theories of [[Milton Friedman]] embraced self-help as a respectable contributor to the economy. Both the Republicans in the US and the Conservative government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] built on these theories. 'At the same time, the mutual aid aspects of the concept of self-help retained some currency with socialists and democrats.'&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert. ''Empowerment, participation and social work''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, p.7-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[economic development]], the empowerment approach focuses on mobilizing the [[self-help]] efforts of the poor, rather than providing them with [[social welfare]]. Economic empowerment is also the empowering of previously disadvantaged sections of the population, for example, in many previously colonized African countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microempowering.org |title=Welcome to MicroEmpowering! |publisher=Microempowering.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increasingly engaged corporate directors===
The [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] has argued that large [[institutional investor]]s such as [[pension fund]]s and [[Financial endowment|endowment]]s are exercising a greater influence on the process of adding and replacing corporate directors – as they are themselves steered to do so by their own board members (pension trustees).

This could eventually put more pressure on the [[CEO]]s of [[public company|publicly listed companies]], as “more than ever before, many [North American], UK and European Union [[trustee|pension trustees]] speak enthusiastically about flexing their [[fiduciary]] muscles for the UN’s [[Sustainable Development Goals]]”, and other [[Environmental, social and corporate governance|ESG-centric]] investment practices &lt;ref name="pensions-expert1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=Greening, Governance and Growth in the Age of Popular Empowerment|url=http://www.pensions-expert.com/Special-Features/The-Cut/Greening-governance-and-growth-in-the-age-of-popular-empowerment|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=FT Pensions Experts|publisher=Financial Times|date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal==
Legal empowerment happens when marginalised people or groups use the [[legal mobilisation]] i.e., law, legal systems and justice mechanisms to improve or transform their social, political or economic situations. Legal empowerment approaches are interested in understanding how they can use the [[law]] to advance interests and priorities of the marginalised.&lt;ref name=odi&gt;{{cite web|title=The politics of legal empowerment: legal mobilisation strategies and implications for development|url=http://www.odi.org/publications/8485-legal-empowerment-mobilisation|website=Odi.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 'Open society foundations' (an NGO)  "Legal empowerment is about [[Capacity building|strengthening the capacity]] of all people to exercise their [[rights]], either as individuals or as members of a community. Legal empowerment is about grass root justice, about ensuring that [[law]] is not confined to books or courtrooms, but rather is available and meaningful to ordinary people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/projects/legal-empowerment|title=What Is Legal Empowerment?|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorenzo Cotula in his book ' ''Legal Empowerment for Local Resource Control'' ' outlines the fact that [[Law|legal tools]] for securing local resource rights are enshrined in legal system, does not necessarily mean that local resource users are in position to use them and benefit from them. The [[legal system|state legal system]] is constrained by a range of different factors – from lack of resources to cultural issues. Among these factors economic, geographic, linguistic and other constraints on access to courts, ''lack of [[legal awareness]] as well as [[legal aid|legal assistance]] '' tend to be recurrent problems.&lt;ref name=Cotula&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cotula|first1=Lorenzo|title=Legal Empowerment for Local Resource Control: Securing Local Resource Rights Within Foreign Investment Projects in Africa|date=1 Jan 2007|publisher=IIED, 2007|isbn=9781843696674|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-72KOAj92UgC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=legal%20awareness&amp;pg=PR2#v=onepage&amp;q=legal%20awareness&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many context, marginalised groups do not trust the legal system owing to the widespread manipulation that it has historically been subjected to by the more powerful. 'To what extent one knows the [[law]], and make it work for themselves with 'para legal tools',  is legal empowerment; assisted utilizing innovative approaches like [[legal literacy]] and awareness training, broadcasting [[legal information]], conducting participatory [[legal discourse]]s, supporting local resource user in negotiating with other agencies and stake holders and to strategies combining use of [[Legal proceeding|legal processes]] with [[advocacy]] along with media engagement, and socio [[legal mobilisation]].&lt;ref name=Cotula /&gt;

Sometimes groups are marginalized by society at large, with governments participating in the process of marginalization. [[Equal opportunity]] laws which actively oppose such marginalization, are supposed to allow empowerment to occur. These laws made it illegal to restrict access to schools and public places based on race. They can also be seen as a symptom of minorities' and [[women's empowerment]] through lobbying.

==Gender==
{{main|Gender empowerment|Women empowerment}}
[[Gender empowerment]] conventionally refers to the [[Women empowerment|empowerment of women]], which is a significant topic of discussion in regards to development and economics nowadays. It also points to approaches regarding other marginalized [[genders]] in a particular political or social context. This approach to empowerment is partly informed by [[feminism]] and employed legal empowerment by building on international [[human rights]]. Empowerment is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing [[human rights]] and [[International development|development]]. [[Capability Approach|The Human Development and Capabilities Approach]], [[The Millennium Development Goals]], and other credible approaches/goals point to empowerment and participation as a necessary step if a country is to overcome the obstacles associated with poverty and development.&lt;ref&gt;U.N. General Assembly, 55th Session. “United Nations Millennium Declaration.” (A/55/L.2).  8 September 2000. (Online) Available: www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.pdf (accessed January 2, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sustainable Development Goals|UN Sustainable Development Goals]] targets gender equality and women's empowerment for the global development agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/gender-equality/|title=United Nations: Gender equality and women's empowerment|website=Un.org|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In workplace management==
According to Thomas A. Potterfield,&lt;ref&gt;Potterfield, Thomas. "The Business of Employee Empowerment: Democracy and Ideology in the Workplace." Quorum Books, 1999, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; many organizational theorists and practitioners regard employee empowerment as one of the most important and popular [[Management fad|management concepts]] of our time.

Ciulla discusses an inverse case: that of [[Counterfeit|bogus]] empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Ciulla| first = Joanne B.| chapter = Leadership and the Problem of Bogus Empowerment| editor-last = Ciulla| editor-first = Joanne B.| title = Ethics, the heart of leadership| edition = 2| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| publication-date = 2004| isbn = 978-0-275-98248-5| quote = [...] in many organizations, promises of empowerment are bogus.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In management===
In the sphere of [[management]] and organizational theory, "empowerment" often refers loosely to processes for giving subordinates (or [[worker]]s generally) greater discretion and resources: distributing control in order to better serve both customers and the interests of employing organizations.

One account of the history of workplace empowerment in the [[United States of America|United States]] recalls the clash of management styles in railroad construction in the [[American West]] in the mid-19th century, where "traditional" hierarchical East-Coast models of control encountered individualistic pioneer workers, strongly supplemented by methods of [[efficiency]]-oriented "worker [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]]" brought to the scene by [[Chinese American|Chinese]] [[coolie|laborer]]s. In this case, empowerment at the level of work [[team]]s or brigades achieved a notable (but short-lived) demonstrated superiority. See the [http://www.motivation-tools.com/workplace/history.htm views] of Robert L. Webb.

Since the 1980s and 1990s, empowerment has become a point of interest in management concepts and business administration. In this context, empowerment involves approaches that promise greater participation and integration to the employee in order to cope with their tasks as independently as possible and responsibly can. A strength-based approach known as "empowerment circle" has become an instrument of organizational development. Multidisciplinary empowerment teams aim for the development of [[quality circles]] to improve the organizational culture, strengthening the motivation and the skills of employees. The target of subjective job satisfaction of employees is pursued through flat hierarchies, participation in decisions, opening of creative effort, a positive, appreciative team culture, self-evaluation, taking responsibility (for results), more self-determination and constant further learning. The optimal use of existing potential and abilities can supposedly be better reached by satisfied and active workers. Here, [[knowledge management]] contributes significantly to implement employee participation as a guiding principle, for example through the creation of [[communities of practice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hbr.org/2010/04/empowering-your-employees-to-e|title=Empowering Your Employees to Empower Themselves |publisher=hbr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is important to ensure that the individual employee has the skills to meet their allocated responsibilities and that the company's structure sets up the right incentives for employees to reward their taking responsibilities. Otherwise there is a danger of being overwhelmed or even becoming lethargic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hbr.org/1998/05/empowerment-the-emperors-new-clothes|title=Empowerment: The Emperor’s New Clothes |publisher=hbr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implications for company culture===
Empowerment of employees requires a culture of trust in the organization and an appropriate information and communication system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.atulhost.com/employee-empowerment|title=Employee Empowerment: The Key to Employee Satisfaction|publisher=AtulHost}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of these activities is to save control costs, that become redundant when employees act independently and in a self-motivated fashion. 
In the book ''Empowerment Takes More Than a Minute'', the authors illustrate three keys that organizations can use to open the knowledge, experience, and motivation power that people already have.&lt;ref name=blanchard/&gt; The three keys that managers must use to empower their employees are:
# [[information sharing|Share information]] with everyone
# Create [[autonomy]] through boundaries
# Replace the old hierarchy with [[self-directed work team]]s

According to Stewart, in order to guarantee a successful work environment, managers need to exercise the "right kind of [[authority]]" (p.&amp;nbsp;6).  To summarize, "empowerment is simply the effective use of a manager’s authority", and subsequently, it is a productive way to maximize all-around work [[efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Aileen Mitchell. ''Empowering People'' (Institute of Management). Pitman. London: Financial Times Management, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

These keys are hard to put into place and it is a journey to achieve empowerment in a workplace.  It is important to [[workplace training|train]] employees and make sure they have trust in what empowerment will bring to a company.&lt;ref name=blanchard&gt;{{cite book|author1=Blanchard, Kenneth H.|author2=John P. Carlos|author3=Alan Randolph|title=Empowerment Takes More than a Minute|publisher=San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implementation of the concept of empowerment in management has also been criticised for failing to live up to its claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hbr.org/2015/05/6-myths-about-empowering-employees|title=6 Myths About Empowering Employees |publisher=hbr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Age of Popular Empowerment?==

[[Marshall McLuhan]] insisted that the development of [[electronic media]] would eventually weaken the [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] structures that underpin central governments, large corporation, academia and, more generally, rigid, “[[Descartes|linear-Cartsesian”]] forms of social organization.&lt;ref name="youtube1977"&gt;{{cite news|last1= McLuhan|first1=Marshall|title=‘ABC TV Monday Conference: The Medium is the Message (Part 1)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImaH51F4HBw|accessdate=28 April 2018|work= ABC TV Monday Conference|publisher=ABC TV Monday Conference|date=27 June 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
From that perspective, new, “electronic forms of awareness” driven by [[information technology]] would empower citizen, employees and students by disseminating in [[real-time computing|near-real-time]] vast amounts of information once reserved to a small number of experts and specialists. Citizens would be bound to ask for substantially more say in the management of government affairs, production, consumption, and education &lt;ref name="youtube1977"/&gt;

[[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] economist Nicolas Firzli has argued that rapidly rising cultural tides, notably new forms of online engagement and increased demands for [[Environmental, social and corporate governance|ESG-driven]] public policies and managerial decisions are transforming the way governments and corporation interact with citizen-consumers in the “Age of Empowerment” &lt;ref name="pensions-expert1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14312">Environmental personhood is a legal concept which designates certain environmental entities the status of a [[legal person]]. This assigns to these entities, the [[rights]], protections, privileges, responsibilities and [[legal liability]] of a legal personality. Environmental personhood emerged from the evolution of legal focus in pursuit of the protection of [[nature]]. Over time, focus has evolved from human interests in exploiting nature, to protecting nature for future human generations, to conceptions that allow for nature to be protected as intrinsically valuable.&lt;ref&gt; Gwendolyn Gordon. "Environmental Personhood." (2017), at page 25.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept can be used as a vehicle for recognising [[Indigenous peoples]]' relationships to natural entities, such as rivers.&lt;ref&gt;James DK Morris and Jacinta Ruru. "Giving Voice to Rivers: Legal Personality as a Vehicle for Recognising Indigenous Peoples' Relationships to Water." ''AILR'' 14 (2010): 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental personhood, which assigns nature (or aspects of it) certain rights, concurrently provides a means to individuals or groups such as Indigenous peoples to fulfill their human rights.

==Background==

The [[United States]] Professor Christopher D. Stone first discussed the idea of attributing legal personality to natural objects in the 1970s, in his article "Should trees have standing? Towards legal rights for natural objects".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher D. Stone. "Should Trees Have Standing--Toward Legal Rights for Natural Objects." ''Southern California Law Review'' 45 (1972): 450.&lt;/ref&gt;  A legal person cannot be owned; therefore, no ownership can be attributed to an environmental entity with established legal personality. [[Standing (law)]] is directly related to legal personality. Entities with standing, or [[locus standi]], have the right or capacity to bring action or appear in court. Environmental entities cannot themselves bring action or appear in court. However, this action or standing can be achieved on behalf of the entity by a representing [[legal guardian]]. Representation could increase protection of culturally significant aspects of the natural environment, or areas vulnerable to exploitation and pollution.

In 2014, Te Urewera National Park was declared ''[[Te Urewera]]'', an environmental legal entity.&lt;ref&gt;Te Urewera Act 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  The area encompassed by ''Te Urewera'' ceased to be a government-owned national park and was transformed into freehold, inalienable land owned by itself.&lt;ref&gt;Te Urewera Act 2014, ss 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the same trend, [[New Zealand]]’s [[Whanganui River]] was declared to be a legal person in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Te Awa Tupua (Whanganui River Claims Settlement) Act 2017, s 14.&lt;/ref&gt; This new legal entity was named ''Te Awa Tupua'' and is now recognised as “an indivisible and living whole from the mountains to the sea, incorporating the Whanganui River and all of its physical and metaphysical elements.”&lt;ref&gt;Te Awa Tupua (Whanganui River Claims Settlement) Act 2017, s 13(b).&lt;/ref&gt; The river would be represented by two guardians, one from the Whanganui iwi and the other from the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/16/new-zealand-river-granted-same-legal-rights-as-human-being/.&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===

The [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] Rivers are now considered legal persons in an effort to combat pollution. The rivers are sacred to [[Hindu]] culture for their healing powers and attraction of [[pilgrims]] who bathe and scatter the ashes of their dead.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Susan Bliss. "A river is a 'person'." 49 ''Geography Bulletin'' No 2 (2017): 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The rivers have been heavily polluted by 1.5 billion litres of untreated sewage and 500 million litres of industrial waste entering the rivers daily.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/21/ganges-and-yamuna-rivers-granted-same-legal-rights-as-human-beings/.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The High Court in the northern Indian state of [[Uttarakhand]] ordered in March 2017 that the Ganges and its main tributary, the Yamuna, be assigned the status of legal entities. The rivers would gain “all corresponding rights, duties and liabilities of a living person.” This decision meant that polluting or damaging the rivers is equivalent to harming a person. The court cited the example of the New Zealand Whanganui River, which was also declared to possess full rights of a legal person.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/21/ganges-and-yamuna-rivers-granted-same-legal-rights-as-human-beings/.&lt;/ref&gt;

This development of environmental personhood has been met with scepticism as merely announcing that the Ganges and Yamuna are living entities will not save them from significant, ongoing pollution. There is a possible need to change long-held cultural attitudes towards the Ganges, which hold that the river has self-purifying properties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unep.org/stories/story/rights-rivers/.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is further criticism that the guardianship of the rivers was only granted to Uttarakhand, a region in northern India which houses a small part of the rivers’ full extent. The Ganges flows for 2,525km through Uttarakhand, [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]] and [[West Bengal]], with only a 96km stretch running through Uttarakhand. Only a small section of the 1,376km Yamuna tributary runs through Uttarakhand – which also crosses through the states of [[Haryana]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Delhi]] and Uttar Pradesh.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unep.org/stories/story/rights-rivers/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of scepticism surrounding the decision of the Uttarakhand High Court, proclaiming these vulnerable rivers as legal entities invokes a movement of change towards environmental and cultural rights protection. The decisions may be built upon as a foundation for future environmental legislative change. 

===United States===

In 2006, a small community in [[Pennsylvania]] called [[Tamaqua]] Borough worked with a rights of nature group called Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund.&lt;ref&gt;CELDF. https://celdf.org/.&lt;/ref&gt; Together, the groups drafted legislation to protect the community and its environment from the dumping of toxic sewage.&lt;ref&gt; Gwendolyn Gordon. "Environmental Personhood." (2017), at page 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2006, CELDF has assisted with over 30 communities in ten states across the United States to develop local laws codifying the rights of nature. CELDF also assisted in the drafting of Ecuador's 2008 constitution following a national referendum.&lt;ref&gt;CELDF, Rights of Nature: Timeline. https://celdf.org/rights/rights-of-nature/rights-nature-timeline/.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecuador===

The rights of nature “to exist, persist, maintain and regenerate its vital cycles” have been proclaimed under [[Ecuador]]’s [[2008 Constitution of Ecuador|2008 constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador (October 20, 2008), http://therightsofnature.org/wpcontent/uploads/pdfs/Rights-for-Nature-Articles-in-Ecuadors-Constitution.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred after a national referendum in 2008, allowing the Ecuador constitution to reflect rights for nature, a world first.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew C. Revkin, Ecuador Constitution Grants Rights to Nature, New York Times, (September 29, 2008), http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/29/ecuador-constitution-grants-nature-rights/.&lt;/ref&gt; Every person and community has the right to advocate on nature's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador (October 20, 2008), Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Constitution proclaims that the “State shall give incentives to natural persons and legal entities and to communities to protect nature and to promote respect for all the elements comprising an [[ecosystem]].”&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador (October 20, 2008), Article 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first successful case of the rights of nature implementation under Ecuador constitutional law was presented before the Provincial Court of Justice of [[Loja, Ecuador|Loja]] in 2011. This case involved the [[Vilcabamba, Ecuador|Vilcabamba]] River as the plaintiff, representing itself with its own rights to ‘exist’ and ‘maintain itself’ – as it attempted to halt construction of a government highway project interfering with the natural health of the river.This case was brought before court by two individuals, Richard Frederick Wheeler and Eleanor Geer Huddle, as legal guardians acting in favour of nature – specifically the Vilcabamba River. A constitutional injunction was granted in favour of the Vilcabamba River and against the Provincial government of Loja, attempting to conduct the environmentally-harmful project. The project was forced to be halted and the area was to be rehabilitated.&lt;ref&gt; Natalia Greene. "The first successful case of the Rights of Nature implementation in Ecuador." Global Alliance for the Rights of Nature. http://therightsofnature.org/first-ron-case-ecuador/.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bolivia===

The constitutional change in Ecuador was followed legislatively by [[Bolivia]] in 2010, passing the ‘[[Law of the Rights of Mother Earth]]’ (''Ley de Derechos de la Madre Tierra''). This legislation designates [[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]] the character of ‘a collective subject of [[public interest]]’&lt;ref&gt;Ley de Derechos de la Madre Tierra, December 2010, article 5.&lt;/ref&gt; with inherent rights specified in the law.&lt;ref&gt;Ley de Derechos de la Madre Tierra, December 2010, article 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Law of the Rights of Mother Earth give aspects of legal personhood to the natural environment. Judicial action can be taken for infringements against individuals and groups as part of Mother Earth as ‘a collective subject of public interest’.&lt;ref&gt;Ley de Derechos de la Madre Tierra, December 2010, article 6.&lt;/ref&gt;   The legislation states that “Mother Earth is the dynamic living system made up of the indivisible community of all living systems, living, interrelated, interdependent and complementary, sharing a common destiny.”&lt;ref&gt;Ley de Derechos de la Madre Tierra, December 2010, article 3.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Colombia===

The [[Colombia]] [[Constitutional Court of Colombia|Constitutional Court]] found in November 2016 that the [[Atrato River]] basin possesses rights to "protection, conservation, maintenance, and restoration." This ruling came about as a result of degradation to the river basin from mining, impacting nature and harming of Indigenous peoples and their culture. The court referred to the New Zealand declaration of the Whanganui River as a legal person holding environmental personhood. The court ordered that joint guardianship would be undertaken in the representation of the Atrato River basin. Similarly to the New Zealand declaration, the representatives would come from the national government and the Indigenous people living in the basin.&lt;ref&gt;https://celdf.org/2017/05/press-release-colombia-constitutional-court-finds-atrato-river-possesses-rights/.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court stated:
:“''(I)t is the human populations that are interdependent of the natural world – and not the opposite – and that they must assume the consequences of their actions and omissions with the nature. It is a question of understanding this new sociopolitical reality with the aim of achieving a respectful transformation with the natural world and its environment, as has happened before with civil and political rights…Now is the time to begin taking the first steps to effectively protect the planet and its resources before it is too late…''”&lt;ref&gt;https://celdf.org/2017/05/press-release-colombia-constitutional-court-finds-atrato-river-possesses-rights/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance for cultural human rights==

The recognition of the Whanganui River as a legal entity in New Zealand (''Te Awa Tupua'') encompassed a vivid sense of cultural “inalienable connection” to the local iwi and hapu of the river. Maori culture considers natural features such as the Whanganui River as ancestors and iwi hold deep connections with them as living entities. This inalienable connection of indigenous culture to their natural surroundings is apparent in other parts of the world such as Colombia where a similar environmental personhood declaration was made for the Atrato River basin.

The lead negotiator for the Whanganui iwi, Gerrard Albert, said “we consider the river an ancestor and always have…treating the river as a living entity is the correct way to approach it, as an indivisible whole, instead of the traditional model for the last 100 years of treating it from a perspective of ownership and management.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/16/new-zealand-river-granted-same-legal-rights-as-human-being/.&lt;/ref&gt; James D K Morris and Jacinta Ruru suggest that giving “legal personality to rivers is one way in which the law could develop to provide a lasting commitment to reconciling with Maori.” This was the longest-running legal dispute in New Zealand. The Whanganui iwi had been fighting to assert their rights in harmony with the river since the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;http://metro.co.uk/2017/03/16/whanganui-river-becomes-first-in-the-world-to-be-recognised-as-a-legal-person-6512264/.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a fundamental step forward for cultural rights as the environmental personhood status of the river means that if there was harm committed to the river, the law now sees no differentiation between harming the Whanganui iwi or harming the river as they are the same indivisible entity. The Whanganui iwi have a proverb which reads ''Ko au te Awa, ko te Awa ko au'': I am the River and the River is me - the iwi and hapu of the Whanganui River have an inalienable connection with, and responsibility to, ''Te Awa Tupua'' and its health and well-being.

The '''Gabo Reform''', also known as the '''Kabo Reform''', describes a series of sweeping reforms suggested to the government of [[Korea]] beginning in 1894 and ending in 1896 during the reign of [[Gojong of Korea]] in response to the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution]]. Historians debate the degree of Japanese influence in this program,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} as well as its effect in encouraging modernization. The name Gabo (갑오, 甲午) comes from the name of the year 1894 in the traditional [[sexagenary cycle]].&lt;ref name="gabo nate"&gt;{{ko icon}} [http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=B&amp;i=110660&amp;v=44 Gabo Reforms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610003901/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=B&amp;i=110660&amp;v=44 |date=2011-06-10 }} at Nate Britannica Korea&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The disarray and blatant corruption in the Korean government, particularly in the three main areas of revenues – land tax, military service and the state granary system – weighed heavily on the Korean peasantry which represented 90% of the population and was uniformly illiterate. Of special note is the corruption of the local functionaries (Hyangi) who could purchase an appointment as administrators and so cloak their predations on the farmers with an aura of officialdom. [[Yangban]] families, formerly well-respected for their status as a noble class, were increasingly seen as little more than commoners who were unwilling to meet their responsibilities to their communities. Faced with increasing corruption in the government, [[brigandage]] of the disenfranchised -(such as the mounted fire brigands, or ''Hwajok'', and the boat-borne water brigands or ''Sujok'')- as well as abuse by the military, many poor village folk sought to pool their resources such as land, tools and production in order to survive. Despite the government abolishing slavery and burning the records in 1801, increasing numbers of peasants and farmers become involved in KYE or "mutual assistance associations". Institutions such as the Catholic and Protestant missions, with the egalitarian nature of their teachings garnered followings among the Yangban, though commonly in the more urban areas.

Arguably of greater influence were the religious teachings of Choi Che-u, (최제우, 崔濟愚, 1824–1864) called [[Donghak]] or "Eastern Learning" which became especially popular in rural areas. Themes of Exclusionism (of foreign influences), Nationalism, Salvation and Social Consciousness were set to music allowing illiterate farmers to understand and accept them more readily. Choe, as well as many Koreans, was also alarmed by the intrusion of Christianity and the Anglo-French occupation of Beijing during the 2nd Opium War. He believed that the best way to counter foreign influence in Korea was to introduce democratic and human rights reforms internally. Nationalism and social reform struck a chord among the peasant guerrillas, and [[Donghak]] spread all across Korea. Progressive revolutionaries organized the peasants into a cohesive structure. Arrested in 1863 following the Chinju Uprising led by YU Kye-cheun, Choe was charged with "misleading the people and sowing discord in society". Choe was executed in 1864, sending many of his followers into hiding in the mountains and leaving the Korean populace to continue to suffer.

[[Gojong of Korea|King Kojong]] (r. 1864-1910), enthroned at the age of twelve, succeeded [[Cheoljong of Joseon|King Cheolchong]] (r. 1849 - 1863). King Kojong's father, [[Heungseon Daewongun]](Yi Ha-Ung; 1820-1898), ruled as the de facto regent and inaugurated far-ranging reform to strengthen the central administration.  Among his targeted reforms was addressing the inherited rule by a few elite ruling families by the adoption of a merit system for official appointments. In addition, [Seowon] (private academies), which threatened to develop a parallel system to the corrupt government and enjoyed special privileges and large land-holdings, were repressed through taxes despite bitter opposition from Confucian scholars. The decision to rebuild palace buildings and finance it through additional levies on the population caused [[Heungseon Daewongun]]'s attempted reforms to antagonize the three largest constituencies supporting the government: the ruling elite, the Confucian scholars and the general population. [[Heungseon Daewongun]] was impeached in 1873 and forced into retirement by the supporters of [[Empress Myeongseong]].

On 27 February 1876, the [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876]], also known in Japan as the Japanese-Korea Treaty of Amity (Japanese language: 日朝修好条規 Nitchō-shūkōjōki, Korean language: 강화도조약 江華島條約 Ganghwado joyak) was signed. It was designed to open up Korea to Japanese trade, and the rights granted to Japan under the treaty were similar to those granted Western powers in Japan following the visit of Commodore Perry in 1854.[9]. However, the treaty ended Korea's status as a protectorate of China, forced open three Korean ports to Japanese trade, granted extraterritorial rights to Japanese citizens and was an unequal treaty signed under duress of the [[Unyo Incident|Unyo Incident of 1875]] (gunboat diplomacy).[9] Daewongun remained opposed to any concessions to Japan or the West, helped organize the Mutiny of 1882 [[Imo Incident]], an anti-Japanese outbreak against the Empress and her allies.&lt;ref name="Marius B. Jansen"&gt;Marius B. Jansen (April 1989). The Cambridge History of Japan Volume 5 The Nineteenth Century. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-22356-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Motivated by resentment of the preferential treatment given to newly trained troops, Daewongun's forces, or "old military", killed Japanese training cadre and attacked the Japanese [[legation]].&lt;ref name="Marius B.

Daewongun was restored to power briefly, only to be forcibly taken to China by Chinese troops dispatched to [[Seoul]] to prevent further disorder.&lt;ref name="Marius B. Jansen"/&gt; In August 1882, the Treaty of Chemulpo ([[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1882]]) idemnified the families of the Japanese victims, paid reparation to the Japanese government in the amount of 500,000 yen and allowed a company of Japanese guards to be stationed at the Japanese legation in Seoul.&lt;ref name="Marius B. Jansen"/&gt;

The struggle between Heungseon Daewongun's followers and those of Empress Myeongseong was further complicated by competition from a Korean independence faction known as the Progressive Party (Kaehwadang) as well as Conservative faction. While the former sought Japan's support, the latter sought China's support.&lt;ref name="Marius B. Jansen"/&gt; On 4 December 1884, the Korean independence group, assisted by the Japanese, attempted a coup (Kapsin Chongbyon; Coup d'État of 1884) and established a pro-Japanese government under the reigning king, dedicated to the independence of Korea from Chinese suzerainty.&lt;ref name="Marius B. Jansen"/&gt; However, this proved short-lived, as conservative Korean officials requested the help of Chinese forces stationed in Korea.&lt;ref name="Marius B. Jansen"/&gt; The coup was put down by Chinese troops, and a Korean mob killed both Japanese officers and Japanese residents in retaliation.&lt;ref name="Marius B. Jansen"/&gt; Some leaders of the independence faction, including [[Kim Okgyun]], fled to Japan, while others were executed.&lt;ref name="Marius B. Jansen"/&gt;

== Donghak revolution, and first Sino-Japanese war, 1894 ==
{{Main|Donghak Peasant Revolution|First Sino-Japanese War}}

The outbreak of the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution]] in 1894 provided a seminal pretext for direct military intervention by Japan in the affairs of Korea. Seeking redress of long-standing hardship and corruption disparate factions among the Korean peasant population coalesced into a militant force and revolted against the Korean administration. In April, 1894 the Korean government asked for Chinese assistance in ending the Donghak Peasant Revolt. In response Japanese leaders, citing a violation of Convention of Tientsin as a pretext, decided upon military intervention to challenge China. China requested Japan withdraw her troops, Japan refused and proposed that the Qing and Japan co-ordinate to reform the Korean government. The Qing refused. On May 3, 1894, 1,500 Qing Dynasty forces appeared in Incheon. The same day, 6,000 Japanese forces also landed in Incheon leading to the Sino-Japanese War.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Japan deposed the Korean government and installed a new government which demanded the Qing leave, and began a programme of reform. Japan won the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], and China signed the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] in 1895. Among its many stipulations, the treaty recognized "the full and complete independence and autonomy of Korea," thus ending Korea's [[Tributary state|tributary]] relationship with the Chinese Qing Dynasty, leading to the proclamation of full independence of Joseon Korea in 1895. At the same time, Japan suppressed the Donghak Revolution with Korean government forces. Though the revolt had been ended, the issues and complaints of the Korean peasant population remained unaddressed.

==Reforms==
The reforms were done largely in three stages, according to the changing members of the reform council and the involvement of Japan. There were three stages of development.

===First reforms===
The first reforms took place from July to October 1894, based on the original reform bill presented by Japanese ambassador [[Ōtori Keisuke|Otori Keisuke (大鳥圭介)]], that had been previously refused by the [[Joseon]] court and [[Qing dynasty]].&lt;ref name="gabo doosan"/&gt; As Japan was focused more on the Sino-Japanese War, many of the first reforms reflected the desired reforms of the progressive council members and some of the reforms demanded by the peasants of the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution]] did not go undenied.&lt;ref name="gabo nate"/&gt; The deliberate Council passed 210 reform bills by Kim Hongjip. At the first stage of reform, there was little interference from Japan.

Two-hundred and ten articles were established, most notably the restructuring of central government by greatly reducing the king's responsibilities and placing more power in the ''[[State Council of Joseon|Uijeongbu]]''. The ''gwageo'' system was abolished and replaced by a Japanese bureaucratic system. The administration of financial affairs were centralized, the taxation system redressed, a new monetary system allowed the use of Japanese currency, and the measurement system was changed to that of Japan.&lt;ref name="gabo doosan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gabo ktta"/&gt; 
Other social reforms were addressed as well; discrimination based on the class system, slavery, underage marriage were all banned and widows were granted the right to remarry. These reforms would legally change the traditional feudal system that had been followed for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name="gabo nate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gabo doosan"/&gt;

===Second reforms===
The second state of reform took place from December 1894 to July 1895. Japan closed down the ''Gunguk Gimucheo'' in December 1894 as the outcome of the Sino-Japanese War was leaning to their favor and set up a new coalition cabinet consisting of Kim Hongjip and Park Younghyo. The cabinet presented a new law, ''Hongbeom 14jo'' (홍범 14조, "Exemplary Rules" 14 articles), which proclaimed the severance of the subordinate relationship with China, abolishment of nepotism in government, restructure of government offices and their duties. With this law as foundation, 213 new articles were created.&lt;ref name="gabo nate"/&gt;
The names of ''[[State Council of Joseon|Uijeongbu]]'' and its subsidiaries were changed to the modern ''naegak'' (내각, cabinet) and ''bu'' (부, department). Administrative districts were reorganized to 23 ''bu''(부, region) and 337 ''gun''(군, district). New financial bureaus were installed throughout the nation to overlook tax affairs, military and police systems were rehauled and modernized, judicial systems were changed with new courthouse and judiciary laws.&lt;ref name="gabo daum"&gt;{{ko icon}} [http://enc.daum.net/dic100/contents.do?query1=b01g1339a Gabo Reforms] at Daum Britannica Korea&lt;/ref&gt;

The second reform measures were halted when Park Young Hyo, who had been at the center of the reform efforts, fled to Japan after being accused of conspiracy to treason by those who were against the reformations that were taking place.&lt;ref name="gabo nate"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ko icon}} Kang Junman (강준만), ''Walk through Korea's Modern History 2'' (한국근대사산책 2) p291, [http://inmul.co.kr/ Inmul Publishing Co.(인물과 사상사)], Seoul, 2007. {{ISBN|978-89-5906-072-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assassination of Queen Min, 1895 ===
{{Main|Empress Myeongseong}}
The Japanese minister to Korea, [[Miura Gorō]], orchestrated a plot against 43-year-old Queen Min&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gkn-la.net/history_resources/queen_min.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217083556/http://www.gkn-la.net/history_resources/queen_min.htm |archivedate=2006-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he heard the news, [[Heungseon Daewongun]] returned to the royal palace the same day.&lt;ref name="Dong-a 2002"/&gt; On 11 February 1896, King Gojong and the crown prince moved from Gyeongbokgung to the [[Russia]]n legation in [[Jeong-dong]], Seoul, from where they governed for about one year, an event known as the [[Korea royal refuge at the Russian legation]]. After returning to the royal palace, the royal family was still guarded by Russian guards.

In the midst of disarray in Joseon politics at this time, a series of [[Seonbi]] scholars mobilized volunteers to fight against the external foreign influence on the government. This also led to the uprising of the Eulmi temporary armies aimed at avenging the assassination of Queen Min.

===Third reforms===
Spurred greatly by the assassination of the queen and subsequent unrest, the government, then led by a new progressive cabinet headed by [[Kim Hong-jip]] and [[Yu Kil-chun]], carried out reforms from October 1895 to February 1896.{{sfn|Kang|2006|p=483}}&lt;ref name="gabo doosan"&gt;{{ko icon}} [http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=4790 Gabo Reforms] at [[Doosan Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gabo ktta"&gt;''Korea through the Ages Vol. 2'' p40-p43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books id=XB4UYXNQK1wC&amp;pg=PA483&amp;lpg=PA483&amp;dq=Gabo+reforms+Kim+Hong+jip&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8Y64Oh8n2h&amp;sig=WaF0OZsvJAANg-ispTdZ6V_Be3c&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; A special reform body, ''Gunguk Gimucheo'' (군국기무처, Deliberative Council), was created to establish rules.&lt;ref name="gabo ktta"/&gt; Their policies resulted in the official discarding of the [[lunar calendar]] in favor of the modern Gregorian [[solar calendar]], the official designation of [[regnal years]] independent of the Chinese tradition, the creation of a [[mail|postal service]], the introduction of primary schools and a new educational system&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/special/2010/04/181_24875.html Gabo Reforms], [[Korea Times]], 2008-05-28. Retrieved 2010-06-23&lt;/ref&gt; and the renewal of the military system.&lt;ref name="gabo doosan"/&gt;

The most controversial reform at this time was the proclamation of the "Short Hair Act" ({{korean|hangul=단발령|hanja=斷髮令}}), i.e. cutting off the traditional Korean male sangtu and reformation of traditional attire. It triggered many protests among the people, most notably the conservative scholars, who were already disillusioned by the pro-Japanese cabinet. They had created the [[Righteous Army]] and had actively protested nationwide; protests which escalated after the assassination of Empress Myeongseong in 1895. After King Gojong and the [[Sunjong of Korea|Crown Prince]] fled for refuge to the [[Korea royal refuge at the Russian legation|Russian legation]] in 1896, this opposition resulted in the murders of Kim Hongjip and other cabinet members, and the reformations came to an end.{{sfn|Kang|2006|p=483}}&lt;ref name="gabo nate"/&gt;

===Main provisions of the Gabo Reform===
The Gabo Reform was similar to the [[Meiji Restoration]] in [[Japan]] and produced the following sweeping changes and declarations:&lt;ref name="gabo ktta"/&gt;
# Korea is a sovereign country (i.e., completely independent from [[China]]'s external interference).
# Hierarchical society ([[social class|class]] system) is abolished. Social privileges of the yangban class are eliminated.
# Those with talent are to be allowed to study and appointed to government posts based on merit alone, regardless of social class.
# The army is to be established on the basis of conscription, regardless of background. A modern police force and military are established.
# All official documents are to be written in [[Hangul]], and not [[hanja]] (Chinese characters).
# [[Tanning (leather)|Leather working]], [[acting]], and so on are to no longer be regarded as degrading work, and the people who do them are no longer outcastes. 
# A sound system of fiscal management and to use the government's fiscal resources to create wealth for the country is developed.
# Torture of suspects and witnesses was banned, guilt by association ended (punishment of family members of criminals)
# End of merchant monopolies
# Ban of sale of slaves from 1886 confirmed, and all forms of [[slavery in Korea|legal slavery]] ended
# Marriage age raised to twenty for men, sixteen for women (outlawing child marriage)

=== Protests for democracy and the proclamation of Korean Empire, 1896-1898 ===
{{Main|Independence Club|Korean Empire}}
After the Royal Refuge, some Korean activists established the [[Independence Club]] (독립협회, 獨立協會) in 1896. They claimed that Korea should negotiate with Western powers, particularly Russia, to counterbalance the growing influence of Japan and Russia. This club had contributed to the construction of [[Independence Gate]], and they held regular meetings at the [[Jongno]] streets, demanding [[democracy|democratic]] reforms as Korea became a constitutional monarchy, and an end to Japanese and Russian influence in Korean affairs. In October 1897, King Gojong decided to return to his other palace, [[Deoksugung]], and proclaimed the founding of the [[Korean Empire]]. During this period, the Korean government conducted a westernization policy. It was not an enduring reform, however, and the Independence Club was dissolved on 25 December 1898 as [[Emperor Gojong]] officially announced a prohibition on unofficial congresses.

The term '''''in loco parentis''''', [[Latin]] for "in the place of a parent"&lt;ref name="law.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.law.com/default2.asp?typed=in+loco+parentis&amp;type=1&amp;submit1.x=86&amp;submit1.y=20&amp;submit1=Look+up |title=Law.com Law Dictionary - ''in loco parentis'' |accessdate=2008-09-03 |work= |publisher=Law.com |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the legal responsibility of a person or organization to take on some of the functions and responsibilities of a [[parent]].  Originally derived from English [[common law]], it is applied in two separate areas of the law.

First, it allows institutions such as colleges and schools to act in the best interests of the [[student]]s as they see fit, although not allowing what would be considered violations of the students' [[civil liberties]].&lt;ref name="law.com" /&gt;

Second, this doctrine can provide a non-biological parent to be given the legal rights and responsibilities of a biological parent if they have held themselves out as the parent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2007/02/utah-high-court-denies-parental-rights.php An example of family law ''in loco parentis''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421152559/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2007/02/utah-high-court-denies-parental-rights.php |date=21 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''in loco parentis'' doctrine is distinct from the doctrine of ''[[parens patriae]]'', the psychological parent doctrine, and [[adoption]].&lt;ref name="In Loco Parentis -- Quaqua Society"&gt;[http://www.quaqua.org/inlocoparentis.htm In Loco Parentis -- Quaqua Society&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary and secondary education==
[[Cheadle Hulme School]], founded in Manchester, England, in 1855, adopted ''in loco parentis'' as its motto, well before the world's first public education act, the [[Elementary Education Act 1870]]. The school was established to educate and care for orphans and children of distressed parents.

{{cn span|date=February 2017|text=''In loco parentis'' had only precedent legal meaning for [[ward of court|wards of court]]. The founding of Cheadle Hulme School, otherwise known as Manchester Warehousemen and Clerks Orphans Schools, became the first time the expression was used with legal standing in the educational field.}}

The first major limitation to this came in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette]]'' (1943), in which the court ruled that students cannot be forced to salute the [[flag of the United States|American flag]].  More prominent change came in the 1960s and 1970s in such cases as ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]'' (1969), when the Supreme Court decided that "conduct by the student, in class or out of it, which for any reason - whether it stems from time, place, or type of behavior - materially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others is, of course, not immunized by the constitutional guarantee of [[freedom of speech]]."  Adult speech is also limited by "time, place and manner" restrictions and therefore such limits do not rely on schools acting in loco parentis.

In ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]'' (1969), the Supreme Court held that for school officials to justify censoring speech, they "must be able to show that [their] action was caused by something more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint," allowing schools to forbid conduct that would "materially and substantially interfere with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school." The Court found that the actions of the Tinkers in wearing armbands did not cause disruption and held that their activity represented constitutionally protected symbolic speech.

In ''[[New Jersey v. T.L.O.]]'' (1985) Justice White wrote:  "In carrying out searches and other disciplinary functions pursuant to such policies, school officials act as representatives of the State, not merely as surrogates for the parents, and they cannot claim the parents' immunity from the strictures of the Fourth Amendment."  The case upheld the search of a purse while on public school property based upon reasonable suspicion, indicating there is a balancing between the student's legitimate [[expectation of privacy]] and the public school's interest in maintaining order and discipline.   However, in ''[[Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier]]'' (1987) the Supreme Court ruled that "[[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights of students in the public schools are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings, and must be applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment" and schools may censor school-sponsored publications (such as a school newspaper) if content is "...inconsistent with its basic educational mission."  Other student issues such as school [[dress code]]s along with locker, cell phone, and personal laptop computer searches by public school officials have not yet been tested in the Supreme Court.

Private institutions are given significantly more authority over their students than public ones, and are generally allowed to arbitrarily dictate rules.  In the [[Kentucky Supreme Court|Kentucky State Supreme Court]] case ''[[Gott v. Berea College]]'' (1913), it was upheld that a "college or university may prescribe requirements for admission and rules for the conduct of its students, and one who enters as a student implicitly agrees to conform to such rules of government", while publicly funded institutions could not claim the same ability.

In ''Morse v. Frederick'' (2007) Justice [[Clarence Thomas]], concurring with the majority, argued that ''Tinker's'' ruling contradicted "the traditional understanding of the judiciary's role in relation to public schooling," and ignored the history of public education (127 S.Ct. 2634).  He believed the judiciary's role to determine whether students have freedom of expression was limited by ''in loco parentis''.  He cited ''[[Lander v. Seaver]]'' (1859), which held that ''in loco parentis'' allowed schools to punish student expression that the school or teacher believed contradicted the school's interests and educational goals.  This ruling declared that the only restriction the doctrine imposed were acts of legal malice or acts that caused permanent injury.  Neither of these were the case with Tinker.

==Higher education==
Though ''in loco parentis'' continues to apply to primary and secondary education in the U.S., application of the concept has largely disappeared in [[higher education]]. This was not always the case.

Prior to the 1960s, undergraduates were subject to many restrictions on their private lives. Women were generally subject to [[curfew]]s as early as 10:00, and dormitories were sex-segregated. Some universities expelled students—especially female students—who were somehow "morally" undesirable. More importantly, universities saw fit to restrict [[freedom of speech]], on campus, often forbidding organizations out of favor or with different views from speaking, organizing, demonstrating, or otherwise acting on campus. These restrictions were severely criticized by the student movements of the 1960s, and the [[Free Speech Movement]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] formed partly on account of them, inspiring students elsewhere to step up their opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Movement and the Sixties |last=Anderson |first=Terry H. |authorlink=Terry H. Anderson |year=1996|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-510457-8 |pages= }}{{page needed|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The landmark 1961 case ''[[Dixon v. Alabama]]'' was the beginning of the end for ''in loco parentis'' in U.S. higher education.  The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] found that [[Alabama State University|Alabama State College]] could not summarily expel students without due process.  However, that still does not prevent students who exercise their rights from being subject to more legal action for violation of institutional rules.&lt;ref name=bluto&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoover |first=Eric |date=5 September 2008 |title='Animal House' at 30: O Bluto, Where Art Thou? |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Animal-House-at-30-O/28169 |journal=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=34–35}}

Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://db19.linccweb.org/login?url=http://go.galegroup.com.db19.linccweb.org/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;u=lincclin_pbcc&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA381285571&amp;asid=99b4d2ef6464c5ca16122775ce082415&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

First, cognitive processes imply the understanding of situational and environmental aspects of intercultural interactions and the application of intercultural awareness, which is affected by the understanding of the self and own culture. Self-awareness in intercultural situations refers to the ability of self-monitoring in such interactions to censor anything not acceptable to another culture. On the other hand, cultural awareness leads the individual to an understanding of how his/her own culture determines feelings, thoughts, and personality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raţă, G. (2016). Intercultural Development through Intercultural Awareness and Cultural Briefing. ''Scientific Papers: Animal Science &amp; Biotechnologies / Lucrari Stiintifice: Zootehnie Si Biotehnologii'', ''49''(1), 284-288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, affective processes define the emotions that span during intercultural interactions. These emotions are strongly related to self-concept, open-mindedness, non-judgementalism, and social relaxation. In general, positive emotions generate respect for other cultures and their differences.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Finally, behavioral processes refer to how effectively and appropriately the individual directs actions to achieve goals. Actions during intercultural interactions are influenced by the ability to clearly convey a message, proficiency with the foreign language, flexibility and management of behavior, and social skills.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Creating intercultural competence ==
Intercultural competence is determined by the presence of cognitive, affective, and behavioral abilities that directly shape communication across cultures. These essential abilities can be separated into five specific skills that are obtained through education and experience:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# Mindfulness: the ability of being cognitively aware of how the communication and interaction with others is developed. It is important to focus more in the process of the interaction than its outcome while maintaining in perspective the desired communication goals. For example, it would be better to formulate questions such as "What can I say or do to help this process?" rather than "What do they mean?"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# Cognitive flexibility: the ability of creating new categories of information rather than keeping old categories. This skill includes opening to new information, taking more than one perspective, and understanding personal ways of interpreting messages and situations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ciairano, S., Bonino, S., &amp; Miceli, R. (2006). COGNITIVE FLEXIBILITY AND SOCIAL COMPETENCE FROM CHILDHOOD TO EARLY ADOLESCENCE. ''Cognitie, Creier, Comportament/Cognition, Brain, Behavior'', ''10''(3), 343-366.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Tolerance for ambiguity: the ability to maintain focus in situations that are not clear rather than becoming anxious and to methodically determine the best approach as the situation evolves. Generally, low-tolerance individuals look for information that supports their believes while high-tolerance individuals look for information that gives an understanding of the situation and others.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# Behavioral flexibility: the ability to adapt and accommodate behaviors to a different culture. Although knowing a second language could be important for this skill, it does not necessarily translate into cultural adaptability. The individual must be willing to assimilate the new culture.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carrard, V., &amp; Schmid Mast, M. (2015). Physician behavioral adaptability: A model to outstrip a "one size fits all" approach. ''Patient Education &amp; Counseling'', ''98''(10), 1243-1247. doi:10.1016/j.pec.2015.07.028&lt;/ref&gt;
# Cross-cultural empathy: the ability to visualize with the imagination the situation of another person from an intellectual and emotional point of view. Demonstrating empathy includes the abilities of connecting emotionally with people, showing compassion, thinking in more than one perspective, and listening actively.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chi-Ying Chung, R., &amp; Bemak, F. (2002). The Relationship of Culture and Empathy in Cross-Cultural Counseling. ''Journal Of Counseling &amp; Development'', ''80''(2), 154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen, P. B., &amp; Pope, m.

==History in American ethnic studies==

The United States in its earliest history had a culture influenced heavily by its Northern European population, primarily from the [[British Isles]], who originally settled in the original [[British colonization of the Americas|British Colonies]].  While the indigenous peoples, known as Indians, were the largest population of [[North America]], they were slowly pushed away from the Eastern Seaboard into the interior of North America during the 17th century, 18th century, and 19th century (see [[Indian Removal Act]] describing specific actions during early 19th century).  During this period, people from the British Isles (England and Scotland primarily) brought the culture and religion of the British Isles with them to the United States and became the dominant political and cultural group along the Eastern Seaboard of North America.

Both voluntary immigration from other regions as well as the results of the [[Atlantic slave trade]], brought a mix of people to the Americas, including Europeans, Africans, and, to a lesser extent until the 20th century, Asians.  Thus began the process of diversifying the population of the Western Hemisphere.  While the majority of the U.S. population were white immigrants from northern and western Europe and their descendants, they maintained most of the power, social and economic, of the nation.

In the U.S. context, immigration from the 1840s onward diversified the ethnic composition of the nation.  During the early part of the 20th century, southern and eastern European immigrants and their descendants became a larger percentage of the population, but as recent immigrants concentrated in urban areas were also very often poor and lacking in basic healthy living and working conditions.    Descendants of African [[Slavery|slave]]s and immigrants faced a much more difficult challenge due to their skin color and discrimination enforced by legal systems, such as the [[Jim Crow law]]s in the United States.  Since the 1960s, African Americans as well as other minority groups such as [[Mexican American]]s have gained greater social and economic status and power.

Nonetheless, the dominant models of education and social services retained models developed by northern and western European intellectuals, even such well-meaning and important reformers as [[Jane Addams]] and [[Jacob Riis]].  After the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s, though, social workers, activists, and even healthcare providers began to examine their practices to see if they were as effective in African American, Latino, and even Asian American communities in the U.S.  The arrival of more than half a million [[Southeast Asia]]n [[refugee]]s, from 1975 to 1992, for example, tested the ability of medical and social workers to continue effective practice among speakers of other languages and among those coming from very different understandings of everything from mental health to charity.

== Education in the United States ==
With the larger population of minorities and [[racial integration]] during the 1960s and 1970s, the [[Education in the United States|public school system]] of the United States had to grapple with issues of cultural sensitivity as most [[teacher]]s in public school system came from white, [[middle class]] backgrounds.  Most of these teachers were educated, primarily English speaking, and primarily from the Western European cultures.  They often had trouble trying to communicate with speakers of limited English proficiency, let alone people of vastly different [[value system]]s and [[norm (sociology)|normative behaviors]] from that of Anglo-European culture.  The purpose of training educators and others in the area of cultural competence is to provide new teachers the background and skills to work effectively with children of all backgrounds and social classes.

With the growing diversity of the student body in U.S. public school, it is increasingly imperative that teachers have and continually develop a cultural competence that enables them to connect with, respond to, and interact effectively with their pupils.  The achievement gap between cultural minority and majority students suggests a communication disconnect often occurs in minority classrooms because cultural mismatch between teachers and students is common and should not prevent positive, productive for both parties, provided the educator is a culturally competent communicator.  Over the last few decades, scholars have increasingly shown interest in the relationship between learning, reading, schema, and culture.  People's schema depends on their social location, which, as Anderson (1984) explains, includes a reader's age, sex, race, religion, nationality, and occupation, amongst other factors.  Considering schemata determine how people understand, interpret, and analyze everything in their world, it is clear that background and experience really do affect the learning and teaching processes, and how each should be approached in context.  "In short," Anderson (1984) says, "the schema that will be brought to bear on a text depends upon the reader's culture" (p.&amp;nbsp;374-375).  More simply, Anderson (1984) describes a person's schema as their "organized knowledge about the world" (p.&amp;nbsp;372).  In considering the role of schema, one of the educator's principal functions in teaching, particularly with literacy, is to "‘bridge the gap between what the learner already knows and what he needs to know before he can successfully learn the task at hand'" (Anderson, 1984, p.&amp;nbsp;382).  This is important because Staton (1989) explains that student learning—i.e. successful communication between instructor and pupil—occurs when teachers and students come to "shared understandings" (p.&amp;nbsp;364).  Thus, teachers must remember that they are "cultural workers, not neutral professionals using skills on a culturally-detached playing field" (Blanchett, Mumford &amp; Beachum, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;306).

Teachers and administrators in the public school systems of the United States come in contact with a wide variety of sub-cultures and are at the forefront of the challenge of bringing diverse groups together within a larger American society.  Issues confronting teachers and administrators on a daily basis include student [[learning disabilities]], student behavioral problems, [[child abuse]], [[drug addiction]], [[mental health]], and [[poverty]], most of which are handled differently within different cultures and communities.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/blogs/the-importance-of-cultural-competence-in-healthcare/| title=THE IMPORTANCE OF CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTHCARE| accessdate=25 November 2015| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of cultural conflicts often seen by teachers in the public school system include:
* role of women in the family and the decisions they can make
* practices among cultural groups (e.g. [[fire cupping]])
* symbol systems among cultural groups (see [[semiotics]])

Examples of sub-groups within the United States: [[African American]], [[Asian American]], [[Indian American]], [[Irish American]], [[American Jews|Jewish American]], [[Mexican American]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] or American Indians and [[refugee]]s.

==Healthcare==
{{Main|Cultural competence in healthcare}}
The provision of culturally tailored health care can improve [[patient outcomes]]. In 2005, California passed Assembly Bill 1195 that requires patient-related continuing medical education courses in [[California]] [[medical school]] to incorporate cultural and linguistic competence training in order to qualify for certification credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/state-legislation-requires-inclusion-cultural-and-linguistic-competence-continuing-medical |title=State Legislation Requires Inclusion of Cultural and Linguistic Competence in Continuing Medical Education, Increasing Acceptance of Their Importance by Educational Programs and Clinicians |date=2013-09-25 |accessdate=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, HealthPartners Institute for Education and Research implemented the EBAN Experience™ program to reduce health disparities among minority populations, most notably East African immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/clinics-offer-culturally-tailored-diabetes-education-and-culturally-appropriate-care |title=Clinics Offer Culturally Tailored Diabetes Education and Culturally Appropriate Care to Ethiopian Patients, Leading to More Engagement, Better Outcomes, and Reduction of Health Disparities |date=2014-01-29 | accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Josepha Campinha-Bacote|title=The Process of Cultural Competence in the Delivery of Healthcare Services: A Model of Care|journal=Journal of Transcultural Nursing|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hispanic versus Latin American ==
The term "Hispanic" is problematic{{According to whom|date=September 2016}}. It is impossible to refer to "a Hispanic-American perspective" or to "a single Latino culture".(1)(2)  The label "Hispanic" is controversial because it was coined by the Federal Government to describe a heterogeneous ethnic population whose ancestors come from a Spanish-speaking country. Although these American citizens have Latin American roots, the term "Latino" to characterize them is more correct since it is more inclusive of non-Spanish-speaking Latinos. However, the term "Latino" does not include individuals from Spanish-speaking countries outside of Latin America (e.g., Spain).

There is also a lack of adequate research into how race and ethnicity affects members of a group.(3)(4)(5) There are few life histories and phenomenological studies of illness as experienced by people outside the American white, urban, middle class, especially of immigrant and native populations.  Race has been used to explain the absence of research. Racial classifications are based on outmoded concepts and dubious assumptions regarding genetic differences.  In fact, outside of skin color, race is poorly correlated with biological or cultural phenomena, which sharply diminishes its validity in biomedical or social research.  Yet, unlike race or national origin, ethnicity is a sociological construct highly correlated with behavioral and cultural phenomena, particularly language, dress, adornment, food preference, religion, social interaction, marriage and family customs.

Further research is needed to determine whether race and ethnicity among Latinos are rather driven by mechanisms of discrimination and macrosocial factors or social status.  Fortunately, not too long ago, the National Institutes of Health took an important step by insisting that any NIH- supported clinical investigation include, where appropriate, minority populations, women and the aged.(6) However, we must guard against what has been called a new "tokenism", that is, having a large aggregate of "non-whites", and a few African Americans and Hispanics included. This aggregate will never produce a proper sample.  Rigorous attention to sample size, composition and sampling strategies is required to research basic psychosocial processes and clinical responses of minority populations. Accordingly, the heterogeneity of the Hispanic community has to be taken into account. The Hispanic's country of origin, cultural history, migration history, language, family, traditions, religion, educational level, socio-economic status, gender, sexual orientation, age and generation—all need to be explored.

==Cross-cultural competence==
{{Main|Cross-cultural competence}}

Cross-cultural competence (3C) has generated confusing and contradictory definitions because it has been studied by a wide variety of academic approaches and professional fields. One author identified eleven different terms that have some equivalence to 3C: cultural savvy, astuteness, appreciation, literacy or fluency, adaptability, terrain, expertise, competency, awareness, intelligence, and understanding.&lt;ref name="Selmeski"&gt;Selmeski, B.R. (2007). ''Military cross-cultural competence: Core concepts and individual development''. Kingston: Royal Military College of Canada Centre for Security, Armed Forces, &amp; Society.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Army Research Institute, which is currently engaged in a study of 3C has defined it as "A set of cognitive, behavioral, and affective/motivational components that enable individuals to adapt effectively in intercultural environments".&lt;ref name="Abbe et al."&gt;Abbe, A., Gulick, L.M.V., &amp; Herman, J.L. (2007). ''Cross-cultural competence in Army leaders: A conceptual and empirical foundation. Washington, DC: U.S. Army Research Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations in academia, business, health care, government security, and developmental aid agencies have all sought to use 3C in one way or another. Poor results have often been obtained due to a lack of rigorous study of 3C and a reliance on "[[common sense]]" approaches.&lt;ref name="Selmeski"/&gt;

Cross-cultural competence does not operate in a vacuum, however. One theoretical construct posits that 3C, [[language proficiency]], and regional knowledge are distinct skills that are inextricably linked, but to varying degrees depending on the context in which they are employed. In educational settings, [[Benjamin Bloom|Bloom]]'s affective and cognitive taxonomies&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, B.S. (Ed.). (1956). ''Taxonomy of educational objectives: Handbook I: Cognitive domain.'' New York: David McKay.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krathwohl, D.R., Bloom, B.S., &amp; Masia, B.B. (1973). ''Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, the Classification of Educational Goals. Handbook II: Affective Domain.'' New York: McKay Co., Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; serve as an effective framework for describing the overlapping areas among these three disciplines: at the receiving and knowledge levels, 3C can operate with near-independence from language proficiency and regional knowledge. But, as one approaches the internalizing and evaluation levels, the overlapping areas approach totality.

The development of intercultural competence is mostly based on the individual's experiences while he or she is communicating with different cultures. When interacting with people from other cultures, the individual experiences certain obstacles that are caused by differences in cultural understanding between two people from different cultures. Such experiences may motivate the individual to acquire skills that can help him to communicate his point of view to an audience belonging to a different cultural ethnicity and background.

===Immigrants and international students===
A salient issue, especially for people living in countries other than their native country, is the issue of which culture they should follow: their native culture or the one in their new surroundings.

[[International student]]s also face this issue: they have a choice of modifying their cultural boundaries and adapting to the culture around them or holding on to their native culture and surrounding themselves with people from their own country. The students who decide to hold on to their native culture are those who experience the most problems in their university life and who encounter frequent [[culture shock]]s. But international students who adapt themselves to the culture surrounding them (and who interact more with domestic students) will increase their knowledge of the domestic culture, which may help them to "blend in" more. In the article it stated, "Segmented assimilation theorists argue that students from less affluent and racial and ethnic minority immigrant families face a number of educational hurdles and barriers that often stem from racial, ethnic, and gender biases and discrimination embedded within the U.S. public school system" (Bondy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bondy|first1=Jennifer|last2=Peguero|first2=Anthony|last3=Johnson|first3=Brent|title=The Children of Immigrants’ Academic Self-Efficacy: The Significance of Gender, Race, Ethnicity, and Segmented Assimilation|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0013124516644049#articleCitationDownloadContainer|website=Sage Journals|publisher=Sage publications|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such individuals may be said to have adopted [[Bicultural identity|bicultural identities]].

=== Ethnocentrism ===
{{See also|Ethnocentrism}}
Another issue that stands out in intercultural communication is the attitude stemming from [[Ethnocentrism]]. LeVine and Campbell (as cited in Lin and Rancer, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Y. &amp; Rancer, A.S.|year=2003|title=Ethnocentrism, intercultural communication apprehension, intercultural willingness‐to‐communicate, and intentions to participate in an intercultural dialogue program: testing a proposed model|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08824090309388800|journal=Communication Research Reports|volume=20 |issue=1|pages=62–72|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines ethnocentrism as people's tendency to view their culture or in-group as superior to other groups, and to judge those groups to their standards. With ethnocentric attitudes, those incapable to expand their view of different cultures could create conflict between groups. Ignorance to diversity and cultural groups contributes to prevention of peaceful interaction in a fast-paced globalizing world. The counterpart of ethnocentrism is ethnorelativism: the ability to see multiple values, beliefs, norms etc. in the world as cultural rather than universal; being able to understand and accept different cultures.

==Cultural differences==
{{See also|Geert Hofstede}}
Cultural characteristics can be measured along several dimensions that were defined by Geert Hofstede in his studies of cultural differences. The ability to perceive them and to cope with them is fundamental for intercultural competence. These characteristics include:

=== Individualism versus Collectivism ===
* [[Collectivism]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Luomala, H., Kumar, R., Singh, J., &amp; Jaakkola, M. (2015).

** The group is expected to take care of each individual;
** Collectivist cultures include Pakistan, India, Japan, and Guatemala.
* [[Individualism]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
** Autonomy of the individual has the highest importance;
** Promotes the exercise of one's goals and desires and so value independence and self-reliance;
** Decisions prioritize the benefits of the individual rather than the group;
** Individualistic cultures are Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the United States.

=== Masculinity versus Femininity ===
* Masculine Cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
** Value behaviors that indicate assertiveness and wealth;
** Judge people based on the degree of ambition and achievement;
** General behaviors are associated with male behavior;
** Sex roles are clearly defined and sexual inequality is acceptable;
** Masculine cultures include Austria, Italy, Japan, and Mexico.
* Feminine Cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
** Value behaviors that promote the quality of life such as caring for others and nurturing;
** Gender roles overlap and sexual equality is preferred as the norm;
** Nurturing behaviors are acceptable for both women and men;
** Feminine cultures are Chile, Portugal, Sweden, and Thailand.

=== Uncertainty avoidance&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; ===
* Reflects the extent to which members of a society attempt to cope with anxiety by minimizing uncertainty;
* Uncertainty avoidance dimension expresses the degree to which a person in society feels comfortable with a sense of uncertainty and ambiguity.
** High uncertainty avoidance cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*** Countries exhibiting high Uncertainty Avoidance Index or UAI maintain rigid codes of belief and behavior and are intolerant of unorthodox behavior and ideas;
*** Members of society expect consensus about national and societal goals;
*** Society ensures security by setting extensive rules and keeping more structure;
*** High uncertainty avoidance cultures are Greece, Guatemala, Portugal, and Uruguay.
** Low uncertainty avoidance cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*** Low UAI societies maintain a more relaxed attitude in which practice counts more than principles;
*** Low uncertainty avoidance cultures accept and feel comfortable in unstructured situations or changeable environments and try to have as few rules as possible;
*** People in these cultures are more tolerant of change and accept risks;
*** Low uncertainty avoidance cultures are Denmark, Jamaica, Ireland, and Singapore.

=== [[Power (social and political)|Power]] distance&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; ===
* Refers to the degree in which cultures accept unequal distribution of power and challenge the decisions of power holders;
* Depending on the culture, some people may be considered superior to others because of a large number of factors such as wealth, age, occupation, gender, personal achievements, family history, etc.
** High power distance cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*** Believe that social and class hierarchy and inequalities are beneficial, that authority should not be challenged, and that people with higher social status have the right to use power;
*** Cultures with high power distance are Arab countries, Guatemala, Malaysia, and the Philippines.
** Low power distance cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*** Believe in reducing inequalities, challenging authority, minimizing hierarchical structures, and using power just when necessary;
*** Low power distance countries are Austria, Denmark, Israel, and New Zealand.

=== Short-term versus Long-term Time Orientation ===
''See also:'' [[Chronemics]]
* Short-term or Monochronic Orientation&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
** Cultures value tradition, personal stability, maintaining "face," and reciprocity during interpersonal interactions;
** People expect quick results after actions;
** Historical events and beliefs influence people's actions in the present;

** Cultures believe that past results do not guarantee for the future and are aware of change;
** Polychronic cultures are China, Japan, Brazil, and India.

==Assessment==
The assessment of cross-cultural competence is another field that is rife with controversy. One survey identified 86 assessment instruments for 3C.&lt;ref&gt;Fantini, A.E. (2006). ''87 Assessment tools of intercultural competence [Electronic version].'' Brattleboro, VT: School for International Training. Retrieved June 20, 2007, from http://www.sit.edu/publications/docs/feil_appendix_f.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A United States Army Research Institute study narrowed the list down to ten quantitative instruments that were suitable for further exploration of their reliability and validity.&lt;ref name="Abbe et al."/&gt;

The following characteristics are tested and observed for the [[Psychological assessment|assessment]] of intercultural competence as an existing ability or as the potential to develop it: [[ambiguity tolerance]], openness to contacts, flexibility in behavior, emotional stability, motivation to perform, [[empathy]], [[metacommunicative competence]], and [[wikt:polycentric|polycentrism]].

===Quantitative assessment instruments===
Three examples of quantitative assessment instruments are:&lt;ref name="Abbe et al."/&gt;
* the [http://idiinventory.com/ Inter-cultural Intercultural Developmental Inventory]

===Qualitative assessment instruments===
Research in the area of 3C assessment, while thin, points to the value of qualitative assessment instruments in concert with quantitative ones.&lt;ref&gt;Kitsantas, A. (2004).

Intercultural coaching frameworks, such as the ICCA™ ([http://www.globusresearch.com/intercultural-coaching.aspx Intercultural Communication and Collaboration Appraisal]), do not attempt an assessment; they provide guidance for personal improvement based upon the identification of [[Trait theory|personal traits]], strengths, and weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;Messner, W. &amp; Schäfer, N. (2012). ''The ICCA™ Facilitator's Manual'' London: Createspace.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is The ICCA?|url=http://www.globusresearch.com/intercultural-coaching.aspx|work=Intercultural Communication and Collaboration Appraisal|publisher=GloBus Research Ltd.|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
It is important that cross-cultural competence training and skills does not break down into the application of stereotypes. Although its goal is to promote understanding between groups of individuals that, as a whole, think differently, it may fail to recognize specific differences between individuals of any given group. Such differences can be more significant than the differences between groups, especially in the case of heterogeneous populations and value systems.&lt;ref&gt;Rathje, S. (2007). Intercultural Competence: The Status and Future of a Controversial Concept. ''Journal for Language and Intercultural Communication'', 7(4), 254–266&lt;/ref&gt;

Madison (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Madison |first=Greg |year=2006 |title=Existential Migration |journal=Existential Analysis |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=238–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; has criticized the tendency of 3C training for its tendency to simplify migration and cross-cultural processes into stages and phases. Madison's article offers an outline of the original research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3533">'''Join Hands Day''' is the first Saturday in May. It is a national [[Volunteering|volunteer]] day and annual event sponsored by the [[American Fraternal Alliance]].

==Background==

The day was launched by what was then called America's Fraternal Benefit Societies in 2000, in partnership with [[Points of Light Foundation]]. It is meant to have a focus not just on volunteering, but also on developing youth and adult relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Join Hands Day web site, Aug 19, 2000 version, published at www.joinhandsday.org/main.html, archived at [[Internet Archive]], accessed June 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://netforum.avectra.com/public/temp/ClientImages/AFRATA/62e73be8-cfe2-472d-bb2a-3e640ed30171.pdf Join Hands Day 2014 brochure], accessed June 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thrivent.com/leader-resources/activities-programs/activities/join-hands-day.html Thrivent Financial for Lutherans Join Hands Day page], accessed June 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://assuredlife.org/natlservcampaigns/natlservcampaigns-join_hands_day.aspx Assured Life Association Join Hands Day page], accessed June 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first two years of Join Hands Day, organizations were asked to register their Join Hands Day projects via the official web site. In some years, a certain number of groups were chosen to receive a cash award for the beneficiary of their project or another cause and a physical award, and were recognized at the National Fraternal Congress of America (NFCA) annual conference. It was not always on the first Saturday in May; the 2001 day was held on June 16.&lt;ref&gt;Join Hands Day web site, Aug 3, 2001 version, published at www.joinhandsday.org, archived at [[Internet Archive]], accessed June 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizers of Join Hands Day offer participants ideas for group volunteering events that can bring adults and youth together in community service, such as repairing bicycles to give disadvantaged children and teaching bicycle maintenance, collecting chairs of various shapes and sizes to paint and then auction for a worthy cause, or repairing gravestones and improve landscaping in a cemetery and documenting historic grave sites.&lt;ref&gt;[https://netforum.avectra.com/public/temp/ClientImages/AFRATA/993266a0-2235-4dea-9e54-d38e39dfac85.pdf 50 Great JOIN HANDS DAY Project Ideas that Work], accessed June 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julius von Sachs''' ({{IPA-de|zaks|lang}}; 2 October 1832 – 29 May 1897) was a German [[botanist]] from [[Wrocław|Breslau]], [[Prussian Silesia]].  He is a monumental figure in the [[history of botany]].

==Early life==
Sachs was born at Breslau on 2 October 1832. His father, Graveur Sachs, was an engraver by trade, and father taught son delineation and accuracy of line and color.  From earliest boyhood Julius was fascinated with plants, making collections of them on many field excursions with his father.  He gave much of his time between the ages of thirteen and sixteen to drawing and painting the flowers, fungi, and other specimens which he collected.  At the Gymnasium from 1845 to 1850 he was most interested in the natural sciences, collecting skulls, writing a monograph on the crayfish. His natural science teacher, one Krober, showed a singular lack of foresight when he solemnly warned young Sachs against devoting himself to the natural sciences.

When he was but sixteen years old, his father died, and in the next year both his mother and a brother died of the cholera. Suddenly without financial support, he was fortunate to be taken into the family of [[Jan Evangelista Purkyně]] who had accepted a professorship at the [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]]. Sachs was admitted to the university in 1851.

Sachs famously labored long hours in the laboratory for Purkyně, and then long hours for himself each day after his work in the laboratory was finished.  After the lab, he could devote himself entirely to establishing how plants grow.

==Career==
In 1856 Sachs graduated as doctor of philosophy, and then adopted a botanical career, establishing himself as ''[[Privatdozent]]'' for [[plant physiology]]. In 1859 he was appointed physiological assistant to the Agricultural Academy of Tharandt (now part of the [[Technical University of Dresden]]) at [[Julius Adolph Stöckhardt]]; and in 1862 he was called to be director of the [[Chemnitz University of Technology|Polytechnic at Chemnitz]], but was almost immediately transferred to the Agricultural Academy at Poppelsdorf (now part of the [[University of Bonn]]), where he remained until 1867, when he was nominated professor of botany in the [[University of Freiburg]].

In 1868 he accepted the chair of botany in the [[University of Würzburg]], which he continued to occupy (in spite of calls from more prestigious German universities) until his death.

Sachs achieved distinction as an investigator, a writer and a teacher; his name will ever be especially associated with the great development of plant physiology which marked the latter half of the 19th century, though there is scarcely a branch of botany to which he did not materially contribute. His earlier papers, scattered through the volumes of botanical journals and of the publications of learned societies (a collected edition was published in 1892-93), are of great and varied interest. Prominent among them is the series of "Keimungsgeschichten," which laid the foundation of our knowledge of microchemical methods, as also of the [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] and physiological details of [[germination]].
Then there is his resuscitation of the method of "water-culture," and the application of it to the investigation of the problems of nutrition.

Most important are his experiments, developing the concept of [[photosynthesis]], that the [[starch]]-grains, found in leaf [[chloroplasts]], depend on sunlight. A leaf that has been in sunlight, then bleached white and stained with [[iodine]] turns black, proving its starch content, whereas a leaf from the same plant that has been out of the sun will remain white.  A demonstration of this experiment is shown in the second episode of [[BBC Four]]'s "Botany: A Blooming History" presented by [[Timothy Walker (botanist)|Timothy Walker]].

Sachs's later papers were almost exclusively published in the three volumes of the ''Arbeiten des botanischen Instituts in Würzburg'' (1871–88). Among these are his investigation of the periodicity of growth in length, in connection with which he devised the self-registering [[auxanometer]], by which he established the retarding influence of the highly refrangible rays of the [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] on the rate of growth; his researches on [[heliotropism]] and [[geotropism]], in which he introduced the [[clinostat]]; his work on the structure and the arrangement of cells in growing-points; the elaborate experimental evidence upon which he based his "imbibition-theory" of the transpiration-current; his exhaustive study of the assimilatory activity of the green [[leaf]]; and other papers of interest.

Sachs' first published volume was the ''Handbuch der Experimentalphysiologie des Pflanzen'' (1865; French edition, 1868), which gives an admirable account of the state of knowledge in certain departments of the subject, and includes a great deal of original information. This was followed in 1868 by the first edition of his famous ''Lehrbuch der Botanik'', by far the best book of its kind. It is a comprehensive work, giving an able summary of the botanical science of the period, enriched with the results of many original investigations. The third edition was translated into French by [[Philippe Édouard Léon Van Tieghem]] in 1873, and into English by Alfred Bennett in 1875, and published by Oxford University Press. The fourth and last German edition was published in 1874, and also issued by Oxford in 1882.

The ''Lehrbuch'' was eventually superseded by the ''Vorlesungen uber Pflanzenphysiologie'' (1st ed., 1882; 2nd ed., 1887; Eng. ed., Oxford, 1887), a work more limited in scope, but yet covering more ground than its title would imply; though it is a remarkable book, it has not gained the general recognition accorded to the ''Lehrbuch''. Finally, there is the ''Geschichte der Botanik'' (1875); a brilliant and learned account of the development of the various branches of botanical science from the middle of the 16th century up to 1860, of which an English edition was published in 1890 by the Oxford Press. As a teacher Sachs exerted great influence, for his vigorous personality and his ready and lucid utterance enabled him not only to instruct, but to fire his students with something of his own enthusiasm.

A full account of Sachs' life and work was given by Professor Goebel, formerly his assistant, in ''Flora'' (1897), of which an English translation appeared in ''Science Progress'' for 1898. There is also an obituary notice of him in the ''Proc. Roy. Soc.'' vol. lxii.

In 1885 he became foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00002736 |title=J. von Sachs (1832 - 1897) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==

Sachs has been described as a "post-Darwinian botanist" who "integrated the evolutionary theory into his morphological writings."&lt;ref&gt;Farley, John. (1982). Gametes &amp; Spores: Ideas about Sexual Reproduction, 1750-1914. Johns Hopkins University Press. p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; He was originally supportive of [[Darwinism]] but in his late career became bitterly opposed to it, instead preferring [[non-Darwinian evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Dennert, Eberhard. (1904). [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924024754719#page/n41/mode/2up ''At the Deathbed of Darwinism: A Series of Papers'']. German Literary Board. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Croizat, Léon. (1960). ''Principia Botanica: Or, Beginnings of Botany''. Weldon &amp; Wesley. p. 1680&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Many pupils of Sachs like [[Julius Oscar Brefeld]], [[Francis Darwin]], [[Karl Ritter von Goebel]], [[Georg Albrecht Klebs]], [[Spiridon Miliarakis]], [[Hermann Müller (Thurgau)|Hermann Müller-Thurgau]], [[Fritz Noll]], [[Wilhelm Pfeffer]], [[Karl Anton Eugen Prantl|Karl Prantl]], [[Christian Ernst Stahl]] and [[Hugo de Vries]] became later famous botanists.

The standard [[Binomial nomenclature#Authorship in scientific names|botanical author abbreviation]] '''Sachs''' is applied to [[species]] he described.

'''Karma yoga''', also called '''Karma marga''', is one of the four spiritual paths in [[Hinduism]], one based on the "[[yoga]] of action".&lt;ref&gt;P. T. Raju (1954), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1397554 The Concept of the Spiritual in Indian Thought], Philosophy East and West, Vol. 4, No. 3 (Oct., 1954), pp. 210&lt;/ref&gt; To a ''karma yogi'', right work done well is a form of prayer.&lt;ref name=mcdermott228/&gt; It is one of the paths in the spiritual practices of Hindus, others being [[Raja yoga]], [[Jnana yoga]] (path of knowledge) and [[Bhakti yoga]] (path of loving devotion to a personal god).&lt;ref&gt;John Lochtefeld (2014), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Rosen Publishing New York, {{ISBN|978-0823922871}}, pages 98-100, also see articles on bhaktimārga and jnanamārga&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klostermaier"&gt;{{cite book|last=Klostermaier|first=Klaus|authorlink=Klaus Klostermaier|title=A survey of Hinduism|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1989|pages=210–212|isbn=978-0-88706-807-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pechelis (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, pages 14-15, 37-38&lt;/ref&gt; The three paths are not mutually exclusive in Hinduism, but the relative emphasis between Karma yoga, Jnana yoga and Bhakti yoga varies by the individual.&lt;ref name="Horosz2012p258"&gt;{{cite book|author1=W.

Of the [[Four Yogas (Hinduism)|paths to spiritual liberation]] in Hinduism, karma yoga is the path of unselfish action.&lt;ref name=mcdermott228&gt;Robert A. McDermott (1975), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1397942 Indian Spirituality in the West: A Bibliographical Mapping], Philosophy East and West, University of Hawai'i Press, Vol. 25, No. 2 (Apr 1975), pp. 228-230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coward2012p142"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harold G.

Karma Yoga, states the ''Bhagavad Gita'', purifies the mind. It leads one to consider dharma of work, and the work according to one's dharma, doing god's work and in that sense becoming and being "like unto god Krishna" in every moment of one's life.&lt;ref name=mcdermott228/&gt;

==Concept==
According to James Lochtefeld, Karma yoga (also called ''karmamarga'') is the spiritual practice of "selfless action performed for the benefit of others".&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p352"&gt;{{cite book|author=James G. Lochtefeld|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5kl0DYIjUPgC|year=2002|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-3179-8|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Brodd|title=World Religions: A Voyage of Discovery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DOM3XgY1ITMC&amp;pg=PA53|year=2009|publisher=Saint Mary's Press|isbn=978-0-88489-997-6|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karma yoga is a path to reach spiritual [[moksha]] (liberation) through work. It is rightful action without being attached to fruits or being manipulated by what the results might be, a dedication to one's duty, and trying one's best while being neutral to rewards or outcomes such as success or failure.&lt;ref name=zubin342&gt;{{cite journal | last=Mulla | first=Zubin R. | last2=Krishnan | first2=Venkat R. | title=Karma-Yoga: The Indian Model of Moral Development | journal=Journal of Business Ethics | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=123 | issue=2 | year=2013 | pages=342–345, context: 339–351 | doi=10.1007/s10551-013-1842-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tendency for a human being to seek the fruits of action is normal, state Hindu texts, but an exclusive attachment to fruits and positive immediate consequences can compromise dharma (ethical, rightful action). Karma yoga, states Bilimoria, is "ethically fine-tuned action".&lt;ref name="Hooft2014p302"&gt;{{cite book|author=P Bilimoria|editor=S van Hooft|title=The Handbook of Virtue Ethics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i19_BAAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-54477-7|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stephen Phillips, a professor of philosophy and Asian studies, "only [[dharma|dharmic]] action" is suitable in ''karma yoga'', where one downplays one's own exclusive role or one's own exclusive interests. Instead, the ''karma yogi'' considers the interests of all parties impartially, all beings, the elements of ''[[Prakṛti]]'' and then does the right thing.&lt;ref name=phillips&gt;{{cite book|author= Stephen Phillips|title=Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uLqrAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99| year=2009|publisher= Columbia University Press|isbn= 978-0-231-14485-8|pages= 97–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, adds Phillips, there are commentators who disagree and state "any action can be done as karma yoga" and it doesn't have to be consistent with dharma.&lt;ref name=phillips/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William L. Blizek|title=The Continuum Companion to Religion and Film|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=E5uV9aOuyRUC&amp;pg=PA161| year=2009|publisher= Bloomsbury Academic|isbn= 978-0-8264-9991-2|pages =161–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karma yoga, states Bilimoria, does not mean forfeiture of emotions or desires, rather it means action driven by "equanimity, balance", with "dispassion, disinterest", avoiding "one sidedness, fear, craving, favoring self or one group or clan, self-pity, self-aggrandizement or any form of extreme reactiveness".&lt;ref name="Hooft2014p302"/&gt; A Karma yogi acts and does his or her duty, whether that be as "a homemaker, mother, nurse, carpenter or garbage collector, with no thought for one's own fame, privilege or financial reward, but simply as a dedication to the Lord", states [[Harold Coward]] – professor of Religious Studies with a focus on Indian religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harold G. Coward|title=Perfectibility of Human Nature in Eastern and Western Thought, The|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UVsXcS3xPFsC&amp;pg=PA132 |year=2012|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-7885-1|pages=132–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Phillips, Karma yoga applies to "any action in any profession or family activities", where the yogi works selflessly to others' benefit. This is in contrast to other forms of yoga which focus on self-development and self-realization, typically with isolation and meditative introspection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Phillips|title=Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uLqrAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99|year=2009|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-14485-8|pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "disinterested action" idea, states Phillips, is not unique to Hinduism, and similar disinterested non-craving precepts for monks and nuns are found in Buddhism and Jainism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Phillips|title=Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uLqrAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99|year=2009|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-14485-8|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bhagavad Gita===
According to the ''Bhagavad Gita'', selfless service to the right cause and like-minded others, with the right feeling and right attitude, is a form of worship and spirituality.&lt;ref name=mcdermott228/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Phillips|title=Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uLqrAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99|year =2009|publisher= Columbia University Press|isbn= 978-0-231-14485-8|pages=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The first six chapters of the ''Bhagavad Gita'' discuss Karma yoga, chapters 7-12 focus on [[Bhakti yoga]], while chapters 13-18 describe the [[Jnana yoga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Hodgkinson|title=The Essence of Vedanta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SIQEAwAAQBAJ|year=2006|publisher=London: Arcturus|isbn=978-1-84858-409-9|pages=91–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The verse 3.4 of the ''Bhagavad Gita'' states that avoiding work or not starting work is not the path to become free of bondage, just like renouncing the world and wearing monk's dress does not automatically make one spiritual.&lt;ref name="Bhawuk2011p147"/&gt; Not acting is a form of action with consequences and karmic impact, and the nature of existence is such that human beings are always acting in their environment, body or mind, and never for a moment are they not, according to verse 3.5.&lt;ref name="Bhawuk2011p147"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yuvraj Krishan|title=The Doctrine of Karma: Its Origin and Development in Brāhmaṇical, Buddhist, and Jaina Traditions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Bi6FWX1NOgC&amp;pg=PA112 |year=1997|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|isbn=978-81-208-1233-8|pages=112–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The verses 3.6 to 3.8 of the ''Bhagavad Gita'' state that the action can be motivated by body or manipulated by external influences. Alternatively, it can be motivated by one's inner reflection and true self (soul, Atman, Brahman).&lt;ref name=zubin342/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bhawuk2011p147"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Deutsch2004p64"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eliot Deutsch|author2=Rohit Dalvi|title=The Essential Vedanta: A New Source Book of Advaita Vedanta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5vDsAAAAIAAJ|year=2004|publisher=World Wisdom|isbn=978-0-941532-52-5|pages=64–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former creates bondage, the latter empowers freedom. The spiritual path to the liberated state of bliss is to do the best one is able to while being detached to outcomes, to fruits, to success or failure. A karma yogi who practices such ''nishkama karma'' (''niṣkāmakarma''), states Bhawuk, is "an inward journey, which is inherently fulfilling and satisfying".&lt;ref name="Bhawuk2011p147"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dharm Bhawuk|title=Spirituality and Indian Psychology: Lessons from the Bhagavad-Gita |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VO7jV2OZDF4C |year=2011|publisher=Springer Science |isbn=978-1-4419-8110-3|pages=147–148 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tara Chatterjea|title=Knowledge and Freedom in Indian Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=djc1ZvyuQREC&amp;pg=PA125 |year=2003|publisher=Lexington|isbn=978-0-7391-0692-1|pages=125–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Jeaneane D. Fowler|2012}}

A part of the premise of "disinterested action" is that the more one acts with the hope of getting rewards, the more one is liable to disappointment, frustration or self-destructive behavior. Further, another part of the premise is that the more one is committed to "disinterested action", the more one considers the dharma (ethical dimension), focuses on other aspects of the action, strives to do one's best, and this leads to liberating self-empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonardon Ganeri|title=The Concealed Art of the Soul: Theories of Self and Practices of Truth in Indian Ethics and Epistemology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5dITDAAAQBAJ|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920241-6|pages=67–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to chapter 5 of the ''Bhagavad Gita'', both ''[[sannyasa]]'' (renunciation, monastic life) and ''karma yoga'' are means to liberation. Between the two, it recommends ''karma yoga'', stating that anyone who is a dedicated karma yogi neither hates nor desires, and therefore such as person is the "eternal renouncer".&lt;ref name="Deutsch2004p64"/&gt;

The ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' gives a summary of the karma yoga process.&lt;ref&gt;Maharishi Mahesh Yogi on the Bhagavad-Gita, a New Translation and Commentary, Chapter 1-6. Penguin Books, 1969, p 131 (v 45), p 144 (v.51), p 149-150 (v.54)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Gita'' itself is a chapter from the epic known as ''[[Mahabharata]]'', wherein a dialogue takes place between the prince [[Arjuna]], and his friend and chariot driver, Lord [[Krishna]], on the brink of a great dynastic war. Their conversation is prompted by Arjuna as he is engulfed by sorrow and misgivings regarding the oncoming battle in which he has friends and relatives on both sides. In reply, Krishna then elucidates upon a number of philosophical [[yoga]] systems and practices (including karma yoga) by/through which Arjuna should indeed continue with the fight on righteous principles.

In the ''Bhagavad Gita'', Krishna says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"tasmad asaktah satatam karyam karma samacara asakto hy acaran karma param apnoti purushah" &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore, without being attached to the results of activities, one should act as a matter of duty, for by working without attachment one attains the Supreme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/3/19/en1 Chapter 3, Text 19], {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311062756/http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/3/19/en1 |date=11 March 2007 }} Bhagavad Gita&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Other Hindu texts===
The earliest texts that are forerunners of the karma yoga ideas in the ''Bhagavad Gita'' are the ancient Upanishads, such as the ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Phillips|title=Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hlOrAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA164|year=2009|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-14484-1|pages=164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Vedic texts as well as post-Vedic literature of the [[Mimamsa]] school of Hindu philosophy mention ''karma marga'', but these contextually refer to the path of rituals.&lt;ref name="Klostermaier2007p119"&gt;{{cite book|author=Klaus K. Klostermaier|title=A Survey of Hinduism: Third Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E_6-JbUiHB4C&amp;pg=PA119|year=2007|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-7082-4|pages=119–121, 133–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Raju, the Mimamsa ideas, though orthodox, were the fertile grounds on which the later ideas of ''Karma yoga'' developed.&lt;ref&gt;P. T. Raju (1954), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1397554 The Concept of the Spiritual in Indian Thought], Philosophy East and West, Vol. 4, No. 3 (Oct., 1954), pp. 212-213&lt;/ref&gt;

Karma yoga is discussed in many other Hindu texts. For example, the section 11.20 of the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' states that there are only three means to spiritual liberation: ''jnana yoga'' (knowledge), ''karma yoga'' (action) and ''bhakti yoga'' (devotion).&lt;ref name="Werner2013p85"&gt;{{cite book|author=T.R. Sharma|editor=Karel Werner|title=Love Divine: Studies in 'Bhakti and Devotional Mysticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mldcAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA85|year=2013|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-77468-3|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who are of philosophical bent, prefer the "knowledge path". Those who are inclined to productive application of arts, skills and knowledge, prefer the "karma path". Those who prefer emotional connection, prefer the "devotional path". These three paths overlap, with different relative emphasis.&lt;ref name="Horosz2012p258"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Werner2013p85"/&gt;

Discussions on Karma yoga are also found in chapter 33 of ''[[Narada Purana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alain Daniélou|title=Yoga: Mastering the Secrets of Matter and the Universe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n7XOnIkBQ0QC&amp;pg=PA169 |year=1991|publisher=Inner Traditions |isbn=978-0-89281-301-8|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, new movements within Hinduism added [[raja yoga]] as the fourth spiritual path, but this is not universally accepted as distinct to other three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roderick Hindery|title=Comparative Ethics in Hindu and Buddhist Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-FswBLvTkvQC |year=1978|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0866-9|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George D.

==Karma yoga versus Kriya yoga==
According to Constance Jones and James Ryan, karma yoga is "yoga of action" while kriya yoga is "yoga of ritual action". Kriya yoga is found in tantric texts, and believed by its practitioners to activate [[chakra]] and energy centers in the body. In that sense, kriya yoga is a subset of karma yoga. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones|author2=James D.

'''''Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines''''' is a 2004 [[textbook]] offering a general review of the theoretical and experimental literature pertaining to physical [[self-replicating system]]s. The principal focus of the book is on [[self-replicating machine]] systems (see also: [[robot kinematics]]). Specifically with [[kinematics|kinematic]] [[self-replicating machines]] systems in which actual physical objects, not mere patterns of information, undertake their own replication.

''Kinematic'' was written by [[Robert Freitas]] and [[Ralph Merkle]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4940">The '''lazy user model of solution selection''' ('''LUM''') is a model in [[information systems]] proposed by Tétard and Collan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Collan, M.|author2=Tetard, F.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2007|title=Lazy User Theory of Solution Selection|conference=Proceedings or the CELDA 2007 Conference|pages=273–278|location=Algarve, Portugal, 7–9, December, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; that tries to explain how an individual selects a solution to fulfill a need from a set of possible solution alternatives. LUM expects that a solution is selected from a set of available solutions based on the amount of effort the solutions require from the user&amp;nbsp;– the user is supposed to select the solution that carries the least effort. The model is applicable to a number of different types of situations, but it can be said to be closely related to [[technology acceptance model]]s.

The model draws from earlier works on how least effort affects human behaviour in information seeking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zipf, G.K.|year=1949|title=Human Behavior and the Principle of Least Effort|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading MA, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in scaling of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ferrer i Cancho, R.|author2=R.V. Solé|lastauthoramp=y|title=Least effort and the origins of scaling in human language|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|year=2003|volume=100|issue=7|pages=788–91|doi=10.1073/pnas.0335980100|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/100/3/788.full.pdf|pmid=12540826|pmc=298679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier research within the discipline of [[information systems]] especially within the topic of technology acceptance and technology adoption is closely related to the lazy user model.

==The model structure==
The model starts from the observation that there is a "[[user need]]", i.e. it is expected that there is a "clearly definiable, fully satisfiable want" that the user wants satisfied (it can also be said that the user has a problem that he/she wants solved). So there is a place for a solution, product, or service.

The user need defines the set of possible solutions (products, services etc.) that fulfill the user need. The basic model considers for simplicity needs that are 100% satisfiable and services that 100% satisfy the needs. This means that only the solutions that solve the problem are relevant. This logically means that the need defines the possible satisfying solutions&amp;nbsp;– a set of solutions (many different products/services) that all can fulfill the user need. LUM is not limited to looking at one solution separately.

All of the solutions in the set that fulfill the need have their own characteristics; some are good and suitable for the user, others unsuitable and unacceptable&amp;nbsp;– for example, if the user is in a train and wants to know what the result from a tennis match is right now, he/she may only use the types of solutions to the problem that are available to him/her. The "user state" determines the set of available/suitable solutions for the user and thus limits the (available) set of possible solutions to fulfill the user need. The user state is a very wide concept, it is the user characteristics at the time of the need. The user state includes, e.g., age, wealth, location ... everything that determines the state of the user in relation to the solutions in the set of the possible solutions to fulfill the user need.

The model supposes that after the user need has defined the set of possible solutions that fulfill the user need and the user state has limited the set to the available plausible solutions that fulfill the user need the user will "select" a solution from the set to fulfill the need. Obviously if the set is empty the user does not have a way to fulfill the need. The lazy user model assumes that the user will make the selection from the limited set based on the lowest level of effort. Effort is understood as the combination of monetary cost + time needed + physical/mental effort needed.&lt;ref name="HICSS"&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Franck Tetard|author2=Mikael Collan|title=Lazy User Theory: A Dynamic Model to Understand User Selection of Products and Services|work=hicss|pages=1–9|conference=42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences|year=2009|url=https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/hicss/2009/3450/00/09-13-01.pdf|doi=10.1109/HICSS.2009.287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Considerations==
The lazy user theory has implications when thinking about the effect of learning in technology adoption (for example in the adoption of new information systems).&lt;ref name="HICSS"/&gt;

'''Marcel Broodthaers''' (28 January 1924 – 28 January 1976) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] poet, filmmaker and artist with a highly literate and often witty approach to creating [[art]] works.

==Life and career==
Broodthaers was born in [[Brussels]], Belgium, where he was associated with the [[Groupe Surréaliste-revolutionnaire]]  from 1945 and dabbled in [[journalism]], [[film]], and [[poetry]]. After spending 20 years in poverty as a struggling poet,&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Art Online; Essay on Broodthaers by Michael Compton&lt;/ref&gt; at the end of 1963 he decided to become an artist and began to make objects.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/marcel-broodthaers-815/text-artist-biography Marcel Broodthaers] [[Tate]].&lt;/ref&gt; He performed the symbolic act of embedding fifty unsold copies of his book of poems ''Pense-Bête'' in plaster, creating his first art object. That same year, 1964, for his first exhibition, he wrote a famous preface for the exhibition catalogue;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I, too, wondered whether I could not sell something and succeed in life. For some time I had been no good at anything. I am forty years old... Finally the idea of inventing something insincere crossed my mind and I set to work straightaway. At the end of three months I showed what I had produced to Philippe Edouard Toussaint, the owner of the Galerie St Laurent. 'But it is art' he said 'and I will willingly exhibit all of it.' 'Agreed' I replied. If I sell something, he takes 30%. It seems these are the usual conditions, some galleries take 75%.

What is it? In fact it is objects."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Marcel Broodthaers, Tate Gallery, 1980 p13&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Broodthaers made his first film in 1957, and from 1967 he produced over 50 short films in documentary, narrative, and experimental styles.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://filmstudiescenter.uchicago.edu/events/2010/films-marcel-broodthaers-between-art-history-and-film-studies The Films of Marcel Broodthaers: Between Art History and Film Studies, 15 May 2010] [[University of Chicago]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Broodthaers later worked principally with assemblies of [[found object]]s and [[collage]], often containing written texts. He incorporated written language in his art and used whatever was at hand for his raw materials—most notably the shells of eggs and mussels, but also furniture, clothing, garden tools, household gadgets and reproductions of artworks.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Suzanne Muchnich (18 July 1989), [http://articles.latimes.com/1989-07-18/entertainment/ca-3787_1_art-world Sincerely Insincere] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Visual Tower'' (1966), Broodthaers made a seven-story circular tower of wood. He filled each story with uniform glass jars, and in every jar he placed an identical image taken from an illustrated magazine, of the eye of a beautiful young woman.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;[[John Russell (art critic)|John Russell]] (23 April 1989), [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/23/arts/art-view-an-antic-insubordinate-performer-babel.html An Antic, Insubordinate Performer Babel?] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; For ''Surface de moules (avec sac) (Surface of mussels (with bag))'' (1966), he glued mussels in resin on a square panel;&lt;ref&gt;Souren Melikian (28 June 2012), [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/arts/29iht-melikian29.html Modern Blue Chips Avert Downturn] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1974 the artist added a discreet metal hook to the centre of the work designed to support a shopping bag filled with mussel shells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5584443 Marcel Broodthaers, ''Surface de moules (avec sac) (Surface of mussels (with bag))'' (1966)] [[Christie's]] Post-War and Contemporary Art Evening Auction, 27 June 2012, London.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:“Dites partout que je l’ai dit”, 1974.jpg|thumb|“Dites partout que je l’ai dit”, 1974. A décor work by Marcel Broodthaers.]]
From 1968 to 1975 Broodthaers produced large-scale environmental pieces that reworked the very notion of the museum.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; His most noted work was an installation which began in his Brussels house which he called ''Musée d'Art Moderne, Départment des Aigles'' (1968), containing different representations of eagles in glass cases that were accompanied by signs that asserted "This is not a work of art", implying that museums obscure the ideological functioning of images by imposing illegitimate classifications of value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=After Modern Art|last=Hopkins|first=David|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0192842343|location=London|pages=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; This installation was followed by a further eleven manifestations of the 'museum', including at the [[Kunsthalle Düsseldorf]] for an exhibition in 1970 and at documenta 5 in Kassel in 1972. In 1970 Broodthaers conceived of the ''Financial Section'', which encompassed an attempt to sell the museum "on account of bankruptcy." The sale was announced on the cover of the [[Art Cologne]] fair catalogue in 1971, but no buyers were found. As part of the ''Financial Section'', the artist also produced an unlimited edition of gold ingots stamped with the museum's emblem, an eagle, a symbol associated with power and victory. The ingots were sold to raise money for the museum, at a price calculated by doubling the market value of gold, the surcharge representing the bar's value as art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/1999/muse/artist_pages/broodthaers_musee.html Marcel Broodthaers, ''Musée d'Art Moderne, Département des Aigles, Section Financière (Museum of Modern Art, Department of Eagles, Financial Section)'' (1970-1971)] [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Broodthaers launched three separate exhibitions in the same week, each consisting of a new type of installation artwork he referred to as “décors.” The venues of these exhibitions were Wide White Space in Antwerp, Catalogue-Catalogus at Palais de Beaux-Arts Brussels, and Eloge du sujet at Kunstmuseum Basel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marcel Broodthaers: A Retrospective|last=Chaffee|first=Cathleen|publisher=The Museum of Modern Art|year=2016|isbn=978-0-87070-962-3|location=Belgium|pages=290–294}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 Broodthaers presented the exhibition "L’Angelus de Daumier" at the Centre National d’Art Contemporain in Paris, at which each room had the name of a colour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macba.es/antagonismos/english/09_18.html Marcel Broodthaers, ''La Salle blanche'' (1975)] [[MACBA]], Barcelona.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''La Salle Blanche (The White Room)'' (1975), a life-size copy of a room and a half in Broodthaers' home in Brussels, the wooden walls of the empty, unfurnished rooms are covered with printed words in French—such as museum, gallery, oil, subject, composition, images, and privilege—all intended to examine "the influence of language on perceptions of the world and the ways museums affect the production and consumption of art."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brenson (15 June 1984), [https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/15/arts/art-for-jean-cocteau-word-was-multifarious.html For Jean Cocteau, Word Was Multifarious] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; For such works he is associated with the late 20th century global spread of both [[installation art]] as well as [[Institutional Critique|"institutional critique,"]] in which interrelationships between artworks, the artist, and the museum are a focus. Indeed, Broodthaers' ''Musée d'Art Moderne'', his "first fictional museum," allowed him to simultaneously posture as artist, director, curator and trustee in a self-reflexive examination of the order and prescriptions implicit in the production of museum exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Institutional Critique: An Anthology of Artists' Writings|last=Alberro, Stimson|first=Alexander and Blake|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-262-01316-1|location=Cambridge|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From late 1969, Broodthaers lived mainly in Düsseldorf, Berlin, and finally London.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; He died of a [[liver disease]]&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; in [[Cologne]], [[Germany]] on his 52nd birthday. He is buried at [[Ixelles Cemetery]] in Brussels under a tombstone of his own design.

==Exhibitions==
In 1980, the exhibition "Marcel Broodthaers" was mounted by the [[Tate Gallery]], London. Other important retrospectives of Broodthaers’ work have been held at the [[Walker Art Center]] (1989), [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]] (1989); [[Carnegie Museum of Art]], Pittsburgh (1989); [[Jeu de Paume]], Paris (1991); and [[Palais des Beaux Arts]], Brussels (2000). The most recent traveling survey was organized by the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York and the [[Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía]], Madrid in 2016. The show also traveled to the [[Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen]], Düsseldorf in 2017. An important solo exhibition of the film work, "Marcel Broodthaers: Cinéma", was shown at [[Fundacio Antoni Tàpies]], Barcelona; Centro Galego de Arte Contemporánea, Santiago de Compostela, and [[Kunsthalle Düsseldorf]] (1997). The first Solo Show in Austria was presented 2003 at Kunsthalle Vienna. In 2015 the [[Fridericianum]] presented a comprehensive retrospective featuring works from all of the artist's creative periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fridericianum.org/exhibitions/marcel-broodthaers|title=Marcel Broodthaers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/1542 "Marcel Broodthaers: A Retrospective"] at the Museum of Modern Art, New York was the first Broodthaers retrospective organized in New York. This solo exhibition was at the Museum of Modern Art, New York February 14–May 15, 2016 and then traveled to Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía , Madrid, in October 2016, and to the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, Düsseldorf in the Spring of 2017.

There have been many notable international group exhibitions, including [[documenta]] 10, 7 and 5, Kassel (1997, 1982, and 1972).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mariangoodman.com/exhibitions/2010-09-09_marcel-broodthaers/ Marcel Broodthaers: SECTION CINÉMA, 9 September – 16 October 2010] [[Marian Goodman Gallery]], New York/Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing==
As a poet and political activist, Broodthaers had a life-long interest in the circulatory power of printed matter: posters, graphics, editions, and artist books. In addition to the monetary potential of galleries selling limited editions, artist's books published with  nonprofit institutions like Kunstalle Düsseldorf, the Deutsche Academischer Austaudienst (DAAD), Berlin, the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, and the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, merged the artist's commercial ambitions with conceptual and philosophical ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/broodthaers-tractatus-logico-catalogicus-art-or-the-art-of-selling-p01810|title=‘Tractatus Logico Catalogicus - Art or the Art of Selling’, Marcel Broodthaers, 1972 - Tate|first=|last=Tate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Broodthaers' catalogue for ''Der Adler von Oligizän bis heute,'' the seminal culmination of his ''Musee d'Art Moderne, department des Aigles,'' at Kunstalle Düsseldorf in 1972, was published in two volumes. The first volume featured a scholarly index of the items on display and was for sale at the opening of the exhibition, replete with a coupon that could be redeemed for a copy of volume two, which came out at the close of the exhibition and featured views of the installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broodthaers.us/index.php?id=2,48,50|title=Broodthaers Society of America|website=www.broodthaers.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broodthaers returned to this motif for his artist's book ''Photographieren Verboten/No Photographs Allowed'' but aimed it at the convention of the exhibition catalogue, with version one published by the DAAD, Berlin, and version two by the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford. The Oxford book presents ostensibly the same content as the DAAD book but scrambles the internal logic of the book, changing the context of its standard component parts—title page, checklist, scholarly essay, curriculum vitae—and thus the implications of each. Content normally reserved for the rear of an exhibition catalogue (in this case the artist's cv) appears on the inside front cover as a decorative pattern, and scholarly content such as the catalogue essay appears on the outside back cover like an advertising blurb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broodthaers.us/index.php?id=2,48,115|title=Broodthaers Society of America|website=www.broodthaers.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Natural design''' is an approach to [[psychology]] and [[biology]] that holds that concepts such as "motivation", "emotion", "inner feeling", "development", "adaptation" refer not to down-reductive explanations of things but to up-reductive descriptions of patterns of which those things are part. It has its roots in philosophical behaviorism and the [[new realism]]. It also refers to an holistic approach to Design called for by Prof David W. Orr (Professor of Environmental Studies and Politics, Oberlin College USA) &lt;ref&gt;David W. Orr, (2002) "The Nature of Design: Ecology, Culture, and Human Intention". Oxford University Press, USA&lt;/ref&gt;  and developed for research practice by Prof Seaton Baxter (Emeritus Professor for the Study of Natural Design, [[Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design]], [[University of Dundee]]). &lt;ref&gt;Baxter, S. (2006), The Way to Natural Design: Learning to see and Confront the Bigger Design Questions, Enhancing Curricula, 3rd International CLTAD Conference, 6-7 April ‘06, Lisbon, Portugal.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Natural design has attribution to the process of natural selection. All species have been designed based on their life situation in order to have more offspring. This resulted as only better designed organisms can be found today because natural selection is only limited by the rapidity of environment change and the capacity of the genes to generate variation. Moreover, the theory of evolution by natural selection can some how explain the behavior of animals.&lt;ref&gt;N.S. Thompson, (1987) '''Natural Design and the Future of Comparative Psychology'''. ''Journal of Comparative Psychology. 101, 282-286.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studying of behavior==

Darwinism, psychologist who studies in behavior, stated two consequences of studying behavior.

#Conceptual consequence of breaking the mind and design. The presence of design was no longer evidence of an intending mind if Darwinism was correct. Therefore, design could exist by itself.

#Break down of the dualism and the partition that hitherto had existed between psychology and biology. Each discipline now could explain the preferred domain of the other such as instinct and natural selection can be used to human behavior and intentions are able to explain animal behavior.

These two results provided two competing systems for study of behavior and evolved into ethology and further evolved into comparative psychology.&lt;ref&gt;N.T. Thompson, (1987) '''Natural Design and the Future of Comparative Psychology'''. ''Journal of Comparative Psychology. 101, 282-286.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Normative''' generally means relating to an evaluative standard. Normativity is the phenomenon in human societies of designating some actions or outcomes as good or desirable or permissible and others as bad or undesirable or impermissible. A norm in this normative sense means a standard for evaluating or making judgments about behavior or outcomes. Normative is sometimes also used, somewhat confusingly, to mean relating to a descriptive standard: doing what is normally done or what most others are expected to do in practice. In this sense a norm is not evaluative, a basis for judging behavior or outcomes; it is simply a fact or observation about behavior or outcomes, without judgment. Many researchers in this field try to restrict the use of the term normative to the evaluative sense and refer to the description of behavior and outcomes as positive, descriptive, predictive, or empirical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Grammar of Society:The Nature and Dynamics of Social Norms|last=Bicchieri|first=Cristina|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0521574907|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Norms in the Wild: How to Diagnose, Measure, and Change Social Norms|last=Bicchieri|first=Cristina|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780190622053|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Normative'' has specialized meanings in different academic disciplines such as philosophy, social sciences, and law. In most contexts, normative means 'relating to an evaluation or value judgment.' Normative propositions tend to evaluate some object or some course of action. Normative content differs from descriptive content.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/227918828|title=Normativity|last=Jarvis.|first=Thomson, Judith|date=2008|publisher=Open Court|isbn=9780812696585|location=Chicago, Ill.|oclc=227918828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major developments in analytic philosophy has seen the reach of normativity spread to virtually all corners of the field, from ethics and the philosophy of action, to epistemology, metaphysics, and the philosophy of science. Saul Kripke famously showed that rules (including mathematical rules, such as the repetition of a decimal pattern) are normative in an important respect.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/862091562|title=Being realistic about reasons|last=Thomas,|first=Scanlon,|isbn=9780199678488|edition= First|location=Oxford|oclc=862091562}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/7998796|title=Wittgenstein on rules and private language : an elementary exposition|last=1940-|first=Kripke, Saul A.,|date=1982|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0674954009|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=7998796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though philosophers disagree about how normativity should be understood, it has become increasingly common to understand normative claims as claims about reasons.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As Derek Parfit explains:

{{Quote|We can have reasons to believe something, to do something, to have some desire or aim, and to have many other attitudes and emotions, such as fear, regret, and hope. Reasons are given by facts, such as the fact that someone's finger-prints are on some gun, or that calling an ambulance would save someone's life. It is hard to explain the ''concept'' of a reason, or what the phrase 'a reason' means. Facts give us reasons, we might say, when they count in favour of our having some attitude, or our acting in some way. But 'counts in favour of' means roughly 'gives a reason for'. The concept of a reason is best explained by example. One example is the thought that we always have a reason to want to avoid being in agony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/744616054|title=On what matters Volume one|last=Derek.|first=Parfit,|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Scheffler, Samuel, 1951-|isbn=9780191576706|location=Oxford|oclc=744616054}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Philosophy ==
{{main|Ethics}}
In [[philosophy]], ''normative'' statements make claims about how things should or [[Is-ought problem|ought]] to be, how to [[Value theory|value]] them, which things are [[goodness and value theory|good]] or bad, and which [[Action (philosophy)|action]]s are [[right]] or [[wrong]].  Normative claims are usually contrasted with [[Positive statement|positive]] (i.e. descriptive, [[explanation|explanatory]], or [[constative]]) claims when describing types of [[theory|theories]], [[belief]]s, or [[proposition]]s. Positive statements are (purportedly) factual statements that attempt to describe [[reality]].

For example, "children should eat vegetables", and "those who would sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither" are normative claims. On the other hand, "vegetables contain a relatively high proportion of vitamins", and "a common consequence of sacrificing liberty for security is a loss of both" are positive claims. Whether a statement is normative is logically independent of whether it is verified, verifiable, or popularly held.

There are several schools of thought regarding the status of normative statements and whether they can be [[reason|rationally]] discussed or defended. Among these schools are the tradition of [[practical reason]] extending from [[Aristotle]] through [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] to [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]], which asserts that they can, and the tradition of [[emotivism]], which maintains that they are merely expressions of emotions and have no cognitive content. &lt;!--last sentence/statement: i.e., objectivity vs. subjectivity(?)--&gt;

Normative statements and [[norm (philosophy)|norms]], as well as their meanings, are an integral part of human life. They are fundamental for prioritizing goals and organizing and planning. [[Thought]], [[belief]], [[emotion]], and [[Action (philosophy)|action]] are the basis of much ethical and political discourse; indeed, normativity is arguably the key feature distinguishing ethical and political discourse from other discourses (such as natural science).

Much modern moral/ethical philosophy takes as its starting point the apparent variance between peoples and cultures regarding the ways they define what is considered to be appropriate/desirable/praiseworthy/valuable/good etc. (In other words, variance in how individuals, groups and societies define what is in accordance with their normative standards.) This has led philosophers such as [[A.J. Ayer]] and [[J.L. Mackie]] (for different reasons and in different ways) to cast doubt on the meaningfulness of normative statements. However, other philosophers, such as [[Christine Korsgaard]], have argued for a source of normative value which is independent of individuals' subjective morality and which consequently attains (a lesser or greater degree of) objectivity.

== Social sciences and economics ==
In the [[social sciences]], the term "normative" has broadly the same meaning as its usage in philosophy, but may also relate, in a [[sociological]] context, to the role of cultural '[[norm (social)|norms]]'; the shared values or institutions that [[structural functionalist]]s regard as constitutive of the [[social structure]] and [[social cohesion]]. These values and units of [[socialization]] thus act to encourage or enforce social activity and outcomes that ''ought'' to (with respect to the [[norm (sociology)|norms]] implicit in those structures) occur, while discouraging or preventing social activity that ''ought not'' occur. That is, they promote social activity that is socially ''valued'' (see [[normative#Philosophy|philosophy]] above). While there are always anomalies in social activity (typically described as "[[crime]]" or anti-social behaviour, see also [[normality (behavior)]]) the normative effects of popularly endorsed beliefs (such as "[[family values]]" or "[[common sense]]") push most social activity towards a generally homogeneous set. From such reasoning, however, functionalism shares an affinity with ideological [[conservatism]].

[[Normative economics]] deals with questions of what sort of economic policies should be pursued, in order to achieve desired (that is, valued) economic outcomes.

== International relations ==
In the academic discipline of [[International relations]], Smith, Baylis &amp; Owens in the ''Introduction'' to their 2008 &lt;ref&gt;''The Globalization of World Politics: An introduction to international relations'', New York, Oxford University Press {{ISBN|9780199297771}}, Fourth edition, pp.2-13&lt;/ref&gt; book make the case that the normative position or normative theory is to make the world a better place and that this theoretical [[worldview]] aims to do so by being aware of [[Tacit assumption|implicit assumption]]s and [[explicit assumption]]s that constitute a non-normative position, and align or position the normative towards the [[:wikt:loci|loci]] of other key socio-political theories such as political [[Liberalism]], [[Marxism]], political [[Constructivism (international relations)|Constructivism]], political [[Realism (international relations)|Realism]], political [[Idealism]] and political [[Globalization]].

== Law ==
{{See also|Normative jurisprudence}}
In [[law]], as an academic discipline, the term "normative" is used to describe the way something ought to be done according to a value position. As such, normative arguments can be conflicting, insofar as different values can be inconsistent with one another. For example, from one normative value position the purpose of the criminal process may be to repress crime. From another value position, the purpose of the criminal justice system could be to protect individuals from the moral harm of wrongful conviction.

== Standards documents ==
Normative elements are defined in [[International Organization for Standardization]] Directives Part 2 as "elements that describe the scope of the document, and which set out provisions".  Provisions include "requirements", "recommendations" and "statements".  "Statements" include permissions, possibilities and capabilities.  A "requirement" is an "expression in the content of a document conveying criteria to be fulfilled if compliance with the document is to be claimed and from which no deviation is permitted."  It is not necessary to comply with recommendations and statements in order to comply with the standard; it is necessary to comply only with the requirements (that are denoted by the verbal form "shall").  There is much confusion between "normative" and "requirement", however the ISO terminology is supported by national standards bodies worldwide and is the legitimate description of these terms in the context of standards documents.

In [[Standardization|standard]]s terminology still used by some organisations, "normative" means "considered to be a [[wikt:prescriptive|prescriptive]] part of the standard". It characterises that part of the standard which describes what ''ought'' (see [[normative#Philosophy|philosophy]] above) to be done within the application of that standard. It is implicit that application of that standard will result in a ''valuable'' outcome (''ibid.''). For example, many standards have an introduction, preface, or summary that is considered non-normative, as well as a main body that is considered normative. "Compliance" is defined as "complies with the normative sections of the standard"; an object that complies with the normative sections but not the non-normative sections of a standard is still considered to be in compliance.

* Normative = prescriptive = how to comply
* Informative = descriptive = help with conceptual understanding

Typically, ''normative'' is contrasted with ''informative'' (referring to the standard's descriptive, explanatory or [[Positive science|positive]] content).  Informative data is supplemental information such as additional guidance, supplemental recommendations, tutorials, commentary as well as background, history, development, and relationship with other elements.  Informative data is not a requirement and doesn’t compel compliance.

An '''obscenity''' is any utterance or act that strongly offends the prevalent [[morality]] of the time.&lt;ref name="M-W"&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/obscene Merriam-Webster Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410221155/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/obscene |date=10 April 2010 }}, accessed September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from the Latin ''obscaena'' (offstage) a cognate of the [[Ancient Greek]] root ''[[Skene (theatre)|skene]]'', because some potentially offensive content, such as [[murder]] or [[sex]], was depicted offstage in classical drama. The word can be used to indicate a strong moral repugnance, in expressions such as "obscene [[profit (accounting)|profit]]s" or "the obscenity of war".  As a legal term, it usually refers to graphic depictions of people engaged in [[Human sexuality|sexual]] and [[Excretion|excretory]] activity.

{{main article|United States obscenity law}}
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2009}}
[[File:Édouard-Henri Avril (9).jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;The 18th century book ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' has been subject to obscenity trials at various times (image: plate XI: The bathing party; La baignade)&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:Fanny Hill 1910 cover.jpg|thumb|Cover of an undated American edition of ''Fanny Hill'', ca. 1910]]
In the [[United States|United States of America]], issues of obscenity raise issues of limitations on the [[freedom of speech]] and of [[freedom of the press|the press]], which are otherwise protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]].

Federal obscenity law in the U.S. is unusual in that there is no uniform national standard. Former Justice [[Potter Stewart]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], in attempting to classify what material constituted exactly "what is obscene," famously wrote, "I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced ... [b]ut [[I know it when I see it]]...."&lt;ref&gt;''Jacobellis v. Ohio'', 378 U.S. 184, 197 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the 1973 ruling of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''[[Miller v. California]]'' established a three-tiered [[Miller test|test]] to determine what was obscene—and thus not protected, versus what was merely erotic and thus protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

Delivering the opinion of the court, Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] wrote:
:''The basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be: (a) whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.&lt;ref&gt;''Miller v. California'', 413 U.S. 15, 24 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt;''

While most recent (2016) obscenity cases in the United States have revolved around images and films, the first obscenity cases dealt with textual works.

The classification of "obscene" and thus illegal for production and distribution has been judged on printed text-only stories starting with "Dunlop v. U.S., 165 U.S. 486 (1897)", which upheld a conviction for mailing and delivery of a newspaper called the 'Chicago Dispatch,' containing "obscene, lewd, lascivious, and indecent materials", which was later upheld in several cases. One of these was "A Book Named ''John Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure''" v. Attorney General of Com. of Massachusetts, "[[Memoirs v. Massachusetts|383 U.S. 413 (1966)]]" wherein the book "[[Fanny Hill]]", written by John Cleland c. 1760, was judged to be obscene in a proceeding that put the book itself on trial rather than its publisher. Another was "Kaplan v. California, 413 U.S. 115 (1973)" whereby the court most famously determined that "Obscene material in book form is not entitled to any First Amendment protection merely because it has no pictorial content."

In 2005, the U.S. Department of Justice formed the [[Obscenity Prosecution Task Force]] in a push to prosecute obscenity cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Larry | last = Abramson | title = Federal Government Renews Effort to Curb Porn | date = 27 September 2005 | publisher = NPR | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4865348 | work = Morning Edition | accessdate = 11 April 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120630022330/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4865348 | archivedate = 30 June 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Barton | last = Gellman | title = Recruits Sought for Porn Squadn | date = 20 September 2005 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/19/AR2005091901570.html | work = The Washington Post | accessdate = 11 April 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121020085913/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/19/AR2005091901570.html | archivedate = 20 October 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Red Rose Stories, a site dedicated to text-only fantasy stories, became one of many sites targeted by the FBI for shutdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Red Rose Stories Closed by FBI | date = 7 October 2005 | url = http://www.xbiz.com/news/10680 | work = XBiz | accessdate = 11 April 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120425211555/http://www.xbiz.com/news/10680 | archivedate = 25 April 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government alleged that Red Rose Stories contained depictions of child rape.

Literature (non-fiction) communicating [[contraceptive]] information was prohibited by several states. The last such prohibition, in Connecticut, was overturned judicially in 1965.

===Key U.S. court cases on obscenity===

*In 1957, two associates of acclaimed poet Allen Ginsberg were arrested and jailed for selling his book "Howl and Other Poems" to undercover police officers at a beatnik bookstore in San Francisco. Eventually the California Supreme Court declared the literature to be of "redeeming social value" and therefore [[Howl#1957 obscenity trial|not classifiable as "obscene"]]. Because the poem "Howl" contains pornographic slang and overt references to drugs and homosexuality, the poem was (and is) frequently censored and confiscated; however, it remains a landmark case.
*'''''[[FCC v. Pacifica]]''''' (1978) [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=438&amp;invol=726 (external link)] better known as the landmark "[[seven dirty words]]" case. In that ruling, the Court found that only "repetitive and frequent" use of the words in a time or place when a minor could hear can be punished.
*In '''''[[State v. Henry]]''''' (1987), the [[Oregon Supreme Court]] ruled that the Oregon state law that criminalized obscenity was an unconstitutional restriction of free speech under the free speech provision of the [[Oregon Constitution]], with the ruling making Oregon the "first state in the nation to abolish the offense of obscenity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=9446|title=Wisconsin high court could strike down obscenity law|author=Hudson, David|publisher=[[First Amendment Center]]|date=1998-10-28|accessdate=2011-01-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104093910/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=9446|archivedate=4 November 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In '''''[[Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union|Reno v. ACLU]]''''' (1997), the Supreme Court struck down indecency laws applying to the Internet.
*In '''''[[Miller v. California]]''''' (1973) - the currently-binding Supreme Court precedent on the issue - the Court ruled materials were obscene if they appealed, "to a prurient interest", showed "[[patently offensive]] sexual conduct" that was specifically defined by a state obscenity law, and "lacked serious artistic, literary, political, or scientific value." Decisions regarding whether material was obscene should be based on local, not national, standards.

Standards superseded by the [[Miller Test]] include:
* ''Wepplo'' (1947): If material has a substantial tendency to deprave or corrupt its readers by inciting [[lascivious]] thoughts or arousing lustful desires. (People v. Wepplo, 78 Cal. App.2d Supp. 959, 178 P.2d 853).
* ''[[Hicklin test]]'' (1868): the effect of isolated passages upon the most susceptible persons. (British common law, cited in Regina v. Hicklin, 1868. LR 3 QB 360 - overturned when Michigan tried to outlaw all printed matter that would 'corrupt the morals of youth' in Butler v. State of Michigan 352 U.S. 380 (1957))
* ''[[Roth Standard]]'' (1957): "Whether to the average person applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest". [[Roth v. United States]] 354 U.S. 476 (1957) - overturned by Miller
* ''[[Jacobellis v. Ohio|Roth-Jacobellis]]'' (1964): "community standards" applicable to an obscenity are national, not local standards. Material is "utterly without redeeming social importance". Jacobellis v. Ohio 378 US 184 (1964) - famous quote: "I shall not today attempt further to define ''[hardcore pornography]'' ...But I know it when I see it."
* ''[[Memoirs v. Massachusetts|Roth-Jacobellis-Memoirs Test]]'' (1966): Adds that the material possesses "not a modicum of social value". (A Book Named ''John Cleland's [[Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure]]'' v. Attorney General of Massachusetts, 383 U.S. 413 (1966))

[[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] rules and federal law govern obscenity in broadcast media. Many historically important works have been described as obscene or prosecuted under obscenity laws, including the works of [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Lenny Bruce]], [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[James Joyce]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[Henry Miller]], [[Samuel Beckett]], and the [[Marquis de Sade]].

===Criticism===

Obscenity law has been criticized in the following areas:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.nexusjournal.org/2005obscenity/75-82.pdf Huston, William: "Under Color of Law, Obscenity vs. the First Amendment", ''Nexus Journal'', Vol 10 (2005): 75:82.]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Federal law forbids obscenity in certain contexts (such as broadcast);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/guides/obscenity-indecency-and-profanity |title=Obscene, Indecent and Profane Broadcasts |publisher=FCC |accessdate=2013-08-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209153728/http://www.fcc.gov/guides/obscenity-indecency-and-profanity |archivedate=9 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the law does not define the term.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}
* The U.S. Supreme Court similarly has had difficulty defining the term. In ''[[Miller v. California]]'', the court defers definition to two hypothetical entities, "contemporary community standards" and "hypothetical reasonable persons".
* The courts and the legislature have had similar problems defining this term because it is paradoxical, and thus impossible to define.
* Because the term "obscenity" is not defined by either the statutes or the case law, this law does not satisfy the [[Vagueness doctrine]], which states that people must clearly be informed as to the prohibited behavior.
* Because the determination of what is obscene (offensive) is ultimately a personal preference, alleged violations of obscenity law are not actionable (actions require a right).
* Because no actual injury occurs when a mere preference is violated, alleged violations of obscenity law are not actionable (actions require an injury).

Obscenity laws remain enforceable under Miller despite these criticisms.  Some states have passed laws mandating censorship in schools, universities, and libraries even if they are not receiving [[Children's Internet Protection Act|government aid that would require censorship in these institutions]]. These include Arizona, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Twenty more states were considering such legislation in 2001–2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aclu.org/issues/cyber/hmcl.html |title=Technology and Liberty &amp;#124; American Civil Liberties Union |publisher=Aclu.org |date=2008-11-14 |accessdate=2013-08-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021015042228/http://www.aclu.org/issues/cyber/hmcl.html |archivedate=15 October 2002 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[New York v. Ferber]]'', {{ussc|458|747|1982}}, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that child pornography need not be legally obscene in order to be outlawed. The Court ruled that in contrast to the types of images considered in ''Miller'', images that depicted underlying harm to children need not appeal to "the prurient interest of the average person," portray sexual conduct in "a patently offensive manner," nor be considered holistically, in order to be proscribed. Another difference between U.S. constitutional law concerning obscenity and that governing child pornography is that the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Stanley v. Georgia]]'', {{ussc|394|557|1969}}, that possession of obscene material could not be criminalized, while in ''[[Osborne v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|495|103|1990}}, the high court ruled that possession of child pornography could be criminalized. The reason was that the motive for criminalizing child pornography possession was "to destroy a market for the exploitative use of children" rather than to prevent the material from poisoning the minds of its viewers.&lt;!--quote source?--&gt; The three dissenting justices in that case argued, "While the sexual exploitation of children is undoubtedly a serious problem, Ohio may employ other weapons to combat it."&lt;!--quote source?--&gt;

===Censorship in film===
{{main article|Film censorship in the United States}}
This is most notably shown with the "X" rating under which some films are categorized. The most notable films given an "X" rating were ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Devil in Miss Jones]]'' (1973). These films show explicit, non-simulated, penetrative sex that was presented as part of a reasonable plot with respectable production values. Some state authorities issued injunctions against such films to protect "local community standards"; in New York, the print of ''Deep Throat'' was seized mid-run, and the film's exhibitors were found guilty of promoting obscenity.&lt;ref name="filmreference.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Academy-Awards-Crime-Films/Censorship-SEX-AND-VIOLENCE.html |title=Sex and violence - Censorship - actor, film, movie, show, cinema, scene |publisher=Filmreference.com |accessdate=2013-08-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029185451/http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Academy-Awards-Crime-Films/Censorship-SEX-AND-VIOLENCE.html |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the documentary ''[[This Film Is Not Yet Rated]]'', films that include gay sex (even if implied) or female pleasure have been more harshly censored than their heterosexual, male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | title=This Film Is Not Yet Rated | date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) issues [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|ratings]] for motion pictures exhibited and distributed commercially to the public in the United States; the ratings are issued through the Classification and Rating Administration (CARA). The intent of the rating system is to provide information about the content of motion pictures so parents can determine whether an individual motion picture is suitable for viewing by their children.

==United Kingdom==

In the United Kingdom, the [[Obscene Publications Acts]] sets the criteria for what material is allowed to be publicly accessed and distributed.

[[Stanley Kauffmann]]'s novel ''The Philanderer'' was published by Penguin Books in 1957 and was unsuccessfully prosecuted for obscenity.&lt;ref&gt;Kauffmann, S. (1957) ''The Philanderer''. Harmondsworth: Penguin Books "When first published in 1954, this book was the subject of an unsuccessful prosecution for obscene libel. Mr. Justice Stable's historic summing-up on that occasion is included as an appendix."&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex crime has generated particular concern. In 1976 the BBFC claimed that, in that year, it had viewed 58 films depicting "explicit rape", declaring scenes that glorified it as "obscene". As opposed to questions of "indecency", which have been applied to sexual explicitness, films charged with being obscene have been viewed as having "a tendency to deprave and corrupt" and been liable to prosecution.&lt;ref name="filmreference.com"/&gt;

In 2008, the UK prosecuted a man for writing a fictional sex story ([[R v Walker]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/10/06/obscene_publication_girls_aloud/ The Obscene Publications Act rides again.

Obscenity law in [[England and Wales]] is currently governed by the [[Obscene Publications Act]], but obscenity law goes back much further into the English [[common law]]. The conviction in 1727 of [[Edmund Curll]] for the publication of ''[[The Nun in her Smock|Venus in the Cloister or the Nun in her Smock]]'' under the common law offence of [[Breach of the peace|disturbing the peace]] appears to be the first conviction for obscenity in the United Kingdom, and set a [[legal precedent]] for other convictions. These common law ideas of obscenity formed the original basis of obscenity law in other common law countries, such as the United States.

For visual works of art the main obscenity law in England and Wales was, until the 1960s, the [[Vagrancy Act 1838]] which was successfully used in prosecutions against D.H. Lawrence for an exhibition of his paintings at the Warren Gallery, London, in 1929,&lt;ref&gt;See T.W. Earp, 'The Paintings of DH Lawrence' in ''The New Statesman'' (London newspaper), 17 August 1929, p.578&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1966 against the British artist [[Stass Paraskos Obscenity Trial 1966|Stass Paraskos]] for an exhibition of his paintings held that year in the northern English city of [[Leeds]].&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Lynton, Stass Paraskos (Mitcham: Orage Press, 2003) 7f&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the Act were repealed shortly after the Paraskos trial and it has rarely been used since in relation to visual art.

The Obscene Publications act is notoriously vague, defining obscenity as material likely to "deprave and corrupt". The 1959 act was passed just as most [[Western world|Western]] countries were about to enter a new phase of [[sexual freedom]]. The trial of [[Penguin Books]] over [[Lady Chatterley's Lover]] in 1960 failed to secure a conviction and the conviction in the 1971 trial of [[Oz (magazine)|Oz magazine]] was overturned on appeal. An attempt to prosecute the [[University of Central England]] in 1997 over a copy of a library book by [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] was abandoned amidst derision from [[academics]] and [[News media|the media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uce.ac.uk/mapplethorpe/ |title=After a year out on loan Mapplethorpe book is set to return to library shelves|accessdate=6 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823022442/http://www.uce.ac.uk/mapplethorpe/ |archivedate=23 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s most Western countries legalised [[hardcore pornography]]. By the 1980s the UK was almost the only [[liberal democracy]] where the sale of hardcore pornography was still completely illegal, although ownership was not a criminal offence (except [[child pornography]]). Home [[videotape]] was a booming market and it was relatively simple for individuals to [[smuggling|smuggle]] hardcore material in from [[Europe]] or the United States, where it had been purchased legally, either for personal use or to copy it for distribution. This resulted in a considerable [[black market]] of poor quality videotapes. Meanwhile, people attempting to buy pornography legally would often be stuck with heavily censored [[R18 (British Board of Film Classification)|R18 certificate]] material.

While the authorities did their best to stay on top of illegal pornography they found that [[jury|juries]], while not particularly liking the material, were reluctant to convict defendants where the material was intended for private use among consenting adults. During the 1990s the advent of the [[internet]] made it easier than ever before for British citizens to access hardcore material. Finally, in 2000, following the dismissal of a test case brought by the [[BBFC]], hardcore pornography was effectively legalised, subject to certain conditions and licensing restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.melonfarmers.co.uk/faqvideo.htm |title=FAQ: Buying Adult Films: Is it legal? |publisher=Melonfarmers.co.uk |accessdate=2013-08-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808192607/http://melonfarmers.co.uk/faqvideo.htm |archivedate=8 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still an offence to sell obscene material by [[mail order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4573507.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; High Court blocks web porn sales |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-05-23 |accessdate=2013-08-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620115419/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4573507.stm |archivedate=20 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1984 videotape sellers were more likely to be prosecuted under the [[Video Recordings Act 1984|Video Recordings Act]] rather than the OPA. The VRA requires that all videos must have a certificate from the BBFC. If the BBFC refuses a certificate a video is effectively banned for home viewing, but not necessarily in the [[Movie theater|cinema]]. Four films that were originally refused a certificate, [[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]], [[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]], [[The Evil Dead]] and [[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]] were granted a certificate in the late 1990s and have subsequently been screened on mainstream [[television]].

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand, screening of ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' (1972) was only cleared in 1986. However, the film has not been screened because the only cinema that has tried to organize a screening was thwarted by the city council that owned the building's lease.&lt;ref name="filmreference.com"/&gt;

Section 163 of the Canadian Criminal Code provides the country's legal definition of "obscenity". Officially termed as

The current law states

163. (1) Every one commits an offense who

:(a) makes, prints, publishes, distributes, circulates, or has in his possession for the purpose of publication, distribution or circulation any obscene written matter, picture, model, phonograph record or other thing whatever; or

:(b) makes, prints, publishes, distributes, sells or has in his possession for the purposes of publication, distribution or circulation a crime comic.

"Crime comics" are stated to be books that glorify criminal activities and have at least one depiction of such criminal actions of the book's text.

The [[Canada Border Services Agency]] seizes items it labels obscene.

In 1993, Canadian police arrested the 19-year-old writer of a fictional sex story "The Forestwood Kids"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efc.ca/pages/media/id.25jan96.html|title=Child-less Pornography|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310121053/http://www.efc.ca/pages/media/id.25jan96.html|archivedate=10 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the case was dismissed in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efc.ca/pages/law/court/R.v.Pecciarich.html|title=Regina v.

Ever since 1940, in the Title VI of the Penal Code, naming crimes against sexual dignity (until 2009 crimes against social conventions), the fourth chapter is dedicated to a crime named "public outrage related to modesty" ({{lang-pt|ultraje público ao pudor}}, {{IPA-pt|uwˈtɾaʒi ˈpublikw aw puˈdoʁ|pron}}).

It is composed of two articles, Art. 233 "Obscene Act", "to practice an obscene act in a public place, or open or exposed to the public", punished with arrest of 3 months to 1 year or a fine; and Art. 234 "Obscene Written Piece or Object", to do, import, export, purchase or have in one's property, to ends of trade, distribution or public display, any written, drew, painted, stamped or object piece of obscenity, punished with arrest of 6 months to 1 years or a fine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dji.com.br/codigos/1940_dl_002848_cp/cp233a234.htm DJi -233 a 234- DL-002.848-1940 - Còdigo Penal - Ultraje Público ao Pudor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918053011/http://www.dji.com.br/codigos/1940_dl_002848_cp/cp233a234.htm |date=18 September 2013 }} {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* They do not attack anyone's sexual dignity, instead causing outrage at best, but generally just slight discomfort or embarrassment, that can be easily avoided through not looking to such a scene.
* The Art. 234 is aside obsolete, unconstitutional, for the 1988 post-military dictatorship Constitution having in its Fifth Chapter: "[the people] are free to the expression of intellectual, artistic, scientific and communicative activity, independently of censorship and license", reason to which, instead of making it suffer penal restriction, gives any distribution of media the right to be fully exerted.
* The flourishing internet culture of Brazil, where such media is freely shared, as well as its pornographic industry and shops catered to the interests of enhancing apparatus to masturbatory and sexual activity.

It is often used against people who expose their nude bodies in public environments that were not warranted a license to cater to the demographic interested in such practice (the first such place was the Praia do Abricó in Rio de Janeiro, in 1994), even if no sexual action took place, and it may include for example a double standard for the chest area of women and men in which only women are penalized.

Various countries have different standings on the types of materials that they as legal bodies permit their citizens to have access to and disseminate among their local populations. The set of these countries' permissible content vary widely accordingly with some having extreme punishment up to and including execution for members who violate their restrictions, as in the case of Iran where the current laws against pornography now include death sentences for those convicted of producing pornography.&lt;ref&gt;Saeed Kamali Dehghan (18 January 2012) [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/18/iran-death-sentence-porn-programmer "Iran confirms death sentence for 'porn site' web programmer"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904152548/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/18/iran-death-sentence-porn-programmer |date=4 September 2017 }} ''The Guardian''.

In India the Obscenity law is the same as had been framed by the British Government. Charges of obscenity have been levelled against various writers and poets till date; the law has not yet been revised. The famous trials relate to the [[Hungryalists]] who were arrested and prosecuted in the 1960s.

{{statistical mechanics}}

In [[physics]], a '''partition function''' describes the [[statistics|statistical]] properties of a system in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]{{Citation needed|reason=definition of partition function requires referencing|date=December 2016}}. Partition functions are [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of the thermodynamic [[state function|state variables]],  such as the [[temperature]] and [[volume]]. Most of the aggregate [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] variables of the system, such as the [[energy|total energy]], [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]], [[entropy]], and [[pressure]], can be expressed in terms of the partition function or its [[derivative]]s. The partition function is dimensionless, it is a pure number.

Each partition function is constructed to represent a particular [[statistical ensemble]] (which, in turn, corresponds to a particular [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]). The most common statistical ensembles have named partition functions. The '''canonical partition function''' applies to a [[canonical ensemble]], in which the system is allowed to exchange [[heat]] with the [[Environment (systems)|environment]] at fixed temperature, volume, and [[number of particles]]. The '''grand canonical partition function''' applies to a [[grand canonical ensemble]], in which the system can exchange both heat and particles with the environment, at fixed temperature, volume, and [[chemical potential]]. Other types of partition functions can be defined for different circumstances; see [[partition function (mathematics)]] for generalizations. The partition function has many physical meanings, as discussed in [[#Meaning and significance|Meaning and significance]].

== Canonical partition function ==

=== Definition ===
Initially, let us assume that a thermodynamically large system is in [[thermal contact]] with the environment, with a temperature ''T'', and both the volume of the system and the number of constituent particles are fixed. A collection of this kind of systems comprises an ensemble called a [[canonical ensemble]]. The appropriate [[mathematical expression]] for the canonical partition function depends on the [[degrees of freedom]] of the system, whether the context is [[classical mechanics]] or [[quantum mechanics]], and whether the spectrum of states is [[Discrete mathematics|discrete]] or [[Probability distribution#Continuous probability distribution|continuous]].{{Citation needed|reason=definition of partition function requires referencing|date=December 2016}}

;Classical discrete system

For a canonical ensemble that is classical and discrete, the canonical partition function is defined as
:&lt;math&gt; Z = \sum_{i} \mathrm{e}^{-\beta E_i}, &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{e} &lt;/math&gt; is [[e (mathematical constant)|Euler's number]],
:&lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; is the index for the [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]] of the system,
:&lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermodynamic beta]], defined as &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{1}{k_\text{B} T} &lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; E_i &lt;/math&gt; is the total energy of the system in the respective [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]].

The [[Exponential function|exponential]] factor exp(−''βE&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') is known as the [[Boltzmann factor]].

! Derivation of canonical partition function (classical, discrete)
|-
|
There are multiple approaches to deriving the partition function. The following derivation follows the powerful and general [[information theory|information-theoretic]] [[Edwin Thompson Jaynes|Jaynesian]] [[maximum entropy thermodynamics|maximum entropy]] approach.

According to the [[second law of thermodynamics]], a system assumes a configuration of [[maximum entropy thermodynamics|maximum entropy]] at [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]{{Citation needed|reason=important statement with profound consequences|date=December 2016}}. We seek a probability distribution of states &lt;math&gt; \rho_i &lt;/math&gt; that maximizes the discrete [[entropy (statistical thermodynamics)#Gibbs entropy formula|Gibbs entropy]]

:&lt;math&gt; S = - k_\text{B} \sum_i \rho_i \ln \rho_i &lt;/math&gt;

subject to two physical constraints:

1. The probabilities of all states add to unity:
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_i \rho_i = 1.
&lt;/math&gt;

2. In the [[canonical ensemble]], the average energy is fixed:
:&lt;math&gt;
\langle E \rangle = \sum_i \rho_i E_i \equiv U.
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the method of [[Lagrange multipliers]], we write the Lagrangian (or Lagrange function) &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} &lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt; 
\mathcal{L} = \left( -k_\text{B} \sum_i \rho_i \ln \rho_i \right) + \lambda_1 \left( \sum_i \rho_i - 1 \right) + \lambda_2 \left( \sum_i \rho_i E_i - U \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating and extremizing &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} &lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt; \rho_i &lt;/math&gt; leads to

:&lt;math&gt;
0 = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \rho_i} = -k_\text{B} \ln \rho_i - k_\text{B} + \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 E_i.
&lt;/math&gt;

Isolating for &lt;math&gt; \rho_i &lt;/math&gt; yields

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho_i = \exp \left( \frac{-k_\text{B} + \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 E_i}{k_\text{B}} \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

To obtain &lt;math&gt; \lambda_1 &lt;/math&gt;, one substitutes the probability into the first constraint:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
1 &amp;= \sum_i \rho_i \\
  &amp;= \exp \left( \frac{-k_\text{B} + \lambda_1}{k_\text{B}} \right) Z,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

which yields &lt;math&gt; \lambda_1/k_B = \ln(1/Z) + 1 &lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt; Z &lt;/math&gt; is defined as the canonical ensemble partition function:

:&lt;math&gt;
Z \equiv \sum_i \exp \left( \frac{\lambda_2}{k_\text{B}} E_i \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

Rewriting &lt;math&gt; \rho_i &lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math&gt; Z &lt;/math&gt; gives

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho_i = \frac{1}{Z} \exp \left( \frac{\lambda_2}{k_\text{B}} E_i \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

Rewriting &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math&gt; Z &lt;/math&gt; gives

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
S &amp;= - k_\text{B} \sum_i \rho_i \ln \rho_i \\
  &amp;= - k_\text{B} \sum_i \rho_i \left( \frac{\lambda_2}{k_\text{B}} E_i - \ln(Z) \right) \\
  &amp;= - \lambda_2 \sum_i \rho_i E_i + k_\text{B} \ln(Z) \sum_i \rho_i \\
  &amp;= - \lambda_2 U + k_\text{B} \ln(Z).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

To obtain &lt;math&gt; \lambda_2 &lt;/math&gt;, we differentiate &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; with respect to the average energy &lt;math&gt; U &lt;/math&gt; and apply the fact that &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial{\ln Z}}{\partial \lambda_2} = \frac{\langle E \rangle}{k_\text{B}} = \frac{U}{k_\text{B}} &lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial S}{\partial U} = -\lambda_2 \equiv \frac{1}{T}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the canonical partition function &lt;math&gt; Z &lt;/math&gt; becomes

:&lt;math&gt;
Z \equiv \sum_i \mathrm{e}^{-\beta E_i},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \beta \equiv 1/(k_\text{B} T) &lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermodynamic beta]]. Finally, the probability distribution &lt;math&gt; \rho_i &lt;/math&gt; and entropy &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; are respectively

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\rho_i &amp; = \frac{1}{Z} \mathrm{e}^{-\beta E_i}, \\
S &amp; = \frac{U}{T} + k_\text{B} \ln Z.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

;Classical continuous system

In [[classical mechanics]], the [[Position (vector)|position]] and [[Momentum vector|momentum]] variables of a particle can vary continuously, so the set of microstates is actually [[uncountable set|uncountable]]. In ''classical'' statistical mechanics, it is rather inaccurate to express the partition function as a [[Sum (mathematics)|sum]] of discrete terms. In this case we must describe the partition function using an [[integral]] rather than a sum. For a canonical ensemble that is classical and continuous, the canonical partition function is defined as
: &lt;math&gt; Z = \frac{1}{h^3} \int \mathrm{e}^{-\beta H(q, p)} \,d^3 q \,d^3 p, &lt;/math&gt;
where
: &lt;math&gt; h &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Planck constant]],
: &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermodynamic beta]], defined as &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{1}{k_\text{B} T} &lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt; H(q, p) &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] of the system,
: &lt;math&gt; q &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Canonical coordinates|canonical position]],
: &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Canonical coordinates|canonical momentum]].

To make it into a dimensionless quantity, we must divide it by ''h'', which is some quantity with units of [[action (physics)|action]] (usually taken to be [[Planck's constant]]).

;Classical continuous system (multiple identical particles)

For a gas of ''N'' identical classical particles, the partition function is

: &lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{1}{N! h^{3N}} \int \exp[-\beta H(p_1, \dots, p_N, x_1,
\dots, x_N)] \,d^3 p_1 \cdots d^3 p_N \,d^3 x_1 \cdots  d^3 x_N, &lt;/math&gt;

where

: ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' indicate particle momenta,
: ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' indicate particle positions,
: ''d''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is a shorthand notation serving as a reminder that the ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are vectors in three-dimensional space,
: ''H'' is the classical [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]].

The reason for the [[factorial]] factor ''N''! is discussed [[#Partition functions of subsystems|below]]. The extra constant factor introduced in the denominator was introduced because, unlike the discrete form, the continuous form shown above is not [[dimensionless]]. As stated in the previous section, to make it into a dimensionless quantity, we must divide it by ''h''&lt;sup&gt;3''N''&lt;/sup&gt; (where ''h'' is usually taken to be Planck's constant).

;Quantum mechanical discrete system

For a canonical ensemble that is quantum mechanical and discrete, the canonical partition function is defined as the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the Boltzmann factor:
: &lt;math&gt; Z = \operatorname{tr} (\mathrm{e}^{-\beta \hat{H}}), &lt;/math&gt;
where
: &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermodynamic beta]], defined as &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{1}{k_\text{B} T} &lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt; \hat{H} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian operator]].
The [[dimension]] of &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{e}^{-\beta \hat{H}} &lt;/math&gt; is the number of [[energy eigenstates]] of the system.

;Quantum mechanical continuous system

For a canonical ensemble that is quantum mechanical and continuous, the canonical partition function is defined as
: &lt;math&gt; Z = \frac{1}{h} \int \langle q, p | \mathrm{e}^{-\beta \hat{H}} | q, p \rangle \,dq \,dp, &lt;/math&gt;
where
: &lt;math&gt; h &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Planck constant]],
: &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermodynamic beta]], defined as &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{1}{k_\text{B} T} &lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt; \hat{H} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian operator]],
: &lt;math&gt; q &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Canonical coordinates|canonical position]],
: &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Canonical coordinates|canonical momentum]].

In systems with multiple [[quantum states]] ''s'' sharing the same energy ''E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', it is said that the [[energy levels]] of the system are [[Degenerate energy levels|degenerate]]. In the case of degenerate energy levels, we can write the partition function in terms of the contribution from energy levels (indexed by ''j'') as follows:

: &lt;math&gt; Z = \sum_j g_j \cdot \mathrm{e}^{-\beta E_j},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''g&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the degeneracy factor, or number of quantum states ''s'' that have the same energy level defined by ''E&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The above treatment applies to ''quantum'' [[statistical mechanics]], where a physical system inside a [[Particle in a box|finite-sized box]] will typically have a discrete set of energy eigenstates, which we can use as the states ''s'' above. In quantum mechanics, the partition function can be more formally written as a trace over the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|state space]] (which is independent of the choice of [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]):

: &lt;math&gt;Z = \operatorname{tr} ( \mathrm{e}^{-\beta \hat{H}} ),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Ĥ'' is the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|quantum Hamiltonian operator]]. The exponential of an operator can be defined using the [[Characterizations of the exponential function|exponential power series]].

The classical form of ''Z'' is recovered when the trace is expressed in terms of [[coherent state]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=John R. |last1=Klauder |first2=Bo-Sture |last2=Skagerstam
|title=Coherent States: Applications in Physics and Mathematical Physics
|publisher=World Scientific |date=1985 |pages=71–73 |isbn=978-9971-966-52-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and when quantum-mechanical [[uncertainty principle|uncertainties]] in the position and momentum of a particle 
are regarded as negligible. Formally, using [[bra–ket notation]], one inserts under the trace for each degree of freedom the identity:
:&lt;math&gt;
 \boldsymbol{1} = \int |x, p\rangle \langle x,p| \frac{dx \,dp}{h},
&lt;/math&gt;
where {{!}}''x'', ''p''{{rangle}} is a [[Normalizing constant|normalised]] [[Wave packet#Gaussian wave packets in quantum mechanics|Gaussian wavepacket]] centered at
position ''x'' and momentum ''p''. Thus
:&lt;math&gt;
 Z = \int \operatorname{tr} \left( \mathrm{e}^{-\beta\hat{H}} |x, p\rangle \langle x, p| \right) \frac{dx \,dp}{h}
   = \int \langle x,p| \mathrm{e}^{-\beta\hat{H}} |x, p\rangle \frac{dx \,dp}{h}.
&lt;/math&gt;
A coherent state is an approximate eigenstate of both operators &lt;math&gt; \hat{x} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \hat{p} &lt;/math&gt;, hence also of the Hamiltonian ''Ĥ'', with errors of the size of the uncertainties. If Δ''x'' and Δ''p'' can be regarded as zero, the action of ''Ĥ'' reduces to multiplication by the classical Hamiltonian, and ''Z'' reduces to the classical configuration integral.

=== Connection to probability theory ===

For simplicity, we will use the discrete form of the partition function in this section. Our results will apply equally well to the continuous form.

Consider a system ''S'' embedded into a [[heat bath]] ''B''. Let the total [[energy]] of both systems be ''E''. Let ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' denote the [[probability]] that the [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]] that system ''S'' is in has energy ''E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. According to the [[Statistical mechanics#Fundamental postulate|fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics]] (which states that all attainable microstates of a system are equally probable), the probability ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' will be proportional to the number of microstates of the total [[Closed system (thermodynamics)|closed system]] (''S'', ''B'') in which ''S'' is in microstate ''i'' with energy ''E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. Equivalently, ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' will be proportional to the number of microstates of the heat bath ''B'' with energy ''E'' − ''E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt;
 p_i = \frac{\Omega_B(E - E_i)}{\Omega_B(E)}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming that the heat bath's internal energy is much larger than the energy of ''S'' (''E'' ≫ ''E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''), we can [[Taylor expansion|Taylor-expand]] &lt;math&gt;\Omega_B&lt;/math&gt; to first order in ''E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and use the thermodynamic relation &lt;math&gt;\partial S_B/\partial E = 1/T&lt;/math&gt;, where here &lt;math&gt;S_B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; are the entropy and temperature of the bath respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 k \ln p_i &amp;= k \ln \Omega_B(E - E_i) - k \ln \Omega_B(E) \\
  &amp;\approx -\frac{\partial\big(k \ln \Omega_B(E)\big)}{\partial E} E_i \\
  &amp;\approx -\frac{\partial S_B}{\partial E} E_i \\
  &amp;\approx -\frac{E_i}{T} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus
:&lt;math&gt;
 p_i \propto e^{-\frac{E_i}{kT}} = e^{-\beta E_i}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the total probability to find the system in ''some'' microstate (the sum of all ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') must be equal to 1, we can define the partition function as the [[Normalizing constant|normalization constant]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
 Z =  \sum_i e^{-\beta E_i}.
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Calculating the thermodynamic total energy ===

In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the partition function, let us calculate the thermodynamic value of the total energy. This is simply the [[expected value]], or [[ensemble average]] for the energy, which is the sum of the microstate energies weighted by their probabilities:

: &lt;math&gt;\langle E \rangle = \sum_s E_s P_s = \frac{1}{Z} \sum_s E_s
e^{- \beta E_s} = - \frac{1}{Z} \frac{\partial}{\partial \beta}
Z(\beta, E_1, E_2, \cdots) = - \frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial \beta}
&lt;/math&gt;

or, equivalently,

: &lt;math&gt;\langle E\rangle = k_B T^2 \frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial T}.&lt;/math&gt;

Incidentally, one should note that if the microstate energies depend on a parameter λ in the manner

: &lt;math&gt;E_s = E_s^{(0)} + \lambda A_s \qquad \mbox{for all}\; s &lt;/math&gt;

then the expected value of ''A'' is

: &lt;math&gt;\langle A\rangle = \sum_s A_s P_s = -\frac{1}{\beta}
\frac{\partial}{\partial\lambda} \ln Z(\beta,\lambda).&lt;/math&gt;

This provides us with a method for calculating the expected values of many microscopic quantities. We add the quantity artificially to the microstate energies (or, in the language of quantum mechanics, to the Hamiltonian), calculate the new partition function and expected value, and then set ''λ'' to zero in the final expression. This is analogous to the [[source field]] method used in the [[path integral formulation]] of [[quantum field theory]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

=== Relation to thermodynamic variables ===

In this section, we will state the relationships between the partition function and the various thermodynamic parameters of the system. These results can be derived using the method of the previous section and the various thermodynamic relations.

As we have already seen, the thermodynamic energy is

: &lt;math&gt;\langle E \rangle = - \frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial \beta}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[variance]] in the energy (or "energy fluctuation") is

: &lt;math&gt;\langle (\Delta E)^2 \rangle \equiv \langle (E - \langle
E\rangle)^2 \rangle = \frac{\partial^2 \ln Z}{\partial \beta^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[heat capacity]] is

: &lt;math&gt;C_v = \frac{\partial \langle E\rangle}{\partial T} = \frac{1}{k_B T^2} \langle (\Delta E)^2 \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[entropy]] is

: &lt;math&gt;S \equiv -k_B\sum_s P_s\ln P_s= k_B (\ln Z + \beta \langle E\rangle)=\frac{\partial}{\partial T}(k_B T \ln Z) =-\frac{\partial A}{\partial T}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' is the [[Helmholtz free energy]] defined as ''A'' = ''U'' − ''TS'', where ''U'' = {{langle}}''E''{{rangle}} is the total energy and ''S'' is the [[entropy]], so that

: &lt;math&gt;A = \langle E\rangle -TS= - k_B T \ln Z.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Partition functions of subsystems ===

Suppose a system is subdivided into ''N'' sub-systems with negligible interaction energy, that is, we can assume the particles are essentially non-interacting. If the partition functions of the sub-systems are ''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;, then the partition function of the entire system is the ''product'' of the individual partition functions:

: &lt;math&gt;Z =\prod_{j=1}^{N} \zeta_j.&lt;/math&gt;

If the sub-systems have the same physical properties, then their partition functions are equal, ζ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ζ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ... = ζ, in which case

: &lt;math&gt;Z = \zeta^N.&lt;/math&gt;

However, there is a well-known exception to this rule. If the sub-systems are actually [[identical particles]], in the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] sense that they are impossible to distinguish even in principle, the total partition function must be divided by a ''N''! (''N'' [[factorial]]):

: &lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{\zeta^N}{N!}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is to ensure that we do not "over-count" the number of microstates. While this may seem like a strange requirement, it is actually necessary to preserve the existence of a thermodynamic limit for such systems. This is known as the [[Gibbs paradox]].

=== Meaning and significance ===

It may not be obvious why the partition function, as we have defined it above, is an important quantity. First, let us consider what goes into it. The partition function is a function of the temperature ''T'' and the microstate energies ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''E''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. The microstate energies are determined by other thermodynamic variables, such as the number of particles and the volume, as well as microscopic quantities like the mass of the constituent particles. This dependence on microscopic variables is the central point of statistical mechanics. With a model of the microscopic constituents of a system, one can calculate the microstate energies, and thus the partition function, which will then allow us to calculate all the other thermodynamic properties of the system.

The partition function can be related to thermodynamic properties because it has a very important statistical meaning. The probability ''P&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' that the system occupies microstate ''s'' is

: &lt;math&gt;P_s = \frac{1}{Z} \mathrm{e}^{- \beta E_s}. &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, as shown above, the partition function plays the role of a normalizing constant (note that it does ''not'' depend on ''s''), ensuring that the probabilities sum up to one:

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_s P_s = \frac{1}{Z} \sum_s \mathrm{e}^{- \beta E_s} = \frac{1}{Z} Z
= 1. &lt;/math&gt;

This is the reason for calling ''Z'' the "partition function": it encodes how the probabilities are partitioned among the different microstates, based on their individual energies. The letter ''Z'' stands for the [[German language|German]] word ''Zustandssumme'', "sum over states". The usefulness of the partition function stems from the fact that it can be used to relate macroscopic [[thermodynamic state|thermodynamic quantities]] to the microscopic details of a system through the derivatives of its partition function. Finding the partition function is also equivalent to performing a laplace transform of the density of states function from the energy domain to the β domain, and the inverse laplace transform of the partition function reclaims the state density function of energies.

==Grand canonical partition function==
{{main|Grand canonical ensemble}}

We can define a '''grand canonical partition function''' for a [[grand canonical ensemble]], which describes the statistics of a constant-volume system that can exchange both heat and particles with a reservoir.
The reservoir has a constant temperature ''T'', and a [[chemical potential]] ''μ''.

The grand canonical partition function, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, is the following sum over [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{Z}(\mu, V, T) = \sum_{i} \exp((N_i\mu - E_i)/k_B T).  &lt;/math&gt;
Here, each microstate is labelled by &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, and has total particle number &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; and total energy &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt;.
This partition function is closely related to the [[Grand potential]], &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{\rm G}&lt;/math&gt;, by the relation
:&lt;math&gt; -k_B T \ln \mathcal{Z} = \Phi_{\rm G} = \langle E \rangle - TS - \mu \langle N\rangle. &lt;/math&gt;
This can be contrasted to the canonical partition function above, which is related instead to the [[Helmholtz free energy]].

It is important to note that the number of microstates in the grand canonical ensemble may be much larger than in the canonical ensemble,
since here we consider not only variations in energy but also in particle number.
Again, the utility of the grand canonical partition function is that it is related to the probability that the system is in state &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; p_i = \frac{1}{\mathcal Z} \exp((N_i\mu - E_i)/k_B T) .&lt;/math&gt;

An important application of the grand canonical ensemble is in deriving exactly the statistics of a non-interacting many-body quantum gas ([[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] for fermions, [[Bose–Einstein statistics]] for bosons), however it is much more generally applicable than that.
The grand canonical ensemble may also be used to describe classical systems, or even interacting quantum gases.

The grand partition function is sometimes written (equivalently) in terms of alternate variables as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 9780120831807 | title = Exactly solved models in statistical mechanics | last1 = Baxter | first1 = Rodney J. | year = 1982 | publisher = Academic Press Inc.  | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{Z}(z, V, T) = \sum_{N_i} z^{N_i} Z(N_i, V, T), &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;z \equiv \exp(\mu/kT)&lt;/math&gt; is known as the absolute [[activity (chemistry)|activity]] (or [[fugacity]]) and &lt;math&gt;Z(N_i, V, T)&lt;/math&gt; is the canonical partition function.

In [[mathematics]], a '''periodic sequence''' (sometimes called a '''cycle''') is a [[sequence]] for which the same [[term (logic)|terms]] are repeated over and over:

:''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, ...

The number ''p'' of repeated terms is called the '''period''' ([[frequency|period]]).

==Definition==
A periodic sequence is a sequence ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ... satisfying

:''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+''p''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;

for all values of ''n''.  If we regard a sequence as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] whose domain is the set of [[natural number]]s, then a periodic sequence is simply a special type of [[periodic function]].

==Examples==
The sequence of digits in the [[decimal]] expansion of 1/7 is periodic with period 6:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{7} = 0.142857\,142857\,142857\,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, the sequence of digits in the decimal expansion of any [[rational number]] is eventually periodic (see below).

The sequence of powers of &amp;minus;1 is periodic with period two:

:&lt;math&gt;-1,1,-1,1,-1,1,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, the sequence of powers of any [[root of unity]] is periodic.  The same holds true for the powers of any element of finite [[order (group theory)|order]] in a [[group (mathematics)|group]].

A [[periodic point]] for a function {{math|''f'' : ''X'' → ''X''}} is a point {{mvar|x}} whose [[orbit (dynamics)|orbit]]

:&lt;math&gt;x,\, f(x),\, f(f(x)),\, f^3(x),\, f^4(x),\, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;

is a periodic sequence.  Here, &lt;math&gt;f^n(x)&lt;/math&gt; means the {{nowrap|{{mvar|n}}-fold}} [[Function composition|composition]] of {{mvar|f}} applied to {{mvar|x}}. Periodic points are important in the theory of [[dynamical systems]].  Every function from a [[finite set]] to itself has a periodic point; [[cycle detection]] is the algorithmic problem of finding such a point.

==Periodic 0, 1 sequences==

Any periodic sequence can be constructed by element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of periodic sequences consisting of zeros and ones. Periodic zero and one sequences can be expressed as sums of trigonometric functions:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{1} \cos (-\pi\frac{(k-1)}{1})/1 = 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1...&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{2} \cos (2\pi\frac{(k-1)}{2})/2 = 0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0...&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{3} \cos (2\pi\frac{(k-1)}{3})/3 = 0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1...&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;...&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{N} \cos (2\pi\frac{(k-1)}{N})/N = 0,0,0...,1 \text{  sequence with period  } N &lt;/math&gt;

==Generalizations==
A sequence is '''eventually periodic''' if it can be made periodic by dropping some finite number of terms from the beginning.  For example, the sequence of digits in the decimal expansion of 1/56 is eventually periodic:

: 1 / 56 = 0 . 0 1 7&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;8 5 7 1 4 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;8 5 7 1 4 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;8 5 7 1 4 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;...

A sequence is '''asymptotically periodic''' if its terms approach those of a periodic sequence.  That is, the sequence ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;... is asymptotically periodic if there exists a periodic sequence ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;... for which

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} x_n - a_n = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, the sequence

:1 / 3,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 / 3,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 / 4,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 / 4,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 / 5,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 / 5,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;...

is asymptotically periodic, since its terms approach those of the periodic sequence 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, ....

&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
'''Purposive behaviorism''' is a branch of psychology that was introduced by [[Edward Tolman]]. It combines the objective study of behavior while also considering the purpose or goal of behavior.&lt;ref name="schultz"&gt;Schultz, D.P. &amp; Schultz, S.E. (2012). ''A history of modern psychology.'' (10). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; Tolman thought that learning developed from knowledge about the environment and how the organism relates to its environment.&lt;ref name="muskingum.edu"&gt;http://www.muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/tolman.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Tolman’s goal was to identify the complex cognitive mechanisms and purposes that guided behavior.&lt;ref name="Eichenenbaum, H. 2001"&gt;Eichenenbaum, H. (2001). The hippocampus and declarative memory: Cognitive mechanisms and neural codes. ''Behavioural Brain Research 127(1)'', 199-207.&lt;/ref&gt; His theories on learning went against the traditionally accepted stimulus-response connections (see [[classical conditioning]]) at this time that were proposed by other psychologists such as [[Edward Thorndike]]. Tolman disagreed with Watson’s behaviorism, so he initiated his own behaviorism, which became known as purposive behaviorism.

Tolman's purposive behaviorism focused on meaningful behavior, or [[Behaviourism#Molecular versus molar behaviourism|molar behavior]], such as kicking a ball. This focus was in contrast to simple muscle movements aka molecular behavior such as flexing of the leg muscle. Tolman regarded the molecular behavior as fairly removed from human perceptual capacities for a meaningful analysis of behavior. This approach of Tolman’s was first introduced in his book, ''Purposive Behavior in Animals and Men'', published in 1932.&lt;ref name="schultz"/&gt; To Tolman, it was obvious that all actions of behavior are goal-oriented, including those for animals.&lt;ref name="schultz"/&gt; The main difference between behaviorism and Tolman's purposive behaviorism is that behavior is goal oriented.

== Tolman's cognitive maps, 1948 ==

=== Tolman's experiment ===
Tolman’s investigation used rats to represent clinical behaviors of men. He had the rats go through mazes. A hungry rat was put at the entrance of a maze, wandering through it until he gets to the food. In the maze, there are true segment paths and blind alleys. Trials for every rat reoccurred every 24 hours. The more trials the rats completed, the fewer errors, which he characterized by the rat avoiding the blind alleys. They made as well as taking less time to complete the maze and get to their goal which was their food.&lt;ref&gt;Tolman, E. (1948). Cognitive maps in rats and men. Psychological Review 55, 189-208.&lt;/ref&gt;

A maze was used by Tolman in the following experiment: at point A, a hungry rat was placed as the starting point; point B was where the food for the rat was placed. The rat learned to get to B for food throughout the trials.

In these experiments, Tolman was looking at how the reinforcement in the trials contributed to the rat learning their way through the maze and to the food with fewer errors.&lt;ref name="muskingum.edu"/&gt; Tolman’s evaluation of these experiments led to his theory of [[latent learning]].

=== Tolman's interpretation of the experiment ===
Tolman wondered what the rat had learned when he quickly discovered how to go through the maze to get to the food. Tolman believed that the rat had developed a cognitive map of his maze, with knowledge of where the food was located. With this research, he believed this experiment supported his notion that this learning was not rooted in stimulus-response connections but in the nervous system of sets which are to function like [[cognitive maps]]. Also, Tolman assumed that these cognitive maps vary from a narrow strip of variety to a broader, comprehensive variety. Tolman showed in his study that the rats exhibited a capability of latent learning. The results showed that the rats used [[Problem solving#Psychology)|problem solving]] because of the absence of reinforcement, which could not have been resolved by S-R representations.&lt;ref name="Eichenenbaum, H. 2001"/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Tolman’s followers, also referred to as Tolmaniacs, developed a test to further support Tolman’s findings and again refute the stimulus-response explanation of the experiment. Once a rat had learned to run from A to B, the starting point was changed from point A to point C. According to the stimulus-response theory, the rat has learned to simply move to the right in the A to B trials, so it the new starting point was C, the rat would go to D. In contrast, Tolman’s cognitive map explanation predicted the rat would return to point B even if starting at the new point, C. The new tests supported Tolman’s findings of a cognitive map, for the rat continued to reach point B.&lt;ref name="muskingum.edu"/&gt;

== Tolman's published works on purposive behaviorism ==
From 1920 to 1928, Tolman published numerous articles in the Psychological Review that attempted to objectively define such concepts as instinct, consciousness, emotions, purpose, and cognition. Tolman coined the term "purposive behaviorism" when he published "Purposive Behavior in Animals and Men" (1932), which summarized these theoretical concepts and supported them with data he obtained from numerous studies. In this publication, Tolman demonstrated that insight, or our cognitive control of learning, was not restricted by evolutionary capabilities.&lt;ref name="muskingum.edu"/&gt;

Like many other behaviorists in his time, he carried out these studies with rats, believing that "everything important in psychology can be investigated in essence through the continued experimental and theoretical analysis of the determiners of rat behavior at a choice point in a maze." In this book, he described purposive behavior as behavior directed toward some ultimate goal. Examples he gave of this kind of behavior were "a rat running a maze, a man driving home to dinner, a child hiding from a stranger, a woman gossiping over the telephone, etc." Tolman's purposive behaviorism was not as widely received in its day as other psychological theories. This was largely due to the fact that many did not consider its foundation to being in line with behaviorism at all, which was the dominating force in psychology at the time. However, the insistence on studying implicit mental concepts as opposed to looking solely at explicit behavior was an idea that opened the door to the school of cognitive psychology. While much work in purposive behaviorism was dismissed by the mainstream of psychologists in its time, many of Tolman's publications, most notably "Purposive Behavior in Animals and Men" and "Cognitive Maps in Rats and Men", continue to be cited in today's research.

'''Ralph Mark Gilbert''' (March 17, 1899, [[Jacksonville, Florida]] - August 23, 1956, [[New York City]]) was an American [[Civil rights movement|civil rights]] leader and a [[Progressive National Baptist Convention|Baptist]] minister.

==Religious Ministry==
From 1939 until his death in 1956, he was the Pastor of the [[First African Baptist Church (Savannah)|First African Baptist Church]], located at
23 Montgomery Street on Franklin Square in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]]'s Historic District.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldestblackchurch.org/html/body_r.gilbert.htm Reverend Ralph Mark Gilbert, First African Baptist Church, Savannah]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil Rights==

From 1942 to 1950, Gilbert served as president of the Savannah Branch of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sip.armstrong.edu/CivilRightsMuseum/info.html The Ralph Mark Gilbert Civil Rights Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; Under his tenure, the local chapter was reorganized, hundreds of [[African-American|Blacks]] were registered to vote, a progressive white [[Democratic Party of the United States|Democratic]] politician, [[John G. Kennedy]], became [[Mayors of Savannah, Georgia|Mayor of Savannah]] and the city's Police Department hired its first Black police officers, known as the ''Original Nine''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savannahnow.com/node/330229 Son of city's 10th black police officer pens book, Adam Crisp, Savannah Morning News, July 23, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Reverend Gilbert died August 23, 1956 while on vacation in New York City, New York.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Savannah Tribune, August 30, 1956, page 1 and Savannah Morning News, August 28, 1956, page 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

==Honors==
Savannah's [[Ralph Mark Gilbert Civil Rights Museum]] is named in honor of Dr. Gilbert. The museum is located at 460 Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd.in the Wage Earners Bank building constructed in 1914. Renovation of the building began in 1993 to house the museum and opened as Ralph Mark Gilbert Civil Rights Museum in 1996.

In the oil and gas industry, '''reservoir modeling''' involves the construction of a [[computer model]] of a [[petroleum reservoir]], for the purposes of improving estimation of [[oil reserves|reserves]] and making decisions regarding the development of the field, predicting future production, placing additional wells, and evaluating alternative reservoir management scenarios. 

A reservoir model represents the physical space of the reservoir by an array of discrete cells, delineated by a grid which may be regular or irregular.  The array of cells is usually three-dimensional, although 1D and 2D models are sometimes used.  Values for attributes such as [[porosity]], [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] and [[water saturation]] are associated with each cell.  The value of each attribute is implicitly deemed to apply uniformly throughout the volume of the reservoir represented by the cell.

==Types of reservoir model==

Reservoir models typically fall into two categories:
* [[Geologic modelling|Geological models]] are created by [[geologist]]s and [[geophysicist]]s and aim to provide a static description of the reservoir, prior to production.
* [[Reservoir simulation]] models are created by [[reservoir engineering|reservoir engineers]] and use [[finite difference methods]] to simulate the flow of fluids within the reservoir, over its production lifetime.

Sometimes a single "shared earth model" is used for both purposes.  More commonly, a geological model is constructed at a relatively high (fine) resolution.  A coarser grid for the reservoir simulation model is constructed, with perhaps two orders of magnitude fewer cells.  Effective values of attributes for the simulation model are then derived from the geological model by an upscaling process. Alternatively, if no geological model exists, the attribute values for a simulation model may be determined by a process of sampling geological maps.

Uncertainty in the true values of the reservoir properties is sometimes investigated by constructing several different [[Realization (probability)|realizations]] of the sets of attribute values.  The behaviour of the resulting simulation models can then indicate the associated level of economic uncertainty.

The phrase "reservoir characterization" is sometimes used to refer to reservoir modeling activities up to the point when a simulation model is ready to simulate the flow of fluids.

Commercially available software is used in the construction, simulation and analysis of the reservoir models.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Tyson. ''An Introduction to Reservoir Modeling'' (2007), {{ISBN|978-1-906928-07-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seismic to simulation==
The processes required to construct reservoir models are described by the phrase ''Seismic to simulation''. The process is successful if the model accurately reflects the original [[well logging|well logs]], seismic data and production history.

Reservoir models are constructed to gain a better understanding of the subsurface that leads to informed well placement, reserves estimation and [[production planning]]. Models are based on measurements taken in the field, including well logs, [[Reflection seismology|seismic surveys]], and production history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RETINA Homepage|url=http://www.estdco.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Seismic to simulation enables the quantitative integration of all field data into an updateable reservoir model built by a team of geologists, geophysicists, and engineers. Key techniques used in the process include integrated [[Reservoir petrophysics|petrophysics]] and rock physics to determine the range of lithotypes and rock properties, [[geostatistics|geostatistical]] inversion to determine a set of plausible seismic-derived rock property models at sufficient vertical resolution and heterogeneity for flow simulation, [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] grid transfer to accurately move seismic-derived data to the geologic model, and flow simulation for model validation and ranking to determine the model that best fits all the data.

===Rock physics and petrophysics===

The first step in seismic to simulation is establishing a relationship between petrophysical key rock properties and [[Elastic modulus|elastic properties]] of the rock. This is required in order to find common ground between the well logs and seismic data.&lt;ref&gt;"Benefits of Integrating Rock Physics with Petrophysics: Five Key Reasons to Employ an Integrated, Iterative Workflow", Fugro-Jason White Paper, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Well logs are measured in depth and provide high resolution vertical data, but no insight into the inter-well space. Seismic are measured in time and provide great lateral detail but is quite limited in its vertical resolution. When correlated, well logs and seismic can be used to create a fine-scale 3D model of the subsurface.

Insight into the rock properties comes from a combination of basic geologic understanding and well-bore measurements. Based on an understanding of how the area was formed over time, geologists can predict the types of rock likely to be present and how rapidly they vary spatially. Well log and [[Core sample|core measurements]] provide samples to verify and fine-tune that understanding. 

Seismic data is used by petrophysicists to identify the tops of various lithotypes and the distribution of rock properties in the inter-well space using seismic inversion attributes such as [[acoustic impedance|impedance]]. Seismic surveys measure acoustic impedance contrasts between rock layers. As different geologic structures are encountered, the sound wave [[Reflection seismology|reflects]] and [[refraction|refracts]] as a function of the impedance contrast between the layers. Acoustic impedance varies by rock type and can therefore be correlated to rock properties using rock physics relationships between the inversion attributes and petrophysical properties such as [[porosity]], [[lithology]], [[Water content|water saturation]], and [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]].

Once well logs are properly conditioned and edited, a petrophysical rock model is generated that can be used to derive the effective elastic rock properties from fluid and mineral parameters as well as rock structure information. The model parameters are calibrated by comparison of the synthetic to the available elastic [[sonic logging|sonic]] logs. Calculations are performed following a number of rock physics [[algorithm]]s including: Xu &amp; White, Greenberg &amp; Castagna, Gassmann, Gardner, modified upper and lower Hashin-Shtrikman, and Batzle &amp; Wang. 

When the petrophysical rock model is complete, a statistical database is created to describe the rock types and their known properties such as porosity and permeability. Lithotypes are described, along with their distinct elastic properties.

===MCMC geostatistical inversion===

In the next step of seismic to simulation, seismic inversion techniques combine well and seismic data to produce multiple equally plausible 3D models of the elastic properties of the reservoir. Seismic data is transformed to elastic property log(s) at every trace. Deterministic inversion techniques are used to provide a good overall view of the porosity over the field, and serve as a quality control check. To obtain greater detail needed for complex geology, additional stochastic inversion is then employed.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, A., "Limitations of Deterministic and Advantages of Stochastic Seismic Inversion", CSEG Records, February 2005, p. 5-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geostatistical inversion procedures detect and delineate thin reservoirs otherwise poorly defined.&lt;ref&gt;Merletti, G., Torres-Verdin, C., "Accurate Detection and Spatial Delineation of Thin-Sand Sedimentary Sequences via Joint Stochastic Inversion of Well Logs and 3D Pre-Stack Seismic Amplitude Data", SPE 102444.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] (MCMC) based geostatistical inversion addresses the vertical scaling problem by creating seismic derived rock properties with vertical sampling compatible to geologic models.

All field data is incorporated into the geostatistical inversion process through the use of [[probability distribution function]]s (PDFs). Each PDF describes a particular input data in geostatistical terms using [[histogram]]s and [[variogram]]s, which identify the odds of a given value at a specific place and the overall expected scale and texture based on geologic insight.

Once constructed, the PDFs are combined using [[Bayesian inference]], resulting in a posterior PDF that conforms to everything that is known about the field.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;"Incorporating Geophysics into Geologic Models: New Approach Makes Geophysical Models Available to Engineers in a Form They Can Use", Fugro-Jason White Paper, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A weighting system is used within the algorithm, making the process more objective.

From the posterior PDF, realizations are generated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. These realizations are statistically fair and produce models of high detail, accuracy and realism. Rock properties like porosity can be cosimulated from the elastic properties determined by the geostatistical inversion. This process is iterated until a best fit model is identified.

Inversion parameters are tuned by running the inversion many times with and without well data. Without the well data, the inversions are running in blind-well mode. These blind-well mode inversions test the reliability of the constrained inversion and remove potential bias. 

This statistical approach creates multiple, equi-probable models consistent with the seismic, wells, and geology. Geostatistical inversion simultaneously inverts for impedance and discrete properties types, and other petrophysical properties such as porosity can then be jointly cosimulated. 

The output volumes are at a sample rate consistent with the reservoir model because making synthetics of finely sampled models is the same as from well logs. Inversion properties are consistent with well log properties because the histograms used to generate the output rock properties from the inversion are based on well log values for those rock properties.

Uncertainty is quantified by using random seeds to generate slightly differing realizations, particularly for areas of interest. This process improves the understanding of uncertainty and risk within the model.

===Stratigraphic grid transfer===

Following geostatistical inversion and in preparation for history matching and flow simulation, the static model is re-gridded and up-scaled. The  transfer simultaneously converts time to depth for the various properties and transfers them in 3D from the [[seismic grid]] to a [[corner-point grid]]. The relative locations of properties are preserved, ensuring data points in the seismic grid arrive in the correct stratigraphic layer in the corner point grid.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The static model built from seismic is typically orthogonal but flow simulators expect corner point grids. The corner point grid consists of cubes that are usually much coarser in the horizontal direction and each corner of the cube is arbitrarily defined to follow the major features in the grid. Converting directly from orthogonal to corner point can cause problems such as creating discontinuity in fluid flow. 

An intermediate stratigraphic grid ensures that important structures are not misrepresented in the transfer. The stratigraphic grid has the same number of cells as the orthogonal seismic grid, but the boundaries are defined by stratigraphic surfaces and the cells follow the stratigraphic organization. This is a stratigraphic representation of the seismic data using the seismic interpretation to define the layers. The stratigraphic grid model is then mapped to the corner point grid by adjusting the zones.

Using the porosity and permeability models and a saturation height function, initial saturation models are built. If volumetric calculations identify problems in the model, changes are made in the petrophysical model without causing the model to stray from the original input data. For example, sealing faults are added for greater compartmentalization.

===Model validation and ranking===

In the last step of seismic to simulation, flow simulation continues the integration process by bringing in the production history. This provides a further validation of the static model against history. A representative set of the model realizations from the geostatistical inversion are history matched against production data. If the properties in the model are realistic, simulated well bottom hole pressure behavior should match historical (measured) well bottom hole pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Castoro A., de Groot L. , Forsyth D., Maguire R., Rijkers R., Webber R., "Accurate Reservoir Modelling Through Optimized Integration of Geostatistical Inversion And Flow Simulation. A North Sea Case Study", Petex, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Production flow rates and other engineering data should also match. 

Based on the quality of the match, some models are eliminated. After the initial history match process, dynamic well parameters are adjusted as needed for each of the remaining models to improve the match. The final model represents the best match to original field measurements and production data and is then used in drilling decisions and production planning.

[[File:Mano cornuta by-RaBoe001.jpg|thumb|upright|A demonstration of the sign of the horns.]]

The '''sign of the horns''' (also known as '''metal horns''', '''devil horns''', '''rock horns''', and other names) is  a gesture often used when listening to heavy metal.

==Spiritual and superstitious meaning==

In [[Hinduism]], the hand gesture is known as the "[[List of mudras (yoga)#Hasta (hand mudras)|Apana yogic mudra]]."&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"&gt;http://indianexpress.com/article/india/rajinikanth-politics-party-symbol-apana-mudra-detoxification-purification-5007863/&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Indian classical dance]] forms, the hand gesture symbolises the [[Asiatic lion#In mythology, religion, culture and art|Lion]].&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"/&gt; In [[Buddhism]], it is seen as an [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] gesture very commonly used by [[Gautama Buddha]] as "Karana Mudra" which is synonymous with [[Exorcism#Buddhism|expulsion of demons]] and removal of obstacles like sickness or negative thoughts.&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"/&gt;

The [[apotropaic]] usage of the sign can also be seen in [[Italy]] and in other [[Mediterranean]] cultures where, when confronted with unfortunate events, or simply when these events are mentioned, the sign of the horns may be given to ward off bad luck. It is also used traditionally to counter or ward off the "[[evil eye]]" (''malocchio'' in Italian). In Italy specifically, the gesture is known as the ''corna''. With fingers pointing down, it is a common Mediterranean apotropaic gesture, by which people seek protection in unlucky situations (it is thus a more Mediterranean equivalent of [[knocking on wood]]). Thus, for example, the [[President of the Italian Republic]], [[Giovanni Leone]], shocked the country when, while in [[Naples]] during an [[outbreak]] of [[cholera]], he shook the hands of [[patient]]s with one hand while with the other behind his back he superstitiously made the ''corna'', presumably to ward off the disease or in reaction to being confronted by such misfortune. This act was well documented by the [[journalist]]s and [[photographer]]s who were right behind him, a fact that had escaped President Leone's mind in that moment.

In Italy and other parts of the [[Mediterranean region]], the gesture must usually be performed with the fingers tilting downward to signify the warding off of bad luck; in the same region and elsewhere, the gesture may take a different, offensive and insulting meaning if it is performed with fingers upward or if directed aggressively towards someone in a swiveling motion (see section below). In Italy, one can also "touch iron" (''tocca ferro'') or touch one's nose to ward off bad luck. Males in Italy may also grab their [[testicle]]s when confronted by bad luck; however, this is considered more vulgar.

In [[Peru]], one says ''contra'' (against). In the [[Dominican Republic]], the expression is ''zafa'', said against curses known as ''fukú''. All of these gestures are meant to conjure supernatural protection.

The sign of the horns is used during religious rituals in Wicca, to invoke or represent the [[Horned God]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner'' by Scott Cunningham, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Offensive gesture==
In many [[Mediterranean basin|Mediterranean]] and Latin countries, such as [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Cuba]], [[France]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Mexico]], [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Uruguay]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/picturegalleries/8788932/Rude-hand-gestures-of-the-world.html?image=5 |title=Rude hand gestures of the world}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theloop.ca/living/funwind/photo-gallery/-/p/6407/-International-field-guide-to-rude-hand-gestures/2442503 |title=International field guide to rude hand gestures |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214213945/http://www.theloop.ca/living/funwind/photo-gallery/-/p/6407/-International-field-guide-to-rude-hand-gestures/2442503 |archivedate=2013-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/hand-gestures-in-different-cultures.html |title=Hand Gestures in Different Cultures}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rHS39OG4GG4C |title=Rude Hand Gestures of the World: A Guide to Offending without Words By Romana Lefevre |isbn=9781452110172 |author1=Lefevre |first1=Romana |date=2011-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when directed towards someone and swiveled back and forth, the sign implies [[cuckold]]ry; the common words for ''cuckolded'' in Italian, Greek and Spanish are {{lang|it|cornuto}}, {{lang|el|κερατάς}} ({{lang|el-Latn|keratas}}) and {{lang|es|cornudo}}, respectively, literally meaning "horned".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reading-body-language.co.uk/gestures2.html |title=Hand Gestures Part Two — The Cuckold Gesture |publisher=Reading-Body-Language.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a [[European Union]] meeting in February 2002, then-current Italian prime minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]] was photographed performing this gesture behind the back of the Spanish foreign minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1874098_1874099_1874139,00.html|title=Top 10 Worst Silvio Berlusconi Gaffes|date=8 December 2012|publisher=|accessdate=21 May 2017|via=content.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Northwestern European and North American popular culture==

===Contemporary use by musicians and fans===

[[Marlon Brando]] makes the sign whilst singing "[[Luck Be a Lady]]" in the film ''[[Guys and Dolls (film)|Guys and Dolls]]'' (1955), seeming to indicate it was a sign for snake eyes in the craps game he is playing for the gamblers' souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marlon Brando-Luck Be a Lady|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-JzdRJCcsg|website=youtube.com|accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the cover of [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Yellow Submarine (album)|Yellow Submarine]]'' album (1969), the cartoon of [[John Lennon]]'s right hand is making the sign above [[Paul McCartney]]'s head. Some fans interpreted this as one of the many supposed "[[Paul is dead]]" clues. Some may think it is possible that the cartoonist misrepresented the [[ILY sign|sign for "I love you"]], which is very similar and more in keeping with the band's public message and image. However, the 1969 cartoon is based on many photos of John Lennon making the hand sign in 1967. One of these photos of Lennon doing the hand sign appears on the cover of a Beatles single release shortly after, making it the first time the hand sign appears on a rock release.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The back cover of the album ''[[Witchcraft Destroys Minds &amp; Reaps Souls]]'' (1969) by Chicago-based psychedelic-occult rock band [[Coven (band)|Coven]] pictured band members giving the "sign of the horns". Starting in early 1968, Coven concerts always began and ended with singer [[Jinx Dawson]] giving the sign on stage.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The sign is also used in various Disney movies. It can be seen in the medieval-style opening sequence of the British-American Disney movie ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'' (1971) as a goat-legged figure with a jester's cap, leading a procession of outlandish-looking figures, flashes the sign.

Beginning in the early 1970s, the horns were known as the "P-Funk sign" to fans of [[Parliament-Funkadelic]]. It was used by [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Bootsy Collins]] as the password to the Mothership,&lt;ref name=appleford&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lacitybeat.com/article.php?id=1216&amp;IssueNum=66 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071122030548/http://www.lacitybeat.com/article.php?id=1216&amp;IssueNum=66 |archivedate=November 22, 2007 |title=Odyssey of the Devil Horns |first=Steve |last=Appleford |publisher=Los Angeles City Beat |date=September 9, 2004 |quote=A friend arranges a meeting with Clinton. I hand him a photograph of Dio making the hand signal, and tell him this is the man (or one of them) credited with bringing it to rock. Clinton stares at the picture for a long, silent minute, breathing heavily. Another minute passes. He's never heard of Ronnie James Dio. It's the P-Funk sign, man.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a central element in Parliament's science-fiction [[P-Funk mythology|mythology]], and fans used it in return to show their enthusiasm for the band. Collins is depicted showing the P-Funk sign on the cover of his 1977 album ''[[Ahh... The Name Is Bootsy, Baby!]]''

In 1977, a painting&lt;!-- animated painting??? --&gt; of [[Gene Simmons]] (of the band [[Kiss (band)|KISS]]) exhibits the sign on the cover of ''[[Love Gun]]'', the band's sixth studio album. Simmons still utilizes the sign, both on and off stage.

[[Frank Zappa]] can be seen jokingly making the gesture in the film ''[[Baby Snakes]]'' (1979) in response to the audience, commenting, "That's right, spindle twice."

For the Indian movie ''[[Rock On 2]]'' (2016), the sign of the horns is used to represent "2".

===Heavy metal culture===
[[File:Dio throwing Horns.jpg|thumb|Vocalist [[Ronnie James Dio]] making the sign at a [[Heaven &amp; Hell (band)|Heaven and Hell]] concert in 2007. The gesture is quite common within [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] culture.]]

[[Ronnie James Dio]] was known for popularizing the sign of the horns in [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]].&lt;ref name="appleford"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/columns/junkyard/the_devils_horns_a_rock_and_roll_symbol.html |title=The Devil's Horns: A Rock And Roll Symbol |publisher=Ultimate-Guitar.com |date=September 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed his Italian grandmother used it to ward off the [[evil eye]] (which is known in Southern Italy as ''[[Evil eye|malocchio]]''). Dio began using the sign soon after joining the metal band [[Black Sabbath]] in 1979. The previous singer in the band, [[Ozzy Osbourne]], was rather well known for using the [[V Sign|"peace"]] sign at concerts, raising the index and middle finger in the form of a V. Dio, in an attempt to connect with the fans, wanted to similarly use a hand gesture. However, not wanting to copy Osbourne, he chose to use the sign his grandmother always made.&lt;ref&gt;Ronnie James Dio interview in the 2005 documentary ''[[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey]]''. In the interview he also ridicules Gene Simmons for taking credit for originating use of the sign in heavy metal, attributing the claim to Simmons' well-known egotism.&lt;/ref&gt; The horns became famous in metal concerts very soon after Black Sabbath's first tour with Dio. The sign would later be appropriated by heavy metal fans under the name "maloik", a corruption of the original ''malocchio''.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

[[Geezer Butler|Terry "Geezer" Butler]] of Black Sabbath can be seen "raising the horns" in a photograph taken in 1971. The photograph is included in the CD booklet of the ''[[Symptom of the Universe: The Original Black Sabbath 1970–1978]]'' compilation album. This would indicate that there had been some association between the "horns" and heavy metal before Dio's popularization of it.

When asked if he was the one who introduced the hand gesture to metal subculture, Dio said in a 2001 interview with Metal-Rules.com:

{{quote|I doubt very much if I would be the first one who ever did that. That's like saying I invented the wheel, I'm sure someone did that at some other point. I think you'd have to say that I made it fashionable. I used it so much and all the time and it had become my trademark until the [[Britney Spears]] audience decided to do it as well. So it kind of lost its meaning with that. But it was.... I was in Sabbath at the time. It was a symbol that I thought was reflective of what that band was supposed to be all about. It's NOT the devil's sign like we're here with the devil. It's an Italian thing I got from my Grandmother called the "Malocchio". It's to ward off the Evil Eye or to give the Evil Eye, depending on which way you do it. It's just a symbol but it had magical incantations and attitudes to it and I felt it worked very well with Sabbath. So I became very noted for it and then everybody else started to pick up on it and away it went. But I would never say I take credit for being the first to do it. I say because I did it so much that it became the symbol of rock and roll of some kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metal-rules.com/zine/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=666 |title=Dio - Interviewed By EvilG |publisher=Metal-Rules.com |date=March 9, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Gene Simmons]] of the rock group [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] attempted to claim the similar-looking but unrelated variation, the [[ILY sign]] (thumb extended rather than thumb toward the palm) hand gesture for his own.  According to CBS News, "Simmons filed an application on Friday, June 16, 2017 with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for a trademark on the hand gesture he regularly uses during concerts and public appearances - thumb, index and pinky fingers extended, with the middle and ring fingers folded down. According to Simmons, this hand gesture was first used in commerce — by him — on Nov. 14, 1974. He is claiming the hand gesture should be trademarked for "entertainment, namely live performances by a musical artist [and] personal appearances by a musical artist." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/gene-simmons-trademark-devil-horns-hand-gesture/|title=Gene Simmons wants to trademark "devil horns" hand gesture|publisher=CBS News|date=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Simmons abandoned this application on June 21, 2017 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/legalentertainment/2017/06/21/breaking-gene-simmons-abandons-hand-gesture-trademark-application/#77f2bc74faac|title=Gene Simmons Abandons Hand Gesture Trademark Application |publisher=Forbes |date=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neopaganism===
In [[Wicca]], the sign of the horns is used to represent the Horned God.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In text-based electronic communication, the sign of the horns is represented with the &lt;code&gt;\../&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;\m/&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code&gt;lml&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;|m|&lt;/code&gt; emoticon and sometimes with &lt;code&gt;/../&lt;/code&gt;.

===Sports culture===
[[File:hookemhorns.jpg|thumbnail|A fan displays the Hook 'em Horns during a Texas football game versus Arkansas.]]

[[Hook 'em Horns]] is the slogan and hand signal of the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. Students and alumni of the university employ a greeting consisting of the phrase "Hook 'em" or "Hook 'em Horns" and also use the phrase as a parting good-bye or as the closing line in a letter or story.  The [[gesture]] is meant to approximate the shape of the head and horns of the [[University of Texas at Austin|UT]] mascot, the [[Texas longhorn (cattle)|Texas Longhorn]] [[Bevo (mascot)|Bevo]].

Fans of the [[University of South Florida]] Bulls use the same hand sign at their athletic events, except that the hand is turned around and facing the other way.  With the middle and ring finger extending towards the person presenting the "Go Bulls" sign.

Fans of [[North Dakota State University]] Bison athletics also use a similar hand gesture, known as "Go Bison!"  The pinky and index fingers are usually slightly bent, however, to mimic the shape of a [[bison]]'s horns.

Fans of [[North Carolina State University]] Wolfpack athletics use a similar gesture with the middle and ring fingers moving up and down over the thumb to mimic a wolf's jaw.

Fans of  [[University of California, Irvine]] Anteaters use a similar sign with the middle and ring fingers out to resemble the head of the mighty anteater.

Fans of [[University of Nevada, Reno]] [[Nevada Wolf Pack|Wolf Pack]] athletics use a similar sign with the middle and ring fingers out to resemble the wolf's snout.

Fans of [[University of Utah]] athletics, particularly football and gymnastics, use a gesture where the index and pinky finger are straight and parallel to each other, forming a block "U."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alumni.utah.edu/muss/membership/ |title=MUSS - Student Cheer Section for the U of U Utes - University of Utah Alumni Association &amp;#124; MUSS |publisher=Alumni.utah.edu |date=2011-03-18 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fans of [[Northwestern State University]] Demon athletics also use a similar hand gesture, known as "Fork 'em!"  The pinky and index fingers are extended but a little more parallel to each other resembling the horns on a demon.

[[Arizona State University]] [[Arizona State Sun Devils|Sun Devils]] fans make a pitchfork sign by extending the index and middle fingers, as well as the pinky. The thumb holds down the ring finger to complete the gesture. The same gesture is used by fans of the [[Wichita State University|Wichita State]] [[Wichita State Shockers|Shockers]], which in this context represents a stylized "W".

Fans of the [[Grand Canyon University]] Antelopes use this hand gesture with a slight variation by touching the tips of the ring and middle finger with the thumb to form the shape of an antelope and its horns. Often followed by the phrase "Lopes up".

Fans of the [[Universidad de Chile]] soccer team use this gesture to represent their support for the team by forming a U-shaped hand gesture, often followed by the phrase "Grande la U".

Retired professional wrestler [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] often used the Corna gesture during the later phase of his career, wherein he would raise both his hands in the very same gesture, which would result in his [[Pyrotechnics|pyro]] going off.

* In 1972, George Duncan and Roger Jones were thrown into a river by a group of men believed to be police officers, [[Murder of George Duncan|resulting in Duncan's death]]. Jones refused to identify their attackers out of fear for his life. A group of officers were charged but acquitted, and the case is said to be the subject of a government cover-up.

* [[Suicide of Tyrone Unsworth|A gay teenager Tyrone Unsworth killed himself]] after prolonged homophobic bullying at his school, which culminated with his being hospitalized after his jaw was struck with a fence used as a weapon by another boy.
*Roffee and Waling (2016) conducted a study that aimed to investigate incidents of bullying, harassment and violence committed towards LGBTIQ people. They discovered an issue, however, when they found that many people did not view what they had been subjected to as a hate crime, or even a crime at all. Furthermore, many of the participants commented on feeling that they did not meet the criteria of being a victim of harassment, bullying or violence. This established that prospective participants may not have felt that they met the criteria and thus would not have elected to take part in the study. The conclusion of the study established that all of the participants had been subjected to some form of victimisation, with some of the attacks being extremely violent and criminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306325028_Resolving_ethical_challenges_when_researching_with_minority_and_vulnerable_populations_LGBTIQ_victims_of_violence_harassment_and_bullying|title=James Roffee &amp; Andrea Waling Resolving ethical challenges when researching with minority and vulnerable populations: LGBTIQ victims of violence, harassment and bullying}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=James Roffee &amp; Andrea Waling Rethinking microaggressions and anti-social behaviour against LGBTIQ+ Youth | doi=10.1108/SC-02-2016-0004 | volume=15 | journal=Safer Communities | pages=190–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
*[[Kenneth Zeller]], a gay man in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] who was employed as a schoolteacher, was murdered by five young offenders in [[High Park]] in 1985. The incident spurred the [[Toronto District School Board]] to implement a program to combat anti-gay discrimination and violence — culminating in the creation of the [[Triangle Program]], Canada's first [[alternative school]] program for at-risk LGBT youth, in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Alanna Mitchell, "Welcome to Canada's gay high school: Toronto's Triangle program offers an educational refuge". ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', May 29, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
*On March 19, 1989, Joe Rose, a young gay activist in [[Montreal]], was [[stabbing|stabbed]] to death by a gang of teenagers who targeted him for having pink hair. The incident later inspired educator Michael Whatling, who had been a classmate of Rose's at the time of his death, to publish ''[[A Vigil for Joe Rose]]'', an exploration of the struggles faced by LGBT students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pre2010.thelinknewspaper.ca/articles/1887 "High school homos"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725222205/http://pre2010.thelinknewspaper.ca/articles/1887 |date=2012-07-25 }}.

*On August 21, 1989, Alain Brosseau, a straight man in [[Ottawa]], was attacked by a gang of teenagers who wrongly assumed him to be gay, while walking home from his job at the [[Château Laurier]].&lt;ref name=brosseau&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/story/2009/08/21/ottawa-alain-brosseau-ceremony.html "Gay-targeted murder recalled 20 years later"]. [[CBC News]], August 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The attackers chased him through [[Major's Hill Park]] to the [[Alexandra Bridge]], and then threw him off the bridge resulting in his death.&lt;ref name="brosseau"/&gt; This resulted in a gay and lesbian community outcry and eventually led to the formation of the [[Ottawa Police Service]]'s GLBT Liaison Committee two years later.&lt;ref name=brosseau /&gt;

==Portugal==
* ''Gisberta Salce Júnior'', more commonly known in [[Portugal]] as the Gisberta case, was a homeless [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] transsexual immigrant, who was [[HIV positive]], had drug problems, and was a sex-worker. She was found dead on 22 February 2006 inside a pit 10 metres deep, in an unfinished building in [[Porto]], the second biggest Portuguese city. The crime was confessed to by a group of 14 boys, between the ages of 10 and 16 years old, most of whom came from a child protection institution belonging to the Catholic Church, although financed by the state. From this confession, details of the dreadful act became known. The victim had a deeply fragile health condition, and these boys frequently harassed, insulted, and chased her. On the 19th, a group of these boys entered the unfinished and abandoned building where Gisberta was staying, tied her up, gagged and assaulted her with extreme violence, kicking her and beating her up with sticks and stones. The group also confessed to having introduced sticks into Gisberta's anus, whose body presented great injuries, and to having abandoned her at the scene. Her body also had cigarette-burn marks. On the 20th and 21st, they returned to the scene and repeated the aggressions. By dawn, from the 21st to 22nd, they finally threw her into the pit, attempting to hide the crime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tgeu.org/gisberta-campaign-2006/ Gisberta Campaign (2006), Transgender Europe, 26.05.2017]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileCategory=6&amp;FileID=823|title=Transexual Murdered in Portugal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030055245/http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileCategory=6&amp;FileID=823|archivedate=2009-10-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[C++]] [[type conversion]], the '''static_cast''' [[Operators in C and C++|operator]] performs an explicit type conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++|year=2008|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=United States of America|isbn=0321543726|pages=594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syntax==
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
static_cast&lt;type&gt; (object);
&lt;/source&gt;

The ''type'' parameter must be a data type to which ''object'' can be converted via a known method, whether it be a builtin or a cast. The type can be a reference or an enumerator.
All types of conversions that are well-defined and allowed by the compiler are performed using static_cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thinking in C++|year=2000|publisher=Alan Apt|location=United States of America|isbn=0-13-979809-9|pages=857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The static_cast operator can be used for operations such as:
* Converting a pointer of a base class to a pointer of a nonvirtual derived class,
* Converting numeric data types such as [[Enumerated type|enums]] to [[Integer (computer science)|ints]] or ints to [[Floating point|floats]].

Although static_cast conversions are checked at compile time to prevent obvious incompatibilities, no [[Type system#Dynamic typing|run-time type check]] is performed that would prevent a cast between incompatible data types, such as pointers.  Also, the result of a static_cast from a pointer of a virtual base class to a pointer of a derived class is undefined.

==See also==
* [[dynamic cast]]
* [[reinterpret_cast]]
* [[const_cast]]
* [[duration_cast]]

'''Stefan Gandler''' (born 1964 in [[Munich]]) is a [[philosopher]] and [[Social science|social scientist]]. He studied at [[Goethe University of Frankfurt|Frankfurt University]] and has lived in [[Mexico]] since 1993&lt;ref&gt;[http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no00018261.html Library of Congress Name Authority File].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brill.com/products/book/critical-marxism-mexico Koninklijke Brill NV: ''Biographical note'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Gandler studied [[Philosophy]], [[Latin American studies]], [[Romance studies|Romance Languages and Literatures]] and [[Political science]] in Frankfurt/Main, among others with [[Alfred Schmidt (philosopher)|Alfred Schmidt]], and he was the Chairman of the Frankfurt [[AStA|General Students' Committee (AStA)]] in 1989/90.&lt;ref&gt;[http://de.scribd.com/doc/239505483/Winkel ''Abschied vom Intellektuellen''] (Detlef zum Winkel in ''konkret'', 2/1990, S. 59–61.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Brill Academic Press, Leiden 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 1997 Gandler was tenured as professor for Social theory and Social Philosophy at the [[Autonomous University of Queretaro|Universidad Autónoma de Querétaro (UAQ)]] and has this position until today, and since 2008 he is additionally permanent invited professor for philosophy at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]].&lt;ref&gt;Gandler is PhD adviser in the UNAM doctorate program in philosophy in three areas: [http://www.posgrado.unam.mx/filosofia/docs/tut_politica.html Political philosophy], [http://www.posgrado.unam.mx/filosofia/docs/tut_cultura.html Philosophy of culture] and [http://www.posgrado.unam.mx/filosofia/docs/tut_estetica.html Aesthetics].&lt;/ref&gt; Gandler is also, since 2001, member of the [[Sistema Nacional de Investigadores]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conacyt.gob.mx/index.php/el-conacyt/sistema-nacional-de-investigadores Sistema Nacional de Investigadores homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; (category 3)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conacyt.gob.mx/images/SNI/BENEFICIARIOS_2017.xlsx Sistema Nacional de Investigadores: Padrón de Benificiarios], [http://www.conacyt.gob.mx/images/SNI/2016/Ingreso_o_Permanencia_SNI_2016.pdf Sistema Nacional de Investigadores: Resultados de la Convocatoria 2016, Ingreso o Permanencia]&lt;/ref&gt; and founded in 2012 the Research Project on Critical Theory from the Americas&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conacyt.gob.mx/FondosyApoyos/Sectoriales/InvestigacionBasicaAplicada/SEP/Basica/Documents/Resultados_Convocatoria_CB-2011_publicacion.pdf CONACYT, ''Resultados de la convocatoria'']&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (Mexico)|National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT)]].

The main research fields of Stefan Gandler are the [[Critical theory]] of the [[Frankfurt School]], the critical [[Western Marxism|''western'' Marxism]], philosophy in Latin America, [[Critique of ideology]] and [[Walter Benjamin]].&lt;ref&gt;"With sixteen
books and over 150 articles published on critical theory, German philosophy, and Marxism in the Americas, Stefan Gandler is certainly worthy of study by anyone interested in this complex philosophical tradition, especially as it has been encountered and furthered by philosophers south of the U.S.–Mexican border." (Carlos Alberto Sánchez: [http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.apaonline.org/resource/collection/60044C96-F3E0-4049-BC5A-271C673FA1E5/HispanicV14n1.pdf ''From the editor.''] In: ''APA Newsletter on Hispanic/Latino Issues in Philosophy'', American Philosophical Association, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, vol. 14, no. 1, fall 2014, p. 1. {{ISSN|2155-9708}}.)

A '''tamga''' or '''tamgha''' "stamp, seal" ({{lang-mn|тамга}}, {{lang-otk|𐱃𐰢𐰍}} ''tamga''; {{lang-tr|damga}}; [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish:]] طمغا ) is an abstract [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] or [[Seal (emblem)|stamp]] used by [[Eurasian nomad]]ic peoples and by cultures influenced by them. The tamga was normally the emblem of a particular tribe, clan or family.
They were common among the Eurasian nomads throughout Classical Antiquity and the Middle Ages (including [[Alans]], [[Mongols]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Turkic peoples]]).

Similar "tamga-like" symbols were sometimes adopted by sedentary peoples adjacent to the Pontic-Caspian steppe both in [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Ottfried Neubecker. ''Heraldik''. Orbis, 2002; Brook 154; Franklin and Shepard 120-121; Pritsak 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt;  Archaeologists prize tamgas as a first-rate source for the study of present and extinct cultures.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Medieval tamgas==
===Mongol empire===
[[File:Member of Mongolian Association of Numismatics.png|thumb|Logo with the [[Xiongnu]] tamga; these five symbols were later used as the tamgas of [[Genghis Khan]] and his sons.]]
[[File:Kaidu's tamga.png|thumb|Tamgha of [[Kaidu]], [[House of Ögedei]].]]

Since the time when the ancients, including the [[Mongol]] nations have developed into relative groups, origins, and ethnic groups, the symbol and belief of a clan have emerged, and a custom to distinguish their origins and relatives have been established. Consequently, when labor distributions within clans began to develop and people started to manage an economy, various tamgas, drawings, notes and earmarks have been used as an identification sign for labor instruments and utilities as well as in domestication of animals. Every time the clan branched off due to internal clashes, the number of derivative tamghas gradually developed into personal, family, lineage, khans, and state tamghas. Those new tamghas were created through adding new markings on the original tamgha, in order to conserve the tradition. In the Mongol Empire a Tamgha was a seal placed on taxed items, and by extension, a tax on commerce.(and see Eastern Europe below) &lt;ref&gt;Christian, History of Russia, Central Asia and Mongolia, page 415&lt;/ref&gt;

"Tamga" or "tamag" literally means a stamp or seal in the [[Mongolian language]]. Tamgas are also [[Livestock branding|stamped using hot irons]] on domesticated animals such as horses in present-day [[Mongolia]] and others to identify that the livestock belongs to a certain family while they graze during the day on their own. In this regard, each family has their own tamga markings for easier identification. Tamga marking in that case is not very elaborate and is just a curved iron differentiating from other families' tamgas. The [[President of Mongolia]] also passes the ''tamag'' "state seal" when he or she transitions the position to the new president. In the presidential case, the tamag or seal is a little more elaborate and is contained in a wooden box.

===Turkic peoples===
[[Image:Flag of the Crimean Tatar people.svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Crimean Tatars]], sporting the traditional tamğa.]]

The Turks who remained pastoral nomad kings in eastern Anatolia and Iran however, continued to use their clan tamgas, and in fact they became high-strung nationalistic imagery.  The [[Ak Koyunlu]] and [[Kara Koyunlu]], like many other royal dynasties in Eurasia, put their tamga on their flags and stamped their coinage with it.

For those Turks who never left their homeland of [[Turkestan]] in the first place it remained and still is what it was originally,  a cattle brand and clan identifier.

Among modern [[Turkic peoples]], the tamga is a design identifying [[property]] or [[cattle]] belonging to a specific Turkic clan, usually as a [[livestock branding|cattle brand]] or [[seal (emblem)|stamp]].

When Turkish clans took over more [[Urban area|urban]] or [[rural area]]s, tamgas dropped out of use as [[pastoral]] ways of life became forgotten.  This is most evident in the Turkish clans who took over western and eastern [[Anatolia]] following the [[Battle of Manzikert]]. The Turks who took over western Anatolia founded the [[Sultanate of Rûm]] and became Roman-style aristocrats. Most of them adopted the (at the time) Muslim symbol of the [[Seal of Solomon]] after the Sultanate disintegrated into a mass of feuding [[ghazi (warrior)|ghazi]] states (see [[Isfendiyarids]], [[Karamanids]]). Only the Ottoman ghazi state (later to become the [[Ottoman Empire]]) kept its [[Ottoman flag|tamga]], and this was highly stylized, so much so that the bow was stylized down eventually to a crescent moon.

In Russia, the term ''tamga'' (''тамга'') survived in state institution of border customs, with associated cluster of terms: ''tamozhnya'' (''таможня'', customs), ''tamozhennik'' (''таможенник'', customs officer), ''rastamozhit''' (''растаможить'', pay customs duties), derived from the use of tamga as a certificate of state.

[[Columns of Gediminas]], an early coat of arms of Lithuania, may be a tamga.

==Islamic empires==
[[File:Taj Mahal top of finial.jpg|thumb|Tamga of the [[Mughal Empire]] on top of the [[Taj Mahal]].]]

In the late medieval  [[Turco-Mongol]] states, the term ''tamga'' was used for any kind of official stamp or seal. This usage persisted in the early modern Islamic Empires ([[Ottoman Empire]], [[Mughal Empire]]), and in some of their modern successor states.

In the [[Urdu]] language (which absorbed Turkic vocabulary), ''Tamgha'' is used as [[medal]]. [[Tamgha-i-Jurat]] is the fourth highest Military medal of [[Pakistan]]. It is admissible to all ranks for gallantry and distinguished services in combat. [[Tamgha-i-Imtiaz]] or Tamgha-e-Imtiaz ({{lang-ur|تمغہ امتیاز}}), which translates as "medal of excellence", is fourth highest honour given by the Government of Pakistan to both the military and civilians. [[Tamgha-i-Khidmat]] or Tamgha-e-Khidmat ({{lang-ur|تمغۂ خدمت}}), which translates as "medal of services", is seventh highest honour given by the Government of Pakistan to both the military and civilians. It is admissible to non-commissioned officers and other ranks for long meritorious or distinguished services of a non-operational nature.
 
In [[Egypt]], the term ''damgha'' ({{lang-ar|دمغة}}) or ''tamgha'' ({{lang|ar|تمغة}}) is still used in two contexts. One is a tax or fee when dealing with the government. It is normally in the form of stamps that have to be purchased and affixed to government forms, such as a driver license or a registration deed for a contract. The term is derived from the Ottoman [[damga resmi]]. Another is a stamp put on every piece of jewelry made from gold or silver to indicate it is genuine, and not made of baser metals.

A '''tolerance interval''' is a [[statistical interval]] within which, with some confidence level, a specified proportion of a sampled population falls. "More specifically, a 100×p%/100×(1−α) tolerance interval provides limits within which at least a certain proportion (p) of the population falls with a given level of confidence (1−α)."&lt;ref&gt;D. S. Young (2010), Book Reviews: "Statistical Tolerance Regions: Theory, Applications, and Computation", TECHNOMETRICS, FEBRUARY 2010, VOL. 52, NO. 1, pp.143-144.&lt;/ref&gt; "A (p, 1−α) tolerance interval (TI) based on a sample is constructed so that it would include at least a proportion p of the sampled population with confidence 1−α; such a TI is usually referred to as p-content − (1−α) coverage TI."&lt;ref name=Krishnamoorthy2011&gt;Krishnamoorthy, K. and Lian, Xiaodong(2011) 'Closed-form approximate tolerance intervals for some general linear models and comparison studies', Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation,, First published on: 13 June 2011 {{DOI|10.1080/00949655.2010.545061}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A (p, 1−α) upper '''tolerance limit''' (TL) is simply an 1−α upper [[confidence limit]] for the 100 p [[percentile]] of the population."&lt;ref name=Krishnamoorthy2011/&gt;

A tolerance interval can be seen as a statistical version of a [[probability interval]]. "In the parameters-known case, a 95% tolerance interval and a 95% [[prediction interval]] are the same."&lt;ref name="Ryan2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas P. Ryan|title=Modern Engineering Statistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZn7XNphKcgC&amp;pg=PA222|accessdate=22 February 2013|date=22 June 2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-12843-5|pages=222–}}&lt;/ref&gt; If we knew a population's exact parameters, we would be able to compute a range within which a certain proportion of the population falls. For example, if we know a population is [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] with [[mean]] &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and [[standard deviation]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, then the interval &lt;math&gt;\mu \pm 1.96\sigma&lt;/math&gt; includes 95% of the population (1.96 is the [[z-score]] for 95% coverage of a normally distributed population).

However, if we have only a sample from the population, we know only the [[sample mean]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; and sample standard deviation &lt;math&gt;\hat{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;, which are only estimates of the true parameters. In that case, &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mu} \pm 1.96\hat{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; will not necessarily include 95% of the population, due to variance in these estimates. A tolerance interval bounds this variance by introducing a confidence level &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, which is the confidence with which this interval actually includes the specified proportion of the population. For a normally distributed population, a z-score can be transformed into a "''k'' factor" or '''tolerance factor'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Statistical interpretation of data — Part 6: Determination of statistical tolerance intervals |publisher= ISO 16269-6|year= 2005 |page= 64}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a given &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; via lookup tables or several approximation formulas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Tolerance intervals for a normal distribution | url = http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/prc/section2/prc263.htm | title = Engineering Statistics Handbook | publisher = NIST/Sematech | year = 2010 | accessdate = 2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; "As the degrees of freedom approach infinity, the prediction and tolerance intervals become equal."&lt;ref name=Example2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = De Gryze | first1 = S. | last2 = Langhans | first2 = I. | last3 = Vandebroek | first3 = M. | doi = 10.1016/j.chemolab.2007.03.002 | title = Using the correct intervals for prediction: A tutorial on tolerance intervals for ordinary least-squares regression | journal = Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems | volume = 87 | issue = 2 | pages = 147 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to other intervals==
{{Main|Interval estimation}}
The tolerance interval is less widely known than the [[confidence interval]] and [[prediction interval]], a situation some educators have lamented, as it can lead to misuse of the other intervals where a tolerance interval is more appropriate.&lt;ref name=vardeman&gt;{{cite journal | author = Stephen B. Vardeman | title = What about the Other Intervals? | journal = The American Statistician | volume = 46 | issue = 3 | year = 1992 | pages = 193–197 | jstor = 2685212 | doi=10.2307/2685212}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nelson&gt;{{cite web | author = Mark J. Nelson | title = You might want a tolerance interval | url = http://www.kmjn.org/notes/tolerance_intervals.html | date = 2011-08-14 | accessdate = 2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tolerance interval differs from a [[confidence interval]] in that the confidence interval bounds a single-valued population parameter (the [[mean]] or the [[variance]], for example) with some confidence, while the tolerance interval bounds the range of data values that includes a specific proportion of the population. Whereas a confidence interval's size is entirely due to [[sampling error]], and will approach a zero-width interval at the true population parameter as sample size increases, a tolerance interval's size is due partly to sampling error and partly to actual variance in the population, and will approach the population's probability interval as sample size increases.&lt;ref name=vardeman /&gt;&lt;ref name=nelson /&gt;

The tolerance interval is related to a [[prediction interval]] in that both put bounds on variation in future samples. The prediction interval only bounds a single future sample, however, whereas a tolerance interval bounds the entire population (equivalently, an arbitrary sequence of future samples). In other words, a prediction interval covers a specified proportion of a population ''on average'', whereas a tolerance interval covers it ''with a certain confidence level'', making the tolerance interval more appropriate if a single interval is intended to bound multiple future samples.&lt;ref name=nelson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Krishnamoorthy&gt;{{cite book | author = K. Krishnamoorthy| title = Statistical Tolerance Regions: Theory, Applications, and Computation | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | year = 2009 | isbn = 0-470-38026-8 | pages = 1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===

&lt;ref name=vardeman/&gt; gives the following example: &lt;blockquote&gt;So consider once again a proverbial [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] [[Fuel economy in automobiles|mileage]] test scenario, in which several nominally identical autos of a particular model are tested to produce mileage figures &lt;math&gt;y_1, y_2, ..., y_n&lt;/math&gt;. If such data are processed to produce a 95% confidence interval for the mean mileage of the model, it is, for example, possible to use it to project the mean or total gasoline consumption for the manufactured fleet of such autos over their first 5,000 miles of use. Such an interval, would however, not be of much help to a person renting one of these cars and wondering whether the (full) 10-gallon tank of gas will suffice to carry him the 350 miles to his destination. For that job, a prediction interval would be much more useful. (Consider the differing implications of being "95% sure" that &lt;math&gt;\mu \ge 35&lt;/math&gt; as opposed to being "95% sure" that &lt;math&gt;y_{n+1} \ge 35&lt;/math&gt;.) But neither a confidence interval for &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; nor a prediction interval for a single additional mileage is exactly what is needed by a design engineer charged with determining how large a gas tank the model really needs to guarantee that 99% of the autos produced will have a 400-mile cruising range. What the engineer really needs is a tolerance interval for a fraction &lt;math&gt;p = .99&lt;/math&gt; of mileages of such autos.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another example is given by:&lt;ref name=Krishnamoorthy/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;The air lead levels were collected from &lt;math&gt;n=15&lt;/math&gt; different areas within the facility. It was noted that the log-transformed lead levels fitted a normal distribution well (that is, the data are from a [[lognormal distribution]]. Let &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, denote the population mean and variance for the log-transformed data. If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; denotes the corresponding random variable, we thus have &lt;math&gt;X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)&lt;/math&gt;. We note that exp(mu) is the median air lead level. A confidence interval for mu can be constructed the usual way, based on the [[Student's t-distribution|''t''-distribution]]; this in turn will provide a confidence interval for the median air lead level. If &lt;math&gt;\bar{X}&lt;/math&gt; and S denote the sample mean and standard deviation of the log-transformed data for a sample of size n, a 95% confidence interval for mu is given by &lt;math&gt;\bar{X} \pm t_{n-1,0.975} S / \sqrt(n)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;t_{m,1-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the 1-alpha quantile of a [[Student's t-distribution|''t''-distribution]] with m degrees of freedom. It may also be of interest to derive a 95% upper confidence bound for the median air lead level. Such a bound for mu is given by &lt;math&gt;\bar{X} + t_{n-1,0.95} S / \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently, a 95% upper confidence bound for the median air lead is given by &lt;math&gt;\exp{\left( \bar{X} + t_{n-1,0.95} S / \sqrt{n} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;. Now suppose we want to predict the air lead level at a particular area within the laboratory. A 95% upper prediction limit for the log-transformed lead level is given by &lt;math&gt;\bar{X} + t_{n-1,0.95} S \sqrt{\left( 1 + 1/n \right)}&lt;/math&gt;. A two-sided prediction interval can be similarly computed. The meaning and interpretation of these intervals are well known. For example, if the confidence interval &lt;math&gt;\bar{X} \pm t_{n-1,0.975} S / \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt; is computed repeatedly from independent samples, 95% of the intervals so computed will include the true value of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, in the long run. In other words, the interval is meant to provide information concerning the parameter &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; only. A prediction interval has a similar interpretation, and is meant to provide information concerning a single lead level only. Now suppose we want to use the sample to conclude whether or not at least 95% of the population lead levels are below a threshold. The confidence interval and prediction interval cannot answer this question, since the confidence interval is only for the median lead level, and the prediction interval is only for a single lead level. What is required is a tolerance interval; more specifically, an upper tolerance limit. The upper tolerance limit is to be computed subject to the condition that at least 95% of the population lead levels is below the limit, with a certain confidence level, say 99%.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Calculation==
One-sided normal tolerance intervals have an exact solution in terms of the sample mean and sample variance based on the [[Noncentral t-distribution|noncentral ''t''-distribution]].&lt;ref name=Young/&gt; 
Two-sided normal tolerance intervals can be obtained based on the [[noncentral chi-squared distribution]].&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{cite journal| author=Derek S.

'''Vibhu''' ([[Sanskrit]]:विभु) means – 'mighty', 'powerful', 'eminent', 'supreme', 'able to', 'capable of', 'self-subdued', 'firm' or 'self-controlled'; in [[Nyaya]] philosophy, it means – 'eternal', 'existing everywhere', 'all-pervading', 'pervading all material things'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=V.S.Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|page=1455|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?p.5:125.apte}}&lt;/ref&gt; This word also refers to ''[[Manas (early Buddhism)|manas]]'' or mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Origin and Development of Yoga from Vedic times|author=Suresh chander Banerjee|publisher=Punthi Pustak|page=469|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=fKfWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=vibhu+vedas&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rtGsVKiVCojmuQT9t4CwDA&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; This word has its root in the term, '''bhū''' ( भू), meaning – 'become', 'arise', 'come into existence'; thus ''vibhu'' means – 'expand', 'become manifest', 'appear', 'pervade'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Artful Universe|author=William K.

==Vedic significance==

From [[Atharvaveda]] it is learnt that Sudhanvan Angirasa had three sons, Ribhu, Vibhu and Vaja, collectively known as [[Ribhus]] who were intelligent sages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic Mythology|author=Nagendra Kumar Singh|publisher=APH Publications|page=196|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=jXw7-PdwZ7oC&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Js6sVI-PMJCGuATRmoCADg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; They carried the luminous power of knowledge to this world, which knowledge pervaded the world as nectar. Ribhu or Ribhukshan was skillful at handling knowledge; Vibhu or Vibhawa was skillful in pervading and diffusing, and Vaja handled embodied plenitude with similar skill; all three dwelled in the solar-region and are considered to be the rays of the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mertowney Mountain Interviews|author=Richard Leviton|publisher=iUniverse|page=383|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=IhhOBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA383&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Js6sVI-PMJCGuATRmoCADg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the three leaders of rites and the possessors of opulence, and the three deities of several Rig Vedic hymns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rig Veda Samhita|publisher=N.Trubner|page=115|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=6tf0xYQRrsgC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vMysVN_LJ8yzuASxk4GoAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mantra of the [[Rig Veda]] reads as follows:-

:एकस्य चिन्मे विभ्वस्त्वोजो या नु दधृष्वान् कृणवै मनीषा |
:अहं ह्युग्रो मरुतो विदानो यानि चयवमिन्द्र इदीश एषाम् || ([[Rig Veda]] I.165.10)

In the Rig Veda, the word, ''vibhu'', means – 'all-pervading unified entity that permeates or extends throughout a spatial expanse', as is in the afore-cited mantra wherein the phrase - एकस्य चिन्मे विभ्वस्त्वोजः which means -  " Though I be but one, let my might be extensive. " &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic Ideals of Sovereignty and the Poetics of Power|author=Theodore Nicholas Proferes|publisher=American Oriental Society|page=27|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=qXzXAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=vibhu+vedas&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XBauVPTRGNiRuASP3YLoCA&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwCDgo }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the words, ''vibhu'' and ''[[prabhu]]'', appear in the [[Rig Veda]] but these words have a fixed psychological significance – ''vibhu'' means - 'coming into existence to pervade the whole being as ''[[Ānanda (Hindu philosophy)|ānanda]]'', and ''prabhu'' means - 'coming into existence as a specific object or particular experience within the range of one’s consciousness'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Secret of the Vedas|author=Sri Aurobindo|publisher=Sri Aurobindo Ashram|page=355|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=fTJb_Y1Tp94C&amp;pg=PA355&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vMysVN_LJ8yzuASxk4GoAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sage of the Rig Veda (II.xxiv.11) asserts that:-

:इमा सातानि वेन्यस्य वाजिनो येन जना उभ्यें भुञ्जते विशः ||

[[Brihaspati]], the lord of the heaven of light and the guardian of ''[[Ṛta|rta]]'', is present in all things and beings (''vibhu'') same as the [[Brahman]] of the [[Vedanta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Religion and Philosophy of the Vedas and Upanishads|author=A.B.Keith|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=448|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=p9zCbRMQbyEC&amp;pg=PA448&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ac-sVL-MMtLbuQTp0ICQAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical significance==

In the [[Kaushitaki Upanishad]], while describing the world of Brahman, there is the mention of the hall of Brahman called ''Vibhu'' (or built by ''Vibhu'' here meaning – 'egoism') arriving at which hall the glory of Brahman reaches the one who seeks liberation, where the seeker thinks himself to be Brahman, and thinking thus approaches the throne ''Vikakshanā'' ('perception'), in other words, the seeker having become liberated experiences Brahman, his own true nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=sacred Books of the East|publisher=The Floating Press|pages=262, 263|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=hoV-aiNlwbgC&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Js6sVI-PMJCGuATRmoCADg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gaudapada]] in his ''kārikā'' on the [[Mandukya Upanishad]] stating:-

:निवृत्तेः सर्वदुःखानामीशानः प्रभुरव्ययः  |
:अद्वैतः सर्वभावानां देवस्तुर्यो विभु स्मृतः ||

describes the fourth state (''[[turiya]]'') as the ordainer (''iśana''), as the supreme lord (''prabhu''), as the non-dual (''advaita'') and the all-pervading (''vibhu'') god (''devata'') of all beings. Here, the word, ''avyaya'', means that which is not subject to change; and ''turiya'' is ''vibhu'' because it pervades all the three states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism|author=Richard King|publisher=SUNY Press|page=67|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=p1bASTAOhjoC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=vibhu+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8tesVICFHIyRuASEvoK4Cw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedanta&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to all six orthodox [[Vedic]] ''darśanas'' which comprise [[Hindu philosophy]], with the exception of [[Ramanuja]]’s 'theory of atomic dimensionless soul', the ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|ātmān]]'' is ''vibhu'' ('omnipresent'). The followers of [[Jainism]], who believe that the ''ātmān'' assumes the size corresponding to the size of the body it occupies, also believe that in the final state of liberation it remains unalterable, but they reject the Hindu theory of ''vibhu'' which to them does not explain if the soul is same at all times everywhere why for is there the experience individual self. Vedāntists argue that for the atman to be unchangeable in the state of liberation then it must be regarded either as ''anu'' ('minute') or as ''vibhu'' ('pervasive').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions|publisher=University of California Press|page=219|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=4WZTj3M71y0C&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vMysVN_LJ8yzuASxk4GoAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahmasutram|author=Sitanath Tattvabhushan|publisher=Genesis Publishing

[[Advaita Vedanta]] rests on the premise that only the substratum ([[Brahman]]) is real, the phenomenal world all with its properties and relations is unreal and due to ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]''. Substance, in its pure subtle state is the constitutive cause of things, and in its rational state it is the substratum of qualities, actions, etc., and exists in nine forms – earth (''prithivi''), water (''jala''), fire (''agni''), air (''vayu''), space (''akasha'') ('which five constitute the physical world'), direction (''disha'') ('without which no movement is not possible'), time (''kaal'') ('the substratum and the causal factor of all psycho-physical product and worldly behaviour'), mind (''manas'') and self (''ātmān''); the first four and mind are ''paramanus'' ('infinitesimal') and the rest are ''vibhu'' ('ubiquitous'), simple and infinite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Oriental Philosophy and Religion|publisher=Global Vision|page=557|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=0TBTVPax4E8C&amp;pg=PA557&amp;dq=vibhu+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_tusVNfMFdijugSUiIH4Dw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vindhyāvāsī, giving up the doctrine of the three psychical organs, associates the processes of the faculty of knowledge (''buddhi'') and I-consciousness with the thinking organ (''manah'') which three were the great all –penetrating ''vibhu''. Vyasa too held mind (''citta'') to be all-penetrating (''vibhu'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=history of Indian Philosophy|author=Erich Frauwallner|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=323|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=CMINXvxHU0sC&amp;pg=PA323&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vMysVN_LJ8yzuASxk4GoAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] explains that " the Self (Brahman), which is by nature all-pervasive (''vibhu'') assumes the form and qualities of the ''buddhi'' when apparently moving in the cycle of empirical existence.

'''Willard Van Orman Quine''' ({{IPAc-en|k|w|aɪ|n}}; known to intimates as "Van";&lt;ref name=mactutor&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Quine|date=October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; June 25, 1908 – December 25, 2000) was an [[American philosopher]]  and [[logician]] in the [[analytic philosophy|analytic tradition]], recognized as "one of the most influential philosophers of the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/29/arts/29QUIN.html "W. V. Quine, Philosopher Who Analyzed Language and Reality, Dies at 92"]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1930 until his death 70 years later, Quine was continually affiliated with [[Harvard University]] in one way or another, first as a student, then as a professor of philosophy and a teacher of logic and [[set theory]], and finally as a professor emeritus who published or revised several books in retirement. He filled the Edgar Pierce Chair of Philosophy at Harvard from 1956 to 1978. A 2009 poll conducted among analytic philosophers named Quine as the fifth most important philosopher of the past two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2009/03/so-who-is-the-most-important-philosopher-of-the-past-200-years.html "So who *is* the most important philosopher of the past 200 years?"] Leiter Reports.

Quine falls squarely into the analytic philosophy tradition while also being the main proponent of the view that philosophy is not [[conceptual analysis]] but the abstract branch of the empirical sciences.  His major writings include "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]" (1951), which attacked the distinction between [[analytic proposition|analytic]] and [[synthetic proposition|synthetic]] [[proposition]]s and advocated a form of [[semantic holism]], and ''[[Word and Object]]'' (1960), which further developed these positions and introduced Quine's famous [[indeterminacy of translation]] thesis, advocating a [[behaviorist]] [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|theory of meaning]]. He also developed an influential [[naturalized epistemology]] that tried to provide "an improved scientific explanation of how we have developed elaborate scientific theories on the basis of meager sensory input."&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/quine-sc/ "Quine's Philosophy of Science"]. Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Iep.utm.edu. July 27, 2009. Accessed March 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also important in [[philosophy of science]] for his "systematic attempt to understand science from within the resources of science itself"&lt;ref name="iep" /&gt; and for his conception of philosophy as continuous with science. This led to his famous quip that "philosophy of science is philosophy enough."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2251091?cookieSet=1 "Mr Strawson on Logical Theory"]. WV Quine. ''Mind'' Vol. 62 No. 248. Oct. 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[philosophy of mathematics]], he and his Harvard colleague [[Hilary Putnam]] developed the "[[Philosophy of mathematics#Indispensability argument for realism|Quine–Putnam indispensability thesis]]," an argument for the [[Philosophy of mathematics#Empiricism|reality of mathematical entities]].&lt;ref&gt;Colyvan, Mark, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2004/entries/mathphil-indis/ "Indispensability Arguments in the Philosophy of Mathematics"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2004 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
According to his autobiography, ''The Time of My Life'' (1986), Quine grew up in [[Akron, Ohio]], where he lived with his parents and older brother Robert Cloyd. His father, Cloyd Robert,&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Companion to Quine, ed. Roger F. Gibson, Jr, Cambridge University Press, 2004, pg 1&lt;/ref&gt; was a manufacturing entrepreneur (founder of the Akron Equipment Company, which produced tire molds)&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Companion to Quine, ed. Roger F. Gibson, Jr, Cambridge University Press, 2004, pg 1&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother, Harriett E., was a schoolteacher and later a housewife.&lt;ref name=mactutor /&gt; He received his B.A. in mathematics from [[Oberlin College]] in 1930, and his Ph.D. in philosophy from [[Harvard University]] in 1932. His thesis supervisor was [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. He was then appointed a [[Harvard Junior Fellow]], which excused him from having to teach for four years. During the academic year 1932–33, he travelled in Europe thanks to a Sheldon fellowship, meeting Polish logicians (including [[Stanislaw Lesniewski]] and [[Alfred Tarski]]) and members of the [[Vienna Circle]] (including [[Rudolf Carnap]]), as well as the [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] [[A. J. Ayer]].&lt;ref name=mactutor /&gt;

It was Quine who arranged for Tarski to be invited to the September 1939 [[Unity of Science]] Congress in Cambridge, for which Tarski sailed on the last ship to leave [[Gdańsk|Danzig]] before the [[Third Reich]] invaded Poland. Tarski survived the war and worked another 44 years in the US.

During World War II, Quine lectured on logic in Brazil, in Portuguese, and served in the United States Navy in a [[military intelligence]] role, deciphering messages from German submarines, and reaching the rank of lieutenant commander.&lt;ref name=mactutor /&gt;

At Harvard, Quine helped supervise the Harvard [[graduate theses]] of, among others, [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Gilbert Harman]], [[Dagfinn Føllesdal]], [[Hao Wang (academic)|Hao Wang]], [[Hugues LeBlanc]],  [[Henry Hiz]] and [[George Myro]]. For the academic year 1964–1965, Quine was a fellow on the faculty in the Center for Advanced Studies at [[Wesleyan University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wesleyan.edu/libr/schome/FAs/ce1000-137.html "Guide to the Center for Advanced Studies Records, 1958–1969"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314083709/http://www.wesleyan.edu/libr/schome/FAs/ce1000-137.html |date=March 14, 2017 }}. Weselyan University. Wesleyan.edu. Accessed March 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980
Quine received an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from the Faculty of Humanities at [[Uppsala University]], Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/traditions/prizes/honorary-doctorates/&lt;/ref&gt;

Quine was an atheist when he was a teenager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of W.V. Quine|year=1986|publisher=Open Court|isbn=9780812690101|page=6|last1=Quine |first1=Willard Van Orman |last2=Hahn |first2=Lewis Edwin |quote=In my third year of high school I walked often with my new Jamaican friends, Fred and Harold Cassidy, trying to convert them from their Episcopalian faith to atheism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had four children by two marriages.&lt;ref name=mactutor /&gt; Guitarist [[Robert Quine]] was his nephew.

In the foreword to the new edition of ''Word and Object'', Quine's student Dagfinn Føllesdal noted that Quine began to lose his memory toward the end of his life. The deterioration of his short-term memory was so severe that he struggled to continue following arguments. Quine also had considerable difficulty in his project to make the desired revisions to ''Word and Object.'' Before passing away, Quine noted to Morton White, "I do not remember what my illness is called, Althusser or Alzheimer, but since I cannot remember it, it must be Alzheimer." He passed away from the illness on Christmas Day in 2000.&lt;ref&gt; W.V. Quine. ''Word and Object'' 2013. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political beliefs===
Quine was politically conservative, but the bulk of his writing was in technical areas of philosophy removed from direct political issues.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', [http://www.wvquine.org/wvq-obit3.html obituary] for W V Quine – January 4, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, write in defense of several conservative positions: for example, in ''Quiddities: An Intermittently Philosophical Dictionary'', he wrote a defense of [[moral censorship]];&lt;ref&gt;''Quiddities: An Intermittently Philosophical Dictionary'', entry for Tolerance (pp. 206–8)&lt;/ref&gt; while, in his autobiography, he made some criticisms of American postwar academic culture.&lt;ref&gt;"Paradoxes of Plenty" in ''Theories and Things'', p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Time of My Life: An Autobiography'', pp. 352–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Quine's Ph.D. thesis and early publications were on [[formal logic]] and [[set theory]]. Only after World War II did he, by virtue of seminal papers on [[ontology]], [[epistemology]] and language, emerge as a major philosopher. By the 1960s, he had worked out his "naturalized epistemology" whose aim was to answer all substantive questions of knowledge and meaning using the methods and tools of the natural sciences. Quine roundly rejected the notion that there should be a "first philosophy", a theoretical standpoint somehow prior to natural science and capable of justifying it. These views are intrinsic to his [[philosophical naturalism|naturalism]].

Quine could lecture in French, Spanish, Portuguese and German, as well as his native English.

Like the logical positivists, Quine evinced little interest in the philosophical canon: only once did he teach a course in the history of philosophy, on Hume.{{Clarify|reason=These words mean nothing to non-experts: 'logical positivist', 'philosophical canon', and 'Hume.'  What is this sentence trying to tell me?|date=October 2014}}

===Rejection of the analytic–synthetic distinction===
{{See also|Two Dogmas of Empiricism#Analyticity and circularity|l1=Two Dogmas of Empiricism}}
In the 1930s and 40s, discussions with [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Nelson Goodman]] and [[Alfred Tarski]], among others, led Quine to doubt the tenability of the distinction between "analytic" statements—those true simply by the meanings of their words, such as "All bachelors are unmarried"—and "synthetic" statements, those true or false by virtue of facts about the world, such as "There is a cat on the mat." This distinction was central to [[logical positivism]]. Although Quine is not normally associated with [[verificationism]], some philosophers believe the tenet is not incompatible with his general philosophy of language, citing his Harvard colleague [[B. F. Skinner]] and his analysis of language in ''[[Verbal Behavior (book)|Verbal Behavior]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Prawitz, Dag. 'Quine and Verificationism.' In ''Inquiry'', Stockholm, 1994, pp 487–494&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other [[Analytic philosophy|Analytic]] philosophers before him, Quine accepted the [[definition]] of "analytic" as "true in virtue of meaning alone". Unlike them, however, he concluded that ultimately the definition was [[circular definition|circular]]. In other words, Quine accepted that analytic statements are those that are true by definition, then argued that the notion of truth by definition was unsatisfactory. 

Quine's chief objection to analyticity is with the notion of [[synonymy]] (sameness of meaning), a sentence being analytic, just in case it substitutes a synonym for one "black" in a proposition like "All black things are black" (or any other [[logical truth]]). The objection to synonymy hinges upon the problem of collateral information. We intuitively feel that there is a distinction between "All unmarried men are bachelors" and "There have been black dogs", but a competent English speaker will assent to both sentences under all conditions since such speakers also have access to ''collateral information'' bearing on the historical existence of black dogs. Quine maintains that there is no distinction between universally known collateral information and conceptual or analytic truths.

Another approach to Quine's objection to analyticity and synonymy emerges from the modal notion of [[logical possibility]]. A traditional [[Wittgenstein]]ian view of meaning held that each meaningful sentence was associated with a region in the space of possible worlds.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Quine finds the notion of such a space problematic, arguing that there is no distinction between those truths which are universally and confidently believed and those which are necessarily true.

===Confirmation holism and ontological relativity===
The central theses underlying the [[indeterminacy of translation]] and other extensions of Quine's work are [[ontological relativity]] and the related [[doctrine]] of [[confirmation holism]]. The premise of confirmation [[holism]] is that all theories (and the propositions derived from them) are under-determined by empirical data (data, sensory-data, evidence); although some theories are not justifiable, failing to fit with the data or being unworkably complex, there are many equally justifiable alternatives. While the Greeks' assumption that (unobservable) Homeric gods exist is false, and our supposition of (unobservable) electromagnetic waves is true, both are to be justified solely by their ability to explain our observations.

Quine concluded his "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]" as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As an empiricist I continue to think of the conceptual scheme of science as a tool, ultimately, for predicting future experience in the light of past experience. Physical objects are conceptually imported into the situation as convenient intermediaries not by definition in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of [[Homer]] . . . For my part I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not in Homer's gods; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise. But in point of epistemological footing, the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind. Both sorts of entities enter our conceptions only as cultural posits.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quine's ontological [[relativism]] (evident in the passage above) led him to agree with [[Pierre Duhem]] that for any collection of [[empirical evidence]], there would always be many theories able to account for it. However, Duhem's [[holism]] is much more restricted and limited than Quine's. For Duhem, underdetermination applies only to [[physics]] or possibly to [[natural science]], while for Quine it applies to all of human knowledge. Thus, while it is possible to verify or [[falsifiability|falsify]] whole theories, it is not possible to verify or falsify individual statements. Almost any particular statement can be saved, given sufficiently radical modifications of the containing theory. For Quine, scientific thought forms a [[Coherentism|coherent]] web in which any part could be altered in the light of empirical evidence, and in which no empirical evidence could force the revision of a given part.

===Existence and its contrary===
The [[Problem of empty names|problem of non-referring names]] is an old puzzle in philosophy, which Quine captured when he wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;A curious thing about the ontological problem is its simplicity.  It can be put into three Anglo-Saxon monosyllables: 'What is there?'  It can be answered, moreover, in a word—'Everything'—and everyone will accept this answer as true.&lt;ref&gt;W. V. O. Quine, "[[On What There Is]]", ''The Review of Metaphysics'' '''2'''(5), 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

More directly, the controversy goes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;How can we talk about [[Pegasus]]?  To what does the word 'Pegasus' refer?  If our answer is, 'Something,' then we seem to believe in mystical entities; if our answer is, 'nothing', then we seem to talk about nothing and what sense can be made of this?  Certainly when we said that Pegasus was a mythological winged horse we make sense, and moreover we speak the truth!  If we speak the truth, this must be truth ''about something''.  So we cannot be speaking of nothing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quine resists the temptation to say that non-referring terms are meaningless for reasons made clear above.  Instead he tells us that we must first determine whether our terms refer or not before we know the proper way to understand them.  However, [[Czesław Lejewski]] criticizes this belief for reducing the matter to empirical discovery when it seems we should have a formal distinction between referring and non-referring terms or elements of our domain.  Lejewski writes further,

&lt;blockquote&gt;This state of affairs does not seem to be very satisfactory.  The idea that some of our rules of inference should depend on empirical information, which may not be forthcoming, is so foreign to the character of logical inquiry that a thorough re-examination of the two inferences [existential generalization and universal instantiation] may prove worth our while.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lejewski then goes on to offer a description of [[free logic]], which he claims accommodates an answer to the problem.

Lejewski also points out that free logic additionally can handle the problem of the empty set for statements like &lt;math&gt;\forall x\,Fx \rightarrow \exists x\,Fx&lt;/math&gt;.  Quine had considered the problem of the empty set unrealistic, which left Lejewski unsatisfied.&lt;ref&gt;Czeslaw Lejewski, "Logic and Existence". ''British Journal for the Philosophy of Science'' Vol. 5 (1954–55), pp. 104–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logic===
Over the course of his career, Quine published numerous technical and expository papers on formal logic, some of which are reprinted in his ''Selected Logic Papers'' and in ''The Ways of Paradox''.

Quine confined logic to classical bivalent [[first-order logic]], hence to truth and falsity under any (nonempty) [[universe of discourse]]. Hence the following were not logic for Quine:
* Higher-order logic and set theory. He referred to [[higher-order logic]] as "set theory in disguise";
* Much of what ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' included in logic was not logic for Quine.
* Formal systems involving [[intension]]al notions, especially [[modal logic|modality]]. Quine was especially hostile to modal logic with [[Quantification (logic)|quantification]], a battle he largely lost when [[Saul Kripke]]'s [[Kripke semantics|relational semantics]] became canonical for [[modal logic]]s.

Quine wrote three undergraduate texts on formal logic:
* ''Elementary Logic''. While teaching an introductory course in 1940, Quine discovered that extant texts for philosophy students did not do justice to [[quantification theory]] or [[first-order predicate logic]]. Quine wrote this book in 6 weeks as an ''[[ad hoc]]'' solution to his teaching needs.
* ''Methods of Logic''. The four editions of this book resulted from a more advanced undergraduate course in logic Quine taught from the end of World War II until his 1978 retirement.
* ''Philosophy of Logic''. A concise and witty undergraduate treatment of a number of Quinian themes, such as the prevalence of use-mention confusions, the dubiousness of [[modal logic|quantified modal logic]], and the non-logical character of higher-order logic.

''Mathematical Logic'' is based on Quine's graduate teaching during the 1930s and '40s. It shows that much of what ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' took more than 1000 pages to say can be said in 250 pages. The proofs are concise, even cryptic. The last chapter, on [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] and [[Tarski's indefinability theorem]], along with the article Quine (1946), became a launching point for [[Raymond Smullyan]]'s later lucid exposition of these and related results.

Quine's work in logic gradually became dated in some respects. Techniques he did not teach and discuss include [[analytic tableau]]x, [[recursion#Functional recursion|recursive function]]s, and [[model theory]]. His treatment of [[metalogic]] left something to be desired. For example, ''Mathematical Logic'' does not include any proofs of [[soundness]] and [[completeness (logic)|completeness]]. Early in his career, the notation of his writings on logic was often idiosyncratic. His later writings nearly always employed the now-dated notation of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''. Set against all this are the simplicity of his preferred method (as exposited in his ''Methods of Logic'') for determining the satisfiability of quantified formulas, the richness of his philosophical and linguistic insights, and the fine prose in which he expressed them.

Most of Quine's original work in formal logic from 1960 onwards was on variants of his [[predicate functor logic]], one of several ways that have been proposed for doing logic without [[Quantification (logic)|quantifier]]s. For a comprehensive treatment of predicate functor logic and its history, see Quine (1976). For an introduction, see chpt. 45 of his ''Methods of Logic''.

Quine was very warm to the possibility that formal logic would eventually be applied outside of philosophy and mathematics. He wrote several papers on the sort of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] employed in [[electrical engineering]], and with [[Edward J. McCluskey]], devised the [[Quine–McCluskey algorithm]] of reducing [[Boolean equation]]s to a minimum covering sum of [[prime implicant]]s.

===Set theory===
While his contributions to logic include elegant expositions and a number of technical results, it is in [[set theory]] that Quine was most innovative. He always maintained that mathematics required set theory and that set theory was quite distinct from logic. He flirted with [[Nelson Goodman]]'s [[nominalism]] for a while, but backed away when he failed to find a nominalist grounding of mathematics.

Over the course of his career, Quine proposed three variants of axiomatic set theory, each including the [[axiom of extensionality]]:
* [[New Foundations]], NF, creates and manipulates sets using a single axiom schema for set admissibility, namely an axiom schema of stratified comprehension, whereby all individuals satisfying a stratified formula compose a set. A stratified formula is one that [[type theory]] would allow, were the [[ontology]] to include types. However, Quine's set theory does not feature types. The metamathematics of NF are curious. NF allows many "large" sets the now-canonical [[ZFC]] set theory does not allow, even sets for which the [[axiom of choice]] does not hold. Since the axiom of choice holds for all finite sets, the failure of this axiom in NF proves that NF includes infinite sets. The consistency of NF relative to other formal systems adequate for mathematics is an open question, albeit that a number of candidate proofs are current in the NF community suggesting that NF is equiconsistent with [[Zermelo set theory]] without Choice. A modification of NF, [[New Foundations|NFU]], due to R. B. Jensen and admitting [[urelement]]s (entities that can be members of sets but that lack elements), turns out to be consistent relative to [[Peano arithmetic]], thus vindicating the intuition behind NF. NF and NFU are the only Quinean set theories with a following. For a derivation of foundational mathematics in NF, see Rosser (1952);
* The set theory of ''Mathematical Logic'' is NF augmented by the [[proper class]]es of [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]], except axiomatized in a much simpler way;
* The set theory of ''Set Theory and Its Logic'' does away with stratification and is almost entirely derived from a single axiom schema. Quine derived the foundations of mathematics once again. This book includes the definitive exposition of Quine's theory of virtual sets and relations, and surveyed axiomatic set theory as it stood circa 1960. 

All three set theories admit a universal class, but since they are free of any [[hierarchy]] of [[Type (metaphysics)|types]], they have no need for a distinct universal class at each type level.

Quine's set theory and its background logic were driven by a desire to minimize posits; each innovation is pushed as far as it can be pushed before further innovations are introduced. For Quine, there is but one connective, the [[Sheffer stroke]], and one quantifier, the [[universal quantifier]]. All polyadic [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] can be reduced to one dyadic predicate, interpretable as set membership. His rules of proof were limited to [[modus ponens]] and substitution. He preferred [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] to either [[disjunction]] or the [[Material conditional|conditional]], because conjunction has the least semantic ambiguity. He was delighted to discover early in his career that all of first order logic and set theory could be grounded in a mere two primitive notions: [[set abstraction|abstraction]] and [[inclusion (set theory)|inclusion]]. For an elegant introduction to the parsimony of Quine's approach to logic, see his "New Foundations for Mathematical Logic," ch. 5 in his ''From a Logical Point of View''.

===Epistemology===
Just as he challenged the dominant analytic–synthetic distinction, Quine also took aim at traditional [[normative]] [[epistemology]].  According to Quine, traditional epistemology tried to justify the sciences, but this effort (as exemplified by [[Rudolf Carnap]]) failed, and so we should replace traditional epistemology with an empirical study of what sensory inputs produce what theoretical outputs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-naturalized/#2|title=Naturalized Epistemology|work=stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Epistemology, or something like it, simply falls into place as a chapter of psychology and hence of natural science. It studies a natural phenomenon, viz., a physical human subject. This human subject is accorded a certain experimentally controlled input — certain patterns of irradiation in assorted frequencies, for instance — and in the fullness of time the subject delivers as output a description of the three-dimensional external world and its history. The relation between the meager input and the torrential output is a relation that we are prompted to study for somewhat the same reasons that always prompted epistemology: namely, in order to see how evidence relates to theory, and in what ways one's theory of nature transcends any available evidence...But a conspicuous difference between old epistemology and the epistemological enterprise in this new psychological setting is that we can now make free use of empirical psychology." (Quine, 1969: 82–3)

Quine's proposal is controversial among contemporary philosophers and has several critics, with [[Jaegwon Kim]] the most prominent among them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-naturalized/ "Naturalized Epistemology"].

==In popular culture==
* A [[computer program]] whose output is its own source code is called a "[[Quine (computing)|quine]]" after Quine. This usage was introduced by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] in his 1979 book, ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]''.
* Quine is a recurring character in the webcomic "[[Existential Comics]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://existentialcomics.com/comic/36]. Existential Comics. Accessed November 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

* Quine was selected for inclusion in the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]'s "Pantheon of Skeptics," which celebrates contributors to the cause of [[scientific skepticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pantheon of Skeptics|url=http://www.csicop.org/about/the_pantheon_of_skeptics|website=CSI|publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]|accessdate=April 30, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131054129/http://www.csicop.org/about/the_pantheon_of_skeptics|archivedate=January 31, 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2796">The '''World Friendship Crusade''' is an international civil organization that campaigns in favor of [[friendship]] as a way of fostering a [[Peace|culture of peace]]. Founded by Dr. Ramón Artemio Bracho in [[Puerto Pinasco (Paraguay)|Puerto Pinasco, Paraguay]] in 1958,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cplavila.blogspot.com/2008/03/resea-histrica-de-la-cruzada-mundial-de.html History of the World Friendship Crusade]&lt;/ref&gt; the World Friendship Crusade celebrates [[Friendship Day]] every July 30.

== World Friendship Crusade in Origin and Mission ==
On July 20, 1958, while out to dinner with friends in the town of Puerto Pinasco, Paraguay, Dr. Ramón Artemio Bracho proposed the idea of a '''World Friendship Day''' to his colleagues. On that night, the World Crusade of Friendship was founded, as an activist organization that would promote the idea of celebrating worldwide friendship on July 30. The organization lobbied the [[United Nations]] for many years,  until finally, on July 27, 2011, the General Assembly of the United Nations assigned this date to celebrate the International [[Friendship Day]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/65/L.72 UN Res.A/65/L.72]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Friendship Day Traditions ==
[[Friendship Day|"Día de la Amistad"]] is celebrated every July 30 in Paraguay, where it is a popular festivity in which it is custom among Paraguayans to salute and wish each other's happiness throughout the day, while also exchanging presents.

Another classic activity during this celebration, particularly among young students, but also among other general groups (coworkers, companies, civil organizations, etc.), is the game of the "invisible friend",&lt;ref&gt;[http://discoveringparaguay.com/home/friendship-day-dia-del-amigo/ Discovering Paraguay: Friendship Day Traditions]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoluque.com.py/noticias/49.htm Local report about Paraguayan customs on Friendship Day]&lt;/ref&gt; which is a variation of the popular [[Secret Santa]]. One week before the celebration, participants are invited to write their names on a piece of paper and then, after scrambling all these pieces in a basket or container, retrieve one of the names, without revealing it to the others. Participants then become the "invisible friend" of the person on that piece of paper, and during the week before the celebration, they are invited to write anonymous small notes or letters to the person whose name they selected. On the day of the celebration, invisible friends bring presents to their friends, and one after the other, reveal their identities before giving their presents.
