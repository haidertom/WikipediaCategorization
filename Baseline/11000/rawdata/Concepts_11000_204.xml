'''Proposition 58''' is a [[California ballot proposition]] that passed on the November 8, 2016 ballot. Proposition 58 repealed bilingual education restrictions enacted by [[California Proposition 227 (1998)|Proposition 227]] in 1998.

Proposition 58 passed by a wide margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ulloa |first=Jazmine |title=California will bring back bilingual education as Proposition 58 cruises to victory |work=Los Angeles Times |date=November 8, 2016 |url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-election-day-2016-proposition-58-bilingual-1478220414-htmlstory.html |access-date=November 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It preserves the requirement that public schools ensure students obtain an English language proficiency, require school districts to solicit parent/community input in developing language acquisition programs, require instruction to ensure English acquisition as rapidly and effectively as possible, and authorize school districts to establish dual–language immersion programs for both native and non–native English speakers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposition 58. California General Election November 8, 2016. Official Voter Information Guide.|url=http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/en/propositions/58/|website=California Secretary of State|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the passage of Proposition 227 in 1998, students were required to be taught in an English-only environment, where the student was taught English by a teacher who only speaks English. Proposition 227 also required limited English proficient students who were in separate classes to be put into regular classes, ended bilingual programs, and required students to be taught in an English-only environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_227,_the_%22English_in_Public_Schools%22_Initiative_(1998)|title=California Proposition 227, the "English in Public Schools" Initiative (1998)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under Proposition 58, the public school systems will have the right to choose the way they see as appropriate for their students to learn English more swiftly. Students will now have the option to be taught in an English-only environment, or a bilingual environment, where a person of the student's native language teaches them English. This also allows English speaking students to learn in another language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A California Department of Education spokesperson anticipated a shortage of bilingual teachers under Proposition 58. The number of bilingual credentials had fallen after Proposition 227's passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Renee |first=Alexa |title=Prop 58: Higher demand for bilingual teachers not helping teacher shortage |work=ABC 10 |location=Sacramento |date=November 9, 2016 |url=http://www.abc10.com/news/local/california/prop-58-higher-demand-for-bilingual-teachers-not-helping-teacher-shortage/350584412 |access-date=November 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ad extirpanda''''' (named for its [[Latin]] [[incipit]]) was a [[papal bull]] promulgated on Wednesday, May 15, 1252 by [[Pope Innocent IV]] which authorized in limited and defined circumstances the use of [[torture]] by the [[Inquisition]] for eliciting confessions from [[heretics]].&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, J (2006). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0028-4289.2006.00142.x Aquinas on Torture] ''New Blackfriars'', 87:229.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The bull was issued in the wake of the murder of the papal inquisitor of Lombardy, [[St. Peter of Verona]], who was killed by a conspiracy of [[Catharism|Cathar]] sympathizers on 6 April 1252. The bull argued that as heretics are "murderers of souls as well as robbers of God’s [[sacraments]] and of the Christian faith ...", they are "to be coerced—as are thieves and bandits—into confessing their errors and accusing others, although one must stop short of danger to life or limb." &lt;ref&gt;''Ad extirpanda'', quoted at [http://www.rtforum.org/lt/lt119.html ''The Roman Theological Forum'']&lt;/ref&gt;  The following parameters were placed on the use of torture:&lt;ref name="catholic"&gt;{{cite CE1913|wstitle=Inquisition}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*that it did not cause loss of life or limb (''citra membri diminutionem et mortis periculum'') 
*that it was used only once
*that the Inquisitor deemed the evidence against the accused to be virtually certain.

The bull conceded to the State a portion of the property to be confiscated from convicted heretics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/php/disp.php3?a=schaff&amp;b=encyc06&amp;p=2 ''New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia'':] II. "The Inquisition in the Middle Ages".  Concise historical context of ''Ad extirpanda''&lt;/ref&gt; The State in return assumed the burden of carrying out the penalty. The relevant portion of the bull read: "When those adjudged guilty of heresy have been given up to the civil power by the bishop or his representative, or the Inquisition, the [[podestà]] or chief magistrate of the city shall take them at once, and shall, within five days at the most, execute the laws made against them."&lt;ref&gt;Kline, Austin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1692">Generically, an '''alternative set theory''' is an alternative mathematical approach to the concept of '''[[Set (mathematics)|set]]'''. It is a proposed alternative to the [[axiomatic set theory|standard set theory]]. 

Some of the alternative set theories are:

*the theory of [[semiset]]s
*the set theory [[New Foundations]]
*[[Positive set theory]]
*[[Internal set theory]]

Specifically, '''Alternative Set Theory''' (or '''AST''') refers to a particular set theory developed in the 1970s and 1980s by [[Petr Vopěnka]] and his students. It builds on some ideas of the theory of [[semiset]]s, but also introduces more radical changes: for example, all sets are "formally" [[finite set|finite]], which means that sets in AST satisfy the law of [[mathematical induction]] for set-[[Formula (mathematical logic)|formulas]] (more precisely: the part of AST that consists of [[axioms]] related to sets only is equivalent to the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|Zermelo–Fraenkel]] (or ZF) set theory, in which the [[axiom of infinity]] is replaced by its negation). However, some of these sets contain subclasses that are not sets, which makes them different from [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]] (ZF) finite sets and they are called infinite in AST.

In [[semi-Riemannian geometry]], the '''Bel decomposition''', taken with respect to a specific [[timelike congruence]], is a way of breaking up the [[Riemann tensor]] of a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] into lower order tensors with properties similar to the [[electric field]] and [[magnetic field]].  Such a decomposition was partially described by Alphonse Matte in 1953&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=A.|last1=Matte|title=Sur de nouvelles solutions oscillatoires des equations de la gravitation|journal=Can. J. Math.|volume=5|page=1|year=1953|doi=10.4153/CJM-1953-001-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Lluis Bel]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=L.|last1=Bel|title=Définition d'une densité d'énergie et d'un état de radiation totale généralisée|journal=Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des séances de l'Académie des sciences|volume=246|page=3015|year=1958|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k723q/f965.image.langEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This decomposition is particularly important in [[general relativity]]. This is the case of four-dimensional [[Lorentzian manifold]]s, for which there are only three pieces with simple properties and individual physical interpretations.

== Decomposition of the Riemann tensor ==
In four dimensions the Bel decomposition of the Riemann tensor, with respect to a timelike unit vector field &lt;math&gt;\vec{X}&lt;/math&gt;, not necessarily geodesic or hypersurface orthogonal, consists of three pieces:
# the ''[[electrogravitic tensor]]'' &lt;math&gt;E[\vec{X}]_{ab} = R_{ambn} \, X^m \, X^n&lt;/math&gt;
# the ''[[magnetogravitic tensor]]'' &lt;math&gt;B[\vec{X}]_{ab} = {{}^\star R}_{ambn} \, X^m \, X^n&lt;/math&gt;
# the ''[[topogravitic tensor]]'' &lt;math&gt;L[\vec{X}]_{ab} = {{}^\star R^\star}_{ambn} \, X^m \, X^n&lt;/math&gt;

Because these are all ''transverse'' (i.e. projected to the spatial hyperplane elements orthogonal to our timelike unit vector field), they can be represented as linear operators on three-dimensional vectors, or as three-by-three real matrices.  They are respectively symmetric, [[traceless]], and symmetric (6,8,6 linearly independent components, for a total of 20).  If we write these operators as '''E''', '''B''', '''L''' respectively, the principal invariants of the Riemann tensor are obtained as follows:
* &lt;math&gt;K_1/4&lt;/math&gt; is the trace of '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; +  '''L'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 2 '''B''' '''B'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;-K_2/8&lt;/math&gt; is the trace of '''B''' ( '''E''' - '''L''' ),
* &lt;math&gt;K_3/8&lt;/math&gt; is the trace of '''E''' '''L''' - '''B'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10980">[[File:Trounce Pond.jpg|thumb|right|A [[retention pond]] for treatment of [[urban runoff]] (stormwater).]]
'''Best management practices''' ('''BMPs''') is a term used in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] to describe a type of [[water pollution]] control.  Historically the term has referred to auxiliary pollution controls in the fields of [[industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]] control and [[sewage treatment| municipal sewage]] control, while in [[stormwater]] management (both urban and rural) and [[wetland]] management, BMPs may refer to a principal control or treatment technique as well.

==Terminology==
Beginning in the 20th century, designers of industrial and municipal sewage pollution controls typically utilized [[sewage treatment|engineered systems]] (e.g. [[Trickling filter|filters]], [[clarifier]]s, [[Bioreactor|biological reactors]]) to provide the central components of pollution control systems, and used the term "BMPs" to describe the supporting functions for these systems, such as operator training and equipment maintenance.

'''Stormwater management,''' as a specialized area within the field of [[environmental engineering]], emerged later in the 20th century, and some practitioners have used the term '''BMP''' to describe both structural or engineered control devices and systems (e.g. [[retention basin|retention ponds]]) to treat polluted stormwater, as well as operational or procedural practices (e.g. minimizing use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides). Other practitioners prefer to use the term '''Stormwater control measure''', due to the varied definitions of the term "BMP" and its use in non-stormwater practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=National Research Council, Committee on Reducing Stormwater Discharge Contributions to Water Pollution |chapter-url=http://www.nap.edu/read/12465/chapter/7 |title=Urban Stormwater Management in the United States |chapter=5. Stormwater Management Approaches |date=2009 |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-0-309-12540-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== U.S. Clean Water Act References to "BMP" ==
[[United States Congress|Congress]] referred to '''BMP'''  in several sections of the U.S. [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) but did not define the term.
*The 1977 CWA used the term in describing the areawide waste treatment planning program&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Water Act of 1977, Pub.L. 95-217, December 27, 1977. Sections 208 (b), (i) and (j), {{USC|33|1288}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in procedures for controlling [[toxic]] [[water pollution|pollutants]] associated with industrial discharges.&lt;ref&gt;CWA sec. 304(e), {{USC|33|1314(e)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Clean Water Act#Dredge and fill permits (wetlands)|"Section 404" program]], which covers dredge and fill permits, refers to BMPs in one of the enforcement exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;CWA sec. 404(f), {{USC|33|1344}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*References to stormwater BMPs first appear in the 1987 amendment to the CWA in describing the Nonpoint Source Management Demonstration Program.&lt;ref&gt;Water Quality Act of 1987, Pub.L. 100-4, February 4, 1987. CWA sec. 319(a),(b),(h),(l), &amp; (m), {{USC|33|1329}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Another stormwater BMP reference was added in 2001 with the authorization for a Wet Weather Watershed Pilot Project program.&lt;ref&gt;Wet Weather Water Quality Act of 2000, December 21, 2000. Added by the Miscellaneous Appropriations Act, 2001 (114 Stat. 2763A–225), as enacted into law by section 1(a)(6) of Pub.L. 106–554 (114 Stat. 2763). Amended CWA sec.121(a)(2), {{USC|33|1274}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== EPA definitions ==
In implementing the CWA, the U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) defined '''BMP''' in the federal wastewater permit regulations, initially to refer to auxiliary procedures for industrial wastewater controls.  
:...schedules of activities, prohibitions of practices, maintenance procedures, and other management practices to prevent or reduce the pollution of waters of the United States, BMPs also include treatment requirements, operating procedures, and practices to control plant site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or waste disposal, or drainage from raw material storage.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, D.C. "EPA Administered Permit Programs: The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{CodeFedReg|40|122|2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later the Agency added a reference to stormwater management BMPs.
:...each NPDES permit shall include conditions meeting the following requirements when applicable... (k) Best management practices (BMPs)  to control or abate the discharge of pollutants when: ... (2) Authorized under section 402(p) of the CWA for the control of storm water discharges...&lt;ref&gt;EPA. {{CodeFedReg|40|122|44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industrial wastewater BMPs ==
Industrial wastewater BMPs are considered an adjunct to engineered [[sewage treatment|treatment]] systems. Typical BMPs include operator training, maintenance practices, and spill control procedures for treatment chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite report |date=July 1994 |title=Best Management Practices and Spill Response: Guidance Document |url=https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/f7457ac3-7967-49c9-94dd-7986cb6624da/resource/6b40c069-d846-4fa2-a98b-bfd060a7ab3a/download/best-management-practices-spill-response-guidance-document.pdf |publisher=Alberta Environmental Protection |location=Edmonton, AB}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many BMPs available which are specific to particular industrial processes, for example:
* source reduction practices in metal finishing industries (e.g. substituting less toxic [[solvent]]s or using water-based cleaners);
* in the [[chemical industry]], capturing equipment washdown waters for recycle/reuse at various process stages;
* in the [[paper industry]], using [[process control]] monitoring to optimize [[bleaching]] processes, and reduce the overall amount of bleach used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=October 1993 |title=Guidance Manual for Developing Best Management Practices (BMP) |chapter=Ch. 3. Industry-Specific Best Management Practices |url=https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/owm0274.pdf |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-833-B-93-004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stormwater management BMPs ==
[[Stormwater]] management BMPs are control measures taken to mitigate changes to both quantity and quality of [[urban runoff]] caused through changes to [[land use]]. Generally BMPs focus on [[water quality]] problems caused by increased [[impervious surface]]s from [[land development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=National Research Council, Committee on Reducing Stormwater Discharge Contributions to Water Pollution |chapter-url=https://www.nap.edu/read/12465/chapter/5 |title=Urban Stormwater Management in the United States |chapter=3.

Stormwater BMPs can be classified as "structural" (i.e., devices installed or constructed on a site) or "non-structural" (procedures, such as modified landscaping practices or street sweeping). There are a variety of BMPs available; selection typically depends on site characteristics and pollutant removal objectives. EPA has published a series of stormwater BMP fact sheets for use by local governments, builders and property owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/national-menu-best-management-practices-bmps-stormwater |title=National Menu of Best Management Practices (BMPs) for Stormwater |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stormwater management BMPs can be also categorized into four basic types:
# Storage practices: ponds; recovery; [[Green infrastructure|green infrastructure design]]. 
# Vegetative practices: [[Buffer zone|buffers]]; channels; [[green roof]]s; wetlands; functional art;{{explain|date=November 2018}} stormwater wetland park design; wetland park engineering &amp; design. 
# Filtration/Infiltration practices: filtering; [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]]; [[Rain garden|rain gardens]]; [[Permeable paving|porous pavement]]; civic infrastructure and design; functional stormwater design.
# Water sensitive development: better site design;{{explain|date=November 2018}} open space site design; [[Low-impact development (U.S. and Canada)|low impact development]].

[[File:Salle des Martyrs MEP.jpg|thumb|''Salle des Martyrs'' at the [[Paris Foreign Missions Society]]. The ladder-like apparatus in the middle is the cangue that was worn by [[Pierre Borie]] in captivity.]]
A '''cangue''' ({{IPAc-en|k|æ|ŋ}}) or '''tcha''' is a device that was used for [[public humiliation]] and [[corporal punishment]] in [[China]]&lt;ref name="Jamyang Norbu"&gt;[[Jamyang Norbu]], [http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=24749 From Darkness to Dawn], site ''[[Phayul.com]]'', May 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Cangue}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some other parts of [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]] until the early years of the twentieth century. It was also occasionally used for or during torture. Because it restricted a person's movements, it was common for people wearing cangues to starve to death as they were unable to feed themselves.

The word "cangue" is [[French language|French]], from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] "canga," which means [[yoke]], the carrying tool has also been used to the same effect, with the hands tied to each arm of the yoke. Frequently translated as '''[[pillory]]''', it was similar to that European punishment except that the board of the cangue was not fixed to a base and had to be carried around by the prisoner.&lt;ref name="Jamyang Norbu" /&gt;

==Forms==
Although there are many different forms, a typical cangue would consist of a large, heavy flat board with a hole in the center large enough for a person's neck.  The board consisted of two pieces.  These pieces were closed around a prisoner's neck, and then fastened shut along the edges by locks or hinges.  The opening in the center was large enough for the prisoner to breathe and eat, but not large enough for a head to slip through.  The prisoner was confined in the cangue for a period of time as a punishment. The size and especially weight were varied as a measure of severity of the punishment. The [[Great Ming Legal Code]] (大明律) published in 1397 specified that a cangue should be made from seasoned wood and weigh 25, 20 or 15 [[Catty|jīn]] (roughly 20–33&amp;nbsp;lb or 9–15&amp;nbsp;kg) depending on the nature of the crime involved. Often the cangue was large enough that the prisoner required assistance to eat or drink, as his hands could not reach his own mouth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6810">'''Carola Stabe''' is a former [[dissident]] and [[civil rights activist]] in East Germany [[GDR]]. She is the founder and leader of the environmental group ARGUS in [[Potsdam, Germany]]. She initiated the GDR- wide opposition network of environmental groups, which later converged in the Grüne Liga.

Stabe was born in 1955 in Templin, Mecklenburg. Her father, Dr. Siegfried Stabe, was detained by the Soviets in 1945. Later, he became a member of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]], a school principal and a representative in the East German People's Chamber. In 1975, during her studies of History and Russian at [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], she was arrested because of a publication about the Soviet [[Gulag]]s. From 1977 on, she worked as a teacher in Potsdam.

In April 1988, she initiated the founding of the group ARGUS (Consortium for Environmental Protection and Urban Design), which she led until December, 1989. In the summer of 1988, she began to build a network of environmental groups. As her base she used the Cultural Association of the GDR, the only place where assembly was legal, under the scrutiny of the [[Stasi]]. In April 1988 she organized the first GDR- wide meeting of environmental groups at the Cultural Association, together with [[Matthias Platzeck]] and other members of the ARGUS group in [[Potsdam]].  In June 1989, she organized, the 1. Potsdamer Pfingsbergfest, a public gathering at which the Stasi counted 3000 visitors from all over the GDR, together with Wieland Eschenburg and Matthias Platzeck. She used administrative loopholes to circumvent a prohibition of the assembly. During the gathering, oppositional groups distributed information leaflets.

A poster by graphic artist Bob Bahra and an information leaflet published by ARGUS helped to stop the demolition of Potsdam’s baroque city center, which had been planned by the leadership of the SED (Socialist Unity Party of Germany). Because of her active role at Pfingstbergfest and other events that were critical of the system,   Stabe was dismissed from the teaching profession in July 1989, for reasons of “counterrevolutionary activities”.

On October 7, 1989 she organized, together with Matthias Platzeck, the second GDR-wide meeting. 124 representatives of environmental groups followed an ARGUS invitation to Potsdam’s Cultural Association. The GDR leadership could not forbid the meeting.   Stabe had announced it as a festivity for the 40th anniversary of the GDR. On the evening of October 7, representatives of the environmental groups signed a declaration, expressing the need for political changes and human rights in the GDR. The declaration was sent to the press in East- and West Berlin. During the meeting on October 7, a small group of dissidents around   Stabe and   Platzeck planted the idea for an environmental organization that would exist independently from the Cultural Association. In October 1989, the founding appeal for a “Green League” (Grüne Liga) was drafted. On November 15, 1989, Carola Stabe, Matthias Platzeck and members of the ARGUS group organized the 1. Potsdamer Umweltnacht an event at Potsdam’s Karl Liebknecht Stadium. Here, they made their call for he founding of the Grüne Liga public, in front of 3,000 people.  From the middle of October 1989 on, Staube took part in talks towards the creation of a [[Green politics|Green Party]] of the GDR.

Following the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] on November 9, 1989, she became a founding member of the GDR’s Green Party on November 24, 1989. Simultaneously, she worked in the speakers’ council of the Grüne Liga to foster the collaboration between both groups.

On December 5, 1989, she took part in the occupation of the Stasi headquarters in Potsdam. With a group of fellow dissidents she founded the Rat der Volkskontrolle, which organized the transition to a democratic system in Potsdam. At the Zentraler Runder Tisch (Central Round Table) in Berlin and at the Round Table in Potsdam she represented the Grüne Liga. She partook in the organization of the founding congresses of the Grüne Liga, as well as the Green Party. Her election into the federal board was prevented by the wrongful allegation that she had worked for the Stasi. Henry Schramm, the person who made the allegation, was later exposed as an agent of the Stasi, posing as a dissident in the opposition movement.

From December 7 to April 30, 1990, she headed the office of Grüne Liga in Potsdam and later in Berlin. From May 1990 to July 1992 she was the executive director of Grüne Liga e. V. She supported the creation of environmental centers in the GDR’s 14 district cities and realized projects to build environmental counseling. She helped to prepare the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Brasil for the Federal Republic of Germany. In September 1994 she was politically and professionally rehabilitated and started to work in Brandenburg against right-wing extremism, for democratic participation and for a critical assessment of GDR history. In 2005, with Bob Bahra, she founded the Forum zur kritischen Auseinandersetzung mit der DDR-Geschichte (Forum for the Critical Exploration of GDR History). Since 2006, she works with [[Stefan Roloff]] on the production of films and art projects dealing with the history of the GDR. In 2011 she founded the Gemeinschaft der Verfolgten des DDR-Systems (Association of the Persecuted of the GDR System), together with Bob Bahra, Sibylle Schönemann and Birgit Willschütz.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23668">[[File:Hanzi.svg|thumb|right|Left: "Chinese character" in [[Traditional Chinese]]. Right: "Chinese character" in [[Simplified Chinese]]]]
The '''Chinese family of scripts''' are writing systems descended from the Chinese [[Oracle Bone Script]] and used for a variety of languages in East Asia. They include [[logosyllabic]] systems such as the [[Chinese script]] itself (or ''hanzi'', now in two forms, [[Traditional Chinese|traditional]] and [[Simplified Chinese|simplified]]), and adaptations to other languages, such as [[Kanji]] ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]), [[Hanja]] ([[Korean language|Korean]]), [[Chữ nôm]] ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]) and [[sawndip]] ([[Zhuang languages|Zhuang]]). More divergent are [[Tangut script|Tangut]], [[Khitan large script]], and its offspring [[Jurchen script|Jurchen]], as well as [[Yi script]] and possibly Korean [[Hangul]], which were inspired by Chinese although not directly descended from it. The partially deciphered [[Khitan small script]] may be another. In addition, various phonetic scripts descend from Chinese characters, of which the best known are the various [[kana]] syllabaries, the [[zhuyin]] [[semi-syllabary]], [[nüshu]], and some influence on hangul.{{sfnp|Zhou|1991}}

The Chinese scripts are written in various [[calligraphic hand]]s, principally [[Seal script]], [[Clerical script]], [[Regular script]], [[Semi-cursive script]], and [[Grass script]]. (See [[Chinese calligraphy]] and [[Chinese script styles]].) Adaptations range from the conservative, as in Korean, which used Chinese characters in their standard form with only a few local coinages, and relatively conservative Japanese, which has coined a few hundred new characters and used traditional character forms until the mid-20th century, to the extensive adaptations of Zhuang and Vietnamese, each coining over 10,000 new characters by Chinese formation principles, to the highly divergent [[Tangut script]], which formed over 5,000 new characters by its own principles.

{{main|Chinese character}}

=== Origins ===
[[File:Shang dynasty inscribed scapula.jpg|thumb|right|250px|upright|Ox scapula inscribed with Oracle Bone Script, the ancestor of the Chinese family of scripts]]
[[File:Chinese inscription on a bronze ware.jpg|thumb|An example of [[Chinese bronze inscriptions]], on a bronze vessel dated to the early [[Western Zhou]] period, 11th century BC]]
The earliest Chinese writing consists of divinatory texts inscribed on ox [[scapula]]e and tortoise [[plastron]]s found at the last [[Shang dynasty]] capital near [[Anyang]] and dating from 1200 BC.{{sfnp|Boltz|1994|p=31}}
This [[Oracle Bone Script]] shows extensive simplification and linearization, which most researchers believe indicates an extensive period of development.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=58}}
Although some [[Neolithic signs in China|Neolithic symbols]] have been found on pottery, jade or bone at a variety of sites in China, there is no consensus that any of them are directly related to the Shang oracle bone script.{{sfnp|Boltz|1994|pp=35–39}}
[[Chinese bronze inscriptions|Bronze inscriptions]] from about 1100 BC are written in a developed form of the script and provide a richer body of text.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=61–62}}

Each character of the early script represents a word of [[Old Chinese]], which at that time was uniformly monosyllabic.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=58}}
The strategies used are traditionally classified into six categories (六書 ''liùshū'' "six writings") first recorded in the second century dictionary ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]''.
Three of these categories involved a representation of the meaning of the word:
# Pictograms (象形字 ''xiàngxíngzì'') represent a word by a picture (later stylized) such as {{linktext|日}} ''rì'' "sun", {{linktext|人}} ''rén'' "person" and {{linktext|木}} ''mù'' "tree".
# Ideograms (指事字 ''zhǐshìzì'') are abstract symbols such as {{linktext|三}} ''sān'' "three" and {{linktext|上}} ''shàng'' "up".
# Semantic compounds (會意字 ''huìyìzì'') combine simpler elements to indicate the meaning of the word, as in {{linktext|林}} ''lín'' "grove" (two trees).
Evolved forms of these characters are still in among the most commonly used today.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2000|pp=411–412}}

Words that could not be represented pictorially, such as abstract terms and grammatical particles, were denoted using characters for similar-sounding words (the [[rebus]] strategy).
These phonetic loans (假借字 ''jiǎjièzì'') are thus new uses of existing characters rather than new graphic forms.{{sfnp|Boltz|1994|pp=59–62}}
An example is {{linktext|來}} ''lái'' "come", written with the character for a similar-sounding word meaning "wheat".{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=61}}
Sometimes the borrowed character would be modified slightly to distinguish it from the original, as with {{linktext|毋}} ''wú'' "don't", a borrowing of {{linktext|母}} ''mǔ'' "mother".{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2000|pp=413–414}}

Phono-semantic compounds (形聲字 ''xíngshēngzì'') were obtained by adding semantic indicators to disambiguate phonetic loans.
This type was already used extensively on the oracle bones, and has been the main source of new characters since then.
For example, the character {{linktext|其}} originally representing ''jī'' "winnowing basket" was also used to write the pronoun and modal particle ''qí''.
Later the less common original word was written with the compound {{linktext|箕}}, obtained by adding the symbol {{linktext|竹}} ''zhú'' "bamboo" to the character.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=60}}
Sometimes the original phonetic similarity has been obscured by millennia of sound change, as in {{linktext|格}} ''gé'' &lt; *''krak'' "go to" and {{linktext|路}} ''lù'' &lt; *''graks'' "road".{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=329}}
Many characters often explained as semantic compounds were originally phono-semantic compounds that have been obscured in this way.
Some authors even dispute the validity of the semantic compound category.{{sfnp|Boltz|1994|pp=72, 147–149, 153–154}}

The sixth traditional category (轉注字 ''zhuǎnzhùzì'') contained very few characters, and its meaning is uncertain.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=69}}

=== Styles ===
{{main|Chinese script styles}}
Development and simplification of the script continued during the [[Zhou dynasty|Western Zhou]] and [[Spring and Autumn period]]s, with characters becoming less pictorial and more linear and regular, with rounded strokes being replaced by sharp angles.
During the [[Warring States period]], writing became more widespread, with further simplification and variation, particularly in the eastern states.
After the western state of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] unified China, its more conservative [[seal script]] became the standard for the whole country.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=58, 61–63}}
A simplified form known as the [[clerical script]] became the standard during the [[Han dynasty]], and later evolved into the [[regular script]] still used today.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=63, 65–67}}
At the same time [[semi-cursive script|semi-cursive]] and [[Cursive script (East Asia)|cursive script]]s developed.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=70}}

The [[Traditional Chinese]] script is currently used in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau.
Mainland China and Singapore use the [[Simplified Chinese]] variant.

=== Dialectal writing ===
Until the early 20th century, formal writing employed [[Literary Chinese]], based on the vocabulary and syntax of [[Four Books and Five Classics|classical works]].
The script was also used less formally to record local varieties, which had over time diverged from the classical language and each other.
The logographic script easily accommodated differences in pronunciation, meaning and word order, but often new characters were required for words that could not be related to older forms.
Many such characters were created using the traditional methods, particularly phono-semantic compounds.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=74–77}}

== Adaptations for other languages ==
The Chinese script was for a long period the only writing system in East Asia, and was also hugely influential as the vehicle of the dominant Chinese culture.
Korea, Japan and Vietnam [[adoption of Chinese literary culture|adopted Chinese literary culture]] as a whole.
For many centuries, all writing in neighbouring societies was done in [[Classical Chinese]], albeit influenced by the writer's native language.
Although they wrote in Chinese, writing about local subjects required characters to represent names of local people and places.
Later they sought to use the script to write their own languages.
Chinese characters were adapted to represent the words of other languages using a range of strategies, including
* representing loans from Chinese using their original characters,
* representing words with characters for similar-sounding Chinese words,
* representing words with characters for Chinese words with similar meanings,
* creating new characters using the same formation principles as Chinese characters, especially phono-semantic compounds, and
* creating new characters in other ways, such as compounds of pairs of characters indicating the pronunciation of the initial and final parts of a word respectively (similar to Chinese ''[[fanqie]]'' spellings).
The principle of representing one monosyllabic word with one character was readily applied to neighbouring languages to the south with a similar [[analytic language|analytic]] structure to Chinese, such as [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] and [[Zhuang languages|Zhuang]].
The script was a poorer fit for the polysyllabic [[agglutinative]] languages of the north-east, such as [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and the [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]] and [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] languages.{{sfnp|Coulmas|1991|pp=111–136}}

=== Korean ===
{{main|Hanja|Hangul}}
Chinese characters adapted to write Korean are known as ''Hanja''.
From the 9th century, [[Korean language|Korean]] was written using a number of systems collectively known as [[Idu script|Idu]], in which Hanja were used to write both Sino-Korean and native Korean roots, and a smaller number of Hanja were used to write Korean grammatical morphemes with similar sounds. 
The overlapping uses of Hanja made the system complex and difficult to use, even when reduced forms for grammatical morphemes were introduced with the [[Gugyeol]] system in the 13th and 14th centuries.{{sfnp|Coulmas|1991|pp=116–117}}

The [[Hangul]] alphabet introduced in the 15th century was much simpler, and specifically designed for the sounds of Korean.
The alphabet makes systematic use of modifiers corresponding to features of Korean sounds.
Although Hangul is unrelated to Chinese characters, its letters are written in syllabic blocks that can be interspersed with Hanja. 
Such a [[Korean mixed script]] became the usual way of writing the language, with roots of Chinese origin denoted by Hanja and all other elements rendered in Hangul. Hanja is still used (but not very commonly like the Japanese) and is required in both North and South Korea.{{sfnp|Coulmas|1991|pp=118–122}}

Historically, a few characters were coined in Korea, such as 畓; these are known as ''[[gukja]]'' (國字).

=== Japanese ===
[[File:Katakana origine.svg|thumb|right|Katakana with ''man'yōgana'' equivalents (segments of ''man'yōgana'' adapted into katakana shown in red)]]
[[File:Hiragana origin.svg|thumb|right|Development of hiragana from ''man'yōgana'']]
{{main|Japanese writing system}}
Chinese characters adapted to write [[Japanese language|Japanese]] words are known as [[kanji]].
Chinese words borrowed into Japanese could be written with the Chinese character, while Japanese words could be written using the character for a Chinese word of similar meaning.
Because there have been multiple layers of borrowing into Japanese, a single kanji may have several readings in Japanese.{{sfnp|Coulmas|1991|pp=122–129}}

Other systems, known as [[kana]], used Chinese characters phonetically to transcribe the sounds of Japanese syllables.
An early system of this type was [[Man'yōgana]], as used in the 8th century anthology ''[[Man'yōshū]]''.
This system was not quite a [[syllabary]], because each Japanese syllable could be represented by one of several characters, but from it were derived two syllabaries still in use today.
They differ because they sometimes selected different characters for a syllable, and because they used different strategies to reduce these characters for easy writing: the angular [[katakana]] were obtained by selecting a part of each character, while [[hiragana]] were derived from the cursive forms of whole characters.
Such classic works as [[Lady Murasaki]]'s ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' were written in hiragana, the only system permitted to women of the time.{{sfnp|Coulmas|1991|pp=129–132}}

Modern Japanese writing uses a composite system, using kanji for [[word stem]]s, hiragana for inflexional endings and grammatical words, and katakana to transcribe non-Chinese loanwords.{{sfnp|Coulmas|1991|pp=132–133}}

A few hundred characters have been coined in Japan; these are known as ''[[kokuji]]'' (国字), and include natural phenomena, particularly fish, such as 鰯 (sardine), together with everyday terms such as 働 (work) and technical terms such as 腺 (gland).

=== Vietnamese ===
{{main|Chữ nôm}}
[[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] was first written from the 13th century using the ''Chữ nôm'' script based on Chinese characters, but the system developed in a quite different way than in Korea or Japan.
Vietnamese was and is a strongly analytic language with many distinct syllables (roughly 4,800 in the modern standard language), so there was little motivation to develop a syllabary.
As with Korean and Japanese, characters were used to write borrowed Chinese words, native words with a similar sound and native words with a similar meaning.
In the Vietnamese case, the latter category consisted mainly of early loans from Chinese that had come to be accepted as native.
The Vietnamese system also involved creation of new characters using Chinese principles, but on a far greater scale than in Korea or Japan.
The resulting system was highly complex and was never mastered by more than 5% of the population.
It was completely replaced in the 20th century by the Latin-based [[Vietnamese alphabet]].{{sfnp|Hannas|1997|pp=73–84}}{{sfnp|Handel|2008|pp=119–125}}

=== Zhuang ===
{{main|Sawndip}}
[[Zhuang languages|Zhuang]] has been written using [[Sawndip]] for over a thousand years. The script uses both Chinese characters and new characters formed using the traditional methods, as well as some formed by combining pairs of characters to indicate the pronunciation of a word by the ''fanqie'' method.{{sfnp|Holm|2008}} The number of new created characters is similar in scale to the Chu nom of Vietnam. Even though an official alphabet-based writing system for Zhuang was introduced in 1957, Sawndip is still more often used in less formal situations.&lt;ref&gt;《广西壮族人文字使用现状及文字社会声望调查研究》 "Research into survey of the scripts used by Zhuang in Guangxi" 唐未平 Tang Weiping http://www.doc88.com/p-644582398739.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Others ===
Several peoples in southwest China recorded laws, songs and other religious and cultural texts by representing words of their languages using a mix of Chinese characters with a similar sound or meaning, or pairs of Chinese characters indicating pronunciation using the ''[[fanqie]]'' method.
The languages so recorded included [[Hmongic languages|Miao]], [[Mienic languages|Yao]],{{sfnp|Lemoine|Chiao|1991|p=509}} [[Bouyei language#Ancient Bouyei script|Bouyei]],{{sfnp|Snyder|2008|p=378}} [[Kam language|Kam]],{{sfnp|Yang|Edmondson|2008|p=580}} [[Bai language|Bai]]{{sfnp|Wang|2004|p=279}} and [[Hani language|Hani]].{{sfnp|Zhou|1991}}
All these languages are now written using Latin-based scripts.

Chinese characters were also used to transcribe the Mongolian text of ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]''.

== Scripts influenced by Chinese ==
[[File:CMOC Treasures of Ancient China exhibit - edict plate 2.jpg|thumb|right|Bronze edict plate with Tangut characters]]
Between the 10th and 13th centuries, northern China was ruled by foreign dynasties that created scripts for their own languages.
The [[Khitan large script]] and [[Khitan small script]], which in turn influenced the [[Tangut script]] and [[Jurchen script]], used characters that superficially resemble Chinese characters, but with the exception of a few loans were constructed using quite different principles.
In particular the Khitan small script contained phonetic sub-elements arranged in a square block in a manner similar to the more sophisticated Hangul system devised later for Korean.{{sfnp|Sofronov|1991}}

Other scripts in China that borrowed or adapted some Chinese characters but are otherwise distinct include [[Geba script]], [[Sui script]], [[Yi script]] and the [[Lisu language#Lisu syllabary|Lisu syllabary]].{{sfnp|Zhou|1991}}

A '''conceptual system''' is a system that is composed of non-[[physical system|physical]] [[Object (philosophy)|object]]s, i.e. ideas or concepts. In this context a [[system]] is taken to mean "an interrelated, interworking set of objects".

== Overview ==
A conceptual system is a [[conceptual model]]. Such systems may be related to any topic from [[formal science]] to individual [[imagination]]. Conceptual systems may be found within the human mind, as works of art and fiction, and within the academic world. Indeed, this article may be understood as a conceptual system because it includes a set of interrelated concepts.

Broadly, when a conceptual system includes a range of values, ideas, and beliefs the conceptual system is said be a [[worldview|view of the world]]. In [[psychology]] and [[social work]], a conceptual system may refer to an individual's [[mental model]] of the world. In humans, a conceptual system may be understood as kind of a [[metaphor]] for the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog0402_4 | volume=4 | title=The Metaphorical Structure of the Human Conceptual System | journal=Cognitive Science | pages=195–208 | last1 = Lakoff | first1 = George}}&lt;/ref&gt; In science, there are many forms of conceptual systems including laws, theories, and models. Those conceptual systems may be developed through [[inductive reasoning]], [[deductive reasoning]], and [[empirical analysis]].

The idea that the human mind might contain conceptual systems goes back at least as far as Kelly's [[personal construct theory]] in 1955. More recently, many scholars discuss conceptual systems and the importance of understanding them (c.f. [[Bateson]], [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]], [[Senge]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]], [[Umberto Eco|Eco]], [[Umpleby]], and [http://projectfast.org Wallis]). On the personal level, the human mind is generally held to contain a wide range of conceptual systems although they are not well organized. Indeed, our minds are full of conflicting mental models&lt;ref&gt;http://www.santafe.edu/media/workingpapers/92-09-048.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which makes decision making unreliable - particularly in large-scale, complex situations.

Within the academic literature, each theory may be understood as a conceptual system. Conceptual systems are generally held to have greater value when they are more useful, based on more research, and are more systemically interrelated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.integral-review.org/documents/Wallis,%20Validation%20of%20Theory,%20Vol.%204%20No.%202.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, that validity may also be described in terms of its internal [[Coherence theory of truth|coherence]] and the [[Communication|correspondence]] between the conceptual system and other systems (e.g. [[social system]]s or [[physical system]]s). Coherence may be tested by [[Integrative complexity]] (for individuals) and  by [http://journals.isss.org/index.php/proceedings56th/article/viewFile/1943/657 Integrative Propositional Analysis] (for academic theories). Correspondence is generally tested by [[empirical analysis]] and conditions of [[falsifiability]]. The conceptual system may then be said to model the physical or social system and serve as a guide for individual behavior or academic research.

=== Concept ===
{{Main|Concept}}
A '''concept''' is an [[abstraction|abstract]] [[idea]] or a mental symbol, typically associated with a corresponding representation in [[language]] or [[symbology]], that denotes all of the objects in a given [[Categories (Aristotle)|category]] or [[class (philosophy)|class]] of entities, [[interaction]]s, [[phenomena]], or relationships between them.  Concepts are abstract in that they omit the [[Difference (philosophy)|differences]] of the things in  [[extension (semantics)|extension]], treating them as if they were identical. They are universal in that they apply equally to everything in their extension.  Concepts are also the basic elements of [[proposition]]s, much the same way a [[word]] is the basic [[semantics|semantic]] element of a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. Unlike [[perception]]s, which are particular images of individual objects, concepts cannot be visualized. Because they are not, themselves, individual perceptions, concepts are discursive and result from [[reason]]. They can only be thought about, or designated, by means of a [[name]]. Words are not concepts. Words are signs for concepts.

=== Conceptual schema ===
{{Main|Conceptual schema}}
A conceptual model is a representation of some phenomenon, data or theory by logical and mathematical objects such as [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, [[relation (mathematics)|relation]]s, tables, [[stochastic process]]es, formulas, axiom systems, rules of inference etc. A conceptual model has an [[ontology]], that is the set of expressions in the model which are ''intended'' to denote some aspect of the modeled object. Here we are deliberately vague as to how expressions are constructed in a model and particularly what the logical structure of formulas in a model actually is.  In fact, we have made no assumption that models are encoded in any [[formal logical system]] at all, although we briefly address this issue below. Moreover, the definition given here is oblivious to whether two expressions really should denote the same thing. Note that this notion of ontology is different from (and weaker than) ontology as is sometimes understood in philosophy; in our sense there is no claim that the expressions actually denote anything which exists ''physically'' or ''spatio-temporally'' (to use W. Quine's formulation).

For example, a stochastic model of stock prices includes in its ontology a sample space, random variables, the mean and variance of stock prices, various regression coefficients etc. Models of [[quantum mechanics]] in which [[pure state]]s are represented as unit vectors in a Hilbert space include in their ontologies [[observable]]s, [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], [[measurement]] operators etc. It is possible that observables and states of quantum mechanics are as physically real as the electrons they model, but by adopting this purely formal notion of ontology we avoid altogether this question.

=== Conceptual framework ===
{{Main|Conceptual framework}}
A [[conceptual framework]] is used in research to outline possible courses of action or to present a preferred approach to a [[system analysis]] project. It has also been defined as the organization of ideas to achieve a purpose&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia and Nandhini Rangarajan. 2013. ''A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating conceptual frameworks and project Management.'' Stillwater, OK: New Forums Press&lt;/ref&gt; The framework is built from a set of [[concept]]s linked to a planned or existing [[system]] of [[Method (software engineering)|method]]s, [[behavior]]s, functions, relationships, and [[object (philosophy)|object]]s. A conceptual framework might, in computing terms, be thought of as a [[relational model]].

For example, a conceptual framework of accounting "seeks to identify the nature, subject, purpose and broad content of general-purpose financial reporting and the qualitative characteristics that financial information should possess".&lt;ref&gt;Deegan, J.C. ''Australian Financial Accounting'', McGraw Hill Australia Pty Ltd, New South Wales, 2005, p.1184.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conflict escalation''' is the process by which conflicts grow in severity over time. This may refer to conflicts between individuals or groups in interpersonal relationships, or it may refer to the escalation of hostilities in a political or military context.  In [[systems theory]], the process of conflict escalation is modeled by [[positive feedback]].

While the word ''escalation'' was used as early as in 1938, it was popularized during the [[Cold War]] by two  important books: ''On Escalation'' ([[Herman Kahn]], 1965) and ''Escalation and the Nuclear Option'' ([[Bernard Brodie (military strategist)|Bernard Brodie]], 1966).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freedman|first=Lawrence|title=The evolution of nuclear strategy|year=1993|publisher=St Martin's press|location=New York|isbn=0-312-02843-1|pages=198–199|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ruAxF8SBR3IC&amp;lpg=PR6&amp;dq=%22The%20Impact%20of%20Atomic%20Weapons%20on%20Strategy%20and%20Tactics.%22&amp;pg=PA198#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these contexts, it especially referred to war between two states with [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]]—the [[Cold War]].

Conflict escalation has a tactical role in military conflict, and is often formalized with explicit [[rules of engagement]]. Highly successful [[military tactics]] exploit a particular form of conflict escalation; for example, controlling an opponent's reaction time allows the tactician to pursue or trap his opponent. [[Napoleon]] and [[Heinz Guderian]] both advocated this approach. [[Sun Tzu]] elaborated it in a more abstract form, and additionally maintained that [[military strategy]] was about minimizing escalation, and [[diplomacy]] about eliminating it.

==Continuum of force==
{{Main|Use of force continuum}}
The United States Marine Corps' "Continuum of Force" (found in MCRP 3-02B){{clarify|date=August 2012}}&lt;!-- Huh? Be a little more specific --&gt; documents the stages of conflict escalation in combat for a typical subject. They are:

===Level 1: Compliant (cooperative)===
The subject responds to and obeys verbal commands. He refrains from close combat.

===Level 2: Resistant (passive)===
The subject resists verbal commands but complies to commands immediately upon contact controls. He refrains from close combat.

===Level 3: Resistant (active)===
Initially, the subject physically resists commands, but he can be made to comply by compliance techniques; these include come-along holds, soft-handed stunning blows, and techniques inducing pain by joint manipulation and pressure points.

===Level 4: Assaultive (bodily harm)===
The unarmed subject physically attacks his opponent. He can be controlled by certain defensive tactics, including blocks, strikes, kicks, enhanced pain compliance procedures, impact weapon blocks and [[Strike (attack)|blow]]s.

===Level 5: Assaultive (lethal force)===
The subject has a weapon and will likely kill or injure someone unless controlled. This is only possible by lethal force, which possibly requires firearms or weapons.

==Preventing==
A major focus of peace and conflict theory is concerned with curbing conflict escalation or creating a [[mindset]] to avoid such conflict in future, and instead engaging in [[peacemaking]]. Much nonviolent conflict resolution, however, involves conflict escalation in the form of [[protest]]s, [[Strike action|strike]]s, or other [[direct action]]s.

[[Mohandas Gandhi]], a major proponent of [[nonviolence]], used satyagraha to demonstrate that:
*Peacefully controlling a group of people with a common cause was possible.
*One could accomplish objectives through [[wikt:solidarity|solidarity]] without capitulating to violent attack.
*His method ensured mutual support.
*It was possible to desist from retributive justice.
*It was not ultimately desirable to inflict [[punishment]], even when grievously wronged.

With this method of escalation, Gandhi avoided [[technological escalation]] and demonstrated to those in power that:
* The group was held together by its own discipline, and not by any kind of authority using violence.
* Authority could surrender without being subjected to violence.
* Authority could depart safely.
* Authority could devolve without obstacles, for the [[dissent]] was well enough organized to constitute an effective [[political party]].

==Conflict escalation curve==
{{Original research section|date=September 2016}}
The conflict escalation curve is a concept created by [[Michael N. Nagler]].{{cn|date=September 2016}} The conflict escalation curve proposes that the intensity of a conflict is directly related to how far [[dehumanization]] has proceeded. In other words, conflicts escalate in the degree to which parties dehumanize one another (or one party is dehumanizing the other).

The curve conceptualizes a typical trajectory a conflict would have if it were plotted on an (x,y) graph with (x) being time elapsed and (y) being the intensity of dehumanization. Depending upon which stage a conflict is on the graph, a specific set of responses is needed.
 
The curve divides the appropriate responses into three stages.

===Stage 1: Conflict resolution===
In the first stage no serious dehumanization has occurred by either party. Attempts are made mainly to make one's views known, with the expectation that the other may respond right away or respond to conflict resolution or nonviolent communication to address the adversary. Tools used at this stage include: petitions, protest demonstrations, negotiation, mediation, and arbitration.

===Stage 2: Satyagraha===
The conflict escalates into [[satyagraha]], or nonviolent direct action, only when conflict resolution has been tried and the other party has not been persuaded by reason or the other tools used in Stage 1. Satyagraha invokes what Gandhi called "the law of suffering"—taking on rather than inflicting the suffering that is inherent in the situation.

Invoking satyagraha is a way to move the heart of the adversary, as opposed to appealing merely to the head, in Stage 1. Gandhi observed: "The conviction has been growing upon me that things of fundamental importance to the people are not secured by reason alone, but have to be purchased with their suffering. If you want something really important to be done, you must not merely satisfy the reason, you must move the heart also. The penetration of the heart comes from suffering."&lt;ref&gt;K. Shridharani, "War without Violence" P. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Tools used at this stage include: strikes, boycotts, civil disobedience, defiance of orders.

===Stage 3: Sacrifice: the last resort===
When the conflict has reached life-or-death intensity and when petition and nonviolent resistance have failed, a satyagrahi will sometimes deliberately court the possibility of death as a last resort to open the heart of the opponent. Gandhi's famous "fasts unto death" during the Indian freedom struggle is an example, as well as the courageous work of activists like [[Kathy Kelly]] who, when all else failed, have repeatedly gone into war zones to share the fate of the victims and awaken their oppressors.

The philosophy behind Stage 3 is that being willing to risk dying can often awaken a stubborn adversary even if death does not ensue. Fasting unto death, for example, when contrasted with self-immolation, gives the opponent a chance to respond and save the life of the satyagrahi in question. Self-immolation should perhaps be considered an extreme form of protest rather than the final stage in nonviolent persuasion.

===How to use the conflict escalation curve===
The conflict escalation curve helps those in a movement have a sense of where they are in their conflict and what is an appropriate response; it would be wrong to reach for an extreme method like fasting (which is Stage 3: Sacrifice) in a situation when all available tools in Stage 1 or 2 have not been tried.

For example, in 2003, US President [[George W. Bush]] dismissed the global anti-Iraq protests, the largest such protests since the Vietnam War, as "a focus group," saying: "Size of protest—it's like deciding, well, I'm going to decide policy based upon a focus group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stevenson|first1=Richard|title=Antiwar Protests Fail to Sway Bush on Plans for Iraq|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/19/international/middleeast/19IRAQ.html|accessdate=4 December 2014|agency=NY Times|date=2003-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President's lack of acknowledgement of protesters' demands as well as his unwillingness to engage in negotiations were an indication that it was necessary for the movement to quickly move to Stage 2 if they were to get any response. This was not forthcoming.

==Systems view==
Carol Moore, a later theorist, examined and described Gandhi's methods from the perspective of systems theory.{{cn|date=September 2016}} [[Jay Forrester]] and [[Donella Meadows]] observed that people in crisis would often push the [[twelve leverage points]] towards escalation in the first stage, and then reduce escalation when the resistance had weakened and it was impossible to maintain the status quo.{{cn|date=February 2007}}

'''Conservation grazing''' is the use of semi-[[feral]] or [[domesticated]] [[grazing]] [[livestock]] to maintain and increase the [[biodiversity]] of natural or semi-natural [[grassland]]s, [[heathland]]s, [[wood pasture]], [[wetland]]s and many other [[habitat]]s.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;[http://www.openspacetrust.org/lands/stewardship_conservation.html  Conservation Grazing] Peninsula Open Space Trust, California, US, 2009. (cited 2009 Mar 11)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;[http://www.grazinganimalsproject.org.uk/what_is_conservation_grazing.html What is Conservation Grazing?] Grazing Advice Partnership, UK, 2009. &lt;!-- accessed 19 January 2010 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation grazing is generally less intensive than practices such as [[prescribed burning]],&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt; but still needs to be managed to ensure that [[overgrazing]] does not occur. The practice has proven to be beneficial in moderation in restoring and maintaining grassland and heathland [[ecosystem]]s.  The optimal level of grazing will depend on the goal of conservation, and different levels of grazing, alongside other conservation practices, can be used to induce the desired results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free-Range Landscaping Rent-a-goat.com and Others Bring in Herds to Trim the Yard, Get Rid of Weeds|url=https://www.wsj.com/article/NA_WSJ_PUB:SB10001424052748703578104575397420128248764.html|publisher=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of conservation grazing==
For historic [[grassland]]s, grazing animals, [[herbivore]]s, were a crucial part of the ecosystem. When grazers are removed, historically grazed lands may show a decline in both the density and the diversity of the vegetation.  The history of the land may help ecologists and conservationists determine the best approach to a conservation project.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118487870/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 History distribution and challenges to bison recovery in the northern Chiuahuan desert] ''Rurik, L., G. Ceballos, C. Curtin, P. J. P. Gogan, J. Pacheco, and J. Truett''. Conservation Biology, 2007, 21(6): 1487-1494. &lt;!-- accessed 19 January 2010 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Historic threats to grasslands primarily began with land conversion to crop fields. However, this threat shifted to improper land management techniques and more recently to the expansion of woody species of plants due to a lack of management and to [[climate change]].  These threats hinder the ecological importance of grassland communities. Grasslands are a [[carbon sink]], and benefit livestock. Ecologically, if managed properly, conservation grazing can help to restore these historic ecological assets.  However, if the grazing levels reach too high, shrubs will persist over grassland.&lt;ref name="ref4"&gt;An ecosystem in transition: causes and consequences of the conversion of Mesic grassland to shrubland ''Briggs, J. M., A. K. Knapp, J. L. Heisler, J. M. Blair, M. S. Lett, G. A. Hoch and J. K. Mccarron''. Bioscience, 2005, 55(3): 243-254. &lt;!-- accessed 19 January 2010 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the US established the [[Conservation Reserve Program]] (CRP), which gave money to farmers to leave land fallow, instead of using it for crops or grazing. It was argued that exclusion or use of moderate grazing would be an important factor in future decisions as to what to do with the land that was a part of the CRP program.  The land could have varied uses in the future. The minimization of the effects of climate change has a lot to do with the sequestering of carbon, and expansive grasslands may play an essential role in this process.&lt;ref name="ref5"&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118959510/abstract Effects of grazing on restoration of southern mixed prairie soils] ''Fuhlendorf, S.D., H. Zhang, T.R. Tunnel, D.M. Engle and A.F. Cross''. Restoration Ecology, 2002, 10(2): 401-407. &lt;!-- accessed 19 January 2010 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; But also it could be used for the rotation of crops to the benefit of wildlife populations.{{Clarify|date=April 2009}}&lt;!-- Not clear what relevance this para has to the subject. --&gt;

==Conservation grazing in practice==
[[File:Conservation Grazing Longhorn Cattle to manage NNR at Ruislip Lido.jpg|thumb|Conservation grazing [[English Longhorn|Longhorn Cattle]] to manage [[national nature reserve]] at [[Ruislip Lido]]]]

The use of conservation grazing is dependent on what type of [[ecosystem]], [[habitat]], and [[plant community]] are desired to be maintained or restored.  [[Grazing]] is a beneficial tool used to create a grass and small shrub dominated area. ''Tasker and Bradstock''&lt;ref name="ref6"&gt;[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=17949448 Influence of cattle grazing practices on forest understory structure in North-eastern New South Wales] ''Tasker, E M and R A Bradstock''. Austral Ecology, 2006, 31(4): 490-502. &lt;!-- accessed 19 January 2010 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; found that grazed areas returned a lower vegetation complexity score than ungrazed, however this was mainly because tree species and shrubs produce higher complexity scores than grasses &amp;ndash; the grazed areas were composed primarily of [[bunch grass]]es and the ungrazed were dominated by [[shrub]] species.  Certain areas that have been, historically, woody forest, may be chosen to be restored back to historical conditions, thus ''Tasker’s and Bradstock’s'' study would imply that wooded areas should remain ungrazed by livestock such as cattle.{{Original research inline|date=April 2009}}&lt;!-- Is this their own conclusion?  It does not follow from the work as described -- and anyway what about wood pasture...?  --&gt;

Conservation practices such as grazing need to be monitored closely. If they are not, the practice can become overused and have an opposite effect than intended. Overgrazing may cause [[erosion]], habitat destruction, [[soil compaction]], or reduced biodiversity ([[species richness]]).&lt;ref name="ref7"&gt;Effects of Grazing on the demography and growth of the Texas tortoise ''Kazmaier, R.T., E.C. Hellgren, D.C. Ruthven III, and D.K. Synatzske''. Conservation Biology, 2002, 15(4): 1091-1101.&lt;/ref&gt;

One issue of controversy with grazing is whether conservation grazing is in fact beneficial to a [[grassland]] community and what intensity of grazing management needs to be taken.  ''Rambo and Faeth'' found that the use of vertebrates for grazing of an area would increase the species richness of plants by decreasing the abundance of [[dominant species (ecology)|dominant species]] and increasing the richness of rarer species.  The decrease in abundance may lead to a more open [[forest canopy]] and more room for other plant species to emerge.&lt;ref name="ref8"&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119094187/abstract Effect of Vertebrate Grazing on Plant and Insect Community Structure] ''Rambo, J.L and S.H. Faeth''. Conservation Biology, 2001, 13(5): 1047-1054. &lt;!-- accessed 19 January 2010 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grazing restoration effect dependent on grazer species===
Different grazing species have different effects.  For example, elk and horses have a similar grazing frequency to cattle but tend to spread their zone of grazing to cover a greater area, producing a smaller effect on a given area than cattle would.&lt;ref name="ref9"&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118885724/abstract Differing Effects of Cattle Grazing on Native and Alien Plants] ''Kimball, S. and P.M Schiffman''. Conservation Biology, 2003, 17(6): 1681-1693. &lt;!-- accessed 19 January 2010 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, cattle have been found to be more useful in the restoration of pastures with low species richness, and sheep were found useful for the re-establishment of neglected fields.&lt;ref name="ref10"&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118485902/abstract Effects of livestock breed and grazing intensity on grazing systems: 3. Diversity of Vegetation] ''Scimone, M., A.J. Rook, J.D. Gavel, and N. Sahin''. Grass and Forage Science, 2007, 62(2): 172-184. &lt;!-- accessed 19 January 2010 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The type of area that needs to be restored or maintained will determine the species of grazer ideal for conservation grazing.  ''Dumont et al.''&lt;ref name="ref11"&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118485895/abstract Effects of livestock breed and grazing intensity on biodiversity and production in grazing systems and diet selection: 2. Diet systems] ''Dumont, B., A.J. Rook, Ch. Coran, and K.U. Rover''. Grass and Forage Science, 2007, 62(2): 159-171. &lt;!-- accessed 19 January 2010 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; found in the use of varied breeds of steers that “traditional breeds appeared slightly less selective than commercial breeds”, but did not make a significant difference in biodiversity. In this particular study biodiversity was maintained by the same amount by both breed types.

====Effects on native and non-native plant species====
Conservation grazing is a tool used for conserving biodiversity.  However, one danger in grazing is the potential for [[invasive species]] to be enhanced as well as the native [[biodiversity]].  A study by ''Loeser et al.'' showed that areas of high intensity grazing and grazer removal increased the [[biomass]] of nonnative [[introduced species]].  Both showed that an intermediate approach is the best method.  The nonnatives did demonstrate that they were not as well adapted to the [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]]s, such as [[drought]].  This indicated that implementing controlled grazing methods would decrease the abundance of nonnatives in those plots that had not been properly managed.&lt;ref name="ref12"&gt;[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=18522778 Impact of grazing intensity during Drought in an Arizona Grassland] ''Loeser, M R R, T D Sisk, and T E Creus''. Conservation Biology, 2006, 21(1): 87-97. &lt;!-- accessed 19 January 2010 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Effects of grazing can also depend on the individual plant species and its response to grazing. Plants that are adapted to extensive grazing (such as that done by cattle) will respond quicker and more effectively to grazing than native species that have not had to cope with intense grazing pressure in the past. An experiment done by ''Kimball and Schiffman'' showed that grazing increased the cover of some [[Endemism|native]] species but did not decrease the cover of nonnative species. The species diversity of the native plants was able to respond to the grazing and increase diversity. The community would become denser than originally with the increased biodiversity. (However, this may have been simply variance in plots due to the fact that the native and nonnative compositions were of different species between the grazed and ungrazed plots.)&lt;ref name="ref9" /&gt;

===Effects on non-plant species===

====Insects and butterflies====
Degree of grazing has a significant effect on the [[species richness]] and abundance of insects in grasslands. Land management in the form of grazing tends to decrease diversity with increased intensity. ''Kruess and Tscharntke'' attribute this difference to the increased height of grasses in the ungrazed areas.  The study showed that the abundance and [[diversity of insects]] (such as butterfly adults, trap-nesting bees and wasps) were increased by increased grass height.  However, other insects such as grasshoppers responded better to [[heterogeneity]] of the vegetation.&lt;ref name="ref13"&gt;[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=14420971 Grazing Intensity and the Diversity of Grasshoppers, Butterflies, Trap-Nesting Bees and Wasps] ''Kruess, A. and T. Tscharntke''. Conservation Biology, 2002, 16(6): 1570-1580. &lt;!-- accessed 19 January 2010 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vertebrates====
Grazing can have varied effects on vertebrates. ''Kuhnert et al.'' observed that different bird species react in different ways to changes in grazing intensity.&lt;ref name="ref14"&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/110500501/abstract Assessing the Impacts of grazing levels on bird density in woodland habitat: a Bayesian approach using expert opinion] ''Kuhnert, P.M, T.G. Martin, [[Kerrie Mengersen|K. Mengersen]], and H.P Possingham''. Environmetrics, 2005, 16(7): 717-747. &lt;!-- accessed 19 January 2010 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Grazing has also been thought to decrease the abundance of vertebrates, such as the [[prairie dog]] and the [[desert tortoise]]. However, ''Kazmaier et al.'' found that the effect of moderate grazing on the [[Texas tortoise]] did not show a significant difference when comparing grazed and ungrazed plots.&lt;ref name="ref7" /&gt;

Rabbits have been widely discussed due to their influences on land composition. ''Bell and Watson'' found that rabbits show grazing preference for different plant species.&lt;ref name="ref15"&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119289808/abstract Preferential grazing of five varieties of spring barley by wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus)] ''Bell, A.C. and S. Watson''. Annals of Applied Biology, 2008, 122(3): 637-641. &lt;!-- accessed 19 January 2010 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  This preference can alter the composition of a plant community.&lt;ref name="ref16"&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121359146/abstract Key role of European rabbits in the conservation of the Western Mediterranean Basin Hotspot] ''Delibes-Mateos, M., M. Delibes, P. Ferreras, and R. Villafuerte''. Conservation Biology, 2008, 22(5): 1106-1117. &lt;!-- accessed 19 January 2010 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, if the preference is for a non-native, invasive plant, rabbit grazing may benefit the community by reducing non-native abundance and creating room for the native plant species to fill.&lt;ref name="ref17"&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118852271/abstract The Effects of herbivory and competition on the invasive alien plant Senecio inaequidens (asteraceae)] ''Scherber, C., M.J. Crawley and S. Povembshi''. Diversity and Distributions, 2003, 9(6): 415-426. &lt;!-- accessed 19 January 2010 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; When rabbits graze in moderation they can create a more complex ecosystem, by creating more variable environments that will allow for more predator-competitor relationships between the various organisms.&lt;ref name="ref16" /&gt;  However, besides the effect on wild vegetation, rabbits destroy crops, compete with other herbivores, and can result in extreme ecological damage.  Competition can be direct or indirect.  The rabbits may specifically eat the competitions target food or it may inhibit the growth of grasses that other species eat. For example, rabbit grazing in the Netherlands inhibits tall grasses from becoming dominant. This in turn enhances the suitability of the pasture for [[brent goose]]. However, they may benefit predators that do better in open areas, because the rabbits reduce the amount of vegetation making it easier for those predators to spot their prey.&lt;ref name="ref16" /&gt;&lt;!-- original ref labelled 18 was actually a duplicate of 16 --&gt;

Finally, grazing has demonstrated use in clearing dry brush to reduce the fire hazard of drought-stricken areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brownalumnimagazine.com/content/view/3251/40/|title=American Pastoral|date=Sep–Oct 2012|publisher=''Brown Alumni Monthly''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on ephemeral wetland ecosystems==

[[Ephemeral]] [[wetlands]] degradation and [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] had, at one point in time, been blamed on mismanaged grazing of both native and non-native [[ungulates]] and other grazers.  A study done by Jaymee Marty of [[The Nature Conservancy]] examined the effects on the [[vernal pools]] formed in California when grazers were removed.&lt;ref name="ref18"&gt;[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=17172393 Effects of Cattle Grazing on Diversity in Ephemeral Wetlands] ''Marty, J.T''. Conservation Biology, 2005, 19(5): 1626-1632.  &lt;!-- accessed 19 January 2010 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The results of the short study showed that areas where grazers were removed had a lower diversity of native grasses, invertebrates and vertebrates in the pools, with an increase in non-native grass abundance and distribution in the area.  The study also demonstrated reduced reproduction success of individual species in the area, such as the [[Spea hammondii|western spadefoot toad]] and [[California tiger salamander]].  Marty argues that this decrease is due to ecosystems adapting to historical changes in grazers and the effects they have.  In other words, the historic ecosystem, theoretically, would have responded positively to the removal of cattle grazing, however, the system has adapted to the European introduced species and now may require them for maintained diversity.&lt;ref name="ref18" /&gt; In another study performed by ''Pyke and Marty'', measurements showed that on average, vernal ponds on grazed land pooled longer than ungrazed areas and soil was more resistant to water absorption in the grazed areas.&lt;ref name="ref19"&gt;[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=17172392 Cattle grazing Mediates Climate change impacts on Ephemeral Wetlands] ''Pyke, C.R. and J. Marty''. Conservation Biology, 2005, 19(5): 1619-1625. &lt;!-- accessed 19 January 2010 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similarities with targeted grazing==

The terms conservation grazing and prescription grazing are somewhat synonymous with the term targeted grazing. Targeted grazing was first used in a handbook on the topic in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Launchbaugh|first1=Karen|title=Targeted Grazing: A natural approach to vegetation management and landscape enhancement|date=2006|publisher=National Sheep Industry Improvement Center in Cooperation with the American Sheep Industry Association|url=http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/rx-grazing/handbook.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was coined to differentiate it from prescribed grazing, which the USDA National Resource Conservation Service was using to describe all managed grazing. The term conservation grazing describes grazing by domestic livestock to maintain and restore ecosystem biodiversity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Conservation Grazing?|website=www.grazinganimalsproject.org.uk/what_is_conservation_grazing.html|publisher=Grazing Animals Project|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while targeted grazing has broader vegetation and landscape management goals.

'''Targeted grazing''' is the application of a specific kind of livestock at a determined season, duration, and intensity to accomplish defined vegetation or landscape goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larsen|first1=Dana|title=PROCEDURES USING TARGETED GRAZING – INVASIVE PLANT MANAGEMENT|journal=USDA-NRCS|date=November 5, 2009|volume=Range and Pasture Technical Note #18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The major difference between targeted grazing and other types of grazing management is that targeted grazing focuses on the use of grazing as a tool for vegetation and landscape enhancement rather than livestock production.

==Uses of targeted grazing==

Targeted grazing is another tool in the land manager’s toolbox for constructing desirable ecosystems and landscapes.  Targeted grazing is often used in combination with other technologies such as burning, herbicide applications or land clearing. However, in many areas such as large roadless areas or areas where prescribed burning is a major constraint, targeted grazing might be the best and/or only viable alternative.  Research and on-the-ground experience have shown that targeted grazing can rival traditional herbicide and mechanical control methods for many invasive plants and has been used to reduce fine fuels in fire prone areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Longwell|first1=T|title=Weed control and fire hazard reduction in forest ecosystems with sheep grazing|url=http://ag.ansc.purdue.edu/sheep/ansc442/Semprojs/forest/sheep.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most popular and effective examples of targeted grazing is the use of livestock to manage weeds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gordon|first1=K|title=Use targeted grazing to take aim at invasive weeds|journal=Beef magazine|date=May 2007|url=http://beefmagazine.com/cowcalfweekly/target-grazing-invasive-weeds}}&lt;/ref&gt; and throughout the US and abroad this technique is being utilized to control anything from invasive forb to juniper trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=C. A.|title=Improving the efficacy of goating for biological juniper management|url=http://texnat.tamu.edu/library/symposia/juniper-ecology-and-management/improving-the-efficacy-of-goating-for-biological-juniper-management/|publisher=Texas A&amp;M AgriLife}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles of targeted grazing==

The most important skill for developing a targeted grazing program is patience and commitment.  However, understanding livestock and plant responses to grazing are critical in developing a targeted grazing program.  The program should have a clear statement of the kind of animal, timing and rate of grazing necessary to suppress troublesome plants and maintain a healthy landscape.  The grazing application should 1) cause significant damage to the target plants 2) limit damage to desired vegetation and 3) be integrated with other control strategies.  First, to cause significant damage to targeted plants requires understanding when the target plant is most susceptible to grazing damage and when they are most palatable to livestock.  Target plant palatability depends on the grazing animals inherited and developed plant preferences (i.e. the shape of sheep and goat’s mouths make them well suited for eating broad leaf weeds). Goats are also well designed for eating shrubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Luginbuhl|first1=J. M.|title=Use of Goats as Biological Agents for the Control of Unwanted Vegetation|url=http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/an_sci/extension/animal/meatgoat/MGVeget.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Launchbaugh|first1=K|title=Targeted Grazing: A natural approach to vegetation management and landscape enhancement|date=2006|publisher=National Sheep Industry Improvement Center in Cooperation with the American Sheep Industry Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, target plants often exist in a plant community with many desirable plants.  The challenge is to select the correct animal, grazing time and grazing intensity to maximize the impact on the target plant while reducing it on the associated plant community. Finally, management objectives, target plant species, weather, topography, plant physiology, and associated plant communities are among the many variables that can determine treatment type and duration. Well-developed targeted grazing objectives and an [[adaptive management]] plan that takes into account other control strategies need to be in place.

'''Creativity''' is a phenomenon whereby something new and somehow valuable is formed. The created item may be intangible (such as an [[idea]], a [[scientific theory]], a [[musical composition]], or a [[joke]]) or a physical object (such as an [[invention]], a [[Literature|literary work]], or a [[painting]]).

Scholarly interest in creativity is found in a number of disciplines, primarily [[psychology]], [[business studies]], and [[cognitive science]], but also [[education]], [[technology]], [[engineering]], [[philosophy]] (particularly [[philosophy of science]]), [[theology]], [[sociology]], [[linguistics]],  and [[economics]], covering  the relations between creativity and general [[intelligence]], personality type, mental and neurological processes, mental health, or [[artificial intelligence]]; the potential for fostering creativity through education and training; the fostering of creativity for national economic benefit, and the application of creative resources to improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning.

== Etymology ==
The [[lexeme]] in the English word ''creativity'' comes from the [[Latin]] term ''creō'' "to create, make": its [[Morphological derivation|derivational suffixes]] also come from Latin. The word "create" appeared in English as early as the 14th century, notably in Chaucer, to indicate divine creation&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert"&gt;{{cite book|last=Runco|first=Mark A.|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Creativity|year=2010|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-73025-9|author2=Albert, Robert S.|editor=[[James C. Kaufman]] |editor2=Robert J. Sternberg|chapter=Creativity Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in [[The Parson's Tale]]&lt;ref&gt;"And eke Job saith, that in hell is no order of rule. And albeit that God hath '''created''' all things in right order, and nothing without order, but all things be ordered and numbered, yet nevertheless they that be damned be not in order, nor hold no order."&lt;/ref&gt;). However, its modern meaning as an act of human creation did not emerge until after [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=RuncoAlbert /&gt;

== Definition ==
In a summary of scientific research into creativity, Michael Mumford suggested: "Over the course of the last decade, however, we seem to have reached a general agreement that creativity involves the production of novel, useful products" (Mumford, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;110),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mumford | first1 = M. D. | year = 2003 | title = Where have we been, where are we going? Taking stock in creativity research | url = | journal = [[Creativity Research Journal]] | volume = 15 | issue = 2–3| pages = 107–120 | doi=10.1080/10400419.2003.9651403}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, in [[Robert Sternberg]]'s words, the production of "something original and worthwhile".&lt;ref name="Sternberg Cognitive Psychology 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sternberg|first1=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|date=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-133-38701-5|page=479|edition=6|chapter=Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors have diverged dramatically in their precise definitions beyond these general commonalities: Peter Meusburger reckons that over a hundred different analyses can be found in the literature.&lt;ref name="Meusburger1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meusburger|first=Peter|title=Milieus of Creativity: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Spatiality of Creativity|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-9876-5 |editor=Meusburger, P. |editor2=Funke, J. |editor3=Wunder, E.|chapter=Milieus of Creativity: The Role of Places, Environments and Spatial Contexts}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an illustration, one definition given by [[Ellis Paul Torrance|Dr. E. Paul Torrance]] described it as "a process of becoming sensitive to problems, deficiencies, gaps in knowledge, missing elements, disharmonies, and so on; identifying the difficulty; searching for solutions, making guesses, or formulating hypotheses about the deficiencies: testing and retesting these hypotheses and possibly modifying and retesting them; and finally communicating the results."&lt;ref name="Torrance Test Manual Verbal"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Torrance|first1=Paul|title=The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking-Norms-Technical Manual Research Edition|publisher=Personnel Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|page=6|chapter=Verbal Tests. Forms A and B-Figural Tests, Forms A and B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aspects ==
Theories of creativity (particularly investigation of why some people are more creative than others) have focused on a variety of aspects. The dominant factors are usually identified as "the four Ps" — process, product, person, and place (according to [[James Melvin Rhodes|Mel Rhodes]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mel Rhodes: [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20342603?uid=3737864&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103750220081''An Analysis of Creativity.''] in Phi Delta Kappan 1961, Vol. 42,  No. 7, p. 306–307&lt;/ref&gt; A focus on ''process'' is shown in cognitive approaches that try to describe thought mechanisms and techniques for creative thinking. Theories invoking divergent rather than convergent thinking (such as [[J. P. Guilford|Guilford]]), or those describing the staging of the creative process (such as [[Graham Wallas|Wallas]]) are primarily theories of creative process. A focus on creative ''product'' usually appears in attempts to measure creativity (psychometrics, see below) and in creative ideas framed as successful [[memetics|memes]].&lt;ref name="Gabora"&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Liane Gabora|Gabora, Liane]]|year=1997|title= The Origin and Evolution of Culture and Creativity|journal=Journal of Memetics – Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission|volume=1|url=http://cogprints.org/794/1/oecc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychometric approach to creativity reveals that it also involves the ability to produce more.&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2009 468"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|year=2009|publisher=CENGAGE Learning|isbn=978-0-495-50629-4|page=468|editor=Jaime A. Perkins |editor2=Dan Moneypenny |editor3=Wilson Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A focus on the nature of the creative ''person'' considers more general intellectual habits, such as openness, levels of [[Ideation (creative process)|ideation]], autonomy, expertise, exploratory behavior, and so on. A focus on ''place'' considers the circumstances in which creativity flourishes, such as degrees of autonomy, access to resources, and the nature of gatekeepers. Creative lifestyles are characterized by nonconforming attitudes and behaviors as well as flexibility.&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2009 468" /&gt;

== History of the concept ==
{{Main|History of the concept of creativity}}
[[File:Plato-raphael.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Greek philosophers like Plato rejected the concept of creativity, preferring to see art as a form of discovery. Asked in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?", Plato answers, "Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]]."&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244"&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''A History of Six Ideas: an Essay in Aesthetics'', p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Ancient views ===
Most ancient cultures, including thinkers of [[Ancient Greece]],&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244" /&gt; [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], and [[Outline of ancient India|Ancient India]],&lt;ref name="Albert99"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; lacked the concept of creativity, seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] had no terms corresponding to "to create" or "creator" except for the expression "''poiein''" ("to make"), which only applied to ''poiesis'' (poetry) and to the ''poietes'' (poet, or "maker") who made it. [[Plato]] did not believe in art as a form of creation. Asked in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Plato, The Republic, Book X – [[wikisource:The Republic/Book X]]&lt;/ref&gt; "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?", he answers, "Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]]."&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244" /&gt;

It is commonly argued that the notion of "creativity" originated in [[Western culture]] through [[Christianity]], as a matter of [[Revelation|divine inspiration]].&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt; According to the historian [[Daniel J. Boorstin]], "the early Western conception of creativity was the [[Genesis creation narrative|Biblical story of creation]] given in the ''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]''."&lt;ref name="Albert2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is not creativity in the modern sense, which did not arise until the [[Renaissance]]. In the Judaeo-Christian tradition, creativity was the sole province of God; humans were not considered to have the ability to create something new except as an expression of God's work.&lt;ref name="NiuSternberg"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/h0091265|last=Niu|first=Weihua|author2=Sternberg, Robert J.|title=The Philosophical Roots of Western and Eastern Conceptions of Creativity|journal=Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology|year=2006|volume=26|pages=18–38|url=http://www.westga.edu/~stpp/JTPP_Aticles/26-2/THE1210.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/641OBVx0d?url=http://www.westga.edu/~stpp/JTPP_Aticles/26-2/THE1210.pdf|archivedate=18 December 2011|df=}}; cf.

Runco |editor2=Steven R. Pritzer|chapter=Concepts of Creativity: A history|publisher=[[Elsevier]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romans and Greeks invoked the concept of an external creative "[[daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]]" (Greek) or "[[Genius (mythology)|genius]]" (Latin), linked to the sacred or the divine. However, none of these views are similar to the modern concept of creativity, and the individual was not seen as the cause of creation until the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Albert3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during the Renaissance that creativity was first seen, not as a conduit for the divine, but from the abilities of "[[Great Man theory|great men]]".&lt;ref name="Albert3" /&gt;

=== The Enlightenment and after ===
The rejection of creativity in favor of discovery and the belief that individual creation was a conduit of the divine would dominate the West probably until the [[Renaissance]] and even later.&lt;ref name="NiuSternberg" /&gt; The development of the modern concept of creativity begins in the [[Renaissance]], when creation began to be perceived as having originated from the abilities of the individual, and not God. This could be attributed to the leading intellectual movement of the time, aptly named [[humanism]], which developed an intensely human-centric outlook on the world, valuing the intellect and achievement of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Humanism - Rome Reborn: The Vatican Library &amp; Renaissance Culture {{!}} Exhibitions - Library of Congress|url = https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/vatican/humanism.html|website = www.loc.gov|date = 1993-01-08|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this philosophy arose the [[Renaissance man]] (or polymath), an individual who embodies the principals of humanism in their ceaseless courtship with knowledge and creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Leonardo da Vinci {{!}} Italian artist, engineer, and scientist|url = http://www.britannica.com/biography/Leonardo-da-Vinci|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most well-known and immensely accomplished examples is [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

However, this shift was gradual and would not become immediately apparent until the Enlightenment.&lt;ref name="Albert3" /&gt; By the 18th century and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], mention of creativity (notably in [[aesthetics]]), linked with the concept of [[imagination]], became more frequent.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz80"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tatarkiewicz, Władysław |authorlink=Władysław Tatarkiewicz |title=A History of Six Ideas: an Essay in Aesthetics |location=Translated from the Polish by [[Christopher Kasparek]], The Hague |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the writing of [[Thomas Hobbes]], imagination became a key element of human cognition;&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt; [[William Duff (writer)|William Duff]] was one of the first to identify imagination as a quality of [[genius]], typifying the separation being made between talent (productive, but breaking no new ground) and genius.&lt;ref name="Dacey" /&gt;

As a direct and independent topic of study, creativity effectively received no attention until the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Dacey" /&gt; Runco and Albert argue that creativity as the subject of proper study began seriously to emerge in the late 19th century with the increased interest in individual differences inspired by the arrival of [[Darwinism]]. In particular, they refer to the work of [[Francis Galton]], who through his [[Eugenics|eugenicist]] outlook took a keen interest in the heritability of intelligence, with creativity taken as an aspect of genius.&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt;

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, leading mathematicians and scientists such as [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (1896) and [[Henri Poincaré]] (1908) began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes.

=== Twentieth century to the present day ===
The insights of Poincaré and von Helmholtz were built on in early accounts of the creative process by pioneering theorists such as [[Graham Wallas]]&lt;ref name="Wallas26"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wallas, G. |title=Art of Thought |year=1926 |authorlink=Graham Wallas}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Max Wertheimer]]. In his work ''Art of Thought'', published in 1926, Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process. In the Wallas stage model, creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of 5 stages:
:(i) ''preparation'' (preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individual's mind on the problem and explores the problem's dimensions),
:(ii) ''incubation'' (where the problem is internalized into the unconscious mind and nothing appears externally to be happening),
:(iii) ''intimation'' (the creative person gets a "feeling" that a solution is on its way),
:(iv) ''illumination'' or insight (where the creative idea bursts forth from its [[preconscious]] processing into conscious awareness);
:(v) ''verification'' (where the idea is consciously verified, elaborated, and then applied).
Wallas' model is often treated as four stages, with "intimation" seen as a sub-stage.

Wallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the [[evolution]]ary process, which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments. Simonton&lt;ref name="Simonton99"&gt;{{cite book |author=Simonton, D. K. |year=1999 |title=Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides an updated perspective on this view in his book, ''Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity''.

In 1927, [[Alfred North Whitehead]] gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh, later published as ''[[Process and Reality]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitehead|first=Alfred North|title=Process and reality : an essay in cosmology ; Gifford Lectures delivered in the University of Edinburgh during the session 1927–28|year=1978|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-02-934580-1|edition=Corrected}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with having coined the term "creativity" to serve as the ultimate category of his metaphysical scheme: "Whitehead actually coined the term – our term, still the preferred currency of exchange among literature, science, and the arts. . . a term that quickly became so popular, so omnipresent, that its invention within living memory, and by Alfred North Whitehead of all people, quickly became occluded".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Steven|title=Introduction: Whitehead Now|journal=Configurations|year=2005|volume=1|issue=13|pages=1–33}}. Cf. [[Michel Weber]] and Will Desmond (eds.). ''[https://www.academia.edu/279955/Handbook_of_Whiteheadian_Process_Thought Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought]'' (Frankfurt / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, Process Thought X1 &amp; X2, 2008) and Ronny Desmet &amp; Michel Weber (edited by), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279940/Whitehead._The_Algebra_of_Metaphysics Whitehead. The Algebra of Metaphysics. Applied Process Metaphysics Summer Institute Memorandum]'', Louvain-la-Neuve, Les Éditions Chromatika, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] measurement of creativity, from the standpoint of orthodox [[Psychology|psychological]] literature, is usually considered to have begun with [[J. P. Guilford]]'s 1950 address to the [[American Psychological Association]], which helped popularize the topic&lt;ref name="Sternberg99"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sternberg, R. J. |author2=Lubart, T. I. |chapter=The Concept of Creativity: Prospects and Paradigms |editor=Sternberg, R. J. |title=Handbook of Creativity |year=1999 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |authorlink=Robert Sternberg |isbn=978-0-521-57285-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and focus attention on a scientific approach to conceptualizing creativity. (It should be noted that the London School of Psychology had instigated psychometric studies of creativity as early as 1927 with the work of H. L. Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hargreaves | first1 = H. L. | year = 1927 | title = The faculty of imagination: An enquiry concerning the existence of a general faculty, or group factor, of imagination | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = Monograph Supplement 3 | issue = | pages = 1–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it did not have the same impact.) Statistical analysis led to the recognition of creativity (as measured) as a separate aspect of human cognition to [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]]-type intelligence, into which it had previously been subsumed. Guilford's work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ, the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down.&lt;ref name="Kozbelt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kozbelt|first=Aaron|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Creativity|year=2010|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-73025-9 |author2=Beghetto, Ronald A. |author3=Runco, Mark A.|editor=[[James C. Kaufman]] |editor2=Robert J. Sternberg|chapter=Theories of Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Four C" model ===
[[James C. Kaufman]] and Beghetto introduced a "four C" model of creativity; ''mini-c'' ("transformative learning" involving "personally meaningful interpretations of experiences, actions, and insights"), ''little-c'' (everyday problem solving and creative expression), ''Pro-C'' (exhibited by people who are professionally or vocationally creative though not necessarily eminent) and ''Big-C'' (creativity considered great in the given field). This model was intended to help accommodate models and theories of creativity that stressed competence as an essential component and the historical transformation of a creative domain as the highest mark of creativity. It also, the authors argued, made a useful framework for analyzing creative processes in individuals.&lt;ref name="KaufBeg2009"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/a0013688|last=Kaufman|first=James C.|author2=Beghetto, Ronald A.|title=Beyond Big and Little: The Four C Model of Creativity|journal=[[Review of General Psychology]]|year=2009|volume=13|issue=1|pages=1–12|authorlink=James C. Kaufman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contrast of terms "Big C" and "Little c" has been widely used. Kozbelt, Beghetto and Runco use a little-c/Big-C model to review major theories of creativity.&lt;ref name=Kozbelt /&gt; [[Margaret Boden]] distinguishes between h-creativity (historical) and p-creativity (personal).&lt;ref name="Boden2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boden|first=Margaret|title=The Creative Mind: Myths And Mechanisms|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-297-82069-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craft makes a similar distinction between "high" and "little c" creativity.&lt;ref name="Craft1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Craft|first=Anna|title=Creativity in education|year=2001|publisher=Continuum International|isbn=978-0-8264-4863-7 |editor=Craft, A. |editor2=Jeffrey, B. |editor3=Leibling, M. |chapter='Little C' creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cites [[Ken Robinson (educationalist)|Ken Robinson]] as referring to "high" and "democratic" creativity. [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]]&lt;ref name="Csik1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Csíkszentmihályi |first=Mihály|title=Creativity:Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention|year=1996|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0-06-092820-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; has defined creativity in terms of those individuals judged to have made significant creative, perhaps domain-changing contributions. Simonton has analysed the career trajectories of eminent creative people in order to map patterns and predictors of creative productivity.&lt;ref name="Simonton97"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.104.1.66|last=Simonton|first=D. K.|title=Creative Productivity: A Predictive and Explanatory Model of Career Trajectories and Landmarks|journal=Psychological Review|year=1997|volume=104|issue=1|pages=66–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories of creative processes ==
There has been much empirical study in [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]] of the processes through which creativity occurs. Interpretation of the results of these studies has led to several possible explanations of the sources and methods of creativity.

=== Incubation ===
Incubation is a temporary break from [[creative problem solving]] that can result in insight.&lt;ref name="EoC Incubation"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=S. M.|title=Encyclopedia of Creativity Volume I|year=2011|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-375039-6|pages=653–657|edition=2nd|editor=M. A. Runco |editor2=S. R. Pritzker|chapter=Incubation}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been some empirical research looking at whether, as the concept of "incubation" in [[Graham Wallas|Wallas]]' model implies, a period of interruption or rest from a problem may aid creative problem-solving. Ward&lt;ref name="Ward2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ward, T. |year=2003 |chapter=Creativity |editor= Nagel, L. |title=Encyclopaedia of Cognition |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation may aid creative problem-solving, and notes how some [[empirical evidence]] is consistent with the hypothesis that incubation aids creative problem-solving in that it enables "forgetting" of misleading clues. Absence of incubation may lead the problem solver to become [[fixation (psychology)|fixated]] on inappropriate strategies of solving the problem.&lt;ref name="Smith1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Steven M.|title=The Creative Cognition Approach|year=1995|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|editor=Steven M. Smith |editor2=Thomas B. Ward |editor3=Ronald A. Finke|chapter=Fixation, Incubation, and Insight in Memory and Creative Thinking}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work disputes the earlier hypothesis that creative solutions to problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind is occupied on other tasks.&lt;ref name=Anderson2000&gt;"{{cite book |author=Anderson, J. R. |year=2000 |title=Cognitive psychology and its implications |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=978-0-7167-1686-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This earlier hypothesis is discussed in [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|Csikszentmihalyi]]'s five phase model of the creative process which describes incubation as a time that your unconscious takes over. This allows for unique connections to be made without your consciousness trying to make logical order out of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly (1996). ''Creativity : Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention.'' New York: Harper Perennial. {{ISBN|0-06-092820-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convergent and divergent thinking ===
[[J. P. Guilford]]&lt;ref name="Guilford67"&gt;{{cite book |author=Guilford, J. P. |year=1967 |title=The Nature of Human Intelligence |authorlink=J. P. Guilford}}&lt;/ref&gt; drew a distinction between convergent and divergent production (commonly renamed [[convergent thinking|convergent]] and [[divergent thinking]]). Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single, correct solution to a problem, whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem. Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature. Other researchers have occasionally used the terms ''flexible'' thinking or [[fluid and crystallized intelligence|fluid intelligence]], which are roughly similar to (but not synonymous with) creativity.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

=== Creative cognition approach ===
In 1992, Finke et al. proposed the "Geneplore" model, in which creativity takes place in two phases: a generative phase, where an individual constructs mental representations called preinventive structures, and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas. Some evidence shows that when people use their imagination to develop new ideas, those ideas are heavily structured in predictable ways by the properties of existing categories and concepts.&lt;ref name="Ward1995"&gt;Ward, T.B. (1995). What’s old about new ideas. In S. M. Smith, T. B. Ward &amp; R. A. &amp; Finke (Eds.) ''The creative cognition approach'', 157–178, London: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Weisberg&lt;ref name="Weisberg93"&gt;{{cite book |author=Weisberg, R. W. |year=1993 |title=Creativity: Beyond the myth of genius |publisher=Freeman |isbn=978-0-7167-2119-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued, by contrast, that creativity only involves ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordinary results.

=== The Explicit–Implicit Interaction (EII) theory ===
Helie and Sun&lt;ref name="HelieSun2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Helie S. |author2=Sun R. | year = 2010 | title = Incubation, insight, and creative problem solving: A unified theory and a connectionist model | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 117 | issue = 3| pages = 994–1024 | doi=10.1037/a0019532 | pmid=20658861|citeseerx=10.1.1.405.2245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; recently proposed a unified framework for understanding [[creative problem-solving|creativity in problem solving]], namely the Explicit–Implicit Interaction (EII) theory of creativity. This new theory constitutes an attempt at providing a more unified explanation of relevant phenomena (in part by reinterpreting/integrating various fragmentary existing theories of [[Incubation (psychology)|incubation]] and [[insight]]).

The EII theory relies mainly on five basic principles, namely:
# The co-existence of and the difference between explicit and implicit knowledge; 
# The simultaneous involvement of implicit and explicit processes in most tasks; 
# The redundant representation of explicit and implicit knowledge; 
# The integration of the results of explicit and implicit processing;
# The iterative (and possibly bidirectional) processing. 
A computational implementation of the theory was developed based on the [[CLARION (cognitive architecture)|CLARION cognitive architecture]] and used to simulate relevant human data. This work represents an initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity encompassing incubation, insight, and various other related phenomena.

=== Conceptual blending ===
{{Main|Conceptual blending}}
In ''[[The Act of Creation]]'', [[Arthur Koestler]] introduced the concept of ''bisociation'' — that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference.&lt;ref name="Koestler64"&gt;{{cite book |author=Koestler, A. |title=The Act of Creation |year=1964 |authorlink=Arthur Koestler |isbn=978-0-330-73116-4 |publisher=Pan Books |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was later developed into conceptual blending. In the 1990s, various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with [[metaphor]], [[analogy]], and [[structure mapping]] have been converging, and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science, art and humor has emerged under the label [[conceptual blending]].

=== Honing theory ===
Honing theory, developed principally by psychologist [[Liane Gabora]], posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing, self-mending nature of a worldview. The creative process is a way in which the individual hones (and re-hones) an integrated worldview. Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process. When faced with a creatively demanding task, there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview. The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task. This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete, at which point not only is the task conceived of differently, but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components, whether they be ideas, attitudes, or bits of knowledge.

A central feature of honing theory is the notion of a potentiality state.&lt;ref&gt;Gabora, L. &amp; Saab, A. (2011). Creative interference and states of potentiality in analogy problem solving. ''Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society''. July 20–23, 2011, Boston MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly ‘mutating’ predefined possibilities, but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory. Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences, but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task. Thus the creative idea may feel ‘half-baked’. It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state, because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with.

Honing theory is held to explain certain phenomena not dealt with by other theories of creativity, for example, how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or 'voice' even through in different creative outlets. This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise, but it is predicted by honing theory, according to which personal style reflects the creator's uniquely structured worldview. Another example is in the environmental stimulus for creativity. Creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive, nurturing, trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization. However, research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity, which would stimulate honing.

=== Everyday imaginative thought ===
In everyday thought, people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think "if only...".&lt;ref&gt;Roese, N. J. &amp; Olson, J. M. (1995). ''What Might Have Been: The Social Psychology of Counterfactual Thinking''. Mahwah, New Jersey: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[counterfactual thinking]] is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes.&lt;ref&gt;Markman, K. Klein, W. &amp; Suhr, E. (eds) (2009). ''Handbook of mental simulation and the human imagination.'' Hove, Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that the creation of counterfactual alternatives to reality depends on similar cognitive processes to rational thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth M. J. Byrne|Byrne, R. M. J.]] (2005). The Rational Imagination: How People Create Counterfactual Alternatives to Reality. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessing individual creative ability ==
=== Creativity quotient ===
There was a ''creativity quotient'' developed similar to the [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ). It makes use of the results of divergent thinking tests (see below) by processing them further. It gives more weight to ideas that are radically different from other ideas in the response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Allan|date=2004|title=The creativity quotient: An objective scoring of ideational fluency|journal=Creativity Research Journal|volume=16|issue=4|pages=415–419|doi=10.1080/10400410409534552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychometric approach ===
[[J. P. Guilford]]'s group,&lt;ref name="Guilford67" /&gt; which pioneered the modern [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] study of creativity, constructed several tests to measure creativity in 1967:
* Plot Titles, where participants are given the plot of a story and asked to write original titles.
* Quick Responses is a word-association test scored for uncommonness.
* Figure Concepts, where participants were given simple drawings of objects and individuals and asked to find qualities or features that are common by two or more drawings; these were scored for uncommonness.
* Unusual Uses is finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as bricks.
* Remote Associations, where participants are asked to find a word between two given words (e.g. Hand _____ Call)
* Remote Consequences, where participants are asked to generate a list of consequences of unexpected events (e.g. loss of gravity)

Building on Guilford's work, [[Ellis Paul Torrance|Torrance]]&lt;ref&gt;(Torrance, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; developed the [[Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://people.uncw.edu/caropresoe/GiftedFoundations/SocialEmotional/Creativity-articles/Kim_Can-we-trust-creativity-tests.pdf|title=Can We Trust Creativity Tests?|author=Kim, Kyung Hee|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They involved simple tests of divergent thinking and other problem-solving skills, which were scored on:
* '''Fluency''' – The total number of interpretable, meaningful, and relevant ideas generated in response to the stimulus.
* '''Originality''' – The statistical rarity of the responses among the test subjects.
* '''Elaboration''' – The amount of detail in the responses.

Such tests, sometimes called ''Divergent Thinking (DT)'' tests have been both supported&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = K.

Considerable progress has been made in automated scoring of [[divergent thinking]] tests using semantic approach. When compared to human raters, [[Natural language processing|NLP]] techniques were shown to be reliable and valid in scoring the originality.&lt;ref&gt;Forster, E. A., &amp; Dunbar, K. N. (2009). Creativity evaluation through latent semantic analysis. In Proceedings of the 31st Annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. 602–607).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, I. J., &amp; Haarmann, H. (2014). Automated scoring of originality using semantic representations. In Proceedings of the 36th Annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (poster paper).&lt;/ref&gt; The reported computer programs were able to achieve a correlation of 0.60 and 0.72 respectively to human graders.

Semantic networks were also used to devise originality scores that yielded significant correlations with socio-personal measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Acar | first1 = S. | last2 = Runco | first2 = M.

Kaufman]] and Mark A. Runco&lt;ref&gt;Other members include Kenes Beketayev PhD Computer Science; Liberty Lidz, PhD Linguistics; Perman Gochyyev, PhD Statistics&lt;/ref&gt; combined expertise in creativity research, natural language processing, computational linguistics, and statistical data analysis to devise a scalable system for computerized automated testing (SparcIt Creativity Index Testing system). This system enabled automated scoring of [[Divergent thinking|DT]] tests that is reliable, objective, and scalable, thus addressing most of the issues of [[Divergent thinking|DT]] tests that had been found and reported.&lt;ref name="doi10.1080/10400419.2011.545713" /&gt; The resultant computer system was able to achieve a correlation of 0.73 to human graders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beketayev | first1 = K. | last2 = Runco | first2 = M.

=== Social-personality approach ===
Some researchers have taken a social-personality approach to the measurement of creativity. In these studies, personality traits such as independence of judgement, self-confidence, attraction to complexity, aesthetic orientation, and risk-taking are used as measures of the creativity of individuals.&lt;ref name="Sternberg99" /&gt; A [[meta-analysis]] by Gregory Feist showed that creative people tend to be "more open to new experiences, less conventional and less conscientious, more self-confident, self-accepting, driven, ambitious, dominant, hostile, and impulsive." Openness, conscientiousness, self-acceptance, hostility, and impulsivity had the strongest effects of the traits listed.&lt;ref name=Feist /&gt; Within the framework of the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] model of personality, some consistent traits have emerged.&lt;ref name="Batey, M. 2006 p. 355-429"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Batey | first1 = M. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A. | year = 2006 | title = Creativity, intelligence and personality: A critical review of the scattered literature | url = | journal = Genetic, Social, and General Psychology Monographs | volume = 132 | issue = 4| pages = 355–429 | doi=10.3200/mono.132.4.355-430}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Openness to experience]] has been shown to be consistently related to a whole host of different assessments of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Batey | first1 = M. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A. F. | last3 = Safiullina | first3 = X. | year = 2010 | title = Intelligence, General Knowledge and Personality as Predictors of Creativity | url = | journal = Learning and Individual Differences | volume = 20 | issue = 5| pages = 532–535 | doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2010.04.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the other Big Five traits, research has demonstrated subtle differences between different domains of creativity. Compared to non-artists, artists tend to have higher levels of openness to experience and lower levels of conscientiousness, while scientists are more open to experience, [[Conscientiousness|conscientious]], and higher in the confidence-dominance facets of extraversion compared to non-scientists.&lt;ref name=Feist&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feist | first1 = G. J. | year = 1998 | title = A meta-analysis of the impact of personality on scientific and artistic creativity | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychological Review | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 290–309 | doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0204_5| pmid = 15647135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-report questionnaires ===
An alternative are biographical methods. These methods use quantitative characteristics such as the number of publications, patents, or performances of a work. While this method was originally developed for highly creative personalities, today it is also available as [[Self-report study#Questionnaires and interviews|self-report questionnaires]] supplemented with frequent, less outstanding creative behaviors such as writing a short story or creating your own recipes. For example, the [[Creativity Achievement Questionnaire|Creative Achievement Questionnaire]], a self-report test that measures creative achievement across 10 domains, was described in 2005 and shown to be reliable and valid when compared to other measures of creativity and to independent evaluation of creative output.&lt;ref&gt;(Carson, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the English original, it was also used in a Chinese,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ying-Yao|first=Wang, Chia-Chi{{!}}Ho, Hsiao-Chi{{!}}Cheng, Chih-Ling{{!}}Cheng|date=2014-00-00|title=Application of the Rasch Model to the Measurement of Creativity: The Creative Achievement Questionnaire.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1088863|journal=Creativity Research Journal|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|issn=1040-0419}}&lt;/ref&gt; French,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bendetowicz|first=David|last2=Urbanski|first2=Marika|last3=Aichelburg|first3=Clarisse|last4=Levy|first4=Richard|last5=Volle|first5=Emmanuelle|date=2017-01|title=Brain morphometry predicts individual creative potential and the ability to combine remote ideas|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010945216303161|journal=Cortex|volume=86|pages=216–229|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2016.10.021|pmid=27919546|issn=0010-9452}}&lt;/ref&gt; and German-speaking&lt;ref name="Form 440–450"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Form|first=Sven|last2=Schlichting|first2=Kerrin|last3=Kaernbach|first3=Christian|date=2017-11|title=Mentoring functions: Interpersonal tensions are associated with mentees' creative achievement.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=440–450|doi=10.1037/aca0000103|issn=1931-390X}}&lt;/ref&gt; version. It is the self-report questionnaire most frequently used in research.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Creativity and intelligence ==
The potential relationship between creativity and [[intelligence]] has been of interest since the late 1900s, when a multitude of influential studies – from Getzels &amp; Jackson,&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962"&gt;Getzels, J. W., &amp; Jackson, P. W. (1962). Creativity and intelligence: Explorations with gifted students. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Barron,&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963"&gt;Barron, F. (1963). Creativity and psychological health. Princeton: D. Van Nostrand Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallach &amp; Kogan,&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965"&gt;Wallach, M. A., &amp; Kogan, N. (1965). Modes of thinking in young children: A study of the creativity-intelligence distinction. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; and Guilford&lt;ref name="Guilford, J. P. 1967"&gt;Guilford, J. P. (1967). The nature of human intelligence. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; – focused not only on creativity, but also on intelligence. This joint focus highlights both the theoretical and practical importance of the relationship: researchers are interested not only if the constructs are related, but also how and why.&lt;ref&gt;Plucker, J., &amp; Renzulli, J. S. (1999). Psychometric approaches to the study of human creativity. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 35–60). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple theories accounting for their relationship, with the 3 main theories as follows:

*Threshold Theory – Intelligence is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for creativity. There is a moderate positive relationship between creativity and intelligence until IQ ~120.&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guilford, J. P. 1967" /&gt;
*Certification Theory – Creativity is not intrinsically related to intelligence. Instead, individuals are required to meet the requisite level intelligence in order to gain a certain level of education/work, which then in turn offers the opportunity to be creative. Displays of creativity are moderated by intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, J. R. (1989). Cognitive processes in creativity. In J. A. Glover, R. R. Ronning, &amp; C. R. Reynolds (Eds.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 135–145). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Interference Theory – Extremely high intelligence might interfere with creative ability.&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1996"&gt;Sternberg, R. J. (1996). Successful Intelligence. NewYork: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sternberg and O’Hara&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1999 pp. 251"&gt;Sternberg, R. J., &amp; O’Hara, L. A. (1999). Creativity and intelligence. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 251–272). Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a framework of 5 possible relationships between creativity and intelligence:
#Creativity is a subset of intelligence
#Intelligence is a subset of creativity
#Creativity and intelligence are overlapping constructs
#Creativity and intelligence are part of the same construct (coincident sets)
#Creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs (disjoint sets)

=== Creativity as a subset of intelligence ===
A number of researchers include creativity, either explicitly or implicitly, as a key component of intelligence.

''Examples of theories that include creativity as a subset of intelligence''

*Gardner’s  [[Theory of multiple intelligences]] (MIT)&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (1993). Creating minds. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; – implicitly includes creativity as a subset of MIT. To demonstrate this, Gardner cited examples of different famous creators, each of whom differed in their types of intelligences e.g. Picasso (spatial intelligence); Freud (intrapersonal); Einstein (logical-mathematical); and Gandhi (interpersonal).
*Sternberg’s Theory of Successful intelligence&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1999 pp. 251" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, R. J., Kaufman, J. C., &amp; Grigorenko, E. L. (2008). Applied intelligence. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Triarchic theory of intelligence]]) includes creativity as a main component, and comprises 3 sub-theories: Componential (Analytic), Contextual (Practical), and Experiential (Creative). Experiential sub-theory – the ability to use pre-existing knowledge and skills to solve new and novel problems – is directly related to creativity.
*The [[Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory]] includes creativity as a subset of intelligence. Specifically, it is associated with the broad group factor of long-term storage and retrieval (Glr). Glr narrow abilities relating to creativity include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaufman | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = S. B. | last3 = Lichtenberger | first3 = E. O. | year = 2011 | title = Finding creativity on intelligence tests via divergent production | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of School Psychology | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 83–106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ideational fluency, associational fluency, and originality/creativity. Silvia et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Silvia | first1 = P. J. | last2 = Beaty | first2 = R. E. | last3 = Nusbaum | first3 = E.

Martindale&lt;ref&gt;Martindale, C. (1999). Biological bases of creativity. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 137– 152). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; extended the CHC-theory in the sense that it was proposed that those individuals who are creative are also selective in their processing speed Martindale argues that in the creative process, larger amounts of information are processed more slowly in the early stages, and as the individual begins to understand the problem, the processing speed is increased.
*The Dual Process Theory of Intelligence&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, J.C., Kaufman, S.B., &amp; Plucker, J.A. (2013). Contemporary theories of intelligence. In J. Reisberg (Ed.), The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Psychology (pp. 811-822). New York, NY: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; posits a two-factor/type model of intelligence. Type 1 is a conscious process, and concerns goal directed thoughts, which are explained by ''g''. Type 2 is an unconscious process, and concerns spontaneous cognition, which encompasses daydreaming and implicit learning ability. Kaufman argues that creativity occurs as a result of Type 1 and Type 2 processes working together in combination. The use of each type in the creative process can be used to varying degrees.

=== Intelligence as a subset of creativity ===
In this relationship model, intelligence is a key component in the development of creativity.

''Theories of creativity that include intelligence as a subset of creativity''

*Sternberg &amp; Lubart’s Investment Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Lubart | first2 = T. I. | year = 1991 | title = An investment theory of creativity and its development | url = | journal = Human Development | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 1–32 | doi=10.1159/000277029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Lubart | first2 = T. I. | year = 1992 | title = Buy low and sell high: An investment approach to creativity | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 1–5 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.1992.tb00002.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the metaphor of a stock market, they demonstrate that creative thinkers are like good investors – they buy low and sell high (in their ideas). Like under/low-valued stock, creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people. The creative individual has to persevere, and convince the others of the ideas value. After convincing the others, and thus increasing the ideas value, the creative individual ‘sells high’ by leaving the idea with the other people, and moves onto generating another idea. According to this theory, six distinct, but related elements contribute to successful creativity: intelligence, knowledge, thinking styles, personality, motivation, and environment. Intelligence is just one of the six factors that can either solely, or in conjunction with the other five factors, generate creative thoughts.
*Amabile’s Componential Model of Creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amabile | first1 = T. M. | year = 1982 | title = Social psychology of creativity: A consensual assessment technique | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = 5| pages = 997–1013 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.5.997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amabile, T. M. (1996). Creativity in context: Update to "The Social Psychology of Creativity". Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, there are 3 within-individual components needed for creativity – domain-relevant skills, creativity-relevant processes, and task motivation – and 1 component external to the individual: their surrounding social environment. Creativity requires a confluence of all components. High creativity will result when an individual is: intrinsically motivated, possesses both a high level of domain-relevant skills and has high skills in creative thinking, and is working in a highly creative environment.
*Amusement Park Theoretical Model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baer | first1 = J. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = J. C. | year = 2005 | title = Bridging generality and specificity: The Amusement Park Theoretical (APT) Model of creativity | url = | journal = Roeper Review | volume = 27 | issue = 3| pages = 158–163 | doi=10.1080/02783190509554310}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this 4-step theory, both domain-specific and generalist views are integrated into a model of creativity. The researchers make use of the metaphor of the amusement park to demonstrate that within each of these creative levels, intelligence plays a key role:
**To get into the amusement park, there are initial requirements (e.g., time/transport to go to the park). Initial requirements (like intelligence) are necessary, but not sufficient for creativity. They are more like prerequisites for creativity, and if an individual does not possess the basic level of the initial requirement (intelligence), then they will not be able to generate creative thoughts/behaviour.
**Secondly are the subcomponents – general thematic areas – that increase in specificity. Like choosing which type of amusement park to visit (e.g. a zoo or a water park), these areas relate to the areas in which someone could be creative (e.g. poetry).
**Thirdly, there are specific domains. After choosing the type of park to visit e.g. waterpark, you then have to choose which specific park to go to. Within the poetry domain, there are many different types (e.g. free verse, riddles, sonnet, etc.) that have to be selected from.
**Lastly, there are micro-domains. These are the specific tasks that reside within each domain e.g. individual lines in a free verse poem / individual rides at the waterpark.

=== Creativity and intelligence as overlapping yet distinct constructs ===
This possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct, but intersecting constructs.

''Theories that include Creativity and Intelligence as Overlapping Yet Distinct Constructs''

*Renzulli’s Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Renzulli | first1 = J. S. | year = 1978 | title = What makes giftedness? Reexamining a definition | url = | journal = Phi Delta Kappan | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 180–261 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this conceptualisation, giftedness occurs as a result from the overlap of above average intellectual ability, creativity, and task commitment. Under this view, creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs, but they do overlap under the correct conditions.
*[[PASS theory of intelligence]]. In this theory, the planning component – relating to the ability to solve problems, make decisions and take action – strongly overlaps with the concept of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Naglieri | first1 = J. A. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = J. C. | year = 2001 | title = Understanding intelligence, giftedness, and creativity using PASS theory | url = | journal = Roeper Review | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 151–156 | doi=10.1080/02783190109554087}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Threshold Theory (TT). A number of previous research findings have suggested that a threshold exists in the relationship between creativity and intelligence – both constructs are moderately positively correlated up to an IQ of ~120. Above this threshold of an IQ of 120, if there is a relationship at all, it is small and weak.&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torrance, E. P. (1962). Guiding creative talent. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; TT posits that a moderate level of intelligence is necessary for creativity.

In support of the TT, Barron&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barron, F. (1969). Creative person and creative process. New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; reported finding a non-significant correlation between creativity and intelligence in a gifted sample; and a significant correlation in a non-gifted sample. Yamamoto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yamamoto | first1 = K | year = 1964 | title = Creativity and sociometric choice among adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 2| pages = 249–261 | doi=10.1080/00224545.1964.9919564| pmid = 14238998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a sample of secondary school children, reported a significant correlation between creativity and intelligence of ''r'' = .3, and reported no significant correlation when the sample consisted of gifted children.

Kim’s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = K. H. | year = 2005 | title = Can only intelligent people be creative? | url = | journal = Journal of Secondary Gifted Education | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 57–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; meta-analysis of 21 studies did not find any supporting evidence for TT, and instead negligible correlations were reported between intelligence, creativity, and divergent thinking both below and above IQ's of 120. Preckel et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Preckel | first1 = F. | last2 = Holling | first2 = H. | last3 = Wiese | first3 = M. | year = 2006 | title = Relationship of intelligence and creativity in gifted and non-gifted students: An investigation of threshold theory | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 159–170 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.06.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigating fluid intelligence and creativity, reported small correlations of ''r'' = .3 to ''r'' = .4 across all levels of cognitive ability.

=== Creativity and intelligence as coincident sets ===
Under this view, researchers posit that there are no differences in the mechanisms underlying creativity in those used in normal problem solving; and in normal problem solving, there is no need for creativity. Thus, creativity and Intelligence (problem solving) are the same thing. Perkins&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, D. N. (1981) The mind’s best work. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; referred to this as the ‘nothing-special’ view.

Weisberg &amp; Alba&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weisberg | first1 = R. W. | last2 = Alba | first2 = J. W. | year = 1981 | title = An examination of the alleged role of "fixation" in the solution of several "insight" problems | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: General | volume = 110 | issue = 2| pages = 169–192 | doi=10.1037/0096-3445.110.2.169}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined problem solving by having participants complete the 9-dot problem (see [[Thinking outside the box#Nine dots puzzle]]) – where the participants are asked to connect all 9 dots in the 3 rows of 3 dots using 4 straight lines or less, without lifting their pen or tracing the same line twice. The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside the boundaries of the square of dots. Results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight, they still found it difficult to solve the problem, thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just insight (or creativity) that is required.

=== Creativity and intelligence as disjoint sets ===
In this view, creativity and intelligence are completely different, unrelated constructs.

Getzels and Jackson&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962" /&gt; administered 5 creativity measures to a group of 449 children from grades 6-12, and compared these test findings to results from previously administered (by the school) IQ tests. They found that the correlation between the creativity measures and IQ was ''r'' = .26. The high creativity group scored in the top 20% of the overall creativity measures, but were not included in the top 20% of IQ scorers. The high intelligence group scored the opposite: they scored in the top 20% for IQ, but were outside the top 20% scorers for creativity, thus showing that creativity and intelligence are distinct and unrelated.

However, this work has been heavily criticised. Wallach and Kogan&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965" /&gt; highlighted that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another (to the extent that they were no more related to one another than they were with IQ), but they seemed to also draw upon non-creative skills. McNemar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McNemar | first1 = O | year = 1964 | title = Lost: Our Intelligence? Why? | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 19 | issue = 12| pages = 871–882 | doi=10.1037/h0042008}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that there were major measurement issues, in that the IQ scores were a mixture from 3 different IQ tests.

Wallach and Kogan&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965" /&gt; administered 5 measures of creativity, each of which resulted in a score for originality and fluency; and 10 measures of general intelligence to 151 5th grade children. These tests were untimed, and given in a game-like manner (aiming to facilitate creativity). Inter-correlations between creativity tests were on average ''r'' = .41. Inter-correlations between intelligence measures were on average ''r'' = .51 with each other. Creativity tests and intelligence measures correlated ''r'' = .09.

== Neuroscience ==
The [[neuroscience]] of creativity looks at the operation of the brain during creative behaviour. It has been addressed&lt;ref name="NeuroPsychiatry"&gt;[http://neurology.med.ohio-state.edu/cognitivelab/CreativityMechanisms.pdf Kenneth M Heilman, MD, Stephen E. Nadeau, MD, and David Q. Beversdorf, MD. "Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms" Neurocase (2003)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319130652/http://neurology.med.ohio-state.edu/cognitivelab/CreativityMechanisms.pdf |date=2009-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the article "Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms." The authors write that "creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected." Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways:
* they have a high level of specialized knowledge,
* they are capable of [[convergent and divergent production|divergent thinking]] mediated by the [[frontal lobe]].
* and they are able to modulate [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[norepinephrine]] in their frontal lobe.

Thus, the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the [[cerebral cortex|cortex]] that is most important for creativity.

This article also explored the links between creativity and sleep, [[mood disorder|mood]] and [[substance dependence|addiction disorders]], and [[depression (mood)|depression]].

In 2005, Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive. Drawing from evidence in brain imaging, drug studies and lesion analysis, she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes, the [[temporal lobe]]s, and [[dopamine]] from the [[limbic system]]. The frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation, and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation. Abnormalities in the frontal lobe (such as depression or anxiety) generally decrease creativity, while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity. High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe, and vice versa. High dopamine levels increase general [[arousal]] and goal directed behaviors and reduce [[latent inhibition]], and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Flaherty AW | year = 2005 | title = Frontotemporal and dopaminergic control of idea generation and creative drive | url = | journal = J Comp Neurol | volume = 493 | issue = 1| pages = 147–53 | pmid = 16254989 | pmc = 2571074 | doi=10.1002/cne.20768}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2015 study on creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks, including those that support associative thinking, along with other [[default mode network]] functions.&lt;ref name=PMID_26003860&gt;{{ cite journal |last1 = Mayseless |first1 = Naama |last2 = Eran |first2 = Ayelet |last3 = Shamay-Tsoory |first3 = Simone G |year = 2015 |title = Generating original ideas: The neural underpinning of originality. |journal = NeuroImage |quote = These results are in line with the dual model of creativity, according to which original ideas are a product of the interaction between a system that generates ideas and a control system that evaluates these ideas. |laysummary = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26003860 |doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.05.030|pmid = 26003860 |pages = 232–9 |volume = 116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Working memory and the cerebellum ===
Vandervert&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert 2003a, 2003b; Vandervert, Schimpf &amp; Liu, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; described how the brain's frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the [[cerebellum]] collaborate to produce creativity and innovation. Vandervert's explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of [[working memory]] (responsible for processing all thought&lt;ref&gt;Miyake &amp; Shah, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;) are adaptively modeled for increased efficiency by the cerebellum.&lt;ref&gt;Schmahmann, 1997, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The cerebellum (consisting of 100 billion neurons, which is more than the entirety of the rest of the brain&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Korbo &amp; Pakkenberg, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;) is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement for efficiency. The cerebellum's adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Cohen, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; where creative and innovative thoughts arise.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, 2003a&lt;/ref&gt; (Apparently, creative insight or the "aha" experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe.&lt;ref&gt;Jung-Beeman, Bowden, Haberman, Frymiare, Arambel-Liu, Greenblatt, Reber &amp; Kounios, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;)

According to Vandervert, the details of creative adaptation begin in "forward" cerebellar models which are anticipatory/exploratory controls for movement and thought. These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control (HMOSAIC).&lt;ref&gt;Imamizu, Kuroda, Miyauchi, Yoshioka &amp; Kawato, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; New, hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture (HMOSAIC) develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time. These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes. Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion,&lt;ref&gt;Schmahmann, 2004,&lt;/ref&gt; Vandervert's approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports, art, music, the design of video games, technology, mathematics, the [[child prodigy]], and thought in general.

Essentially, Vandervert has argued that when a person is confronted with a challenging new situation, visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed (fractionated) by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation. With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations, the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, in press-a&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, he has argued that this is the same process (only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization) that led to the evolution of language in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, 2011, in press-b&lt;/ref&gt; Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this blending process, because it continuously optimizes efficiencies, constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas, music, art, or technology.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert &amp; Vandervert-Weathers, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Prototyping, they argue, not only produces new products, it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself. Further, Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers believe that this repetitive "mental prototyping" or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the self-driven, individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the [[Khan Academy]]. The model proposed by Vandervert has, however, received incisive critique from several authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = J. | year = 2007 | title = On Vandervert et al.

=== REM sleep ===
Creativity involves the forming of associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement. Sleep aids this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature02223 |author1=Wagner U. |author2=Gais S. |author3=Haider H. |author4=Verleger R. |author5=Born J. | year = 2004 | title = Sleep inspires insight | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 427 | issue = 6972| pages = 352–5 | pmid = 14737168 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] rather than [[Non-rapid eye movement sleep|NREM sleep]] appears to be responsible.&lt;ref name="Cai"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0900271106 |author1=Cai D.

It is proposed that REM sleep adds creativity by allowing "neocortical structures to reorganize associative hierarchies, in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes."&lt;ref name="Cai" /&gt;

== Affect ==
Some theories suggest that creativity may be particularly susceptible to affective influence. As noted in [[voting behavior]], the term "affect" in this context can refer to liking or disliking key aspects of the subject in question. This work largely follows from findings in psychology regarding the ways in which affective states are involved in human judgment and decision-making.&lt;ref name=Winkielman2007&gt;{{Citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Positive affect relations ===
According to [[Alice M. Isen|Alice Isen]], positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity:
# Positive affect makes additional cognitive material available for processing, increasing the number of cognitive elements available for association;
# Positive affect leads to defocused attention and a more complex cognitive context, increasing the breadth of those elements that are treated as relevant to the problem;
# Positive affect increases cognitive flexibility, increasing the probability that diverse cognitive elements will in fact become associated. Together, these processes lead positive affect to have a positive influence on creativity.

[[Barbara Fredrickson]] in her [[broaden-and-build]] model suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love broaden a person's available repertoire of cognitions and actions, thus enhancing creativity.

According to these researchers, positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association (attention scope) and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem (cognitive scope).

Various meta-analyses, such as Baas et al. (2008) of 66 studies about creativity and affect support the link between creativity and positive affect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mark A.

== Creativity and artificial intelligence ==
[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s formal [[theory]] of creativity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2006 | title = Developmental Robotics, Optimal Artificial Curiosity, Creativity, Music, and the Fine Arts | url = | journal = Connection Science | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 173–187 | doi=10.1080/09540090600768658| citeseerx = 10.1.1.474.6919 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2010 | title = Formal Theory of Creativity, Fun, and Intrinsic Motivation (1990–2010) | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 230–247 | doi=10.1109/tamd.2010.2056368}}&lt;/ref&gt; postulates that creativity, curiosity, and interestingness are by-products of a simple [[Computational learning theory|computational]] principle for measuring and optimizing learning progress. Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own [[sensory system|sensory]] inputs. The agent can use a [[black box]] optimization method such as [[reinforcement learning]] to learn (through informed trial and error) sequences of actions that maximize the expected sum of its future [[reward system|reward]] signals. There are extrinsic reward signals for achieving externally given goals, such as finding food when hungry. But Schmidhuber's [[Loss function|objective function]] to be maximized also includes an additional, intrinsic term to model "wow-effects." This non-standard term motivates purely creative behavior of the agent even when there are no external goals. A wow-effect is formally defined as follows. As the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs, it keeps improving the predictor or encoder, which can be implemented as an [[artificial neural network]] or some other [[machine learning]] device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time. The improvements can be measured precisely, by computing the difference in computational costs (storage size, number of required synapses, errors, time) needed to encode new observations before and after learning. This difference depends on the encoder's present subjective knowledge, which changes over time, but the theory formally takes this into account. The cost difference measures the strength of the present "wow-effect" due to sudden improvements in [[data compression]] or computational speed. It becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the action selector. The objective function thus motivates the action optimizer to create action sequences causing more wow-effects. Irregular, random data (or noise) do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress, and thus are "boring" by nature (providing no reward). Already known and predictable regularities also are boring. Temporarily interesting are only the initially unknown, novel, regular patterns in both actions and observations. This motivates the agent to perform continual, open-ended, active, creative exploration.

According to Schmidhuber, his objective function explains the activities of scientists, artists, and [[comedian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Video of [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s keynote at the 2011 Winter Intelligence Conference, Oxford: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnbZzcruGu0 Universal AI and Theory of Fun and Creativity.

Youtube, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, [[physicist]]s are motivated to create experiments leading to observations obeying previously unpublished [[physical law]]s permitting better [[data compression]]. Likewise, composers receive intrinsic reward for creating non-arbitrary melodies with unexpected but regular harmonies that permit wow-effects through data compression improvements.
Similarly, a comedian gets intrinsic reward for "inventing a novel joke with an unexpected [[punch line]], related to the beginning of the story in an initially unexpected but quickly learnable way that also allows for better compression of the perceived data."&lt;ref&gt;Kurzweil AI: [http://www.kurzweilai.net/when-creative-machines-overtake-man Transcript] of [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s TEDx talk (2012): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ35zNlyG-o&amp;list=PL194623EBA834DB77&amp;index=11 When creative machines overtake man]&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by psychologist [[J.

While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the [[prefrontal cortex]], schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their ''right'' prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2005.06.016 |pmid=16125369 |url=http://exploration.vanderbilt.edu/news/news_schizotypes.htm |accessdate=2006-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215212520/http://exploration.vanderbilt.edu/news/news_schizotypes.htm |archivedate=2006-02-15 |df= |volume=80 |issue=2–3 |title=Verbal creativity and schizotypal personality in relation to prefrontal hemispheric laterality: A behavioral and near-infrared optical imaging study |year=2005 |journal=Schizophrenia Research |pages=271–282 | last1 = Folley | first1 = Bradley S. | last2 = Park | first2 = Sohee|pmc=2817946 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres, allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate.

Particularly strong links have been identified between creativity and [[mood disorder]]s, particularly [[Bipolar disorder|manic-depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[bipolar disorder]]) and [[Major depressive disorder|depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[Major depressive disorder|unipolar disorder]]). In ''Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament'', [[Kay Redfield Jamison]] summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in [[writer]]s, [[poet]]s, and [[artist]]s. She also explores research that identifies [[mood disorder]]s in such famous writers and artists as [[Ernest Hemingway]] (who shot himself after [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroconvulsive treatment]]), [[Virginia Woolf]] (who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on), composer [[Robert Schumann]] (who died in a mental institution), and even the famed [[Visual arts|visual artist]] [[Michelangelo]]. A different case study suggested for Schumann a difference between bipolar disorder and "creative bipolarity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holm-Hadulla|first=Rainer Matthias|last2=Koutsoukou-Argyraki|first2=Asimina|date=2017|title=Bipolar Disorder and/or Creative Bipolarity: Robert Schumann's Exemplary Psychopathology - Combining Symptomatological and Psychosocial Perspectives with Creativity Research|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/479883|journal=Psychopathology|language=english|volume=50|issue=6|pages=379–388|doi=10.1159/000479883|pmid=29017153|issn=0254-4962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study looking at 300,000 persons with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or unipolar depression, and their relatives, found overrepresentation in creative professions for those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. There was no overall overrepresentation, but overrepresentation for artistic occupations, among those diagnosed with schizophrenia. There was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kyaga | first1 = S. | last2 = Lichtenstein | first2 = P. | last3 = Boman | first3 = M. | last4 = Hultman | first4 = C. | last5 = Långström | first5 = N. | last6 = Landén | first6 = M. | title = Creativity and mental disorder: Family study of 300 000 people with severe mental disorder | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.110.085316 | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 199 | issue = 5 | pages = 373–379 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21653945| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another case study suggested a difference between severe mood disorders and "creative melancholy", pointing out mild and moderate depression may inspire creative achievements while severe depression inhibits and may even destroy creative activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holm-Hadulla|first=Rainer M.|last2=Roussel|first2=Martin|last3=Hofmann|first3=Frank-Hagen|date=2010-12|title=Depression and creativity — The case of the german poet, scientist and statesman J.

Another study involving more than one million people, conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute, reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses. Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, unipolar depression, and substance abuse, and were almost twice as likely as the general population to kill themselves. Dancers and photographers were also more likely to have bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name="bbc health-19959565"&gt;Roberts, Michelle. Creativity 'closely entwined with mental illness'. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19959565. 16 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as a group, those in the creative professions were no more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders than other people, although they were more likely to have a close relative with a disorder, including anorexia and, to some extent, autism, the Journal of Psychiatric Research reports.&lt;ref name="bbc health-19959565" /&gt;

According to psychologist Robert Epstein, PhD, creativity can be obstructed through stress.&lt;ref name="apa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2009/01/creativity.aspx|title=The science of creativity|website=apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creativity and personality ==
Creativity can be expressed in a number of different forms, depending on unique people and environments. A number of different theorists have suggested models of the creative person. One model suggests that there are kinds to produce growth, innovation, speed, etc. These are referred to as the four "Creativity Profiles" that can help achieve such goals.&lt;ref&gt;(DeGraff, Lawrence 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
:(i) ''Incubate'' (Long-term Development)
:(ii) ''Imagine'' (Breakthrough Ideas)
:(iii) ''Improve'' (Incremental Adjustments)
:(iv) ''Invest'' (Short-term Goals)

Research by Dr Mark Batey of the Psychometrics at Work Research Group at [[Manchester Business School]] has suggested that the creative profile can be explained by four primary creativity traits with narrow facets within each

: (i) "Idea Generation" (Fluency, Originality, Incubation and Illumination)
: (ii) "Personality" (Curiosity and Tolerance for Ambiguity)
: (iii) "Motivation" (Intrinsic, Extrinsic and Achievement)
: (iv) "Confidence" (Producing, Sharing and Implementing)

This model was developed in a sample of 1000 working adults using the statistical techniques of Exploratory Factor Analysis followed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis by Structural Equation Modelling.&lt;ref&gt;(Batey &amp; Irwing, 2010) {{cite web |url=http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710161255/http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important aspect of the creativity profiling approach is to account for the tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual, as characterised by the [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] approach, and the evidence that team creativity is founded on diversity and difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nijstad B. A. |author2=De Dreu C. K. | year = 2002 | title = Creativity and Group Innovation | url = | journal = Applied Psychology | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 400–406 | doi = 10.1111/1464-0597.00984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One characteristic of creative people, as measured by some psychologists, is what is called ''divergent production''. ''Divergent production'' is the ability of a person to generate a diverse assortment, yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation.&lt;ref&gt;(Guilford, 1950)&lt;/ref&gt; One way of measuring ''divergent production'' is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking.&lt;ref&gt;(Torrance, 1974, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity, quantity, and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions.

Other researchers of creativity see the difference in creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem solving and developing expertise in the field of their creative expression. Hard working people study the work of people before them and within their current area, become experts in their fields, and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous information in innovative and creative ways. In a study of projects by design students, students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater creativity within their projects.&lt;ref&gt;(Christiaans &amp; Venselaar, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The aspect of motivation within a person's personality may predict creativity levels in the person. Motivation stems from two different sources, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest as a result of personal interest, desires, hopes, goals, etc. Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment, rewards, fame, approval from others, etc. Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases, strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people.&lt;ref&gt;(Amabile, 1996; Prabhu et al., 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

From a personality-traits perspective, there are a number of traits that are associated with creativity in people.&lt;ref&gt;(Feist, 1998, 1999; Prabhu et al., 2008; Zhang &amp; Sternberg, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Creative people tend to be more open to new experiences, are more self-confident, are more ambitious, self-accepting, impulsive, driven, dominant, and hostile, compared to people with less creativity.

From an evolutionary perspective, creativity may be a result of the outcome of years of generating ideas. As ideas are continuously generated, the need to evolve produces a need for new ideas and developments. As a result, people have been creating and developing new, innovative, and creative ideas to build our progress as a society.&lt;ref&gt;(Campbell, 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

In studying exceptionally creative people in history, some common traits in lifestyle and environment are often found. Creative people in history usually had supportive parents, but rigid and non-nurturing. Most had an interest in their field at an early age, and most had a highly supportive and skilled mentor in their field of interest. Often the field they chose was relatively uncharted, allowing for their creativity to be expressed more in a field with less previous information. Most exceptionally creative people devoted almost all of their time and energy into their craft, and after about a decade had a creative breakthrough of fame. Their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard-work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination.&lt;ref&gt;(Gardner, 1993a, Policastro &amp; Gardner, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory of creative people is the ''investment theory of creativity''. This approach suggest that there are many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity. In the ''investment'' sense, a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been overlooked by others. The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea to the point that it is established as a new and creative idea. Just like in the financial world, some investments are worth the buy in, while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected. This ''investment theory of creativity'' views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others, by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way.&lt;ref&gt;(Sternberg &amp; Lubart, 1991, 1995, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Malevolent creativity ==
Malevolent creativity (MC) focuses on the "darker side" of creativity.&lt;ref name="The dark side of creativity"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McLaren | first1 = R. B. | year = 1993 | title = The dark side of creativity | url = | journal = Creat. Res. J. | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 137–144 | doi = 10.1080/10400419309534472 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of creativity is not typically accepted within society and is defined by the intention to cause harm to others through original and innovative means. MC should be distinguished from negative creativity in that negative creativity may unintentionally cause harm to others, whereas MC is explicitly malevolently motivated. MC is often a key contributor to crime and in its most destructive form can even manifest as terrorism. However, MC can also be observed in ordinary day-to-day life as lying, cheating and betrayal.&lt;ref name="Measure Malevolent Creativity 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hao | first1 = N | last2 = Tang | first2 = M | last3 = Yang | first3 = J | last4 = Wang | first4 = Q | last5 = Runco | first5 = MA | year = 2016 | title = A New Tool to Measure Malevolent Creativity: The Malevolent Creativity Behavior Scale | url = | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 682 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00682 | pmid = 27242596 | pmc = 4870273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although everyone shows some levels of MC under certain conditions, those that have a higher propensity towards malevolent creativity have increased tendencies to deceive and manipulate others to their own gain. Although levels of MC appear to dramatically increase when an individual is placed under unfair conditions, personality is also a key predictor in anticipating levels of malevolent thinking. Researches Harris and Reiter-Palmon investigated the role of aggression in levels of MC, in particular levels of implicit aggression and the tendency to employ aggressive actions in response to problem solving.  The personality traits of physical aggression, conscientiousness, emotional intelligence and implicit aggression all seem to be related with MC.&lt;ref name="The dark side of creativity"/&gt; Harris and Reiter-Palmon's research showed that when subjects were presented with a problem that triggered malevolent creativity, participants high in implicit aggression and low in premeditation expressed the largest number of malevolently-themed solutions. When presented with the more benign problem that triggered prosocial motives of helping others and cooperating, those high in implicit aggression, even if they were high in impulsiveness, were far less destructive in their imagined solutions. They concluded premeditation, more than implicit aggression controlled an individual’s expression of malevolent creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = D. J. | last2 = Reiter-Palmon | first2 = R. | year = 2015 | title = Fast and furious: The influence of implicit aggression, premeditation, and provoking situations on malevolent creativity | url = | journal = Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 54–64 | doi = 10.1037/a0038499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current measure for malevolent creativity is the 13 item test Malevolent Creativity Behaviour Scale (MCBS) &lt;ref name="Measure Malevolent Creativity 2016"/&gt;

===Malevolent creativity and crime===
Malevolent creativity has strong links with crime. As creativity requires deviating from the conventional, there is a permanent tension between being creative and producing products that go too far and in some cases to the point of breaking the law. Aggression is a key predictor of malevolent creativity, and studies have also shown that increased levels of aggression also correlates to a higher likelihood of committing crime.&lt;ref&gt;Aggression: A social psychological analysis.

== Creativity across cultures ==
Creativity is viewed differently in different countries.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg RJ 'Introduction' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (2006) (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' pp 1-9. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, cross-cultural research centred on [[Hong Kong]] found that Westerners view creativity more in terms of the individual attributes of a creative person, such as their aesthetic taste, while Chinese people view creativity more in terms of the social influence of creative people e.g. what they can contribute to society.&lt;ref&gt;Niu W (2006) 'Development of Creativity Research in Chinese Societies' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' pp 386-387. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mpofu et al. surveyed 28 African languages and found that 27 had no word which directly translated to 'creativity' (the exception being [[Arabic]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mpofu E et al (2006) 'African Perspectives on Creativity' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 465. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of [[linguistic relativity]], i.e. that language can affect thought, suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for 'creativity' may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages. However, more research would be needed to establish this, and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less (or more) creative; [[Africa]] has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as [[music]], [[art]], and [[storytelling]]. Nevertheless, it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa,&lt;ref&gt;Mpofu E et al (2006) 'African Perspectives on Creativity' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 458. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Preiss DD and Strasser K (2006) 'Creativity in Latin America' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 46. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere, but here again there are cultural differences, even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity. For example, in Scandinavian countries, creativity is seen as an individual attitude which helps in coping with life's challenges,&lt;ref&gt;Smith GJW and Carlsson I (2006) 'Creativity under the Northern Lights' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 202. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Germany, creativity is seen more as a process that can be applied to help solve problems.&lt;ref&gt;Preiser S (2006) 'Creativity Research in German-Speaking Countries' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 175. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In organizations ==
[[File:Training meeting in a ecodesign stainless steel company in brazil.JPG|thumb|right|Training meeting in an eco-design stainless steel company in [[Brazil]]. The leaders among other things wish to cheer and encourage the workers in order to achieve a higher level of creativity.]]

It has been the topic of various research studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent. For any given organization, measures of effectiveness vary, depending upon its mission, environmental context, nature of work, the product or service it produces, and customer demands. Thus, the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself — how it functions, how it is structured, and what it emphasizes.

Amabile&lt;ref name="Amabile98"&gt;(Amabile, 1998; Sullivan and Harper, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; argued that to enhance creativity in business, three components were needed:
* Expertise (technical, procedural and intellectual knowledge),
* Creative thinking skills (how flexibly and imaginatively people approach problems),
* and Motivation (especially [[intrinsic motivation]]).

There are two types of motivation:
* [[Motivation|extrinsic motivation]] – [[Externality|external]] factors, for example [[threat]]s of being fired or money as a reward,
* [[intrinsic motivation]] – comes from inside an individual, satisfaction, enjoyment of work, etc.

Six managerial practices to encourage motivation are:
* Challenge – matching people with the right assignments;
* Freedom – giving people [[autonomy]] choosing means to achieve goals;
* [[Resource]]s – such as time, money, space, etc. There must be balance fit among resources and people;
* Work group features – [[Cultural diversity|diverse]], supportive teams, where members share the excitement, willingness to help, and recognize each other's talents;
* [[Supervisor]]y encouragement – recognitions, cheering, praising;
* Organizational support – value emphasis, information sharing, [[collaboration]].

Nonaka, who examined several successful Japanese companies, similarly saw creativity and knowledge creation as being important to the success of organizations.&lt;ref name="Nonaka91"&gt;(Nonaka, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he emphasized the role that [[tacit knowledge]] has to play in the creative process.

In business, [[originality]] is not enough. The idea must also be appropriate—useful and [[Cause of action|actionable]].&lt;ref&gt;Amabile, T. M. (1998). "How to kill creativity". Harvard Business Review&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siltala, R. 2010. Innovativity and cooperative learning in business life and teaching. University of Turku&lt;/ref&gt; [[Competitive intelligence|Creative competitive intelligence]] is a new solution to solve this problem. According to Reijo Siltala it links creativity to [[innovation]] process and [[competitive intelligence]] to creative workers.

Creativity can be encouraged in people and professionals and in the workplace. It is essential for innovation, and is a factor affecting economic growth and businesses. In 2013, the sociologist Silvia Leal Martín, using the Innova 3DX method, suggested measuring the various parameters that encourage creativity and innovation: corporate culture, work environment, leadership and management, creativity, self-esteem and optimism, locus of control and learning orientation, motivation, and fear.&lt;ref&gt;Leal, S. y Urrea J. "Ingenio y Pasión" (2013), Lid Publishers (Spanish) and Forbes India Magazine http://forbesindia.com/article/ie/new-trends-in-innovation-management/33905/1#ixzz2iiuuDxVq&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, social psychologists, organizational scientists, and management scientists who conduct extensive research on the factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the roles of team composition, team processes, and organizational culture, as well as the mutually reinforcing relationships between them in promoting innovation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodman | first1 = R.

The investigation by Loo (2017) &lt;ref&gt;Loo, S. (2017) Creative Working in the Knowledge Economy. Abingdon, Oxfordshire: Routledge Ltd. {{ISBN|9781138211391}}; {{ISBN|9781315453095}}. https://www.routledge.com/Creative-Working-in-the-Knowledge-Economy/Loo/p/book/9781138211391&lt;/ref&gt; on creative working in the knowledge economy brings together studies of creativity as delineated in this web page. It offers connections with the sections on the ‘”Four C” model’, ‘Theories of creative processes’, ‘Creativity as a subset of intelligence’, ‘Creativity and personality’, and ‘In organisations’ It is the last section that the investigation addresses.

Research studies of the knowledge economy may be classified into three levels: macro, meso and micro. Macro studies refer to investigations at a societal or transnational dimension. Meso studies focus on organisations. Micro investigations centre on the minutiae workings of workers. There is also an interdisciplinary dimension such as research from businesses (e.g. Burton-Jones, 1999; Drucker, 1999), economics (e.g. Cortada, 1998; Reich, 2001; Florida, 2003), education (e.g. Farrell and Fenwick, 2007; Brown, Lauder and Ashton, 2011), human resource management (e.g. Davenport, 2005), knowledge and organizational management (Alvesson, 2004; Defillippi, Arthur and Lindsay, 2006; Orr, Nutley, Russell, Bain, Hacking and Moran, 2016), sociology, psychology, and knowledge economy-related sectors – especially information technology (IT) software (e.g. O’Riain, 2004; Nerland, 2008) and advertising (e.g. Grabher, 2004; Lury, 2004) (Loo, 2017).

Loo (2017) studies how individual workers in the knowledge economy use their creativity and know-how in the advertising and IT software sectors. It examines this phenomenon across three developed countries of England, Japan and Singapore to observe global perspectives. Specifically, the study uses qualitative data from semi-structured interviews of the related professionals in the roles of creative directing and copywriting (in advertising), and systems software developing and software programme managing.

The study offers a conceptual framework (Loo, 2017, p.&amp;nbsp;49) of a two-dimensional matrix of individual and collaborative working styles, and single and multi-contexts. The investigation draws on literature sources from the four disciplines of economics (e.g. Reich, 2001; Quah, 2002), management (e.g. ,Drucker, 1994; Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; von Hippel, 2006), sociology (e.g. Zuboff, 1988; Bell, 1973; Lash and Urry, 1994; Castells, 2000; Knorr Cetina, 2005),  and psychology (e.g. Gardner, 1984; Csikszentmihalyi, 1988; Sternberg, Kaufman and Pretz, 2004). The themes arising from the analysis of knowledge work and creativity literature serve to create a distinct theoretical framework of creative knowledge work.  These workers apply their cognitive abilities, creative personalities and skill sets in the areas of science, technology, or culture industries to invent or discover new possibilities – e.g. a medium, product or service. These work activities may be done individually or collectively. Education, training and ‘encultured environments’ are necessary for the performance of these creative activities. Acts of creativity are viewed as asking new questions over and above those questions asked by an intelligent person, seeking novelty when reviewing a situation (Gardner, 1993), and creating something that is different and novel, i.e. a ‘variation’ on the idea of existing ideas in a domain (Csikszentmihalyi, 1988). This framework is evidenced by the empirical chapters on the micro-workings of creative workers in the two knowledge economy sectors from global perspectives.

This investigation identifies a definition of creative work, three types of work and the necessary conditions for it to occur. These workers use a combination of creative applications including anticipatory imagination, problem-solving, problem seeking, and generating ideas and aesthetic sensibilities. Taking aesthetic sensibilities as an example, for a creative director in the advertising industry, it is a visual imagery whether still or moving via a camera lens, and for a software programmer, it is the innovative technical expertise in which the software is written. There are specific creative applications for each of the sectors such as emotional connection in the advertising sector, and the power of expression and sensitivity in the IT software sector. In addition to the creative applications, creative workers require abilities and aptitudes to carry out their roles. Passion for one’s job is generic. For copywriters, this passion is identified with fun, enjoyment and happiness alongside attributes such as honesty (regarding the product), confidence, and patience in finding the appropriate copy. Knowledge is also required in the disciplines of the humanities (e.g. literature), the creative arts (e.g. painting and music) and technical-related know-how (e.g. mathematics, computer sciences and physical sciences). In the IT software, technical knowledge of computer languages (e.g. C++) is especially significant for programmers whereas the degree of technical expertise may be less for a programme manager, as only knowledge of the relevant language is necessary to understand the issues for communicating with the team of developers and testers.

There are three types of work. One is intra-sectoral (e.g. ‘general sponge’ and ’in tune with the zeitgeist’ [advertising], and ‘power of expression’ and ‘sensitivity’ [IT software]). The second is inter-sectoral (e.g. ‘integration of advertising activities’ [advertising], and ‘autonomous decentralized systems’ [ADS] [IT software]). The third relates to changes in culture/practices in the sectors (e.g. ‘three-dimensional trust’ and ‘green credentials’ [advertising], and ‘collaboration with HEIs and industry’ and ‘ADS system in the Tokyo train operator’ [IT software]).

The necessary conditions for creative work to exist are a supportive environment such as supportive information, communications and electronic technologies (ICET) infrastructure, training, work environment and education.

This investigation has implications for lifelong learning of these workers informally and formally. Teaching institutions need to offer multi-disciplinary knowledge of humanities, arts and sciences and it has impacts on the programme structure, delivery approaches and assessments. At a macro level, governments need to offer a rich diet of cultural activities, outdoor activities and sports fixtures that inform potential creative workers in the areas of video gaming and advertising. This study has implications for work organisations that support and encourage collaborative working alongside individual working, offer opportunities to engage in continuous professional development (formally and informally), and foster an environment, which promotes experiential functioning and supports experimentation.

'''[[Team Composition]]'''

Diversity between team members’ backgrounds and knowledge can increase team creativity by expanding the total collection of unique information that is available to the team and introducing different perspectives that can integrate in novel ways. However, under some conditions, diversity can also decrease team creativity by making it more difficult for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harvey | first1 = S | year = 2013 | title = A different perspective: The multiple effects of deep level diversity on group creativity | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = 5| pages = 822–832 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2013.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paletz | first1 = S.

'''Team Processes'''

Team communication [[norm (social)|norm]]s, such as respecting others’ expertise, paying attention to others’ ideas, expecting information sharing, tolerating disagreements, [[negotiation|negotiating]], remaining open to others’ ideas, learning from others, and building on each other’s ideas, increase team creativity by facilitating the social processes involved with [[brainstorming]] and [[problem solving]]. Through these processes, team members are able to access their collective pool of knowledge, reach shared understandings, identify new ways of understanding problems or tasks, and make new connections between ideas. Engaging in these social processes also promotes positive team [[Affect (psychology)|affect]], which facilitates collective creativity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Organizational culture|'''Organizational Culture''']]

Supportive and motivational environments that create [[psychological safety]] by encouraging risk taking and tolerating mistakes increase team creativity as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Organizations in which [[help-seeking]], [[Helping behavior|help giving]], and [[collaboration]] are rewarded promote innovation by providing opportunities and contexts in which team processes that lead to collective creativity can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hargadon | first1 = A. B. | last2 = Bechky | first2 = B.

==Economic views of creativity==
Economic approaches to creativity have focussed on three aspects — the impact of creativity on economic growth, methods of modelling markets for creativity, and the maximisation of economic creativity (innovation).

In the early 20th century, [[Joseph Schumpeter]] introduced the economic theory of ''[[creative destruction]]'', to describe the way in which old ways of doing things are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new. Some economists (such as [[Paul Romer]]) view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and, consequently, economic growth. Creativity leads to [[capital (economics)|capital]], and creative products are protected by [[intellectual property]] laws.

[[Mark A. Runco]] and Daniel Rubenson have tried to describe a "[[Behavioral economics|psychoeconomic]]" model of creativity.&lt;ref name="RubRunc1992"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0732-118X(92)90021-Q|last=Rubenson|first=Daniel L.|author2=Runco, Mark |authorlink2=Mark A. Runco |title=The psychoeconomic approach to creativity|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|year=1992|volume=10|issue=2|pages=131–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such a model, creativity is the product of endowments and active investments in creativity; the costs and benefits of bringing creative activity to market determine the supply of creativity. Such an approach has been criticised for its view of creativity consumption as always having positive [[utility]], and for the way it analyses the value of future innovations.&lt;ref name="Diamond1992"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0732-118X(92)90023-S|last=Diamond|first=Arthur M.|title=Creativity and Interdisciplinarity: A Response to Rubenson and Runco|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|year=1992|volume=10|issue=2|pages=157–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[creative class]]'' is seen by some to be an important driver of modern economies. In his 2002 book, ''The Rise of the Creative Class'', [[economist]] [[Richard Florida]] popularized the notion that regions with "3 T's of economic development: Technology, Talent and Tolerance" also have high concentrations of [[creative professional]]s and tend to have a higher level of economic development.

==Fostering creativity==
{{Main|Creativity techniques}}

Several different researchers have proposed methods of increasing the creativity of an individual. Such ideas range from the [[Psychology|psychological]]-cognitive, such as [[Alex Faickney Osborn|Osborn]]-[[Sid Parnes|Parnes]] [[Creative_problem-solving|Creative Problem Solving Process]], [[Synectics]], science-based creative thinking, Purdue Creative Thinking Program, and [[Edward de Bono]]'s [[lateral thinking]]; to the highly structured, such as [[TRIZ]] (the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving) and its variant Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving (developed by the Russian scientist [[Genrich Altshuller]]), and Computer-Aided [[Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|morphological analysis]].

Daniel Pink, in his 2005 book ''A Whole New Mind'', repeating arguments posed throughout the 20th century, argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important. In this ''conceptual age'', we will need to foster and encourage ''right-directed thinking'' (representing creativity and emotion) over ''left-directed thinking'' (representing logical, analytical thought). However, this simplification of 'right' versus 'left' brain thinking is not supported by the research data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/lives-the-brain/201004/creativity-the-brain-and-evolution|title=Creativity, the Brain, and Evolution|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nickerson&lt;ref name="Nickerson99handbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nickerson|first=R. S.|title=Handbook of Creativity|year=1999|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|editor=R. J. Sternberg|chapter=Enhancing creativity|editor-link=Robert Sternberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a summary of the various creativity techniques that have been proposed. These include approaches that have been developed by both academia and industry:
# Establishing purpose and intention
# Building basic skills
# Encouraging acquisitions of domain-specific knowledge
# Stimulating and rewarding curiosity and exploration
# Building motivation, especially internal motivation
# Encouraging confidence and a willingness to take risks
# Focusing on mastery and self-competition
# Promoting supportable beliefs about creativity
# Providing opportunities for choice and discovery
# Developing self-management (metacognitive skills)
# Teaching techniques and strategies for facilitating creative performance
# Providing balance

==Creativity and education policies==

Some see the conventional system of [[education|schooling]] as "stifling" of creativity and attempt (particularly in the [[preschool]]/[[kindergarten]] and early school years) to provide a creativity-friendly, rich, imagination-fostering environment for young children.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name="Csik99handbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Csíkszentmihályi|first=Mihály|title=Handbook of Creativity|year=1999|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|editor=R. J. Sternberg|chapter=Implications of a systems perspective for the study of creativity|authorlink=Mihály Csíkszentmihályi|editor-link=Robert Sternberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RobAzzam2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=K.|author2=Azzam, A. M.|title=Why creativity now?|journal=Educational Leadership|year=2009|volume=67|issue=1|pages=22–26|authorlink=Ken Robinson (British author)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have seen this as important because technology is advancing our society at an unprecedented rate and creative problem solving will be needed to cope with these challenges as they arise.&lt;ref name=RobAzzam2009 /&gt; In addition to helping with problem solving, creativity also helps students identify problems where others have failed to do so.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name= Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paris, C., Edwards, N., Sheffield, E., Mutinsky, M., Olexa, T., Reilly, S., &amp; Baer, J. (2006). How early school experiences impact creativity. In J. C. Kaufman &amp; J. Baer (Eds.), Creativity and Reason in Cognitive Development (pp. 333–350). New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; See the Waldorf School as an example of an education program that promotes creative thought.

Promoting intrinsic motivation and problem solving are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students. Students are more creative when they see a task as intrinsically motivating, valued for its own sake.&lt;ref name=Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=RobAzzam2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name="ByrgeHanson2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Byrge|first=C.|author2=Hanson. S.|title=The creative platform: A new paradigm for teaching creativity|journal=Problems of Education in the 21st Century|year=2009|volume=18|pages=33–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Csikszentmihalyi, M. (1993). Evolution and flow. In M. Csikszentmihalyi (Ed.), The evolving self: A psychology for the third millennium (pp. 175–206). New York: Harper Perennial.&lt;/ref&gt; To promote creative thinking, educators need to identify what motivates their students and structure teaching around it. Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Advisory Committee on Creative and Cultural Education (1998). All our futures: Creativity, culture, and education. UK: NACCCE&lt;/ref&gt;

Teaching students to solve problems that do not have well defined answers is another way to foster their creativity. This is accomplished by allowing students to explore problems and redefine them, possibly drawing on knowledge that at first may seem unrelated to the problem in order to solve it.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name= RobAzzam2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ByrgeHanson2009 /&gt; In adults, mentoring individuals is another way to foster their creativiy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The manifesto : a guide to developing a creative career|last=Torrance|first=E. Paul (Ellis Paul)|date=2002|publisher=Ablex Pub|isbn=978-0313011863|location=Westport, Conn.|pages=|oclc=52769638}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the benefits of mentoring creativity apply only to creative contributions considered great in a given field, not to [[Creativity#"Four C" model|everyday creative expression]].&lt;ref name="Form 440–450"/&gt;

===Scotland===
In the [[Education in Scotland|Scottish education system]], creativity is identified as a core skillset for learning, life and work and is defined as “a process which generates ideas that have value to the individual.  It involves looking at familiar things with a fresh eye, examining problems with an open mind, making connections, learning from mistakes and using imagination to explore new possibilities.” [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/practice-exemplars/Creativity%203-18%20curriculum%20review%20(impact%20report)] The need to develop a shared language and understanding of creativity and its role across every aspect of learning, teaching and continuous improvement was identified as a necessary aim [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/learning-resources/Creative%20Learning%20Networks] and a set of four skills is used to allow educators to discuss and develop creativity skills across all subjects and sectors of education – curiosity, open—mindedness, imagination and problem solving. [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/learning-resources/What%20are%20creativity%20skills?] Distinctions are made between creative learning (when learners are using their creativity skills), creative teaching (when educators are using their creativity skills) and creative change (when creativity skills are applied to planning and improvement). [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/documents/creativity/cre24_infographics/cre24-the-big-picture.pdf] Scotland’s national Creative Learning Plan [http://www.creativescotland.com/resources/our-publications/plans-and-strategy-documents/scotlands-creative-learning-plan-2013] supports the development of creativity skills in all learners and of educators’ expertise in developing creativity skills. A range of resources have been created to support and assess this [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/Pages/Search.aspx?k=Creativity%20infographics] including a national review of creativity across learning by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate for Education. [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/practice-exemplars/Creativity%203-18%20curriculum%20review%20(impact%20report)]

===United States===
Creativity has also been identified as one of the key [[21st century skills]] and as one of the  [[Four Cs of 21st century learning]] by educational leaders and theorists in the United States.

'''Disability Studies in Education''' (DSE) is a field of academic study concerned with education research and practice related to [[disability]]. DSE scholars promote an understanding of disability from a [[social model of disability]] perspective to “challenge social, medical, and psychological models of disability as they relate to education".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aera.net/SIG143/DisabilityStudiesinEducationSIG143/tabid/12121/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; A DSE perspective situates disability within social and political context and is concerned with the civil and human rights of students with disabilities, including issues of equity, access, and inclusion in educational settings, curricula, and activities. DSE emerged as a part of the broader, interdisciplinary [[Disability Studies]] movement and as a critique of [[special education]].

==Foundations==

DSE scholarship is based on a social conception of disability that identifies barriers, attitudes, and actions that serve to systematically exclude individuals with disabilities society.  It is a reaction to the dominant [[medical model of disability]] which positions people with disabilities as having limitations outside of the "normal" or typical boundaries that require remediation and intervention. DSE has its origins in sociological theories of [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]], [[social stigma]]&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, E. (1961 ). Asylums: Notes on the management of a spoiled identity. Boston: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Becker, H. (1963). Outsiders: Studies in the sociology of deviance. New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erikson, K. T. (1962). Notes on the sociology of deviance. Social Problems, 9, 307-314&lt;/ref&gt; and [[labeling theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, L.M. (1969). Small, special-purpose residential facilities for the retarded. In R. B. Kugel and W. Wolfensberger (Eds.), Changing patterns in residential services for the mentally retarded (pp. 211-226). Washington, DC: President' s Committee on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mercer, J. R. ( 1965). Social system perspective and clinical perspective: Frames of reference for understanding career patterns of persons labeled as mentally retarded. Social Problems, 13(1), 18-34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mercer, J. R. (1973). Labelling the mentally retarded: Clinical and social system perspectives on mental retardation. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; as social construction.&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan, R., and Taylor, S. J. (1976). The judged, not the judges: An insider's view of mental retardation. American Psychologist, 31(1), 47-52.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1970, there emerged critiques of labeling in special education, now referred to as [[ableism]].&lt;ref&gt;Gabel, S. L. (2005). Disability studies in education: Readings in theory and method (Vol. 3). Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;

The social model of disability positions physical, intellectual, psychological, sensory, and emotional variations as natural and therefore requires societal changes in the response to those variations. The problem therefore resides not within the individual with impairments, but in the attitudes toward and treatment of people with disabilities.  A DSE perspective is grounded in the belief that a collective social response to disability has resulted in systematic inequality, [[marginalization]], discrimination, and oppression. There is also the recognition that disability is both a form of individuation and group identification. Because individual identities are complex and intersect with other identity categories (i.e. race, gender, social class, sexual orientation), there are varied ways that individuals may identify themselves as disabled.

==Issues==

DSE is concerned with critical issues concerning the education of people identified as disabled.  Central questions of concern to DSE scholars are:

;1. What is an appropriate education for students with disabilities?

DSE scholars promote academic activism in that they seek to counter the dominant discourse of the disabled student as deficient and abnormal. They criticize [[special education]] as an inadequate response to disability which seeks to remediate the individual in order for them to fit in with the norm. They promote a [[social justice]] perspective in which the purpose of education is to accept and care for all students.

;2. What counts as research and inquiry?

DSE scholars challenge research methodologies that serves to objectify, marginalize, and oppress disabled people. They promote research that is created by and accountable to disabled people, rather than portraying them as subjects. They recognize the value of interdisciplinary approaches within and outside the educational field and promote interaction among researchers from a variety of disciplinary perspectives.

;3. What is [[inclusion (education)|inclusion]] and who is included?

A DSE perspective foregrounds the interests and voices of disabled students in their education. DSE scholars reject deficit models of disability and assume that all children have the right to equitable, full, and meaningful access to educational opportunities. At the same time, DSE scholars understand that special education ≠ inclusive education ≠ disability studies in education.

Brooks,&lt;ref group="n"&gt;According to Frings and Frings, this is: Margarette W. Brooks, "Influence of temperature on the chirp of the cricket", ''Popular Science Monthly'' 20 (1881), p. 268; citing "W.G.B.", a writer whom Brooks does not further identify. &lt;!-- However, this report does not seem to appear anywhere within vol 20 of this magazine; see https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_20 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; although this paper went unnoticed until after Dolbear's publication.&lt;ref name=frings62/&gt;

Dolbear did not specify the species of cricket which he observed, although subsequent researchers assumed it to be the snowy tree cricket, "''Oecanthus niveus''."&lt;ref name=frings57&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frings |first1=Hubert |last2=Frings |first2=Mable |year=1957 |title=The effects of temperature on chirp-rate of male cone-headed grasshoppers, Neoconocephalus ensiger |journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology |volume=134 |issue=3 |pages=411–425 |doi=10.1002/jez.1401340302 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jez.1401340302/abstract |accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=frings62&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frings |first1=Hubert |last2=Frings |first2=Mable |year=1962 |title=Effects of temperature on the ordinary song of the common meadow grasshopper, Orchelimum vulgare (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae) |journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology |volume=151 |issue=1 |pages=33–51 |doi=10.1002/jez.1401510104 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jez.1401510104/abstract |accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Yes, this really is "Mable", not "Mabel". --&gt;  However, the snowy tree cricket was misidentified as ''O. niveus'' in early reports and the correct scientific name for this species is ''[[Oecanthus fultoni]]''.&lt;ref name=walker62&gt; {{cite journal |last1=Walker |first1=Thomas J. |year=1962 |title=The Taxonomy and Calling Songs of United States Tree Crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllidae: Oecaiithinae).

The chirping of the more common [[field cricket]]s is not as reliably correlated to temperature—their chirping rate varies depending on other factors such as age and mating success. In many cases, though, the Dolbear's formula is a close enough approximation for field crickets, too.

Dolbear expressed the relationship as the following formula which provides a way to estimate the temperature ''T&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;'' in degrees Fahrenheit from the number of chirps per minute ''N&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;'':

&lt;math&gt;T_F = 50 + \left ( \frac{N_{60}-40}{4} \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is accurate to within a degree or so when applied to the chirping of the [[field cricket]].

Counting can be sped up by simplifying the formula and counting the number of chirps produced in 15 seconds (''&lt;math&gt;N_{15}&lt;/math&gt;''):

&lt;math&gt;\,T_F = 40 + N_{15}&lt;/math&gt;

Reformulated to give the temperature in degrees Celsius (°C), it is:

&lt;math&gt;T_C = 10 + \left ( \frac{N_{60}-40}{7} \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

A shortcut method for degrees Celsius is to count the number of chirps in 8 seconds (''&lt;math&gt;N_{8}&lt;/math&gt;'') and add 5 (This is fairly accurate between 5 and 30°C):

&lt;math&gt;\,T_C = 5 + N_{8}&lt;/math&gt;

The above formulae are expressed in terms of integers to make them easier to remember—they are not intended to be exact.

==In popular culture==
This formula was referenced in an episode (Season 3, Episode 2, "[[The Jiminy Conjecture]]") of the American TV sitcom ''[[List of The Big Bang Theory episodes#The Jiminy Conjecture|The Big Bang Theory]]'' (although Sheldon referred to Amos Dolbear as Emile Dolbear and gave the year of publication as 1890).
It is also referenced in two episodes ("[[Highs and Lows (QI episode)|Highs and Lows]]", "[[Jungles (QI episode)|Jungles]]") of the British comedy show [[QI]].

'''Donkey punch''' is a [[slang]] term for the [[Human sexual activity|sexual practice]] of inflicting [[blunt trauma|blunt force trauma]] to the back of the head or lower back of the receiving partner during [[anal sex|anal]] or vaginal sex as an attempt by the penetrating partner to induce involuntary tightening of [[internal anal sphincter|internal]] or [[external anal sphincter]] muscles or vaginal passage of the receiving partner.&lt;ref name="AETC"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tate2007"/&gt; According to Dr. Jeffrey Bahr of [[Medical College of Wisconsin]], there is no reflex in humans that would cause such tensing in response to a blow on the head, although striking a partner on the back of the neck or head could cause severe, even lethal injury.&lt;ref name=savage&gt;{{cite news |title=Donkey See, Donkey Doo |author=Dan Savage |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=93682 |newspaper=The Stranger |date=October 26, 2006 |accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Urban legend ==
Sex columnist [[Dan Savage]] has discussed the alleged practice on several occasions. In 2004, Savage referred to the donkey punch as "a sex act that exists only in the imaginations of adolescent boys,"&lt;ref name="savage2004"&gt;{{cite news |title=No Shit? |author=Dan Savage |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=20179&amp;mode=print |newspaper=The Stranger |date=December 23–29, 2004 |accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding "no one has ever attempted "[[Pirate (sexual slang)|the Pirate]]," just as no one has ever performed a [[Hot Karl (slang)|Hot Karl]], delivered a Donkey Punch, or inserted an Icy Mike. They’re all fictions."&lt;ref name="savage2004"/&gt; Responding to an enquiry from Wikipedia editors, he again discussed the donkey punch urban legend in his "[[Savage Love]]" column in 2006. He wrote, "attempting a Donkey Punch can lead to ... unpleasant outcomes," including "injury, death or incarceration"; he also pointed out that it "doesn't even work." He quoted Jeffrey Bahr, a faculty member at the [[Medical College of Wisconsin]],&lt;ref name=savage/&gt;
{{quote|To the best of my knowledge, there is no definitive reflex in the human neurophysiology that induces involuntary tightening of the anal sphincter after receiving blunt force trauma to the occiput, or back of the head. ... Trauma to any part of the head can have serious ramifications. Pain, intracranial hemorrhage, memory loss, neck injury, and possibly some related sensory deficits in the arms and legs. A strong enough blow to the back of an unsuspecting person's head could result in a vertebral fracture which, I hope most people know, could cause paralysis or even death.}}
Jordan Tate, commenting in ''The Contemporary Dictionary of Sexual Euphemisms'' (2007) on the "almost purely theoretical nature" of the term, claimed,&lt;ref name="Tate2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jordan Tate|title=The Contemporary Dictionary of Sexual Euphemisms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aclMh6SB1ngC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=15 February 2012|date=9 January 2007|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-36298-0|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The donkey punch originated in the late twentieth century sometime after the sexual revolution, when the empowerment of women was threatening the place of men in contemporary society. This shift in gender paradigms left men feeling threatened, and to reassert their authority, they created and popularized these theoretical and violent euphemisms. ... The secondary reward of the donkey punch is the creation, or reinforcement, of the ideal power structure, or solidifying existing gender roles.}}

== Gay sex ==
''The concise new Partridge dictionary of slang and unconventional English'' (2007) defines the term as follows:&lt;ref name="PartridgeDalzell2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eric Partridge|author2=Tom Dalzell|author3=Terry Victor|title=The concise new Partridge dictionary of slang and unconventional English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cCVnlIUTpg4C&amp;pg=PA211|accessdate=10 February 2012|date=1 November 2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-21259-5|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|... during homosexual anal intercourse, a sharp blow given by the active partner to the passive partner's kidneys. The sudden pain from the blow causes a clenching of the buttocks and tightening of the rectal passage, thereby enhancing the pleasure of the penetrating participant. &lt;small&gt;''UK 2005''&lt;/small&gt;}}

== Pornography ==
[[File:Gia Paloma, September 2006.JPG|thumb|Gia Paloma is credited as the first recipient of a donkey punch in a pornographic film]]
The adult film star credited as the first known recipient of a donkey punch is Gia Paloma, who had the act performed on her by [[Alex Sanders (pornographic actor)|Alex Sanders]] in the 2004 film ''Gutter Mouths 30''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.avn.com/porn-stars/Gia-Paloma-263487.html|title = Gia Paloma|publisher = Adult Video News|website = avn.com|accessdate = 8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Donkey Punch (pornographic film)|Donkey Punch]]'', a pornographic film premised around the act, was released by [[JM Productions]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{iafd title|Donkey+Punch|2005|Donkey Punch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film consists of four scenes in which the male actors engage in [[rough sex]] with their female co-stars, punching them repeatedly in the head and body throughout. In response to her experience on the set, performer Alex Divine allegedly stated "''Donkey Punch'' was the most brutal, depressing, scary scene that I have ever done,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.xbiz.com/articles/15635|title = Hardcore Content: 1|last = Cachapero|first = Joanne|publisher = [[XBIZ]]|date = 22 June 2006|website = xbiz.com|accessdate = 8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commented that "I actually stopped the scene while it was being filmed because I was in too much pain."

The viciousness of the film prompted Peter van Aarle of Cyberspace Adult Video Reviews to forego covering any further releases from JM, while Zack Parsons of [[Something Awful]] (which awarded ''Donkey Punch'' a score of -49, where -50 is the worst score possible) wrote that the film was "one of the most morally repugnant pornographic movies I have seen" and "is the sort of movie that the government would cite when trying to arrest pornographers and outlaw pornography."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cavr.com/xxx17944.htm|title = ''Donkey Punch''|publisher = Cyberspace Adult Video Reviews|date = 12 September 2005|website = cavr.com|accessdate = 8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.somethingawful.com/horrors-of-porn/donkey-punch/|title = ''Donkey Punch''|last = Parsons|first = Zach|publisher = [[Something Awful]]|date = 22 June 2006|website = somethingawful.com|accessdate = 8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enron scandal ==
"Donkey punch" was one of several slang terms used by [[Enron]] traders to refer to their [[price gouging]] methods.&lt;ref name="chron"&gt;{{cite news |title=When Enron pushed, utility pushed back |author=Carolyn Said |url=http://www.chron.com/business/enron/article/When-Enron-pushed-utility-pushed-back-1676193.php |newspaper=[[The Houston Chronicle]] |date=June 27, 2004 |accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During investigations into the 2004 [[Enron scandal]] over manipulation of the electricity market in [[California]], recordings of Enron traders were uncovered dating from 2000 and 2001.

{{See also|Sustainable design|Environmental design}}
'''Ecological design''' is defined by [[Sim Van der Ryn]] and Stuart Cowan as "any form of design that minimizes environmentally destructive impacts by integrating itself with living processes."&lt;ref&gt;Van der Ryn S, Cowan S(1996). “Ecological Design”. Island Press, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; Ecological design is an integrative ecologically responsible design discipline. 

It helps connect scattered efforts in [[green architecture]], [[sustainable agriculture]], [[ecological engineering]], [[ecological restoration]] and other fields. The “eco” prefix was used to ninety sciences including [[eco-city]], eco-management, eco-technique, eco-tecture. It was first used by John Button in 1998. The inchoate developing nature of ecological design was referred to the “adding in “of environmental factor to the design process, but later it was focused on the details of eco-design practice such as product system or individual product or industry as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- This reference cannot be found. Replace with something more accessible.  --&gt;Anne-Marie Willis (1991), “An international Eco Design” conference&lt;/ref&gt;
By including life cycle models through energy and materials flow, ecological design was related to the new [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] subject of [[industrial ecology]]. Industrial ecology meant a conceptual tool emulating models derived from natural ecosystem and a frame work for conceptualizing environmental and technical issues.

Living organisms exist in various systems of balanced symbiotic relationships. The ecological movement of the late twentieth-century is based on understanding that disruptions in these relationships has led to serious breakdown of natural [[ecosystems]]. In human history, technological means have resulted in growth of human populations through fire, implements and weapons. This dramatic increase in explosive population contributed the introduction of mechanical energies in machine production and there have been improvements in mechanized agriculture, manufactured chemical fertilizers and general health measures. Although the earlier invention inclined energy adjusting the ecological balance, population growth following the industrial revolution led to abnormal ecological change.&lt;ref&gt;John McHale (1969), “An Ecological Overview”, in The Future of the Future, New York; George Braziller, pp.66-74&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological design issues and the role of designers==
Since the [[Industrial Revolution]], many propositions in the design field were raised with unsustainable design principles. The architect-designer [[Victor Papanek]] suggested that [[industrial design]] has murdered by creating new species of permanent garbage and by choosing materials and processes that pollute the air.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Papanek (1972), “Design for the Real World: Human Ecological and social change”, Chicago: Academy Edition, ix.&lt;/ref&gt; For these issues, [[R. Buckminster Fuller]], who was invited as University Professor at [[Southern Illinois University]] in Carbondale in 1960s, demonstrated how design could play a central role in identifying major world problems between 1965 and 1975. That included following contents:&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Margolin]] (1997), “Design for a Sustainable World”, Design Issues, vol14, 2. pp. 85&lt;/ref&gt;
*Review and analysis of world [[energy resources]]
*Defining more efficient uses of natural resources such as metals
*Integrating machine tools into efficient systems of industrial production
In the 1992 conference, ‘The Agenda 21: The Earth Summit Strategy to Save Our Planet”, a proposition was put forward that our world is on a path of [[energy production]] and [[energy consumption|consumption]] that cannot be sustained. The report drew attention to Individuals and groups around the world who have a set of principles to develop strategies for change that might be effective in world economics and trade policies, and the design professions will play a role in it. Namely, those meant that design profession becomes not what new products to make, but how to reinvent design culture likely to be realized. He noted designers firstly have to realize that design has historically been a dependent, contingent practice rather than one based on necessity. The design theorist, Clive Dilnot noted design becomes once again a means of ordering the world rather than merely of shaping products.&lt;ref&gt;Clive Dilnot (1982), “Design as a Society Significant Activity: An Introduction”, Design studies 3:2. pp.144&lt;/ref&gt; As a broader approach, the conference of ‘Agenda 21: The Earth Summit Strategy to Save Our Planet’ 1992, emphasized that designers should challenge for facing human problems. These problems were mentioned to six themes: quality of life, efficient use of natural resources, protecting the global commons, managing human settlements, the use of chemicals and the management of human industrial waste, and fostering [[sustainable economic growth]] on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Margolin (1988), “Design for a Sustainable World”, Design Issues, vol14,2. pp. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
*1971 [[Ian McHarg]], in his book "Design with Nature", popularized a system of analyzing the layers of a site in order to compile a complete understanding of the qualitative attributes of a place. McHarg gave every qualitative aspect of the site a layer, such as the history, hydrology, topography, vegetation, etc.  This system became the foundation of today's [[Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS), a ubiquitous tool used in the practice of ecological landscape design.
*1978 [[Permaculture]].  Bill Mollison and David Holmgren coin the phrase for a system of designing regenerative human ecosystems.  (Founded in the work of Fukuoka, Yeoman, Smith, etc..
*1994  [[David Orr]], in his book "Earth in Mind: On Education, Environment, and the Human Prospect", compiled a series of essays on "ecolgocial design intelligence" and its power to create healthy, durable, resilient, just, and prosperous communities.
*1994  Canadian biologists [[John Todd (Canadian biologist)|John Todd]] and Nancy Jack Todd, in their book "From Eco-Cities to Living Machines" describe the precepts of ecological design.
*2000 [[Ecosa Institute]] begins offering an [http://ecosa.org/ecological-design-certificate-program/ Ecological Design Certificate], teaching designers to design with nature.
*2004 [[Fritjof Capra]], in his book "The Hidden Connections: A Science for Sustainable Living", wrote this primer on the science of [[living systems]] and considers the application of new thinking by life scientists to our understanding of social organization.
*2004 K. Ausebel compiled compelling personal stories of the world's most innovative ecological designers in "Nature's Operating Instructions."

There are some clothing companies that are using several ecological design methods to change the future of the textile industry into a more environmentally friendly one. Recycling used clothing to minimize the use of resources, using [[biodegradation|biodegradable]] textile materials to reduce the impact on the environment, and using plant dyes instead of poisonous chemicals to improve the appearance of fabric.&lt;ref&gt;Taieb, Amine Hadj et al.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12618">'''Elder financial abuse''' is a type of [[elder abuse]] in which misappropriation of financial resources or abusive use of [[Economic abuse|financial control]], in the context of a relationship where there is an expectation of trust, causes harm to an older person.

The Older Americans Act of 2006 defines elder financial abuse, or financial exploitation, as “the [[fraud]]ulent or otherwise illegal, unauthorized, or improper act or process of an individual, including a caregiver or [[fiduciary]], that uses the resources of an older individual for monetary or personal benefit, profit, or gain, or that results in depriving an older individual of rightful access to, or use of, benefits, resources, belongings, or assets.”&lt;ref&gt;Older Americans Act of 2006, [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:42%20section:1397j%20edition:prelim], retrieved July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===By family or caregivers===

Family members and informal or paid caregivers have special access to seniors and thus are often in a position to inflict financial abuse through [[deception]], [[coercion]], misrepresentation, undue influence, or theft. Common abusive practices include:
* Money or property is used without the senior's permission or taken from them, for example removal from their home and then use of the home by the abuser, or depositing income such as pension or benefit checks
* The senior's signature is forged or [[identity theft|identity is misappropriated]] for financial transactions
* The senior is coerced or influenced to sign over deeds or [[will (law)|wills]], or caused to execute legal documents they do not understand
* The abuser fraudulently obtains a [[power of attorney]] or [[guardianship]]
* Money is borrowed from the senior and never repaid

Family members engaged in financial abuse of the elderly may include spouses, children, or grandchildren. They may engage in the activity because they feel justified, for instance, they are taking what they might later inherit or have a sense of "entitlement" due to a negative personal relationship with the older person, or that it is somehow the price of a promise of lifelong care. Or they may take money or property to prevent other family members from getting the money or for fear that their inheritance may be lost due to cost of treating illnesses. Sometimes, family members take money or property from their elders because of gambling or other financial problems or [[substance abuse]]. (source?)

===Scams and fraud targeting seniors===

Seniors are also often deliberately targeted by scams, fraud, and misleading marketing – often by otherwise legitimate businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Shilling, D. (2008, November/December). "Improving the court system's response to elder abuse," Victimization of the Elderly and Disabled, 11, 49, 51-52, 59, 62-63.&lt;/ref&gt; This may include:
* fraudulent investment or insurance schemes
* fraudulent contracts and unauthorized charges imposed by internet service providers
* worthless "sweepstakes" that elderly persons must pay in order to collect winnings
* fake pharmaceutical or diet/health products
* medical billing scams and unnecessary medical care
* predatory or unnecessary lending, for example reverse mortgages
* charitable giving scams, including pressure to rewrite wills
* [[identity theft]]
* [[lottery scam]]s
* [[Work-at-home scheme|work from home schemes]] or other ways to generate income

A 1996 study by [[AARP]]&lt;ref&gt;AARP. (1996). Telemarketing fraud victimization of older Americans: an AARP survey. Washington, DC: AARP.&lt;/ref&gt; found that while individuals over 50 comprised 35% of the American population, they accounted for 57% of all fraud victims (AARP, 1996). Seniors' level of vulnerability to this type of exploitation varies by the type of scam. For example, the AARP found that lottery fraud victims were more likely to be women over 70 living alone, with lower education, lower income, and less financial literacy, while victims of investment fraud were more likely to be men between the ages of 55 and 62 who were married, with higher incomes and greater financial literacy.
&lt;ref&gt;“Off the Hook: Reducing Participation in Telemarketing Fraud (Washington, DC: 2003), [http://assets.aarp.org/rgcenter/consume/d17812_fraud.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hybrid financial exploitation===

Hybrid Financial Exploitation (HFE) is financial exploitation that co-occurs with [[physical abuse]] and/or [[neglect]]. HFE victims are more likely to be co-habiting with abusive individual, to have fair/poor health, to fear the abusive individual, to perceive abusive individual as caretaker, and to have a longer duration of abuse.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jackson S, Hafemeister T | year = 2012 | title = Pure financial exploitation vs. Hybrid financial exploitation co-occurring with physical abuse and/or neglect of elderly persons | url = | journal = Psychology Of Violence | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 285–296 | doi=10.1037/a0027273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Estimates of size and scope==

Various attempts have been made to estimate the size and scope of the problem. The primary difficulties in estimating the size of the problem are:
* ''Differing descriptions of financial abuse'' – Victims often do not identify as having been a victim of fraud, so researchers generally offer respondents specific examples. The more specific the questions are, the more likely someone is to say they have experienced it – for example, surveys focused on [[identity theft]], [[telemarketing]], "[[Credit card fraud#Unexpected repeat billing|gray charges]]," or [[Securities fraud|investor fraud]] have found much higher rates than general surveys.
* ''Underreporting'' – Studies that rely on government databases or press reports are estimated to be off by factors ranging from five to forty, with 25 being a frequently cited number.&lt;ref&gt;Wasik, J. (2000). The fleecing of America’s elderly. Consumers Digest. March/April.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, because of the [[Social stigma#Current research|stigma]] of victimhood caregivers are more likely to report that their parents have been victimized than the parents are to self-report as victims.
* ''Differences in survey methodology'' – Some surveys ask for losses in the last year, some ask about losses in the last five years, and some ask "have you ever experienced…", and surveys have variously defined seniors as aged 45+, 50+, 60+, and 65+.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9521">'''Electoral integrity''' refers to international standards and global norms governing the appropriate conduct of elections.&lt;ref&gt;Pippa Norris. 2014. Why electoral integrity matters. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

These standards have been endorsed in a series of authoritative conventions, treaties, protocols, and guidelines by agencies of the international community, notably by the decisions of the UN General Assembly, by regional bodies such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ([[OSCE]]), the Organization of American States ([[Organization of American States|OAS]]), and the African Union ([[African Union|AU]]), and by member states in the United Nations. Following endorsement, these standards apply universally to all countries throughout the electoral cycle, including during the pre-electoral period, the campaign, on polling day, and in its aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;John Hardin Young. 2009. International Election Principles: Democracy and the Rule of Law. Chicago: American Bar Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral malpractices==

[[File:William Hogarth 031.jpg|thumbnail|William Hogarth The Polling 1774-1775]]

The contrary notion of 'electoral malpractice' refers to contests violating international standards and global norms. Problems can arise at every stage of the process, from electoral and ballot access laws favoring incumbents to lack of a level playing field in money and media during campaigns to inaccurate voter registers, flawed counts and partial electoral management bodies.

There is nothing novel about problems of flawed or failed elections which suffer from fraud, corruption, or vote-rigging. Indeed, during the 18th and 19th Centuries, such practices were common in countries holding popular contests, including in [[rotten and pocket boroughs]] in Britain and [[machine politics]] in the United States. Concern about malpractices has grown in recent decades, however, along with the spread of elections to almost every state worldwide.

Contemporary campaigns attracting considerable international concern include allegations of irregularities occurring during the [[Russian presidential election, 2012]], problems of violence during and after the [[Kenyan general election, 2007]], and controversies in the [[Cambodian general election, 2013]].

==Origins in international law and human rights==

The foundation of these standards rests on Article 21(3) in the ''Universal Declaration of Human Rights'' (1948). This specifies that "[t]he will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures."

These commitments were further developed in Article 25 of the UN International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR of 1966), namely the need for:

* periodic elections at regular intervals;
* universal suffrage that includes all sectors of society;
* equal suffrage, in the idea of one-person, one-vote;
* the right to stand for public office and contest elections;
* the rights of all eligible electors to vote;
* the use of a secret ballot process;
* genuine elections;
* elections that reflect the free expression of the will of the people.

The ''1990 Copenhagen Document of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe'' (CSCE) made commitments that included free elections at regular intervals; the popular election of all seats in at least one chamber; universal and equal suffrage; the right to establish political parties and their clear separation from the state; campaigning in a free and fair atmosphere; unimpeded access to media; secret ballots, with counting and reporting conducted honestly and the results reported publicly; and the due winners being installed and allowed to serve their full terms.

The ''2002 Venice Commission’s Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters'' spells out in detail what is meant by principles such as the universal, equal, free, secret, and direct suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/CDL-AD(2002)023rev-e.aspx European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission). October 2002. Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters: Guidelines and Explanatory Report. Venice: Venice Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most detailed standards are contained in the practical guidelines for electoral observers published by regional intergovernmental organizations, exemplified by the ''OSCE Election Observation Handbook''.&lt;ref&gt;Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ([[OSCE]]). 2010. Election Observation Handbook, 6th edition. Warsaw: OSCE/ODIHR.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar principles have been adopted in the guidelines developed by the African Union, European Union, and Organization of American States.&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;[http://www.cartercenter.org/des-search/des/Introduction.aspx Carter Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent statement of these norms in the ''UN General Assembly resolution 63/163'' (April 12, 2012): “Strengthening the role of the United Nations in enhancing periodic and genuine elections and the promotion of democratization.” The language in this document reflects and extends a series of similar statements of principle endorsed regularly by the United Nations since 1991. Resolution 63/163 reaffirms that “democracy is a universal value based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political, economic, social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives.” Thus, democratic principles are explicitly endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly, along with a commitment to “the importance of fair, periodic and genuine elections” as the primary mechanism that allows citizens “to express their will.”

This does not imply, however, that the United Nations or the international community endorse any specific institutional design or constitutional mechanisms that can best achieve global norms, leaving this as a matter for national sovereignty. The UN resolution recognizes the responsibility of member states, “for ensuring free and fair elections, free of intimidation, coercion and tampering of vote counts, and that all such acts are sanctioned accordingly.” The United Nations’ role (especially through the Electoral Assistance Division of the Department of Political Affairs and the United Nations Development Programme) is seen as one of providing electoral assistance and support for the promotion of democratization, but only at the specific request of the member state.

==Evidence for electoral integrity and malpractices==

Attempts to document evidence of violations of international standards of electoral integrity can be found in the electoral observer monitoring reports published after each election by regional organizations.&lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt;

Comparative evidence is also available from the expert survey of Perceptions of Electoral Integrity conducted by the [[Electoral Integrity Project]]. This includes the report, part of an annual series, "The year in Elections, 2013" monitoring the quality of 73 presidential and parliamentary elections.  In 2016, Arizona scored the worst in the U.S., with a 53, and Vermont the best, with a 75, on a scale of 100, the [[Arizona Republic]] reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kaila White|title=Arizona the worst for electoral integrity, experts say|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2016/12/28/election-electoral-integrity-arizona-rank-worst/95885790/|accessdate=30 December 2016|work=The Arizona Republic (USA Today)|quote=Those indicators were interpreted into a 100-point scale. Arizona scored a total of 53, while the best state, Vermont, scored 75.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' reported that a score of 58 is around the same as Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Daniel Politi|title=Sorry, North Carolina, But You Don’t Really Qualify as a Democracy Anymore|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/12/23/north_carolina_doesn_t_really_qualify_as_a_democracy_anymore.html|accessdate=31 December 2016|work=Slate|quote=scored 58/100 in the 2016 election, according to the Electoral Integrity Project, a joint effort between Harvard University and the University of Sydney. That places the state alongside the likes of Cuba, Indonesia and Sierra Leone.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[WSJ]] remarked that with a score of 56, Cuba "jails political dissidents, hasn’t transferred power since 1959, unless the 2008 presidential handoff to Raúl Castro from Fidel Castro counts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=North Carolina’s Iron Curtain|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/north-carolinas-iron-curtain-1483056773|accessdate=31 December 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal|quote=Cuba, which jails political dissidents, hasn’t transferred power since 1959, unless the 2008 presidential handoff to Raúl Castro from Fidel Castro counts.

'''Freeset''' is a group of social enterprises focused on creating positive employment opportunities for women affected by [[sex trafficking]] in West Bengal, India. Freeset Bags &amp; Apparel manufactures bags and T-shirts, Freeset Fabrics is a weaving business and Freeset Business Incubator is focused on facilitating the establishment of new freedom businesses.

'''Freeset Bags &amp; Apparel''' is a [[fair trade]] freedom business offering employment to approximately 200 women who were trapped in [[Kolkata]]'s sex trade. Founded by Kerry and Annie Hilton in 2001, Freeset offers women of the [[Sonagacchi]] red-light district of Kolkata the opportunity to leave a profession they never chose.

Making [[jute]] and cotton bags as well as [[organic cotton]] T-shirts, the women of Freeset are empowered to choose a life free from prostitution. All profits from the business are used for the benefit of the women.

When they first start at Freeset, many women struggle to sew or even do simple tasks. It is not uncommon for new trainees to produce bags sewn inside out and upside down. The trauma they have experienced in their lives often makes learning difficult so they easily forget what they have learned.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/voices/20150720&lt;/ref&gt;

The jobs offered by Freeset allow women to experience financial independence and gain better access to both health care and educational opportunities for their children.

Freeset also employs a handful of men.

'''Freeset Business Incubator''' was created in 2011 to expand on the opportunities offered by Freeset Bags &amp; Apparel. This takes the form of nurturing new freedom businesses, providing capacity and expertise to existing freedom businesses and recruiting people to join or start these social businesses focused on freedom. The Freedom Encounter is a 3-week starter course offered by the Incubator to introduce participants to the idea of freedom business and to expose them to the realities and possibilities of running a freedom business.

Freeset Fabrics was the first freedom business begun under the guidance of the Incubator.

'''Freeset Fabrics''' is the first Freeset freedom business to be established in a rural context. It is strategically located in the [[Murshidabad district]] of West Bengal in an impoverished area known to be a source of young women trafficked for sex. The idea behind locating the business in this area is to provide economic opportunities for women who would otherwise be vulnerable to trafficking, thereby reducing their risk of being trafficked.

[[Weaving]] is a traditional skill among the people of the area and this influenced the decision to start a weaving business with an initial focus on making scarves. Training started in late 2014 and the first scarves came off the production line, mid 2015.

People must have good moral character determined as a fact of law in predominately two contexts - (1) state-issued [[licensure]] that allows one to work and practice a regulated profession&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Craddock |first1=Larry |title="Good Moral Character" As A Licensing Standard |website=www.texasbarcle.com |url=http://www.texasbarcle.com/Materials/Events/6394/25228.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (2)  federal government-issued [[United States nationality law|U.S. citizenship]] certificates whereby an immigrant undergoes [[naturalization]] to become a citizen. Many laws create a paradox by placing the burden of proof of good moral character on the applicant while such a proof, but not the law, necessitates that the evaluators assess the beliefs and values of the applicant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cohen |first1=Taya R. |last2=Morse |first2=Lily |title=Moral character: What it is and what it does |journal=Research in Organizational Behavior |date=2014 |volume=34 |pages=43–61 |doi=10.1016/j.riob.2014.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Good moral character is the opposite of [[moral turpitude]], another legal concept in the United States used in similar instances.

==Assessments of good moral character==
Good moral character can be proven through the presence of several positive moral findings, having no-to-minimal negative moral findings, and by the absence of legal violations. Positive evidence of good moral character can include letters of reccomendation, pursuing education, working seven days a week, owning one’s home, attending church every Sunday, marrying one’s high-school sweetheart, having strong ties to one’s nuclear family, coaching little league teams, teaching English above all other languages in one’s home, paying taxes, paying bills on time, and volunteering in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MENDELSON |first1=MARGOT K. |title=Constructing America: Mythmaking in U.S. Immigration Courts |journal=The Yale Law Journal |date=2010 |volume=119 |issue=5 |pages=1012–1058 |jstor=20698316}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one volunteers to help others, they may be considered a better person if something bad, uncontrollable, and unexpected happens to them while they are working. For example, a man who was stung by a bee while mowing the lawn for an elderly neighbor would often be rated as having a better moral character than a similar man who was not stung by a bee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=From incidental harms to moral elevation: The positive effect of experiencing unintentional, uncontrollable, and unavoidable harms on perceived moral character |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |date=1 November 2017 |volume=73 |pages=86–96 |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2017.06.016 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103116306977 |language=en |issn=0022-1031|last1=Schaumberg |first1=Rebecca L. |last2=Mullen |first2=Elizabeth }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative findings of moral character can include having children without being married, not paying taxes, receiving government support, and advocating for racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Billy |first1=Jason |title=Confronting Racists at the Bar: Matthew Hale, Moral Character, and Regulating the Marketplace of Ideas |journal=Harvard Blackletter Law Journal |date=2006 |volume=22 |url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/hblj22&amp;div=5&amp;id=&amp;page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of any negative finding can outweigh several positive findings.

==In immigration law==
Even minor violations of the law can be the sole reason for denying citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seattlepi.com/local/172675_suit10.html One mistake robs man of citizenship&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] describes "good moral character" as an absence of involvement in the following activities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://careers.findlaw.com/firmsite/attachments/LE6_c_checklist_WhatIsGoodMoralCharacter.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127043144/http://careers.findlaw.com/firmsite/attachments/LE6_c_checklist_WhatIsGoodMoralCharacter.pdf |archivedate=2007-11-27 |df= }} What is good moral character?&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1975 survey by Camenisch included responses from 19 state medical board presidents (respondents) wherein they placed eight characteristics of good moral character in order of importance from most-to-least.

Camenisch writes, “The grouping of the eight elements in the order of importance makes it clear that ‘good moral character’ in the minds of the respondents emphatically has more to do with the professional's obligations to a limited number of specific individuals, to his patients, than to the society at large, to the entire population of those needing health care... this second area ... includes such matters as the distribution of health care and the mode and ease of patient access to it. ... this low ranking of societal issues and responsibilities is of special interest in light of the fact that these same respondents, when asked to indicate the major differences between professional and other occupational licensing, gave highest place to ‘the degree of dedication to the public well-being expected of the licensee.’”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Camenisch |first1=PF |title=On the matter of good moral character. |journal=The Linacre Quarterly |date=August 1978 |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=273–83 |pmid=11661606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Just-in-time''' ('''JIT''') '''manufacturing''', also known as '''just-in-time production''' or the [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS), is a methodology aimed primarily at reducing times within production system as well as response times from suppliers and to customers. Its origin and development was in Japan, largely in the 1960s and 1970s and particularly at Toyota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ohno|first1=Taiichi|title=Toyota Production System: Beyond Large-Scale Production|date=1988|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-915299-14-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}{{Disputed inline|The origins of JIT: in the 1960s and 1970s, or in the 1980s as stated by Holweg (2006)?|date=August 2017}}&lt;sup&gt;, &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Shingo"&gt;Shingo, Shigeo. 1985.

Alternative terms for JIT manufacturing have been used. [[Motorola]]'s choice was short-cycle manufacturing (SCM).&lt;ref&gt;Heard, Ed. 1987. Short cycle manufacturing: the route to JIT. ''Target''. 2 (3) (fall) 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;High, W. 1987. Short cycle manufacturing (SCM) implementation: an approach taken at Motorola.

Boca Raton, Fl.: CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, G.H., Jr. 1991. Continuous flow manufacturing. ''Proc. SPIE1496, 10th Annual Symposium on Microlithography''. (March 1, 1991), 239–246.&lt;/ref&gt; and demand-flow manufacturing (DFM), a term handed down from consultant John Constanza at his Institute of Technology in Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;Roebuck, Kevin. 2011. ''Business Process Modeling: High-impact Emerging Technology - What You Need to Know: Definitions, Adoptions, Impact, Benefits, Maturity, Vendors''. Tebbo, p 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Still another alternative was mentioned by Goddard, who said that "Toyota Production System is often mistakenly referred to as the 'Kanban System'", and pointed out that [[kanban]] is but one element of TPS, as well as JIT production.&lt;ref name="Goddard 1986"&gt;Goddard, Walter E. 1986. ''Just-in-Time: Surviving by Breaking Tradition''. Essex Junction, Vt." Oliver Wight Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}

But the wide use of the term ''JIT manufacturing'' throughout the 1980s faded fast in the 1990s, as the new term ''lean manufacturing'' became established&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Womack|first1=James P.|last2=Jones|first2=Daniel T.|last3=Roos|first3=Daniel|title=The Machine That Changed the World: The Story of Lean Production|date=2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781416554523|url=https://books.google.fi/books?id=9NHmNCmDUUoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}&lt;sup&gt;, &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Black|first1=J.

As with JIT, lean manufacturing is deeply rooted in the automotive industry and focuses mostly on repetitive manufacturing situations."}}&lt;/ref&gt; As just one testament to the commonality of the two terms, ''Toyota production system (TPS)'' has been and is widely used as a synonym for both JIT and lean manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;Monden, Yasuhiro, ed. 1986.

==History==
===Evolution in Japan===
The exact reasons for adoption of JIT in Japan are unclear. Plenert offers four reasons, paraphrased here. During Japan's post-World War II rebuilding of industry: 1) Japan's lack of cash made it difficult for industry to finance the big-batch, large inventory production methods common elsewhere. 2) Japan lacked space to build big factories loaded with inventory. 3) The Japanese islands were (and are) lacking in natural resources with which to build products. 4) Japan had high unemployment, which meant that labor efficiency methods were not an obvious pathway to industrial success. Thus the Japanese "leaned out" their processes. "They built smaller factories ... in which the only materials housed in the factory were those on which work was currently being done. In this way, inventory levels were kept low, investment in in-process inventories was at a minimum, and the investment in purchased natural resources was quickly turned around so that additional materials were purchased." Plenart goes on to explain Toyota's key role in developing this lean or JIT production methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Plenert, G. 2007.''Reinventing Lean: Introducing Lean Management into the Supply Chain''. Oxford, U.K.: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Migration to the West===
News about JIT/TPS reached western shores in 1977 in two English-language articles: one referred to the methodology as the "Ohno system", after [[Taiichi Ohno]], who was instrumental in its development within Toyota.&lt;ref&gt;Ashburn, A., 1977. Toyota's "famous Ohno system", ''American Machinist'', July, 120–123.&lt;/ref&gt; The other article, by Toyota authors in an international journal, provided additional details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sugimori|first1=Y.|last2=Kusunoki|first2=K.|last3=Cho|first3=F.|last4=Uchikawa|first4=S.|title=Toyota Production System and Kanban System: Materialization of Just-in-time and Respect-for-human System|journal=2016 Impact Factor 2.325 International Journal of Production Research|date=1977|volume=15|issue=6|pages=553-564|doi=10.1080/00207547708943149|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00207547708943149#aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGFuZGZvbmxpbmUuY29tL2RvaS9wZGYvMTAuMTA4MC8wMDIwNzU0NzcwODk0MzE0OT9uZWVkQWNjZXNzPXRydWVAQEAw|issn=0020-7543}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, those and other publicity were translated into implementations, beginning in 1980 and then quickly multiplying throughout industry in the United States and other developed countries. A seminal 1980 event was a conference in Detroit at Ford World Headquarters co-sponsored by the Repetitive Manufacturing Group (RMG), which had been founded 1979 within the American Production and Inventory Control Society (APICS) to seek advances in manufacturing. The principle speaker, Fujio Cho (later, president of Toyota Motor Corp.), in explaining the Toyota system, stirred up the audience, and led to the RMG's shifting gears from things like automation to JIT/TPS.&lt;ref&gt;Hall. R.W. 2001. The founding of the Association for Manufacturing Excellence. Unpublished summary of Hall's presentation at a meeting of AME's founders on February 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

At least some of audience's stirring had to do with a perceived clash between the new JIT regime and [[manufacturing resource planning]] (MRP II), a computer software-based system of manufacturing planning and control which had become prominent in industry in the 1960s and 1970s. Debates in professional meetings on JIT vs. MRP II were followed by published articles, one of them titled, "The Rise and Fall of Just-in-Time".&lt;ref&gt;Landvater, Darryl. 1984. "The rise and fall of just-in-time". ''Infosystems''. November, p 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Less confrontational was Walt Goddard's, "Kanban Versus MRP II—Which Is Best for You?" in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, W. 1982. "Kanban versus MRP II—which is best for you?" ''Modern Materials Handling''. Nov 5, p 40-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, Goddard had answered his own question with a book advocating JIT.&lt;ref name="Goddard 1986"/&gt; Among the best known of MRP II's advocates was George Plossl, who authored two articles questioning JIT's kanban planning method&lt;ref&gt;Plossl, G.W. 1981. Japanese productivity: myth vs. reality. ''P&amp;IM Review and APICS News'', September, pp 59–62.&lt;/ref&gt; and the "japanning of America".&lt;ref&gt;Plossl, G.W. 1984. The redirection of U.S. manufacturing. ''P&amp;IM Review and APICS News''. November, pp 50–53.&lt;/ref&gt; But, as with Goddard, Plossl later wrote that "JIT is a concept whose time has come".&lt;ref&gt;Plossl. G.W. 1986. "J.I.T. – fad or fact of life?" ''P&amp;IM Review and APICS News'', February 1986, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

JIT/TPS implementations may be found in many case-study articles from the 1980s and beyond. An article in a 1984 issue of ''Inc''. magazine&lt;ref&gt;Walters, C.R. 1984. Why everybody's talking about "just-in-time." Inc. (March 1) 77–90.&lt;/ref&gt; relates how [[Omark Industries]] (chain saws, ammunition, log loaders, etc.) emerged as an extensive JIT implementer under its US home-grown name ZIPS (zero inventory production system). At Omark's mother plant in [[Portland, Oregon]], after the work force had received 40 hours of ZIPS training, they were "turned loose" and things began to happen. A first step was to "arbitrarily eliminate a week's lead time [after which] things ran smoother. 'People asked that we try taking another week's worth out.' After that, ZIPS spread throughout the plant's operations 'like an amoeba.'" The article also notes that Omark's 20 other plants were similarly engaged in ZIPS, beginning with pilot projects. For example, at one of Omark's smaller plants making drill bits in [[Mesabi|Mesabi, Minnesota]], "large-size drill inventory was cut by 92%, productivity increased by 30%, scrap and rework ... dropped 20%, and lead time ... from order to finished product was slashed from three weeks to three days." The ''Inc''. article states that companies using JIT the most extensively include "the Big Four, [[Hewlett-Packard]], Motorola, [[Westinghouse Electric]], [[General Electric]], [[Deere]], and [[Black and Decker]]".

By 1986, a case-study book on JIT in the U.S.&lt;ref name=Sepehri&gt;Sepehri, Mehran. 1986. ''Just-in-Time: Not Just in Japan: Case Studies of American Pioneers in JIT Implementation''. Falls Church, Va.: American Production and Inventory Control Society&lt;/ref&gt; was able to devote a full chapter to ZIPS at Omark, along with two chapters on JIT at several Hewlett-Packard plants, and single chapters for Harley-Davidson, John Deere, IBM-Raleigh, North Carolina, and California-based Apple Computers, a Toyota truck-bed plant, and New United Motor Manufacturing joint venture between Toyota and General Motors.

Two similarly-inclined books emergent in the U.K. in the same years are more international in scope.&lt;ref name="Mortimer"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mortimer |first=J. |year=1986 |title=Just-in-Time: An Executive Briefing |location=Kempston, Bedford, UK |publisher=IFS Ltd. |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the books, with both conceptual articles and case studies, includes three sections on JIT practices: in Japan (e.g., at Toyota, Mazda, and Tokagawa Electric); in Europe (jmg Bostrom, Lucas Electric, Cummins Engine, IBM, 3M, Datasolve Ltd., Renault, Massey-Ferguson); and in the USA and Australia (Repco Manufacturing-Australia, Xerox Computer, and two on Hewlett-Packard). The second book, reporting on what was billed as the First International Conference on just-in-time manufacturing,&lt;ref name="Ingersoll"&gt;Ingersoll Engineers. 1986. ''Just in Time Manufacturing: Proceedings of the First International Conference''. London, UK. April 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; includes case studies in three companies: Repco-Australia, IBM-UK, and 3M-UK. In addition, a day-2 keynote discussed JIT as applied "across all disciplines, ... from accounting and systems to design and production".&lt;ref name="Ingersoll"/&gt;{{rp|J1–J9}}

===Middle era and to the present===
Three more books which include JIT implementations were published in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;Schniederjans, M.J. 1993. ''Topics in Just-in-Time Management''. Needham Heights, Mass.: Allyn &amp; Bacon&lt;/ref&gt; 1995,&lt;ref name=Jasinowski&gt;Jasinowski, Jerry, and Robert Hamrin. 1995. ''Making It in America: Proven Paths to Success from 50 Top Companies''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1996,&lt;ref&gt;Kinni, T.B. 1996. ''America's Best Plants: Industry Week's Guide to World-Class Manufacturing Plants''. New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; which are start-up years of the lean manufacturing/lean management movement that was launched in 1990 with publication of the book, ''The Machine That Changed the World''.&lt;ref name="Womack_Jones_Roos"&gt;Womack, James P., Jones, Daniel T., and Roos, Daniel. 1990. ''The Machine That Changed the World: The Story of Lean Production''. New York: Rawson Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; That one, along with other books, articles, and case studies on lean, were supplanting JIT terminology in the 1990s and beyond. The same period, saw the rise of books and articles with similar concepts and methodologies but with alternative names, including ''cycle time management'',&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;Thomas, P.R. 1991. ''Getting Competitive: Middle Managers and the Cycle Time Ethic''. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; ''time-based competition'',&lt;ref name=Blackburn&gt;Blackburn, Joseph T. 1991. ''Time-based Competition: The Next Battleground in American Manufacturing''. Homewood, Ill.; Business One  Irwin, p 28.&lt;/ref&gt; ''quick-response manufacturing'',&lt;ref&gt;Suri, R. 1998. Quick Response Manufacturing: A Companywide Approach to Reducing Lead Times. Portland, Ore.: Productivity Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  flow,&lt;ref&gt;Hirano, Hiroyuki. and Makota Furuya. 2006. JIT Is Flow: ''Practice and Principles of Lean Manufacturing''. Vancouver, Wash.: PCS Press,&lt;/ref&gt; and ''pull-based production systems''.&lt;ref&gt;Pettersen, Jan-Arne. 2010. "Pull Based Production Systems: Performance, Modeling and Analysis," doctoral thesis. Lulea, Sweden: Lulea University of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is more to JIT than its usual manufacturing-centered explication. Inasmuch as manufacturing ends with order-fulfillment to distributors, retailers, and end users, and also includes remanufacturing, repair, and warranty claims, JIT's concepts and methods have application downstream from manufacturing itself. A 1993 book on "world-class distribution logistics" discusses kanban links from factories onward.&lt;ref&gt;Harmon, R.L. 1993. ''Reinventing the Warehouse: World Class Distribution Logistics.'' New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; And a manufacturer-to-retailer model developed in the U.S. in the 1980s, referred to as ''quick response'',&lt;ref&gt;Lowson, B., R. King, and A. Hunter. 1999. Quick Response – Managing the Supply Chain to Meet Consumer Demand. Chichester, UK: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; has morphed over time to what is called ''fast fashion''.&lt;ref&gt;Hines, T. 2001. "From analogue to digital supply chains: Implications for fashion marketing ," in ''Fashion Marketing: Contemporary Issues''. eds, T. Hines and M. Bruce. Oxford: Butterworth Heinemann, 26–47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hines, T. 2004. Supply Chain Strategies: Customer Driven and Customer Focused. Oxford, UK: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
Sepheri provides a list of methodologies of JIT manufacturing that "are important but not exhaustive":&lt;ref&gt;Sepheri, M., p. 277.{{full citation needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Housekeeping – physical organization and discipline.
* Make it right the first time – elimination of defects.
* Setup reduction – flexible changeover approaches.
* Lot sizes of one – the ultimate lot size and flexibility.
* Uniform plant load – leveling as a control mechanism.
* Balanced flow – organizing flow scheduling throughput.
* Skill diversification – multi-functional workers.
* Control by visibility – communication media for activity.
* Preventive maintenance – flawless running, no defects.
* Fitness for use – producibility, design for process.
* Compact plant layout – product-oriented design.
* Streamlining movements – smoothing materials handling.
* Supplier networks – extensions of the factory.
* Worker involvement – small group improvement activities.
* Cellular manufacturing – production methods for flow.
* Pull system – signal [kanban] replenishment/resupply systems.

==Objectives and benefits==
Objectives and benefits of JIT manufacturing may be stated in two primary ways: first, in specific and quantitative terms, via published case studies; second, general listings and discussion.

A case-study summary from Daman Products in 1999 lists the following benefits: reduced cycle times 97%, setup times 50%, lead times from 4 to 8 weeks to 5 to 10 days, flow distance 90% – achieved via four focused (cellular) factories, pull scheduling, kanban, visual management, and employee empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;Grahovec, D. and Bernie Ducan, Jerry Stevenson, Colin Noone. 1999. How lean focused factories enabled Daman to regain responsiveness and become more agile. ''Target''. 4th quarter, pp 47–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study from NCR (Dundee Scotland) in 1998, a producer of make-to-order automated teller machines, includes some of the same benefits while also focusing on JIT purchasing: In switching to JIT over a weekend in 1998, eliminated buffer inventories, reducing inventory from 47 days to 5 days, flow time from 15 days to 2 days, with 60% of purchased parts arriving JIT and 77% going dock to line, and suppliers reduced from 480 to 165.&lt;ref&gt;Caulkin, Simon. 1990. Britain's best factories. ''Management Today''. November 60–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hewlett-Packard, one of western industry's earliest JIT implementers, provides a set of four case studies from four H-P divisions during the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Alex. Effective just-in-time manufacture at Hewlett-Packard. In {{harvp|Mortimer|1986|pp=123–128}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The four divisions, Greeley, Fort Collins, Computer Systems, and Vancouver, employed some but not all of the same measures. At the time about half of H-P's 52 divisions had adopted JIT.

== Potential risks ==
According to Williams, it becomes necessary to find suppliers that are close by or can supply materials quickly with limited advance notice. When ordering small quantities of materials, suppliers’ minimum order policies may pose a problem, though.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=John T.|title=Pros &amp; Cons of the JIT Inventory System|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/pros-cons-jit-inventory-system-3195.html|publisher=Houston Chronicle|quote=Supply-chain relationships require retooling that involves multiple suppliers, closer locations, or companies that can supply materials with little advance notice. Companies ordering smaller amounts of goods may encounter difficulty meeting minimum orders, requiring a different contract or a way to break up a large order over time or among several smaller manufacturers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employees are at risk of [[precarious work]] when employed by factories that utilize just-in-time and flexible production techniques. A longitudinal study of US workers since 1970 indicates employers seeking to easily adjust their&amp;nbsp;workforce in response to supply and demand&amp;nbsp;conditions respond by creating more nonstandard work arrangements, such as contracting and temporary work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=L.|first=Kalleberg, A.|title=Precarious Work, Insecure Workers: Employment Relations in Transition|url=https://www.academia.edu/2673815/Precarious_work_insecure_workers_employment_relations_in_transition|journal=American Sociological Review|language=en|volume=74|issn=0003-1224|doi=10.1177/000312240907400101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sociolinguistics}}

'''Language planning''' (also known as '''language engineering''') is a deliberate effort to influence the function, structure, or acquisition of [[languages]] or [[dialects|language variety]] within a [[speech community]].&lt;ref name= Kaplan&gt;Kaplan B., Robert, and Richard B. Baldauf Jr. ''Language Planning from Practice to Theory.''  Clevedon: Multilingual Matters ltd., 1997&lt;/ref&gt; It is often associated with [[government]] planning, but is also used by a variety of [[non-governmental organization]]s, such as grass-roots organizations, and individuals. Goals of such planning vary. Better communication through assimilation of a single dominant language can bring economic benefits to minorities but is also perceived to facilitate their political domination.&lt;ref name=Cobarrubias&gt;Cobarrubias, Juan.  "Ethical Issues in Status Planning."  ''Progress in Language Planning: International Perspectives''.  Eds. Juan Cobarrubias and Joshua Fishman.  New York: Mouton Publishers, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the establishment of language regulators, such as formal or informal agencies, committees, societies or academies, to design or develop new structures to meet contemporary needs.&lt;ref&gt;''Language: An Introduction,'' Lehmann, W.P., 1983, Random House&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ideology ==

Four overarching [[language ideology|language ideologies]] motivate decision making in language planning.&lt;ref name=Cobarrubias /&gt;  The first, linguistic assimilation, is the belief that every member of a society, irrespective of their [[First language|native language]], should learn and use the dominant language of the society in which they live.  An example is the [[English-only movement]] of some residents of the [[United States]].

In contrast is the second ideology, linguistic pluralism - the recognition and support of multiple languages within one society.  Examples include the coexistence of [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Romansh language|Romansh]] in [[Switzerland]]; and the shared official status of [[English language|English]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] in [[Singapore]].  The coexistence of many languages may not necessarily arise from a conscious language ideology, but rather related to the relative efficiency in communication of a common language.

The third ideology, vernacularization, denotes the restoration and development of an indigenous language, along with its adoption by the state as an [[official language]].  Examples include [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] in the state of [[Israel]] and [[Quechua language|Quechua]] in [[Peru]].

The final ideology, internationalization, is the adoption of a non-indigenous language as a means of wider communication, as an official language or in a particular domain, such as the use of English in [[India]], Singapore, the [[Philippines]], [[Papua New Guinea]], and [[South Africa]].

==Goals==

Eleven language planning goals have been recognized (Nahir 2003):&lt;ref name=Nahir&gt;Nahir, Moshe. "Language Planning Goals: A Classification." ''Sociolinguistics: The Essential Readings.'' Eds.  Paulston, Christina Bratt and G. Richard Tucker.  Oxford: Blackwell, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
# Language Purification – prescription of usage in order to preserve the "[[linguistic purism|linguistic purity]]" of language, protect language from foreign influences, and guard against language deviation from within
# [[Language revitalization|Language Revival]] – the attempt to restore to common use a language that has few or no surviving native speakers&lt;ref&gt;Linguist Ghil'ad Zuckermann claims that any attempt to revive a no-longer spoken language is likely to end up with a hybrid - see Zuckermann, Ghil'ad, [http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Hybridity_versus_Revivability.pdf "Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns"]. In ''Journal of Language Contact'', Varia 2 (2009), 40-67.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Language reform|Language Reform]] – deliberate change in specific aspects of language, such as [[orthography]], [[spelling]], or [[grammar]], in order to facilitate use
# Language Standardization – the attempt to garner [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] for a regional language or dialect, developing it as the chosen major language, or [[standard language]], of a [[region]]
# Language Spread – the attempt to increase the number of speakers of a language
# Lexical Modernization – word creation or adaptation
# Terminology Unification – development of unified [[terminology|terminologies]], primarily in technical domains
# Stylistic Simplification – simplification of language usage in [[lexicon]], grammar, and style. That includes modifying the use of language in social and formal contexts.
# Interlingual Communication – facilitation of linguistic communication between members of distinct speech communities
# Language Maintenance – preservation of the use of a group's native language as a first or [[second language]] where pressures threaten or cause a decline in the status of the language
# Auxiliary-Code Standardization – standardization of marginal, auxiliary aspects of language, such as signs for the deaf, place names, or rules of [[transliteration]] and [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]

== Types ==
Language planning has been divided into three types:

=== Status planning ===
Status planning is the allocation or reallocation of a language or variety to functional domains within a society, thus affecting the status, or standing, of a language.

==== Language status ====
Language status is a concept distinct from, though intertwined with, language [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] and language function. Strictly speaking, language status is the position or standing of a language vis-à-vis other languages.&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;Edwards, John. "Language, Prestige, and Stigma," in ''Contact Linguistics''. Ed. Hans Goebel. New York: de Gruyter, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; A language garners status according to the fulfillment of four attributes, described in 1968 by two different authors, [[Heinz Kloss]] and [[William Alexander Stewart|William Stewart]]. Both Kloss and Stewart stipulated four qualities of a language that determine its status. Their respective frameworks differ slightly, but they emphasize four common attributes:
# Language origin – whether a given language is indigenous or imported to the speech community
# Degree of standardization – the extent of development of a formal set of norms that define 'correct' usage
# Juridical status
##Sole official language (e.g. French in France and Turkish in Turkey)
##Joint official language (e.g. English and [[Afrikaans]] in [[South Africa]]; French, German, Italian and Romansh in Switzerland)
##Regional official language (e.g. [[Igbo language|Igbo]] in [[Nigeria]]; [[Marathi language|Marathi]] in [[Maharashtra]], India)
##Promoted language – lacks official status on a national or regional level but is promoted and sometimes used by public authorities for specific functions (e.g. [[Spanish people|Spanish]] in [[New Mexico]]; [[West African Pidgin English]] in [[Cameroon]])
##Tolerated language – neither promoted nor proscribed; acknowledged but ignored (e.g. [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]] in the [[United States]] in present day)
##Proscribed language – discouraged by official sanction or restriction (e.g. Galician, Basque and Catalan during [[Francisco Franco]]'s regime in Spain; [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] in [[Greece]]);&lt;ref name=Wardhaugh&gt;Wardhaugh, Ronald. "Planning," in ''An Introduction to Sociolinguistics''. Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; indigenous American languages during the [[American Indian boarding schools|boarding school era]]&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;cite [http://www.sagchip.org/ziibiwing/planyourvisit/pdf/aibscurrguide.pdf Jennifer Jones, Dee Ann Bosworth, Amy Lonetree,  "American Indian Boarding Schools: An Exploration of Global Ethnic &amp; Cultural Cleansing"], Ziibiwing Center of Anishinabe Culture &amp; Lifeways, 2011, accessed 25 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
#Vitality – the ratio, or percent, of users of a language to another variable, like the total population.&lt;ref name=Cobarrubias/&gt; Kloss and Stewart both distinguish six classes of statistical distribution. However, they draw the line between classes at different percentages. According to Kloss, the first class, the highest level of vitality, is demarcated by 90% or more speakers. The five remaining classes in decreasing order are 70–89%, 40–69%, 20–39%, 3–19%, and less than 3%. Stewart defines the six classes are determined by the following percentages of speakers: 75%, 50%, 25%, 10%, 5%, and less than 5%.

Together, origin, degree of standardization, juridical status, and vitality express a language's status.

William Stewart outlines ten functional domains in language planning:&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;Stewart, William A.  "Sociolinguistic Typology of Multilingualism," in ''Readings in the Sociology of Language''.  Ed. Joshua Fishman.  The Hague: Mouton Publishers, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; 
#Official – An official language "function[s] as a legally appropriate language for all politically and culturally representative purposes on a nationwide basis."&lt;ref name=Stewart /&gt;  Often, the official function of a language is specified in a [[constitution]].
#Provincial – A provincial language functions as an official language for a geographic area smaller than a nation, typically a [[province]] or [[region]] (e.g. French in [[Quebec]])&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;Cooper, Robert L.  ''Language Planning and Social Change''.  New York: Cambridge University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Wider communication – A language of wider communication is a language that may be official or provincial, but more importantly, functions as a medium of communication across language boundaries within a nation (e.g. [[Hindi]] in India; [[Swahili language]] in [[East Africa]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#International – An international language functions as a medium of communication across national boundaries (e.g. English, formerly French as a diplomatic and international language)&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Capital – A capital language functions as a prominent language in and around a national [[capital (political)|capital]] (e.g. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and French in [[Brussels]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Group – A group language functions as a conventional language among the members of a single cultural or ethnic group (e.g. Hebrew amongst the [[Jews]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Educational – An educational language functions as a medium of instruction in [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education|secondary]] schools on a regional or national basis ([[Urdu]] in [[West Pakistan]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]] in [[East Pakistan]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#School subject – A school subject language is a language that is taught as a subject in secondary school or [[higher education]] (e.g. [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]] in English-language schools)&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Literary – A literary language functions as a language for [[literature|literary]] or [[scholarly]] purposes (Ancient Greek)&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Religious – A religious language functions as a language for the ritual purposes of a particular religion (e.g. Latin for the [[Latin Rite]] within the [[Roman Catholic Church]]; [[Arabic]] for the reading of the [[Qur'an]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;

Robert Cooper, in reviewing Stewart's list, makes several additions.  First, he creates three sub-types of official functions: statutory, working, and symbolic.&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;  A statutory language is a language that a government has declared official by law. A working language is a language that a government uses as a medium for daily activities, and a symbolic language is a language that is a [[symbol]] of the state. Cooper also adds two functional domains to Stewart's list: mass media and work.

===Corpus planning===
Corpus planning refers to the [[linguistic prescription|prescriptive]] intervention in the forms of a language, whereby planning decisions are made to engineer changes in the structure of the language.&lt;ref name=FergusonG&gt;Ferguson, Gibson. (2006). ''Language Planning and Education.'' Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Corpus planning activities often arise as the result of beliefs about the adequacy of the form of a language to serve desired functions.&lt;ref name=Hornberger&gt;Hornberger, Nancy H. (2006). "Frameworks and Models in Language Policy and Planning", in Thomas Ricento, ''An Introduction to Language Policy'', Wiley-Blackwell, pp 24-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike status planning, which is primarily undertaken by administrators and politicians, corpus planning generally is performed by individuals with greater linguistic expertise.&lt;ref name=FergusonG /&gt; There are three traditionally recognized types of corpus planning: graphization, standardization, and modernization.

====Graphization====
Graphization refers to development, selection and modification of [[writing system|scripts]] and orthographic conventions for a language.&lt;ref name=Liddicoat&gt;Liddicoat, Anthony J. (2005). "Corpus Planning: Syllabus and Materials Development," in Eli Hinkel, ''Handbook of Research in Second Language Teaching and Learning'', Routledge, pp 993-1012.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of writing in a speech community can have lasting sociocultural effects, which include easier transmission of material through generations, communication with larger numbers of people, and a standard against which varieties of spoken language are often compared.&lt;ref name=FergusonC&gt;Ferguson, Charles A. (1968). "Language Development", in Charles A. Ferguson, Thom Huebner (1996), ''Sociolinguistic Perspectives: papers on language in society, 1959-1994'', Oxford University Press US, pp 40-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist [[Charles A. Ferguson]] made two key observations about the results of adopting a writing system. First, the use of writing adds another variety of the language to the community's repertory. Although written language is often viewed as secondary to spoken language, the [[vocabulary]], [[grammar|grammatical structures]] and [[phonology|phonological structures]] of a language often adopt characteristics in the written form that are distinct from the spoken variety. Second, the use of writing often leads to a folk belief that the written language is the 'real' language, and speech is a corruption of it. Written language is viewed as more conservative, while the spoken variety is more susceptible to language change. Isolated relic areas of the spoken language may be less innovative than the written form, or the written language may have been based on a divergent variety of the spoken language.&lt;ref name=FergusonC /&gt;

In establishing a writing system for a language, corpus planners have the option of using an existing system or creating a new one. The [[Ainu people|Ainu]] of [[Japan]] chose to adopt the [[Japanese language]]'s [[katakana]] [[syllabary]] as the writing system for the [[Ainu language]]. Katakana is designed for a language with a basic CV [[syllable structure]], but Ainu contains many CVC syllables that cannot easily be adapted to this syllabary. As a result, Ainu uses a modified katakana system, in which syllable-final [[syllable coda|codas]] are [[consonants]] by a [[subscript]] version of a katakana symbol that begins with the desired consonant.&lt;ref name=Liddicoat /&gt;

An example on a created script includes the development of the [[Armenian alphabet|Armenian script]] in 405 AD by [[Saint Mesrob|St. Mesrop Mashtots]]. Though the script was modeled after the [[Greek alphabet]], the original script distinguished Armenian from the Greek and [[Syriac alphabet]]s of the neighboring peoples.&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt; Similarly, in the early 19th century, [[Sequoyah]] (Cherokee) created an orthography for written [[Cherokee]] in the Southeast of the present-day United States. It uses some Latin characters but also introduces new ones.

====Standardization====
The process of Standardization often involves one variety of a language taking precedence over other social and regional [[dialect]]s of a language.&lt;ref name=Christian&gt;Christian, Donna (1988). "Language Planning: the view from linguistics", in Frederick J. Newmeyer, ''Language: the socio-cultural context'', Cambridge University Press, pp 193-211.&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach, where dialects are mutually intelligible, is to introduce a poly-phonemic written form that is intended to represent all dialects of a language adequately but with no standard spoken form. If one variety of a language is chosen, that variety comes to be understood as supra-dialectal and the 'best' form of the language.&lt;ref name=FergusonC /&gt;

The choice of which language takes precedence has important societal consequences, as it confers privilege upon speakers whose spoken and written dialect conforms closest to the chosen standard.&lt;ref name=Wiley&gt;Wiley, Terrance G. (2003). "Language Planning and Policy," in Sandra McKay, Nancy H. Horberger, ''Sociolinguistics and Language Teaching'', Cambridge University Press, pp 103-147.&lt;/ref&gt; The standard that is chosen as the norm is generally spoken by the most powerful social group within the society, and is imposed upon the less powerful groups as the form to emulate. This often reinforces the dominance of the powerful social group and makes the standard norm necessary for socioeconomic mobility.&lt;ref name=FergusonG /&gt; In practice, standardization generally entails increasing the uniformity of the norm, as well as the [[Codification (linguistics)|codification]] of the norm.&lt;ref name=FergusonC /&gt;

The history of English provides an example of standardization occurring over an extended time period, without formally recognized language planning. The standardization process began when [[William Caxton]] introduced the [[printing press]] in [[England]] in 1476. This was accompanied by the adoption of the south-east [[English Midlands|Midlands]] variety of English, spoken in [[London]], as the print language. Because of the dialect's use for administrative, government, business, and literary purposes, this variety became entrenched as the prestigious variety of English. After the creation of [[grammar]]s and [[dictionaries]] in the 18th century, the rise of print [[Capitalism#As a mode of production|capitalism]], [[industrialization]], [[urbanization]], and [[mass education]] led to the dissemination of this dialect as the standard norm for the English language.

====Modernization====
Modernization is a form of language planning that occurs when a language needs to expand its resources to meet functions. Modernization often occurs when a language undergoes a shift in status, such as when a [[country]] gains [[independence]] from a [[colonialism|colonial power]] or when there is a change in the language [[education policy]].&lt;ref name=Christian /&gt; The most significant force in modernization is the expansion of the [[lexicon]], which allows the language to discuss topics in modern [[semantic domain]]s. Language planners generally focus on creating new lists and [[glossary|glossaries]] to describe new technical terms, but it is also necessary to ensure that the new terms are consistently used by the appropriate sectors within society. While some languages, such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], have experienced rapid lexical expansion to meet the demands of modernization, other languages, such as [[Standard Hindi|Hindi]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], have failed to do so.&lt;ref name=FergusonC /&gt; Rapid lexical expansion is aided by the use of new terms in textbooks and professional publications, as well as frequent use among specialists. Issues of [[linguistic purism]] often play a significant role in lexical expansion, but technical vocabulary can be effective within a language, regardless of whether it comes from the language's own process of [[word formation]] or from extensive [[loanword|borrowing]] from another language.&lt;ref name=FergusonC/&gt; While Hungarian has almost exclusively used language-internal processes to create new lexical items, Japanese has borrowed extensively from English to derive new words as part of its modernization.

=== Acquisition planning ===
Acquisition planning is a type of language planning in which a national, state or local government system aims to influence aspects of language, such as language status, distribution and literacy through education. Acquisition planning can also be used by non-governmental organizations, but it is more commonly associated with government planning.&lt;ref&gt;Liddicoat, Anthony J., and Richard B. Baldauf, Jr., "Language Planning in Local Contexts: Agents, Contexts and Interactions." ''Language Planning in Local Contexts''. Ed. Anthony J. Liddicoat and Richard B. Baldauf, Jr. Clevedon: Multilingual Matters Ltd., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently, acquisition planning is integrated into a larger language planning process in which the statuses of languages are evaluated, corpuses are revised and the changes are finally introduced to society on a national, state or local level through education systems, ranging from primary schools to universities.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Charles A. "Sociolinguistic Settings of Language Planning." ''Language Planning Processes''. Ed. Rubin, Joan, Björn H. Jernudd, Jyotirindra Das Gupta, Joshua A. Fishman and Charles A. Ferguson. The Hague: Mouton Publishers, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; This process of change can entail a variety of modifications, such as an alteration in student textbook formatting, a change in methods of teaching an official language or the development of a [[multilingualism|bilingual]] language program, only to name a few. For example, if a government decides to raise the status level of a certain language or change its level of prestige, it can establish a law that requires teachers to teach only in this language or that textbooks are written using only this language's script. This, in turn, would support the elevation of the language's status or could increase its prestige. In this way, acquisition planning is often used to promote [[language revitalization]], which can change a language's status or reverse a [[language shift]], or to promote linguistic purism.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Charles A. "Language Planning Processes"''Language Planning Processes''. Ed. Rubin, Joan, Björn H. Jernudd, Jyotirindra Das Gupta, Joshua A. Fishman and Charles A. Ferguson. The Hague: Mouton Publishers, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; In a case where a government revises a corpus, new dictionaries and educational materials will need to be revised in schools in order to maintain effective language acquisition.

====The education sector====
The education [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]] or education sector of government is typically in charge of making national [[language acquisition]] decisions based on state and local evaluation reports. The responsibilities of education sectors vary by country; [[Robert B. Kaplan]] and Richard B. Baldauf describe the sectors' six principal goals:&lt;ref name= Kaplan /&gt;

# To decide what languages should be taught within the [[curriculum]].
# To determine the amount and quality of [[teacher training]].
# To involve local [[communities]].
# To determine what materials will be used and how they will be incorporated into [[syllabi]].
# To establish a local and state [[Educational assessment|assessment]] system to monitor progress.
# To determine financial [[cost]]s.

====Problems====
Although acquisition planning can be useful to governments, there are several problems that must be considered.&lt;ref name= Thorburn&gt;Thorburn, Thomas. "Cost-Benefit Analysis in Language Planning." ''Can Language Be Planned?'' Ed. Rubin, Joan, and Björn H. Jernudd. Hawaii: The University Press of Hawaii, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Even with a solid evaluation and assessment system, the effects of planning methods can never be certain; governments must consider the effects on other aspects of state planning, such as economic and political planning. Some proposed acquisition changes could also be too drastic or instituted too suddenly without proper planning and organization. Acquisition planning can also be financially draining, so adequate planning and awareness of financial resources is essential. It is important therefore that government goals, such as those described above, be organized and planned carefully.&lt;ref name= Thorburn /&gt;

====Multilingualism====
There is also a growing concern over the treatment of [[multilingualism]] in education, especially in many countries that were once colonized.&lt;ref&gt;Mansor, Sabiha. ''Language Planning in Higher Education''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Deciding on which language of instruction would be most beneficial to effective communication on the local and state level is a task requiring thoughtful planning and is surrounded by debate. Some states prefer instruction only in the official language, but some aim to foster linguistic and thus social diversity by encouraging teaching in several [[first language|(native) languages]]. One reason some states prefer a single language of instruction is that it supports national unity and homogeneity.&lt;ref name= Fishman&gt;Fishman, Joshua A. "The Impact of Nationalism on Language Planning," ''Can Language Be Planned?'' Ed. Rubin, Joan, and Björn H. Jernudd. Hawaii: The University Press of Hawaii, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Some states prefer incorporating different languages in order to help students learn better by giving them diverse perspectives.

====Non-governmental organizations====
In addition to the education sector, there are non-governmental sectors or organizations that have a significant effect on language acquisition, such as the [[Académie française]] of France or the [[Real Academia Española]] of Spain.&lt;ref name= Kaplan /&gt; These organizations often create their own dictionaries and grammar books, thus affecting the materials which students are exposed to in schools. Although these organizations do not hold official power, they influence government planning decisions, such as with educational materials, affecting acquisition.&lt;ref name= Kaplan /&gt;

====Ireland====
Before the partition of [[Ireland]], a movement began which aimed at the restoration of [[Irish language|Irish]], as the nation's primary language, based on a widespread sentiment for Irish nationalism and cultural identity.&lt;ref name= Macnamara&gt;Macnamara, John. "Successes and Failures in the Movement for the Restoration of Irish," ''Can Language Be Planned?'' Ed. Rubin, Joan, and Björn H. Jernudd. Hawaii: The University Press of Hawaii, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; During and after colonisation, Irish had competed with English and [[Scots language|Scots]];  the movement to restore the language gained momentum after the [[Irish War of Independence]]. The [[Conradh na Gaeilge|Gaelic League]] was created to promote the acquisition of Irish in schools, thus "de-Anglicizing" Ireland.&lt;ref name= Macnamara /&gt; Immediately after Ireland gained independence in 1922, the League declared that Irish must be the language of instruction for at least one hour in primary schools nationwide. Irish-speaking teachers were recruited, and preparatory colleges were established to train new ones.

The program implementation was mostly left to the individual schools, which did not consistently carry it out. Additionally, educating a generation is a long process, for which the League was not prepared. There was no consensus as to how the Irish language should be reinstituted; the League and schools did not develop a system assessment plan to monitor progress. As a result, the movement lost strength, and the number of native Irish speakers has been in steady decline.&lt;ref&gt;Mac Giolla Chriost, Diarmait. "Micro-level Language Planning in Ireland." ''Language Planning in Local Contexts''  Ed. Anthony J. Liddicoat and Richard B. Baldauf, Jr. Clevedon: Multilingual Matters Ltd., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case study: Quechua in Peru ==

=== Status planning ===
[[Peru]]'s history of language planning begins in the 16th century with Spanish [[colonization]].  When the Spanish first arrived in Peru, [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] served as a language of wider communication, a lingua franca, between Spaniards and Peruvian natives. As the years passed, Spaniards asserted the superiority of the Spanish language; as a result, Spanish gained prestige, taking over as a language of wider communication and the dominant language of Peru.&lt;ref name= CoronelM&gt;Coronel-Molina, Serafin M. "Functional Domains of the Quechua Language in Peru: Issues of Status Planning." University of Pennsylvania&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1975, under the leadership of President [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]], the revolutionary government of Peru declared Quechua an official language of the Peruvian state, "coequal with Spanish."&lt;ref name=Hornberger2&gt;Hornberger, Nancy and Kendell A. King. "Authenticity and Unification in Quechua Language Planning." University of Pennsylvania: 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, the law was reversed.&lt;ref name=CoronelM /&gt; Peru's 1979 [[constitution]] declares Spanish the only official language of the state; Quechua and Aymara are relegated to "official use zones," equivalent to Stewart's provincial function described above. Quechua has officially remained a provincial language since 1979.  Today, Quechua also serves a limited international function throughout [[South America]] in [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], and [[Ecuador]]; communities of Quechua speakers outside Peru enable communication in Quechua across borders. Still, because of Quechua's low status, Spanish is almost always used as the lingua franca instead. Recently, Quechua has also gained ground in the academic world, both as a school subject and a topic of literary interest.

=== Corpus planning ===
The three main types of corpus planning are all evident in the development of Quechua languages in Peru since the colonial era. Graphization has been in process since the arrival of the Spanish in the region, when the Spanish imperialists attempted to describe the exotic sounds of the language to Europeans.&lt;ref name= Coronel&gt;Coronel-Molina, Serafin M. (1996). "Corpus Planning for the Southern Peruvian Quechua Language." ''Working Papers in Educational Linguistics,'' 12 (2), pp 1-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Quechua was made an official language in Peru in 1975, the introduction of the language into the education and government domains made it essential to have a standard written language.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt;  The task of adopting a writing system proved to be a point of contention among Peruvian linguists. Although most agreed to use the [[Latin alphabet]], linguists disagreed about how to represent the phonological system of Quechua, particularly in regards to the vowel system. Representatives from the [[Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua|Peruvian Academy of the Quechua language]] and the [[SIL International|Summer Institute of Linguistics]] wanted to represent [[allophone]]s of the [[vowel]]s /i/ and /u/ with separate letters &lt;e&gt; and &lt;o&gt;, which creates an apparent five-vowel system. They argued that this makes the language easier to learn for people who are already familiar with written Spanish. However, other Peruvian linguists argued that a three-vowel system was more faithful to the [[phonology]] of Quechua. After several years of debate and disagreement, in 1985 Peruvian linguists proposed the Pan-Quechua alphabet as an accurate representation of the language, and this was adopted in [[intercultural bilingual education]] programs and textbooks. However, the Peruvian Academy and the SIL both refused to adopt it and continued to propose new alphabets, leaving the issue unsettled.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt; For more information, see [[Quechua languages#Writing system|Quechua writing system]] and [[Quechuan and Aymaran spelling shift]]. Another of the primary issues disagreements was about how to reflect the phonological differences apparent in different dialects of Quechua. For example, some distinct dialects utilize [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] and [[glottalization|glottalized]] versions of the [[voiceless uvular plosive|voiceless uvular stop /q/]], while others do not and some language planners found it important to reflect these dialectal differences.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt;

The search for a unified alphabet reflects the process of standardization. Unlike other cases of standardization, in Quechua this has been applied only to the written language, not to the spoken language, and no attempt was made to change the spoken language of native speakers, which varied by regions. Rather, standardization was required in order to create a uniform writing system to provide education to Quechua speakers in their native language.

Language planners in Peru have proposed several varieties to serve as the supradialectal spoken norm. Some saw [[Qusqu-Qullaw]] as the natural choice for a standard norm, as it is recognized to be the variety closest to that spoken by the Incas. Others argued that [[Ayacucho Quechua]] is a better option, as the language is more conservative and similar to the proto-language, while Qusqu-Qullaw has been influenced by contact with the [[Aymara language]].

[[Rodolfo Cerrón-Palomino]] proposed a standard literary norm, [[Southern Quechua]] that combines features of both these dialects. This norm has been accepted by many institutions in Peru.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt;

Lexical modernization has also been critical to the development of Quechua. Language planners have attempted to create new Quechua words primarily through Quechua morphemes, which are combined in new ways to give new meanings. In general, loanwords from other languages are considered only when there are no possibilities to develop the word through existing Quechua structures. If loanwords are adopted into the language, linguists attempt to phonologically adapt the word to match typical Quechua pronunciation norms.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt;

=== Acquisition planning ===
Since Quechua is no longer an official language of Peru, Quechua literacy is not consistently encouraged in schools.&lt;ref name= Hornberger3&gt;Hornberger, Nancy "Quechua Literacy and Empowerment." ''Indigenous Literacies in the Americas'' Ed. Hornberger, Nancy. New York: Mouton de Gruyter, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Peru's education system is instead primarily based on Spanish, the nation's official language. Despite its low prestige, Quechua is still spoken by millions of indigenous Peruvians, a large portion of whom are bilingual in Quechua and Spanish. There is a desire to preserve the uniqueness of Quechua as a language with its own attributes and representations of culture. Some argue that promoting a diverse literacy program gives students diverse perspectives on life, which could only enhance their educational experience.&lt;ref name= Hornberger3 /&gt; Before 1975, Peru had bilingual education programs, but Quechua was not taught as a subject in primary and secondary schools.  After the 1975 education reform, Quechua and Spanish both had standing in bilingual programs, but only in restricted speech communities. These experimental programs were then canceled due to a change in government planning, but again reinstated in 1996. Even with national [[intercultural bilingual education]] programs, teachers at local schools and members of the community often prefer using Spanish, destabilizing support for bilingual education.&lt;ref name= CoronelM /&gt; This underscores the importance of community support as a goal for the education sector as mentioned earlier. Some believe that due to Spanish's higher national prestige, it is more socially and economically beneficial to learn and speak Spanish. It is debatable whether these education programs will benefit education or raise the status of Quechua.&lt;ref name= CoronelM /&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Locus amoenus''''' ([[Latin]] for "pleasant place") is a [[literary topos]] involving an [[utopia|idealized place]] of safety or comfort. A ''locus amoenus'' is usually a beautiful, shady lawn or open woodland, or a group of idyllic islands, sometimes with connotations of [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] or [[Elysium]].&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Russell, ''A History of Heaven'' (1998) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernst Robert Curtius]] wrote the concept's definitive formulation in his ''European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages'' (1953).&lt;ref&gt;E. R. Curtius, ''European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages'' (1953) p. 183-202&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[File:Maerten Ryckaert - Rocky Pastoral Landscape - WGA20594.jpg|thumb|Maerten Ryckaert, ''Rocky Pastoral Landscape'']]
A ''locus amoenus'' will have three basic elements: trees, grass, and water. Often, the garden will be in a remote place and function as a landscape of the mind. It can also be used to highlight the differences between urban and rural life or be a place of refuge from the processes of time and mortality. 

In some works, such gardens also have overtones of the regenerative powers of [[human sexuality]]&lt;ref&gt;For more information, see [https://archive.org/details/paradicesonlymap00osma   Evett, David. "Paradice's Only Map": The "Topos" of the "Locus Amoenus" and the Structure of Marvell's "Upon Appleton House." PMLA. 85.3(1970):504-513.]&lt;/ref&gt; marked out by flowers, springtime, and goddesses of love and fertility.&lt;ref&gt;W. Shullenberger, ''Lady in the Labyrinth'' (2008) p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Classical===

The literary use of this type of setting goes back, in Western literature at least, to [[Homer]],&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Russell, ''A History of Heaven'' (1998) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; and it became a staple of the [[pastoral]] works of poets such as [[Theocritus]] and [[Virgil]]. [[Horace]] (''[[Ars poetica]]'', 17) and the commentators on Virgil, such as [[Servius]], recognize that descriptions of ''loci amoeni'' have become a rhetorical commonplace.

In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', the function of the ''locus amoenus'' is inverted, to form the "locus terribilis". Instead of offering a respite from dangers, it is itself usually the scene of violent encounters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hawaii.edu/~zuern/demo/explication/loc/locus1.html  John David Zuern, "Locus Amoenus"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval===
The Middle Ages merged the classical ''locus amoenus'' with biblical imagery, as from the [[Song of Songs]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Shullenberger, ''Lady in the Labyrinth'' (2008) p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matthew of Vendôme]] provided multiple accounts of how to describe the ''locus amoenus'',&lt;ref&gt;H. Pleij, ''Dreaming of Cockaigne'' (2013) p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Dante]] drew on the [[Literary topos|commonplace]] for his description of the Earthly Paradise: "Here spring is endless, here all fruits are."&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Purgatory'' (1971) p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
[[File:Deverell Walter Howard A Scene from As You Like It.jpg|thumb|Characters in the Forest of Arden in Shakespeare's ''As You Like It'']]
The ''locus amoenus'' was a popular theme in the works of such Renaissance figures as [[Ariosto]] and [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Shullenberger, ''Lady in the Labyrinth'' (2008) p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shakespeare]] made good use of the ''locus amoenus'' in his long poem ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;P. Cheney, ''Shakespeare, National Poet-Playwright'' (2004) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; The trope also fed into his construction, in many plays, of what [[Northrop Frye]] has called the Shakespearean "green world" – a space that lies outside of city limits, a [[Liminality|liminal]] space where erotic passions can be freely explored, away from civilization and the social order – such as the Forest of Arden in ''[[As You Like It]]''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Shurbanov, ''Shakespeare's Lyricized Drama'' (2010) p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; A mysterious and dark, feminine place, as opposed to the rigid masculine civil structure, the green world can also be found featured in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''  and ''[[Titus Andronicus]]''.{{fact|date=September 2011}}

===Modern===
In the 20th century the ''locus amoenus'' appears in the work of [[T. S. Eliot]], as in the Rose Garden of ''[[Burnt Norton]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Northrop Frye]], ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (1973) p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]]&lt;ref&gt;A. Neset, ''Arcadian Waters and Wanton Seas'' (2009) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lothlórien]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shippey, ''J. R. R. Tolkien'' (2001) p. 196-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sinister doubles==
The [[Splitting (psychology)|split-off]] obverse of the ''locus amoenus'' is the apparently delectable but in fact treacherous garden, often linked to a malign sexuality, as in [[Circe]]'s palace or the Bower of Bliss in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[Faerie Queene]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (1971) p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2813">'''Logical determinism''' is the view that a proposition about the future is either necessarily true, or its negation is necessarily true.  The argument for this is as follows. By [[excluded middle]], the future tense proposition (‘There will be a sea-battle tomorrow’) is either true now, or its negation is true. But what makes it (or its negation true) is the present existence of a [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]] – a [[truthmaker]].&lt;ref&gt;Buckner and Zupko, ''Duns Scotus on Time and Existence'': The Questions on Aristotle's 'De interpretatione', translated with Introduction and Commentary by Edward Buckner and Jack Zupko, Washington, DC: Catholic University of America Press, 2014, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt;  If so, then the future is determined in the sense that the way things are now – namely the state of affairs that makes ‘There will be a sea-battle tomorrow’ or its negation true  – determines the way that things will be. Furthermore, if the past is necessary, in the sense that a state of affairs that existed yesterday cannot be altered, then the state of affairs that made the proposition ‘There will be a sea-battle tomorrow’ true cannot be changed, and so the proposition or its negation is necessarily true, and it is either necessarily the case that there will be a sea-battle tomorrow, or necessarily ''not'' the case.  

The term ‘logical determinism’ (''Logischer Determinismus'') was introduced by [[Moritz Schlick]].&lt;ref&gt;(Schlick 1979 p. 202), cited in Woleński 1996&lt;/ref&gt; 

Logical determinism seems to present a problem for the conception of [[free will]] which requires that different courses of action are possible, for the sea-battle argument suggests that only one course is possible, because necessary. In trying to resolve the problem, the 13th century philosopher [[Duns Scotus]] argued in an early work that a future proposition can be understood in two ways: either as signifying something in reality that makes something be true in the future, or simply as signifying that something will be the case. The second sense is weaker in that it does not commit us to any ''present'' state of affairs that makes the future proposition true, only a ''future'' state of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Buckner and Zupko, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8962">'''Mesures usuelles''' ({{IPA-fr|məzyʁ yzɥɛl}}, ''customary measurements'') were a system of [[measurement]] introduced by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]] in 1812 to act as compromise between the [[SI|metric system]] and traditional measurements. The system was restricted to use in the retail industry and continued in use until 1839.

==Rationale behind the new system==
[[File:Napoleon Groot.jpg|150px|thumb|left|The ''ordinary measures'' were introduced by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]] in 1812]]
In the five years immediately before the [[French First Republic]] introduced the [[metric system]], every effort was made to make the citizens aware of the upcoming changes and to prepare them for it.&lt;ref name="Alder"/&gt; The administration distributed tens of thousands of educational pamphlets, private enterprise produced educational games, guides, almanacs and conversion aids, and metre standards were built into the walls of prominent buildings around Paris.&lt;ref name="Alder"/&gt; The introduction was phased by district over the next few years, with Paris being the first district to change. The government also realised that the people would need metre rulers, but they had only provided 25,000 of the 500,000 rulers needed in Paris as late as one month after the metre became the sole legal unit of measure.&lt;ref name="Alder"&gt;{{cite book |title = The Measure of all Things - The Seven-Year-Odyssey that Transformed the World |last= Alder |first= Ken |year= 2002 |publisher= Abacus |location= London |isbn=0-349-11507-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; To compensate, the government introduced incentives for the mass-production of rulers. Paris police reported widespread flouting of the requirement for merchants to use only the metric system.&lt;ref name="Alder"/&gt; Where the new system was in use, it was abused, with shopkeepers taking the opportunity to round prices up and to give smaller measures.&lt;ref name="Alder"/&gt;

[[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]], the French Emperor, disliked the inconvenience of surrendering the high [[factorization|factorability]] of traditional measures in the name of [[decimal]]isation, and recognized the difficulty of getting it accepted by the populace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

However, all government, legal and similar works still had to use the metric system and the metric system continued to be taught at all levels of education.&lt;ref name=historique&gt;{{cite web

The [[prototype]]s of the metric unit, the [[kilogram]] and the [[metre]], enabled an immediate standardization of measurement over the whole country,  replacing the varying legal measures in different parts of the country, and even more across the whole of Europe. The new ''livre'' (known as the ''livre métrique'') was defined as five hundred  [[gram]]s, and the new ''toise'' (''toise métrique'') was defined as two [[metre]]s. Products could be sold in shops under the old names and with the old relationships to one another, but with slightly different absolute sizes. This series of measurements was called ''mesures usuelles''.

Napoleon's decree was revoked during the reign of [[Louis Philippe]] by the ''loi du 4 juillet 1837'' (law of 4 July 1837). This took effect on 1 January 1840, and reinstated the original metric system, thus bringing the system of ''mesures usuelles'' to an end.&lt;ref name=historique/&gt;

==Permitted units==
The law authorised the following units of measure:&lt;ref name=H&amp;H&gt;{{cite web

* {{anchor|pied}} The ''[[toise]]'' (fathom) was defined as two metres and was divided into 6 ''pieds'', or "feet" and 72 ''pouces'' (inches). The ''pouce'' was divided into 12 ''lignes'', or (lines). The ''pied'' and ''pouce'', at approximately 333.3&amp;nbsp;mm  and 27.78&amp;nbsp;mm, were about 2.6% larger than the previous Parisian measures and 9% larger than their British counterparts.
*The ''aune'' ([[ell]]), used to measure cloth, was defined as 120 centimetres, and divided into the ''demi aune'' (half an ell) and the ''tiers aune'' (third of an ell). It was 1.3% larger than ''l’aune de Paris'' (118.48&amp;nbsp;cm) and 5.0% larger than its English counterpart (45&amp;nbsp;inches; 114.3&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

*The [[litre]] was subdivided like an English [[quart]], into ''demis'' (literally, "halves", being the equivalent of a [[pint]] of about sixteen [[fluid ounce]]s), ''quarts'' (literally, "fourths", being the equivalent of a cup of about eight fluid ounces), ''huitièmes'' (literally, "eighths") and ''seizièmes'' (literally, "sixteenths", of about two fluid ounces).
*The ''boisseau'', ([[bushel]]), was redefined as being an eighth of a hectolitre and with associated measures ''double-boisseau'', ''demi-boisseau'' and ''quart-boisseau'' (double, half and quarter bushels respectively). The original ''boisseau'', like the English bushel, varied depending on the ''commodity for which'' it was used, as well as the ''region where'' it was used.
*The ''livre'', ([[Pound (mass)|pound]]), was defined as 500&amp;nbsp;grams, divided into 16 ''onces'', (ounces), each ''once'' being divided into 8 ''gros''. Each gros being thought of as being composed of 72 ''grains'', whose name is the same as in English. Hence, the livre was 9216 ''grains''.&lt;ref name=Europa1842/&gt;  The ''livre'' and ''once'' were about 10% larger than their English counterparts, while the ''grain'' was 17% less than its English counterpart. It can be noted that the metric livre, although not legal, is still commonly used in daily life in France in the 21st century.

The ''mesures usuelles'' did not include any units of length greater than the ''toise'' - the ''[[myriamètre]]'' (10&amp;nbsp;km) remaining in use throughout this period.&lt;ref name="Europa1842"&gt;{{cite web

'''Mihai Olos''' (born 26 February 1940 in [[Ariniș]], Romania – died 22 February 2015 in [[Endingen am Kaiserstuhl|Amoltern]], Endigen, Germany). Romanian [[conceptual art]]ist, [[poet]], [[List of essayists|essayist]]. A gifted colorist in his first paintings, he became more attracted towards experimenting with various forms and materials. Familiar with the rural wood culture, he intended to follow in the footsteps of [[Constantin Brâncuși|Constantin Brâncuşi]], combining the spirit of the local folk culture with the trends of modern and contemporary art. Intending to take further the great sculptor's experience, Olos transformed the spindle-head – a miniature of the nail-less junctions in the architecture of the wooden churches of [[Maramureș|Maramureş]] – into a constructive module for the project of a universal city he called “Olospolis” that he theorized and represented in different forms and materials. While living and working in [[Baia Mare]] – an art center famous for its school of painting – he became first known due to paintings labeled as constructivist and his happenings, being classified among the neo-avangard Romanian artists during the seventies. Even though his first solo show in Rome (1969) had been a success, one of his silver medaled sculptures was included in the [[Tokyo Fuji Art Museum|Fuji Museum]] collection in [[Tokyo]], and his wooden sculptures were appreciated by the American artist and [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi]] scholar [[Athena Tacha|Athena Tacha Spear]], his real recognition abroad begun with [[Joseph Beuys]]' remarking that he was a 'genuine artist' (“Endlich, ein Künstler!”) when Olos presented his concept of the Universal City and drew his module on a blackboard at one of the Free University seminars in Kassel, in 1977. Consequently, Beuys included the blackboard with the drawing in his “Das Kapital” shown in the main pavilion of the 1980 Venice Biennial. Olos' six month teaching at the “Justus Liebig” University in Giessen, his successful performances, solo shows in Wickstadt and [[Giessen]] and later on in the [[Netherlands]], made him realize that his work and ideas could have a better audience abroad. Thus, also due to the political turmoil in [[Romania]] after 1989, the artist moved his residence in the south-west of [[Germany]], continuing to exhibit in his native and neighboring countries. In the last decade of his life, finally recognizing his importance as an international artist, he was honored in his country of birth with a diploma, an anniversary show in [[Baia Mare]] and another one in the [[Brukenthal National Museum|Brukenthal Contemporary Art Museum]] from [[Sibiu]]. In the autumn following his death, the curators of the [[Timișoara|Timişoara]] 2015 International Art Encounters exhibition showed his work in a special gallery. But only the posthumous extensive exhibition at the [[National Museum of Contemporary Art (Romania)|National Museum of Contemporary Art]], Bucharest (May 2016 - October 2017, curator Călin Dan) offered an insight into the variety, extent, and quality of his work, setting the basis of the future development of his generous, inclusive constructive concept of the Universal City. Reticent to sell during his lifetime, there are still few state (among these about 30 in the Baia Mare Art Museum) and private collections owning his work, the greatest number being still in the possession of the estate curated by Plan B Gallery. The latest art fairs – in Madrid, [[The Armory Show (art fair)|Armory Show]] in New York, [[Art Basel|ArtBasel]] in Switzerland and ArtBasel in Hong Kong – have shown an increase in museums' and collectors' interest in his work, and the 2018 autumn show in [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] workshop at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou|Pompidou Center]] in Paris will mark the real acknowledgment of the importance of his work.

=== Place, time, and name as markers. Happy Childhood in the village (1940-1953) ===
Mihai Olos's family roots are connected to the picturesque county [[Maramureş]] from north-western Romania. The ethnographic zone of his birthplace [[Ariniș]] (its older name being“Ardihat”) is that of the sub-Codru (sub-forest) zone, connected with the culture of wood. If geographically the village is situated close to the central point of [[Europe]], historically it is on the borders of the ancient [[Dacia]], on the limes (limits or borders) of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] colonization, with some [[Celtic nations|Celtic]] remains still visible in some circular stone crosses still extant also in the churchyard of the artist's birthplace. The recent archaeological discoveries have brought up remains of an important neolithic culture as well. The inhabitants are proud of their noble origins certified in the [[Maramureș|Maramureş]] “Diplomas”, of their contribution to the development of nation building. Their opposition to denationalization during the [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian-Hungarian Empire]] and the [[Vienna Award|Vienna Diktat]], and, with less success, during the years of the totalitarian regime have to be remembered as well. They are also proud for having contributed to the formation of the national language, with the oldest codex of written language found in a monastery from the region.

Mihai, the second son of a Romanian family, was baptized after his father known as “Mihaiu Florii Vilii” in village because there was an other unrelated family also called Olos.{{efn|This family name is uncommon not only in the region, being at times mistaken for names of Hungarian origin such as “Oros(z)” (Russian), “Ollos” (Shearmen), or “Olasz” (Italian). The label “Mantova-Galizia stramport (sic!)” used to be attached to the family, suggesting that their ancestors had been immigrants of Italian origin, settled in Maramureș during the Austrian-Hungarian monarchy. The connection to Galizia becomes plausible when one thinks of the name being quite frequent in nowadays Poland.}} The artist was proud of his father's maternal family being elated to [[Gheorghe Pop de Băsești|George Pop de Băsești]], a politician, vice-president of the Transylvanian National Party at the end of the 19th century. Still, while elaborating his future concept of universal city, he liked to connect his family name to the word's meaning in ancient Greek, i.e. “universal” or “total”.

His mother Ana, coming from the [[Borşa]] family (or clan) of noble origin, was born in [[Crucișor|Poiana Codrului]] (Forest Clearing), in the full of mysteries zone of wood culture. Among the inhabitants of [[Crucișor|Poiana Codrului]] there were also German settlers, employed in the glass factory. His mother's blue eyes and fair hair might suggest also a Germanic ancestry.

Mihai's childhood had started as happily in a still unaltered natural and cultural environment with archaic roots as concerns the organization of the homestead, interior decoration of the home, the authenticity of the household object, customs and faith. A beautiful baby with white skin, dark eyes and curly hair, whom his proud father used to show to those around raising him above his head and boasting with his vigor that showed him older than his real age. They used to give him to brides to hold in order to have as beautiful babies as he.

Since his father was most of the time away selling cattle at fairs, the baby boy spent his time with his mother and in the company of the village women. He saw them at work and witnessed their gatherings where sewing, spinning or other household activities were accompanied by singing, the reciting of folk poetry, the telling of tales. The secret practice of charms and witchcraft was still alive those days. The boy with an excellent memory and beautiful voice learned everything he could from the women and in no time became their favorite, imbued with all their knowledge. From his three years older brother and the village boys he learned their games and the making of hair balls, wooden toys, musical instruments from reed or corn stalks, of tree bark or young offspring, wooden skates or even sleighs a.s.o. His father's being a tradesman influenced him in making rosewater and sell it to the girls in the village. Later on he wrote the girls' letters to their lovers in the army or composed little poems, drew images and texts for their wall-cloths for a modest return. Taking the cattle to the pasture, participating in the farm work from sowing to harvest and the preparation for the next crop, he was also involved in the rural rites around the year. From time to time, when the cattle fair happened to be in their village at crossroads, he was a witness to men's stories, those of the tradesmen coming also from other counties. He learned from them communication skills and the love of conviviality and this whetted his appetite to explore the world.

His early childhood, as he recalled it in his stories, appeared less marked by the war or the experiences of the [[Transylvania|Transylvanian's]] who had to leave their homes during the [[Vienna Award|Vienna Diktat]]. Living in the child 's closed universe, at that time he was unaware of what was happening in the rest of the world. His father hadn't been conscripted to go to war. No one from the family died on the battle fields. The only tragic event he remembered was that one of his uncles coming home from the war died the day after his arrival and his daughter went after him.

The changes in the family's fate came after the war when, according to the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Ribbentrop-Molotov agreement]] the country fell under the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] influence. The falsified elections from 1946, the installment of a communist government, the forced abdication of the king at the end of 1947, affected the child through their consequences. He remembered his father's loss of all the money he had earned selling cattle, due to the stabilization of currency in 1948. With the family's shaken material status, the two sons had to become their father's helpers in the everyday choirs, whether working in the field or taking care of animals. Going to school and joining the community of the other children from the village came as a compensation. Starting school attendance at six, due to his interest in learning while seeing his elder brother' progress, Mihai became a dedicated pupil, determined to learn an discover all the secrets hidden in the world of books. Even if this period changed his orientation from the traditional multifaceted visual and oral culture towards what McLuhan call “the Gutenberg Galaxy”, the archaic archetypal elements of folk culture and mentality would company alter on the artist in his encounters with the western urban culture.

=== Estrangement from the village. Secondary school in the provincial town of Baia Mare (1953-1956) ===
A radical change in Mihai's life happened on September 11, 1950, when his mother died in childbirth, a death he never forgot. Their father's remarriage came as another shock to the boys and Mihai's elder brother, Vasile, was the first one to run away from home, followed by Mihai in 1953. Without any material support from home, the boys had no right to receive a scholarship because of their father's refusal to join the collective farm in the village. So they had to take their lives in their own hands. Mihai begun to teach private lessons and during the school holidays worked as a courier at the local newspaper. Learning the '''ABC of journalism''', he was sent to the countryside as a cub reporter, meeting various categories of people. This experience served him later on, when writing for the press and giving a theoretical grounding to his theories about art and the concept of the Universal City.

=== A wild interlude – substitute teacher in Oaş&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;(1956-1959) ===
After graduating high-school and with his experience in private tutoring, Mihai applied for a teaching job. The school was in a remote village in [[Oaș Country|Oaş county]], [[Călinești-Oaș|Pășunea Mare]] (Big Pasture). The zone had a specific ethnographic character, with extremely proud people who still practiced the vendetta. The women wore vividly colored skirts and scarves. The men used to wear on the top of their head a little straw hat embellished with beads. They were renowned woodcutters but there was no land good to farm. Poor eaters but great drinkers they wouldn't accept a refusal when they offered a drink to their guests. Mihai got lodging for free in the house of violinist (“ceteraș”, from the name of the violin called “cetera”) and as a young school master he often accompanied the violinist to wedding feasts and round dances, playing the contra. The dances were full of rhythm, the singing with hollers, shriek, piercing interventions. Later on he will practice this kind of shriek singing – hollering – many times in his life, making himself remarked. For the young man who was not even seventeen when he arrived there, it was a capital experience from many points of view. With the permanent presence of death as he could have been killed if interfering in their feuds, this period could be compared to an initiation rite. As these remote villages from Oaş had also served as refuge for many fine intellectuals belonging to the former regime, these political refugees were the first to make known to him the names of the great Romanian writers never mentioned in school or those of important European or American authors and artists.

The gains of the years spent in different places from were counterbalanced by the harsh conditions of life and the poverty of the villagers. The improper living conditions and the poor diet affected the feeble young man's health. The occasion to leave was offered by the newly founded teachers training colleges all over the country and he chose to go.

=== Student in the cultural capital of Transylvania (1959-1963) ===
Advised by the intellectuals he had met and befriended in [[Oaș Country|Oaș]], he chose to go to [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], the cultural capital of [[Transylvania]], instead of going to a closer town, such as [[Baia Mare]]. The years spent in [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], first as a student in the teacher training college then in painting section of the newly founded pedagogical institute, were decisive for his career. More important than the educational institutions he had attended, it was the cultural milieu in [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]]. The city had impressive buildings and churches, a national theater, a philharmonic, a long academic tradition, with various higher educational institutions, humanities, arts, music, a medical school of world renown, an excellent polytechnic, a wonderful botanical garden and a marvelous university library, important literary magazine. There were also the great professors and artists populating the town and these institutions, though some of the great personalities were still prosecuted. Among these were the great poet and philosopher [[Lucian Blaga]] who had been given a humble job at the university library and, the more visible for his patriarchal appearance, prose writer [[Ion Agârbiceanu]]. The city was accommodating thousands of students coming from different parts of the country, some of them, like himself, born in peasant families and determined to become intellectuals according to the traditional Transylvanian respect for learning.{{efn|Mihai Olos' article written to commemorate his friend “Pictorul Cornelius Brudașcu la cei 70 de ani ai săi”, Transilvania, 6/2007, 93-96, give a vivid description of this period.}}

As much as he would have wished to become a student at the “Ion Andreescu” art academy, it had been impossible for him to survive without any material support during the six years of study required there. Nevertheless, he was lucky to have at the pedagogical institute a good professor of art, Coriolan Munteanu, renowned painter of churches, who recognized his students' personality and did not bridle their independent spirit with academic rules.

With his health problems aggravating, Mihai, like many other students, was lucky to be interned for long periods of time at the university clinic's student “preventorium”. There, he got not only treatment but escaped from having to provide for himself. Other advantages were the presence of the doctors, some of them great intellectuals, and the contact with a variety of interesting or picturesque patients, among whom there were also some hiding from prosecutions. These counterbalanced the daily presence of death as TB was still an incurable disease, the use of streptomycin being only experimental.

The artist relates about a night in a moment when he had given up all hope to get well, depressed after his brother's death by drowning, in May 1962. In despair he decided to enjoy the remaining time exploring the city's night life, eloping from the ward and climbing over the fence surrounding the garden. The waiters in the restaurant offered him drinks and food for free on condition he entertained their clients singing the way he had learned in [[Oaș Country|Oaș]]. He used to return to the preventorium secretly before dawn and sleep off his tiredness during the day. Whether due to these escapades or the use of streptomycin, he got well to the doctors' and nurses' amazement. His escape from death had the subtext of a Faustian pact allowing him to pursue his artistic destiny.

=== The Baia Mare Artistic Center in the sixties ===
After his graduation in 1963, he was hired as a teacher of painting at the so-called “popular” art school in [[Baia Mare]], with night classes for art amateurs from different walks of life. The school was another project of the regime to educate people but also keep them busy and under surveillance. Even though this job was not at the extant art school in town, it gave the young painter more freedom and time to work during the day and prepare for the annual art shows where he had shown his paintings also as an undergraduate, since 1962.

An exhibition catalog from 1966 shows who were those who held the power to direct the local arts after the dissolution of the old traditional painting school. The president of the jury was sculptor [[Géza Vida]], People's Artist, and laureate of the State Prize, with a privileged political status as a former participant in the International Brigades during the Spanish civil war. The jury members were: graphic artist, Paul I. Erdös, laureate of the State Prize (a Holocaust victim), painter Lidia Agricola, laureate of the State Prize (in her youth connected with the illegal communist party, widow of a painter victim of the Nazi's), and the older painter Andrei Mikola, Emeritus Artist who had studied in France. The others were the director of the local art museum, the representatives of the regional and county committee for culture and art, two so-called art critics with no special studies in the field of art, and finally a younger painter Traian Hrişcă, who had studied at the Bucharest art academy. Besides the artists already mentioned, among those who participated in the regional show in 1966, there were two other sculptors: Ştefan Şainelic and the now forgotten Maria Gyerkö, 12 graphic artists with 27 works, some of them, like Nicolae Apostol, Zoltan Bitay later better known as painters; 12 painters besides those mentioned, with 38 paintings, the best known being Iosif Balla, Alexandru Şainelic, Iuliu Dudás, Traian and Mircea Hrişcă, Ileana Krajnic, Augustin Véső, Imola Várhelyi, Ion Sasu from [[Satu Mare]], and Natalia Grigore from [[Sighetu Marmației|Sighet]].

After what he learned in [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]] about the Romanian modern artists and western art, the impressionism enjoyed by the local public did not suit the young artist. Neither did the official style of “socialist realism” imposed by the party as meant to glorify the new building sites and the achievements of the workers and peasants in the country appeal to him. But Mihai Olos was not the only one to disagree with the party's directions. The younger painters who had closer connection with western art were also discontent with the outdated style and the themes officially imposed. Thus, on the occasion of the Hungarian master Barcsay Jenő's visit to his native village Nima, near [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], at Augustin Vésö's initiative, a group of young artists simply kidnapped the painter and brought him to see their work. Mihai Olos was among those who met him.

=== A window opened westward&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ===
In the autumn of 1964, the young teacher of amateur artists fell in love with Ana, one of his pupils. She was a teacher of English at the local Pedagogical Institute whose father owned carpenters workshop in [[Timișoara|Timişoara]] that would provide him with frames and panel for his paintings and logs for his sculptures. Raised in the still patriarchal village community Mihai considered having a family and offsprings as a condition of personal fulfillment. Moreover, meeting a young woman bearing his mother's name took it as a good omen. The parents' wedding gift was a [[Trabant]], a much despised car brand those days and was left for the time being to rust in the street. So the young couple's honeymoon was spent as a train trip to [[Hungary]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]. In [[Budapest]], they visited the art museum, impressed by the collection of [[Art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian art]], and, more important, they visited Jenő Barcsay's studio. The old master, a great admirer of [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] art, was already acknowledged as a great artist. He became world-famous especially due to his monumental Anatomy of the Artist translated into various languages. He was then working on a project to decorate the national theater in Budapest and showed them his sketches. But the real highlight of the journey abroad was an exhibition of modern art in [[Bratislava]], with works of painters well known to the artist from albums but with the original paintings seen for the first time: [[Georges Braque|Braque]], [[Paul Klee|Klee]], [[André Derain|Derain]], [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] a.s.o. The most impressive experience in [[Prague]] had been the visit to the [[Náprstek Museum|ethnological museum Náprstek]], with its excellent collection of primitive art.

This first trip abroad, even if in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] zone, strengthened the artist's determination to travel westward. For this he had to become known and find supporters among the critics and the leaders of the Painters Union in [[Bucharest]]. Still, he did not desire to move to the capital for had the conviction, coming from what he knew about [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] art, that he had to keep close to his roots and the folk traditions of the county where he was born.

After becoming a member on probation of the Romanian Artists Union he got he the right to rent a studio and being married he could apply for an apartment in one of the newly built blocks of flats. Moreover, marriage and the birth of children would entitle the artist to get a passport to visit also other countries in the West.

=== Constantin Brâncuşi – Master Model and “Recommander” to Critics ===
[[File:Sculpture in wood by Mihai Olos.jpg|alt=Sculpture in wood by Mihai Olos|thumb|'''Sculpture in wood by Mihai Olos''']]
Mihai Olos was only seventeen when the great sculptor died in Paris and he must have heard the rumors about the communist government's refusal to accept [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] studio and bring home his work. Thus the artist's inheritance remained to the France whose citizen he had become a year before his death. Mihai Olos must have read also the articles published by the art critics [[Barbu Brezianu]] and [[Petru Comarnescu]] about the sculptor. Reading [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] biography, the young artist was impressed by the similitude with his own life-story: orphan at an early age (though it had been [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] father who had died), he ran away from home when he was eleven; he had a beautiful voice, he had suffered of [[tuberculosis]] and feeble health; he was fond of company, sang well, had been admired and loved by women etc. Moreover, Mihai realized that when he left his beard grow there was a shocking resemblance between him and the great sculptor, a resemblance he stressed wearing white folk garments and making people observe this similitude. The great sculptor's work – especially his birds and the [[Sculptural Ensemble of Constantin Brâncuși at Târgu Jiu|Endless column]] – had been inspired by elements of folk carvings. Exploiting the folk art Mihai so well knew, with its abstract symbolism, seemed the best source of inspiration to circumvent and counteract the officially imposed style. Nevertheless, avoiding to become just an imitator of [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] model, Mihai Olos had to find some original element becoming his own. If [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi]] had found inspiration in the wooden pillars from [[Oltenia]] and the wooden birds on pillars representing the soul of the deceased in country churchyards, Mihai remembered the combination of wooden pillars from the architecture of the churches in [[Maramureș|Maramureş]] and discovered an ingenious miniature replica of these wooden structures, replacing the little wheel at the end of the wooden spindles used by women when spinning. Moreover, some of these miniature structures at the end of the spindles had pebbles in the middle which made a rattling sound while the woman was spinning.

His admiration for [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] personality and art made Mihai Olos approach those who had known and written about the master and who would recognize his physical resemblance to him as a guarantee of his also becoming a great artist. The most important among these [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi]] scholars was art critic [[Petru Comarnescu]] living in the capital city who – after a long period of prosecution for having been member, together with [[Mircea Eliade]], of a right-wing group of intellectuals – got back the right to publish under his own name, during the mid nineteen-sixty's political thaw. The first great show of notice he organized was that of [[Ion Țuculescu|Ion Ţuculescu's]] paintings which had no connection with socialist realism, an exhibition he will itinerate in the [[United States]].

Mihai's trips to [[Bucharest]], multiply and [[Petru Comarnescu]] includes him among the young artist deserving to be encouraged. The critic not only accepts him in his home with the other young artists, but after testing him to see whether he deserves his confidence, receives him as his friend, lets him sleep on the couch in the entrance hall, allows him to look at his art collection, his books, to read some of the letters he used to get from his friends living abroad, among them [[Eugène Ionesco|Eugène Ionesco]], [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Emil Cioran]], as well as other members of the [[Diaspora]].

The desire to exhibit in [[Bucharest]] became even stronger for the artist when the Baia Mare art museum opened a group show of [[Bucharest]] painters: Spiru Chintilă (b. 1921) from an older generation, who had had a solo show in [[Baia Mare]] in 1959, Mihai Danu (b.1926), Ion Pacea (b.1924) and Ion Gheorghiu (b.1929). If Chintila's paintings hinted at cubism, Gheorgiu and Pacea had both, among other paintings, landscapes from Italy, as they had represented Romania at the [[Venice Biennale|Venice Biennial]] in 1964.

=== First shows: figurative, abstract, and stained-glass paintings (1965) ===
In order to exhibit in [[Bucharest]], the artist had to show his work in his home town. Since 1962, while still a student, Mihai Olos had been present with his work in all local and regional collective art shows in [[Baia Mare]]. The first of these was in the company of graphic artist Cornel Ceuca. As its modest catlog shows, it was under the patronage of the Plastic Artists Union, and was opened at the Regional Museum in [[Baia Mare]], in the summer of 1965.

As seen in the exhibition catalog,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Expoziţie de pictură şi grafică: Mihai Olos şi Cornel Ceuca|last=|first=|publisher=Editura UAP|year=1965|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mihai Olos had on show 12 paintings in oil, most of them square (around 50x50). He chose themes that permitted abstract representations like “'''Archaeology'''”, “'''Fire place'''”, “'''Reel'''”, “'''Homage'''”. But also paintings with themes from the country-side, like “'''Village band'''”, “'''Women from Lăpuş''' '''County'''” etc.. Even his women's portraits were far from realistic. Besides his oil paintings, there were also 11 small dimension stained-glass paintings imitating the technique of the folk icons still to be found in villagers' houses and old churches. Though religious themes were banned those days of official atheism, he still dared to hint at his source by entitling one of them “Biblical”. Others of Mihai Olos' paintings represented a series of '''children's games''' from the countryside. The following one man show was in [[Borșa|Borşa]] and another in [[Baia Mare]], without printed catalogs.

In 1965, he made his first abstract '''wooden sculpture''' he entitled “'''The secret of the heart'''” inspired from the joints in the local wooden architecture and the rattling wooden knot at the end of the spindle that will later on become the module for his “Universal City”. Though not accepted by the jury, he succeeded to put his sculpture in one of the showrooms promising a prize to anyone succeeding to dismantle the sculpture. But no one succeeded.

=== The Brâncuşi Colloquium in [[Bucharest]] (1967) ===
An important or rather crucial event in the young artist's life was the Brâncuşi Colloquium organized in [[Bucharest]] in 1967, ten years after the great sculptor's death in Paris. Since the [[International Association of Art Critics]] acted as a partner, its then president Jacques Lassaigne was invited to attend. Besides him, the most important critics of the master's work had come to [[Bucharest]]. Among them were: [[Werner Hofmann (art historian)|Werner Hoffman]] from Vienna, [[Palma Bucarelli]], Giuseppe Marchiori and [[Giulio Carlo Argan|Carlo Giulio Argan]] from Italy, Carola Giedion Welcker from Switzerland. Still none of the Romanian art critics from the diaspora – among whom we should mention Ionel Jianu – had been invited.

To honor this occasion, the Romanian Artists Union opened various exhibitions with the work of young artists. Mihai Olos had been included with some of his paintings on wood panels, in the group of thirteen artists whose work was shown at the “Kalinderu” art gallery. Critic Dan Grigorescu sees the group as a generation of “very young” artists, and lists the participants: [[Henry Mavrodin]], Şerban Gabrea, Barbu Niţescu, Ion Bănulescu, Mihai Olos, Gabriel Constantinescu, Carolina Iacob, Adrian Benea, Paula Ribariu, Mircea Milcovici, [[Horia Bernea]], Florin Ciubotaru, Ion Stendl and Marin Gherasim. Other groups of artists were shown at the more visible Dalles art gallery and at the Art Museum, as one can learn from [[Ion Frunzetti|Ion Frunzetti's]] review.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Moment plastic|last=|first=|date=1967|work=Arta Plastica|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|quote=Ion Frunzetti p.21-24, Ion Grigorescu, p. 25-26, Vasile Drăguţ,}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olos had been invited together with other young artists to the reception [[Petru Comarnescu]] offered at his home, 10 Icoanei street. Carola Giedeon Welcker mentioned the event in her introduction to [[Petru Comarnescu|Comarnescu's]] book on [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi]], published after the critic's death.{{efn|Petru Comarnescu, Letter in Ana Olos' archive.}} On [[Petru Comarnescu|Comarnescu's]] advice, Olos offered three of his paintings on wood as gifts to critics Welcker, [[Palma Bucarelli|Buccarelli]], [[Giulio Carlo Argan|Giulio Argan]].

The presence of the Italian art critics inspired the young artist, who had reached the age when [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi]] had left the country, to take his first trip west to Italy. It had been the destination [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi]] himself had had first in mind, though his destiny took him first to Vienna, then to Germany and finally to Paris. But before showing his work abroad, Mihai Olos was expected to exhibit in the capital of his home-country.

In a letter dated 1 November 1967, Petru Comarnescu was informing his protégé about some Swedish art critics intending to organize an exhibition in Stockholm. They were selecting young artists and therefore visited various shows and young artists' studios. In the same letter Comarnescu was advising the young artist to continue to work in the abstract-folkloric style, because the critic's firm conviction was that the complementarity of the folkloric elements and modernism in [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] work was the secret of his greatness and success. There are also hints to Olos' planned exhibition in the capital.

== Travels, Works, and Shows (1968-1974) ==
Since his first solo show in Rome, it would be difficult to separate the artist's life from his work for all his experiences serves to the development of his art. In the same way, the different forms of art, painting, sculpture, decorative or experimental art work develop almost simultaneously, most of them concerned with the development of his module, the knot, at the basis of progressions that should lead to materialization of his future project of the Universal City.

=== First solo show in [[Bucharest]] (1968) ===
Local or Transylvanian critics began to write about Mihai Olos' art beginning with the first shows of his work in [[Maramureș|Maramureş]]. His inclusion among the 13 artists shown at “Kalinderu Gallery”, had been an incentive to [[Petru Comarnescu|Petru Comarnescu's]] and other critics to publish in [[Bucharest]] art magazines about his work, while his presence at the Brâncuşi Colloquium imposed him to public attention. This reputation helped him to open his first one-man show at a central art gallery on [[Bulevardul Magheru|Magheru boulevard]] in [[Bucharest]], in January 1968.

There were 26 oil paintings with different themes (the best known among them: “Dance from Oaş” and “Pipers”), most of them abstract. There were also 37 mixed technique paintings on wood, and 5 banners hinting at church ceremonials. One of the paintings included in the catalog represented a stylized crucifixion.{{efn|Exhibiton catalogue. Ana Olos' family archive}} The show was a success with quite a number of critical articles in the press, not only in [[Bucharest]] but also in the provinces, among the authors, besides [[Petru Comarnescu]], being sculptor Ion Vlasiu, art critics Olga Buşneag, Eduard Constantinescu, and younger critic [[Radu Varia]] who will become one of his friends.

The same year he had four sculptures exhibited at the [[Milan Triennial|Triennial of Milan]]. Unfortunately, the show was devastated by rioters and it was closed down. Nevertheless, the artist succeeded to recover his sculptures. This success encouraged the artist to apply for a passport in order to visit Italy as a tourist.

=== Visiting the 1968 Venice Biennial&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Anonimat şi efemer: Avangarda plastică Italiană|last=Olos|first=Mihai|date=1969|work=Echinox I/ 7-8|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
His frequent trips to [[Bucharest]], since the time he had been a student, and his contact with various people while he had been teaching in [[Oaș Country|Oaş]], some of these already in the surveillance files of the secret police, the much feared [[Securitate]], and especially his contact with the foreign participants who attended the Brâncuşi Colloquium brought the young artist also to the secret police's attention. Thus it was of almost impossible for him to get a passport to go abroad.

But one of their family's friends, writer and critic Monica Lazar, sent a letter asking one of her friends in [[Bucharest]] who held a high position in the ministry of foreign affairs to support the artist's application for a passport. Still he artist received the permission to leave the country only a months after their baby daughter's birth, in July 1968.

Mihai Olos left for [[Italy]] just a days before the [[Warsaw Pact|Warsaw Treaty's]] troops (except [[Romania]] and [[Albania]]) invaded [[Czechoslovakia]] on the night of 20–21 August. The most important event for his artistic career was his visit of the 34th [[Venice Biennale|Venice Biennial]]. He was happy to lay hands on the bulky second, corrected, revised and amplified edition of the catalog that had been printed in August at Fantoni Artegrafica Venezia, its “copertina” reproducing the Biennial's manifesto “ideato da Mario Cresci”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Catalogo della XXXIV Espozitione Biennale Internazionale d'Arte Venezia. 18.06 – 16.10, 1968. Secondo edizione ampliata, riveduta e corretta.|last=|first=|publisher=Fantoni Artegrafica, Alfieri – Edizione d'arte|year=|isbn=|location=Venezia|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The “catalogo” opened with its president Giovanni Favaretto Fisca's Preface and G.A. Dell'Aqua's “Introduzione” he had no need to read then but which are important in retrospect.

Both texts underline the renewal of the oragnizers' vision since the first after-war edition in 1948. The organizers were under the pressure of many protests and the actual changes in society and art. The artists couldn't be anymore classified simply into two categories, “figurative” or “abstract”, as some of them came with completely new innovative practices in art (XXIII).

The organizers had intended to show in the central pavilion, on the one hand, the four major representatives of the first Italian futurismo – [[Giacomo Balla|Giacommo Balla]], [[Carlo Carrà]], [[Luigi Russolo]] and [[Gino Severini]], [[Umberto Boccioni|Boccioni]] having been on show in the previous edition. On the other hand, they had prepared a large international show e titled “Linea della ricerca contemporanea – Dall' Informale alle nuove strutture”. This had to show the most representative artists, exponents of the successive tendencies from 1950 to 1965. “Informal” had been used with the widest sense of the word referring to “materials, corporeal language, 'gesto', signs and 'scrittura'; new [[abstractionism]] referred to “space, geometry, color”; perceptive structures: rhythm, movement, light. The new figuration, starting from expressionism and surrealism, included figures, grotesque forms and visions; objectual realism: things, persons, signals; the new dimensions of space: object-paintings, environmental work, primary structures a.s.o. Furthermore, they had wanted to include minor art forms such as ceramics, or other forms of visual arts, like stage design, photography, [[advertising]] and [[industrial design]], poesia visiva etc.

Moreover, they had intended to invite four contemporary architects – [[Franco Albini]], [[Louis Kahn]], [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]], and [[Carlo Scarpa]] – to show their specific way of imagining and configuring space.

Mihai Olos had not recorded in writing his observations about the Biennale, probably thinking that he would never forget what he saw, one could just suppose the huge visual impact the show had on him. Some representative artist's names appearing in the catalog were: [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francnis Bacon]], [[Josef Albers]], [[Jean Arp]], [[Willi Baumeister]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Lucio Fontana]], [[Hans Hartung]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Kazimir Malevich|Kasimir Malevich]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Ben Nicholson]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Eduardo Paolozzi]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Antoni Tàpies|Antonio Tapies]], [[Günther Uecker|Gunther Uecker]], [[Victor Vasarely|Viktor Vasarely]], and among others [[Wolf Vostell|Wolf Vostel]] with his “happening”. To these, one should add what the 34 national pavilions contained. The Italian Pavilion presented 23 artists, most of them considered of no great importance by the contestants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/7438933/Una_Pagina_Dimenticata_-_Analisi_delle_Tensioni_Artistiche_e_Sociali_alla_Biennale_Veneziana_del_1968|title=Una Pagina Dimenticata. Analisi delle Tensioni Socilai alla Biennale Veneziana 1968|last=di Stefano|first=Chiara|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mihai Olos was happy to see that among those who introduced the artists in the catalog were the names of the two critics he had met in [[Bucharest]] the previous year. [[Giulio Carlo Argan]] wrote about [[Mario Nigro]] whose “Dallo 'spazio totale'” (1954) with its gridwork had caught his eyes. While [[Palma Bucarelli|Palma Buccarelli]] was enthusiastically introducing [[Pino Pascali]], as the “wonder child” of Italian art, with his use of combinations of traditional and new industrial materials (for example “steel wool” or plastic brushes) in achieving some unusual pieces of artworks like his huge “worm” of the mushroom-like “Pelo” (“Hair) and “Contropelo”(Counterhair) – an evident reference to the American “tribal” love-rock musical.

[[Palma Bucarelli|Bucarelli]] showed the connection between “ homo lundens” and “homo faber” in [[Pino Pascali|Pino Pascali's]] personality and underlined the artist's ironic titles illustrating his love of puns. She considered him to represent the new artists protesting against the consumerism of the society and the commodification of art. The tragic death of [[Pino Pascali]] in a motorcycle accident at the beginning of September attracted even more attention to his work and he became the Biennial's laureate. Touched by [[Pino Pascali|Pascali's]] tragic death, Mihai Olos will include in the catalog of his show in [[Rome]] the mirror image of his poem written in homage to the Italian artist.

The 1968 [[Venice Biennale]] is remembered also due to the students' protests and the organizers involving a great number of policeman and agents to keep order, that led to other protests, refusals to open certain shows, closing individual shows (Gastone Novelli, Achille Perilli or [[Nicolas Schöffer|Nicolas Scöffer]]) or national pavilions (e.g. the Swedish) or individual gestures of protest like turning the face of the paintings towards the wall and showing the back of the painted canvases.

Romania's commissar had been [[Ion Frunzetti]] and the artists on show: Virgil Almăşanu (b. 1926) with 32 oil paintings, [[Octav Grigorescu]] (b.1933) with 36 drawings, tempera and water color paintings, and sculptor [[Ovidiu Maitec]] (b. 1925) with 11 wooden sculptures and a bronze, each of the artists with two black and white photos in the show's catalog. If Almăşanu's abstract paintings were nothing new to the Mihai Olos. But [[Ovidiu Maitec|Ovidiu Maitec's]] use of wood for his sculptures must have made Olos think of this successfully relating to rural architecture in Romania. [[Ovidiu Maitec|Maitec's]] heavy winged “Bird” intentionally different from [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] birds resembled the massive hinges of a double gate, or to a magnified wooden hinge held together by a wooden nail. [[Ovidiu Maitec|Maitec's]] use of wood most probably gave Olos the idea to make himself some wooden sculptures there in [[Rome]], though smaller in dimension, for his show at Felluca Gallery.

=== First international solo show: Rome,“Felluca Gallery”(1969) ===
Arriving in the Italian capital, Mihai Olos got accommodation and the possibility to work at the [[Romanian Academic Society|Romanian Academy's]] subsidiary, where another artist, Petru Achiţenie was spending the time of his scholarship. Olos came with letters of recommendation to the members of the Romanian diaspora received from [[Petru Comarnescu]]. Among these, journalist Horia Roman and his daughter Cecilia (who became his closest friends), painter Vasile Drăguţescu, journalist Mircea Popescu and others. But Olos met and visited also Italian personalities in Romance studies like Rosa del Conte and others. As it is well known this was the period of students movements and it was a hard time for academics.

In just a period of some months, the young artist succeeded to set up his one-man show at “Felluca” art gallery. The well-organized '''opening''' – that could be considered a '''performance, as the artist clad in a hairy peasant's coat from Maramureș (“guba”), sang folk songs and hollered --''' proved to be a great success. The Romanian Embassy was represented by its Cultural Ataché, there were actors from the Cinecitta, artists, critics, diplomats, and, naturally, members of the Romanian diaspora. The show consisted in small stained glass paintings and small wooden sculptures whose forms already show the structural elements of the module for his universal city. Comments on the show appeared in the most important dailies and weeklies in Rome, such as ''Momento-sera, Il Tempo, Il Giornale d'Italia, Il mesagero, This Week in Rome.'' Among those who signed articles, besides the gallery owners, Derna and Vittore Querrel, had been also Lorenza Trucchi, an important art critic.

Besides his visit of Biennial and the promotion of his work, his stay in Italy had a profound impact on the artist. Starting with all that could be seen in Rome, he succeeded to go also to other important Italian cities. He visit the most important museums, churches and historical monuments, and saw the mot famous Italian artists' work. He also met or at least saw the work of the important artists of the day. It is no wonder that he did not hurry to return home. But the news from home – his father's being prosecuted for not having joined the collective farm and his wife being questioned about the date of his return – made him shorten his stay.{{efn|According to Mihai Olos, Letter to his friend Ion Vultur. No date. Copy in Ana Olos' archive.}}

Why did he not remain in Italy for good? Ceauşescu's refusal to join the Warsaw-pact troops at the invasion of Czechoslovakia had changed the perception of Romania in a favorable way in the eyes of the west. Thus the artist accepted the idea to return home in the hope that there would be other opportunities to leave the country.

=== Great expectations at home. Installations: “Dacia” Cinema and the Youth Club, Baia Mare (1969-1970) ===
Returning home with the glory of his success in Rome echoed in the Italian press and his own articles, Mihai Olos was commissioned with the decoration of a huge wall on the first floor of the '''entrance hall of “Dacia” cinema'''. His decorative work covering a surface of 120² m. was a visually impressive sequence of convex square aluminum plates, with inserts of smaller round mobile elements, alluding to Vasarely's op art as well as to his stables and mobiles. (The upper freeze was decorated with sculptor Valentina Boştină's work also with metal pieces.) During the nineties, the ones who bought the building tore down their work apparently with an intent to renovate the building, something they have not done.

Mihai Olos was also commissioned with the '''interior decoration of the local youth club.''' The decoration was, on the one hand, of rural inspiration with wooden tables and benches covered with red and black woolen rugs woven in the countryside, alluding to the striped front and back apron-like decorative pieces covering women's skirt in the village, called “zadie”. But the most spectacular part of the decoration were the huge round mirrors which had been made in the glass factory from Poiana Codrului (his mother's birthplace), reflecting and multiplying the space and giving depth and mystery to the rather small room. But this work has not been preserved either.

As a recognition of these achievements he received the Plastic Artists Union's '''youth prize''' and, in 1970, he was included – with a short presentation and the black-and-white reproduction of one of his painting's on wood – among the artists in the album with 1111 reproductions of Romanian painter's work edited by four critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pictura românească în imagini. 111 reproduceri.|last=Drăguţ|first=Vasile|last2=Florea|first2=Vasile|last3=Grigorescu|first3=Dan|last4=Mihalache|first4=Marina|publisher=|year=1970|isbn=|location=Bucuresti|pages=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work was characterized as a blending of the real and fabulous, as an expression of his tumultuous character, reminding of Rouault's expressionism. Still, the roots of his art were traced back to his native Maramureş, with the intention to modernize folk art.

Though cautioned by Petru Comarnescu to keep a low profile, the artist had confidence in his tremendous energy and capacity to impose his talent. Unaware of the “tall poppy syndrome” of those who couldn't accept other people's being successful, the artist believed that his show in Rome was just the first of a series of coming great successes. Believing that he could show at home and impose some of the new forms of art he had witnessed in Italy, he was expecting too much from the provincial public.

=== First happening / installation: “25” (1969) ===
His first happening entitled just '''“25”''' (that could be classified also as an installation), was on August 24, 1969, like an ironic counterpoint to the parades celebrating the country's “liberation” from fascism by the Soviet Army. For Olos' symbolic event was evidently meant to make people think about the victims of the recent floods in the country. It consisted in showing in the local art gallery{{efn|The art gallery was situated on the ground floor of one of the first `high-risers in [[Baia Mare]]. Its curator was the local older painter Iozsef Balla's wife, who used to talk and serve her friends with a cup of coffee behind a curtained partition of the gallery.}} two long flat metal vessels resembling baking tins, one containing water, where the visitors were supposed to throw coins (reminding of the Fontana Trevi), and the other with mud and green nettles. It is evident that he was echoing Pino Pascali's 32 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; di mare with trays painted in blue he had seen in Italy. The event was not commented upon in the press and his interview with a local reporter showed his disappointment at people's reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boitor|first=George|date=|title=Interviu cu Mihai Olos|url=|journal=Astra|volume=IV, 9 (40)|pages=1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contained also a quite subversive reference to Constantin Virgil Gheorghiu's book The 25th Hour, a novel that had been published in French translation in 1949, and had inspired Carlo Ponti's film (1967) directed by Henri Verneuil and starring Anthony Quinn and Virna Lisi.{{efn|As it appears in the Wikipedia article about him,Virgil Gheorghiu, then an orthodox priest in Paris Romanian, living in exile since 1944.

But the hint to Gheorghiu's novel or to Ponti's film could have been remarked by just very few people if any in the context of cultural isolation from the west in those days.}}

=== Going Eastward via The Soviet Union to Japan. The Osaka “Expo” and Japanese architecture (1970)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ===
The decoration of the movie theater came also with a financial gain that allowed the artist to pay his ticket for an excursion to Japan organized by the communist youth's travel agency. The same decision had been taken by his colleague Nicolae Apostol and both of them were accepted to join the group visiting the 1970 Osaka Expo.

The idea to visit Japan had come to the artist's mind already in 1967, when he met and interviewed anthropologist Tadao Takemoto who came to visit Maramureş. But now, the opportunity to see the Osaka International Fair came also with the thrill to see an event similar to the Montreal Expo that had celebrated the 100th anniversary of the Canadian confederation almost simultaneous with the Bucharest Brâncuşi Colloquium. As seen in the articles in the Artists Union's monthly Arta Plastică (12/1967) commenting on both events, the idea of associating sculpture with architecture was surfacing as a new idea in both events. in [[Bucharest]], it had been as an echo of [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] work, while in Montreal it was suggested by the Expo's general theme: “The human being and the Environment”. The Romanian reporter commenting on the Montreal show mentioned Tingueley's kinetic sculpture and Niki de Sain-Phalle's huge figures in the French Pavilion. The illustrations showed sculptures by Henry Moore, Calder etc., other images gave an idea of the futuristic sites of the new cities with the branching modular structures of the Canadian Moshe Safdie's “Habitat '67”, the experimental “Lego architecture” (nowadays a favorite among children's toy boxes), the idea of “ephemeral cities”, and the presence of Buckminster Fuller in Montreal. All these made the artist look forward to this trip to Japan.

Among the novelties the Osaka Expo showed in the field of architecture were the Telecommunication Pavilion, Midori-Kan's “Astrorama”, the image of the multidimensional world, the Toshiba Pavilion, and the Takara Group's “The Joy of Being Beautiful”. As he would later on mention it to Joseph Beuys at Kassel, Krebs had also there his laser sculptures. But what captivated the artist's attention in Japan more than the Osaka Expo was the use of wood in architecture, not much different from that in the Romanian villages. The artist will publish his observations in an article with his “super-expressions”, upon his return home.

Going to Japan by train via the Soviet Union allowed the group to visit also Leningrad and Moscow and the art museums there. It was also an opportunity to travel through the Russian taiga and Siberia, experiences which enriched the young artist's perception of the world.

His connection with Japan will be resumed later on when with other Romanian artists he will send some of his work to art shows in Japan and one of his wooden sculptures would get a prize.

=== Being informed – the provincial artist's secret. Approaches to urbanism&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ===
The artist who in his childhood had instinctively absorbed the message what his father's raising him above his head meant, became aware first of all that residing in a provincial town, before starting his way out, he had to know everything possible about the international art scene. During the period of thaw after Gheorge Gheorghiu- Dej's death, there was the possibility to subscribe to various publication from the neighboring Soviet-block countries and the artist could read or at least look at the name of the artists and their work in art magazines like the Hungarian ''Müvészet, Vytvarne umenie'' from Czechoslovakia, the embassy's' publications like ''La Pologne,'' the German ''Prisma,'' or the American ''Sinteza.'' If from England one could receive only their communist party's ''the Daily Worker'', one could freely subscribe to a series of French publications. Among these the hebdomadaire ''Les lettres françaises'' came with weekly fresh information in the field of art, with Jean Bouret's “Sept jour avec le peinture” and theoretical articles or even special issues dedicated to an artist with colored reproductions of his work. Less informative about the arts, the monthly ''Europe'' had also special issues dedicated to artists. A special art magazine like ''Cimaise'' or ''Arts-loisirs'' were more expensive and more difficult to subscribe to. One could also find in bookshops albums printed in France and could buy Albert Skira art albums of the greatest artists or collections of texts referring to a certain art trends, like Surrealism, for instance.

The Romanian ''Arta plastică'' was bringing information about what was happening in the country but also news of the art-world abroad. The monthly ''Secolul 20,'' whose director since 1963 had been art critic and later president of the art critics international association, Dan Hăulică, would contribute to inform on what was happening in contemporary culture. As the period of the thaw was encouraging translations in the field of arts as well, the Meridiane Press started to publish an important collection of books and also anthologies with texts on currents in art as well as syntheses.

On the occasion of their first trips abroad, the artist and his wife would always bring new art books and magazines. Thus his wife returned from her tourist visit to England with subscriptions to ''Burlington Art Magazine'' and ''Studio International,'' one of its issues containing a review of Athena Tacha's ''Brancusi's Birds''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brancusi's Birds|last=Tacha Spear|first=Athena|publisher=New York University Press|year=1969|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' This had been the starting point not only of the negotiation for the translation of the book but also of a long friendship. The American professor and sculptor of Greek/Vlach origin became the main provider of American art magazines (''Art International,'' ''Art and Artists, Art in America'' and ''Artforum''). Later on the artist would receive from Germany the similarly well informed ''Art Kunst''.

Even if the Romanian art magazine ''Arta plastică'' was the most important source of information about what was happening in the country, another important monthly world literature magazine, ''Secolul 20'' whose editors (like artist Geta Brătescu or its later editor-in-chief art critic Dan Hăulică), tried to bring into their readers attention what was actually happening in the western culture. This was also a period when publishing houses offered their readers translations of the most important books, at least those accepted for the party's cultural policy.

Among these books one of the most important proved to be an anthology of texts by Le Corbusier compiled so as to give a general image of the architect's life and work, introduced and translated by architect Michael Melicson, published by Meridiane art press in 1971. The very first page of Le Corbusier's presentation caught the artist's attention. It showed that although the French architect had no diploma and academic training in the field, he succeed to become more than that, “the only one who was in the same time architect, urbanist, poet, painter and writer, desiring to be a complete human being and artist, following the example of the Renaissance citizen-artists”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Le Corbiusier, poet al bucuriilor esenţiale|last=Melicson|first=Marcel|publisher=Editura Meridiane|year=1971|isbn=|location=Bucureşti|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his introduction, Melicson, himself a well informed architect, attracted his readers' attention on the fact that Le Corbusier was not the only a great architect of the period contributing to the formation of a new architectural vision. He provided names neglected by the “usual” dictionaries, such as: Adolf Loos, Walter Gropius, Frank Lloyd Wright, Alvar Aalto or Mies van der Rohe.

Among the artist's notes from the beginning of the 1970s – for in his “imitatio Brâncuşi” he used to put down his own cogitations, there is one idea he had pondered much upon. It gives the definition of a provincial artist as one who knows everything about the other artists but nobody knows him. (During the years he would discover that this is true – or at least it was true in those years with no access to information on the Internet – for all artists who did not live in great art centers. While preparing his show in the Nijmegen art gallery in 1989, his exhibition's curator, Van den Grinten, will show him a catalog published in 1964, with the work of an older Dutch sculptor, [[Erwin Heerich]] (b.1922). Among Heerich's experimental pieces, Mihai Olos will discover two with the cube, made of paper in 1962, identical with his own experimental forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Erwin Heerich. Plastiken, Bilder, Zeichnungen, Teppiche.(Ein Dokimentation zur 17 Ausstellung im Hausen van der Grinten|last=van der Grinten|first=Franz Josef|publisher=|year=1964|isbn=|location=Kranenburg|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The year 1970 came with a great loss for the artist: his great supporter, art critic [[Petru Comarnescu|Petru Comarnescu's]] death. But he had already become “visible” in the artworld of Bucharest and especially among the literati. The artist capable to not only to sing but also recite from Romanian or other great poets for hours had been accepted as one of them, a remarkable poet himself still more an artist for he had no ambition to collect his poems in a volume.

If the artist was remarked at first sight for his good looks, unconventional clothing either with original pieces from the countryside, or just inspired from the folk costumes from his region of birth or [[Oaș Country|Oaş]], sometimes tailored by himself, in conversation he would impress his partners with information coming from various fields, his wide knowledge of poetry – for he first had wanted to become a poet –, arts and philosophy, and also his interest in sciences. Since he had learned to read, books played an important place in his life. While a student, he not only visited art shows and museums but spent time in libraries as well, reading art history, studying reproductions in albums, including books on the index from which he made notes for later on.

Having read the Romanian Andrei Oţetea's general presentation of the [[Renaissance]] in 1964,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Renaşterea|last=Oţetea|first=Andrei|publisher=Editura ştiinţifică|year=1964|isbn=|location=Bucureşti|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the translation of [[Giorgio Vasari|Giorgio Vasari's]] lives of painters and sculptors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vieţile pictorilor, sculptorilor şi arhitecţilor, vol I-III|last=Vasari|first=Giorgio|publisher=Editura Meridiane|year=1968|isbn=|location=Bucureşti|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; having seen albums with reproductions, Mihai Olos had gone to Italy knowing lots of things about the [[Italian Renaissance]] and its artists. After his return he felt a need to confront his own impressions with those who wrote about Italian art. The first book he read was [[Jacob Burckhardt|Jakob Burckhardt's]] comments on [[Renaissance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultura Renaşterii|last=Burchhardt|first=Jakob|publisher=Editura pentru literatură|year=1969|isbn=|location=Bucureşti|pages=|translator-last=Balotă|translator-first=Nicolae|translator-last2=Ciorogaru|translator-first2=Gheorghe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irina Mavrodin's translation of Élie Faure's history of Italian art,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Istoria artei şi arta Renaşterii|last=Faure|first=Élie|publisher=Editura Meridiane|year=1970|isbn=|volume=vol. I-V|location=|pages=|translator-last=Mavrodin|translator-first=Irina}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Berenson|Bernard Berenson's]] book on Renaissance artists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pictorii italieni ai Renaşterii|last=Berenson|first=Bernard|publisher=Editura Meridiane|year=1971|isbn=|location=Bucureşti|pages=|translator-last=Theodor|translator-first=Enescu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

Nevertheless, what had made the greatest impact on Mihai Olos was [[Paul Valéry|Paul Valéry's]] ''Introduction to Leonardo da Vinci's Method''. He read the Romanian version&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducere în metoda lui Leonardo da Vinci|last=Valéry|first=Paul|publisher=Editura Meridiane|year=1969|isbn=|location=Bucureşti|pages=|translator-last=Foarțǎ|translator-first=Şerban}}&lt;/ref&gt; dwelling upon the text as well as on the marginal notes. He read with the same curiosity books on modern art. Giulio Carlo Argan's essays on the fall and salvation of modern art&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Căderea şi salvarea artei moderne|last=Argan|first=Giulio Carlo|publisher=Editura Meridiane|year=1970|isbn=|location=Bucureşti|pages=|translator-last=Lăzărescu|translator-first=George}}&lt;/ref&gt; that came with the presentation of important artists, and also [[Jean Grenier|Jean Grenier's]] essayas on contemporary art. In the Meridiane Press' collection of currents and synthesis, the young artist found the Romanian version of [[Nicolas Schöffer]]'s Le nouvel esprit artistique. The chapters on the three stages of dynamic sculpture, spatial dynamism, open structures, events and suspense, the suppression of the object and the illustrations representing Schöffer's cybernetic tower and other projects were of great interest to Mihai Olos. He was only happy to insert his own mark, a drawing that represents his essential structure, onto an open space in the chapter on cybernetics.

Even though for the artist living far from the capital there were no hopes to find sponsors or get funding for environmental sculptures, he could still receive at times invitations to send of his work to art shows abroad. Thus, Olos had the chance to send one of his sculptures to Japan, where it got into the collection of the [[Tokyo Fuji Art Museum|Fuji museum]]. Still, the artist felt the need to get personally in contact with the art world abroad. He was also frustrated because it was difficult to find among the artists living in [[Baia Mare]] partners to discuss with, in comparison with the four or five large cities in the country, like Timişoara etc. where young artists had succeed to have groups sharing their wish to change traditional arts and experiment.

Following the changes in the country's cultural policy after [[Nicolae Ceaușescu|Ceausescu's]] return from his visit to [[China]] in 1971, the artists would begin to use, like many of the writers in the country, the so-called “double language”. It was meant to evade the more and more severe censorship, but was perfectly understood by those who knew how to read between the lines. For the Romanian artists the adoption of other forms of art, many of them experimental, in consensus with the young critics, was in order to evade the officially accepted “socialist realism”. Alexandra Titu's well-researched book on the experimental arts in Romania after 1960 (published only in 2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Experimentul în arta româneascã dupã 1960|last=Titu|first=Alexandra|publisher=Editura Meridiane|year=2003|isbn=|location=Bucureşti|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives a full-extent image of the phenomenon.

It would be mistaken to think that Mihai Olos was content “to serve” just one teacher or master. His natural curiosity and his fight against the provincial complex had led to his determination to know as much as possible about the ideas haunting him and made him look for several sources of information. Among these, with the effect of a master class, was [[Bruno Munari]]'s ''Design e comunicatione visiva'', whose first version Olos must have seen in Italy and whose fourth edition he had received from a friend in 1972.{{efn|Bruno Munari, Design e comunicatione visiva Design e comunicatione visiva contributo a una metodologia didactica, Editori Laterz, Bari, 1972. It is not sure, though one may suppose that Olos must have seen the first edition of the book published in october 1968, not long after his arrival his in Italy. He will refer to Munari in his Murska-Sobota manifesto as well.}} The book had been written as a practical guide with many illustrations, resulting from the lectures [[Bruno Munari|Munari]], visiting professor at Harvard, had given at the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, in the spring of 1967. It had been already about computer graphics, modulation in four dimensions, Retrogardia, Avanguardia, optical effects, ambiguity, visual codes, impossible figures a.s.o.. Olos was shocked by the similitude between the module he had discovered and the serialization of cubic structures by two less known Dutch artists, Jan Slothouber and William Graatsma - a visually less impressive structure than the one the rattling spindle's knot had inspired him. Nevertheless, the principle that admits the proliferation of the module represented more evidently the idea of unity as well as that of inclusion. But he found also another type of combination of the basic elements, with the ends of the elements pointing outside, with a mouth-like opening or the end of the joint representing a cross. Other illustrations in [[Bruno Munari|Munari']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s book were representing experiments from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], or images of pavilions from the [[Expo 67|Montreal Expo]] of 1967.

The Romanian artist's interest in architecture made him approach the group of architects working in [[Baia Mare]] who had at their department office their “internal” informative publications. They willingly shared them with the young artist who had already seen with his eyes some of the great art monuments of the world.

In 1972 he succeeded to buy Michel Ragon's book about the world history of architecture connected to modern urbanism. Its second tome was referring to practices and methods during 1911-1971.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historie mondiale de l'architecture et de l'urbanisme modernes|last=Michel|first=Ragon|publisher=Casterman|year=1972|isbn=|volume=no.2 - Pratique et méthodes 1911-1971|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chapters presenting the most interest for the artist were those referring to urbanims and the recent approaches to it. In a sub-chapter referring to urbanism in the European “peoples democracies”(Poland, Romania, [[Czechoslovakia]] and Yugoslavia), Olos found references to the “industrialization of architecture” using prefabricates in the building of large living ensembles, like districts Floreasca-Tei in [[Bucharest]], the ensemble from Balta-Alba, built for 10,000 inhabitants, or architects N. Kepes' and N. Porumbescu's plans of urbanism, and those of Sully Bercovici in architecture. Among the new buildings from the Romanian capital, Ragon mentioned Ascanio Damian's grand round exhibition hall and the building of the State Circus by Porumbescu, Rula, Bercovici and Prunku. Cesar Lăzăresu's name appeared referring to the Mamaia open air theater. In another chapter Ragon mentioned Martin Pichis' research prospective.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A sub-chapter in Ragon's book of great interest to Olos was the one connecting urbanism and the environment, human geography, biology, ecology, zoology etc. This was again an opportunity to remember the wisdom that governed the organization of the rural communities' life so as to preserve the purity of their resources and avoid damaging the ecological balance. The artist became aware of the long-time danger of the pollution with exhaust gases from the local chemical combine. This brought about, later on, his more vocal protests against this chemical pollution as well as against the “pollution” of the traditional rural culture with implants from urban culture by the former peasants who commuted to their jobs in towns or cities. In order to attract people's attention to their connection with the ancestral agrarian culture from their country, besides the conferences he started in the countryside, Olos projected two new happenings meant to attract the participants in a kind of initiation ritual which, instead of telling them, would involve the participants emotionally and “show” them things connected both to their work but also to their ancient culture.

=== Second happening:“Gold and Wheat”(Herja, 1972) ===
His success in Italy got the dimension of a legend in [[Baia Mare]]. His decorative work in the local “Dacia” movie theatre, the echoes of his trip to Japan, his presence in the local press with articles as well as with poems in local anthologies, his studio open to his friends, admirers and visitors from all over the country and sometimes foreigners, made Mihai Olos visible in the eyes of the local community and gave him also a prestige in the eyes of the apparatchiks. At that time, most of these came from modest urban or rural backgrounds, some of them still catching up with their secondary school studies. Still, looking back at those times, it seems that the artist had the power of a mentalist or magician to convince the local authorities to accept his idea of a quite unusual or rather singular happening, the event “Herja” Mine (November 1972), then just mentioned in the local press, but with a wide national echo in later years.

The happening, at about 500 meter underground in the pit of the mine Herja, had been programmed by the artist during the miners' exchange of shifts. It consisted in the 25 ingots brought over from the Baia Mare subsidiary of the National Bank and set on a table covered with wheat grains in the form of the structure become now his module, Olos constructive pattern of the “universal city”. It is difficult to imagine the event's impact on the miners since besides the artist's glosses on Herja (the name of the mine), there was just another evasive article in the local press.

Apparently, it was a homage paid to the miners who had to work in the darkness under earth to bring up to light the precious metal and having never seen the ingots kept in banks. It was symbolically connecting their work to the agrarian myth of the grain and its cycles between death and life. Nevertheless, the event's subtext was certainly a hint to the many political prisoners who had worked and perished in the mines from the region during communism.

The way he used to experiment with the same idea as transposed in different media, the artist gave a painterly representation of the happening some years later. In comparison with the somewhat linear disposition of the miners in the photographic representation, in the painting the miners become a more compact group around the central point with the ingots. The strange thing is that the miners with the protection casks on their head recall the figures of the Italian futurists Boccioni and Marinetti from a 1915 photograph representing them in motorcycling costume and protective glasses on their caps, reproduced in Michel Ragon's book.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is difficult to tell whether this be just a coincidence sending the researcher just to the event's photographic representation, or whether it was intentional or just a trick played by the artist's remarkable visual memory.

=== Land art / Intervention:“The Earth”(Cuhea, 1973) ===
In the meantime, the artist had been experimenting with other materials besides wood – like foam, paper, hay, transparent Plexiglas, a.s.o.– in reproducing the same structure or variations of the module. One of those pieces made of foam for instance, in 1973, accommodates in the middle his little son and another module is held up by his daughter. The same motif will appear in the late '80s, in a painting with a woman and a man (a hint to Adam and Eve, or possibly to himself and his wife) entrapped among the 6 “clutches” of the totalitarian structure.

As an acknowledgment of his module originating in the folk architecture from Maramureş, ''Tribuna României –'' a multilingual monthly advertising Romanian realities to readers living abroad and severely criticized by the diaspora for its beautifying Romanian realities – published an article on Olos, entitled “Maramureş – a starting point of the planetary city”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anghel|first=Petre|date=1 December 1975|title=Entire journal|url=|journal=Tribuna României|volume=II, 26|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, his being advertised in this context, could have made the artist suspect in the eyes of the Romanians from the diaspora. And this is probably why he would be received with reserve by the members of the Romanians around Monica Lovinescu in Paris when visiting Paris.

Exploring the “negative” of the structure, the artist prepared a new happening, actually an experiment in land art entitled concisely as “The Earth”, in village Cuhea, in 1973. The digging up of earth so that the negative of the structure should remain in the pit, was another attempt for the artist to synchronize his art with that of the other experimental artists in the country and abroad. Though the personal legend he attaches to this earth-work later on, is his feeling of premonition regarding his father's death.

Some of his paintings dated also 1973, now in the collection of the Baia Mare Art Museum, illustrating the event bear the title of “Spatial construction I”,“Spatial construction II”, and “Ritual”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Centrul artistic Baia Mare 1896-1996|last=Alexa|first=Tiberiu|last2=Moldovan|first2=Traian|last3=Muscă|first3=Mihai|publisher=Muzeul Judeţean Maramureş|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same year 1973, he will accompany philosopher Constantin Noica (who had accepted in 1971 to become the artist's elder son's God father), on a ritual trip to Maramureș, reporting on their discussion in the local daily.

=== The 13th Colloquium of the “Mihai Eminescu” Society from Freiburg in [[Baia Mare]] ===
His knowledge of the region, seen also his articles on folk art and the folklore published in the local press made of Mihai Olos an excellent guide and discussion partner for visitors coming from the capital or abroad. One of these was Benjamin Suchoff from the Bartok Institute in New York, another the Japanese anthropologist mentioned before. This is why Mihai Olos had been asked to be the secretary of the folklore section in the conference the “Mihai Eminescu” society from the Freiburg University had organized together with the University of Iași, the Philology departments of the Suceava and Baia Mare Institutes of higher education. The theme of the symposium was “Maramureş, a model for the culture of south-eastern Europe”.

Besides the local participants, the organizers invited to [[Baia Mare]] first-rank personalities of the Romanian academia, such as ethnologist Mihai Pop, professor in [[Bucharest]], ethno-musician Harry Brauner a.s.o.. Among those coming from Germany were professors Klaus Heitman, Paul Miron and his assistant Elsa Lüder, and some of their students. While accompanying them on their visit to the countryside, Mihai Olos convinced them of his wide range of knowledge in various fields and need to be given new opportunities to further study. Besides, the university of Freiburg had a geographically favorable position to let him visit also the neighboring countries.

=== Art interventions:{{efn|Later on, the artist referred to them as “actions”, as it is seen in his Murska-Sobota Manifesto.}}“A Statue Ambles through Europe”(1974-1988) ===
At the end of 1974, with two small children and a pregnant wife, he was allowed to leave the country on a round trip, taking him through Yugoslavia, to Italy, France, Germany, Switzerland and Austria. And this had been also the starting point of his ritual journey that lasted some years “A Statue Ambles through Europe”.

The “declared” intention of his action-journey entitled “A statue ambles through Europe”– a parody of “a ghost ambles through Europe”, the well-known phrase from Marx and Engels' Manifesto of the Communist Party – was “ to confront” a scepter-sculpture made by Mihai Olos with the “values” of the European art from different countries, including also the happenings or incidents on the road. Nevertheless, the idea of these interventions could have been inspired by a political event. In March 1974, when Ceauşescu, besides being the Party's Prime secretary, in his wish to have absolute power, made himself elected also as president of the republic. Most of papers in the country published the photograph of the moment when the presidential scepter was handed over to him. The news had an international echo and Salvador Dalí sent a telegram to congratulate (most probably with an ironic intention) the communist leader for transforming the symbol of monarchy into that of a republic. Dali's telegram was republished in the party's daily and reproduced in other newspapers as well. The photographs with Mihai Olos raising his wooden scepter-sculpture above his head during his “interventions” on the road could be viewed as alluding to the leader and his travels abroad. Nevertheless, a later painting in which the artist represented the presidential couple dressed in peasants costume, with the leader holding as scepter Mihai Olos' sculpture with the knot of the spindle, has been interpreted as a compromise.

The action continued along the years, the artist's following journeys including the meetings at Rochamps, Vesuv, Olimpos, Acropole, the Arta and Bosporus bridges, Cappadochia, Gordion, Gaudi's works in Barcelona and “the meeting” with Joseph Beuys, though never shown in its entire development, and ended with the picture taken at the rune stone from Felling in Denmark (1988).

=== Paris - an unfulfilled promise ===
[[File:Sculpture in stone by Mihai Olos.jpg|alt=Sculpture in stone by Mihai Olos|thumb|Sculpture in stone by Mihai Olos]]
The artist's travel to France and his contact with all that Paris could offer in the field of art, including his beloved painters Matisse, Picasso, Braque etc. and most of all to see [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] heritage meant a lot to him. Traveling via Germany, Olos arrived in Paris with Constantin Noica's recommendations finding accommodation at one of the philosopher's cousins. Nevertheless, he was lucky to find in Paris the famous historian of religions and writer Mircea Eliade, to whom he had been recommended by Petru Comarnescu some years before, when the critic organized the exhibitions promoting Ţuculescu's paintings in the United States. Mihai Olos met the most important representatives of the diaspora as introduced to them by Mircea Eliade. Among them, Emil Cioran, Moninca Lovinescu and Virgil Ierunca, the couple whose programs broadcast by Free Europe or articles in the French or diaspora press were harshly critical as regards the Romanian leader's policy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lovinescu|first=Monica|date=12 July 1973|title=Tribuna ipocriziei|url=|journal=Limite|location=Paris|volume=|pages=1–2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; unmasking the impoverishment of the population, the control of their possessions and income with new trials and imprisonments. The response to these broadcasts had been the sending of agents to threaten the members of the diaspora and Monica Lovinescu being almost killed in 1977 by a bomb hidden in a package addressed to her.

Among the most important for the artist meetings in Paris had been his discovery of the work of two Romanian philosophers, Ştefan Odobleja – whose Consonantist Psychology in two volumes published in 1938 and 1939 he brought home to study – and Ştefan Lupaşcu&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=L'énergie et la matière phsychique|last=Lupasco|first=Stéphane|publisher=Juillard|year=1974|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom he visited and whose theories about the psychic system and the importance of contradiction and antagonism, the structure of the system of systems etc. had a great impact on the artist's thinking.

== Theories on art and first recognition as a conceptual artist ==
“Rostirea”(“the utterance”) as concept and constructive principle

Still in the sixties, during philosopher Constantin Noica's visit to a friend in [[Baia Mare]], Mihai Olos had been introduced to him and became one of his admirers, though not one of the “philosophers' pupils”. Nevertheless, the artist found in Noica's references to what he called the “Romanian philosophical utterance” a biblical term he will use from now on, i.e.“rostirea”(utterance),{{efn|he English translation “utterance” does not convey the connotations of the Romanian “rostirea”.}} instead of the common and restrictive term “language”, in insisting upon the primordiality of the spoken/oral aspect. Olos used the word “rostirea” in its meaning of “joining”, corresponding to the combining of concrete elements so as to form a whole. This was also an opportunity for the fond of word games artist to engage into finding a pair to the word, namely “rotirea”–“turning round”–, suggesting the circular movement of the spindle. Thus, if “rostirea” was referring to the elementary structure he had discovered in the little wooden knot on the wheel at the end of the spindle representing an atomic image of the world,“rotirea” was referring to its revolving around, reproducing the planets' motions. Though the artist knew about the philosophy of structuralism, he preferred to adhere to constructivism, and its connection to architecture. Nevertheless,“Rosturi” will become title of some of his paintings with “progressions”, during the sixties.

=== The knot – key element of Olos' art ===
[[File:Mihai Olos Sculpture Exhibition.jpg|alt=Mihai Olos Sculpture Exhibition|thumb|'''Mihai Olos Sculpture Exhibition''']]
If in his childhood the future artist had unconsciously registered the colors, forms and structures present in his environment – the geometrical elements in the carpets and rugs and also in the decorative elements, on the geometrically cut items of clothing, in religious paintings and architecture – in his first wooden sculpture he reproduced the knot-structure of the spindle consciously of its artistic value. Later on he will discover or consciously look for such structures in other artists' work. In this respect, his contact with Italian art had been extremely important. He had become more attentive to details and the geometrical elements appearing in figurative painting as well. His readings at his return home will only clarify his observations.

Since his graduation, as a teacher at the people's art school and as occasional speaker at the people's university in [[Baia Mare]], Mihai Olos continued to publish in the local press about folk art, comments on artists' shows, interviews and book reviews, alongside with his “glosses” on art, informing the readers about contemporary art and about his own projects. One of these glosses had been given a generous space in the local daily's supplement and was entitled “Urbanism”.{{efn|Recorded in the section “Artiole publicate”, in Ana Olos: Mihai Olos. A Chronological Bibliography. Unpublished typescript}} Seen in retrospect, it has an evident relation to what was going on in the country in the process of forced urbanization. But the idea of the “universal city” the artist will later on call “Olospolis”– that may be compared to the western “counter-architecture”– had been locally accepted due to its exulting a symbolic structure having its origin in the ancient peasant wooden architecture.

In Ragon's book, in he chapter about a new type of architecture referring to new techniques, he read about A. Foppl's old notion of “reticular structure”(1882), Graham Bell's experimenting in Canada with “floating” structures composed tetrahedrons, and about Robert Le Ricolais' essay on reticular systems in three dimensions, as a new language in architecture. The tridimensional, or bi-, tri- or quadri-directional structures realized of different materials have a knot which is the key element of spatial structures. The idea, as important as it had been, brought no fame and recognition to the unknown French architect (b. 1894) though his influence on avanguard architecture should be considered as important as that of Buckminaster-Fuller's who emigrated to the US in 1951, to teach at the university of Pennsylvania. Olos was also impressed by Le Ricolais' use of topologie and mathematics. Besides stressing the importance of the noed / the knot as basic constructive module, there were some convincing illustrations like maquettes for spatial and mobile cities by Yona Friedman, Ph. Lucien Hervé, Walter Jonas's maquette for an “intrapolis” or Isozaki's and Ph.O. Murai's spatial structure,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; references to electric urbanism, Inis Xenakis' publishing his project for a “cosmic city”, and even Dan Giuresco's inclusion with his “Alpha city”,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; that became important sources for further meditations.

But it will be in Gustave René Hocke's book about mannerism Die Welt als Labyrinth he read in Romanian translation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lumea ca labirint. Manieră şi manie în arta europeană. De la 1520 pînă la 1650 şi în prezent.|last=Hocke|first=René|publisher=Editura Meridiane|year=1973|isbn=|location=Bucureşti|pages=|translator-last=Adrian|translator-first=Victor}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he found some comments on Leonardo to confirm many of his ideas concerning the deeper meanings of the structure he had discovered and its being a cultural archetype. In the chapter entitled “Maps of the mystery”(172 et passim) he finds mentioned Leonardo's only six knitted- or braided-drawings similar to those that he had seen on the fresco decorating the ceiling of the Sforza castle in Milan. It was evident that Leonardo had used some abstract configurations as organizing principles of the intricate chaotic lines underlying the variety of forms in the visible universe, suggesting universal harmony. In the following chapter about the roundabout ways to reach the central point (176-181) Olos discovered the existence of such labyrinthine structures in the oldest cultures beginning with the stone age as well as in the medieval cathedrals as archetypes of salvation. But it was Leonardo with whom the abstract intertwined labyrinth had become a map of the world's mystery, a criptographic symbol of the cosmological representation of the “knotted” universe. The idea originating from Gnosticism reappears in the neo-Platonism of the Renaissance in different philosophical and metaphysical contexts (174). Hocke quotes Dante who considered that even God could be symbolized by those “nodi strani”. He also quotes the occult experiments with knots, threads or bands the artist knew so well from the old magic practices and interdictions in the villages where he had lived or visited later. He had seen the spindle used not only for spinning but also in magic rituals still alive. But Hocke reminded him that words and names were also knots.

Among the references in the chronology at the end of Ragon's book, the artist underlined Lewis Mumford's The Story of Utopias that hints at the fact that he himself considered the idea of a universal city for the time being just a utopia. He underlined with red Einstein's theory of the unitary space (champ) reminding that he had made some notes on the physicist's theory of relativity. Olos underlines as important for him also Le Corbusier's plan for a linear industrial city in Alger and the “Modulor”, Buckmister Fuller with his first geodesic domes, or J. C. Bernard's obtaining the Prix de Rome for his project for a “total city”(ville totale).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Le Corbusier's death in 1965 is encircled in a special frame. As the year coincides with his own first experiments with the structure, Mihai Olos used to tell about a premonitory dream he had had on the night of Corbusier's death. Anyhow, whether it was a true remembrance or just something conveniently imagined,“si non e vero, e ben trovato” as it is said in Italian.

Writing about Urbanism, semantics, semiology, mathematics and information theory, Ragon mentioned G. Kepes', Langue de la vision, published in 1944. But more important than this should be Module. Proportion. Symmetry, Rhythm, a richly illustrated book Gyorgy Kepes edited in 1966&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Module. Proportion. Symmetry, Rhythm|last=Kepes|first=Gyorgy|publisher=George Braziller|year=1966|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and owned by Olos. He read the book in the second half of the sixties and it contains the artist's marginal notes in pencil, and translations of the captions of the illustrations. Among the contributors to Kepes' book, Phillip Morrison writes about the modularity of knowledge (1-19), Stansilav Ulam comments upon the growth patterns of figures, on mathematical aspects of modular idea in science and arts etc.(64-101), Richaer P. Lohse's “Standard, Series, Module: New Problems and Tasks of Painting”(128-1610. Anthony Hill writes about the structural syndrome in constructive art (162-173), the volume including also comments on the music of Béla Bartok and John Cage, etc..

As a conclusion to his readings and personal meditations, the artist will publish his own ideas about urbanism first in the local paper and its literary and art supplement Maramureş, refer to them in his interviews and later on summarize them in his Murska-Sobota Manifesto 55.

First recognition as a conceptual artist in the Bucharest show “Art and the city”(1974)

After Petru Comarnescu's death, among the young critics closer to the new generation of artists had been Mihai Drişcu. He would be one of the new commentators and supporters of Mihai Olos' art, inviting him to the shows he organized in [[Bucharest]]. The ample exhibitions “Art and the City” which echoed the idea of the relationship between art and the environment included Mihai Olos with paintings, sculptures, maquettes and projects of his future work, as a first recognition of its importance.

The subversive message of the show was directed against the project of systematization launched by the regime at the beginning of 1973. As an echo of the party's national conference, Professor of architecture, Cezar Lăzărescu, Rector of the “Ion Mincu” Institute of architecture had tried to give a theoretical foundation to the conception and principles of this long-time project in an article published in the party's Central Committee's theoretical and socio/political magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lăzărescu|first=Cezar|date=1973|title=Sistematizarea teritoriului – concepţie şi principii|url=|journal=Era socialistã|volume=1/LIII|pages=45–47|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The way Mihai Olos had underlined in red pencil some of the ideas in the article and his marginal notes show his reserve as concerns the rather superficial presentation of the topic with no reference to what was happening in other countries.

=== Art Interventions at the Brâncuși Centenary and in the Sighetu Marmaţiei Ethnographic Museum (1976) ===
After his return from Bucharest, the artist continued to work in order to prepare another show. The following year, in 1976, on the occasion of the Centenary of [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] birth, the American sculptor and [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi]] scholar Athena Tacha Spear – whose book on [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] Birds had been published in the meantime by the Meridiane Press – was expected to come and visit Maramureş.

Together with his friend, poet Dumitru Iuga (Ion Bogdan), Mihai Olos prepared a special publication entitled Măiastra in homage to [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi]] to be taken to Bucharest and be distributed among the participants to the events of the Centenary. Besides quotes from acknowledged critics' books or articles on the great sculptor and some of the great sculptors' memorable sayings, the issue contained Mihai Olos' homage to Petru Comarnescu, a collection of poems dedicated to the Master's birds along with folk poetry from Maramures about birds translated into English by his wife, Ana. The illustrations underlined the same idea, alternating images of [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] sculptures with samples of folk art from Maramures, wooden churches and carvings. Among them, the large photo of two rattling spindles suggested a relationship between them and [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] Endless Column. The message of Mihai Olos' article “Between Maramureş and Brâncuşi” was also the connection between Romanian folk art and [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] work. Though not mentioning Sidney Geist's name, Olos was actually hinting at the controversy between the American critic who denied any connection between the great sculptor's work and Romanian folk art. Olos' explanation was that the critics who denied [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] roots were doing it because, living in an urban environment, they simply did not understand what the Romanians meant by folk art. And he was only right, for the confusion must have originated in the translation into English of the Romanian “artă populară”(folk art) by “popular art”, that was instantly associated with the American “popular culture” referring actually to an urban “sub-culture”. The publication of Măiastra was meant as a manifesto underlyning the great sculptor's genuine Romanian roots and in the same time advertising the county of Maramureş as a space in which the culture of wood was still alive and could be a source of inspiration for contemporary artists.

In 1976, the centenary was planned and organized by the Party Committee of Gorj county in order to make critics focus their comments on the “Endless Column” and the “Table of Silence” in Tg. Jiu, the only treasures the country could offer in order to show that [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi]] belonged to the Romanian culture.

After the trip to Tg. Jiu, the American sculptor and professor Athena Tacha Spear, as she had promised, came to Maramureş and visited also Ethnographic Museum in Sighet. Though the Olos' paintings and sculptures were listed and some of them reproduced in a separate catalog, they were actually scattered among the regular exhibits of the museum. Putting down her impressions in order to be included later on a separate sheet in the catalog, Athena T. Spear was describing the way Olos' work, after a first moment of confusion, made viewers realize the similitude and differences between the artist's paintings and the patterns on folk textiles and rugs, as well as the relationship between the sculptures and the utilitarian objects made of wood still in use in the villages of Maramureş. Among the exhibits there was also a guash representing Olos' project for the universal city, superimposed on Le Corbusier's project for Algiers.

=== The 1977 Earthquake in Bucharest ===
The beginning of March 1977 found Mihai Olos in a hotel in [[Bucharest]]. In January he had participated at a round table about winter customs in the countryside and a reporter of the Contemporanul cultural magazine published an interview with him. He was preparing again to leave for Germany.

On the 4th of March he went to visit his friend sculptor Ion Vlasiu who – as the artist would later remember – told him about a strange dream he had had during the night and his bad forebodings. The unpleasant feeling transmitted to the young artist was accompanied by the sight of Vlasiu's sculpture whose theme was war. It was only in the evening that the explanation of their unpleasant feelings got an answer. The terrible earthquake caught Mihai Olos in his hotel room. He was witnessing how the walls split apart in the midst of the shrieks of those running in the corridor on the shattered glass splinters. He was lucky to escape alive though deeply marked, like all the other survivors, by this closeness of death. During the night, and on his way on foot to the airport, in the morning, he had witnessed the apocalyptic sight of the city. This cauchemaresque experience had a longtime effect on the artist.

=== Meetings with Joseph Beuys at Kassel Documenta 6 (1977)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fessler|first=Helga|date=September 1978|title=Un român la Documenta|url=|journal=Prisma|volume=No. 9|pages=33|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olos|first=Mihai|date=1978|title=Kassel – Documenta 6|url=|journal=Arta|location=Bucureşti|volume=XXV /4|pages=34–35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sacks|first=Schelley|date=1978|title=Confruntări internaţionale – Universitatea liberă|url=|journal=Perla|volume=No.5-6|pages=78–79|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Düsseldorf happening (1980) ===
[[File:Mihai Olos și Joseph Beuys.jpg|alt=Mihai Olos and Joseph Beuys at Giessen University|200px|thumb|Mihai Olos and Joseph Beuys at Giessen University]]
After the terrible spring when many of the artist's friends had found their death in the earthquake, Mihai Olos decided he had to go by any means to the Kassel Documenta 6. The international art event was limited to 100 days, since midsummer to the beginning of October. That year the number of participants was 655, including some of the greatest artists, such as Francis Bacon, Marcel Duchamp, Sol LeWit, Lucio Fontana, Nam June Pike and many others, and there were 2700 exhibits. The Documenta featured the first international telecast by artists and some of the performances were to be transmitted to over 25 countries. One of the greatest attraction of the Documenta was the Free International University where the famous conceptual artist Joseph Beuys was addressing directly the participants elaborating on his theory of “social sculpture”, crucial for his art project. Olos had already become an admirer of Beuys' art when he saw one of the German artist's drawings on a crumpled piece of paper at a museum in Paris.

Arrived in Kassel, Olos did not hesitate to approach the famous German artist. During one of Beuys's seminars, he took the chance to draw on a blackboard the sketch of his own project of the universal city. Without a proper knowledge of any international language, still he was able to expose his theory of the Universal City so as to be understood by the participants. Afterwards, he proudly used to quote the German artist who, looking at his drawing had exclaimed:“Finally, an artist!”. The blackboard with Olos' drawing was included – with Beuys having drawn over it a swan – in the installation with blackboards entitled “The Capital”(hinting at Marx) shown at the next Venice Biennial and reproduced in Beuys' booklet entitled Das Kapital Raum 1970-77.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Das Kapital Raum 1970-77. Strategien zur Reaktivierung der Sinne Von Franz-Joachim Verspol Mit Fotos von Ute Klophaus|last=Beuys|first=Joseph|publisher=Fischer|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=fig. 3 p. 8 and fig. 41, p.64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another meeting with Beuys was in Düsseldorf, on 26 June 1980, when Olos asked the German artist to make an intervention on one of his work. Accepting, Beuys cut off some spindle-knots from one of the Romanian artist's sculptures. The intervention had been recorded on photos.

The artist will describe his experience at Documenta 6 in an article published in Romanian Arta,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{efn|and commented upon in his interview with Mariana Ioescu in Romania Today, No.2/1980, p. 60, 62. The reporter quotes from the artist's“Meditations on a Spindle”. The magazine reproduces photographs with Beuys and from the opening of Olos' show in Giessen}} in 1978, while his meetings with Beuys and his parting from Beuys could be found in two of his notebooks, after Beuys' death in January 1986.

=== An Interlude:Analysis of the Structure”. The Study – Bastion Art Galleries, Timişoara (April–May 1978)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Studiul - Catalogue|last=|first=|publisher=Uniunea Artiştilor Plastici din România şi Comitetul de Culturã şi Educaţie a Judeţului Timiş|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
One of the important collective shows in which the artist had been included among the most representative artists alive was the thematically entitled Studiul, jointly organized by the Union of the Plastic Artists from Romania and the Cultural and Educational Committee of Timiş County. The catalog has three introductory statements. After Titus Moroccan's “Art as Study”(a.1-3), with rather dry and unimaginative considerations about the theme, Andrei Plexus's short essay “About Study”(a.5-6) contains unusual for the epoch reflections about various rituals eastern and western artists used to perform when preparing for the act of creation. Among the one's Pleşu mentions are the “dhyana”, prayers, later influences of the tantric way, or what the alchemists had called “the humid way”(i.e. the consumption of alcohol, drugs, etc.), Salvador Dalí being the only one quoted from among the contemporary artists to follow such practices. Coriolan Babeţi – the local organizer – glosses (“Studiu despre studiu”, a.7-11) on the origin of the word and the evolution of the concept along the centuries, stressing the importance of “study” especially for the conceptual artists. He shows how important study had become in the process of communication during the nineteen sixties and seventies, and how drawing had been included in shows like Documenta 3 ( 1964) and Documenta 6 (1977), or the International Exhibition of Drawing from Darmstadt (1970). These observations must have remained in the artist's mind and may have unconsciously led him to give more importance to his drawings and open his own show “Continuous Drawing” a decade later.

Another important thing to observe is that the organizers of Studiul had divided the living artists into seven categories: 1. Utopia as an investment for research; 2. Analyses of the structure; 3. Symbolic configurations; 4. Conceptualizing forms of visual perception; 5.The depth of memory signified in the image; 6. The study of nature and ways of interpretation; 7. Integration and implication in the social space. Mihai Olos was included in the second group, together with other fourteen artists, among them, just to mention a few, were Şerba Epure, Mihai Horea, Toma Roatã, Doru Tulcan etc.. Nevertheless, in the catalog, with the artists arranged in an alphabetical order, there is no comment attached to the illustration reproducing one of Mihai Olos' oil paintings “Structure Study”(c.28, the only explanation being that he had not sent it to be exhibited).

=== Lectureship in Germany. Solo shows in Wickstad and Giessen.“A Homage to Rilke”– performance and film ===
Some art professors seeing Olos's presentation at Beuys' seminar, invited him for a “Lehrautrag” at the “Justus Liebig” university in Giessen. He spent there a semester teaching seminars to the students and working on his new sculptures. This was an important stage in the artist's evolution. The position of visiting artist with a generous allowance permitted him a longer stay. The contact with the students and their professors, as well as with some fellow artists, allowed him to better understand the western artists' relationship with their public. Mo rover, he had been given a place where to work and wood for his sculptures. After his stay in Italy this was one of the best periods for his work.

The shows he opened at Wickstadt, in 1978, and then in the town-hall in Giessen, in 1980, had been well-received and commented on in the German press and also in the Bucharest German Embassy's monthly ''Prisma''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fessler|first=Helga|date=Summer 1980|title=Expoziție Mihai Olos|url=|journal=Prisma|volume=XII| issue = 7|pages=35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But there had been also articles published in Romanian newspapers and journals.

Wanda Mihuleac (who with a high rank father had a privileged situation), retells in a recent interview&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWClg_f47Vg|title=Mărturii XXI|last=Mihuleac|first=Wanda|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; how Mihai Olos, on his return from Germany (probably in 1980), came one day to her studio to show a film made on the occasion of his happening dedicated to Rilke's memory. The film showed the artist and his partner both nude, giving each other roses with long thorny stalks which at times drew blood. The following morning, Wanda Mihuleac was called to the securitate and was reprimanded for letting such a film be shown at her place. They had been only five persons the night before, good friends, and so one of them proved to be an informer.

== A dark decade for the artist that ends well (1980-1989) ==

=== Happening:“Against pollution”(Baia Mare, December 1979) ===
[[File:Mihai Olos Happening.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Mihai Oloș Happening (1980)]]
Though cured of his lung disease, the artist had breathing problems whenever the Baia Mare chemical plant exhausts poisoned gases in the air. Besides the various constatative articles published by researches of the phenomenon of environmental pollution with chemical exhausts and mining residues, Olos was the first artist to protest in his articles published in the local paper. Nevertheless, his 1979 happening in [[Baia Mare]] he entitled “Against pollution”, consisted in his sweeping the wheat grains which carried to or from a neighboring mill had fallen from a truck earlier in the morning and scattered on the carriage way in the street facing his studio. The artist told to a journalist the story of how it happened: a pigeon with a grain in its beak attracted his attention to the criminal waste of the precious wheat, associated in peasants' mind in with gold, as a solar symbol.

The artist's longer stay in Germany, his contact with artists and especially his meeting Joseph Beuys had been a great gain for Mihai Olos not only as an artist but also as a human being, getting an insight into western human relations, learning about democracy and, last but not least, about the opportunities western artists enjoyed for their developing their art. Still, he could not decide to deflect, though after the scandal produced by the head of the Romanian secret service, Mihai Pacepa's deflection, it became clear that things in the country were going to deteriorate and it would be more difficult to leave the country from then on.

Ceuşescu's re-election as president of the “socialist republic”, and his picture holding the scepter being reproduced on the first page of the Artists Union's review Arta (3/1980), seemed to put an end to any hope for change. The artist and his family, with the three children growing, had material difficulties and the artist himself had to look again for a job. This was when, being sure that the painting would be bought, he made the faux pas to paint the presidential couple in the context of his universal city putting in the dictator's hand his version of the scepter. Moreover, he had the bad inspiration to publish the painting's photo in a folklore almanac – Calendarul Maramureşului – he edited together with his friends Dumitru Iuga and Nicoară Timiş. Though viewed by some of the artist's nowadays critics as a concession to the regime, the consequences had been actually the reverse than expected. Another faux pas viewed in retrospect, was his relationship with poet Adrian Păunescu and the artist's acceptance to sing in one of the Flacăra shows organized by the poet. In 1982 he was awarded the Flacăra prize by the magazine patronized by the poet who, as seen after the change in 1989, was brandished as one of the dictator's main flatterers.

With his travels abroad Mihai Olos was under the securitate's surveillance since his travel to Italy .{{efn|As recorded in his CNSAS file on show at his Bucharest retrospectiv exhibition entitled -- with one of his code names from the file –“The Ephemerist” at MNAC, in [[Bucharest]] (2016-17)}}Olos' art intervention journey with the scepter statue must have been also watched and commented upon in the informers' reports. The relationship between the artist's journey and the painting in which the artist had dared to put his own statue in the president's hand could have been interpreted both ways: either as a flattery or as an insolence. It was a period when many intellectuals had become informers and consequently the younger generation agents were chosen and trained so as to understand the language of the artists they were watching. Some of these were first served in bookshops with books and albums common people had few chances to lay hands on. So one can expect that some of these had the pretense to be literary and art critics as well. And what a chance for them to discover subtleties and suggest interpretations they considered valid. In their case there was also the feeling of the power to aid or destroy an artist's career which must have played an important part in their reports, sometimes as a compensation of their own frustration to play a part behind the stages. And one may suppose that Mihai Olos' lack of discretion in showing off with his successes must have offended their feelings on many occasions.

=== The tall poppy syndrome ===
With Ceauşescu's developing megalomania and his idea that the country's external debts should be paid, the economic situation deteriorated and the surveillance system increased, even if the methods used to reprimand any attempt to criticize the regime have become more sophisticated.

In 1983, the local daily from Baia Mare, published a Bucharest reporter's extremely nasty article meant to demolish Mihai Olos's intellectual prestige as an artist. The pretext had been the artist's article in which he had called the traditional Christmas caroling in the country-side as a “begging-ritual”. It is hard to say whether the artist had really intended to hint at the terrible poverty of the population, but someone certainly did find a relationship.

The artist so successful abroad and thus too visible in the local context had become dangerous, especially because his influence on his group of admirers. His studio, visited by many great personalities from Romania along the years since he moved in it, had become a meeting place for young poets and artists who saw in these meetings an opportunity to feel free. The article's true aim had been to compromise or rather destroy his status as an opinion leader and authority by shattering their confidence in his professional status, trying to suggest that he was just an impostor, a drunkard with rude manners. Even if some of those who knew well the artist showed their indignation, the local daily did not publish any response to this article.

With his family's increasing financial difficulties, in 1980 he succeeded to get back his teaching job at the people's university. As he was unable to resist more than two semesters, he applied for a curator position at the county museum. But his contract was severed in the summer of 1984, being left with no personal income.

=== Eros in the Universal City: The “Mandragora” series of paintings /“The Grass Inferno” ===
In the meantime he returned for a while to painting in the hope to sell at least some of his work. But what he had started as a desperate effort to get rid of his memories of the earthquake developed in a series or rather cycle of closely connected canvases on the theme of an ancient ritual that had been described by Mircea Eliade in his History of Religions but was still alive in Maramureș. Mihai Olos would show a part of this new thematic cycle of 44 acrylic paintings illustrating the ancient rite of the Mandrake at the Museum of Romanian Literature in [[Bucharest]]. In her comment on the show, entitled “The Grass Inferno”, critic Olga Buşneag wrote about the artist and performer's return on a higher level to his first show imbued with folk rites and magic, adding his knowledge of contemporary art and his own experimenting. According to the critic, Olos imagines a planetary erotic scenario of the pagan ritual of the picking of mandragora in a stream-fresco of violent blue bodies on the green blaze of the grass, recreating a Walpurgis night blended with a Garden of Delights. She sees in these paintings a “dialogue” between the Pollockian intricacies of the winding lines and the simplicity of human figuration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buşneag|first=Olga|date=1983|title=Olos în infernul de iarbă|url=|journal=Arta|volume=XXX, 12|pages=30|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All these paintings had a small image of his module as the artist's signature. Moreover, as some of the witnesses who saw the pieces of the paintings arranged on the floor of the artist's stdio like the pieces of a completed puzzle, with the white lines covering the background images like laser beams crossing each other and drawing the outline of a sketch of the Universal City, the whole should be viewed from above.{{efn|According to Ana Olos' conclusion to what she learned from the Baia Mare artist Liviu Rața who had tried to reconstitute the overall image from the extant photographs.}}
[[File:Mihai Olos - ceramics.jpg|alt=Mihai Olos - ceramics|thumb|Mihai Olos - ceramics]]

=== The Module in Ceramics ===
In 1984 Mihai Olos participated in a pottery symposium held at the local factory in [[Baia Mare]] that would lead to other experimentation. The most remarkable among the pieces created there, with its image illustrating Gheorghe Vida's article on the symposium, was a representation of his planetary city's module on colored ceramic plates .{{efn|The plates have been saved by painter Nicolae Suciu from the ruis of the former “Faimar” factory and installed as a decoration on the wall facing the entrance hall of the building housing the art section of the Faculty of Letters,#20, Crişan street, Baia Mare. Information in Ana Olos.}} The three dimensional pieces are smaller, made each of the two extant of detachable elements of the module installed on a round plate. Another round plate had on it the severed head of John the Baptist.

With no chances to get on otherwise, the artist tried to get again a passport to leave for Germany. On September 7, 1984, in a note (No. 5344/7.09.1984) addressed to the passport service of the Home Ministry's inspectorate from Baia Mare, Viorel Mărginean, then president of the Romanian Artists Union, was recommending Mihai Olos for a 90 days study trip to Germany, in order to collect his sculptures and paintings left behind in Giessen and open with them his personal shows in Berlin, France and Italy. It is shown that he has no access to state documents, presents moral and political guarantees, while the trustee for the payment of this debts to the Artists Union was his wife.

=== Continuous Drawing as Therapy (1987) ===
[[File:Drawing by Mihai Olos.jpg|alt=Drawing by Mihai Olos|thumb|Drawing by Mihai Olos]]
At his return from Germany, with the situation becoming more and more oppressive and his health deteriorating, the artist decided to quit smoking making of this another happening, since as a cure of chain-smoking, he will be chain-drawing, to prove that artistic gesture can replace a vicious habit, being a therapy through art. The opening was planned as a homage to [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi]] on the 111th anniversary of his birth, in February 1987 and the show consisted in 1275 ink drawings of various dimensions. They drawings for the show had been selected by the members of the family from the thousands of drawings he had made along the years, according to certain themes suggested by the artist. Among them were portraits, nudes, human and animal figures, sketches for his paintings or sculptures, of his past or future projects, such as his project for a monument of Voevod Bogdan of Maramureş (of which there had been also tridimensional pieces made of clay) made later on by one of the younger sculptors, and naturally, of his Universal City. Some of these drawings were ironic or humorous. The artist would continue his drawing all his lifetime, in his later years learning also computer design.

As concerns the fate of his drawings, some of them had been reproduced in literary or art magazines during the artist's lifetime, scattered pieces or whole booklets appropriated by the visitors of his studio, later on reproduced without permission.

=== Sculptures and paintings in Nijmeegs Museum 'Commanderie van Sint-Jan'(Netherlands, 1989) ===
As G. Lemmens, the museum director states in his Foreword to the excellent bilingual, fully illustrated exhibition catalog,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mihai Olos. Houten en schilderijen. Holzskulpturen und Bilder|last=van der Grinten|first=Hans|publisher=Nijmeegs Museum 'Commanderie Sint-Jan”|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the museum had intended to organize an exhibition with Mihai Olos' 1976 “Progressions”(Rosturi) in 1987. Besides a presentation of the artist, the first section of the catalog contains the Dutch and German versions of Mihai Olos' article “Between Maramureş and Brâncuşi” he had written for the Centenary. Hans van der Grinten's comments on the exhibits – a selection of the artist's best sculptures (46 pieces) and paintings (37) illustrating also his concept of the Universal City, stressing their connection both with the culture of his native county and the art of his great predecessor. The exhibits were a prof not only of the visual beauty of his work, but gave a real insight into the possibilities of future development of his project for what he called his Olospolis.

Due to the historical events that occupied people and the press those days – the fall of the Berlin wall in November, the dissolution of the Soviet block and the revolution in Romania in December – Olos' show in Nijmeeg had just a feeble echo. The artist had to return in his home-country without having the opportunity to enjoy the success of the exhibition.

'''Work in Germany - Shows Abroad (1992-2015)'''

By the end of 1992, after an enthusiastic episode of involvement in politics in support of the National Christian Democratic Peasants Party, utterly disappointed of the outcomes and discontent with the situation at home, decided to settle in Germany, though not giving up his workshop at the painters center in [[Baia Mare]]. But as his friend Paul Neagu had told Olos' son Constantin visiting him in London,{{efn|Constantin Olos, Letter from London (1993) to Ana Olos.}} the idea to settle in a village in south-eastern Germany, rather isolated from the great art centers, was not the best place for the artist to make himself known. With all the previous success he had had in Germany, paradoxically, an overview of the artist's portfolio of the following decades seems to show that Paul Neagu had been right. Not that the artist did not continue his work. But he lacked the contact with his many friends and admirers from his native country. Therefore, he used to return in [[Baia Mare]] from time to time, continuing to exhibit at the regional shows and collaborating with articles in the local papers and literary magazines in the country.

Following his decision to stay and work in Germany, Olos married his longtime supporter, translator and secretary in Germany, Ms Helga Fessler, graduate of Romance languages at the University of Freiburg, whom he had first met in Romania during the seventies. He continued to work on his project realizing other modules of smaller dimension.

Adapting to the new technologies, he learned computer design and this made him pass to the practice of digital art. Nevertheless, this was actually continuing his experiments with the module in another medium. Besides, especially when his health began to decline, the medium he adopted was paper, creating a great number of origami-like small modules.

=== The “ Berlin Golden Tripod” and poetry at Wiepersdorf Artists Castle (1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fessler|first=Helga|date=1993|title=Tripodul de aur de la Berlin. Mihai Olos la Wiepersdorf|url=|journal=Prisma|volume=XXV| issue = 1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
In the autumn of 1992, invited to stay at the literary institute housed in Wipersdrof Castle, Mihai Olos work on a new project, he entitled this time '''“ A statue sits in Europe”''', inspired by the idea of the three-legged golden bridge “Deutschland”, a symbol of the unification of Germany. He exposed his ideas to the those who were at the Schloss and made a series of large paintings illustrating his ideas, one of them included in Hans van der Grienten's collection at Moyland Castel.

Mihai Olos had written and recited poems ceaselessly since his youth, some of them published in various literary magazines and anthologies, but those he collected in a volume remained unpublished till his death. He, like his friend the acclaimed poet Nichita Stănescu, used even to dictate his poems to members of his audience. Thus, while working at the Wiepersdorf Schloss, he had a close collaboration in writing poetry in German with the acknowledged poet Lioba Happel. The poems written together have been published in the 6th section of Lioba Happel's volume Der Schlaf über Eis{{efn|The poems were first published as: Lioba Happel.“ Das kalte Prinzip. 12 Gedichten nach gemeinsamen Niederschriften von Gesprächen mit Mihai Olos. Neue Literatur, 1/1994. Then in book form: Lioba Happel. Der Schlaf überm Eis. Gedichte. Schöffing &amp;Co. Frankfurt am Main, 1995,“Das kalte Prinzip. In Zuzammenarbeit mit Mihai Olos”, p.53-67.}}

=== Solo show in Vác – Hungary ===
On the 4th of July 1992 Olos gave a performance “Poetica” in the Hungarian town Vác. The success of it made Jozsef Bárdosi, art historian and curator at the Greek Church Museum, organize a solo show with Olos' work, authoring also the exhibition catalog. The show opened on the 16th of October 1993, and among those present had been also a group of the artist's friends coming from Baia Mare. Bárdosi gave an overview of Olos' life and work –“Turning structure into myth – On the sculptures of Mihai Olos”, included quotes about the artist and from his statements, photos and reproductions of his work listed in the bilingual catalog. A comparison with the Nigmeegs exhibition catalog shows that sculptures and paintings on show were mostly the same, though less in number. Olos' painting “The double Bridge”( 1975) is listed as already belonging to the Dutch museum. This was the artist's last grand show during his lifetime.

=== Included in important group shows in Romania ===
Less is known about his work in the periods when he returned to his studio in [[Baia Mare]]. Most probably he painted to exhibit at the yearly or seasonal, regional and local art shows, as their catalogs record his presence, spending the rest of the time socializing with his friends in town or visiting those in the countryside.

The way the organizers included him as a sign of recognition in thematic shows while still residing in Romania – e.g.“Tapestry – Wood”(Bucharest, 1973, curator M. Oroveanu), the aforementioned “Studiul” in Timişoara, or “ Place, Deed and Metaphor”(Village Museum, Bucharest, 1983), he appeared as a representative artist in the show critic Alexandra Titu organized on the occasion of launching her book about experimental artists at the National Theater in [[Bucharest]], in 1997.

Another important exhibition was that Ruxandra Garofeanu, Dan Hăulică, and Paul Gherasim organized in [[Bucharest]], in 2012 –&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; The Artist and the Power”-- covering the period 1950-1990, intending to show the artists' relationship to the polilical power during communism. Olos was included both in the section of the Baia Mare painting school, and that of the experimental artists.

=== The 2001 Murska-Sobota Triannial of small sculpture show in Slovenia ===
The artists' presence at Murska-Sobota show has a special place in his career, as it included the presentation of a „Manifesto”, an artistic statement that summed up his meditations on art and his „Olospolis”. Having the dimensions of a booklet entitled in the original Romanian version as „Carta”, and was published in the literary and cultural magazine Verso. Remembering those who had influenced his artistic progress and criticizing the artists who had not succeeded to find a similarly simple principle like the one he had found in structure of the spindle-knot. The artist who in his youth was open to any new trend in art seems less open to the postmodernist trend in arts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4436">The '''Mincer earnings function''' is a single-equation [[Economic model|model]] that explains [[wage]] income as a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of schooling and experience, named after [[Jacob Mincer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mincer | first1 = Jacob | last2 = | first2 =  | year = 1958 | title = Investment in Human Capital and Personal Income Distribution | journal = [[Journal of Political Economy]] | volume = 66 | issue = 4 | pages = 281–302 | publisher =  | jstor = 1827422 | url =  | format =  | accessdate = | doi=10.1086/258055}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mincer |first=J. |year=1974 |title=Schooling, Experience and Earnings |location=New York |publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9IGqAAAAIAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The equation has been examined on many datasets and [[Thomas Lemieux]] argues it is "one of the most widely used models in empirical economics". Typically the logarithm of earnings is modelled as the sum of years of education and a [[quadratic function]] of "years of potential experience".&lt;ref name="lemieux"&gt;Lemieux, Thomas. (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=FeCS-vRhp9AC&amp;pg=PA127 "The 'Mincer equation' Thirty Years after ''Schooling, Experience, and Earnings''"] in ''Jacob Mincer: A Pioneer of Modern Labor Economics'', Shoshanna Grossbard, ed., Springer: New York. pp. 127–145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |last=Heckman |first=James J. |first2=Lance J. |last2=Lochner |first3=Petra E. |last3=Todd |year=2003 |title=Fifty Years of Mincer Earnings Regressions |work=NBER Working Paper No. 9732 |doi=10.3386/w9732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ln w = f (s, x) = \ln w_0 + \rho s + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 x^2&lt;/math&gt;

Where the variables have the following meanings; &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is earnings (the [[Regression intercept|intercept]] &lt;math&gt;w_0&lt;/math&gt; is the earnings of someone with no education and no experience); &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is years of schooling; &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is years of potential labour market experience.&lt;ref name="lemieux" /&gt; The parameters &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\beta_{1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta_{2}&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as the [[Returns (economics)|returns]] to schooling and experience, respectively.

[[Sherwin Rosen]], in his article celebrating Mincer's contribution, memorably noted that when data was interrogated using this equation one might describe them as having been ''Mincered''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rosen | first1 = Sherwin | last2 = | first2 =  | year = 1992 | title = Distinguished Fellow: Mincering Labor Economics | journal = [[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 157–170 | publisher =  | jstor = 2138414 | url =  | format =  | accessdate = | doi=10.1257/jep.6.2.157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Unlike criminal syndicates, the extensive nature of these illegal endeavors, and the claim that they are directed and sanctioned by the highest levels of government,&lt;ref name=kan /&gt;{{rp|1}} has led to the nature of the North Korean state being defined as a form of "criminal sovereignty" by foreign policy experts such as [[Paul Rexton Kan]] and [[Bruce Bechtol]].&lt;ref name=kan /&gt;{{rp|3}}

However, there are questions remaining about the level of government involvement in each of the criminal enterprises. Many commentators agree that the North Korean state has been behind counterfeiting currency, human trafficking, the arms trade, etc., but the level to which it has been involved in the drug trade after the collapse of the [[Economy of North Korea#Food distribution system|Public Distribution System]] in the 1990s is not clear as semi-private and private black markets have arisen since then and some high-ranking officials may only be engaged in illicit trade for personal benefit.&lt;ref name=gret&gt;{{cite book|author=Greitens, Sheena|year=2014|title= Illicit: North Korea's Evolving Operations to Earn Hard Currency, Committee for Human Rights in North Korea|isbn=978-0-9856480-2-2|url=http://www.hrnk.org/uploads/pdfs/SCG-FINAL-FINAL.pdf|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SLjbfuGJ|archivedate=4 Sep 2014|deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}

===Critical assessment===
The British academic, Hazel Smith, has argued that the allegations have a weak foundation, being largely based on the claims of a few US officials and North Korean defectors. She has pointed out that there have been very few criminal convictions. She has queried the assumption that all the activities are directed by North Korea's government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/27/north-korea-cliches-debunked-hazel-smith|title=Dangerous, isolated and primed for war?

According to North Korea scholar [[Andrei Lankov]], the country's illicit activities never developed into lucrative hard currency earners. Instead, these activities exposed the country to international condemnation in exchange for marginal gain. Lankov suggests that smuggling was never intended to earn currency for the regime, but was simply a means of survival for diplomats whose funding was cut.&lt;ref name="Lankov2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lankov|first=Andrei|title=The Real North Korea: Life and Politics in the Failed Stalinist Utopia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FHpYCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23|year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-939003-8|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drug trade==
 
It is alleged that North Korea's illegal drug trade dates back to the 1970s and includes the manufacturing, selling, and trafficking of illicit drugs, as well as counterfeit otherwise legal pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref name="Insider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/north-korea-meth-2014-4|title=North Korea's Huge Role In Global Meth Trade Revealed In Insane Criminal Case|author=Keegan Hamilton|publisher=Business Insider|date=April 4, 2014|accessdate=April 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production began in the mountainous Hamkyung and Yangkang Provinces, particularly in the village of Yonsah, where [[Kim Il-sung]] sanctioned the creation of an [[opium]] farm.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|20}}

To provide a cover of legitimacy, the North Korean government uses [[front organization|front companies]], like the Ryugyong Corporation under the control of the [[Workers' Party of Korea|Korean Workers Party]]'s Foreign Relations Department, to conduct clandestine activities.&lt;ref name="NewFocus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newfocusintl.com/the-dprk-is-capitalist-when-it-wants-to-be-the-story-of-drugs-incorporated-parts-12/|title=The DPRK is capitalist when it wants to be: the story of Drugs Incorporated|author=Staff|publisher=New Focus International|date=August 18, 2012|accessdate=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also holds large tracts of land within the country for the sole purpose of growing opium&lt;ref name="Nautilus"/&gt; and each year the company sent tens of thousands of dollars in hard currency to [[Kim Jong-il]] for his use. Unlike most companies, Ryugyong Corporation has no import or export quota restrictions.&lt;ref name="NewFocus"/&gt;

According to defector Yoon Yong Sol, during the [[North Korean famine|famine]] "[t]here were some complaints that during the famine we should be growing grain, not poppies, but the instruction from the central government was that if we grow poppies we can sell the product for 10 times as much to buy grain. ... The only way to earn hard currency is by drugs."&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|22}}

Reports of [[methamphetamine]] (known as "ice drug" in North Korea) use in the country surfaced in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="ForeignPolicy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/11/21/inside_north_koreas_crystal_meth_trade|title=Inside North Korea's Crystal Meth Trade|author=Issac Stone Fish|work=Foreign Policy|date=November 21, 2013|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Isaac Stone Fish writing in ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', the production of methamphetamine in North Korea is done by chemists and other underemployed scientists.&lt;ref name="ForeignPolicy"/&gt; Methamphetamine is given as a medication within North Korea, which has helped to fuel its spread. As the production and sale of opium declined in the mid-2000s, methamphetamine became more pervasive.&lt;ref name="ForeignPolicy"/&gt; To bring in much-needed cash, the international methamphetamine trade began, spreading first to China, and with the drug being made in state-run laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/08/21/how-north-korea-got-itself-hooked-on-meth/|title=How North Korea got itself hooked on meth|author=Max Fisher|work=Washington Post|date=August 21, 2013|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Isaac Stone Fish admitted with regard to his report: "I have no idea what is actually happening inside North Korea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Black Hole of North Korea|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/09/opinion/09iht-edfish09.html?_r=0|first=Isaac|last=Stone Fish|publisher=''New York Times''|date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China officially admitted to the drug problem stemming from North Korea in 2004, with [[Jilin Province]] being the most important transhipment point from North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2010/12/03-china-drug-trafficking-zhang|title=Drug Trafficking from North Korea: Implications for Chinese Policy|author=Yong-an Zhang|publisher=Brookings Institution|date=December 3, 2010|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production, storage, financing, and sale of the North Korea's methamphetamine trade reaches multiple countries from the Philippines, the United States, Hong Kong, Thailand, western Africa and others.&lt;ref name="Insider"/&gt; In 2010, five foreign nationals were prosecuted as part of a conspiracy involving North Korea to smuggle 40 pounds of methamphetamine into the United States and to sell it for $30,000 a pound.&lt;ref name="ForeignPolicy"/&gt;

In 2001, income from illegal drugs amounted to between $500 million and $1 billion.&lt;ref name="Nautilus"/&gt; In a 2013 ''[[Washington Post]]'' article, annual revenues from methamphetamine sales are estimated at $100 million to $200 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/03/22/report-north-korea-ordered-its-foreign-diplomats-to-become-drug-dealers/|title=Report: North Korea ordered its foreign diplomats to become drug dealers|author=Max Fisher|work=Washington Post|date=March 22, 2013|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1977 and 2003, more than twenty North Korean diplomats, agents, and trade officials have been implicated, detained, or arrested in drug-smuggling operations in more than a dozen countries.&lt;ref name="Nautilus"/&gt; In 2004, two North Korean embassy employees were caught smuggling 150,000 tablets of [[clonazepam]] in Egypt, and in that same year, embassy employees from Bulgaria were arrested in Turkey in possession of over 500,000 tablets of [[Captagon]] (the brand name for the synthetic stimulant fenethylline, or phenethylline), with an estimated street value of $7 million.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|37}} The government of North Korea has only admitted that individuals undertook such acts, and not at the direction of the state.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|17}}

According to the [[Committee for Human Rights in North Korea]], since 2001 drug trafficking operations by diplomats had ceased, with the focus then becoming the production of drugs to be smuggled by other criminal organizations.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|18}}

In 2003, the North Korean owned [[Pong Su]] was intercepted importing heroin into Australia. While four men who had landed pleaded guilty, the ship's four officers were acquitted on all charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Drug ship officers set free |date=6 March 2006 |publisher=News.com.au |url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,18360926-421,00.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215105940/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,18360926-421,00.html |archivedate=15 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counterfeiting==

===Currency===
{{See also|Superdollar}}
Counterfeiting currency is alleged to have begun in the 1970s under [[Kim Jong-il]]'s direction; however, the notes produced at the time were not of high quality.&lt;ref name="NYTpg4"/&gt; Since then, and within the jurisdiction of [[Room 39]], the North Korean government has counterfeited $50 and $100 United States banknotes using increasingly sophisticated techniques. In 1994, authorities in Hong Kong and Macao apprehended five North Korean diplomats and trade-mission members carrying around $430,000 in bills that turned out to be "[[superdollar]]" (also called "supernote") counterfeits.&lt;ref name="NYTpg5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/23/magazine/23counterfeit.html?pagewanted=5&amp;_r=0|title=No Ordinary Counterfeit|author=Stephen Mihm |publisher=New York Times|date=July 23, 2006|accessdate=April 9, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been two primary reasons for counterfeiting: the first is to wage economic warfare against the United States,&lt;ref name="NYTpg4"/&gt; and secondly, to help ease North Korea's domestic economic problems.&lt;ref name="NYTpg5"/&gt; According to a report by Dr. Balbina Hwang of [[American University]], North Korea circulated $100 million in counterfeit currency in 2001.&lt;ref name="Nautilus"/&gt; The revenues from this are estimated at between $15 million and $25 million annually.&lt;ref name="CSM"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/2013/1008/New-100-bill-why-North-Korea-won-t-be-very-happy-video|title=New $100 bill: why North Korea won't be very happy|journal=Christian Science Monitor|author=Mike Eckel|date=October 8, 2013|accessdate=April 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the United States released its newly redesigned [[United States one hundred-dollar bill|100 dollar bill]]. The primary purpose of the redesign was to fight against counterfeiting and prevent the recurrence of the "supernotes" which were produced by North Korea.&lt;ref name="CSM"/&gt;

The [[International Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency]] is the primary treaty whereby states agree to criminalize acts of currency counterfeiting. North Korea is not a party to the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/pages/LONViewDetails.aspx?src=LON&amp;id=551&amp;chapter=30&amp;lang=en|title=International Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analyst [[Andrei Lankov]] has described the evidence for the counterfeiting of superdollars as merely circumstantial.&lt;ref name="Lankov2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lankov|first=Andrei|title=The Real North Korea: Life and Politics in the Failed Stalinist Utopia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FHpYCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23|year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-939003-8|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory Elich of the Korea Policy Institute has argued that these allegations are unfounded. According to Elich, North Korea's [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] press from the 1970s would be incapable of printing the supernotes, and the paper and ink would be extremely difficult for North Korea to produce. Furthermore, he says that the amounts of supernotes produced are too small to be economical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=North Korea and the Supernote Enigma|url=http://www.globalresearch.ca/north-korea-and-the-supernote-enigma/8919|first=Gregory|last=Elich|publisher=Global Research|date=7 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counterfeit legal pharmaceuticals===
There have been a few cases of North Korea being implicated in the production of counterfeit [[Viagra]]. These include: a 2004 arrest in [[Seoul, South Korea]] of a man with 4,000 counterfeit Viagra pills; and a 2005 report from Japan that North Korea was producing fake Viagra pills in factories in [[Chongjin]], which were then sold in Hong Kong to customers of other Southeast-Asian countries (including China), and the Middle East.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|38}} 

===Counterfeit cigarettes===
Counterfeit cigarettes have been a lucrative item for the country. The trade is believed to have begun in the 1990s and greatly increased in 2002 after Chinese authorities shut down many counterfeit operations in China, which then provided added incentive, knowledge, and capacity which could be relocated to North Korea.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|32}} During a 2006 Congressional hearing, Peter A. Prahar of the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], quoted reports that mentioned the existence of "as many as 12" factories in the DPRK capable of producing "billions of packs of counterfeit cigarettes annually."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-109shrg28241/html/CHRG-109shrg28241.htm|title=- NORTH KOREA: ILLICIT ACTIVITY FUNDING THE REGIME|website=www.gpo.gov|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The factories appear to be owned and operated by the North Korean military.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The major factories for cigarette production were reportedly based in [[Rajin]], though defectors also mentioned a factory in [[Pyongyang]].&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|33}}

In 1995, Taiwan stopped a ship and confiscated 20 containers of counterfeit cigarette packaging, which is enough to make 2 million cartons of popular Japanese and British brands.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|32}} In 2004, authorities in Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Singapore also impounded containers filled with counterfeit cigarettes.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|33}} Official congressional testimony in 2006 revealed that North Korea-sourced [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro brand]] cigarettes had been identified in 1,300 incidents across the United States.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|35}} Revenues from counterfeit cigarettes are estimated at between $80 million and $160 million a year.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|36}}

==Human trafficking==
{{main|Human trafficking in North Korea}}

North Korea is a "Tier 3" country (those who do not comply with human trafficking laws) as listed by the U.S. Department of State and has retained this ranking since 2007.&lt;ref name="TraffickingReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/226847.pdf|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2014: KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF|publisher=U.S. Department of State|year=2014|pages=231–232|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The country is a source country of men, women, and children for sex trafficking and forced labor. Forced labor is used both [[Human rights in North Korea#Internment camps for political prisoners|internally]] and externally. Countries which have North Korean forced laborers include Russia, China, Mongolia, and other places in Central Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.&lt;ref name="TraffickingReport"/&gt;

While the North Korean government claims these are "contract workers", reports claim that they are actually subjected to forced labor, that their movements and communications are subjected to strict surveillance, and that workers sent overseas do not have a choice in the type of work they will be doing nor do they receive pay for their work.&lt;ref name="TraffickingReport"/&gt;

It is estimated that there are thousands of North Koreans working in logging, construction, and agriculture industries in Russia. These workers reportedly only receive two days of rest each year and face punishment if they fail to meet quotas.&lt;ref name="TraffickingReport"/&gt;

North Korea is not a party to the 2000 UN [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children|TIP Protocol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/pages/viewdetails.aspx?src=ind&amp;mtdsg_no=xviii-12-a&amp;chapter=18&amp;lang=en|title=Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children|publisher=United Nations|date=April 9, 2014|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arms trade==
During the 1980s, North Korea emerged as a ''legal'' arms trader to primarily [[Third World]] countries, exporting relatively inexpensive, technically unsophisticated, but reliable weapons.&lt;ref name="DIAC3"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://fas.org/irp/dia/product/knfms/knfms_chp3a.html|title=North Korea: The Foundations for Military Strength |chapter= 3A|publisher=Defense Intelligence Agency|date= 1991|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Iran–Iraq War]], some 90% of arms exports from North Korea went to Iran, and between 1981 and 1989, North Korea earned an estimated $4 billion from arms sales.&lt;ref name="DIAC3"/&gt;

North Korea has a known track record in proliferating nuclear and missile technology and in 2001, missile sales came to $560 million.&lt;ref name="Nautilus"/&gt; Following its [[2006 North Korean nuclear test|2006 nuclear test]], international sanctions have sought to limit or prevent North Korea from exporting various types of arms, materials, and technology.&lt;ref name="HuffPost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/17/north-korea-weapons-trade_n_3610668.html|title=North Korea's Weapons Trade: A Look At A Global Business|author=Foster Klug|work=Huffington Post|date=July 17, 2013|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to UN sanctions however, countries such as Japan and the United States took unilateral steps to curb such activities.&lt;ref name="Nautilus"/&gt;

UN sanctions now ban all arms, including small arms and light weapons.&lt;ref name="CRS1874"/&gt;{{rp|14}}
North Korea has developed an extensive and complicated arms trade network in an attempt to circumvent sanctions and uses front companies and embassies to traffic weapons.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/11/us-korea-korea-un-idUSBREA2A08020140311|title=Front companies, embassies mask North Korean weapons trade |author=James Pearson|newspaper=Reuters|date=March 11, 2014|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 UN report, [[Syria]], [[Myanmar]], [[Eritrea]], [[Tanzania]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Somalia]] and [[Iran]] were all suspected to have bought weapons from North Korea.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;

===Incidents===
{{As of|2010}}, trade in banned small arms and ammunition was relatively insignificant, with reports include: imports totaling $45,500 by [[Brazil]] in 2007, of $3.1 million by the [[United Arab Emirates]] in 2006, and $364,400 by Ethiopia in 2005, and $121,400 by [[Mexico]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="CRS1874"/&gt;{{rp|14}}

In 2009, three vessels were intercepted which were carrying North Korean weapons. Western and Israeli intelligence officials believed the weapons were destined for [[Hezbollah]] and [[Hamas]].&lt;ref name="CRS1874"/&gt;{{rp|7}}

In December 2009, Thailand intercepted a charter jet from Pyongyang carrying 35 tons of conventional weapons, including [[surface-to-air missiles]].&lt;ref name="HuffPost"/&gt;

In 2012, the United Nations reported that 445 North Korean-made graphite cylinders (which can be used to produce ballistic missiles) were seized from a Chinese freighter at the South Korean port of [[Busan]] on their way to Syria.&lt;ref name="HuffPost"/&gt;

In 2013, a [[North Korean cargo ship seizure in Panama]] (carrying [[Cuba]]n weapons) took place.

In August 2016, US intelligence tracked a ship sailing under a [[Flag of convenience|convenience flag]] of [[Cambodia]], with a North Korean crew sailing from North Korea to [[Egypt]] was found with carrying 24,000 [[rocket-propelled grenades]] and components for another 6,000. It was ordered and paid by a private Egyptian business, but it is believed that it was for the [[Egyptian Army]]. The value of this order and others is estimated at $23 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Warrick|first1=Joby|title=A North Korean ship was seized off Egypt with a huge cache of weapons destined for a surprising buyer|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/a-north-korean-ship-was-seized-off-egypt-with-a-huge-cache-of-weapons-destined-for-a-surprising-buyer/2017/10/01/d9a4e06e-a46d-11e7-b14f-f41773cd5a14_story.html|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|accessdate=25 November 2017|date=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/03/04/un-report-new-light-egypts-role-north-korean-weapons-sales/ | title=UN report to shed new light on Egypt's role in North Korean weapons sales| newspaper=The Telegraph| date=2018-03-04| last1=Ryall| first1=Julian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wildlife trade ==
Over the past three decades, at least 18 North Korean diplomats have been caught smuggling [[rhino horn]] and [[ivory]], though the real number is considered to be much higher.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalinitiative.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/TGIATOC-Diplomats-and-Deceipt-DPRK-Report-1868-web.pdf|title=Diplomats and Deceit: North Korea's Criminal Activities in Africa|last=Rademeyer|first=Julian|date=September 2017|website=Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korean defectors have also reported smuggling of rhino horn and ivory from countries like [[Angola]], [[Ethiopia]], and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[South Africa]] and [[Mozambique]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Such illegal activity is considered low-risk but highly rewarding for the regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/5b1ec8a4-9ee1-11e7-9a86-4d5a475ba4c5|title=North Korea said to be revitalising African wildlife trafficking|last=|first=|date=|website=Financial Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Room 39==
{{main|Room 39}}
Room 39 (or Office 39) is the primary government organization that seeks ways to maintain the foreign currency slush fund of North Korea's leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=North Korea's Dollar Store|date=August 5, 2009 |author=David Rose|work=Vanity Fair|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2009/09/office-39-200909|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Room 39 oversees many of the government's illegal activities (although the military also has its own illegal activity division) such as counterfeiting and drug production. In 2010, the department was reported to have had 17 overseas branches, 100 trading companies and banks under its control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk00400&amp;num=6750|title=What Is the No.39 Department?|author=Kim Yong Hun |publisher=DailyNK|date=August 30, 2010|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009, the office allegedly had upwards of $5 billion in assets, much of which was spread in banks throughout [[Macau]], [[Hong Kong]], and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kim-jong-un-estimated-5-141825342.html|title=Kim Jong-un Estimated To Have Up To $5 Billion In Secret Overseas Accounts|author=Adam Taylor|publisher=Business Insider|date=March 13, 2013|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as illegal money-making ventures, North Korea has been condemned for politically motivated criminal acts related to the long-running [[Korean conflict]].

In 1988, North Korea was added to the [[State Sponsors of Terrorism]] list for supplying groups with weapons and for their role in the [[Rangoon bombing]] and the bombing of [[Korean Air Flight 858]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/state-sponsors-of-terrorism/state-sponsors-north-korea/p9364|title=State Sponsors: North Korea|author=Vikaas Sharma|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|date=June 28, 2008|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 President [[George W. Bush]] agreed to remove North Korea from the list after North Korea met their obligations to provide access to their nuclear program and the resumption of disabling of their nuclear facilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7665206.stm | work=BBC News | title=N Korea taken off US terror list | date=October 11, 2008 | accessdate=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but continued hostilities and the fear that North Korea could sell nuclear weapons to terrorist organizations have called for the nation to be relisted.

In 2017, North Korea was relisted as a terrorist state in response to the murder of [[Kim Jong-nam]], its role in the [[Syrian Civil War]], close relationships with [[Iran]], and it backing Islamic terrorist organizations, especially [[Hamas]].&lt;ref name=NKIL&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-thanks-n-korea-for-its-support-against-israeli-occupation/ | title=Hamas thanks N.

===International abductions===
Between 1977 and 1983, [[North Korean abductions of Japanese citizens|North Korea abducted several Japanese citizens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nettv.gov-online.go.jp/eng/prg/prg1786.html|title=Abduction – An Unforgivable Crime|publisher=Japanese Government Internet TV|date=January 23, 2009|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korea has admitted to abducting 13 Japanese citizens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/international/asia/news/20060413p2g00m0in046000c.html|accessdate=2006-05-01|title=North Korea rejects DNA link to Megumi Yokota abduction case|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Japan lists 17 as having been abducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rachi.go.jp/en/ratimondai/jian.html|title=Individual Cases – 17 Abductees Identified by the Government of Japan|publisher=Japanese Government Headquarters for the Abduction Issue|date=May 2011|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also testimonies which list nine Europeans as being abducted by North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2008/04/21/01003-20080421ARTFIG00614-les-captives-etrangeresde-la-coree-du-nord.php|title=Les captives étrangèresde la Corée du Nord|date=21 April 2008|publisher=|via=Le Figaro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purposes of abduction ranges from using the abductees as translators/teachers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/korea/article/0,2763,812524,00.html|title=

During the [[Korean War]] North Korea abducted an estimated 82,959 South Koreans, and in the post-war period South Korea claims that a further 489 [[North Korean abductions of South Koreans|South Koreans have been abducted by North Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sukuukai.jp/narkn/|title=North Korean Abduction Victims Worldwide|publisher=National Association for the Rescue of Japanese Kidnapped by North Korea|date=December 2006|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hacking===
According to cybersecurity experts, North Korea maintains an army of hackers trained to disrupt enemy computer networks and steal both money and sensitive data. In the previous decade, it was blamed for numerous [[cyber-attack]]s and other hacking attacks in South Korea and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/world/asia/north-korea-hack-war-plans.html|title=North Korean Hackers Stole U.S.-South Korean Military Plans, Lawmaker Says|first=Choe|last=Sang-hun|publisher=New York Times|date=10 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012061027/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/world/asia/north-korea-hack-war-plans.html|archivedate=12 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Sony Pictures hack]] in 2014, U.S. government officials stated that the North Korean government was "centrally involved" in the hacking.&lt;ref name=nyt-linkedtokorea&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Links North Korea to Sony Hacking|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/world/asia/us-links-north-korea-to-sony-hacking.html?_r=0|accessdate=December 17, 2014|date=December 17, 2014| work = The New York Times | first1 = David E. | last1 = Sanger | first2 = Nicole | last2= Perlroth }}&lt;/ref&gt; White House officials treated the situation as a "serious national security matter",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url =http://news-briefs.ew.com/2014/12/18/white-house-sony-interview-north-korea/ | title =  White House is treating Sony hack as 'serious national security matter' | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = December 18, 2014 | accessdate = December 18, 2014 | first = Ariana | last = Bacle }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) formally stated that they had connected the North Korean government to the cyber-attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/update-on-sony-investigation | title =

On 8 October 2018, [[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]] reported a North Korean hacking group had tried to steal at least $1.1 billion in a series of attacks on global banks from 2014-2018, as uncovered by cybersecurity company [[FireEye]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Onaran|first=Yalman|date=8 October 2018|title=North Korea Hackers Tried to Take $1.1 Billion in Bank Attacks|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-08/north-korea-hackers-broke-into-banks-tried-to-take-1-1-billion |publisher=Bloomberg|access-date=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International responses==
The [[United Nations Security Council]] has passed multiple [[List of United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning North Korea|resolutions against North Korea]] and its weapons program including, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 825|UNSC Resolution 825]] (May 1993), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1695|UNSC Resolution 1695]] (July 2006), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874|UNSC 1874]] (June 2009), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2094|UNSC Resolution 2094]] (March 2013) and most recently,  [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2371|UNSC Resolution 2371]] (August 2017). Were the international community to fully enforce UNSC 1874, it is estimated that North Korea would lose between $1.5 and $3.7 billion.&lt;ref name="CRS1874"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

Since 1950, the United States has maintained an [[North Korea–United States relations|embargo against North Korea]] for their role in starting the [[Korean War]]. The embargo and related sanctions have been extended to combat North Korea's various illicit activities and continued aggression.

In 2005, under the [[US Patriot Act]] section 311, $25 million of North Korea's cash was frozen at Macau-based [[Banco Delta Asia]], which the US Treasury said North Korea used for illicit activities.&lt;ref name="CRS1874"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R40684.pdf|title=North Korea's Second Nuclear Test: Implications of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1874|author=Mary Beth Nitkin|publisher=Congressional Research Service|date=April 15, 2010|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}}

In 2010, US President [[Barack Obama]] signed [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 13551, which "targets North Korea’s importation and exportation of arms, importation of luxury goods, and other illicit activities, including money laundering, the counterfeiting of goods and currency, bulk cash smuggling, and narcotics trafficking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/tg1146.aspx|title=Treasury Designates Financial Institution Involved in Facilitating North Korea's Illicit Activities|publisher=U.S. Department of the Treasury|date=April 19, 2011|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''nursing process''' is a modified [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;Funnell, R., Koutoukidis, G.&amp; Lawrence, K. (2009)Tabbner's Nursing Care (5th Edition), p. 72, Elsevier Pub, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ackley, B. J., &amp; Ladwig, G. B. (2017). Nursing diagnosis handbook: An evidence-based guide to planning care (10 ed.). St. Louis: Mosby/Elsevier&lt;/ref&gt; Nursing practise was first described as a four-stage nursing process by Ida Jean Orlando in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Marriner-Tomey &amp; Allgood (2006) Nursing Theorists and their work. p. 432&lt;/ref&gt; It should not be confused with [[nursing theory|nursing theories]] or [[health informatics]]. The diagnosis phase was added later.

The nursing process uses clinical judgement to strike a balance of [[epistemology]] between personal interpretation and research evidence in which  [[critical thinking]] may play a part to categorize the clients issue and course of action. Nursing offers diverse patterns of knowing.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, P. (2009) Inspired knowing in nursing. p. 63 in Loscin &amp; Purnell (Eds) (2009) Contemporary Nursing Process.Springer Pub&lt;/ref&gt; Nursing knowledge has embraced pluralism since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, H (2010) The Nature of Theoretical Thinking in Nursing. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors refer to a [[mind map]] or [[Abductive|abductive reasoning]] as a potential alternative strategy for organizing care.&lt;ref&gt;Bradshaw, J &amp; Lowenstein (2010) Innovative Teaching Strategies in Nursing and Related Health Professions.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]] plays a part for experienced nurses.&lt;ref&gt;Funnell, R., Koutoukidis, G.&amp; Lawrence, K. (2009) Tabbner's Nursing Care (5th Edition), p. 222, Elsevier Pub, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phases==
[[File:Nursing process (NANDA).svg|thumb|400px|Diagram of the five-phase nursing process]]
The nursing process is goal-oriented method of caring that provides a framework to [[nursing care]]. It involves seven major steps:

*A
: [[Nursing assessment|Assess]] (what data is collected?)
*D
: [[Nursing diagnosis|Diagnose]] (what is the problem?)
*O
:  Outcome Identification - (Was originally a part of the Planning phase, but has recently been added as a new step in the complete process).
*P
: [[Nursing care plan|Plan]] (how to manage the problem)
*I
: Implement (putting plan into action)
*R
:Rationale (Scientific reason of the implementations)
*E
: Evaluate (did the plan work?)

According to some theorists, this seven-steps description of the nursing process is outdated and misrepresents nursing as linear and atomic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogeriannursingscience.wikispaces.com/Chapter+7+Practice+Methods|title=RogerianNursingScience - Chapter 7 Practice Methods|author=|date=|website=rogeriannursingscience.wikispaces.com|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessing phase===
{{Main article|Nursing assessment}}
The nurse completes an [[holistic]] [[nursing assessment]] of the needs of the individual/family/community, regardless of the reason for the encounter. The nurse collects [[subjectivity|subjective]] [[data]] and [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] [[data]] using a nursing framework, such as Marjory  [[Gordon's functional health patterns]].

====Models for data collection====
Nursing assessments provide the starting point for determining nursing diagnoses. It is vital that a recognized nursing assessment framework is used in practice to identify the patient's* problems, risks and outcomes for enhancing health. The use of an evidence-based nursing framework such as Gordon's Functional Health Pattern Assessment should guide assessments that support nurses in determination of NANDA-I nursing diagnoses. For accurate determination of nursing diagnoses, a useful, evidence-based assessment framework is best practice.

=====Methods=====
*Client Interview
*Physical Examination
*Obtaining a health history (including dietary data)
*Family history/report
*

===Diagnosing phase===
{{Main article|Nursing diagnosis}}
[[Nursing diagnosis|Nursing diagnoses]] represent the nurse's clinical judgment about actual or potential health problems/life process occurring with the individual, family, group or community. The accuracy of the nursing diagnosis is validated when a nurse is able to clearly identify and link to the defining characteristics, related factors and/or risk factors found within the patients assessment. Multiple nursing diagnoses may be made for one client.

===Planning phase===
{{Main article|Nursing care plan}}
In agreement with the client, the nurse addresses each of the problems identified in the diagnosing phase. When there are multiple nursing diagnoses to be addressed, the nurse prioritizes which diagnoses will receive the most attention first according to their severity and potential for causing more serious harm. For each problem a measurable goal/outcome is set. For each goal/outcome, the nurse selects nursing interventions that will help achieve the goal/outcome. A common method of formulating the expected outcomes is to use the [[evidence-based]] [[Nursing Outcomes Classification]] to allow for the use of standardized language which improves consistency of terminology, definition and outcome measures.  The interventions used in the [[Nursing Interventions Classification]] again allow for the use of standardized language which improves consistency of terminology, definition and ability to identify nursing activities, which can also be linked to nursing workload and staffing indices. The result of this phase is a [[nursing care plan]].

===Implementing phase===
The nurse implements the [[nursing care plan]], performing the determined interventions that were selected to help meet the goals/outcomes that were established. Delegated tasks and the monitoring of them is included here as well.

'''Activities'''
* pre-assessment of the client-done before just carrying out implementation to determine if it is relevant
* determine need for assistance
* implementation of nursing orders
* delegating and supervising-determines who to carry out what action

===Evaluating phase===
The nurse evaluates the progress toward the goals/outcomes identified in the previous phases. If progress towards the goal is slow, or if regression has occurred, the nurse must change the plan of care accordingly. Conversely, if the goal has been achieved then the care can cease. New problems may be identified at this stage, and thus the process will start all over again.

==Characteristics==
The nursing process is a '''cyclical''' and '''ongoing''' process that can end at any stage if the problem is solved. The nursing process exists for every problem that the individual/family/community has. The nursing process not only focuses on ways to improve physical needs, but also on social and emotional needs as well.

The entire process is recorded or documented in order to inform all members of the health care team.

==Variations and documentation==
{{see also|Nursing documentation}}
The '''PIE method''' is a system for documenting actions, especially in the field of [[nursing]].  The name comes from the acronym ''PIE'', meaning Problem, Intervention, Evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sqnp00YgyMQC&amp;pg=PA114 |page=114 |date=2008-01-01 |title=Fundamental Nursing Skills and Concepts |isbn=978-0-7817-7909-8 |author=Barbara Kuhn Timby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Orenthal James Simpson''' (born July 9, 1947), nicknamed '''The Juice''', is an American former [[running back]], broadcaster, actor, advertising spokesman, and convicted robber.

Simpson attended the [[University of Southern California]] (USC), where he played football for the [[USC Trojans football|USC Trojans]] and won the [[Heisman Trophy]] in 1968. He played professionally as a [[running back]] in the NFL for 11 seasons, primarily with the [[Buffalo Bills]] from 1969 to 1977. He also played for the [[San Francisco 49ers]] from 1978 to 1979. In 1973, he became the first NFL player to [[Rush (gridiron football)|rush]] for more than [[2,000-yard club|2,000 yards]] in a season. He holds the record for the single season yards-per-game average, which stands at 143.1. He is the only player to ever rush for over 2,000 yards in the 14-game regular season NFL format.

Simpson was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 1983 and the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1985. After retiring from football, he began new careers in acting and football broadcasting.

In 1994, Simpson was arrested and charged with the murders of his ex-wife, [[Nicole Brown Simpson]], and her friend, [[Ron Goldman]]. He was acquitted by a jury after a [[O. J. Simpson murder case|lengthy and internationally publicized trial]]. The families of the victims subsequently filed a civil suit against him, and in 1997 a [[Civil law (common law)|civil court]] awarded a $33.5&amp;nbsp;million judgment against him for the victims' [[Wrongful death claim|wrongful death]]s.

In 2007, Simpson was arrested in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], and charged with the [[felonies]] of armed robbery and kidnapping.&lt;ref name="arrest"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/oj/nvoj91607arrstrpt.html |title=O.J.

==College football and athletics career==
Although Simpson was an All-City football player at Galileo, his mediocre high-school grades prevented him from attracting the interest of many college recruiters. After a childhood friend's injury in the [[Vietnam War]] influenced Simpson to stay out of the military, he enrolled at [[City College of San Francisco]] in 1965.&lt;ref name="cahill19770908"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Cahill |first=Tim |date=1977-09-08 |title=O.J.

Simpson chose to attend the [[USC Trojans football|University of Southern California]] (USC), which he had admired as a young football fan,{{r|cahill19770908}} over the [[Utah Utes football|University of Utah]] and played running back for head coach [[John McKay (American football)|John McKay]] in [[1967 USC Trojans football team|1967]] and [[1968 USC Trojans football team|1968]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.blocku.com/2012/7/8/3146029/o-j-utah-the-heisman-and-a-long-winding-what-if|title=O.J., Utah, the Heisman and a long, winding what if|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson led the nation in rushing both years under McKay: in [[1967 college football season|1967]] with 1,543 yards and 13 touchdowns, and in [[1968 college football season|1968]] with 1,880 yards on 383 carries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/oj-simpson-1.html |title=O.J.

As a junior in 1967, Simpson was a close runner-up in the Heisman Trophy [[1967 college football season#Heisman Trophy|balloting]] to quarterback [[Gary Beban]] of [[1967 UCLA Bruins football team|UCLA]]. In [[1967 USC vs. UCLA football game|that year's]] [[Victory Bell (UCLA–USC)|Victory Bell]] rivalry game between the teams, USC was down by six points in the fourth quarter with under eleven minutes remaining. On their own 36, USC backup quarterback Toby Page called an audible on third and seven. Simpson's 64-yard touchdown run tied the score, and the [[extra point]] provided a 21–20 lead, which was the final score.&lt;ref name=spbtrpbr&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jDlWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=G-kDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6952%2C1660834 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Simpson powers Trojans past Bruins into Rose Bowl |date=November 19, 1968 |page=1, sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the biggest play in what is regarded as one of the [[Game of the Century (college football)|greatest football games of the 20th century]].&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Nick.

Another dramatic touchdown in the same game is the subject of the [[Arnold Friberg]] oil painting, ''O.J. Simpson Breaks for Daylight.''

&lt;!-- While this time has not been beaten, the IAAF now refers to it as a ''world's best,'' not a world record.

As a senior in [[1968 college football season|1968]], Simpson rushed for 1,709 yards and 22 touchdowns in the regular season, earning the Heisman Trophy, the [[Maxwell Award]], and Walter Camp Award. He still holds the record for the Heisman's [[1968 college football season#Heisman Trophy|largest margin]] of victory, defeating runner-up [[Leroy Keyes]] by 1,750 points.

They took Simpson, but he  demanded what was then the largest contract in professional sports history: [[United States dollar|$]]650,000 over five years. This led to a standoff with Bills' owner [[Ralph Wilson]], as Simpson threatened to become an actor and skip professional football.

==Acting career==
[[File:O.J. Simpson 1990 · DN-ST-91-03444.JPEG|thumb|Simpson in 1990 in [[Saudi Arabia]] while visiting American troops during the lead-up to the first [[Gulf War]]]]
Even before his retirement from the NFL, Simpson embarked on a film career with parts in films such as the television mini-series ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'' (1977), and the dramatic motion pictures ''[[The Klansman]]'' (1974), ''[[The Towering Inferno]]'' (1974), ''[[The Cassandra Crossing]]'' (1976) and ''[[Capricorn One]]'' (1978). In 1979, he started his own film production company, Orenthal Productions, which dealt mostly in made-for-TV fare such as the family-oriented ''[[Goldie and the Boxer]]'' films with [[Melissa Michaelsen]] (1979 and 1981), and ''Cocaine and Blue Eyes'' (1983), the pilot for a proposed detective series on [[NBC]].{{cn|date=June 2018}} He also starred in the comedic ''[[Back to the Beach]]'' (1987) and ''[[The Naked Gun]]'' trilogy (1988, 1991, 1994). 

Besides his acting career, Simpson worked as a commentator for ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' and ''[[The NFL on NBC]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of ABC's Monday Night Football|url=http://espn.go.com/abcsports/mnf/s/2003/0115/1493105.html|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=January 15, 2003|accessdate=March 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared in the audience of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' during its second season and hosted an episode during its third season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=OJ Simpson/Ashford &amp; Simpson|url=http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/episodes/Show_84.shtml|series=[[Saturday Night Live]]|airdate=1978-02-25|network=[[NBC]]|season=3|number=12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326163850/http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/episodes/Show_84.shtml|archivedate=March 26, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Frogmen''===
Simpson starred in the un-televised two-hour-long [[film pilot]] for ''Frogmen,'' an ''[[The A-Team|A-Team]]''-like adventure series that [[Warner Bros. Television]] completed in 1994, a few months before the murders. NBC had not yet decided whether to order the series when Simpson's arrest cancelled the project. While searching his home, the police obtained a videotaped copy of the pilot as well as the script and [[dailies]]. Although the prosecution investigated reports that Simpson, who played the leader of a group of former [[United States Navy SEALs]], received "a fair amount of" military training—including use of a knife—for ''Frogmen,'' and there is a scene in which he holds a knife to the throat of a woman, this material was not introduced as evidence during the trial.&lt;ref name="lowry20000508"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/2000/may/08/entertainment/ca-27673 | title=The Saga of O.J.'s Last, Lost Pilot | accessdate=April 5, 2011 | author=Lowry, Brian | date=May 8, 2000 |work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NBC executive [[Warren Littlefield]] said in July 1994 that the network would probably never air the pilot if Simpson were convicted; if he were acquitted, however, one television journalist speculated that "''Frogmen'' would probably be on the air before the [[NBC peacock]] could unfurl its plume".&lt;ref name="jicha19940727"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-07-27/lifestyle/9407260286_1_littlefield-tv-movie-simpson-case | title=NBC May Bury Simpson TV Movie At Sea | work=Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel | date=July 27, 1994 | accessdate=April 24, 2014 | author=Jicha, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most pilots that are two hours long are aired as [[TV movie]]s whether or not they are ordered as series. Because—as the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' later reported—"the appetite for all things O.J. appeared insatiable" during the trial, Warner Bros. and NBC estimated that a gigantic, [[Super Bowl]]-like television audience would have watched the ''Frogmen'' film. Co-star [[Evan Handler]] said that the studio's decision not to air it or release it on home video, and forego an estimated $14&amp;nbsp;million in profits, was "just about the only proof you have that there is some dignity in the advertising and television business".&lt;ref name="lowry20000508"/&gt;

===''Juiced''===
In 2006, Simpson starred in his own [[Improvisational theatre|improv]], hidden-camera prank TV show, ''Juiced.'' Typical of the genre, Simpson would play a prank on everyday people while secretly filming them and at the end of each prank, he would shout, "You've been Juiced!" Less typical, each episode opened with topless strippers dancing around Simpson, who is dressed as a pimp. He sings his own rap song, which includes the lyrics "Don't you know there's no stopping the Juice / When I'm on the floor I'm like a lion on the loose / Better shoot me with a tranquilizer dart / Don't be stupid, I'm not a Simpson named Bart." In one episode, Simpson is at a used car lot in Las Vegas where he attempts to sell his white Bronco (made famous during the chase in Los Angeles prior to his arrest). A bullet hole in the front of the SUV is circled with his autograph, and he pitches it to a prospective buyer by saying that if they "ever get into some trouble and have to get away, it has escapability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vogue.com/13393604/remembering-oj-simpsons-bizarre-prank-tv-show |title=Remembering O.J. Simpson’s Bizarre Prank TV Show |last=Stampler |first=Laura |date=January 29, 2016 |work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] |accessdate=January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another sketch called "B-I-N-G-O.J.", Simpson pretends to be having an affair with another man's girlfriend. Later he transforms into an old white man whose dying wish is to call a game of bingo. ''Juiced'' aired as a one-time special on pay-per-view television and was later released on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Fallon| first=Kevin| title=Remember When O.J.

In 1975, ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine described Simpson as "the first black athlete to become a bona fide lovable media superstar."&lt;ref name="goodman19751013"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Goodman |first=Mark |date=1975-10-13 |title=Buffalo Turns on the Juice, and O.J.

He also appeared in comic book ads for Dingo [[cowboy boots]].

==Family life==
[[File:O.J. Simpson (1986)2.JPG|thumb|upright|Simpson with his daughter, Sydney Brooke in 1986]]
At age 19 on June 24, 1967, Simpson married Marguerite L. Whitley. Together, they had three children: Arnelle L. Simpson (b. 1968), Jason L. Simpson (b. 1970), and Aaren Lashone Simpson (1977–1979). In August 1979, Aaren drowned in the family's swimming pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=alYnAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bnwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6787,3455914&amp;dq=aaren+simpson&amp;hl=en |title=Simpson's youngest daughter dies after 8 days in coma |date=August 28, 1979 |work=[[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]] |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/sportscentury/features/00016477.html |title=L.A. story |last=Schwartz |first=Larry |website=[[ESPN.com]] |accessdate=January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criminal trial for murder====
[[File:Mug shot of O.J. Simpson.jpg|thumb|upright|Simpson's mugshot, 17 June 1994]]
On June 12, 1994, Nicole Brown Simpson and [[Ron Goldman]] were found stabbed to death outside Nicole's [[condominium]] in the [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]] area of Los Angeles. Simpson was a [[person of interest]] in their murders. Simpson did not turn himself in, and on June 17 he became the object of a low-speed pursuit in a white 1993 [[Ford Bronco]] [[SUV]] owned and driven by [[Al Cowlings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/18/us/the-simpson-case-the-fugitive-simpson-is-charged-chased-arrested.html|title=The Fugitive: Simpson Is Charged, Chased, Arrested|last=Mydans|first=Seth|date=18 June 1994|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;    TV stations interrupted coverage of the [[1994 NBA Finals]] to broadcast the incident live.  With an estimated audience of 95 million people, the event was described as "the most famous ride on American shores since [[Paul Revere]]'s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdbQMywnrdwC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=Simpson+Bronco+most+famous+ride+since+Paul+Revere|title=Crimes of the century: from Leopold and Loeb to O.J.

The trial, often characterized as the [[Trial of the Century]] because of its international publicity similar to that of [[Sacco and Vanzetti]] and the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]], culminated after eleven months on October 3, 1995, when the jury rendered a verdict of "not guilty" for the two murders. An estimated 100 million people nationwide tuned in to watch or listen to the verdict announcement.&lt;ref name=dershowitz2004&gt;{{cite book|title=America on trial: inside the legal battles that transformed our nation|last=Dershowitz|first=Alan M.|authorlink=Alan Dershowitz|isbn=0-446-52058-6|date=May 2004|page=514|publisher=[[Warner Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Simpson's acquittal, no additional arrests or convictions related to the murders were made.

Immediate reaction to the verdict was notable for its division along racial lines: a poll of [[Los Angeles County]] residents showed that most African Americans there felt that justice had been served by the "not guilty" verdict, while the majority of whites and Latinos expressed an opinion that it had not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Decker|first1=Cathleen|title=THE TIMES POLL : Most in County Disagree With Simpson Verdicts|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-08/news/mn-54801_1_times-poll|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; O.

According to a 2016 poll, 83% of white Americans and 57% of black Americans believe Simpson was guilty of the murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/25/black-and-white-americans-can-now-agree-o-j-was-guilty/ |title=Two decades later, black and white Americans finally agree on O.J.

====Wrongful death civil trial====
Following Simpson's acquittal of criminal charges, Ron Goldman's family filed a civil lawsuit against Simpson. [[Daniel Petrocelli]] represented plaintiff Fred Goldman (Ronald Goldman's father), while Robert Baker represented Simpson.&lt;ref name="Civil Case"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9609/16/simpson.case/|publisher=CNN|title=The O.J.

On February 5, 1997, a civil jury in [[Santa Monica, California]] unanimously found Simpson liable for the [[Wrongful death claim|wrongful death]] of and battery against Goldman, and battery against Brown. Simpson was ordered to pay $33,500,000 in damages. In February 1999, an auction of Simpson's [[Heisman Trophy]] and other belongings netted almost $500,000, which went to the Goldman family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,615340,00.html|publisher=People|title=O.J.'S Heisman Sold|date=April 22, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Goldman family also tried to collect Simpson's [[NFL]] $28,000 yearly pension&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/michael_mccann/09/18/hearings|publisher=CNN|title=No easy answers|date=September 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but failed to collect any money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge Rules Simpson's Mother Can Keep Piano|url=http://www.courttv.com/casefiles/simpson/ojsimpson.html|date=September 30, 1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213051600/http://www.courttv.com/casefiles/simpson/ojsimpson.html|archivedate=February 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Simpson was evicted from the estate in which he had lived for 20 years, at 360 North Rockingham Avenue, after defaulting on the mortgage. In July 1998, the house was demolished by its next owner, Kenneth Abdalla, an investment banker and president of the [[Jerry's Famous Deli]] chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Chicago Tribune|title=New Owner Demolishes O.J.

A 2000 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article reported that Simpson still made a significant income by signing autographs. He subsequently moved from California to [[Florida]], settling in [[Miami]]. In Florida, among a few states, a person's residence cannot be seized to collect a debt under most circumstances.

On September 5, 2006, Goldman's father took Simpson back to court to obtain control over Simpson's "right to publicity", for purposes of satisfying the judgment in the civil court case.&lt;ref name="spending"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070305235730/http://www.cnn.com/2007/LAW/02/08/simpson.lawsuit.ap/index.html "O.J. Simpson ordered to stop spending"]. CNN. May 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 4, 2007, a federal judge issued a [[restraining order]] prohibiting Simpson from spending any advance he may have received on a canceled book deal and TV interview about the 1994 murders. The matter was dismissed before trial for lack of jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="spending" /&gt; On January 19, 2007, a California state judge issued an additional restraining order, ordering Simpson to restrict his spending to "ordinary and necessary living expenses".&lt;ref name="spending" /&gt;

On March 13, 2007, a judge prevented Simpson from receiving any further compensation from the defunct book deal and TV interview, and the judge ordered the bundled book rights to be auctioned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/3/14/102934.shtml "Judge Keeps O.J.

===Other legal troubles===
The State of California claims Simpson owes $1.44&amp;nbsp;million in [[back taxes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSN1733575520071018|title=O.J.

In the late 1990s, Simpson attempted to register "O. J. Simpson", "O. J.", and "The Juice" as trademarks for "a broad range of goods, including figurines, trading cards, sportswear, medallions, coins, and prepaid telephone cards".&lt;ref&gt;''Ritchie v. Simpson'', 170 F.3D 1092 (C.A.F.C., 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; A "concerned citizen", William B. Ritchie, sued to oppose the granting of federal registration on the grounds that doing so would be immoral and scandalous. Simpson gave up the effort in 2000.

In February 2001, Simpson was arrested in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]], for simple battery and burglary of an occupied conveyance, for yanking the glasses off another motorist during a traffic dispute three months earlier. If convicted, Simpson could have faced up to 16 years in prison, but he was tried and quickly acquitted of both charges in October 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/jury-clears-oj-simpson-of-roadrage-charges-632646.html|title= Jury clears O.J.

On December 4, 2001, Simpson's Miami home was searched by the FBI on suspicion of [[MDMA|ecstasy]] possession and [[money laundering]]. The FBI had received a tip that Simpson was involved in a major drug trafficking ring after 10 other suspects were arrested in the case. Simpson's home was thoroughly searched for two hours, but no illegal drugs were discovered, and no arrest or formal charges were filed following the search. However, investigators uncovered equipment capable of stealing satellite television programming, which eventually led to Simpson's being sued in federal court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/06/06/national/main202915.shtml|title=O.J.

In March 2004, satellite television network [[DirecTV]], Inc. accused Simpson in a Miami federal court of using illegal electronic devices to [[piracy|pirate]] its broadcast signals. The company later won a $25,000 judgment, and Simpson was ordered to pay an additional $33,678 in attorney's fees and costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8719276|title=O.J.

By the end of October 2007, all three of Simpson's co-defendants had [[plea-bargain]]ed with the prosecution in the [[Clark County, Nevada]], court case. Walter Alexander and Charles H.

After the hearings, the judge ordered that Simpson be tried for the robbery.

On November 8, 2007, Simpson had a preliminary hearing to decide whether he would be tried for the charges. He was held over for trial on all 12 counts. Simpson pleaded not guilty on November 29, and the trial was reset from April to September 8, 2008.&lt;ref name="jurors"&gt;[http://www.newsmax.com/us/oj_simpson/2008/05/22/98327.html "400 jurors could be screened for OJ Simpson trial."]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}} ''Newsmax''.

A hearing took place on January 16, 2008.

===Release from prison===
On July 31, 2013, the [[Nevada]] [[Parole Board]] granted Simpson parole on some convictions, but his imprisonment continued based on the weapons and assault convictions. The board considered Simpson's prior record of criminal convictions and good behavior in prison in coming to the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=O.J.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{Liberalism sidebar |Ideas}}
The '''open society''' was conceived in 1932 by French philosopher [[Henri Bergson]].&lt;ref&gt;• Henri Bergson ([1932] 1937).  ''Les Deux Sources de la morale et de la religion'', [[wikisource:fr:Les Deux Sources de la morale et de la religion/Chapitre I|ch. I, pp. 1-103,]] &amp; [[wikisource:fr:Les Deux Sources de la morale et de la religion/Chapitre IV|ch. IV, pp.  287–343]]. Félix Alcan.&lt;br /&gt;• Translated as ([1935] 1977), ''[https://archive.org/stream/twosourcesofmora033499mbp#page/n1/mode/2up The Two Sources of Morality and Religion]''  Internet Archive (left or right arrow buttons select succeeding pages), pp. 18-27, 45-65, 229-34.&lt;!-- these excerpts distinguish between closed &amp; open societies. 6/20/2017 --&gt;, trs., R. A. Audra and C. Brereton, with assistance of W. H. Carter. Macmillan press, Notre Dame.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Leszek Kołakowski]], ''Modernity on Endless Trial'' (1997), p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was further developed during the Second World War by Austrian-born British philosopher [[Karl Popper]].&lt;ref&gt;K. R. Popper, ''[[The Open Society and its Enemies]]'', 2 vols. ([1945] 1966), 5th ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[A. N. Wilson]], ''Our Times'' (2008), pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Bergson describes a '''closed society''' as a closed system of law or religion.  It is static, like a [[closed mind]].&lt;ref name=mautner&gt;Thomas Mautner (2005), 2nd ed. ''The Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy'' ["open society" entry], p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt; Bergson suggests that if all traces of civilization were to disappear, the instincts of the closed society for including or excluding others would remain.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Bergson, '' The Two Sources of Morality and Religion'', pp. [https://archive.org/stream/twosourcesofmora033499mbp#page/n1/mode/2up 20-21.] 1935, Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;   In contrast, an open society is dynamic and inclined to [[moral universalism]].&lt;ref name=mautner/&gt;

Popper saw the open society as part of a historical continuum reaching from the organic, [[tribe|tribal]], or [[Authoritarianism|closed society]], through the open society marked by a critical attitude to tradition, to the abstract or depersonalized society lacking all [[face-to-face interaction]] transactions.&lt;ref&gt;K. R. Popper, ''[[The Open Society and its Enemies]]'' (1945), v 1:1 and 174–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In open societies, the [[government]] is expected to be responsive and tolerant, and its political mechanisms [[Transparency (humanities)|transparent]] and flexible.  It can be characterized as opposed to [[authoritarianism]].&lt;!-- This paragraph is borderline incoherent and deeply questionable. "An insider of Vienna thinkers?" What does the open society have to do with Game Theory? What does Game Theory have to do with Vienna? Why is Thorstein Veblen cited, even though he died before the concept of Open Society was developed? Finally, his name is misspelt. The whole paragraph should be deleted. --&gt;

==History==
Popper saw the classical Greeks as initiating the long slow transition from tribalism towards the open society, and as facing for the first time the strain imposed by the less personal group relations entailed thereby.&lt;ref&gt;K. R. Popper, 1945:175–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas tribalistic and [[collectivism|collectivist]] societies do not distinguish between natural laws and social customs, so that individuals are unlikely to challenge traditions they believe to have a sacred or magical basis, the beginnings of an open society are marked by a distinction between natural and man-made law, and an increase in personal responsibility and accountability for moral choices (not incompatible with religious belief).&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K., ''The Open Society and Its Enemies, Volume One'' (Routledge, 1945, reprint 2006), chapter 5, part III.&lt;/ref&gt;

Popper argued that the ideas of individuality, criticism, and [[humanitarianism]] cannot be suppressed once people have become aware of them, and therefore that it is impossible to return to the closed society,&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K., ''The Open Society and Its Enemies, Volume One'' (Routledge, 1945, reprint 2006), chapter 10, part VIII.&lt;/ref&gt; but at the same time recognized the continuing emotional pull of what he called “the lost group spirit of tribalism”, as manifested for example in the [[totalitarianism]]s of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;K. R. Popper, 1945:199–200&lt;/ref&gt;

While the period since Popper's study has undoubtedly been marked by the spread of the open society, this may be attributed less to Popper's advocacy and more to the role of the economic advances of [[late modernity]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 403&lt;/ref&gt; Growth-based industrial societies require literacy, anonymity and social mobility from their members&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Gellner]], ''Nationalism'' (1997), pp. 25–9&lt;/ref&gt; — elements incompatible with much traditional-based behavior but demanding the ever-wider spread of the abstract social relations [[Georg Simmel]] saw as characterizing the metropolitan mental stance.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks, ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000), pp. 260–6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Popper defined the open society as one "in which individuals are confronted with personal decisions" as opposed to a "magical or tribal or collectivist society."&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K., ''The Open Society and Its Enemies, Volume One'' (Routledge, 1945, reprint 2006), chapter 10, part I.&lt;/ref&gt;

He considered that only democracy provides an institutional mechanism for reform and leadership change without the need for bloodshed, [[revolution]] or [[coup d'état]].&lt;ref&gt;K. R. Popper, 1945:4&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern advocates of the open society suggest that [[society]] would keep no secrets from itself in the public sense, as all are trusted with the knowledge of all. [[Freedom (political)|Political freedoms]] and [[human rights]] are claimed to be the foundation of an open society.{{by whom|date=December 2011}}

==Critical knowledge==
Popper's concept of the open society is [[epistemological]] rather than political.&lt;ref name="Soros-2006"&gt;Soros, George, "The Age of Fallibility," ''Public Affairs'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; When Popper wrote ''[[The Open Society and its Enemies]]'', he believed that the social sciences had failed to grasp the significance and the nature of [[fascism]] and [[communism]] because these sciences were based on what he saw to be faulty epistemology.&lt;ref name="Popper-vol2-23-24"&gt;Popper, K., ''The Open Society and Its Enemies, Volume Two'' (Routledge, 1945, reprint 2006), chapters 23 and 24.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Totalitarianism]] forced knowledge to become political which made critical thinking impossible and led to the destruction of knowledge in totalitarian countries.&lt;ref name="Popper-vol2-23-24"/&gt;

Popper's theory that knowledge is provisional and fallible implies that society must be open to alternative points of view. An open society is associated with [[cultural pluralism|cultural]] and [[religious pluralism]]; it is always open to improvement because knowledge is never completed but always ongoing: “if we wish to remain human, then there is only one way, the way into the open society... into the unknown, the uncertain and insecure”.&lt;ref&gt;K. R. Popper, 1945:201&lt;/ref&gt;

In the '''closed society''', claims to certain knowledge and ultimate truth lead to the attempted imposition of one version of reality.  Such a society is closed to freedom of thought.  In contrast, in an open society each citizen needs to engage in critical thinking, which requires freedom of thought and expression and the cultural and legal institutions that can  facilitate this.&lt;ref name="Soros-2006"/&gt;

==Further characteristics==
[[Humanitarianism]], [[egalitarianism|equality]] and [[Freedom (political)|political freedom]] are ideally fundamental characteristics of an open society. This was recognized by [[Pericles]], a statesman of the [[Athenian democracy]], in his laudatory funeral oration: "advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life."&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, ''The History of the Peloponnesian War'', [http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pericles.htm Book II: Pericles' Funeral Oration].&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably however it was the tension between a traditional society and the new, more open space of the emerging ''polis'' which most fully marked classical Athens,&lt;ref&gt;J. Boardman ''et al.'', ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' (1991), p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; and Popper was very aware of the continuing emotional appeal of what he called "holism...longing for the lost unity of tribal life"&lt;ref&gt;K. R. Popper, 1945:80&lt;/ref&gt; into the modern world.

== Caveats ==
Investor and philanthropist [[George Soros]], a self-described follower of Karl Popper,&lt;ref&gt;Soros, George, ''Soros on Soros'' (John Wiley and Sons, 1995), page 33.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that sophisticated use of powerful techniques of subtle deception borrowed from modern advertising and cognitive science by conservative political operatives such as [[Frank Luntz]] and [[Karl Rove]] casts doubt on Popper's view of open society.&lt;ref name="Soros-nov-8-2007"&gt;Soros, George, [http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/soros36 "From Karl Popper to Karl Rove - and Back"], ''Project Syndicate'' (November 8, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Because the electorate's perception of reality can easily be manipulated, democratic political discourse does not necessarily lead to a better understanding of reality.&lt;ref name="Soros-nov-8-2007"/&gt;  Soros argues that in addition to the need for separation of powers, free speech, and free elections, an explicit commitment to the pursuit of truth is imperative.&lt;ref name="Soros-nov-8-2007"/&gt; "Politicians will respect, rather than manipulate, reality only if the public cares about the truth and punishes politicians when it catches them in deliberate deception."&lt;ref name="Soros-nov-8-2007"/&gt;

Popper however, did not identify the open society either with democracy or with capitalism or a ''laissez-faire'' economy, but rather with a critical frame of mind on the part of the individual, in the face of communal [[group think]] of whatever kind.&lt;ref&gt;I. C. Jarvie ''et al.'' eds., ''Popper's Open Society after fifty years'' (1999), pp. 43–6&lt;/ref&gt; An important aspect in Popper's thinking is the notion that the truth can be lost. Critical attitude does not mean that the truth is found.

[[Image:Pert chart colored.svg|thumb|309px|PERT network chart for a seven-month project with five [[Milestone (project management)|milestones]] (10 through 50) and six activities (A through F).]]

The '''program '''(or '''project''') '''evaluation and review technique''' ('''PERT''') is a statistical tool used in [[project management]], which was designed to analyze and represent the [[task (project management)|tasks]] involved in completing a given [[project]]. 

First developed by the [[United States Navy]] in the 1950s, it is commonly used in conjunction with the [[critical path method]] (CPM).

== Overview ==
Project Evaluation and Review Techniques is commonly abbreviated to PERT.
PERT is a method of analyzing the tasks involved in completing a given project, especially the time needed to complete each task, and to identify the minimum time needed to complete the total project. It incorporates uncertainty by making it possible to schedule a project while not knowing precisely the details and [[Duration (project management)|durations]] of all the activities. It is more of an event-oriented technique rather than start- and completion-oriented, and is used more in projects where time is the major factor rather than cost. It is applied to very large-scale, one-time, complex, non-routine infrastructure and Research and Development projects.

Program Evaluation Review Technique (PERT) offers a management tool, which relies "on arrow and node diagrams of ''activities'' and ''events'': arrows represent the ''activities'' or work necessary to reach the ''events'' or nodes that indicate each completed phase of the total project."&lt;ref name="MB 1968"/&gt;

PERT and CPM are complementary tools, because "CPM employs one time estimate and one cost estimate for each activity; PERT may utilize three time estimates (optimistic, expected, and pessimistic) and no costs for each activity. Although these are distinct differences, the term PERT is applied increasingly to all critical path scheduling."&lt;ref name="MB 1968"/&gt;

==History==
"PERT" was developed primarily to simplify the planning and scheduling of large and complex projects. It was developed for the [[United States Navy Special Projects Office|U.S. Navy Special Projects Office]] in 1957 to support the U.S. Navy's Polaris nuclear submarine project.&lt;ref name="MRCW 1959"&gt;Malcolm, D. G., J. H. Roseboom, C. E. Clark, [[Willard Fazar|W. Fazar]]. "Application of a Technique for Research and Development Program Evaluation," ''OPERATIONS RESEARCH,'' Vol. 7, No. 5, September–October 1959, pp. 646–669&lt;/ref&gt; It found applications all over industry. An early example was it was used for the [[1968 Winter Olympics]] in [[Grenoble]] which applied PERT from 1965 until the opening of the 1968 Games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1968/or1968.pdf 1968 Winter Olympics official report.] p. 49. Accessed 1 November 2010. {{en icon}} &amp; {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project model was the first of its kind, a revival for [[scientific management]], founded by Frederick Taylor ([[Taylorism]]) and later refined by Henry Ford ([[Fordism]]). [[DuPont]]'s [[critical path method]] was invented at roughly the same time as PERT.

[[File:PERT Summary Report Phase 2, 1958.jpg|thumb|upright|''PERT Summary Report Phase 2'', 1958]]
Initially PERT stood for ''Program Evaluation Research Task,'' but by 1959 was already renamed.&lt;ref name="MRCW 1959"/&gt; It had been made public in 1958 in two publications of the U.S. Department of the Navy, entitled ''Program Evaluation Research Task, Summary Report, Phase 1.''&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dept. of the Navy. ''[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/735902.pdf Program Evaluation Research Task, Summary Report, Phase 1].'' Washington, D.C., Government Printing Office, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''Phase 2.''&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dept. of the Navy. ''[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100954569 Program Evaluation Research Task, Summary Report, Phase 2].'' Washington, D.C., Government Printing Office, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1959 article in  ''The American Statistician'' the main [[Willard Fazar]], Head of the Program Evaluation Branch, Special Projects Office, U.S. Navy, gave a detailed description of the main concepts of the PERT. He explained:

{{Quote|Through an electronic computer, the PERT technique processes data representing the major, finite accomplishments (events) essential to achieve end-objectives; the inter-dependence of those events; and [[Estimation (project management)|estimates]] of time and range of time necessary to complete each activity between two successive events. Such time expectations include estimates of "most likely time", "optimistic time", and "pessimistic time" for each activity. The technique is a management control tool that sizes up the outlook for meeting objectives on time; highlights danger signals requiring management decisions; reveals and defines both methodicalness and slack in the flow plan or the network of sequential activities that must be performed to meet objectives; compares current expectations with [[Schedule (project management)|scheduled]] completion dates and computes the probability for meeting scheduled dates; and simulates the effects of options for decision&amp;nbsp;— before decision.&lt;br /&gt;The concept of PERT was developed by an operations research team staffed with representatives from the Operations Research Department of [[Booz Allen Hamilton]]; the Evaluation Office of the [[Lockheed Martin Space Systems|Lockheed Missile Systems Division]]; and the Program Evaluation Branch, Special Projects Office, of the Department of the Navy.&lt;ref name="SDFJWM 1959"&gt;[[Willard Fazar]] cited in: B. Ralph Stauber, H. M. Douty, Willard Fazar, Richard H. Jordan, William Weinfeld and Allen D. Manvel. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2682310 Federal Statistical Activities]." ''The American Statistician'' 13(2): 9-12 (Apr., 1959) , pp. 9-12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:PERT Guide for management use, June 1963.jpg|thumb|upright|''PERT Guide for management use'', June 1963]]
Ten years after the introduction of PERT in 1958 the American [[librarian]] Maribeth Brennan published a selected [[bibliography]] with about 150 publications on PERT and CPM, which had been published between 1958 and 1968. The origin and development was summarized as follows:
{{Quote|PERT originated in 1958 with the... [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris missile]] design and construction scheduling. Since that time, it has been used extensively not only by the [[aerospace industry]] but also in many situations where management desires to achieve an objective or complete a task within a scheduled time and cost expenditure; it came into popularity when the algorithm for calculating a maximum value path was conceived. PERT and CPM may be calculated manually or with a computer, but usually they require major computer support for detailed projects. A number of colleges and universities now offer instructional courses in both.&lt;ref name="MB 1968"&gt;Brennan, Maribeth, ''PERT and CPM: a selected bibliography,''  Monticello, Ill., Council of Planning Librarians, 1968. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For the subdivision of work units in PERT&lt;ref&gt;Desmond L. Cook (1966), ''Program Evaluation and Review Technique.'' p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; another tool was developed: the [[Work Breakdown Structure]]. The Work Breakdown Structure provides "a framework for complete networking, the Work Breakdown Structure was formally introduced as the first item of analysis in carrying out basic PERT/COST."&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Bright Maynard]] (1967), ''Handbook of Business Administration.'' p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
=== Events and activities ===
In a PERT diagram, the main building block is the ''event'', with connections to its known predecessor events and successor events.
* ''PERT event'': a point that marks the start or completion of one or more activities. It consumes no time and uses no resources. When it marks the completion of one or more activities, it is not "reached" (does not occur) until ''all'' of the activities leading to that event have been completed.
* ''predecessor event'': an event that immediately precedes some other event without any other events intervening. An event can have multiple predecessor events and can be the predecessor of multiple events.
* ''successor event'': an event that immediately follows some other event without any other intervening events. An event can have multiple successor events and can be the successor of multiple events.

Besides events, PERT also knows activities and sub-activities:
* ''PERT activity'': the actual performance of a task which consumes time and requires resources (such as labor, materials, space, machinery). It can be understood as representing the time, effort, and resources required to move from one event to another. A PERT activity cannot be performed until the predecessor event has occurred.
* ''PERT sub-activity'': a PERT activity can be further decomposed into a set of sub-activities. For example, activity A1 can be decomposed into A1.1, A1.2 and A1.3. Sub-activities have all the properties of activities; in particular, a sub-activity has predecessor or successor events just like an activity. A sub-activity can be decomposed again into finer-grained sub-activities.

=== Time ===
PERT has defined four types of time required to accomplish an activity:
* ''optimistic time'': the minimum possible time required to accomplish an activity (o) or a path (O), assuming everything proceeds better than is normally expected
* ''pessimistic time'': the maximum possible time required to accomplish an activity (p) or a path (P), assuming everything goes wrong (but excluding major catastrophes).
* ''most likely time'': the best estimate of the time required to accomplish an activity (m) or a path (M), assuming everything proceeds as normal.
* ''expected time'': the best estimate of the time required to accomplish an activity (te) or a path (TE), accounting for the fact that things don't always proceed as normal (the implication being that the expected time is the average time the task would require if the task were repeated on a number of occasions over an extended period of time).
::: '''te''' =  ('''o''' + '''4m''' + '''p''') ÷ '''6'''
:::&lt;math&gt;TE = \sum_{i=1}^n te_i&lt;/math&gt;
* ''standard deviation of time'' : the variability of the time for accomplishing an activity (σ&lt;sub&gt;te&lt;/sub&gt;) or a path (σ&lt;sub&gt;TE&lt;/sub&gt;)
::: '''σ&lt;sub&gt;te&lt;/sub&gt;''' =  ('''p''' - '''o''') ÷ '''6'''
:::&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{TE} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n {\sigma_{te_i}}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Management tools ===
PERT supplies a number of tools for management with determination of concepts, such as:
* ''[[Float (project management)|float]] or [[Float (project management)|slack]]'' is a measure of the excess time and resources available to complete a task. It is the amount of time that a project task can be delayed without causing a delay in any subsequent tasks (''free float'') or the whole project (''total float''). Positive slack would indicate ''ahead of schedule''; negative slack would indicate ''behind schedule''; and zero slack would indicate ''on schedule''.
* ''[[critical path method|critical path]]'': the longest possible continuous pathway taken from the initial event to the terminal event. It determines the total calendar time required for the project; and, therefore, any time delays along the critical path will delay the reaching of the terminal event by at least the same amount.
* ''critical activity'': An activity that has total float equal to zero. An activity with zero float is not necessarily on the critical path since its path may not be the longest.
* ''[[wikt:lead#Verb_2|Lead]] time'': the time by which a ''predecessor event'' must be completed in order to allow sufficient time for the activities that must elapse before a specific PERT event reaches completion.
* ''lag time'': the earliest time by which a ''successor event'' can follow a specific PERT event.
* ''[[Critical path method|fast tracking]]'': performing more critical activities in parallel
* ''[[Critical path method|crashing critical path]]'': Shortening duration of critical activities

==Implementation==

The first step to scheduling the project is to determine the tasks that the project requires and the order in which they must be completed.  The order may be easy to record for some tasks e.g.When building a house, the land must be graded before the foundation can be laid) while difficult for others (there are two areas that need to be graded, but there are only enough bulldozers to do one).  Additionally, the time estimates usually reflect the normal, non-rushed time.  Many times, the time required to execute the task can be reduced for an additional cost or a reduction in the quality.

=== Example ===
In the following example there are seven tasks, labeled ''A'' through ''G''.  Some tasks can be done concurrently (''A'' and ''B'') while others cannot be done until their predecessor task is complete (''C'' cannot begin until ''A'' is complete).  Additionally, each task has three time estimates: the optimistic time estimate (''o''), the most likely or normal time estimate (''m''), and the pessimistic time estimate (''p'').  The expected time (''te'') is computed using the formula (''o'' + 4''m'' + ''p'') ÷ 6.

Once this step is complete, one can draw a [[Gantt chart]] or a network diagram.

Note (1) the [[critical path method|critical path]] is in red, (2) the [[Float (project management)|slack]] is the black lines connected to non-critical activities, (3) since Saturday and Sunday are not work days and are thus excluded from the schedule, some bars on the Gantt chart are longer if they cut through a weekend.]]
:[[Image:Pert example gantt chart.png|frame|none|A Gantt chart created using [[OmniPlan]].  Note (1) the [[critical path method|critical path]] is highlighted, (2) the [[Float (project management)|slack]] is not specifically indicated on task 5 (d), though it can be observed on tasks 3 and 7 (b and f), (3) since weekends are indicated by a thin vertical line, and take up no additional space on the work calendar, bars on the Gantt chart are not longer or shorter when they do or don't carry over a weekend.]]

=== Next step, creating network diagram by hand or by using diagram software ===
A network diagram can be created by hand or by using diagram software.  There are two types of network diagrams, activity on arrow ([[Arrow Diagramming Method|AOA]]) and activity on node ([[Precedence Diagram Method|AON]]).  Activity on node diagrams are generally easier to create and interpret.  To create an AON diagram, it is recommended (but not required) to start with a node named ''start''.  This &lt;nowiki&gt;"activity"&lt;/nowiki&gt; has a duration of zero (0).  Then you draw each activity that does not have a predecessor activity (''a'' and ''b'' in this example) and connect them with an arrow from start to each node.  Next, since both ''c'' and ''d'' list ''a'' as a predecessor activity, their nodes are drawn with arrows coming from ''a''.  Activity ''e'' is listed with ''b'' and ''c'' as predecessor activities, so node ''e'' is drawn with arrows coming from both ''b'' and ''c'', signifying that ''e'' cannot begin until both ''b'' and ''c'' have been completed.  Activity ''f'' has ''d'' as a predecessor activity, so an arrow is drawn connecting the activities.  Likewise, an arrow is drawn from ''e'' to ''g''.  Since there are no activities that come after ''f'' or ''g'', it is recommended (but again not required) to connect them to a node labeled ''finish''.

:[[Image:pert example network diagram.gif|frame|none|A network diagram created using [[Microsoft Project]] (MSP).  Note the [[critical path method|critical path]] is in red.]]

:[[Image:pert example node legend.GIF|frame|right|A node like this one (from [[Microsoft Visio]]) can be used to display the activity name, duration, ES, EF, LS, LF, and slack.]]

By itself, the network diagram pictured above does not give much more information than a Gantt chart; however, it can be expanded to display more information.  The most common information shown is:
# The activity name
# The expected duration time
# The early start time (ES)
# The early finish time (EF)
# The late start time (LS)
# The late finish time (LF)
# The [[float (project management)|slack]]

In order to determine this information it is assumed that the activities and normal duration times are given.  The first step is to determine the ES and EF.  The ES is defined as the maximum EF of all predecessor activities, unless the activity in question is the first activity, for which the ES is zero (0).  The EF is the ES plus the task duration (EF = ES + duration).

*The ES for ''start'' is zero since it is the first activity.  Since the duration is zero, the EF is also zero.  This EF is used as the ES for ''a'' and ''b''.
*The ES for ''a'' is zero.  The duration (4 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of four.  This EF is used as the ES for ''c'' and ''d''.
*The ES for ''b'' is zero.  The duration (5.33 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 5.33.
*The ES for ''c'' is four.  The duration (5.17 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 9.17.
*The ES for ''d'' is four.  The duration (6.33 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 10.33.  This EF is used as the ES for ''f''.
*The ES for ''e'' is the greatest EF of its predecessor activities (''b'' and ''c'').  Since ''b'' has an EF of 5.33 and ''c'' has an EF of 9.17, the ES of ''e'' is 9.17.  The duration (5.17 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 14.34.  This EF is used as the ES for ''g''.
*The ES for ''f'' is 10.33.  The duration (4.5 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 14.83.
*The ES for ''g'' is 14.34.  The duration (5.17 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 19.51.
*The ES for ''finish'' is the greatest EF of its predecessor activities (''f'' and ''g'').  Since ''f'' has an EF of 14.83 and ''g'' has an EF of 19.51, the ES of ''finish'' is 19.51.  ''Finish'' is a milestone (and therefore has a duration of zero), so the EF is also 19.51.

Barring any [[Theory of Constraints|unforeseen events]], the project should take 19.51 work days to complete.  The next step is to determine the late start (LS) and late finish (LF) of each activity.  This will eventually show if there are activities that have [[float (project management)|slack]].  The LF is defined as the minimum LS of all successor activities, unless the activity is the last activity, for which the LF equals the EF.  The LS is the LF minus the task duration (LS = LF − duration).

*The LF for ''finish'' is equal to the EF (19.51 work days) since it is the last activity in the project.  Since the duration is zero, the LS is also 19.51 work days.  This will be used as the LF for ''f'' and ''g''.
*The LF for ''g'' is 19.51 work days.  The duration (5.17 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 14.34 work days.  This will be used as the LF for ''e''.
*The LF for ''f'' is 19.51 work days.  The duration (4.5 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 15.01 work days.  This will be used as the LF for ''d''.
*The LF for ''e'' is 14.34 work days.  The duration (5.17 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 9.17 work days.  This will be used as the LF for ''b'' and ''c''.
*The LF for ''d'' is 15.01 work days.  The duration (6.33 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 8.68 work days.
*The LF for ''c'' is 9.17 work days.  The duration (5.17 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 4 work days.
*The LF for ''b'' is 9.17 work days.  The duration (5.33 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 3.84 work days.
*The LF for ''a'' is the minimum LS of its successor activities.  Since ''c'' has an LS of 4 work days and ''d'' has an LS of 8.68 work days, the LF for ''a'' is 4 work days.  The duration (4 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 0 work days.
*The LF for ''start'' is the minimum LS of its successor activities.  Since ''a'' has an LS of 0 work days and ''b'' has an LS of 3.84 work days, the LS is 0 work days.

=== Next step, determination of critical path and possible slack ===
The next step is to determine the [[critical path method|critical path]] and if any activities have [[float (project management)|slack]].  The critical path is the path that takes the '''longest''' to complete.  To determine the path times, add the task durations for all available paths.  Activities that have slack can be delayed without changing the overall time of the project.  Slack is computed in one of two ways, slack = LF − EF ''or'' slack = LS − ES.  Activities that are on the critical path have a slack of zero (0).

*The duration of path ''adf'' is 14.83 work days.
*The duration of path ''aceg'' is 19.51 work days.
*The duration of path ''beg'' is 15.67 work days.

The critical path is ''aceg'' and the critical time is 19.51 work days.  It is important to note that there can be more than one critical path (in a project more complex than this example) or that the critical path can change.  For example, let's say that activities ''d'' and ''f'' take their pessimistic (b) times to complete instead of their expected (T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;) times.  The critical path is now ''adf'' and the critical time is 22 work days.  On the other hand, if activity ''c'' can be reduced to one work day, the path time for ''aceg'' is reduced to 15.34 work days, which is slightly less than the time of the new critical path, ''beg'' (15.67 work days).

Assuming these scenarios do not happen, the slack for each activity can now be determined.

*''Start'' and ''finish'' are milestones and by definition have no duration, therefore they can have no slack (0 work days).
*The activities on the critical path by definition have a slack of zero; however, it is always a good idea to check the math anyway when drawing by hand.
** LF&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; – EF&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = 4 − 4 = 0
** LF&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; – EF&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 9.17 − 9.17 = 0
** LF&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; – EF&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = 14.34 − 14.34 = 0
** LF&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; – EF&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = 19.51 − 19.51 = 0
*Activity ''b'' has an LF of 9.17 and an EF of 5.33, so the slack is 3.84 work days.
*Activity ''d'' has an LF of 15.01 and an EF of 10.33, so the slack is 4.68 work days.
*Activity ''f'' has an LF of 19.51 and an EF of 14.83, so the slack is 4.68 work days.

Therefore, activity ''b'' can be delayed almost 4 work days without delaying the project.  Likewise, activity ''d'' '''or''' activity ''f'' can be delayed 4.68 work days without delaying the project (alternatively, ''d'' and ''f'' can be delayed 2.34 work days each).

== As project scheduling tool ==
=== Advantages ===
*  PERT chart explicitly defines and makes visible [[Dependency (project management)|dependencies]] (precedence relationships) between the work breakdown structure (commonly [[Work breakdown structure|WBS]]) elements.
*  PERT facilitates identification of the critical path and makes this visible.
*  PERT facilitates identification of early start, late start, and slack for each activity.
*  PERT provides for potentially reduced project duration due to better understanding of dependencies leading to improved overlapping of activities and tasks where feasible.
* The large amount of project data can be organized and presented in diagram for use in decision making.
* PERT can provide a probability of completing before a given time.

=== Disadvantages ===
* There can be potentially hundreds or thousands of activities and individual dependency relationships.
* PERT is not easily scalable for smaller projects.
* The network charts tend to be large and unwieldy, requiring several pages to print and requiring specially-sized paper.
* The lack of a timeframe on most PERT/CPM charts makes it harder to show status, although colours can help, ''e.g.'', specific colour for completed nodes.

=== Uncertainty in project scheduling ===

During project execution, however, a real-life project will never execute exactly as it was planned due to uncertainty. This can be due to ambiguity resulting from subjective estimates that are prone to human errors or can be the result of variability arising from unexpected events or risks. The main reason that PERT may provide inaccurate information about the project completion time is due to this schedule uncertainty. This inaccuracy may be large enough to render such estimates as not helpful.

One possible method to maximize solution robustness is to include safety in the baseline schedule in order to absorb the anticipated disruptions. This is called ''proactive scheduling''. A pure proactive scheduling is a utopia; incorporating safety in a baseline schedule which allows for every possible disruption would lead to a baseline schedule with a very large make-span. A second approach, termed ''reactive scheduling'', consists of defining a procedure to react to disruptions that cannot be absorbed by the baseline schedule.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1334">'''''Pukefejden''''' ("The Puke Feud") was a [[feud]] taking between the followers of [[riksråd]] [[Erik Puke]] and the followers of the later [[Charles VIII of Sweden]] in 1436-1437. 

The feud originated from the [[Engelbrekt rebellion]], as the Puke party accused the party of Charles of having murdered [[Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson]]. After the rebellion, many fiefs had been left without a holder, and after having failed to distribute them fairly among the nobility in 1436, the opposition around Puke challenged Charles in open [[civil war]]. A number of cities, [[Arboga]], [[Köping]] and [[Örebro]], rebelled, and the rebels defeated the forces of Charles in the [[Battle of Hällaskogen]] on 17 January 1437. During peace negotiations in [[Västerås]], Eric Puke was captured and brought to Stockholm, and was executed there in March 1437.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46802">[[Image:Dingyjump.jpg|thumb|350px|Booth's rule#2: "The safer skydiving gear becomes, the more chances skydivers will take, in order to keep the fatality rate constant"&lt;ref name=BoothsRule/&gt;]]
'''Risk compensation'''  is a [[theory]] which suggests that people typically adjust their [[behavior]] in response to the perceived level of risk, becoming more careful where they sense greater risk and less careful if they feel more protected. Although usually small in comparison to the fundamental benefits of safety interventions, it may result in a lower net benefit than expected.&lt;ref group=n&gt;{{harvtxt|Vrolix|2006}} "Behavioural adaptation generally does not eliminate the safety gains from programmes, but tends to reduce the size of the expected effects"&lt;/ref&gt;

By way of example, it has been observed that motorists drove faster when wearing [[seatbelt]]s and closer to the vehicle in front when the vehicles were fitted with [[Anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]]. There is also evidence that the risk compensation phenomenon could explain the failure of condom distribution programs to reverse [[HIV]] prevalence and that condoms may foster disinhibition, with people engaging in risky sex both with and without [[condom]]s.

By contrast, [[shared space]] is a highway design method which consciously aims to ''increase'' the level of perceived risk and uncertainty, thereby slowing traffic and reducing the number of and seriousness of injuries.

==Overview==
Risk compensation is related to the broader term [[adaptive behavior|behavioral adaptation]] which includes all behavior changes in response to safety measures, whether compensatory or not. However, since researchers are primarily interested in the compensatory or negative adaptive behavior the terms are sometimes used interchangeably.&lt;ref group=n&gt;{{harvtxt|Vrolix|2006}} "A term, closely related to risk compensation, is ‘behavioural adaptation’. Behavioural adaptation is a wider term referring to all behavioural changes triggered by a safety measure (OECD, 1997). Strictly spoken, this includes all positive and negative behavioural changes induced by road safety measures. Nevertheless, the emphasis is primarily put on the negative aspects of this phenomenon."&lt;/ref&gt; The more recent version emerged from [[road safety]] research after it was claimed that many interventions failed to achieve the expected level of benefits but has since been investigated in many other fields.&lt;ref group=n&gt;{{harvtxt|Vrolix|2006}} "Risk compensation is the term given to a theory which tries to understand the behaviour of people in potentially hazardous activities. In the context of the road user, risk compensation refers to the tendency of road users to compensate for changes in the road system that are perceived as improving safety by adapting behaviour (Elvik and Vaa,2004). So measures, designed to improve traffic safety, may bring along negative consequences in a way that individuals increase the riskiness of their driving behaviour because they feel safer (Dulisse, 1997)"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=n&gt;{{harvtxt|Hedlund|2000}} "The early risk compensation literature deals with road safety... Several recent studies examine risk compensation in response to both aggregate and specific consumer product and workplace safety regulations"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peltzman effect===
The reduction of predicted benefit from regulations that intend to increase safety is sometimes referred to as the '''Peltzman effect''' in recognition of [[Sam Peltzman]], a professor of economics at the [[University of Chicago Booth School of Business]], who published "The Effects of Automobile Safety Regulation" in the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'' in 1975 in which he controversially suggested that "offsets (due to risk compensation) are virtually complete, so that regulation has not decreased highway deaths".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=1830396|title=The Effects of Automobile Safety Regulation|first=Sam |last=Peltzman | volume=83|issue=4|pages=677–726|year=1975|doi=10.1086/260352|journal=Journal of Political Economy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peltzman claimed to originate this theory in the 1970s but it was used to oppose the requirement of safety equipment on trains in the Nineteenth Century {{harv|Adams|1879}}. A reanalysis of his original data found numerous errors and his model failed to predict fatality rates before regulation {{harv|Robertson|1977}}. According to Peltzman, regulation was at best useless, at worst counterproductive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11127-009-9548-2|title="Rubbin' is racin": evidence of the Peltzman effect from NASCAR|volume=142|issue=3–4 |journal=Public Choice|pages=507–513|quote="The Peltzman (1975) effect predicts that when automobile safety regulations are made mandatory, at least some of their benefits will be offset by changes in the behavior of drivers |year=2010 |last1=Pope |first1=Adam T.|last2=Tollison|first2=Robert D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=n&gt;{{harvtxt|Hedlund|2000}} "This conclusion startled the road safety community and challenged the role of government in attempting to improve safety through regulation. In Peltzman's view, government regulation was useless and perhaps even counterproductive."&lt;/ref&gt; Peltzman found that the level of risk compensation in response to highway safety regulations was ''complete'' in original study. But "Peltzman’s theory does not predict the magnitude of risk compensatory behaviour." Substantial further empirical work has found that the effect exists in many contexts but generally offsets less than half of the direct effect.{{sfn|Vrolix|2006}} In the U.S., motor vehicle fatalities per population declined by more than half from the beginning of regulation in the 1960s through 2012. Vehicle safety standards accounted for most of the reduction augmented by seat belt use laws, changes in the minimum drinking age, and reductions in teen driving {{harv|Robertson|2015}}.

The Peltzman effect can also result in a redistributing effect where the consequences of risky behaviour are increasingly felt by innocent parties (see [[moral hazard]]). By way of example, if a risk-tolerant driver responds to driver-safety interventions, such as compulsory [[seat belt]]s, [[crumple zone]]s, ABS etc. by driving faster with less attention, then this can result in increases in injuries and deaths to pedestrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mautc.psu.edu/docs/WVU-2006-02.pdf|title=Safety Externalities of SUVs on Passenger Cars: An Analysis Of the Peltzman Effect Using FARS Data|author1=David R. Martinelli|author2=Maria-Paulina Diosdado-De-La-Pena|publisher=West Virginia University 2008|quote="In general, safety regulation did decrease the probability of death for drivers, but this is offset by involving themselves in a riskier behavior, which reassigns the change of deaths from vehicle occupants to pedestrians}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk homeostasis===&lt;!-- [[Risk homeostasis]] redirects to this section --&gt;
Risk homeostasis is a controversial [[hypothesis]], initially proposed in 1982 by Gerald J. S. Wilde, a professor at [[Queen's University]] in Canada, which suggests that people maximise their benefit by comparing the expected costs and benefits of safer and riskier behaviour and which introduced the idea of the ''target level of risk''.&lt;ref group=n&gt;{{harvtxt|Wilde|1998}} "The level of risk at which the net benefit is expected to maximize is called the target level of risk in recognition of the realization that people do not try to minimize risk (which would be zero at zero mobility), but instead attempt to optimize it"&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed four constituents to a person's calculations relating to risk:&lt;ref group=n&gt;{{harvtxt|Wilde|1998}} "Besides macroeconomic influences, there are other factors that influence the level of accepted risk; these are of a cultural, social, or psychological kind. In general, the amount of risk that people are willing (in fact, prefer) to take can be said to depend on four utility factors and will be greater to the extent that factors..."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Expected benefits of risky behavior (e.g., gaining time by speeding, fighting boredom, increasing mobility)
* Expected costs of risky behavior (e.g., speeding tickets, car repairs, insurance surcharges)
* Expected benefits of safe behavior (e.g., insurance discounts for accident-free periods, enhancement of reputation of responsibility)
* Expected costs of safe behavior (e.g., using an uncomfortable seat belt, being called a coward by one's peers, time loss)

Wilde noted that when Sweden [[dagen H|changed from]] [[Right- and left-hand traffic|driving on the left to driving on the right]] in 1967, this was followed by a marked reduction in the traffic fatality rate for 18 months after which the trend returned to its previous values. He suggested that drivers had responded to increased perceived danger by taking more care, only to revert to previous habits as they became accustomed to the new regime.&lt;ref group=n&gt;{{harvtxt|Wilde|1998}} "In the fall of 1967 Sweden changed over from left hand to right hand traffic. This was followed by a marked reduction in the traffic fatality rate. About a year and a half later, the accident rate returned to the trend before the changeover."&lt;/ref&gt; A similar pattern was seen following [[H-dagurinn|Iceland's switch from left- to right-hand driving]].

In a [[Munich]] study, part of a fleet of [[taxicab]]s were equipped with [[antilock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] (ABS), while the remainder had conventional brake systems. In other respects, the two types of cars were identical. The crash rates, studied over three years, were a little higher for the cabs with ABS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=Over a period of 36 months they observed part of a taxi fleet in Munich, Germany. Half of the observed vehicles were equipped with an anti-lock braking system (ABS)... The overall accident rate showed a slight increase for ABS taxis, but no significant differences between cars with the superior brake-system (ABS) versus cars without the system|title=The Psychology of Risk Taking Behavior|author=Trimpop|first=R.M. |isbn=0444899618|year=1994|page=219|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rI4c24VTriEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilde concluded that drivers of ABS-equipped cabs took more risks, assuming that ABS would take care of them; non-ABS drivers were said to drive more carefully since they could not rely on ABS in a dangerous situation.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The idea of risk homeostasis is disputed. One author claimed that it received "little support",&lt;ref group=n&gt;{{harvtxt|Hedlund|2000}} "The extreme views of risk homeostasis have attracted little support"&lt;/ref&gt; another suggested that it "commands about as much credence as the flat earth hypothesis",&lt;ref group="n"&gt;{{harvtxt|O'Neill|Williams|1998}} "Risk homeostasis is not a theory.

==Examples==

===Road transport===

====Anti-lock brakes====
[[Anti-lock braking system]]s are designed to increase vehicle safety by reducing skidding.

A number of studies show that drivers of vehicles with ABS tend to drive faster, follow closer and brake later, accounting for the failure of ABS to result in any measurable improvement in road safety. The studies were performed in Canada, Denmark, and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Grant and Smiley, "Driver response to antilock brakes: a demonstration on behavioural adaptation" from Proceedings, Canadian Multidisciplinary Road Safety Conference VIII, June 14–16, Saskatchewan 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0001-4575(96)00083-8 |title=An investigation of behavioural adaptation to airbags and antilock brakes among taxi drivers |journal=Accident Analysis &amp; Prevention |volume=29|issue=3|pages=293–302|year=1997|last1=Sagberg|first1=Fridulv|last2=Fosser|first2=Stein|last3=Sætermo|first3=Inger-Anne F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aschenbrenner and Biehl, "Improved safety through improved technical measures? empirical studies regarding risk compensation processes in relation to anti-lock braking systems". In Trimpop and Wilde, Challenges to Accident Prevention: The issue of risk compensation behaviour (Groningen, NL, Styx Publications, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; A study led by Fred Mannering, a professor of [[civil engineering]] at the [[University of South Florida]] supports risk compensation, terming it the "offset hypothesis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Venere|first= Emil|year=2006|url=http://news.uns.purdue.edu/html4ever/2006/060927ManneringOffset.html|title=Study: Airbags, antilock brakes not likely to reduce accidents, injuries|work=Purdue University News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of crashes involving [[taxicab]]s in [[Munich]] of which half had been equipped with anti-lock brakes noted that crash rate was substantially the same for both types of cab, and concluded this was due to drivers of ABS-equipped cabs taking more risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psyc.queensu.ca/target/chapter07.html |title=Remedy by engineering? |publisher=Psyc.queensu.ca |year=1994 |first=Gerald J.

However, the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] released a study in 2010 that found motorcycles with ABS 37% less likely to be involved in a fatal crash than models without ABS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ultimatemotorcycling.com/2012/motorcycle-abs-skepticism-debunked | title = Motorcycle ABS: Skepticism Debunked | date = 2012-05-16 |accessdate=2012-08-18 | publisher = Ultimate Motorcycling}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 study found that ABS reduced the risk of [[Multiple-vehicle collision|multiple vehicle crashes]] by 18 percent, but had increased the risk of [[Run-off-road collision|run-off-road crashes]] by 35 percent.&lt;ref name="monash.edu.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monash.edu.au/miri/research/reports/other/racv-abs-braking-system-effectiveness.pdf |title=Effectiveness of ABS and Vehicle Stability Control Systems |format=PDF |date=April 2004 | publisher = Royal Automobile Club of Victoria |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bicycle helmets====
A Spanish study of traffic accidents between 1990 and 1999 found that cyclists wearing [[bicycle helmet]]s who were involved in accidents were less likely to have committed a traffic law violation than unhelmeted cyclists, and that helmeted cyclists were no more likely to have committed a speeding violation in association with the accident than unhelmeted cyclists. The authors concluded that "although the findings do not support the existence of a strong risk compensation mechanism among helmeted cyclists, this possibility cannot be ruled out".&lt;ref name=Lardelli-Claret-et-al2003&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/ip.9.2.128 |title=Risk compensation theory and voluntary helmet use by cyclists in Spain |year=2003 |last1=Lardelli-Claret |first1=P |journal=Injury Prevention |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=128–32 |pmid=12810738 |last2=De Dios Luna-Del-Castillo |first2=J |last3=Jiménez-Moleón |first3=JJ |last4=García-Martín |first4=M |last5=Bueno-Cavanillas |first5=A |last6=Gálvez-Vargas |first6=R |pmc=1730952|display-authors = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one experimental study, adults accustomed to wearing helmets cycled more slowly without a helmet, but no difference in helmeted and unhelmeted cycling speed was found for cyclists who do not usually wear helmets.&lt;ref name="Fyhri2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.2011.01589.x |title=Risk Compensation and Bicycle Helmets |year=2011 |last1=Phillips |first1=Ross Owen |last2=Fyhri |first2=Aslak |last3=Sagberg |first3=Fridulv |journal=Risk Analysis |volume=31 |issue=8 |pages=1187–95 |pmid=21418079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motorists may also alter their behavior toward helmeted cyclists. One study by Walker in England found that 2,500 vehicles passed a helmeted cyclist with measurably less clearance (8.5&amp;nbsp;cm) than that given to the same cyclist unhelmeted (out of an average total passing distance of 1.2 to 1.3 metres).&lt;ref name="Walker2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.aap.2006.08.010 |title=Drivers overtaking bicyclists: Objective data on the effects of riding position, helmet use, vehicle type and apparent gender |year=2007 |last1=Walker |first1=Ian |journal=Accident Analysis &amp; Prevention |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=417–25 |pmid=17064655}}&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of these differences has been re-analysed by Olivier.&lt;ref name=OlivierBell2013&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0058777 |title=Effect Sizes for 2×2 Contingency Tables |year=2013 |editor1-last=Rapallo |editor1-first=Fabio |last1=Olivier |first1=Jake |last2=Bell |first2=Melanie L. |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=e58777 |pmid=23505560 |pmc=3591379}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also slides 40-45 in for further analysis by Olivier of the data from the Walker study.&lt;ref name=OlivierStatSocNSW2012&gt;{{cite web |last=Olivier |first=Jake |title=Mandatory helmet legislation in New South Wales: A statistical perspective |url=http://www.statsoc.org.au/objectlibrary/1198?filename=Mandatory%20helmet%20legislation%20-%20Jake%20Olivier.pdf |publisher=Statistical Society of Australia (NSW branch) |accessdate=2013-04-04 |date=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Rodgers re-analysed data which supposedly showed helmets to be effective and found both data errors and methodological weaknesses. He concluded that in fact the data showed "bicycle-related fatalities are positively and significantly associated with increased helmet use" and mentioned risk compensation as one possible explanation of this association.&lt;ref name="Rodgers"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rodgers GB |year=1988 |title=Reducing Bicycle Accidents: A Re-evaluation of the Impacts of the CPSC Bicycle Standard and Helmet Use |journal=Journal of Products Liability |volume=11 |pages=307–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Seat belts====
A 1994 research study of people who both wore and habitually did not wear [[seatbelt]]s concluded that drivers were found to drive faster and less carefully when belted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=8198694|year=1994|author1=Janssen|first1=W|title=Seat-belt wearing and driving behavior: An instrumented-vehicle study|journal=Accident Analysis and Prevention|volume=26|issue=2|pages=249–61|doi=10.1016/0001-4575(94)90095-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several important driving behaviors were observed on the road before and after the belt use law was enforced in Newfoundland, and in Nova Scotia during the same period without a law. Belt use increased from 16 percent to 77 percent in Newfoundland and remained virtually unchanged in Nova Scotia. Four driver behaviors (speed, stopping at intersections when the control light was amber, turning left in front of oncoming traffic, and gaps in following distance) were measured at various sites before and after the law. Changes in these behaviors in Newfoundland were similar to those in Nova Scotia, except that drivers in Newfoundland drove slower on expressways after the law, contrary to the risk compensation theory {{harv|Lund|Zador|1984}}.

In Britain in 1981 at a time when the government was considering the introduction of [[seat belt legislation]], [[John Adams (geographer)|John Adams]] of University College London, suggested that there was no convincing evidence of a correlation between the seat-belt legislation and reductions injuries and fatalities based on a comparison between states with and without seat belt laws. He also suggested that some injuries were displaced from car drivers to pedestrians and other road users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite techreport|last1=Adams|first1=John|url=http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~jadams/PDFs/SAE%20seatbelts.pdf|title=The efficacy of seatbelt legislation: A comparative study of road accident fatality statistics from 18 countries|publisher=Dept. of Geography, [[University College, London]]|year=1981|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623162149/http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~jadams/PDFs/SAE%20seatbelts.pdf|archivedate=2006-06-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Isles Report" echoed these concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport|last1=Adams|first1=John|url=http://john-adams.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/isles%20report.pdf|title=Isles Report|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams subsequently argued that the reduction in fatalities that followed the introduction of legislation could not be attributed with confidence to seat-belt use due to the simultaneous introduction of [[breath testing]] for driving under the influence of alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=http://john-adams.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2006/failure%20of%20seatbelt%20legislation.pdf|title=Clumsy Solutions for a Complex World: Governance, Politics and Plural Perceptions|pages=132–154|doi=10.1057/9780230624887_6|chapter=The Failure of Seat Belt Legislation|year=2006|last1=Adams|first1=John|isbn=978-1-349-28058-2|editor1= Marco Verweij |editor2=Michael Thompson|series=Global Issues Series |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a 2007 study based on data from the [[Fatality Analysis Reporting System]] (FARS) of the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] concluded that between 1985 and 2002 there were "significant reductions in fatality rates for occupants and motorcyclists after the implementation of belt use laws", and that "seatbelt use rate is significantly related to lower fatality rates for the total, pedestrian, and all non-occupant models even when controlling for the presence of other state traffic safety policies and a variety of demographic factors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Risk Compensation or Risk Reduction?

====Swedish change to driving on the right====
In Sweden, following [[Dagen H|the change from driving on the left to driving on the right in 1967]] there was a drop in crashes and fatalities, which was linked to the increased apparent risk. The number of motor insurance claims went down by 40%, returning to normal over the next six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Risk and Freedom: Record of Road Safety Regulation|author=John Adams|publisher=Brefi Press|year=1985|isbn=9780948537059}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|quote=On the day of the change, only 150 minor accidents were reported.

No traffic fatalities were linked to the switch. In fact, fatalities dropped for two years, possibly because drivers were more vigilant after the switch." Sweden finally began driving on the right side of the road in 1967 ''The Examiner'' Sept 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;{{harvtxt|Rudin-Brown |Jamson|2013}} "An example of risk overestimation in the short run is offered by the experience in Sweden when that country changed from left- to right-hand driving in the fall of 1967.  This intervention led to a marked surge in perceived risk that exceeded the target level and thus was followed by a very cautious behavior that caused a major decrease in road fatalities.  ...the accident rate returned to 'normal' within 2 years."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shared space====
{{main|Shared space}}
[[Shared space]] is an approach to the design of roads, where risk compensation is consciously used to ''increase'' the level of uncertainty for drivers and other road users by removing traditional demarcations between [[vehicle]] [[traffic]] by removing [[kerb (road)|curbs]], [[road surface marking]]s, and [[traffic sign]]s. The approach has been found to result in lower vehicle speeds and fewer road casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1057/udi.2008.13|url=http://www.hamilton-baillie.co.uk/_files/_publications/30-1.pdf|title=Towards shared space|journal=Urban Design International|volume=13|issue=2|pages=130–138|year=2008|quote=A recognition of ‘risk compensation effect’ prompts a fresh understanding of the adverse effects of measures such as traffic signals, signs, pedestrian guard rails and barriers on safety, and of their tendency to discourage informal physical activity. It may seem perverse to argue that well being can be improved through making spaces feel riskier, but that is the firm conclusion from both research, and from empirical studies|last1=Hamilton-Baillie|first1=Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Speed limits====
The control of traffic speeds using effectively enforced [[speed limit]]s and other traffic calming methods plays an important role in the reduction of road traffic casualties;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/road_traffic/world_report/en/index.html |title=World Report on Road Traffic Injury Prevention |publisher=[[World Health Organization]], [[World Bank Group]]|year=2004|language=|accessdate=2010-04-13|isbn=9789241562607|quote=In high-income countries, an established set of interventions have contributed to significant reductions in the incidence and impact of road traffic injuries.

A 1994 study conducted to test the risk homeostasis theory, using a [[driving simulator]], found that increasing posted speed limits and a reduction of speeding fines had significantly increased driving speed but resulted in no change in the accident frequency. It also showed that increased accident cost caused large and significant reductions in accident frequency but no change in speed choice. The results suggest that regulation of specific risky behaviors such as speed choice may have little influence on accident rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==== PrEP ====
While [[pre-exposure prophylaxis]] (PrEP) with anti-[[HIV]] drugs appears to be extremely successful in suppressing the spread of HIV infection, there is some evidence that the reduction in HIV risk has led to some people taking more sexual risks; specifically, reduced use of [[condom]]s in [[anal sex]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holt|first=Martin|last2=Lea|first2=Toby|last3=Mao|first3=Limin|last4=Kolstee|first4=Johann|last5=Zablotska|first5=Iryna|last6=Duck|first6=Tim|last7=Allan|first7=Brent|last8=West|first8=Michael|last9=Lee|first9=Evelyn|date=June 2018|title=Community-level changes in condom use and uptake of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis by gay and bisexual men in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia: results of repeated behavioural surveillance in 2013–17|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352301818300729|journal=The Lancet HIV|doi=10.1016/s2352-3018(18)30072-9|issn=2352-3018}}&lt;/ref&gt; raising risks of spreading sexually transmitted diseases other than HIV.

'''''Roget's Thesaurus''''' is a widely used English-language [[thesaurus]], created in 1805 by [[Peter Mark Roget]] (1779–1869), British [[physician]], [[natural theologian]] and [[lexicographer]]. It was released to the public on 29 April 1852.&lt;ref&gt;A History of Roget's Thesaurus
Werner Hüllen  http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199254729.001.0001/acprof-9780199254729&lt;/ref&gt; The original edition had 15,000 [[word]]s, and each new [[edition (book)|edition]] has been larger.&lt;ref name=karpeles&gt;[http://www.rain.org/~karpeles/rogetdis.html Roget's Thesaurus] Karcpeles Library&lt;/ref&gt;  Roget was inspired by the [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian]] teachings of Jeremy Bentham and wished to help "those who are painfully groping their way and struggling with the difficulties of composition [...] this work processes to  hold out a helping hand" &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=How to be Really Well Informed in Minutes: All you need to know about everything that matters from the popular 'Briefing' columns|last=The Week|first=|publisher=Ebury Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-09194-706-4|location=Croydon|pages=74-77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Karpeles [[Karpeles Manuscript Library Museum|Library Museum]] houses the original manuscript in its collection.&lt;ref name=karpeles/&gt;

The name "Roget" is [[trademark]]ed in parts of the world, such as the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipo.gov.uk/domestic?domesticnum=2055476 Case details for Trade Mark 2055476]&lt;/ref&gt;  By itself, it is not protected in the United States, where use of the name "Roget" in the title of a thesaurus does not necessarily indicate any relationship to Roget directly; it has come to be seen as a [[Genericized trademark|generic]] thesaurus name.&lt;ref&gt;"The name has become synonymous with the ''Thesaurus'', yet Dr Roget himself is a shadowy figure." Lloyd 1982, p.xiii&lt;/ref&gt; With it's hegemonic status, it became "a mark of civility". [[J. M. Barrie|J.M. Barrie]] stated "[&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Captain Hook]]] is not wholly evil [h]e has a Thesaurus in his cabin" &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Indeed, [[Sylvia Plath]] considered it her [[Desert Island Discs|desert island]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;book over the [[Bible]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Roget described his thesaurus in the foreword to the first edition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is now nearly fifty years since I first projected a system of verbal classification similar to that on which the present work is founded. Conceiving that such a compilation might help to supply my own deficiencies, I had, in the year 1805, completed a classed catalogue of words on a small scale, but on the same principle, and nearly in the same form, as the Thesaurus now published.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd 1982, p.xix&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Roget's Thesaurus'' is composed of six primary classes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://poets.notredame.ac.jp/Roget/contents.html Table of contents]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316070554/http://poets.notredame.ac.jp/Roget/contents.html |date=March 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each class is composed of multiple divisions and then sections. This may be conceptualized as a tree containing over a thousand branches for individual "meaning clusters" or semantically linked words. Although these words are not strictly [[synonyms]], they can be viewed as colours or connotations of a meaning or as a spectrum of a concept. One of the most general words is chosen to typify the spectrum as its headword, which labels the whole group.

Roget's schema of classes and their subdivisions is based on the philosophical work of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] (see [[Leibniz#Symbolic thought|Leibniz—Symbolic thought]]), itself following a long tradition of [[epistemological]] work starting with [[Aristotle]]. Some of [[Aristotle's Categories]] are included in Roget's first class "abstract relations". 

The book is updated regularly and each edition is heralded as a gauge to contemporary terms; but each edition keeps true to the original classifications established by Roget. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Naturally, it has critics calling it a book for the 'lexically lazy'. [[Simon Winchester]] believes it has allowed a "state of linguistic and intellectual mediocrity". &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Whilst Robert McNeil used the Thesaurus to rewrite, satirically for [[The Scotsman]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], the 'nunnery scene': "To vegetate or not to exist, that  is the knotty point. Whether 'tis haughtier in the cerebellum to grin and bear the pea-shooters and harpoons of unmentionable serendipity ..."   thus  highlighting the book's lost art form. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19839">Throughout the long history of [[consumer]] [[research]], there has been much interest regarding how consumers choose which [[brand]] to buy and why they continue to purchase these brands. '''Self-branding''' describes the process in which consumers match their own [[self-concept]] with the images of a certain brand.

People engaged in consumption do not merely buy certain [[product (business)|product]]s to satisfy basic [[needs]].   In fact, consumer buying [[habit (psychology)|habits]] are at a much deeper level.  Owning a certain brand can help consumers to express and build their own self-concept.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, A. Dwayne, and Tasaki, Lori H. (1992). The role and measurement of attachment in consumer behavior. Journal of Consumer Psychology, 2, 155-172.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kleine, Rober E, III, Kleine, Susan S., and Kernan, Jerome B. (1993). Mundane consumption and the self: A social-identity perspective. Journal of Consumer Psychology, 2, 209-236.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richins, Marsha L. (1994), Valuing things: The public and private meanings of possessions. Journal of Consumer Research, 21, 504-521&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, consumers will often only purchase certain trademarks when he/she finds a match between the brand image (communicated through advertisement, design of retail shop, or even package design) and his/her own self-concept. Thereby, the value of a brand also depends of its ability to help consumer to build and create self-concept.&lt;ref&gt;McCracken, Grant.(1989). Who is the celebrity endorser? Cultural foundations of the endorsement process. Journal of Consumer Research, 16, 310-321&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation of connections==

===Based on self-congruity theory===
The above explanation for self-branding can be summarized by Sirgy's self-congruity theory.&lt;ref&gt;Sirgy, M. Joseph (1986). Self-congruity: Toward a theory of personality and cybernetics. Self-congruity: Toward a theory of [[personality]] and [[cybernetics]]. pp. 226. Westport, CT, US: Praeger Publishers/Greenwood Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed that consumer [[behavior]] is partially determined by the similarity between consumers' psychological comparisons of the brand-user-image. This self-congruity affects consumption behavior of consumers through motives such as need for [[self-consistency]] (e.g. "I am a good student because I work hard to prepare for examinations and I always get good grades") and [[self-esteem]]. On the other hand, high self-congruity occurs when the consumers find appropriate match between their own [[self-image]] and the brand-image. Only high self-congruity would help consumers maintain and enhance [[Self (psychology)|self]] in a positive direction.&lt;ref&gt;Roger, Carl R. (1957). Client-Centered Therapy, Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Further from the above notions, high self-congruity will lead to positive [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] towards the [[brand]] and repeated purchase.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;

===Brand evaluation===
Besides assisting consumer to choose which product and brand to buy, the matching process between [[self-concept]] and image of brand and product also determines how consumers [[evaluate]] the brand and product. When we say that a brand has a positive brand-image, it means that the brand has established some strong, favorable and unique [[association (psychology)|associations]] with the consumer's self-image&lt;ref name="multiple3"/&gt; (e.g. iPods have a strong and explicit image of being trendy, fashionable and high-tech, a combination of brand image that is unique and valued by young people). These strong, favorable and unique associations can be mainly divided into two parts. They are image of users and the psychological benefits experienced by the users in buying this particular brand or product.&lt;ref&gt;Aaker, David A. (1991). Managing brand-equity: Capitalizing on the value of a brand name. New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, image of users means that when consumer evaluate the brand they will image the typical user of this particular brand and see whether they are similar to the typical user. [[Demographic]] and psychological profile of the typical user is usually a good source of information for consumer to make these comparisons.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Escalas, J. Edson, and Bettman, R. James (2003). You are what they eat: the influence of reference groups on consumers' connections to brands. Journal of Consumer Psychology, 13, 339-348.&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. if someone perceived themselves as a trendy youngster and valued advanced technology, the chance that they will buy an iPod for their own use is very high). Secondly, psychological benefits experienced by consumers include increase recognition by the peer group (i.e. social approval) and expression of how one would like other people to see and think of oneself (i.e. personal expression).&lt;ref name="multiple3"&gt;Keller, Kevin L. (1993). Conceptualizing, measuring, and managing customer-based brand equity. Journal of Marketing, 57,1-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constructing a self-concept==
When the set of brand associations are linked or connected to the [[Self (psychology)|self]], these associations can help consumers achieve certain goals. These goals include what they might become, what they would like to become, and what they are afraid of becoming. People are motivated to create a favorable and consistent self-[[Identity (social science)|identity]] based on [[self-enhancement]] (i.e. people over-emphasize favorable evaluations and minimize critical assessment of themselves) [[self-verification]] (i.e. people want to be known and understood by others according to their firmly held beliefs and feelings about themselves respectively).

===Self-enhancement===
In self-enhancement, the [[Impression formation|impressions]] individuals hold about themselves are often biased towards a positive direction.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; Therefore, they over-emphasize favorable evaluations and minimize critical assessment of self. People use brand to represent favorable self-images to others or to themselves.

The first aspect in self-enhancement is the need to maintain and enhance self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, Anthony G., Bellezza, Francis S.. and Banaji, Mahzarin R. (1988). Is self-esteem a central ingredient of the self-concept? Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 14, 34-45.&lt;/ref&gt; Another aspect is about [[social interaction]] (e.g. staff meetings). In terms of [[impression management]], people actively manage their presentation (e.g. the brand of garment) in front of other people so as to maximize the opportunity to gain positive feedback.&lt;ref name="multiple2"/&gt; On the other hand, people are also motivated to create a good impression (e.g. wearing a watch of big brand) in order to gain social approval and intrinsic satisfaction.&lt;ref name="multiple2"&gt;Schlenker, Barry R. (1980). Impression management: The self-concept, social identity, and interpersonal relations. Monterey, CA. Brooks/Cole.&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially true when the person has very high self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, Roy F., Tice, Dianne M., and Hutton, Debra G. (1989). Self-presentational motivations and personality differences in self-esteem. Journal of Personality, 57, 547-579.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-verification===
Self-verification refers to seek accurate information about self. In general, people seek and interpret situations and behavioral strategies that match their present self-conceptions. In contrast, they avoid situations and behaviors that derive contradictory information.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;

Self-verification can be achieved by two primary strategies. The first strategy is seeing more self-confirmatory evidence than actually exists. The second strategy is striving to affect the reactions of other people by developing a self-confirmatory environment, which includes displaying identity cues such as driving a certain brand of automobile.&lt;ref name="multiple2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="multiple4"/&gt;

It is found that people choose products and brand by imagining the [[prototypical]] users for each item in the choice set and choosing the items that maximizes their similarity to a desired prototypical user.&lt;ref&gt;Niedenthal, Paula M., Cantor. Nacy, and Kihlstrom, John F. (1985). Self to prototype matching: A strategy for social decision-making. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 48, 575-584.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compatibility of self-enhancement and self-verification===
It seems that it is incompatible to seek feedback that is favorable (self-enhancement) and at the same time seek accurate feedback regardless of favorability (self-verification). [[Social psychology]] shows that there are factors affecting the relative degree to which each feedback satisfied, e.g. cognitive resources,&lt;ref name="multiple4"&gt;Swann, William B., Jr. (1990). To be adored or to be known? The interplay of self-enhancement and self-verification. In E.Tory Higgins and Richard M. Sorrentino (Eds.)

Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 73, 1268-1283&lt;/ref&gt; or cognitive versus affective processes.&lt;ref name="multiple4"/&gt; More specifically, it is found that people with high self-esteem, high self-monitors (i.e. regulate their own behavior in order to "look good"), narcissists (i.e. self-love), and Type B personalities (i.e. patient, relaxed, and easy-going) are more likely than their counterparts to be influenced by self-enhancement motives as opposed to self-verification motives.&lt;ref&gt;Sedikides, Constantine, and Strube, Michael J. (1995). The multiply motivated self. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 21, 1330-1335.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of YouTube to promote a brand==

[[YouTube]] has become an increasingly popular platform for self-branding. As self-branding is known for its strategic placement of oneself through a media outlet, it is a commonplace for many individuals to post videos, clips, tutorials, and other visual aides under their channels. YouTube especially gives the individual the opportunity to upload and control the information that is distributed on themselves – as they are the ones creating, editing, and uploading the content. By controlling the information being displayed on their channels, it is possible to promote and market themselves on a wider scale as YouTube has millions cross paths with their site daily.&lt;ref name=Marwick&gt;{{cite book |last=Marwick |first=Alice|authorlink=Alice Marwick |date=2013 |title=Status Update: Celebrity, Publicity, and Branding in the Social Media Age}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through self-branding, developing one's self is not the only aspect of this self-marketing tactic. There is also the aspect of "authenticity" to validate their specialties, and also a "business-targeted self presentation".&lt;ref name=Marwick/&gt; This can be done through addressing the proper credentials or years of practice that has past throughout their practice of the topic or talent they relate themselves to.

The concept of self-branding a product can be seen particularly in the case of physical exercise gurus, beauty gurus, health gurus, food expert, and other gurus as well. This concept can be seen in the successful [[Michelle Phan]], who is a beauty guru on YouTube. Michelle Phan has a record of revealing intimate facts about her life through interviews, blogs, and YouTube videos. On her website michellephan.com, she has created an "about me" section to further her self-branding in efforts to give a brief introduction about herself and her passion for beauty related topics, tips, and advice. She states, "I'm passionate about being a makeup artist and teaching others how to look and feel fabulous in their own skin".&lt;ref name="michellephan.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michellephan.com/about-me/|title=ABOUT ME - Michelle Phan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also claims to help women raise their self-esteem and confidence levels. This is all done through "a safe space where makeup enthusiasts, fashion lovers, trendsetters, and beauty aficionados alike, can find inspiration, how-to advice, style news, easy DIY ideas, and tips".&lt;ref name="michellephan.com"/&gt;

YouTube gurus like Michelle Phan carry an image and a created identity. In an interview with fashionista.com, Michelle Phan stated that success in the blogging and video industry has to do with sending a message, vision, and brand identity.&lt;ref name="fashionista.com"&gt;http://fashionista.com/2014/04/michelle-phan-youtube-beauty-tutorials#awesm=~oF3B0ezXN1xUcR&lt;/ref&gt; She has said to be cautious of what she is affiliated with, as it can affect the relationship she has formed with her followers.&lt;ref name="fashionista.com"/&gt; Through presenting an identity through her YouTube channel, she and other YouTube gurus alike have launched their own products. For instance, Michelle Phan has created a line of cosmetics that include eye shadows, lipsticks, eyeliners, foundation, contour sticks, concealer, and other forms of makeup that are related to the content she chooses to upload on her personal YouTube channel. Michelle Phan's ability to self-brand through media such as YouTube gives her a competitive advantage. YouTube reports that "more than 1 billion unique users visit YouTube each month".&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/yt/press/statistics.html|title=Statistics - YouTube|first=|last=YouTube|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also states "over 6 billion hours of video are watched each month on YouTube".&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; Michelle Phan's channel is one of the channels YouTube claims is among the "thousands of channels that are making six figures a year".&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

==Development of concepts==
In the process of [[consumer socialization]], self-brand connections develop throughout [[childhood]] as a result of developmental changes. Major changes occur in the representation of self-concepts between early childhood and [[adolescence]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Morris (1986), "Self-Concept from Middle Childhood through Adolescence," in Psychological Perspectives on the Self, ed. Jerry Suls and Anthony Greenwald, Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum, 107–36.&lt;/ref&gt; As children grow older, they conceptualize the self in less concrete and more abstract terms. For example, a concrete thinker can recognize that John likes clothes; more abstract thinker can reflect on emotions, like [[affection]]. Self-concepts become more complex as children mature, with a greater variety of self-constructs used to describe the self.&lt;ref&gt;Montemayor, Raymond and Marvin Eisen (1977), "The Development of Self-Conceptions from Childhood to Adolescence," Developmental Psychology, 13 (4), 314–19.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Dixon and Street (1975) study, possessions were not part of self-concept descriptions for 6- to 8-year-olds but surfaced and increased in importance from 8 to 16 years of age.

Children recognize brand at an early age, as young as 3 or 4 years of age. John and Sujan (1990)&lt;ref&gt;John, Deborah Roedder and Mita Sujan (1990), "Age Differences in Product Categorization," Journal of Consumer Research, 16 (March), 452–60.&lt;/ref&gt; found that children 4–7 years of age used perceptual cues (shape, package color), whereas older children (8–10 years) used no observable conceptual cues (taste) as a basis for classifying products. They, in middle childhood (7–8 years of age) can name multiple brand products and request products by brand name.&lt;ref&gt;John, Deborah Roedder (1999), "Consumer Socialization of Children: A Retrospective Look at Twenty-Five Years of Research," Journal of Consumer Research, 26 (December), 183–213.&lt;/ref&gt; Their comparisons of the self-concept with brand take place on a concrete level that self-brand connections are straightforward in nature. For example, self-brand connections might be made on the basis of simply being familiar with or owning a brand.

Late childhood (10–12 years of age) begin heightened appreciation for subtle meanings imbedded in brand images converges with a trend toward defining the self in more abstract and complex terms. Brands gain recognition as useful devices for characterizing the self in terms of [[personality traits]], user characteristics, and [[reference group]]s.

As children move into adolescence, children have deeper self-brand connections because they think about brand in a very specific way—as having personalities and symbolizing group membership—that provides a natural link to their self-concepts. A greater understanding of the self, combined with social pressures to "fit in" and signal group membership, leads adolescents to be more vigilant about the social implications of owning certain brand. As a result, adolescents possess an even larger number of self-brand connections, which may be even more complex in nature.

==Reference group==
As mentioned in the [[social comparison theory]] proposed by [[social psychologist]] [[Leon Festinger]] in 1954, humans have a drive to evaluate themselves by examining their opinions and abilities in comparison to others. Consumers often use the images of other brands' users as a source of information for evaluating their own beliefs and perceptions about their own and others' social identities. They also actively construct self-concept using brand associations that arise through reference group.

In many consumer researches, reference group is a key concept for demonstrating the congruency between group membership and brand usage. It refers to the [[social groups]] that are important to a consumer and against which he/she compares oneself.  With different personal goals, individuals would take different types of reference groups. For example, if someone would like to verify his own current social identities, he tends to compare himself with a 'member group', to which it supposes he belongs to. For example, if a person considers himself to be intellectual and his member group of intellectuals tends to drive a Volvos, he may choose to drive Volvo too. Similarly, an 'aspiration group' is another type of reference group to which an individual aspires to belong. If a consumer wishes to be more hip, and he sees hip people wearing Versace clothing, he may choose to wear Versace clothing in an attempt to appropriate the hip associations of that brand.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Folkes, V.S. &amp; Kiesler, T. (1991). "Social Cognition: Consumers' Inferences about the Self and Others". In Thomas S. Robertson &amp; Harold H. Kassarjian (Eds), Handbook of Consumer Behavior, pp. 281-315. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
On the marketing level, companies gain an enduring competitive advantage by utilizing the association between brand and self-concept. This type of association is difficult for competitors to imitate. For example, in a sport consumption context, when consumer fans identify with the team (i.e., a branded organization) and rally together in expectation of victory, the team image is emphasized.

On the individual level, brand symbolism provides moderation effects for [[ingroup and outgroup|in-group and out-group]] association. For in-groups, a symbolic brand has a stronger communicating effect than a non-symbolic brand; for out-groups, only a symbolic brand used to differentiate one from out-group.

{{Sociology}}
'''Sociology of gender''' is a prominent subfield of [[sociology]]. Social interaction directly correlated with sociology regarding social structure. One of the most important social structures is [[Social status|status]]. This is determined based on position that an individual possesses which effects how he/she will be treated by society. One of the most important statuses an individual claims is gender.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qjjbCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=gender+roles+in+marriage#v=onepage&amp;q=gender%20roles%20in%20marriage&amp;f=false|title=Gender Roles: A Sociological Perspective|last=Lindsey|first=Linda L.|date=2015-10-14|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317348085|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public discourse and the academic literature generally use the term ''[[gender]]'' for the perceived or projected ([[Gender identity|self-identified]]) [[masculinity]] or [[femininity]] of a person.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Introduction==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2016}}
The term ''gender role'' was coined by [[John Money]] in a seminal 1955 paper where he defined it as "all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman."&lt;ref name="Basic-Concepts"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Money |first=John |authorlink1=John Money |last2=Hampson |first2=Joan G |last3=Hampson |first3=John |date=October 1955 |title=An Examination of Some Basic Sexual Concepts: The Evidence of Human Hermaphroditism |url= |journal=Bull. Johns Hopkins Hosp. |publisher=Johns Hopkins University |volume=97 |issue=4 |pages=301–19 |doi= |pmid=13260820 |quote=By the term, gender role, we mean all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman, respectively. It includes, but is not restricted to sexuality in the sense of eroticism. Gender role is appraised in relation to the following: general mannerisms, deportment and demeanor, play preferences and recreational interests; spontaneous topics of talk in unprompted conversation and casual comment; content of dreams, daydreams, and fantasies; replies to oblique inquiries and projective tests; evidence of erotic practices and, finally, the person's own replies to direct inquiry.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person's gender is complex, encompassing countless characteristics of appearance, speech, movement and other factors not solely limited to [[biological sex]]. Societies tend to have [[Wiktionary:binary|binary]] [[gender systems]] in which everyone is categorized as [[male]] or [[female]]. Some societies include a [[third gender]] role; for instance, the Native American [[Two-Spirit]] people and the [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]]s of India. There is debate over the extent to which gender is a [[social construct]] or a [[Sex differences in humans|biological construct .]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|publisher=Basic Books|year=2000|isbn=978-0465077144|location=New York|pages=|via=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In feminist theory==
{{Main|Feminist theory|Feminist sociology}}

During the 1970s, there was no consensus about how the terms were to be applied. In the 1974 edition of ''Masculine/Feminine or Human'', the author uses "innate gender" and  "learned sex roles", but in the 1978 edition, the use of ''sex'' and ''gender'' is reversed. By 1980, most feminist writings had agreed on using ''gender'' only for socioculturally adapted traits.

Liberal feminism is the belief that individuals should be free to develop their own talents and pursue their interests. Individuals seek to expand equality by removing the barriers in society. Socialist feminism thinks that capitalism strengthens patriarchy by concentrating wealth and power in the hands of a few. The traditional family structure should be replaced by a collective revolution. In Radical feminism, they believe that patriarchy is so deeply rooted in society that even a sociological revolution would not end it; Society must eliminate gender itself.

==Other languages==
In English, both ''sex'' and ''gender'' are used in contexts where they could not be substituted (sexual intercourse; anal sex; safe sex; sex worker; sex slave). Other languages, like [[German language|German]], use the same word ''Geschlecht'' to refer both to grammatical gender and to biological sex, making the distinction between ''sex'' and ''gender'' advocated by some anthropologists difficult. In some contexts, German has adopted the English loan-word ''gender'' to achieve this distinction. Sometimes 'Geschlechtsidentität' is used as gender (although it literally means ''gender identity'') and 'Geschlecht' as sex (translation of [[Judith Butler]]'s ''[[Gender Trouble]]''). More common is the use of modifiers: ''biologisches Geschlecht'' for ''sex'', ''Geschlechtsidentität'' for ''gender identity'' and ''Geschlechterrolle'' for ''gender role'' etc.

==U.S. media==

Media criticism is a reflection of the gender inequality in society through print, advertisements, television and music.  Media influences and reinforces the idea of [[The Beauty Myth]] as discussed in [[Naomi Wolf]]'s book, The Beauty Myth: How Images of Beauty Are Used Against Women, which refers to unrealistic standards of beauty for women.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Naomi. The Beauty Myth: how images of beauty are used against women. N.p.: Perennial, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that the mainstream media perpetuates the idea of hetero-masculinity by portraying men as dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Kimmel, Michael. Guyland: The Perilous World Where Boys Become Men . New York : HarperCollins, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Some also argue that the media objectifies and oppresses women, and men who don't fall into the heteronormative category.&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, S. (1999). "Never Just Pictures" in Twilight Zones: The Hidden Life of Cultural Images from Plato to O.J. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oppression ===

Through the media, men are taught to be ultra-masculine by being desensitized, violent, and physically strong.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, J. (2002) 8 Reasons Why Eminem's Popularity is a Disaster for Women.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other forms of media that often portray the ultra-masculine figure are advertisements, specifically beer commercials.  These forms encourage men to oppress other men if they do not fit the ideals of heteromasculinity.&lt;ref&gt;Strate, L. (2004) "Beer Commercials: A manual for masculinity" in Kimmel, M. S., &amp; Messner (Eds.), M. A. Men's Lives (6th ed.). Boston: Allyn and Bacon. pp. 533-543.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Objectification of women ===
{{See also|Sexualisation}}

Objectification of women refers to instances in the media in which women may be viewed as, or directly compared to, insentient objects that can be acquired and/or possessed. This can be examined in the context of advertisements, where objects may be anthropomorphized and given feminine qualities or aspects of the female form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/objectify.|title=Definition of OBJECTIFY|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some studies indicate that widespread objectification of women in the media may have significant repercussions on society, such as low self-esteem and/or eating disorders among women.&lt;ref&gt;Greening, Kacey D. "The Objectification and Dismemberment of Women in the Media." Undergraduate Research Journal for the Human Sciences (2004): n. pag. URC. Web. 8 Nov. 2011. &lt;http://www.kon.org/urc/v5/greening.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender and socialization==
{{See also|Socialization#Gender socialization}}
Socialization theory offers a straightforward account of the acquisition of gendered identities. Infants are seen as blank slates, waiting to be written down on by their environment. Through their interactions with people close to them and exposure to the values of their society, infants learn what sex is attributed to them and what roles they are expected to learn. Reinforcement (through rewarding gender-appropriate behavior and punishing what may seem as deviant behavior) socializes children into their genders.&lt;ref name="thorne"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender Play: Girls and Boys in School|author=Thorne, Barrie|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-8135-1923-3|location=New Brunswick, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents, for example, are far more likely to engage with their sons in rough physical play than they are with their daughters, and it has been argued that long-term consequences may follow (in this case, a head start for boys in the development of physical violence and aggressiveness.)&lt;ref&gt;Mcdonald, K. and R.D. Park (1986). Parent-child physical play, Sex Roles, Vol.15, pp.367-378&lt;/ref&gt;

Parents and family can influence the way that a child develops their view of gender. These types of influences can include parental attitudes and difference of treatment regarding male and female children. Researcher Susan Witt claims that parents also expose children to gender from the time they are born via specific toys, colors, and names associated with genders in the binary. Witt suggests that parental attitudes about gender can differ from male to female children and that these attitudes develop quickly after a child's birth.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Witt|first1=Susan|title=Parental Influence on Children's Socialization to Gender Roles|journal=Adolesncence|date=Summer 1997|volume=32|issue=126|pages=253–260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Susan Grieshaber, in "Constructing the Gendered Infant", suggests that attitudes regarding pregnancy change after parents find out the sex of their child, subsequently changing parental attitudes towards the unborn child. According to Grieshaber's theory, once parents determine the sex of their unborn child, they assume a gender while planning for the child's arrival. Because of this, Grieshaber claims that infants are born into a gendered world where they never know anything other than the gender traits that are assumed due to their sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in Early Childhood|last=Yelland|first=Nicola|last2=Grieshaber|first2=Susan|publisher=|year=1998|isbn=0-415-15409-X|location=New York, New York|pages=15–35|chapter=Constructing the Gendered Infant}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Kara Smith utilizes similar theory throughout the analysis of her pregnancy journals kept throughout her second pregnancy. Smith concluded that her attitude towards her child changed after learning that her child’s sex was male. Smith's claim is reflected in changes in tone of voice when talking to the unborn child as well as differences in physical touch of her stomach throughout the rest of her pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Kara|date=2005|title=Prebirth Gender Talk: A Case Study in Prenatal Socialization|url=|journal=Women and Language|volume=28|pages=49–53|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory of gender socialization, discussed by Susan McHale, is that the gender roles and attitudes of older siblings can impact the gender roles adopted by younger children. Throughout the findings of McHale's study, it is maintained that parents still have the most familial influence on childhood socialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McHale|first=Susan|date=2001|title=Sibling Influences on Gender Development in Middle Childhood and Early Adolescence: A Longitudinal Study|url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/H_Helms_Sibling_2001.pdf|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=37|pages=115–125|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.37.1.115|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time children reach the age of three, many will have acquired a firm sense of themselves as male or female, a gender identity that remains throughout life. In addition, many pre-schoolers develop a firm awareness of [[gender stereotypes]], insisting that certain activities or items of clothing are not for girls and others not for boys. Yet gender identity does not automatically follow from biological sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|date=2000|title=The Five Sexes, Revisited|url=|journal=The Sciences|volume=40|issue=4|pages=18–23|via=|doi=10.1002/j.2326-1951.2000.tb03504.x|pmid=12569934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paradoxes of Gender|last=Lorber|first=Judith|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0-300-06497-1|location=New Haven|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adults respond differently to communicative efforts of boys and girls. A study of infants aged 13 months found that when boys demand attention - by behaving aggressively, or crying, whining or screaming - they tended to get it. By contrast, adults tended to respond to girls only when they used language, gestures, or gentle touches; girls who used attention-seeking techniques were likely ignored. There was little difference in the communicative patterns at the start of the study, but by the age of two, the girls have become more talkative and boys more assertive in their communicative techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fagot | first1 = B.I | year = 1985 | title = Differential reactions to assertive and communicative acts by toddler boys and girls | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 56 | issue = 6| pages = 1499–505 | doi=10.2307/1130468| pmid = 4075871 | jstor = 1130468 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The norms that are taught throughout childhood are influential in an individual's life because the ideas about gender that are typically taught by parents in early years are reinforced outside of the home.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A study done by Dr. Mick Cunningham states that the normative behaviors and attitudes that children observe can influence the way that these children grow up to structure their own households in adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cunningham|first=Mick|date=April 2001|title=Parental Influences on the Gendered Division of Housework|url=|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=66|issue=2|pages=184|doi=10.2307/2657414|via=|jstor=2657414}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normative gender roles can be reinforced outside of the household, adding power to these hegemonic ideas about gender. An analysis of children’s books in the twenty-first century, by Janice McCabe, suggests that this particular avenue of children’s media symbolically annihilates females, representing them about half as often as that of males. Underrepresentation such as this can affect children and their views of gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCabe|first=Janice|date=2011|title=Gender in Twentieth- Century Children's Books|url=|journal=Gender and Sociology|volume=25|issue=2|pages=197–226|via=PsychINFO|doi=10.1177/0891243211398358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children’s TV networks, such as Disney, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network have demonstrated a disproportional representation of males and females on their respective shows in a study done by Beth Hentges and Kim Case. According to Hentges and Case, there are less female characters across all three children’s networks; however, there is more propagation of stereotypical gendered behavior on Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon than that of Disney.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hentges|first=Beth|last2=Case|first2=Kim|date=2013|title=Gender Representation on Disney Channel, Cartoon Network, and Nickelodeon Broadcasts in the United States|url=|journal=Journal of Children and Media|volume=7|issue=3|pages=319–333|doi=10.1080/17482798.2012.729150|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Atypical Household Influence on Gender Socialization ===

Some children are raised in atypical households that challenge normative gender roles. In Jada Tidwell's study, she observes the play of children who come from households with lesbian feminist mothers (both single mothers and couples). Tidwell's observations consisted of both individual play as well as play integrated with the mothers. As a result of these observations, Tidwell asserts that atypical environments can affect children’s lives and ideas. According to Tidwell, households that challenge hegemonic cultural ideas ultimately give children a different perspective of gender than those of children raised in heterosexual, two parent households. In the families studied by Jada Tidwell, children reported ideas that both endorsed and challenged stereotypical gender roles at times.&lt;ref&gt;Tidwell, Jada Annette. “Gender Development in Children with Atypical Parental Socialization: An Example of Lesbian Feminist Mothers.” ''Georgia State University,'' US: ProQuest Information &amp; Learning, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In a different study, Abbie Goldberg observed toddlers from various types of households and how these children engaged in play. Goldberg's findings suggest that children whose parents are of the same gender tend to play in ways that are less adherent to stereotypical gender roles than children from heterosexual households.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Abbie|date=November 2012|title=Gender- Typed Play Behavior in Early Childhood: Adopted Children with Lesbian, Gay, and Heterosexual Parents|url=|journal=Sex Roles|volume=67|issue=9–10|pages=503–515|via=PsychINFO|doi=10.1007/s11199-012-0198-3|pmid=23420542|pmc=3572788}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Witt, in her article “Parental Influence on Children’s Socialization to Gender Roles’, advocates for androgynous gender roles in parenting, arguing that environments are more open minded about gender and encouraging to both their sons and daughters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Gender and psychoanalysis==
One of the most influential of the psychoanalytic theories of gender identity is the perspective developed in the book The Reproduction of Mothering. Its author, Nancy Chodorow, traces the implications for emotional development by linking them with the way mothers usually care for their infants in their formative years, while fathers are more emotionally distant. The development of an identity takes place as the infant gets more and more separated from his/her mother, with whom the infant is initially psychically merged. This process however operates differently for boys and girls. Girls can separate gradually, maintain a continuous sense of relationship with the mother, who is after all experienced as alike. For boys, on the other hand, separating from the mother, who is experienced as different, involves repressing the feminine aspects of themselves and rejecting their tenderness that was central to that early relationship. Boys' sense of maleness, according to Chodorow, is achieved at a great emotional cost.&lt;ref&gt;Chodorow, N. (1978). ''The Reproduction of Mothering'', Berkeley, CA, and London, University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, men grow up to have a more autonomous sense of self, and to be more independent, more instrumental and competitive in their dealings with others. They are also more likely to have difficulty expressing their emotions and to be anxious about intimacy. Women, on the other hand, have more ability and more need to sustain relationship with others.; they have greater empathy with others. They have difficulty however in maintaining the boundaries of an independent and autonomous self.

Chodorow however believes that these patterns aren't inevitable. Changes in the social arrangements for care of children such as dual parenting, which would involve fathers in emotional intimacy with their children, can break the cycle.

==Gender and the division of labor==
Before industrialization, economic activity, which centered around agricultural work, crafts and so on, was organized by households. Household members, whether male or female, young or old, contributed to the family's livelihood. Although women might do some types of work and men others, depending on region and class, the distinction between men as breadwinners and women as housewives didn't characterize pre-industrial divisions of labor.

Industrialization shifted much productive activity to factories, shops and offices. This separation of work from home signaled a profound change in gender relations and gender discourse. The home came to be understood not as the site of a family enterprise, but as a refuge from the world of work. Women were defined as the keepers of the home, as it was seen as their nature to create harmony and virtue rather than services and goods. Preindustrial society relied on gendered roles in the workforce to create equilibrium between men and women. Men were assigned the hunter role while women were assigned the domestic roles. Men were expected to supply food and shelter for the family while women were the caretakers for the children and their household. As centuries passed, this continued and created a divide in gendered roles in labor. Women remained dependent on men to provide, this dependence led to male roles being more valued in society which still remains in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Gender in conversation==
Some research has found that, in classroom settings, male students tend to talk more, and longer, than female students. This was determined to be particularly noticeable when the instructor is male.&lt;ref name=krupnick-1985&gt;{{cite web |last=Krupnick |first=Catherine G. |url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/html/icb.topic58474/krupnick.html |title=Women and Men in the Classroom: Inequality and Its Remedies |work=On Teaching and Learning, Volume 1 |year=1985 |accessdate=3013-06-23 |publisher=Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar results were found previously in hospitals by Erving Goffman in 1961, university discussion groups by Elizabeth Aries in 1972, and in corporate settings by Rosabeth Kanter in 1977.&lt;ref name=krupnick-1985/&gt;

=== Gender in the workplace ===
Women and men experience different types of mobility within the workplace. Women tend to experience a [[glass ceiling]], an invisible barrier that prevents them from moving up the corporate ladder. Men in jobs traditionally held by women, such as nursing, elementary school teaching, and social work, experience a "glass escalator" effect in which they are able to quickly ascend the job hierarchy to become managers and principals.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Christine L., "The Glass Escalator: The Hidden Advantages for Men in the "Female" Professions", Social Problems, 39(3), pp. 253-267&lt;/ref&gt; There also tends to be a [[gender pay gap]] between men and women, with women earning 77% as much as men.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}
 
One cause of the gender pay gap may be due to [[occupational segregation]], which pushes men and women towards gender-specific forms of employment, rather than pay discrimination. Another cause is the [[double burden]], a phenomenon in which women perform most of the unpaid childcare and household work despite being otherwise employed for pay. A third cause is [[occupational sexism]], one part of which favors men for promotions due to their traditional breadwinner status.&lt;ref&gt;Coltrane, Scott. 1997. Family Man: Fatherhood, Housework, and Gender Equity. Oxford University Press, USA&lt;/ref&gt; The 2001 class action lawsuit, [[Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.]], charged Wal-Mart with sexist hiring and promotion practices.

In addition, the emergence of [[transgender]] individuals in the workplace has begun to disrupt the gender binary of male and female.  By creating a hybrid gender identity,&lt;ref&gt;Connel, C. "Doing, Undoing, or Redoing Gender?: Learning from the Workplace Experiences of Transpeople."  Gender &amp; Society, 24(1), 31-55&lt;/ref&gt; the transgender community suggests notions of movement toward [[postgenderism]].{{peacock term|date=June 2013}}

== Intersectionality ==
[[Intersectionality]] is a [[Neo-Marxist]] concept stemming from a [[critical theory]] social analysis of [[class (social)|class]], [[race (human classification)|race]], and [[gender]]. The theory of intersectionality argues that forms of "inequality, oppression, and privilege" are shaped by interconnected axes of identity, and are mutually reinforced by social interactions and by social, political, and economic structures, such as capitalism, patriarchy, and institutionalized heteronormativity.&lt;ref name="Sarah Fenstermaker 1995"&gt;Candace West and Sarah Fenstermaker, "Doing Difference," Gender and Society 9, no. 1 (Feb 1995): 8-37.&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory of Intersectionality argues that race, class, gender, and other markers of identity are social constructions.&lt;ref&gt;West, C. Z. (1987). Doing Gender. Gender and Society, 1 (2), 125-151.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory argues against the assumption that systems of power relations are normative and can hold individuals accountable for their own character and efforts.&lt;ref name="Sarah Fenstermaker 1995"/&gt;

West &amp; Fenstermaker in their 1995 article ''[[Doing Difference]]'' offer that models that conceive gender, race and class as distinct axes are highly limiting in their understanding of the whole experience or identity of an individual. For example, they critique the additive model, in which the whole will never be greater (or lesser) than the sum of it parts. By analyzing each identity marker as an individual characteristic, we ignore the effect of the interconnection of these markers.&lt;ref name="Sarah Fenstermaker 1995"/&gt;

Additional sociologists have written about the intersectionality of class, race, and gender. Joan Acker outlines four gendered processes of intersectionality. The first includes procedures that create hierarchies based on gender and race. Another is the process in which social images and ideas condone gendered institutions. The third is a process of interaction between individuals and groups that, through communication, creates gender. The fourth is the internal labeling of the self and others to gendered personas.&lt;ref&gt;Acker, J. (1992). From Sex Roles to Gendered Institutions. Contemporary Sociology, 21 (5), 565-569.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evelyn Nakano Glenn]] critiques both the patriarchy model of gender, which ignores racial differences among oppressed women, and the internal colonialism model, which focuses on minority populations in general, ignoring gender differences.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, E. N. (1985). Racial Ethnic Women's Labor: The Intersection of Race, Gender and Class Oppression. Review of Radical Political Economics, 17 (85), 86-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Embodiment==

Embodiment may be defined as the ways in which cultural ideals of gender in a given society create expectations for and influence the form of our bodies. There is a bidirectional relationship between biology and culture; by embodying societally determined [[gender roles]] we reinforce cultural ideals and simultaneously shape, both temporarily and permanently, our bodies, which then perpetuates the cultural ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Connel, R.W. 2002. ''Gender: Short Introductions.'' Malden: Blackwell Publishers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; While there is actually more variation in body type within the male and female sexes than there is between the two sexes, embodiment exaggerates the perceived bodily differences between gender categories.&lt;ref&gt;Kimmel, Michael S. 2011. ''The Gendered Society.'' New York: Oxford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social embodiment, for both men and women, is variable across cultures and over time. Examples of women embodying [[gender norms]] across cultures include [[foot binding]] practices in Chinese culture, [[neck rings]] in African and Asian cultures, and [[corsets]] in Western cultures. Another interesting phenomenon has been the practice of wearing [[high heels]], which shifted from a masculine fashion to a feminine fashion over time. In the United States, the ideal body image and dimensions have changed for both women and men, with the body ideal [[female body shape]] becoming progressively slimmer and the body ideal for men becoming progressively larger.&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, Susan. 1999. "Never Just Pictures" in ''Twilight Zones: The Hidden Life of Cultural Images from Plato to O.J.'' University of California Press, pp. 107-138.&lt;/ref&gt;

These differences are epitomized in the example of children's toys; [[G.I. Joe]] dolls depict the physical ideals for boys and [[Barbie]] dolls embody the ideals for girls. [[The Beauty Myth]], as discussed in [[Naomi Wolf]]'s book The Beauty Myth: How Images of Beauty Are Used Against Women, refers to the unattainable standard of beauty for women, which sustains [[consumer culture]]. In contrast, men's bodies are also "dictated" by cultural ideals of gender, as is evident in consumer culture—especially beer commercials—in which men are portrayed as outdoorsy, tough, strong, and "manly."&lt;ref&gt;Buysse, J.A.M. and Embser-Herbert, M.S. "Construction of Gender in Sport: An Analysis of Intercollegiate Media Guide Cover Photographs." ''Gender and Society'', 18 (1), 2004, pp. 66-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexuality==

Sexuality encompasses both sexual behavior and sexual desire.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Pepper, and Virginia Rutter. 1998. The Gender of Sexuality. Thousand Oaks: Pine Forge Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Heteronormativity]] structures social life so that [[Heterosexuality]] is always assumed, expected, ordinary and privileged. Its pervasiveness makes it difficult for people to imagine other ways of life.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Stevi. 2006. Gender, sexuality and heterosexuality: The complexity (and limits) of heteronormativity. Feminist Theory 7:105-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Mass media works to glorify heterosexuality, which in turn lends to its pervasiveness and to its power.&lt;ref name="Martin, K.A. 2009"&gt;Martin, K.A., &amp; Kayzak, E. (2009). Hetero-Romantic Love and Heterosexiness in Children's G-Rated Films. Gender and Society, 23(3), 315-336.&lt;/ref&gt; Both ordinary and exceptional constructions of heterosexuality work to normalize heterosexuality; thus, it becomes difficult to imagine anything other than this form of social relationship or anyone outside of these bonds.&lt;ref name="Martin, K.A. 2009"/&gt;

There is a common perception of heterosexuality as the "natural" emotional and sensual inclination for [[Human sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;Rich, A. (1980). Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence. Signs, 5(4), 631-660.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, marital heterosexuality occupies the largely invisible core of normative and desirable sexuality, while all other sexualities are marginalized and considered perverse and unnatural.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, M. (2008). State of our Unions: Marriage Promotion and the Contested Power of Heterosexuality. Gender &amp; Society, 23(1), 27-48.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Kinsey]] created a Heterosexual-Homosexual Rating Scale called the [[Kinsey Scale]], which challenges the common perception of [[Human sexuality]] as strictly binary and directly linked to [[Gender]]. [[Drag queens]] are an example of "troubling" gender, complicating the understanding of sexuality in our society by causing people to think outside the binary of male/female.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, J. and Jasper, J.M. (eds). The Contexts Reader. New York: W.W. Norton, 2008. Pp. 247-253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedrich Engels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Engels|first1=Friedrich|title=Origin  of the Family, Private Property, and the State|date=1884|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/origin_family.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that in hunter-gatherer societies the activities of men and women, although different, had the same importance. As technological advances let to productive surplus, social equality and communal sharing gave way to private property and ultimately class hierarchy. With the rise of agriculture, men gained significant power over women. With surplus wealth to pass on to their heirs, upper class men wanted to ensure their sons were indeed theirs, which led them to control the sexuality of women. The desire to control property brought about monogamous marriage and family. Women were taught to remain virgins until marriage and remain faithful to their husbands thereafter, and to build their lives around bearing and raising one man's children.

==Masculinity==

[[Masculinity]] is a performed gender identity. Contrary to popular perception{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}, it is not the same as [[sex]] or [[sexual orientation]]. The contents and practices of masculinity are socially constructed and reproduced through daily interaction, especially on a more micro scale.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | title = Doing gender | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 125&amp;ndash;151 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243287001002002 | jstor = 189945 | date = June 1987 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243287001002002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/IV.%20Structures%20and%20Inequalities/1987%20West%20Zimmerman%20-%20Doing%20Gender.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists West &amp; Zimmerman emphasized that gender is maintained through accountability. Men are expected to perform masculinity to the point that it is naturalized. Thus, a man's status depends on his performance. It is important to note, however, that masculinity can be performed by any sex.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masculinity and Crime"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Krienert | first = Jessie L. | title = Masculinity and crime: a quantitative exploration of Messerschmidt's hypothesis | journal = [[Electronic Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | publisher = [[International Consortium for the Advancement of Academic Publication|ICAAP]] | date = July 2003 | url = http://www.sociology.org/content/vol7.2/01_krienert.html | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guyland&gt;{{cite book |last=Kimmel|first=Michael | author-link = Michael Kimmel |title= Guyland: The Perilous World Where Boys Become Men |year=2008 |publisher= [[Harper (publisher)|Harper]] |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-06-083135-6  |url= https://archive.org/details/guylandperilousw00kimm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doing Difference"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Fenstermaker | first2 = Sarah | title = Doing difference | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 8&amp;ndash;37 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/089124395009001002 | date = February 1995 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/089124395009001002 | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominant form of masculinity in a society is known as [[hegemonic masculinity]]. Men are constantly performing this to prove their status as men.&lt;ref name="hegemonic"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Connell | first1 = R.W. | last2 = Messerschmidt | first2 = James W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Hegemonic masculinity: rethinking the concept | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 829&amp;ndash;859 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243205278639 | date = December 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0891243205278639 | ref = harv| postscript = .}} [http://xyonline.net/sites/default/files/Connell,%20Hegemonic%20masculinity_0.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not really possible to reach it, especially as peers are in constant surveillance of each other, looking for flaws in their performance.&lt;ref name="hegemonic" /&gt; Hegemonic masculinity is constructed in opposition to [[femininity]] and is dominant to all other gender identities (including alternative masculinities). Men are [[socialization|socialized]] from birth to perform it, especially through behavior and symbolism. One of the prominent behaviors is aggression in order to protect one's reputation. An example of symbols used would be clothing.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Undoing Gender"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Connell | first = Catherine | title = Doing, undoing, or redoing gender?

Sociologist [[Michael Kimmel]] describes three cultures that support masculinity (especially in young men) in his 2008 book, ''Guyland'':
* The Culture of Entitlement: Men are raised to feel they deserve something. They feel entitled to power, sex and women.
* The Culture of Silence: Men are not to talk to outsiders (those not embedded in the cultures of masculinity) about drinking, bullying, rape, or any performance of masculinity by their peers that they may get in trouble for. If they do talk, they will be seen as unmanly traitors.
* The Culture of Protection: Communities do not hold men responsible for questionable and illegal actions. Many turn a blind eye, assuming their boys would never do that. Others write off dangerous acts as "boys will be boys".&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt;

Some of the prominent attitudes and behaviors of western hegemonic masculinity are: power, sexual dominance and activity, wealth, aggression, independence, and lack of emotion. Less extreme sexual harassment is often seen as normal behavior.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt; Exemplifying [[control theory]], the norms of masculinity are so rigidly ingrained that men find little room to escape and end up constantly reproducing them.

Hegemonic masculinity is often reproduced and reinforced through media and culture. "Media representations of men…often glorify men's use of physical force, a daring demeanor, virility, and emotional distance." Contemporary [[rap music]] is a striking example of masculinity on display. Rappers boast about their sexual conquests of women (emphasizing [[heterosexuality]] as well), wealth, power and violence.&lt;ref name="Rap Music"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Weitzer | first1 = Ronald | last2 = Kubrin | first2 = Charis E. | author-link1 = Ronald Weitzer | author-link2 = Charis E.

==Gender and violence==

Gender-based [[violence]] is the physical, [[Human sexuality|sexual]] or emotional harm or suffering enacted upon an individual as contextualized by societal [[gender]] norms. Violence affects the lives of millions worldwide, in all socio-economic and educational classes. It cuts across cultural and religious barriers, impeding the right of many to participate fully in society. Violence is about power, control, and domination. Systems of inequality and [[oppression]] interact positioning certain groups as particularly vulnerable to violence. Gendered violence takes place within a socially constructed power dynamic in which one ideology ([[masculinity]]) dominates another ([[femininity]]). What it means to be a woman in society is influenced and ascribed by the media, which acts a "powerful educational force". The media glamorizes [[violence against women]] cultivating a "toxic cultural environment" in which women are institutionally positioned as inferior and worthy objects of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Killing Us Softly 3: Advertising's Image of Women. Dir. Jean Kilbourne. Perf., 2000. DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;

Men are disproportionally the offenders, and women disproportionally the victims. Those that commit violent crimes are overwhelmingly male—[[rape]] (98%), armed [[robbery]] (92%), drunk driving (90%), [[murder]] (88%), aggravated assault (87%), arson (86%), and family violence (83%).&lt;ref&gt;Kimmel, Michael S. 2011. The Gendered Society. New York: Oxford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Michael Kimmel]], [[hegemonic masculinity]] creates a culture of entitlement, silence, and protection, which effectively normalizes violence against women and silences victims of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Kimmel, Michael S. Guyland: the Perilous World Where Boys Become Men. New York: Harpercollins, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence]] defines three social arenas in which violence commonly takes place (1) in the family—including [[domestic violence]], [[infanticide]], and traditional practices such as  [[female genital mutilation]], [[foot binding]], and [[bride burning]]; (2) in the community—including rape, sexual assault, [[sexual harassment]], and commercialized violence such as [[sexual slavery]], labor exploitation, female migrant workers; and (3) by the State—including violence against women in detention, and in situations of armed conflict such as [[systematic war rape]].&lt;ref&gt;"Women and Violence." Welcome to the United Nations: It's Your World. N.p., n.d. Web. 26 Nov. 2011. &lt;http://www.un.org/rights/dpi1772e.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to address and end gendered violence, solutions must address both the root causes and interpersonal manifestations of gender roles and power relations in order to ensure a balance of power at all levels of society.

==Globalization and gender==

[[Globalization]] refers to the increasingly global relationships of culture, people and economic activity. Globalization impacts female equality on a large and international scale, both negatively and positively.  With continuous changes in international relations, the perception of [[feminism]] in Western and Nonwestern societies is frequently revised.  It is important to be wary of Western bias in sociological accounts of global feminism, as Modern [[Western society]] is not always due credit for feminist reform in other cultures and countries.&lt;ref&gt;Ferree, Myra Marx. 2006. "Globalization and Feminism: Opportunities and Obstacles for Activism in the Global Arena" in Ferree, M.M. &amp; Tripp, A.M. (Eds.) Global Feminism: Transnational women's activism, organizing, and human rights. New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist sentiments – or a push for gender equality – emerge as a result of the nation-specific circumstances, not according to the exported beliefs of Western society.  Advances in female equality and status are often not the result of national groups or corporations, but of individuals and small groups.

One of the results of globalization is the increased use of female factory workers in nonwestern countries.  In Mexico, the female worker is ideal because she is seen as docile and inexpensive labor.  Stereotypical feminine traits such as beauty, domesticity, and docility are exaggerated and exploited for the production of goods.&lt;ref&gt;Salzinger, L. 2003. Genders in Production: Making Workers in Mexico's Global Factories. Berkeley: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;  These gender traits then frame the behavior of the women beyond the occupational realm.  Despite increasing feminism, the lack of economic and [[social mobility]] prevents women in many nations from having equal status in society.

One of the solutions to erasing gender inequalities globally, is to provide resources and funds to impoverished women who will in turn use them for [[education]] as well as business ventures.  The [[global economy]] could benefit drastically from incorporating educated women into the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/magazine/23Women-t.html|title=The Women’s Crusade|first1=Nicholas|last1=Kristof|first2=Sheryl|last2=WuDunn|date=17 August 2009|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Third gender ==
Throughout history, and around the world, the idea of a [[third gender]] has existed. In Native American culture, the [[Two-spirit|two spiririt]] had gender roles different from men and women. The [[muxe]] of southern Mexico are males who identify as neither male or female. In Samoa the [[Fa'afafine]] are biological males who identify as females. The [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]] are biological males who identify as women. They are considered outsiders in their communities and have formed their own language. In the United States, the concept of a third gender is beginning to gain traction. California now allows for drivers licenses to have the gender "non-binary", see [[genderqueer]].

The '''Imaginary''' order is one of a triptych of terms in the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theory of [[Jacques Lacan]], along with the [[The Symbolic|symbolic]] and the [[The Real|real]].  Each of the trio of terms emerged gradually over time, and underwent an evolution during the development of Lacan's thought.  "Of these three terms, the 'imaginary' was the first to appear, well before the Rome Report of 1953 ... [when t]he notion of the 'symbolic' came to the forefront".&lt;ref&gt;Alan Sheridan, "Translator's Note", Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (London 1994) p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, looking back at his intellectual development from the vantage point of the 1970s, Lacan epitomised it as follows: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I began with the Imaginary, I then had to chew on the story of the Symbolic ... and I finished by putting out for you this famous Real.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, Seminar 22, quoted in James M. Mellard, ''Beyond Lacan'' (Albany 2006) p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Accordingly, "Lacan's work is often divided into three periods: the Imaginary (1936–1953), the Symbolic (1953–1963), and the Real (1963–1981)".&lt;ref&gt;D. Hoens and Ed Pluth, in Mellard, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;  During the first of these, "Lacan regarded the 'imago' as the proper study of psychology and identification as the fundamental psychical process.  The imaginary was then the ...  dimension of images, conscious or unconscious, perceived or imagined";&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; and it was in the decade or two following his delivery of ''Le stade du miroir'' at Marienbad in 1936 that Lacan's concept of the Imaginary was most fully articulated.

==The Imaginary order==
The basis of the Imaginary order is the formation of the [[Id, ego, and super-ego|ego]] in the "[[mirror stage]]"; by articulating the ego in this way "the category of the imaginary provides the theoretical basis for a long-standing polemic against ego-psychology"&lt;ref&gt;[[David Macey]], "Introduction", Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (London 1994) p. xxi&lt;/ref&gt; on Lacan's part. Since the ego is formed by identifying with the counterpart or specular image, "[[Identification (psychology)|identification]]" is an important aspect of the imaginary. The relationship whereby the ego is constituted by identification is a locus of "alienation", which is another feature of the imaginary, and is fundamentally [[Narcissism|narcissistic]]: thus Lacan wrote of "the different phases of imaginary, narcissistic, specular identification - the three adjectives are equivalent"&lt;ref&gt;Jacques-Alain Miller ed., ''The Seminar of Jacques Lacan: Book I'' (Cambridge 1988) p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; which make up the ego's history.

If "the Imaginary, the Symbolic and the Real are an unholy trinity whose members could as easily be called Fraud, Absence and Impossibility",&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Bowie, ''Lacan'' (London 1991) p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; then the Imaginary, a realm of surface appearances which are inherently deceptive, is "Fraud".

==The fragmented body==
For Lacan, the driving-force behind the creation of the ego as mirror-image was the prior experience of the phantasy of the fragmented body.  "Lacan was not a Kleinian, though he was the first in France ... to decipher and praise her work",&lt;ref&gt;Jacques-Alain Miller, "Microscopia", in Jacques Lacan, ''Television'' (London 1990) p.xxxi&lt;/ref&gt; but "the threatening and regressive phantasy of 'the body-in-pieces' ... is explicitly related by Lacan to [[Melanie Klein]]'s paranoid position".&lt;ref&gt;David Macey, "Introduction", Lacan, ''Four'' p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt;  Klein's "specific phantasy ... that something inside the person is seeking to pull him apart and render him dead by dismemberment"&lt;ref&gt;Richard Appignanesi ed., ''Introducing Melanie Klein'' (Cambridge 2006) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; fuelled for Lacan "the succession of phantasies that extends from a fragmented body-image ... to the assumption of the armour of an alienating identity"&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; — to the ego as other-identification, as "Fraud".

==The Symbolic==
With the increasing prominence of the Symbolic in Lacan's thought after 1953, the Imaginary becomes viewed in a rather different light, as structured by the [[The Symbolic|symbolic order]]. It is still the case that "the body in pieces finds its unity in the image of the other ... [or] its own specular image" but no longer does "analysis consist in the imaginary realisation of the subject ... to make it well-rounded, this ego, to ... have definitely integrated all its disjointed fragmentary states, its scattered limbs, its pregenital phases, its partial drives".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques-Alain Miller ed., ''The Seminar of Jacques Lacan: Book II'' (Cambridge 1988) p. 54 and p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, "one finds a guide beyond the imaginary, on the level of the symbolic plane".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques-Alain Miller ed., ''The Seminar Of Jacques Lacan: Book I'' (Cambridge 1988) p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

It also became apparent that the imaginary involves a linguistic dimension: whereas the [[Sign (linguistics)|signifier]] is the foundation of the symbolic, the "signified" and "signification" belong to the imaginary. Thus language has both symbolic and imaginary aspects: "words themselves can undergo symbolic lesions and accomplish imaginary acts of which the patient is the subject. ... In this way speech may become an imaginary, or even real object".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits'' p. 87-8&lt;/ref&gt;

To the Lacan of the fifties, "the entire analytic experience unfolds, at the joint of the imaginary and the symbolic",&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Seminar I'' p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; with the latter as the central key to growth: "the goal in analysizing neurotics is to eliminate the interference in symbolic relations created by imaginary relations ... dissipating imaginary identifications".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Fink (psychoanalyst)|Bruce Fink]], ''The Lacanian Subject'' (Princeton 1997) p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;  The Imaginary was the problem, the Symbolic the answer, so that "an entire segment of the analytic experience is nothing other than the exploration of blind alleys of imaginary experience".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Seminar I'' p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus it is "in the disintegration of the imaginary unity constituted by the ego that the subject finds the signifying material of his symptoms",&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Ecrits'' p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; the "identity crisis ... [when] the false-self system disintegrates".&lt;ref&gt;D. Freshwater and C. Robertson, ''Emotions and Needs'' (Buckingham 2002) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the late Lacan==
Just as the early predominance of the Imaginary was eclipsed after the Rome Report, so too by the end of the Sixties the Symbolic in turn  would increasingly come to play second fiddle to the Real, as from "this point on, Lacan downplays the Oedipus complex, seen as a mythical – and so imaginarized – version of unconscious organization".&lt;ref&gt;V. Voruz and B Wolf eds., ''The Later Lacan: An Introduction'' (Albany 2007) p. x&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Lacan could still claim that the "objective of my teaching ... is to dissociate ... what belongs to the imaginary and ... what belongs to the symbolic".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, "Encore", in Juliet Mitchell and Jacqueline Rose, ''Female Sexuality'' (New York 1982) p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Borromean rings|Borromean knots]], he considered he had found a possible topological counterpart to the interconnections of Imaginary, Symbolic, and Real.  "Lacan's seminar was at times now little more than a silent demonstration of the properties of the interlocking knots which illustrated the imbrication of the real, the symbolic and the imaginary".&lt;ref&gt;Macey, ''Four'' p. xxxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

==French culture==&lt;!-- This section is linked from 'Cornelius Castoriadis' and 'Henri Lefebvre'--&gt;
Use of "the adjective [imaginary] as a noun can ... be traced to the works of the novelist [[André Gide]] ... [and] was probably given greater currency by [Sartre's] ''[[The Imaginary (Sartre)|L'Imaginaire]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Macey, ''Four'' p. xxi&lt;/ref&gt;  In Lacan's hands, the Imaginary came close to being an omnivorously colonising interpretive machine: thus [[René Girard]] regretted that "To the Lacanian, whatever I call mimetic must correspond to ... 'capturé par l'imaginaire'".&lt;ref&gt;René Girard, ''To Double Business Bound: Essays on Literature, Mimesis, and Anthropology'' (Baltimore 1988) p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[post-Lacanian]] fissiparous tendencies of his "schools", the term can perhaps return to the general culture, as when the philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]] defines the imaginary "by games of mirroring, of duplication, of reversed identification and [[Psychological projection|projection]], always in the mode of the double",&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze (1972, 172)&lt;/ref&gt; or when [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] defines the imaginary as the capacity humans have to create other forms of individual and social existence.&lt;ref&gt;"''[L]'apparition chez les humains de l'imaginaire aussi bien au niveau de l'être humain singulier (imagination) qu'au niveau social (imaginaire social ou imaginaire instituant)''." (C. Castoriadis, ''La société et vérité dans le monde social-historique. Séminaires 1986-1987. La création humaine I'', Paris, Seuil, 1996, p. 20; as quoted in: Sophie Klimis, Laurent Van Eynde, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ya6xExymbegC&amp;pg= ''L'imaginaire selon Castoriadis: thèmes et enjeux''], Publications Fac St Louis, 2006, p. 70)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20434">'''The Toyota Way''' is a set of principles and behaviors that underlie the [[Toyota]] Motor Corporation's managerial approach and production system. Toyota first summed up its philosophy, values and manufacturing ideals in 2001, calling it "The Toyota Way 2001". It consists of  principles in two key areas: continuous improvement, and respect for people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Toyota Motor |title=Environmental &amp; Social Report 2003 |page=80 |url=http://www.toyota.co.jp/en/environmental_rep/03/pdf/E_p80.pdf |accessdate=26 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toyota Motor Corporation Annual Report, 2003, page 19. "The Toyota Way, which has been passed down since the Companyʼs founding, is a unique set of values and manufacturing ideals. Clearly, our operations are going to become more and more globalized. With this in mind, we compiled a booklet, The Toyota Way 2001, in order to transcend the diverse languages and cultures of our employees and to communicate our philosophy to them." (Mr. Fujio Cho, President, Toyota Motor Corporation)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Toyota Motor |title=Sustainability Report 2009 |page=54 |url=http://www.toyota-global.com/sustainability/sustainability_report/pdf_file_download/09/pdf/sr09_p54_p59.pdf |accessdate=26 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of the principles==
The Toyota Way has been called "a system designed to provide the tools for people to continually improve their work"&lt;ref name = "Exec sum" /&gt; The 14 principles of The Toyota Way are organized in four sections: 
# Long-Term Philosophy
# The Right Process Will Produce the Right Results
# Add Value to the Organization by Developing Your People
# Continuously Solving Root Problems Drives Organizational Learning
The two focal points of the principles are continuous improvement and respect for people. The principles for a continuous improvement include establishing a long-term vision, working on challenges, continual innovation, and going to the source of the issue or problem. The principles relating to respect for people include ways of building respect and teamwork.

==The 14 Principles==
The system can be summarized in 14 principles.&lt;ref name="The Toyota Way"&gt;{{cite book |last=Liker |first=Jeffrey K. |title=The Toyota Way: 14 Management Principles from the World's Greatest Manufacturer |year=2004 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=978-0-07-139231-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The principles are set out and briefly described below:

===Section I — Long-Term Philosophy===
'''Principle 1'''
*''Base your management decisions on a long-term philosophy, even at the expense of short-term financial goals.''
People need purpose to find motivation and establish goals.

===Section II — The Right Process Will Produce the Right Results===
'''Principle 2'''
*''Create a continuous process flow to bring problems to the surface.''

Work processes are redesigned to eliminate waste ([[Muda (Japanese term)|muda]]) through the process of continuous improvement — [[kaizen]]. The seven types of muda are:
#Overproduction
#Waiting (time on hand)
#Unnecessary transport or conveyance
#Overprocessing or incorrect processing
#Excess inventory
#Motion
# Defects

'''Principle 3'''
*''Use "pull" systems to avoid overproduction.''

A method where a process signals its predecessor that more material is needed. The pull system produces only the required material after the subsequent operation signals a need for it. This process is necessary to reduce overproduction.

'''Principle 4'''
*''Level out the workload ([[heijunka]]). (Work like the tortoise, not the hare).''

This helps achieve the goal of minimizing waste ([[Muda (Japanese term)|muda]]), not overburdening people or the equipment ([[Muri (Japanese term)|muri]]), and not creating uneven production levels ([[Mura (Japanese term)|mura]]).

'''Principle 5'''
*''Build a culture of stopping to fix problems, to get quality right the first time.''

Quality takes precedence ([[Jidoka]]). Any employee in the [[Toyota Production System]] has the authority to stop the process to signal a quality issue.

'''Principle 6'''
*''Standardized tasks and processes are the foundation for continuous improvement and employee empowerment.''

Although Toyota has a bureaucratic system, the way that it is implemented allows for continuous improvement (kaizen) from the people affected by that system. It empowers the employee to aid in the growth and improvement of the company.

'''Principle 7'''
*''Use visual control so no problems are hidden.''

Included in this principle is the [[5S (methodology)|5S]] Program - steps that are used to make all work spaces efficient and productive, help people share work stations, reduce time looking for needed tools and improve the work environment.

*Sort: Sort out unneeded items
*Straighten: Have a place for everything
*Shine: Keep the area clean
*Standardize: Create rules and standard operating procedures
*Sustain: Maintain the system and continue to improve it

'''Principle 8'''
*''Use only reliable, thoroughly tested technology that serves your people and processes.''

Technology is '''pulled by''' manufacturing, not '''pushed to''' manufacturing.

===Section III — Add Value to the Organization by Developing Your People===
'''Principle 9'''
*''Grow leaders who thoroughly understand the work, live the philosophy, and teach it to others.''

Without constant attention, the principles will fade. The principles have to be ingrained, it must be the way one thinks. Employees must be educated and trained: they have to maintain a learning organization.

'''Principle 10'''
*''Develop exceptional people and teams who follow your company's philosophy.''

Teams should consist of 4-5 people and numerous management tiers. Success is based on the team, not the individual.

'''Principle 11'''
*''Respect your extended network of partners and suppliers by challenging them and helping them improve.''

Toyota treats suppliers much like they treat their employees, challenging them to do better and helping them to achieve it. Toyota provides cross functional teams to help suppliers discover and fix problems so that they can become a stronger, better supplier.

===Section IV — Continuously Solving Root Problems Drives Organizational Learning===
'''Principle 12'''
*''Go and see for yourself to thoroughly understand the situation ([[Genchi Genbutsu]]).''

Toyota managers are expected to "go-and-see" operations. Without experiencing the situation firsthand, managers will not have an understanding of how it can be improved. Furthermore, managers use Tadashi Yamashima's (President, Toyota Technical Center (TTC)) ten management principles as a guideline:

#Always keep the final target in mind.
#Clearly assign tasks to yourself and others.
#Think and speak on verified, proven information and data.
#Take full advantage of the wisdom and experiences of others to send, gather or discuss information. 
#Share information with others in a timely fashion.
#Always report, inform and consult in a timely manner.
#Analyze and understand shortcomings in your capabilities in a measurable way.
#Relentlessly strive to conduct [[kaizen]] activities.
#Think "outside the box," or beyond common sense and standard rules.
#Always be mindful of protecting your safety and health.

'''Principle 13'''
*''Make decisions slowly by consensus, thoroughly considering all options; implement decisions rapidly ([[nemawashi]]).''

The following are decision parameters:
#Find what is really going on (go-and-see) to test 
#Determine the underlying cause
#Consider a broad range of alternatives
#Build consensus on the resolution
#Use efficient communication tools

'''Principle 14'''
*''Become a learning organization through relentless reflection ([[hansei]]) and continuous improvement ([[kaizen]]).''

The process of becoming a learning organization involves criticizing every aspect of what one does. The general problem solving technique to determine the root cause of a problem includes:
#Initial problem perception
#Clarify the problem
#Locate area/point of cause
#[[Root cause analysis|Investigate root cause]] (5 whys)
#Countermeasure
#Evaluate
#Standardize

==Research findings==
In 2004, Dr. Jeffrey Liker, a [[University of Michigan]] professor of [[industrial engineering]], published ''The Toyota Way''. In his book Liker calls the Toyota Way "a system designed to provide the tools for people to continually improve their work."&lt;ref name = "Exec sum"&gt;{{cite web|last=Liker |first= Jeffrey |year=2004 |url=http://ICOS.groups.si.umich.edu//Liker04.pdf |title=The 14 Principles of the Toyota Way: An Executive Summary of the Culture Behind TPS|page=36 |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=26 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to Liker, the 14 principles of The Toyota Way are organized in four sections: (1) long-term philosophy, (2) the right process will produce the right results, (3) add value to the organization by developing your people, and (4) continuously solving root problems drives organizational learning.

===Long-term philosophy===
The first principle involves managing with a long-view rather than for short-term gain. It reflects a belief that people need purpose to find motivation and establish goals.

===Right process will produce right results===
The next seven principles are focused on process with an eye towards quality outcome. Following these principles, work processes are redesigned to eliminate waste ([[Muda (Japanese term)|muda]]) through the process of continuous improvement — [[kaizen]]. The seven types of muda are (1) overproduction; (2) waiting, time on hand; (3) unnecessary transport or conveyance; (4) overprocessing or incorrect processing; (5) excess inventory; (6) motion; and (7) defects.

The principles in this section empower employees in spite of the bureaucratic processes of Toyota, as any employee in the [[Toyota Production System]] has the authority to stop production to signal a quality issue, emphasizing that quality takes precedence ([[Jidoka]]). The way the Toyota bureaucratic system is implemented to allow for continuous improvement (kaizen) from the people affected by that system so that any employee may aid in the growth and improvement of the company.

Recognition of the value of employees is also part of the principle of measured production rate ([[heijunka]]), as a level workload helps avoid overburdening people and equipment ([[Muri (Japanese term)|muri]]), but this is also intended to minimize waste (muda) and avoid uneven production levels ([[Mura (Japanese term)|mura]]).

These principles are also designed to ensure that only essential materials are employed (to avoid overproduction), that the work environment is maintained efficiently (the [[5S (methodology)|5S]] Program) to help people share work stations and to reduce time looking for needed tools, and that the technology used is reliable and thoroughly tested.

===Value to organization by developing people===
Human development is the focus of principles 9 through 11. Principle 9 emphasizes the need to ensure that leaders embrace and promote the corporate philosophy. This reflects, according to Liker, a belief that the principles have to be ingrained in employees to survive. The 10th principle emphasizes the need of individuals and work teams to embrace the company's philosophy, with teams of 4-5 people who are judged in success by their team achievements, rather than their individual efforts. Principle 11 looks to business partners, who are treated by Toyota much like they treat their employees. Toyota challenges them to do better and helps them to achieve it, providing cross functional teams to help suppliers discover and fix problems so that they can become a stronger, better supplier.

===Solving root problems drives organizational learning===
The final principles embrace a philosophy of problem solving that emphasizes thorough understanding, [[consensus]]-based solutions swiftly implemented and continual reflection ([[hansei]]) and improvement ([[kaizen]]). The 12th principle ([[Genchi Genbutsu]]) sets out the expectation that managers will personally evaluate operations so that they have a firsthand understanding of situations and problems. Principle 13 encourages thorough consideration of possible solutions through a consensus process, with rapid implementation of decisions once reached ([[nemawashi]]). The final principle requires that Toyota be a "learning organization", continually reflecting on its practices and striving for improvement. According to Liker, the process of becoming a learning organization involves criticizing every aspect of what one does.

==Translating the principles==
There is a question of [[Diffusion (business)|uptake]] of the principles now that Toyota has production operations in many different countries around the world. As a ''New York Times'' article notes, while the corporate culture may have been easily disseminated by word of mouth when Toyota manufacturing was only in Japan, with worldwide production, many different [[culture]]s must be taken into account. Concepts such as "mutual ownership of problems", or ''"[[Genchi Genbutsu|genchi genbutsu]]"'', (solving problems at the source instead of behind desks), and the ''"[[kaizen]] mind"'', (an unending sense of crisis behind the company’s constant drive to improve), may be unfamiliar to North Americans and people of other cultures. A recent increase in vehicle recalls may be due, in part, to "a failure by Toyota to spread its obsession for craftsmanship among its growing ranks of overseas factory workers and managers." Toyota is attempting to address these needs by establishing training institutes in the United States and in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fackler |first=Martin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/15/business/worldbusiness/15toyota.html?pagewanted=all |title=The 'Toyota Way' Is Translated for a New Generation of Foreign Managers |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 15, 2007 |accessdate=26 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Results ==
Toyota Way has been driven so deeply into the psyche of employees at all levels that it has morphed from a strategy into an important element of the company's culture.&lt;ref name="Heskett"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LCDoh6-opEkC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=%22Toyota+way%22+so+shocking+that+it+may+have+led+to+some+amount+of+denial+as+well+as+loyal+customers |page=130 |title=The culture cycle : how to shape the unseen force that transforms performance |first=James L |last=Heskett |publisher= FT Press |year=2012 |isbn=9780132779784 |accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Masaki Saruta, author of several books on Toyota, "the real Toyota Way is a culture of control."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-03-24/news/sc-biz-0325-toyota-man-20100324_1_toyota-motor-corp-toyota-officials-paul-nolasco |title=Toyota’s rigid culture criticized in light of recalls - Automaker’s Toyota Way handbook dictates details of employees’ lives, even in their off time |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=24 March 2010|first=John M. |last=Glionna |accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rAlcjg0QhGkC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=Masaki+Saruta+Toyota+Way |page=65 |title=Inside the mind of Toyota : management principles for enduring growth |first=Satoshi |last=Hino |publisher=Productivity Press |year=2006 |accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Toyota Way rewards intense company loyalty that at the same time invariably reduces the voice of those who challenge authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.toyota-global.com/sustainability/csr_initiatives/stakeholders/employees/index3.html |title=Relations with Employees |publisher=Toyota Motors |accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toyota.dk/Images/ToyotaCodeOfConduct_tcm200-635681.pdf |title=Toyota Code of Conduct |publisher=Toyota Motor Europe |date=October 2006 |accessdate=29 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914012629/http://www.toyota.dk/Images/ToyotaCodeOfConduct_tcm200-635681.pdf |archivedate=14 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Toyota Way of constructive criticism to reach a better way of doing things 'is not always received in good spirit at home.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nrYWDniU9X8C&amp;pg=PA130&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;dq=Atkins+noted+wryly+that+the+Toyota+Way+of+constructive+criticism+to+reach+a+better+way+of+doing+things+“is+not+always+received+in+good+spirit+at+home%22

{{Refimprove|date=June 2010}}
'''Troubleshooting''' or  '''dépanneuring''' is a form of [[problem solving]], often applied to repair failed products or processes on a machine or a system.  It is a logical, systematic search for the source of a problem in order to solve it, and make the product or process operational again.  Troubleshooting is needed to identify the symptoms.  Determining the most likely cause is a [[process of elimination]]—eliminating potential causes of a problem.  Finally, troubleshooting requires confirmation that the solution restores the product or process to its working state.

In general, troubleshooting is the identification or [[diagnosis]] of "trouble" in the management flow of a corporation or a system caused by a failure of some kind.  The problem is initially described as symptoms of malfunction, and troubleshooting is the process of determining and remedying the causes of these symptoms.

A system can be described in terms of its expected, desired or intended behavior (usually, for artificial systems, its purpose).  Events or inputs to the system are expected to generate specific results or outputs.  (For example, selecting the "print" option from various computer applications is intended to result in a [[hardcopy]] emerging from some specific device). Any unexpected or undesirable behavior is a symptom.  Troubleshooting is the process of isolating the specific cause or causes of the symptom.  Frequently the symptom is a failure of the product or process to produce any results. (Nothing was printed, for example). Corrective action can then be taken to prevent further failures of a similar kind.

The methods of [[forensic engineering]] are useful in tracing problems in products or processes, and a wide range of analytical techniques are available to determine the cause or causes of specific [[failure]]s. Corrective action can then be taken to prevent further failure of a similar kind. Preventative action is possible using [[Failure mode and effects analysis|failure mode and effects (FMEA)]] and [[Fault tree analysis|fault tree analysis (FTA)]] before full-scale production, and these methods can also be used for [[failure analysis]].

== Aspects ==


Usually troubleshooting is applied to something that has suddenly stopped working, since its previously working state forms the expectations about its continued behavior. So the initial focus is often on recent changes to the system or to the environment in which it exists. (For example, a printer that "was working when it was plugged in over there"). However, there is a well known principle that [[correlation]] does not imply [[causality]]. (For example, the failure of a device shortly after it has been plugged into a different outlet doesn't necessarily mean that the events were related.  The failure could have been a matter of [[coincidence]].) Therefore, troubleshooting demands [[critical thinking]] rather than [[magical thinking]].

It is useful to consider the common experiences we have with light bulbs.  Light bulbs "burn out" more or less at random; eventually the repeated heating and cooling of its [[Electrical filament|filament]], and fluctuations in the power supplied to it cause the filament to crack or vaporize.  The same principle applies to most other electronic devices and similar principles apply to mechanical devices.  Some failures are part of the normal wear-and-tear of components in a system.

A basic principle in troubleshooting is to start from the simplest and most [[probability|probable]] possible problems first.  This is illustrated by the old saying "When you see hoof prints, look for horses, not zebras", or to use another [[maxim (saying)|maxim]], use the [[KISS principle]].  This principle results in the common complaint about [[help desk]]s or manuals, that they sometimes first ask:  "Is it plugged in and does that receptacle have power?", but this should not be taken as an affront, rather it should serve as a reminder or [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]] to always check the simple things first before calling for help.

A troubleshooter could check each component in a [[system]] one by one, substituting known good components for each potentially suspect one.  However, this process of "serial substitution" can be considered degenerate when components are substituted without regard to a hypothesis concerning how their failure could result in the symptoms being diagnosed.

Simple and intermediate systems are characterized by lists or trees of dependencies among their components or subsystems.  More complex systems contain cyclical dependencies or interactions ([[feedback loop]]s).  Such systems are less amenable to "bisection" troubleshooting techniques.

It also helps to start from a known good state, the best example being a computer [[hard reboot|reboot]].  A [[cognitive walkthrough]] is also a good thing to try.  Comprehensive [[documentation]] produced by proficient [[technical writer]]s is very helpful, especially if it provides a [[theory of operation]] for the subject device or system.

A common cause of problems is bad [[design]], for example bad [[human factors]] design, where a device could be inserted backward or upside down due to the lack of an appropriate forcing function ([[behavior-shaping constraint]]), or a lack of [[error-tolerant]] design.  This is especially bad if accompanied by [[habituation]], where the user just doesn't notice the incorrect usage, for instance if two parts have different functions but share a common case so that it is not apparent on a casual inspection which part is being used.

Troubleshooting can also take the form of a systematic [[checklist]], troubleshooting [[Procedure (term)|procedure]], [[flowchart]] or table that is made before a problem occurs. Developing troubleshooting procedures in advance allows sufficient thought about the steps to take in troubleshooting and organizing the troubleshooting into the most efficient troubleshooting process. Troubleshooting tables can be computerized to make them more efficient for users.

Some computerized troubleshooting services (such as Primefax, later renamed Maxserve), immediately show the top 10 solutions with the highest probability of fixing the underlying problem. The technician can either answer additional questions to advance through the troubleshooting procedure, each step narrowing the list of solutions, or immediately implement the solution he feels will fix the problem. These services give a rebate if the technician takes an additional step after the problem is solved: report back the solution that actually fixed the problem. The computer uses these reports to update its estimates of which solutions have the highest probability of fixing that particular set of symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;"Troubleshooting at your fingertips" by Nils Conrad Persson. "Electronics Servicing and Technology" magazine 1982 June.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Half-splitting ==

Efficient methodical troubleshooting starts on with a clear understanding of the expected behavior of the system and the symptoms being observed.  From there the troubleshooter forms hypotheses on potential causes, and devises (or perhaps references a standardized checklist of) tests to eliminate these prospective causes.  This approach is often called "[[divide and conquer algorithm|divide and conquer]]".

Two common strategies used by troubleshooters are to check for frequently encountered or easily tested conditions first (for example, checking to ensure that a printer's light is on and that its cable is firmly seated at both ends). This is often referred to as "milking the front panel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hewlett Packard Bench Briefs|url=http://www.hparchive.com/Bench_Briefs/HP-Bench-Briefs-1982-01-02.pdf|publisher=Hewlett Packard|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, "bisect" the system (for example in a network
printing system, checking to see if the job reached the server to determine whether a problem exists in the subsystems "towards" the user's end or "towards" the device).

This latter technique can be particularly efficient in systems with long chains of serialized dependencies or interactions among its components.  It is simply the application of a [[binary search]] across the range of dependencies and is often referred to as "half-splitting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sullivan|first=Mike|title=Secrets of a super geek: Use half splitting to solve difficult problems|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/secrets-of-a-super-geek-use-half-splitting-to-solve-difficult-problems/|accessdate=22 October 2010|newspaper=TechRepublic|date=Nov 15, 2000|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120708042145/http://www.techrepublic.com/article/secrets-of-a-super-geek-use-half-splitting-to-solve-difficult-problems/5029507|archivedate=8 July 2012|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reproducing symptoms ==
One of the core principles of troubleshooting is that reproducible problems can be reliably isolated and resolved.  Often considerable effort and emphasis in troubleshooting is placed on reproducibility ... on finding a procedure to reliably induce the symptom to occur.

== Intermittent symptoms ==
Some of the most difficult troubleshooting issues relate to [[Intermittent fault|symptoms which occur intermittently]].  In electronics this often is the result of components that are thermally sensitive (since resistance of a circuit varies with the temperature of the conductors in it).  Compressed air can be used to cool specific spots on a circuit board and a heat gun can be used to raise the temperatures; thus troubleshooting of electronics systems frequently entails applying these tools in order to reproduce a problem.

In computer programming [[race condition]]s often lead to intermittent symptoms which are extremely difficult to reproduce; various techniques can be used to force the particular function or module to be called more rapidly than it would be in normal operation (analogous to "heating up" a component in a hardware circuit) while other techniques can be used to introduce greater delays in, or force synchronization among, other modules or interacting processes.

Intermittent issues can be thus defined:

{{quote|An intermittent is a problem for which there is no known procedure to consistently reproduce its symptom.|Steven Litt|[http://www.troubleshooters.com/tpromag/9812.htm#DefinitionofanIntermittent]}}

In particular he asserts that there is a distinction between frequency of occurrence and a "known procedure to consistently reproduce" an issue.  For example, knowing that an intermittent problem occurs '''"within"''' an hour of a particular stimulus or event ... but that sometimes it happens in five minutes and other times it takes almost an hour ... does not constitute a "known procedure" even if the stimulus does increase the frequency of observable exhibitions of the symptom.

Nevertheless, sometimes troubleshooters must resort to statistical methods ... and can only find procedures to increase the symptom's occurrence to a point at which serial substitution or some other technique is feasible.  In such cases, even when the symptom seems to disappear for significantly longer periods, there is a low confidence that the [[root cause]] has been found and that the problem is truly solved.

Also, tests may be run to stress certain components to determine if those components have failed.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~joyoung/trouble/page1.shtml|title=How to Troubleshoot a Computer Problem – joyojc.com|author=|date=|website=www.ocf.berkeley.edu|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Multiple problems ==
Isolating single component failures which cause reproducible symptoms is relatively straightforward.

However, many problems only occur as a result of multiple failures or errors.  This is particularly true of [[fault tolerant]] systems, or those with built-in redundancy.  Features which add redundancy, fault detection and [[failover]] to a system may also be subject to failure, and enough different component failures in any system will "take it down."

Even in simple systems the troubleshooter must always consider the possibility that there is more than one fault.  (Replacing each component, using serial substitution, and then swapping each new component back out for the old one when the symptom is found to persist, can fail to resolve such cases.  More importantly the replacement of any component with a defective one can actually increase the number of problems rather than eliminating them).

Note that, while we talk about "replacing components" the resolution of many problems involves adjustments or tuning rather than "replacement." For example, intermittent  breaks in conductors --- or "dirty or loose contacts" might simply need to be cleaned and/or tightened.   All discussion of "replacement" should be taken to mean "replacement or adjustment or other maintenance."

{{Type systems}}
In [[programming language]]s, a '''type system''' is a set of rules that assigns a property called [[type (computer science)|type]] to the various constructs of a [[computer program]], such as [[variable (computer science)|variables]], [[expression (computer science)|expressions]], [[function (computer science)|functions]] or [[modular programming|modules]].{{sfn|Pierce|2002|p=1|ps=: "A type system is a tractable syntactic method for proving the absence of certain program behaviors by classifying phrases according to the kinds of values they compute."}}  These types formalize and enforce the otherwise implicit categories the programmer uses for [[algebraic data type]]s, data structures, or other components (e.g. "string", "array of float", "function returning boolean"). The main purpose of a type system is to reduce possibilities for [[bug (computer programming)|bugs]] in computer programs{{sfn|Cardelli|2004|p=1|ps=: "The fundamental purpose of a type system is to prevent the occurrence of execution errors during the running of a program."}} by defining interfaces between different parts of a computer program, and then checking that the parts have been connected in a consistent way. This checking can happen statically (at [[compile time]]), dynamically (at [[run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]]), or as a combination of static and dynamic checking. Type systems have other purposes as well, such as expressing business rules, enabling certain compiler optimizations, allowing for [[multiple dispatch]], providing a form of documentation, etc.

A type system associates a type with each computed value and, by examining the flow of these values, attempts to ensure or prove that no [[type error]]s can occur. The given type system in question determines exactly what constitutes a type error, but in general the aim is to prevent operations expecting a certain kind of value from being used with values for which that operation does not make sense ([[logic error]]s). Type systems are often specified as part of [[programming language]]s, and built into the interpreters and compilers for them; although the type system of a language can be extended by [[extended static checking|optional tools]] that perform added kinds of checks using the language's original type syntax and grammar.

== Usage overview ==
An example of a simple type system is that of the [[C (programming language)|C language]]. The portions of a C program are the [[Subroutine|function]] definitions.  One function is invoked by another function.  The interface of a function states the name of the function and a list of values that are passed to the function's code.  The code of an invoking function states the name of the invoked, along with the names of variables that hold values to pass to it.  During execution, the values are placed into temporary storage, then execution jumps to the code of the invoked function.  The invoked function's code accesses the values and makes use of them.  If the instructions inside the function are written with the assumption of receiving an integer value, but the calling code passed a floating-point value, then the wrong result will be computed by the invoked function.  The C compiler checks the type declared for each variable sent, against the type declared for each variable in the interface of the invoked function.  If the types do not match, the compiler throws a compile-time error.

A [[compiler]] may also use the static type of a value to optimize the storage it needs and the choice of algorithms for operations on the value. In many [[C (programming language)|C]] compilers the ''float'' [[data type]], for example, is represented in 32 [[bit]]s, in accord with the [[IEEE 754-2008|IEEE specification for single-precision floating point numbers]]. They will thus use floating-point-specific [[instruction set|microprocessor operations]] on those values (floating-point addition, multiplication, etc.).

The depth of type constraints and the manner of their evaluation affect the ''typing'' of the language. A [[programming language]] may further associate an operation with various resolutions for each type, in the case of [[type polymorphism]]. [[Type theory]] is the study of type systems. The concrete types of some programming languages, such as integers and strings, depend on practical issues of computer architecture, compiler implementation, and language design.

== Fundamentals ==
Formally, [[type theory]] studies type systems. A programming language must have occurrence to type check using the ''type system'' whether at compile time or runtime, manually annotated or automatically inferred.  As [[Mark Manasse]] concisely put it:{{sfn|Pierce|2002|p=208}}
{{quote|The fundamental problem addressed by a type theory is to ensure that programs have meaning. The fundamental problem caused by a type theory is that meaningful programs may not have meanings ascribed to them. The quest for richer type systems results from this tension.}}

Assigning a data type, termed ''typing'', gives meaning to a sequence of [[bit]]s such as a value in [[computer memory|memory]] or some [[object (computer science)|object]] such as a [[variable (computer science)|variable]]. The hardware of a [[general purpose computer]] is unable to discriminate between for example a [[memory address]] and an [[instruction code (programming)|instruction code]], or between a [[character (computing)|character]], an [[integer]], or a [[floating-point number]], because it makes no intrinsic distinction between any of the possible values that a sequence of bits might ''mean''.&lt;ref group=note name=Burroughs/&gt; Associating a sequence of bits with a type conveys that [[wikt:meaning|meaning]] to the programmable hardware to form a ''[[symbolic system]]'' composed of that hardware and some program.

A program associates each value with at least one specific type, but it also can occur that one value is associated with many [[subtype]]s.  Other entities, such as [[object (computer science)|objects]], [[module (programming)|modules]], communication channels, and [[dependency (computer science)|dependencies]] can become associated with a type.  Even a type can become associated with a type.  An implementation of a ''type system'' could in theory associate identifications called ''[[data type]]'' (a type of a value), ''[[class (computer science)|class]]'' (a type of an object), and ''[[kind (type theory)|kind]]'' (a ''type of a type'', or metatype). These are the abstractions that typing can go through, on a hierarchy of levels contained in a system.

When a programming language evolves a more elaborate type system, it gains a more finely grained rule set than basic type checking, but this comes at a price when the type inferences (and other properties) become [[undecidable problem|undecidable]], and when more attention must be paid by the programmer to annotate code or to consider computer-related operations and functioning. It is challenging to find a sufficiently expressive type system that satisfies all programming practices in a [[type safe]] manner.

The more type restrictions that are imposed by the compiler, the more ''strongly typed'' a programming language is.  Strongly typed languages often require the programmer to make explicit conversions in contexts where an implicit conversion would cause no harm.  Pascal's type system has been described as "too strong" because, for example, the size of an array or string is part of its type, making some programming tasks difficult.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7i8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66 Infoworld 25 April 1983]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~cs655/readings/bwk-on-pascal.html |title=[[Brian Kernighan |access-date=2011-10-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406094058/http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~cs655/readings/bwk-on-pascal.html |archive-date=2012-04-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] is also strongly typed but its types are automatically inferred so that explicit conversions are often (but not always) unnecessary.

A programming language compiler can also implement a ''[[dependent type]]'' or an ''[[effect system]]'', which enables even more program specifications to be verified by a type checker. Beyond simple value-type pairs, a virtual "region" of code is associated with an "effect" component describing ''what'' is being done ''with what'', and enabling for example to "throw" an error report.  Thus the symbolic system may be a ''type and effect system'', which endows it with more safety checking than type checking alone.

&lt;!--===Advantages sustain===--&gt;
Whether automated by the compiler or specified by a programmer, a type system makes program behavior illegal if outside the type-system rules. Advantages provided by programmer-specified type systems include:
* ''Abstraction'' (or ''modularity'') – Types enable programmers to think at a higher level than the bit or byte, not bothering with low-level implementation. For example, programmers can begin to think of a string as a set of character values instead of as a mere array of bytes. Higher still, types enable programmers to think about and express [[interface (computer science)|interface]]s between two of ''any''-sized subsystems. This enables more levels of localization so that the definitions required for interoperability of the subsystems remain consistent when those two subsystems communicate.
* ''Documentation'' – In more expressive type systems, types can serve as a form of [[documentation]] clarifying the intent of the programmer. For example, if a programmer declares a function as returning a timestamp type, this documents the function when the timestamp type can be explicitly declared deeper in the code to be an integer type.

Advantages provided by compiler-specified type systems include:
* ''Optimization'' – Static type-checking may provide useful compile-time information. For example, if a type requires that a value must align in memory at a multiple of four bytes, the compiler may be able to use more efficient machine instructions.
* ''Safety'' – A type system enables the [[compiler]] to detect meaningless or probably invalid code. For example, we can identify an expression &lt;code&gt;3 / "Hello, World"&lt;/code&gt; as invalid, when the rules do not specify how to divide an [[integer]] by a [[string (computer science)|string]]. Strong typing offers more safety, but cannot guarantee complete ''[[type safety]]''.

===Type errors===
A type error is an unintended condition which might manifest in multiple stages of a program's development. Thus a facility for detection of the error is needed in the type system. In some languages, such as Haskell, for which [[type inference]] is automated, [[lint (software)|lint]] might be available to its compiler to aid in the detection of error.

Type safety contributes to [[program correctness]], but might only guarantee correctness at the cost of making the type checking itself an [[undecidable problem]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}  In a ''type system'' with automated type checking a program may prove to run incorrectly yet be safely typed, and produce no compiler errors. [[Division by zero]] is an unsafe and incorrect operation, but a type checker running at [[compile time]] only does not scan for division by zero in most languages, and then it is left as a [[runtime error]]. To prove the absence of these more-general-than-types defects, other kinds of [[formal method]]s, collectively known as [[program analysis (computer science)|program analyses]], are in common use. Alternatively, a sufficiently expressive type system, such as in dependently typed languages, can prevent these kinds of errors (for example, expressing ''the type of non-zero numbers'').  In addition [[software testing]] is an [[empirical]] method for finding errors that the type checker cannot detect.

== Type checking ==
The process of verifying and enforcing the constraints of types—''type checking''—may occur either at [[compile-time]] (a static check) or at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]]. If a language specification requires its typing rules strongly (i.e., more or less allowing only those automatic type conversions that do not lose information), one can refer to the process as ''strongly typed'', if not, as ''weakly typed''. The terms are not usually used in a strict sense.

{{Anchor|STATIC|Static typing}}

=== Static type checking ===
Static type checking is the process of verifying the [[type safety]] of a program based on analysis of a program's text (source code). If a program passes a static type checker, then the program is guaranteed to satisfy some set of type safety properties for all possible inputs.

Static type checking can be considered a limited form of [[program verification]] (see [[type safety]]), and in a type-safe language, can be considered also an optimization. If a compiler can prove that a program is well-typed, then it does not need to emit dynamic safety checks, allowing the resulting compiled binary to run faster and to be smaller.

Static type checking for Turing-complete languages is inherently conservative. That is, if a type system is both ''sound'' (meaning that it rejects all incorrect programs) and ''decidable'' (meaning that it is possible to write an algorithm that determines whether a program is well-typed), then it must be ''incomplete'' (meaning there are correct programs, which are also rejected, even though they do not encounter runtime errors).&lt;ref&gt;"... any
sound, decidable type system must be incomplete" —D. Remy (2017). p. 29, {{cite web|last=Remy|first=Didier|title=Type systems for programming languages|url=http://gallium.inria.fr/~remy/mpri/cours1.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider a program containing the code:

&lt;code&gt;if &lt;complex test&gt; then &lt;do something&gt; else &lt;signal that there is a type error&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Even if the expression &lt;code&gt;&lt;complex test&gt;&lt;/code&gt; always evaluates to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; at run-time, most type checkers will reject the program as ill-typed, because it is difficult (if not impossible) for a static analyzer to determine that the &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; branch will not be taken.{{sfn|Pierce|2002}} Conversely, a static type checker will quickly detect type errors in rarely used code paths. Without static type checking, even [[code coverage]] tests with 100% coverage may be unable to find such type errors. The tests may fail to detect such type errors, because the combination of all places where values are created and all places where a certain value is used must be taken into account.

A number of useful and common programming language features cannot be checked statically, such as [[downcasting]]. Thus, many languages will have both static and dynamic type checking; the static type checker verifies what it can, and dynamic checks verify the rest.

Many languages with static type checking provide a way to bypass the type checker. Some languages allow programmers to choose between static and dynamic type safety. For example, [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] distinguishes between ''statically-typed'' and ''dynamically-typed'' variables. Uses of the former are checked statically, whereas uses of the latter are checked dynamically. Other languages allow writing code that is not type-safe; for example, in [[C (programming language)|C]], programmers can freely cast a value between any two types that have the same size, effectively subverting the type concept.

For a list of languages with static type checking, see [[:Category:Statically typed programming languages|the category for statically typed languages]].

{{Anchor|DYNAMIC}}

=== Dynamic type checking and runtime type information ===
{{see also|Dynamic programming language|Interpreted language}}
Dynamic type checking is the process of verifying the type safety of a program at runtime. Implementations of dynamically type-checked languages generally associate each runtime object with a ''type tag'' (i.e., a reference to a type) containing its type information. This runtime type information (RTTI) can also be used to implement [[dynamic dispatch]], [[late binding]], [[downcasting]], [[Reflection (computer programming)|reflection]], and similar features.

Most type-safe languages include some form of dynamic type checking, even if they also have a static type checker.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The reason for this is that many useful features or properties are difficult or impossible to verify statically. For example, suppose that a program defines two types, A and B, where B is a subtype of A. If the program tries to convert a value of type A to type B, which is known as [[downcasting]], then the operation is legal only if the value being converted is actually a value of type B. Thus, a dynamic check is needed to verify that the operation is safe. This requirement is one of the criticisms of downcasting.

By definition, dynamic type checking may cause a program to fail at runtime. In some programming languages, it is possible to anticipate and recover from these failures. In others, type-checking errors are considered fatal.

Programming languages that include dynamic type checking but not static type checking are often called "dynamically typed programming languages". For a list of such languages, see [[:Category:Dynamically typed programming languages|the category for dynamically typed programming languages]].

{{Anchor|COMBINED}}

===Combining static and dynamic type checking ===
Some languages allow both static and dynamic typing (type checking), sometimes called ''soft'' typing. For example, Java and some other ostensibly statically typed languages support [[downcasting]] types to their [[subtypes]], querying an object to discover its dynamic type, and other type operations that depend on runtime type information. More generally, most programming languages include mechanisms for dispatching over different 'kinds' of data, such as [[disjoint union]]s, [[polymorphism in object-oriented programming|subtype polymorphism]], and [[variant type]]s. Even when not interacting with type annotations or type checking, such mechanisms are materially similar to dynamic typing implementations. See [[programming language]] for more discussion of the interactions between static and dynamic typing.

Objects in object-oriented languages are usually accessed by a reference whose static target type (or manifest type) is equal to either the object's run-time type (its latent type) or a supertype thereof. This is conformant with the [[Liskov substitution principle]], which states that all operations performed on an instance of a given type can also be performed on an instance of a subtype. This concept is also known as subsumption. In some languages subtypes may also possess [[Covariance and contravariance (computer science)|covariant or contravariant]] return types and argument types respectively.

Certain languages, for example [[Clojure]], [[Common Lisp]], or [[Cython]] are dynamically type-checked by default, but allow programs to opt into static type checking by providing optional annotations. One reason to use such hints would be to optimize the performance of critical sections of a program. This is formalized by [[#Gradual typing|gradual typing]]. The programming environment ''[[DrRacket]]'', a  pedagogic environment based on Lisp, and a precursor of the language [[Racket (programming language)#Development|Racket]] was also soft-typed.

Conversely, as of version 4.0, the C# language provides a way to indicate that a variable should not be statically type-checked. A variable whose type is &lt;code&gt;dynamic&lt;/code&gt; will not be subject to static type checking. Instead, the program relies on runtime type information to determine how the variable may be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd264741.aspx|title=dynamic (C# Reference)|work=[[MSDN Library]]|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Static and dynamic type checking in practice ===
The choice between static and dynamic typing requires certain [[trade-off]]s.

Static typing can find type errors reliably at compile time, which should increase the reliability of the delivered program. However, programmers disagree over how commonly type errors occur, resulting in further disagreements over the proportion of those bugs that are coded that would be caught by appropriately representing the designed types in code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Advocates of [[dependent type|dependent typing]],{{who|date=July 2017}} implemented in languages such as [[Dependent ML]] and [[Epigram (programming language)|Epigram]], have suggested that almost all bugs can be considered type errors, if the types used in a program are properly declared by the programmer or correctly inferred by the compiler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Static typing usually results in compiled code that executes faster. When the compiler knows the exact data types that are in use (which is necessary for static verification, either through declaration or inference) it can produce optimized machine code. Some dynamically typed languages such as [[Common Lisp]] allow optional type declarations for optimization for this reason.

By contrast, dynamic typing may allow compilers to run faster and [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreters]] to dynamically load new code, because changes to source code in dynamically typed languages may result in less checking to perform and less code to revisit.{{clarify|date=November 2015}} This too may reduce the edit-compile-test-debug cycle.

Statically typed languages that lack [[type inference]] (such as [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] prior to [[Java version history#Java SE 10|version 10]]) require that programmers declare the types that a method or function must use. This can serve as added program documentation, that is active and dynamic, instead of static. This allows a compiler to prevent it from drifting out of synchrony, and from being ignored by programmers. However, a language can be statically typed without requiring type declarations (examples include [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], [[OCaml]], [[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]], and to a lesser extent [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and [[C++]]), so explicit type declaration is not a necessary requirement for static typing in all languages.

Dynamic typing allows constructs that some static type checking would reject as illegal. For example, ''[[eval]]'' functions, which execute arbitrary data as code, become possible. An ''eval'' function is possible with static typing, but requires advanced uses of [[GADT|algebraic data types]]. Further, dynamic typing better accommodates transitional code and prototyping, such as allowing a placeholder data structure ([[mock object]]) to be transparently used in place of a full data structure (usually for the purposes of experimentation and testing).

Dynamic typing typically allows [[duck typing]] (which enables [[duck typing#Comparison with other type systems|easier code reuse]]). Many{{specify|date=July 2017}} languages with static typing also feature [[duck typing#In statically typed languages|duck typing]] or other mechanisms like [[generic programming]] that also enable easier code reuse.

Dynamic typing typically makes [[metaprogramming]] easier to use. For example, [[C++]] [[template (programming)|templates]] are typically more cumbersome to write than the equivalent [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] or [[Python (programming language)|Python]] code since [[C++]] has stronger rules regarding type definitions (for both functions and variables). This forces a developer to write more [[boilerplate code]] for a template than a Python developer would need to. More advanced run-time constructs such as [[metaclass]]es and [[introspection (computer science)|introspection]] are often harder to use in statically typed languages. In some languages, such features may also be used e.g. to generate new types and behaviors on the fly, based on run-time data. Such advanced constructs are often provided by [[dynamic programming language]]s; many of these are dynamically typed, although ''dynamic typing'' need not be related to ''dynamic programming languages''.

=== Strong and weak type systems ===
{{Main|Strong and weak typing}}

Languages are often colloquially referred to as ''strongly typed'' or ''weakly typed''. In fact, there is no universally accepted definition of what these terms mean. In general, there are more precise terms to represent the differences between type systems that lead people to call them "strong" or "weak".

=== Type safety and memory safety ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Java (programming language)]] --&gt;
{{Main|Type safety}}

A third way of categorizing the type system of a programming language uses the safety of typed operations and conversions. Computer scientists consider a language "type-safe" if it does not allow operations or conversions that violate the rules of the type system.

Some observers use the term ''memory-safe language'' (or just ''safe language'') to describe languages that do not allow programs to access memory that has not been assigned for their use. For example, a memory-safe language will [[bounds checking|check array bounds]], or else statically guarantee (i.e., at compile time before execution) that array accesses out of the array boundaries will cause compile-time and perhaps runtime errors.

Consider the following program of a language that is both type-safe and memory-safe:&lt;ref&gt;[[Visual Basic]] is an example of a language that is both type-safe and memory-safe.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=text line&gt;
var x := 5;     
var y := "37";  
var z := x + y; 
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example, the variable {{code|z}} will have the value 42. Although this may not be what the programmer anticipated, it is a well-defined result. If {{code|y}} were a different string, one that could not be converted to a number (e.g. "Hello World"), the result would be well-defined as well. Note that a program can be type-safe or memory-safe and still crash on an invalid operation; in fact, if a program encounters an operation that is not type-safe, terminating the program is often the only option.

Now consider a similar example in C:

&lt;source lang=C line&gt;
int x = 5;
char y[] = "37";
char* z = x + y;
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example {{C-lang|z}} will point to a memory address five characters beyond {{C-lang|y}}, equivalent to three characters after the terminating zero character of the string pointed to by {{C-lang|y}}. This is memory that the program is not expected to access. It may contain garbage data, and it certainly doesn't contain anything useful. As this example shows, C is neither a memory-safe nor a type-safe language.

In general, type-safety and memory-safety go hand in hand. For example, a language that supports pointer arithmetic and number-to-pointer conversions (like C) is neither memory-safe nor type-safe, because it allows arbitrary memory to be accessed as if it were valid memory of any type.

For more information, see [[memory safety]].

=== Variable levels of type checking ===
Some languages allow different levels of checking to apply to different regions of code. Examples include:
* The &lt;code&gt;use strict&lt;/code&gt; directive in [[JavaScript]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm Standard ECMA-262]. Ecma-international.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/Strict_mode Strict mode - JavaScript | MDN]. Developer.mozilla.org (2013-07-03). Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/br230269(v=vs.94).aspx Strict Mode (JavaScript)]. Msdn.microsoft.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Perl]] applies stronger checking.
* The &lt;code&gt;declare(strict_types=1)&lt;/code&gt; in [[PHP]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php#functions.arguments.type-declaration.strict Strict typing]&lt;/ref&gt; on a per-file basis allows only a variable of exact type of the type declaration will be accepted, or a &lt;code&gt;TypeError&lt;/code&gt; will be thrown.
* The &lt;code lang="vb"&gt;Option Strict On&lt;/code&gt; in [[VB.NET]] allows the compiler to require a conversion between objects.

Additional tools such as [[lint (software)|lint]] and [[IBM Rational Purify]] can also be used to achieve a higher level of strictness.

=== Optional type systems ===
It has been proposed, chiefly by [[Gilad Bracha]], that the choice of type system be made independent of choice of language; that a type system should be a module that can be ''plugged'' into a language as needed. He believes this is advantageous, because what he calls mandatory type systems make languages less expressive and code more fragile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bracha.org/pluggableTypesPosition.pdf Bracha, G.: ''Pluggable Types'']&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement that types do not affect the semantics of the language is difficult to fulfill.

Optional typing is related to [[gradual typing]], but still distinct from it.&lt;ref&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/a/13414347/975097&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2014}}

== Polymorphism and types ==
{{Main|Polymorphism (computer science)}}

The term ''polymorphism'' refers to the ability of code (especially, functions or classes) to act on values of multiple types, or to the ability of different instances of the same data structure to contain elements of different types. Type systems that allow polymorphism generally do so in order to improve the potential for code re-use: in a language with polymorphism, programmers need only implement a data structure such as a list or an [[associative array]] once, rather than once for each type of element with which they plan to use it. For this reason computer scientists sometimes call the use of certain forms of polymorphism ''[[generic programming]]''. The type-theoretic foundations of polymorphism are closely related to those of [[abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]], [[module (programming)|modularity]] and (in some cases) [[subtype|subtyping]].

=== Duck typing ===
{{Main|Duck typing}}

In ''duck typing'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1= Rozsnyai |first1= S. |last2= Schiefer |first2= J. |last3= Schatten |first3= A. |chapter= Concepts and models for typing events for event-based systems |title= Proceedings of the 2007 inaugural international conference on Distributed event-based systems – DEBS '07 |pages= 62 |year= 2007 |isbn= 9781595936653 |doi= 10.1145/1266894.1266904}}&lt;/ref&gt; a statement calling a [[method (computer science)|method]] &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; on an object does not rely on the declared type of the object; only that the object, of whatever type, must supply an implementation of the method called, when called, at run-time.

Duck typing differs from [[structural type system|structural typing]] in that, if the ''part'' (of the whole module structure) needed for a given local computation is present ''at runtime'', the duck type system is satisfied in its type identity analysis. On the other hand, a structural type system would require the analysis of the whole module structure at compile time to determine type identity or type dependence.

Duck typing differs from a [[nominative type system]] in a number of aspects. The most prominent ones are that for duck typing, type information is determined at runtime (as contrasted to compile time), and the name of the type is irrelevant to determine type identity or type dependence; only partial structure information is required for that for a given point in the program execution.

Duck typing uses the premise that (referring to a value) "if it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it is a duck" (this is a reference to the [[duck test]] that is attributed to [[James Whitcomb Riley]]). The term may have been coined {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} by [[Alex Martelli]] in a 2000 message&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup

== Specialized type systems ==
Many type systems have been created that are specialized for use in certain environments with certain types of data, or for out-of-band [[static program analysis]]. Frequently, these are based on ideas from formal [[type theory]] and are only available as part of prototype research systems.

=== Dependent types ===
{{Main|Dependent type}}

[[Dependent type]]s are based on the idea of using scalars or values to more precisely describe the type of some other value. For example, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{matrix}(3, 3)&lt;/math&gt; might be the type of a &lt;math&gt;3 \times 3&lt;/math&gt; matrix. We can then define typing rules such as the following rule for matrix multiplication:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{matrix}_{\mathrm{multiply}} : \mathrm{matrix}(k, m) \times \mathrm{matrix}(m, n) \to \mathrm{matrix}(k, n)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary positive integer values. A variant of [[ML (programming language)|ML]] called [[Dependent ML]] has been created based on this type system, but because type checking for conventional dependent types is [[decidable set|undecidable]], not all programs using them can be type-checked without some kind of limits. Dependent ML limits the sort of equality it can decide to [[Presburger arithmetic]].

Other languages such as [[Epigram (programming language)|Epigram]] make the value of all expressions in the language decidable so that type checking can be decidable. However, in general [[Halting Problem|proof of decidability is undecidable]], so many programs require hand-written annotations that may be very non-trivial. As this impedes the development process, many language implementations provide an easy way out in the form of an option to disable this condition. This, however, comes at the cost of making the type-checker run in an [[infinite loop]] when fed programs that do not type-check, causing the compilation to fail.

=== Linear types ===
{{Main|Linear type}}

[[Linear type]]s, based on the theory of [[linear logic]], and closely related to [[uniqueness type]]s, are types assigned to values having the property that they have one and only one reference to them at all times. These are valuable for describing large [[immutable value]]s such as files, strings, and so on, because any operation that simultaneously destroys a linear object and creates a similar object (such as '&lt;code&gt;str= str + "a"&lt;/code&gt;') can be optimized "under the hood" into an in-place mutation. Normally this is not possible, as such mutations could cause side effects on parts of the program holding other references to the object, violating [[referential transparency (computer science)|referential transparency]]. They are also used in the prototype operating system [[Singularity (operating system)|Singularity]] for interprocess communication, statically ensuring that processes cannot share objects in shared memory in order to prevent race conditions. The [[Clean (programming language)|Clean]] language (a [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]-like language) uses this type system in order to gain a lot of speed (compared to performing a deep copy) while remaining safe.

=== Intersection types ===
{{Main|Intersection type}}

[[Intersection type]]s are types describing values that belong to ''both'' of two other given types with overlapping value sets. For example, in most implementations of C the signed char has range -128 to 127 and the unsigned char has range 0 to 255, so the intersection type of these two types would have range 0 to 127. Such an intersection type could be safely passed into functions expecting ''either'' signed or unsigned chars, because it is compatible with both types.

Intersection types are useful for describing overloaded function types: For example, if "{{C-lang|int}} → {{C-lang|int}}" is the type of functions taking an integer argument and returning an integer, and "{{C-lang|float}} → {{C-lang|float}}" is the type of functions taking a float argument and returning a float, then the intersection of these two types can be used to describe functions that do one or the other, based on what type of input they are given. Such a function could be passed into another function expecting an "{{C-lang|int}} → {{C-lang|int}}" function safely; it simply would not use the "{{C-lang|float}} → {{C-lang|float}}" functionality.

In a subclassing hierarchy, the intersection of a type and an ancestor type (such as its parent) is the most derived type. The intersection of sibling types is empty.

The Forsythe language includes a general implementation of intersection types. A restricted form is [[refinement type]]s.

=== Union types ===
{{Main|Union type}}

[[Union type]]s are types describing values that belong to ''either'' of two types. For example, in C, the signed char has a -128 to 127 range, and the unsigned char has a 0 to 255 range, so the union of these two types would have an overall "virtual" range of -128 to 255 that may be used partially depending on which union member is accessed. Any function handling this union type would have to deal with integers in this complete range. More generally, the only valid operations on a union type are operations that are valid on ''both'' types being unioned. C's "union" concept is similar to union types, but is not typesafe, as it permits operations that are valid on ''either'' type, rather than ''both''. Union types are important in program analysis, where they are used to represent symbolic values whose exact nature (e.g., value or type) is not known.

In a subclassing hierarchy, the union of a type and an ancestor type (such as its parent) is the ancestor type. The union of sibling types is a subtype of their common ancestor (that is, all operations permitted on their common ancestor are permitted on the union type, but they may also have other valid operations in common).

=== Existential types ===
{{Main|Existential quantifier}}

[[Existential quantifier|Existential]] types are frequently used in connection with [[Record (computer science)|record type]]s to represent [[module (programming)|module]]s and [[abstract data type]]s, due to their ability to separate implementation from interface. For example, the type "T = ∃X { a: X; f: (X &amp;rarr; int); }" describes a module interface that has a data member named ''a'' of type ''X'' and a function named ''f'' that takes a parameter of the ''same'' type ''X'' and returns an integer. This could be implemented in different ways; for example:

* intT = { a: int; f: (int → int); }
* floatT = { a: float; f: (float → int); }

These types are both subtypes of the more general existential type T and correspond to concrete implementation types, so any value of one of these types is a value of type T. Given a value "t" of type "T", we know that "t.f(t.a)" is well-typed, regardless of what the abstract type ''X'' is. This gives flexibility for choosing types suited to a particular implementation while clients that use only values of the interface type&amp;mdash;the existential type&amp;mdash;are isolated from these choices.

In general it's impossible for the typechecker to infer which existential type a given module belongs to. In the above example intT { a: int; f: (int → int); } could also have the type ∃X { a: X; f: (int → int); }. The simplest solution is to annotate every module with its intended type, e.g.:

* intT = { a: int; f: (int → int); } '''as''' ∃X { a: X; f: (X → int); }

Although abstract data types and modules had been implemented in programming languages for quite some time, it wasn't until 1988 that [[John C. Mitchell]] and [[Gordon Plotkin]] established the formal theory under the slogan: "Abstract [data] types have existential type".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, John C.; Plotkin, Gordon D.; [http://theory.stanford.edu/~jcm/papers/mitch-plotkin-88.pdf ''Abstract Types Have Existential Type''], ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, Vol. 10, No. 3, July 1988, pp. 470–502&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is a second-order [[typed lambda calculus]] similar to [[System F]], but with existential instead of universal quantification.

=== Gradual typing ===
{{Main|Gradual typing}}

[[Gradual typing]] is a type system in which variables may be typed either at [[compile-time]] (which is static typing) or at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]] (which is dynamic typing), allowing software developers to choose either type paradigm as appropriate, from within a single language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/jsiek/what-is-gradual-typing/ |title=What is gradual typing? |author=Siek, Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, gradual typing uses a special type named ''dynamic'' to represent statically-unknown types, and gradual typing replaces the notion of type equality with a new relation called ''consistency'' that relates the dynamic type to every other type. The consistency relation is symmetric but not transitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1= Siek|first1=Jeremy|last2=Taha|first2=Walid|title= Gradual Typing for Functional Languages|url=http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/13-siek.pdf|journal= Scheme and Functional Programming 2006|date= September 2006| pages= 81&amp;ndash;92|publisher= [[University of Chicago]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explicit or implicit declaration and inference ==
{{details|Type inference}}

Many static type systems, such as those of C and Java, require ''type declarations'': The programmer must explicitly associate each variable with a specific type. Others, such as Haskell's, perform ''[[type inference]]'': The compiler draws conclusions about the types of variables based on how programmers use those variables. For example, given a function {{Java|f(x, y)}} that adds {{Java|x}} and {{Java|y}} together, the compiler can infer that {{Java|x}} and {{Java|y}} must be numbers&amp;nbsp;– since addition is only defined for numbers. Thus, any call to {{Java|f}} elsewhere in the program that specifies a non-numeric type (such as a string or list) as an argument would signal an error.

Numerical and string constants and expressions in code can and often do imply type in a particular context. For example, an expression {{Java|3.14}} might imply a type of [[floating-point]], while {{Java|[1, 2, 3]}} might imply a list of integers&amp;nbsp;– typically an [[array data structure|array]].

Type inference is in general possible, if it is [[decidability (logic)|decidable]] in the type theory in question. Moreover, even if inference is undecidable in general for a given type theory, inference is often possible for a large subset of real-world programs. Haskell's type system, a version of [[Type inference#Hindley–Milner type inference algorithm|Hindley–Milner]], is a restriction of [[System F-omega|System Fω]] to so-called rank-1 polymorphic types, in which type inference is decidable. Most Haskell compilers allow arbitrary-rank polymorphism as an extension, but this makes type inference undecidable. (Type checking is decidable, however, and rank-1 programs still have type inference; higher rank polymorphic programs are rejected unless given explicit type annotations.)

== Unified type system ==
Some languages like [[Perl 6]] or [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] have a unified type system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-334.htm Standard ECMA-334], 8.2.4 Type system unification.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that all [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] types including primitive types inherit from a single root object. Every type in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] inherits from the Object class. [[Java (programming language)|Java]] has several primitive types that are not objects. Java provides wrapper object types that exist together with the primitive types so developers can use either the wrapper object types or the simpler non-object primitive types.

== Compatibility: equivalence and subtyping ==
A type-checker for a statically typed language must verify that the type of any [[expression (programming)|expression]] is consistent with the type expected by the context in which that expression appears. For example, in an [[assignment statement]] of the form &lt;code&gt;x := ''e''&lt;/code&gt;,
the inferred type of the expression ''&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;'' must be consistent with the declared or inferred type of the variable &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;. This notion of consistency, called ''compatibility'', is specific to each programming language.

If the type of ''&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;'' and the type of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; are the same, and assignment is allowed for that type, then this is a valid expression. Thus, in the simplest type systems, the question of whether two types are compatible reduces to that of whether they are ''equal'' (or ''equivalent''). Different languages, however, have different criteria for when two type expressions are understood to denote the same type. These different ''equational theories'' of types vary widely, two extreme cases being ''[[structural type system]]s'', in which any two types that describe values with the same structure are equivalent, and ''[[nominative type system]]s'', in which no two syntactically distinct type expressions denote the same type (''i.e.'', types must have the same "name" in order to be equal).

In languages with [[subtype|subtyping]], the compatibility relation is more complex. In particular, if &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; is a subtype of &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;, then a value of type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; can be used in a context where one of type &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; is expected, even if the reverse is not true. Like equivalence, the subtype relation is defined differently for each programming language, with many variations possible. The presence of parametric or ad hoc [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]] in a language may also have implications for type compatibility.

An '''uncertain plural''' occurs when a writer does not know in advance whether a word should be written in the [[Grammatical number|singular]] or [[plural]].  For [[English language|English]] nouns, this may be demonstrated by enclosing the trailing ''s'' in parentheses, such as "book(s)".

In the case of articles, "they" or "their" may be used to include a single individual, when uncertain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6875">In [[computing]], a '''Unicode symbol''' is a [[Unicode]] character which is not part of a script used to write a natural language, but is nonetheless available for use as part of a text.

Many of the symbols are drawn from existing character sets or [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] or other national and international standards. The Unicode Standard states that "The universe of symbols is rich and open-ended."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode11.0.0/ch22.pdf#G14025 | date=June 2018 | title=Section 22: Symbols | work=The Unicode Standard | publisher=The Unicode Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the issue of what symbols to encode and how symbols should be encoded more complicated than the issues surrounding writing systems. Unicode focuses on symbols that make sense in a one-dimensional plain-text context. For example, the typical two-dimensional arrangement of electronic diagram symbols justifies their exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode11.0.0/ch22.pdf#G12269 | date=June 2018 | title=Section 22: Miscellaneous Technical | work=The Unicode Standard | publisher=The Unicode Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Box-drawing character]]s are a partial exception, for legacy purposes, and a number of electronic diagram symbols are indeed encoded in Unicode's [[Miscellaneous Technical]] block.) For adequate treatment in plain text, symbols must also be displayable in a [[monochromatic]] setting. Even with these limitations{{snd}} monochromatic, one-dimensional and standards-based{{snd}} the domain of potential Unicode symbols is extensive. (However, [[emoji]]s{{snd}} [[ideogram]]s, [[graphic]] [[symbol]]s{{snd}} that were admitted into Unicode, allow colors although the colors are not standardized.)

Voigts, B. Schaff &amp;M. Pietrzak-Franger (Eds.). Reflecting on Darwin. Farnham, London: Ashgate.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to a variety of approaches that extend the theory of [[Darwinism]] beyond its original domain of [[biological evolution]] on Earth. Universal Darwinism aims to formulate a generalized version of the mechanisms of [[Genetic diversity|variation]], [[natural selection|selection]] and [[heredity]] proposed by [[Charles Darwin]], so that they can apply to explain [[Evolution (disambiguation)|evolution]] in a wide variety of other domains, including [[psychology]], [[economics]], [[culture]], [[medicine]], [[computer science]] and [[physics]].

==Basic mechanisms==
At the most fundamental level, [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] states that organisms evolve and [[Adaptation|adapt]] to their environment by an iterative process.  This process can be conceived as an [[evolutionary algorithm]] that searches the space of possible forms (the [[fitness landscape]]) for the ones that are best adapted. The process has three components:

* [[Genetic diversity|variation]] of a given form or template. This is usually (but not necessarily) considered to be blind or random, and happens typically by [[mutation]] or [[genetic recombination|recombination]].
* [[Selection (biology)|selection]] of the [[fitness (biology)|fittest]] variants, i.e. those that are best suited to survive and reproduce in their given environment. The unfit variants are eliminated.
* [[heredity]] or retention, meaning that the features of the fit variants are retained and passed on, e.g. in offspring.

After those fit variants are retained, they can again undergo variation, either directly or in their offspring, starting a new round of the [[iteration]]. The overall mechanism is similar to the problem-solving procedures of [[trial-and-error]] or generate-and-test: evolution can be seen as searching for the best solution for the problem  of how to survive and reproduce by generating new trials, testing how well they perform, eliminating the failures, and retaining the successes.

The generalization made in "universal" Darwinism is to replace "organism" by any recognizable pattern, phenomenon, or system. The first requirement is that the pattern can "survive" (maintain, be retained) long enough or "reproduce" (replicate, be copied) sufficiently frequently so as not to disappear immediately. This is the heredity component: the information in the pattern must be retained or passed on. The second requirement is that during survival and reproduction variation (small changes in the pattern) can occur. The final requirement is that there  is a selective "preference" so that certain variants tend to survive or reproduce "better" than others. If these conditions are met, then, by the logic of natural selection, the pattern will evolve towards more adapted forms.

Examples of patterns that have been postulated to undergo variation and selection, and thus adaptation, are [[genes]], ideas ([[memes]]), theories, technologies, [[neurons]] and their connections, words, computer programs, firms, [[antibodies]], institutions, law and judicial systems, quantum states and even whole universes.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, John (2009).

&lt;/ref&gt; but was still lacking the concept of natural selection. Darwin himself, together with subsequent 19th century thinkers such as [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Thorstein Veblen]], [[James Mark Baldwin]] and [[William James]], was quick to apply the idea of selection to other domains, such as language, psychology, society, and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, G. M. (2005). Generalizing Darwinism to social evolution: Some early attempts. Journal of economic issues, 899–914&lt;/ref&gt; However, this evolutionary tradition was largely banned from the social sciences in the beginning of the 20th century, in part because of the bad reputation of [[social Darwinism]], an attempt to use Darwinism to justify social inequality.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Starting in the 1950s, [[Donald T. Campbell]] was one of  the first and most influential authors to revive the tradition, and to formulate a generalized Darwinian [[algorithm]] directly applicable to phenomena outside of biology.&lt;ref&gt;Gontier, N. (2006). Evolutionary Epistemology. Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. http://www.iep.utm.edu/evo-epis/&lt;/ref&gt; In this, he was inspired by [[William Ross Ashby]]'s view of [[self-organization]] and intelligence as fundamental processes of selection.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, D. T. (1960). Blind variation and selective retention in creative thought as in other knowledge processes. Psychological Review, 67(6), 380–400.&lt;/ref&gt; His aim was to explain the development of [[science]] and other forms of [[knowledge]] by focusing on the variation and selection of ideas and theories, thus laying the basis for the domain of [[evolutionary epistemology]]. In the 1990s, Campbell's formulation of the mechanism of "blind-variation-and-selective-retention" (BVSR) was further developed and extended to other domains under the labels of "universal selection theory"&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, D. T. (1990). Epistemological roles for selection theory. Evolution, cognition, and realism: Studies in evolutionary epistemology, 1–19.&lt;/ref&gt; or "universal selectionism"&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, G. M.

Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This conjecture was also presented in 1983 in a paper entitled “The Darwinian Dynamic” that dealt with the evolution of order in living systems and certain nonliving physical systems.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H, Byerly HC, Hopf FA, Michod RA, Vemulapalli GK. (1983) The Darwinian Dynamic. Quarterly Review of Biology 58, 185-207.  {{jstor|2828805}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was suggested “that ‘life’, wherever it might exist in the universe, evolves according to the same dynamical law” termed the Darwinian dynamic.  [[Henry Plotkin]] in his 1997 book&lt;ref&gt;Plotkin, H. C. (1997). Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Darwin machines]] makes the link between universal Darwinism and Campbell's evolutionary epistemology. [[Susan Blackmore]], in her 1999 book ''[[The Meme Machine]]'', devotes a chapter titled 'Universal Darwinism' to a discussion of the applicability of the Darwinian process to a wide range of scientific subject matters.

The philosopher of mind [[Daniel Dennett]], in his 1995 book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'', developed the idea of a Darwinian process, involving variation, selection and retention, as a generic algorithm that is substrate-neutral and could be applied to many fields of knowledge outside of biology. He described the idea of natural selection as a "universal acid" that cannot be contained in any vessel, as it seeps through the walls and spreads ever further, touching and transforming ever more domains. He notes in particular the field of [[memetics]] in the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, Daniel C. (2005), Darwin's Dangerous Idea, Touchstone Press, New York. pp. 352&amp;ndash;360.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In agreement with Dennett's prediction, over the past decades the Darwinian perspective has spread ever more widely, in particular across the [[social sciences]] as the foundation for numerous schools of study including [[memetics]], [[evolutionary economics]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[evolutionary anthropology]], [[neural Darwinism]], and [[evolutionary linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;Oudeyer, P.-Y. and Kaplan, F. (2007) [http://www.pyoudeyer.com/oudeyer-kaplan-cp07.pdf Language Evolution as a Darwinian Process: Computational Studies]. Cognitive Processing, 8(1):21&amp;ndash;35&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have postulated Darwinian processes as operating at the foundations of physics, cosmology and chemistry via the theories of [[quantum Darwinism]],&lt;ref&gt;

Author D. B. Kelley has formulated one of the most all-encompassing approaches to Universal Darwinism. In his 2013 book ''The Origin of Everything'', he holds that [[natural selection]] involves not the preservation of favored races in the struggle for life, as shown by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], but the preservation of favored systems in contention for existence. The fundamental mechanism behind all such stability and evolution is therefore what Kelley calls "[[survival of the fittest]] systems."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Origin of Everything via Universal Selection, or the Preservation of Favored Systems in Contention for Existence|last=Kelley|first=D. B.|publisher=Woodhollow Press|year=2013|isbn=0985462507|location=Newbury, Ohio|pages=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because all systems are cyclical, the Darwinian processes of [[iteration]], variation and [[Natural selection|selection]] are operative not only among species but among all natural phenomena both large-scale and small. Kelley thus maintains that, since the [[Big Bang]] especially, the [[universe]] has evolved from a highly chaotic state to one that is now highly ordered with many stable phenomena, naturally selected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
==Examples of universal Darwinist theories==
The following approaches can all be seen as exemplifying a generalization of Darwinian ideas outside of their original domain of biology. These "Darwinian extensions" can be grouped in two categories, depending on whether they discuss implications of biological (genetic) evolution in other disciplines (e.g. medicine or psychology), or discuss processes of variation and selection of entities other than genes (e.g. computer programs, firms or ideas). However, there is no strict separation possible, since most of these approaches (e.g. in sociology, psychology and linguistics) consider both genetic and non-genetic (e.g. cultural) aspects of evolution, as well as the interactions between them (see e.g. [[gene-culture coevolution]]).

===Gene-based Darwinian extensions===
*[[Evolutionary psychology]] assumes that our emotions, preferences and cognitive mechanisms are the product of natural selection

*[[Evolutionary medicine]] investigates the origin of diseases by looking at the evolution both of the human body and of its parasites
*[[Paleolithic diet]] proposes that the most healthy nutrition is the one to which our hunter-gatherer ancestors have adapted over millions of years
*[[Paleolithic lifestyle]] generalizes the paleolithic diet to include exercise, behavior and exposure to the environment
*[[Molecular evolution]] studies evolution at the level of DNA, RNA and proteins
*[[Biosocial criminology]] studies crime using several different approaches that include genetics and evolutionary psychology
*[[Evolutionary linguistics]] studies the evolution of language, biologically as well as culturally&lt;ref&gt;Schleicher, August. ''Darwinism Tested by the Science of Language.'' (Transl. by Alexander V. W. Bikkers) London, J. C. Hotten (1869)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Darwinian extensions===
*[[Quantum Darwinism]] sees the emergence of classical states in physics as a natural selection of the most stable quantum properties
*[[Cosmological natural selection]] hypothesizes that universes reproduce and are selected for having fundamental constants that maximize "fitness"
*[[Complex adaptive systems]] models the dynamics of complex systems in part on the basis of the variation and selection of its components
*[[Evolutionary computation]] is a Darwinian approach to the generation of adapted computer programs
*[[Genetic algorithms]], a subset of evolutionary computation, models variation by "genetic" operators (mutation and recombination)

*[[Memetics]] is a theory of the variation, transmission, and selection of cultural items, such as ideas, fashions, and traditions
*[[Dual inheritance theory]] a framework for cultural evolution developed largely independently of [[memetics]]
*[[Cultural selection theory]] is a theory of cultural evolution related to [[memetics]]
*[[Evolutionary economics]] studies the variation and selection of economic phenomena, such as commodities, technologies, institutions and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Shiozawa, Y. 2004 Evolutionary Economics in the 21st Century: A Manifesto, ''Evolutionary and  Institutional Economics Review,'' '''1'''(1): 5-47.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Evolutionary ethics]] investigates the origin of morality, and uses Darwinian foundations to formulate ethical values
*[[Big History]] is the science-based narrative integrating the history of the universe, earth, life, and humanity. Scholars consider Universal Darwinism to be a possible unifying theme for the discipline. &lt;ref&gt;Baker, D.

However, it is still used by many governments. The subject of this article is the use of torture since the adoption of the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), which prohibited it.

==Torture in modern society==

Torture is widely practiced worldwide: [[Amnesty International]] received reports of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in more than 150 countries during the four-year period from 1997 to 2000. These accusations concerned acts against [[political prisoner]]s in 70 countries and other prisoners and detainees in more than 130 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT40/001/2003 ''Combating torture – a manual for action''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202125125/http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT40/001/2003 |date=2 December 2012 }}, October 2002, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; State torture has been extensively documented and studied, often as part of efforts at [[truth and reconciliation commission|collective memory and reconciliation]] in societies that have experienced a change in government. Surveys of torture survivors reveal that torture "is not aimed primarily at the extraction of information ... Its real aim is to break down the victim's personality and identity."&lt;ref name=Tizon2002&gt;Orlando Tizon, CovertAction Quarterly, Summer 2002. Tizon is assistant director of the Torture Abolition and Survivors Support Coalition (TASSC) in Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; When applied indiscriminately, torture is used as a tool of repression and deterrence against dissent and community empowerment.

While many states use torture, few wish to be described as doing so, either to their own citizens or to international bodies. So a variety of strategies are used to circumvent their legal and humanitarian duties, including [[plausible deniability]], [[secret police]], "need to know", denial that certain activities constitute torture, appeal to various laws (national or international), use of a [[judicial jurisdiction|jurisdictional argument]], claim of "overriding need", the use of [[torture by proxy]], and so on.&lt;ref name=AIImpunity&gt;Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT40/024/2001 ''End impunity: Justice for the victims of torture''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230012927/http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT40/024/2001 |date=30 December 2013 }}, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all regimes and governments engaging in torture (and other crimes against humanity) consistently deny engaging in it, in spite of overwhelming [[hearsay]] and physical evidence from the citizens they tortured. Through both denial and avoidance of prosecution, most people ordering or carrying out acts of torture do not face legal consequences for their actions.&lt;ref name=AIImpunity /&gt; UN Special Rapporteur for the Commission on Human Rights, Sir [[Nigel Rodley]], believes that "impunity continues to be the principal cause of the perpetuation and encouragement of human rights violations and, in particular, torture."&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Rodley, "Report on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment," UN Document A/54/426, 1 October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

While states, particularly their prisons, law enforcement, military and intelligence apparatus, are major perpetrators of torture, many [[non-state actor]]s also engage in it. These include [[paramilitary|paramilitaries]] and [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]s, criminal actors such as [[organized crime]] syndicates and [[kidnappers]].

A recent approach to interrogations has been to use techniques such as [[waterboarding]], sexual humiliation and [[sexual abuse]], and [[war dog#Use against prisoners|dogs]] to intimidate or pressure prisoners in a manner claimed to be legal under national or international law. Electric shock techniques such as the use of [[stun belt]]s and [[taser]]s have been considered appropriate provided that they are used to "control" prisoners or suspects, even non-violent ones, rather than to extract information. These techniques have been widely criticized as torture.

==Technology==

While methods of torture are often quite crude, a number of new technologies of control have been used by torturers in recent years.  The Brazilian government devised a number of new electrical and mechanical means of torture during the military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985, and proceeded to train military officials from other right-wing Latin American countries in their techniques.&lt;ref name=Weschler1990a&gt;[[Lawrence Weschler]], ''A Miracle, A Universe: Settling Accounts with Torturers'', 1990: 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt; One is the use of tasers and electro-shock devices now widely sold to prison authorities around the world. Minor refinements of ancient techniques--including tearing out fingernails and toenails with iron tools, burning the soles of the feet with clothes irons, and probing between the toes with electric wood-burning pencils--are also widely applied.  Some African nations employ an iron foot-squeezing device patterned after the medieval French boot.

==Inter-state collaboration==

[[File:Vietconginterrogation1967.jpg|thumb|A Viet Cong prisoner captured in 1967 by the U.S. Army awaits interrogation. He has been placed in a [[stress position]] by tying a board between his arms.]]
Substantial cooperation between states in the methods and coordination of torture has been documented. Through the [[Phoenix Program]], the United States helped [[South Vietnam]] co-ordinate a system of detention, torture and assassination of suspected members of the National Liberation Front, or [[Viet Cong]]. During the 1980s wars in Central America, the U.S. government provided manuals and training on [[interrogation]] that extended to the use of torture (see [[U.S. Army and CIA interrogation manuals]]). The manuals were also distributed by Special Forces Mobile Training teams to military personnel and intelligence schools in Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Peru. The manuals have a chapter devoted to "coercive techniques".

The southern cone governments of South America – Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil – involved in [[Operation Condor]] co-ordinated the [[forced disappearance|disappearance]], torture and execution of dissidents in the 1970s. Hundreds were killed in coordinated operations, and the bodies of those recovered were often mutilated and showed signs of torture. This system operated with the knowledge and support of the United States government through the State Department, Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Department.&lt;ref name=JPMcSherry&gt;J. Patrice McSherry, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030316080744/http://larcdma.sdsu.edu/humanrights/rr/PLAarticles/mcsherry.html "Operation Condor: Clandestine Inter-American System"], ''Social Justice'', Winter 1999 v26 i4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States government has, at least since the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]], used the tactic of [[rendition (law)|legal rendition]] in which suspected terrorists were extradited to countries where they were to be prosecuted for crimes allegedly committed. In the "war on terror" this has evolved into [[extraordinary rendition]], the delivery of prisoners or others recently captured, including terrorism suspects, to foreign governments known to practice torture are Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, and Afghanistan. Human rights activists have alleged that the practice amounts to [[kidnapping]] for the purpose of torture, or torture by proxy. A related practice is the operation of facilities for imprisonment, and it is widely believed torture, in foreign countries. In November 2005, the [[Washington Post]] reported —-  citing administration sources —- that such facilities are operated by the [[CIA]] in Thailand (until 2004), Afghanistan, and several unnamed Eastern European countries.&lt;ref name=WPost2005&gt;Dana Priest, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/01/AR2005110101644_pf.html "CIA Holds Terror Suspects in Secret Prisons"], ''The Washington Post'', 2 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] reports that planes associated with rendition have landed repeatedly in Poland and Romania.&lt;ref name=HumanRightsWatch&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/11/07/usint11995.htm "Statement on U.S. Secret Detention Facilities in Europe"], Human Rights Watch, 7 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent instances of torture in selected countries==
{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}
The use of torture is geographically widespread. A review by [[Amnesty International]], which did not use the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] as its definition of torture, of its case files found "reports of torture or ill-treatment by state officials in more than 150 countries from 1997 to 2000". These reports described widespread or persistent patterns of abuse in more than 70 countries and torture-related deaths in more than 80.&lt;ref name=stoptorture&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/stoptorture/about.html "Denounce Torture"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220234103/http://www.amnestyusa.org/stoptorture/about.html |date=20 February 2006 }}, Amnesty International.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Afghanistan===
{{see also|Bagram torture and prisoner abuse}}
Torture has been reported in Afghanistan under each of its recent governments.  Under Najibullah's Soviet-backed regime, beating and electric shocks were widely reported.&lt;ref name=WT1988&gt;Richard S.

===Albania===

Under [[Enver Hoxha|Enver Hoxha's]] [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]], torture was widely used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/h/o.htm |title=Ho |publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]] |accessdate=11 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its fall, Amnesty International has reported [[police abuses]] amounting to torture;{{ref|AIUSA_Albania}} the government says it has "made efforts to punish all acts of torture under the Albanian criminal justice system".{{ref|OHCHR}}

===Algeria===

According to [[Pierre Vidal-Naquet]] in "Torture; Cancer of Democracy" and "Les Damnees de la Terre" by Franz Fanon, torture was practiced endemically by the French forces, commanded by General [[Jacques Massu]], bringing together the experience of "Les Paras" in the Indo-China War and German troops in the [[French Foreign Legion]].

{{Further information|Dirty War}}
During the so-called "[[Dirty War]]" carried out in the 1970s, in particular, but not only, by the [[National Reorganization Process|military dictatorship]] from 1976 to 1983, tens of thousands of Argentines were "[[forced disappearance|disappeared]]" by the junta, many never to be seen again. The [[CONADEP|National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons]] concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In nearly all the cases brought to the attention of the Commission, the victims speak of acts of torture. Torture was an important element in the methodology of repression. Secret torture centres were set up, among other reasons, to enable the carrying out of torture to be carried out undisturbed.&lt;ref name=CONADEP&gt;{{cite web |publisher=National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons |url=http://www.nuncamas.org/english/library/nevagain/nevagain_001.htm |title=The ''Nunca Más'' (Never Again) CONADEP Report |year=1984 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060202021642/http://www.nuncamas.org/english/library/nevagain/nevagain_001.htm |archivedate=2006-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Bahrain===

{{further information|Torture in Bahrain|Torture during the Bahraini uprising (2011–present)}}

Torture has been used frequently by the Bahraini government in the 20th century.

Torture was used regularly by the Brazilian dictatorship regime from 1964 to 1977 against dissidents. It included torturing their children, some of whom were less than 2 years old at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Torturado pela Ditadura Militar ainda bebê, filho de jornalista Dermi Azevedo morre em São Paulo|url=http://noticias.r7.com/brasil/torturado-pela-ditadura-militar-ainda-bebe-filho-de-jornalista-dermi-azevedo-morre-em-sao-paulo-18022013|website=R7 Noticias|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regime of [[Augusto Pinochet]] in Chile in the 1970s used torture extensively against political opponents. Chile's [[Valech Report|National Commission on Political Imprisonment and Torture]] (Comisión Nacional sobre Prisión Política y Tortura) concluded in 2004 that torture had been a systematically implemented policy of the government, and recommended reparations. The commission heard the testimony of more than 35,000 witnesses, whose testimonies are to be kept secret for fifty years.&lt;ref name=HRWChile&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/01/13/chile9846.htm |title=Chile: World Report, Human Rights Watch 2005 |publisher=Human Rights Watch }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/18/chile12205.htm "Chile"], ''Human Rights Watch World Report 2006''.&lt;/ref&gt; Among those tortured were future president [[Michelle Bachelet]], who was held along with her mother at the notorious [[Villa Grimaldi]] detention center in the capital [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]].

Although torture was outlawed in China in 1996, a UN investigator found torture to still be widespread in 2005, particularly because the narrow definition of the law, leaving a mark, does not comply with the UN definition.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Watts, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/dec/03/china.jonathanwatts "Torture still widespread in China, says UN investigator"], ''The Guardian'', London, 3 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

They are confined to narrow cells with no sunlight called "drawers" that have cement beds, a hole on the ground for their bodily needs, and are infested with a multitude of rodents, roaches, and other insects. These female prisoners lack all sort of necessary personal possessions and almost always have no water, even for bathing, often drinking this precious liquid full of insects. The food distributed to them is terrible, smells rotten, and is stored in receptacles lacking in hygiene. Even prison officials have complained of the small quantities served. In these "drawers" the women remain weeks and months.

===France===
{{Further information|Torture during the Algerian War|Human rights in France}}
During the [[Algerian War of Independence]] (1954–1962), the [[Military of France|French military]] used torture against the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] and the civilian population. The French interrogators were notorious for the use of man-powered [[electrical generator]]s on suspects: this form of torture was called ''(la) gégène''.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

That France has provided a pivotal role in the evolution of western torture practices is the central thesis of the French film ''Death Squadrons: The French School'' by [[Marie-Monique Robin|Monique Robin]].
The French had themselves developed practices in defence of its declining empire through the 20th century, setting up torture "universities" at ''Poulo Condor'' (now ''[[Côn Sơn Island|Côn Sơn]]'') – an island off Vietnam (then [[French Indo-China]], subsequently taken over by the United States) and at [[Skikda|Philippeville]] (now ''Skikda'') in Algeria.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

[[Police abuse]] remains a reality in France today, while France has been condemned by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) for the conditions of detention in prisons, including the use of torture on detainees.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Although the law and the Constitution prohibits any kind of torture, such practices happen. In 2004, the [[French police|Inspector General of the National Police]] received 469 registered complaints about illegitimate police violence during the first 11 months of the year, down from 500 during the same period in 2003. There were 59 confirmed cases of police violence, compared to 65 in the previous year. In April 2004, the ECHR condemned the government for "inhumane and degrading treatments" in the 1997 case of a teenager beaten while in police custody. The court ordered the government to pay Giovanni Rivas $20,500 (15,000 euros) in damages and $13,500 (10,000 euros) in court costs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41681.htm "2004 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices in France"], US [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]].&lt;/ref&gt; The head of the police station in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], near Paris, has been forced to resign after allegations of rape and other violence committed by the police force under his orders.

===Guatemala===

During the [[Guatemalan civil war]] and the repression by the army against civilians and suspected opponents of the military dictatorship, murder (even [[genocide]]), torture, rape and inhumane and degrading treatment was systematically used by the Guatemalan armed forces and police. There is evidence that the [[CIA]], in anticommunist campaigns during the 1980s, was involved in these tortures (in Latin America the threat of communism was often used as justification for dictatorship during the [[Cold War]]). Thousands of victims were tortured and murdered. For example, [[Dianna Ortiz]], an American nun who was teaching poor [[Maya peoples|Maya]]n children in the Guatemala highlands, claims that U.S. personnel were present in interrogation and torture rooms in [[Guatemala City]] in 1989 when she was kidnapped, taken to a secret prison and repeatedly raped and tortured by Guatemalan right-wing forces. Ortiz survived because of her American citizenship. Sister Ortiz chronicled her experiences and recovery in a book, ''The Blindfold's Eyes''.&lt;ref&gt;Dianna Ortiz and Patricia Davis, ''The Blindfold's eyes: My journey from torture to truth'', Maryknoll, New York, 2002. {{ISBN|1-57075-435-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; "There were other people in the clandestine cell, the clandestine prison, as well, and I could hear terrible screams. Many were killed. I saw some bodies. There were children, as well", wrote Dianna Ortiz.

===India===
India has not ratified the UN Convention against Torture. Custodial deaths and extrajudicial killings are on the rise. The [[Asian Centre for Human Rights]] released its report, Torture in India 2010, at a press conference in New Delhi. The report stated that, taking 2000 as the base year, custodial deaths have decreased by 41.66%&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100319192605/http://www.achrweb.org/impact/achr-impact2009.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; government between 2004–2005 to 2007–2008. This includes 70.72% increase of deaths in prison and 12.60% increase while in police custody.
The government has stated that it intends to pass the Anti Torture Act 2010 so it can ratify the UN convention against torture. The bill provides up to a 10-year sentence for physical or mental torture by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Cabinet-clears-anti-torture-bill/articleshow/5776064.cms | work=The Times of India | title=Cabinet clears anti-torture bill | date=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arya Aramnejad]], a singer, was jailed for his song "Ali Barkhiz" where he denounces the Islamic regime's crimes during the [[2009 Ashura protests]].

In a study of torture in Iran published in 1999, Iranian-born political historian [[Ervand Abrahamian]] included Iran along with "[[Stalinism|Stalinist Russia]], [[History of the People's Republic of China (1949–1976)|Maoist China]], and early modern Europe" of the [[Inquisition]] and [[Witch-hunt#Early Modern Europe|witch hunts]], as societies that "can be considered to be in a league of their own" in the systematic use of torture.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions'' 1999, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Torture techniques used in the Islamic Republic include:

&lt;blockquote&gt;whipping, sometimes of the back but most often of the feet with the body tied on an iron bed; the qapani; deprivation of sleep; suspension from ceiling and high walls; twisting of forearms until they broke; crushing of hands and fingers between metal presses; insertion of sharp instruments under the fingernails; cigarette burns; submersion under water; standing in one place for hours on end; mock executions; and physical threats against family members. Of these, the most prevalent was the whipping of soles, obviously because it was explicitly sanctioned by the sharia.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions'', 1999, p.139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Chronicle of Higher Education]] International, reports that the widespread practice of [[rape|raping]] women imprisoned for engaging in political protest has been effective in keeping female college students "less outspoken and less likely to take part" in political demonstrations. The journal quotes an Iranian college student as saying, "most of the girls arrested are raped in jail. Families can't cope with that."&lt;ref&gt;1 August 2008,  "Among Scholars, Resistance and Resilience in Iran, Tradition of dissent survives despite government pressure" By AISHA LABI, ''Chronicle of Higher Education International''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq===

The government headed by [[Baath Party|Baathist]] [[Saddam Hussein]] made extensive use of torture, including at the notorious [[Abu Ghraib prison]].

The post-[[2003 Invasion of Iraq|invasion]] [[Iraqi Interim Government|Iraqi government]] holds thousands of people in prison. After investigating from July to October 2004, [[Human Rights Watch]] found that torture was "routine and commonplace." According to their report,

{{Quotation|Methods of torture or ill-treatment cited included routine beatings to the body using a variety of implements such as cables, hosepipes and metal rods.  Detainees reported kicking, slapping and punching; prolonged suspension from the wrists with the hands tied behind the back; electric shocks to sensitive parts of the body, including the earlobes and genitals; and being kept blindfolded and/or handcuffed continuously for several days.

Despite apparently credible claims that people were fed into [[Saddam Hussein's alleged shredder|Saddam Hussein's plastic shredder]] (most likely within Abu Ghraib) prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, no such device was found after the war. In October 1990, it was alleged that Iraqi soldiers had "thrown babies from incubators" during the invasion of Kuwait. This story was supposed to have come from the 'eye-witness testimony' of a 15-year-old Kuwaiti girl, [[Nurse Nayirah]]. Years later it emerged that she was the daughter of [[Saud bin Nasir Al-Sabah]], Kuwait's ambassador to the United States, and that the story was the creation of the [[Hill &amp; Knowlton]] public relations firm employed by the Kuwaitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Stauber, J., Rampton, S.}} (1995) ''Toxic Sludge Is Good for You ''.

After investigation of continued allegations of torture, the Supreme Court ruled in 1999&lt;ref name=SCR&gt;[http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files_eng/94/000/051/A09/94051000.a09.htm Supreme Court ruling], (HCJ 5100/94)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://takdin.co.il/searchg/HCJ%20510094%20Public%20Committee%20Against%20Torture%20v.%20State_hd_0L34rDp8qN3KnC30kQ7Hj.html ''Public Committee Against Torture v. State of Israel''], 15 July 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; that all torture - even moderate physical pressure - was illegal. This decision was praised by human-rights organizations. Despite this reform of the law, [[Amnesty International]] continues to express concerns to Israel about treatment which amounts to torture, and remains unhappy about the steps taken by Israel to eliminate torture. [[Amnesty International]]  stated in 2002:

{{Quotation|...the Israeli HCJ in September 1999 banned a number of interrogation methods ...However the judgment left ... loopholes by which methods amounting to torture or other ill-treatment in detention may continue.|Amnesty International|3=&lt;ref name=AI_Israel&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/074/2002/en/ "Israel and the Occupied Territories: Mass detention in cruel, inhuman and degrading conditions"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Amnesty International Index: MDE 15/074/2002, 23 May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The human rights group [[B'Tselem]] estimated that 85% of all Palestinian detainees suspected of terrorism are subject to prolonged [[sleep deprivation]]; prolonged sight deprivation or [[sensory deprivation]]; forced, prolonged maintenance of body positions that grow increasingly painful; confinement in tiny, closet-like spaces; exposure to temperature extremes, such as in deliberately overcooled rooms; prolonged toilet and hygiene deprivation; and degrading treatment, such as forcing detainees to eat and use the toilet at the same time. Allegations have been made of frequent beatings. Such acts violate Article 16 of the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]].  In January 2000, B'Tselem claimed that the Israeli [[Shin Bet|General Security Service]]'s (GSS) methods of interrogation amounted to the [[five techniques]]: "[The] GSS used methods comparable to those used by the British in 1971, viz. sleep deprivation, infliction of physical suffering, and sensory isolation. But the GSS used them for much longer periods, so the resulting pain and suffering were substantially greater. In addition, the GSS used direct violence... Thus,... in practice, the GSS methods were substantially more severe than those used by the British in 1971..."&lt;ref name=BTselem2000&gt;B'Tselem, ''Legislation allowing for the use of physical force'', January 2000, pp.32,48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kenya===
{{main article|Mau_Mau_Uprising#Mau_Mau_war_crimes}}
[[Mau Mau]] inflicted torture and death on 1,819 [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] during their uprising in the 1950s, along with 58 people of European and Asian descent.

===Lebanon===
Suspected [[Hezbollah]] guerrillas, their families and Lebanese civilian internees were previously detained in the [[South Lebanon Army]] (SLA) prison at [[Khiam]] in the then Israeli-occupied Southern Lebanon. Torture, including electric shock torture, by the SLA was routine. This was detailed after the end of the occupation in 2000, when Lebanese who freed the prisoners found instruments of torture.&lt;ref name=HRW_Israel&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1994/israel/ "Torture and ill-treatment: Israel's Interrogation of Palestinians from the Occupied Territories"], Human Rights Watch, June 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unhchr_Israel&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/0/daf82ddcda36946e80256609004b7df9?OpenDocument "Concluding observations of the Committee against Torture: Israel. 18/05/98"] by [[UNHCR]] Committee Against Torture, Twentieth session, 4–22 May 1998, A/53/44, paras.232–242.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nigeria===

In 2005, Human Rights Watch documented that Nigerian police in the cities of [[Enugu]], [[Lagos]] and [[Kano]] routinely practice torture. Dozens of witnesses and survivors stepped forward to testify to repeated, severe beatings, abuse of sexual organs, rape, death threats, injury by shooting, and the denial of food and water. These abuses were used in campaigns against common crime.&lt;ref name=HRWNigeria2005&gt;[http://hrw.org/reports/2005/nigeria0705/ "Rest in Pieces: Police Torture and Deaths in Custody in Nigeria"], Human Rights Watch, July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Systematic torture was used in conjunction with military occupation in an attempt to quell anti-[[petroleum|oil]] protests by the [[Ogoni people]] in the [[Niger Delta]], according to a [[World Council of Churches]] report.&lt;ref name=WCC1997&gt;Deborah Robinson, [http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Urgent_Action/dc_4897.html "Ogoni: The Struggle Continues"], World Council of Churches.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian pastors in Nigeria have been involved in the torturing and killing of children accused of witchcraft. Church pastors, in an effort to distinguish from the competition, establish their credentials by accusing children of witchcraft.  When repeatedly asked to comment about the matter, the Church has refused to comment.&lt;ref&gt;Katharine Houreld, [http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/world/church-burns-witchcraft-children/story-e6frev00-1225788721635 "Church burns 'witchcraft' children"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', Sydney, 20 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Vietnam===
From 1961 to 1973, the North Vietnamese and Vietcong held hundreds of Americans captive. Hanoi's Ministry of Public Security's Medical Office (MPSMO) was responsible for "preparing studies and performing research on the most effective Soviet, French, Communist Chinese and other ...techniques..." of extracting information from POWs. The MPSMO "...supervised the use of torture and the use of drugs to induce [American] prisoners to cooperate." Its functions also "...included working with Soviet and Communist Chinese intelligence advisors who were qualified in the use of medical techniques for intelligence purposes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiu.edu/~fcf/warcrimes.cuba.vietnam.html "War Crimes: The Cuban-Vietnam Connection"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718102449/http://www.fiu.edu/~fcf/warcrimes.cuba.vietnam.html |date=18 July 2008 }}, National Alliance of Families.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palestinian Territories===
The [[Palestinian Authority]] has reportedly practiced torture in the occupied territories over the years. Amnesty International found: "Torture [by the Palestine Authority] of [[detainee]]s remained widespread. Seven detainees died in custody. Unlawful killings, including possible extrajudicial executions, continued to be reported."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Recent publications Highlighted research |url=https://www.amnesty.org/ailib/aireport/ar98/mde21.htm |title=Library |publisher=Amnesty International |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208141705/http://www.amnesty.org/ailib/aireport/ar98/mde21.htm |archivedate=8 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 100 cases of torture by Palestinian security services were reported in 2010. Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said: "The reports of torture by Palestinian security services keep rolling in. President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad are well aware of the situation. They need to reverse this rampant impunity and make sure that those responsible are prosecuted."&lt;ref&gt;"West Bank: Reports of Torture in Palestinian Detention." UNHCR. 20 October 2010.

At least six Palestinians have died under torture in PA prisons. According to a report by the Arab Organization for Human Rights in Britain, the PA has used torture on a systematic basis for years. Methods include beatings with cables, pulling out nails, suspension from the ceiling, flogging, kicking, cursing, electric shocks, sexual harassment and the threat of rape. The report went on to say "Every one of those detainees has been subject to humiliating and degrading treatment and stayed in cells for more than 10 days. The analysis shows that an astonishing 95 percent of the detainees were subjected to severe torture, others feeling the detrimental effects on their health for varying periods."&lt;ref&gt;Abu Toameh, Khaled.

Human Rights Watch reported 147 cases of torture by Hamas in the West Bank during 2011 and that none of the perpetrators had been prosecuted "despite consistent allegations of severe abuse." It further stated that "Some men said they had needed medical care due to torture and sought to obtain medical records as evidence that they had been tortured, but that hospital officials refused to provide them. Hamas’s rival in the West Bank, the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, arrests and detains Palestinians arbitrarily, including Hamas members or sympathizers, and similarly subjects detainees to torture and abuse."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/10/03/gaza-arbitrary-arrests-torture-unfair-trials Gaza: Arbitrary Arrests, Torture, Unfair Trials]. 3 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another report, Human Rights Watch "documents cases in which [Palestinian] security forces tortured, beat, and arbitrarily detained journalists, confiscated their equipment, and barred them from leaving the West Bank and Gaza." HRW also reported an incident in which "the Hamas Ministry of Interior summoned a journalist who published an article on torture by Hamas authorities in secret detention facilities, threatened to take legal action against him if he did not publish an apology for the article, and warned him to correct his 'biased' reporting."&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch (6 April 2011).

Part 2 of Article 21 of the Constitution states that "no one may be subjected to torture, violence or any other harsh or humiliating treatment or punishment…".&lt;ref name="brief"/&gt; However Russian police are regularly observed practicing torture – including beatings, electric shocks, rape, asphyxiation – in interrogating arrested suspects.&lt;ref name=AI_Russia&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/russia/torture.html |publisher=Amnesty International |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416203523/http://www.amnesty.org/russia/torture.html |archivedate=2009-04-16 |title=Torture and ill-treatment }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AI_Russia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rights"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/russia/pdfs/justice-report-eng.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325142206/http://www.amnesty.org/russia/pdfs/justice-report-eng.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-25 |publisher=Amnesty International |title=ROUGH JUSTICE: The law and human rights in the Russian Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hrw4"&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/11/13/russia14557.htm "UN Committee against Torture Must Get Commitments From Russia to Stop Torture"], Human Rights Watch, 13 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Torture and humiliation, or ''[[dedovshchina]]'', are also widespread in Russian's military, according to Human Rights Watch.&lt;ref name="dedov"&gt;[http://hrw.org/reports/2004/russia1004/6.htm "The Consequences of Dedovshchina"], Human Rights Watch, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; This is essentially the Russian version of [[bullying]] or [[hazing]] that is practiced in the American military, however it is often much more brutal.

In the most extreme cases, hundreds of innocent people from the street were arbitrarily arrested, beaten, tortured, and raped by special police forces ("Red Terror").

===Saudi Arabia===

Saudi Arabia officially considers torture illegal under [[Islamic Law]]; however, it is widely practiced, as in the case of [[William Sampson (author)|William Sampson]]. According to a 2003 report by Amnesty International, "torture and ill-treatment remained rife."&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/report2003/sau-summary-eng "AI Report 2003: Saudi Arabia"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501215008/http://web.amnesty.org/report2003/sau-summary-eng |date=1 May 2006 }}, Amnesty International, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Hanny Megally, Executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch, stated in 2002 "The practice of torture in Saudi Arabia is well documented",&lt;ref&gt;
[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2002/02/05/saudia3721.htm "Saudi Arabia: New Evidence Of Torture"], Human Rights Watch 5 February 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Human Rights Watch ''World Report 2003'', "Torture under interrogation of political prisoners and criminal suspects continued",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/wr2k3/mideast6.html "Human Rights Watch World Report 2003: Saudi Arabia"], Human Rights Watch, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2006 report notes that "Arbitrary detention, mistreatment and torture of detainees, restrictions on freedom of movement, and lack of official accountability remain serious concerns".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/18/saudia12230.htm "World Report 2006: Saudi Arabia"], Human Rights Watch, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===

Torture was widely practiced by the brutal [[NKVD|Soviet secret police]] during the [[Stalinism]] era to extract (often false) confessions from suspects often called [[enemy of the people|enemies of the people]]. One of the most prevalent and effective types of torture was [[sleep deprivation]], nicknamed "conveyor" due to interrogators replacing one another to keep the inmate from sleeping.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Solzhenitsyn. "The Gulag Archipelago"&lt;/ref&gt; The use of torture was authorized by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the Communist Party]] and personally by [[Joseph Stalin]]. During the [[Doctor's Plot]], Stalin ordered falsely accused physicians to be tortured "to death".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novayagazeta.ru/data/2008/gulag09/00.html "Stalin's torture: 'Beat them to death'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020110400/http://www.novayagazeta.ru/data/2008/gulag09/00.html |date=20 October 2008 }}, ''Novaya Gazeta'', Moscow, 16 October 2008. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torture was still used after Stalin by the [[KGB]] but not on the same extent and level.

===Spain===
The Spanish kingdom categorically denies the existence of torture.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [http://web.amnesty.org/report2004/esp-summary-eng ''AI Report 2004''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050218023703/http://web.amnesty.org/report2004/esp-summary-eng |date=18 February 2005 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Spanish authorities consistently fail to implement recommendations by the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture and the UN Committee Against Torture to combat the use of torture in detention. The UN committee expressed its concern "about the length of judicial procedures and made reference to reports that indicated that five years had sometimes passed between crime and sentence. The Committee warned that this problem reduces the effect of penal action and discourages people to file complaints." It further indicated that "all members of the Committee were also deeply concerned about the legal practice of five days incommunicado detention" (since October 2003, a reform of the Criminal Procedure Code has extended that period to a maximum of 13 days).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ishr.ch/About%20UN/Reports%20and%20Analysis/CAT/CAT-29thSession.htm#_ftnref4 |title=Fourth periodic report on Spain in the 29th session of the UN Committee Against Torture |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050301143523/http://www.ishr.ch/About%20UN/Reports%20and%20Analysis/CAT/CAT-29thSession.htm |archivedate=2005-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Committee for the Prevention of Torture, [http://cpt.coe.int/en/states/esp.htm "Spain"], Council of Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009 a video emerged of a United Arab Emirates Royal [[Sheikh|Sheik]], Sheik [[Issa bin Zayed Al Nahyan]] (a son of [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]]) directing the torture of an Afghan grain dealer Mohammed Shah Poor The video includes the man being tortured with a cattle prod to his genitals, sand in his mouth and being run over by a [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] [[SUV]]. A man in a UAE police uniform is seen on the tape tying the victim's arms and legs, and later holding him down. The official response of the UAE government was that Sheik Issa is the man shown in the video but he did nothing wrong. The incidents depicted in the videotapes were not part of a pattern of behaviour, the Ministry of the Interior said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/posted/archive/2009/04/23/267703.aspx ABC revealed torture movie]{{dead link|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=7402099&amp;page=1 |title=ABC News Exclusive: Torture Tape Implicates UAE Royal Sheikh |publisher=ABC News |date=22 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kenya====
During the [[Mau Mau uprising]] of the 1950s, British colonial forces rounded up more than a million of [[Kikuyu people]] — most of them innocent victims of [[collective punishment]] — and imprisoned them in [[concentration camps]] in order to flush out the Mau Mau insurgency. In order to extract information about the insurgency and terrorize the enemy, the British used brutal methods to force Kenyans to confess and repudiate the Mau Mau oath. Under slogans like "labor and freedom" and other variations on "[[Arbeit macht frei]]," inmates were worked to death as slave labor filling in mass graves under cruel conditions. Some men were anally raped with knives. Some women had their breasts mutilated and cut off. Eyes were gouged out and ears cut off and skin lacerated with coiled barbed wire. Interrogation involved stuffing a detainee’s mouth with mud and stamping on his throat until he passed out or died. Survivors were sometimes burned alive, while British guards and interrogators took joy and laughed. British troops denying access to medical aid to the detainees were widespread. A former British officer described a British detention camp in Kenya in 1954: "Short rations, overwork, brutality, humiliating and disgusting treatment, flogging — all in violation of the [[UN Declaration of Human Rights]]." According to Canon Bewes, a British missionary, there was a "constant stream of reports of brutalities by police, military and home guards. Some of the people had been using castration instruments and two men had died under castration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Britain's gulag: the brutal end of empire in Kenya |pages=124–145 |publisher=Pimlico |author=Caroline Elkins |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Histories of the Hanged: The Dirty War in Kenya and the End of Empire |pages=150–154 |publisher=W.

Among the detainees who suffered severe mistreatment was [[Hussein Onyango Obama]], the grandfather of [[U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]]. According to his widow, British soldiers forced pins into his fingernails and buttocks and squeezed his testicles between metal rods and two others were castrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/05/kenyan-mau-mau-payout-uk-regret-abuse |title= Kenya: UK expresses regret over abuse as Mau Mau promised payout |date=5 June 2013 |work=The Guardian |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; One British settler described the typical British interrogation:

{{Quotation|We knew the slow method of torture [at the Mau Mau Investigation Center] was worse than anything we could do. Special Branch there had a way of slowly electrocuting a Kuke—they'd rough up one for days. Once I went personally to drop off one gang member who needed special treatment. I stayed for a few hours to help the boys out, softening him up. Things got a little out of hand. By the time I cut his balls off, he had no ears, and his eyeball, the right one, I think, was hanging out of its socket. Too bad, he died before we got much out of him.}}

On 22 November 1954, Colonel Arthur Young sent a letter to [[List of colonial governors of Kenya|Governor]] [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Baron Howick of Glendale|Evelyn Baring]] about the "inhumanity" of various parts of the security forces amid his investigations of wrongdoing:

{{quotation|The other lamentable aspect of this case [i.e. Judgment of the East Africa Court of Appeal, Criminal Appeals 891 and 892 of 1954] is the horror of some of the so called Screening Camps which, in my judgment, now present a state of affairs so deplorable that they should be investigated without delay so that the ever increasing allegations of inhumanity and disregard of the rights of the African citizen are dealt with and so that Government will have no reason either to be embarrassed or ashamed of the acts which are done in its name by its own servants. As things are at present there is no one who can investigate such allegations and no independent authority who is responsible for the conduct at these camps. An African who is unfortunate enough to suffer from the brutalities which are clearly evident has no one to whom he can complain and no one to regard his interests since the local Administrative Officer is, himself, the authority for the camps. Moreover, the injured person is unlikely to appeal to the police for redress if they are to be regarded as subordinate to the Executive...I do not consider that in the present circumstances Government have taken all the necessary steps to ensure that in its Screening Camps the elementary principles of justice and humanity are observed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leighday.co.uk/LeighDay/media/LeighDay/documents/Mau%20Mau/Historian%20witness%20statements/Prof-Elkins-3rd-Statement--Exhibit-CE1-.pdf?ext=.pdf rof-Elkins-3rd-Statement--Exhibit]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In January 1955, Baring sent a telegram to [[Alan Lennox-Boyd, 1st Viscount Boyd of Merton|Alan Lennox-Boyd]], the Secretary of State for the Colonies and a cabinet minister, and told them that eight white European officers who had been accused of serious crimes, including accessory to murder, would be given immunity from prosecution. One district officer was accused of the "beating up and roasting alive of one African". A Kenyan Regiment Sergeant and a field intelligence assistance had been implicated in the burning of two further suspects "during screening operations". "I had not myself realised until today that the extension of the principle of clemency to all members of the security forces involved so many cases with Europeans as principals," wrote Baring.&lt;ref name="MAU MAU"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13044974 |title= British Mau Mau abuse papers revealed|date=12 April 2011  |author=Dominic Casciani |work=BBC |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Baring's administration devised the "dilution technique" — a system of assaults and psychological shocks to detainees, to force the compliance of the toughest Mau Mau supporters. Lennox-Boyd was told that one commander, Terrence Gavaghan, had developed the techniques at the Mwea camps in central Kenya - and he needed permission to treat the worst detainees in a "rough way". Baring telegrammed the Colonial Secretary in London asking for his approval to use "overpowering" force, and the cabinet minister's approval came within weeks. A ministerial delegation saw firsthand prisoners beaten for refusing to don camp clothes. Ringleaders of the "Mau Mau moan" - a chant of defiance - were singled out for special punishment. They were beaten and forced to the ground. Once there, a boot was placed on their throat while mud was forced into their mouths. Gavaghan also explained how difficult detainees would be subjected to the "third degree". "The measures adopted were to be kept awake all night, having water thrown at him and to be beaten up on a variety of pretexts."&lt;ref name="MAU MAU"/&gt;

One Hanslope Park document is a letter between Kenyan Special Branch police officers about treatment of "fanatical" detainees at the Mwea camps.

{{quotation|If they deny having taken an oath they are given summary punishment which usually consists of a good beating up. This treatment usually breaks a large proportion. If this treatment does not bear fruit the detainee is taken to the far end of the camp where buckets of stone are waiting. These buckets are placed on the detainee's head and he is made to run around in circles until he agrees to confess the oath.&lt;ref name="MAU MAU"/&gt;}}

In June 1957, Eric Griffith-Jones, the attorney general of the British administration in Kenya, wrote to Baring, detailing the way the regime of abuse at the colony's detention camps was being subtly altered. He said that the mistreatment of the detainees is "distressingly reminiscent of conditions in [[Nazi Germany]] or [[Soviet Union|Communist Russia]]". Despite this, he said that in order for abuse to remain legal, Mau Mau suspects must be beaten mainly on their upper body, "vulnerable parts of the body should not be struck, particularly the spleen, liver or kidneys", and it was important that "those who administer violence ... should remain collected, balanced and dispassionate". He also agreed to draft legislation that sanctioned beatings, as long as the abuse was kept secret, and reminded the governor that "If we are going to sin," he wrote, "we must sin quietly."&lt;ref name="MAU"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/05/kenyan-mau-mau-payout-uk-regret-abuse |title=Kenya: UK expresses regret over abuse as Mau Mau promised payout |date=5 June 2013 |publisher=guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/05/kenyan-mau-mau-payout-uk-regret-abuse |title=Sins of colonialists lay concealed for decades in secret archive |date=18 April 2012 |publisher=Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northern Ireland====
During [[the Troubles]], members of the British Army and the British security forces had routinely used torture on [[List of organisations known as the Irish Republican Army|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) suspects in [[Northern Ireland]], a part of the United Kingdom.

In 1971, as part of [[Operation Demetrius]], fourteen arrested men were subjected to a program of "deep interrogation" at [[Shackleton Barracks|a secret interrogation centre]]. The interrogation methods involved [[sensory deprivation]] and were referred to as the "[[five techniques]]". The [[European Court of Human Rights]] defined them as ''wall-standing, hooding, subjection to noise, deprivation of sleep, and deprivation of food and drink''. For seven days, when not being interrogated, the detainees were kept [[hooding|hooded]] and handcuffed in a cold cell and subjected to a continuous loud hissing noise. Here they were forced to stand in a [[stress position]] for many hours and were deprived of sleep, food and drink. They were also repeatedly beaten, and some reported being kicked in the genitals, having their heads banged against walls and being threatened with injections. The effect was severe pain, severe physical and mental exhaustion, severe anxiety, depression, hallucinations, disorientation and repeated loss of consciousness.&lt;ref name=mcguffin4&gt;[http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guineapigs.htm ''The Guineapigs''] by John McGuffin (1974, 1981). [http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guinea4.htm Chapter 4: The Experiment].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcguffin6&gt;[http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guineapigs.htm ''The Guineapigs''] by John McGuffin (1974, 1981). [http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guinea6.htm Chapter 6: Replay].&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourteen so-called "Hooded Men" were the only detainees subjected to all five techniques together. Some other detainees were subjected to at least one of the five techniques, along with other interrogation methods.&lt;ref name=mcguffin9&gt;[http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guineapigs.htm ''The Guineapigs''] by John McGuffin (1974, 1981). [http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guinea9.htm Chapter 9: Down on the Killing Floor].&lt;/ref&gt; These allegedly included [[waterboarding]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/northernireland/6862034/Prisoners-in-Northern-Ireland-subjected-to-waterboarding-by-British-army-officers.html "Prisoners in Northern Ireland 'subjected to waterboarding by British army officers'"]. ''The Telegraph''. 22 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electric shock#Torture|electric shocks]], burning with matches and candles, forcing internees to stand over hot electric fires while beating them, beating and squeezing of the genitals, inserting objects into the anus, injections, [[Foot whipping|whipping the soles of the feet]], and psychological abuse such as [[Russian roulette]].&lt;ref name=mcguffin9/&gt;

Details of the "deep interrogation" program became known to the public, sparking outrage. In response, the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]] commissioned an inquiry, under [[Hubert Parker, Baron Parker of Waddington|Lord Parker]], to look into the five techniques. In 1972 the 'Parker Report' concluded that the five techniques were illegal under domestic law. British Prime Minister, [[Edward Heath]], then announced that the five techniques would no longer be used under his government. However, he said that if a future British government decided to reintroduce them, it would need to be approved by Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Tobias. ''This Side of Silence: Human Rights, Torture, and the Recognition of Cruelty''. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011. pp.34-35&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of Ireland|Irish Government]] had begun international legal action against the British Government over the Hooded Men in 1971. In 1976, the [[European Commission of Human Rights]] ruled that the program of deep interrogation, using the five techniques, amounted to "torture".&lt;ref name=bbcnov14&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-30177715 "Amnesty calls on Irish government to reopen 'hooded men' case"]. BBC News. 24 November 2014. Retrieved 12 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The case was then referred to the [[European Court of Human Rights]]. In 1978 it ruled that the program amounted to "inhuman and degrading treatment" which breached the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], but did not amount to torture.&lt;ref name=bbcnov14/&gt; In 2014, evidence emerged that the British Government had withheld information from the Court. Following these revelations, the Irish Government announced in December 2014 that it would be asking the Court to review its judgement and acknowledge the five techniques as torture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2014/1202/664159-hooded-men/ "State to apply to have 'Hooded Men' judgment revised by ECHR"] (RTÉ News);[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/government-asks-european-court-to-revise-hooded-men-ruling-1.2022790 "Government asks European court to revise 'Hooded Men' ruling"] (Irish Times); [https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-30296397 "Hooded Men: Irish government bid to reopen 'torture' case"] (BBC News). Retrieved 12 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court's ruling, that the five techniques did not amount to torture, was later cited by the United States and Israel to justify their own interrogation methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caj.org.uk/contents/1264 "The Hooded Men - joint press release from CAJ and the Pat Finucane Centre"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322042506/http://www.caj.org.uk/contents/1264 |date=22 March 2016 }}.

====21st century====
On 23 February 2005, British soldiers were found guilty of abuse of Iraqi prisoners arrested for looting at a [[British Army]] camp called Bread Basket, in [[Basra]], during May 2003. The judge at the military court, Judge Advocate Michael Hunter, said of photographs and the soldier's behaviour:

{{Quotation|Anyone with a shred of human decency would be revolted by what is contained in those pictures. The actions of you and those responsible for these acts have undoubtedly tarnished the international reputation of the British Army and, to some extent, the British nation too, and it will no doubt hamper the efforts of those who are now risking their lives striving to achieve stability in the Gulf region, and it will probably be used by those who are working against such ends.|Judge Advocate Michael Hunter|}}

On 7 December 2005, the House of Lords reversed the deportations of Muslims convicted on "evidence procured by torture inflicted by foreign officials", and cited the 1978 case in ruling that centuries of common law and recent international conventions made torture anathema in the country's courts. Lord Bingham said it was "clear that from its very earliest days the common law of England set its face firmly against the use of torture"; Lord Nicholls said "Torture is not acceptable. This is a bedrock moral principle in this country"; Lord Hoffman said "The use of torture is dishonourable. It corrupts and degrades the state which uses it and the legal system which accepts it."; Lord Hope said it was "one of most evil practices known to man"; Lord Rodgers said "the unacceptable nature of torture ... has long been unquestioned in this country."; Lord Carswell referred to the "abhorrence felt by civilised nations for the use of torture"; and Lord Brown said that "torture is an unqualified evil. It can never be justified. Rather it must always be punished.".&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldjudgmt/jd051208/aand.pdf House of Lords Session 2005–06] 2005 UKHL 71 on appeal from: [2004] EWCA Civ 1123.

Crawford]], a retired judge, who was responsible for reviewing practices at the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]], said of one Guantanamo Bay detainee, "his treatment met the legal definition of torture, and that is why I did not refer the case" for prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/13/AR2009011303372.html?hpid=topnews "Detainee Tortured, Says U.S. Official"], ''The Washington Post'', 13 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Government denies that torture is being conducted in the detention camps at [[Guantanamo Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/press/2001/11/TortureQandA.htm Human Rights Watch], 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dana Priest and Barton Gellman, "U.S. Decries Abuse but Defends Interrogations", ''The Washington Post'', 26 December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported in June 2008 that, according to human rights lawyers, the USA was "operating floating prisons to house those arrested in its war on terror":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"According to research carried out by Reprieve, the US may have used as many as 17 ships as 'floating prisons' since 2001. Detainees are interrogated aboard the vessels and then rendered to other, often undisclosed, locations, it is claimed. Ships that are understood to have held prisoners include the [[USS Bataan (LHD-5)|USS Bataan]] and [[USS Peleliu (LHA-5)|USS Peleliu]]. A further 15 ships are suspected of having operated around the British territory of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, which has been used as a military base by the UK and the Americans.
&lt;br /&gt;
... The Reprieve study includes the account of a prisoner released from Guantánamo Bay, who described a fellow inmate's story of detention on an amphibious assault ship. 'One of my fellow prisoners in Guantánamo was at sea on an American ship with about 50 others before coming to Guantánamo ... he was in the cage next to me. He told me that there were about 50 other people on the ship. They were all closed off in the bottom of the ship. The prisoner commented to me that it was like something you see on TV. The people held on the ship were beaten even more severely than in Guantánamo.'"&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Campbell and Richard Norton-Taylor, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/02/usa.humanrights "US accused of holding terror suspects on prison ships"], ''The Guardian'', London, 2 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uzbekistan===

After an investigating visit to Uzbekistan, [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on Torture  [[Theo van Boven]] concluded:&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/pub/2005/Uzbekistan_Special_Rapporteur_Report_Feb03.pdf Report of the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture], UN Commission on Human Rights, February 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|Even though only a small number of torture cases can be proved with absolute certainty, the copious testimonies gathered ... are so consistent in their description of torture techniques and the places and circumstances in which torture is perpetrated that the pervasive and persistent nature of torture throughout the investigative process cannot be denied.|Theo van Boven|}}

Forms of torture frequently cited include immersion in boiling water, exposure to extreme heat and cold, "the use of electric shock, temporary suffocation, hanging by the ankles or wrists, removal of fingernails, punctures with sharp objects, rape, the threat of rape, and the threat of murder of family members."&lt;ref name=HRWUzbek2001&gt;Human Rights Watch, [https://www.hrw.org/wr2k1/europe/uzbekistan.html Uzbekistan, World Report 2001].&lt;/ref&gt; (For example, see [[Muzafar Avazov]].)

In 2003, Britain's Ambassador for Uzbekistan, Craig Murray, said that information was being extracted under extreme torture from dissidents in that country, and that the information was subsequently being used by Britain and other western, democratic countries which disapproved of torture.&lt;ref name=Telegraph_23Oct2004&gt;Robin Gedye, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/4194001/The-envoy-silenced-after-telling-undiplomatic-truths.html "The envoy silenced after telling undiplomatic truths"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', London, 23 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The notion of a van Kampen diagram was introduced by [[Egbert van Kampen]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;E. van Kampen. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2371129 ''On some lemmas in the theory of groups''.] [[American Journal of Mathematics]].
vol. 55, (1933), pp. 268&amp;ndash;273.&lt;/ref&gt; This paper appeared in the same issue of [[American Journal of Mathematics]] as another paper of van Kampen, where he proved what is now known as the [[Seifert–van Kampen theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;E. R. van Kampen. ''On the connection between the fundamental groups of some related spaces''. American Journal of Mathematics, vol. 55 (1933), pp. 261&amp;ndash;267.&lt;/ref&gt; The main result of the paper on van Kampen diagrams, now known as the ''van Kampen lemma'' can be deduced from the [[Seifert–van Kampen theorem]] by applying the latter to the presentation complex of a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/invitations-to-geometry-and-topology-9780198507727?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=Invitations to Geometry and Topology|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198507727|series=Oxford Graduate Texts in Mathematics|location=Oxford, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, van Kampen did not notice it at the time and this fact was only made explicit much later (see, e.g.&lt;ref name="O"&gt;Aleksandr Yur'evich Ol'shanskii. ''Geometry of defining relations in groups.'' Translated from the 1989 Russian original by Yu. A. Bakhturin. Mathematics and its Applications (Soviet Series), 70. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, 1991. {{isbn|0-7923-1394-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). Van Kampen diagrams remained an underutilized tool in [[group theory]] for about thirty years, until the advent of the [[small cancellation theory]] in the 1960s, where van Kampen diagrams play a central role.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Chandler, and [[Wilhelm Magnus]]. ''The history of combinatorial group theory. A case study in the history of ideas.'' Studies in the History of Mathematics and Physical Sciences, 9. [[Springer-Verlag]], New York, 1982. {{isbn|0-387-90749-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently van Kampen diagrams are a standard tool in [[geometric group theory]]. They are used, in particular, for the study of isoperimetric functions in groups, and their various generalizations such as isodiametric functions, filling length functions, and so on.

==Formal definition==

The definitions and notations below largely follow Lyndon and Schupp.&lt;ref name="LS"&gt;[[Roger Lyndon|Roger C. Lyndon]] and [[Paul E. Schupp]]. Combinatorial Group Theory. Springer-Verlag, New York, 2001. "Classics in Mathematics" series, reprint of the 1977 edition. {{isbn|978-3-540-41158-1}}; Ch. V. Small Cancellation Theory. pp. 235&amp;ndash;294.&lt;/ref&gt;

Let 
:&lt;math&gt;G=\langle A | R\, \rangle&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(†)
be a [[group presentation]] where all ''r''∈''R'' are [[cyclically reduced word|cyclically reduced words]] in the [[free group]] ''F''(''A''). The alphabet ''A'' and the set of defining relations ''R'' are often assumed to be finite, which corresponds to a finite [[group presentation]], but this assumption is not necessary for the general definition of a van Kampen diagram.  Let ''R''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt; be the ''symmetrized closure'' of ''R'', that is, let ''R''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt; be obtained from ''R'' by adding all cyclic permutations of elements of ''R'' and of their inverses.

A '''van Kampen diagram''' over the presentation (†) is a planar finite [[cell complex]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt;, given with a specific embedding &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\subseteq \mathbb R^2\,&lt;/math&gt; with the following additional data and satisfying the following additional properties:

#The complex &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt; is connected and [[simply connected]].
#Each ''edge'' (one-cell) of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt; is labelled by an arrow and a letter ''a''∈''A''.
#Some ''vertex'' (zero-cell) which belongs to the topological boundary of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\subseteq \mathbb R^2\,&lt;/math&gt; is specified as a ''base-vertex''. 
#For each ''region'' (two-cell) of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt; for every vertex the boundary cycle of that region and for each of the two choices of direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) the label of the boundary cycle of the region read from that vertex and in that direction is a freely reduced word in ''F''(''A'') that belongs to ''R''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;.

Thus the 1-skeleton of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt; is a finite connected planar graph ''Γ'' embedded in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^2\,&lt;/math&gt; and the two-cells of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt; are precisely the bounded complementary regions for this graph.

By the choice of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt; Condition 4 is equivalent to requiring that for each region of  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt; there is some boundary vertex of that region and some choice of direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) such that the boundary label of the region read from that vertex and in that direction is freely reduced and belongs to ''R''.

A van Kampen diagram &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt; also has the ''boundary cycle'', denoted &lt;math&gt;\partial\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt;, which is an edge-path in the graph ''Γ'' corresponding to going around &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt; once in the clockwise direction along the boundary of the unbounded complementary region of ''Γ'', starting and ending at the base-vertex of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt;. The label of that boundary cycle is a word ''w'' in the alphabet ''A''&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; (which is not necessarily freely reduced) that is called the ''boundary label'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt;.

===Further terminology===

*A van Kampen diagram &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''disk diagram'' if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt; is a topological disk, that is, when every edge of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt; is a boundary edge of some region of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt; and when &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt; has no cut-vertices.
*A van Kampen diagram &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt; is called ''non-reduced'' if there exists a ''reduction pair'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt;, that is a pair of distinct regions of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt; such that their boundary cycles share a common edge and such that their boundary cycles, read starting from that edge, clockwise for one of the regions and counter-clockwise for the other, are equal as words in ''A''&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;. If no such pair of region exists,  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt; is called ''reduced''.
*The number of regions (two-cells) of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''area'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt; denoted &lt;math&gt;{\rm Area}(\mathcal D)\,&lt;/math&gt;.

In general, a van Kampen diagram has a "cactus-like" structure where one or more disk-components joined by (possibly degenerate) arcs, see the figure below:

[[File:Generalized van Kampen diagram.jpg|General form of a van Kampen diagram]]

==Example==

The following figure shows an example of a van Kampen diagram for the free abelian group of rank two
:&lt;math&gt;G=\langle a, b| ab a^{-1}b^{-1}\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Abelian.jpg|270px|Example of a van Kampen diagram]]

The boundary label of this diagram is the word
:&lt;math&gt;w=b^{-1}b^3a^{-1}b^{-2}ab^{-1}ba^{-1}ab^{-1}ba^{-1}a.&lt;/math&gt;
The area of this diagram is equal to 8.

==van Kampen lemma==

A key basic result in the theory is the so-called ''van Kampen lemma''&lt;ref name="LS"/&gt; which states the following:

#Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt; be a van Kampen diagram over the presentation (†) with boundary label ''w'' which is a word (not necessarily freely reduced) in the alphabet ''A''&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Then ''w''=1 in ''G''. 
#Let ''w'' be a freely reduced word in the alphabet ''A''&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; such that ''w''=1 in ''G''. Then there exists a reduced van Kampen diagram &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt; over the presentation (†) whose boundary label is freely reduced and is equal to ''w''.

===Sketch of the proof===

First observe that for an element ''w''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''F''(''A'') we have ''w''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 in ''G'' if and only if ''w'' belongs to the [[Normal closure (group theory)|normal closure]] of ''R'' in ''F''(''A'') that is, if and only if w can be represented as

:&lt;math&gt;w=u_1s_1u_1^{-1}\cdots u_n s_nu_{n}^{-1}  \text{ in } F(A),&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(♠)

where ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 and where ''s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt; for ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''.

Part 1 of van Kampen's lemma is proved by induction on the area of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt;. The inductive step consists in "peeling" off one of the boundary regions of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt; to get a van Kampen diagram &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D'\,&lt;/math&gt; with boundary cycle ''w''' and observing that in ''F''(''A'') we have 
:&lt;math&gt;w=usu^{-1} w',\,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''s''∈''R''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt; is the boundary cycle of the region that was removed to get &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D'\,&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The proof of part 2 of van Kampen's lemma is more involved. First, it is easy to see that if ''w'' is freely reduced and ''w''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 in ''G'' there exists some van Kampen diagram &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D_0\,&lt;/math&gt; with boundary label ''w''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''w''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''w''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in ''F''(''A'') (after possibly freely reducing ''w''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;). Namely consider a representation of ''w'' of the form (♠) above. Then make &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D_0\,&lt;/math&gt; to be a wedge of ''n'' "lollipops" with "stems" labeled by ''u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and with the "candys" (2-cells) labelled by ''s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. Then the boundary label of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D_0\,&lt;/math&gt; is a word ''w''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''w''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''w''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in ''F''(''A''). However, it is possible that the word ''w''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is not freely reduced. One then starts performing "folding" moves to get a sequence of van Kampen diagrams &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D_0, \mathcal D_1, \mathcal D_2,\dots\,&lt;/math&gt; by making their boundary labels more and more freely reduced and making sure that at each step the boundary label of each diagram in the sequence is equal to ''w'' in ''F''(''A'').  The sequence terminates in a finite number of steps with a van Kampen diagram &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D_k\,&lt;/math&gt; whose boundary label is freely reduced and thus equal to ''w'' as a word.  The diagram &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D_k\,&lt;/math&gt; may not be reduced. If that happens, we can remove the reduction pairs from this diagram by a simple surgery operation without affecting the boundary label. Eventually this produces a reduced van Kampen diagram &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt; whose boundary cycle is freely reduced and equal to ''w''.

===Strengthened version of van Kampen's lemma===
Moreover, the above proof shows that the conclusion of van Kampen's lemma can be strengthened as follows.&lt;ref name="LS"/&gt; Part 1 can be strengthened to say that if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt; is a van Kampen diagram of area ''n'' with boundary label ''w'' then there exists a representation (♠) for ''w'' as a product in ''F''(''A'') of exactly ''n'' conjugates of elements of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;.  Part 2 can be strengthened to say that if ''w'' is freely reduced and admits a representation (♠) as a product in ''F''(''A'') of ''n'' conjugates of elements of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt; then there exists a reduced van Kampen diagram with boundary label ''w'' and of area ''at most'' ''n''.

==Dehn functions and isoperimetric functions==
{{main|Dehn function}}

===Area of a word representing the identity===
Let ''w''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''F''(''A'') be such that ''w''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 in ''G''. Then the ''area'' of ''w'', denoted Area(''w''), is defined as the minimum of the areas of all van Kampen diagrams with boundary labels ''w'' (van Kampen's lemma says that at least one such diagram exists).

One can show that the area of ''w'' can be equivalently defined as the smallest ''n''≥0 such that there exists a representation (♠) expressing ''w'' as a product in ''F''(''A'') of ''n'' conjugates of the defining relators.

===Isoperimetric functions and Dehn functions===

A nonnegative [[monotone function|monotone nondecreasing]] function ''f''(''n'') is said to be an ''isoperimetric function'' for presentation (†)  if for every freely reduced word ''w'' such that ''w''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 in ''G'' we have

:&lt;math&gt;{\rm Area}(w)\le f(|w|),&lt;/math&gt;

where |''w''| is the length of the word ''w''.

Suppose now that the alphabet ''A'' in (†) is finite.
Then the ''Dehn function'' of (†) is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;{\rm Dehn}(n)=\max\{{\rm Area}(w): w=1 \text{ in } G, |w|\le n, w \text{ freely reduced}.\} &lt;/math&gt;

It is easy to see that Dehn(''n'') is an isoperimetric function for (†) and, moreover, if ''f''(''n'') is any other isoperimetric function for (†) then Dehn(''n'')&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''f''(''n'') for every ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0.

Let ''w''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''F''(''A'') be a freely reduced word such that ''w''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 in ''G''. A van Kampen diagram &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D\,&lt;/math&gt; with boundary label ''w'' is called ''minimal'' if &lt;math&gt;{\rm Area}(\mathcal D)={\rm Area}(w).&lt;/math&gt;  Minimal van Kampen diagrams are discrete analogues of [[minimal surface]]s in [[Riemannian geometry]].

==Generalizations and other applications==

*There are several generalizations of van-Kampen diagrams where instead of being planar, connected and simply connected (which means being [[homotopy equivalence|homotopically equivalent]] to a disk) the diagram is drawn on or [[homotopy equivalence|homotopically equivalent]] to some other surface. It turns out, that there is a close connection between the geometry of the surface and certain  group theoretical notions. A particularly important one of these  is the notion of an ''annular van Kampen diagram'', which  is [[homotopy equivalence|homotopically equivalent]] to an [[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]]. Annular diagrams, also known as ''conjugacy diagrams'', can be used to represent [[conjugacy class|conjugacy]] in groups given by [[group presentation]]s.&lt;ref name="LS"/&gt;  Also ''spherical van Kampen diagrams'' are related to  several versions of group-theoretic [[Aspherical space|asphericity]] and to [[Whitehead conjecture|Whitehead's asphericity conjecture]],&lt;ref&gt;Ian M. Chiswell, Donald J. Collins, and Johannes Huebschmann. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/rx371t3406887116/ ''Aspherical group presentations.''] Mathematische Zeitschrift, vol. 178 (1981), no. 1, pp. 1&amp;ndash;36.&lt;/ref&gt; Van Kampen diagrams on the torus are related to commuting elements, diagrams on the real projective plane are related to involutions in the group and diagrams on [[Klein's bottle]] are related to elements that are conjugated to their own inverse.
*Van Kampen diagrams are central objects in the [[small cancellation theory]] developed by Greendlinger, Lyndon and Schupp in the 1960s-1970s.&lt;ref name="LS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Greendlinger. [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/113397463/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 ''Dehn's algorithm for the word problem.''] Communications in Pure and Applied Mathematics, vol. 13 (1960), pp. 67&amp;ndash;83.&lt;/ref&gt; Small cancellation theory deals with [[group presentation]]s where the defining relations have "small overlaps" with each other. This condition is reflected in the geometry of reduced van Kampen diagrams over small cancellation presentations, forcing certain kinds of non-positively curved or negatively cn curved behavior. This behavior yields useful information about algebraic and algorithmic properties of small cancellation groups, in particular regarding the word and the conjugacy problems. Small cancellation theory was one of the key precursors of [[geometric group theory]], that emerged as a distinct mathematical area in the late 1980s and it remains an important part of [[geometric group theory]].
*Van Kampen diagrams play a key role in the theory of [[word-hyperbolic group]]s introduced by [[Mikhail Gromov (mathematician)|Gromov]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;M. Gromov. ''Hyperbolic Groups''. Essays in Group Theory (G. M. Gersten, ed.), MSRI Publ. 8, 1987, pp. 75&amp;ndash;263; {{isbn|0-387-96618-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it turns out that a [[finitely presented group]] is [[word-hyperbolic group|word-hyperbolic]] if and only if it satisfies a linear isoperimetric inequality. Moreover, there is an ''isoperimetric gap'' in the possible spectrum of isomperimetric functions for finitely presented groups: for any [[finitely presented group]] either it is hyperbolic and satisfies a linear isoperimetric inequality or else the Dehn function is at least quadratic.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Coornaert, Thomas Delzant, Athanase Papadopoulos, ''Géométrie et théorie des groupes: les groupes hyperboliques de Gromov''. Lecture Notes in Mathematics, vol. 1441, [[Springer-Verlag]], Berlin, 1990. {{isbn|3-540-52977-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. H. Bowditch.

*The study of isoperimetric functions for finitely presented groups has become an important general theme in [[geometric group theory]] where substantial progress has occurred. Much work has gone into constructing groups with "fractional" Dehn functions (that is, with Dehn functions being polynomials of non-integer degree).&lt;ref&gt;M. R. Bridson, [http://www.ams.org/jams/1999-12-04/S0894-0347-99-00308-2/home.html ''Fractional isoperimetric inequalities and subgroup distortion.''] [[Journal of the American Mathematical Society]], vol. 12 (1999), no. 4, pp. 1103&amp;ndash;1118.&lt;/ref&gt; The work of [[Eliyahu Rips|Rips]], Ol'shanskii, Birget and Sapir&lt;ref&gt;M. Sapir, J.-C. Birget, E. Rips, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3597195 ''Isoperimetric and isodiametric functions of groups.'']  [[Annals of Mathematics]] (2), vol. 156 (2002), no. 2, pp. 345&amp;ndash;466.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.-C. Birget, Aleksandr Yur'evich Ol'shanskii, E. Rips, M. Sapir, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3597196 ''Isoperimetric functions of groups and computational complexity of the word problem.''] [[Annals of Mathematics]] (2), vol. 156 (2002), no. 2, pp. 467&amp;ndash;518.&lt;/ref&gt; explored the connections between Dehn functions and time complexity functions of [[Turing machine]]s and showed that an arbitrary "reasonable" time function can be realized (up to appropriate equivalence) as the Dehn function of some finitely presented group.
*Various stratified and relativized versions of van Kampen diagrams have been explored in the subject as well. In particular, a stratified version of small cancellation theory, developed by Ol'shanskii, resulted in constructions of various group-theoretic "monsters", such as the [[Tarski Monster]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Ol'sanskii | first=A. Yu. | year=1979 | script-title=ru:Бесконечные группы с циклическими подгруппами |trans-title=Infinite groups with cyclic subgroups | language=Russian | journal=[[Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR]] | volume=245 | issue=4 | pages=785&amp;ndash;787}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and in geometric solutions of the [[Burnside problem]] for periodic groups of large exponent.&lt;ref&gt;A. Yu. Ol'shanskii.
