      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13027">'''Agricultural biotechnology''', also known as '''agritech''', is an area of [[agricultural science]] involving the use of scientific tools and techniques, including [[genetic engineering]], [[molecular markers]], [[molecular diagnostics]], [[vaccines]], and [[tissue culture]], to modify living organisms: plants, animals, and [[microorganisms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://absp2.cornell.edu/resources/briefs/documents/warp_briefs_eng_scr.pdf | title=What is Agricultural Biotechnology? | publisher=Cornell University | accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Crop biotechnology is one aspect of agricultural biotechnology which has been greatly developed upon in recent times. Desired trait are exported from a particular species of Crop to an entirely different species. These [[transgene]] crops possess desirable characteristics in terms of flavor, color of flowers, growth rate, size of harvested products and resistance to diseases and pests.

== History ==
Farmers have manipulated plants and animals through selective breeding for tens of thousands of years in order to create desired traits. In the 20th century, a surge in technology resulted in an increase in agricultural biotechnology through the selection of traits like increased yield, pest resistance, [[drought resistance]], and herbicide resistance. The first food product produced through [[biotechnology]] was sold in 1990, and by 2003, 7 million farmers were utilizing biotech crops. More than 85% of these farmers were located in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://absp2.cornell.edu/resources/briefs/documents/warp_briefs_eng_scr.pdf|title=Agricultural Biotechnology|last=|first=|date=2004|website=cornell.edu|publisher=PBS, ABSP II, US Agency for International Development|access-date=1 Dec 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crop modification techniques ==

=== Traditional breeding ===
Traditional [[crossbreeding]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.biofortified.org/portfolio/infographic-crop-modification-techniques/|title=Infographic: Crop Modification Techniques - Biology Fortified, Inc.|newspaper=Biology Fortified, Inc.|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been used for centuries to improve crop quality and quantity. Crossbreeding mates two sexually compatible species to create a new variety with the desired traits of the parents. For example, the [[honeycrisp apple]] exhibits a specific texture and flavor due to the crossbreeding of its parents.  In traditional practices, pollen from one plant is placed on the female part of another, which leads to a hybrid that contains genetic information from both parent plants. Plant breeders select the plants with the traits they're looking to pass on and continue to breed those plants. Note that crossbreeding can only be utilized within the same or closely related species.

=== Mutagenesis ===
[[Mutation]]s can occur randomly in the [[DNA]] of any organism. In order to create variety within crops, scientists can randomly induce mutations within plants. [[Mutation breeding|Mutagenesis]] uses radioactivity to induce random mutations in the hopes of stumbling upon the desired trait. Scientists can use [[mutagen|mutating chemical]]s such as [[ethyl methanesulfonate]], or radioactivity to create random mutations within the DNA. [[Atomic gardening|Atomic gardens]] are used to mutate crops. A radioactive core is located in the center of a circular garden and raised out of the ground to radiate the surrounding crops, generating mutations within a certain radius. Mutagenesis through radiation was the process used to produce [[ruby red grapefruit]]s.

=== Polyploidy ===
[[Polyploidy]] can be induced to modify the number of chromosomes in a crop in order to influence its fertility or size. Usually, organisms have two sets of [[chromosome]]s, otherwise known as a [[diploidy]]. However, either naturally or through the use of chemicals, that number of chromosomes can change, resulting in fertility changes or size modification within the crop. Seedless watermelons are created in this manner; a 4-set chromosome watermelon is crossed with a 2-set chromosome watermelon to create a [[Seedless fruit|sterile (seedless) watermelon]] with three sets of chromosomes.

=== Protoplast fusion ===
[[Protoplast fusion]] is the joining of cells or cell components to transfer traits between species.  For example, the trait of male sterility is transferred from radishes to red cabbages by protoplast fusion. This male sterility helps plant breeders make hybrid crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Beuckeleer|first=Mariani|last2=De Beuckeleer|first2=Celestina|last3=De Beuckeleer|first3=Marc|last4=Truettner|first4=Jessie|last5=Leemans|first5=Jan|last6=Goldberg|first6=Robert|year=1990|title=Induction of Male Sterility in Plants by a Chimaeric Ribonuclease Gene.|url=|journal=Nature|volume=437.6295|pages=737–41|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== RNA interference ===
[[RNA interference]] (RNAIi) is the process in which a cell's [[RNA]] to protein mechanism is turned down or off in order to suppress genes. This method of genetic modification works by interfering with messenger RNA to stop the synthesis of proteins, effectively silencing a gene.

=== Transgenics ===
[[Transgenics]] involves the insertion of one piece of DNA into another organism's DNA in order to introduce a new gene(s) into the original organism. This addition of genes into an organism's genetic material creates a new variety with desired traits.  The DNA must be prepared and packaged in a test tube and then inserted into the new organism. New genetic information can be inserted with [[biolistics]]. An example of transgenics is the rainbow papaya, which is modified with a gene that gives it resistance to the [[papaya ringspot virus]].

=== Genome editing ===
[[Genome editing]] is the use of an enzyme system to modify the DNA directly within the cell. Genome editing was used to develop herbicide resistant canola to help farmers control weeds.

== Improved nutritional content ==
Agricultural biotechnology has been used to improve the nutritional content of a variety of crops in an effort to meet the needs of an increasing population.  Genetic engineering can produce crops with a higher concentration of vitamins. For example, [[golden rice]] contains three genes that allow plants to produce compounds that are converted to [[vitamin A]] in the human body. This nutritionally improved rice is designed to combat the world's leading cause of blindness—[[vitamin A deficiency]]. Similarly, the Banana 21 project&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.banana21.org/about.html|title=About Banana21|website=www.banana21.org|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; has worked to improve the nutrition in bananas to combat [[micronutrient deficiencies]] in Uganda. By genetically modifying bananas to contain vitamin A and iron, Banana 21 has helped foster a solution to micronutrient deficiencies through the vessel of a staple food and major starch source in Africa. Additionally, crops can be engineered to reduce toxicity or to produce varieties with removed [[allergen]]s.

== Genes and traits of interest for crops ==

=== Agronomic traits ===

==== Insect resistance ====

One highly sought after trait is [[pest resistance|insect resistance]]. This trait increases a crop's resistance to bugs and allows for a higher yield. These genetically engineered crops can now produce their own Bt (''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]''), which contains toxin-producing proteins that are non-harmful to humans. [[Bt corn]] and cotton are now commonplace, and cowpeas, sunflower, soybeans, tomatoes, tobacco, walnut, sugar cane, and rice are all being studied in relation to Bt.

==== Herbicide tolerance ====

Weeds have proven to be an issue for farmers for thousands of years; they compete for soil nutrients, water, and sunlight and prove deadly to crops. Biotechnology has offered a solution in the form of herbicide tolerance. Chemical herbicides are sprayed directly on plants in order to kill weeds and therefore competition, and [[herbicide resistant]] crops have to the opportunity to flourish.

==== Disease resistance ====

Often, crops are afflicted by disease spread through insects (like [[aphid]]s). Spreading disease among crop plants is incredibly difficult to control and was previously only managed by completely removing the affected crop. The field of agricultural biotechnology offers a solution through genetically engineering virus resistance. Developing GE disease-resistant crops now include [[cassava]], [[maize]], and [[sweet potato]].

==== Temperature tolerance ====

Agricultural biotechnology can also provide a solution for plants in extreme temperature conditions. In order to maximize yield and prevent crop death, genes can be engineered that help to regulate cold and heat tolerance. For example, papaya trees have been genetically modified in order to be more tolerant of hot and cold conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Figueroa-Yañez|first=Luis|last2=Pereira-Santana|first2=Alejandro|last3=Arroyo-Herrera|first3=Ana|last4=Rodriguez-Corona|first4=Ulises|last5=Sanchez-Teyer|first5=Felipe|last6=Espadas-Alcocer|first6=Jorge|last7=Espadas-Gil|first7=Francisco|last8=Barredo-Pool|first8=Felipe|last9=Castaño|first9=Enrique|date=2016-10-20|title=RAP2.4a Is Transported through the Phloem to Regulate Cold and Heat Tolerance in Papaya Tree (Carica papaya cv. Maradol): Implications for Protection Against Abiotic Stress|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0165030|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=10|pages=e0165030|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0165030|issn=1932-6203|pmc=5072549|pmid=27764197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other traits include water use efficiency, nitrogen use efficiency and salt tolerance.

=== Quality traits ===
Quality traits include increased nutritional or dietary value, improved food processing and storage, or the elimination of toxins and allergens in crop plants.

== Common GMO crops ==
Currently, only a small number of [[genetically modified crops]] are available for purchase and consumption in the United States. The USDA has approved soybeans, corn, canola, sugar beets, papaya, squash, alfalfa, cotton, apples, and potatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mvgs.iaea.org/|title=MVD|website=mvgs.iaea.org|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; GMO apples ([[arctic apples]]) are non-browning apples and eliminate the need for anti-browning treatments, reduce food waste, and bring out flavor. The production of Bt cotton has skyrocketed in India, with 10 million hectares planted for the first time in 2011, resulting in a 50% insecticide application reduction. In 2014, Indian and Chinese farmers planted more than 15 million hectares of Bt cotton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org|title=International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications - ISAAA.org|website=www.isaaa.org|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety testing and government regulations ==
Agricultural biotechnology regulation in the US falls under three main government agencies: The [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] (USDA), the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). The USDA must approve the release of any new GMOs, EPA controls the regulation of insecticide, and the FDA evaluates the safety of a particular crop sent to market. On average, it takes nearly 13 years and $130 million of research and development for a [[genetically modified organism]] to come to market. The regulation process takes up to 8 years in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gmo.geneticliteracyproject.org/FAQ/what-does-it-take-to-bring-a-new-gm-product-to-market/|title=What does it take to bring a new GM product to market? #GMOFAQ|newspaper=GMO FAQ|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The safety of GMOs has become a topic of debate worldwide, but scientific articles are being conducted to test the safety of consuming GMOs in addition to the FDA's work. In one such article, it was concluded that Bt rice did not adversely affect digestion and did not induce horizontal gene transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Kai|last2=Ren|first2=Fangfang|last3=Han|first3=Fangting|last4=Liu|first4=Qiwen|last5=Wu|first5=Guogan|last6=Xu|first6=Yan|last7=Zhang|first7=Jian|last8=Wu|first8=Xiao|last9=Wang|first9=Jinbin|date=2016-10-05|title=Edible Safety Assessment of Genetically Modified Rice T1C-1 for Sprague Dawley Rats through Horizontal Gene Transfer, Allergenicity and Intestinal Microbiota|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0163352|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=10|pages=e0163352|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0163352|issn=1932-6203|pmc=5051820|pmid=27706188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bertha Mkhize''' (6 June 1889 – 3 October 1981) was a South African teacher, who gained legal emancipation as a ''[[feme sole]]'' operating a business in her own right. As the government began implementing [[Apartheid]] in the late 1940s and early 1950s, she joined labor unions and women's organizations, leading demonstrations against the policies of the government. She was arrested twice for these activities and charged in the second incident with treason, but found not guilty of the allegations. When she was forced to give up her business, she became a [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneer]] in the [[Bahá'í Faith]], embracing its doctrine of equality for all people. She worked to establish twenty-eight Bahá'í communities in [[KwaZulu-Natal]].

==Early life==
Nhlumba Bertha Mkhize was born on 6 June 1889 in Embo, near [[Umkomaas]] in the southern province of [[KwaZulu-Natal]], South Africa to Mashobane Mkhize, an oxcart driver.{{sfn|''The Bahá'í World''|1986|p=773}}{{sfn|South African History Online|17 February 2011}} Around the age of four, Mkhize's father died and the family relocated to [[Inanda, KwaZulu-Natal|Inanda]], where she enrolled in the [[Inanda Seminary School]]. She was one of the first students of the all-girls school. After completion of her studies at the seminary, she went on to graduate from [[Ohlange High School]].{{sfn|South African History Online|17 February 2011}}{{sfn|Mnyandu|2010|p=3}}

==Career==
In 1907, Mkhize began teaching at Inanda Seminary and remained there for the next four years. While she was teaching, she took [[Tailor|tailoring]] classes to learn the skill.{{sfn|Mnyandu|2010|p=3}} In 1909, she was legally [[emancipated]]. The process required her to appear before a magistrate with a signed document from her guardians granting her the right to conduct her affairs without her male family members' approval. This was an unusual procedure for Zulu women at the time and gave her the right to [[kraal|homestead]] or open her own business.{{sfn|''The Bahá'í World''|1986|p=773}} In 1911, she left the teaching profession{{sfn|Mnyandu|2010|p=3}} and moved to [[Durban]] where she went into tailoring with her brother.{{sfn|South African History Online|17 February 2011}} She continued with her interest in literacy, working in a children's center for twenty-five years. She also spoke out against oppressive measures used to undermine people's rights, like [[culling]] their cattle or forcing them and their owners to be [[Plunge dip|plunged in pesticide]] under the guise of controlling [[typhus]].{{sfn|''The Bahá'í World''|1986|p=773}}

At its organization, Mkhize joined the [[African National Congress Women's League]] (ANCWL) and became involved in women's rights issues, participating in marches in 1931 and 1936 against requirements for women to have travel passes. She also joined the [[Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union]], campaigning against curfews, low wages, and other working restrictions.{{sfn|South African History Online|17 February 2011}} In the early 1950s a series of restrictive laws were passed by the [[Apartheid legislation|Apartheid legislature]] which required women to vacate urban areas within 72 hours or live with a man who had a permanent permit of residence. As early as 1950, protests of the new laws which curtailed free movement were held in urban areas throughout the country. Mkhize led the demonstrations in Durban in March 1950.{{sfn|South African History Online|30 March 2011}} In 1952, she joined around 500 other women to march on the Durban City Council. Known as the [[Defiance Campaign]], at issue was a law that required women to obtain permission to travel. Mkhize spoke in favor of retracting the restriction,{{sfn|South African History Online|17 February 2011}}{{#tag:ref|The source states that the Defiance Campaign happened in 1925,{{sfn|South African History Online|17 February 2011}} but this is clearly a typographical error as numerous other sources indicate the campaign originated in June, 1952.{{sfn|South African History Online|30 March 2011}}{{sfn|Mandela|1990|p=34}}{{sfn|''Newport Daily News''|1952|p=1}}|group="Notes"}} and for her defiance spent several months in prison.{{sfn|''The Bahá'í World''|1986|p=773}}{{sfn|Mnyandu|2010|p=3}}

Because the women were successful in exerting pressure on the government, Mkhize and others recognized that further organization would further their cause. To that end, they created the [[Federation of South African Women]] (FEDSAW). She was one of the women who attended the founding conference in 1954 and was selected as one of the national vice presidents{{sfn|South African History Online|17 February 2011}} along with [[Florence Matomela]], [[Lillian Ngoyi]], and Gladys Smith. They drafted Women's Charter, which called for universal [[enfranchisement]] regardless of race, and equal opportunity in the areas of civil liberties, domestic rights, employment and pay.{{sfn|South African History Online|30 March 2011}} Two years later, Mkhize had become President of ANCWL,{{sfn|South African History Online|17 February 2011}} which held a mass demonstration in August 1956 to show the strength of women's opposition to a new implementation of women's pass laws. Along with other leaders of the women's movement, Mkhize was arrested for treason in the middle of the night in December 1956. The women, which included other activists like [[Frances Baard]], [[Helen Joseph]], Lillian Ngoyi, and [[Annie Silinga]] were accused of plotting to overthrow the government. The trial lasted for four and a half years, resulting in not guilty verdicts for all 156 women arrested on that night raid.{{sfn|South African History Online|30 March 2011}} 

In 1958, Mkhize was introduced to the [[Bahá'í Faith]] and joined the organization on 1 January 1959. The message of unity for all people was in line with her own convictions and she became active in the church.{{sfn|''The Bahá'í World''|1986|p=773}} She had continued running her business in Durban, but in 1965 the Durban City Council forced the closure of all African businesses and removed their owners of the area.{{sfn|South African History Online|17 February 2011}} She worked actively in Natal and [[Zululand District Municipality|Zululand]] for five years on behalf of the Bahá'í Faith and then settled in Gezinsila in [[Eshowe]] as a [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneer]]. Along with other Bahá'í teachers, Mkhize was responsible for founding twenty-eight congregations in the area. In 1968, she was elected to serve as a delegate to the [[Bahá'í Faith in South Africa|National Spiritual Assembly of South and West Africa]] and served for one year. She translated many texts of the faith into [[Zulu language|Zulu]]. After nine years, her health began to fail in 1975, but she remained in her post until 1978, when she bequeathed her home to the faith and returned to Inanda.{{sfn|''The Bahá'í World''|1986|pp=773–774}}{{sfn|Mnyandu|2010|p=3}}

==Death and legacy==
Mkhize died on 3 October 1981 in Inanda and is remembered for her pioneering role in women's rights. A street in Durban was renamed in her honor in 2010.{{sfn|Mnyandu|2010|p=3}} A life-sized sculpture of Mkhize created by Cristina Salvoldi was installed at the [[National Heritage Monument]] in [[Tshwane]] near [[Johannesburg]] in 2017.{{sfn|National Heritage Project|2017}}

'''Chang Dae-whan''' (also known as Chang Dae-Hwan, born 21 March 1952) is a [[South Korea]]n businessman.&lt;ref name="ChosunFocus"&gt;{{citation|url=http://focus.chosun.com/people/peopleView.jsp?id=750|title=장대환|periodical=[[Chosun Ilbo]]|accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known as the president of the ''[[Maeil Business Newspaper]]'', [[South Korea]]'s main business daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Knowledge management in the digital newsroom|first=Stephen|last=Quinn|pages=173–174|year=2002|publisher=Focal Press|isbn= 978-0-240-51677-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the founder of the ''[[World Knowledge Forum]]''. The World Knowledge Forum is the largest forum of its kind in Asia. He also served a brief stint as South Korea's acting [[Prime Minister of South Korea|prime minister]] in August 2002 under [[President of South Korea|president]] [[Kim Dae-jung]], but the [[National Assembly of South Korea|National Assembly]] voted not to confirm him.&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{citation|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/aug/29/world/fg-briefs29.4|periodical=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2002-08-29|accessdate=2010-07-09|title=Second Recent Choice for Premier Rejected}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Chang obtained a bachelor's degree in politics at the [[University of Rochester]] in 1973. He also received a diploma for the Study of EC (European Community) in Belgium in June 1974, and went on to do an M.A. in international affairs at [[George Washington University]]'s [[Elliott School of International Affairs]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} Afterwards, Chang received his M.A. and Ph.D. in economics and management from [[New York University]], where he wrote his 1987 doctoral dissertation on South Korean construction firms in the Middle East.&lt;ref name="ChosunFocus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Performance of the Korea-based construction firms in the Middle East|last=Chang|first=Tae-hwan|year=1987|publisher=New York University|series=Ph.D. dissertation|oclc=26335012}}; see also [[Koreans in the Arab world]]&lt;/ref&gt; He serves as the president of the South Korean branch of the NYU alumni association.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://article.joins.com/article/article.asp?ctg=12&amp;Total_ID=3925854|periodical=[[JoongAng Ilbo]]|date=2009-12-16|accessdate=2010-07-09|title=강만수 특보 자랑스런 NYU동문상 수상 {{bracket|Gang Man-su receives NYU alumni prize}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chang started his newspaper career as a manager of planning department at Maeil Business Newspaper on 1 January 1986. He then rose to the position of director, managing director, and executive director successively, finally becoming the president and publisher in 1988.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Chang is a Commissioner for the Global Commission on Internet Governance.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ourinternet.org/#commission&lt;/ref&gt;

==As prime minister==
Chang was named as South Korea's acting PM on 9 August 2002, after the National Assembly declined to confirm his predecessor [[Chang Sang]]. The nomination was a surprise to fellow top-level civil servants in their 60s, as Chang was just 50 years old at the time, and had no experience in government.&lt;ref name="Chosun20020809"&gt;{{citation|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2002/08/09/2002080961002.html|periodical=[[Chosun Ilbo]]|date=2002-08-09|accessdate=2010-07-09|title=Chang Dae-hwan Named as Acting PM|last=Kim|first=Min-bai}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If appointed, he would have been the wealthiest member of the cabinet, with [[South Korean won|₩]]5.6 billion in family assets, according to his self-report.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2002/08/14/2002081461006.html|title=PM-Designate's Private Assets Amount to W5.6 Billion|date=2002-08-14|accessdate=2010-07-09|periodical=[[Chosun Ilbo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during his confirmation hearings, [[Grand National Party]] (GNP) members including [[Hong Joon-pyo]] and [[Ahn Kyung-ryul]] expressed their opposition.&lt;ref name="Chosun20020823"&gt;{{citation|title=PMs Confirmation Hearing Hits Problems|periodical=[[Chosun Ilbo]]|accessdate=2010-07-09|date=2002-08-23|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2002/08/23/2002082361016.html|last=Cho|first=Hee-chun}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2002/08/27/2002082761023.html|date=2002-08-27|accessdate=2010-07-09|periodical=[[Chosun Ilbo]]|title=Confirmation Vote Set for Wednesday|last=Kim|first=Chang-kyun}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chang himself also acknowledged in a press conference that he had falsely registered himself as living in [[Seoul]]'s [[Gangnam-gu]] to enroll his son in a better school.&lt;ref name="Chosun20020823"/&gt; In the end he was rejected by a vote of 151-112.&lt;ref name="LATimes"/&gt;

Knoeppel was born in [[Milwaukee]], Wisconsin as son of John C. Knoeppel, a practical [[Molding (process)|molder]] and [[foundry]]man,&lt;ref&gt;John C. Knoeppel. "The Continuous Operation of the Iron Foundry." Review in: ''[[Industrial Management: The Engineering Magazine]],'' [[John R. Dunlap]] ed. 1903. p. 778&lt;/ref&gt; who had received some patents in 1878,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US200921 Improvement in shutter-fastenings, US 200921 A] by J.C. Knoeppel, 1878.&lt;/ref&gt; 1881,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/patents/US246015 Furnace grate-bar, US 246015 A] by J.C. Knoeppel, 1881.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/scientific-american-1881-09-24/scientific-american-v45-n13-1881-09-24#page/n12/mode/1up/search/Knoeppel Index of inventions] in ''Scientific American,'' 1881-09-24&lt;/ref&gt; and later on in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/patents/US875825 Furnace, US 875825 A], by J.C. Knoeppel, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], New York, where he attended school. Financially unable to continue college, he started to work.&lt;ref name="MW 2005"/&gt;

Knoeppel was [[journalist]] for a short while, before he started working his way up in an [[ironworks]] from laborer to draughtsman and designer to manager in 1904 at the age of 23. The next years he started working as consultant in factories apply the idea's [[scientific management]]. In 1909 he started working in the consultancy firm of [[Harrington Emerson]], and in 1914 he founded his own consultancy firm in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="MW 2002"&gt;Witzel, Morgen. "[http://www.lbs.staging.mosaic-digital.com/files/1402/1467-8616.00232.pdf A short history of efficiency]." ''Business Strategy Review'' 13.4 (2002): 38-47.&lt;/ref&gt; named C. E. Knoeppel &amp; Co., Inc.

Knoeppel had adopted the ideal of efficiency, as developed by [[Harrington Emerson]] and others and developed the concept in far more details.&lt;ref name="MW 2002"/&gt; Around 1905 Knoeppel had started writing a series of articles on efficiency methods, management, organization and administration, and graphic [[production control]] in the ''[[Engineering Magazine]]'', and later a series of books, which were all published by the Engineering Magazine Company in New York. In 1933 Knoeppel authored the book ''Profit Engineering'' to which [[E. St. Elmo Lewis]] contributed the chapter "Securing Sales Called for by Profitgraph".

Knoeppel died on 29 November 1936 in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, USA, just as his last book ''Managing for profit'' went on the press.&lt;ref&gt;Knoeppel &amp; Seybold (1937, p. xii&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
=== ''Maximum Production Through Organization and Supervision,'' 1908 ===
Under the title "Maximum Production Through Organization and Supervision" Knoeppel published a series of four articles in the ''[[Engineering Magazine]]'' discussing the adjustment of organizations in the [[factory]] so that the utmost working efficiency may be secured. The editors introduced this article as follows:
:''The article following is first of a group of four developing the possibilities of farsighted and ''fore-sighted'' control of a manufacturing business so that it may be operated at a minimum of friction and a maximum of productiveness and profit. The first of the series in concerned chiefly with the adjustment of the internal organization to the utmost working efficiency. The following parts will take up successively systematic processing, machining, assembling and erection; the insuring of economy in the use of material and time; and the methods which secure better deliveries and more satisfied customers. - The editors''&lt;ref&gt;[[John Robertson Dunlap]], [[John Michael Carmody]] (1908). [https://archive.org/stream/factoryindustria35newy#page/82/mode/2up/search/Knoeppel Editorial introduction] to "Maximum Production Through Organization and Supervision" in ''Engineering Magazine.'' Vol. 35. p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Principles of organization,'' 1908 ===
In the first article of "Maximum Production Through Organization and Supervision" (1908) Knoeppel raised the subject of a universal application of the principles of organization: the segregation of authority.
[[File:A Chart of Working Authorities in a Manufacturing Business, 1910.jpg|thumb|A Chart of Working Authorities in a Manufacturing Business, 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith (1910, p. 19); Republished from Griffith (1909). ''Administrative and industrial organization.'' p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Chart of Working Authorities in a Trading Business, 1910.jpg|thumb|Chart of Working Authorities in a Trading Business, 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith (1910, p. 23)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
:''"While business as it is now conducted is not as simple as it was in the barter days, it must not be inferred that this segregation of authority is synonymous with complexity, for its very purpose has been to simplify, and that is what it has accomplished. It is only where this segregation has been the result of lack of thought and proper attention, or other like causes, that we find a complex and unsatisfactory condition of affairs. In fact, there is all about us sufficient evidence that many commercial enterprises are being conducted along lines that, as far as evolutional development is concerned, are several stages behind the times.''&lt;ref name="Kn 1908 p. 85-86"&gt;Knoeppel (1908, p. 85-86); Cited in: [[James Bray Griffith]] (ed.), American School of Correspondence. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46424 Cyclopedia of Commerce, Accountancy, Business Administration...: Organization; sales; credits; statistics.]'' Vol. 1. 1910. p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore Knoeppel illustrates the principle of segregation needed in the modern factory, by tracing the circumstances of a modern founder of business:
:''"Let us suppose a case, which will apply in a greater or less degree to the majority. In the earlier development, we will say that the founder of the business was able, on account of its small size, to make what sketches he needed, solicit orders, see that they were filled, perhaps take a hand at the making if occasion required, see to the shipments, and attend to the collections and the keeping of his few accounts. He finds that the business grows, and eventually places a man in charge of certain branches while he looks after others. The accounts eventually require more attention than he can give them so he engages a bookkeeper in order that he may be relieved of the work. He finds that the quantity of materials received and shipped amount to enough to warrant a receiving clerk as well as a shipping clerk, and, to handle this material from its inception to shipment he conceives the idea of placing a man in charge as stock clerk. He then adds a purchasing agent, in order that he may be relieved of the detail and that purchases may be made most economically; a man is placed in charge of the orders; foremen are placed in charge of certain men in the shops; the details connected with making plans, drawings, estimates, etc., are taken over by a practical man; his manager is given a man to look after the shops or engineering branch; while the commercial branch with its many details is placed in the hands of another. As the evolution continues, the selling branch is assumed by one man; cost details are looked after by another; a chief inspector is added in order that all work may be shipped according to specifications; the engineer, who before had been a sort of jack of all trades, is placed in charge of certain work, while an electrician is engaged to look after this particular work; and so this segregation continues as the development continues.''
:''"Perhaps it is not to be wondered at that the founder, in looking backward, is inclined to pat himself on the back when, in a reminiscent mood, he considers what he terms 'remarkable development.' He considers that he has been wonderfully successful in building up a business which at the beginning was so small as to admit of his supervising every detail, while today he employs a dozen men to do the work he once did. There is no getting away from the fact that it is this same feeling of self-satisfaction that is responsible for a large number of faulty organizations, for if we should tell this manufacturer that his business is far from being as successful as it is possible for it to be ... he would vigorously resent any such accusation; but the fact remains that it is not the success it should be, for the very reason that the development has been allowed practically to take care of itself. New men were added, new offices created, only when absolutely necessary, each newcomer being given a general idea of what was expected of him, and not knowing, not thinking, or perhaps not having the time to give more than passing attention to the matter, the proprietor did not consider the fact that his business was a unit, with each worker a part, having a distinct relation with every other worker. Hence, as the efficiency of any organization is directly in proportion to the care with which these relations are considered and treated, his organization naturally fails to attain that degree of efficiency obtainable, and for this condition he, and he only is responsible."''&lt;ref name="Kn 1908 p. 85-86"/&gt;

[[James Bray Griffith]] in the ''Cyclopedia of Commerce, Accountancy, Business Administration'' (1910) argued, that "when we go into all of the ramifications of business we find many establishments where minor variations of our plan of organization appear necessary, but in the final analysis, the fundamentals prove to be the same."&lt;ref&gt;Griffith (1910, p. 22)&lt;/ref&gt; The working authorities in a manufacturing Business and in a trading Business follow a same scheme (see images).

=== Industrial preparedness ===
Knoeppel was a disciple of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]], who promoted to concept of  "industrial preparedness."&lt;ref&gt;David Montgomery (1989) ''The Fall of the House of Labor.'' p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; He for example stated:
:''"The chemist mixes a definite quantity of this and a definite amount of that, and he has what he knew would be the result of the combination of the elements.. The manufacturer mixes tons of this, feet of that, so many machines, some money, men, and knows absolutely nothing about the real outcome as regards cost and efficiency until the product is completed."''&lt;ref&gt;Knoeppel, C.E., &amp; co. (New York) ''Installing Efficiency Methods,'' 1915. p. 221; Cited in Sheldon (2003, p. 224)&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Sheldon (2003) this is "a revelation not only of lack of accurate and immediate knowledge, but also of lack of that type of mentality which can map out a course for its activities and proceed methodically to follow that course."&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Sheldon. ''The Philosophy of Management.'' 2003. p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; This could be solved by improving the so-called industrial preparedness.

'''Churn and burn''' refers to a tactic used by [[Wal-Mart|large anti-union businesses]] with high turnover in order to bust an already-existent [[labour union|union]] in a given workplace.  "Churning" refers to the management practice of filtering new workers based on their support of unionism.  In a large business with poorly paid, entry-level workers with a high rate of turnover, support for a union can be gradually reduced by making sure during the hiring process that only [[union busting|anti-union workers]] are hired.  Eventually, support drops low enough to "burn" the union through [[NLRB election procedures#Decertification_elections|decertification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chung|first=Andrew|title=Wal-Mart workers hope to show their union the door|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/950705--wal-mart-workers-hope-to-show-their-union-the-door|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=March 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Community management''' or '''common-pool resource management''' is the management of a [[the commons|common]] resource or issue by a [[community]] through the [[collective action]] of [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s and [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s.  The resource managed can be either material or [[information]]al. Examples include the management of common [[grazing rights|grazing]] and [[Water right|water]] rights;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://cje.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/2/95.extract |title=The management of common property resources |author=R Wade |journal=Cambridge Journal of Economics |year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[wild fisheries|fisheries]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Community management and common property of coastal fisheries in Asia and the Pacific |author=R. S. Pomeroy |year=1994 |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=bj_dEgl59CQC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[open source|open-source]] software.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/c229131m5v22271g/ |title=The governance of open source initiatives: what does it mean to be community managed? |author=SO'Mahony |journal=Journal of Management and Governance |year=2007}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of physical resources, community management strategies are frequently employed to avoid the [[tragedy of the commons]] and to encourage [[sustainability]].

{{see also|Tragedy of the commons}}
Without proper management, a community's material resources may be depleted or rendered unusable.&lt;ref&gt;Camille Antinori and Gustavo A. Garcia-Lopez ''[http://are.berkeley.edu/~antinori/AntGarV5.pdf Cross-Scale Linkages in Common-Pool Resource Management: The Evolution of Forest Associations in the Mexican Forest Commons]''. Prepared for the 12th IASC 2008 Biennial Conference, University of Gloucester, Cheltenham, England, U.K.&lt;/ref&gt; The '''common pool problem''' is an economic situation which exists when goods are rival, but non-exclusive (See [[common-pool resource]]). Since these resources are owned in common, individuals have no private incentive to preserve them, but rather will seek to exploit them before others can derive benefit. The classic example is of fish in the ocean; anybody can harvest fish, but a fish that has been caught cannot be caught by another fisherman. Therefore, fishermen will seek to maximize their personal profit by catching as many fish as possible, which will ultimately lead to the stock being depleted. It is similar to the [[free rider problem]] in that those who do not contribute to the resource may use it without penalty, but the common pool problem is usually considered an economic "problem" since it will eventually lead to the exhausting of a resource.&lt;ref&gt;Holahan, William L., Schug, Mark C.; ''Conservation of resources and the common pool problem''; Social Studies; Nov/Dec97, Vol. 88 Issue 6, p264, 4p, 1 chart; [http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=9712232994&amp;site=ehost-live]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Additional citation needed|date=February 2018}} Another example of the common pool problem involves the shared use of limited internet [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], such as in a [[university network]], when the connectivity of all users is slowed by the heavy usage of a few.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

[[Elinor Ostrom]] and [[Oliver E. Williamson]] won the 2009 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel prize in economic science]] for work in this area, where they suggested that with good community management of shared resources, as found in successful firms, the "tragedy of the commons" can be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Shared information resources==
{{unreferencedsect|date=February 2018}}
{{see also|Online community manager}}
Developing [[open source|open-source]] software or other [[collaborative]] projects such as [[Wikipedia]] generally require some form of community management, whether it involves [[leadership]] or [[egalitarianism]]. Unlike as is the case with physical resources, the sharing of information does not necessarily deplete the resource. Nonetheless, proper management may be necessary to encourage a [[network effect]], where collaborative use actually enriches the resource, and to avoid conflict.

More generally, community management designates the activity of maintaining communication, motivation, efficiency and engagement among a group of remote individuals often only linked together by the internet. Typically, it will contribute to the success of an open-source initiative by keeping forums alive with information, questions and challenges, by organizing real-life events for [[virtual communities]], or by organizing contests or [[hackathon]]s to focus all efforts on a common goal. All of these are great ways of getting to know the community members and get them engaged in a conversation so that the community continues to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kataria |first1=Saransh |title=25 lessons learnt from 2.5 years of scaling a Facebook Developer Community to 9000 members |url=https://www.wisdomgeek.com/community-management/lessons-learnt-from-scaling-facebook-developer-community/ |website=Wisdom Geek |publisher=Saransh Kataria |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be used to improve motivation and [[synergy]] in a large organisation (such as a company or a public organisation) by creating a sense of belonging and ensuring that members are aware of each other’s work. Community management requires human skills (a community manager) and the use of tools (e.g., social networks, instant messaging, resource sharing, etc.).

==Methods of management==
{{refimprovesect|date=February 2018}}
{{Expand section|date=September 2010}}
A community may itself be actively developed and managed in order to promote communal activity and welfare.

In some cases, the task of managing a physical resource may be delegated to a specialist professional called a community manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r_oMpWbiaX0C&amp;pg=PA1 |title=Community Associations: A Guide to Successful Management |author=Stephen R. Barber |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of internet resources, the privileging of certain kinds of data transfer may ensure a better overall [[quality of service]] for most users, as opposed to the doctrine of [[network neutrality]].

[[File:Ireland and Ulster, counties.svg|thumb|In 2018, Ireland was ranked by [[Gabriel Zucman|Zucman]] as the [[Corporate haven#Zucman Corporate tax havens|largest global]] corporate tax haven.  In 2016, Ireland's largest company, Apple, received the biggest corporate tax fine in history at [[EU illegal State aid case against Apple in Ireland|€13 billion]].  Ireland's IP-based [[Base erosion and profit shifting|BEPS]] tool, the [[Double Irish]], enabled the largest build-up of untaxed offshore cash in history, at $1 trillion. From 1982 to 2017, Ireland received the most U.S. [[Corporate inversion#Destinations|corporate inversion]]s.  U.S. controlled multinationals are 14 of Ireland's top 20 corporates, and pay 80% of Irish corporate tax (see [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Low tax economy|here]]).]]

A '''corporate haven''', '''corporate tax haven''', or '''multinational tax haven''', is a jurisdiction that multinational corporations find attractive for establishing subsidiaries or [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]] of regional or main company headquarters, mostly due to favourable tax regimes (not just the headline tax rate), and/or favourable secrecy laws (such as the avoidance of regulations or disclosure of tax schemes), and/or favourable regulatory regimes (such as weak data-protection or employment laws).

'''Modern corporate tax havens''' (such as Ireland, the Netherlands, and Singapore), differ from '''traditional corporate tax havens''' (such as Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and Jersey), in their ability to maintain OECD-compliance, while using OECD-whitelisted {{slink|#IP-based BEPS tools}} and {{slink|#Debt-based BEPS tools}}, which don't file public accounts, to still enable the corporate to avoid taxes, not just in the corporate haven, but in all operating countries that have [[Tax treaty|tax treaties]] with the haven.

While the "headline" corporate tax rate in corporate havens is always above zero (e.g. Netherlands at 25%, U.K. at 19%, Singapore at 17%, and Ireland at 12.5%), the [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Effective tax rate (ETR)|"effective"]] tax rate (ETR) of international corporations, net of the [[BEPS]] tools, is closer to zero.  Estimates of lost annual taxes to corporate havens range from $100 to $250 billion.  To increase respectability, and access to [[tax treaty|tax treaties]], some havens like Singapore and Ireland require corporates to have a "substantive presence", equating to an "{{slink|#Employment tax}}" of circa 2-3% of profits shielded via the haven (if these are real jobs, the tax is mitigated).

In {{slink|#Corporate tax haven lists}}, CORPNET's [[Conduit and Sink OFCs|"Orbis connections"]], ranks the Netherlands, U.K., Switzerland, Ireland and Singapore as the world's key corporate tax havens, while [[Gabriel Zucman|Zucman's]] [[Conduit and Sink OFCs#Ireland underestimated|"quantum of funds"]] ranks Ireland as the largest global corporate tax haven. In {{slink|#Proxy tests}}, Ireland is the largest recipient of U.S. [[Tax inversion#Destinations|tax inversions]] (the U.K. is third, the Netherlands is fifth). Ireland's [[double Irish]] BEPS tool is credited with the largest build-up of untaxed corporate [[double Irish|offshore cash in history]].  Luxembourg and Hong Kong and the Caribbean "triad" (BVI-Cayman-Bermuda), have elements of corporate tax havens, but also of traditional tax havens.

Unlike traditional [[tax havens]], modern corporate tax havens reject they have anything to do with near-zero [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Effective tax rate (ETR)|effective tax rates]].  This is attributed to their need to encourage jurisdictions to enter into bilateral [[Tax treaty|tax treaties]] which accept the haven's [[BEPS]] tools.  CORPNET show each corporate tax haven is strongly connected with specific traditional tax havens (via additional [[BEPS]] tool "backdoors" like the [[double Irish]], the [[dutch sandwich]], and [[Double Irish arrangement#Replacement by single malt|single malt]]). Corporate tax havens promote themselves as "knowledge economies", and [[intellectual property|IP]] as a "new economy" asset, rather than a tax management tool, which is encoded into their statute books as their primary [[BEPS]] tool.  This perceived respectability encourages corporates to use havens as regional headquarters (i.e. Google, Apple and Facebook use Ireland/U.K. in EMEA over Luxembourg, and Singapore in APAC over Hong Kong/Taiwan; none use the BVI-Cayman-Bermuda "triad" as a regional headquarters).

Smaller corporate havens meet the IMF-definition of an [[offshore financial centre]], as the untaxed accounting flows from the [[base erosion and profit shifting|BEPS]] tools, artificially distorts the economic statistics of the haven (e.g. Ireland's 2015 [[leprechaun economics]] GDP, Luxembourg's 70% GNI to GDP ratio, most {{slink|#Ten major tax havens}} are in the top 15 {{slink|#GDP-per-capita tax haven proxy}} list).  The distortion can lead to over-leverage in the haven's economy (and property bubbles), making them prone to severe credit cycles.

Modern corporate tax centres, such as Ireland, Singapore, the Netherlands and the U.K., are very different from traditional "offshore" [[tax havens]] like Bermuda, the Cayman Islands or Jersey.&lt;ref name="dut"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thecorrespondent.com/6942/bermuda-guess-again-turns-out-holland-is-the-tax-haven-of-choice-for-us-companies/417639737658-b85252de|title=Bermuda?

Once the untaxed funds are rerouted back to the corporate tax haven, additional BEPS tools shield against paying taxes in the haven.  It is important these BEPS tools are complex and obtuse so that the higher-tax jurisdictions do not feel the corporate haven is a traditional tax haven (or they will suspend the bilateral tax treaties).  These complex BEPS tools often have interesting labels:&lt;ref name="zew"/&gt;&lt;ref name="caid"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.christianaid.ie/sites/default/files/2018-02/impossible-structures-tax-report.pdf|title=‘Impossible’ structures: tax outcomes overlooked by the 2015 tax Spillover analysis |publisher=Christian Aid|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{ordered list|type=lower-roman
|[[Royalty payment]] BEPS tools to reroute the funds to a traditional tax haven (i.e. [[double Irish]] and [[Double Irish arrangement#Replacement by single malt|single malt]] in Ireland or [[dutch sandwich]] in the Netherlands); or

|Lower IP-sourced income tax regimes, offering explicitly lower ETRs against charging out of cross-border group IP (i.e. the U.K. [[patent box]], or the Irish [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Knowledge development box|knowledge box]]); or
|Beneficial treatment of interest income (from {{slink|#Debt-based BEPS tools}}), enabling it to be treated as non-taxable (i.e. the Dutch "double dipping" interest regime&lt;ref name="dut10"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/dec/10/taxandspending-taxavoidance|title=Dutch Double Dips and Dutch Sandwiches|publisher=The Guardian|date=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;); or

}}

The first component to achieving the above is to have the advanced legal and accounting skills that can create {{slink|#IP-based BEPS tools}} which are acceptable to global jurisdictions and encoded into bilateral tax-treaties (and do not look like "tax haven" type activity).  This is why most modern corporate tax havens come from [[financial centres]] where these advanced skills are in-situ for financial structuring.&lt;ref name="dut5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dut3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dut4"/&gt;

The second component is respectability.  Major higher-tax jurisdictions like Germany would not accept IP-based BEPS tools from Bermuda but do from Ireland.  Similarly, Australia accepts limited IP-based BEPS tools from Hong Kong but accepts the full range from Singapore.  Maintaining respectability for a corporate tax haven involves four elements:&lt;ref name="ftt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d9b4fd34-ca3f-11e3-8a31-00144feabdc0|title=Tax avoidance: The Irish inversion|publisher=The Financial Times|date=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{ordered list|type=lower-roman
|Non-zero headline tax rates.  While corporate tax havens have ETRs of close to zero, they all maintain non-zero "headline" tax rates.  Many of the corporate tax havens have accounting studies to prove that their "effective" tax rates are similar to their "headline" tax rates,&lt;ref name="pwcrates"/&gt; but this is because they are net of the {{slink|#IP-based BEPS tools}} which consider much of the income exempt from tax;

{{quote|Make no mistake: the headline rate is not what triggers tax evasion and aggressive tax planning.

|OECD-compliance and endorsement.  Most corporate tax structures in modern corporate tax havens are OECD-whitelisted.&lt;ref name="pod"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/paschal-donohoe-rejects-report-branding-republic-world-s-biggest-tax-haven-1.3529061|title=Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe rejects Gabrial Zucman report branding Ireland as the ‘world’s biggest tax haven’|quote=Minister Donohoe pointed out that the Republic earned the “highest rating possible in terms of transparency” in the OECD’s latest review. |publisher=Irish Times|date=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The OECD has been a long-term supporter of {{slink|#IP-based BEPS tools}} and cross-border intergroup IP charging.  All the corporate tax havens signed the 2017 OECD [[Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting|MLI]] and marketed their compliance, however, they all opted out of the key article 12 section;&lt;ref name="itm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="caid"/&gt;

|{{slink|#Employment tax}} strategies.  Leading corporate tax havens distance themselves from traditional tax havens by requiring corporates to establish a "presence of substance" in their jurisdiction.  This equates to an effective "employment tax" of circa 2-3% but it gives the corporate, and the jurisdiction, defense against accusations as being a tax haven, and is supported in OCED [[Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting|MLI]] Article 5.

|Data protection laws.  To maintain their OECD-whitelisted status, corporate tax havens cannot use the secrecy legislation found in very traditional tax havens.  They keep the "effective" tax rates of corporations hidden with data protection and privacy laws which prevent the public filing of accounts, and also limit the sharing of data across State departments (see [[Ireland as a tax haven#Captured state|here]] for examples).

===Financial impact===
{{see also|Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Effective tax rate (ETR)}}

It is difficult to calculate the financial effect of tax havens in general due to the obfuscation of financial data. Most estimates have wide ranges (see [[tax haven#Financial effect|financial effect of tax havens]]).  By focusing on "headline" vs. "effective" corporate tax rates, researchers have been able to more accurately estimate the annual financial tax losses (or "profits shifted"), due to corporate tax havens specifically. This is not easy, however.  As discussed above, havens are sensitive to discussions on “effective” corporate tax rates and obfuscate data that does not show the "headline" tax rate mirroring the "effective" tax rate.

Two academic groups have estimated the "effective" tax rates of corporate tax havens using very different approaches:
{{ordered list|type=lower-roman
| 2014 [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] (or BEA) calculation applied to get the "effective" tax rates of U.S. corporates in the haven (per above {{slink|#Denial of status}});&lt;ref name="qzz"/&gt; and
| 2018 [[Gabriel Zucman]] "The Missing Profits of Nations" analysis which uses national accounts data to estimate effective tax rates of all non-domestic corporates in the haven.&lt;ref name="gabrielzucman"/&gt;
}}

They are summarised in the following table for the top eight corporate tax havens (BVI and the Caymans counted as one), as listed in Zucman's analysis (from Appendix, table 2).&lt;ref name="gabrielzucman"/&gt;

Zucman used this analysis to estimate that the annual financial impact of corporate tax havens was $250 billion in 2015.&lt;ref name="zuc10"/&gt;  This is beyond the upper limit of the OECD's 2017 range of $100–200 billion per annum for [[base erosion and profit shifting]] activities.&lt;ref name="BEPS Background"&gt;{{cite web|title=BEPS Project Background Brief|url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/background-brief-inclusive-framework-for-beps-implementation.pdf|quote=With a conservatively estimated annual revenue loss of USD 100 to 240 billion, the stakes are high for governments around the world. |publisher=OECD|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These are the most credible and widely quoted sources of the financial impact of corporate tax havens.

The [[World Bank]], in its 2019 [[World Development Report]] on the future of work [http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2019 suggests] that tax avoidance by large corporations limits the ability of governments to make vital human capital investments.

===Conduits and Sinks===
{{main|Conduit and Sink OFCs}}
Modern corporate tax havens like Ireland, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have become more popular for U.S. corporate [[tax inversion]]s than leading traditional [[tax havens]], even Bermuda.&lt;ref name="bbb"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/tax-inversion-tracker/|title=Tracking Tax Runaways|publisher=Bloomberg News|date=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Uncovering Offshore Financial Centers Cayman Conundrum.jpg|thumb|"Uncovering Offshore Financial Centers": Relationship of [[Conduit and Sink OFCs|Conduit and Sink Offshore Financial Centres]].]]
However, corporate tax havens still retain close connections with traditional tax havens as there are instances where a corporation cannot "retain" the untaxed funds in the corporate tax haven, and will instead use the corporate tax haven like a "conduit", to route the funds to more explicitly zero-tax, and more secretive traditional tax havens.  Google does this with the Netherlands to route EU funds untaxed to Bermuda (i.e. [[dutch sandwich]] to avoid EU [[withholding taxes]]),&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/double-irish-and-dutch-sandwich-saved-google-3-7bn-in-tax-in-2016-1.3343205 | title=‘Double Irish’ and ‘Dutch Sandwich’ saved Google $3.7bn in tax in 2016| publisher=Irish Times| date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-02/google-s-dutch-sandwich-shielded-16-billion-euros-from-tax | title=Google’s ‘Dutch Sandwich’ Shielded 16 Billion Euros From Tax| publisher=Bloomberg| date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Russian banks do this with Ireland to avoid international sanctions and access capital markets (i.e. [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)|Irish Section 110 SPVs]]).&lt;ref name="rus2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businesspost.ie/news/russian-firms-funnelled-e100bn-dublin-410840|title=How Russian Firms Funnelled €100bn through Dublin|publisher=The Sunday Business Post|date=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rus3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/media-and-marketing/more-than-100bn-in-russian-money-funnelled-though-dublin-1.3414480|title=More than €100bn in Russian Money funneled through Dublin|publisher=The Irish Times|date=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in [[Nature (magazine)|Nature]] in 2017 (see [[Conduit and Sink OFCs]]),  highlighted an emerging gap between corporation tax haven specialists (called Conduit OFCs), and more traditional tax havens (called Sink OFCs).  It also highlighted that each Conduit OFC was highly connected to specific Sink OFC(s).  For example, Conduit OFC Switzerland was highly tied to Sink OFC Jersey.  Conduit OFC Ireland was tied to Sink OFC Luxembourg,&lt;ref name="llux"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2018/06/28/Ireland-Selected-Issues-46027|page=20|quote=Figure 3. Foreign Direct Investment - Over half of Irish outbound FDI is routed to Luxembourg|title=Ireland:Selected Issues|publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Conduit OFC Singapore was connected to Sink OFCs Taiwan and Hong Kong (the study clarified that Luxembourg and Hong Kong were more like traditional tax havens).

The separation of tax havens into Conduit OFCs and Sink OFCs, enables the corporate tax haven specialist to promote "respectability" and maintain OECD-compliance (critical to extracting untaxed profits from higher-taxed jurisdictions via cross-border intergroup IP charging), while enabling the corporate to still access the benefits of a full tax haven (via [[double Irish]], [[dutch sandwich]] type BEPS tools), as needed.

We increasingly find [[offshore magic circle]] law firms, such as [[Maples and Calder]], and [[Appleby (law firm)|Appleby]],&lt;ref name="appley"/&gt; setting up offices in major Conduit OFCs, such as Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Law firm Walkers doubles up on Dublin office space in the IFSC | url=https://www.businesspost.ie/property/law-firm-walkers-doubles-dublin-office-space-ifsc-408090|publisher=Sunday Business Post|date=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=MaplesFS plans to add staff after Dublin office move | url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/financial-services/maplesfs-plans-to-add-staff-after-dublin-office-move-1.3071980|publisher=Irish Times|date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Mourant opens Dublin office | url=https://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2008/01/15/mourant-opens-dublin-office/|publisher=Jersey Post|date=January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment tax===

Several modern corporate tax havens, such as Singapore and the United Kingdom, ask that in return for corporates using their IP-based BEPS tools, they must perform "work" on the IP in the jurisdiction of the haven.  The corporation thus pays an effective "employment tax" of circa 2-3% by having to hire staff in the corporate tax haven.&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/singapore-remains-the-top-choice-for-multinational-hubs-tax-data-shows-20150429-1mw59e.html|title=Singapore remains the top choice for multinational hubs, tax data shows|date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This gives the haven more respectability (i.e. not a "[[brass plate company|brass plate]]" location), and gives the corporate additional "substance" against challenges by taxing authorities. The OECD's Article 5 of the  [[Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting|MLI]] supports havens with "employment taxes" at the expense of traditional [[tax havens]].

{{quote|Mr. Chris Woo, tax leader at PwC Singapore, is adamant the Republic is not a tax haven. "Singapore has always had clear law and regulations on taxation. Our incentive regimes are substance-based and require substantial economic commitment. For example, types of business activity undertaken, level of headcount and commitment to spending in Singapore", he said.|[[The Straits Times]], 14 December 2016&lt;ref name="straits"/&gt;}}

Irish IP-based BEPS tools (e.g. the "[[Double Irish arrangement#Backstop of capital allowances|capital allowances for intangible assets]]" BEPS scheme), have the need to perform a "relevant trade" and "relevant activities" on Irish-based IP, encoded in their leglislation, which requires specified employment levels and salary levels (discussed [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Low tax economy|here]]), which roughly equates to an "employment tax" of circa 2-3% of profits (based on Apple and Google in Ireland).&lt;ref name="cap1"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Intangible Assets Scheme under Section 291A Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 |url = https://www.revenue.ie/ga/tax-professionals/historic-material/tax-briefing/2010/tax-briefing-issue-09-2010.pdf|publisher=Irish Revenue|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cap2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-09/09-02-05.pdf|title=Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets under section 291A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (Part 9 / Chapter2)|publisher=Irish Revenue|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Apple employs 6,000 people in Ireland, mostly in the Apple Hollyhill Cork plant.  The Cork plant is Apple's only self-operated manufacturing plant in the world (i.e. Apple almost always contracts to 3rd party manufacturers).  It is considered a low-technology facility, building iMacs to order by hand, and in this regard is more akin to a global logistics hub for Apple (albeit located on the "island" of Ireland).  No research is carried out in the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/30/the-guardian-view-on-tax-and-ireland-apple-pay-your-way|title=The Guardian view on tax and Ireland: Apple, pay your way|date=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unusually for a plant, over 700 of the 6,000 employees work from home (the largest remote percentage of any Irish technology company).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/revealed-eight-facts-you-may-not-know-about-the-apple-irish-plant-36409796.html|title=Revealed Eight facts you may not know about the Apple Irish plant|publisher=Irish Independent|date=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="appleq"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/29/apple-tax-profits-ireland-cork|title=Apple's multi-billion dollar, low-tax profit hub: Knocknaheeny, Ireland|publisher=The Guardian|date=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the EU Commission completed their [[EU illegal State aid case against Apple in Ireland|State aid investigation into Apple]], they found Apple Ireland's ETR for 2004-2014, was 0.005%, on over €100bn of globally sourced, and untaxed, profits.&lt;ref name="europax"/&gt;  The "employment tax" is, therefore, a modest price to pay for achieving very low taxes on global profits, and it can be mitigated to the extent that the job functions are real and would be needed regardless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.finfacts.ie/Irish_finance_news/articleDetail.php?Does-Google-Ireland-have-6-000-employees-in-Ireland-649|title=Does Google Ireland really have 6,000 employees in Ireland?|date=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Employment taxes" are considered a distinction between modern corporate tax havens, and near-corporate tax havens, like Luxembourg and Hong Kong (who are classed as [[Conduit and Sink OFCs|Sink OFCs]]).  The Netherlands has been introducing new "employment tax" type regulations, to ensure it is seen as a modern corporate tax haven (more like Ireland, Singapore, and the U.K.), than a traditional tax haven (e.g. Hong Kong).&lt;ref name="ned"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/ef9b87ac-1af5-11e8-aaca-4574d7dabfb6|title=Dutch set out plan to counter tax-haven reputation|publisher=Financial Times|date=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Netherlands is fighting back against its reputation as a tax haven with reforms to make it more difficult for companies to set up without a real business presence.

===U.K. transformation===

The United Kingdom was traditionally a "donor" to corporate tax havens (e.g. the last one being [[Shire plc]]'s [[tax inversion]] to Ireland in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/apr/15/shire.pharmaceuticals|title=Drugs company moves to cut tax bill|publisher=The Guardian|date=15 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;). However, the speed at which the U.K. changed to becoming one of the leading modern corporate tax havens (at least up until pre-[[Brexit]]), makes it an interesting case (it still does not appear on all {{slink|#Corporate tax haven lists}}).

[[File:British Overseas Territories (at the same geographic scale).svg|thumb|British Overseas Territories (same geographic scale) includes leading traditional and corporate global tax havens including the Caymans, the BVI and Bermuda, as well as the U.K. itself.]]

The U.K. changed its tax regime in 2009-2013. It lowered its corporate tax rate to 19%, brought in new IP-based BEPS tools, and moved to a territorial tax system.&lt;ref name="uk1"/&gt;  The U.K. became a "recipient" of U.S. corporate [[tax inversion]]s,&lt;ref name="bbb"/&gt; and ranked as one of Europe's leading havens.&lt;ref name="econ"/&gt;  A major study now ranks the U.K. as the second largest global [[Conduit and Sink OFCs|Conduit OFC]] (a corporate haven proxy).  The U.K. was particularly fortunate as 18 of the 24 jurisdictions that are identified as [[Conduit and Sink OFCs|Sink OFCs]], the traditional [[tax havens]], are current or past dependencies of the U.K. (and embedded into U.K. tax and legal statute books).&lt;ref name="tjn1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taxjustice.net/2017/05/04/coming-soon-spiders-web-film-britains-tax-haven-empire/|title=The Spider’s Web – a film about Britain’s tax haven empire|publisher=Tax Justice Network|date=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New IP legislation was encoded into the U.K. statute books and the concept of IP significantly broadened in U.K. law.&lt;ref name="ukipo"/&gt; The U.K.'s Patent Office was overhauled and renamed the [[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)|Intellectual Property Office]].

===Distorted GDP/GNP===
[[File:2011 Ratio of GNI to GDP (EuroStat National Accounts).png|thumb|right|"EU 2011 Ratio of GNI to GDP" (Eurostat National Accounts, 2011)]]

Some leading modern corporate tax havens are synonymous with [[offshore financial centres]] (or OFCs), as the scale of the multinational flows rivals their own domestic economies (the IMF's sign of an OFC&lt;ref name="imf"&gt;IMF working paper: [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2007/wp0787.pdf Concept of Offshore Financial Centers: In Search of an Operational Definition; Ahmed Zoromé; IMF Working Paper 07/87; April 1, 2007].

===Raw materials of tax avoidance===

Whereas traditional corporate tax havens facilitated avoiding domestic taxes (e.g. U.S. corporate [[tax inversion]]), modern corporate tax havens provide [[base erosion and profit shifting]] (or BEPS) tools,&lt;ref name="zew"/&gt; which facilitate avoiding taxes in all global jurisdictions in which the corporation operates.&lt;ref name="tilburg"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://arno.uvt.nl/show.cgi?fid=143915| title=Intellectual Property Tax Planning in the light of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting  | publisher=University of Tilburg | date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is as long as the corporate tax haven has tax-treaties with the jurisdictions that accept "[[royalty payment]]" schemes (i.e. how the IP is charged out), as a deduction against tax.&lt;ref name="bbbg"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/infographics/u-s-profits-in-ireland-pile-up.html|title=Ireland: Where Profits Pile Up, Helping Multinationals Keep Taxes Low|publisher=Bloomberg News|quote=Meanwhile, the tax rate reported by those Irish subsidiaries of U.S. companies plummeted to 3% from 9% by 2010|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A crude indicator of a corporate tax haven is the amount of full bilateral tax treaties that it has signed.

When corporate tax havens quote "effective rates of tax", they exclude large amounts of income not considered taxable due to the IP-based tools.  Thus, in a self-fulfilling manner, their "effective" tax rates equal their "headline" tax rates.  As discussed earlier ({{slink|#Denials of status}}), Ireland claims an "effective" tax rate of circa 12.5%, while the IP-based BEPS tools used by Ireland's largest companies, mostly U.S. multinationals, are marketed with [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Effective tax rate (ETR)|effective tax rates]] of &lt;0-3%.&lt;ref name="maples"/&gt;&lt;ref name="matheson1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.matheson.com/images/uploads/documents/China_Article_-_March_2013.pdf|title=Ireland as a European gateway jurisdiction for China – outbound and inbound investments | quote= The tax deduction can be used to achieve an effective tax rate of 2.5% on profits from the exploitation of the IP purchased.

===Encoding IP-based BEPS tools===
{{see also|Ireland as a tax haven#Captured state}}
The creation of IP-based BEPS tools requires advanced legal and tax structuring capabilities, as well as a regulatory regime willing to carefully encode the complex legislation into the jurisdiction's statute books (note that BEPS tools bring increased risks of tax abuse by the domestic tax base in corporate tax haven's own jurisdiction, see {{slink|#Irish Section 110 SPV}} for an example).&lt;ref name="oxf"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://maketaxfair.net/decorrespondent-reveals-netherlands-became-tax-haven/| title=DE CORRESPONDENT REVEALS HOW THE NETHERLANDS BECAME TAX HAVEN|publisher=Oxfam/De Correspondant|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dut"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dut5"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Professionals: Dealing with the enablers of tax avoidance and financial crime|url = https://www.taxjustice.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/The-Enablers-of-Tax-Avoidance-TJN-Briefing.pdf|publisher=[[Tax Justice Network]]|date=November 2017|author=George Turner}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern corporate tax havens, therefore, tend to have large global legal and accounting professional service firms in-situ (many classical [[tax havens]] lack this) who work with the government to build the legislation.&lt;ref name="econ"/&gt;  In this regard, havens are accused of being '''captured states''' by their professional services firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jan/09/explainer-what-is-tax-haven|quote=This political capture produces one of the great offshore paradoxes: these zones of ultra-freedom are often highly repressive places, wary of scrutiny and intolerant of criticism.|title=Explainer: what is a tax haven?

===German "Royalty Barrier" failure===

In June 2017, the German Federal Council approved a new law called an IP "Royalty Barrier" (Lizenzschranke) that restricts the ability of corporates to deduct intergroup cross-border IP charges against German taxation (and also encourage corporates to allocate more employees to Germany to maximise German tax-relief).  The law also enforces a minum "effective" 25% tax rate on IP.&lt;ref&gt;Accordingly, as of 1 January 2018, German-based licensees will be unable to deduct royalties paid to affiliates to the extent that the licensor’s royalty income is not subject to the regular tax regime (e.g. IP box regime) and taxed at a low rate within the meaning of the royalty barrier (effective tax rate of &lt; 25 %).{{cite web|url=https://www.bakermckenzie.com/en/insight/publications/2017/07/federal-council-approves-royalty-deductions|title=Federal Council Approves New Law Limiting Royalty Deductions|publisher=[[Baker McKenzie]]|date=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While there was initial concern amongst global corporate tax advisors (who encode the IP leglislation) that a "Royalty Barrier" was the "beginning of the end" for IP-based BEPS tools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/blog/18th-annual-nyukpmg-tax-lecture-addresses-international-provisions-of-tcja/|title=18th Annual NYU/KPMG Tax Lecture Addresses International Provisions of TCJA|publisher=Reuters|date=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the final law was instead a boost for modern corporate tax havens, whose OECD-compliant, and more carefully encoded and embedded IP tax regimes, are effectively exempted.  More traditional corporate tax havens, which do not always have the level of sophistication and skill in encoding IP BEPS tools into their tax regimes, will fall further behind.

The German "Royalty Barrier" law exempts IP charged from locations which have:

The failure of the German "Royalty Barrier" approach is a familiar route for systems that attempt to curb corporate tax havens via an OECD-compliance type approach (see {{slink|#Failure of OECD BEPS Project}}), which is what modern corporate tax havens are distinctive in maintaining.  It contrasts with the U.S. [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]] (see {{slink|#Failure of OECD BEPS Project}}), which ignores whether a jurisdiction is OECD compliant (or not), and instead focuses solely on "effective taxes paid", as its metric.  Had the German "Royalty Barrier" taken the U.S. approach, it would have been more onerous for havens.  Reasons for why the barrier was designed to fail is discussed in [[Ireland as a tax haven#Complex agendas|complex agendas]].

===IP and post-tax margins===

The sectors most associated with IP (e.g., technology and life sciences) are generally the some of the most profitable corporate sectors in the world.  By using IP-based BEPS tools, these profitable sectors have become even more profitable on an after-tax basis by artificially suppressing profitability in higher-tax jurisdictions, and profit shifting to low-tax locations.&lt;ref name="zuc"/&gt;

For example, Google Germany should be even more profitable than the already very profitable Google U.S.  This is because the marginal additional costs for firms like Google U.S. of expanding into Germany are very low (the core technology platform has been built).  In practice, however, Google Germany is actually unprofitable (for tax purposes), as it pays intergroup IP charges back to Google Ireland, who reroutes them to Google Bermuda, who is extremely profitable (more so than Google U.S.).&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/11/tech-giants-taxes-apple-paradise-corporation-avoidance|title=The tech giants will never pay their fair share of taxes – unless we make them| publisher=The  Guardian| date=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These intergroup IP charges (i.e. the IP-based BEPS tools), are artificial internal constructs.

For example, the definitions of IP in corporate tax havens such as Ireland has been broadened to include "theoretical assets", such as types of general rights, general know-how, general goodwill, and the right to use software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ireland as a Location for Your Intellectual Property Trading Company|url = http://www.arthurcox.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Arthur-Cox-Ireland-as-a-location-for-your-IP-Trading-Company-April-20152.pdf|publisher=Arthur Cox Law|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ireland's IP regime  includes types of "internally developed" intangible assets and intangible assets purchased from "connected parties".  The real control in Ireland is that the IP assets must be acceptable under GAAP (older 2004 Irish GAAP is accepted), and thus auditable by an Irish [[International Financial Services Centre]] accounting firm.&lt;ref name="rev1"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Intangible Assets Scheme under Section 291A Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 |url = https://www.revenue.ie/ga/tax-professionals/historic-material/tax-briefing/2010/tax-briefing-issue-09-2010.pdf|publisher=Irish Revenue|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets "Specified Assets" |url=https://www.revenue.ie/en/companies-and-charities/reliefs-and-exemptions/capital-allowances-for-intangible-assets/index.aspx|publisher=Irish Revenue|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A broadening range of multinationals are abusing IP accounting to increase after-tax margins, via intergroup charge-outs of artificial IP assets for BEPS purposes, including:

===Apple vs. Pfizer-Allergan===

Modern corporate tax havens further leverage their IP-based BEPS toolbox to enable international corporates to execute quasi-tax inversions, which could otherwise be blocked by domestic anti-inversion rules.  The largest example was Apple's Q1 January 2015 restructuring of its Irish business, Apple Sales International, in a quasi-tax inversion, which led to the [[Paul Krugman]] labeled "[[leprechaun economics]]" affair in Ireland in July 2016 (see article).

In early 2016, the Obama Administration blocked the proposed $160 billion Pfizer-Allergan Irish corporate tax inversion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/pfizer-pulls-out-of-140bn-irish-allergan-merger-34603518.html|title=Pfizer pulls out of €140bn Irish Allergan merger|publisher=Irish Independent|date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2016-04-06/big-pharma-ruined-tax-inversions-for-everybody|title=Big Pharma Murdered Tax Inversions|publisher=Bloomberg News|date=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest proposed corporate [[tax inversion]] in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = US issues new rules to clamp down on tax ‘inversions’|url = https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/us-issues-new-rules-to-clamp-down-on-tax-inversions-1.2829090|publisher=Irish Times|date=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decision which the Trump Administration also updeld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-inversions/trump-to-keep-obama-rule-curbing-corporate-tax-inversion-deals-idUSKBN1C92RQ|title=Trump to keep Obama rule curbing corporate tax inversion deals|publisher=Reuters|date=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Report_on_recent_US_international_tax_developments_-_20_January_2017/$FILE/2017G_00259-171Gbl_Report%20on%20recent%20US%20international%20tax%20developments%20-%2020%20January%202017.pdf|title=Global Tax Aleart Corporate Inversions|publisher=Ernst &amp; Young|date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, both Administrations were silent when the Irish State announced in July 2016 that 2015 GDP has risen 26.3% in one quarter due to the "onshoring" of corporate IP, and it was rumoured to be Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/apple-tax-affairs-changes-triggered-surge-in-irish-economy-419912.html|title=Apple tax affairs changes triggered a surge in Irish economy|publisher=The Irish Examiner|date=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It might have been due to the fact that the [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)]] openly delayed and limited its normal data release to protect the confidentiality of the source of the growth.&lt;ref name="cso"/&gt; It was only in early 2018, almost three years after Apple's Q1 2015 $300 billion quasi-tax inversion to Ireland (the largest [[tax inversion]] in history), that enough [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)]] data was released to prove it definitively was Apple.&lt;ref name="brads"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Apple’s Exports Aren’t Missing: They Are in Ireland|url = https://www.cfr.org/blog/apples-exports-arent-missing-they-are-ireland|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|date=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cofr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfr.org/blog/tax-avoidance-and-irish-balance-payments|title=Tax Avoidance and the Irish Balance of Payments|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|date=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cffy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economic-incentives.blogspot.ie/2018/01/what-apple-did-next.html|title=What Apple did next|publisher=Seamus Coffey, University College Cork|date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial commentators estimate Apple onshored circa $300 billion in IP to Ireland, effectively representing the balance sheet of Apple's non-U.S. business.&lt;ref name="cofr"/&gt;  Thus, Apple completed a quasi-inversion of its non-U.S. business, to itself, in Ireland, which was almost twice the scale of Pfizer-Allergan's $160 billion blocked inversion.

===Apple's IP-based BEPS inversion===

Apple used Ireland's new BEPS tool, and "[[double Irish]]" replacement, the "[[double Irish arrangement#Backstop of capital allowances|capital allowances for intangible assets]]" scheme.&lt;ref name="cffy"/&gt;  This BEPS tool enables corporates to write-off the "arm's length" (to be OECD-compliant), intergroup acquisition of offshored IP, against all Irish corporate taxes.  The “arm’s length” criteria are achieved by getting a major accounting firm in Ireland's [[International Financial Services Centre]] to conduct a valuation, and Irish GAAP audit, of the IP.  The range of IP acceptable by the Irish [[Revenue Commissioners]] is very broad.  This BEPS tool can be continually replenished by acquiring new offshore IP with each new "product cycle".&lt;ref name="maples"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/377485537/Maples-and-Calder-Ireland-Intellectual-Property-2018|title=Maples and Calder Irish Intellectual Property Tax Regime - 2.5% Effective Tax| publisher=[[Maples and Calder]] Law Firm|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mhc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mhc.ie/latest/e-zines/world-ip-day-2014/P1|title=World IP Day: IRELAND'S 2.5% IP Tax Rate (Section 4.1.1)|publisher=Mason Hayes and Curran|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="acox"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ireland as a Location for Your Intellectual Property Trading Company|url = http://www.arthurcox.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Arthur-Cox-Ireland-as-a-location-for-your-IP-Trading-Company-April-20152.pdf|publisher=Arthur Cox Law|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="matheson1"/&gt;

In addition, Ireland's 2015 Finance Act removed the 80% cap on this tool (which forced a minimum 2.5% [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Effective tax rate (ETR)|effective tax rate]]), thus giving Apple a 0% [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Effective tax rate (ETR)|effective tax rate]] on the "onshored" IP.  Ireland then restored the 80% cap in 2016 (and a return to a minimum 2.5% [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Effective tax rate (ETR)|effective tax rate]]), but only for new schemes.&lt;ref name="app2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/budget/tax-break-for-ip-transfers-is-cut-to-80pc-36215540.html|title=Tax break for IP transfers is cut to 80pc|work=Irish Independent|date=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="app1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/cliff-taylor-noonan-and-donohoe-rule-switching-could-cost-1bn-next-year-1.3283383?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fcliff-taylor-noonan-and-donohoe-rule-switching-could-cost-1bn-next-year-1.3283383|title=Change in tax treatment of intellectual property and subsequent and reversal hard to fathom|publisher=Irish Times|date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Apple was able to achieve what Pfizer-Allergan could not, by making use of Ireland's advanced IP-based BEPS tools.  Apple avoided any U.S regulatory scrutiny/blocking of its actions, as well as any wider U.S. public outcry, as Pfizer-Allergan incurred.  Apple structured an Irish corporate [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Effective tax rate (ETR)|effective tax rate]] of close to zero on its non-U.S. business, at twice the scale of the Pfizer-Allergan inversion.

==Debt-based BEPS tools==

===Dutch "Double Dip"===
[[Image:JoopWijn.jpg|thumb|right|'''Ex. Dutch Minister [[Joop Wijn]]''' credited with introducing the [[Dutch Sandwich]] IP-based BEPS tool (which is often used with the [[Double Irish]] BEPS tool), and the "Dutch Double Dip" Debt-based BEPS tool]]
While the focus of corporate tax havens continues to be on developing new IP-based BEPS tools (such as OECD-compliant knowledge/patent boxes), Ireland has developed new BEPS tools leveraging traditional [[securitisation]] SPVs, called [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)|Section 110 SPVs]].  Use of intercompany loans and loan interest was one of the original BEPS tools and was used in many of the early U.S. corporate [[tax inversion]]s (was known as [[Corporate inversion#Mechanics|"earnings-stripping"]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/tax-inversion|title=Bloomberg Special TAX INVERSION|publisher=Bloomberg|date=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Netherlands has been a leader in this area, using specifically worded legislation to enable IP-light companies further amplify "earnings-stripping".  This is used by mining and resource extraction companies, who have little or no IP, but who use high levels of leverage and asset financing.&lt;ref name="neth"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oxfam.org/sites/www.oxfam.org/files/file_attachments/netherlands-taxhaven.pdf|title=The Netherlands: a tax haven continuing its contribution to the corporate tax race to the bottom (translated)|publisher=Oxfam Novib|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dut2"/&gt;  Dutch tax law enables IP-light companies to "overcharge" their subsidiaries for asset financing (i.e. reroute all untaxed profits back to the Netherlands), which is treated as tax-free in the Netherlands.  The technique of getting full tax-relief for an artificially high-interest rate in a foreign subsidiary, while getting additional tax relief on this income back home in the Netherlands, became known by the term, "double dipping".&lt;ref name="dut10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://home.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/pdf/2014/05/netherlands-2014.pdf|title=The Netherlands: Taxation of Cross-Border Mergers |publisher=KPMG|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   As with the [[Dutch sandwich]], ex.

===Irish Section 110 SPV===
[[File:Stephen Donnelly 2016.jpg|thumb|'''[[Stephen Donnelly|Stephen Donnelly TD]]''' Estimated US distressed funds used Section 110 SPVs to avoid €20 billion in Irish taxes on almost €80 billion of Irish domestic investments from 2012-2016.&lt;ref name="sd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stephendonnelly.ie/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Closing-Down-Section-110-for-Vulture-Funds.pdf | title=WHY LETTING SECTION 110 SPVS OPERATE IN THE IRISH DOMESTIC ECONOMY WILL DAMAGE OUR TAX BASE AND OUR REPUTATION AS A ‘LOW-TAX’ ECONOMY | publisher=Stephen Donnelly (Dail Submission)|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)|Irish Section 110 SPV]] uses complex securitisation loan structuring (including [[Orphan structure|"orphaning"]] which adds confidentiality), to enable the profit shifting.  This tool is so powerful, it inadvertently enabled US [[distressed debt]] funds avoid billions in Irish taxes on circa €80 billion of Irish investments they made in 2012-2016 (see [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)#Abuses|Section 110 abuse]]).&lt;ref name="l1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37287182|title=Forget Apple: Ireland's other taxing issue|publisher=BBC News|date=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="l2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/619c9bde-74f3-11e6-bf48-b372cdb1043a|title=Ireland confronts another tax scandal closer to home|publisher=Financial Times|date=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nnn"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/opinion/comment/how-did-the-government-shaft-mortgage-holders-and-taxpayers-in-one-fell-swoop-34870748.html|title=How did the Government shaft mortgage holders and taxpayers in one fell swoop?|publisher=Irish Independent|date=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nna"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/colette-browne/vulture-funds-are-feasting-taxfree-on-carcass-of-our-property-crash-35005936.html|title=Vulture funds are feasting tax-free on carcass of our property crash|publisher=Irish Independent|date=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was despite the fact that the seller of the circa €80 billion was mostly the Irish State's own [[National Asset Management Agency]].

The global securitisation market is circa $10 trillion in size,&lt;ref name="jpm"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.morganstanley.com/im/publication/insights/investment-insights/ii_overviewofglobalsecuritizedassets_en.pdf|title=Global Securitisation Market|publisher=Morgan Stanley|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and involves an array of complex financial loan instruments, structured on assets all over the world, using established securitization vehicles that are accepted globally (and whitelisted by the OECD).  This is also helpful for concealing corporate BEPS activities, as demonstrated by sanctioned Russian banks using Irish Section 110 SPVs.&lt;ref name="rus2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rus3"/&gt;

This area is therefore an important new BEPS tool for EU corporate tax havens, Ireland and Luxembourg,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/ireland-is-top-eurozone-jurisdiction-for-secretive-spvs-36047198.html|title=Ireland is top Eurozone jurisdiction for SPVs|publisher=Irish Independent|date=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who are also the EU's leading securitisation hubs.  Particularly so, given the new anti-IP-based BEPS tool taxes of the U.S. [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]] (TCJA), (i.e. the new GILTI tax regime and BEAT tax regime), and proposed EU Digital Services Tax (DST) regimes.&lt;ref name="carrot"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://taxfoundation.org/inversions-new-tax-law/| title=Inversions under the New Tax Law: Carrot and Stick|publisher=Tax Foundation|date=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Irish Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/donald-trump-singles-out-ireland-in-tax-speech-1.3310149?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Fdonald-trump-singles-out-ireland-in-tax-speech-1.3310149|title=Donald Trump singles out Ireland in tax speech|publisher=Irish Times|date=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gnx2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/europe-points-finger-at-ireland-over-tax-avoidance-1.3417948|title=Europe points finger at Ireland over tax avoidance|publisher=Irish Times|date=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. TCJA anticipates a return to debt-based BEPS tools, as it limits interest deductibility to 30% of EBITDA (moving to 30% of EBIT post 2021).&lt;ref name="lexology"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=04adc5c2-639a-45ce-8680-e080b5dacdbf|title=Tax Reform - Considerations for U.S. Multinationals| publisher=Lexology| date=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jpmorgan.com/jpmpdf/1320744529831.pdf|title=U.S. TCJA JPMorgan|publisher=JPMorgan| date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[securitisation]] SPVs are important new BEPS tools, and acceptable under global tax-treaties, they suffer from "substance" tests (i.e. challenges by tax authorities that the loans are artificial).  Irish Section 110 SPV's use of "[[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)#Features|Profit Participation Notes]]" (i.e. artificial internal intergroup loans), is an impediment to corporates using these structures versus established IP-based BEPS tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthurcox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Arthur-Cox-Establishing-SPVs-in-Ireland-for-Structured-Finance-Transactions-May-2014.pdf|title=Ireland as a Domicile for Structured Finance|publisher=Arthur Cox Law|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationaltaxreview.com/Article/3439735/Irish-tax-regime-for-securitisation-vehicles.html|title=Irish Securitisation Section 110 Vehicles|publisher=International Tax Review|date=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Solutions such as the [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)#Evolution|Orphaned Super-QIAIF]] have been created in the Irish tax code to resolve this.

However, while Debt-based BEPS tools may not feature with U.S. multinational technology companies, they have become attractive to global financial institutions (who do not need to meet the same "substance" tests on their financial transactions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/strong-evidence-ireland-aiding-eu-banks-taxavoidance-schemes-35569517.html|title='Strong evidence' Ireland aiding EU banks' tax-avoidance schemes|publisher=Irish Independent|date=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/financial-services/ireland-accused-of-facilitating-tax-avoidance-by-european-banks-1.3026167|title=Ireland accused of facilitating tax avoidance by European banks|publisher=Irish Times|date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] upgraded the little-used Irish [[Qualifying investor alternative investment fund (QIAIF)#L-QIAIF rationale|L-QIAIF]] regime to offer the same tax benefits as Section 110 SPVs but without the need for Profit Participation Notes and without the need to file public accounts with the Irish [[Companies Registration Office (Ireland)|CRO]] (which had exposed the scale of Irish domestic taxes Section 110 SPVs had been used to avoid, see [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)#Abuses|abuses]]).

==Ranking corporate tax havens==

{{see also|Corporate tax inversion}}

The study and identification of modern corporate tax havens are still developing.  Traditional qualitative-driven IMF-OCED-[[Financial Secrecy Index]] type [[tax haven]] screens, which focus on assessing legal and tax structures, are less effective given the high levels of transparency and OECD-compliance in modern corporate tax havens (i.e. most of their BEPS tools are OECD-whitelisted).

|A proposed proxy are jurisdictions to which U.S. corporates execute [[tax inversion]]s (see {{slink|#Bloomberg Corporate tax inversions}}).

|The 2017 report by the [[Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy]] on offshore activities of U.S. Fortune 500 companies, lists the Netherlands, Singapore, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Ireland and the Caribbean triad (the Cayman-Bermuda-BVI), as the places where Fortune 500 companies have the most subsidiaries (note: this does not estimate the scale of their activities).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itep.org/offshoreshellgames2017/|title=Offshore Shell Games: 2017|publisher=Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP)|page=11|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Zucman, Tørsløv, and Wier advocate profitability of U.S. corporates in the haven as a proxy.  This is particularly useful for havens that use the {{slink|#Employment tax}} system and require corporates to maintain a "substantive" presence in the haven for respectability.  Ireland is the most profitable location, followed by the Caribbean (incl. Bermuda), Luxembourg, Switzerland and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/TWZ2018Slides.pdf|title=The Missing Profits of Nations|page=26|publisher=Gabriel Zucman, Thomas Tørsløv, Ludvig Wier|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The non-Oil &amp; Gas nations in the top 15 [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita]] are tax havens led by Luxembourg, Singapore and Ireland (see {{slink|#GDP-per-capita tax haven proxy}}).

|A related but similar test is the ratio of GNI to GDP, as GNI is less prone to distortion by IP-based BEPS tools.  Countries with low GNI/GDP ratio (e.g. Luxembourg, Ireland and Singapore) are almost always tax havens. However, not all havens have low GNI/GDP ratios.  Example being the Netherlands, whose [[dutch sandwich]] BEPS tool impacts their national accounts in a different way.&lt;ref name="seamuscoffey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economic-incentives.blogspot.ie/2013/04/gdp-and-international-comparisons.html|title=International GNI to GDP Comparisons|author=Seamus Coffey [[Irish Fiscal Advisory Council]]|publisher=University College Cork|date=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ber"/&gt;

===Quantitative measures===
{{main|Conduit and Sink OFCs}}

More scientific, are the quantitative-driven studies (focused on empirical outcomes), such as the work by the University of Amsterdam's CORPNET in [[Conduit and Sink OFCs]],&lt;ref name="xxxx"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-06322-9| title=Uncovering Offshore Financial Centers: Conduits and Sinks in the Global Corporate Ownership Network| publisher=Nature Magazine|date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by University of Berkley's [[Gabriel Zucman]].&lt;ref name="zuc"/&gt;  They highlight the following modern corporate tax havens, also called [[Conduit and Sink OFCs|Conduit OFCs]], and also highlight their "partnerships" with key traditional [[tax havens]], called [[Conduit and Sink OFCs|Sink OFCs]]:
{{ordered list|type=lower-roman
| {{flagcountry|NLD|1912}} - the "mega" Conduit OFC, and focused on moving funds from the EU (via the "[[dutch sandwich]]" BEPS tool) to Luxembourg and the "triad" of Bermuda/BVI/Cayman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2017/07/the-netherlands-is-worlds-biggest-conduit-to-offshore-tax-havens-research/ | title=The Netherlands is world’s biggest conduit to offshore tax havens: research|publisher=Dutch News NL| date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.complianceweek.com/blogs/global-glimpses/netherlands-not-bermuda-is-the-tax-evasion-capital-of-the-world#.WsIZdojwZPY | title=Netherlands, not Bermuda, is the tax evasion capital of the world|publisher=Compliance Week| date=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| {{flagcountry|CHE|1912}} - long-established corporate tax haven and a major Conduit OFC for Jersey, one of the largest established offshore [[tax havens]].
| {{flagcountry|SGP|1912}} - the main Conduit OFC for Asia, and the link to the two major Asian Sink OFCs of Hong Kong and Taiwan (Taiwan is described as the Switzerland of Asia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taxjustice.net/2016/02/10/taiwan-the-un-noticed-asian-tax-haven/|title=Taiwan, the un-noticed Asian tax haven?|publisher=Tax Justice Network|date=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

}}

The only jurisdiction from the above list of major global corporate tax havens that makes an occasional appearance in OECD-IMF tax haven lists is Switzerland.  These jurisdictions are the leaders in IP-based BEPS tools and use of intergroup IP charging and have the most sophisticated IP legislation.  They have the largest tax treaty networks and all follow the {{slink|#Employment tax}} approach.

The analysis highlights the difference between "suspected" onshore [[tax havens]] (i.e. major Sink OFCs Luxembourg and Hong Kong), which because of their suspicion, have limited/restricted bilateral tax treaties (as countries are wary of them), and the Conduit OFCs, which have less "suspicion" and therefore the most extensive bilateral tax treaties.&lt;ref name="ukx"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dut2"/&gt;  Corporates need the broadest tax treaties for their [[BEPS]] tools, and therefore prefer to base themselves in Conduit OFCs (Ireland and Singapore), which can then route the corporate's funds to the Sink OFCs (Luxembourg and Hong Kong).&lt;ref name="fordam"/&gt;
[[File:List of sink-OFCs, ordered by sink centrality value.png|thumb|"Uncovering Offshore Financial Centers": List of Sink OFCs by value (highlighting the current and ex. U.K. dependencies, in light blue)]]
Of the major Sink OFCs, they span a range between traditional [[tax havens]] (with very limited tax treaty networks) and near-corporate tax havens:
{{ordered list|type=lower-roman
| {{flagcountry|BVI|1912}} {{flagcountry|BER|1912}} {{flagcountry|CYM|1912}} - The Caribbean "triad" of Bermuda/BVI/Cayman are classic major [[tax havens]], and therefore with limited access to full global tax treaty networks, thus relying on Conduit OFCs for access; heavily used by U.S. multinationals.
| {{flagcountry|LUX|1912}} - noted by CORPNET as being close to a Conduit, however, U.S. firms are more likely to use Ireland/U.K. as their Conduit OFC to Luxembourg.
| {{flagcountry|HKG|1912}} - often described as the "Luxembourg of Asia";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://citi.com/mss/docs/hk_luxembourg.pdf| title=Hong Kong; The next Luxembourg | publisher=Citibank Asia|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. firms are more likely to use Singapore as their Conduit OFC to route to Hong Kong.
}}

The above five corporate tax haven Conduit OFCs, plus the three general tax haven Sink OFCs (counting the Caribbean "triad" as one major Sink OFC), are replicated at the top 8-10 corporate tax havens of many independent lists, including the [[Oxfam]] list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oxfam.org/en/research/tax-battles-dangerous-global-race-bottom-corporate-tax | title=Tax Battles: the dangerous global race to the bottom on corporate tax | publisher=Oxfam|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://d1tn3vj7xz9fdh.cloudfront.net/s3fs-public/bp-race-to-bottom-corporate-tax-121216-en.pdf | title=TAX BATTLES The dangerous global Race to the Bottom on Corporate Tax | publisher=Oxfam|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy|ITEP]] list.&lt;ref name="ITEP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itep.org/wp-content/uploads/offshoreshellgames2017.pdf|title=Offshore Shell Games 2017|page=17|publisher=Institute of Taxation and Economic Policy|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (see {{slink|#Corporate tax haven lists}}).

===Ireland as global leader===

[[Gabriel Zucman]]'s analysis differs from most other works in that it focuses on the total quantum of taxes shielded.  He shows that many of Ireland's U.S. multinationals, like Facebook, don't appear on Orbis (the source for quantitative studies, including CORPNET's) or have a small fraction of their data on Orbis (Google and Apple).

Analysed using a "quantum of funds" method (not an "Orbis corporate connections" method), Zucman shows Ireland as the largest EU-28 corporate tax haven, and the major route for Zucman's estimated annual loss of 20% in EU-28 corporate tax revenues.&lt;ref name="zuc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/TWZ2018Slides.pdf|page=68|title=The Missing Profits of Nations|publisher=Gabriel Zucman (University of Berkley)| date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zucc"/&gt;  Ireland exceeds the Netherlands in terms of "quantum" of taxes shielded, which would arguably make Ireland the largest global corporate tax haven (it even matches the combined Caribbean triad of Bermuda-British Virgin Islands-the Cayman Islands).&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/ireland-is-the-world-s-biggest-corporate-tax-haven-say-academics-1.3528401?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fireland-is-the-world-s-biggest-corporate-tax-haven-say-academics-1.3528401|title=Ireland is the world’s biggest corporate ‘tax haven’, say academics|quote=Study claims State shelters more multinational profits than the entire Caribbean|publisher=Irish Times|date=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zuc10"/&gt; See {{slink|#Zucman Corporate tax havens}}.

The rise of modern corporate tax havens, like the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Ireland and Singapore, contrasts with the failure of OECD initiatives to combat global corporate tax avoidance and BEPS activities.  There are many reasons advocated for the OECD's failure, the most common being:&lt;ref name="un1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taxjustice.net/2017/09/11/new-un-tax-handbook-sets-lower-income-countries-oecd-beps/|title=New UN tax handbook: Lower-income countries vs OECD BEPS failure|publisher=Tax Justice Network| date=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Slowness and predictability.

It has been noted in the OECD's defence, that G8 economies like the U.S. were strong supporters of the OECD's IP work, as they saw it as a tool for their domestic corporates (especially IP-heavy technology and life sciences firms), to charge-out US-based IP to international markets and thus, under U.S. bilateral tax treaties, remit untaxed profits back to the U.S.  However, when U.S. multinationals perfected these IP-based BEPS tools and worked out how to relocate them to zero-tax places such as the Caribbean or Ireland, the U.S. became less supportive (i.e. U.S. 2013 Senate investigation into Apple in Bermuda).&lt;ref name="un1"/&gt;

However, the U.S. lost further control when corporate havens such as Ireland, developed "closed-loop" IP-based BEPS systems, like the [[double Irish arrangement#Backstop of capital allowances|capital allowances for intangibles]] tool, which by-pass U.S. anti-Corporate [[tax inversion]] controls, to enable any U.S. firm (even IP-light firms) create a synthetic corporate [[tax inversion]] (and achieve 0-3% Irish [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Effective tax rate (ETR)|effective tax rates]]), without ever leaving the U.S.&lt;ref name="kpmg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ireland as a Location for Your Intellectual Property Trading Company|url = http://www.arthurcox.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Arthur-Cox-Ireland-as-a-location-for-your-IP-Trading-Company-April-20152.pdf|publisher=Arthur Cox Law|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/377485537/Maples-and-Calder-Ireland-Intellectual-Property-2018|title=Maples and Calder Irish Intellectual Property Tax Regime - 2.5% Effective Tax| publisher=Maples and Calder Law Firm|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mhc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mhc.ie/latest/e-zines/world-ip-day-2014/P1|title=World IP Day: IRELAND'S 2.5% IP Tax Rate (Section 4.1.1)|publisher=Mason Hayes and Curran|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Apple's successful $300 Q1 2015 billion IP-based Irish [[tax inversion]] (which came to be known as [[leprechaun economics]]), compares with the blocked $160 billion Pfizer-Allergan Irish [[tax inversion]].

The "closed-loop" element refers to the fact that the creation of the artificial internal [[intangible asset]] (which is critical to the [[BEPS]] tool), can be done within the confines of the Irish-office of a global accounting firm, and an Irish law firm, as well as the Irish [[Revenue Commissioners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pwc.com/ca/en/services/tax/corporate-tax/transfer-pricing/base-erosion-profit-sharing-tax-diagnostic-toolkit.html|title=Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) tax diagnostic toolkit|publisher=PriceWaterhouseCoopers|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No outside consent is needed to execute the [[BEPS]] tool (and use via Ireland's global tax-treaties), save for two situations:

===Departure of U.S. and EU===

The 2017-18 U.S. and EU Commission taxation initiatives, deliberately depart from the [[Base erosion and profit shifting (OECD project)|OECD BEPS Project]], and have their own explicit anti-IP BEPS tax regimes (as opposed to waiting for the OECD).  The U.S. GILTI and BEAT tax regimes are targeted at U.S. multinationals in Ireland,&lt;ref name="carrot"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/trump-s-us-tax-reform-a-significant-challenge-for-ireland-1.3310866|title=Trump’s US tax reform a significant challenge for Ireland|publisher=Irish Times|date=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Irish Times"/&gt; while the EU's Digital Services Tax is also directed at perceived abuses by Ireland of the EU's transfer pricing systems (particularly in regard to IP-based [[royalty payment]] charges).&lt;ref name="gnx2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/brexit/shakeup-of-eu-tax-rules-a-more-serious-threat-to-ireland-than-brexit-36130545.html |title=Shake-up of EU tax rules a 'more serious threat' to Ireland than Brexit | publisher=Irish Independent | date=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/why-ireland-faces-a-fight-on-the-corporate-tax-front-1.3426080|title=Why Ireland faces a fight on the corporate tax front|publisher=Irish Times|date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the new U.S. GILTI regime forces U.S. multinationals in Ireland to pay an effective corporate tax rate of over 12%, even with a full Irish IP BEPS tool (i.e. "single malt", whose effective Irish tax rate is circa 0%).  If they pay full Irish "headline" 12.5% corporate tax rate, the effective corporate tax rate rises to over 14%.  This is compared to a new U.S. FDII tax regime of 13.125% for U.S.-based IP, which reduces to circa 12% after the higher U.S. tax relief.&lt;ref name="example"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.scribd.com/document/379498913/Double-Irish-vs-Single-Irish-Post-the-Tax-Cuts-and-Jobs-Act-GILTI-leglislation|title=Reassessing the Beloved Double Irish Structure (as Single Malt) in Light of GILTI|publisher=Taxnotes|date=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. multinationals like Pfizer announced in Q1 2018, a post-TCJA global tax rate for 2019 of circa 17%, which is very similar to the circa 16% expected by past U.S. multinational Irish [[tax inversion]]s, Eaton, Allergan, and Medtronic.  This is the effect of Pfizer being able to use the new U.S. 13.125% FDII regime, as well as the new U.S. BEAT regime penalising non-U.S. multinationals (and past [[tax inversion]]s) by taxing income leaving the U.S. to go to low-tax [[corporate tax haven]]s like Ireland.&lt;ref name="example2"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.scribd.com/document/379507225/TCJA-US-Multinationals-Winners-and-Losers|title=U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act: Winners and Losers|page=1235|publisher=Taxnotes|date=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|“Now that [U.S.] corporate tax reform has passed, the advantages of being an inverted company are less obvious”|author=Jami Rubin, [[Goldman Sachs]], March 2018,&lt;ref name="example2"/&gt;}}

Other jurisdictions, such as Japan, are also realising the extent to which IP-based BEPS tools are being used to manage global corporate taxes.&lt;ref name="tokyo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Tokyo-targets-tax-avoidance-on-intellectual-property|title=Tokyo targets tax avoidance on intellectual property | publisher=Nikkei Asian Review | date=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. as BEPS winner===

While the U.S. exchequer has traditionally been seen as the main loser to global corporate tax havens,&lt;ref name="zucc"/&gt; the 15.5% repatriation rate of the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]] changes this calculus.

IP-heavy U.S. corporates are the main users of BEPS tools.  Studies show that as most other major economies run "territorial" tax systems, their corporates did not need to profit shift.  They could just charge-out their IP to foreign markets from their home jurisdiction at low tax rates (e.g. 5% in Germany for German corporates).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2831&amp;context=articles|title=Multinational Firms and Tax Havens|page=714|publisher=University of Michigan Law School|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, there are no non-U.S./non-U.K. foreign corporates in Ireland's top 50 firms by revenues, and only one by employees, German retailer Lidl (whereas 14 of Ireland's top 20 firms are U.S. multinationals).&lt;ref name="itb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.top1000.ie/companies| title=Ireland's Top 1000 Companies | publisher=Irish Times| date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.K. firms are mainly pre {{slink|#U.K. transformation}}.  (discussed [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Multinational tax schemes|here]]).

Had U.S. multinationals not used IP-based BEPS tools in corporate tax havens, and paid the circa 25% corporation tax (average OECD rate)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://taxfoundation.org/us-has-highest-corporate-income-tax-rate-oecd/|title=The U.S. Has the Highest Corporate Income Tax Rate in the OECD|publisher=Tax Foundation|date=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; abroad, the U.S. exchequer would have only received an additional 10% in tax (to bring the total effective U.S. worldwide tax rate to 35%). However, post the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|TCJA]], the U.S. exchequer is now getting more tax, at the higher 15.5% rate, and their U.S. corporations have avoided the 25% foreign taxes (and therefore will have brought more capital back to the U.S. as result, which will contribute to the U.S. economy in other ways).

This is at the expense of higher-tax Europe and Asian countries (who received no taxes from U.S. corporations, as they used IP-based BEPS tools from bases in corporate tax havens).

The U.S. did not sign the OECD's June 2017 [[Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting|MLI]], as it felt that it had low exposure to profit shifting.

{{quote|"The U.S. didn’t sign the groundbreaking tax treaty inked by 68 [later 70] countries in Paris June 7 [2017] because the U.S. tax treaty network has a low degree of exposure to base erosion and profit shifting issues", a U.S. Department of Treasury official said at a transfer pricing conference co-sponsored by Bloomberg BNA and [[Baker McKenzie]] in Washington | author=Bloomberg BNA, "Treasury Official Explains Why U.S. Didn’t Sign OECD Super-Treaty", 8 June 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bna.com/treasury-official-explains-n73014453413/ | title=Treasury Official Explains Why U.S. Didn’t Sign OECD Super-Treaty | publisher=Bloomberg BNA | date=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This beneficial effect of global tax havens to the U.S exchequer was predicted by the ground-breaking Hines-Rice 1994 paper on tax havens.&lt;ref name="h3"/&gt;

==Corporate tax haven lists==

===Types of corporate tax haven lists===

Before 2015, many lists are of general tax havens (i.e. individual and corporate).  Post 2015, quantative studies (e.g. CORPNET and [[Gabriel Zucman]]), have highlighted the greater scale of corporate tax haven activity.&lt;ref name="zuc10"/&gt;  The OECD, who only list one jurisdiction in the world as a tax haven, Trinidad and Tobago, note the scale of corporate tax haven activity.&lt;ref name="BEPS Background"/&gt;  Note that the IMF list of [[offshore financial centres]] ("OFC") is often cited as the first list to include the main corporate tax havens and the term OFC and corporate tax haven are often used interchangeably.&lt;ref name="x1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.academic-foresights.com/Tax_Havens.pdf|quote=Some experts see no difference between tax havens and OFCs, and employ the terms interchangeably. |title=RONEN PALEN: Tax Havens and Offshore Financial Centres|publisher=University of Birmingham|date=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ten major corporate tax havens===

Regardless of method, most corporate tax haven lists consistently repeat ten jurisdictions (sometimes the Caribbean "triad" is one group), which comprise: 
{{ordered list|type=lower-roman
|Four modern corporate tax havens (have non-zero "headline" tax rates; require "substance"/{{slink|#Employment tax}}; have broad tax treaty networks):{{ordered list|start=1 |Ireland;|the Netherlands;|United Kingdom (top 10 2017 global financial centre);|Singapore (top 10 2017 global financial centre).}}
|Three general corporate tax havens (offer some traditional tax-haven type services; often have restricted bilateral tax treaties):{{ordered list |start=5|Luxembourg (top 15 2017 global financial centre);|Hong Kong (top 10 2017 global financial centre);|Switzerland (top 10 2017 global financial centre).}}
|Three very traditional corporate tax havens (open on zero-tax status; no requirement for {{slink|#Employment tax}}/"substance"; limited tax treaties):{{ordered list |start=8|Bermuda;| the Cayman Islands;|and the British Virgin Islands. (Caribbean "triad").}} 
}}

Note four of these ten jurisdictions have [[financial centres]] that appear in 2017 top 10 [[Global Financial Centres Index]]: London, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Zurich.  Luxembourg was in the top 15.

Note also from [[Conduit and Sink OFCs]], that the latter groups (ii ex. Switzerland, and iii), rely on the first group (i), to act as a conduit in rerouting corporate untaxed income.  In this regard, Ireland, the Netherlands, Singapore and the U.K., are considered the most important corporate tax havens, and the "source" of most global corporate tax avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/these-five-countries-are-conduits-for-the-worlds-biggest-tax-havens-79555|title=These five countries are conduits for the world’s biggest tax havens|publisher=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]|date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their larger size, it is not uncommon to see Switzerland and the United Kingdom dropped from more informal references to the main tax havens, for example:

===Hines Corporate tax havens===

[[James R. Hines Jr.]] is a founder of research into tax havens.  His area of expertise is the U.S. corporate taxation system, and much of his research is on U.S. multinational use of tax havens.  In 2010, Hines produced a table of U.S. multinational investment in havens, and produced the following ranking of the ten largest U.S. corporate tax havens:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.ie/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1716&amp;context=articles|title=Treasure Islands|author=James Hines|quote=Table 2: International Portfolio Investment|page=106|publisher=University of Michigan|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tax haven academic [[Gabriel Zucman]]'s (et alia) June 2018 list calculates the actual quantum of actual taxes shielded (versus counting legal Orbis database connections, or company subsidiaries) by profit shifting.  Ireland now exceeds the aggregate Caribbean complex (ex. Bermuda), in terms of being the largest overall global corporate tax haven (see {{slink|#Financial impact}}).&lt;ref name="gabrielzucman"/&gt;  Ireland is also the largest EU-28 corporate tax haven.  Ireland's effective tax rate is really 4%. The U.K. is a notable absence.

===CORPNET Corporate tax havens===
{{main|Conduit and Sink OFCs}}
From the 2017 investigation, published in [[Nature (magazine)|Nature]], into [[Conduit and Sink OFCs]], comes CORPNET's top 5 [[Conduit and Sink OFCs#Conduit OFC|Conduit OFCs]] (i.e. corporate tax haven proxy), and top 5 [[Conduit and Sink OFCs#Sink OFC|Sink OFCs]] (i.e. traditional tax haven proxy), as calculated by analysing over 71 million global corporate connections on the Orbis database (i.e. it is by number of connections, not specifically by quantum of taxes shielded).  Even though the method is different, CORPNET captures all of Zucman's list but separated into Conduits and Sinks (and breaks out the Caribbean), however, Zucman's list has a different ranking:

===ITEP Corporate tax havens===
The first [[Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy]] list (Figure 1, page 11), is based on the % of Fortune 500 companies with subsidiaries in the corporate tax haven in 2016.  The drawback of the list is that it is a  U.S. focused list, and focuses on the number of connections (i.e. or subsidiaries) rather than the scale of taxes shielded. Contains all of Zucman's list, but with Mauritius and Panama added as well.&lt;ref name="ITEP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itep.org/wp-content/uploads/offshoreshellgames2017.pdf|title=Offshore Shell Games 2017|page=17|publisher=Institute of Taxation and Economic Policy|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

The second [[Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy]] list (Figure 4, page 16), is based on the reported profits of U.S. Fortune 500 controlled subsidiaries in 2013.  It tries to capture the scale of taxes shielded by looking at reported profits as a proxy.  Ireland now jumps to 2nd place, only just behind the Netherlands. The Netherlands-Ireland-Bermuda are usually the jurisdictions behind most "[[double Irish]] with a [[Dutch sandwich]]" BEPS schemes.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;  Identical list to Zucman's list but with the Caribbean broken out into individual jurisdictions (the Caymans, Bermuda, Bahamas and the BVI).&lt;ref name="ITEP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itep.org/wp-content/uploads/offshoreshellgames2017.pdf|title=Offshore Shell Games 2017|page=17|publisher=Institute of Taxation and Economic Policy|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxfam Corporate tax havens===
The [[Oxfam]] list is based on a qualitative and quantitative data in 2016.  The list is not focused on just scale, it is also looking for particularly loose jurisdictions.  However, it still effectively contains all of Zucman's list with the addition of Curaco and Cyprus, who scored particularly poorly on qualitative aspects of their tax regimes (i.e. very loose controls but not used to the same scale as other jurisdictions).&lt;ref name="oxf1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oxf2"/&gt;

===Bloomberg Corporate tax inversions===

A simple but effective proxy are the destinations to where U.S. multinationals execute [[tax inversion]]s (i.e. an important test of the attractiveness of a corporate tax haven).  However, cases like inversions to Canada could reflect more of a "relative-tax" view (i.e. Canada offers lower taxes than the U.S. and it is close by and less controversial), than an "absolute-tax" view on the best global locations for a corporate tax haven.  The list still captures much of Zucman's list, particularly for the EU and the Caribbean. It captures the popularity of Ireland and the rise of the U.K.

Destinations for the 85 U.S. corporate inversions, since the first inversion in 1982, to the most recent inversion in 2016:&lt;ref name="bbb"/&gt;
{{ordered list|type=lower-roman

==GDP-per-capita tax haven proxy==
{{see also|List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita}}

One of the simpler, but effective, methods proposed of identifying tax havens (both corporate and traditional) is by tracking the distortion that the tax-driven accounting flows make on national economic flows.&lt;ref name="imfx"/&gt;  This is an effect that is particularly pronounced for corporate tax havens due to the larger scale of accounting flows from the larger {{slink|#IP-based BEPS tools}} and {{slink|#Debt-based BEPS tools}}.&lt;ref name="ber"/&gt;  The following tables of the world's top 15 GDP-per-capita jurisdictions are taken from the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita]] for 2017 (from the IMF) and 2016 (from the World Bank).
{{ordered list|type=lower-roman
| 6 of the top 10 global tax havens from the {{slink|#Ten major tax havens}}, are represented;
| 3 of these top 10 global tax havens, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands are not ranked by the IMF or the World Bank in their GDP-per-capita tables.
| The remaining top 10 global tax haven, the U.K., is ranked 21 and 26 (respectively); it is possible the U.K.'s transition is not complete (see {{slink|#U.K. transformation}}).
| 4 of the 5 major [[Conduit and Sink OFCs#Conduit OFC|Conduit OFCs]] are represented (again, only the U.K. is missing).
| The outliers in the table are jurisdictions whose economies are neither based on being a widely accepted tax haven or having oil &amp; gas reserves.
| The same table, but at GDP (Nominal) values, ranks the tax havens even higher (at the expense of the smaller resource nations).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3710">'''Crioestaminal - Saúde e Tecnologia, SA''', was founded in 2003, becoming the first umbilical cord blood bank in the [[Iberian Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crioestaminal.pt Crioestaminal - Saúde e Tecnologia, SA]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it has developed into the largest [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and one of the five largest cryo-preservation banks in Europe with over 60,000 stored samples. Crioestaminal was the first company to be authorized by the Portuguese Ministry of Health and is the only family bank with an [[AABB|AABB (American Association of Blood Banks)]] accreditation in Portugal. In Europe, there are only five banks with an AABB accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aabb.org/sa/facilities/celltherapy/Pages/CordBloodAccrFac.aspx AABB - American Association of Blood Banks]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Crioestaminal was founded by a group of scientists and health care professionals in 2003.

In 2006, Crioestaminal opened its state-of-the-art laboratory in the [[:pt:Cantanhede (Portugal)#Biocant Park|Biocant Park]], Portugal first Biotechnology Park.

During the same year, Crioestaminal founded a company focused molecular biology diagnostics: ''Genelab – Diagnóstico Molecular''.

In 2007, Crioestaminal released a first sample to be used in a transplant. The cord blood stem cells were used to treat a child with [[Severe combined immunodeficiency|Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)]]. The sample belonged to the child’s sibling and had been stored since 2003.

In 2009, The Riverside Group became the company’s main shareholder. During the last years, the US investment company has contributed to Crioestaminal’s growth in Portugal and abroad.

Crioestaminal acquired ''Celvitae'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140226203205/http://www.celvitae.es/es/ Official website of Celvitae]&lt;/ref&gt; a Spanish company, in 2010 to strengthen its presence in the neighboring country.

In 2013, Crioestaminal announced a new investment project that will transform the company into the second-largest [[Cord blood bank|cord blood and tissue cryopreservation bank]] in Europe by storage capacity. During the same year, the company won the customer choice award ''Escolha do Consumidor''.

== Research and development ==
Crioestaminal invests a significant share of its revenues in R&amp;D projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovery is in our DNA|url=http://www1.biocant.pt/pbioportugal/brochura_digital.pdf|accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The projects aim to develop stem cell-based therapies to further expand the number the clinical applications of cord blood and tissue. It has built a network of partnerships with local institutions such as [Instituto Superior Técnico|Instituto Superior Técnico de Lisboa],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131111041329/http://www.cnbc.pt/default.asp?lg=1 Centro de Neurociências e Biologia Celular da Universidade de Coimbra]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Centro de Histocompatibilidade do Centro.

In 2012, Crioestaminal received its first patent for a technology based on cord blood stem cells. The invention is a formulation containing a gel and cord blood stem cells that can be used to treat chronic wounds in [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetic patients]]. The investigation was led by Lino Ferreira, a scientist from the Centro de Neurociências e Biologia Celular da Universidade de Coimbra.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131111041329/http://www.cnbc.pt/default.asp?lg=1 Seminário - Inhibition of DPP-IV: a new therapeutic approach for diabetic retinopathy?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Practice Assessment''' is a pan-European development for [[quality management]] in primary health care. The scaffolding is a set of indicators, that EPA instrument enables
[[General practice|general practitioners]] to compare and to improve the organisation and management of their practices. It is based on an extended review of the international
literature on assessment models for [[primary care]], with special attention
to the Dutch model of practice visits.

== Aims ==
EPA's key aspects of activity are the development and validation of a set of indicators and tools describing the organisational aspects of  primary care practices. It was initiated in [http://www.equip.ch/ EQuiP], and the first set of indicators was developed through an international study by the EQuiP countries (2001–2004). Since 2005 it will be evaluated every three years.
The intention of the EPA instrument as a [[Quality Management System|quality management system]] is to allow management and organization of medical practices to be measured and evaluated at regional, national and nternational levels with an educational approach.

== History ==
Based on the TOPAS research project, the continuous development of EPA instruments started 2001. In autumn 2003 EPA as an instrument came into operation in nine countries.

Within a framework of an [http://fampra.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/1/137.abstract|international project] the idea of an indicator-based instrument proved to give internationally valid, reliable and feasible
results for quality improvement in [[primary health care]].  
The following nine countries took part in the study and the further development:  Belgium, France, Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Slovenia, Austria and Israel.

== Practice ==
encouraged several organisations to establish the European Practice Assessment model as an offer for high quality practice management on a national base. From six European countries leading institutes with experience in research in quality of primary health care and practice visits  collaborate in the European Practice Assessment project: 
*Belgium: Flemish Institute of General Practice WWVH, Antwerp
*France: ANAES, Paris
*Germany: [http://www.aqua-institut.de/ AQUA-Institute] on Applied Quality Improvement and Research in Health Care, Göttingen
*Netherlands: Centre for Quality of Care Research [http://www.wokresearch.nl/ WOK], University of Nijmegen/University Maastricht
*Switzerland: [http://www.swisspep.ch/ swisspep] Institute for Quality and  Research in Health Care, Gümlingen
*UK:  Department of General Practice, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff
*National Primary Care Research and Development Centre [http://www.npcrdc.ac.uk/ NPCRDC], Manchester

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2081">An '''executory contract''' is a [[contract]] that has not yet been fully performed or fully executed. It is a contract in which both sides still have important performance remaining. However, an obligation to pay money, even if such obligation is material, does not usually make a contract executory. An obligation is material if a [[breach of contract]] would result from the failure to satisfy the obligation.&lt;ref name=bankruptcy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bankruptcy.cooley.com/2006/07/articles/business-bankruptcy-issues/executory-contracts-what-are-they-and-why-do-they-matter-in-bankruptcy/|title=Executory Contracts -- What Are They And Why Do They Matter In Bankruptcy?|author=Bob Eisenbach|publisher=In the (Red)|date=July 18, 2006|accessdate=2007-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A contract that has been fully performed by one party but not by the other party is an executory contract.

==In US bankruptcy law==
In [[US bankruptcy law]], "executory contract" assumes a special meaning, a contract in which continuing obligations exist ''on both sides'' of the contract at the time of the bankruptcy petition. It still requires both debtor and counterparty to make further performance. A [[trustee in bankruptcy|trustee]] or [[debtor in possession]] may assume any prepetition executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor, preserving obligations of both the debtor and the counterparts by the bankruptcy process. If he rejects it, there is a [[breach of contract]] as of the date of the petition.&lt;ref name=bankruptcy /&gt; Affirmation and rejection are subject to court approval.&lt;ref name=bankruptcy /&gt; {{UnitedStatesCode|11|365}}.

==Installment contracts==
Many installment contracts are commonly executors such as [[installment credit]] loans, period loan payments, [[mortgage loan|mortgages]], and paychecks.

==Early life==
Mabuza-Suttle was born in [[Sophiatown]], a black neighbourhood in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, during the [[apartheid]] era. Her grandfather, Ben Mabuza, raised her and was a major inspiration for her later success. Meanwhile, her father, who owned one of the first driving schools in the nation, provided a steady income for the family. During her childhood she became interested in dance, which became a lifelong pursuit.&lt;ref name="answers.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.answers.com/topic/felicia-mabuza-suttle | title=Felicia Mabuza-Suttle | publisher=Gale Contemporary Black Biography | accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
In the 1960s and 70s, a large number of black South Africans went overseas to study to evade the apartheid regime. Mabuza-Suttle was amongst them, studying at [[Marquette University]] in the United States. In the 80s, she became the first member of her family to achieve a college degree when she earned a BA in Journalism, followed by an MA in Mass Communication.&lt;ref name="answers.com" /&gt;

As well as studying, Mabuza-Suttle also wrote for the ''World Newspaper'', where she met prominent anti-apartheid activists, including [[Steve Biko]], the leader of the [[Black Consciousness Movement]]. This would lead to her becoming politically involved when she returned to South Africa.&lt;ref name="answers.com" /&gt;

==Career in South Africa==
Mabuza-Suttle returned for a short time to South Africa in 1982 to work for Radio Bophutatswana, where she was criticised for being politically incorrect.&lt;ref name="answers.com" /&gt;

In 1990, Mabuza-Suttle returned permanently to South Africa, accepting a position at the [[South African Airways]]. In 1992, she began her television career after being offered a job as a talk show host at the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]]. Talk shows were a fairly new concept in South Africa at the time, and her show rapidly became successful. Originally known as ''Top Level'', its name was changed to ''The Felicia Show'' in 1995, and was again renamed simply ''Felicia'' in 2000 (accompanying a move to ETV, the largest South African English-language channel). The show focused mainly on social topics, but also ventured into entertainment.&lt;ref name="answers.com" /&gt;

However, amidst criticisms that her show was too similar to [[The Oprah Winfrey Show]], ''Felicia'' closed down in 2004. Mabuza-Suttle moved her show to the United States, where it was broadcast as ''Conversations with Felicia'' on [[The Africa Channel]]. It still focused mainly on South African personalities.&lt;ref name="Channel 24"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/What-happened-to-Felicia-Mabuza-Suttle-20090401 | title=What happened to Felicia Mabuza-Suttle? | publisher=Channel 24 | date=1 April 2009 | accessdate=28 August 2013 | author=Simpson, Ashlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrepreneurship==
Propelled by her success on television, Mabuza-Suttle founded several business ventures, including the ''Felicia'' brand of clothing and accessories, Pamodzi Investments, FMS Productions, and Back of the Moon, a restaurant. She has been involved in philanthropic activities, including donating a portion of her eyewear profits to an anti-drug and anti-crime campaign.&lt;ref name="answers.com" /&gt;

However, in 2012, she liquidated Back of the Moon for various reasons, including economic and legal difficulties, and disagreements with her business partner and landlord.&lt;ref name="sundayworld" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Mabuza-Suttle married Earl Suttle in 1976. She lives in Johannesburg, while Earl Suttle lives in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. They have two children, Lindiwe and Zanele.&lt;ref name="answers.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Edgars Club"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.edgarsclub.co.za/whats-new/magazine/like-mother-like-daughter/ | title=Interview with Lindiwe and Felicia Mabuza-Suttle | publisher=Edgars Club | date=9 May 2013 | accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barton served with the [[Irish Guards]] and fought in the [[Second World War]]. He retired from the military in 1944 as a Lt. Colonel and returned to work for Jardine Matheson after the war.

A persistent and flamboyant character, he was appointed Taipan of Jardines, replacing Sir John Keswick. During his tenure, he oversaw the incredible growth of the company in Hong Kong and throughout Asia after the devastating war years and continued trade with China. He also served as a director of the [[Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation]] from 1955 to 1959, Vice Chairman from 1960 to 1961. It's also interesting to note that he also served as the Chairman of the bank from 1962 to 1963, holding the chairmanship title of both the bank and Jardines. As taipan of Jardines, he oversaw the opening of the company headquarters in 1956 along [[Connaught Road]], a 16-story building which was already replaced in 1972.

He is best remembered for the historic and landmark event of leading Jardines to its [[initial public offering]]. Initially distributing the shares at $2.78, within a week it shot up to $5.22, having been oversubscribed 56 times. 

During his tenure, Jardines owned much of the richest land in Hong Kong, controlled two of the island's three profitable English newspapers, and has substantial interests in banking, shipping, insurance, utilities, streetcars and airlines and being agent for 77 major companies, trading products ranging from machine tools to fine Scotch throughout Asia. He sat in Hong Kong's governing bodies and the boards of its richest banks. He presided over a time when Jardine Matheson was at the peak of its economic and political power over Hong Kong.

He founded the Penta Hotel Chain, supported by five airlines: [[Swiss Air]], [[Alitalia]], [[Air France]], [[British Airways]] and [[Lufthansa]] Airlines. Eventually, Air France and Alitalia backed out of the deal. The Hotel chain was also supported by UBS, Swiss Bank, Deutsch Bank and a British investment Bank. The Pental Hotel chain still exists but mainly in Germany.

In a [[Time Magazine]] article in 1961, he was described as "Tall (6 ft. 3 in.), suave and social, [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge-educated]] Hugh Barton joined Jardines in 1933 as a tea taster, scrupulously lives up to the company's cherished traditions, including the raising of ponies that race under the Jardines' silks." After retiring in 1963, he became an influential diplomat in Europe, representing Hong Kong businesses' interests there. 

In 1965, he became a director of [[S.G. Warburg]]. He was invested as a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in 1966. In describing Jardines, a commentator stated, "Jardines always was, and still is, a Scottish house that kept the Sabbath and everything else it could lay hands on." He died in April 1989 at the age of 78.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p26834.htm The Peerage: Hugh David MacEwen Barton]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tan Sri Kong Hon Kong.jpg|thumb|Tan Sri Kong Hon Kong ]]
[[Malay styles and titles|Tan Sri]] '''Kong Hon Kong''' (Chinese name: 丹斯里鄺漢光; born in 1954), is a prominent [[Malaysian Chinese]] businessman, who founded Nirvana Asia Group, the largest integrated [[Death care industry|bereavement care of FUNERAL]] service provider in [[MALAYSIA]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nirvana-asia-ltd.com/company/nirvana-asia-ltd/ Nirvana Asia]: According to Frost &amp; Sullivan, in terms of contract sales, revenue and land bank in 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tan Sri Kong Hon Kong has been the Nirvana Asia Group [[Executive director|Executive Director]] since October 1990 and was appointed as the Nirvana Asia Ltd [[Managing Director]] and [[Chief executive officer|Chief Executive Officer]] in February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nirvana-asia-ltd.com/company/founder/ Nirvana Asia:] Founder - Tan Sri Kong Hon Kong.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the founder of the Group, Tan Sri Kong has been the driving behind development, growth and expansion, and is primarily responsible for formulating the overall development strategies and [[business plan]]s of the Group.

==Early life==

Tan Sri Kong Hon Kong was born in [[Kuala Lipis]], a small town who had previously been an important location for the rubber industry, in the district of [[Lipis]], [[Pahang]] state, [[Malaysia]] in 1954.

In 1990, he meet he secured an unprecedented license to develop 50 acres of land in [[Semenyih]] district near [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia, into a private garden-like, scenic memorial park. As a result, a new landmark called Nirvana Memorial Park, began to grace the landscape of Semenyih. The 797-acre memorial park has since become a prominent feature that gains a huge following and revolutionized the [[death care industry]] in Malaysia. With the ever-increasing demand for a graceful yet dignified final resting place, Nirvana Asia Group fledged into an unassailable leading position within a short span of time across the region, establishing a network of 12 local and 7 overseas branches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nirvana-asia-ltd.com/homepage/ Nirvana Asia Group official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==

He was first inspired to go into business when his father-in-law died in 1985. Tasked to choose a burial plot, he visited a [[cemetery]] managed by the local associations since at that time there were no private cemeteries in Malaysia. The awkwardness of having to walk around the overcrowded cemetery inspired him to do something about the lacklustre way of how the conventional cemeteries were managed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://top10malaysia.com/main/2015/09/10/tan-sri-kong-hon-kong/ Triumphing Over The ‘Impossible’]: Top 10 of Asia magazine. Issue 9/2015. p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tan Sri Kong was granted the license to operate a private cemetery five years later and opened Nirvana Memorial Park in Semenyih. The cemetery was landscaped to promote serenity and is today a key tourist attraction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://top10malaysia.com/main/2015/09/10/tan-sri-kong-hon-kong/ Triumphing Over The ‘Impossible’:] Top 10 of Asia magazine. Issue 9/2015. p.20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, Nirvana Asia was listed on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]]. “We managed to raise RM1 billion without much difficulty. That would not be so easy in Malaysia. Our Hong Kong platform is definitely a key advantage for us to expand our wings overseas,” he remarked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestar.com.my/Business/Business-News/2015/09/26/Aiming-to-be-global-funeral-leader/?style=biz Aiming to be global ‘funeral’ leader:] The Star newspaper.

In 2012, Nirvana Asia Group was named “Asia’s Outstanding Brand in Funeral Service Industry” and “Asia’s Outstanding Award in Multi National Expansion” at the 2012 Asia Funeral Expo (AFE) Awards Ceremony. In 2013, the Group became Malaysia’s torchbearer in the bereavement care industry once again, having won the “Corporate Social Responsibility Award” and “Marketing Strategy Award” at the 2013 Asian Funeral Exhibition (AFE Awards).&lt;ref&gt;The Winners of the [http://www.verticalexpo.com/eeditor_upload/file/AFE_2012/AFE%20Awards%202012-%20announcement.pdf AFE Awards 2012].

== Philanthropy ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2584">'''Louis-Ulysse Chopard''' (May 4, 1836 – January 30, 1915) was a Swiss [[watchmaker]] and founder of [[Chopard]].

Louis-Ulysse Chopard was the second son of Félicien Chopard and his wife Henriette, who had four children. The father of Louis-Ulysse Chopard, Félicien, was an experienced farmer and a man of tradition who encouraged his sons to learn the watchmaking trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/swiss-jeweller-watchmaker-chopard-switzerland-watch-timepieces/1/214350.html| title=Discover the Origins of Chopard| newspaper=India Today| accessdate=8 June 2014| first=Varoon| last=Anand| date=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young man, Louis-Ulysse Chopard quickly grasped the fact that it was the comptoirs or watch dealerships that earned the greatest profit from the work of the framers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.luxos.com/magazine/brand-history-chopard-andquot-a-passion-for-excellence| journal=Luxos magazine| title=Brand History - Chopard| accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each spring, the agents picked up the [[Movement (clockwork)|movements]], fitted the dials and hands, cased up the finished movements and they marketed the finished watches. It was therefore better to work independently and Louis-Ulysse wanted his own brand. He created his L.U.C manufacturing company in [[Sonvilier]], [[Switzerland]] at the age of 24, in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.interwatches.com/chopard-history| publisher=Interwatches| title=History of Chopard| accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No watches were mass-produced but his clever blend of artistry and functionality soon won over a large number of customers. Having grasped that foreign markets represented the future of his timepieces, he set off to canvass customers in [[Eastern Europe]], [[Russia]] and [[Scandinavia]]. In 1912, he visited [[Poland]], [[Hungary]] and the [[Netherlands]] with his finest creations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.chopard.com/en/chopard/atraditionofexcellence.aspx| title=Chopard - A Tradition of Excellence| publisher=Chopard| accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chopard [[Chronometer watch|chronometers]] and watches marked the passing of time at the court of [[Nicholas II of Russia]]. Louis-Ulysse Chopard had won himself an international clientele.

In 1859 and 1870 he had two children, Paul-Louis and Ida Hélène.

'''Market research''' is any organized effort to gather information about [[target markets]] or customers.  It is a very important component of [[business strategy]].&lt;ref name="McQuarrie"&gt;{{Citation  | last = McQuarrie | first = Edward | title = The market research toolbox: a concise guide for beginners  | place =  | publisher = SAGE  | year = 2005 | edition = 2nd  | url = https://books.google.com/?id=qYW8vE0nx4gC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22market+research%22&amp;q=%22gather%20information%20about%22  | isbn = 978-1-4129-1319-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The term is commonly interchanged with [[marketing research]]; however, expert practitioners may wish to draw a distinction, in that ''marketing'' research is concerned specifically about marketing processes, while ''market'' research is concerned specifically with markets.&lt;ref name="McDonald"&gt;{{Citation  | last = McDonald  | first = Malcolm | title = Marketing Plans  | place = Oxford, England  | publisher = Butterworth-Heinemann  | year = 2007   | edition = 6th  | url = https://books.google.com/?id=os0K20MsepoC&amp;pg=PA364&amp;dq=%22market+research+vs.+marketing+research%22&amp;q=  | isbn = 978-0-7506-8386-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market research is one of the main factors used in maintaining competitiveness over [[competitors]]. Market research provides important information to identify and analyze the market need, market size and competition. Market-research techniques encompass both qualitative techniques such as focus groups, in-depth interviews, and ethnography, as well as quantitative techniques such as customer surveys, and analysis of secondary data.

Market research, which includes social and opinion research, is the systematic gathering and interpretation of information about individuals or organizations using statistical and analytical methods and techniques of the applied social sciences to gain insight or support decision making.&lt;ref&gt;ICC/ESOMAR (2008),  ''International Code on Market and Social Research''.

==History==
Market research started to be conceptualized and put into formal practice during the 1920s, as an offshoot of the advertising boom of the [[Old-time radio|Golden Age of radio]] in the [[United States]].  Advertisers began to realize the significance of [[demographic]]s revealed by sponsorship of different radio programs.

==Market research for business/planning==
Market research is a way of getting an overview of consumers' wants, needs and beliefs. It can also involve discovering how they act. The research can be used to determine how a product could be marketed.  [[Peter Drucker]] believed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 |quote=There will always, one can assume, be need for some selling. But the aim of marketing is to make selling superfluous. The aim of marketing is to know and understand the customer so well that the product or service fits him and sells itself. Ideally, marketing should result in a customer who is ready to buy. All that should be needed then is to make the product or service available...
}}&lt;/ref&gt; market research to be the quintessence of marketing.
Market research is a way that producers and the marketplace study the consumer and gather information about the consumers' needs.
There are two major types of market research: primary research, which is sub-divided into [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[qualitative research|qualitative]] research, and [[secondary research]].

Factors that can be investigated through market research include:
*[[Market information systems|Market information]]:  Through market information one can know the prices of different commodities in the market, as well as the supply and demand situation. Market researchers have a wider role than previously recognized by helping their clients to understand social, technical, and even legal aspects of markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Marketing Theory |year=2013 |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=245–261 |title=Assembling Market Representations |author=Diaz Ruiz, C. A. |doi=10.1177/1470593113487744  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Market segmentation]]: Market segmentation is the division of the market or population into subgroups with similar motivations. It is widely used for segmenting on geographic differences, demographic differences (age, gender, ethnicity, etc.), [[technographic]] differences, [[psychographic]] differences, and differences in product use. For B2B segmentation [[firmographics]] is commonly used.
*[[Market trend]]s: Market trends are the upward or downward movement of a market, during a period of time.  Determining the market size may be more difficult if one is starting with a new innovation. In this case, you will have to derive the figures from the number of potential customers, or customer segments.&lt;ref&gt;Ilar 1998&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=November 2018}}
*[[SWOT analysis]]: SWOT is a written analysis of the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats to a business entity. A SWOT may also be written up for the competition to understand how to develop the marketing and product mixes.

Another factor that can be measured is [[marketing effectiveness]]. This includes:
* Customer analysis (Segmentation of target customers)
* [[Choice modelling]]
* [[Competitor analysis]]
* [[Risk analysis (business)|Risk analysis]]
* Product research
* Advertisement research
* [[Marketing mix modeling]]
* Simulated test marketing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wherry|first=Julie|title=Simulated Test Marketing: Its Evolution and Current State in the Industry|url=https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/37225}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market research for the film industry==
It is important to test marketing material for films to see how an audience will receive it.  There are several market research practices that may be used:

# concept testing, which evaluates reactions to a film idea and is fairly rare;
# positioning studios, which analyze a script for marketing opportunities;
# focus groups, which probe viewers' opinions about a film in small groups prior to release;
# test screenings, which involve the previewing of films prior to theatrical release;
# tracking studies, which gauge (often by telephone polling) an audience's awareness of a film on a weekly basis prior to and during theatrical release;
# advertising testing, which measures responses to marketing materials such as trailers and television advertisements;
# exit surveys, that measure audience reactions after seeing the film in the cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drake|first=Philip|title=Distribution and Marketing in Contemporary Hollywood |year=2008 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Malden, MA |isbn=978-1-4051-3388-3 |pages=63–82 |editor=McDonald &amp; Wasko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence from the Internet==
The availability of research by way of the Internet has influenced a vast number of consumers using this media; for gaining knowledge relating to virtually every type of available product and service. It has been added to by the [[growth factor]] of emerging [[global markets]], such as China, Indonesia and Russia, which is significantly exceeding that of the established and more advanced [[B2B e-commerce]] markets. Various statistics show that the increasing demands of consumers are reflected not only in the wide and varied range of general Internet researching applications, but in online shopping research penetration.

This is stimulated by product-enhancing websites, graphics, and content designed to attract casual "surfing" shoppers, researching for their particular needs, competitive prices and quality. According to the [[Small Business Administration]] (SBA), a successful business is significantly contributed to by gaining knowledge about customers, competitors, and the associated industry. Market research creates not only this understanding, but is the process of [[data analysis]] regarding which products and services are in demand.

The convenience and easy accessibility of the Internet has created a global [[B2C]] e-commerce research facility, for a vast online shopping network that has motivated retail markets in [[developed countries]]. In 2010 between [[US$]]400 billion and $600 billion in revenue was generated by this medium. It was anticipated that in 2015 this online market w generate between $700 billion and $950 billion.

Beyond online web-based market research activities, the Internet has also influenced high-street modes of data collection by, for example, replacing the traditional paper [[clipboard]] with online survey providers. Over the last 5 years, mobile surveys have become increasingly popular. Mobile has opened the door to innovative new methods of engaging respondents, such as social voting communities.

==Research and social media applications==
The UK Market Research Society (MRS) reports research has shown that on average, the three [[social media]] platforms primarily used by [[Millennials]] are [[LinkedIn]], [[Facebook]] and [[YouTube]].  Social Media applications, according to [[T-Systems]], help generate the [[Business-to-business|B2B]] E-commerce market and develop electronic business process efficiency. This application is a highly effective vehicle for market research, which combined with E-commerce, is now regarded as a separate, extremely profitable field of global business. While many B2B business models are being updated, the various advantages and benefits offered by Social Media platforms are being integrated within them.

Business intelligence organization have compiled a comprehensive report related to global online retail sales, defining continued growth patterns and trends in the industry. Headed "Global B2C E-Commerce and Online Payment Market 2014" the report perceives a decrease in overall growth rates in North America and Western Europe, as the expected growth in the online market sales, is absorbed into the emerging markets. It is forecast that the Asia-[[Pacific region]] will see the fastest growth in the B2C E-Commerce market and replace North America as the B2C E-Commerce sales region leader, within a few years. This effectively, offers a significant, motivational platform for new [[Internet services]], to promote user market research-friendly applications.

==Research and market sectors==

The primary online sale providers in B2C E-Commerce, worldwide, includes the USA based [[Amazon.com]] Inc. which remains the E-Commerce revenues, global leader. The growth leaders in the world top ten are two online companies from China, both of which conducted [[Initial Public Offering]] (IPO) this year; Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD Inc. Another company from the top ten is Cnova N.V., a recently formed E-Commerce subsidiary of the French Group Casino, with various store retailers developing and expanding their [[E-Commerce]] facilities worldwide. It is a further indication of how consumers are increasingly being attracted to the opportunities of online researching and expanding their awareness of what is available to them.

Service providers; for example those related to finance, foreign [[market trade]] and investment promote a variety of information and research opportunities to online users. In addition, they provide comprehensive and competitive strategies with market research tools, designed to promote worldwide business opportunities for [[entrepreneurs]] and established providers. General access, to accurate and supported market research facilities, is a critical aspect of business development and success today.  The Marketing Research Association was founded in 1957 and is recognized as one of the leading and prominent associations in the opinion and marketing research profession. It serves the purpose of providing insights and intelligence that helps businesses make decisions regarding the provision of products and services to consumers and industries.

This organization knowledge of market conditions and competition is gained by researching relevant sectors, which provide advantages for entry into new and established industries. It enables effective strategies to be implemented; the assessment of global environments in the service sectors, as well as foreign [[market trade]] and investment barriers! Research, is utilized for promoting export opportunities and [[inward investment]], helping determine how to execute competitive strategies, focus on objective policies and strengthen global opportunities. It is a medium that influences, administrates and enforces agreements, preferences, leveling trading environments and competitiveness in the [[international marketplace]].

The retail industry aspect of online market research, is being transformed worldwide by [[M-Commerce]] with its mobile audience, rapidly increasing as the volume and varieties of products purchased on the mobile medium, increases. Researches conducted in the markets of North America and Europe, revealed that the M-Commerce penetration on the total online retail trade, had attained 10%, or more. It was also shown that in emerging markets, smart-phone and tablet penetration is fast increasing and contributing significantly to online shopping growth.

'''Mint Street''' is one of the prime streets of the commercial centre of [[George Town, Chennai|George Town]] in [[Chennai]], [[India]]. The street is one of the oldest streets in Chennai and is believed to be the longest street in the city.&lt;ref name="PrintWeekIndia_WalkthroughHistory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TOI_MadrasWeek_MemoriesDownTheStreet"/&gt; Running north–south, the street connects [[Poonamallee High Road, Chennai|Poonamallee High Road]] at [[Park Town, Chennai|Park Town]] in the south with North Wall Road–[[Old Jail Road, Chennai|Old Jail Road]] Junction at [[Washermanpet]] in the north. Running parallel to the [[Wall Tax Road, Chennai|Wall Tax Road]], another historical thoroughfare in the city, the street passes through thickly populated residential and commercial areas of the historical neighbourhood.

==History==
In the 17th century, a Jewish cemetery was established on the street by a [[Portuguese Jews|Portuguese Jewish]] trader,  Jacques de Paivia. It was later moved to Lloyd's Road and became the [[Lloyd's Road Jewish Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Muthiah S.|title=The Portuguese Jews of Madras|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-portuguese-jews-of-madras/article2252700.ece|publisher=The Hindu|date=3 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 18th century, washers and bleachers employed by the [[British East India Company]] for its cloth business settled around the street, given it the name 'Washers' Street'. Several of them were Telugu speaking, followed by the middlemen or dubashes (men who knew two languages), chiefly Telugu-speaking Komutti and Beri Chetties. By the 1740s, Gujarathis and people from the Saurashtra region closely associated with the cloth trade settled down in the area to the west of the street. Soon, the area also became home to [[Marwari people|Marwari]]s, who were chiefly pawn brokers and money lenders. Mint Street thus became a confluence of various language speakers, which has remained so till date.&lt;ref name="PrintWeekIndia_WalkthroughHistory"&gt;{{Cite web

In 1841–1842, the East India Company moved its coin-making facility to this street, and since then the street became known as Mint Street.&lt;ref name="PrintWeekIndia_WalkthroughHistory"/&gt; Later the mint was converted as the Government Press, which still functions. Next to the Press stood Crown Talkies, one of the city's earliest cinema theatres built by a photographer named Ragupathy Venkaiah, who also built other theatres such as Gaiety and Globe in various parts of the city. The street also housed Muragan Theatre, where ''Kalidasa'', the first Tamil talkie, was released.&lt;ref name="TOI_MadrasWeek_MemoriesDownTheStreet"&gt;{{cite news

The city's first ticketed Carnatic concert was conducted in this street in the 1880s for a concert by Maha Vaidyanatha Sivan at the Thondaimandalam Thruva Vellalar School, which is now in a dilapidated condition. The concept, however, did not succeed.&lt;ref name="TOI_MadrasWeek_MemoriesDownTheStreet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hindu_MintStreetMusicMemories"&gt;{{cite news

In 1889, the Hindu Theological School was established, where the legendary C. Saraswathi Bai gave her first harikatha performance in 1909, becoming the first woman to do so.&lt;ref name="Hindu_MintStreetMusicMemories"/&gt; The school was visited by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] in 1896.&lt;ref name="TOI_MadrasWeek_MemoriesDownTheStreet"/&gt;

The memorial house of savant Ramalinga Swamigal is located near the northern end of the street, in Veerasami Street, a lane off Barracks Street.&lt;ref name="Hindu_MintStreetMusicMemories"/&gt;

The street houses two historic schools, namely the Tondaimandalam Tuluva Vellalar (TTV) School, founded in 1854, and the Hindu Theological School, founded in 1889. The TTV School was home to one of the earliest music sabhas—the Tondaimandalam Sabha. It was at a meeting of this Sabha at the school in 1905 that the decision to celebrate the Aradhana of Tyagaraja in a grand manner at Thiruvaiyaru was taken by a large group of musicians.&lt;ref name="Hindu_MintStreetMusicMemories"/&gt;

Mint Street housed several bhajan centres (''bhajanai mandirams''), to nurture the bhajan tradition of Carnatic music, of which at least two still survive. One of these centres has transformed into a temple. Known as the 'Sumai tangi' (load-bearing) Rama temple, it has two exquisite Thanjavur paintings of Rama and Narasimha, which were the original objects of worship before the erection of stone idols. In a talk that Tiger Varadachariar gave over the All India Radio, composers and music publishers Tachur Singaracharlu Brothers organised bhajan sessions at this temple in the 1890s.&lt;ref name="Hindu_MintStreetMusicMemories"/&gt;
Mint Street has several temples dedicated to Lord Ganesha.&lt;ref name="Hindu_MintStreetMusicMemories"/&gt; [[Kandaswami Temple, Georgetown|Kandaswami Temple]], dedicated to Lord Murugan, is located on Rasappa Chetty Street, off Mint Street.

'''Nikolai Karlovich von Meck''' (28 April 1863 – 24 May 1929) was a [[Russian people|Russian]] engineer and entrepreneur involved in the development of the [[History of rail transport in Russia|Russian railways]] during the first part of the twentieth century.

Nikolai was the  sixth son of [[Karl Otto Georg von Meck]] who came from an old Baltic-German noble family originally from Silesia and [[Nadezhda von Meck]] out of eleven children in total.

His mother inherited a substantial fortune and became a patron of the arts. Alongside her intense but platonic relationship with [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Pyotr Tchaikovsky]], she also brought Nikolai into contact with such people as [[Claude Debussy]], who stayed with the family as a young man. Nikolai recorded that Debussy acquired the family nickname "le boulliant Achille".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lockspeiser|first1=Edward|title=Debussy: Volume 1, 1862-1902: His Life and Mind|date=1978|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Meck hoped that his knowledge and experience would continue to be useful to the Soviet state. He continued to take an interest in developing the railway transport system and served as a consultant to the financial and economic department of the People's Commissariat of Railways. He represented the Commissar on the State Planning Commission. Von Meck outlined his ideas in the field of economics and prospects for domestic rail transport in a series of books published between 1921 and 1927.

Despite this, due to his "bourgeois" origins, he was repeatedly arrested on various charges from 1919 onward, accused of, among other things, "counter-revolutionary speeches against the Soviet system" and being part of a "technological counter-revolution." He was arrested for the final time in 1928, and in May 1929 the [[OGPU]] (forerunner of the [[KGB]]) sentenced him to death for [[Wrecking (Soviet Union)|wrecking]]; that is, attempts to sabotage Soviet authority through substandard work. He was shot to death and his execution was announced on 24 May 1929.

OTP Group started its activity in 1949 when OTP Bank was founded as a state savings and commercial bank. '''OTP''' stands for '''O'''rszágos '''T'''akarék '''P'''énztár (National Savings Bank) which indicates the origin purpose of establishment of the bank.
The bank went public in 1995, and the share of the state in the bank capital decreased to one preferential gold share, which also eliminated shortly thereafter.

==History==
The predecessor of OTP Bank, called the National Savings Bank (OTP Bank) was established in 1949 as a nationwide, state-owned, banking entity providing retail deposits and loans. In the ensuing years, its activities and the scope of its authority gradually widened. First, it was authorised to enter into real estate transactions. Later, its role was extended to provide domestic foreign currency accounts and foreign exchange services; there was a subsequent diversification into providing banking services for Hungarian municipalities.

Since 1989, the bank has operated as a multi-functional commercial bank. In addition to continuing its previous retail and municipal activities, the bank has been authorised to solicit corporate loan accounts and deposits, and to provide commercial loans and banking services for correspondent banking and export-import transactions.

In 1990, the National Savings Bank became a public company with a share capital of HUF 23 billion. Its name was changed to the National Savings and Commercial Bank. Subsequently, non-banking activities were separated from the bank, along with their supporting organisational units. The state lottery was reorganised into a separate state-owned company and OTP Real Estate was established as a subsidiary of the bank.
[[Image:Otp bank Logo old.svg|thumb|150px|left|OTP Bank logo used between 1991 and 2007]]

OTP Bank's privatisation began in 1995. As a result of 3 public offers along with the introduction of the bank's shares into the Budapest Stock Exchange the state's ownership in the bank decreased to a single voting preference (golden) share. Currently the bank is characterized by dispersed ownership of mostly private and institutional (financial) investors.

After the realisation of its own privatisation process, OTP Bank started its international expansion targeting countries in CEE{{clarify|date=December 2016}} region.  OTP Bank has completed several acquisitions in the past years. Besides Hungary, OTP Group currently operates in 8 countries of the region via its subsidiaries: in Bulgaria ([[DSK Bank]]), in Croatia (OTP banka Hrvatska), in Romania (OTP Bank Romania), in Serbia ([[OTP banka Srbija]]), in Slovakia (OTP Banka Slovensko), in Ukraine (OTP Bank JSC), in Montenegro (Crnogorska komercijalna banka) and in Russia (OAO OTP Bank).

2008 was milestone in OTP Bank history since it was the first time to sell one of its subsidiaries. The French Groupama  S.A. acquired its insurance business line, and part of the transaction they resolved to collaborate in strategic points and crossell their financial and insurance products.  Groupama S.A. has acquired 8% of shares of OTP Group.

In April 2014, it was announced that OTP Bank was close to a deal to acquire the Hungarian [[MKB Bank]] from German firm [[BayernLB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/08/us-otp-bk-mkb-bank-idUSBREA370HK20140408| title=Hungary's biggest bank OTP nearing deal to buy MKB| publisher=Reuters| date=8 April 2014| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924195628/http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/08/us-otp-bk-mkb-bank-idUSBREA370HK20140408 | archivedate=24 September 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; French [[AXA Bank Europe]] announced in February 2016 it has entered into an agreement with OTP Bank to sell its Hungarian banking operations, which is considered as medium-sized bank in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.intellinews.com/otp-agrees-to-buy-axa-s-hungarian-banking-unit-89925/?source=bne-banker| title=OTP agrees to buy Axa's Hungarian banking unit| publisher=IntelliNews| date=2016| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404103744/http://www.intellinews.com/otp-agrees-to-buy-axa-s-hungarian-banking-unit-89925/?source=bne-banker| archivedate=2016-04-04| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Extruder with sheet die.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Cross-section of a plastic extruder to show the screw]]

'''Plastics extrusion''' is a high-volume manufacturing process in which raw [[plastic]] is melted and formed into a continuous profile. Extrusion produces items such as pipe/tubing, [[weatherstripping]], fencing, [[deck railing]]s, [[window|window frames]], [[plastic film]]s and sheeting, [[thermoplastic]] coatings, and wire insulation.

This process starts by feeding plastic material (pellets, granules, flakes or powders) from a hopper into the barrel of the extruder. The material is gradually melted by the mechanical energy generated by turning screws and by heaters arranged along the barrel.  The molten polymer is then forced into a die, which shapes the polymer into a shape that hardens during cooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.teppfa.eu/production-processes/|title = Production Processes|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = TEPPFA, The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Production processes.png|thumb|Pipe extrusion]]
The first precursors to the modern extruder were developed in the early 19th century. In 1820, Thomas Hancock invented a rubber "masticator" designed to reclaim processed rubber scraps, and in 1836 Edwin Chaffee developed a two-roller machine to mix additives into [[rubber]].&lt;ref&gt;Tadmor and Gogos (2006). ‘’Principles of Polymer Processing’’. John Wiley and Sons. {{ISBN|978-0-471-38770-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first thermoplastic extrusion was in 1935 by Paul Troester and his wife Ashley Gershoff in [[Hamburg]], Germany. Shortly after, Roberto Colombo of LMP developed the first twin screw extruders in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Rauwendaal | first = Chris | title = Polymer Extrusion, 4th ed | page =  | publisher = Hanser | year = 2001  | isbn = 3-446-21774-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
In the extrusion of plastics, the raw compound material is commonly in the form of nurdles (small beads, often called resin) that are gravity fed from a top mounted [[:wikt:hopper|hopper]] into the barrel of the extruder. Additives such as colorants and UV inhibitors (in either liquid or pellet form) are often used and can be mixed into the resin prior to arriving at the hopper. The process has much in common with [[injection molding|plastic injection molding]] from the point of the extruder technology, although it differs in that it is usually a continuous process. While [[pultrusion]] can offer many similar profiles in continuous lengths, usually with added reinforcing, this is achieved by pulling the finished product out of a die instead of extruding the polymer melt through a die.

The material enters through the feed throat (an opening near the rear of the barrel) and comes into contact with the screw. The rotating screw (normally turning at e.g. 120 rpm) forces the plastic beads forward into the heated barrel. The desired extrusion temperature is rarely equal to the set temperature of the barrel due to viscous heating and other effects. In most processes, a heating profile is set for the barrel in which three or more independent [[PID controller|PID]]-controlled heater zones gradually increase the temperature of the barrel from the rear (where the plastic enters) to the front. This allows the plastic beads to melt gradually as they are pushed through the barrel and lowers the risk of overheating which may cause degradation in the polymer.

Extra heat is contributed by the intense pressure and friction taking place inside the barrel. In fact, if an extrusion line is running certain materials fast enough, the heaters can be shut off and the melt temperature maintained by pressure and friction alone inside the barrel. In most extruders, cooling fans are present to keep the temperature below a set value if too much heat is generated. If forced air cooling proves insufficient then cast-in cooling jackets are employed.

[[File:Extruder section.jpg|450px|thumb|left|Plastic extruder cut in half to show the components]]

At the front of the barrel, the [[wikt:molten|molten]] plastic leaves the screw and travels through a screen pack to remove any contaminants in the melt. The screens are reinforced by a breaker plate (a thick metal puck with many holes drilled through it) since the pressure at this point can exceed 5,000 [[Pound-force per square inch|psi]] (34 [[MPa]]). The screen pack/breaker plate assembly also serves to create [[back pressure]] in the barrel. Back pressure is required for uniform melting and proper mixing of the polymer, and how much pressure is generated can be "tweaked" by varying screen pack composition (the number of screens, their wire weave size, and other parameters). This breaker plate and screen pack combination also eliminates the "rotational memory" of the molten plastic and creates instead, "longitudinal memory".

After passing through the breaker plate molten plastic enters the die. The die is what gives the final product its profile and must be designed so that the molten plastic evenly flows from a cylindrical profile, to the product's profile shape. Uneven flow at this stage can produce a product with unwanted residual stresses at certain points in the profile which can cause warping upon cooling. A wide variety of shapes can be created, restricted to continuous profiles.

The product must now be cooled and this is usually achieved by pulling the extrudate through a water bath. Plastics are very good thermal insulators and are therefore difficult to cool quickly. Compared to [[steel]], plastic conducts its heat away 2,000 times more slowly. In a tube or pipe extrusion line, a sealed water bath is acted upon by a carefully controlled vacuum to keep the newly formed and still molten tube or pipe from collapsing. For products such as plastic sheeting, the cooling is achieved by pulling through a set of cooling rolls. For films and very thin sheeting, air cooling can be effective as an initial cooling stage, as in blown film extrusion.

Plastic extruders are also extensively used to reprocess recycled [[plastic pollution|plastic waste]] or other raw materials after cleaning, sorting and/or blending.  This material is commonly extruded into filaments suitable for chopping into the bead or pellet stock to use as a precursor for further processing.

==Screw design==
There are five possible zones in a thermoplastic screw. Since terminology is not standardized in the industry, different names may refer to these zones. Different types of polymer will have differing screw designs, some not incorporating all of the possible zones.

[[File:Plastic extruder screw.jpg|600px|thumb|centre|A simple plastic extrusion screw]]

[[File:Extruder Screws From Boston Matthews.jpg|thumb|Extruder screws From Boston Matthews]]

Most screws have these three zones:
* Feed zone (also called the solids conveying zone): this zone feeds the resin into the extruder, and the channel depth is usually the same throughout the zone.
* Melting zone (also called the transition or compression zone): most of the polymer is melted in this section, and the channel depth gets progressively smaller.
* Metering zone (also called the melt conveying zone): this zone melts the last particles and mixes to a uniform temperature and composition. Like the feed zone, the channel depth is constant throughout this zone.
In addition, a vented (two-stage) screw has:
* Decompression zone.  In this zone, about two-thirds down the screw, the channel suddenly gets deeper, which relieves the pressure and allows any trapped gases (moisture, air, solvents, or reactants) to be drawn out by vacuum.
* Second metering zone.  This zone is similar to the first metering zone, but with greater channel depth.  It serves to repressurize the melt to get it through the resistance of the screens and the die.

Often screw length is referenced to its diameter as L:D ratio. For instance, a {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} diameter screw at 24:1 will be 144&amp;nbsp;inches (12&amp;nbsp;ft) long, and at 32:1 it is 192&amp;nbsp;inches (16&amp;nbsp;ft) long. An L:D ratio of 25:1 is common, but some machines go up to 40:1 for more mixing and more output at the same screw diameter.  Two-stage (vented) screws are typically 36:1 to account for the two extra zones.

Each zone is equipped with one or more [[thermocouple]]s or [[Resistance temperature detector|RTDs]] in the barrel wall for temperature control. The "temperature profile" i.e., the temperature of each zone is very important to the quality and characteristics of the final extrudate.

==Typical extrusion materials==
Typical plastic materials that are used in extrusion include but are not limited to: [[polyethylene]] (PE), [[polypropylene]], [[acetal]], [[acrylic resin|acrylic]], [[nylon]] (polyamides), [[polystyrene]], [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]] (ABS) and [[polycarbonate]].&lt;ref name="todd"&gt;{{harvnb|Todd|Allen|Alting|1994|pp=223–227}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Die types==

{{Main|Die forming (plastics)}}

There are a variety of dies used in plastics extrusion.  While there can be significant differences between die types and complexity, all dies allow for the continuous extrusion of polymer melt, as opposed to non-continuous processing such as [[injection molding]].

===Blown film extrusion===
[[File:Film extrusion.jpg|thumb|Blow extrusion of plastic film]]

The manufacture of [[plastic film]] for products such as [[shopping bag]]s and continuous sheeting is achieved using a [[blown film]] line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HOW TO SOLVE BLOWN FILM PROBLEMS|url=http://www.lyondellbasell.com/techlit/techlit/Handbooks%20and%20Manuals/BlownFilmProblems.pdf|publisher=Lyondell Chemical Company|accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This process is the same as a regular extrusion process up until the die. There are three main types of dies used in this process: annular (or crosshead), spider, and spiral. Annular dies are the simplest, and rely on the polymer melt channeling around the entire cross section of the die before exiting the die; this can result in uneven flow. Spider dies consist of a central mandrel attached to the outer die ring via a number of "legs"; while flow is more symmetrical than in annular dies, a number of weld lines are produced which weaken the film. Spiral dies remove the issue of weld lines and asymmetrical flow, but are by far the most complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Small Scale Recycling of Plastics|author=John Vogler|pages=6–7|publisher=Intermediate Technology Publication|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The melt is cooled somewhat before leaving the die to yield a weak semi-solid tube. This tube's diameter is rapidly expanded via air pressure, and the tube is drawn upwards with rollers, stretching the plastic in both the transverse and draw directions. The drawing and blowing cause the film to be thinner than the extruded tube, and also preferentially aligns the polymer molecular chains in the direction that sees the most [[Elastic and plastic strain|plastic strain]]. If the film is drawn more than it is blown (the final tube diameter is close to the extruded diameter) the polymer molecules will be highly aligned with the draw direction, making a film that is strong in that direction, but weak in the transverse direction. A film that has significantly larger diameter than the extruded diameter will have more strength in the transverse direction, but less in the draw direction.

In the case of polyethylene and other semi-crystalline polymers, as the film cools it crystallizes at what is known as the [[Frost line (polymers)|frost line]]. As the film continues to cool, it is drawn through several sets of nip rollers to flatten it into lay-flat tubing, which can then be spooled or slit into two or more rolls of sheeting.

===Sheet/film extrusion===

Sheet/film extrusion is used to extrude plastic sheets or [[plastic film|films]] that are too thick to be blown.  There are two types of dies used: T-shaped and coat hanger.  The purpose of these dies is to reorient and guide the flow of polymer melt from a single round output from the extruder to a thin, flat planar flow.  In both die types ensure constant, uniform flow across the entire cross sectional area of the die.  Cooling is typically by pulling through a set of cooling rolls ([[calender]]&lt;!-- Note: This is the correct spelling of "calender" as used in this sense --&gt; or "chill" rolls). In sheet extrusion, these rolls not only deliver the necessary cooling but also determine sheet thickness and surface texture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Process, Methods and Features of plastic extrusion technology | url= http://www.sheetextruderline.com/article_10.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often co-extrusion is used to apply one or more layers on top of a base material to obtain specific properties such as UV-absorption, texture, oxygen permeation resistance, or energy reflection.

A common post-extrusion process for plastic sheet stock is [[thermoforming]], where the sheet is heated until soft (plastic), and formed via a mold into a new shape. When vacuum is used, this is often described as [[vacuum forming]]. Orientation (i.e. ability/ available density of the sheet to be drawn to the mold which can vary in depths from 1 to 36&amp;nbsp;inches typically) is highly important and greatly affects forming cycle times for most plastics.

===Tubing extrusion===
Extruded [[Tubing (material)|tubing]], such as PVC pipes, is manufactured using very similar dies as used in blown film extrusion.  Positive pressure can be applied to the internal cavities through the pin, or negative pressure can be applied to the outside diameter using a vacuum sizer to ensure correct final dimensions. Additional lumens or holes may be introduced by adding the appropriate inner mandrels to the die.

[[File:A Boston Matthews Medical Extrusion Line.jpg|thumb|A Boston Matthews Medical Extrusion Line]]

Multi-layer tubing applications are also ever present within the automotive industry, plumbing &amp; heating industry and packaging industry.

===Over jacketing extrusion===
Over jacketing extrusion allows for the application of an outer layer of plastic onto an existing wire or cable.  This is the typical process for insulating wires.

There are two different types of die tooling used for coating over a wire, tubing (or jacketing) and pressure.  In jacketing tooling, the polymer melt does not touch the inner wire until immediately before the die lips.  In pressure tooling, the melt contacts the inner wire long before it reaches the die lips; this is done at a high pressure to ensure good adhesion of the melt.  If intimate contact or adhesion is required between the new layer and existing wire, pressure tooling is used.  If adhesion is not desired/necessary, jacketing tooling is used instead.

===Coextrusion===&lt;!-- [[Coextrusion]] links here --&gt;
Coextrusion is the extrusion of multiple layers of material simultaneously.  This type of extrusion utilizes two or more extruders to melt and deliver a steady volumetric throughput of different viscous plastics to a single extrusion head (die) which will extrude the materials in the desired form. This technology is used on any of the processes described above (blown film, overjacketing, tubing, sheet).  The layer thicknesses are controlled by the relative speeds and sizes of the individual extruders delivering the materials.

[[File:5 Layer Extrusion Technology.jpg|thumb|5 :5 Layer co-extrusion of cosmetic "squeeze" tube]]

In many real-world scenarios, a single polymer cannot meet all the demands of an application. Compound extrusion allows a blended material to be extruded, but coextrusion retains the separate materials as different layers in the extruded product, allowing appropriate placement of materials with differing properties such as oxygen permeability, strength, stiffness, and wear resistance.

===Extrusion coating===
[[Extrusion coating]] is using a blown or cast film process to coat an additional layer onto an existing rollstock of paper, foil or film. For example, this process can be used to improve the characteristics of paper by coating it with polyethylene to make it more resistant to water.  The extruded layer can also be used as an adhesive to bring two other materials together. [[Tetrapak]] is a commercial example of this process.

==Compound extrusions==&lt;!-- [[Compound extruder]] and [[compound extrusion]] redirect here --&gt;
Compounding extrusion is a process that mixes one or more polymers with additives to give plastic compounds.  The feeds may be pellets, powder and/or liquids, but the product is usually in pellet form, to be used in other plastic-forming processes such as extrusion and injection molding.  As with traditional extrusion, there is a wide range in machine sizes depending on application and desired throughput.  While either single- or double-screw extruders may be used in traditional extrusion, the necessity of adequate mixing in compounding extrusion makes twin-screw extruders all but mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Rosato | first = Marlene G. | title = Concise encyclopedia of plastics | page = 245 | publisher = Springer | year = 2000 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0g9QjxsbqmUC&amp;pg=PA245 | isbn = 978-0-7923-8496-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Giles | first = Harold F. | last2 = Wagner | first2 = John R. | last3 = Mount | first3 = Eldridge M. | title = Extrusion: the definitive processing guide and handbook | page = 151 | publisher = William Andrew | year = 2005 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EUl2snQQ_OUC&amp;pg=PT173 | isbn = 978-0-8155-1473-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of extruder==

There are two sub-types of twin screw extruders: co-rotating and counter-rotating. This nomenclature refers to the relative direction each screw spins compared to the other.  In co-rotation mode, both screws spin either clockwise or counter clockwise; in counter-rotation, one screw spins clockwise while the other spins counter clockwise.  It has been shown that, for a given cross sectional area and degree of overlap (intermeshing), axial velocity and degree of mixing is higher in co-rotating twin extruders.  However, pressure buildup is higher in counter-rotating extruders.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, A and Gupta, M (2004). "Comparison of the flow in co-rotating and counter-rotating twin-screw extruders". ANTEC, www.plasticflow.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The screw design is commonly modular in that various conveying and mixing elements are arranged on the shafts to allow for rapid reconfiguration for a process change or replacement of individual components due to wear or corrosive damage. The machine sizes range from as small as 12&amp;nbsp;mm to as large as 380mm [12- Polymer Mixing by James White, pages 129-140]

==Advantages==

A great advantage of extrusion is that profiles such as pipes can be made to any length. If the material is sufficiently flexible, pipes can be made at long lengths even coiling on a reel. Another advantage is the extrusion of pipes with integrated coupler including rubber seal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.teppfa.eu/production-processes/|title = Production Processes|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = TEPPFA, The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''private sector''' is the part of the economy, sometimes referred to as the '''citizen sector''', which is run by private individuals or groups, usually as a means of enterprise for [[Profit (accounting)|profit]], and is not controlled by the [[State (polity)|State]].

==Employment==
The private sector employs most of the workforce in some countries. In private sector, activities are guided by the motive to earn 
money.

A 2013 study by the [[International Finance Corporation]] (part of the [[World Bank Group]]) identified that 90 percent of jobs in developing countries are in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/16979|title=IFC Jobs Study : Assessing Private Sector Contributions to Job Creation and Poverty Reduction|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diversification==
In free enterprise countries, such as the [[United States|United States of America]], the private sector is wider, and places fewer constraints on firms. In countries with more government authority, such as [[China]], the public sector makes up most of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/private-sector |title=What is private sector? - Definition from WhatIs.com |last=Rouse |first=Margaret |date=August 2013 |website=[[Tech Target]] |access-date=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation ==
States legally regulate the private sector.  [[Business]]es operating within a country must comply with the laws in that country.

In some cases, usually involving [[multinational corporation]]s that can pick and choose their suppliers and locations based on their perception of the regulatory environment, local state regulations have resulted in uneven practices within one company.  For example, workers in one country may benefit from strong [[labour unions]], while workers in another country have very weak laws supporting labour unions, even though they work for the same employer.  In some cases, industries and individual businesses choose to self-regulate by applying higher standards for dealing with their workers, customers, or the environment than the minimum that is legally required of them.&lt;ref&gt;

|publisher= Carnegie Endowment|isbn= 9780870033377
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

There can be negative effects from the private sector. In the early 1980s, the Corrections Corporation of America pioneered the idea of running [[Prison|prisons]] for a profit. Today, corporate-run prisons hold eight percent of America’s inmates. Since it is from the private sector, their main priority isn’t rehabilitation, but profit. This has resulted in many human rights violations across the United States. &lt;ref&gt;Bauer, Shane. "Private prisons are shrouded in secrecy. I took a job as a guard to get inside-then things got crazy."Mother Jones. N.p., 06 June 2017. Web. 10 June 2017.

'''Robert Wilson Dron''' [[FRSE]] MA MICE PIME (1869-1932) was a Scottish geologist and mining engineer, writing many authoritative books on coal-mining. He was Professor of Mining Technology at the [[University of Glasgow]]. He was founder of the mining company '''R W Dron &amp; Sons'''. He served as President of the [[Mining Institute of Scotland]] from 1923 to 1925.

==Life==
He was born in [[Glasgow]] in 1869, the son of Alexander Dron a manufacturing engineer.
In  1893 he appears as Manager of the Coal and Fire Clay Mine in [[Provanhall]] near Glasgow, owned by R &amp; J Mather.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scottishbrickhistory.co.uk/provanhall-fire-clay-works-shettleston/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901 he founded R W Dron &amp; Sons, having offices at 55 West Regent Street in [[Glasgow]]. At this time he lived in a large mansion: Utica on Thorn Drive/Westbourne Drive in [[Bearsden]].&lt;ref&gt;Glasgow Post Office Directory 1901-02&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[Glasgow Geological Society]].

He advised on mining in various foreign locations from the [[Caucasus Mountains]] to [[Spitzbergen]], andfrom [[Nova Scotia]] to [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 1932, p449&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1917. His proposers were [[John Horne]], [[Ben Peach]], Sir [[John Smith Flett]] and [[Thomas James Jehu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922 he was appointed Professor of Mining at [[Glasgow University]] and continued this role until death. The university awarded him an honorary degree (MA) in recognition of his work.

He died at home in Bearsden on 16 April 1932.

'''Roderick Chisholm''' (20 December 1868 – 15 April 1912) was a Scottish designer; together with [[Thomas Andrews]], he was co-designer of the [[RMS Titanic]]. He died in the night of the famous [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|transatlantic disaster]].

==Biography==
===First years and career===
His father, James Chisholm (born in 1832), came from [[Urray]], a village in [[Ross-shire]] County and was a master of ships; the mother, Sophia Voaden (born in 1841), was originally from the county of [[Devon]]. The couple had married in Devon in 1860 and had eight children: James sr. (1861), Duncan (1863), James jr. (1864), Mary (1866), '''Roderick''', Charlotte (1871), John (1877) and Jessie (1879).

Beginning in 1881, the family lived in the village of [[Old Kilpatrick]], in [[Dunbartonshire]], [[Scotland]]; in 1891 he moved to [[Clydebank]]. At that time, Roderick became a ship designer and a few years later moved to [[Belfast]], being hired by [[Harland and Wolff]]. His skill led him, in the years to come, to the design of the [[RMS Olympic]] and Titanic transatlantic.

In 1897, he married Susan Anderson in [[Lisburn]], County Down; the couple had two children: Alice (1897–2002) and James (1899–1960), both born in Belfast.

===On the Titanic and posterity===
Chisholm was one of the select employees of Harland and Wolff to oversee the smooth running of the Titanic maiden voyage.

In the night of 14 April 1912, the Titanic fatally impacted an iceberg sinking hours later; Chisholm could not save himself and died in the sinking. His body, if recovered, was never identified. Its assets amounted to about 140 pounds, of which the widow became beneficiary.

His wife remained at Sandford Avenue, in [[Pottinger (District Electoral Area)|Pottinger]] (Belfast) for the rest of her life and died on 22 February 1961 at the age of 87. She is buried in [[Roselawn Cemetery]], Belfast, with her son James. His daughter Alice married in Belfast in 1919 with Alfred McCambley (1894–1976) and died on 11 February 2002 at the age of 104 and she is also buried in the Roselawn Cemetery.

The '''September 11 National Day of Service and Remembrance''' or '''9/11 Day''' is a federally-recognized day of unity and charitable service, annually observed throughout the United States and in other countries around the world on the anniversary of the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]]. It has grown to become the largest annual day of charitable service in the United States.

==Background==

According to the nonprofit MyGoodDeed, which founded the September 11 National Day of Service and Remembrance ("9/11 Day") in 2002, the goal of "9/11 Day" is "to keep alive the spirit of unity and compassion that arose in the immediate aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]] in tribute to the individuals lost and injured in the attacks, and the many who rose in service in response." The idea of making September 11 an annual day of service was first conceived in the winter of 2001 by David Paine, a former marketing executive from New York City. In the Spring of 2002 David was joined by his friend Jay Winuk, who had lost his brother Glenn Winuk in the attacks at the World Trade Center, and together they formed the nonprofit group called One Day's Pay. In 2007, the name of the organization was officially changed to MyGoodDeed. In 2009, MyGoodDeed successfully led an effort to designate September 11 under federal law as a National Day of Service and Remembrance, which occurred as part of passage of the bipartisan Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act by the [[United States Congress]], and later, by an amendment to the Patriot Day [[Presidential Proclamation]] by President Barack Obama, which formally recognized and established September 11 as a National Day of Service and Remembrance. The Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act authorized the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), a federal agency, to assist the 9/11 community in building awareness of and support for "9/11 Day" through its national service programs. In 2011, on the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, MyGoodDeed, CNCS and the Points of Light Institute/HandsOn Network joined together to organize the largest day of charitable service in U.S. history, with more than 32 million Americans participating, according to research conducted by Horizon Consumer Science on behalf of MyGoodDeed. Today, 9/11 Day continues to engage nearly 30 million Americans annually in various forms of charitable service, including volunteering, donations to charities, and simple good deeds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://911day.org/about/ About Us], 911day.org, published by MyGoodDeed, accessed July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serve.gov/?q=site-page/september-11th-national-day-service-and-remembrance|September 11th National Day of Service and Remembrance], serve.gov, published by the Corporation for National and Community Service, accessed July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pointsoflight.org/signature-events/911-day-service-and-remembrance/2011|9/11 Day of Service and Remembrance 2011], pointsoflight.org, published by the Points of Light Foundation, accessed July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

Activities by volunteers on this federally-recognized National Day of Service and Remembrance happen all across the nation, and include lesson plans that engage tens of thousands of students of all ages in service activities; coast-to-coast blood drives; meal packing projects; painting and refurbishing homes; food drives; reclaiming neighborhoods; helping communities prepare for disasters; and countless other activities that support and honor those lost and injured on 9/11; veterans, soldiers, military families, and rescue and recovery workers, including first responders. Among the largest projects held annually are two large-scale hunger relief projects, one in New York City and another at the National Mall in Washington, DC, which mobilize a total of more than 7,000 volunteers who together pack over two million meals for individuals at risk of hunger. In Boston, thousands join together on 9/11 at the Rose Kennedy Greenway to assemble care packages for military personnel.  Participants are encouraged to use the [[hashtag]] #911Day when posting online about the day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serve.gov/?q=site-page/september-11th-national-day-service-and-remembrance|September 11th National Day of Service and Remembrance], serve.gov, published by the Corporation for National and Community Service, accessed July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ysa.org/act/programs/911day/ 9/11 Day of Service &amp; Remembrance], ysa.org, published by Youth Service America, accessed July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Volunteers Honor 9/11 Victims By Helping Others On National Day Of Service|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/09/11/volunteers-honor-911-victims-by-helping-others-on-national-day-of-service/|accessdate=2 December 2012|newspaper=CBS New York|date=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Escasez en Venezuela, Central Madeirense 8.JPG|250px|thumbnail|right|A 2014 image of product [[shortages in Venezuela]].]]

In [[economics]], a '''shortage''' or '''excess demand''' is a situation in which the [[demand]] for a [[product (business)|product]] or [[service (economics)|service]] exceeds its [[supply (economics)|supply]] in a [[market (economics)|market]]. It is the opposite of an [[excess supply]] ([[economic surplus|surplus]]).

== Definitions ==
In a [[perfect market]] (one that matches a simple [[microeconomic]] model), an excess of demand will prompt sellers to increase [[price]]s until demand at that price matches the available supply, establishing [[economic equilibrium|market equilibrium]]&lt;ref&gt;Tucker (2014) Economics Today&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. In economic terminology, a shortage occurs when for some reason (such as government intervention, or decisions by sellers not to raise prices) the price does not rise to reach equilibrium.  In this circumstance, buyers want to purchase more at the market price than the quantity of the good or service that is available, and some non-price mechanism (such as "first come, first served" or a lottery) determines which buyers are served. So in a perfect market the only thing that can cause a shortage is price.

In common use, the term "shortage" may refer to a situation where most people are unable to find a desired good at an affordable price, especially where supply problems have increased the price.  "[[Market clearing]]" happens when all buyers and sellers willing to transact at the prevailing price are able to find partners.  There are almost always willing buyers at a lower-than-market-clearing price; the narrower technical definition doesn't consider failure to serve this demand as a "shortage", even if it would be described that way in a social or political context (which the simple model of [[supply and demand]] does not attempt to encompass).

== Causes ==
Shortages (in the technical sense) may be caused by:
* [[Price ceiling]]s, a type of [[price control]] which involves a government-imposed limit on the price of a product service.
* Anti-[[price gouging]] laws.
* Government [[ban (law)|ban]] on the sale of a product or service, such as [[prostitution]] or certain [[recreational drug use|recreational drugs]].
* Decisions by suppliers not to raise prices, for example to maintain friendly relationships with potential future customers during a supply disruption.
* [[Artificial scarcity]]

== Effects ==
Decisions which result in a below-market-clearing price help some people and hurt others. In this case, shortages may be accepted because they theoretically enable a certain portion of the population to purchase a product that they couldn't afford at the market-clearing price. The cost is to those who are willing to pay for a product and either can't, or experience greater difficulty in doing so.

In the case of [[government intervention]] in the market, there is always a trade-off with positive and negative effects. For example, a price ceiling may cause a shortage, but it will also enable a certain percentage of the population to purchase a product that they couldn't afford at market costs. Economic shortages caused by higher [[transaction costs]] and [[opportunity costs]] (e.g., in the form of lost time) also mean that the distribution process is wasteful. Both of these factors contribute to a decrease in aggregate wealth.

Shortages may cause:

* [[Black market]]s, illegal markets in which products that are unavailable in conventional markets are sold, or in which products with excess demand are sold at higher prices than in the conventional market.
* Artificial controls of demand, such as time (such as waiting in line) and [[rationing]].
* Non-monetary bargaining methods, such as time (for example [[Queue area|queuing]]), [[nepotism]], or even violence. 
* [[Price discrimination]].
* The inability to purchase a product, and subsequent [[forced saving]].

== Examples ==
[[File:Entre Libertador y Chacao los indigentes sobrevive con desechos.webm|250px|thumb|right|Citizens of [[Caracas, Venezuela]] searching for food in garbage in 2016]]
* [[Rationing in the United Kingdom]] occurred mainly during and after the world wars
* From 1920 to 1933 during [[prohibition in the United States]], the creation of a black market for [[liquor]] was created due to the low supply of [[alcoholic beverages]].
* During the [[1973 oil crisis]], during which long lines and rationing was used to control demand.
* In the former [[Soviet Union]] during the 1980s, prices were artificially low by fiat (i.e., high prices were outlawed). Soviet citizens waited in line (or "queued") for various [[Price controls|price-controlled]] goods and services such as cars, apartments, or some types of clothing. From the point of view of those waiting in line, such goods were in perpetual "short supply"; some of them were willing and able to pay more than the official price ceiling, but were legally prohibited from doing so. This method for determining the allocation of goods in short supply is known as "[[rationing]]".
* From the mid-2000s through the 2010s, [[shortages in Venezuela]] occurred, due to the Venezuelan government's economic policies;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Venezuela seizes warehouses packed with medical goods, food|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-economy-idUSKCN0ID00A20141024|newspaper = Reuters|date = 2014-10-24|access-date = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as relying on foreign imports while creating strict [[foreign exchange controls]], put price controls in place and having [[expropriation]]s result with lower domestic production. As a result of such shortages, Venezuelans had to search for products, wait in lines for hours and rationing was initiated, with the government allowing the purchase of a certain amount of products through [[fingerprint recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why are Venezuelans posting pictures of empty shelves?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-30710014|accessdate=10 January 2015|agency=BBC|date=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=REUTjan2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cawthorne|first1=Andrew|title=In shortages-hit Venezuela, lining up becomes a profession|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/21/us-venezuela-shortages-idUSKBN0KU1BX20150121|accessdate=17 June 2015|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJoct2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schaefer Muñoz|first1=Sara|title=Despite Riches, Venezuela Starts Food Rationing; Government Rolls Out Fingerprint Scanners to Limit Purchases of Basic Goods; 'How Is it Possible We've Gotten to This Extreme'|url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/despite-riches-venezuela-starts-food-rationing-1414025667|accessdate=11 November 2014|agency=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc|date=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether an economic shortage of a certain good or service is beneficial or detrimental to society often depends on one's [[ethics|ethical]] and [[politics|political]] views. For instance, consider the shortage of recreational drugs discussed above, and the controversies around the use of such drugs. Likewise, consider the economic shortage of cars in the Soviet Union during the 1980s: On the one hand, people had to wait in line to buy a new car; on the other hand, cars were more affordable than they would have been at market prices.

== Shortages and "longages" ==
[[Garrett Hardin]] emphasised that a shortage of supply can just as well be viewed as a "longage" of [[demand]]. For instance, a shortage of food can just as well be called a longage of people ([[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]). By looking at it from this view, he felt the problem could be better dealt with.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/videos/video_803_segment5.html Video Interview with Garrett Hardin: Longages and Overpopulation Predictions] Educational Communications program 803, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labour shortage==
In its narrowest definition, a labour shortage is an [[economics|economic condition]] in which employers believe there are insufficient qualified candidates (employees) to fill the [[demand|marketplace demands]] for [[employment]] at a wage that is mostly employer-determined. Such a condition is sometimes referred to by [[economist]]s as "an insufficiency in the [[labour force]]." An [[Aging in the American workforce|ageing population and a contracting workforce]] and a [[birth dearth]] may curb U.S. economic expansion for several decades, for example.&lt;ref&gt;[http://washingtonexaminer.com/news/business/2011/08/shrinking-labor-force-may-curb-us-expansion-two-decades Shrinking labour force may curb U.S. expansion for two decades]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wage factors===
[[Wage|Wage levels]] have been suggested as one way to measure a labour shortage. However, that often does not match people's common perceptions. For example, if wages alone are the best measure of labour shortages, then that would imply that doctors, instead of farm workers, should be imported because doctors are far more expensive than farm workers. However, there are institutionally-imposed limits on the number of doctors that are allowed to be licensed.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} If foreign migrant workers were not allowed into a nation, farm wages may go up but probably not enough to approach the wages of doctors.

The [[Atlantic slave trade]] (which originated in the early 17th century but ended by the early 19th century) was said to have originated from perceived shortages of agricultural labour in the [[Americas]] (particularly in the [[Southern United States]]). It was thought that bringing African labor was the only means of [[malaria]] resistance available at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaria.com/blog/american-plasmodium-vivax "As American as…Plasmodium vivax?"]&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, malaria seems to itself have been introduced to the "New World" via the slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencedude.blog.ocregister.com/2011/12/26/uci-new-world-malaria-linked-to-slave-trade/166005/ "UCI: New World malaria linked to slave trade."]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Startup Weekend Recife - Recife - Pernambuco - Brasil.jpg|thumb|A Startup Weekend in Brazil in 2011.]]
'''Startup Weekend''' is a 54-hour weekend event, during which groups of developers, business managers, startup enthusiasts, marketing gurus, graphic artists and more pitch ideas for new startup companies, form teams around those ideas, and work to develop a working prototype, demo, or presentation by Sunday evening. Startup Weekend has grown into an organization with a global presence. As of December 2016, Startup Weekend has reached 135 countries, involving over 210,000 entrepreneurs. Startup Weekend is one of the Techstars Startup Programs, alongside Startup Week and Startup Digest.

==History==
Founded in July 2007 in [[Boulder, Colorado]] by Andrew Hyde,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feld |first=Brad |year=2012 |title=Startup Communities|publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1118441541 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Startup Weekend brought together 70 entrepreneurs to try to create a startup in just 54 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2007/07/07/startupweekend-70-founders-create-company-in-one-weekend/|title=StartupWeekend: 70 Founders Create Company In One Weekend – TechCrunch|last=Arrington|first=Michael|date=July 8, 2007|website=techcrunch.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810210643/https://techcrunch.com/2007/07/07/startupweekend-70-founders-create-company-in-one-weekend/|archive-date=August 10, 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=June 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model quickly expanded to cities around the world. In January 2010, Marc Nager and Clint Nelsen took over full ownership and registered the organization as a not-for-profit, relocating to Seattle. As of the acquisition, Startup Weekend had organized approximately 80 events in the USA, England, Germany and Canada. In February 2010, Franck Nouyrigat joined as a Co-Director and CTO. In the fall of 2010, Startup Weekend gained 501c3 status and received a grant from the Kauffman Foundation. By December 2010, the organization was composed of 8 full-time employees, over 15 'Key Facilitators', and more than 100 local organizers. In 2011, Startup Weekend launched the StartUp Foundation Initiative in partnership with the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pruitt|first=Barbara|title=Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation|url=http://www.kauffman.org/newsroom/startup-weekend-launches-startup-foundation-initiative-in-partnership-with-kauffman-foundation.aspx|publisher=Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012, Startup Weekend opened its first regional offices in London and Mexico City.&lt;ref name="Kauffman2012Jun"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schulte|first=Barb|title=Startup Weekend Expands Operations Globally, Opens Regional Offices in London and Mexico City|url=http://www.kauffman.org/newsroom/startup-weekend-expands-operations-globally-opens-regional-offices-in-london-and-mexico-city.aspx|publisher=Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016, Startup Weekend events ran in over 1000 cities around the world.

==Event model==
Startup Weekend events span the course of a weekend (approximately 54 hours),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vrant|first=Andres|title=UP.CO features Startup Weekend Universidad Santiago de Cali|url= http://www.up.co/communities/colombia/cali/startup-weekend/9480

In addition to attendees (otherwise known as 'Weekend Warriors'), the event attracts speakers, coaches, panelists (generally well-respected members of the local startup community or notable names in the tech industry), and various sponsors and company representatives. A good share of teams end up working together beyond the startup weekend to build a fully operating startup and others take with them the bootcamp experience and a network of like minds.

==Global Startup Battle==
Startup Weekend launched the [[Global Startup Battle]] in 2011 during [[Global Entrepreneurship Week]]. The 2012 battle included 10,000+ participants, 1,200+ teams, taking place in 100+ cities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Startup Battle|url=http://globalstartupbattle.org/|date=2012-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Global Startup Battle]] has three phases: First, the team must win the local Startup Weekend. Second, the team must win a [[Facebook]] popularity contest by receiving votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How To Win The Startup Weekend Popularity Contest|author=KissQuest Inc.|url=http://www.kissquestonline.com/winning-facebook|date=2012-11-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030422/http://www.kissquestonline.com/winning-facebook|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the top 15 teams move on to the final stage. The final stage is a judging panel. In 2016, Global Startup Battle, shifted to become Global Startup Weekend, a world-wide celebration of Startup Weekends.

[[File:Any Questions About Your Work - poster.jpg|thumb|A 1940s poster from the United States]]
A '''Supervisor''', when the meaning sought is similar to '''[[foreman (disambiguation)|foreman]]''', '''foreperson''', '''overseer''', '''cell coach''', '''manager''', '''facilitator''', '''monitor''', or '''area coordinator''', is the job title of a low level management position that is primarily based on authority over a worker or charge of a workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/hs/pdf/gl_supervisor.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223110958/http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/hs/pdf/gl_supervisor.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-23 |df= }} Who is a Supervisor under the Occupational Health and Safety Act? (2015) Ontario Ministry of Labour. Retrieved Feb 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; A Supervisor can also be one of the most senior in the staff at the place of work, such as a [[Professor]] who oversees a PhD dissertation.  [[Supervision]], on the other hand, can be performed by people without this formal title, for example by parents. The term Supervisor itself can be used to refer to any personnel who have this task as part of their job description.

An employee is a supervisor if he/she has the power and authority to do the following actions (according to the Ontario Ministry of Labour):
# Give instructions and/or orders to subordinates. 
# Be held responsible for the work and actions of other employees.

If an employee cannot do the above, legally, he or she is probably not a supervisor, but in some other category, such as a work group leader or lead hand.

A supervisor is first and foremost an overseer whose main responsibility is to ensure that a group of subordinates get out the assigned amount of production, when they are supposed to do it and within acceptable levels of quality, costs and safety.

A supervisor is responsible for the productivity and actions of a small group of employees.  The supervisor has several manager-like roles, responsibilities, and powers.  Two of the key differences between a supervisor and a manager are (1) the supervisor does not typically have "hire and fire" authority, and (2) the supervisor does not have [[budget]] authority.

Lacking "hire and fire" authority means that a supervisor may not [[recruitment|recruit]] the employees working in the supervisor's group nor does the supervisor have the authority to [[Termination of employment|terminate]] an employee.  The supervisor may participate in the hiring process as part of interviewing and assessing candidates, but the actual hiring authority rests in the hands of a Human Resource Manager.  The supervisor may recommend to management that a particular employee be terminated and the supervisor may be the one who documents the behaviors leading to the recommendation but the actual firing authority rests in the hands of a manager.

Lacking budget authority means that a supervisor is provided a budget developed by management within which constraints the supervisor is expected to provide a productive environment for the employees of the supervisor's work group.  A supervisor will usually have the authority to make purchases within specified limits.  A supervisor is also given the power to approve work hours and other payroll issues.  Normally, budget affecting requests such as travel will require not only the supervisor's approval but the approval of one or more layers of management.

As a member of management, a supervisor's main job is more concerned with orchestrating and controlling work rather than performing it directly.

== Responsibilities ==
Supervisors are uniquely positioned through direct daily employee contact to respond to employee needs, problems, and satisfaction. Supervisors are the direct link between management and the work force and can be most effective in developing job training, safety attitudes, safe working methods and identifying unsafe acts

== Tasks ==
* Carry out policies passed down a hierarchy from the level above.
* Plan short-range action-steps to carry out goals set by the level above.
* Organize the work group.
* Assign jobs to subordinates.
* Delegate projects to subordinates.
* Direct tasks, jobs and projects.
* Train subordinates.
* Enforce rules.
* Lead and motivate subordinates.
* Develop group cohesiveness.
* Solve routine daily problems.
* Control or evaluate performance of subordinates and the department - performance appraisals.
* Discipline subordinates.

"Doing" can take up to 70% of the time - (this varies according to the type of supervisory job - the doing involves the actual work of the department as well as the planning, controlling, scheduling, organizing, leading, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Powerful Leadership Skills for Women |first=Patricia | last=Miller| year = 1988| page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training ==
Supervisors often do not require any formal education on how they are to perform their duties but are most often given on-the-job training or attend company sponsored courses. Many employers have supervisor handbooks that need to be followed. Supervisors must be aware of their legal responsibilities to ensure that their employees work safely and that the workplace that they are responsible for meets government standards.

==Academia==
In [[academia]], a supervisor is a senior scientist or scholar who, along with their own responsibilities, aids and guides a postgraduate research student, or undergraduate student, in their research project; offering both moral support and scientific insight and guidance. The term is used in several countries for the [[doctoral advisor]] of a [[graduate student]].

==Gaffer==
In colloquial [[British English]], "'''gaffer'''" means a foreman, and is used as a synonym for "boss". In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the term also commonly refers to sports coaches ([[soccer|football]], [[rugby football|rugby]], etc.).

The term is also sometimes used colloquially to refer to an old man, an elderly rustic. The word is probably a shortening of "[[godparent|godfather]]", with ''"ga"'' from association with "grandfather".  The female equivalent, "gammer", came to refer colloquially to an old lady or to a gossip.&lt;ref&gt;The Concise Oxford Dictionary, 5th Edition, OUP 1964&lt;/ref&gt; The use of ''gaffer'' in this way can be seen, for example, in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s character [[Hamfast Gamgee|Gaffer Gamgee]].

In 16th century [[English language|English]] a "gaffer" was a man who was the head of any organized group of labourers. In 16th and 17th century rural [[England]], it was used as a [[title]] slightly inferior to "[[Master (form of address)|Master]]", similar to "[[Goodman (title)|Goodman]]", and was not confined to elderly men. The chorus of a famous Australian shearer's song, ''The Backblocks' Shearer'' (also known as ''Widgegoeera Joe''), written by W. Tully at Nimidgee, NSW (c.1900), refers to a gaffer:

::Hurrah, me boys, my shears are set,
::I feel both fit and well;
::Tomorrow you’ll find me at my pen
::When the gaffer rings the bell.
::With Hayden's patent thumb guards fixed
::And both my blades pulled back;
::Tomorrow I go with my sardine blow
::For a century or the sack!

*In glassblowing, a gaffer is the central figure in the creation of a piece of art. For example, at the [[Corning Glass Works]] in [[Corning (city), New York|Corning, New York]], a gaffer is a skilled artisan who blows through a long tube to shape molten glass into a variety of useful and/or artistic objects. A [[business district]] of Corning has been named{{by whom|date=July 2014}} "The Gaffer District" in honor of these artisans.

==First-line supervisors==

[[industrial-organizational psychology|I-O psychology]] research on first-line supervisors suggests that supervisors with the most productive work groups have the following qualities:
*Effective supervisors are person-centered. They rate higher in the consideration function than do unsuccessful supervisors. 
*Effective supervisors are supportive. They are more helpful to employees and more willing to defend them against criticism from higher management than are less effective supervisors.
*Effective supervisors are democratic. They hold frequent meetings with employees to solicit their views and encourage participation. Less effective supervisors are more autocratic.
*Effective supervisors are flexible. They allow employees to accomplish their goals in their own way whenever possible, consistent with the goals of the organization. Less effective supervisors dictate how a job is to be performed and permit no deviation.
*Effective supervisors describe themselves as coaches rather than directors. They emphasize quality, provide clear directions, and give timely feedback to their workers.

'''Swansea city centre''' in [[Swansea]], [[Wales]], contains the main shopping, leisure and nightlife district in Swansea.  The city centre covers much of the [[Castle, Swansea|Castle]] ward including the area around Oxford Street, Castle Square, and the [[Quadrant Shopping Centre]]; Alexandra Road, High Street, Wind Street and the Castle; Parc Tawe; and the [[Maritime Quarter]] extending down to the seafront.&lt;ref name="CCSF"&gt;[http://www4.swansea.gov.uk/SCCStrategicFramework/media/pdf/6/o/strategic_framework_final_proofred_may07.pdf Swansea city centre Strategic Framework]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|History of Swansea}}

Swansea's early 18th century industrial development shaped the development of today's city centre.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt; However, the heart of the city centre was bombed severely in 1941 in what is now termed the "Three Nights Blitz".&lt;ref name="SwanseaAnIllustratedHistory"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many local businesses had to be relocated just outside the area of devastation. The small area of [[Georgian era|Georgian]] streets around the Old Town Hall (now the [[Dylan Thomas Centre]]) and later buildings including the former Head Post Office on Wind Street, Swansea Harbour Trust Office (now [[Morgans Hotel, Swansea|Morgans Hotel]]), the [[Castle cinema]] and the Carlton Cinema on Oxford Street (now a [[Waterstone's]] bookshop) are rare survivors of the former streets and buildings.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt;

The bombing necessitated the complete rebuilding of the city centre, a task which fell upon the [[county borough]] of Swansea.  Preliminary plans were drawn up in 1943, a Compulsory Purchase order was obtained in 1946 and reconstruction work began in 1947.  The reconstruction task took over thirty years to accomplish.&lt;ref name="SwanseaAnIllustratedHistory" /&gt;

The new centre was planned on a grid-pattern of roads including the main thoroughfares of Kingsway, Princess Way, West Way and Oystermouth Road. At the time of the initial post-war rebuilding, the River Tawe riverfront and the South Dock (now the Maritime Quarter) were still port and industrial areas, separated from the commercial district
by railway viaducts and roads.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt; With the old shopping centre on High Street flattened, Swansea's main shopping district was rebuilt around the new Kingsway.

Redevelopment continued into the 1980s, including the construction of the [[Quadrant Shopping Centre]], [[St. David's Shopping Centre (Swansea)|St. David's Shopping Centre]], [[Civic Centre, Swansea|County Hall]], Parc Tawe and the demolition of railway viaducts at Victoria Road. These developments reinforced the city centre as a largely retail centre with only limited office accommodation and housing.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt; In recent years, a greater mix of uses has been encouraged in the city centre with the regeneration of the Maritime Quarter, Wind Street and Salubrious Place,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swansea.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=15698 City and County of Swansea - Salubrious Place] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606025319/http://www.swansea.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=15698 |date=6 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the opening of the [[National Waterfront Museum]] and the refurbishment of [[Swansea Leisure Centre]].&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt;

==Economy==
{{see also|Economy of Swansea}}

Swansea city centre provides about 24,000 jobs, or about 18% of jobs in the wider urban area.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt; This is a low figure when compared to many other UK cities, which often have around a quarter, a third or even more of their employment in the city centre.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt; Retail, hotel and restaurant jobs are strongly represented in Swansea city centre, and there is a growing finance and business services sector, but much of the employment that would normally be found in a city centre has instead been located in outer areas of Swansea.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt;

===Retail===
The city centre currently features {{convert|89650|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} of comparison goods floorspace (clothing, furniture, electrical goods etc.) and {{convert|22950|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} of convenience goods floorspace (food and groceries).&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt; According to an analysis cited in the City Centre Strategic Framework, Swansea is the eighteenth largest retail centre in the UK, relatively large for its population. However, the general quality, range and size of city centre shops is poor, so Swansea is usually ranked outside the top 50 retail centres in the UK on various industry listings.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt; The poor retail performance is believed to be the result of several factors, including poor urban design, lack of recent development and competition from [[retail park|out-of-town]] shops at [[Fforestfach]] and [[Morfa, Swansea|Morfa]].&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt;

===Offices===
Swansea city centre is not a major office location, although there are office premises including the [[BT Tower, Swansea|BT Tower]] near [[Swansea Castle]], Oldway House/Alexandra House on High Street/Alexandra Road and the [[JobCentre Plus]] building near the [[St. David's Shopping Centre]].&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt; In 2002, there was {{convert|147960|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} of office space in the city centre as a whole, and {{convert|30360|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} in the retail core.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt; Relatively low rents, generally less than £86 per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (£8 per sq. ft), underline the weakness of the city centre office market.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt; However, an additional {{convert|65000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} is planned at [[SA1 Swansea Waterfront]], adjacent to the city centre, and rents of £140 per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (£13 per sq. ft) have been achieved here.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt; The City Centre Strategic Framework notes that this demonstrates that a commercially viable office market can eventually be developed in Swansea city centre.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt;

==Areas==
[[File:Swansea from kilvey hill.jpg|thumb|right|Swansea city centre and [[Swansea Bay]] seen from [[Kilvey Hill]]]]

===Swansea Market/Quadrant Centre vicinity===
[[Swansea Market]], the [[Quadrant Shopping Centre]] and the St. David's Shopping Centre are situated in the middle of the city centre.  The Quadrant Centre opened in the late 1970s and dominated by chain stores. It includes an adjacent [[multi-storey car park]] that opens directly into [[Debenhams]] on one floor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swansea.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=2901 City and County of Swansea - Quadrant MSCP details]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swansea bus station]] is located on the western side of the centre, and [[Swansea Grand Theatre]] is next door to the station on Singleton Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swansea.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1836 City and County of Swansea - Directions to the Grand]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Tesco]] superstore is located immediately south-east of the Quadrant.

===High Street===
High Street was once the main shopping street in Swansea and formed the central axis of the shopping centre.  It was completely destroyed in [[World War II]].  Leaving just a few buildings standing gutted including half of the now demolished Woolworth Building, the Elysium Cinema building, the New Castle Buildings and smaller stores to the northern end including the historical Bush Inn (demolished in 2013).
The High Street has a large indoor arcade filled with small local business including a Cafe (Arcade Cafe) a crafty shop, a hair extensions shop, a barbers, Army surplus store, A sewing training store, an clothing alterations shop, kids clothing shop (which used to be 2nds clothing)
[[Swansea Castle]] is to be found at the southern end of the street.  Opposite the castle is the Castle Square.  Towards the northern end is [[Swansea railway station]] and the Swansea Grand Hotel.  The stretch between the castle and railway station is dominated by local retailers, discount retailers and a few pubs, restaurants, fast-food outlets and 2 of Swansea's gay bars, Pulse and The Kings.  The street becomes mainly residential, north of the railway station.  In this residential stretch, there is one wedged shaped building on the corner with Prince of Wales Street.  This is the [[Palace theatre, Swansea|Palace theatre]], the venue where [[Anthony Hopkins]] staged his first professional performance, the oldest theatre in Wales, one of only 2 remaining purpose built music halls left in the United Kingdom and the first place in Wales to screen a moving picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_west/3239364.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Oldest theatre under hammer | date=26 November 2003 | accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was once used as a nightclub but is now mostly derelict.

===The Kingsway===
Until the development of Wind Street as a nightlife zone, the Kingsway was the centre of night life in Swansea.  While many of the bars have shut down due to competition from Wind Street bars, the largest night clubs in Swansea are still located here.  Apart from the night life venues, The Kingsway has a number of banks, shops, fast food outlets and branch of the [[YMCA]].  Swansea's former main Post Office was located on this road too but recently moved to [[WH Smith]] inside the Quadrant Shopping Centre about {{convert|250|yd|m}} away.

In 2006, the Kingsway was re-engineered to become a one-way street for cars.  The southern traffic lanes are now dedicated two way bus lanes developed in conjunction with the [[First Cymru]]'s new [[Swansea Metro]] bus route.  At the eastern end of the Kingsway was a large roundabout incorporating a pedestrian subway.  The subway has now been filled in and the roundabout replaced with a traffic light crossroad and wider pedestrian walkways.

===Oxford Street===
Oxford Street is the main shopping street in Swansea which includes major retailers such as Marks and Spencer, Next and BHS. The eastern end of the street, close to Castle Square, is pedestrianised and dominated by chain stores. The western end features mass-market/down-market multiple stores and links to two arcades of very small independent retailers.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt; Further west, the street enters the [[Sandfields, Swansea|Sandfields]] area and is mainly residential. Street markets are held on Oxford Street, Princess Way and Castle Square over Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swanseachristmas.com/|publisher=City and County of Swansea|accessdate=30 June 2010|title=Swansea Christmas home}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wind Street/Salubrious Place===
[[File:TheNewYorkPubSwansea.jpg|thumb|right|The New York Pub on Princess Way, parallel to Wind Street]]
Wind Street ({{lang-cy|Stryd y Gwynt}}) has a name which nowadays means different things in the two languages. The local English pronunciation has shifted from {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɪ|n|d}} Street (i.e. with a meaning matching the Welsh name) to {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|aɪ|n|d}} Street (which doesn't). Wind Street was once a haunt of the poet [[Dylan Thomas]] and location of the covered alleyway 'Salubrious Passage'. It became a backwater in the second half of the 20th century when the commercial centre of Swansea shifted.  It boasts the highest concentration of listed buildings in Swansea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.swansea.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1524 | title=Listed Building Index | publisher=City and County of Swansea | year=2007 | accessdate=28 July 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809215656/http://www.swansea.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1524 | archivedate=9 August 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second World War]], the pubs of Wind Street saw the visit of a young star-to-be.  A group of American GIs stationed in Swansea entered the Adelphi pub.  An Australian soldier also stationed in Swansea saw this and proceeded to taunt the young GI, who was drinking milk, that he was not strong enough to drink alcohol.  Unfortunately for him he had picked on the young [[Rocky Marciano]] who went on to become one of the world's greatest heavyweight boxers.  Rocky floored him with one punch.  Marciano himself confirmed this story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_west/3100929.stm | title=Rocky's pub fight tribute | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=18 May 2009 | date=27 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following redevelopment at the beginning of the 21st century it is now known for its pubs, bars, clubs and restaurants, including the No-Sign Wine Bar and The Olde Cross Keys pub. The street developed a reputation for drunkenness and bad behaviour, leading to the local council introducing a curb on new pub and club licences in the city centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-23547201 | title=Swansea's 'debauched' Wind Street defended by businesses | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=27 January 2015 | date=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010 Wind Street had the second highest number of reported crimes in the whole of England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/Swansea-s-Wind-Street-second-violent-England-Wales/story-12454496-detail/story.html | title=Swansea's Wind Street tops list of crime-hit areas in England and Wales | work=South Wales Evening Post | accessdate=27 January 2015 | date=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the development of the street's lower, south-eastern end was completed, as 'Salubrious Place',{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} including an Aspers Casino, a Vue Cinema, a [[Premier Inn]] hotel, parking and additional eating and drinking venues. The casino closed in 2012 and Salubrious Place went into receivership in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sion Barry | url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/business/business-news/swanseas-salubrious-place-scheme-receivership-5390710 | title=Swansea's Salubrious Place scheme in receivership  |work=Wales Online | accessdate=27 January 2015 | date=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; though in 2014 new plans were announced to re-invent the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/Continental-revamp-leisure-quarter/story-22761904-detail/story.html | title='Continental' revamp submitted for Salubrious Place | work=South Wales Evening Post | accessdate=27 January 2015 | date=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Princess Way===
[[File:St Marys Church Swansea.JPG|thumb|left|[[St Mary's Church, Swansea|St. Mary's Church]]]]
[[File:SwanseaCastlePlaza.jpg|thumb|right|Castle Square]]
Princess Way ({{lang-cy|Ffordd y Dywysoges}}) links Kingsway Circle to the north with Oystermouth Road to the south. The northern section of the street is fully pedestrianised and is fronted with shops. The southern section is fronted with pubs, restaurants and offices and has a [[Travelodge]] hotel, a [[Vue (cinema)|Vue]] cinema and [[Aspers]] casino. The central portion of Princess Way opens onto two [[town square]]s.

Castle Square links Princess Way with Castle Street. Castle Square is a concreted square that slopes upwards towards steps to [[Swansea Castle]] to the east forming an [[amphitheatre]]-like space. It has grass verges and a few trees on its sides, and two fountains. The square is faced to the south by Caer Street which is lined with shops in buildings with a [[Tudorbethan architecture|mock Tudor]] facade. In July 2008, a new permanent [[BBC]] TV big screen was constructed on the southern corner of Castle Square, which will show BBC coverage of [[Beijing 2008]] and [[London 2012]] as well as local content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2002/05_may/29/swansea_bigscreen.shtml BBC Press Office: Swansea gets Big Screen spectacular]&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Mary's Square links Princess Way with Whitewalls. [[St Mary's Church, Swansea|St. Mary's Church]] sits in the middle of the square. It is fronted by the [[Quadrant Centre]] to the east; a clothes shop to the north; and offices and shops to the south.

===Parc Tawe===
[[Parc Tawe]] is an area on the west bank of the [[River Tawe]] in the [[Lower Swansea valley]]. The area includes several "out-of-town" style stores and entertainment units. There are car parking spaces in this area, but at peak periods it is subject to traffic congestion. A highly visible building is the [[Plantasia]] - a large triangular tropical plant house. Entertainments in the area include a 10 screen cinema and a [[ten pin bowling]] alley.

==Entry and exit roads==

===St Helen's Road and Oystermouth Road===
St Helens Road is the main route to the city centre from the south west of Swansea. The south side of the street is dominated by fast food outlets, restaurants, ethnic grocery stores and ethnic restaurants. Bryn-y-mor Road links to St. Helen's where many student bars and more restaurants can be found. The north side of the street has a number of solicitors and health centres.  The road continues past the Guildhall and connects with Oystermouth Road. Oystermouth Road begins near the [[Swansea Leisure Centre|Leisure Centre]] and separates the shopping area of the city centre with the [[Maritime Quarter]]. It continues along the coast of [[Swansea Bay]] towards [[Mumbles]]. The north of the road has a number of [[Bed and Breakfast]] establishments near the city centre area.

===Walter Road===
Walter Road is the main route from the city centre to the west, including the [[Uplands, Swansea|Uplands]] district. Most of the road is lined with substantial three-storey town houses, many of which have been converted for use by small professional practices like accountants, solicitors, estate agents, civil engineers and surveyors. A few properties are still residential, nearly all divided into flats and bedsits.

The side streets around Walter Road are mainly residential, with mostly three bedroomed properties, mainly occupied by families. A number of properties have been converted into bedsits for use by students of [[Swansea University]] south of Walter Road and the University of Wales Trinity Saint David north of Walter Road.

===Carmarthen Road===
Carmarthen Road is a dual carriageway stretch of the [[A483 road|A483]] which runs NW from the Dyfatty traffic junction in the city centre. Carmarthen Road has a mix of developments including residential, retail and commercial parks and industrial units.

===Fabian Way===
Fabian Way, a stretch of the A483, departs the city centre to the east. It bypasses [[St. Thomas, Swansea|St. Thomas]] and [[Port Tennant]] to the north; and [[Swansea Docks]] and the [[SA1 Swansea Waterfront]] development to the south. It continues through [[Crymlyn Burrows]] where it connects with the [[M4 Motorway]] at the Earlswood junction (M4 Junction 42). This is considered as the main gateway to the city centre from the east, because of the connection to the M4 and [[Neath Port Talbot]].

==Plans==

In January 2007, developers [[Hammerson]] and [[Urban Splash]] were chosen for a £1&amp;nbsp;billion redevelopment of the city centre.  The two developers previously collaborated on [[Birmingham]]'s [[Bull Ring, Birmingham|Bullring]] development.  The plan by architects BDP,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bdp.com/en/News/2008/BDPs-masterplan-for-Swansea-wins |title=BDP's £1bn masterplan for Swansea wins |accessdate=28 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006084938/http://www.bdp.com/en/News/2008/BDPs-masterplan-for-Swansea-wins/ |archivedate=6 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; includes more than {{convert|60000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} of additional retail space; 1,000 homes; new leisure, office, hotel and conference facilities;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_west/7174815.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Developers chosen for £1bn revamp | date=7 January 2008 | accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "European Boulevard" incorporating Oystermouth Road and Quay Parade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.swansea.gov.uk/SCCStrategicFramework/index.cfm?articleid=23582 Swansea City Centre Strategic Framework - European Boulevard] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606025220/http://www4.swansea.gov.uk/SCCStrategicFramework/index.cfm?articleid=23582 |date=6 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former [[House of Fraser|David Evans]] department store has been replaced with a new development incorporating five stores trading over two floors, providing {{convert|58000|sqft|m2|abbr=on|disp=flip}} of retail space. [[Zara (clothing)|Zara]], [[Slater Menswear|Slater's Menswear]] and JT Morgan have signed up for the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swansea.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=10844 |title=Re-development of the Former David Evans Department Store |accessdate=28 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805170611/http://www.swansea.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=10844 |archivedate=5 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2011 The Gym Group opened a gym on the first floor of the development.

In December 2008, the Council sought expressions of interest from contractors for the redevelopment of the [[Quadrant bus station]]. The Council said that it hopes to award the contract in May 2009, with work starting soon after. The project was planned to take around 15 months to complete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swansea.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=26546 City and County of Swansea - Countdown to construction work on Quadrant Interchange begins]&lt;/ref&gt; The new bus station duly opened on 6 December 2010, though with many finishing touches not added until early 2011.

==Transport==
The city centre is served by buses at the [[Swansea bus station]] and by trains at [[Swansea railway station]] at the northern end of High Street.  Additional bus stops are located on the Kingsway and on St. Mary's Square. A single [[bus rapid transit]] route marketed as ''[[Swansea Metro]]'' runs through the centre.

There are three [[Park and Ride]] sites with dedicated buses serving the city centre, all operated by [[First Cymru]]:
