'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to public information is guaranteed by the Constitution of the [[Republic of Macedonia]] (Article 16). To implement this constitutional right, the Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia in January 2006 adopted the Law on Free Access to Public Information defining the procedures for exercising this right. The Law has been significantly amended at the beginning of 2010.&lt;ref name=Academia.edu&gt;{{cite journal |author=Suzana Dzamtoska-Zdravkovska|date=2012 |title=Free Access to Public Information - More Transparency, Less Corruption: The case of Republic of Macedonia |url=https://www.academia.edu/3023686/Free_Access_to_Public_Information-More_Transparency_Less_Corruption_The_Case_of_Republic_of_Macedonia |publisher=eprints.ugd.edu.mk |issue= |access-date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a research carried out by the [[Centre for Law and Democracy]], Macedonia is in the high 14th place on the world ranking list of states having the most functional law on free access to public information, despite the fact that this right has been introduced into Macedonian legal system in a relatively recent period.&lt;ref name=Academia.edu/&gt; However, according to the [[European Commission]], the implementation of the Law on Free Access to Public Information remains ineffective.&lt;ref name="EC2015" /&gt;

==FOI provisions under the law==

The '''Law on Free Access to Information''' stresses the obligation of the institutions to provide information with precise deadlines: it allows individuals and legal entities to exercise their right of access to public information and obliges the holders of information to provide information to the public.&lt;ref name=Academia.edu/&gt;

The public authorities subject to the law are governmental institutions and other bodies and institutions set by law, municipal bodies, public institutions and services, public enterprises and natural persons and legal entities performing a public service.&lt;ref name=Academia.edu/&gt; In general, all information available to the public authorities holding the information is public.&lt;ref name=Academia.edu/&gt; Access to them may be refused in exceptional cases determined by law.&lt;ref name=Academia.edu/&gt;

The holders of information are obliged to keep records and to update the list of information in their disposal and to publish them in a manner available to the public. Also, they are obliged to provide premises for inspection of the requested information.&lt;ref name=sep.gov&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sep.gov.mk/en/content/?id=93#.WKsLx2_hCUl |title=Free access to information |last= |first= |date= |website=Sep.gov.mk |publisher=Government of the Republic of Macedonia. Secretariat for European Affairs |access-date=20 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All institutions subject to the law are required to appoint officials for handling access to information requests. They are the reference point for the citizens willing to exercise their right to access public information.&lt;ref name=Academia.edu/&gt; The holder of the information is obliged to inform the public on the official person responsible for mediating information. The appointed person for mediating information shall provide the necessary information, help the applicant and keep special records for receipt of the applications for information.&lt;ref name=sep.gov/&gt;

Applicants can submit the requests in writing or orally. Reviewing the documents at the institution's building is free of charge. Costs of photocopying, transcribing, translating or delivering the documents can be charged to the applicant.&lt;ref name=BIRN&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |title=Transparency in the Balkans and Moldova |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/file/show/Transparency-in-the-Balkans-and-Moldova.pdf |publisher=Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN)|issue= |access-date= 20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decision on the request should be made within 30 days.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt; Access to information can be refused if it threatens national or public security; the economy; the environment; commercial or private legitimate interests; monetary and exchange policies; or if interferes with the prevention of criminal offences.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt;

The [[Commission for Protection of the Right to Free Access to Public Information]] (KOMSPI) is in charge for providing information to the citizens regarding access to information, monitoring the implementation of the  law and delivering regular annual reports on the application of the Law to the Parliament. Also, the Commission conducts seminars and trainings aiming at educating public officials in their duties to implement the access to public information law.&lt;ref name=Academia.edu/&gt; According to the 2015 [[European Commission]] Progress Report 2015 the Commission does not have sufficient capacity to monitor compliance with proactive disclosure of information, and has not the power to impose sanctions to better enforce the legislation.&lt;ref name=EC2015&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/pdf/key_documents/2015/20151110_report_the_former_yugoslav_republic_of_macedonia.pdf |title=The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Report 2015 |last= |first= |date=10 November 2015 |website=ec.europa.eu |publisher=European Commission |access-date=20 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The applicant has the right to appeal against a refusal. The first complaint is to the Commission for Protection of the Right to Free Access to Public Information; in case the applicant is not satisfied with the decision, he/she can launch a judicial review.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt;

==Access to public information in practice==

Despite the good legal framework, the implementation of the Law on Free Access to Public Information remains ineffective.&lt;ref name=EC2015/&gt; Penalties are not imposed for failure to comply.&lt;ref name=EC2015/&gt; Political parties are excluded from the list of holders of information, thus they are outside the scope of the law.&lt;ref name=EC2015/&gt;

According to journalists, there is a tendency by public authorities to over-use the "classification" of documents to prevent public access to information.&lt;ref name=EC2015/&gt; According to [[Freedom House]], the law is unevenly and selectively enforced, with official denying responses and shunning independent or critical media outlets.&lt;ref name=FreedomHouse&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freedominfo.org/2013/11/belief-in-access-rights-found-low-in-macedonian-survey/ |title=Belief in Access Rights Found Low in Macedonian Survey |last= |first= |date=21 November 2013 |website=freedominfo.org |publisher=Freedominfo.org. The global network of freedom of information advocates|access-date=20 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To monitor and test the implementation of the law, in 2012 the [[MYLA|Macedonian Young Lawyers Association]] (MYLA) submitted 145 requests for free access to information of public interest to a number of state institutions. More than two thirds of the information holders responded within the legal time limit and delivered the requested information.&lt;ref name=EDRI&gt;{{cite web |url=https://edri.org/edrigramnumber10-16macedonia-acces-to-public-information-study |title=Macedonia: Serious channelges for access to public information |date=29 August 2012 |website=edri.org |publisher=European Digital Rights|access-date=20 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some problems of implementation and difficulties emerged, such as the practice of redirecting the requests towards other state institutions, instead of delivering it.&lt;ref name=EDRI/&gt;

According to a survey conducted in 2013 by the [[Open Society Foundations|Foundation Open Society]] - Macedonia, a significant share of Macedonian citizens does not believe they are entitled to have the right of access to public information and request informations of public interest.&lt;ref name=FreedomHouse/&gt; According to the survey, more than half of citizens had never heard and were unaware of the Law on Free Access to Public Information; only 13% of them were well knowledgeable about the Law.&lt;ref name=FreedomHouse/&gt;

'''Ackermann set theory''' is a version of [[axiomatic set theory]] proposed by [[Wilhelm Ackermann]] in 1956.

== The language==
Ackermann set theory is formulated in [[first-order logic]]. The language &lt;math&gt;L_A&lt;/math&gt; consists of one binary relation &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; and one constant &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; (Ackermann used a predicate &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; instead). We will write &lt;math&gt;x \in y&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\in(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;. The intended interpretation of &lt;math&gt;x \in y&lt;/math&gt; is that the object &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is in the class &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. The intended interpretation of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the class of all sets.

== The axioms==
The axioms of Ackermann set theory, collectively referred to as A, consists of the [[Universal quantifier|universal closure]] of the following formulas in the language &lt;math&gt;L_A&lt;/math&gt;

1) [[Axiom of extensionality]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y ( \forall z (z \in x \leftrightarrow z \in y)
\rightarrow x = y).&lt;/math&gt;

2) [[Axiom of separation|Class construction axiom schema]]: Let &lt;math&gt;F(y,z_1, \dots, z_n)&lt;/math&gt; be any formula which does not contain the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; free. 
:&lt;math&gt;\forall y (F(y, z_1, \dots, z_n) \rightarrow y \in V) \rightarrow \exists x \forall y (y \in x \leftrightarrow F(y,z_1, \dots, z_n) )&lt;/math&gt;

3) Reflection axiom schema: Let &lt;math&gt;F(y,z_1, \dots, z_n)&lt;/math&gt; be any formula which does not contain the constant symbol &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; or the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; free. If &lt;math&gt; z_1, \dots, z_n \in V&lt;/math&gt; then
:&lt;math&gt;\forall y (F(y, z_1, \dots, z_n) \rightarrow y \in V) \rightarrow \exists x (x \in V \land \forall y (y \in x \leftrightarrow F(y, z_1, \dots, z_n))).&lt;/math&gt;

4) Completeness axioms for &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x \in y \land y \in V \rightarrow x \in V&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes called the axiom of heredity)
:&lt;math&gt;x \subseteq y \land y \in V \rightarrow x \in V.&lt;/math&gt;

5) [[Axiom of regularity|Axiom of regularity for sets]]:
:&lt;math&gt;x \in V \land \exists y ( y \in x) \rightarrow \exists y ( y \in x \land \lnot \exists z (z \in y \land z \in x)).&lt;/math&gt;

==Relation to Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory==
Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be a [[First-order logic|first-order formula]] in the language &lt;math&gt;L_\in = \{\in\}&lt;/math&gt; (so &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; does not contain the constant &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;). Define the "restriction of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; to the universe of sets" (denoted &lt;math&gt;F^V&lt;/math&gt;) to be the formula which is obtained by recursively replacing all [[sub-formulas]] of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; of the form &lt;math&gt;\forall x G(x,y_1\dots, y_n)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\forall x (x \in V \rightarrow G(x,y_1\dots, y_n))&lt;/math&gt; and all sub-formulas of the form &lt;math&gt;\exists x G(x,y_1\dots, y_n)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\exists x (x \in V \land G(x,y_1\dots, y_n))&lt;/math&gt;. 

In 1959 [[Azriel Levy]] proved that if &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a formula of &lt;math&gt;L_\in&lt;/math&gt; and A proves &lt;math&gt;F^V&lt;/math&gt;, then [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]] proves &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;

In 1970 [[William Reinhardt (mathematician)|William Reinhardt]] proved that if &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a formula of &lt;math&gt;L_\in&lt;/math&gt; and ZF proves &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, then A proves &lt;math&gt;F^V&lt;/math&gt;.

== Ackermann set theory and Category theory ==
The most remarkable feature of Ackermann set theory is that, unlike [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]], a [[proper class]] can be an element of another proper class (see Fraenkel, Bar-Hillel, Levy(1973), p. 153).

An extension (named ARC) of Ackermann set theory was developed by F.A. Muller(2001), who stated that ARC "founds Cantorian set-theory as well as category-theory and therefore can pass as a founding theory of the whole of mathematics".{{citation-needed|date=June 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4674">In [[mathematics]], the '''Almgren–Pitts min-max theory''' (named after [[Frederick J. Almgren, Jr.]] and his student [[Jon T. Pitts]]) is an analogue of [[Morse theory]] for [[hypersurface]]s.

The theory started with the efforts for generalizing [[George David Birkhoff]]'s method for the construction of simple closed [[geodesic]]s on the sphere, to allow the construction of [[embedding|embedded]] [[minimal surface]]s in arbitrary [[3-manifold]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tobias Colding]] and [[Camillo De Lellis]]: "[https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0303305v2.pdf The min-max construction of minimal surfaces]", Surveys in Differential Geometry&lt;/ref&gt;

It has played roles in the solutions to a number of [[conjecture]]s in [[geometry]] and [[topology]] found by Almgren and Pitts themselves and also by other mathematicians, such as [[Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov|Mikhail Gromov]], [[Richard Schoen]], [[Shing-Tung Yau]], [[Fernando Codá Marques]], [[André Neves]], [[Ian Agol]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://numdam.mathdoc.fr/numdam-bin/item?id=ASNSP_2006_5_5_4_483_0 |author1=Giaquinta, Mariano |author2=Mucci, Domenico |title=The BV-energy of maps into a manifold : relaxation and density results |publisher=Annali della Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa – Classe di Scienze, Sér. 5, 5|number=4 |date=2006 |pages=483–548}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helge Holden, Ragni Piene – The Abel Prize 2008-2012, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Osserman]] – A Survey of Minimal Surfaces, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://intlpress.com/site/pub/pages/journals/items/cdm/content/vols/2013/0001/a001/index.html |title=Content Online - CDM 2013 Article 1 |publisher=Intlpress.com |accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~aneves/papers/CDM-harvard3.pdf |format=PDF |title=Applications of Almgren-Pitts Min-max theory |author1=Fernando C.

'''Bhumika''' ([[Sanskrit]]: भूमिका) is derived from the word, ''Bhūmi'', which means – the earth, soil, ground, land, a site, situation, land, a story, character or part or situation. The word, ''Bhūmikā'', refers to a tablet or board for writing, subject, object or a receptacle, theatrical dress or an actor’s costume, decoration of an image, a preface or introduction to a book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=Vaman Shivram Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A5%82%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Sthaviravāda Saravastivada'' tradition of [[Buddhism]] amongst the 49/52 mental factors (''Bhūmikās'') are the ten ''mahā-bhūmikās'' which are common to all consciousness are – '' [[Vedanā]] '' (feeling), '' [[Saññā]] '' (perception), '' [[Cetanā]] '' (volition), '' [[Phassa]] '' (contact), '' [[Chanda (Buddhism)|Chanda]] '' (desire to act), '' [[Paññā]] '' (wisdom), '' [[Sati (Buddhism)|Sati]] '' (mindfulness), '' [[Manasikāra]] '' (attention), '' [[Adhimokkha]] '' (decision), '' [[Samādhi]] '' (mental concentration)or '' [[Ekaggata]] '' (one-pointedness),

The [[Upanishads]] speak about the seven ''bhūmikās'' or ''jñānabhūmis'' (fields of knowledge) or the seven stages of development of wisdom, and about the four kinds of ''jivanmuktas''. In Chapter IV of the Varahā [[Upanishad]], with regard to the characteristics of ''jivanmukti'', [[Ribhu]] tells Nigadha that the first ''bhūmikā'' or stage of development is ''subhechchha'' or good desires; the second ''bhūmikā'' is ''vichārāna'' or inquiry; the third ''bhūmikā'' is ''[[Tanumanasi|tanumānasī]]'' or pertaining to the thinned mind; the fourth ''bhūmikā'' is ''sattvāpatti'' or the attainment of ''sattva''; the fifth ''bhūmikā'' is ''asamśakti'' or non-attachment; the sixth ''bhūmikā'' is ''padārthabhāvanā'' or analysis of objects, and the seventh ''bhūmikā'' is ''[[turiya]] '' or the final stage. Nigadha is also told that the bhūmikā which is of the form of ''[[Om|pranava]] '' is formed of ''akāra'', ''ukāra'', ''makāra'' and the ''ardhamātra''.  The ''turiya'' essence of ''akāra'' embraces the first, second and the third ''bhūmikās'' whose function is called ''mumukshu''; the ''turiya'' essence of ''ukāra'' embraces the fourth bhūmikā when the mind is firmly fixed on the non-dual and is called ''brahmavit''; the ''turiya'' essence of ''makāra'' embraces the fifth ''bhūmikā'' or ''sushuptipada'' (dreamless sleep) and is called ''brahmavidvara''; the ''turiya'' essence of ''ardhamātra'' embraces the sixth ''bhūmikā'' (dreamless state) and is called ''brahmavidvariya'', beyond which is the seventh ''bhūmikā'' or ''gudhasupti'' and is called ''brahmavidvarishta'' when one remains in the secondless state without fear and with his consciousness almost annihilated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thirty-Minor Upanishads|author=IslamKotob|page=232|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CvXZ0j1UyAAC&amp;pg=PA232&amp;dq=sakshi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JCUxU9rTCsWKrQflmICgAg&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yajna bhumika is the altar on which Vedic rituals are conducted.

The show was the second [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''[[Pawn Stars]]'', but unlike fellow spin-offs ''[[American Restoration]]'' and ''[[Counting Cars]]'', it is entirely unrelated to the venue and staff of ''Pawn Stars''.

Following its fourth and final season in 2012, the show went on hiatus, before effectively being canceled as the contract option date passed without renewal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20130620/NEWS01/306200027/Future-Pawn-Stars-remains-undecided?gcheck=1|title=Future of 'Cajun Pawn Stars' undecided|last=Belgard|first=Jodi|date=20 January 2013|publisher=The Town Talk|accessdate=12 April 2014}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
''Cajun Pawn Stars'' revolves around another [[family business|family-owned]] pawn shop, the Silver Dollar Pawn &amp; Jewelry Center in [[Alexandria, Louisiana]], which is owned by Jimmie "Big Daddy" DeRamus, who runs the store along with his wife Peggy, his brother Johnnie, and daughter Tammie.&lt;ref name=TownTalk121911/&gt; The shop claims to have over 100,000 items within its 20,000 square foot showroom.&lt;ref name=TownTalk121911/&gt;

The show's format is similar to the original ''Pawn Stars'', as it features an array of collectible, antique and unusual items that people sell or pawn, complemented with "[[Pop-Up Video|pop-up]]" facts related to the item.  Also, as with the original series, the shop sometimes consults an expert to give an appraisal/opinion on the item being sold or pawned.  In addition, at the second commercial break, a trivia question is asked in relation to the shop or item, as with ''Pawn Stars''.

While the show is named ''"Cajun" Pawn Stars'', Alexandria, where the pawn shop is located, is the [[county seat|parish seat]] of [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana]], which is not considered part of [[Acadiana]], the hub of [[Cajun]] culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7886">The field of '''conflict early warning''' seeks to forecast the outbreak of [[armed conflict]], or, at minimum, to detect the early escalation of violence, with the objective of preventing the outbreak or the further escalation of violence in order to save lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Rupesinghe |editor1-first=Kumar |editor1-link=Kumar Rupesinghe |editor2-last=Kuroda |editor2-first=Michiko |date=1992 |title=Early warning and conflict resolution |location=New York |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |isbn=0312085648 |oclc=25834272 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Initial conceptions of conflict early warning materialized in the 1970s and 1980s but the field really emerged on the international policy agenda after the end of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name="Nyheim"&gt;{{cite conference |last=Nyheim |first=David |authorlink=David Nyheim |date=18 May 2008 |title=Can violence, war, and state collapse be prevented?

This is the approach taken by the [[International Crisis Group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Grono |first=Nick |date=11 November 2006 |title=The challenge of anticipating conflict |url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/publication-type/speeches/2006/the-challenge-of-anticipating-conflict.aspx |website=crisisgroup.org |publisher=[[International Crisis Group]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808235619/http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/publication-type/speeches/2006/the-challenge-of-anticipating-conflict.aspx |archivedate=2010-08-08 |accessdate=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example. In contrast, quantitative methodologies quantify conflict trends and use mathematical techniques to forecast future trends or "events of interest" (EOIs) such as the onset of conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chadefaux |first=Thomas |date=January 2014 |title=Early warning signals for war in the news |journal=[[Journal of Peace Research]] |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=5–18 |doi=10.1177/0022343313507302 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thomas_Chadefaux/publication/256044330_Early_Warning_Signals_for_War_in_the_News/links/0c96052a992664d50d000000.pdf |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Integrated Conflict Early Warning System]] (ICEWS) project at the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) takes this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Brien |first=Sean P. |date=March 2010 |title=Crisis early warning and decision support: contemporary approaches and thoughts on future research |journal=[[International Studies Review]] |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=87–104 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2486.2009.00914.x |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some approaches to conflict early warning combine both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, such as [[Swisspeace]]'s formerly operational project called FAST.&lt;ref name="FAST"&gt;{{cite book |last=Krummenacher |first=Heinz |date=2006 |chapter=Computer assisted early warning—the FAST example |editor-last=Trappl |editor-first=Robert |editor-link=Robert Trappl |title=Programming for peace: computer-aided methods for international conflict resolution and prevention |series=Advances in group decision and negotiation |volume=2 |location=Dordrecht |publisher=[[Springer Verlag]] |pages=71–80 |isbn=1402043775 |oclc=63764074 |doi=10.1007/1-4020-4390-2_4 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=o6Fv7XFhQgMC&amp;pg=PA71 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The unanticipated events of the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973 and that of the [[Falklands War]] in 1982 provoked a series of debates over the lack of early warning. The incident over the Falklands had taken the [[United Nations]] completely by surprise and it is said "no map of the islands was available in the Secretariat when the invasion began".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peck |first=Connie |date=1998 |title=Sustainable peace: the role of the UN and regional organizations in preventing conflict |series=Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict series |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |isbn=0847685608 |oclc=37180967 |page=[//books.google.com/books?id=zycKkwkkzNAC&amp;pg=PA72 72] |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial drivers, however, were humanitarian agencies "driven by the need for accurate and timely predictions of refugee flows to enable effective contingency planning".&lt;ref name="Nyheim"/&gt; After the end of the Cold War, political scientists at leading academic institutions began modifying old Cold War models of conflict to understand the onset of new wars. The horrors of the 1994 [[Rwandan genocide]] also spurred increased interest in operational conflict early warning systems. The FAST project of Swisspeace&lt;ref name="FAST"/&gt; and the [[Forum on Early Warning and Early Response]] (FEWER) were responses to the [[genocide]].

'''Darwin's World''', created by [[Dominic Covey]], is a [[post-apocalyptic]] [[role-playing game]] first published under the [[d20 System|d20]] [[Open Game License]] in 2001.  Originally designed as a quick adaptation of the 3rd Edition [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] rules, the game has since been greatly expanded and revised and now utilizes the [[d20 Modern]] rules.  Several ''Darwin's World'' books and supplements have seen print, though most support for the game is still only available in [[PDF]] format. In 2010, RPGObjects began producing game books using [[Pinnacle Entertainment Group|Pinnacle]]'s [[Savage Worlds]] system.

''Darwin's World'' was nominated for an [http://www.ennieawards.com/2002.html Ennie award] (Best d20 Game) in 2002.

The online [[online magazine|e-zine]], '''''Post Apocalyptic Dispatch''''', continues to provide short articles that support game play for both gamemasters and players alike. The game is still heavily supported with new material coming out on a regular basis.

==Mature Themes==
Unlike many existing post-apocalyptic role-playing games, ''Darwin's World'' is often described as a darker and more "realistic" game system.  In specific, its use of real-life deformities and genetic diseases to portray character defects, as well as issues like [[slavery]], racism, and drug use give it a grittier quality than most post-apocalyptic [[RPGs]], which often have a fantastic or "comic book" feel that requires a broader willingness to suspend disbelief.

==Versions 2.0 and 2.5==
While the original ''Darwin's World'' books clearly put forth a timeline and history, the second edition (and most recent edition, v2.5) has a broader focus intending to provide rules, suggestions, and guidelines for any kind of post-apocalyptic [[campaign setting]]. The default setting remains a wasteland created by global [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]]/[[Biological warfare|biological]]/[[chemical warfare]], however (See [[Weapon of mass destruction]]). There is a strong focus on regions that once constituted the [[Midwest]] and [[Western United States]]; numerous [[Adventure (role-playing games)|modules]] published for the game are nominally set in "desert" or "wasteland" areas. More specific locations include the desert trade town of [[Tucumcari, New Mexico|Tucumcari]], the sunken city of [[Bakersfield]] and its strange subterranean monsters, the overgrown [[ruins]] of [[Los Angeles]], a [[San Francisco]] overrun by anti-technology zealots, and a decadent society thriving in the futuristic [[domed cities]] of the Midwest.  One supplement went into great detail exploring the fate of the [[Pacific Northwest]].

==Game Supplements==
A wide range of supplements, [[sourcebook]]s, and modules are available for ''Darwin's World''.

* ''Darwin's World 2: Survivor's Handbook''.  The current edition of the basic rules.
* ''Cave of Life''.  A low-level adventure detailing an abandoned missile silo.
* ''The Lost City/Return To The Lost City''.  A journey to a monster-infested city sunken beneath the earth.
* ''Death By Corium Light''.  High-level adventure detailing the ''corium'' mines of Little Vegas.
* ''The Foundationists''.  A sourcebook detailing the setting's premier technology-crazed faction.
* ''Metal Gods''.  Rules for [[robot]]s and making [[Android (robot)|android]]s and [[cyborg]]s as [[player character|characters]].
* ''The Lost Paradise''.  A regional sourcebook detailing the Pacific Northwest.
* ''Terrors of The Lost Paradise''.  A sourcebook presenting new monsters.
* ''Against The Wastelords''.  A low-level adventure involving a desperate race to find a [[nuclear missile]].
* ''New World Order''.  A mid-level adventure that involves the characters in a war against a strange new enemy.
* ''The Last God''.  A high-level adventure pitting the characters against an animate and intelligent bioweapon that pre-dates the Fall.
* ''High Road To Hell''. [[Gen Con]] 2004 adventure.  A mid-level adventure utilizing a time limit mechanic.
* ''One Man's Garbage/Another Man's Treasure''. [[Gen Con]] 2005 adventure.  A mid-level adventure in which characters struggle to find the legendary "Mount of Thorns".
* ''Humanity In A Bottle''.  Boxed set sourcebook/module describing in detail a [[dystopian]] society long forgotten by the inhabitants of the world.
* ''The Broken and The Lost''.  A sourcebook presenting new rules for [[Primitive culture|savage]] characters, tribes, and societies.
* ''The Ruin at The End of The World''.  A sourcebook/module detailing the ruins of Los Angeles; also the first ''Darwin's World'' supplement to make use of [[supernatural]] story elements.
* ''Bad News In Bugtown''. [[Gen Con]] 2007 adventure.  A low-level adventure set in the ruins of [[Amarillo]].
* ''Halidom''.  Boxed set module detailing an epic [[Campaign (Role-playing games)|campaign]] against a notorious raider army, the "Doomriders".
* ''Secrets of The Mind Masters''.  A high-level adventure pitting the player characters against the super-psychics known as the "Savants".

==Real-Life Inspiration==
Numerous adventures written for ''Darwin's World'' either briefly feature, reference, or center around real-life places and events.  These include:

* The adventure, ''Cave of Life'', describes an old and abandoned Titan missile silo, accurately detailed.
* In ''The Last God'', the real-life town of Center, Colorado, is re-imagined as a covert biological weapons plant disguised as a small backwater town. The map used in the adventure is precisely modeled on the actual town.
* The "Mount of Thorns" that is the object of the player character's quest in ''Another Man's Garbage'' is the [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]].
* ''The Ruin at The End of The World'' features numerous Los Angeles landmarks. The [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] Arboretum is filled with giant mutant plants, the L.A. city library is inhabited by a mysterious [[vampire]], City Hall is a haunt for a gang of thugs, and the ruins of [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] are now home to a fledgling empire of half-man, half-beast creatures.
* The monument at [[Mount Rushmore]] plays a major role in the campaign adventure, "Halidom".
* Certain details of the [[Philadelphia Experiment]] are mentioned (and play an important role) in ''Secrets of The Mind Masters''.

==Related Works==
* ''Darwin's World'' was originally based on a [[play-by-email]] ("PBEM") game titled ''Necropolis'' (on which much of the material in ''Ruin at The End of The World'' is based).  A second ''pbem'' game (''Shadow of The Savants'') further fleshed out some of the background material for the game's ''Twisted Earth'' setting.
* ''Burning Lands'' is a [[post-apocalyptic]] [[science-fiction]] novel set some three centuries after [[World War III]], making use of the "Twisted Earth" setting.

In [[sociology]], '''deviance''' describes an action or behavior that violates [[norm (sociology)|social norms]], including a formally enacted rule (e.g., [[crime]]),&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Macionis |first=J. |last2=Gerber |first2=L. |year=2010 |title=Sociology |edition=7th Canadian |location=Toronto |publisher=Pearson |isbn=978-0-13-511927-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as informal violations of social norms (e.g., rejecting folkways and [[mores]]). Although deviance may have a negative connotation, the violation of social norms is not always a negative action; positive deviation exists in some situations. Although a norm is violated, a behavior can still be classified as positive or acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heckert|first=Alex|date=September 2002|title=a new typology of deviance:integrating normative and reactivist definitions of deviance|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=6&amp;sid=8166a1e2-8d9c-4391-b40f-4e9a99eb3ebe%40pdc-v-sessmgr01|journal=Deviant Behavior: An Interdisciplinary Journal|volume=23|pages=449-479|via=SOCindex}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Social norms differ from culture to culture. For example, a deviant act can be committed in one society but may be normal for another society.

Deviance is [[Relativism|relative]] to the place where it was committed or to the time the act took place. Killing another human is considered wrong, except when governments permit it during warfare or for self defense.  There are two types of major deviant actions, ''[[mala in se]]'' or ''[[mala prohibita|mala prohibits]] types.''

== Functions ==
Deviant acts can be assertions of individuality and identity, and thus as rebellion against [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/social-norms/ group norms] of the dominant culture and in favor of a sub-culture.

Deviance affirms cultural values and norms. It also clarifies moral boundaries, promotes social unity by creating an us/them dichotomy, encourages social change, and provides jobs to control deviance.&lt;ref name="Hastings, Stephanie E 2009"&gt;Hastings, Stephanie E. and Thomas A. O'Neil. "Predicting workplace deviance using broad versus narrow personality variables." Personality and Individual Differences.47 (2009):289–293.&lt;/ref&gt; "Certain factors of personality are theoretically and empirically related to workplace deviance, such as work environment, and individual differences."&lt;ref name="Kong, Travis S. K 2009"&gt;Kong, Travis S. K. More Than a Sex Machine: Accomplishing Masculinity Among Chinese Male Sex Workers in the Hong Kong Sex Industry. Deviant Behavior. 30 (2009)715–745.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories ==
Three broad sociological classes exist that describe deviant behavior, namely, [[functionalism (sociology)|structural functionalism]], [[symbolic interaction]] and [[conflict theory]].

=== Structural-functionalism ===
Social integration is the attachment to groups and institutions, while social regulation is the adherence to the norms and values of society. Those who are very integrated fall under the category of "altruism" and those who are not very integrated fall under "[[egotism]]." Similarly, those who are very regulated fall under "[[fatalism]]" and those who are very unregulated fall under "[[anomie]]".
Durkheim's theory attributes social deviance to extremes of the dimensions of the social bond. [[Altruistic]] suicide (death for the good of the group), egoistic suicide (death for the removal of the self-due to or justified by the lack of ties to others), and [[anomic]] suicide (death due to the confounding of self-interest and societal norms) are the three forms of suicide that can happen due to extremes. Likewise, individuals may commit crimes for the good of an individual's group, for the self-due to or justified by lack of ties, or because the societal norms that place the individual in check no longer have power due to society's corruption.

==== Durkheim's concept ====
[[Émile Durkheim #ÉmileDurkheim|Durkheim]] (1858–1917) claimed that deviance was in fact a normal and necessary part of social organization.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010" /&gt; When he studied deviance he stated four important functions of deviance.

# "Deviance affirms cultural values and norms. Any definition of virtue rests on an opposing idea of vice: There can be no good without evil and no justice without crime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macionis and Gerber|first=John, Linda|title=Sociology |edition=7th Canadian |year=2010|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc.|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-0-13-700161-3|pages=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Deviance defines moral boundaries, people learn right from wrong by defining people as deviant.
# A serious form of deviance forces people to come together and react in the same way against it.
# Deviance pushes society's moral boundaries which, in turn leads to social change.

==== Merton's strain theory ====
{{Main|Strain theory (sociology)}}
[[File:Mertons social strain theory.svg|right|250 px]]
[[Robert K. Merton]] discussed deviance in terms of goals and means as part of his strain/anomie theory. Where [[Émile Durkheim #ÉmileDurkheim|Durkheim]]  states that anomie is the confounding of social norms, Merton goes further and states that anomie is the state in which social goals and the legitimate means to achieve them do not correspond. He postulated that an individual's response to societal expectations and the means by which the individual pursued those goals were useful in understanding deviance. Specifically, he viewed collective action as motivated by strain, stress, or frustration in a body of individuals that arises from a disconnection between the society's ''goals'' and the popularly used ''means'' to achieve those goals. Often, non-routine collective behavior (rioting, rebellion, etc.) is said to map onto economic explanations and causes by way of strain. These two dimensions determine the adaptation to society according to the cultural goals, which are the society's perceptions about the ideal life, and to the institutionalized means, which are the legitimate means through which an individual may aspire to the cultural goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Paternoster | first1 = R. | last2 = Mazerolle | first2 = P. | doi = 10.1177/0022427894031003001 | title = General Strain Theory and Delinquency: A Replication and Extension | journal = Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 235 | year = 1994 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merton described 5 types of deviance in terms of the acceptance or rejection of social goals and the institutionalized means of achieving them:

'''1. Innovation''' is a response due to the strain generated by our culture's emphasis on wealth and the lack of opportunities to get rich, which causes people to be "innovators" by engaging in stealing and selling drugs. Innovators accept society's goals, but reject socially acceptable means of achieving them. (e.g.: monetary success is gained through crime). Merton claims that innovators are mostly those who have been socialised with similar world views to conformists, but who have been denied the opportunities they need to be able to legitimately achieve society's goals.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010" /&gt;

'''2. Conformists''' accept society's goals and the socially acceptable means of achieving them (e.g.: monetary success is gained through hard work). Merton claims that conformists are mostly middle-class people in middle class jobs who have been able to access the opportunities in society such as a better education to achieve monetary success through hard work.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010" /&gt;

'''3. Ritualism''' refers to the inability to reach a cultural goal thus embracing the rules to the point where the people in question lose sight of their larger goals in order to feel respectable. Ritualists reject society's goals, but accept society's institutionalised means. Ritualists are most commonly found in dead-end, repetitive jobs, where they are unable to achieve society's goals but still adhere to society's means of achievement and social norms.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010" /&gt;

'''4. Retreatism''' is the rejection of both cultural goals and means, letting the person in question "drop out". Retreatists reject the society's goals and the legitimate means to achieve them. Merton sees them as true deviants, as they commit acts of deviance to achieve things that do not always go along with society's values.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010" /&gt;

'''5. Rebellion''' is somewhat similar to retreatism, because the people in question also reject both the cultural goals and means, but they go one step further to a "counterculture" that supports other social orders that already exist (rule breaking). Rebels reject society's goals and legitimate means to achieve them, and instead creates new goals and means to replace those of society, creating not only new goals to achieve but also new ways to achieve these goals that other rebels will find acceptable.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010" /&gt;

=== Symbolic interaction ===
{{Main|Symbolic interaction}}
'''Symbolic Interaction''',  refers to the patterns of communication, interpretation and adjustment between individuals. Both the verbal and nonverbal responses that a listener then delivers are similarly constructed in expectation of how the original speaker will react. The ongoing process is like the game of charades, only it’s a full-fledged conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A first look at communication theory. |last=Griffin |first=Em |year=2012 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-353430-5 |page=54 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "symbolic interactionism" has come into use as a label for a relatively distinctive approach to the study of human life and human conduct. (Blumer, 1969). With Symbolic interactionism, reality is seen as social, developed interaction with others. Most symbolic interactionists believe a physical reality does indeed exist by an individual's social definitions, and that social definitions do develop in part or relation to something “real.” People thus do not respond to this reality directly, but rather to the social understanding of reality. Humans therefore exist in three realities: a physical objective reality, a social reality, and a unique. A unique is described as a third reality created out of the social reality, a private interpretation of the reality that is shown to the person by others (Charon, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;Charon J.M. (2007). ''Symbolic Interactionism: An Introduction, An Interpretation, Integration''. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Perason Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Both individuals and society cannot be separated far from each other for two reasons. One, being that both are created through social interaction, and two, one cannot be understood in terms without the other. Behavior is not defined by forces from the environment such as drives, or instincts, but rather by a reflective, socially understood meaning of both the internal and external incentives that are currently presented (Meltzer et al., 1975).&lt;ref&gt;Meltzer B.N., Petras J.W. &amp; Reynolds L.T.(1975). ''Symbolic Interactionism: Genesis, Varieties, and Criticism''. Boston: Routledge and Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbert Blumer (1969) set out three basic premises of the perspective:

* "Humans act toward things on the basis of the meanings they ascribe to those things."
* "The meaning of such things is derived from, or arises out of, the social interaction that one has with others and the society."
* "These meanings are handled in, and modified through, an interpretative process used by the person in dealing with the things he/she encounters."

==== Sutherland's differential association ====
{{Main|Differential association}}
In his [[differential association]] theory, [[Edwin Sutherland]] posited that criminals learn criminal and deviant behaviors and that deviance is not inherently a part of a particular individual's nature. When an individual's significant others engage in deviant and/or criminal behavior, criminal behavior will be learned as a result to this exposure.&lt;ref name="Botterweck, Michael C 2011 p 152"&gt;Ed. Botterweck, Michael C. et al. (2011) "Everyday Sociology", p 152. Starpoint Press, Elmhurst, IL.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, he argues that criminal behavior is learned in the same way that all other behaviors are learned, meaning that the acquisition of criminal knowledge is not unique compared to the learning of other behaviors.

Sutherland outlined some very basic points in his theory, including the idea that the learning comes from the interactions between individuals and groups, using communication of symbols and ideas. When the symbols and ideas about deviation are much more favorable than unfavorable, the individual tends to take a favorable view upon deviance and will resort to more of these behaviors.

Criminal behavior (motivations and technical knowledge), as with any other sort of behavior, is learned. Some basic assumptions include:

* Learning in interaction using communication within intimate personal groups.
* Techniques, motives, drives, rationalizations, and attitudes are all learned.
* Excess of definitions favorable to deviation.
* Legitimate and illegitimate behaviors both express the same general needs and essential values.

One example of this would be gang activity in inner city communities.  Sutherland would feel that because a certain individual's primary influential peers are in a gang environment, it is through interaction with them that one may become involved in crime.&lt;ref name="Botterweck, Michael C 2011 p 152" /&gt;

==== Neutralization theory ====
{{main|Techniques of neutralization}}
[[Gresham Sykes]] and [[David Matza]]'s [[Techniques of neutralization|neutralization theory]] explains how deviants justify their deviant behaviors by providing alternative definitions of their actions and by providing explanations, to themselves and others, for the lack of guilt for actions in particular situations.

There are five types of neutralization:

* Denial of responsibility: the deviant believes s/he was helplessly propelled into the deviance, and that under the same circumstances, any other person would resort to similar actions
* Denial of injury: the deviant believes that the action caused no harm to other individuals or to the society, and thus the deviance is not morally wrong
* Denial of the victim: the deviant believes that individuals on the receiving end of the deviance were deserving of the results due to the victim's lack of virtue or morals
* Condemnation of the condemners: the deviant believes enforcement figures or victims have the tendency to be equally deviant or otherwise corrupt, and as a result, are hypocrites to stand against
* Appeal to higher loyalties: the deviant believes that there are loyalties and values that go beyond the confines of the law; morality, friendships, income, or traditions may be more important to the deviant than legal boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jim |last=Mitchell |first2=Richard A. |last2=Dodder |year=1983 |title=Types of Neutralization and Delinquency |journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=307–318 |doi=10.1007/BF02088729 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Labeling theory ====
{{Main|Labeling theory}}
[[Frank Tannenbaum]] and [[Howard S. Becker]] created and developed the labeling theory, which is a core facet of symbolic interactionism, and often referred to as Tannenbaum's "dramatization of evil".  Becker believed that "social groups create deviance by making the rules whose infraction constitutes deviance".

Labeling is a process of social reaction by the "social audience", (stereotyping) the people in society exposed to, judging and accordingly defining (labeling) someone's behavior as deviant or otherwise.  It has been characterized as the "invention, selection, manipulation of beliefs which define conduct in a negative way and the selection of people into these categories [....]"&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 2001: 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Labeling theory, consequently, suggests that deviance is caused by the deviant's being labeled as morally inferior, the deviant's internalizing the label and finally the deviant's acting according to that specific label (in other words, you label the "deviant" and they act accordingly).  As time goes by, the "deviant" takes on traits that constitute deviance by committing such deviations as conform to the label (so you as the audience have the power to not label them and you have the power to stop the deviance before it ever occurs by not labeling them).  Individual and societal preoccupation with the label, in other words, leads the deviant individual to follow a self-fulfilling prophecy of abidance to the ascribed label.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010" /&gt;

This theory, while very much [[symbolic interaction|symbolically interactionist]], also has elements of conflict theory, as the dominant group has the power to decide what is deviant and acceptable, and enjoys the power behind the labeling process.  An example of this is a prison system that labels people convicted of theft, and because of this they start to view themselves as by definition thieves, incapable of changing.  "From this point of view," as [[Howard S. Becker]] has written,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Deviance is ''not'' a quality of the act the person commits, but rather a consequence of the application by others of rules and sanctions to an "offender".  The deviant is one to whom the label has successfully been applied; deviant behavior is behavior that people so label.&lt;ref&gt;Howard S. Becker. ''Outsiders: Studies in the Sociology of Deviance''. (New York: The Free Press, 1963). {{ISBN|978-0-684-83635-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, "Behavior only becomes deviant or criminal if defined and interfered as such by specific people in [a] specific situation."&lt;ref&gt;Thomson 2004: 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important to note the salient fact that society is not always correct in its labeling, often falsely identifying and misrepresenting people as deviants, or attributing to them characteristics which they do not have.  In legal terms, people are often wrongly accused, yet many of them must live with the ensuant [[Social stigma|stigma]] (or conviction) for the rest of their lives.

On a similar note, society often employs double standards, with some sectors of society enjoying favouritism.  Certain behaviors in one group are seen to be perfectly acceptable, or can be easily overlooked, but in another are seen, by the same audiences, as abominable.

The medicalization of deviance, ''the transformation of moral and legal deviance into a medical condition'', is an important shift that has transformed the way society views deviance.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 pp. 204"&gt;{{cite book |last=Macionis |first=J. |last2=Gerber |first2=L. |year=2010 |title=Sociology |edition=7th Canadian |location=Toronto |publisher=Pearson |isbn=978-0-13-511927-3 |page=204 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The labelling theory helps to explain this shift, as behaviour that used to be judged morally are now being transformed into an objective clinical diagnosis. For example, people with drug addictions are considered "sick" instead of "bad".&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 pp. 204" /&gt;

==== Primary and secondary deviation ====
Edwin Lemert developed the idea of primary and secondary deviation as a way to explain the process of labeling. Primary deviance is any general deviance before the deviant is labeled as such in a particular way. Secondary deviance is any action that takes place after primary deviance as a reaction to the institutional identification of the person as a deviant.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010" /&gt;

When an actor commits a crime (primary deviance), however mild, the institution will bring social penalties down on the actor. However, punishment does not necessarily stop crime, so the actor might commit the same primary deviance again, bringing even harsher reactions from the institutions. At this point, the actor will start to resent the institution, while the institution brings harsher and harsher repression. Eventually, the whole community will stigmatize the actor as a deviant and the actor will not be able to tolerate this, but will ultimately accept his or her role as a criminal, and will commit criminal acts that fit the role of a criminal.

Primary And Secondary Deviation is what causes people to become harder criminals. Primary deviance is the time when the person is labeled deviant through confession or reporting. Secondary deviance is deviance before and after the primary deviance. Retrospective labeling happens when the deviant recognizes his acts as deviant prior to the primary deviance, while prospective labeling is when the deviant recognizes future acts as deviant.
The steps to becoming a criminal are:

# Primary deviation.
# Social penalties.
# Secondary deviation.
# Stronger penalties.
# Further deviation with resentment and hostility towards punishers.
# Community stigmatizes the deviant as a criminal. 
# Tolerance threshold passed.
# Strengthening of deviant conduct because of stigmatizing penalties.
# Acceptance as role of deviant or criminal actor.

==== Control theory ====
Control theory advances the proposition that weak bonds between the individual and society free people to deviate. By contrast, strong bonds make deviance costly.  This theory asks why people refrain from deviant or criminal behavior, instead of why people commit deviant or criminal behavior, according to [[Travis Hirschi]].  The control theory developed when norms emerge to deter deviant behavior.  Without this "control", deviant behavior would happen more often.  This leads to conformity and groups.  People will conform to a group when they believe they have more to gain from conformity than by deviance.  If a strong bond is achieved there will be less chance of deviance than if a weak bond has occurred.  Hirschi argued a person follows the norms because they have a bond to society.  The bond consists of four positively correlated factors: opportunity, attachment, belief, and involvement.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 pp. 204" /&gt; When any of these bonds are weakened or broken one is more likely to act in defiance. [[Michael R. Gottfredson|Michael Gottfredson]] and [[Travis Hirschi]] in 1990 founded their Self-Control Theory.  It stated that acts of force and fraud are undertaken in the pursuit of self-interest and self-control.  A deviant act is based on a criminals own self-control of themselves.

Containment theory is considered by researchers such as [[Walter Reckless|Walter C. Reckless]] to be part of the control theory because it also revolves around the thoughts that stop individuals from engaging in crime. Reckless studied the unfinished approaches meant to explain the reasoning behind delinquency and crime. He recognized that societal disorganization is included in the study of delinquency and crime under social deviance, leading him to claim that the majority of those who live in unstable areas tend not to have criminal tendencies in comparison those who live in middle-class areas. This claim opens up more possible approaches to social disorganization, and proves that the already implemented theories are in need or a deeper connection to further explore ideas of crime and delinquency. These observations brought Reckless to ask questions such as, "Why do some persons break through the tottering (social) controls and others do not? Why do rare cases in well-integrated society break through the lines of strong controls?" Reckless asserted that the intercommunication between self-control and social controls are partly responsible for the development of delinquent thoughts. Social disorganization was not related to a particular environment, but instead was involved in the deterioration of an individuals social controls. The containment theory is the idea that everyone possesses mental and social safeguards which protect the individual from committing acts of deviancy. Containment depends on the individuals ability to separate inner and outer controls for normative behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flexon|first1=Jamie L.|editor1-last=Cullen|editor1-first=Francis T.|editor2-last=Wilcoz|editor2-first=Pamela|title=Encyclopedia of Criminological Theory|date=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|isbn=9781412959186|pages=777–782|chapter=Reckless, Walter C.:Containment Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More contemporary control theorists such as [[Robert Crutchfield]] take the theory into a new light, suggesting labor market experiences not only affect the attitudes and the "stakes" of individual workers, but can also affect the development of their children's views toward conformity and cause involvement in delinquency.  This is an ongoing study as he has found a significant relationship between parental labor market involvement and children's delinquency, but has not empirically demonstrated the mediating role of parents' or children's attitude.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} In a study conducted by Tim Wadsworth, the relationship between parent's employment and children's delinquency, which was previously suggested by Crutchfield (1993), was shown empirically for the first time. The findings from this study supported the idea that the relationship between socioeconomic status and delinquency might be better understood if the quality of employment and its role as an informal social control is closely examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/sf/78.3.1041| title = Labor Markets, Delinquency, and Social Control Theory: An Empirical Assessment of the Mediating Process| journal = Social Forces| volume = 78| issue = 3| pages = 1041| year = 2000| last1 = Wadsworth | first1 = T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conflict theory ===
{{Main|Conflict theory}}
In sociology, conflict theory states that society or an organization functions so that each individual participant and its groups struggle to maximize their benefits, which inevitably contributes to social change such as political changes and revolutions. Deviant behaviors are actions that do not go along with the social institutions as what cause deviance. The institution's ability to change norms, wealth or status comes into conflict with the individual. The legal rights of poor folks might be ignored, middle class are also accept; they side with the elites rather than the poor, thinking they might rise to the top by supporting the status quo. Conflict theory is based upon the view that the fundamental causes of crime are the social and economic forces operating within society. However, it explains white-collar crime less well.

This theory also states that the powerful define crime. This raises the question: for whom is this theory functional? In this theory, laws are instruments of oppression: tough on the powerless and less tough on the powerful.

==== Karl Marx ====
[[Karl Marx|Marx]] did not write about deviant behavior but he wrote about [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] amongst the proletariat—as well as between the [[proletariat]] and the finished product—which causes conflict, and thus deviant behavior.

Many Marxist writers have the theory of the capitalist state in their arguments. For example, [[Steven Spitzer]] utilized the theory of bourgeois control over social junk and social dynamite; [[George Rusche]] was known to present analysis of different punishments correlated to the social capacity and infrastructure for labor. He theorized that throughout history, when more labor is needed, the severity of punishments decreases and the tolerance for deviant behavior increases. [[Jock Young]], another Marxist writer, presented the idea that the modern world did not approve of diversity, but was not afraid of social conflict. The late modern world, however, is very tolerant of diversity.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010" /&gt; But is extremely afraid of social conflicts, which is an explanation given for the political correctness movement. The late modern society easily accepts difference, but it labels those that it does not want as deviant and relentlessly punishes and persecutes.

==== Michel Foucault ====
[[Michel Foucault]] believed that [[torture]] had been phased out from modern society due to the dispersion of power; there was no need any more for the wrath of the state on a deviant individual. Rather, the [[Modernity#Sociologically|modern state]] receives praise for its fairness and dispersion of power which, instead of controlling each individual, controls the mass.

He also theorized that institutions control people through the use of [[discipline]].&lt;ref name="Steiner, Benjamin 2009"&gt;Steiner, Benjamin, and John Wooldredge."The relevance of inmate race/ethnicity versus population composition for understanding prison rule violations." ''[[Punishment &amp; Society]]'' 11(2009):459–489.&lt;/ref&gt;"Race and ethnicity could be relevant to an understanding of prison rule breaking if inmates bring their ecologically structured beliefs regarding legal authority, crime and deviance into the institutional environment."  For example, the modern prison (more specifically the [[panopticon]]) is a template for these institutions because it controls its inmates by the perfect use of discipline.

Foucault theorizes that, in a sense, the [[Post modern#History of term|postmodern society]] is characterized by the lack of [[free will]] on the part of individuals. Institutions of knowledge, norms, and values, are simply in place to categorize and control humans.

==== Biological theories of deviance ====
Praveen Attri claims genetic reasons to be largely responsible for social deviance. The Italian school of criminology contends that biological factors may contribute to crime and deviance. Cesare Lombroso was among the first to research and develop the Theory of Biological Deviance which states that some people are genetically predisposed to criminal behavior. He believed that criminals were a product of earlier genetic forms. The main influence of his research was Charles Darwin and his Theory of Evolution. Lombroso theorized that people were born criminals or in other words, less evolved humans who were biologically more related to our more primitive and animalistic urges. From his research, Lombroso took Darwin's Theory and looked at primitive times himself in regards to deviant behaviors.  He found that the skeletons that he studied mostly had low foreheads and protruding jaws.  These characteristics resembled primitive beings such as Homo Neanderthalensis. He stated that little could be done to cure born criminals because their characteristics were biologically inherited. Over time, most of his research was disproved. His research was refuted by Pearson and [[Charles Buckman Goring|Charles Goring]]. They discovered that Lombroso had not researched enough skeletons to make his research thorough enough.  When Pearson and Goring researched skeletons on their own they tested many more and found that the bone structure had no relevance in deviant behavior.  The statistical study that Charles Goring published on this research is called "The English Convict".

=== Other theories ===
The Classical school of criminology comes from the works of [[Cesare Beccaria]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]]. Beccaria assumed a [[utilitarian]] view of [[society]] along with a [[social contract]] theory of the [[State (polity)|state]]. He argued that the role of the state was to maximize the greatest possible utility to the maximum number of people and to minimize those actions that harm the society. He argued that deviants commit deviant acts (which are harmful to the society) because of the utility it gives to the private individual. If the state were to match the pain of punishments with the utility of various deviant behaviors, the deviant would no longer have any incentive to commit deviant acts. (Note that Beccaria argued for ''just'' punishment; as raising the severity of punishments without regard to logical measurement of utility would cause increasing degrees of social harm once it reached a certain point.)

== Cross-cultural communication ==
[[Cross-cultural communication]] is a field of study that looks at how people from different cultural backgrounds endeavor to communicate. All cultures make use of [[nonverbal communication]] but its meaning varies across cultures. In one particular country, a non-verbal sign may stand for one thing, and mean something else in another culture or country. The relation of cross-cultural communication with deviance is that a sign may be offensive to one in one culture and mean something completely appropriate in another. This is an important field of study because as educators, business employees, or any other form of career that consists of communicating with ones from other cultures, you need to understand non-verbal signs and their meanings, so you avoid offensive conversation or misleading conversation. Below is a list of non-verbal gestures that are appropriate in one country, and that would be considered deviant in another.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|
! [[Eye contact]]
! [[A-ok]] gesture

! [[The finger|Middle finger]]
! [[Thumbs signal|Thumbs up]]
! [[Whistling]]
|-
! Appropriate
| In the '''[[United States]]''' When saying hello or talking to someone it is impolite to not look directly at the person.
| In the '''[[United States]]''' the O.K. signal expresses approval
|  
| In the '''[[United States]]''' the thumbs up is used for hitchhiking, or approving of something
| In the '''[[United States]]''' whistling can express approval, as in cheering at a public event.
|-
! Inappropriate
| In '''[[East Asia]]n''' cultures, avoiding eye contact is considered polite.
| In '''[[Japan]]''' the O.K. signal means that you are asking for money.
| In the '''[[United States]]''' using your middle finger is very offensive. Used in place of swearing or deliberately offensive verbal language.
| The thumbs up is a rude gesture in '''[[Nigeria]]'''.
| In '''[[Europe]]''' whistling may be a sign of disapproval at public events.
|}
These are just a few non-verbal cross-cultural communication signs of which one should be aware. Cross-Cultural communication can make or break a business deal, or even prevent an educator from offending a student. Different cultures have different methods of communication, so it is important to understand the cultures of others.

Shaving of heads after death of a family member is more common in some African cultures.

Proponents of the theory of a [[Southern culture of honor]] hold that violent behavior which would be considered criminal in most of the United States, may be considered a justifiable response to insult in a Southern culture of honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John Shelton |last=Reed |title=One South: An Ethnic Approach To Regional Culture |location=Baton Rouge |publisher=Louisiana State University Press |year=1982 |isbn=0-8071-1003-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Taboo is a strong social form of behavior considered deviant by a majority. To speak of it publicly is condemned, and therefore, almost entirely avoided.  The term “taboo” comes from the Tongan word “[[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]]” meaning "under prohibition", "not allowed", or "forbidden". Some forms of taboo are prohibited under law and transgressions may lead to severe penalties. Other forms of taboo result in [[shame]], [[disrespect]] and [[humiliation]]. Taboo is not universal but does occur in the majority of societies. Some of the examples include [[murder]], [[rape]], [[incest]], or [[child molestation]].

[[Howard S. Becker|Howard Becker]], a labeling theorist, identified four different types of deviant behavior labels which are given as:

# "[[Falsely accusing]]" an individual - others perceive the individual to be obtaining obedient or deviant behaviors.
# "Pure deviance", others perceive the individual as participating in deviant and rule-breaking behavior.
# "[[Conforming]]", others perceive the individual to be participating in the social norms that are distributed within societies.
# "Secret deviance" which is when the individual is not perceived as deviant or participating in any rule-breaking behaviors.

== The criminal justice system ==
'''Police''': The police maintain public order by enforcing the law. Police use personal discretion in deciding whether and how to handle a situation. Research suggests that police are more likely to make an arrest if the offence is serious, if bystanders are present, or if the suspect is of a visible minority.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"/&gt;

'''Courts''': Courts rely on an adversarial process in which attorneys-one representing the defendant and one representing the Crown-present their cases in the presence of a judge who monitors legal procedures. In practice, courts resolve most cases through plea bargaining. Though efficient, this method puts less powerful people at a disadvantage.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"/&gt;

'''Punishment''': There are four jurisdictions for punishment: retribution, deterrence, rehabilitation, societal protection. Community-based corrections include probation and parole. These programs lower the cost of supervising people convicted of crimes and reduce [[prison overcrowding]] but have not been shown to reduce recidivism.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"/&gt;

== In literature and film ==
{{Multiple issues|section=yes|

Many works of literature offer [[allegories]] illustrating the conflict between character and society, in which the character does not conform to the society's norms and is subsequently alienated, ostracized, socially sanctioned, discriminated against or persecuted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25318">'''Dichotic listening''' or the '''Dichotic listening test''' is a psychological test commonly used to investigate [[selective attention]] within the [[auditory system]] and is a subtopic of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[neuroscience]]. Specifically, it is "used as a behavioral test for hemispheric lateralization of speech sound perception."&lt;ref name=Ingram2007&gt;{{cite book|last=Ingram|first=John C.L.|title=Neurolinguistics: an introduction to spoken language processing and its disorders|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-79640-8|edition=1. publ., 3. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|381}}  During a standard dichotic listening test, a participant is presented with two different auditory stimuli simultaneously (usually [[Speech communication|speech]]). The different stimuli are directed into different ears over headphones.&lt;ref name=Ingram2007/&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2016}} Participants are asked to pay attention to one or both of the stimuli. Later, they are asked about the content of either the message they were asked to attend to or the message that they were not told to listen to. As a result of focusing to repeat the words, participants noticed little of the message to the other ear, often not even realizing that at some point it changed from English to German. At the same time, participants did notice when the voice in the unattended ear changed from a male's to a female's, suggesting that the selectivity of consciousness can work to tune in some information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Schacter, GILBERT, WEGNER|first=Daniel|title=Psychology|year=2011|publisher=WorthPublishers|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-429-24107-6|pages=180|edition=1. publ., 3. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dichotic listening also relates to the third basic property of consciousness: [[Selective auditory attention|Selectivity]] which is the capacity to include some objects but not others.&lt;ref name="Schacter 2010"&gt;{{cite book |author=Schacter, Daniel L |title=Psychology |publisher=Worth Publishers |location=New York |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=1-4292-3719-8 |oclc= 696604625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the late 1960s and early 1970s Donald Shankweiler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haskins.yale.edu/staff/shankweiler.html |title=Donald P. Shankweiler}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michael Studdert-Kennedy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haskins.yale.edu/staff/msk.html |title=Michael Studdert-Kennedy }}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Haskins Laboratories]] used a dichotic listening technique (presenting different nonsense syllables) to demonstrate the dissociation of [[phonetic]] (speech) and [[sound|auditory]] (nonspeech) perception by finding that phonetic structure devoid of meaning is an integral part of language and is typically processed in the left [[cerebral hemisphere]].&lt;ref name=Studdert-Kennedy(a)&gt;
{{cite journal |last1=Studdert-Kennedy |first1=Michael |last2=Shankweiler |first2=Donald |date=19 August 1970 |title=Hemispheric specialization for speech perception |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=579–594 |doi=10.1121/1.1912174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Studdert-Kennedy(b)&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Studdert-Kennedy M. |author2=Shankweiler D. |author3=Schulman S. | year = 1970 | title = Opposed effects of a delayed channel on perception of dichotically and monotically presented CV syllables | url = | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 599–602 | doi=10.1121/1.1912179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Studdert-Kennedy(c)&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Studdert-Kennedy M. |author2=Shankweiler D. |author3=Pisoni D. | year = 1972 | title = Auditory and phonetic processes in speech perception: Evidence from a dichotic study | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Psychology | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 455–466 |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(72)90017-5 |pmc=3523680 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A dichotic listening performance advantage for one ear is interpreted as indicating a processing advantage in the contralateral [[cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]]. In another example, Sidtis (1981)&lt;ref name=Sidtis&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sidtis J. J. | year = 1981 | title = The complex tone test: Implications for the assessment of auditory laterality effects | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 103–112 | doi=10.1016/0028-3932(81)90050-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that healthy adults have a left-ear advantage on a dichotic pitch recognition experiment. He interpreted this result as indicating right-hemisphere dominance for pitch discrimination.

During the early 1970s, Tim Rand demonstrated dichotic perception at [[Haskins Laboratories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haskins.yale.edu/publications/pub-r.html |title=Rand, T. C. (1974) |work=Haskins Laboratories Publications-R |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rand&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rand |first=Timothy C. | year = 1974 | title = Dichotic release from masking for speech | url = | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 55 | issue = 3| pages = 678–680 | doi=10.1121/1.1914584 | pmid=4819869}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his study, the first stimuli: [[formant]] (F1), was presented to one ear while the second and third stimuli:(F2) and (F3) formants, were presented to the opposite ear. F2 and F3 varied in low and high intensity. Ultimately, in comparison to the binaural condition, "peripheral masking is avoided when speech is heard dichotically."&lt;ref name=Rand /&gt; This demonstration was originally known as "the Rand effect" but was later renamed "dichotic release from masking". The name for this demonstration continued to evolve and was finally named "dichotic perception" or "dichotic listening." Around the same time,  Jim Cutting (1976),&lt;ref name=Cutting&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cutting J. E. | year = 1976 | title = Auditory and linguistic processes in speech perception: inferences from six fusions in dichotic listening | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 83 | issue = | pages = 114–140 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.83.2.114}}&lt;/ref&gt; an investigator at [[Haskins Laboratories]], researched how listeners could correctly identify syllables when different components of the syllable were presented to different ears. The [[formant]]s of vowel sounds and their relation are crucial in differentiating vowel sounds. Even though the listeners heard two separate signals with neither ear receiving a 'complete' vowel sound, they could still identify the syllable sounds.

==Dichotic listening test designs==

===Dichotic fused words test (DFWT)===
The "dichotic fused words test" (DFWT) is a modified version of the basic dichotic listening test. It was originally explored by Johnson ''et al.'' (1977)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|title=Dichotic ear preference in aphasia|journal=J. Speech Hear Res|year=1977|volume=20|pages=116–129|doi=10.1044/jshr.2001.116|pmid=846195|issue=1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the early 80's Wexler and Hawles (1983)&lt;ref name="Wexler 1983"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wexler|first=Bruce|author2=Terry Hawles|title=Increasing the power of dichotic methods: the fused rhymed words test|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=1983|volume=21|doi=10.1016/0028-3932(83)90100-8|pmid=6843817|issue=1|pages=59–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; modified this original test to ascertain more accurate data pertaining to hemispheric specialization of language function. In the DFWT, each participant listens to pairs of monosyllabic rhyming consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) words. Each word varies in the initial consonant. The significant difference in this test is "the stimuli are constructed and aligned in such a way that partial interaural fusion occurs: subjects generally experience and report only one stimulus per trial."&lt;ref name="Zatorre 1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zatorre|first=Robert|title=Perceptual asymmetry on the dichotic fused words test and cerebral speech lateralization determined by the caroid sodium amytal test|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=1989|volume=27|issue=10|doi=10.1016/0028-3932(89)90033-x|pages=1207–1219|pmid=2480551}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Zatorre (1989), some major advantages of this method include "minimizing attentional factors, since the percept is unitary and localized to the midline" and "stimulus dominance effects may be explicitly calculated, and their influence on ear asymmetries assessed and eliminated."&lt;ref name="Zatorre 1989"/&gt; Wexler and Hawles study obtained a high test-retest reliability (r=0.85).&lt;ref name="Wexler 1983"/&gt; High test-retest reliability is good, because it proves that the data collected from the study is consistent.

===Testing with emotional factors===
An emotional version of the dichotic listening task was developed. In this version individuals listen to the same word in each ear but they hear it in either a surprised, happy, sad, angry, or neutral tone. Participants are then asked to press a button indicating what tone they heard. Usually dichotic listening tests show a right-ear advantage for speech sounds. Right-ear/left-hemisphere advantage is expected, because of evidence from [[Broca's area]] and [[Wernicke's area]], which are both located in the left hemisphere.  In contrast, the left ear (and therefore the right hemisphere) is often better at processing nonlinguistic material.&lt;ref  name="Grimshaw 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grimshaw|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=2003|volume=41|doi=10.1016/s0028-3932(02)00315-9 |display-authors=etal|title=The dynamic nature of language lateralization: effects of lexical and prosodic factors|pages=1008–1019|pmid=12667536}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data from the emotional dichotic listening task is consistent with the other studies, because participants tend to have more correct responses to their left ear than to the right.&lt;ref  name="Hahn 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hahn|first=Constanze|title=Smoking reduces language lateralization: A dichotic listening study with control participants and schizophrenia patients|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278262611000625|work=Journal|doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2011.03.015|volume=76|pages=300–309|pmid=21524559|date=Jul 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that the emotional dichotic listening task is seemingly harder for the participants than the phonemic dichotic listening task. Meaning more incorrect responses were submitted by individuals.

===Manipulation of voice onset time (VOT)===
The manipulation of voice onset time (VOT) during dichotic listening tests have given many insights regarding brain function.&lt;ref name="Arciuli 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arciuli J |title=Manipulation of voice onset time during dichotic listening |journal=Brain Cogn |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=233–8 |date=July 2011 |pmid=21320740 |doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2011.01.007 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the most common design is the utilisation of four VOT conditions: short-long pairs (SL), where a Consonant-Vowel (CV) syllable with a short VOT is presented to the left ear and a CV syllable with a long VOT is presented to the right ear, as well as long-short (LS), short-short (SS) and long-long (LL) pairs. In 2006, Rimol, Eichele, and Hugdahl&lt;ref name="Rimol 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rimol, L.M. |author2=Eichele, T. |author3=Hugdahl, K. |title=The effect of voice-onset-time on dichotic listening with consonant-vowel syllables|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=2006|volume=44 | issue = 2|pages=191–196|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2005.05.006|pmid=16023155}}&lt;/ref&gt; first reported that in healthy adults SL pairs elicit the largest REA while, in fact, LS pairs elicit a significant left ear advantage (LEA).

==Neuroscience==
Dichotic listening tests can also be used as lateralized speech assessment task. Neuropsychologists have used this test to explore the role of singular neuroanatomical structures in speech perception and language asymmetry. For example, Hugdahl ''et al.'' (2003), investigated dichotic listening performance and [[frontal lobe]] function&lt;ref name="Hugdahl 2003 58–65"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hugdahl|first=Kenneth|title=Dichotic Listening Performance and Frontal Lobe Function|journal=Thomas Bodner, Elisabeth Weiss, Thomas Benke|year=2003|volume=16|pages=58–65|doi=10.1016/s0926-6410(02)00210-0|pmid=12589889|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; in left and right lesioned frontal lobe nonaphasiac patients compared to healthy controls. In the study, all groups were exposed to 36 dichotic trials with pairs of CV syllables and each patient was asked to state which syllable he or she heard best. As expected, the right lesioned patients showed a right ear advantage like the healthy control group but the left hemisphere lesioned patients displayed impairment when compared to both the right lesioned patients and control group. From this study, researchers concluded "dichotic listening as into a neuronal circuitry which also involves the frontal lobes, and that this may be a critical aspect of speech perception."&lt;ref name="Hugdahl 2003 58–65"/&gt; Similarly, Westerhausen and Hugdahl (2008)&lt;ref name="Westerhausen 2008 1044–1054"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Westerhausen|first=Rene|author2=Kenneth Hugdahl|title=The corpus callosum in dichotic listening studies of hemispheric asymmetry: A review of clinical and experimental evidence|journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews|year=2008|volume=32|pages=1044–1054|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.04.005|pmid=18499255|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed the role of the [[corpus callosum]] in dichotic listening and speech perception. After reviewing many studies, it was concluded that "...dichotic listening should be considered a test of functional inter-hemispheric interaction and connectivity, besides being a test of lateralized temporal lobe language function" and "the corpus callosum is critically involved in the top-down attentional control of dichotic listening performance, thus having a critical role in auditory laterality."&lt;ref name="Westerhausen 2008 1044–1054"/&gt;

==Language processing==

Dichotic listening can also be used to test the [[lateralization of brain function|hemispheric asymmetry]] of [[language processing]]. In the early 60s, Doreen Kimura reported that dichotic verbal stimuli (specifically spoken numerals) presented to a participant produced a right ear advantage (REA).&lt;ref name="Kimura 1961"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kimura D | year = 1961 | title = Cerebral dominance and the perception of verbal stimuli | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 166–171 | doi=10.1037/h0083219}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attributed the right-ear advantage "to the localization of speech and language processing in the so-called dominant left hemisphere of the cerebral cortex."&lt;ref name=Ingram2007/&gt;{{rp|115}}  According to her study, this phenomenon was related to the structure of the auditory nerves and the left-sided dominance for language processing.&lt;ref name="Kimura 1967"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kimura D | year = 1967 | title = Functional asymmetry of the brain in dichotic listening | url = | journal = Cortex | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 163–178 | doi=10.1016/s0010-9452(67)80010-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that REA doesn't apply to non-speech sounds. In "Hemispheric Specialization for Speech Perception," by Studdert-Kennedy and Shankweiler (1970)&lt;ref name=Studdert-Kennedy(a)/&gt; examine dichotic listening of CVC syllable pairs. The six stop consonants (b, d, g, p, t, k) are paired with the six vowels and a variation in the initial and final consonants are analyzed. REA is the strongest when the sound of the initial and final consonants differ and it is the weakest when solely the vowel is changed. Asbjornsen and Bryden (1996) state that "many researchers have chosen to use CV syllable pairs, usually consisting of the six stop consonants paired with the vowel \a\. Over the years, a large amount of data has been generated using such material."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asbjornsen|first=Arve|author2=M.P. Bryden|title=Biased attention and the fused dichotic words test|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=1996|volume=34|issue=5|pages=407–11|doi=10.1016/0028-3932(95)00127-1|pmid=9148197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selective attention==
In selective attention experiments, the participants may be asked to repeat aloud the content of the message they are listening to. This task is known as [[Speech shadowing|shadowing]]. As [[Colin Cherry]] (1953)&lt;ref name=Cherry&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cherry E. C. | year = 1953 | title = Some experiments on the recognition of speech, with one and two ears | url = | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 975–979 | doi=10.1121/1.1907229}}&lt;/ref&gt; found, people do not recall the shadowed message well, suggesting that most of the processing necessary to shadow the attended to message occurs in [[working memory]] and is not preserved in the [[long-term memory|long-term store]]. Performance on the unattended message is worse. Participants are generally able to report almost nothing about the content of the unattended message. In fact, a change from [[English language|English]] to [[German language|German]] in the unattended channel frequently goes unnoticed. However, participants are able to report that the unattended message is speech rather than non-verbal content. In addition to this, if the content of the unattended message contains certain information, such as the listener's name, then the unattended message is more likely to be noticed and remembered.&lt;ref name="Moray 1959"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Moray N | year = 1959 | title = Attention in dichotic listening: Affective cues and the influence of instructions | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 56–60 | doi=10.1080/17470215908416289}}&lt;/ref&gt; A demonstration of this was done by Conway, Cowen, and Bunting (2001) in which they had subjects shadow words in one ear while ignoring words in the other ear.  At some point, the subject's name was spoken in the ignored ear, and the question was whether the subject would report hearing their name.  Subjects with a high working memory (WM) span were more capable of blocking out the distracting information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Engle Randall W | year = 2002 | title = Working Memory Capacity as Executive Attention | doi = 10.1111/1467-8721.00160 | volume=11 | journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science | pages=19–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also if the message contains sexual words then people usually notice them immediately.&lt;ref name="Nielsen Sarason 1981"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nielson L. L. |author2=Sarason I. G. | year = 1981 | title = Emotion, personality, and selective attention | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 945–960 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.41.5.945 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the unattended information is also undergoing analysis and keywords can divert attention to it.

==Sex differences==
Some data gathered from dichotic listening test experiments suggests that there is possibly a small-population sex difference in perceptual and auditory asymmetries and language laterality. According to Voyer (2011),&lt;ref name="Voyer 2011 245–255"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Voyer|first=Daniel|title=Sex differences in dichotic listening|journal=Brain and Cognition|year=2011|volume=76|pages=245–255|doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2011.02.001|pmid=21354684|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Dichotic listening tasks produced homogenous effect sizes regardless of task type (verbal, non-verbal), reflecting a significant sex difference in the magnitude of laterality effects, with men obtaining larger laterality effects than women."&lt;ref name="Voyer 2011 245–255"/&gt;{{rp|245–246}} However, the authors discuss numerous limiting factors ranging from publication bias to small effect size. Furthermore, as discussed in "Attention, reliability, and validity of perceptual asymmetries in the fused dichotic words test,"&lt;ref name="Voyer 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Voyer|first=Daniel|author2=Jennifer Ingram|title=Attention, reliability, and validity of perceptual asymmetries in the fused dichotic word test|journal=Laterality: Asymmetries of Body, Brain, and Cognition|year=2005|volume=6|pages=545–561|doi=10.1080/13576500442000292}}&lt;/ref&gt; women reported more "intrusions" or words presented to the uncued ear than men when presented with exogenous cues in the Fused Dichotic Word Task which suggests two possibilities: 1) Women experience more difficulty paying attention to the cued word than men and/or 2) regardless of the cue, women spread their attention evenly as opposed to men who may possibly focus in more intently on exogenous cues.&lt;ref name="Voyer 2011 245–255"/&gt;

==Effect of schizophrenia==
A study conducted involving the dichotic listening test, with emphasis on subtypes of schizophrenia (particularly paranoid and undifferentiated), demonstrated that [[Paranoid schizophrenia|paranoid schizophrenics]] have the largest left hemisphere advantage – with undifferentiated schizophrenics (where psychotic symptoms are present but the criteria for paranoid, disorganized, or catatonic types have not been met) having the smallest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Michelle S. |last1=Friedman |first2=Gerard E. |last2=Bruder |first3=Paul G. |last3=Nestor |first4=Barbara K. |last4=Stuart |first5=Xavier F. |last5=Amador |first6=Jack M. |last6=Gorman |date=September 2001 |title=Perceptual Asymmetries in Schizophrenia: Subtype Differences in Left Hemisphere Dominance for Dichotic Fused Words |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=158 |issue=9 |pages=1437–1440 |url=http://psychophysiology.cpmc.columbia.edu/pdf/friedman2001a.pdf |format=PDF |pmid=11532728 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.158.9.1437 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of the dichotic listening test helped to further the beliefs that preserved left hemisphere processing is a product of paranoid schizophrenia, and in contrast, that the left hemisphere's lack of activity is a symptom of undifferentiated schizophrenia. In 1994, M.F. Green and colleagues tried to relate "the functional integration of the left hemisphere in hallucinating and nonhallucinating psychotic patients" using a dichotic listening study. The study showed that auditory hallucinations are connected to a malfunction in the left hemisphere of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Green |first1=MF |last2=Hugdahl |first2=K |last3=Mitchell |first3=S |date=March 1994 |title=Dichotic listening during auditory hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=151 |issue=3 |pages=357–362 |pmid=8109643 |doi=10.1176/ajp.151.3.357 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/ajp.151.3.357 |subscription=yes |via=PsychiatryOnline }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title}}
'''{{lang|fr|Différance}}''' is a [[French language|French]] term coined by [[Jacques Derrida]]. It is a central concept in Derrida's [[deconstruction]], a [[Literary critical theory|critical]] outlook concerned with the relationship between text and meaning. The term {{lang|fr|différance}} means "difference and deferral of meaning."

==Overview==
Derrida first uses the term {{lang|fr|différance}} in his 1963 paper "{{lang|fr|Cogito et histoire de la folie|italic=no}}".&lt;ref&gt;"The economy of this writing is a regulated relationship between that which exceeds and the exceeded totality: the {{lang|fr|différance|italic=no}} of the absolute excess." (Derrida, J., 1978. Cogito and the History of Madness. From ''[[Writing and Difference]]''. Trans. A. Bass. London &amp; New York: Routledge. p. 75.) Schultz and Fried in their vast bibliography of Derrida's work cite this sentence as where "JD introduces {{lang|fr|différance|italic=no}}" for the first time. (Schultz, W.R. &amp; Fried, L.B., 1992. ''Jacques Derrida Bibliography''. London &amp; New York: Garland. p. 12.)&lt;/ref&gt; The term {{lang|fr|différance}} then played a key role in Derrida's engagement with the philosophy of [[Edmund Husserl]] in ''[[Speech and Phenomena]]''. The term was then elaborated in various other works, notably in his essay "{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}}" and in various interviews collected in ''Positions''.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Speech and Phenomena and other essays on Husserl's Theory of Signs'', trans. David B. Allison (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1973),  "{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}}". ''Margins of Philosophy'', trans. Alan Bass (Chicago &amp; London: Chicago University Press, 1982) and ''Positions'', trans. Alan Bass (Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{angbr|a}} of {{lang|fr|différance}} is a deliberate misspelling of {{lang|fr|différence}}, though the two are pronounced identically, {{IPA-fr|difeʁɑ̃s|IPA}} ({{lang|fr|différance}} plays on the fact that the French word {{lang|fr|[[wikt:différer|différer]]}} means both "to defer" and "to differ"). This misspelling highlights the fact that its written form is not heard, and serves to further subvert the traditional privileging of speech over writing (see [[archi-writing]] and [[logocentrism]]), as well as the distinction between the sensible and the intelligible.  The difference articulated by the {{angbr|a}} in {{lang|fr|différance}} is not apparent to the senses via sound, "but neither cannot it belong to intelligibility, to the ideality which is not fortuitously associated with the objectivity of ''theorein'' or understanding."&lt;ref&gt;"{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}}", ''Margins of Philosophy'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is because the language of understanding is already caught up in sensible metaphors—for example, {{lang|grc|θεωρεῖν}} ({{transl|grc|theōrein}}) means "to see" in [[Ancient Greek]].

In the essay "{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}}" Derrida indicates that {{lang|fr|différance}} gestures at a number of heterogeneous features that govern the production of textual meaning. The first (relating to deferral) is the notion that words and signs can never fully summon forth what they mean, but can only be defined through appeal to additional words, from which they differ. Thus, meaning is forever "deferred" or postponed through an endless chain of signifiers. The second (relating to [[Difference (poststructuralism)|difference]], sometimes referred to as ''espacement'' or "spacing") concerns the force that differentiates elements from one another, and in so doing engenders binary oppositions and hierarchies that underpin meaning itself.

Derrida developed the concept of {{lang|fr|différance}} deeper in the course of an argument against the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]], who sought a rigorous analysis of the role of [[memory]] and [[perception]] in our understanding of sequential items such as [[music]] or [[language]].  Derrida's approach argues that because the perceiver's mental state is constantly in [[flux]] and differs from one [[Reading (process)|re-reading]] to the next, a general theory describing this phenomenon is unachievable.

A term related to the idea of {{lang|fr|différance}} in Derrida's thought is the ''supplement'', "itself bound up in a supplementary play of meaning which defies semantic reduction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norris|first1=Christopher|title=Deconstruction : theory and practice|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415280105|page=32|edition=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Between structure and genesis ==

Derrida approaches texts as constructed around elemental oppositions which all speech has to articulate if it intends to make any sense whatsoever. This is so because identity is viewed in [[Non-essentialism|non-essentialist]] terms as a construct, and because constructs only produce meaning through the interplay of [[Difference (poststructuralism)|differences]] inside a "system of distinct signs". This approach to text, in a broad sense,&lt;ref name="Royle04p62"&gt;[[Nicholas Royle|Royle, Nicholas]] (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=nNaSdb9VMTwC ''Jacques Derrida''], pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferraris97p76"&gt;Derrida and Ferraris (1997) p.76
{{quote|I take great interest in questions of language and rhetoric, and I think they deserve enormous consideration; but there is a point where the authority of final jurisdiction is neither rhetorical nor linguistic, nor even discursive. The notion of trace or of text is introduced to mark the limits of the linguistic turn. This is one more reason why I prefer to speak of 'mark' rather than of language. In the first place the mark is not anthropological; it is prelinguistic; it is the possibility of language, and it is every where there is a relation to another thing or relation to an other. For such relations, the mark has no need of language.}}&lt;/ref&gt; emerges from [[semiology]] advanced by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]].

Saussure is considered one of the fathers of [[structuralism]] when he explained that terms get their meaning in reciprocal determination with other terms inside language:
{{quote|In language there are only differences. Even more important: a difference generally implies positive terms between which the difference is set up; but in language there are only differences without positive terms. Whether we take the signified or the signifier, language has neither ideas nor sounds that existed before the linguistic system, but only conceptual and phonic differences that have issued from the system. The idea or phonic substance that a sign contains is of less importance than the other signs that surround it. ... A linguistic system is a series of differences of sound combined with a series of differences of ideas; but the pairing of a certain number of acoustical signs with as many cuts made from the mass thought engenders a system of values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saussure|first=Ferdinand de|title=Course in General Linguistics|year=1916 [trans. 1959]|publisher=New York Philosophical Library|location=New York|pages=121–22|url=http://faculty.smu.edu/dfoster/cf3324/saussure.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Saussure explicitly suggested linguistics was only a branch of a more general semiology, of a science of signs in general, being human codes only one among others. Nevertheless, in the end, as Derrida pointed out, he made of linguistics "the regulatory model", and "for essential, and essentially metaphysical, reasons had to privilege speech, and everything that links the sign to phone":&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jacques Derrida, "Interview with Julia Kristeva" in "Positions" (The University of Chicago Press, 1981), pp. 21
{{quote|Although Saussure recognized the necessity of putting the phonic substance between brackets ("What is essential in language, we shall see, is foreign to the phonic character of the linguistic sign" [p. 21]. "In its essence it [the linguistic signifier] is not at all phonic" [p. 164]), Saussure, for essential, and essentially metaphysical, reasons had to privilege speech, everything that links the sign to phone. He also speaks of the "natural link" between thought and voice, meaning and sound (p. 46). He even speaks of "thought-sound" (p. 156). I have attempted elsewhere to show what is traditional in such a gesture, and to what necessities it submits. In any event, it winds up contradicting the most interesting critical motive of the Course, making of linguistics the regulatory model, the "pattern" for a general semiology of which it was to be, by all rights and theoretically, only a part. The theme of the arbitrary, thus, is turned away from its most fruitful paths (formalization) toward a hierarchizing teleology: "Thus it can be said that entirely arbitrary signs realize better than any others the ideal of the semiological process; this is why language, the most complex and most widespread of the systems of expression, is also the most characteristic one of them all; in this sense linguistics can become the general pattern for all semiology, even though language is only a particular system" (p. 101). One finds exactly the same gesture and the same concepts in Hegel. The contradiction between these two moments of the Course is also marked by Saussure's recognizing elsewhere that "it is not spoken language that is natural to man, but the faculty of constituting a language, that is, a system of distinct signs ... ," that is, the possibility of the code and of articulation, independent of any substance, for example, phonic substance.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida will prefer to follow the more "fruitful paths (formalization)" of a general semiotics without falling in what he considered "a hierarchizing teleology" privileging linguistics, and speak of 'mark' rather than of language, not as something restricted to mankind, but as prelinguistic, as the pure possibility of language, working every where there is a relation to something else.

Derrida sees these differences as elemental oppositions working in all languages, systems of distinct signs, and codes, where terms don't have absolute meanings but instead draw meaning from reciprocal determination with other terms. This structural difference is the first component that Derrida will take into account when articulating the meaning of {{lang|fr|différance}}, a mark he felt the need to create and will become a fundamental tool in his lifelong work: [[deconstruction]]:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jacques Derrida, "Interview with Julia Kristeva" in "Positions" (The University of Chicago Press, 1981), pp. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|1) {{lang|fr|Différance}} is the systematic play of differences, of the traces of differences, of the spacing by means of which elements are related to each other. This spacing is the simultaneously active and passive (the ''a'' of {{lang|fr|différance}} indicates this indecision as concerns activity and passivity, that which cannot be governed by or distributed between the terms of this opposition) production of the intervals without which the "full" terms would not signify, would not function. }}

But structural difference will not be considered without him already destabilizing from the start its static, [[Synchronic analysis|synchronic]], [[Systematics – study of multi-term systems|taxonomic]], ahistoric motifs, remembering that all [[structure]] already refers to the [[Generative systems|generative]] movement in the play of differences:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jacques Derrida, "Interview with Julia Kristeva" in "Positions" (The University of Chicago Press, 1981), pp. 28–30
{{quote|multiline=y|It is also the becoming-space of the spoken chain—which has been called temporal or linear; a becoming-space which makes possible both writing and every correspondence between speech and writing, every passage from one to the other.

The activity or productivity connoted by the ''a'' of {{lang|fr|différance}} refers to the generative movement in the play of differences. The latter are neither fallen from the sky nor inscribed once and for all in a closed system, a static structure that a synchronic and taxonomic operation could exhaust. Differences are the effects of transformations, and from this vantage the theme of {{lang|fr|différance}} is incompatible with the static, synchronic, taxonomic, ahistoric motifs in the concept of structure.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other main component of {{lang|fr|différance}} is [[Deferral|deferring]], which takes into account the fact that meaning is not only synchrony with all the other terms inside a structure, but also [[Synchronic analysis|diachrony]], with everything that ''was'' and ''will be'' said, in History, difference as structure and deferring as genesis:&lt;ref name="Jacques Derrida 1981 pp. 28–30"&gt;Cf. Jacques Derrida, "Interview with Julia Kristeva" in "Positions" (The University of Chicago Press, 1981), pp. 28–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burke |first=Patrick |editor-last=Dillon |editor-first=M.

|quote=Derrida says that {{lang|fr|différance}} is removed from every possible mode of presence, like the unconscious of Freud, the force in Nietzsche, the Other in Levinas. So the question of {{lang|fr|différance}} must yield to the {{lang|fr|différance}} of the question and thus can never be asked, is forever absent. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|2) "the ''a'' of {{lang|fr|différance}} also recalls that spacing is temporization, the detour and postponement by means of which intuition, perception, consummation—in a word, the relationship to the present, the reference to a present reality, to a being—are always deferred. Deferred by virtue of the very principle of difference which holds that an element functions and signifies, takes on or conveys meaning, only by referring to another past or future element in an economy of traces. This economic aspect of {{lang|fr|différance}}, which brings into play a certain not conscious calculation in a field of forces, is inseparable from the more narrowly semiotic aspect of différance.}}

This confirms the subject as not present to itself and constituted on becoming space, in temporizing and also, as Saussure said, that "language [which consists only of differences] is not a function of the speaking subject":&lt;ref name="Jacques Derrida 1981 pp. 28–30"/&gt;
{{quote|It confirms that the subject, and first of all the conscious and speaking subject, depends upon the system of differences and the movement of différance, that the subject is not present, nor above all present to itself before différance, that the subject is constituted only in being divided from itself, in becoming space, in temporizing, in deferral; and it confirms that, as Saussure said, "language [which consists only of differences] is not a function of the speaking subject." }}

Questioned this myth of the presence of meaning in itself ("objective") and/or for itself ("subjective") Derrida will start a long deconstruction of all texts where conceptual oppositions are put to work in the actual construction of meaning and values based on the subordination of the movement of "{{lang|fr|différance}}":&lt;ref name="Jacques Derrida 1981 pp. 28–30"/&gt;
{{quote|At the point at which the concept of {{lang|fr|différance}}, and the chain attached to it, intervenes, all the conceptual oppositions of metaphysics (signifier/signified; sensible/intelligible; writing/speech; passivity/activity; etc.)—to the extent that they ultimately refer to the presence of something present (for example, in the form of the identity of the subject who is present for all his operations, present beneath every accident or event, self-present in its "living speech," in its enunciations, in the present objects and acts of its language, etc.)- become non pertinent. They all amount, at one moment or another, to a subordination of the movement of {{lang|fr|différance}} in favor of the presence of a value or a meaning supposedly antecedent to {{lang|fr|différance}}, more original than it, exceeding and governing it in the last analysis. This is still the presence of what we called above the "transcendental signified."}}

But, as Derrida also points out, these relations with other terms express not only meaning but also values. The way elemental oppositions are put to work in all texts it is not only a theoretical operation but also a practical option.
The first task of deconstruction, starting with philosophy and  afterwards revealing it operating in literary texts, juridical texts, etc., would be to overturn these oppositions:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jacques Derrida, "Interview with Jean-Louis Houdebine and Guy Scarpetta," in "Positions" (The University of Chicago Press, 1981), pp. 42–44&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|multiline=y|On the one hand, we must traverse a phase of overturning. To do justice to this necessity is to recognize that in a classical philosophical opposition we are not dealing with the peaceful coexistence of a vis-a-vis, but rather with a violent hierarchy. One of the two terms governs the other (axiologically, logically, etc.), or has the upper hand. 

To deconstruct the opposition, first of all, is to overturn the hierarchy at a given moment. To overlook this phase of overturning is to forget the conflictual and subordinating structure of opposition.}}

It is not that the final task of deconstruction is to surpass all oppositions, because they are structurally necessary to produce sense. They simply cannot be suspended once and for all. But this does not obviate their need to be analyzed and criticized in all its manifestations, showing the way these oppositions, logical and axiological, are at work in all discourse for it to be able to produce meaning and values.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jacques Derrida, "Interview with Jean-Louis Houdebine and Guy Scarpetta," in "Positions" (The University of Chicago Press, 1981), p. 42

{{quote|When I say that this phase is necessary, the word phase is perhaps not the most rigorous one. It is not a question of a chronological phase, a given moment, or a page that one day simply will be turned, in order to go on to other things. The necessity of this phase is structural; it is the necessity of an interminable analysis: the hierarchy of dual oppositions always reestablishes itself. Unlike those authors whose death does not await their demise, the time for overturning is never a dead letter.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Illustration ===
For example, the word "house" derives its meaning more as a function of how it differs from "shed", "mansion", "hotel", "building", etc. (Form of Content, which [[Louis Hjelmslev]] distinguished from Form of Expression) than how the word "house" may be tied to a certain image of a traditional house (i.e. the relationship between signifier and signified) with each term being established in reciprocal determination with the other terms than by an ostensive description or definition.

When can we talk about a "house" or a "mansion" or a "shed"? The same can be said about verbs, in all the world languages: when should we stop saying "walk" and start saying "run"? The same happens, of course, with adjectives: when must we stop saying "yellow" and start saying "orange", or stop defining as "black" and start saying "white", or "rich" and "poor", "entrepreneur" and "worker", "civilized" and "primitive", "man" and "animal", "beast" and "sovereign", "christian" and "pagan", or "beautiful" and start saying "ugly", or "bad" and start saying "good", or "truth" and start saying "false", "determined" and "free"? Or "in" and "out", "here" and "there", "now" and "then", "past" and "present" and "future" and "eternal"? Not only are the topological differences between the words relevant here, but the differentials between what is signified is also covered by différance. Deferral also comes into play, as the words that occur following "house" or "white" in any expression will revise the meaning of that word, sometimes dramatically so. This is true not only with syntagmatic succession in relation with paradigmatic simultaneity, but also, in a broader sense, between diachronic succession in History related with synchronic simultaneity inside a "system of distinct signs".

Thus, complete meaning is always "differential" and postponed in language; there is never a moment when meaning is complete and total. A simple example would consist of looking up a given word in a dictionary, then proceeding to look up the words found in that word's definition, etc., also comparing with older dictionaries from different periods in time, and such a process would never end.

This is also true with all ontological oppositions and its many [[declension]]s, not only in philosophy as in human sciences in general, cultural studies, theory of Law, et cetera. For example: the intelligible and the sensible, the spontaneous and the receptive, autonomy and heteronomy, the empirical and the transcendental, immanent and transcendent, as the interior and exterior, or the founded and the founder, normal and abnormal, phonetic and writing, analysis and synthesis, the literal sense and figurative meaning in language, reason and madness in psychoanalysis, the masculine and feminine in gender theory, man and animal in ecology, the beast and the sovereign in the political field, theory and practice as distinct dominions of thought itself. In all speeches in fact (and by right) we can make clear how they were dramatized, how the cleavages were made during the centuries, each author giving it different centers and establishing different hierarchies between the terms in the opposition.

=== Paradox ===
It may seem contradictory to suggest that {{lang|fr|différance}} is neither a word nor a concept.  The difference itself between words cannot only be another word. If that is the case then {{lang|fr|différance}} appeals to ontology, creating an even bigger problem. So {{lang|fr|différance}} is either an appeal to an infinite mystery (similar to God in theology) or becomes empty of any and all meaning and is thus rendered superfluous.

== The web of language ==
We reside, according to this philosophy, in a web of language, or at least one of interpretation, that has been laid down by tradition and which shifts each time we hear or read an utterance—even if it is the same utterance.  {{lang|fr|Différance}} and [[deconstruction]] are attempts to understand this web of language, to search, in Derrida's words, for the "other of language".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Kearney, Dialogues with Contemporary Thinkers, Manchester: MUP, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;  This "other of language" is close to what [[Anglophone Philosophy]] calls the [[Sense and reference|Reference]] of a word.  There is a ''deferment'' of meaning with each act of re-reading. There is a ''difference'' of readings with each re-reading.  In Derrida's words,  "there is nothing outside the [con]text" of a word's use and its place in the lexicon.  Text, in Derrida's parlance, refers to context and includes all about the "real-life" situation of the speech/text (cf. [[speech act]] theory).

=== Temporal delay ===
For Derrida, the relationship between the Signifier and the Signified is not understood to be exactly like Saussure's. For Derrida, there was a deferral, a continual and indefinite postponement as the Signified can never be achieved. The formation of the linguistic sign is marked by movement, and is not static. The easiest way to understand this is to imagine Saussure's model as a two dimensional plane, where each signified is separated due to the difference in its sound image. (If two sound-images are exactly alike, one could not distinguish between the two.) Each signifier then would be a particular point. Derrida adds a third dimension, time. Now, the act of formation is accounted for. This is not to say that there is no relationship between the two. However, Derrida felt that the old model focused too heavily on the signifier, rather than on utterance and occurrence. The Signifier and the Signified are severed completely and irrevocably.

=== Example of word introduction ===
An example of this effect occurred in England during the Renaissance, when oranges began to be imported from the Mediterranean.  Yellow and red came to be differentiated from a new colour term, "orange".  What was the meaning of these words before 1600? – What is their meaning afterwards?  Such effects go on often in the use of language and frequently this effect forms the basis of language/meaning.  Such changes of meaning are also often centres of political violence, as is apparent in the differences invested in male/female, master/slave, citizen/foreigner etc.  Derrida seeks to modulate and question these "violent hierarchies" through [[deconstruction]].

Perhaps it is a misconception that {{lang|fr|différance}} seeks contradictory meanings. It does not necessarily do so. It can, but what it usually describes is the re-experience, the re-arrival of the moment of reading. [[Roland Barthes]] remarked that "those who fail to reread are obliged to read the same story everywhere".&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, Roland. ''S/Z''. Trans. by Richard Miller. New York: Hill and Wang, 1974, pp. 15–6.&lt;/ref&gt; This wry comment summarizes the phenomenon of different experience for each iteration.

We are discussing just one text—every text. No distinction is necessarily made between texts in this "basic" level.  The difference/deferral can be between one text and itself, or between two texts; this is the crucial distinction between traditional perspectives and [[deconstruction]].

==Deconstruction and the history of philosophy==
Derrida's neographism (rather than [[neologism]] because "neologism" would propose a ''logos'', a metaphysical category; and (more simply) because, when uttered in French, "{{lang|fr|différance|italic=no}}" is indistinguishable from "difference"—it is thus only a graphical modification, having nothing to do with a spoken ''logos'') is, of course, not just an attempt at linguistics or to discuss written texts and how they are read.  It is, most importantly, an attempt to escape the history of [[metaphysics of presence|metaphysics]]; a history that has always prioritised certain concepts, e.g., those of substance, essence, soul, spirit (idealism), matter (realism), becoming, freedom, [[Empirical evidence|sense-experience]], language, science etc.  All such ideas imply self-presence and totality.  Différance, instead, focuses on the play of presence and absence, and, in effecting a concentration of certain thinking, Derrida takes on board the thought of [[Freud]]'s unconscious (the trace), [[Heidegger]]'s destruction of [[ontotheology]], [[Nietzsche]]'s play of forces, and [[Georges Bataille|Bataille]]'s notion of [[sacrifice]] in contrast to Hegel's {{lang|de|[[Aufheben]]}}.

{{quote|{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}} is not only irreducible to any ontological or theological—ontotheological—reappropriation, but as the very opening of the space in which [[ontotheology]]—philosophy—produces its system and its history, it includes ontotheology, inscribing it and exceeding it without return.&lt;ref&gt;"{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}}", ''Margins of Philosophy'', p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Yet he does not approach this absence and loss with the nostalgia that marks Heidegger's attempt to uncover some original truths beneath the accretions of a false metaphysics that have accumulated since Socrates.  Rather it is with the moods of play and affirmation that Derrida approaches the issue.

However, Derrida himself never claimed to have escaped from the metaphysics with what he has done. To the contrary, he criticises others for claiming to have demolished metaphysics thoroughly.

=== Negative theology ===
{{see also|Deconstruction and religion}}
Derrida's non-concept of différance, resembles, but is not, [[negative theology]], an attempt to present a tacit metaphysics without pointing to any existent essence as the [[first cause]] or transcendental signified.  Following his presentation of his paper "{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}}" in 1968, Derrida was faced with an annoyed participant who said, "It [différance] is the source of everything and one cannot know it: it is the God of negative theology." Derrida's answer was, "It is and it is not."&lt;ref name=Caputo&gt;Caputo, John. The Prayers and Tears of Jacques Derrida. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1997, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to negative theology, which posits something supereminent and yet concealed and ineffable, {{lang|fr|différance}} is not quite transcendental, never quite "real", as it is always and already deferred from being made present.  As [[John Caputo]] writes, "{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}} is but a quasi-transcendental anteriority, not a supereminent, transcendental ulteriority."&lt;ref&gt;Caputo, ''Prayers and Tears'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The differences and deferrings of différance, Derrida points out, are not merely ideal, they are not inscribed in the contours of the brain nor do they fall from the sky, the closest approximation would be to consider them as historical, that is, if the word history itself did not mean what it does, the airbrushing speech of the victor/vanquished.

Derrida has shown an interest in negative or [[apophasis|apophatic]] theology, one of his most important works on the topic being his essay "Sauf le nom".&lt;ref name=Sauf&gt;Derrida, Jacques. "{{lang|fr|Sauf le nom|italic=no}}". On the Name. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and technics ==
In ''[[Of Grammatology]]'', Derrida states that grammatology is not a "science of man" because it is concerned with the question of "the name of man." This leads Derrida into a consideration of the work of [[André Leroi-Gourhan]], and in particular his concepts of "program," "exteriorisation," and "liberation of memory." Derrida writes: "Leroi-Gourhan no longer describes the unity of man and the human adventure thus by the simple possibility of the {{lang|fr|graphie}} in general; rather as a stage or an articulation in the history of life—of what I have called différance—as the history of the {{lang|fr|grammè}}."&lt;ref name=Grammatology&gt;Derrida, Jacques. ''Of Grammatology'', Baltimore &amp; London: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida thus explicitly refers the term {{lang|fr|différance}} to life, and in particular to life as the history of inscription and retention, whether this is genetic or technological (from writing to "electronic card indexes"). And thus grammatology is not a science of man because it deconstructs any anthropocentrism, in the sense that the inscription in question falls on both sides of the divide human/non-human.

Yet, in the article "{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}}", Derrida refers {{lang|fr|différance}} not to ''physis'', that is, ''life'', but to "all the others of ''physis''—''tekhnè'', ''nomos'', ''thesis'', society, freedom, history, mind, etc.—as ''physis'' differed and deferred, or as ''physis'' differing and deferring."&lt;ref name=Margins&gt;Derrida, Jacques. "{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}}", ''Margins of Philosophy'', Chicago &amp; London: University of Chicago Press, 1982, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Stiegler]] argues in his book, ''[[Technics and Time, 1]]'', that this represents a hesitation in Derrida: "Now phusis as life was already différance. There is an indecision, a passage remaining to be thought. At issue is the specificity of the temporality of life in which life is inscription in the nonliving, spacing, temporalisation, differentiation, and deferral by, of and in the nonliving, in the dead."&lt;ref name=Technics&gt;Stiegler, Bernard. ''[[Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus]]'', Stanford: Stanford University Press, pp. 139–40.&lt;/ref&gt; What this suggests to Stiegler is that grammatology—a logic of the {{lang|fr|grammè}}—must be supplemented with a history of grammatisation, a history of all the forms and techniques of inscription, from genetics to technics, each stage of which will be found to possess its own logic. Only in this way can {{lang|fr|différance}} be thought as the differing and deferral ''of'' life (life as the emergence of a difference from non-life, specifically as the deferral of [[entropy]]), ''and'' as the difference ''from'' ''physis'' through which the human must inevitably be defined (the human as the inauguration of ''another'' memory, neither the memory of genetics nor that of the individual, but rather a memory consisting in "inscription in the nonliving," that is, ''technical'' memory).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19224">{{Short description|A version of scientific notation in which the exponent of ten reflects powers of a thousand}}
'''Engineering notation''' or '''engineering form''' is a version of [[scientific notation]] in which the exponent of ten must be divisible by three (i.e., they are powers of a thousand, but written as, for example, 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; instead of 1000&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). As an alternative to writing powers of 10, [[SI prefix]]es can be used,&lt;ref name="Gordon_1969"/&gt; which also usually provide steps of a factor of a thousand.&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_Cubic"/&gt;

On most calculators, engineering notation is called "ENG" mode.

=={{anchor|Exponent shift}}History==
An early implementation of engineering notation in form of range selection and number display with SI prefixes was introduced in the computerized HP&amp;nbsp;5360A [[frequency counter]] by [[Hewlett-Packard]] in 1969.&lt;ref name="Gordon_1969"/&gt;

Based on an idea by Peter D. Dickinson&lt;ref name="Dickinson_1976"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordon_1969"/&gt; the first [[calculator]] to support engineering notation displaying the power-of-ten exponent values was the [[HP-25]] in 1975.&lt;ref name="Neff_1975"/&gt; It was implemented as a dedicated display mode in addition to scientific notation.

In 1975 [[Commodore Business Machines|Commodore]] introduced a number of scientific calculators (like the [[Commodore SR4148|SR4148]]/SR4148R&lt;ref name="Commodore_SR4148R"/&gt; and [[Commodore SR4190R|SR4190R]]&lt;ref name="Commodore_SR4190R"/&gt;) providing a ''variable scientific notation'', where pressing the {{button|EE↓}} and {{button|EE↑}} keys shifted the exponent and decimal point by ±1&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_Exp-Shift"/&gt; in ''scientific''&lt;!-- not engineering! --&gt; notation. Between 1976 and 1980 the same ''exponent shift'' facility was also available on some [[Texas Instruments]] calculators of the pre-[[LCD]] era such as early [[TI SR-40|SR-40]],&lt;ref name="SR-40"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SR-40_Manual"/&gt; [[TI-30]]&lt;ref name="TI-30"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TI-30_Manual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TI-30-BR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TI-30_BR_Manual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TI-30_2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TI-30_RCI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TI-30_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TI-30_Super"/&gt; and [[TI-45]]&lt;ref name="TI-45"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TI-45_Manual"/&gt; model variants utilizing ({{button|INV}}){{button|EE↓}} instead. This can be seen as a precursor to a feature implemented on many [[Casio]] calculators since about 1978/1979 (f.e. in the [[Casio FX-501P|FX-501P]]/[[Casio FX-502P|FX-502P]]), where number display in ''engineering'' notation is available on demand by the single press of a ({{button|INV}}){{button|ENG}} button (instead of having to activate a dedicated display mode as on most other calculators), and subsequent button presses would shift the exponent and decimal point of the number displayed by ±3&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_Exp-Shift"/&gt; in order to easily let results match a desired prefix. Some graphical calculators (for example the [[Casio fx-9860G|fx-9860G]]) in the 2000s also support the display of some SI prefixes (f, p, n, µ, m, k, M, G, T, P, E) as suffixes in engineering mode.

==Overview==
Compared to normalized scientific notation, one disadvantage of using SI prefixes and engineering notation is that [[significant figure]]s are not always readily apparent. For example, 500&amp;nbsp;µm and 500&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m cannot express the [[uncertainty]] distinctions between 5&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m, 5.0&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m, and 5.00&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m. This can be solved by changing the range of the coefficient in front of the power from the common 1–1000 to 0.001–1.0. In some cases this may be suitable; in others it may be impractical. In the previous example, 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm, 0.50&amp;nbsp;mm, or 0.500&amp;nbsp;mm would have been used to show uncertainty and significant figures. It is also common to state the precision explicitly, such as "47&amp;nbsp;k&amp;Omega; ±5%"

Another example: when the [[speed of light]] (exactly {{val|299792458|u=m/s}}&lt;ref name="CUU_2014_c"/&gt; by the definition of the meter and second) is expressed as 3.00&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m/s or 3.00&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;km/s then it is clear that it is between 299 500&amp;nbsp;km/s and 300 500&amp;nbsp;km/s, but when using 300&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m/s, or 300&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;km/s, 300 000&amp;nbsp;km/s, or the unusual but short 300&amp;nbsp;Mm/s, this is not clear. A possibility is using 0.300&amp;nbsp;Gm/s, convenient to write, but somewhat impractical in understanding (writing something large as a fraction of something even larger; in a context of larger numbers expressed in the same unit this could be convenient, but that is not applicable here).

On the other hand, engineering notation allows the numbers to explicitly match their corresponding SI prefixes, which facilitates reading and oral communication. For example, 12.5&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m can be read as "twelve-point-five nanometers" and written as 12.5&amp;nbsp;nm, while its scientific notation equivalent 1.25&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m would likely be read out as "one-point-two-five times ten-to-the-negative-eight meters".

Engineering notation, like scientific notation generally, can use the [[E-notation]], such that

:3.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;

can be written as

:3.0E−9 (or 3.0e−9)

The ''E'' (or ''e'') should not be confused with the [[E (mathematical constant)|exponential ''e'']] which holds a completely different significance. In the latter case, it would be shown that 3e&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 0.000 370 23.

=={{anchor|Binary}}Binary engineering notation==
Just like decimal engineering notation can be viewed as a base-1000 scientific notation (10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1000), [[Binary numeral system|binary]] engineering notation relates to a base-1024 scientific notation (2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; = 1024), where the exponent of two must be divisible by ten. This is closely related to the base-2 [[floating-point]] representation commonly used in computer arithmetic, and the usage of IEC [[binary prefix]]es (e.g. 1B10 for 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;, 1B20 for 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;, 1B30 for 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;, 1B40 for 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; etc.).&lt;ref name="Martin_1968"/&gt;

[[File:Cagnacci Allegoria.jpg|thumb|An [[allegorical]] painting of a woman, representing eternity. She holds an [[hourglass]], a skull rests on the table beside her, and an [[Ouroboros]] floats above her head. All of these are common symbols of eternity.]]

'''Eternity''' in [[common parlance]] is an infinitely long period of [[time]]. In [[classical philosophy]], however, eternity is defined as what exists outside time while sempiternity is the concept that corresponds to the colloquial definition of eternity. 

Eternity is an  important concept in many [[religion]]s, where the god or gods are said to endure eternally. Some, such as [[Aristotle]], would say the same about the natural [[cosmos]] in regard to both past and future eternal duration, and like the eternal [[Platonic realism|Platonic form]]s, [[immutability (theology)|immutability]] was considered essential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/eternity/#Ety |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Eternity |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
{{see also|Philosophy of space and time}}
[[Aristotle]] [[arguments for eternity|argued]] that the [[cosmos]] has no beginning. In Aristotle's [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]], eternity is the [[unmoved mover]] (God), understood as the [[gradient]] of [[Minimum total potential energy principle|total synergy]] ("produces motion by being loved").&lt;ref&gt;Yu, Jiyuan [https://books.google.com/books?id=T5pRlUoAbmIC&amp;pg=PA188 The Structure of Being in Aristotle’s Metaphysics] Springer, 2003, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boethius]] defined eternity as "simultaneously full and perfect possession of interminable life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boedder|first1=Bernard|title=Natural Theology|url=http://www3.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/etext/nath34.htm|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=March 15, 2015|quote=Aeternitas est interminablis vitae tota simul et perfecta possessio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolism ==
Eternity is often symbolized by the image of a snake swallowing its own tail, known as the [[Ouroboros]] (or Uroboros). The circle is also commonly used as a symbol for eternity, as is the mathematical symbol of infinity, &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;. {{cn|date=March 2015}}   Symbolically, it suggests that Eternity has no beginning or end.

[[File:Radical feminist graffit spain.jpg|right|thumb|Feminist stencil graffiti in Spain, 2013: "without you, I am me"]]
'''Female graffiti artists''' are an active part in [[Hip hop#Graffiti|hip hop graffiti]] writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lombard|first1=Kara-Jane|title=Men against the wall: Graffiti(ed) masculinities|journal=Journal of Men Studies|volume=21|issue=2013|pages=178–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female graffiti artists can face challenges of overt [[sexism]] and sexual assault from fellow artists while executing their work. Examples of female graffiti artists include [[Lady Pink]], Charmin 65, and [[Tatyana Fazlalizadeh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kelley|first1=Robin D.|title=Yo' Mama's Disfunktional!: Fighting the Culture Wars in Urban America|date=1997|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female graffiti writers and street artists use [[Glossary of graffiti|murals, pieces, tags]], and [[street art]] to display their artwork and make their voices heard.

==Sexism in graffiti==
Women tend to be frequently hypersexualized and [[marginalized]] in [[hip hop]], which also extends to the hip hop graffiti subculture.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pabón|first1=Jessica N.|title=The Art of Getting Ovaries: Female Graffiti Artists and the Politics of Presence in Hip Hop's Graffiti Subculture|date=|issue=NYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female graffiti artists can often be sexualized, tokenized, and marginalized, which scholar Jessica Pabón feels can breed "a culture of misogyny" and can also lead to the oppression of female graffiti artists.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This ideology can also shape how female artists relate to other female writers and how they see themselves as the weaker writer or as a means to gain sexual attention from males.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Representation in graffiti art ==
Although female writers exist in the [[subculture]] of graffiti, their work tends to be more infrequently seen and acknowledged as that of their male counterparts, something that some artists feel mirrors the lack of [[Femininity|feminine]] representation in the [[art world]].&lt;ref name="Caldwell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperallergic.com/188992/why-arent-women-street-artists-just-street-artists/|title=Why Aren't "Women Street Artists" Just "Street Artists"?|website=Hyperallergic|last1=Caldwell|first1=Caroline|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, female artists can sometimes voluntary or involuntary become part of the [[Feminist activism in hip hop#Graffiti|feminist movement in graffiti]], as well as the [[feminist art movement]] by bringing their femininity.

==Activism and feminist graffiti communities==
In response to the perceived [[patriarchy]] of graffiti, female graffiti artists in locations such as Chile and Brazil are forming all-female crews where new female artists are given a positive space with support, mentoring and friendship.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pabón|first=Jessica|year=2013|title=Be about it: Graffiteras performing feminist community|url=|journal=The Drama Review|volume=3|pages=88–115|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These communities feel that by re-claiming space through graffiti they are "[protesting] her invisibility" and "[claiming] space in a subculture where the walls 'belong' to men".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some female graffiti artists use activism to combat topics such as [[street harassment]], as in the case of street artist [[Tatyana Fazlalizadeh]]'s Stop Telling Women To Smile campaign, which uses posters to empower women and show that catcalling is not acceptable.&lt;ref name="Caldwell" /&gt; Of the campaign, Fazlaizadeh has stated that she wants women to re-claim their public space as "(...) women are not outside on the street for the purpose of entertaining and pleasing men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yong|first1=John|title=Street Art to Combat Street Harassment Faced by Women|url=http://designtaxi.com/news/356559/Street-Art-To-%20Combat-Street-Harassment-Faced-By-Women/|date=15 March 2013|website=Designtaxi|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ana Dili.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|The monument for the ''mother tongue'' ("Ana dili") in [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]], [[Azerbaijan]]]]
A '''first language''', '''native language''', or '''mother/father/parent tongue''' (also known as '''arterial language''' or '''L1''') is a [[language]] that a person has been exposed to from birth&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield, Leonard. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gfrd-On5iFwC&amp;dq Language] {{ISBN|81-208-1196-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or within the [[critical period hypothesis|critical period]]. In some countries, the term ''native language'' or ''mother tongue'' refers to the language of one's ethnic group rather than one's first language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JeTwQB5doD4C&amp;dq/  "K*The Native Speaker: Myth and Reality By Alan Davies] {{ISBN|1-85359-622-1}} {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children brought up speaking more than one language can have more than one native language, and be [[Simultaneous bilingualism|bilingual]] or [[multilingual]]. By contrast, a ''[[second language]]'' is any language that one speaks other than one's first language.

==Terminology==
[[File:Kituwah Academy.png|thumb|right|A lesson at Kituwah Academy on the [[Qualla Boundary]] in [[North Carolina]]. The [[language immersion]] school, operated by the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]], teaches the same curriculum as other [[United States|American]] [[primary schools]], but [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]] is the medium of instruction from [[preschool]] onward, and students learn it as a first language. Such schools have proven instrumental in the preservation and perpetuation of Cherokee.]]
One of the more widely accepted definitions of native speakers is that they were born in a particular country raised to speak the language of that country during the critical period of their development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipedr.com/vol26/16-ICLLL%202011-L00033.pdf|title=Who Is An Ideal Native Speaker?! Andisheh Saniei, English Language Department, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran|website=ipedr.com|accessdate=1 February 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202012310/http://www.ipedr.com/vol26/16-ICLLL%202011-L00033.pdf|archivedate=2 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The person qualifies as a "native speaker" of a language by being born and immersed in the language during youth, in a family in which the adults shared a similar language experience as the child.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Love, Nigel, and Umberto Ansaldo. "The Native Speaker and the Mother Tongue." Language Sciences 32.6 (2010): 589-93. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Native speakers are considered to be an authority on their given language because of their natural acquisition process regarding the language, as opposed to having learned the language later in life. That is achieved by personal interaction with the language and speakers of the language. Native speakers will not necessarily be knowledgeable about every grammatical rule of the language, but they will have good "intuition" of the rules through their experience with the language.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Sometimes, the term "'''mother tongue'''" or "'''mother language'''" is used for the language that a person learned as a child at home (usually from their parents). Children growing up in bilingual homes can, according to this definition, have more than one mother tongue or native language.

In the context of population censuses conducted on the Canadian population, [[Statistics Canada]] defines ''mother tongue'' as "the first language learned at home in childhood and still understood by the individual at the time of the census."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/Products/Reference/dict/pop082.htm |title=mother tongue |work=2001 census |accessdate=25 August 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916172728/http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/Products/Reference/dict/pop082.htm |archivedate=16 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }} {{Unreliable source?|date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is quite possible that the first language learned is no longer a speaker's dominant language. That includes young immigrant children whose families have moved to a new linguistic environment as well as people who learned their mother tongue as a young child at home (rather than the language of the majority of the community), who may have lost, in part or in totality, the language they first [[language acquisition|acquired]] (see [[language attrition]]).

===Mother tongue===
[[File:Int-mother-lang-day-monument.jpg|thumb|right|International Mother Language Day Monument in Sydney, Australia, unveiling ceremony, 19 February 2006]]
According to [[Ivan Illich]], the term "mother tongue" was first used by [[Catholic]] monks to designate a particular language they used, instead of [[Latin]], when they are "speaking from the pulpit". That is, the "holy mother the Church" introduced this term and colonies inherited it from Christianity as a part of colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;[Ivan Illich] in Patttanayak, 1981:24 cited in [https://www.academia.edu/411071/_M_Other_Tongue_Syndrome_From_Breast_To_Bottle._ "(M)other Tongue Syndrome: From Breast to Bottle"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830045733/http://www.academia.edu/411071/_M_Other_Tongue_Syndrome_From_Breast_To_Bottle._ |date=30 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Illich, [http://www.preservenet.com/theory/Illich/Vernacular.html "Vernacular Values"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720033517/http://www.preservenet.com/theory/Illich/Vernacular.html |date=20 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, such as [[Kenya]], [[India]], and various East Asian countries, "mother language" or "native language" is used to indicate the language of one's [[ethnic group]] in both common and journalistic parlance ("I have no apologies for not learning my mother tongue"), rather than one's first language. Also, in [[Singapore]], "mother tongue" refers to the language of one's [[ethnic group]] regardless of actual proficiency, and the "first language" refers to English, which was established on the island under the [[British Empire]], which is the [[lingua franca]] for most post-independence Singaporeans because of its use as the language of instruction in government schools and as a working language.

[[J. R. R. Tolkien]], in his 1955 lecture "[[English and Welsh]]," distinguishes the "native tongue" from the "cradle tongue." The latter is the language one happens to learn during early childhood, and one's true "native tongue" may be different, possibly determined by an [[genetic memory (biology)|inherited linguistic taste]] and may later in life be discovered by a strong emotional affinity to a specific dialect (Tolkien personally confessed to such an affinity to the [[Middle English]] of the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] in particular).

On 17 November 1999, UNESCO designated 21 February as [[International Mother Language Day]].

==Significance==
The first language of a child is part of the personal, social and cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bisnet.or.id/vle/mod/resource/view.php?id=1663|title=Terri Hirst: The Importance of Maintaining a Childs First Language|author=|date=|website=bisnet.or.id|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312012655/http://bisnet.or.id/vle/mod/resource/view.php?id=1663|archivedate=12 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another impact of the first language is that it brings about the reflection and learning of successful social patterns of acting and speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~lera/papers/mandarin.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510152648/http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~lera/papers/mandarin.pdf |archivedate=10 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is basically responsible for differentiating the linguistic competence of acting. While some argue that there is no such thing as "native speaker" or a "mother tongue," it is important to understand the key terms as well as understand what it means to be a "non-native" speaker and the implications that can have on one's life. Research suggest that while a non-native speaker may develop fluency in a targeted language after about two years of immersion, it can actually take between five and seven years for that child to be on the same working level as their native speaking counterparts. That has implications on the education of non-native speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Second Language Acquisition Essential Information: Professor J. Cumminshttp://esl.fis.edu/teachers/support/cummin.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The topic of native speaker also gives way to discussion about what exactly bilingualism is. One definition is that a person is bilingual by being equally proficient in both languages. A person who grows up speaking English and begins learning Spanish for four years is not necessarily bilingual unless they speak the two languages with equal fluency. Pearl and Lambert were the first to test only “balanced” bilinguals—that is, a child who is completely fluent in two languages and feel that neither is their “native” language because they grasp the two so perfectly. This study found the following: balanced bilinguals perform significantly better in tasks that require flexibility (they constantly shift between the two known languages depending on the situation/requires constant juggling), more aware of arbitrary nature of language and also that balanced bilinguals choose word associations based on logical rather than phonetic preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alsintl.com/blog/language-proficiency/ |title=Language Proficiency: Defining Levels Avoids Confusion |publisher=Alsintl.com |date=2013-08-26 |accessdate=2013-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917082347/http://www.alsintl.com/blog/language-proficiency |archivedate=17 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/khakuta/research/publications/(1985)%20-%20THE%20RELATIONSHIP%20BETWEEN%20DEGREE%20OF%20BILINGUALISM%20AND.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024165613/http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/khakuta/research/publications/(1985)%20-%20THE%20RELATIONSHIP%20BETWEEN%20DEGREE%20OF%20BILINGUALISM%20AND.pdf |archivedate=24 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multilingualism==
One can have two or more native languages, thus being a native ''bilingual'' or indeed ''[[Multilingualism|multilingual]]''. The order in which these languages are learned is not necessarily the order of proficiency. For instance, if a French-speaking couple have a child who learned French first but then the child grew up in an English-speaking country, the child would likely be most proficient in English. Other examples are in [[India]], [[Languages of Indonesia|Indonesia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Kenya]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and [[Languages of South Africa|South Africa]], where most people speak more than one language.

The designation "native language," in its general usage, is thought to be imprecise and subject to various interpretations that are biased linguistically, especially with respect to bilingual children from ethnic minority groups. Many scholars{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} have given definitions of 'native language' based on common usage, the emotional relation of the speaker towards the language, and even its dominance in relation to the environment. However, all of three criteria lack precision. For many children whose home language differs from the language of the environment (the 'official' language), it is debatable which language is one's 'native language'.

===Defining "native speaker"===
The article titled “The Native Speaker: An Achievable Model?” published by the Asian EFL Journal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Joseph|title=The Native Speaker: An Achievable Model?|journal=Asian EFL Journal|volume=7|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that there are six general principles that relate to the definition of "native speaker". The principles, according to the study, are typically accepted by language experts across the scientific field. A native speaker is defined according to the guidelines as this:

#The individual acquired the language in early childhood.
#The individual has intuitive knowledge of the language.
#The individual is able to produce fluent, spontaneous discourse.
#The individual is competent in communication.
#The individual identifies with or is identified by a language community.
#The individual has a dialect accent (including the official dialect).

{{Thermodynamics|laws}}

The '''first law of thermodynamics''' is a version of the law of [[conservation of energy]], adapted for [[thermodynamic system]]s. The law of conservation of energy states that the total [[energy]] of an [[isolated system]] is constant; energy can be transformed from one form to another, but can be neither created nor destroyed. The first law is often formulated&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mandl|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The sign convention (Q is heat supplied ''to'' the system as, W is work done ''by'' the system) is that of [[Rudolf Clausius]], and it will be followed below.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U = Q - W.&lt;/math&gt;

It states that the change in the [[internal energy]] {{math|Δ''U''}} of a [[Thermodynamic system#Closed system|closed system]] is equal to the amount of [[heat]] {{mvar|Q}} supplied ''to'' the system, minus the amount of [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] {{mvar|W}} done ''by'' the system on its surroundings. An equivalent statement is that [[perpetual motion machines]] of the first kind are impossible.

==History==
Investigations into the nature of heat and work and their relationship began with the invention of the first engines used to extract water from mines. Improvements to such engines so as to increase their efficiency and power output came first from mechanics that worked with such machines but only slowly advanced the art. Deeper investigations that placed those on a mathematical and physics basis came later.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The first law of thermodynamics was developed empirically over about half a century. The first full statements of the law came in 1850 from [[Rudolf Clausius]] and from [[William Rankine]]; Rankine's statement is considered less distinct relative to Clausius'.&lt;ref name="Truesdell, C. A. 1980"/&gt; A main aspect of the struggle was to deal with the previously proposed [[caloric theory]] of heat.

In 1840, [[Germain Hess]] stated a [[Hess's Law|conservation law]] for the so-called 'heat of reaction' for chemical reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hess | first1 = H. | year = 1840 | title = Thermochemische Untersuchungen | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k151359/f397.image.r=Annalen%20der%20Physik%20(Leipzig)%20125.langEN | journal = Annalen der Physik und Chemie | volume = 126 | issue = 6| pages = 385–404 | doi=10.1002/andp.18401260620|bibcode = 1840AnP...126..385H }}&lt;/ref&gt; His law was later recognized as a consequence of the first law of thermodynamics, but Hess's statement was not explicitly concerned with the relation between energy exchanges by heat and work.

According to [[Clifford Truesdell|Truesdell]] (1980), [[Julius Robert von Mayer]] in 1841 made a statement that meant that "in a process at constant pressure, the heat used to produce expansion is universally interconvertible with work", but this is not a general statement of the first law.&lt;ref&gt;Truesdell, C. A. (1980), pp. 157–158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, Robert (1841). Paper: 'Remarks on the Forces of Nature"; as quoted in: Lehninger, A. (1971). Bioenergetics – the Molecular Basis of Biological Energy Transformations, 2nd. Ed. London: The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original statements: the "thermodynamic approach"===
The original nineteenth century statements of the first law of thermodynamics appeared in a conceptual framework in which transfer of energy as heat was taken as a [[primitive notion]], not defined or constructed by the theoretical development of the framework, but rather presupposed as prior to it and already accepted. The primitive notion of heat was taken as empirically established, especially through calorimetry regarded as a subject in its own right, prior to thermodynamics. Jointly primitive with this notion of heat were the notions of empirical temperature and thermal equilibrium. This framework also took as primitive the notion of transfer of energy as work. This framework did not presume a concept of energy in general, but regarded it as derived or synthesized from the prior notions of heat and work. By one author, this framework has been called the "thermodynamic" approach.&lt;ref name="Bailyn 79"&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first explicit statement of the first law of thermodynamics, by [[Rudolf Clausius]] in 1850, referred to cyclic thermodynamic processes.

::''In all cases in which work is produced by the agency of heat, a quantity of heat is consumed which is proportional to the work done; and conversely, by the expenditure of an equal quantity of work an equal quantity of heat is produced.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Rudolf Clausius|Clausius, R.]] (1850), page 373, translation here taken from Truesdell, C. A. (1980), pp. 188–189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clausius also stated the law in another form, referring to the existence of a function of state of the system, the [[internal energy]], and expressed it in terms of a differential equation for the increments of a thermodynamic process.&lt;ref&gt;Clausius, R. (1850), p. 384, equation (IIa.).&lt;/ref&gt; This equation may be described as follows:

::''In a thermodynamic process involving a closed system, the increment in the internal energy is equal to the difference between the heat accumulated by the system and the work done by it.''

Because of its definition in terms of increments, the value of the internal energy of a system is not uniquely defined. It is defined only up to an arbitrary additive constant of integration, which can be adjusted to give arbitrary reference zero levels. This non-uniqueness is in keeping with the abstract mathematical nature of the internal energy. The internal energy is customarily stated relative to a conventionally chosen standard reference state of the system.

The concept of internal energy is considered by Bailyn to be of "enormous interest". Its quantity cannot be immediately measured, but can only be inferred, by differencing actual immediate measurements. Bailyn likens it to the energy states of an atom, that were revealed by Bohr's energy relation ''hν'' = ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''{{'}}{{'}}&lt;/sub&gt; − ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''{{'}}&lt;/sub&gt;. In each case, an unmeasurable quantity (the internal energy, the atomic energy level) is revealed by considering the difference of measured quantities (increments of internal energy, quantities of emitted or absorbed radiative energy).&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conceptual revision: the "mechanical approach"===
In 1907, [[George H. Bryan]] wrote about systems between which there is no transfer of matter (closed systems): "'''Definition.''' When energy flows from one system or part of a system to another otherwise than by the performance of mechanical work, the energy so transferred is called ''heat''."&lt;ref&gt;[[George H. Bryan|Bryan, G. H.]] (1907), p. 47. Also Bryan had written about this in the ''Enzyklopädie der Mathematischen Wissenschaften'', volume 3, p. 81. Also in 1906 [[Jean Baptiste Perrin]] wrote about it in ''Bull. de la société français de philosophie'', volume 6, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition may be regarded as expressing a conceptual revision, as follows. This was systematically expounded in 1909 by [[Constantin Carathéodory]], whose attention had been drawn to it by [[Max Born]]. Largely through Born's&lt;ref name="Born 1949 {{math|V}}"/&gt; influence, this revised conceptual approach to the definition of heat came to be preferred by many twentieth-century writers. It might be called the "mechanical approach".&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994), pp. 65, 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy can also be transferred from one thermodynamic system to another in association with transfer of matter. Born points out that in general such energy transfer is not resolvable uniquely into work and heat moieties. In general, when there is transfer of energy associated with matter transfer, work and heat transfers can be distinguished only when they pass through walls physically separate from those for matter transfer.

The "mechanical" approach postulates the law of conservation of energy. It also postulates that energy can be transferred from one thermodynamic system to another [[Adiabatic process|adiabatically]] as work, and that energy can be held as the internal energy of a thermodynamic system. It also postulates that energy can be transferred from one thermodynamic system to another by a path that is non-adiabatic, and is unaccompanied by matter transfer. Initially, it "cleverly" (according to Bailyn) refrains from labelling as 'heat' such non-adiabatic, unaccompanied transfer of energy. It rests on the primitive notion of [[Adiabatic enclosure|''walls'']], especially adiabatic walls and non-adiabatic walls, defined as follows. Temporarily, only for purpose of this definition, one can prohibit transfer of energy as work across a wall of interest. Then walls of interest fall into two classes, (a) those such that arbitrary systems separated by them remain independently in their own previously established respective states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium; they are defined as adiabatic; and (b) those without such independence; they are defined as non-adiabatic.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, (1994), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach derives the notions of transfer of energy as heat, and of temperature, as theoretical developments, not taking them as primitives. It regards calorimetry as a derived theory. It has an early origin in the nineteenth century, for example in the work of [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]],&lt;ref&gt;Helmholtz, H. (1847).&lt;/ref&gt; but also in the work of many others.&lt;ref name="Bailyn 79"/&gt;

==Conceptually revised statement, according to the mechanical approach==
The revised statement of the first law postulates that a change in the internal energy of a system due to any arbitrary process, that takes the system from a given initial thermodynamic state to a given final equilibrium thermodynamic state, can be determined through the physical existence, for those given states, of a reference process that occurs purely through stages of adiabatic work.

The revised statement is then

::''For a closed system, in any arbitrary process of interest that takes it from an initial to a final state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, the change of internal energy is the same as that for a reference adiabatic work process that links those two states. This is so regardless of the path of the process of interest, and regardless of whether it is an adiabatic or a non-adiabatic process. The reference adiabatic work process may be chosen arbitrarily from amongst the class of all such processes.''

This statement is much less close to the empirical basis than are the original statements,&lt;ref name="Pippard 15"/&gt; but is often regarded as conceptually parsimonious in that it rests only on the concepts of adiabatic work and of non-adiabatic processes, not on the concepts of transfer of energy as heat and of empirical temperature that are presupposed by the original statements. Largely through the influence of [[Max Born]], it is often regarded as theoretically preferable because of this conceptual parsimony. Born particularly observes that the revised approach avoids thinking in terms of what he calls the "imported engineering" concept of heat engines.&lt;ref name="Born 1949 {{math|V}}"&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]] (1949), Lecture {{math|V}}, pp. 31–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Basing his thinking on the mechanical approach, Born in 1921, and again in 1949, proposed to revise the definition of heat.&lt;ref name="Born 1949 {{math|V}}"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Born 1921"/&gt; In particular, he referred to the work of [[Constantin Carathéodory]], who had in 1909 stated the first law without defining quantity of heat.&lt;ref name="Carathéodory 1909"/&gt; Born's definition was specifically for transfers of energy without transfer of matter, and it has been widely followed in textbooks (examples:&lt;ref name="Münster 23 24"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reif 122"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haase 1971"/&gt;).  Born observes that a transfer of matter between two systems is accompanied by a transfer of internal energy that cannot be resolved into heat and work components. There can be pathways to other systems, spatially separate from that of the matter transfer, that allow heat and work transfer independent of and simultaneous with the matter transfer. Energy is conserved in such transfers.

==Description==
===Cyclic processes===
The first law of thermodynamics for a closed system was expressed in two ways by Clausius. One way referred to cyclic processes and the inputs and outputs of the system, but did not refer to increments in the internal state of the system. The other way referred to an incremental change in the internal state of the system, and did not expect the process to be cyclic.

A cyclic process is one that can be repeated indefinitely often, returning the system to its initial state. Of particular interest for single cycle of a cyclic process are the net work done, and the net heat taken in (or 'consumed', in Clausius' statement), by the system.

In a cyclic process in which the system does net work on its surroundings, it is observed to be physically necessary not only that heat be taken into the system, but also, importantly, that some heat leave the system. The difference is the heat converted by the cycle into work. In each repetition of a cyclic process, the net work done by the system, measured in mechanical units, is proportional to the heat consumed, measured in calorimetric units.

The constant of proportionality is universal and independent of the system and in 1845 and 1847 was measured by [[James Prescott Joule|James Joule]], who described it as the ''[[mechanical equivalent of heat]]''.

===Sign conventions===
In a non-cyclic process, the change in the internal energy of a system is equal to net energy added as [[heat]] to the system minus the net [[Work (physics)|work]] done by the system, both being measured in mechanical units.  Taking {{math|Δ''U''}} as a change in internal energy, one writes

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U = Q\, - \, W\,\,\,\,\mathrm{(sign\,convention\,of\,Clausius\,and\,generally\,in\,this\,article)},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''Q''}} denotes the net quantity of heat supplied to the system by its surroundings and {{math|''W''}} denotes the net work done by the system. This sign convention is implicit in Clausius' statement of the law given above. It originated with the study of [[heat engine]]s that produce useful work by consumption of heat.

Often nowadays, however, writers use the [[IUPAC]] convention by which the first law is formulated with work done on the system by its surroundings having a positive sign. With this now often used sign convention for work, the first law for a closed system may be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U = Q + W\,\,\,\,\mathrm{(sign\,convention\,of\,IUPAC)}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.iupac.org/publications/books/gbook/IUPAC-GB3-2ndPrinting-Online-22apr2011.pdf Quantities, Units and Symbols in Physical Chemistry (IUPAC Green Book)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027103406/http://media.iupac.org/publications/books/gbook/IUPAC-GB3-2ndPrinting-Online-22apr2011.pdf |date=October 27, 2016}} See Sec. 2.11 Chemical Thermodynamics p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

This convention follows physicists such as [[Max Planck]],&lt;ref&gt;Planck, M. (1897/1903). [https://web.archive.org/web/20081008024138/http://www.archive.org/details/treatiseonthermo00planrich ''Treatise on Thermodynamics'', translated by A. Ogg, Longmans, Green &amp; Co., London.], p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; and considers all net energy transfers to the system as positive and all net energy transfers from the system as negative, irrespective of any use for the system as an engine or other device.

When a system expands in a fictive [[quasistatic process]], the work done by the system on the environment is the product, {{math|''P''&amp;nbsp;d''V''}}, &amp;nbsp;of pressure, {{math|''P''}}, and volume change, {{math|d''V''}}, whereas the work done ''on'' the system is {{math|&amp;nbsp;-''P''&amp;nbsp;d''V''}}.&amp;nbsp; Using either sign convention for work, the change in internal energy of the system is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm d U = \delta Q - P \, \mathrm d V\,\,\,\,\text{(quasi-static process)},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''δQ''}} denotes the infinitesimal amount of heat supplied to the system from its surroundings.

Work and heat are expressions of actual physical processes of supply or removal of energy, while the internal energy {{math|''U''}} is a mathematical abstraction that keeps account of the exchanges of energy that befall the system. Thus the term heat for {{math|''Q''}} means "that amount of energy added or removed by conduction of heat or by thermal radiation", rather than referring to a form of energy within the system. Likewise, the term work energy for {{math|''W''}} means "that amount of energy gained or lost as the result of work". Internal energy is a property of the system whereas work done and heat supplied are not. A significant result of this distinction is that a given internal energy change {{math|Δ''U''}} can be achieved by, in principle, many combinations of heat and work.

==Various statements of the law for closed systems==
The law is of great importance and generality and is consequently thought of from several points of view. Most careful textbook statements of the law express it for closed systems. It is stated in several ways, sometimes even by the same author.&lt;ref name="Bailyn 79"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Münster, A. (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

For the thermodynamics of closed systems, the distinction between transfers of energy as work and as heat is central and is within the scope of the present article. For the thermodynamics of [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|open systems]], such a distinction is beyond the scope of the present article, but some limited comments are made on it in the section below headed [[First law of thermodynamics#First law of thermodynamics for open systems|'First law of thermodynamics for open systems']].

There are two main ways of stating a law of thermodynamics, physically or mathematically. They should be logically coherent and consistent with one another.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Gamble Kirkwood|Kirkwood, J. G.]], Oppenheim, I. (1961), pp. 31–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a physical statement is that of [[Max Planck|Planck]] (1897/1903):

:It is in no way possible, either by mechanical, thermal, chemical, or other devices, to obtain perpetual motion, i.e. it is impossible to construct an engine which will work in a cycle and produce continuous work, or kinetic energy, from nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Planck, M. (1897/1903), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

This physical statement is restricted neither to closed systems nor to systems with states that are strictly defined only for thermodynamic equilibrium; it has meaning also for open systems and for systems with states that are not in thermodynamic equilibrium.

An example of a mathematical statement is that of Crawford (1963):

::::::For a given system we let {{math|Δ''E''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kin&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{=}}}} large-scale mechanical energy, {{math|Δ''E''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;pot&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{=}}}} large-scale potential energy, and {{math|Δ''E''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;tot&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{=}}}} total energy. The first two quantities are specifiable in terms of appropriate mechanical variables, and by definition

:::::::::&lt;math&gt;E^{\mathrm{tot}}=E^{\mathrm{kin}}+E^{\mathrm{pot}}+U\,\,.&lt;/math&gt;

::::::For any finite process, whether reversible or irreversible,

:::::::::&lt;math&gt;\Delta E^{\mathrm{tot}}=\Delta E^{\mathrm{kin}}+\Delta E^{\mathrm{pot}}+\Delta U\,\,.&lt;/math&gt;

::::::The first law in a form that involves the principle of conservation of energy more generally is

:::::::::&lt;math&gt;\Delta E^{\mathrm{tot}}=Q+W\,\,.&lt;/math&gt;

::::::Here {{math|''Q''}} and {{math|''W''}} are heat and work added, with no restrictions as to whether the process is reversible, quasistatic, or irreversible.[Warner, ''Am. J. Phys.'', '''29''', 124 (1961)]&lt;ref name ="Crawford 106"&gt;Crawford, F. H. (1963), pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

This statement by Crawford, for {{math|''W''}}, uses the sign convention of IUPAC, not that of Clausius. Though it does not explicitly say so, this statement refers to closed systems, and to internal energy {{math|''U''}} defined for bodies in states of thermodynamic equilibrium, which possess well-defined temperatures.

The history of statements of the law for closed systems has two main periods, before and after the work of [[George H. Bryan|Bryan]] (1907),&lt;ref name="Bryan 1907"&gt;[[George H. Bryan|Bryan, G. H.]] (1907), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Constantin Carathéodory|Carathéodory]] (1909),&lt;ref name="Carathéodory 1909"&gt;[[Constantin Carathéodory|Carathéodory]], C. (1909).&lt;/ref&gt; and the approval of Carathéodory's work given by [[Max Born|Born]] (1921).&lt;ref name="Born 1921"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Born | first1 = M. | year = 1921 | title = Kritische Betrachtungen zur traditionellen Darstellung der Thermodynamik | url = | journal = Phys. Z. | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 218–224 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier traditional versions of the law for closed systems are nowadays often considered to be out of date.

Carathéodory's celebrated presentation of equilibrium thermodynamics&lt;ref name="Carathéodory 1909"/&gt; refers to closed systems, which are allowed to contain several phases connected by internal walls of various kinds of impermeability and permeability (explicitly including walls that are permeable only to heat). Carathéodory's 1909 version of the first law of thermodynamics was stated in an axiom which refrained from defining or mentioning temperature or quantity of heat transferred. That axiom stated that the internal energy of a phase in equilibrium is a function of state, that the sum of the internal energies of the phases is the total internal energy of the system, and that the value of the total internal energy of the system is changed by the amount of work done adiabatically on it, considering work as a form of energy. That article considered this statement to be an expression of the law of conservation of energy for such systems. This version is nowadays widely accepted as authoritative, but is stated in slightly varied ways by different authors.

Such statements of the first law for closed systems assert the existence of internal energy as a function of state defined in terms of adiabatic work. Thus heat is not defined calorimetrically or as due to temperature difference. It is defined as a residual difference between change of internal energy and work done on the system, when that work does not account for the whole of the change of internal energy and the system is not adiabatically isolated.&lt;ref name="Münster 23 24"&gt;Münster, A. (1970), pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reif 122"&gt;Reif, F. (1965), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haase 1971"&gt;Haase, R. (1971), pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1909 Carathéodory statement of the law in axiomatic form does not mention heat or temperature, but the equilibrium states to which it refers are explicitly defined by variable sets that necessarily include "non-deformation variables", such as pressures, which, within reasonable restrictions, can be rightly interpreted as empirical temperatures,&lt;ref&gt;Buchdahl, H. A. (1966), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; and the walls connecting the phases of the system are explicitly defined as possibly impermeable to heat or permeable only to heat.

According to Münster (1970), "A somewhat unsatisfactory aspect of Carathéodory's theory is that a consequence of the Second Law must be considered at this point [in the statement of the first law], i.e. that it is not always possible to reach any state 2 from any other state 1 by means of an adiabatic process." Münster instances that no adiabatic process can reduce the internal energy of a system at constant volume.&lt;ref name="Münster 23 24"/&gt; Carathéodory's paper asserts that its statement of the first law corresponds exactly to Joule's experimental arrangement, regarded as an instance of adiabatic work. It does not point out that Joule's experimental arrangement performed essentially irreversible work, through friction of paddles in a liquid, or passage of electric current through a resistance inside the system, driven by motion of a coil and inductive heating, or by an external current source, which can access the system only by the passage of electrons, and so is not strictly adiabatic, because electrons are a form of matter, which cannot penetrate adiabatic walls. The paper goes on to base its main argument on the possibility of quasi-static adiabatic work, which is essentially reversible. The paper asserts that it will avoid reference to Carnot cycles, and then proceeds to base its argument on cycles of forward and backward quasi-static adiabatic stages, with isothermal stages of zero magnitude.

Sometimes the concept of internal energy is not made explicit in the statement.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Pippard|Pippard, A. B.]] (1957/1966), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reif, F. (1965), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, C. J. (1968/1983), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the existence of the internal energy is made explicit but work is not explicitly mentioned in the statement of the first postulate of thermodynamics. Heat supplied is then defined as the residual change in internal energy after work has been taken into account, in a non-adiabatic process.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Callen|Callen, H. B.]] (1960/1985), pp. 13, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

A respected modern author states the first law of thermodynamics as "Heat is a form of energy", which explicitly mentions neither internal energy nor adiabatic work. Heat is defined as energy transferred by thermal contact with a reservoir, which has a temperature, and is generally so large that addition and removal of heat do not alter its temperature.&lt;ref name="Kittel and Kroemer 1980"&gt;Kittel, C. Kroemer, H. (1980). ''Thermal Physics'', (first edition by Kittel alone 1969), second edition, W. H. Freeman, San Francisco, {{ISBN|0-7167-1088-9}}, pp. 49, 227.&lt;/ref&gt; A current student text on chemistry defines heat thus: "''heat'' is the exchange of thermal energy between a system and its surroundings caused by a temperature difference." The author then explains how heat is defined or measured by calorimetry, in terms of [[heat capacity]], specific heat capacity, molar heat capacity, and temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Tro, N. J. (2008). ''Chemistry. A Molecular Approach'', Pearson/Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River  NJ, {{ISBN|0-13-100065-9}}, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

A respected text disregards the Carathéodory's exclusion of mention of heat from the statement of the first law for closed systems, and admits heat calorimetrically defined along with work and internal energy.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Gamble Kirkwood|Kirkwood, J.

==Evidence for the first law of thermodynamics for closed systems==
The first law of thermodynamics for closed systems was originally induced from empirically observed evidence, including calorimetric evidence. It is nowadays, however, taken to provide the definition of heat via the law of conservation of energy and the definition of work in terms of changes in the external parameters of a system. The original discovery of the law was gradual over a period of perhaps half a century or more, and some early studies were in terms of cyclic processes.&lt;ref name="Truesdell, C. A. 1980"&gt;Truesdell, C. A. (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is an account in terms of changes of state of a closed system through compound processes that are not necessarily cyclic. This account first considers processes for which the first law is easily verified because of their simplicity, namely [[adiabatic process]]es (in which there is no transfer as heat) and [[Thermodynamics#System models|adynamic processes]] (in which there is no transfer as work).

===Adiabatic processes===
In an adiabatic process, there is transfer of energy as work but not as heat. For all adiabatic process that takes a system from a given initial state to a given final state, irrespective of how the work is done, the respective eventual total quantities of energy transferred as work are one and the same, determined just by the given initial and final states. The work done on the system is defined and measured by changes in mechanical or quasi-mechanical variables external to the system. Physically, adiabatic transfer of energy as work requires the existence of adiabatic enclosures.

For instance, in Joule's experiment, the initial system is a tank of water with a paddle wheel inside. If we isolate the tank thermally, and move the paddle wheel with a pulley and a weight, we can relate the increase in temperature with the distance descended by the mass. Next, the system is returned to its initial state, isolated again, and the same amount of work is done on the tank using different devices (an electric motor, a chemical battery, a spring,...). In every case, the amount of work can be measured independently. The return to the initial state is not conducted by doing adiabatic work on the system. The evidence shows that the final state of the water (in particular, its temperature and volume) is the same in every case. It is irrelevant if the work is [[electrical work|electrical]], mechanical, chemical,... or if done suddenly or slowly, as long as it is performed in an adiabatic way, that is to say, without heat transfer into or out of the system.

Evidence of this kind shows that to increase the temperature of the water in the tank, the qualitative kind of adiabatically performed work does not matter. No qualitative kind of adiabatic work has ever been observed to decrease the temperature of the water in the tank.

A change from one state to another, for example an increase of both temperature and volume, may be conducted in several stages, for example by externally supplied electrical work on a resistor in the body, and adiabatic expansion allowing the body to do work on the surroundings. It needs to be shown that the time order of the stages, and their relative magnitudes, does not affect the amount of adiabatic work that needs to be done for the change of state. According to one respected scholar: "Unfortunately, it does not seem that experiments of this kind have ever been carried out carefully. ... We must therefore admit that the statement which we have enunciated here, and which is equivalent to the first law of thermodynamics, is not well founded on direct experimental evidence."&lt;ref name="Pippard 15"&gt;[[Brian Pippard|Pippard, A. B.]] (1957/1966), p. 15. According to [[Herbert Callen]], in his most widely cited text, Pippard's text gives a "scholarly and rigorous treatment"; see Callen, H. B. (1960/1985), p. 485. It is also recommended by Münster, A. (1970), p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; Another expression of this view is "...&amp;nbsp;no systematic precise experiments to verify this generalization directly have ever been attempted."&lt;ref&gt;Kestin, J. (1966), p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

This kind of evidence, of independence of sequence of stages, combined with the above-mentioned evidence, of independence of qualitative kind of work, would show the existence of an important state variable that corresponds with adiabatic work, but not that such a state variable represented a conserved quantity. For the latter, another step of evidence is needed, which may be related to the concept of reversibility, as mentioned below.

That important state variable was first recognized and denoted &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; by Clausius in 1850, but he did not then name it, and he defined it in terms not only of work but also of heat transfer in the same process. It was also independently recognized in 1850 by Rankine, who also denoted it &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; ; and in 1851 by Kelvin who then called it "mechanical energy", and later "intrinsic energy". In 1865, after some hestitation, Clausius began calling his state function &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; "energy". In 1882 it was named as the ''[[internal energy]]'' by Helmholtz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cropper | first1 = W. H. | year = 1986 | title = Rudolf Clausius and the road to entropy | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UqbxZpELwHYC&amp;pg=PA93 | journal = Am. J. Phys. | volume = 54 | issue = | pages = 1068–1074 | doi=10.1119/1.14740|bibcode = 1986AmJPh..54.1068C }}&lt;/ref&gt; If only adiabatic processes were of interest, and heat could be ignored, the concept of internal energy would hardly arise or be needed. The relevant physics would be largely covered by the concept of potential energy, as was intended in the 1847 paper of Helmholtz on the principle of conservation of energy, though that did not deal with forces that cannot be described by a potential, and thus did not fully justify the principle. Moreover, that paper was critical of the early work of Joule that had by then been performed.&lt;ref&gt;Truesdell, C. A. (1980), pp. 161–162.&lt;/ref&gt; A great merit of the internal energy concept is that it frees thermodynamics from a restriction to cyclic processes, and allows a treatment in terms of thermodynamic states.

In an adiabatic process, adiabatic work takes the system either from a reference state &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; with internal energy &lt;math&gt;U(O)&lt;/math&gt; to an arbitrary one &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; with internal energy &lt;math&gt;U(A)&lt;/math&gt;, or from the state &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to the state &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;U(A)=U(O) - W^\mathrm{adiabatic}_{O\to A}\,\, \mathrm{or}\,\,U(O)=U(A) - W^\mathrm{adiabatic}_{A\to O}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Except under the special, and strictly speaking, fictional, condition of reversibility, only one of the processes &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{adiabatic},\,O\to A&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{adiabatic},\,{A\to O}\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;is empirically feasible by a simple application of externally supplied work. The reason for this is given as the second law of thermodynamics and is not considered in the present article.

The fact of such irreversibility may be dealt with in two main ways, according to different points of view:

*Since the work of Bryan (1907), the most accepted way to deal with it nowadays, followed by Carathéodory,&lt;ref name="Carathéodory 1909"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haase 1971"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buchdahl, H. A. (1966), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; is to rely on the previously established concept of quasi-static processes,&lt;ref&gt;[[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell, J. C.]] (1871). ''Theory of Heat'', Longmans, Green, and Co., London, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Planck, M. (1897/1903), Section 71, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; as follows. Actual physical processes of transfer of energy as work are always at least to some degree irreversible. The irreversibility is often due to mechanisms known as dissipative, that transform bulk kinetic energy into internal energy. Examples are friction and viscosity. If the process is performed more slowly, the frictional or viscous dissipation is less. In the limit of infinitely slow performance, the dissipation tends to zero and then the limiting process, though fictional rather than actual, is notionally reversible, and is called quasi-static. Throughout the course of the fictional limiting quasi-static process, the internal intensive variables of the system are equal to the external intensive variables, those that describe the reactive forces exerted by the surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, C. J. (1968/1983), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be taken to justify the formula
:&lt;math&gt;(1) \,\,\,\,\,\,\,W^\text{adiabatic, quasi-static}_{A\to O} = -W^\text{adiabatic, quasi-static}_{O\to A}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

*Another way to deal with it is to allow that experiments with processes of heat transfer to or from the system may be used to justify the formula (1) above. Moreover, it deals to some extent with the problem of lack of direct experimental evidence that the time order of stages of a process does not matter in the determination of internal energy. This way does not provide theoretical purity in terms of adiabatic work processes, but is empirically feasible, and is in accord with experiments actually done, such as the Joule experiments mentioned just above, and with older traditions.

The formula (1) above allows that to go by processes of quasi-static adiabatic work from the state &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to the state &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; we can take a path that goes through the reference state &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;, since the quasi-static adiabatic work is independent of the path

:&lt;math&gt;-W^\mathrm{adiabatic,\,quasi-static}_{A\to B}=-W^\mathrm{adiabatic,\,quasi-static}_{A\to O}-W^\mathrm{adiabatic,\,quasi-static}_{O\to B} = W^\mathrm{adiabatic,\,quasi-static}_{O\to A}- W^\mathrm{adiabatic,\,quasi-static}_{O\to B} = -U(A) + U(B) = \Delta U&lt;/math&gt;

This kind of empirical evidence, coupled with theory of this kind, largely justifies the following statement:

:''For all adiabatic processes between two specified states of a closed system of any nature, the net work done is the same regardless the details of the process, and determines a state function called internal energy, &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;."

===Adynamic processes===
{{See also|Thermodynamic processes}}
A complementary observable aspect of the first law is about [[heat transfer]]. Adynamic transfer of energy as heat can be measured empirically by changes in the surroundings of the system of interest by calorimetry. This again requires the existence of adiabatic enclosure of the entire process, system and surroundings, though the separating wall between the surroundings and the system is thermally conductive or radiatively permeable, not adiabatic. A calorimeter can rely on measurement of [[sensible heat]], which requires the existence of thermometers and measurement of temperature change in bodies of known sensible heat capacity under specified conditions; or it can rely on the measurement of [[latent heat]], through [[Calorimetry#Calorimetry through phase change|measurement of masses of material that change phase]], at temperatures fixed by the occurrence of phase changes under specified conditions in bodies of known latent heat of phase change. The calorimeter can be calibrated by adiabatically doing externally determined work on it. The most accurate method is by passing an electric current from outside through a resistance inside the calorimeter. The calibration allows comparison of calorimetric measurement of quantity of heat transferred with quantity of energy transferred as work. According to one textbook, "The most common device for measuring &lt;math&gt;\Delta U&lt;/math&gt; is an '''adiabatic bomb calorimeter'''."&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Atkins|Atkins, P.]], de Paula, J. (1978/2010). ''Physical Chemistry'', (first edition 1978), ninth edition 2010, Oxford University Press, Oxford UK, {{ISBN|978-0-19-954337-3}}, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; According to another textbook, "Calorimetry is widely used in present day laboratories."&lt;ref&gt;Kondepudi, D. (2008). ''Introduction to Modern Thermodynamics'', Wiley, Chichester, {{ISBN|978-0-470-01598-8}}, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one opinion, "Most thermodynamic data come from calorimetry..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gislason | first1 = E.

M. | year = 2010 | title = From Joule to Caratheodory and Born: A conceptual evolution of the first law of thermodynamics | url = | journal = J. Chem.

When the system evolves with transfer of energy as heat, without energy being transferred as work, in an adynamic process,&lt;ref&gt;[[J.R. Partington|Partington, J.R.]] (1949), p. 183: "[[William John Macquorn Rankine|Rankine]] calls the curves representing changes without performance of work, ''adynamics''."&lt;/ref&gt; the heat transferred to the system is equal to the increase in its internal energy:

:&lt;math&gt;Q^\mathrm{adynamic}_{A\to B}=\Delta U\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===General case for reversible processes===
Heat transfer is practically reversible when it is driven by practically negligibly small temperature gradients. Work transfer is practically reversible when it occurs so slowly that there are no frictional effects within the system; frictional effects outside the system should also be zero if the process is to be globally reversible. For a particular reversible process in general, the work done reversibly on the system, &lt;math&gt;W^{\mathrm{path}\,P_0,\, \mathrm{reversible}}_{A\to B}&lt;/math&gt;, and the heat transferred reversibly to the system, &lt;math&gt;Q^{\mathrm{path}\,P_0,\, \mathrm{reversible}}_{A\to B}&lt;/math&gt; are not required to occur respectively adiabatically or adynamically, but they must belong to the same particular process defined by its particular reversible path, &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt;, through the space of thermodynamic states. Then the work and heat transfers can occur and be calculated simultaneously.

Putting the two complementary aspects together, the first law for a particular reversible process can be written

:&lt;math&gt;-W^{\mathrm{path}\,P_0,\, \mathrm{reversible}}_{A\to B} + Q^{\mathrm{path}\,P_0,\, \mathrm{reversible}}_{A\to B} = \Delta U\, .&lt;/math&gt;

This combined statement is the expression the first law of thermodynamics for reversible processes for closed systems.

In particular, if no work is done on a thermally isolated closed system we have

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;.

This is one aspect of the law of conservation of energy and can be stated:

:''The internal energy of an isolated system remains constant.''

===General case for irreversible processes===
If, in a process of change of state of a closed system, the energy transfer is not under a practically zero temperature gradient and practically frictionless, then the process is irreversible. Then the heat and work transfers may be difficult to calculate, and irreversible thermodynamics is called for. Nevertheless, the first law still holds and provides a check on the measurements and calculations of the work done irreversibly on the system, &lt;math&gt;W^{\mathrm{path}\,P_1,\, \mathrm{irreversible}}_{A\to B}&lt;/math&gt;, and the heat transferred irreversibly to the system, &lt;math&gt;Q^{\mathrm{path}\,P_1,\, \mathrm{irreversible}}_{A\to B}&lt;/math&gt;, which belong to the same particular process defined by its particular irreversible path, &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt;, through the space of thermodynamic states.

:&lt;math&gt;-W^{\mathrm{path}\,P_1,\, \mathrm{irreversible}}_{A\to B} + Q^{\mathrm{path}\,P_1,\, \mathrm{irreversible}}_{A\to B} = \Delta U\, .&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the internal energy &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a function of state and that the internal energy change &lt;math&gt;\Delta U&lt;/math&gt; between two states is a function only of the two states.

===Overview of the weight of evidence for the law===
The first law of thermodynamics is so general that its predictions cannot all be directly tested. In many properly conducted experiments it has been precisely supported, and never violated. Indeed, within its scope of applicability, the law is so reliably established, that, nowadays, rather than experiment being considered as testing the accuracy of the law, it is more practical and realistic to think of the law as testing the accuracy of experiment. An experimental result that seems to violate the law may be assumed to be inaccurate or wrongly conceived, for example due to failure to account for an important physical factor. Thus, some may regard it as a principle more abstract than a law.

==State functional formulation for infinitesimal processes==
When the heat and work transfers in the equations above are infinitesimal in magnitude, they are often denoted by {{math|''δ''}}, rather than [[exact differential]]s denoted by {{math|''d''}}, as a reminder that heat and work do not describe the ''state'' of any system. The integral of an [[inexact differential]] depends upon the particular path taken through the space of thermodynamic parameters while the integral of an exact differential depends only upon the initial and final states. If the initial and final states are the same, then the integral of an inexact differential may or may not be zero, but the integral of an exact differential is always zero. The path taken by a thermodynamic system through a chemical or physical change is known as a [[thermodynamic process]].

The first law for a closed homogeneous system may be stated in terms that include concepts that are established in the second law. The internal energy {{math|''U''}} may then be expressed as a function of the system's defining state variables {{math|''S''}}, entropy, and {{math|''V''}}, volume: {{math|''U'' {{=}} ''U'' (''S'', ''V'')}}. In these terms, {{math|''T''}}, the system's temperature, and {{math|''P''}}, its pressure, are partial derivatives of {{math|''U''}} with respect to {{math|''S''}} and {{math|''V''}}. These variables are important throughout thermodynamics, though not necessary for the statement of the first law. Rigorously, they are defined only when the system is in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium. For some purposes, the concepts provide good approximations for scenarios sufficiently near to the system's internal thermodynamic equilibrium.

The first law requires that:

:&lt;math&gt;dU=\delta Q-\delta W \, \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \text {(closed system, general process, quasi-static or irreversible).}&lt;/math&gt;

Then, for the fictive case of a reversible process, {{math|d''U''}} can be written in terms of exact differentials. One may imagine reversible changes, such that there is at each instant negligible departure from  thermodynamic equilibrium within the system. This excludes isochoric work. Then, mechanical [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] is given by {{math|δ''W'' {{=}} - ''P dV''}} and the quantity of heat added can be expressed as {{math|''δQ'' {{=}} ''T dS''}}. For these conditions

:&lt;math&gt;dU=TdS-PdV \, \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \text {(closed system, reversible process).}&lt;/math&gt;

While this has been shown here for reversible changes, it is valid in general, as {{math|''U''}} can be considered as a thermodynamic state function of the defining state variables {{math|''S''}} and {{math|''V''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;(2) \,\,\,\,\,\,\,dU=TdS-PdV \, \,\,\,\, \text {(closed system, general process, quasi-static or irreversible).}&lt;/math&gt;

Equation (2) is known as the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]] for a closed system in the energy representation, for which the defining state variables are {{math|''S''}} and {{math|''V''}}, with respect to which {{math|''T''}} and {{math|''P''}} are partial derivatives of {{math|''U''}}.&lt;ref&gt;Denbigh, K. (1954/1981), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, C. J. (1968/1983), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Callen|Callen, H. B.]] (1960/1985), pp. 36, 41, 63.&lt;/ref&gt; It is only in the fictive reversible case, when isochoric work is excluded, that the work done and heat transferred are given by {{math|−''P'' d''V''}} and {{math|''T'' d''S''}}.

In the case of a closed system in which the particles of the system are of different types and, because chemical reactions may occur, their respective numbers are not necessarily constant, the fundamental thermodynamic relation for d''U'' becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;dU=TdS-PdV + \sum_i \mu_i dN_i.\,&lt;/math&gt;

where d''N''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the (small) increase in amount of type-i particles in the reaction, and ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is known as the [[chemical potential]] of the type-i particles in the system. If d''N''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is expressed in [[Mole (unit)|mol]] then ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is expressed in J/mol. If the system has more external mechanical variables than just the volume that can change, the fundamental thermodynamic relation further generalizes to:

:&lt;math&gt;dU = T dS - \sum_{i}X_{i}dx_{i} + \sum_{j}\mu_{j}dN_{j}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Here the ''X''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[generalized forces]] corresponding to the external variables ''x''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. The parameters ''X''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are independent of the size of the system and are called intensive parameters and the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are proportional to the size and called extensive parameters.

For an open system, there can be transfers of particles as well as energy into or out of the system during a process. For this case, the first law of thermodynamics still holds, in the form that the internal energy is a function of state and the change of internal energy in a process is a function only of its initial and final states, as noted in the section below headed [[First law of thermodynamics#First law of thermodynamics for open systems|First law of thermodynamics for open systems]].

A useful idea from mechanics is that the energy gained by a particle is equal to the force applied to the particle multiplied by the displacement of the particle while that force is applied. Now consider the first law without the heating term: d''U'' = -''P''d''V''. The pressure ''P'' can be viewed as a force (and in fact has units of force per unit area) while d''V''is the displacement (with units of distance times area). We may say, with respect to this work term, that a pressure difference forces a transfer of volume, and that the product of the two (work) is the amount of energy transferred out of the system as a result of the process. If one were to make this term negative then this would be the work done on the system.

It is useful to view the ''T''d''S'' term in the same light: here the temperature is known as a "generalized" force (rather than an actual mechanical force) and the entropy is a generalized displacement.

Similarly, a difference in chemical potential between groups of particles in the system drives a chemical reaction that changes the numbers of particles, and the corresponding product is the amount of chemical potential energy transformed in process. For example, consider a system consisting of two phases: liquid water and water vapor. There is a generalized "force" of evaporation that drives water molecules out of the liquid. There is a generalized "force" of condensation that drives vapor molecules out of the vapor. Only when these two "forces" (or chemical potentials) are equal is there equilibrium, and the net rate of transfer zero.

The two thermodynamic parameters that form a generalized force-displacement pair are called "conjugate variables". The two most familiar pairs are, of course, pressure-volume, and temperature-entropy.

==Spatially inhomogeneous systems==
Classical thermodynamics is initially focused on closed homogeneous systems (e.g. Planck 1897/1903&lt;ref name="Planck 1903"/&gt;), which might be regarded as 'zero-dimensional' in the sense that they have no spatial variation. But it is desired to study also systems with distinct internal motion and spatial inhomogeneity. For such systems, the principle of conservation of energy is expressed in terms not only of internal energy as defined for homogeneous systems, but also in terms of kinetic energy and potential energies of parts of the inhomogeneous system with respect to each other and with respect to long-range external forces.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994), 254–256.&lt;/ref&gt; How the total energy of a system is allocated between these three more specific kinds of energy varies according to the purposes of different writers; this is because these components of energy are to some extent mathematical artefacts rather than actually measured physical quantities. For any closed homogeneous component of an inhomogeneous closed system, if &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; denotes the total energy of that component system, one may write

:&lt;math&gt;E = E^{\mathrm {kin}} + E^{\mathrm {pot}} + U&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E^{\mathrm {kin}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E^{\mathrm {pot}}&lt;/math&gt; denote respectively the total kinetic energy and the total potential energy of the component closed homogeneous system, and &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; denotes its internal energy.&lt;ref name ="Crawford 106"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glansdorff, P., [[Ilya Prigogine|Prigogine, I.]] (1971), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Potential energy can be exchanged with the surroundings of the system when the surroundings impose a force field, such as gravitational or electromagnetic, on the system.

A compound system consisting of two interacting closed homogeneous component subsystems has a potential energy of interaction &lt;math&gt;E^{\mathrm {pot}}_{12}&lt;/math&gt; between the subsystems. Thus, in an obvious notation, one may write

:&lt;math&gt;E = E^{\mathrm {kin}}_1 + E^{\mathrm {pot}}_1 + U_1 + E^{\mathrm {kin}}_2 + E^{\mathrm {pot}}_2 + U_2 + E^{\mathrm {pot}}_{12}&lt;/math&gt;

The quantity &lt;math&gt;E^{\mathrm {pot}}_{12}&lt;/math&gt; in general lacks an assignment to either subsystem in a way that is not arbitrary, and this stands in the way of a general non-arbitrary definition of transfer of energy as work. On occasions, authors make their various respective arbitrary assignments.&lt;ref&gt;Tisza, L. (1966), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between internal and kinetic energy is hard to make in the presence of turbulent motion within the system, as friction gradually dissipates macroscopic kinetic energy of localised bulk flow into molecular random motion of molecules that is classified as internal energy.&lt;ref&gt;Denbigh, K. G. (1951), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;  The rate of dissipation by friction of kinetic energy of localised bulk flow into internal energy,&lt;ref name="Kelvin 1852a"&gt;[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Thomson, W.]] (1852 a).

This is a serious difficulty for attempts to define entropy for time-varying spatially inhomogeneous systems.

==First law of thermodynamics for open systems==
For the first law of thermodynamics, there is no trivial passage of physical conception from the closed system view to an open system view.&lt;ref name="Münster 51"&gt;Münster A. (1970), Sections 14, 15, pp. 45–51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Landsberg, P. T. (1978), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; For closed systems, the concepts of an adiabatic enclosure and of an adiabatic wall are fundamental. Matter and internal energy cannot permeate or penetrate such a wall. For an open system, there is a wall that allows penetration by matter. In general, matter in diffusive motion carries with it some internal energy, and some microscopic potential energy changes accompany the motion. An open system is not adiabatically enclosed.

There are some cases in which a process for an open system can, for particular purposes, be considered as if it were for a closed system. In an open system, by definition hypothetically or potentially, matter can pass between the system and its surroundings. But when, in a particular case, the process of interest involves only hypothetical or potential but no actual passage of matter, the process can be considered as if it were for a closed system.

===Internal energy for an open system===
Since the revised and more rigorous definition of the internal energy of a closed system rests upon the possibility of processes by which adiabatic work takes the system from one state to another, this leaves a problem for the definition of internal energy for an open system, for which adiabatic work is not in general possible. According to [[Max Born]], the transfer of matter and energy across an open connection "cannot be reduced to mechanics".&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]] (1949), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the case of closed systems, for open systems, in the presence of diffusion, there is no unconstrained and unconditional physical distinction between convective transfer of internal energy by bulk flow of matter, the transfer of internal energy without transfer of matter (usually called heat conduction and work transfer), and change of various potential energies.&lt;ref&gt;Denbigh, K. G. (1951), p. 56. Denbigh states in a footnote that he is indebted to correspondence with [[Edward A. Guggenheim|E. A. Guggenheim]] and with N. K. Adam. From this, Denbigh concludes "It seems, however, that when a system is able to exchange both heat and matter with its environment, it is impossible to make an unambiguous distinction between energy transported as heat and by the migration of matter, without already assuming the existence of the 'heat of transport'."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fitts, D. D. (1962), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denbigh, K. (1954/1971), pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; The older traditional way and the conceptually revised (Carathéodory) way agree that there is no physically unique definition of heat and work transfer processes between open systems.&lt;ref&gt;Münster, A. (1970), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haase, R. (1963/1969), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haase, R. (1971), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith 1980"&gt;Smith, D. A. (1980).

Phys.'', '''33''': 95–105.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012014734/http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/PH800095.htm |date=October 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailyn, M. 1994, p. 308"&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994), p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Balian|Balian, R.]] (1991/2007), p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, between two otherwise isolated open systems an adiabatic wall is by definition impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Münster, A. (1970), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; This problem is solved by recourse to the principle of [[conservation of energy]]. This principle allows a composite isolated system to be derived from two other component non-interacting isolated systems, in such a way that the total energy of the composite isolated system is equal to the sum of the total energies of the two component isolated systems. Two previously isolated systems can be subjected to the [[thermodynamic operation]] of placement between them of a wall permeable to matter and energy, followed by a time for establishment of a new thermodynamic state of internal equilibrium in the new single unpartitioned system.&lt;ref&gt;Tisza, L. (1966), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The internal energies of the initial two systems and of the final new system, considered respectively as closed systems as above, can be measured.&lt;ref name="Münster 51"/&gt; Then the law of conservation of energy requires that
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U_s+\Delta U_o=0\, ,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Callen 54"&gt;Callen H. B. (1960/1985), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tisza 110"&gt;Tisza, L. (1966), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

where {{math|Δ''U''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|Δ''U''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;}} denote the changes in internal energy of the system and of its surroundings respectively. This is a statement of the first law of thermodynamics for a transfer between two otherwise isolated open systems,&lt;ref&gt;Tisza, L. (1966), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; that fits well with the conceptually revised and rigorous statement of the law stated above.

For the thermodynamic operation of adding two systems with internal energies {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, to produce a new system with internal energy {{math|''U''}}, one may write {{math|''U'' {{=}} ''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}; the reference states for  {{math|''U''}}, {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} should be specified accordingly, maintaining also that the internal energy of a system be proportional to its mass, so that the internal energies are [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive variables]].&lt;ref name="Münster 51"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ilya Prigogine|Prigogine, I.]], (1955/1967), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a sense in which this kind of additivity expresses a fundamental postulate that goes beyond the simplest ideas of classical closed system thermodynamics; the extensivity of some variables is not obvious, and needs explicit expression; indeed one author goes so far as to say that it could be recognized as a fourth law of thermodynamics, though this is not repeated by other authors.&lt;ref&gt;Landsberg, P. T. (1961), pp. 142, 387.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Landsberg, P. T. (1978), pp. 79, 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also of course
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta N_s+\Delta N_o=0\, ,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Callen 54"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tisza 110"/&gt;

where {{math|Δ''N''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|Δ''N''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;}} denote the changes in mole number of a component substance of the system and of its surroundings respectively. This is a statement of the law of [[conservation of mass]].

===Process of transfer of matter between an open system and its surroundings===
A system connected to its surroundings only through contact by a single permeable wall, but otherwise isolated, is an open system. If it is initially in a state of contact equilibrium with a surrounding subsystem, a [[thermodynamic process]] of transfer of matter can be made to occur between them if the surrounding subsystem is subjected to some thermodynamic operation, for example, removal of a partition between it and some further surrounding subsystem. The removal of the partition in the surroundings initiates a process of exchange between the system and its contiguous surrounding subsystem.

An example is evaporation. One may consider an open system consisting of a collection of liquid, enclosed except where it is allowed to evaporate into or to receive condensate from its vapor above it, which may be considered as its contiguous surrounding subsystem, and subject to control of its volume and temperature.

A thermodynamic process might be initiated by a thermodynamic operation in the surroundings, that mechanically increases in the controlled volume of the vapor. Some mechanical work will be done within the surroundings by the vapor, but also some of the parent liquid will evaporate and enter the vapor collection which is the contiguous surrounding subsystem. Some internal energy will accompany the vapor that leaves the system, but it will not make sense to try to uniquely identify part of that internal energy as heat and part of it as work. Consequently, the energy transfer that accompanies the transfer of matter between the system and its surrounding subsystem cannot be uniquely split into heat and work transfers to or from the open system. The component of total energy transfer that accompanies the transfer of vapor into the surrounding subsystem is customarily called 'latent heat of evaporation', but this use of the word heat is a quirk of customary historical language, not in strict compliance with the thermodynamic definition of transfer of energy as heat. In this example, kinetic energy of bulk flow and potential energy with respect to long-range external forces such as gravity are both considered to be zero. The first law of thermodynamics refers to the change of internal energy of the open system, between its initial and final states of internal equilibrium.

===Open system with multiple contacts===
An open system can be in contact equilibrium with several other systems at once.&lt;ref name="Carathéodory 1909"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prigogine, I. (1947), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Born, M. (1949), Appendix 8, [https://archive.org/stream/naturalphilosoph032159mbp#page/n157/mode/2up pp. 146–149] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407221517/https://archive.org/stream/naturalphilosoph032159mbp#page/n157/mode/2up |date=April 7, 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aston, J. G., Fritz, J. J. (1959), Chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kestin, J. (1961).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Landsberg, P. T. (1961), pp. 128–142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tisza, L. (1966), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tschoegl, N. W. (2000), p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

This includes cases in which there is contact equilibrium between the system, and several subsystems in its surroundings, including separate connections with subsystems through walls that are permeable to the transfer of matter and internal energy as heat and allowing friction of passage of the transferred matter, but immovable, and separate connections through adiabatic walls with others, and separate connections through diathermic walls impermeable to matter with yet others. Because there are physically separate connections that are permeable to energy but impermeable to matter, between the system and its surroundings, energy transfers between them can occur with definite heat and work characters. Conceptually essential here is that the internal energy transferred with the transfer of matter is measured by a variable that is mathematically independent of the variables that measure heat and work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]] (1949), [https://archive.org/stream/naturalphilosoph032159mbp#page/n157/mode/2up pp. 146–147] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407221517/https://archive.org/stream/naturalphilosoph032159mbp#page/n157/mode/2up |date=April 7, 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

With such independence of variables, the total increase of internal energy in the process is then determined as the sum of the internal energy transferred from the surroundings with the transfer of matter through the walls that are permeable to it, and of the internal energy transferred to the system as heat through the diathermic walls, and of the energy transferred to the system as work through the adiabatic walls, including the energy transferred to the system by long-range forces. These simultaneously transferred quantities of energy are defined by events in the surroundings of the system. Because the internal energy transferred with matter is not in general uniquely resolvable into heat and work components, the total energy transfer cannot in general be uniquely resolved into heat and work components.&lt;ref&gt;Haase, R. (1971), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Under these conditions, the following formula can describe the process in terms of externally defined thermodynamic variables, as a statement of the first law of thermodynamics:
:&lt;math&gt;(3) \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\Delta U_0 \,=\,Q\, -\, W\, -\, \sum_{i=1}^m \Delta U_i \, \,\,\,\, \text {(suitably defined surrounding subsystems, general process, quasi-static or irreversible),}&lt;/math&gt;

where Δ''U''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the change of internal energy of the system, and {{math|Δ''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} denotes the change of internal energy of the {{math|''i''th}} of the {{math|''m''}} surrounding subsystems that are in open contact with the system, due to transfer between the system and that {{math|''i''th}} surrounding subsystem, and {{math|''Q''}} denotes the internal energy transferred as heat from the heat reservoir of the surroundings to the system, and {{math|''W''}} denotes the energy transferred from the system to the surrounding subsystems that are in adiabatic connection with it. The case of  a wall that is permeable to matter and can move so as to allow transfer of energy as work is not considered here.

====Combination of first and second laws====
If the system is described by the energetic fundamental equation, ''U''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''U''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'', ''V'', ''N&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''), and if the process can be described in the quasi-static formalism, in terms of the internal state variables of the system, then the process can also be described by a combination of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;(4) \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\mathrm d U_0 \,=\, T\, \mathrm d S\, -\, P\, \mathrm d V\, +\, \sum_{j=1}^n \mu _j \, \mathrm d N_j&lt;/math&gt;

where there are ''n'' chemical constituents of the system and permeably connected surrounding subsystems, and where ''T'', ''S'', ''P'', ''V'', ''N&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''μ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', are defined as above.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Callen|Callen, H. B.]], (1960/1985), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a general natural process, there is no immediate term-wise correspondence between equations (3) and (4), because they describe the process in different conceptual frames.

Nevertheless, a conditional correspondence exists. There are three relevant kinds of wall here: purely diathermal, adiabatic, and permeable to matter. If two of those kinds of wall are sealed off, leaving only one that permits transfers of energy, as work, as heat, or with matter, then the remaining permitted terms correspond precisely. If two of the kinds of wall are left unsealed, then energy transfer can be shared between them, so that the two remaining permitted terms do not correspond precisely.

For the special fictive case of quasi-static transfers, there is a simple correspondence.&lt;ref name="Aston Fritz account"&gt;Aston, J. G., Fritz, J. J. (1959), Chapter 9. This is an unusually explicit account of some of the physical meaning of the Gibbs formalism.&lt;/ref&gt; For this, it is supposed that the system has multiple areas of contact with its surroundings. There are pistons that allow adiabatic work, purely diathermal walls, and open connections with surrounding subsystems of completely controllable chemical potential (or equivalent controls for charged species). Then, for a suitable fictive quasi-static transfer, one can write

:&lt;math&gt;\delta Q \,=\, T\, \mathrm d S\,\text{   and    }\delta W \,=\, P\, \mathrm d V\,\, \,\,\,\, \text {(suitably defined surrounding subsystems, quasi-static transfers of energy)}.&lt;/math&gt;

For fictive quasi-static transfers for which the chemical potentials in the connected surrounding subsystems are suitably controlled, these can be put into equation (4) to yield

:&lt;math&gt;(5) \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\mathrm d U_0 \,=\, \delta Q\, -\, \delta W\, +\, \sum_{j=1}^n \mu _j \, \mathrm d N_j\, \,\,\,\,\,\, \text {(suitably defined surrounding subsystems, quasi-static transfers)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The reference &lt;ref name="Aston Fritz account"/&gt; does not actually write equation (5), but what it does write is fully compatible with it. Another helpful account is given by Tschoegl.&lt;ref&gt;Tschoegl, N. W. (2000), pp. 12–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several other accounts of this, in apparent mutual conflict.&lt;ref name="Smith 1980"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buchdahl, H. A. (1966), Section 66, pp. 121–125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Callen, J. B. (1960/1985), Section 2-1, pp. 35–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-equilibrium transfers===
The transfer of energy between an open system and a single contiguous subsystem of its surroundings is considered also in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The problem of definition arises also in this case. It may be allowed that the wall between the system and the subsystem is not only permeable to matter and to internal energy, but also may be movable so as to allow work to be done when the two systems have different pressures. In this case, the transfer of energy as heat is not defined.

Methods for study of non-equilibrium processes mostly deal with spatially continuous flow systems. In this case, the open connection between system and surroundings is usually taken to fully surround the system, so that there are no separate connections impermeable to matter but permeable to heat. Except for the special case mentioned above when there is no actual transfer of matter, which can be treated as if for a closed system, in strictly defined thermodynamic terms, it follows that transfer of energy as heat is not defined. In this sense, there is no such thing as 'heat flow' for a continuous-flow open system. Properly, for closed systems, one speaks of transfer of internal energy as heat, but in general, for open systems, one can speak safely only of transfer of internal energy. A factor here is that there are often cross-effects between distinct transfers, for example that transfer of one substance may cause transfer of another even when the latter has zero chemical potential gradient.

Usually transfer between a system and its surroundings applies to transfer of a state variable, and obeys a balance law, that the amount lost by the donor system is equal to the amount gained by the receptor system. Heat is not a state variable. For his 1947 definition of "heat transfer" for discrete open systems, the author Prigogine carefully explains at some length that his definition of it does not obey a balance law. He describes this as paradoxical.&lt;ref&gt;Prigogine, I., (1947), pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation is clarified by Gyarmati, who shows that his definition of "heat transfer", for continuous-flow systems, really refers not specifically to heat, but rather to transfer of internal energy, as follows. He considers a conceptual small cell in a situation of continuous-flow as a system defined in the so-called Lagrangian way, moving with the local center of mass. The flow of matter across the boundary is zero when considered as a flow of total mass. Nevertheless, if the material constitution is of several chemically distinct components that can diffuse with respect to one another, the system is considered to be open, the diffusive flows of the components being defined with respect to the center of mass of the system, and balancing one another as to mass transfer. Still there can be a distinction between bulk flow of internal energy and diffusive flow of internal energy in this case, because the internal energy density does not have to be constant per unit mass of material, and allowing for non-conservation of internal energy because of local conversion of kinetic energy of bulk flow to internal energy by viscosity.

Gyarmati shows that his definition of "the heat flow vector" is strictly speaking a definition of flow of internal energy, not specifically of heat, and so it turns out that his use here of the word heat is contrary to the strict thermodynamic definition of heat, though it is more or less compatible with historical custom, that often enough did not clearly distinguish between heat and internal energy; he writes "that this relation must be considered to be the exact definition of the concept of heat flow, fairly loosely used in experimental physics and heat technics."&lt;ref&gt;Gyarmati, I. (1970), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently in a different frame of thinking from that of the above-mentioned paradoxical usage in the earlier sections of the historic 1947 work by Prigogine, about discrete systems, this usage of Gyarmati is consistent with the later sections of the same 1947 work by Prigogine, about continuous-flow systems, which use the term "heat flux" in just this way. This usage is also followed by Glansdorff and Prigogine in their 1971 text about continuous-flow systems. They write: "Again the flow of internal energy may be split into a convection flow {{math|''ρu'''''v'''}} and a conduction flow. This conduction flow is by definition the heat flow {{math|'''W'''}}. Therefore: {{math|'''j'''[''U''] {{=}} ''ρu'''''v''' + '''W'''}} where {{math|''u''}} denotes the [internal] energy per unit mass. [These authors actually use the symbols {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''e''}} to denote internal energy but their notation has been changed here to accord with the notation of the present article. These authors actually use the symbol {{math|''U''}} to refer to total energy, including kinetic energy of bulk flow.]"&lt;ref&gt;Glansdorff, P, Prigogine, I, (1971), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; This usage is followed also by other writers on non-equilibrium thermodynamics such as Lebon, Jou, and Casas-Vásquez,&lt;ref&gt;Lebon, G., Jou, D., Casas-Vázquez, J. (2008), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; and de Groot and Mazur.&lt;ref&gt;de Groot, S. R., Mazur, P. (1962), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; This usage is described by Bailyn as stating the non-convective flow of internal energy, and is listed as his definition number 1, according to the first law of thermodynamics.&lt;ref name="Bailyn, M. 1994, p. 308"/&gt; This usage is also followed by workers in the kinetic theory of gases.&lt;ref&gt;de Groot, S. R., Mazur, P. (1962), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Truesdell, C., Muncaster, R. G. (1980), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Balescu, R. (1997), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; This is not the ''ad hoc'' definition of "reduced heat flux" of Haase.&lt;ref&gt;Haase, R. (1963/1969), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of a flowing system of only one chemical constituent, in the Lagrangian representation, there is no distinction between bulk flow and diffusion of matter. Moreover, the flow of matter is zero into or out of the cell that moves with the local center of mass. In effect, in this description, one is dealing with a system effectively closed to the transfer of matter. But still one can validly talk of a distinction between bulk flow and diffusive flow of internal energy, the latter driven by a temperature gradient within the flowing material, and being defined with respect to the local center of mass of the bulk flow. In this case of a virtually closed system, because of the zero matter transfer, as noted above, one can safely distinguish between transfer of energy as work, and transfer of internal energy as heat.&lt;ref&gt;Eckart, C. (1940).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]] describes the "'''Form of the Good'''", or more literally "the idea of the good" ({{lang|grc|ἡ τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ ἰδέα}}), in his [[dialogue]] the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (508e2–3), speaking through the character of [[Socrates]].  Plato introduces several forms in his works, but identifies the Form of the Good as the superlative. This form is the one that allows a philosopher-in-training to advance to a philosopher-king. It cannot be clearly seen or explained, but once it is recognized, it is the form that allows one to realize all the other forms.

==Uses in ''The Republic''==
The first references that are seen in ''The Republic'' to the Form of the Good are within the conversation between [[Glaucon]] and [[Socrates]] (454 c–d).  When trying to answer such difficult questions pertaining to the definition of [[justice]], Plato identifies that we should not "introduce every form of difference and sameness in nature" instead we must focus on "the one form of sameness and difference that was relevant to the particular ways of life themselves" which is the form of the Good.  This form is the basis for understanding all other forms, it is what allows us to understand everything else.  Through the conversation between Socrates and Glaucon (508 a–c), Plato analogizes the form of the Good with the sun as it is what allows us to see things.  Here, Plato describes how the sun allows for sight.  But he makes a very important distinction, "sun is not sight" but it is "the cause of sight itself."  As the sun is in the visible realm, the form of Good is in the [[Intelligibility (philosophy)|intelligible]] realm.  It is "what gives truth to the things known and the power to know to the knower".  It is not only the "cause of knowledge and truth, it is also an object of knowledge".
 
Plato identifies how the form of the Good allows for the cognizance to understand such difficult concepts as justice.  He identifies knowledge and truth as important, but through Socrates (508d–e) says, "good is yet more prized".  He then proceeds to explain "although the good is not being" it is "superior to it in rank and power", it is what "provides for knowledge and truth" (508e).&lt;ref name=Reeve&gt;{{cite book|last=Reeve|first=Plato ; revised by C.D.C.|title=Republic|date=1992|publisher=Hackett Publ. Co|location=Indianapolis, Ind.|isbn=978-0-87220-136-1|edition=[2nd ed.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly analysis==
Plato writes that the Form (or Idea) of the Good is the ultimate object of knowledge, although it is not knowledge itself, and from the Good, things that are just, gain their usefulness and value. Humans are compelled to pursue the good, but no one can hope to do this successfully without philosophical reasoning. According to Plato, true [[epistemology|knowledge]] is conversant, not about those material objects and imperfect intelligences which we meet within our daily interactions with all mankind, but rather it investigates the nature of those purer and more perfect patterns which are the models after which all created beings are formed. Plato supposes these perfect types to exist from all eternity and calls them the ''Forms'' or ''Ideas''.&lt;ref&gt;"Idea" from the Greek ἰδέα, often transliterated in the past but now typically translated as "character". The archaic sense must be distinguished from the modern sense meaning "thought". Cf. Russell: "It must not be supposed that 'ideas', in his sense, exist in minds, though they may be apprehended by minds.... The word 'idea' has acquired, in the course of time, many associations which are quite misleading when applied to Plato's 'ideas'. (''The Problems of Philosophy'', chapter 9).&lt;/ref&gt;  As these Forms cannot be perceived by human senses, whatever [[knowledge]] we attain of the Forms must be seen through the mind's eye (cf. ''[[Parmenides dialogue|Parmenides]]'' 132a), while ideas derived from the concrete world of flux are ultimately unsatisfactory and uncertain (see the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]''). He maintains that degree of skepticism which denies all permanent authority to the evidence of sense. In essence, Plato suggests that justice, truth, equality, beauty, and many others ultimately derive from the Form of the Good.

===Aristotle's criticism===
[[Aristotle]] discusses the Forms of Good in critical terms several times in both of his major surviving ethical works, the ''[[Eudemian Ethics|Eudemian]]'' and ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''. Aristotle argues that Plato's Form of the Good does not apply to the physical world, for Plato does not assign "goodness" to anything in the existing world.  Because Plato's Form of the Good does not explain events in the physical world, humans have no reason to believe that the Form of the Good exists and the Form of the Good is thereby irrelevant to human ethics.&lt;ref name=plat&gt;{{cite book|last=Fine|first=Gail|title=Plato on Knowledge and Forms|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-924559-2|pages=350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other criticisms===
Plato's Form of the Good is often criticized as too general.&lt;ref name=BAR&gt;{{cite book|last=Reeve|first=C.D.C.|title=Blindness and reorientation : problems in Plato's Republic|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-993443-0|pages=165, 166|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Plato's Form of the Good does not define things in the physical world that are good, and therefore lacks connectedness to reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herman|first=Arthur|title=The cave and the light : Plato versus Aristotle, and the struggle for the soul of Western civilization|date=2013|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-553-80730-1|page=46|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because Plato's Form of the Good lacks instruction, or ways for the individual to be good, Plato's Form of the Good is not applicable to human ethics since there is no defined method for which goodness can be pursued.  Through Socrates in ''The Republic'', Plato acknowledges the Form of the Good as an elusive concept and proposes that the Form of the Good be accepted as a hypothesis, rather than criticized for its weaknesses.  According to Socrates in ''The Republic'', the only alternative to accepting a hypothesis is to refute all the objections against it, which is counterproductive in the process of contemplation.&lt;ref name=BAR /&gt;

Aristotle along with other scholars sees the Form of the Good as synonymous with  the idea of One.&lt;ref name=Rev&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jordan|first=R.W.|title=Platos Idee des Guten by Rafael Ferber Review|journal=The Classical Review|date=1986|volume=36|pages=65–67|jstor=3064234|doi=10.1017/s0009840x00105001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Plato claims that Good is the highest Form, and that all objects aspire to be good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Banach|first=David|title=Plato's Theory of Forms|url=http://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/platform.htm|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since Plato does not define good things, interpreting Plato's Form of the Good through the idea of One allows scholars to explain how Plato's Form of the Good relates to the physical world. According to this philosophy, in order for an object to belong to the Form of the Good, it must be One and have the proper harmony, uniformity, and order to be in its proper form.&lt;ref name=Rev /&gt;

Philosopher Rafael Ferber dismissed Aristotle's view that the 'Good' is 'One' and wrote that the Form of the Good is self-contradictory.  Ferber claimed that Plato's Form of the Good could be simultaneously defined and unknown, and be in a state of both "being" and "not being".&lt;ref name=Rev /&gt;

Plato's Forms are also critiqued for being treated as the reason for all things, as opposed to being an essence in itself.  Some scholars also believe that Plato intended the Form to be the essence of which things come into existence.  These different interpretations of Plato's intention for the Form may be attributed to the idea that Plato did not have a systematic definition of the Form itself.&lt;ref name=plat /&gt;

==Influence==
Plato's writings on the meaning of virtue and justice permeate through the [[Western philosophy|Western philosophical]] tradition.&lt;ref name="The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2013 Edition)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Frede|first=Dorothy|title=Plato's Ethics: An Overview|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2013/entries/plato-ethics/|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Plotinus]], the founder of [[Neoplatonism]], had principles that were heavily influenced by the Good.  His concept of 'the One' is equivalent to 'the Good' because it describes an ultimate [[ontological]] truth.  'The One' is both 'self-caused' and the cause of being for everything else in the universe.  Plotinus compared his principle of 'the One' to an illuminating light, as Plato did with the Form of the Good.  As a result of Plotinus' school of [[Neoplatonism]], the bulk of understanding of [[Platonic philosophy]] until the 19th Century came through Plotinus' interpretation of it.  The early theologies of Judaism, Christianity and Islam looked to the ideas of [[Platonism]] through the lens of [[Plotinus]].&lt;ref name="Stanford1"&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plotinus/ ''Plotinus''].&lt;/ref&gt;

Amphis, a comic playwright of Athens, has one of his characters say: "And as for the good that you are likely to get on her account, I know no more about it, master, than I do of the good of Plato."&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]] 3.27&lt;/ref&gt; There is an ancient anecdotal tradition that Plato gave a public lecture entitled "On the Good" which so confused the audience that most walked out. At the end of the lecture Plato said to those hearers who remained: 'The Good is the One".&lt;ref&gt;Aristoxenus, ''Harmonics'' 30–31; see A. S. Riginos, ''Platonica'' (1976), pp. 124 ff., for further testimony.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Full depth recycling screenshot.jpg|thumb|Full Depth Reclamation]]

'''Full depth recycling''' or '''full depth reclamation''' ('''FDR'''), is a process that rebuilds worn out [[asphalt]] [[Pavement (material)|pavements]] by recycling the existing roadway.

Old asphalt and base materials are pulverized using a specialized machine called a [[reclaimer]]. On top of the pulverized material, water is added to reach the optimal moisture content for [[Soil compaction|compaction]] and then a variety of materials, such as dry [[cement]], [[Lime (mineral)|lime]], [[fly ash]], or asphalt [[emulsion]] are incorporated for [[Stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilization]]. A reclaimer is used again to mix all the materials. After shaping and [[Grade (slope)|grading]], the new base is compacted to produce a strong, durable base for either an asphalt or [[concrete]] surface.

Since this method [[recycle]]s the materials ''[[in situ]]'', there is no need to haul in [[Aggregate (composite)|aggregate]] or haul out old material for [[waste management|disposal]]. The [[vehicle]] movements are reduced and there is no need for detours since it can be done under [[traffic]], making this process more convenient for local residents.

FDR with cement saves money while preserving [[natural resource]]s by using existing materials and conserving virgin [[construction aggregate|aggregates]]. The road performance is improved through better stabilization, building a stronger, low-maintenance road that will last for many years.

With proper engineering and testing protocols the FDR process provides a design life-cycle of 30-years.  FDR is a manufacturing process and not an installation.  Other pavement materials, such as concrete, asphalt, or aggregate base go through a rigorous quality control program that meets a qualified standard prior to site delivery and contractor installation.  The FDR process requires the same level of understanding and product controls during lab testing and field verification to meet long-term performance goals.

'''Gaia philosophy''' (named after [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[goddess]] of the [[Earth]]) is a broadly inclusive term for related concepts that living organisms on a [[planet]] will affect the nature of their environment in order to make the environment more suitable for [[life]]. This set of [[Gaia hypothesis|theories]] holds that all organisms on a life-giving planet regulate the [[biosphere]] in such a way as to promote its habitability. Gaia concept draws a connection between the survivability of a species (hence its [[evolutionary]] course) and its usefulness to the survival of other species.

While there were a number of precursors to Gaia theory, the first scientific form of this idea was proposed as the [[Gaia hypothesis]] by [[James Lovelock]], a UK chemist, in 1970. The Gaia hypothesis deals with the concept of biological [[homeostasis]], and claims the resident life forms of a host planet coupled with their environment have acted and act like a single, self-regulating system. This system includes the near-surface rocks, the soil, and the atmosphere. Today many scientists consider such ideas to be unsupported by, or at odds with, the available evidence (see [[Gaia hypothesis#Recent criticism|recent criticism]]). These theories are however significant in [[green politics]].

== Predecessors to the Gaia theory ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Gaia hypothesis]] --&gt;
There are some mystical, scientific and religious predecessors to the Gaia philosophy, which had a Gaia-like conceptual basis.  Many religious mythologies had a view of Earth as being a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts (e.g. some Native American religions and various forms of [[shamanism]]).

[[Lewis Thomas]] believed that Earth should be viewed as a single cell; he derived this view from [[Johannes Kepler]]'s view of Earth as a single round organism.

[[Isaac Newton]] wrote of the earth, "Thus this Earth resembles a great animall or rather inanimate vegetable, draws in [[Aether (classical element)|æthereall]] breath for its dayly refreshment &amp; vitall ferment &amp; transpires again with gross exhalations, And according to the condition of all other things living ought to have its times of beginning youth old age &amp; perishing."&lt;ref&gt;Of Natures obvious laws &amp; processes in vegetation, [http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/newton/mss/norm/ALCH00081 Dibner MS 1031]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], a [[paleontologist]] and [[geologist]], believed that evolution unfolded from cell to organism to planet to solar system and ultimately the whole universe, as we humans see it from our limited perspective.  Teilhard later influenced [[Thomas Berry]] and many Catholic humanist thinkers of the 20th century.

[[Buckminster Fuller]] is generally credited with making the idea respectable in Western scientific circles in the 20th century.  Building to some degree on his observations and artifacts, e.g. the [[Dymaxion map]] of the Earth he created, others began to ask if there was a way to make the Gaia theory scientifically sound.

[[Oberon Zell-Ravenheart]] in 1970 in an article in ''[[Green Egg]]'' Magazine, independently articulated the Gaia Thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://original.caw.org/articles/theagenesis.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617000211/http://original.caw.org/articles/theagenesis.html |archivedate=2010-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of these ideas are considered scientific hypotheses; by definition a scientific hypothesis must make testable predictions.  As the above claims are not testable, they are outside the bounds of current science.

These are conjectures and perhaps can only be considered as social and maybe political philosophy; they may have implications for [[theology]], or ''[[thealogy]]'' as Zell-Ravenheart and [[Isaac Bonewits]] put it.

== Range of views ==

According to [[James Kirchner]] there is a spectrum of Gaia hypotheses, ranging from the undeniable to radical. At one end is the undeniable statement that the organisms on the Earth have radically altered its composition. A stronger position is that the Earth's biosphere effectively acts as if it is a self-organizing system which works in such a way as to keep its systems in some kind of equilibrium that is conducive to life.  Today many scientists consider that such a view (and any stronger views) are unlikely to be correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Waltham |first=David |authorlink=David Waltham |date=2014|title=Lucky Planet: Why Earth is Exceptional – and What that Means for Life in the Universe |url=http://www.iconbooks.com/blog/title/lucky-planet/ |location= |publisher=Icon Books |page= |isbn=9781848316560 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beerling |first=David |authorlink=David Beerling|date=2007 |title=The Emerald Planet: How plants changed Earth's history |url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780192806024.do |location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page= |isbn= 978-0-19-280602-4 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cockell |first1=Charles |authorlink1=Charles Cockell |last2=Corfield |first2=Richard |last3=Dise |first3= Nancy  |last4=Edwards |first4=Neil  |last5=Harris |first5=Nigel  |date=2008 |title= An Introduction to the Earth-Life System |url= http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/earth-and-environmental-science/palaeontology-and-life-history/introduction-earth-life-system |location=Cambridge (UK) |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] |page= |isbn= 9780521729536 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Tyrrell |first = Toby |title =Gaia: the verdict is… |journal = New Scientist |volume = 220 |pages = 30–31 |date= 26 October 2013 |doi=10.1016/s0262-4079(13)62532-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tyrrell209"&gt;{{citation |last=Tyrrell |first=Toby |authorlink= |date= 2013|title= On Gaia: A Critical Investigation of the Relationship between Life and Earth |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9959.html |location=Princeton |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |page=209 |isbn=9780691121581 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An even stronger claim is that all lifeforms are part of a single planetary being, called Gaia. In this view, the atmosphere, the seas, the terrestrial crust would be the result of interventions carried out by Gaia, through the [[coevolution|coevolving]] diversity of living organisms.

The most extreme form of Gaia theory is that the entire Earth is a single unified organism with a highly intelligent mind that arose as an [[emergent property]] of the whole biosphere. In this view, the Earth's biosphere is ''consciously'' manipulating the climate in order to make conditions more conducive to life. Scientists contend that there is no evidence at all to support this last point of view, and it has come about because many people do not understand the concept of [[homeostasis]]. Many non-scientists instinctively and incorrectly see homeostasis as a process that requires conscious control {{dubious|date=October 2014}} {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}.

The more speculative versions of Gaia, including versions in which it is believed that the Earth is actually conscious, sentient, and highly intelligent, are usually considered outside the bounds of what is usually considered science.

== Gaia in biology and science ==
{{Main|Gaia hypothesis}}

[[Buckminster Fuller]] has been credited as the first to incorporate scientific ideas into a Gaia theory, which he did with his [[Dymaxion map]] of the Earth.

The first scientifically rigorous theory was the [[Gaia hypothesis]] by [[James Lovelock]], a UK chemist.

A variant of this hypothesis was developed by [[Lynn Margulis]], a microbiologist, in 1979.
Her version is sometimes called the "Gaia Theory" (note uppercase-T). Her model is more limited in scope than the one that Lovelock proposed.

Whether this sort of system is present on Earth is still open to debate. Some relatively simple homeostatic mechanisms are generally accepted. For example, when [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] [[carbon dioxide]] levels rise, plants are able to grow better and thus remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Other biological effects and feedbacks exist,&lt;ref name="tyrrell209"/&gt; but the extent to which these mechanisms have stabilized and modified the Earth's overall climate is largely not known.

The Gaia hypothesis is sometimes viewed from significantly different philosophical perspectives. Some environmentalists view it as an almost conscious process, in which the Earth's [[ecosystem]] is literally viewed as a single unified organism. Some evolutionary biologists, on the other hand, view it as an undirected [[emergent property]] of the ecosystem: as each individual species pursues its own self-interest, their combined actions tend to have counterbalancing effects on environmental change. Proponents of this view sometimes point to examples of life's actions in the past that have resulted in dramatic change rather than stable equilibrium, such as the conversion of the Earth's atmosphere from a reducing environment to an oxygen-rich one.

Depending on how strongly the case is stated, the hypothesis conflicts with mainstream [[neo-Darwinism]]. Most biologists would accept Daisyworld-style homeostasis as possible, but would certainly not accept the idea that this equates to the whole biosphere acting as one organism.

A very small number of scientists, and a much larger number of environmental activists, claim that Earth's biosphere is ''consciously'' manipulating the climate in order to make conditions more conducive to life. Scientists contend that there is no evidence to support this belief.

== Gaia in the social sciences ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

A [[social science]] view of Gaia theory is the role of humans as a [[keystone species]] who may be able to accomplish global [[homeostasis]]. Whilst a few social scientists who draw inspiration from 'organic' views of society have embraced Gaia philosophy as a way to explain the human-nature interconnections, most professional social scientists are more involved in reflecting upon the way Gaia philosophy is used and engaged with within sub-sections of society. Alan Marshall, in the Department of Social Sciences at Mahidol University, for example, reflects upon the way Gaia philosophy has been used and advocated by environmentalists, spiritualists, managers, economists, and scientists and engineers (see The Unity of Nature, 2002, Imperial College Press: London and Singapore). Social Scientists themselves in the 1960s gave up on systems ideas of society since they were interpreted as supporting conservatism and traditionalism.

== Gaia in politics ==

Some radical political environmentalists who accept some form of the Gaia theory call themselves [[Gaian Greens|Gaians]]. They actively seek to restore the Earth's homeostasis — whenever they see it out of balance, e.g. to prevent manmade [[climate change]], [[primate]] extinction, or [[deforestation|rainforest loss]]. In effect, they seek to cooperate to become the "system consciously manipulating to make conditions more conducive to life". Such activity defines the homeostasis, but for leverage it relies on deep investigation of the homeorhetic balances, if only to find [[places to intervene in a system]] which is changing in undesirable ways.

Tony Bondhus brings up the point in his book, ''Society of Conceivia'', that if Gaia is alive, then societies are living things as well. This suggests that our understanding of Gaia can be used to create a better society and to design a better political system.

Other intellectuals in the environmental movement, like [[Edward Goldsmith]], have used Gaia in the completely opposite way; to stake a claim about how Gaia's focus on natural balance and resistance and resilience, should be emulated to design a conservative political system (as explored in Alan Marshall's 2002 book ''The Unity of Nature'', (Imperial College Press: London).

Gaians do not passively ask "what is going on", but rather, "what to do next", e.g. in [[terraforming]] or [[climate engineering]] or even on a small scale, such as [[gardening]]. Changes can be planned, agreed upon by many people, being very deliberate, as in [[urban ecology]] and especially [[industrial ecology]]. ''See [[arcology]] for more on this 'active' view.''

Gaians argue that it is a human [[duty]] to act as such - committing themselves in particular to the [[Precautionary Principle]]. Such views began to influence the [[Green Parties]], [[Greenpeace]], and a few more radical wings of the [[environmental movement]] such as the Gaia Liberation Front and the Earth Liberation Front. These views dominate some such groups, e.g. the [[Bioneers]]. Some refer to this political activity as a separate and radical branch of the [[ecology movement]], one that takes the axioms of the science of ecology in general, and Gaia theory in particular, and raises them to a kind of theory of [[personal conduct]] or [[moral code]].

== Gaia in religion ==

The ecologist and theologian Anne Primavesi is the author of two books dealing with the Gaia hypothesis and theology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westarinstitute.org/membership/westar-fellows/fellows-directory/anne-primavesi/ Anne Primavesi - Westar Institute Westar Institute&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rosemary Radford Ruether]], the American feminist scholar and theologian, wrote a book called "Gaia and God: An Ecofeminist Theology of Earth Healing".

A book edited by Allan Hunt Badiner called Dharma Gaia explores the ground where Buddhism and ecology meet through writings by the [[Dalai Lama]], [[Gary Snyder]], [[Thich Nhat Hanh]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Joanna Macy]], [[Robert Baker Aitken|Robert Aitken]], and 25 other Buddhists and ecologists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parallax.org/cgi-bin/shopper.cgi?preadd=action&amp;key=BOOKDG] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315015100/http://www.parallax.org/cgi-bin/shopper.cgi?preadd=action&amp;key=BOOKDG |date=March 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many new age authors have written books which mix [[New Age]] teachings with Gaia philosophy. This is known as [[New Age Gaian]]. Often referred to as Gaianism, or the Gaian Religion, this spiritual aspect of the philosophy is very broad and inclusive, making it adaptable to other religions: Taoism, Neo-Paganism, Pantheism, Judeo-Christian Religions, and many others.

== Semantic debate ==

The question of "what is an [[organism]]", and at what scale is it rational to speak about organisms vs. biospheres, gives rise to a semantic debate. We are all ecologies in the sense that our (human) bodies contain [[gut bacteria]], [[parasite]] species, etc., and to them our body is not organism but rather more of a [[microclimate]] or [[biome]]. Applying that thinking to whole planets:

The argument is that these symbiotic organisms, being unable to survive apart from each other and their climate and local conditions, form an organism in their own right, under a wider conception of the term organism than is conventionally used. It is a matter for often heated debate whether this is a valid usage of the term, but ultimately it appears to be a [[semantic dispute]]. In this sense of the word organism, it is argued under the theory that the entire biomass of the Earth is a single organism (as [[Johannes Kepler]] thought).

Unfortunately, many supporters of the various Gaia theories do not state exactly where they sit on this spectrum; this makes discussion and criticism difficult.

Much effort on behalf of those analyzing the theory currently is an attempt to clarify what these different hypotheses are, and whether they are proposals to 'test' or 'manipulate' outcomes. Both Lovelock's and Margulis's understanding of Gaia are considered scientific hypotheses, and like all scientific theories are constantly put to the test.

More speculative versions of Gaia, including all versions in which it is held that the Earth is actually conscious, are currently held to be outside the bounds of science, and are not supported by either Lovelock or Margulis.

=== Gaian reproduction ===

One of the most problematic issues with referring to Gaia as an organism is its apparent failure to meet the [[biological]] criterion of being able to [[reproduce]]. [[Richard Dawkins]] has asserted that the planet is not the offspring of any parents and is unable to reproduce.&lt;ref name="Harding2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=Harding, Stephan |title=Animate Earth |publisher=[[Chelsea Green Publishing]] |date=2006 |pages=65 |isbn=1-933392-29-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Igualtat de sexes.svg|thumb|upright|A generic symbol for gender equality]]
'''Gender equality''', also known as '''sexual equality''', is the state of equal ease of access to resources and opportunities regardless of gender, including economic participation and decision-making; and the state of valuing different behaviors, aspirations and needs equally, regardless of gender.

{{Quote|text=Gender equality, equality between men and women, entails the concept that all human beings, both men and women, are free to develop their personal abilities and make choices without the limitations set by stereotypes, rigid gender roles and prejudices. Gender equality means that the different behaviour, aspirations and needs of women and men are considered, valued and favoured equally. It does not mean that women and men have to become the same, but that their rights, responsibilities and opportunities will not depend on whether they are born male or female. Gender equity means fairness of treatment for women and men, according to their respective needs. This may include equal treatment or treatment that is different but which is considered equivalent in terms of rights, benefits, obligations and opportunities.|sign=ABC Of Women Worker's Rights And Gender Equality|source=ILO, 2000. p. 48.}}

Gender equality is the goal, while gender neutrality and gender equity are practices and ways of thinking that help in achieving the goal. Gender parity, which is used to measure gender balance in a given situation, can aid in achieving gender equality but is not the goal in and of itself. Gender equality is more than equal representation, it is strongly tied to [[women's rights]], and often requires policy changes. As of 2017, the global movement for gender equality has not incorporated the proposition of [[Third gender|genders besides women and men]], or [[Gender identity|gender identities]] outside of the [[gender binary]].

[[UNICEF]] says gender equality "means that women and men, and girls and boys, enjoy the same rights, resources, opportunities and protections. It does not require that girls and boys, or women and men, be the same, or that they be treated exactly alike."&lt;ref name="UNICEF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/gender/files/Overarching_2Pager_Web.pdf|title=Promoting Gender Equality: An Equity-based Approach to Programming|first=Roger|date=2011|website=Operational Guidance Overview in Brief|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=2011-01-28|author=LeMoyne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a global scale, achieving gender equality also requires eliminating harmful practices against women and girls, including [[sex trafficking]], [[femicide]], [[wartime sexual violence]], and other [[Violence against women|oppression tactics]]. [[UNFPA]] stated that, "despite many international agreements affirming their human rights, women are still much more likely than men to be poor and illiterate. They have less access to property ownership, credit, training and employment. They are far less likely than men to be politically active and far more likely to be victims of domestic violence."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/gender-equality|title=Gender equality|last=|first=|date=|website=United Nations Population Fund|publisher=UNFPA|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, gender equality is the fifth of seventeen [[Sustainable Development Goals|sustainable development goals]] of the [[United Nations]]. [[Gender inequality]] is measured annually by the [[United Nations Development Programme]]'s [[Human Development Report]]s.

== History ==
[[Christine de Pizan]], an early advocate for gender equality, states in her 1405 book ''[[The Book of the City of Ladies]]'' that the oppression of women is founded on irrational prejudice, pointing out numerous advances in society probably created by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Real Wealth of Nations: Creating a Caring Economics|author=Riane Eisler|authorlink=Riane Eisler|year=2007|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Shakers]], an evangelical group, which practiced segregation of the sexes and strict [[celibacy]], were early practitioners of gender equality. They branched off from a [[Quaker]] community in the north-west of England before emigrating to America in 1774. In America, the head of the Shakers' central ministry in 1788, Joseph Meacham, had a revelation that the sexes should be equal. He then brought [[Lucy Wright]] into the ministry as his female counterpart, and together they restructured the society to balance the rights of the sexes. Meacham and Wright established leadership teams where each elder, who dealt with the men's spiritual welfare, was partnered with an eldress, who did the same for women. Each deacon was partnered with a deaconess. Men had oversight of men; women had oversight of women. Women lived with women; men lived with men. In Shaker society, a woman did not have to be controlled or owned by any man. After Meacham's death in 1796, Wright became the head of the Shaker ministry until her death in 1821.

Shakers maintained the same pattern of gender-balanced leadership for more than 200 years. They also promoted equality by working together with other women's rights advocates. In 1859, Shaker Elder Frederick Evans stated their beliefs forcefully, writing that Shakers were "the first to disenthrall woman from the condition of vassalage to which all other religious systems (more or less) consign her, and to secure to her those just and equal rights with man that, by her similarity to him in organization and faculties, both God and nature would seem to demand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Frederick William |last=Evans |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fg2bS2pDUVMC&amp;pg=PA34 |title=Shakers: Compendium of the Origin, History, Principles, Rules and Regulations, Government, and Doctrines of the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing |place=New York |publisher=D. Appleton &amp; Co. |year=1859 |page=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans and his counterpart, Eldress Antoinette Doolittle, joined women's rights advocates on speakers' platforms throughout the northeastern U.S. in the 1870s. A visitor to the Shakers wrote in 1875:
{{Quote|Each sex works in its own appropriate sphere of action, there being a proper subordination, deference and respect of the female to the male in his order, {{em|and of the male to the female in her order}} [emphasis added], so that in any of these communities the zealous advocates of "women’s rights" may here find a practical realization of their ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Glendyne R. Wergland, ''Sisters in the Faith: Shaker Women and Equality of the Sexes'' (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Shakers were more than a radical religious sect on the fringes of American society; they put equality of the sexes into practice. It has been argued that they demonstrated that gender equality was achievable and how to achieve it.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy R. Benningfield, Appeal of the Sisterhood: The Shakers and the Woman's Rights Movement (University of Kentucky Lexington doctoral dissertation, 2004), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

In wider society, the movement towards gender equality began with the [[suffragette|suffrage movement]] in Western cultures in the late-19th century, which sought to allow women to vote and hold elected office. This period also witnessed significant changes to [[women's property rights]], particularly in relation to their marital status. (See for example, [[Married Women's Property Act 1882]].)

===Post-war era===
{{Further|Anti-discrimination laws}}
{{Further|Timeline of women's legal rights (other than voting)}}
Since [[World War II]], the [[women's liberation]] movement and [[feminism]] have created a general movement towards recognition of [[women's rights]]. The [[United Nations]] and other international agencies have adopted several conventions which promote gender equality. These conventions have not been uniformly adopted by all countries, and include:
* The [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]] was adopted in 1960, and came into force in 1962 and 1968.
* The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW) was adopted in 1979 by the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. It has been described as an international [[bill of rights]] for women, which came into force on 3 September 1981.
* The [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], a [[human rights]] declaration adopted by consensus at the [[World Conference on Human Rights]] on 25 June 1993 in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. Women's rights are addressed at para 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees | author-link = United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees | title = Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action | url = http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=topic&amp;tocid=459d17822&amp;toid=459b17a82&amp;docid=3ae6b39ec&amp;skip=O | publisher = [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] | accessdate = 14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1993.
* In 1994, the twenty-year ''Cairo Programme of Action'' was adopted at the [[International Conference on Population and Development]] (ICPD) in [[Cairo]]. This [[Non-binding resolution|non binding]] programme-of-action asserted that governments have a responsibility to meet individuals' reproductive needs, rather than demographic targets. As such, it called for [[family planning]], [[reproductive rights]] services, and strategies to promote gender equality and stop violence against women.
* Also in 1994, in the Americas, the [http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/treaties/a-61.html Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence against Women], known as the ''Convention of Belém do Pará'', called for the end of violence and discrimination against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Organization of American States | author-link = Organization of American States | title = Follow-up Mechanism to the Belém do Pará Convention (MESECVI): About the Belém do Pará Convention | publisher = [[Organization of American States]] | url = http://www.oas.org/en/mesecvi/convention.asp | accessdate = 14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At the end of the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]], the UN adopted the [[Beijing Declaration]] on 15 September 1995 - a [[United Nations General Assembly resolution|resolution]] adopted to promulgate a set of principles concerning gender equality.
* The [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325]] (UNSRC 1325), which was adopted on 31 October 2000, deals with the rights and protection of women and girls during and after [[armed conflict]]s.
* The [[Maputo Protocol]] guarantees comprehensive rights to women, including the right to take part in the political process, to social and political equality with men, to control their [[reproductive health]], and an end to [[female genital cutting|female genital mutilation]]. It was adopted by the [[African Union]] in the form of a protocol to the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] and came into force in 2005.
* The EU [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] ''Directive 2002/73/EC - equal treatment of 23 September 2002 amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions'' states that: "Harassment and sexual harassment within the meaning of this Directive shall be deemed to be discrimination on the grounds of sex and therefore prohibited."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1976L0207:20021005:EN:PDF|title=Directive 2002/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of European Communities|last=|first=|date=9 February 1976|publisher=EUR-Lex Access to European Union law|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Council of Europe]]'s [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]], the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of violence against women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Convention of Belém do Pará and the Istanbul Convention: a response to violence against women worldwide | url = https://www.oas.org/es/mesecvi/docs/CSW-SideEvent2014-Flyer-EN.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = [[Organization of American States]], [[Council of Europe]], [[Permanent Mission of France to the United Nations]] and Permanent Mission of Argentina to the United Nations | date = March 2014 }} CSW58 side event flyer 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; came into force in 2014.

Such [[legislation]] and [[affirmative action]] policies have been critical to bringing changes in societal attitudes. A 2015 Pew Research Center survey of citizens in 38 countries found that majorities in 37 of those 38 countries said that gender equality is at least "somewhat important," and a global median of 65% believe it is "very important" that women have the same rights as men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/03/08/strong-global-support-for-gender-equality-especially-among-women/|title=Strong global support for gender equality, especially among women|last=Zainulbhai|first=Hani|date=2016-03-08|website=Pew Research|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most occupations are now equally available to men and women, in many countries.{{Refn|For example, many countries now permit women to serve in the [[armed forces]], the [[police|police forces]] and to be [[fire fighter]]s – occupations traditionally reserved for men. Although these continue to have a male majority, an increasing number of women are now active, especially in directive fields such as politics, and occupy high positions in business.|group=lower-roman}}

Similarly, men are increasingly working in occupations which in previous generations had been considered [[women's work]], such as [[nursing]], [[Maid|cleaning]] and [[child care]]. In domestic situations, the role of [[Parenting]] or child rearing is more commonly shared or not as widely considered to be an exclusively female role, so that women may be free to pursue a [[career]] after [[childbirth]]. For further information, see [[Shared earning/shared parenting marriage]].

Another manifestation of the change in social attitudes is the [[Married and maiden names#Feminism and preserving one's personal name|non-automatic taking by a woman of her husband's surname on marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29804450|title=Why should women change their names on getting married?|last=Coulombeau|first=Sophie|date=1 November 2014|publisher=BBC|website=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A highly contentious issue relating to gender equality is the role of women in [[religious law|religiously orientated societies]].{{Refn|For example, [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam#Contents|the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]] declared that women have equal dignity but not equal rights, and this was accepted by many predominantly Muslim countries.|group=lower-roman}}{{Refn|In some [[Christianity|Christian churches]], the practice of [[churching of women]] may still have elements of [[ritual purification]] and the [[Ordination of women]] to the priesthood may be restricted or forbidden.|group=lower-roman}} Some Christians or Muslims believe in [[Complementarianism]], a view that holds that men and women have different but complementing roles. This view may be in opposition to the views and goals of gender equality.

In addition, there are also non-Western countries of low religiosity where the contention surrounding gender equality remains. In China, a [[Sex-selective abortion and female infanticide#Cultural preference|cultural preference for a male child]] has resulted in a [[Missing women of Asia|shortfall of women]] in the population. [[Feminism in Japan|The feminist movement in Japan]] has made many strides which resulted in Rethe [[Gender Equality Bureau]], but Japan still remains low in gender equality compared to other industrialized nations.

The notion of gender equality, and of its degree of achievement in a certain country, is very complex because there are countries that have a history of a high level of gender equality in certain areas of life but not in other areas.{{Refn|An example is [[Finland]], which has offered very high opportunities to women in public/professional life but has had a weak legal approach to the issue of [[violence against women]], with the situation in this country having been called a [[paradox]].&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Clarke | first = Kris | title = The paradoxical approach to intimate partner violence in Finland | journal = [[Tokiwa University#Publications|International Perspectives in Victimology]] | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–19 | doi = 10.5364/ipiv.6.1.19 | date = August 2011 | url = http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/83438809/paradoxical-approach-intimate-partner-violence-finland | ref = harv | postscript = .| doi-broken-date = 2018-08-27 }} [https://www.academia.edu/992154/The_Paradoxical_Approach_to_Intimate_Partner_Violence_in_Finland Available through academia.edu.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=McKie |first1=Linda |last2=Hearn |first2=Jeff |title=Gender-neutrality and gender equality: comparing and contrasting policy responses to 'domestic violence' in Finland and Scotland |journal=[[Scottish Affairs]] |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=85–107 |doi=10.3366/scot.2004.0043 |date=August 2004 |ref=harv |postscript=. }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20131021023708/http://www.scottishaffairs.org/backiss/pdfs/sa48/sa48_McKie_and_Hearn.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;"Finland is repeatedly reminded of its widespread problem of violence against women and recommended to take more efficient measures to deal with the situation. International criticism concentrates on the lack of measures to combat violence against women in general and in particular on the lack of a national action plan to combat such violence and on the lack of legislation on domestic violence. (...) Compared to Sweden, Finland has been slower to reform legislation on violence against women. In Sweden, domestic violence was already illegal in 1864, while in Finland such violence was not outlawed until 1970, over a hundred years later. In Sweden the punishment of victims of incest was abolished in 1937 but not until 1971 in Finland. Rape within marriage was criminalised in Sweden in 1962, but the equivalent Finnish legislation only came into force in 1994 — making Finland one of the last European countries to criminalise marital rape. In addition, assaults taking place on private property did not become impeachable offences in Finland until 1995.

Not all beliefs relating to gender equality have been popularly adopted.

[[Breastfeeding in public]] is now more commonly tolerated, especially in semi-private places such as restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jordan | first = Tim | title = Social Change (Sociology and society) | publisher = Blackwell|year=2002|isbn=978-0-631-23311-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender biases==
There has been criticism from some feminists towards the political discourse and policies employed in order to achieve the above items of "progress" in gender equality, with critics arguing that these gender equality strategies are superficial, in that they do not seek to challenge social structures of male domination, and only aim at improving the situation of women within the societal framework of subordination of women to men,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/966913723|title=Man's dominion : religion and the eclipse of women's rights in world politics|last=Sheila|first=Jeffreys,|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9780415596732|location=|pages=94|oclc=966913723}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that official public policies (such as state policies or international bodies policies) are questionable, as they are applied in a patriarchal context, and are directly or indirectly controlled by agents of a system which is for the most part male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=EU Gender Policy: Trapped in the 'Wollstonecraft Dilemma'?|first=Emanuela|last=Lombardo|date=1 May 2003|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|volume=10|issue=2|pages=159–180|doi=10.1177/1350506803010002003}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the criticisms of the gender equality policies, in particular, those of the [[European Union]], is that they disproportionately focus on policies integrating women in public life, but do not seek to genuinely address the deep private sphere oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/647686058|title=Multiple meanings of gender equality : a critical frame analysis of gender policies in Europe|last=Lombardo|first=Emanuela|last2=Jalušiè|first2=Vlasta|last3=Maloutas|first3=Maro Pantelidou|last4=Sauer|first4=Birgit|date=|publisher=Central European University Press Budapest|year=2007|isbn=9786155211393|editor-last=Verloo|editor-first=Mike|location=New York|pages=79–108|chapter=III.

A further criticism is that a focus on the situation of women in non-Western countries, while often ignoring the issues that exist in the West, is a form of [[imperialism]] and of reinforcing Western moral superiority; and a way of "othering" of domestic violence, by presenting it as something specific to outsiders - the "violent others" - and not to the allegedly progressive Western cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/sp/article-abstract/20/4/534/1714604/The-Othering-of-Domestic-Violence-The-EU-and|title=The Othering of Domestic Violence: The EU and Cultural Framings of Violence against Women|first1=Celeste|last1=Montoya|first2=Lise|last2=Rolandsen Agustín|date=1 December 2013|journal=Soc Polit|volume=20|issue=4|pages=534–557|via=sp.oxfordjournals.org|doi=10.1093/sp/jxt020}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics point out that women in Western countries often face similar problems, such as domestic violence and rape, as in other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/316143234|title=An introduction to feminist philosophy|last=Alison|first=Stone|date=|publisher=Polity Press|year=2008|isbn=9780745638836|location=|pages=209–211|oclc=316143234}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also cite the fact that women faced de jure legal discrimination until just a few decades ago; for instance, in some Western countries such as Switzerland, Greece, Spain, and France, women obtained equal rights in [[family law]] in the 1980s.{{Refn|In Switzerland in 1985, a referendum guaranteed women legal equality with men within marriage.&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17988450|title=Switzerland profile - Timeline|date=28 December 2016|website=Bbc.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html|title=The Long Way to Women's Right to Vote in Switzerland: a Chronology|first=Markus G.

Gender equality is part of the national curriculum in Great Britain and many other European countries. By presidential decree, the Republic of Kazakhstan created a Strategy for Gender Equality 2006–2016 to chart the subsequent decade of gender equality efforts.&lt;ref name="sgeinkz"&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategy for Gender Equality in Kazakhstan 2006–2016|url=https://www.ndi.org/files/Kazakhstan-Gender-Strategy-2006-2016.pdf|website=NDI.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Personal, Social and Health Education]], [[Religious education|religious studies]] and [[Language acquisition]] curricula tend to address gender equality issues as a very serious topic for discussion and analysis of its effect in society.

A large and growing body of research has shown how gender inequality undermines health and development. To overcome gender inequality the [[United Nations Population Fund]] states that, "Women's empowerment and gender equality requires strategic interventions at all levels of programming and policy-making. These levels include reproductive health, economic empowerment, educational empowerment and political empowerment."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/resources/engaging-men-and-boys-brief-summary-unfpa-experience-and-lessons-learned|title=Engaging Men and Boys: A Brief Summary of UNFPA Experience and Lessons Learned|last=|first=|date=2013|website=UNFPA: United Nations Population Fund|language=en|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNFPA]] says that "research has also demonstrated how working with men and boys as well as women and girls to promote gender equality contributes to achieving health and development outcomes."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

{{Further|Gender disparities in health}}
Social constructs of [[gender]] (that is, cultural ideals of socially acceptable [[masculinity]] and [[femininity]]) often have a negative effect on health. The World Health Organization cites the example of women not being allowed to travel alone outside the home (to go to the hospital), and women being prevented by cultural norms to ask their husbands to use a condom, in cultures which simultaneously encourage male promiscuity, as social norms that harm [[women's health]]. Teenage boys suffering accidents due to social expectations of impressing their peers through [[risk|risk taking]], and men dying at much higher rate from [[lung cancer]] due to [[smoking]], in cultures which link smoking to masculinity, are cited by the WHO as examples of gender norms negatively affecting [[men's health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gender/genderandhealth/en/|title=WHO: World Health Organization|website=Who.int|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Health Organization has also stated that there is a strong connection between gender socialization and transmission and lack of adequate management of [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

====Violence against women====

{{Main article|Violence against women}}
[[Violence against women]] is a technical term used to collectively refer to violent acts that are primarily or exclusively committed against women.{{Refn|Forms of violence against women include [[Sexual violence]] (including [[War Rape]], [[Marital rape]], [[Date rape]] by drugs or alcohol, and [[Child sexual abuse]], the latter often in the context of [[Child marriage]]), [[Domestic violence]], [[Forced marriage]], [[Female genital mutilation]], [[Forced prostitution]], [[Sex trafficking]], [[Honor killing]], [[Dowry killing]], [[Acid attacks]], [[Stoning]], [[Flogging]], [[Forced sterilisation]], [[Forced abortion]], violence related to accusations of witchcraft, mistreatment of widows (e.g. widow inheritance). Fighting against violence against women is considered a key issue for achieving gender equality. The Council of Europe adopted the Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention).|group=lower-roman}} This type of violence is gender-based, meaning that the acts of violence are committed against women expressly ''because'' they are women, or as a result of patriarchal gender constructs.{{Refn|The UN [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] defines violence against women as "any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life" and states that:"violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women, which have led to domination over and discrimination against women by men and to the prevention of the full advancement of women, and that violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm|title=Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women|author=|publisher=United Nations General Assembly|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} Violence and mistreatment of women in marriage has come to international attention during the past decades. This includes both violence committed inside marriage ([[domestic violence]]) as well as violence related to marriage customs and traditions (such as [[dowry]], [[bride price]], [[forced marriage]] and [[child marriage]]).

According to some theories, violence against women is often caused by the acceptance of violence by various cultural groups as a means of conflict resolution within intimate relationships. Studies on [[Intimate partner violence]] victimization among ethnic minorities in the United Studies have consistently revealed that immigrants are a high-risk group for intimate violence.&lt;ref&gt;Bachman, Ronet (January 1994).&amp;nbsp;[https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/digitization/145325ncjrs.pdf Violence Against Women: A National Crime Victimization Survey Report]&amp;nbsp;(PDF)(Report).

In countries where gang murders, armed kidnappings, civil unrest, and other similar acts are rare, the vast majority of murdered women are killed by partners/ex-partners.{{Refn|As of 2004–2009, former and current partners were responsible for more than 80% of all cases of [[femicide|murders of women]] in [[Cyprus]], [[France]], and [[Portugal]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/H-Research_Notes/SAS-Research-Note-14.pdf|title=Femicide: A Global Problem|last=|first=|date=February 2012|website=Small Arms Survey|publisher=Research Notes: Armed Violence|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} By contrast, in countries with a high level of organized criminal activity and gang violence, murders of women are more likely to occur in a public sphere, often in a general climate of indifference and impunity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, many countries do not have adequate comprehensive data collection on such murders, aggravating the problem.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In some parts of the world, various forms of violence against women are tolerated and accepted as parts of everyday life.{{Refn|According to UNFPA:&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/gender/practices.htm|title=Gender equality|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most countries, it is only in more recent decades that domestic violence against women has received significant legal attention. The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] acknowledges the long tradition of European countries of ignoring this form of violence.{{Refn|In its [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/210.htm explanatory report] at para 219, it states:
:"There are many examples from past practice in Council of Europe member states that show that exceptions to the prosecution of such cases were made, either in law or in practice, if victim and perpetrator were, for example, married to each other or had been in a relationship.

In some cultures, acts of violence against women are seen as crimes against the male 'owners' of the woman, such as husband, father or male relatives, rather the woman herself. This leads to practices where men inflict violence upon women in order to get revenge on male members of the women's family.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/publications/2012/12/unw-legislation-supplement-en%20pdf.pdf|title=Supplement to the Handbook for Legislation on Violence Against Women: Harmful Practices Against Women|last=|first=|date=2012|website=UN Women|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such practices include [[Types of rape#Payback rape|payback rape]], a form of rape specific to certain cultures, particularly the [[Pacific Islands]], which consists of the rape of a female, usually by a group of several males, as revenge for acts committed by members of her family, such as her father or brothers, with the rape being meant to humiliate the father or brothers, as punishment for their prior behavior towards the perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://waaiabulletin.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/png_activist_toolkit_16_days_2009_-_iwd_2010.pdf|title=Many Voices One Message: Stop Violence Against Women in PNG|last=|first=|date=2009–2010|website=Activist Toolkit, Amnesty International|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard A. Posner]] writes that "Traditionally, rape was the offense of depriving a father or husband of a valuable asset — his wife's chastity or his daughter's virginity".&lt;ref&gt;''Sex and Reason'', by Richard A. Posner, page 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, rape was seen in many cultures (and is still seen today in some societies) as a crime against the [[Family honor|honor of the family]], rather than against the self-determination of the woman. As a result, victims of rape may face violence, in extreme cases even honor killings, at the hands of their family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/crimesofhonour_1.shtml|title=Ethics: Honour crimes |website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13760895|title=Libya rape victims 'face honour killings'|website=BBC News|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catharine MacKinnon]] argues that in male dominated societies, sexual intercourse is imposed on women in a coercive and unequal way, creating a continuum of victimization, where women have few positive sexual experiences.{{Refn|She writes "To know what is wrong with rape, know what is right about sex. If this, in turn, is difficult, the difficulty is as instructive as the difficulty men have in telling the difference when women see one. Perhaps the wrong of rape has proved so difficult to define because the unquestionable starting point has been that rape is defined as distinct from intercourse, while for women it is difficult to distinguish the two under conditions of male dominance."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;''Toward a Feminist Theory of the State'', by Catharine A. MacKinnon, pp 174&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} Socialization within rigid gender constructs often creates an environment where sexual violence is common.{{Refn|According to the World Health Organization: "Sexual violence is also more likely to occur where beliefs in male sexual entitlement are strong, where gender roles are more rigid, and in countries experiencing high rates of other types of violence."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/summary_en.pdf|title=World report on violence and health: summary|website=World Health Organization|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} One of the challenges of dealing with sexual violence is that in many societies women are perceived as being readily available for sex, and men are seen as entitled to their bodies, until and unless women object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/32000/ior530012011en.pdf|title=Rape and Sexual Violence: Human rights law and standards in the international criminal court|last=|first=|date=1 March 2011|website=Amnesty International|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/64000/eur270022007en.pdf|title=Hungary: Cries Unheard: The Failure To Protect Women From Rape And Sexual Violence In The Home|publisher=Amnesty International|date=2007|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|Rebecca Cook wrote in ''Submission of Interights to the European Court of Human Rights in the case of [[M.C. v.

The importance of women having the right and possibility to have control over their body, reproduction decisions, and sexuality, and the need for gender equality in order to achieve these goals are recognized as crucial by the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in Beijing and the UN [[International Conference on Population and Development]] Program of Action. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that promotion of gender equality is crucial in the fight against [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gender/hiv_aids/en/|title=WHO: World Health Organization|website=Who.int|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maternal mortality]] is a major problem in many parts of the world. [[UNFPA]] states that countries have an obligation to protect women's right to health, but many countries do not do that.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/reducing_mm.pdf|title=Reducing Maternal Mortality: The contribution of the right to the highest attainable standard of health|last=Hunt|first=Paul|last2=Mezquita de Bueno|first2=Julia|publisher=University of Essex|year=2010|isbn=|location=United Nations Population Fund|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maternal mortality is considered today not just an issue of development but also an issue of [[human rights]].{{Refn|[[UNFPA]] says that, "since 1990, the world has seen a 45 per cent decline in maternal mortality – an enormous achievement. But in spite of these gains, almost 800 women still die every day from causes related to pregnancy or childbirth. This is about one woman every two minutes."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/maternal-health|title=Maternal health: UNFPA – United Nations Population Fund|website=Unfpa.org|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to UNFPA:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

:"Preventable maternal mortality occurs where there is a failure to give effect to the rights of women to health, equality, and non-discrimination. Preventable maternal mortality also often represents a violation of a woman’s right to life."|group=lower-roman}}

The right to reproductive and sexual autonomy is denied to women in many parts of the world, through practices such as [[forced sterilization]], forced/coerced sexual partnering (e.g. [[forced marriage]], [[child marriage]]), criminalization of consensual sexual acts (such as [[sex outside marriage]]), lack of criminalization of [[marital rape]], violence in regard to the choice of partner ([[honor killings]] as punishment for 'inappropriate' relations).{{Refn|Amnesty International’s Secretary General has stated that: "It is unbelievable that in the twenty-first century some countries are condoning child marriage and marital rape while others are outlawing abortion, sex outside marriage and same-sex sexual activity – even punishable by death."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/sexual-and-reproductive-rights-under-threat-worldwide-2014-03-06|title=Sexual and reproductive rights under threat worldwide|publisher=Amnesty International|date=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} The sexual health of women is often poor in societies where a woman's right to control her sexuality is not recognized.{{Refn|High Commissioner for Human Rights [[Navi Pillay]] has called for full respect and recognition of women's autonomy and sexual and reproductive health rights, stating:

:"Violations of women's human rights are often linked to their sexuality and reproductive role. Women are frequently treated as property, they are sold into marriage, into trafficking, into sexual slavery. Violence against women frequently takes the form of sexual violence. Victims of such violence are often accused of promiscuity and held responsible for their fate, while infertile women are rejected by husbands, families, and communities. In many countries, married women may not refuse to have sexual relations with their husbands, and often have no say in whether they use contraception."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chr.up.ac.za/images/files/news/news_2012/Navi%20Pillay%20Lecture%2015%20May%202012.pdf|title=Valuing Women as Autonomous Beings: Women's sexual and reproductive rights|last=Pillay|first=Navi|date=May 15, 2012|website=University of Pretoria, Centre for Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolescent]] girls have the highest risk of sexual coercion, sexual ill health, and negative reproductive outcomes. The risks they face are higher than those of boys and men; this increased risk is partly due to gender inequity (different socialization of boys and girls, gender based violence, child marriage) and partly due to biological factors.{{Refn|Females' risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections during unprotected sexual relations is two to four times that of males'.&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/resources/giving-special-attention-girls-and-adolescents|title=Giving Special Attention to Girls and Adolescents|website=Unfpa.org|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}

[[Family planning]] is the practice of freely deciding the number of children one has and the intervals between their births, particularly by means of contraception or voluntary sterilization. Abortion is the induced termination of pregnancy. [[Abortion law]]s vary significantly by country. The availability of contraception, sterilization and abortion is dependent on laws, as well as social, cultural and religious norms. Some countries have liberal laws regarding these issues, but in practice it is very difficult to access such services due to doctors, pharmacists and other social and medical workers being [[conscientious objector]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/italian-gynaecologists-refuse-abortions-miscarriages|title=Seven in 10 Italian gynaecologists refuse to carry out abortions|first1=Stephanie Kirchgaessner Pamela|last1=Duncan|first2=Alberto|last2=Nardelli|first3=Delphine|last3=Robineau|date=11 March 2016|website=Theguardian.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/doctors-refusal-to-perform-abortions-divides-croatia-02-13-2017|title=Doctors' Refusal to Perform Abortions Divides Croatia |website=Balkan Insight |accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family planning is particularly important from a women's rights perspective, as having very many pregnancies, especially in areas where malnutrition is present, can seriously endanger women's health. UNFA writes that "Family planning is central to gender equality and women’s empowerment, and it is a key factor in reducing poverty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/family-planning|title=Family planning: UNFPA – United Nations Population Fund|website=Unfpa.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Family planning is often opposed by governments who have strong [[natalist]] policies. During the 20th century, such examples have included the aggressive natalist policies from [[communist Romania]] and [[communist Albania]]. State mandated [[forced marriage]] was also practiced by some authoritarian governments as a way to meet population targets: the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime in [[Cambodia]] systematically forced people into marriages, in order to increase the population and continue the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.dccam.org/Abouts/Intern/Natalae_Forced_marriage.pdf |format=PDF|author=Natalae Anderson|title=Documentation Center of Cambodia, ''Memorandum: Charging Forced Marriage as a Crime Against Humanity,''|date=September 22, 2010|website=D.dccam.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the [[one child policy]] of China (1979–2015) included punishments for families with more than one child and [[forced abortion]]s. Some governments have sought to prevent certain ethnic or social groups from reproduction. Such policies were carried out against ethnic minorities in Europe and North America in the 20th century, and more recently in Latin America against the Indigenous population in the 1990s; in [[Peru]], President [[Alberto Fujimori]] (in office from 1990 to 2000) has been accused of [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]] as a result of a sterilization program put in place by his administration targeting indigenous people (mainly the [[Quechua people|Quechuas]] and the [[Aymara people|Aymaras]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2148793.stm|title=Mass sterilisation scandal shocks Peru|date=24 July 2002|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Harmful traditional practices" refer to forms of violence which are committed in certain communities often enough to become cultural practice, and accepted for that reason. Young women are the main victims of such acts, although men can be affected.&lt;ref name="NHS Traditional"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gbv.scot.nhs.uk/gbv/harmful-traditional-practices|title=National Gender Based Violence &amp; Health Programme|website=Gbv.scot.nhs.uk|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They occur in an environment where women and girls have unequal rights and opportunities.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/FactSheet23en.pdf|format=PDF|title=Fact Sheet No.23, Harmful Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children|website=Ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These practices include, according to the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]]:&lt;ref name="ohchr.org" /&gt;

{{Quote|[[female genital mutilation]] (FGM); forced feeding of women; early marriage; the various taboos or practices which prevent women from controlling their own fertility; nutritional taboos and traditional birth practices; son preference and its implications for the status of the girl child; female infanticide; early pregnancy; and dowry price}}

Son preference refers to a cultural preference for sons over daughters, and manifests itself through practices such as sex selective abortion; female infanticide; or abandonment, neglect or abuse of girl-children.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org" /&gt;

Abuses regarding nutrition are taboos in regard to certain foods, which result in poor nutrition of women, and may endanger their health, especially if pregnant.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org" /&gt;

The [[caste system in India]] which leads to [[untouchability]] (the practice of ostracizing a group by segregating them from the mainstream society) often interacts with gender discrimination, leading to a double discrimination faced by [[Dalit]] women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/ngos/chrgj-hrw.pdf|format=PDF|title=CASTE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST DALITS OR SO-CALLED UNTOUCHABLES IN INDIA|website=2.ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 survey, 27% of Indians admitted to practicing untouchability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/one-in-four-indians-admit-to-practising-untouchability-biggest-caste-survey/|title=Biggest caste survey: One in four Indians admit to practising untouchability|date=29 November 2014|newspaper=[[The Indian Express]]|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional customs regarding birth sometimes endanger the mothers. Births in parts of Africa are often attended by traditional birth attendants (TBAs), who sometimes perform rituals that are dangerous to the health of the mother. In many societies, a difficult labour is believed to be a divine punishment for marital infidelity, and such women face abuse and are pressured to "confess" to the infidelity.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org" /&gt;

Tribal traditions can be harmful to males; for instance, the [[Satere-Mawe]] tribe use [[bullet ant]]s as an [[initiation rite]]. Men must wear gloves with hundreds of bullet ants woven in for ten minutes: the ants' stings cause severe pain and paralysis. This experience must be completed twenty times for boys to be considered "warriors".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/travel/Holidays/Wildlife/article77936.ece|title=Bitten by the Amazon|last=Backshall|first=Steve|date=6 January 2008|publisher=The Sunday Times|location=London|accessdate=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Female genital mutilation=====
[[File:Campaign_road_sign_against_female_genital_mutilation_(cropped)_2.jpg|thumb|left|Road sign near [[Kapchorwa]], [[Uganda]], 2004]]
[[UNFPA]] and [[UNICEF]] regard the practice of [[female genital mutilation]] as "a manifestation of deeply entrenched gender inequality. It persists for many reasons. In some societies, for example, it is considered a rite of passage. In others, it is seen as a prerequisite for marriage. In some communities – whether Christian, Jewish, Muslim – the practice may even be attributed to religious beliefs." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/female-genital-mutilation|title=Female genital mutilation: UNFPA – United Nations Population Fund|website=Unfpa.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 125 million women and girls living today have undergone FGM in the 29 countries where data exist. Of these, about half live in Egypt and Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/publications/unfpa-unicef-joint-programme-female-genital-mutilationcutting-accelerating-change|title=UNFPA-UNICEF Joint Programme on Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: Accelerating Change|website=Unfpa.org|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most commonly carried out on girls between infancy and 15 years old.&lt;ref name="NHS Traditional" /&gt;

=====Forced marriage=====
[[File:Girl Summit - 22nd July in London (14498368279).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Poster against child and forced marriage]]
{{Main|Forced marriage}}
Early marriage, child marriage or [[forced marriage]] is prevalent in parts of Asia and Africa. The majority of victims seeking advice are female and aged between 18 and 23.&lt;ref name="NHS Traditional" /&gt; Such marriages can have harmful effects on a girl's education and development, and may expose girls to social isolation or abuse.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/protection/57929_58008.html|title=Child marriage|date=22 October 2014|website=UNICEF|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/topic/womens-rights/child-marriage|title=Child Marriage|website=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 UN Resolution on Child, Early and Forced Marriage calls for an end to the practice, and states that "Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage is a harmful practice that violates abuses, or impairs human rights and is linked to and perpetuates other harmful practices and human rights violations, that these violations have a disproportionately negative impact on women and girls [...]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/events/2014/child_marriage.pdf?ua=1|format=PDF|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly : 69/XX. Child, Early and Forced Marriage|website=Who.int|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a near-universal commitment by governments to end child marriage, "one in three girls in developing countries (excluding China) will probably be married before they are 18."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/end-child-marriage|title=End Child Marriage|website = UNFPA – United Nations Population Fund|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNFPA]] states that, "over 67 million women 20–24 year old in 2010 had been married as girls. Half were in Asia, one-fifth in Africa. In the next decade 14.2 million girls under 18 will be married every year; this translates into 39,000 girls married each day. This will rise to an average of 15.1 million girls a year, starting in 2021 until 2030, if present trends continue."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org2" /&gt;

=====Bride price=====
{{Main|Bride price}}
[[Bride price]] (also called bridewealth or bride token) is money, property, or other form of wealth paid by a groom or his family to the parents of the bride. This custom often leads to women having reduced ability to control their fertility. For instance, in northern Ghana, the payment of bride price signifies a woman's requirement to bear children, and women using birth control face threats, violence and reprisals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/councilarticles/sfp/SFP301Bawah.pdf|format=PDF|title=Women's Fears and Men's Anxieties : The Impact of Family Planning on Gender Relations in Northern Ghana|website=Popcouncil.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The custom of bride price has been criticized as contributing to the mistreatment of women in marriage, and preventing them from leaving abusive marriages. [[UN Women]] recommended its abolition, and stated that: "Legislation should [...] State that divorce shall not be contingent upon the return of bride price but such provisions shall not be interpreted to limit women’s right to divorce; State that a perpetrator of [[domestic violence]], including marital rape, cannot use the fact that he paid bride price as a defence to a domestic violence charge."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The custom of bride price can also curtail the free movement of women: if a wife wants to leave her husband, he may demand back the bride price that he had paid to the woman's family; and the woman's family often cannot or does not want to pay it back, making it difficult for women to move out of violent husbands' homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equality Now (2007) Protecting the girl child: Using the law to end child, early and forced marriage and related human rights violations|url=http://www.equalitynow.org/sites/default/files/Protecting_the_Girl_Child.pdf|format=PDF|website=Equalitynow.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lelieveld, M.|date=2011|title=Child protection in the Somali region of Ethiopia.

[[Gender-based price discrimination]] involves companies selling almost identical units of the same product or service at comparatively different prices, as determined by the target market. Studies have found that women pay about $1,400 a year more than men due to gendered discriminatory pricing. Although the "pink tax" of different goods and services is not uniform, overall women pay more for commodities that result in visual evidence of feminine body image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Grauerholz|first2=Liz|last3=Weichsel|first3=Rebecca|last4=Guittar|first4=Nicholas A.|year=2011|title=The Cost of Doing Femininity: Gendered Disparities in Pricing of Personal Care Products and Services|journal=Gender Issues|volume=28|issue=4|pages=175–191|doi=10.1007/s12147-011-9106-3|first1=Megan|last1=Duesterhaus}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|For example, studies have shown that women are charged more for services especially tailoring, hair cutting and laundering.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;|group=lower-roman}}

====Gendered arrangements of work and care====
{{Main article|Women's work|Gender role}}
Since the 1950s, social scientists as well as feminists have increasingly criticized gendered arrangements of work and care and the male breadwinner role.

Western countries with a strong emphasis on women fulfilling the role of homemakers, rather than a professional role, include parts of German speaking Europe (i.e. parts of Germany, Austria and Switzerland); as well as the Netherlands and Ireland.{{Refn|In 2011, [[Jose Manuel Barroso]], then president of the [[European Commission]], stated "Germany, but also Austria and the Netherlands, should look at the example of the northern countries [...] that means removing obstacles for women, older workers, foreigners and low-skilled job-seekers to get into the workforce".&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-persistently-low-birthrate-gets-marginal-boost/a-15325123-0|title=Germany's persistently low birthrate gets marginal boost |date=18 August 2011 |website=Deutsche Welle |accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}{{Refn|The Netherlands and Ireland are among the last Western countries to accept women as professionals; despite the Netherlands having an image as progressive on gender issues, women in the Netherlands work less in paid employment than women in other comparable Western countries.

{{Further|Freedom of movement}}
The degree to which women can participate (in law and in practice) in public life varies by culture and socioeconomic characteristics. [[Seclusion]] of women within the home was a common practice among the [[upper classes]] of many societies, and this still remains the case today in some societies.

Women's [[freedom of movement]] continues to be legally restricted in some parts of the world. This restriction is often due to [[marriage laws]].{{Refn|For instance, in [[Yemen]], marriage regulations stipulate that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission.&lt;ref name="www2.ohchr.org" group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/Yemen%27s%20darkside-discrimination_Yemen_HRC101.pdf|title=Yemen's Dark Side: Discrimination and violence against women and girls.|website=2.ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} In some countries, women must legally be accompanied by their male guardians (such as the husband or male relative) when they leave home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/24691034|title=Why can't women drive in Saudi Arabia?|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 June 2015|date = 27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) states at Article 15 (4) that:

In addition to laws, women's freedom of movement is also restricted by social and religious norms.{{Refn|For example, [[purdah]], a religious and social practice of female seclusion prevalent among some Muslim communities in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]] as well as upper-caste Hindus in [[North India|Northern India]], such as the [[Rajputs]], which often leads to the minimizing of the movement of women in public spaces and restrictions on their social and professional interactions;&lt;ref name=Papanek group=upper-roman&gt;Papanek, Hanna.

====Girls' access to education====
[[File:Girls lining up for class - Flickr - Al Jazeera English.jpg|thumb|School girls in [[Gaza Strip]]]]
{{Main article|Female education|Gender and education}}
In many parts of the world, girls' access to education is very restricted. In developing parts of the world women are often denied opportunities for education as girls and women face many obstacles. These include: early and forced marriages; early pregnancy; prejudice based on gender stereotypes at home, at school and in the community; violence on the way to school, or in and around schools; long distances to schools; vulnerability to the HIV epidemic; school fees, which often lead to parents sending only their sons to school; lack of gender sensitive approaches and materials in classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/12978|title=Global issues affecting women and girls |website=National Union of Teachers|accessdate=14 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429020903/http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/12978|archivedate=29 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignforeducationusa.org/obstacles-to-education-for-girls-and-women|title=Global Campaign For Education United States Chapter|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plan-international.org/files/Africa/progress-and-obstacles-to-girls-education-in-africa|title=Progress and Obstacles to Girls' Education in Africa|website=Plan International|date = 16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[OHCHR]], there have been multiple attacks on schools worldwide during the period 2009–2014 with "a number of these attacks being specifically directed at girls, parents and teachers advocating for gender equality in education".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15555&amp;LangID=E|title=Attacks against girls' education occurring with "increasing regularity" – UN human rights report|last=|first=|date=9 February 2015|website=Ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Population Fund]] says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/gender-equality|title=Gender equality|website=[[United Nations Population Fund]]|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|About two thirds of the world's [[Literacy#Gender disparities|illiterate]] adults are women. Lack of an education severely restricts a woman's access to information and opportunities. Conversely, increasing women's and girls' educational attainment benefits both individuals and future generations. Higher levels of women's education are strongly associated with lower infant mortality and lower fertility, as well as better outcomes for their children.}}

====Marriage, divorce and property laws and regulations====
Equal rights for women in marriage, divorce, and property/land ownership and inheritance are essential for gender equality.

The legal and social treatment of married women has been often discussed as a political issue from the 19th century onwards.{{Refn|[[John Stuart Mill]], in ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'' (1869) compared marriage to [[slavery]] and wrote that: "The law of servitude in marriage is a monstrous contradiction to all the principles of the modern world, and to all the experience through which those principles have been slowly and painfully worked out."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mill-john-stuart/1869/subjection-women/ch04.htm|title=The Subjection of Women by John Stuart Mill|website=Marxists.org|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}{{Refn|In 1957, James Everett, then Minister for Justice in Ireland, stated: "The progress of organised society is judged by the status occupied by married women".&lt;ref name=Oireachtas group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web |url= http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad1957011600008?opendocument |title= Married Women's Status Bill, 1956—Second Stage: Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett) |website= [[Houses of the Oireachtas|Oireachtas]] |date= 16 January 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} Until the 1970s, legal subordination of married women was common across European countries, through [[marriage laws]] giving legal authority to the husband, as well as through [[marriage bar]]s.{{Refn|In France, married women obtained the right to work without their husband's consent in 1965;&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/explore/cmcf-vsi-women-in-france.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092212/http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/explore/cmcf-vsi-women-in-france.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the paternal authority of a man over his family was ended in 1970 (before that parental responsibilities belonged solely to the father who made all legal decisions concerning the children); and a new reform in 1985 abolished the stipulation that the father had the sole power to administer the children's property.&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceflonline.net/wp-content/uploads/France-Parental-Responsibilities.pdf|title=National Report: France|website=Ceflonline.net|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}{{Refn|In [[Austria]], the marriage law was overhauled between 1975 and 1983, abolishing the restrictions on married women's right to work outside the home, providing for equality between spouses, and for joint ownership of property and assets.&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;''Women and Politics in Contemporary Ireland: From the Margins to the Mainstream'', by Yvonne Galligan, pp.90&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} In 1978, the [[Council of Europe]] passed the ''Resolution (78) 37 on equality of spouses in civil law''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RESOLUTION   (78)  37 ON   EQUALITY   OF   SPOUSES  IN   CIVIL   LAW|url=https://wcd.coe.int/com.instranet.InstraServlet?command=com.instranet.CmdBlobGet&amp;InstranetImage=596422&amp;SecMode=1&amp;DocId=662346&amp;Usage=2|publisher=Council of Europe|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121025014/https://wcd.coe.int/com.instranet.InstraServlet?command=com.instranet.CmdBlobGet&amp;InstranetImage=596422&amp;SecMode=1&amp;DocId=662346&amp;Usage=2|archivedate=21 January 2016|date=27  September  1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Switzerland]] was one of the last countries in Europe to establish gender equality in marriage, in this country married women's rights were severely restricted until 1988, when legal reforms providing for gender equality in marriage, abolishing the legal authority of the husband, come into force (these reforms had been approved in 1985 by voters in a [[Voting in Switzerland|referendum]], who narrowly voted in favor with 54.7% of voters approving).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/23/world/swiss-grant-women-equal-marriage-rights.html|title=SWISS GRANT WOMEN EQUAL MARRIAGE RIGHTS|date=23 September 1985|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17988450|title=Switzerland Profile: Timeline|website=BBC News|date = 21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html|title=The Long Way to Women's Right to Vote in Switzerland: a Chronology|author=Markus G.

There have been and sometimes continue to be unequal treatment of married women in various aspects of everyday life.

Two recent movements in countries with large Kurdish populations have implemented political gender equality.

Party offices are also led by a man and a woman. Local councils were formed, which also had to be co-presided over by a man and a woman together.

A movement in northern Syria, also Kurdish, has been led by the [[Democratic Union Party (Syria)|Democratic Union Party]] (PYD).&lt;ref name=Mogelson&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/06/dark-victory-in-raqqa|title=Dark Victory in Raqqa|last=Mogelson|first=Luke|date=2017-10-30|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-01-23|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In northern Syria all villages, towns and cities governed by the PYD were co-governed by a man and a woman. Local councils were formed where each sex had to have 40% representation, and minorities also had to be represented.&lt;ref name=Mogelson /&gt;

====Gender stereotypes====

{{See|Gender role}}
Gender [[stereotype]]s arise from the socially approved roles of women and men in the private or public sphere, at home or in the workplace. In the household, women are typically seen as mother figures, which usually places them into a typical classification of being "supportive" or "nurturing". Women are expected to want to take on the role of a mother and take on primary responsibility for household needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women Voices and Feminist Visions|last=Shaw and Lee|first=Susan and Janet|year=|isbn=|location=|page=450|quote="Women are expected to want to be mothers"|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their male counterparts are seen as being "assertive" or "ambitious" as men are usually seen in the workplace or as the primary breadwinner for his family.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geteverwise.com/human-resources/how-does-gender-bias-really-affect-women-in-the-workplace/|title=How Does Gender Bias Really Affect Women in the Workplace?|date=2016-03-24|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these views and expectations, women often face discrimination in the public sphere, such as the workplace.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

A [[gender role]] is a set of societal [[norm (social)|norms]] dictating the types of behaviors which are generally considered acceptable, appropriate, or desirable for people based on their sex. Gender roles are usually centered on conceptions of [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]], although there are [[Third gender|exceptions]] and [[genderqueer|variations]].

====Portrayal of women in the media====
{{Main article|Exploitation of women in mass media}}
The way women are represented in the media has been criticized as perpetuating negative gender stereotypes. The [[exploitation of women in mass media]] refers to the criticisms that are levied against the use or objectification of women in the [[mass media]], when such use or portrayal aims at increasing the appeal of media or a product, to the detriment of, or without regard to, the interests of the women portrayed, or women in general. Concerns include the fact that all forms of media have the power to shape the population's perceptions and portray images of unrealistic stereotypical perceptions by portraying women either as submissive housewives or as sex objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/etudes/join/2013/474442/IPOL-FEMM_ET%282013%29474442_EN.pdf|format=PDF|title=Women and Girls as Subjects of Media's Attention and Advertisement Campaigns : The Situation in Europe, Best Practices and Legislations|website=Europarl.europa.eu|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media emphasizes traditional domestic or sexual roles that normalize violence against women. The vast array of studies that have been conducted on the issue of the portrayal of women in the media have shown that women are often portrayed as irrational, fragile, not intelligent, submissive and
subservient to men.&lt;ref name="Acevedo 2010"&gt;Acevedo et all. 2010. 'A Content Analysis of the Roles Portrayed by Women in Commercials: 1973 – 2008', Revista Brasileira de Marketing Vol. 9. Universidade Nove de Julho, Sao Paulo.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that stereotyped images such as these have been shown to negatively impact on the mental health of many female viewers who feel bound by these roles, causing amongst other problems, self-esteem issues, depression and anxiety.&lt;ref name="Acevedo 2010"/&gt;

According to a study, the way women are often portrayed by the media can lead to:  "Women of average or normal appearance feeling inadequate or less beautiful in comparison to the overwhelming use of extraordinarily attractive women"; "Increase in the likelihood and acceptance of sexual violence"; "Unrealistic expectations by men of how women should look or behave"; "Psychological disorders such as body dysmorphic disorder, anorexia, bulimia and so on"; "The importance of physical appearance is emphasized and reinforced early in most girls' development." Studies have found that nearly half of females ages 6–8 have stated they want to be slimmer. (Striegel-Moore &amp; Franko, 2002)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=...&amp;detail=4475&amp;content=4795|title=The Myriad: Westminster's Interactive Academic Journal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428172944/http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=...&amp;detail=4475&amp;content=4795|archivedate=2016-04-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gretchen-kelly/the-thing-all-women-do-you-dont-know-about_b_8630416.html|title=The Thing All Women Do That You Don't Know About|author=Gretchen Kelly|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=November 23, 2015|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Informing women of their rights====
While in many countries, the problem lies in the lack of adequate legislation, in others the principal problem is not as much the lack of a legal framework, but the fact is that most women do not know their legal rights. This is especially the case as many of the laws dealing with women's rights are of recent date. This lack of knowledge enables to abusers to lead the victims (explicitly or implicitly) to believe that their abuse is within their rights. This may apply to a wide range of abuses, ranging from domestic violence to employment discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/law-crime-and-justice/criminal-justice/bc-criminal-justice-system/if-victim/publications/hsh-english-domestic-violence.pdf|format=PDF|title=Help is available if you or someone you know is a victim of Domestic Violence|website=2.gov.bc.ca|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maternityaction.org.uk/2015/01/know-your-rights-get-your-rights/|title=Know your rights – get your rights!|website=Maternityaction.org.uk|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations Development Programme states that, in order to advance gender justice, "Women must know their rights and be able to access legal systems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/ourwork/crisispreventionandrecovery/focus_areas/gender_equality_andwomensempowerment/eight_point_agendaforwomensempowermentandgenderequality.html|title=Eight Point Agenda for Women's Empowerment and Gender Equality|website=Undp.org|accessdate=14 November 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509195554/http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/ourwork/crisispreventionandrecovery/focus_areas/gender_equality_andwomensempowerment/eight_point_agendaforwomensempowermentandgenderequality.html|archivedate=9 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1993 UN [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] states at Art. 4 (d) [...] "States should also inform women of their rights in seeking redress through such mechanisms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm|title=A/RES/48/104 – Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women – UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements|first=United Nations General|last=Assembly|website=Un-documents.net|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enacting protective legislation against violence has little effect, if women do not know how to use it: for example a study of Bedouin women in Israel found that 60% did not know what a [[restraining order]] was;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/study-most-bedouin-victims-of-domestic-violence-believe-it-s-a-decree-from-god-1.427190|title=Study: Most Bedouin Victims of Domestic Violence Believe It's a 'Decree From God'|first=Jack|last=Khoury|date=30 April 2012|website=Haaretz.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or if they don't know what acts are illegal: a report by Amnesty International showed in Hungary, in a public opinion poll of nearly 1,200 people in 2006, a total of 62% did not know that marital rape was an illegal (it was outlawed in 1997) and therefore the crime was rarely reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/465bfa162.pdf|format=PDF|title=Hungary : Cries unheard : The failure to protect women from rape and sexual violence in the home|website=Refworld.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6643727.stm|title=Hungary law 'fails rape victims'|date = 10 May 2007 |work=[[BBC]]|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ensuring women have a minim understanding of health issues is also important: lack of access to reliable medical information and available medical procedures to which they are entitled hurts [[women's health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/gender/women_health_report/full_report_20091104_en.pdf|format=PDF|title=Women and health : today's evidence tomorrow's agenda|website=Who.int|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender mainstreaming====
{{Main article|Gender mainstreaming}}
Gender mainstreaming is described as the [[public policy]] of assessing the different implications for women and men of any planned [[policy]] action, including [[legislation]] and [[Program (management)|programmes]], in all areas and levels, with the aim of achieving gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, C. and Bennett, (2002) "Gender Mainstreaming in the European Union", ''European Journal of Women's Studies'' 9 (4): 430–46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/gender/newsite2002/about/defin.htm|title=Definition of Gender Mainstreaming|website=International Labor Organization|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of gender mainstreaming was first proposed at the 1985 Third World Conference on Women in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]. The idea has been developed in the [[United Nations]] development community.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20010708124202/http://www.jeanmonnetprogram.org/papers/00/000201-03.html II. The Origins of Gender Mainstreaming in the EU]", ''[http://www.jeanmonnetprogram.org/ Academy of European Law online]''&lt;/ref&gt; Gender mainstreaming "involves ensuring that gender perspectives and attention to the goal of gender equality are central to all activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/gendermainstreaming.htm|title=Gender Mainstreaming|website=UN Women|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Council of Europe definition: "Gender mainstreaming is the (re)organization, improvement, development and evaluation of policy processes, so that a gender equality perspective is incorporated in all policies at all levels and at all stages, by the actors normally involved in policy-making."&lt;ref name="coe.int"/&gt;

An integrated gender mainstreaming approach is "the attempt to form alliances and common platforms that bring together the power of faith and gender-equality aspirations to advance human rights."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/publications/gender-heart-icpd|title=Gender at the Heart of ICPD: The UNFPA Strategic Framework on Gender Mainstreaming and Women's Empowerment |website=United Nations Population Fund|date = 2011|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "in Azerbaijan, [[UNFPA]] conducted a study on gender equality by comparing the text of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women with some widely recognized Islamic references and resources. The results reflect the parallels between the Convention and many tenets of Islamic scripture and practice. The study showcased specific issues, including VAW, child marriage, respect for the dignity of women, and equality in the economic and political participation of women. The study was later used to produce training materials geared towards sensitizing religious leaders."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org3"/&gt;

[[Martin Heidegger]], the [[20th century philosophy|20th-century]] [[List of German-language philosophers|German philosopher]], produced a large body of work that intended a profound change of direction for [[philosophy]]. Such was the depth of change that he found it necessary to introduce a large number of [[neologisms]], often connected to idiomatic words and phrases in the German language.

Two of his most basic neologisms, '''present-at-hand''' and '''ready-to-hand''', are used to describe various attitudes toward things in the world. For Heidegger, such "attitudes" are prior to, i.e. more basic than, the various sciences of the individual items in the world. Science itself is an attitude, one that attempts a kind of neutral investigation. Other related terms are also explained below.

Heidegger's overall analysis is quite involved, taking in a lot of the history of philosophy. See ''[[Being and Time]]'' for a description of his overall project, and to give some context to these technical terms.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''Being and Time'', trans. John Macquarrie and Edward Robinson. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1962, H.67–72&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terms ==

===''Aletheia''===
:([[Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: ἀλήθεια)
{{Main|Aletheia}}

Heidegger's idea of ''[[aletheia]]'', or [[world disclosure|disclosure]] (''Erschlossenheit''), was an attempt to make sense of how things in the world appear to human beings as part of an opening in intelligibility, as "unclosedness" or "unconcealedness". (This is Heidegger's usual reading of ''aletheia'' as ''Unverborgenheit'', "unconcealment.")&lt;ref&gt;Rodney R. Coltman, [https://books.google.gr/books?id=DUEjKCKhigMC&amp;dq=Aletheia+verborgenheit&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''The Language of Hermeneutics: Gadamer and Heidegger in Dialogue''], SUNY Press, 1998, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to the notion of [[world disclosure]], the way in which things get their sense as part of a holistically structured, pre-interpreted background of meaning. Initially, Heidegger wanted ''aletheia'' to stand for a re-interpreted definition of [[truth]]. However, he later corrected the association of ''aletheia'' with truth.

=== Apophantic ===
:([[German language|German]]: ''apophantisch'')

An assertion (as opposed to a question, a doubt or a more expressive sense) is '''apophantic'''. It is a statement that covers up meaning and just gives us something as present-at-hand. For Instance, "The President is on vacation", and, "Salt is Sodium Chloride" are sentences that, because of their apophantic character, can easily be picked-up and repeated in news and gossip by 'The They.' However, the real ''ready-to-hand'' meaning and context may be lost.

===Being-in-the-world===
:(German: ''In-der-Welt-sein'')

Being-in-the-world is Heidegger's replacement for terms such as subject, object, consciousness, and world. For him, the split of things into subject/object, as we find in the Western tradition and even in our language, must be overcome, as is indicated by the root structure of [[Husserl]] and [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]]'s concept of [[intentionality]], i.e., that all consciousness is consciousness of something, that there is no consciousness, as such, cut off from an object (be it the matter of a thought or of a perception). Nor are there objects without some consciousness beholding or being involved with them.

At the most basic level of ''being-in-the-world,'' Heidegger notes that there is always a mood, a mood that "assails us" in our unreflecting devotion to the world. A mood comes neither from the "outside" nor from the "inside," but arises from being-in-the-world. One may turn away from a mood but that is only to another mood; it is part of our [[facticity]]. Only with a mood are we permitted to encounter things in the world. ''[[Dasein]]'' (a co-term for being-in-the-world) has an openness to the world that is constituted by the attunement of a mood or state of mind. As such, ''Dasein'' is a "[[Thrownness|thrown]]" "projection" (''geworfener Entwurf''), projecting itself onto the possibilities that lie before it or may be hidden, and interpreting and understanding the world in terms of possibilities. Such projecting has nothing to do with comporting oneself toward a plan that has been thought out. It is not a plan, since ''Dasein'' has, as ''Dasein'', already projected itself. ''Dasein'' always understands itself in terms of possibilities. As projecting, the understanding of ''Dasein'' is its possibilities ''as'' possibilities. One can take up the possibilities of "The They" self and merely follow along or make some more authentic understanding (see [[Hubert Dreyfus]]'s book ''Being-in-the-World''.)

===Being-toward-death===
:(German: ''Sein-zum-Tode'')

Being-toward-death is '''not''' an orientation that brings ''[[Dasein]]'' closer to its end, in terms of clinical death, but is rather '''a way of being'''.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1962, H.247.&lt;/ref&gt; Being-toward-death refers to a process of growing through the world where a certain foresight guides the ''Dasein'' towards gaining an authentic perspective. It is provided by [[Angst|dread]] or death. In the analysis of time, it is revealed as a threefold condition of [[Being]]. Time, the present and the notion of the "eternal", are modes of temporality. Temporality is the way we see time. For Heidegger, it is very different from the mistaken view of time as being a linear series of past, present and future. Instead he sees it as being an [[Ecstasy (philosophy)|ecstasy]], an outside-of-itself, of futural projections (possibilities) and one's place in history as a part of one's generation. Possibilities, then, are integral to our understanding of time; our projects, or thrown projection in-the-world, are what absorb and direct us. Futurity, as a direction toward the future that always contains the past—the has-been—is a primary mode of ''Dasein''{{'}}s temporality.

Death is that possibility which is the absolute impossibility of ''Dasein''. As such, it cannot be compared to any other kind of ending or "running out" of something. For example, one's death is not an [[empirical]] event. For Heidegger, death is ''Dasein''{{'}}s ownmost (it is what makes ''Dasein'' individual), it is non-relational (nobody can take one's death away from one, or die in one's place, and we can not understand our own death through the death of other ''Dasein''), and it is not to be outstripped. The "not-yet" of life is always already a part of ''Dasein'': "as soon as man comes to life, he is at once old enough to die." The threefold condition of death is thus simultaneously one's ''"ownmost potentiality-for-being, non-relational, and not to be out-stripped"''. Death is determinate in its inevitability, but an authentic Being-toward-death understands the indeterminate nature of one's own inevitable death — one never knows when or how it is going to come. However, this indeterminacy does not put death in some distant, futural "not-yet"; authentic Being-toward-death understands one's individual death as always already a part of one.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1962, H.255.&lt;/ref&gt;

With average, everyday (normal) discussion of death, all this is concealed. The "they-self" talks about it in a fugitive manner, passes it off as something that occurs at some time but is not yet "present-at-hand" as an ''actuality'', and hides its character as one's ownmost possibility, presenting it as belonging to no one in particular. It becomes devalued — redefined as a neutral and mundane aspect of existence that merits no authentic consideration. "One dies" is interpreted as a [[facticity|fact]], and comes to mean "nobody dies".&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1962, H.253-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] takes ''Dasein'' out of the "They," in part by revealing its place as a part of the They. Heidegger states that ''Authentic being-toward-death'' calls ''Dasein''{{'}}s individual self out of its "they-self", and frees it to re-evaluate life from the standpoint of finitude. In so doing, ''Dasein'' opens itself up for "[[angst]]," translated alternately as "dread" or as "anxiety." Angst, as opposed to fear, does not have any distinct object for its dread; it is rather anxious in the face of Being-in-the-world in general — that is, it is anxious in the face of ''Dasein''{{'}}s own self. Angst is a shocking individuation of ''Dasein'', when it realizes that it is not at home in the world, or when it comes face to face with its own "[[uncanny]]" (German ''Unheimlich'' "not homelike"). In ''Dasein''{{'}}s individuation, it is open to hearing the "call of conscience" (German ''Gewissensruf''), which comes from ''Dasein''{{'}}s own Self when it wants to be its Self. This Self is then open to truth, understood as unconcealment (Greek ''aletheia''). In this moment of vision, ''Dasein'' understands what is hidden as well as hiddenness itself, indicating Heidegger's regular uniting of opposites; in this case, truth and untruth.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1962, H.260–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Being-with===
:(German: ''Mitsein'')

The term "Being-with" refers to an ontological characteristic of the human being, that it is always already&lt;ref&gt;By "[[always already]]" Heidegger means that every phenomenological inspection of the human being finds this characteristic.  It is not founded on something else.&lt;/ref&gt; with others of its kind. This assertion is to be understood not as a factual statement about an individual, that he or she is at the moment in spatial proximity to one or more other individuals.  Rather it is a statement about the being of every human, that in the structures of its being-in-the-world one finds an implicit reference to other humans. We all live with others, and in fact we could not live without them. Humans have been called (by others, not by Heidegger) "ultrasocial"&lt;ref&gt;Haidt, Jonathan. ''The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom''. New York: Basic Books, 2006, pp. 47 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  and "obligatorily gregarious."&lt;ref&gt;de Waal, Frans. ''Primates and Philosophers: How Morality Evolved''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2006, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Without others of our kind we could not survive. Heidegger, from his phenomenological perspective, calls this feature of human life "Being-with" (''Mitsein''), and says it is essential to being human.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1962, p. 156, H.125.&lt;/ref&gt; We are inauthentic when we fail to recognize how much and in what ways how we think of ourselves and how we habitually behave is influenced by our social surroundings. We are authentic when we pay attention to that influence and decide for ourselves whether to go along with it or not. Living entirely without such influence, however, is not an option.

===Care (or concern)===
{{Anchor|Care}}
:(German: ''Sorge'')

A fundamental basis of our being-in-the-world is, for Heidegger, not matter or spirit but care''':

::Dasein's [[facticity]] is such that its Being-in-the-world has always dispersed itself or even split itself up into definite ways of Being-in. The multiplicity of these is indicated by the following examples: having to do with something, producing something, attending to something and looking after it, making use of something, giving something up and letting it go, undertaking, accomplishing, evincing, interrogating, considering, discussing, determining. . . .&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1962, H.56&lt;/ref&gt;

All these ways of Being-in have concern (''Sorge'', [[wikt:cura|care]]) as their kind of Being. Just as the scientist might investigate or search, and presume neutrality, we see that beneath this there is the mood, the concern of the scientist to discover, to reveal new ideas or theories and to attempt to level off temporal aspects.

===Clearing===
{{anchor|Lichtung}}
:(German: ''Lichtung'')

In German the word ''Lichtung'' means a clearing, as in, for example, a clearing in the woods. Since its root is the German word for light (''Licht''), it is sometimes also translated as "lighting," and in Heidegger's work it refers to the necessity of a clearing in which anything at all can appear, the clearing in which some thing or idea can show itself, or be unconcealed.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1962, H.133&lt;/ref&gt; Note the relation that this has to ''Aletheia'' (see the [[Aletheia|main article]] or the entry above) and [[world disclosure|disclosure]].

Beings (''Seiendes''), but not Being itself (''Sein''), stand out as if in a clearing, or physically, as if in a space.&lt;ref&gt;This notion of the clearing, or of aspects pertaining to the leeway, spacing, giving room, and dwelling are treated in: [[Nader El-Bizri]] "ON KAI KHORA: Situating Heidegger between the Sophist and the Timaeus," ''Studia Phaenomenologica'', Vol. IV, Issues 1-2 (2004), pp. 73–98; [[Nader El-Bizri]], "Being at Home Among Things: Heidegger’s Reflections on Dwelling", ''Environment, Space, Place'', Vol. 3 (2011), pp. 47–71; Nader El-Bizri, "On Dwelling: Heideggerian Allusions to Architectural Phenomenology", Studia UBB. Philosophia, Vol. 60, No. 1 (2015): 5-30.  See also [[Khôra]] and [[Phenomenology (architecture)]] in addition to the 'architecture' section under the main Heidegger entry on Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[Hubert Dreyfus]] writes, "things show up in the light of our understanding of being."&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Dreyfus, ''Being-in-the-World''. Cambridge: MIT Press, 1995. p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the clearing makes possible the disclosure of beings (''Seiendes''), and also access to Dasein's own being. But the clearing is not, itself, an entity that can be known directly, in the sense in which know about the entities of the world. As Heidegger writes in ''On the Origin of the Work of Art'':

:"In the midst of being as a whole an open place occurs. There is a clearing, a lighting. Thought of in reference to what is, to beings, this clearing is in a greater degree than are beings. This open center is therefore not surrounded by what is; rather, the lighting center itself encircles all that is, like the Nothing which we scarcely know. That which is can only be, as a being, if it stands within and stands out within what is lighted in this clearing. Only this clearing grants and guarantees to us humans a passage to those beings that we ourselves are not, and access to the being that we ourselves are." &lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, M. 2001, On the Origin of the Work of Art. In Poetry, language, thought. (A. Hofstadter, Trans.) (1st ed.). New York: Perennical Classics. (Original work published 1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Destruktion''===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Deconstruction]] --&gt;
Founded in the work of [[Martin Luther]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crowe|first1=Benjamin|authorlink=Benjamin D. Crowe|title=Heidegger's Religious Origins: Destruction and Authenticity|date=2006|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, IN|isbn=0253347068|page=2; also see 7|edition=Hardcover|quote=Heidegger... chose a name for it which itself reflects the importance of Luther to his thinking: '&lt;i&gt;Destruktion&lt;/i&gt;', a Germanized version of the term '&lt;i&gt;destructio&lt;/i&gt;' used quite frequently in Luther's early writings.}}&lt;/ref&gt; here is Martin Heidegger on philosophy as the task of destroying [[Ontology|ontological concept]]s, in other words also including, ordinary everyday meanings of words like time, history, being, theory, death, mind, body, matter, logic etc.:

:When tradition thus becomes master, it does so in such a way that what it 'transmits' is made so inaccessible, proximally and for the most part, that it rather becomes concealed. Tradition takes what has come down to us and delivers it over to self-evidence; it blocks our access to those primordial 'sources' from which the categories and concepts handed down to us have been in part quite genuinely drawn. Indeed it makes us forget that they have had such an origin, and makes us suppose that the necessity of going back to these sources is something which we need not even understand. (''Being and Time'', p. 43)

Heidegger considers that tradition can become calcified here and there:
:If the question of Being is to have its own history made transparent, then this hardened tradition must be loosened up, and the concealments which it has brought about dissolved. We understand this task as one in which by taking the question of Being as our clue we are to destroy the traditional content of ancient ontology until we arrive at those primordial experiences in which we achieved our first ways of determining the nature of Being—the ways which have guided us ever since. (''Being and Time'', p. 44)

Heidegger then remarks on the positivity of his project of ''Destruktion'':
:it has nothing to do with a vicious relativizing of ontological standpoints. But this destruction is just as far from having the negative sense of shaking off the ontological tradition. We must, on the contrary, stake out the positive possibilities of that tradition, and this means keeping it within its limits; and these in turn are given factically in the way the question is formulated at the time, and in the way the possible field for investigation is thus bounded off. On its negative side, this destruction does not relate itself toward the past; its criticism is aimed at 'today' and at the prevalent way of treating the history of ontology. .. But to bury the past in nullity (Nichtigkeit) is not the purpose of this destruction; its aim is positive; its negative function remains unexpressed and indirect. (''Being and Time'', p. 44)

===''Dasein''===
{{Main|Dasein}}

''Dasein'' is a German word and is sometimes translated as "being-there" or "being-here" (''da'' combines in its meaning "here" and "there", excluding the spatial-relational distinction made by the English words; ''Sein'' is the infinitive, "to be"). It is the German form of the [[Copula (linguistics)#Existential usage|existential expletive]], which, as in most European languages, is expressed idiomatically. Heidegger, after [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], used the word, but as a gerund synonym for "human being" or "human entity." A Dasein is then a new coinage for a being that is there, ''in a familiar world'', and in a mood. Dasein also has unique capacities for language, intersubjective communication, and detached reasoning. Heidegger does not want to get tied up with overused and ambiguous words such as "person," "consciousness," "soul," or "spirit," so Dasein is a new way of approaching something all of those other words point towards, but without the connotations. Dasein is the starting point of Heidegger's ontology. It is typically thought to apply to humans, but it could apply to any being that fulfills the definition's characteristics which he states. What makes a being a Dasein is as follows: Dasein is a being whose being is an issue for itself; every Dasein has an a priori sense of "mineness," or being one's self; Dasein is always thrown into the world, meaning it finds itself within a world, meaning no Dasein has ever been decontextualized. We are all world-bound, submerged, entangled, and engaged with our ontico-ontological surroundings through care, concern, and moods. Dasein has various modes of being-in-the-world, which are the subject of much of Heidegger's analysis in Being and Time. Furthermore, average humans have a pre-ontological (general intuitive sense of being) understanding of being insofar as they understand ''what'' things are and ''that'' they are e.g. "My dog is brown" or "Today is Sunday." Heidegger believed that this pre-reflective understanding of being, that which determines entities ''as'' entities,&lt;ref&gt;''Being and Time'' (1962), pg. 25&lt;/ref&gt; helps constitute our unique existence as human beings, thus the coinage of "''[[Dasein]]''."

===Disclosure===
:(German: ''Erschlossenheit'')
{{Main|World disclosure}}

[[Hubert Dreyfus]] and Charles Spinosa write that: "According to Heidegger our nature is to be world disclosers. That is, by means of our equipment and coordinated practices we human beings open coherent, distinct contexts or worlds in which we perceive, feel, act, and think."&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Dreyfus and Charles Spinosa, "Further Reflections on Heidegger, Technology and the Everyday," in Nikolas Kompridis, ed. ''Philosophical Romanticism'', New York: Routledge, 2006, 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger scholar [[Nikolas Kompridis]] writes: "World disclosure refers, with deliberate ambiguity, to a process which actually occurs at two different levels. At one level, it refers to the disclosure of an already interpreted, symbolically structured world; the world, that is, within which we always already find ourselves. At another level, it refers as much to the disclosure of new horizons of meaning as to the disclosure of previously hidden or unthematized dimensions of meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Nikolas Kompridis, "On World Disclosure: Heidegger, Habermas and Dewey," Thesis Eleven 1994; 37; 29-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Reflective disclosure}}

===Discourse===
{{anchor|Rede}}
:(German: ''Rede'')
The ontological-existential structure of Dasein consists of "thrownness" (''Geworfenheit''), "projection" (''Entwurf''), and "being-along-with"/"engagement" (''Sein-bei''). These three basic features of existence are inseparably bound to "discourse" (''Rede''), understood as the deepest unfolding of language.&lt;ref&gt;Parvis Emad, ''On the Way to Heidegger’s Contributions to Philosophy'', University of Wisconsin Press, 2007, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equipment===
{{anchor|das Zeug}}
:(German: ''das Zeug'')
An object in the world with which we have meaningful dealings.

A nearly un-translatable term, Heidegger's equipment can be thought of as a collective noun, so that it is never appropriate to call something 'an equipment'. Instead, its use often reflects it to mean a tool, or as an "in-order-to" for Dasein. Tools, in this collective sense, and in being ''ready-to-hand'', always exist in a network of other tools and organizations, e.g., the paper is on a desk in a room at a university. It is inappropriate usually to see such equipment on its own or as something ''present-at-hand''.

Another, less prosaic, way of thinking of 'equipment' is as 'stuff we can work with' around us, along with its context. "The paper we can do things with, from the desk, in the university, in the city, on the world, in the universe." 'Equipment' refers to the thing, and its usefulness possibilities, and its context.

===''Ereignis''===
'''''Ereignis''''' is translated often as "an event," but is better understood in terms of something "coming into view." It comes from the German prefix, ''er-'', comparable to 're-' in English, and ''Auge'', eye.&lt;ref&gt;Richard F. H. Polt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cVRgERTtIeEC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=ereignis+etymology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ieh1CUhKeG&amp;sig=l6CCuQ0J-eT1q-KluXRJ5v9Xxug&amp;hl=no&amp;ei=87-LSpjcL4GMsAbj_ojKDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=ereignis%20etymology&amp;f=false ''The Emergency of Being: On Heidegger's Contributions to Philosophy''], Richard F. H. Polt, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Giorgio Agamben]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=l52xC43N_2kC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=ereignis+etymology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=opgRBXjjsv&amp;sig=Wd3pXLVbxq23LgVqCXQxqPbdMUs&amp;hl=no&amp;ei=87-LSpjcL4GMsAbj_ojKDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8#v=onepage&amp;q=ereignis%20etymology&amp;f=false ''Potentialities: Collected Essays''], Stanford University Press, 1999, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a noun coming from a reflexive verb. Note that the German prefix ''er-'' also can connote an end or a fatality. A recent translation of the word by Kenneth Maly and Parvis Emad renders the word as "enowning"; that in connection with things that arise and appear, that they are arising 'into their own'. [[Hubert Dreyfus]] defined the term as "things coming into themselves by belonging together."

Ereignis appears in Heidegger's later works and is not easily summarized. The most sustained treatment of the theme occurs in the cryptic and difficult ''Contributions to Philosophy''. In the following quotation he associates it with the fundamental idea of concern from ''Being and Time'', the English etymology of ''con-cern'' is similar to that of the German:

:: ...we must return to what we call a concern. The word Ereignis (concern) has been lifted from organically developing language. Er-eignen (to concern) means, originally, to distinguish or discern which one's eyes see, and in seeing calling to oneself, ap-propriate. The word con-cern we shall now harness as a theme word in the service of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''Identity and Difference'', trans. Joan Stambaugh. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Existence===
:(German ''Existenz'')
Heidegger uses this word to describe the nature of ''[[Dasein]]'''s being. Beings unlike ''Dasein'' (chairs, shoes, etc.) do not "exist"; they are merely "objectively present". ''Dasein'' exists; chairs are objectively present.

Two related words, ''existenziell'' and ''Existential'', are used as descriptive characteristics of Being. To be ''existenziell'' is a categorical or [[#Ontic|ontic]] characteristic: an understanding of all this which relates to one's existence, while an ''Existenzial'' is an [[#Ontological|ontological]] characteristic: the structure of existence.

Heidegger himself held between 1 and 4 December 1949 at [[Bremen]] Club four lectures, which were repeated in the spring of 1950 (25 and 26 March) unchanged at [[w:de:Bühlerhöhe|Bühlerhöhe]]. The titles were ''Das Ding'', ''Das Gestell'', ''Die Gefahr'' and ''Die Kehre''. The second and third lecture were reworked into a larger text in 1953 with the title ''Die Frage nach der Technik'' and in this form published in 1954 in the collection ''Vorträge und Aufsätze'', which also included a slightly reworked version of the first lecture, ''Das Ding''. In 1962, ''Die Frage nach der Technik'' and the fourth lecture ''Die Kehre'' were published together in a small book called ''Die Technik und die Kehre'', which is still in print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heidegger|first=Martin|title=Die Technik und die Kehre|others=13th edition, 2014|publisher=Klett-Cotta|id={{ISBN|978-3-6089-1050-6}} The book's preface states incorrectly that 'Die Frage nach der Technik' corresponds to just the second Bremen lecture.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bremen lectures were published all four together, and in their original form, only in 1994 in volume 79 of the Gesamtausgabe.

===Ontic===
:(German: ''ontisch'')
{{main|ontic}}
Heidegger uses the term '''ontic,''' often in contrast to the term '''ontological''', when he gives descriptive characteristics of a particular thing and the "plain facts" of its existence. What is ontic is what makes something what it is.

For an individual discussing the nature of "being", one's ontic could refer to the physical, factual elements that produce and/or underlie one's own reality - the physical brain and its substructures. Moralists raise the question of a moral ontic when discussing whether there exists an external, objective, independent source or wellspring for morality that transcends culture and time.

===Ontological===
:(German: ''ontologisch'')

As opposed to "ontic" (''ontisch''), '''ontological''' is used when the nature, or meaningful structure of existence is at issue. [[Ontology]], a [[discipline]] of philosophy, focuses on the formal study of Being. Thus, something that is ontological is concerned with understanding and investigating Being, the ground of Being, or the concept of Being itself.

For an individual discussing the nature of "being", the ontological could refer to one's own first-person, subjective, phenomenological experience of being.

===Possibility===
:(German: ''Möglichkeit'')
A term used only once in a particular edition of ''Being and Time''. In the text, the term appears to denote "the possibility whose probability it is solely to be possible". At least, if it were used in context, this is the only plausible definition.

===Present-at-hand===
:(German: ''vorhanden''; ''Vorhandenheit'' "presence-at-hand")

With the '''present-at-hand''' one has (in contrast to "ready-to-hand") an attitude like that of a scientist or theorist, of merely looking at or observing something. In seeing an entity as present-at-hand, the beholder is concerned only with the bare facts of a thing or a concept, as they are present and in order to '''theorize''' about it. This way of seeing is disinterested in the concern it may hold for Dasein, its history or usefulness. This attitude is often described as existing in neutral space without any particular mood or subjectivity. However, for Heidegger, it is not completely disinterested or neutral. It has a mood, and is part of the [[metaphysics of presence]] that tends to level all things down. Through his writings, Heidegger sets out to accomplish the ''Destruktion'' (see above) of this metaphysics of presence.

'''Presence-at-hand''' is not the way things in the world are usually encountered, and it is only revealed as a deficient or secondary mode, e.g., when a hammer breaks it loses its usefulness and appears as merely there, present-at-hand. When a thing is revealed as present-at-hand, it stands apart from any useful set of equipment but soon loses this mode of being present-at-hand and becomes something, for example, that which must be repaired or replaced.

===Ready-to-hand===
:(German ''griffbereit'', ''zuhanden''; ''Zuhandenheit'' "readiness-to-hand, handiness")

However, in almost all cases we are involved in the world in an ordinary, and more involved, way. We are usually doing things with a view to achieving something. Take for example, a hammer: it is ready-to-hand; we use it without theorizing. In fact, if we were to look at it as present-at-hand, we might easily make a mistake. Only when it breaks or something goes wrong might we see the hammer as present-at-hand, just lying there. Even then however, it may be not fully present-at-hand, as it is now showing itself as something to be repaired or disposed, and therefore a part of the totality of our involvements. In this case its Being may be seen as unreadiness-to-hand. Heidegger outlines three manners of unreadiness-to-hand: Conspicuous (damaged; e.g., a lamp's wiring has broken), Obtrusive (a part is missing which is required for the entity to function; e.g., we find the bulb is missing), Obstinate (when the entity is a hindrance to us in pursuing a project; e.g., the lamp blocks my view of the computer screen).

Importantly, the ready-to-hand only emerges from the prior attitude in which we care about what is going on and we see the hammer in a context or world of equipment that is handy or remote, and that is there "in order to" do something. In this sense the ''ready-to-hand'' is ''primordial'' compared to that of the '''present-at-hand'''. The term primordial here does not imply something Primitive, but rather refers to Heidegger's idea that Being can only be understood through what is everyday and "close" to us. Our everyday understanding of the world is necessarily essentially a part of any kind of scientific or theoretical studies of entities — the present-at-hand — might be. Only by studying our "average-everyday" understanding of the world, as it is expressed in the totality of our relationships to the ready-to-hand entities of the world, can we lay appropriate bases for specific scientific investigations into specific entities within the world.

For Heidegger in ''Being and Time'' this illustrates, in a very practical way, the way the present-at-hand, as a present in a "now" or a present eternally (as, for example, a scientific law or a Platonic Form), has come to dominate intellectual thought, especially since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. To understand the question of [[being]] one must be careful not to fall into this leveling off, or forgetfulness of being, that has come to assail Western thought since Socrates, see the [[metaphysics of presence]].

===Resoluteness===
:(German: ''Entschlossenheit'')

Resoluteness refers to one's ability to "unclose" one's framework of intelligibility (i.e., to make sense of one's words and actions in terms of one's life as a whole), and the ability to be receptive to the "call of conscience."

===The One / the They===
{{anchor|das Man}}
:(German: ''Das Man'', meaning "they-self")

One of the most interesting and important 'concepts' in ''Being and Time'' is that of ''Das Man'', for which there is no exact English translation; different translations and commentators use different conventions. It is often translated as "the They" or "People" or "Anyone" but is more accurately translated as "One" (as in "'one' should always arrive on time"). ''Das Man'' derives from the impersonal singular pronoun ''man'' ('one', as distinct from 'I', or 'you', or 'he', or 'she', or 'they'). Both the German ''man'' and the English 'one' are neutral or indeterminate in respect of gender and, even, in a sense, of number, though both words suggest an unspecified, unspecifiable, indeterminate plurality. The semantic role of the word ''man'' in German is nearly identical to that of the word ''one'' in English.

Heidegger refers to this concept of ''the One'' in explaining inauthentic modes of existence, in which Dasein, instead of truly choosing to do something, does it only because "That is what one does" or "That is what people do". Thus, ''das Man'' is not a proper or measurable entity, but rather an amorphous part of social reality that functions effectively in the manner that it does through this intangibility.

''Das Man'' constitutes a possibility of Dasein's Being, and so ''das Man'' cannot be said to be any particular someone. Rather, the existence of 'the They' is known to us through, for example, linguistic conventions and social norms. Heidegger states that, "The "they" prescribes one's state-of-mind, and determines what and how one 'sees'".

To give examples: when one makes an appeal to what is commonly known, one says "one does not do such a thing"; When one sits in a car or bus or reads a newspaper, one is participating in the world of 'the They'. This is a feature of 'the They' as it functions in society, an authority that has no particular source. In a non-moral sense Heidegger contrasts "the authentic self" ("my owned self") with "the they self" ("my un-owned self").

A related concept to this is that of the ''apophantic assertion''.

===World===
:(German: ''Welt'')
{{Further|World disclosure}}

Heidegger gives us four ways of using the term world:

::1. "World" is used as an ontical concept, and signifies the totality of things which can be present-at-hand within the world.

::2. "World" functions as an ontological term, and signifies the Being of those things we have just mentioned. And indeed 'world' can become a term for any realm which encompasses a multiplicity of entities: for instance, when one talks of the 'world' of a mathematician, 'world' signifies the realm of possible objects of mathematics.

::3. "World" can be understood in another ontical sense—not, however, as those entities which Dasein essentially is not and which can be encountered within-the-world, but rather as the ''wherein'' a factical Dasein as such can be said to 'live'. "World" has here a pre-ontological [[existentiell]] signification. Here again there are different possibilities: "world" may stand for the 'public' we-world, or one's 'own' closest (domestic) environment.

::4. Finally, "world" designates the ontologico-existential concept of ''worldhood'' (''Weltheit''). Worldhood itself may have as its modes whatever structural wholes any special 'worlds' may have at the time; but it embraces in itself the ''a priori'' character of worldhood in general.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger 1962, H.64&lt;/ref&gt;

Note, it is the third definition that Heidegger normally uses.

'''Higher-order volitions''' (or '''higher-order desire'''), as opposed to action-determining volitions, are [[volition (psychology)|volition]]s about volitions. Higher-order volitions are potentially more often guided by long-term [[conviction]]s and [[reason]]ing.

A first-order volition is a desire about anything else, such as to own a new car, to meet the pope, or to drink alcohol.  Second-order volition are desires about desires, or to desire to change the process, the how, of desiring.     Examples would be {{cl-span|to desire to want to own|date=June 2015}} a new car;  meeting the pope; or to desire to quit drinking alcohol permanently. A higher-order volition can go unfulfilled due to uncontrolled lower-order volitions.

An example for a failure to follow higher-order volitions is the drug addict who takes drugs even though he would like to quit taking drugs. According to [[Harry Frankfurt]] the drug addict has established [[free will]], in respect to that single aspect, when his higher-order volition to stop wanting drugs determines the precedence of his changing, action determining desires either to take drugs or not to take drugs.

'''Identity disorder''' in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]], was first listed as a separate diagnosis in version III (1980). In version IV (1994), it was replaced by "[[DSM-IV codes#Additional codes|Identity problem]]", which was not defined as a mental disorder per se, but was listed in a chapter containing problems that might be a focus of clinical attention. Identity disorder was 'downgraded' to Identity problem as research indicated that distress over one's identity is so common that it might very well be considered part of the [[Normality (behavior)|normality]]. In practice, if a person's distress persisted or worsened, an Identity problem would often be succeeded by a diagnosis of an actual disorder, such as a [[mood disorder]] or [[borderline personality disorder]]. In [[DSM-5]] (2013), "Identity problem" was removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1=Judith L. | last1=Rapoport | first2=Deborah R. | last2=Ismond | title=DSM-IV Training Guide for Diagnosis of Childhood Disorders | year=1996 | page=282 | isbn=978-0876307663 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2AmJH3Iwf2kC&amp;lpg=PA282&amp;pg=PA282#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1=James E. | last1=Côté | first2=Charles G. | last2=Levine | title=Identity Formation, Agency, and Culture: A Social Psychological Synthesis | year=2002 | page=155 | isbn=978-1135650049 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cyh5AgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP155&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coauthors of both indexes are [[Ian Vásquez]] and Tanja Porčnik (née Štumberger).

The index is based on measures of [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of religion]], [[Economic Freedom of the World|individual economic choice]], [[freedom of association]], [[freedom of assembly]], [[violence]] and [[crime]]s, [[freedom of movement]], [[LGBT rights]], and [[women's rights]]. Other components of the Freedom Index include [[human trafficking]], [[sexual violence]], [[female genital mutilation]], [[homicide]], and [[adoption]] by [[homosexual]]s.&lt;ref name=news&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freetheworld.com/2012/freedomIndex/010813_Human_Freedom_INTL.pdf|title=New Zealand ranked No. 1 in new comprehensive index of human freedom; U.S. and Denmark tied for seventh|author=Fraser Institute|date=2013|website=An Index of Freedom in the World|access-date=2013-01-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203053149/http://www.freetheworld.com/2012/freedomIndex/010813_Human_Freedom_INTL.pdf|archive-date=2013-02-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The index rates countries on a scale from 10 (freest) to 0 (least free). In 2012, the freest countries were [[New Zealand]] (8.7), the [[Netherlands]] (8.5), and [[Hong Kong]] (8.3). Least free were [[Zimbabwe]] (3.4), [[Burma]] (3.7), and Pakistan (4.5).&lt;ref name=ch3&gt;{{cite news|website= An Index of Freedom in the World|url= http://www.freetheworld.com/2012/freedomIndex/Towards-Worldwide-Index-3-Vasquez-Stumberger.pdf|title= Chapter 3, Towards a Worldwide Index of Human Freedom|author= Fraser Institute|date= 2012|access-date= 2013-01-09|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130120034831/http://www.freetheworld.com/2012/freedomIndex/Towards-Worldwide-Index-3-Vasquez-Stumberger.pdf|archive-date= 2013-01-20|dead-url= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The components on which the index is based can be divided into economic freedoms and other personal freedoms. Highest ranking in [[Economic Freedom of the World|economic freedoms]] were [[Hong Kong]] (9.0) and [[Singapore]] (8.8). Highest ranking in [[personal freedom]]s were the [[Netherlands]] (9.5) and [[Uruguay]] (9.4).&lt;ref name=ch3/&gt;

The Freedom Index does not measure [[democracy]], but it does measure freedom of speech and media, press killings, political imprisonment, etc. According to the report, democracy may be the form of government that best protects freedom, but democracy may both increase and reduce freedom. Nevertheless, democracy strongly correlates with freedom (7.9), as measured by the Economist Intelligence Unit's [[Democracy Index]] and the Freedom Index.&lt;ref name=ch3/&gt;

The Freedom Index is included as part of the book ''Towards a Worldwide Index of Human Freedom'', written by 13 academics and economists from Canada (Fraser Institute), the United States (Cato Institute, [[Emory University]]), Germany (Liberales Institut, Goethe-University Frankfurt am Main), and Russia (Institute of Economic Analysis). Among other claims, the report argues that the criminalization of and the war on drugs have restricted many components of freedom.&lt;ref name=news/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13126">In the context of an evolving [[information society]], the term '''information ecology''' marks a connection between [[ecology|ecological]] ideas with the dynamics and properties of the increasingly dense, complex and important digital informational environment and has been gaining acceptance in a growing number of disciplines. "Information ecology" often is used as [[metaphor]], viewing the informational space as an [[ecosystem]].

Information ecology is a science which studies the laws governing the influence of information summary on the formation and functioning of [[biosystem]]s, including that of individuals, human [[communities]] and humanity in general and on the health and psychological, physical and social well-being of the human being; and which undertakes to develop methodologies to improve the information environment {{Harv|Eryomin|1998}}.

Information ecology also makes a connection to the concept of [[collective intelligence]] and [[knowledge ecology]] {{Harv|Pór|2000}}.  Eddy et. al. (2014) use information ecology for science-policy integration in ecosystems-based management (EBM).

==Language of ecology==
Information ecology draws on the language of ecology - [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]], [[species]], [[evolution]], [[ecosystem]], [[ecological niche|niche]], growth, equilibrium, etc. - to describe and analyze [[information systems]] from a perspective that considers the distribution and abundance of [[organism]]s, their relationships with each other, and how they influence and are influenced by their [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. The virtual lack of boundaries between information systems and the impact of [[information technology]] on economic, social and environmental activities frequently calls on an [[information ecologist]] to consider local information ecosystems in the context of larger systems, and of the evolution of global information ecosystems. See also [[list of ecology topics]].

== Networked information economy ==

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yochai Benkler]] provides an analytic framework for the emergence of the networked [[information economy]] that draws deeply on the language and perspectives of information ecology together with observations and analyses of high-visibility examples of successful [[peer production]] processes, citing Wikipedia as a prime example.

[[Bonnie Nardi]] and [[Vicki O'Day]] in their book "Information Ecologies: Using Technology with Heart,"  {{Harv|Nardi|O’Day|1999}} apply the ecology metaphor to local environments, such as libraries and schools, in preference to the more common metaphors for technology as tool, text, or system.

== In different domains / disciplines ==

=== Anthropology ===
Nardi and O’Day’s book represents the first specific treatment of information ecology by anthropologists. H.E. Kuchka&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kuchka.org/information-ecology|title=Information Ecology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; situates information within socially-distributed cognition of cultural systems. Casagrande and Peters&lt;ref&gt;Casagrande, D.G., &amp; C. Peters. 2013. Ecomyopia meets the longue durée: An information ecology of the increasingly arid Southwestern United States. Pp. 97-144 in H. Kopnina &amp; E. Shoreman (Eds.), Environmental Anthropology: Future Directions. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; use information ecology for an anthropological critique of Southwest US water policy. Stepp (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kuchka.org/sites/default/files/stepp.pdf |title=Data |website=kuchka.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; published a prospectus for the anthropological study of information ecology.

=== Knowledge management ===
Information ecology was used as book title by Thomas H. Davenport and Laurence Prusak {{Harv|Davenport|Prusak|1997}}, with a focus on the organization dimensions of information ecology. There was also an academic research project at [[Distributed Systems Technology Centre|DSTC]] called ''Information ecology'', concerned with distributed information systems and online communities.

=== Law ===
Law schools represent another area where the phrase is gaining increasing acceptance, e.g.
NYU Law School Conference Towards a Free Information Ecology&lt;ref&gt;
Conference [http://www1.law.nyu.edu/ili/conferences/freeinfo2000/aboutconf/index.html A Free Information Ecology in the Digital Environment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329043908/http://www.law.nyu.edu/ili/conferences/freeinfo2000/aboutconf/index.html |date=2009-03-29 }}, New York University School of Law, March 31, 2000 to Sunday, April 2, 2000
&lt;/ref&gt;  and a lecture series on Information ecology at Duke University Law School's [[Center for the Study of the Public Domain]].

=== Library science ===
The field of [[library science]] has seen significant adoption of the term and librarians have been described by Nardi and O'Day as a "keystone species in information ecology",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/digiref/archive/nardi.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-12-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060307005156/http://www.loc.gov/rr/digiref/archive/nardi.html |archive-date=2006-03-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/sfsla/bulletin/sepoct00/info_ecology.html |accessdate=April 2, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040502182859/http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/sfsla/bulletin/sepoct00/info_ecology.html |archivedate=May 2, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and references to information ecology range as far afield as the Collaborative Digital Reference Service of the Library of Congress,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/digiref/source/CDRS-KB-CNI.PPT |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-12-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060307010141/http://www.loc.gov/rr/digiref/source/CDRS-KB-CNI.PPT |archive-date=2006-03-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to children's library database administrator in Russia.

=== Biology ===
There has also been increasing use of "information ecology" as a concept among ecologists involved in digital mapping of botanical resources, including research by Zhang Xinshi at the Institute of Botany of the China Academy of Science; also see a presentation to the Information Ecology SIG at Yale University's Forestry School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/files/dpu-pip/ien-iie.ppt]{{Dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human Ecology ===
From the analysis of specific examples of the nature and physiology are determined 10 axioms and laws of information ecology, which serves as the basis for creating information strategies and tactics in social, economic, political and other spheres that affect [[human health]] and human communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291074682_Eryomin_AL_Nature_and_Physiology_of_the_Informational_Human_Ecology_Ecology_of_Human_-_2000_-_No2_-_P55-60_Eremin_AL_Priroda_i_fiziologia_informacionnoj_ekologii_celoveka_Ekologia_celoveka_-_2000_-_No|title=Eryomin A.L.

=== Science-Policy Integration (SPI) / Ecosystems-Based Management (EBM) ===
Eddy et. al. (2014) use principles of information ecology to develop a framework for integrating scientific information in decision-making in ecosystem-based management (EBM).  Using a metaphor of how a species adapts to environmental changes through information processing, they developed a 3-tiered model that differentiates primary, secondary and tertiary levels of information processing, within both the technical and human domains.

'''Insider trading''' is the trading of a [[public company]]'s [[stock]] or other [[security (finance)|securities]] (such as [[bond (finance)|bonds]] or [[Option (finance)|stock options]]) by individuals with access to nonpublic information about the company. In various countries, some kinds of trading based on insider information is illegal. This is because it is seen as unfair to other investors who do not have access to the information, as the investor with insider information could potentially make larger profits than a typical investor could make.

The authors of one study claim that illegal insider trading raises the cost of capital for securities issuers, thus decreasing overall economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Teaching/BA453_2005/BD_The_world.pdf "The World Price of Insider Trading"] by [[Utpal Bhattacharya]] and [[Hazem Daouk]] in the [[Journal of Finance]], Vol. LVII, No. 1 (February 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; However, some economists, such as [[Henry Manne]], have argued that insider trading should be allowed and could, in fact, benefit markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/07/26/insider-trading-makes-us-richer-better-informed-and-could-prevent-corporate-scandals-legalize-it/|title=Insider trading enriches and informs us, and could prevent scandals. Legalize it.|last=Matthews|first=Dylan|date=2013-07-26|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trading by specific insiders, such as employees, is commonly permitted as long as it does not rely on material information not in the [[public domain]]. Many jurisdictions require that such trading be reported so that the transactions can be monitored. In the United States and several other jurisdictions, trading conducted by corporate officers, key employees, directors, or significant shareholders must be reported to the regulator or publicly disclosed, usually within a few business days of the trade. In these cases, insiders in the United States are required to file a [[Form 4]] with the U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) when buying or selling shares of their own companies.

The rules governing insider trading are complex and vary significantly from country to country. The extent of enforcement also varies from one country to another. The definition of insider in one jurisdiction can be broad, and may cover not only insiders themselves but also any persons related to them, such as brokers, associates and even family members. A person who becomes aware of [[market moving information|non-public information]] and trades on that basis may be guilty of a crime.

==Illegal==
Rules prohibiting or criminalizing insider trading on material non-public information exist in most jurisdictions around the world (Bhattacharya and Daouk, 2002), but the details and the efforts to enforce them vary considerably. In the United States, Sections 16(b) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 directly and indirectly address insider trading. The U.S. Congress enacted this law after the stock market crash of 1929.&lt;ref name=Newkirk/&gt; While the United States is generally viewed as making the most serious efforts to enforce its insider trading laws,&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=967482 "Law and the Market: The Impact of Enforcement"] by John C. Coffee, University of Pennsylvania Law Review (December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; the broader scope of the European model legislation provides a stricter framework against illegal insider trading.&lt;ref name="Masters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ventoruzzo"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Ventoruzzo |first=Marco |date=19 June 2014 |title=Comparing Insider Trading in the US and Europe |publisher=Harvard Law School |url=https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2014/06/19/comparing-insider-trading-in-the-us-and-europe/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630185840/http://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2014/06/19/comparing-insider-trading-in-the-us-and-europe/ |archive-date=30 June 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the European Union and the United Kingdom all trading on non-public information is, under the rubric of [[market abuse]], subject at a minimum to civil penalties and to possible criminal penalties as well.&lt;ref name="Ventoruzzo" /&gt; UK's [[Financial Conduct Authority]] has the responsibility to investigate and prosecute insider dealing, defined by the [[Criminal Justice Act 1993]].

===Definition of "insider"===
In the United States, Canada, Australia and Germany, for mandatory reporting purposes, corporate insiders are defined as a company's officers, directors and any beneficial owners of more than 10% of a class of the company's equity securities. Trades made by these types of insiders in the company's own stock, based on material non-public information, are considered fraudulent since the insiders are violating the fiduciary duty that they owe to the shareholders. The corporate insider, simply by accepting employment, has undertaken a legal obligation to the shareholders to put the shareholders' interests before their own, in matters related to the corporation. When insiders buy or sell based upon company-owned information, they are violating their obligation to the shareholders.

For example, illegal insider trading would occur if the [[chief executive officer]] of Company A learned (prior to a public announcement) that Company A will be taken over and then bought shares in Company A while knowing that the share price would likely rise.

In the United States and many other jurisdictions, however, "insiders" are not just limited to corporate officials and major shareholders where illegal insider trading is concerned but can include any individual who trades shares based on material non-public information in violation of some duty of trust. This duty may be imputed; for example, in many jurisdictions, in cases of where a corporate insider "tips" a friend about non-public information likely to have an effect on the company's share price, the duty the corporate insider owes the company is now imputed to the friend and the friend violates a duty to the company if he trades on the basis of this information.

===Liability===
Liability for inside trading violations generally cannot be avoided by passing on the information in an "I scratch your back; you scratch mine" or [[quid pro quo]] arrangement if the person receiving the information knew or should have known that the information was material non-public information. In the United States, at least one court has indicated that the insider who releases the non-public information must have done so for an improper purpose. In the case of a person who receives the insider information (called the "tippee"), the tippee must also have been aware that the insider released the information for an improper purpose.&lt;ref name="United States v 2014"&gt;''United States v. Newman'', 773 F.3d 438 (2d Cir. 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

One commentator has argued that if Company A's CEO did not trade on the undisclosed [[takeover]] news, but instead passed the information on to his brother-in-law who traded on it, illegal insider trading would still have occurred (albeit by proxy by passing it on to a "non-insider" so Company A's CEO would not get his hands dirty).&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;Larry Harris, Trading &amp; Exchanges, Oxford Press, Oxford, 2003. Chapter 29 "Insider Trading"&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|589}}

===Misappropriation theory===
A newer view of insider trading, the [[misappropriation]] theory, is now accepted in U.S. law. It states that anyone who misappropriates information from his or her employer and trades on that information in ''any'' stock (either the employer's stock or the company's competitor stocks) may be guilty of insider trading.

===Proof of responsibility===
Proving that someone has been responsible for a trade can be difficult because traders may try to hide behind nominees, offshore companies, and other proxies. The [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] prosecutes over 50 cases each year, with many being settled administratively out of court. The SEC and several [[stock exchange]]s actively monitor trading, looking for suspicious activity.&lt;ref name=cox&gt;{{cite web|last=Cox|first=Charles C.|title=The Law of Insider Trading - How they get caught|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1986/112086cox.pdf|publisher=Securities and Exchange Commission|accessdate=March 23, 2014|date=November 20, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levine|first=Matt|title=SEC Insider Trading Investigation Reveals SEC Is Really Good At Insider Trading Investigations, Anyway|url=http://dealbreaker.com/2013/01/sec-insider-trading-investigation-reveals-sec-is-really-good-at-insider-trading-investigations-anyway/|work=Dealbreaker|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Market Surveillance |url=https://www.nyse.com/regulation/memberorganizations/1022221394213.html |publisher=NYSE EuroNext |accessdate=March 23, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624062204/http://www.nyse.com/regulation/memberorganizations/1022221394213.html |archivedate=June 24, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SEC does not have criminal enforcement authority, but can refer serious matters to the U.S. Attorney's Office for further investigation and prosecution.

===Trading on information in general===
In the United States and most non-European jurisdictions not all trading on non-public information is illegal insider trading.&lt;ref name="Ventoruzzo" /&gt; For example, a person in a restaurant who hears the CEO of Company A at the next table tell the CFO that the company's profits will be higher than expected and then buys the stock is not guilty of insider trading—unless he or she had some closer connection to the company or company officers.&lt;ref name="Shell"&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Shell |first=G. Richard |year=2001 |title=When Is It Legal To Trade on Inside Information? |magazine=MIT Sloan Management Review |volume=43 |issue=1 (Fall) |pages=89–90. |url=http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/when-is-it-legal-to-trade-on-inside-information-2/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even where the tippee is not himself an insider, where the tippee knows that the information is non-public and the information is paid for, or the tipper receives a benefit for giving it, then in the broader-scope jurisdictions the subsequent trading is illegal.&lt;ref name="Shell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Savage" /&gt;

Notwithstanding, information about a [[tender offer]] (usually regarding a merger or acquisition) is held to a higher standard. If this type of information is obtained (directly or indirectly) and there is reason to believe it is nonpublic, there is a duty to disclose it or abstain from trading.&lt;ref&gt;17 C.F.R. 240.14e-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The punishment for insider trading depends on a few different factors. There are three main factors, which can be identified. Depending on jurisdictions, there may be either civil or criminal penalties, or both.
*  Scope – How many people were affected by the wrongdoing?
*  Gain – How much did the insider make from the transaction, whether directly or as a tipster? Where there is a tipster and a tippee, how much did the tippee make from the transaction?
*  Evidence – Anyone charged is innocent until proven guilty. The burden of proof falls on the prosecution. If no one "flips", or if there is no smoking gun, the prosecution has a harder time proving guilt. This may result in prosecution moving away from criminal charges, and instead choosing to pursue civil charges.

In the United States in addition to civil penalties, the trader may also be subject to criminal prosecution for fraud or where SEC regulations have been broken, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) may be called to conduct an independent parallel investigation. If the DOJ finds criminal wrongdoing, the Department may file criminal charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raiser|first=Steve|title=Raiser &amp; Kenniff|url=http://www.raiserkenniff.com.php53-5.dfw1-2.websitetestlink.com/insider-trading-when-is-it-civil-or-criminal/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105020113/http://www.raiserkenniff.com.php53-5.dfw1-2.websitetestlink.com/insider-trading-when-is-it-civil-or-criminal/|archivedate=2013-11-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tracking===
Since insiders are required to report their trades, others often track these traders, and there is a school of investing that follows the lead of insiders. Following such leads subjects the follower to the risk that an insider is buying specifically to increase investor confidence, or is selling for reasons unrelated to the health of the company (such as a desire to diversify or pay a personal expense).

==Legal==
Legal trades by insiders are common,&lt;ref name=Newkirk&gt;Thomas Newkirk. (1998). [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speecharchive/1998/spch221.htm Speech by SEC Staff: Insider Trading – A U.S. Perspective]. 16th International Symposium on Economic Crime at Jesus College, Cambridge, England on September 19, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; as employees of [[public company|publicly traded]] [[corporation]]s often have stock or stock options. These trades are made public in the United States through [[SEC filing|Securities and Exchange Commission filings]], mainly [[Form 4]].

U.S. [[SEC Rule 10b5-1]] clarified that the prohibition against insider trading does not require proof that an insider actually used material nonpublic information when conducting a trade; possession of such information alone is sufficient to violate the provision, and the SEC would infer that an insider in possession of material nonpublic information used this information when conducting a trade. However, SEC Rule 10b5-1 also created for insiders an [[affirmative defense]] if the insider can demonstrate that the trades conducted on behalf of the insider were conducted as part of a pre-existing [[contract]] or written binding plan for trading in the future.&lt;ref name=Stein2001&gt;Stuart Stein. (2001). [https://web.archive.org/web/20081218133714/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5344/is_200107/ai_n21474661 New standards for "legal" insider trading].{{dead link|date=September 2014}} ''Community Banker''.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if an insider expects to retire after a specific period of time and, as part of retirement planning, the insider has adopted a written binding plan to sell a specific amount of the company's stock every month for two years, and the insider later comes into possession of material nonpublic information about the company, trades based on the original plan might not constitute prohibited insider trading.

==United States law==
Until the 21st century and the European Union's [[market abuse]] laws, the United States was the leading country in prohibiting insider trading made on the basis of material non-public information.&lt;ref name="Ventoruzzo" /&gt; Thomas Newkirk and Melissa Robertson of the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) summarize the development of US insider trading laws.&lt;ref name=Newkirk/&gt; Insider trading has a base offense level of 8, which puts it in Zone A under the [[U.S. Sentencing Guidelines]]. This means that first-time offenders are eligible to receive probation rather than incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S.S.G. §2B1.4 |url=http://www.ussc.gov/2009guid/2b1_4.htm |postscript={{inconsistent citations}} |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618144017/http://www.ussc.gov/2009guid/2b1_4.htm |archivedate=2010-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statutory===
U.S. insider trading prohibitions are based on English and American common law prohibitions against fraud. In 1909, well before the Securities Exchange Act was passed, the United States Supreme Court ruled that a corporate director who bought that company's stock when he knew the stock's price was about to increase committed fraud by buying but not disclosing his inside information.

Section 15 of the [[Securities Act of 1933]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sa33.pdf |title=Securities Exchange Act of 1933 |format=PDF |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; contained prohibitions of fraud in the sale of securities, later greatly strengthened by the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf |title=Securities Exchange Act of 1934 |format=PDF |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 16(b) of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] prohibits short-swing profits (from any purchases and sales within any six-month period) made by corporate directors, officers, or stockholders owning more than 10% of a firm's shares. Under Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act, [[SEC Rule 10b-5]], prohibits fraud related to securities trading.

The Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984 and the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988 place penalties for illegal insider trading as high as three times the amount of profit gained or loss avoided from the illegal trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomsen LT|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/2006/ts092606lct.htm |title=Testimony Concerning Insider Trading |publisher=SEC|accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SEC regulations===
SEC [[Regulation Fair Disclosure|regulation FD ("Fair Disclosure")]] requires that if a company intentionally discloses material non-public information to one person, it must simultaneously disclose that information to the public at large. In the case of an unintentional disclosure of material non-public information to one person, the company must make a public disclosure "promptly."&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;{{rp|586}}

Insider trading, or similar practices, are also regulated by the SEC under its rules on [[takeover]]s and [[tender offer]]s under the [[Williams Act]].

===Court decisions===
Much of the development of insider trading law has resulted from court decisions.

In 1909, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in ''Strong v. Repide''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/213/419/ |title=Strong v. Repide – 213 U.S. 419 (1909) :: Justia US Supreme Court Center |publisher=Supreme.justia.com |accessdate=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a director who expects to act in a way that affects the value of shares cannot use that knowledge to acquire shares from those who do not know of the expected action. Even though, in general, ordinary relations between directors and shareholders in a business corporation are not of such a fiduciary nature as to make it the duty of a director to disclose to a shareholder general knowledge regarding the value of the shares of the company before he purchases any from a shareholder, some cases involve special facts that impose such duty.

In 1968, the [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] advanced a "level playing field" theory of insider trading in ''SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co.''&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8550821722818303653 Securities and Exchange Com'n v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co.]'', 401 F. 2d 833 (2d Cir. 1968)&lt;/ref&gt; The court stated that anyone in possession of inside information must either disclose the information or refrain from trading. Officers of the [[Texas Gulf Sulfur Company|Texas Gulf Sulphur Company]] had used inside information about the discovery of the [[Kidd Mine]] to make profits by buying shares and call options on company stock.&lt;ref name=brooks&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brooks|first=John|title=A Reasonable Amount of Time|journal=The New Yorker|date=November 9, 1968|pages=160–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in the case of ''Dirks v. Securities and Exchange Commission''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=463&amp;invol=646 |title=FindLaw &amp;#124; Cases and Codes |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |accessdate=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that tippees (receivers of second-hand information) are liable if they had reason to believe that the tipper had breached a fiduciary duty in disclosing confidential information. One such example would be if the tipper received any personal benefit from the disclosure, thereby breaching his or her duty of loyalty to the company. In ''Dirks'', the "tippee" received confidential information from an insider, a former employee of a company. The reason the insider disclosed the information to the tippee, and the reason the tippee disclosed the information to third parties, was to blow the whistle on massive fraud at the company. As a result of the tippee's efforts the fraud was uncovered, and the company went into bankruptcy. But, while the tippee had given the "inside" information to clients who made profits from the information, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the tippee could not be held liable under the federal securities laws—for the simple reason that the insider from whom he received the information was not releasing the information for an improper purpose (a personal benefit), but rather for the purpose of exposing the fraud. The Supreme Court ruled that the tippee could not have been aiding and abetting a securities law violation committed by the insider—for the simple reason that no securities law violation had been committed by the insider.

In ''Dirks'', the Supreme Court also defined the concept of "constructive insiders," who are lawyers, investment bankers and others who receive confidential information from a corporation while providing services to the corporation. Constructive insiders are also liable for insider trading violations if the corporation expects the information to remain confidential, since they acquire the fiduciary duties of the true insider.

The next expansion of insider trading liability came in ''SEC vs. Materia''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leagle.com/decision/1984942745F2d197_1924.xml/S.E.C.%20v.%20MATERIA |title=S.E.C. V. Materia |publisher=Leagle.com |accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 745 F.2d 197 (2d Cir. 1984), the case that first introduced the misappropriation theory of liability for insider trading. Materia, a financial printing firm proofreader, and clearly not an insider by any definition, was found to have determined the identity of takeover targets based on proofreading tender offer documents during his employment. After a two-week trial, the district court found him liable for insider trading, and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed holding that the theft of information from an employer, and the use of that information to purchase or sell securities in another entity, constituted a fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of a securities. The misappropriation theory of insider trading was born, and liability further expanded to encompass a larger group of outsiders.

In ''United States v. Carpenter''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=484&amp;invol=19 |title=FindLaw &amp;#124; Cases and Codes |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |accessdate=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1986) the U.S. Supreme Court cited an earlier ruling while unanimously upholding mail and wire fraud convictions for a defendant who received his information from a journalist rather than from the company itself. The journalist [[R. Foster Winans]] was also convicted, on the grounds that he had misappropriated information belonging to his employer, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''. In that widely publicized case, Winans traded in advance of "Heard on the Street" columns appearing in the Journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Christopher |last=Cox |authorlink=Christopher Cox |publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission |url=https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch050106cc.htm |title=Speech by SEC Chairman: Remarks at the Annual Meeting of the Society of American Business Editors and Writers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court stated in ''Carpenter'': "It is well established, as a general proposition, that a person who acquires special knowledge or information by virtue of a confidential or fiduciary relationship with another is not free to exploit that knowledge or information for his own personal benefit but must account to his principal for any profits derived therefrom."

However, in upholding the securities fraud (insider trading) convictions, the justices were evenly split.

In 1997, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] adopted the misappropriation theory of insider trading in ''United States v. O'Hagan'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/96-842.ZO.html |title=United States v. O'Hagan, 117 S.Ct. 2199, 138 L.Ed.2d 724 (1997) |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |accessdate=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 521 U.S. 642, 655 (1997). O'Hagan was a partner in a law firm representing [[Diageo|Grand Metropolitan]], while it was considering a tender offer for [[Pillsbury Company]]. O'Hagan used this inside information by buying call options on Pillsbury stock, resulting in profits of over $4.3 million. O'Hagan claimed that neither he nor his firm owed a fiduciary duty to Pillsbury, so he did not commit fraud by purchasing Pillsbury options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.com/regionals/ca/briefing/wilson/wilson21.html |title=Law.com |publisher=Law.com |date=June 25, 1997 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court rejected O'Hagan's arguments and upheld his conviction.

The "misappropriation theory" holds that a person commits fraud "in connection with" a securities transaction and thereby violates 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, when he misappropriates confidential information for securities trading purposes, in breach of a duty owed to the source of the information. Under this theory, a fiduciary's undisclosed, self-serving use of a principal's information to purchase or sell securities, in breach of a duty of loyalty and confidentiality, defrauds the principal of the exclusive use of the information. In lieu of premising liability on a fiduciary relationship between company insider and purchaser or seller of the company's stock, the misappropriation theory premises liability on a fiduciary-turned-trader's deception of those who entrusted him with access to confidential information.

The Court specifically recognized that a corporation's information is its property: "A company's confidential information ... qualifies as property to which the company has a right of exclusive use. The undisclosed misappropriation of such information in violation of a fiduciary duty ... constitutes fraud akin to embezzlement – the fraudulent appropriation to one's own use of the money or goods entrusted to one's care by another."

In 2000, the SEC enacted [[SEC Rule 10b5-1]], which defined trading "on the basis of" inside information as any time a person trades while aware of material nonpublic information. It is no longer a defense for one to say that one would have made the trade anyway. The rule also created an [[affirmative defense]] for pre-planned trades.

In 2014, in the case of ''United States v. Newman'', the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit cited the Supreme Court's decision in ''Dirks'', and ruled that for a "tippee" (a person who used information they received from an insider) to be guilty of insider trading, the tippee must have been aware not only that the information was insider information, but must also have been aware that the insider released the information for an improper purpose (such as a personal benefit). The Court concluded that the insider's breach of a fiduciary duty not to release confidential information—in the absence of an improper purpose on the part of the insider—is not enough to impose criminal liability on either the insider or the tippee.&lt;ref name="United States v 2014"/&gt;

In 2016, in the case of ''Salman v. United States'', the U.S. Supreme Court held that the benefit a tipper must receive as predicate for an insider-trader prosecution of a tippee need not be pecuniary, and that giving a 'gift' of a tip to a family member is presumptively an act for the personal though intangible benefit of the tipper.&lt;ref name="Savage"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Savage |first=David G. |date=6 December 2016 |title=Supreme Court affirms broad reach of insider-trading laws |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-supreme-court-insider-trading-20161206-story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207135034/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-supreme-court-insider-trading-20161206-story.html |archive-date=7 December 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===By members of Congress===
Members of the [[US Congress]] are exempt from the laws that ban insider trading. Because they generally do not have a confidential relationship with the source of the information they receive, however, they do not meet the usual definition of an "insider." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-57323527/congress-trading-stock-on-inside-information/ Congress: Trading stock on inside information?], CBS News, November 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; House of Representatives rules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oce.house.gov/pdf/2008_House_Ethics_Manual.pdf |title=House Ethics Manual (2008) |format=PDF |accessdate=December 21, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118033300/http://oce.house.gov/pdf/2008_House_Ethics_Manual.pdf |archive-date=2012-01-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; may however consider congressional insider trading unethical.

In May 2007, a bill entitled the "Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, or [[STOCK Act]]" was introduced that would hold congressional and federal employees liable for stock trades they made using information they gained through their jobs and also regulate analysts or "Political Intelligence" firms that research government activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Gross |authorlink=Daniel Gross |title=Insider Trading, Congressional-Style |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2166664/fr/rss/%20slate.com |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]] |date=May 21, 2007 |accessdate=May 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 [[STOCK Act]] was passed on April 4, 2012.

===With Congress-sourced information===

In 2014, federal prosecutors issued a subpoena to the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|House Ways and Means committee]] and Brian Sutter, staff director of its health-care sub-committee, relative to a price move in stocks just prior to the passage of a law favorable to the companies involved. An e-mail was sent out by a "Washington-based policy-research firm that predicted the change [in the law] for its Wall Street clients. That alert, in turn, was based in part on information provided to the firm by a former congressional health-care aide turned lobbyist, according to emails reviewed by the ''[Wall Street] Journal''" in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Mullins, Brody, and Andrew Ackerman, [http://www.marketwatch.com/story/prosecutors-subpoena-congress-in-trading-probe-2014-06-18 "Prosecutors subpoena Congress in trading probe"], ''[[MarketWatch]]'', June 18, 2014. Retrieved June 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security analysis==
[[Security analysis|Security analysts]] gather and compile information, talk to corporate officers and other insiders, and issue recommendations to traders. Thus their activities may easily cross legal lines if they are not especially careful. The [[CFA Institute]] in its code of ethics states that analysts should make every effort to make all reports available to all the broker's clients on a timely basis. Analysts should never report material nonpublic information, except in an effort to make that information available to the general public. Nevertheless, analysts' reports may contain a variety of information that is "pieced together" without violating insider trading laws, under the [[Mosaic theory (investments)|Mosaic theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mosaictheory.asp |title=Investopedia.com – Mosaic Theory |publisher=Investopedia.com |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This information may include non-material nonpublic information as well as material public information, which may increase in value when properly compiled and documented.

==Arguments for legalizing==
Some economists and legal scholars (such as [[Henry Manne]], [[Milton Friedman]], [[Thomas Sowell]], [[Daniel Fischel]], and [[Frank H. Easterbrook]]) have argued that laws against insider trading should be repealed. They claim that insider trading based on material nonpublic information benefits investors, in general, by more quickly introducing new information into the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-altucher/should-insider-trading-be_b_324409.html |title=James Altucher: Should Insider Trading Be Made Legal? |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=October 20, 2009|accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedman, laureate of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]], said: "You want more insider trading, not less. You want to give the people most likely to have knowledge about deficiencies of the company an incentive to make the public aware of that." Friedman did not believe that the trader should be required to make his trade known to the public, because the buying or selling pressure itself is information for the market.&lt;ref name="Harris" /&gt;{{rp|591–7}}

Other critics argue that insider trading is a victimless act: a willing buyer and a willing seller agree to trade property that the seller rightfully owns, with no prior contract (according to this view) having been made between the parties to refrain from trading if there is [[asymmetric information]]. [[The Atlantic]] has described the process as "arguably the closest thing that modern finance has to a victimless crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/11/capitol-gains/8692/ |title=Capitol Gains – Magazine |publisher=The Atlantic |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legalization advocates also question why "trading" where one party has more information than the other is legal in other markets, such as [[real estate]], but not in the stock market. For example, if a [[geology|geologist]] knows there is a high likelihood of the discovery of [[petroleum]] under Farmer Smith's land, he may be entitled to make Smith an offer for the land, and buy it, without first telling Farmer Smith of the geological data.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} 

Advocates of legalization make free speech arguments. Punishment for communicating about a development pertinent to the next day's stock price might seem an act of censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walterblock.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/information_privilege.pdf |title="Information, Privilege, Opportunity, and Insider Trading" in the Northern Illinois University Law Review |format=PDF |accessdate=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the information being conveyed is proprietary information and the corporate insider has contracted to not expose it, he has no more right to communicate it than he would to tell others about the company's confidential new product designs, formulas, or bank account passwords.

Some authors have used these arguments to propose legalizing insider trading on negative information (but not on positive information). Since negative information is often withheld from the market, trading on such information has a higher value for the market than trading on positive information.&lt;ref&gt;Kristoffel Grechenig, The Marginal Incentive of Insider Trading: An Economic Reinterpretation of the Case Law, University of Memphis Law Review 2006, vol. 37,  p. 75-148 [http://ssrn.com/abstract=883642 (link)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macey, Jonathan. "Getting the word out about fraud: a theoretical analysis of whistleblowing and insider trading." Michigan Law Review (2007): 1899-1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are very limited laws against "insider trading" in the commodities markets if, for no other reason than that the concept of an "insider" is not immediately analogous to commodities themselves (corn, wheat, steel, etc.). However, analogous activities such as [[front running]] are illegal under US commodity and futures trading laws. For example, a [[commodity broker]] can be charged with fraud by receiving  a large purchase order from a client (one likely to affect the price of that commodity) and then purchasing that commodity before executing the client's order to benefit from the anticipated price increase.

==Commercialisation==
The advent of the Internet has provided a forum for the [[commercialisation]] of trading on insider information. In 2016 a number of [[dark web]] sites were identified as marketplaces where such non-public information was bought and sold. At least one such site used [[bitcoin]]s to avoid currency restrictions and to impede tracking. Such sites also provide a place for soliciting for corporate informants, where non-public information may be used for purposes&lt;ref&gt;Such purposes include [[competitor analysis]] for [[competitive advantage]], providing a basis for [[sabotage]], and gaining advantage in [[Intragroup conflict|internicine feuding]].&lt;/ref&gt; other than stock trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Uchill |first=Joe |date=1 February 2017 |title=Report: Leakers sell inside trading tips on dark web |newspaper=The Hill |url=http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/317377-report-leakers-sell-inside-trading-tips-on-dark-web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214195423/http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/317377-report-leakers-sell-inside-trading-tips-on-dark-web |archive-date=14 February 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal differences among jurisdictions==
The US and the UK vary in the way the law is interpreted and applied with regard to insider trading. In the UK, the relevant laws are the [[Criminal Justice Act 1993]], Part V, Schedule 1; the [[Financial Services and Markets Act 2000]], which defines an offence of "[[Market Abuse]]";&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kern |first=Alexander |title=Insider Dealing and Market Abuse: The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 |publisher=Centre for Business Research, University of Cambridge |date=December 2001 |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/7151265.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215195343/https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/7151265.pdf |archive-date=15 February 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the European Union Regulation No 596/2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on market abuse |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32014R0596 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Market abuse |publisher=Financial Conduct Authority (FCU) |url=https://www.fca.org.uk/markets/market-abuse |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109173744/https://www.fca.org.uk/markets/market-abuse |archive-date=9 November 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle is that it is illegal to trade on the basis of market-sensitive information that is not generally known.  This is a much broader scope that under U.S. law. The key differences from U.S. law are that no relationship to either the issuer of the security or the tipster is required; all that is required is that the guilty party traded (or caused trading) whilst having inside information, and there is no [[scienter]] requirement under UK law.&lt;ref name="Masters"&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Masters |first1=Brooke |last2=McCrum |first2=Dan |date=26 January 2012 |title=Gulf between US and UK ‘insider trading’ |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |url=https://www.ft.com/content/d2f943ae-4811-11e1-a4e5-00144feabdc0 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Market Abuse) – Regulations 2016 |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/680/pdfs/uksi_20160680_en.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214202307/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/680/pdfs/uksi_20160680_en.pdf |archive-date=14 February 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first1=Caroline |last1=Binham |first2=Martin |last2=Arnold |title=Bank of England governor Mark Carney to extend market abuse rules

Japan enacted its first law against insider trading in 1988. Roderick Seeman said, "Even today many Japanese do not understand why this is illegal. Indeed, previously it was regarded as common sense to make a profit from your knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japanlaw.info/law2004/JAPANBIZLAWLITE4GAIJIN_INSIDER_TRADING.html |title=Japanlaw.info |publisher=Japanlaw.info |accessdate=December 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309184123/http://www.japanlaw.info/law2004/JAPANBIZLAWLITE4GAIJIN_INSIDER_TRADING.html |archivedate=March 9, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Organization of Securities Commissions]] (IOSCO) paper on the "Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation" (updated to 2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD154.pdf |title=Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation |publisher=[[International Organization of Securities Commissions]] (IOSCO) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050829080215/http://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD154.pdf |archive-date=29 August 2005 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that the three objectives of good securities market regulation are:
# Investor protection,
# Insuring that markets are fair, efficient and transparent, and
# Reducing [[systemic risk]].

The discussion of these "Core Principles" state that "investor protection" in this context means "Investors should be protected from misleading, manipulative or fraudulent practices, including insider trading, [[front running]] or trading ahead of customers and the misuse of client assets." More than 85 percent of the world's securities and commodities market regulators are members of IOSCO and have signed on to these Core Principles.

The [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]] now use the IOSCO Core Principles in reviewing the financial health of different country's regulatory systems as part of these organization's financial sector assessment program, so laws against insider trading based on non-public information are now expected by the international community. Enforcement of insider trading laws varies widely from country to country, but the vast majority of jurisdictions now outlaw the practice, at least in principle.

Larry Harris claims that differences in the effectiveness with which countries restrict insider trading help to explain the differences in [[executive compensation]] among those countries. The US, for example, has much higher CEO salaries than do Japan or Germany, where insider trading is less effectively restrained.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;{{rp|593}}

===European Union===
In 2014, the European Union (EU) adopted legislation (Criminal Sanctions for Market Abuse Directive) that harmonises criminal sanctions for insider dealing. All EU Member States agreed to introduce maximum prison sentences of at least four years for serious cases of market manipulation and insider dealing, and at least two years for improper disclosure of insider information.&lt;ref&gt;Hauck, P., Europe’s commitment to countering insider dealing and market manipulation on the basis of Art. 83 para. 2 TFEU

Although insider trading in the UK has been illegal since 1980, it proved difficult to successfully prosecute individuals accused of insider trading. There were a number of notorious cases where individuals were able to escape prosecution. Instead the UK regulators relied on a series of fines to punish market abuses.

These fines were widely perceived as an ineffective deterrent (Cole, 2007),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cole|first=Margaret|title=Insider dealing in the City|url=http://www.fsa.gov.uk/library/communication/speeches/2007/0317_mc.shtml|work=Financial Services Authority|accessdate=December 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there was a statement of intent by the UK regulator (the Financial Services Authority) to use its powers to enforce the legislation (specifically the [[Financial Services and Markets Act 2000]]). Between 2009–2012 the FSA secured 14 convictions in relation to insider dealing.

===India===
Insider Trading in India is an offense according to Section 195 of the Companies Act, 2013 and Sections 12A, 15G of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992. Insider trading is when one with access to non public, price sensitive information about the securities of the company subscribes, buys, sells or deals, or agrees to do so or counsels another to do as principal or agent. Price sensitive information is information that materially affects the value of the securities.
The penalty for insider trading is imprisonment, which may extend to five years, and a minimum of five lakh rupees (five hundred thousand) to twenty five crore rupees (two hundred and fifty million) or three times the profit made, whichever is higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite |title=The Companies Act |year=2013 |publisher=Ministry Of Corporate Affairs, Government of India |url=http://www.mca.gov.in/Ministry/pdf/CompaniesAct2013.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205215453/http://mca.gov.in/Ministry/pdf/CompaniesAct2013.pdf |archive-date=5 December 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Standards for Legal Insider Trading====
Insider trading is legal as long as disclosure of the holdings and trading in securities of the company is done by the insiders. Any other connected person or group of connected persons shall also disclose their holdings under this regulation.

The gist of these rules is that an insider cannot trade on non-public information until that information is disclosed, and cannot tip people off using non-public information.

===== SEBI Guidelines For Disclosures of Trading by Insiders=====
1. Promoters, key managerial personnel and director of every company whose securities are listed on any recognized exchange shall disclose his holding of securities within 30 days of these regulations taking effect to the company.

2. Every person on appointment as key managerial personnel, director of the company or upon becoming a promoter shall disclose his holding of securities of company within 7 days of such appointment to the company.

3. Every promoter, director or employee of the company shall disclose to the company, the number of securities acquired or disposed of within two days of such transaction, if the value of securities traded  through one transaction or series of transaction in a calendar quarter exceeds 10 lakh rupees or any other value as may be prescribed.

4. Company needs to inform within two days of receipt of such disclosure to the stock exchange.

5. Disclosure by the connected person shall be made as required by the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Insider Trading |url=http://adityatrading.in/insider-trading.aspx|date=February 14, 2017|work=[[Aditya Trading Solutions]] |accessdate=February 14, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Labeling theory''' is the theory of how the [[self-identity]] and behavior of individuals may be determined or influenced by the terms used to describe or classify them.  It is associated with the concepts of [[self-fulfilling prophecy]] and [[stereotype|stereotyping]]. Labeling theory holds that [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]] is not inherent to an act, but instead focuses on the tendency of majorities to negatively label minorities or those seen as deviant from standard [[cultural norm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Labeling theory: Social constructionism, Social stigma, Deinstitutionalisation, George Herbert Mead, Howard S. Becker, Labelling&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was prominent during the 1960s and 1970s, and some modified versions of the theory have developed and are still currently popular. A stigma is defined as a powerfully negative label that changes a person's self-concept and [[social identity]].&lt;ref name="Macionis"&gt;{{harvp|Macionis|Gerber|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labeling theory is closely related to [[social constructionism|social-construction]] and [[symbolic interactionism|symbolic-interaction]] analysis.&lt;ref name="Macionis"/&gt;  Labeling theory was developed by [[sociologist]]s during the 1960s. [[Howard S. Becker|Howard Saul Becker's]] book ''Outsiders'' was extremely influential in the development of this theory and its rise to popularity.

==Theoretical basis==
Labeling theory had its origins in ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'', a book by French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]]. He found that crime is not so much a violation of a penal code as it is an act that outrages society. He was the first to suggest that deviant labeling satisfies that function and satisfies society's need to control the behavior.

As a contributor to [[American Pragmatism]] and later a member of the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]], [[George Herbert Mead]] posited that the self is socially constructed and reconstructed through the interactions which each person has with the [[community]]. The labeling theory suggests that people obtain labels from how others view their tendencies or behaviors. Each individual is aware of how they are judged by others because he or she has attempted many different roles and functions in social interactions and has been able to gauge the reactions of those present.

This theoretically builds a subjective conception of the self, but as others intrude into the reality of that individual's life, this represents objective data which may require a re-evaluation of that conception depending on the authoritativeness of the others' judgment. [[Family]] and [[friend]]s may judge differently from random strangers. More socially representative individuals such as [[police officer]]s or [[judge]]s may be able to make more globally respected judgments. If deviance is a failure to conform to the rules observed by most of the group, the reaction of the group is to label the person as having offended against their social or moral norms of behavior. This is the power of the group: to designate breaches of their rules as deviant and to treat the person differently depending on the seriousness of the breach. The more differential the treatment, the more the individual's [[self-image]] is affected.

Labeling theory concerns itself mostly not with the normal roles that define our lives, but with those very special roles that society provides for [[social deviance|deviant behavior]], called deviant roles, stigmatic roles, or [[social stigma]]. A social role is a set of expectations we have about a behavior. Social roles are necessary for the organization and functioning of any society or group. We expect the postman, for example, to adhere to certain fixed rules about how he does his job. "Deviance" for a sociologist does not mean morally wrong, but rather behavior that is condemned by society. Deviant behavior can include both criminal and non-criminal activities.

Investigators found that deviant roles powerfully affect how we perceive those who are assigned those roles. They also affect how the deviant actor perceives himself and his relationship to society. The deviant roles and the labels attached to them function as a form of social stigma. Always inherent in the deviant role is the attribution of some form of "pollution" or difference that marks the labeled person as different from others. Society uses these stigmatic roles to them to control and limit deviant behavior: "If you proceed in this behavior, you will become a member of that group of people."

Whether a breach of a given rule will be stigmatized will depend on the significance of the [[morality|moral]] or other tenet it represents. For example, [[adultery]] may be considered a breach of an informal rule or it may be [[criminalize]]d depending on the status of [[marriage]], morality, and [[religion]] within the community. In most Western countries, adultery is not a crime. Attaching the label "adulterer" may have some unfortunate consequences but they are not generally severe. But in some Islamic countries, [[zina (Arabic)|zina]] is a crime and proof of extramarital activity may lead to severe consequences for all concerned.

Stigma is usually the result of laws enacted against the behavior. Laws protecting slavery or outlawing homosexuality, for instance, will over time form deviant roles connected with those behaviors. Those who are assigned those roles will be seen as less human and reliable. Deviant roles are the sources of negative [[stereotype]]s, which tend to support society's disapproval of the behavior.

One of the founders of social [[interactionism]], [[George Herbert Mead]] focused on the internal processes of how the mind constructs one's self-image. In ''Mind, Self, and Society'' (1934),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mead|1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; he showed how infants come to know ''persons'' first and only later come to know ''things''. According to Mead, thought is both a ''social'' and ''[[pragmaticism|pragmatic]]'' process, based on the model of two persons discussing how to solve a problem. Mead's central concept is the self, the part of an individual's personality composed of self-awareness and self-image.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Macionis|2012|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our self-image is, in fact, constructed of ideas about what we think others are thinking about us. While we make fun of those who visibly talk to themselves, they have only failed to do what the rest of us do in keeping the internal conversation to ourselves. Human behavior, Mead stated, is the result of meanings created by the social interaction of conversation, both real and imaginary.

===Thomas Scheff===
[[Thomas J. Scheff]], Professor, Emeritus, Dept of Sociology, UCSB, published the book Being Mentally III: A Sociological Theory (1966).
According to Scheff society has perceptions about people with mental illness. He stated that everyone in the society learns the stereotyped imagery of mental disorder through ordinary social interaction. From childhood, people learn to use terms like “crazy”, “loony”, “nuts” and associated them with them with disturbed behaviors. The media also contributes to this bias against mentally ill patients by associating them with violent crimes. Scheff believes that mental illness is a label given to a person who has a behavior which is away from the social norms of the society and is treated as a social deviance in the society. Once a person is given a label of “mentally ill person”, s/he receives a set of uniform responses from the society, which are generally negative in nature. These responses from the society compel to the person to take the role of a “mentally ill person” as s/he starts internalizing the same. When the individual takes on the role of being mentally ill as her/his central identity, s/he becomes a stable mental ill person. Chronic mental illness is thus a social role and the societal reaction is the most determinant of one’s entry into this role of chronically ill. 
According to Scheff hospitalization of a mentally ill person further reinforces this social role and forces her/him to take this role as her/his self-perception. Once the person is institutionalized for mental disorder, s/he has been publicly labeled as “crazy” and forced to become a member of a deviant social group. It then becomes difficult for a deviant person to return to her/his former level of functioning as the status of ‘patient’ causes unfavorable evaluations by self and by others.

===Frank Tannenbaum===
[[Frank Tannenbaum]] is considered the grandfather of labeling theory. His ''Crime and Community'' (1938),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tannenbaum|1938}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing the social interaction involved in crime, is considered a pivotal foundation of modern criminology. While the criminal differs little or not at all from others in the original impulse to first commit a crime, social interaction accounts for continued acts that develop a pattern of interest to sociologists.

Tannenbaum first introduced the idea of 'tagging'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|O'Grady|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While conducting his studies with delinquent youth, he found that a negative tag or label often contributed to further involvement in delinquent activities. This initial tagging may cause the individual to adopt it as part of their identity. The crux of Tannenbaum's argument is that the greater the attention placed on this label, the more likely the person is to identify themselves as the label.

Kerry Townsend writes about the revolution in criminology caused by Tannenbaum's work:

:"The roots of Frank Tannenbaum's theoretical model, known as the "dramatization of evil" or labeling theory, surfaces in the mid- to late-thirties. At this time, the 'New Deal' legislation had not defeated the woes of the Great Depression, and, although dwindling, immigration into the United States continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sumner|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social climate was one of disillusionment with the government. The class structure was one of cultural isolationism; cultural relativity had not yet taken hold. 'The persistence of the class structure, despite the welfare reforms and controls over big business, was unmistakable.'&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sumner|1994|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Positivist School of Criminological thought was still dominant, and in many states, the sterilization movement was underway. The emphasis on biological determinism and internal explanations of crime were the preeminent force in the theories of the early thirties. This dominance by the Positivist School changed in the late thirties with the introduction of conflict and social explanations of crime and criminality...

:"One of the central tenets of the theory is to encourage the end of labeling process. In the words of Frank Tannenbaum, "the way out is through a refusal to dramatize the evil", the justice system attempts to do this through diversion programs. The growth of the theory and its current application, both practical and theoretical, provide a solid foundation for continued popularity.":&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, F. ''Frank Tannenbaum: The Dramatization of Evil''. {{cite web |url=http://www.criminology.fsu.edu/crimtheory/tannenbaum.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426080156/http://www.criminology.fsu.edu/crimtheory/tannenbaum.htm |archivedate=2009-04-26 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edwin Lemert===
It was sociologist [[Edwin Lemert]] (1951) who introduced the concept of "[[secondary deviance]]". The primary deviance is the experience connected to the overt behavior, say drug addiction and its practical demands and consequences. Secondary deviation is the role created to deal with society's condemnation of the behavior of a person.

With other sociologists of his time, Lemert saw how all deviant acts are social acts, a result of the cooperation of society. In studying drug addiction, Lemert observed a very powerful and subtle force at work. Besides the physical addiction to the drug and all the economic and social disruptions it caused, there was an intensely intellectual process at work concerning one's own identity and the justification for the behavior: "I do these things because I am this way."

There might be certain subjective and personal motives that might first lead a person to drink or shoplift. But the activity itself tells us little about the person's self-image or its relationship to the activity. Lemert writes: "His acts are repeated and organized subjectively and transformed into active roles and become the social criteria for assigning status.....When a person begins to employ his deviant behavior or a role based on it as a means of defense, attack, or adjustment to the overt and covert problems created by the consequent societal reaction to him, his deviation is secondary".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lemert|1951|pp=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Howard Becker===
While it was Lemert who introduced the key concepts of labeling theory, it was [[Howard S. Becker|Howard Becker]] who became their successor. He first began describing the process of how a person adopts a deviant role in a study of dance musicians, with whom he once worked. He later studied the identity formation of marijuana smokers. This study was the basis of his ''Outsiders'' published in 1963. This work became the manifesto of the labeling theory movement among sociologists. In his opening, Becker writes:

:"...''social groups create deviance by making rules whose infraction creates deviance'', and by applying those rules to particular people and labeling them as outsiders. From this point of view, deviance is ''not'' a quality of the act the person commits, but rather a consequence of the application by other of rules and sanctions to an 'offender.' The deviant is one to whom that label has been successfully applied; deviant behavior is behavior that people so label."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Becker|1973|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While society uses the stigmatic label to justify its condemnation, the deviant actor uses it to justify his actions. He wrote: "To put a complex argument in a few words: instead of the deviant motives leading to the deviant behavior, it is the other way around, the deviant behavior in time produces the deviant motivation."&lt;ref name="Becker_26"&gt;{{harvp|Becker|1973|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Becker's immensely popular views were also subjected to a barrage of criticism, most of it blaming him for neglecting the influence of other biological, genetic effects and personal responsibility. In a later 1973 edition of his work, he answered his critics. He wrote that sociologists, while dedicated to studying society, are often careful not to look too closely. Instead, he wrote: "I prefer to think of what we study as ''collective action.'' People act, as Mead and Blumer have made clearest, ''together''. They do what they do with an eye on what others have done, are doing now, and may do in the future. One tries to fit his own line of action into the actions of others, just as each of them likewise adjusts his own developing actions to what he sees and expects others to do."&lt;ref name="Becker_26"/&gt;

Francis Cullen reported in 1984 that Becker was probably too generous with his critics. After 20 years, his views, far from being supplanted, have been corrected and absorbed into an expanded "structuring perspective".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cullen|1984|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albert Memmi===
In ''The Colonizer and the Colonized'' (1965) [[Albert Memmi]] described the deep psychological effects of the social stigma created by the domination of one group by another. He wrote:

:"The longer the oppression lasts, the more profoundly it affects him (the oppressed). It ends by becoming so familiar to him that he believes it is part of his own constitution, that he accepts it and could not imagine his recovery from it. This acceptance is the crowning point of oppression."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Memmi|1965|pp=321–322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Dominated Man'' (1968), Memmi turned his attention to the motivation of stigmatic labeling: it justifies the exploitation or criminalization of the victim. He wrote:

:"Why does the accuser feel obliged to accuse in order to justify himself? ''Because he feels guilty toward his victim.'' Because he feels that his attitude and his behavior are essentially unjust and fraudulent....Proof? ''In almost every case, the punishment has already been inflicted''. The victim of racism is already living under the weight of disgrace and oppression.... In order to justify such punishment and misfortune, a process of rationalization is set in motion, by which to explain the ghetto and colonial exploitation."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Memmi|1968|pp=191–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to stigmatic labeling is the attribution of an inherent fault: It is as if one says, "There must be something wrong with these people. Otherwise, why would we treat them so badly?"

===Erving Goffman===
Perhaps the most important contributor to labeling theory was [[Erving Goffman]], President of the American Sociological Association, and one of America's most cited sociologists. His most popular books include ''[[The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Interaction Ritual'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Frame Analysis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His most important contribution to labeling theory, however, was ''Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity'' published in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other authors who examined the process of adopting a deviant identity, Goffman explored the ways people managed that identity and controlled information about it.

Among Goffman's key insights were the following:
* The modern nation state's heightened demand for normalcy. Today's stigmas are the result not so much of ancient or religious prohibitions, but of a new demand for normalcy. He wrote: "The notion of the 'normal human being' may have its source in the medical approach to humanity, or in the tendency of large-scale bureaucratic organizations such as the nation state, to treat all members in some respects as equal. Whatever its origins, it seems to provide the basic imagery through which laymen currently conceive themselves.''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1963|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Living in a divided world. Deviants divide their worlds into 1. forbidden places where discovery means exposure and danger, 2. places where people of that kind are painfully tolerated, and 3. places where one's kind is exposed without need to dissimulate or conceal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1963|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dealing with others is fraught with great complexity and ambiguity. He wrote: "When normals and stigmatized do in fact enter one another's immediate presence, especially when they attempt to maintain a joint conversational encounter, there occurs one of the primal scenes of sociology; for, in many cases, these moments will be the ones when the causes and effects of stigma will be directly confronted by both sides....&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1963|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; "What are unthinking routines for normals can become management problems for the discreditable....The person with a secret failing, then, must be alive to the social situation as a scanner of possibilities, and is therefore likely to be alienated from the simpler world in which those around them apparently dwell."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1963|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Society's demands are filled with contradictions. On the one hand, a stigmatized person may be told that he is no different from others. On the other hand, he must declare his status as "a resident alien who stands for his group."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1963|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It requires that the stigmatized individual cheerfully and unselfconsciously accept himself as essentially the same as normals, while at the same time he voluntarily withholds himself from those situations in which normals would find it difficult to give lip service to their similar acceptance of him..." One has to convey the impression that the burden of the stigma is not too heavy yet keep himself at the required distance. "A ''phantom acceptance'' is allowed to provide the base for a ''phantom normalcy."''&lt;ref name="harvp|Goffman|1963|p=122"&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1963|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Familiarity need not reduce contempt. In spite of the common belief that openness and exposure will decrease stereotypes and repression, the opposite is true. "Thus, whether we interact with strangers or intimates, we will still find that the fingertips of society have reached bluntly into the contact, even here putting us in our place."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1963|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===David Matza===
In ''On Becoming Deviant'' (1969),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Matza|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; sociologist David Matza gives the most vivid and graphic account of the process of adopting a deviant role. The acts of authorities in outlawing a proscribed behavior can have two effects, keeping most out of the behavior, but also offering new opportunities for creating deviant identities. He says the concept of "affinity" does little to explain the dedication to the behavior. "Instead, it may be regarded as a natural biographical tendency born of personal and social circumstances that suggests but hardly compels a direction or movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Matza|1969|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; What gives force to that movement is the development of a new identity. He writes:

:"To be cast as a thief, as a prostitute, or more generally, a deviant, is to further compound and hasten the process of becoming that very thing...."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Matza|1969|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; In shocked discovery, the subject now concretely understands that there are serious people who really go around building their lives around his activities--stopping him, correcting him, devoted to him. They keep records on the course of his life, even develop theories on how he got that way.... Pressed by such a display, the subject may begin to add meaning and gravity to his deviant activities. But he may do so in a way not especially intended by agents of the state...."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Matza|1969|pp=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The meaningful issue of identity is whether this activity, or any of my activities can stand for me, or be regarded as proper indications of my being. I have done a theft, been signified a thief. ''am'' I a thief? To answer affirmatively, we must be able to conceive a special relationship between being and doing--a unity capable of being indicated. That building of meaning has a notable quality."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Matza|1969|pp=165–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The "criminal" ==
{{Criminology and penology |theory}}

As an application of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], the theory hypothesizes that the labels applied to individuals influence their behavior, particularly the application of negative or stigmatizing labels (such as "[[criminal]]" or "[[Felony|felon]]") promote [[Deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]], becoming a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]], i.e. an individual who is labeled has little choice but to conform to the essential meaning of that judgment. Consequently, labeling theory postulates that it is possible to prevent social deviance via a limited social shaming reaction in "labelers" and replacing [[Morality|moral]] indignation with [[Toleration|tolerance]]. Emphasis is placed on the [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] of offenders through an alteration of their label(s). Related prevention policies include client [[empowerment]] schemes, [[mediation]] and [[conciliation]], victim-offender [[forgiveness]] ceremonies (restorative justice), [[restitution]], [[Reparation (legal)|reparation]], and alternatives to prison programs involving [[Hobby|diversion]]. Labeling theory has been accused of promoting impractical policy implications, and criticized for failing to explain society's most serious offenses.&lt;ref name="Vito1"&gt;{{harvp|Vito|Maahs|Holmes|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some offenses, including the use of violence, are universally recognized as wrong. Hence, labeling either habitual criminals or those who have caused serious harm as "criminals" is not constructive. Society may use more ''specific'' labels such as "[[murder]]er" or "[[rapist]]" or "[[child abuse]]r" to demonstrate more clearly after the event the extent of its disapproval, but there is a slightly mechanical determinism in asserting that the application of a label will invariably modify the behavior of the one labeled. Further, if one of the functions of the penal system is to reduce [[recidivism]], applying a long-term label may cause prejudice against the offender, resulting in the inability to maintain employment and social relationships.

==The "mentally ill"==
The social construction of [[deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]] plays an important role in the labeling process that occurs in society. This process involves not only the labeling of criminally deviant behavior, which is behavior that does not fit socially constructed norms, but also labeling that which reflects stereotyped or stigmatized behavior of the "mentally ill". Labeling theory was first applied to the term "[[mentally ill]]" in 1966 when [[Thomas J. Scheff]] published ''Being Mentally Ill''. Scheff challenged common perceptions of [[mental illness]] by claiming that mental illness is manifested solely as a result of societal influence. He argued that society views certain actions as [[deviant]] and, in order to come to terms with and understand these actions, often places the label of mental illness on those who exhibit them. Certain expectations are then placed on these individuals and, over time, they unconsciously change their behavior to fulfill them. Criteria for different mental illnesses are not consistently fulfilled by those who are diagnosed with them because all of these people suffer from the same disorder, they are simply fulfilled because the "mentally ill" believe they are supposed to act a certain way so, over time, come to do so.&lt;ref name=Scheff1&gt;{{harvp|Scheff|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scheff's theory had many critics, most notably [[Walter Gove]]. Gove consistently argued an almost opposite theory; he believed that society has no influence at all on "mental illness". Instead, any societal perceptions of the "mentally ill" come about as a direct result of these people's behaviors. Most sociologists' views of labeling and mental illness have fallen somewhere between the extremes of Gove and Scheff. On the other hand, it is almost impossible to deny, given both common sense and research findings, that society's negative perceptions of "crazy" people has had some effect on them. It seems that, realistically, labeling can accentuate and prolong the issues termed "mental illness", but it is rarely the full cause.&lt;ref name=Gove1&gt;{{harvp|Gove|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other studies have been conducted in this general vein. To provide a few examples, several studies have indicated that most people associate being labeled mentally ill as being just as, or even more, stigmatizing than being seen as a [[drug addict]], ex-convict, or [[prostitute]] (for example: Brand &amp; Claiborn 1976). Additionally, Page's 1977 study found that self declared "ex-mental patients" are much less likely to be offered apartment leases or hired for jobs. Clearly, these studies and the dozens of others like them serve to demonstrate that labeling can have a very real and very large effect on the mentally ill. However, labeling has not been proven to be the sole cause of any symptoms of mental illness.

Peggy Thoits discusses the process of labeling someone with a mental illness in her article, "Sociological Approaches to Mental Illness". Working off Thomas Scheff's (1966) theory, Thoits claims that people who are labeled as mentally ill are stereotypically portrayed as unpredictable, dangerous, and unable to care for themselves. She also claims that "people who are labeled as deviant and treated as deviant become deviant".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Thoits|1999|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement can be broken down into two processes, one that involves the effects of self-labeling and the other differential treatment from society based on the individual's label. Therefore, if society sees mentally ill individuals as unpredictable, dangerous and reliant on others, then a person who may not actually be mentally ill but has been labeled as such, could become mentally ill.

The label of "mentally ill" may help a person seek help, for example [[psychotherapy]] or [[medication]]. Labels, while they can be stigmatizing, can also lead those who bear them down the road to proper treatment and (hopefully) recovery. If one believes that "being mentally ill" is more than just believing one should fulfill a set of [[diagnostic criteria]] (as Scheff – see above – would argue{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}), then one would probably also agree that there are some who are labeled "mentally ill" who need help. It has been claimed that this could not happen if "we" did not have a way to categorize (and therefore label) them, although there are actually plenty of [[classification of mental disorder|approaches]] to these phenomena that don't use categorical classifications and diagnostic terms, for example [[spectrum disorder|spectrum]] or continuum models. Here, people vary along different dimensions, and everyone falls at different points on each dimension.

Proponents of ''hard labeling'', as opposed to ''soft labeling'', believe that mental illness does not exist, but is merely deviance from [[norm (sociology)|norms]] of society, causing people to believe in mental illness. They view them as socially constructed illnesses and psychotic disorders.&lt;ref name=Link1&gt;{{harvp|Link|Phelan|1999|pp=361–376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "homosexual"==
The application of labeling theory to homosexuality has been extremely controversial. It was [[Alfred Kinsey]] and his colleagues who pointed out the big discrepancy between the behavior and the role attached to it. They had observed the often negative consequences of labeling and repeatedly condemned labeling people as homosexual:

:"It is amazing to observe how many psychologists and psychiatrists have accepted this sort of propaganda, and have come to believe that homosexual males and females are discretely different from persons who respond to natural stimuli. Instead of using these terms as substantives which stand for persons, or even as adjectives to describe persons, they may better be used to describe the nature of the overt sexual relations, or of the stimuli to which an individual erotically responds... It would clarify our thinking if the terms could be dropped completely out of our vocabulary....&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kinsey|Pomeroy|Martin|1948|pp=616–617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Males do not represent two discrete populations, heterosexual and homosexual... Only the human mind invents categories and tries to force facts into pigeonholes. The living world is a continuum in each and every one of its aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kinsey|Pomeroy|Martin|1948|p=639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The classification of sexual behavior as masturbatory, heterosexual, or homosexual, is, therefore, unfortunate if it suggests that only different types of persons seek out or accept each kind of sexual activity. There is nothing known in the anatomy or physiology of sexual response and orgasm which distinguishes masturbatory, heterosexual, or homosexual reactions....&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kinsey|Pomeroy|Martin|Gebhard|1953|p=446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"In regard to sexual behavior, it has been possible to maintain this dichotomy only by placing all persons who are exclusively heterosexual in a heterosexual category and all persons who have any amount of experience with their own sex, even including those with the slightest experience, in a homosexual category.... The attempt to maintain a simple dichotomy on these matters exposes the traditional biases which are likely to enter whenever the heterosexual or homosexual classification of an individual is involved".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kinsey|Pomeroy|Martin|Gebhard|1953|pp=468–469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erving Goffman's ''Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity'' distinguished between the behavior and the role assigned to it. He wrote:

:"The term 'homosexual' is generally used to refer to anyone who engages in overt sexual practices with a member of his own sex, the practice being called 'homosexuality.' This usage appears to be based on a medical and legal frame of reference and provides much too broad and heterogenous a categorization for use here. I refer only to individuals who participate in a special community of understanding wherein members of one's own sex are defined as the most desirable sexual objects, and sociability is energetically organized around the pursuit and entertainment of these objects."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1963|pp=143–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labeling theory was also applied to homosexuality by Evelyn Hooker&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hooker|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hooker|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hooker|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Leznoff and Westley, who published the first sociological study of the gay community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Leznoff|Westley|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erving Goffman and Howard Becker used the lives of gay-identified persons in their theories of labeling and interactionism. Simon and Gagnon likewise wrote: "It is necessary to move away from the obsessive concern with the sexuality of the individual, and attempt to see the homosexual in terms of the broader attachments that he must make to live in the world around him."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Simon|Gagnon|1967|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British sociologist Mary McIntosh reflected the enthusiasm of Europeans for labeling theory in her 1968 study, "The Homosexual Role".

:"The vantage-point of comparative sociology enables us to see that the conception of homosexuality as a condition is, itself, a possible object of study. This conception and the behavior it supports operate as a form of social control in a society in which homosexuality is condemned...

:"It is interesting to notice that homosexuals themselves welcome and support the notion that homosexuality as a condition. For just as the rigid categorization deters people from drifting into deviancy, so it appears to foreclose on the possibility of drifting back into normalcy and thus removes the element of anxious choice. It appears to justify the deviant behavior of the homosexual as being appropriate for him as a member of the homosexual category. The deviancy can thus be seen as legitimate for him and he can continue in it without rejecting the norm of society."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McIntosh|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sara Fein and Elaine M. Nuehring were among the many who supported the application of labeling theory to homosexuality. They saw the gay role functioning as a "master status" around which other roles become organized. This brings a whole new set of problems and restrictions:

:"Placement in a social category constituting a master status prohibits individuals from choosing the extent of their involvement in various categories. Members of the stigmatized group lose the opportunity to establish their own personal system of evaluation and group membership as well as the ability to arrive at their own ranking of each personal characteristic.... For example, newly self-acknowledged homosexual individuals cannot take for granted that they share the world with others who hold congruent interpretations and assumptions; their behavior and motives, both past and present, will be interpreted in light of their stigma."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fein|Nuehring|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the strongest proponent of labeling theory was Edward Sagarin. In his book, ''Deviants and Deviance'', he wrote, "There are no homosexuals, transvestites, chemical addicts, suicidogenics, delinquents, criminals, or other such entities, in the sense of people having such identities."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sagarin|1975|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sagarin's position was roundly condemned by academics in the gay community. Sagarin had written some gay novels under the pseudonym of Donald Webster Cory. According to reports, he later abandoned his gay identity and began promoting an interactionist view of homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|DuBay|1967|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of authors adopted a modified, non-deviant, labeling theory. They rejected the stigmatic function of the gay role, but found it useful in describing the process of [[coming out]] and reconciling one's homosexual experiences with the social role. Their works included:
* [[Colin J. Williams]] and [[Martin Weinberg]], ''Homosexuals and the Military'', 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Williams|Weinberg|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Martin Weinberg and Colin Williams, in "Male Homosexuals: Their Problems and Adaptations," 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Weinberg|Williams|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barry Adam, in his ''Survival of Domination: Inferiorization of Everyday Life'', took those authors to task for ignoring the force of the oppression in creating identities and their inferiorizing effects. Drawing upon the works of [[Albert Memmi]], Adam showed how gay-identified persons, like Jews and blacks, internalize the hatred to justify their limitations of life choices. He saw the gravitation towards ghettos was evidence of the self-limitations. He wrote:

:"A certain romantic liberalism runs through the literature, evident from attempts to paper over or discount the very real problems of inferiorization. Some researchers seem bent on 'rescuing' their subjects from 'defamation' by ignoring the problems of defeatism and complicit self-destruction. Avoidance of dispiriting reflection upon the day-to-day practice of dominated people appears to spring from a desire to 'enhance' the reputation of the dominated and magically relieve their plight. Careful observation has been sacrificed to the 'power of positive thinking.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Adam|1978|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong defense of labeling theory also arose within the gay community. Dan Slater of the Los Angeles Homosexual Information Center said, "There is no such thing as a homosexual lifestyle. There is no such thing as gay pride or anything like that. Homosexuality is simply based on the sex act. Gay consciousness and all the rest are separatist and defeatist attitudes going back to centuries-old and out-moded conceptions that homosexuals are, indeed, different from other people."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Leopold|1975|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a later article, Slater stated the gay movement was going in the wrong direction:

:"Is it the purpose of the movement to try to assert sexual rights for everyone or create a political and social cult out of homosexuality?.... Persons who perform homosexual acts or other non-conforming acts are sexually free. They want others enlightened. They want hostile laws changed, but they resent the attempt to organize their lives around homosexuality just as much as they resent the centuries-old attempt to organize their lives around heterosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Slater|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William DuBay, in ''Gay Identity: The Self Under Ban'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|DuBay|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes gay identity as one strategy for dealing with society's oppression. It solves some problems but creates many more, replacing a closet of secrecy with one of gay identity. A better strategy, he suggests, is to reject the label and live as if the oppression did not exist. Quoting Goffman, he writes, "But of course what is a good adjustment for the individual can be an even better one for society."&lt;ref name="harvp|Goffman|1963|p=122"/&gt; 

DuBay contends that the attempt to define homosexuality as a class of persons to be protected against discrimination as defined in the statutes has not reduced the oppression. The goal of the movement instead should be to gain acceptance of homosexual relationships as useful and productive for both society and the family. The movement has lost the high moral ground by sponsoring the "flight from choice" and not taking up the moral issues. "Persons whom we confine to back rooms and bars other societies have honored as tenders of children, astrologers, dancers, chanters, minstrels, jesters, artists, shamans, sacred warriors and judges, seers, healers, weavers of tales and magic."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|DuBay|1967|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DuBay refers to the "gay trajectory," in which a person first wraps himself in the gay role, organizing his personality and his life around sexual behavior. He might flee from his family and home town to a large gay center. There, the bedeviling force of the stigma will introduce him to more excessive modes of deviance such as promiscuity, prostitution, alcoholism, and drugs. Many resist such temptations and try to normalize their life, but the fast lanes of gay society are littered with the casualties of gay identity. Some come to reject the label entirely. "Accomplishing the forbidden, they are neither gay nor straight. Again learning to choose, they develop the ability to make the ban ambiguous, taking responsibility and refusing explanations of their behaviors."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|DuBay|1967|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Henry Mackay writes about a gay hustler in Berlin adopting such a solution: "What was self-evident, natural, and not the least sick did not require an excuse through an explanation.... It was love just like any other love. Whoever could not or would not accept it as love was mistaken."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mackay|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modified labeling theory==
Bruce Link and colleagues have conducted several studies which point to the influence that labeling can have on mental patients. Through these studies, which took place in 1987, 1989, and 1997, Link advanced a "modified labeling theory" indicating that expectations of labeling can have a large negative effect, that these expectations often cause patients to withdraw from society, and that those labeled as having a mental disorder are constantly being rejected from society in seemingly minor ways but that, when taken as a whole, all of these small slights can drastically alter their self concepts. They come to both anticipate and perceive negative societal reactions to them, and this potentially damages their quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Link|Cullen|Struening|Shrout|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modified labeling theory has been described as a "sophisticated social-psychological model of 'why labels matter{{'"}}. In 2000, results from a prospective two-year study of patients discharged from a mental hospital (in the context of [[deinstitutionalization]]) showed that [[social stigma|stigma]] was a powerful and persistent force in their lives, and that experiences of [[social rejection]] were a persistent source of social stress. Efforts to cope with labels, such as not telling anyone, educating people about mental distress/disorder, withdrawing from stigmatizing situations, could result in further social isolation and reinforce negative self-concepts. Sometimes an identity as a low [[self-esteem]] minority in society would be accepted. The stigma was associated with diminished motivation and ability to "make it in mainstream society" and with "a state of social and psychological vulnerability to prolonged and recurrent problems". There was an up and down pattern in self-esteem, however, and it was suggested that, rather than simply gradual erosion of self-worth and increasing [[self-deprecating]] tendencies, people were sometimes managing, but struggling, to maintain consistent feelings of self-worth. Ultimately, "a cadre of patients had developed an entrenched, negative view of themselves, and their experiences of rejection appear to be a key element in the construction of these self-related feelings" and "hostile neighbourhoods may not only affect their self-concept but may also ultimately impact the patient's mental health status and how successful they are".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wright|Gronfein|Owens|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
In [[mathematical logic]] and [[type theory]], the '''λ-cube''' is a framework for exploring the axes of refinement in [[Thierry Coquand]]'s [[calculus of constructions]], starting from the [[simply typed lambda calculus]] (written as λ→ in the cube diagram) as the vertex of a cube placed at the origin, and the calculus of constructions (higher-order dependently typed polymorphic lambda calculus; written as λPω in the diagram) as its diametrically opposite vertex.  Each axis of the cube represents a new form of abstraction:
* Values depending on types, or [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]]. [[System F]], also known as second-order lambda calculus (written as λ2 in the diagram), is obtained by imposing only this property.
* Types depending on types, or [[type constructor|type operators]]. [[Simply typed lambda calculus with type operators]] (λ&lt;u&gt;ω&lt;/u&gt; in the diagram) is obtained by imposing only this property. Combined with [[System F]] it yields [[System F#System Fω|System F&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;]] (written as λω without the underline in the diagram).
* Types depending on values, or [[Dependent type theory|dependent types]]. Imposing only this property yields [[Dependent type#First-order dependent type theory|λΠ]] (written as λP in the diagram), a type system closely related to [[LF (logical framework)|LF]].

All eight calculi include the most basic form of abstraction, values depending on values, ordinary functions as in the simply typed lambda calculus. The richest calculus in the cube, with all three abstractions, is the [[calculus of constructions]]. All eight calculi are [[Normalization property (lambda-calculus)|strongly normalizing]].

[[Subtyping]] however is not represented in the cube, even though systems like &lt;math&gt;F^\omega_{&lt;:}&lt;/math&gt;, known as [[higher-order bounded quantification]], which combines subtyping and polymorphism are of practical interest, and can be further generalized to [[bounded type operator]]s. Further extensions to &lt;math&gt;F^\omega_{&lt;:}&lt;/math&gt; allow the definition of [[purely functional objects]]; these systems were generally developed after the lambda cube paper was published.&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, 2002, chapters 31 and 32&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the cube is due to the mathematician [[Henk Barendregt]] (1991). The framework of [[pure type system]]s generalizes the lambda cube in the sense that all corners of the cube, as well as many other systems can be represented as instances of this general framework.&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, 2002, p. 466&lt;/ref&gt; This framework predates the lambda cube by a couple of years. In his 1991 paper, Barendregt also defines the corners of the cube in this framework.

In his Habilitation à diriger les recherches ''Lambda-Prolog de A à Z... ou presque'' [ftp://ftp.irisa.fr/techreports/habilitations/ridoux.pdf], Olivier Ridoux gives a cut-out template of the Lambda cube (p.&amp;nbsp;70) and also a dual representation of the cube as an octahedron, where the 8 vertices are replaced by faces, as well as a dual representation as a dodecahedron, where the 12 edges are replaced by faces.

The '''London Green500''' is [[London]] mayor [[Boris Johnson]]’s pioneering carbon mentoring programme. With the aim to lead London’s top organisations to reduce [[carbon emissions]] in the capital by 60% by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.green500.co.uk/cms/about/ About&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The London Green500 is led by a consortium on behalf of the [[London Development Agency]]. [[AEA Technology]] is the lead contractor, with [[Mouchel]], [[National Energy Foundation]], Futerra and Future Considerations.

== What is Green500? ==

The aim of Green500 is to enlist some of London’s largest and most prestigious organisations and mentor them through their carbon reduction commitments.

Green500 is one of a number of London Development Agency (LDA) [[London Development Agency]] initiatives, including Better Buildings Partnership, which aim to reduce London’s CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.  

Members of Green500 receive an initial assessment of their London specific carbon footprint from an expert Green500 Carbon Mentor.  Members are then presented with a tailored Action Plan outlining how they can reduce their carbon emissions.

The '''mature minor doctrine''' is an American term for the [[statutory]], [[regulatory]], or [[common law]] policy accepting that an [[emancipated minor|unemancipated minor]] [[patient]] may possess the [[maturity (psychological)|maturity]] to choose or reject a particular [[health care]] [[Therapy|treatment]], sometimes without the knowledge or agreement of parents, and should be permitted to do so.&lt;ref&gt;''West's encyclopedia of American law'', Volume 8, West Publishing, 1998, page 47&lt;/ref&gt; It is now generally considered a form of patients [[rights]]; formerly, the '''mature minor rule''' was largely seen as protecting [[health care providers]] from [[criminal]] and civil [[cause of action|claims]] by parents of minors at least 15.&lt;ref&gt;''Legal issues in pediatrics and adolescent medicine'' by Angela Roddey Holder, Yale University Press, 1985, page 133&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurisdictions may [[codification (law)|codify]] an age of medical consent, accept the judgment of [[licensure|licensed]] providers regarding an individual minor, or accept a formal [[court decision]] following a request that a patient be designated a mature minor, or may rely on some combination. For example, patients at least 16 may be assumed to be mature minors for this purpose,&lt;ref&gt;"Definitions", ''USLegal.com'', [http://definitions.uslegal.com/m/mature-minor-doctrine/ Retrieved 2011-05-16], "Mature minor doctrine is a legal principle which... has been consistently applied in cases where the minor is sixteen years or older"&lt;/ref&gt; patients aged 13 to 15 may be designated so by licensed providers, and pre-teen patients may be so-designated after evaluation by an [[Government agency|agency]] or [[court]]. The mature minor doctrine is sometimes connected with enforcing [[Confidentiality#Medical confidentiality|confidentiality]] of minor patients from their parents.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mature Minor Rule: Teens and patient confidentiality'', Public Health - Seattle &amp; King County, [http://www.kingcounty.gov/healthservices/health/personal/famplan/providers/matureminor.aspx Retrieved 2011-05-13]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statute==
In the United States, a typical statute lists: ''"Who may consent [or withhold consent for] surgical or medical treatment or procedures."''
:"...Any unemancipated minor of sufficient intelligence to understand and appreciate the consequences of the proposed surgical or medical treatment or procedures, for himself."&lt;ref&gt;''Mississippi Code'', [http://www.mscode.com/free/statutes/41/041/0003.htm Retrieved 2011-05-13] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720125628/http://www.mscode.com/free/statutes/41/041/0003.htm |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''2010 Arkansas Code'', [http://law.justia.com/codes/arkansas/2010/title-20/subtitle-2/chapter-9/subchapter-6/20-9-602/ Retrieved 2011-05-13]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical emancipation==
{{See also|Emancipation of minors}}
By definition, a "mature minor" has been found to have the [[Capacity (law)|capacity]] to make serious medical decisions alone. By contrast, "medical emancipation" formally releases children from some parental involvement requirements but does not necessarily grant that decision making to children themselves. Pursuant to statute, several jurisdictions grant medical emancipation to a minor who has become [[pregnant]] or requires [[reproductive health|sexual-health]] services, thereby permitting medical treatment without parental consent and, often, confidentiality from parents. A limited [[legal guardian|guardianship]] may be appointed to make medical decisions for the medically emancipated minor and the minor may not be permitted to refuse or even choose treatment.&lt;ref&gt;''Children and the Law'' by Douglas E. Abrams and Sarah H. Ramsey, West Group, 2003, page 769&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
One early U.S. case of significance, [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10967297783373086168&amp;q=431+P.2d+719.&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,31 ''Smith v. Seibly''], 72 Wn.2d 16, 431 [[Pacific Reporter|P.2d]] 719 (1967), before the [[Washington Supreme Court]], establishes precedent on the mature minor doctrine. The plaintiff, Albert G. Smith, an 18-year-old married father, was suffering from [[myasthenia gravis]], a progressive disease. Because of this, Smith expressed concern that his wife might become burdened in caring for him for their existing child  and possibly for additional children. On March 9, 1961, while still 18, Smith requested a [[vasectomy]]. His doctor required [[Informed consent|written consent]], which Smith provided, and the [[surgery]] was performed. Later, after reaching Washington's statutory [[age of majority]], then 21, the doctor was sued by Smith, who now claimed that he had been a minor and thus unable to grant surgical or medical consent. The Court rejected Smith's argument: "Thus, age, intelligence, maturity, training, experience, economic independence or lack thereof, general conduct as an adult and freedom from the control of parents are all factors to be considered in such a case [involving consent to surgery]."

The court further quoted another recently decided case, [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18043554202269328547&amp;q=422+P.2d+812&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,31 ''Grannum v. Berard''], 70 Wn.2d 304, 307, 422 [[Pacific Reporter|P.2d]] 812 (1967): "The mental capacity necessary to consent to a surgical operation is a question of fact to be determined from the circumstances of each individual case." The court explicitly stated that a minor may grant surgical consent even without formal emancipation.

Especially since the 1970s, older pediatric patients sought to make autonomous decisions regarding their own treatment and sometimes sued successfully to do so.&lt;ref&gt;"Affirming the Decisions Adolescents Make about Life and Death" by Robert F. Weir and Charles Peters, ''Hastings Center Report'', Vol 27 No. 6, November–December 1997, Hastings Center, page 29&lt;/ref&gt; The decades of accumulated evidence tended to demonstrate that children are capable of participating in medical decision-making in a meaningful way;&lt;ref&gt;"Ethical problems in pediatric critical care: Consent" by Christine A. Zawistowski and Joel E. Frader, ''Critical Care Medicine'', Vol 31 Issue 5, May 2003, page S407-S410&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Mature Minors Should Have the Right to Refuse Life-Sustaining Medical Treatment" by Melinda T. Derish and Kathleen Vanden Heuvel, ''The Journal of Law Medicine and Ethics'', Vol 28 Issue 2, June 2000, pages 109-124&lt;/ref&gt; and legal and medical communities have demonstrated an increasing willingness of formally affirming decisions made by young people, even regarding life and death.&lt;ref&gt;"Children's Competence to Participate in Healthcare Decisions" by Susan M. Beidler and Susan B. Dickey, ''JONA's Healthcare Law Ethics and Regulation'', Vol 3 Issue 3, September 2001, page 80-87&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious beliefs have repeatedly influenced a patient's decision to choose treatment or not. In a case in 1989 in Illinois, [https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/01/you-must-be-this-old-to-die/384303/ a 17 year old female Jehovah's Witness] was permitted to refuse necessary life saving treatments.

In 1990, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Patient Self-Determination Act]]; even though key provisions apply only to patients over age 18,&lt;ref&gt;''The Patient Self-Determination Act: An Early Look at Implementation'' by Mathy Mezey and Beth Latimer, ''Hastings Center Report'', January–February 1993, page 16&lt;/ref&gt; the legislation advanced patient involvement in decisionmaking. The [[West Virginia Supreme Court]], in [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14842078072813819970&amp;q=422+SE2d+827&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,31 ''Belcher v. Charleston Area Medical Center''], 422 [[South Eastern Reporter|S.E.2d]] 827, 188 W.Va. 105 (1992), defined a "mature minor" exception to [[parental consent]], according consideration to seven factors to be weighed regarding such a minor: age, ability, experience, education, exhibited judgment, conduct, and appreciation of relevant risks and consequences.&lt;ref&gt;"Mature Minors and Emancipated Minors", Health Sciences Center, West Virginia University, [http://www.wvendoflife.org/MediaLibraries/WVCEOLC/Media/laws/Minors.pdf Retrieved 2011-08-04] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226055543/http://www.wvendoflife.org/MediaLibraries/WVCEOLC/Media/laws/Minors.pdf |date=2011-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Withholding of consent==
{{See also|Informed refusal}}

===United States===
In the United States, [[bodily integrity]] has long been considered a [[Natural and legal rights|common law right]]; the United States Supreme Court, in 1891's ''[[Union Pacific Railway Company v. Botsford]]'', found, "No right is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded, by the common law, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of others, unless by clear and unquestionable [[Rational-legal authority|authority of law]]." The Supreme Court in 1990 (''[[Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health]]'') allowed that "constitutionally protected [[Claim rights and liberty rights|liberty interest]] in refusing unwanted medical treatment may be inferred" in the ''[[Due process#The U.S. Constitution|Due Process]] Clause'' of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Due Process Clause|Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], but the Court refrained from explicitly establishing what would have been a newly enumerated right. Nevertheless, lower courts have increasingly held that competent patients have the right to refuse any treatment for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;"Towards the right to be killed?" by Trudo Lemmens, ''British Medical Bulletin'', Vol 52 No. 2, British Council, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the [[Supreme Court of Illinois]] interpreted the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] to have already adopted major aspects of mature minor doctrine, concluding,
:Although the United States Supreme Court has not broadened this constitutional right of minors beyond [[Abortion in the United States|abortion cases]], the [Illinois] [[appellate court]] found such an extension "inevitable." ...Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has not held that a [[Constitutional right|constitutionally based right]] to [[Informed refusal|refuse medical treatment]] exists, either for adults or minors. ...[U.S. Supreme Court] cases do show, however, that no "[[bright line]]" age restriction of 18 is tenable in restricting the rights of mature minors, [thus] mature minors may possess and exercise rights regarding medical care... If the evidence is clear and convincing that the minor is mature enough to appreciate the consequences of her actions, and that the minor is mature enough to exercise the judgment of an adult, then the mature minor doctrine affords her the common law right to consent to or refuse medical treatment [including life and death cases, with some considerations].&lt;ref&gt;''In re E.G.'', 549 [[North Eastern Reporter|N.E.2d]] 322, 133 Ill. 2d 98, Supreme Court of Illinois, November 13, 1989, [http://il.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac.19891113_0001777.IL.htm/qx Retrieved 2011-05-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

An ongoing case of Z.M is being heard in Maryland regarding the minor's right to refuse chemotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.courts.state.md.us/cosappeals/pdfs/201610schedule.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In Connecticut, Cassandra C. a seventeen year old was ordered by the Connecticut Supreme Court to receive treatment. The court decided that Cassandra was not mature enough to make medical decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://campbelllawobserver.com/the-choice-is-not-always-yours-a-minors-right-to-make-medical-decisions/|title=The Choice is Not Always Yours: A Minor’s Right to Make Medical Decisions|newspaper=Campbell Law Observer|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In 2009, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruling in ''[[A.C. v. Manitoba (Director of Child and Family Services)|A.C. v. Manitoba]]''&lt;!-- This article will be added; please do not "fix" redlink.---&gt; [2009] SCC 30 (CanLII) found that children ''may'' make life and death decisions about their medical treatment. In the majority opinion, [[Puisne Justice|Justice]] [[Rosalie Abella]] wrote:
:"The result of this [decision] is that young people under 16 will have the right to demonstrate mature medical decisional capacity. ...If, after a careful analysis of the young person’s ability to exercise mature and independent judgment, the court is persuaded that the necessary level of maturity exists, the young person’s views ought to be respected."
A "dissenting"&lt;ref&gt;That is, dissenting to the disposition of this specific case rather than the larger point of law&lt;/ref&gt; opinion by Justice [[Ian Binnie]] would have gone further:
:"At common law, proof of capacity entitles the “mature minor” to exercise personal autonomy in making medical treatment decisions free of parental or judicial control. ...[A] young person with capacity is entitled to make the treatment decision, not just to have ‘input’ into a [[judge]]’s consideration of what the judge believes to be the young person’s best interests."&lt;ref&gt;"A.C. v. Manitoba (Director of Child and Family Services)", Supreme Court of Canada, June 26, 2009, Docket 31955, [http://www.lewisday.ca/ldlf_files/pdf/AC.pdf Retrieved 2011-05-16]&lt;/ref&gt;
Analysts note that the Canadian decision merely requires that younger patients be permitted a ''[[Hearing (law)|hearing]]'', and still allows a judge to "decide whether or not to order a medical procedure on an unwilling minor".&lt;ref&gt;"Charter Offers No Protection from Forced Blood Transfusion for Young Jehovah’s Witness" by Jim Young, Center for Constitutional Studies, July 2, 2009, [http://www.law.ualberta.ca/centres/ccs/news/?id=313 Retrieved 2011-05-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Warszawa Copernicus.png|thumb|upright=1.1|Warsaw's [[Nicolaus Copernicus Monument in Warsaw|Nicolaus Copernicus monument]] was the target of a celebrated minor-sabotage operation.]]

A '''minor sabotage''' (''aka'' '''little sabotage''' or '''small sabotage'''; {{lang-pl|mały sabotaż}}) during [[World War II]] in [[occupation of Poland|Nazi-occupied]] [[Poland]] (1939–45) was any [[Polish Underground State|underground resistance]] operation that involved a disruptive but relatively minor and [[non-violent]] form of defiance, such as the painting of [[graffiti]], the manufacture of fake documents, the disrupting of German [[propaganda]] campaigns, and the like.  Minor-sabotage operations often involved elements of [[humor]].
&lt;ref name=pwn&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://sjp.pwn.pl/haslo.php?id=2518795 "''Mały sabotaż''"], ''Słownik Języka Polskiego'' (Dictionary of the Polish Language), [[Polish Scientific Publishers PWN|PWN]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of minor-sabotage operations was primarily [[psychological warfare|psychological]] — to show Polish civilians that the resistance remained active, and thus bolster civilian morale, and to wear down the German occupier.&lt;ref name=rzecz&gt;{{pl icon}} Tomasz Stańczyk, [http://www.rzeczpospolita.pl/specjal_040529/specjal_a_7.html "''Piasek sypany w oczy'',"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526145431/http://www.rzeczpospolita.pl/specjal_040529/specjal_a_7.html |date=26 May 2008 }} ''Rzeczpospolita, Dodatek Specjalny'', 29.05.04, no. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In September 1939, during the [[German invasion of Poland]], after the [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)|fall of Warsaw]], a young Polish student, Elżbieta Zahorska, tore down a German poster. Soon after, she was executed for her act; her death, however, instead of cowing others, inspired an entire new branch of Polish resistance, called minor sabotage.&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;

Several organizations dedicated to minor sabotage were created in 1939 and 1940, notably PLAN, Wawer and Palmiry.&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt; Minor sabotage was often carried out by scouting organizations such as ''[[Szare Szeregi]]''.&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt; On a larger scale, it was coordinated by the [[Directorate of Civil Resistance]] of the [[Polish Underground State]] and, in some cases, by its military arm, the [[Home Army]] (see [[Operation N]]). Thousands were involved in minor sabotage. During two weeks in March and April 1942 when the ''[[kotwica]]'' symbol was introduced, it was painted all around Warsaw by a 400-strong dedicated team.&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;

[[Aleksander Kamiński]], a teacher and scouting activist, soon became a major figure in organizing such operations. In November 1940 he published an article in the main [[bibuła|Polish underground newspaper]], ''[[Biuletyn Informacyjny]]'', explaining how to carry out such acts.&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;

==Operations==
Notable or common minor-sabotage operations included:
* painting pro-Polish and anti-Nazi [[graffiti]].&lt;ref name=polska&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://dziedzictwo.polska.pl/slownik/index,Maly_sabotaz,id,266516.htm Mały sabotaż], polska.pl&lt;/ref&gt; Common symbols included the ''[[kotwica]]'' ("anchor"—the symbol of the [[Polish Underground State|Polish underground]])&lt;ref name=polska/&gt; and the turtle (a symbol of work sabotage and inefficiency, to be implemented by those who worked—often [[Forced labor in Germany during World War II|forcibly]]—for the German occupier).&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;&lt;ref name=polska/&gt; Slogans included "''Wawer pomścimy''" ("We will avenge the [[Wawer massacre]]"),&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt; "''Pawiak pomścimy''" ("We will avenge the [[Pawiak]] [prison atrocities]"),&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt; and "''Oświęcim''" ("[[Auschwitz]]").&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* inefficient, slow work and [[sabotage]], when one was employed by the Germans&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* misdirection, when asked for directions&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* not acknowledging that one speaks German, and thus refusing to communicate with the Germans&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* ignoring German demands or executing them only at the last possible moment&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* harassing German occupiers and collaborators by sending threats&lt;ref name=pwn/&gt; or denouncing them as underground activists to German security forces&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* counteracting German Nazi propaganda operations (for example, by altering German posters—such posters about advances in the [[Soviet Union]] were "amended" to the date 1812)&lt;ref name=pwn/&gt;&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* tearing down and damaging German flags&lt;ref name=polska/&gt; and putting up Polish flags for Polish anniversaries&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* breaking windows in shops that displayed German symbols (for example, those of photographers who displayed photographs of German soldiers, and of shops that displayed signs in [[German language|German]])&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;&lt;ref name=polska/&gt;
* taking over German megaphone systems to broadcast [[Polish patriotic songs]]&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* "Amending" German newspapers with Polish symbols; on occasion, issuing fake editions&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* releasing stink bombs and the like in [[movie theater]]s that screened German [[propaganda film]]s and [[newsreel]]s, and putting up the Polish-language slogan, "''Tylko świnie siedzą w kinie''" ("Only [[swine]] watch the German line")&lt;ref name=polska/&gt;
* placing the German sign, "''[[Nur für Deutsche]]''" ("Only for Germans"), in selected sites such as [[cemetery|cemeteries]]

A particularly notable operation was carried out by [[Maciej Aleksy Dawidowski]] on 11 February 1942. Soon after the Germans had occupied Warsaw in 1939, they had placed on the [[Nicolaus Copernicus Monument in Warsaw|Nicolaus Copernicus Monument]] on ''[[Krakowskie Przedmieście]]'' a large plaque proclaiming Copernicus to have been a German astronomer.  Dawidowski removed and concealed the German plaque.&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt; In response, the Germans moved Warsaw's statue of [[Jan Kiliński]] to the [[National Museum in Warsaw]].&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt; Immediately, Dawidowski and his comrades retaliated by placing a large graffito on the Museum ("People of Warsaw—I am here. Jan Kiliński") and adding a new plaque to the Copernicus monument: "For removal of the Kiliński statue, I am extending the winter by two months. Kopernik."&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Einhorn, ''Recollections of the End of an Era: Poland 1919-1945'', Author House, 2005, {{ISBN|1-4208-0354-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9WqTG8Oiv7cC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=Poland+%22minor+sabotage%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=VgXeSqDwJY7GMrWwiOkD#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Google Print, pp. 128-29.]&lt;/ref&gt; Even though most minor sabotage operations took place in Warsaw, they also were organized in other cities of occupied Poland, such as [[Częstochowa]] (painting anti-German graffiti, destruction of German signs, affixing of Polish posters), [[Kielce]] (defacing of German symbols on official signs, stamping newspapers with the [[Kotwica]], painting of a large symbol of the Polish underground state on the tower of the Cathedral church), and [[Kraków]] (writing "Hitler Kaputt" on the walls, selling fake copies of the local daily "Goniec Krakowski").

In [[mathematics]], and in particular [[universal algebra]], the concept of '''''n''-ary group''' (also called '''''n''-group''' or '''multiary group''') is a generalization of the concept of  [[group (mathematics)|group]] to a set ''G'' with an [[arity|''n''-ary operation]] instead of a binary operation.&lt;ref name="oldandnew"&gt;{{Citation| last=Dudek |first=W.A. |title=On some old and new problems in ''n''-ary groups |url=http://www.quasigroups.eu/contents/download/2001/8_3.pdf |journal=Quasigroups and Related Systems |year=2001 |volume=8 |pages= 15–36}}.&lt;/ref&gt;   By an ''n''-ary operation is meant any set map ''f: G&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; → G'' from the ''n''-th Cartesian power of ''G'' to ''G''.  The [[axioms]] for an ''n''-ary group are defined in such a way that they reduce to those of a group in the case {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 2}}.  The earliest work on these structures was done in 1904 by Kasner and in 1928 by Dörnte;&lt;ref name="Dornte"&gt;W. Dörnte, Untersuchungen über einen verallgemeinerten Gruppenbegriff, ''Mathematische Zeitschrift'', vol. 29 (1928), pp. 1-19.&lt;/ref&gt; the first systematic account of (what were then called) '''polyadic groups''' was given in 1940 by [[Emil Leon Post]] in a famous 143-page paper in the ''Transactions of the American Mathematical Society''.&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;E. L. Post, [http://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1940-048-02/S0002-9947-1940-0002894-7/home.html Polyadic groups], ''Transactions of the American Mathematical Society'' 48 (1940), 208&amp;ndash;350.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Axioms==

===Associativity===
The easiest axiom to generalize is the associative law. Ternary associativity is the polynomial identity {{nowrap|(''abc'')''de''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;''a''(''bcd'')''e''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;''ab''(''cde'')}}, i.e. the equality of the three possible bracketings of the string ''abcde'' in which any three consecutive symbols are bracketed. (Here it is understood that the equations hold for arbitrary choices of elements ''a,b,c,d,e'' in ''G''.)  In general, ''n''-ary associativity is the equality of the ''n'' possible bracketings of a string consisting of ''n''+(''n''-1) = ''2n-1'' distinct symbols with any ''n'' consecutive  symbols bracketed.  A set ''G'' which is closed under an associative ''n''-ary operation is called an '''''n''-ary semigroup.''' A set ''G'' which is closed under any (not necessarily associative) ''n''-ary operation is called an '''''n''-ary [[Magma (algebra)|groupoid]]'''.

===Inverses / unique solutions===
The inverse axiom is generalized as follows: in the case of binary operations the existence of an inverse means {{nowrap|''ax'' {{=}} ''b''}} has a unique solution for ''x'', and likewise {{nowrap|''xa'' {{=}} ''b''}} has a unique solution. In the ternary case we generalize this to {{nowrap|''abx'' {{=}} ''c''}}, {{nowrap|''axb'' {{=}} ''c''}} and {{nowrap|''xab'' {{=}} ''c''}} each having unique solutions, and the ''n''-ary case follows a similar pattern of existence of unique solutions and we get an '''''n''-ary quasigroup.'''

===Definition of ''n-ary'' group===
An '''''n''-ary group''' is an ''n''-ary semigroup which is also an ''n''-ary quasigroup.

===Identity / neutral elements===
In the 2-ary case, i.e. for an ordinary group, the existence of an identity element is a consequence of the associativity and inverse axioms, however in n-ary groups for n ≥ 3 there can be zero, one, or many identity elements.

An ''n''-ary groupoid (''G'',&amp;nbsp;''ƒ'') with ''ƒ'' = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ◦ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ◦ . . . ◦ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), where (''G'',&amp;nbsp;◦) is a group is called reducible or derived from the group (''G'',&amp;nbsp;◦). In 1928 Dörnte &lt;ref name="Dornte"/&gt; published the first main results: An ''n''-ary groupoid which is reducible is an ''n''-ary group, however for all ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2 there exist ''n''-ary groups which are not reducible. In some ''n''-ary groups there exists an element ''e'' (called an ''n''-ary identity or neutral element) such that any string of ''n''-elements consisting of all ''e''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s, apart from one place, is mapped to the element at that place. E.g., in a quaternary group with identity ''e'', ''eeae''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a'' for every ''a''.

An ''n''-ary group containing a neutral element is reducible. Thus, an ''n''-ary group that is not reducible does not contain such elements. There exist ''n''-ary groups with more than one neutral element. If the set of all neutral elements of an ''n''-ary group is non-empty it forms an ''n''-ary subgroup.&lt;ref&gt;Wiesław A. Dudek, [https://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2749 Remarks to Głazek's results on ''n''-ary groups], ''Discussiones Mathematicae. General Algebra and Applications'' 27 (2007), 199–233.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors include an identity in the definition of an ''n''-ary group but as mentioned above such ''n''-ary operations are just repeated binary operations. Groups with intrinsically ''n''-ary operations do not have an identity element.&lt;ref&gt;Wiesław A. Dudek and Kazimierz Głazek, [https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0510185v1 Around the Hosszú-Gluskin theorem for ''n''-ary groups], ''Discrete Mathematics'' 308 (2008), 486&amp;ndash;4876.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weaker axioms===

The axioms of associativity and unique solutions in the definition of an ''n''-ary group are stronger than they need to be. Under the assumption of ''n''-ary associativity it suffices to postulate the existence of the solution of equations with the unknown at the start or end of the string, or at one place other than the ends; e.g., in the 6-ary case, ''xabcde''=''f'' and ''abcdex''=''f'', or an expression like ''abxcde''=''f''. Then it can be proved that the equation has a unique solution for ''x'' in any place in the string.&lt;ref name="Post"/&gt;
The associativity axiom can also be given in a weaker form.&lt;ref name="oldandnew"/&gt;{{rp|17}}

==Example==
The following is an example of a three element ternary group, one of four such groups&lt;ref&gt;http://tamivox.org/dave/math/tern_quasi/assoc12345.html&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
aaa = a &amp; aab = b &amp; aac = c &amp; aba = c &amp; abb = a &amp; abc = b &amp; aca = b &amp; acb = c &amp; acc = a\\
baa = b &amp; bab = c &amp; bac = a &amp; bba = a &amp; bbb = b &amp; bbc = c &amp; bca = c &amp; bcb = a &amp; bcc = b\\
caa = c &amp; cab = a &amp; cac = b &amp; cba = b &amp; cbb = c &amp; cbc = a &amp; cca = a &amp; ccb = b &amp; ccc = c
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''National Privacy Commission''', or '''NPC''', is an independent body created under Republic Act No. 10173 or the Data Privacy Act of 2012,&lt;ref&gt;Republic Act No. 10173, An Act Protecting Individual Personal Information in Information and Communications Systems in the Government and the Private Sector, Creating for this purpose a National Privacy Commission, and for Other Purposes, (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; mandated to administer and implement the provisions of the Act, and to monitor and ensure compliance of the country with international standards set for data protection.&lt;ref&gt;Data Privacy Act, Section 7&lt;/ref&gt; It is attached to the [[Philippines]]' [[Department of Information and Communications Technology (Philippines)|Department of Information and Communications Technology]] (DICT) for purposes of policy coordination, but remains independent in the performance of its functions.&lt;ref&gt;Data Privacy Act, Section 9&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission safeguards the fundamental human right of every individual to privacy, particularly [[Information privacy]] while ensuring free flow of information for innovation, growth, and national development.&lt;ref&gt;Data Privacy Act, Section 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to fulfil its mandate, the Commission is vested with a broad range of powers, from receiving complaints and instituting investigations on matters affecting personal data protection to compelling entities to abide by its orders in matters affecting data privacy. It also represents the [[Government of the Philippines|Philippine Government]] internationally on data protection related issues. The Commission formulates and implements policies relating to the protection of personal data, including the relevant circulars and advisory guidelines, to assist organisations in understanding and complying with the Data Privacy Act. The Commission also reviews organizational actions in relation to data protection rules and issue decisions or directions for compliance where necessary. It is mandated to work with relevant sector regulators in exercising its functions.

Beyond regulating data protection issues, the NPC also undertakes public and sector-specific educational and outreach activities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/01/09/1661022/privacy-body-raises-private-sector-awareness-data-security|title=Privacy body raises private sector awareness on data security|first=Rainier Allan|last=Ronda|newspaper=Philippine Star|date=1 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help organizations adopt good data protection practices and to help individuals to better understand how they may protect their own personal data from misuse.

==History==

The Data Privacy Act of 2012 is the first law in the [[Philippines]] which acknowledges the rights of Individuals over their Personal Data and Enforcing the responsibilities of entities who process them.

The initial definition was offered first in Republic Act 8792, Section 32 better known as the eCommerce Act of the Philippines and was formally introduced by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) on its Department Administrative Order #08 - Defining Guidelines for the Protection of Personal Data in Information Private Sector. Along with the Anti-Cybercrime Bill (now RA 10175), The first draft of the law started in 2001 under the Legal and Regulatory Committee of the former Information Technology and eCommerce Council (ITECC) which is the forerunner of the [[Commission on Information and Communications Technology (Philippines)|Commission on Information and Communication Technology]] (CICT). It was headed by former Secretary Virgilio "Ver" Peña and the Committee was chaired by Atty. Claro Parlade. It was an initiative of the Information Security and Privacy Sub-Committee chaired by Albert Dela Cruz who was the President of PHCERT together with then Anti-Computer Crime and Fraud Division Chief, Atty. Elfren Meneses of the NBI. The administrative and operational functions was provided by the Presidential Management Staff (PMS) acting as the CICT secretariat.

With rising concerns by the [[Business process outsourcing in the Philippines|Information Technology and Business Process Association of the Philippines]] (IBPAP) of an absence of a Data Privacy Law, [[Congress of the Philippines|Philippine Congress]] passed Senate Bill No. 2965 and House Bill No. 4115 on June 6, 2012. President [[Benigno S. Aquino III]] signed Republic Act No. 10173 or the '''''Data Privacy Act of 2012''''' on August 15, 2012. The law was influenced by the [[Data Protection Directive]] and the APEC Privacy Framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hldataprotection.com/2012/08/articles/international-eu-privacy/philippine-data-privacy-law-is-signed-into-law/|title=Philippine Data Privacy Law is Signed into Law|publisher=HL Chronicle of Data Protection|date=23 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Aquino appointed on March 7, 2016 Raymund Liboro as inaugural head of the commission with Damian Domingo O. Mapa and Ivy D. Patdu as inaugural deputy privacy commissioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsbytes.ph/2016/03/07/dost-exec-named-first-commissioner-of-national-privacy-commission/|title=DOST exec named first commissioner of National Privacy Commission|work=NewsBytes.ph|date=7 Mar 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With fixed terms of office, they continued with their roles during the administration of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Rodrigo Duterte]].

After consultation with various private organizations, civil societies and a series of public hearings in Manila, Cebu and Davao, the Implementing Rules and Regulations&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.ph/images/uploads/20160825-IRR-RA-10173-data-privacy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; of the Data Privacy Act was signed on August 24, 2016. It took effect on September 9, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsbytes.ph/2016/08/27/irr-for-data-privacy-act-released-4-years-after-passage-of-law/|title=IRR for Data Privacy Act released 4 years after passage of law|work=NewsBytes.ph|date=27 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, the Commission formally investigated the Commission on Elections for the [[Commission on Elections data breach]] one of the largest security breach in government held personal data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/01/06/1660106/comeleak-bautista-faces-criminal-raps|title=Comeleak: Bautista faces criminal raps|first=Rainier Allan|last=Ronda|newspaper=Philippine Star|date=6 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 21, 2017, NPC announced that the Commission on Elections was being investigated for another security breach due to alleged theft of a computer containing personal data of voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/873559/another-comeleak-theft-probed|title=Another Comeleak? Theft probed|first=Vince F.|last=Nonato|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=21 Feb 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NPC also began coordinating with different sectors on privacy and data protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/866488/agency-reminds-bank-on-data-privacy-law|title=Agency reminds bank on data privacy law|first=Kathleen|last=de Villa|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=30 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2016, the National Privacy Commission was accepted as a member in the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners and the Asia Pacific Privacy Authorities.

'''Negative capability''' was a phrase first used by  [[Romantic poet]] [[John Keats]] in 1817 to characterise the capacity of the greatest writers (particularly Shakespeare) to pursue a vision of artistic beauty even when it leads them into intellectual confusion and uncertainty, as opposed to a preference for philosophical certainty over artistic beauty.  The term has been used by poets and philosophers to describe the ability of the individual to perceive, think, and operate beyond any presupposition of a predetermined capacity of the human being.{{citation needed|date=November 2015|reason=no citation offered.}}

==Keats: The poet's turn of phrase==
Keats used the phrase only briefly in a private letter, and it became known only after his correspondence was collected and published.  In a letter to his brothers, George and Thomas, on 22 December 1817, Keats described a conversation he had been engaged in a few days previously:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Li|first=Ou|title=Keats and Negative Capability|year=2009|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I had not a dispute but a disquisition with [[Charles Wentworth Dilke|Dilke]], upon various subjects; several things dove-tailed in my mind, and at once it struck me what quality went to form a Man of Achievement, especially in Literature, and which [[Shakespeare]] possessed so enormously—I mean Negative Capability, that is, when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason—Coleridge, for instance, would let go by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of mystery, from being incapable of remaining content with half-knowledge. This pursued through volumes would perhaps take us no further than this, that with a great poet the sense of Beauty overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Keats | first = John | title = The Complete Poetical Works and Letters of John Keats, Cambridge Edition | publisher = Houghton, Mifflin and Company | year = 1899 | page=277| isbn = 978-1-146-96754-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] was, by 1817, a frequent target of criticism by the younger poets of Keats's generation, often ridiculed for his infatuation with German idealistic philosophy.  Against Coleridge's obsession with philosophical truth, Keats sets up the model of Shakespeare, whose poetry articulated various points of view and never advocated a particular vision of truth.

Keats's ideas here, as was usually the case in his letters, were expressed tersely with no effort to fully expound what he meant, but passages from other letters enlarge on the same theme.  In a letter to J.H. Reynolds in February, 1818, he wrote:  

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We hate poetry that has a palpable design upon us—and if we do not agree, seems to put its hand in its breeches pocket. Poetry should be great &amp; unobtrusive, a thing which enters into one's soul, and does not startle it or amaze it with itself but with its subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Keats | first = John | title = The Complete Poetical Works and Letters of John Keats, Cambridge Edition | publisher = Houghton, Mifflin and Company | year = 1899 | page=314| isbn = 978-1-146-96754-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another letter to Reynolds the following May, he contrived the metaphor of 'the chamber of maiden thought' and the notion of the 'burden of mystery', which together express much the same idea as that of negative capability:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I compare human life to a large Mansion of Many Apartments, two of which I can only describe, the doors of the rest being as yet shut upon me—The first we step into we call the infant or thoughtless Chamber, in which we remain as long as we do not think—We remain there a long while, and notwithstanding the doors of the second Chamber remain wide open, showing a bright appearance, we care not to hasten to it; but are at length imperceptibly impelled by the awakening of the thinking principle—within us—we no sooner get into the second Chamber, which I shall call the Chamber of Maiden-Thought, than we become intoxicated with the light and the atmosphere, we see nothing but pleasant wonders, and think of delaying there for ever in delight: However among the effects this breathing is father of is that tremendous one of sharpening one's vision into the heart and nature of Man—of convincing ones nerves that the World is full of Misery and Heartbreak, Pain, Sickness, and oppression—whereby This Chamber of Maiden Thought becomes gradually darken'd and at the same time on all sides of it many doors are set open—but all dark—all leading to dark passages—We see not the balance of good and evil.  We are in a Mist—We are now in that state—We feel the 'burden of the Mystery,' To this point was Wordsworth come, as far as I can conceive when he wrote 'Tintern Abbey' and it seems to me that his Genius is explorative of those dark Passages.  Now if we live, and go on thinking, we too shall explore them.  he is a Genius and superior to us, in so far as he can, more than we, make discoveries, and shed a light in them—Here I must think Wordsworth is deeper than Milton[.]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Keats | first = John | title = The Complete Poetical Works and Letters of John Keats, Cambridge Edition | publisher = Houghton, Mifflin and Company | year = 1899 | page=326| isbn = 978-1-146-96754-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Keats understood Coleridge as searching for a single, higher-order truth or solution to the mysteries of the natural world. He went on to find the same fault in Dilke and Wordsworth. All these poets, he claimed, lacked objectivity and universality in their view of the human condition and the natural world. In each case, Keats found a mind which was a narrow private path, not a "thoroughfare for all thoughts". Lacking for Keats were the central and indispensable qualities requisite for flexibility and openness to the world, or what he referred to as negative capability.&lt;ref&gt;Wigod, Jacob D. 1952. "Negative Capability and Wise Passiveness." PMLA 67 (4) (1 June): 384–386&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept of Negative Capability is precisely a rejection of set philosophies and preconceived systems of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, N. (1966). Negative Capability in Keats's Diction. Keats-Shelley Journal, 15, 59-68. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/30209856&lt;/ref&gt; He demanded that the poet be receptive rather than searching for fact or reason, and to not seek absolute knowledge of every truth, mystery, or doubt.&lt;ref&gt;Goellnicht, Donald. "Negative Capability and Wise Passiveness" MA Thesis. (McMaster University, 1976), 5, 11–12. http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/opendissertations/4675.
&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known why Keats settled on the phrase 'negative capability', but some scholars have hypothesized that Keats was influenced in his studies of medicine and chemistry, and that it refers to the [[electric polarity|negative pole]] of an [[electric current]] which is passive and receptive. In the same way that the negative pole receives the current from the positive pole, the poet receives impulses from a world that is full of mystery and doubt, which cannot be explained but which the poet can translate into art.&lt;ref&gt;Goellnicht, Donald. "Negative Capability and Wise Passiveness" MA Thesis. (McMaster University, 1976), 13. http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/opendissertations/4675.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unger: The thesis of negative capability==
[[Roberto Unger]] appropriated Keats' term in order to explain resistance to rigid social divisions and hierarchies. For Unger, ''negative capability'' is the "denial of whatever in our contexts delivers us over to a fixed scheme of division and hierarchy and to an enforced choice between routine and rebellion." It is thus through ''negative capability'' that we can further empower ourselves against social and institutional constraints, and loosen the bonds that entrap us in a certain social station.&lt;ref name="fn"&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 |pages=279–280, 632| isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of negative capability can be seen at work in industrial innovation. In order to create an innovator's advantage and develop new forms of economic enterprise, the modern industrialist could not just become more efficient with surplus extraction based on pre-existing work roles, but rather needed to invent new styles of flexible labor, expertise, and capital management. The industrialist needed to bring people together in new and innovative ways and redefine work roles and workplace organization. The modern factory had to at once stabilize its productive environment by inventing new restraints upon labor, such as length of the work day and division of tasks, but at the same time could not be too severe or risk being at a disadvantage to competitors, e.g. not being able to shift production tasks or capacity. Those industrialists and managers who were able to break old forms of organizational arrangements exercised negative capability.&lt;ref name="fn 299"&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 |pages=299–301| isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This thesis of ''negative capability'' is a key component in Unger's theory of [[false necessity]] and [[formative context]]. The theory of false necessity claims that our social worlds are the artifact of our own human endeavors. There is no pre-set institutional arrangement that our societies adhere to, and there is no necessary historical mold of development that they will follow. Rather we are free to choose and develop the forms and the paths that our societies will take through a process of conflicts and resolutions. However, there are groups of institutional arrangements that work together to bring out certain institutional forms, liberal democracy, for example. These forms are the basis of a social structure, and which Unger calls formative contexts. In order to explain how we move from one formative context to another without the conventional social theory constraints of historical necessity (e.g. feudalism to capitalism), and to do so while remaining true to the key insight of individual human empowerment and [[anti-necessitarian social thought]], Unger recognized that there are an infinite number of ways of resisting social and institutional constraints, which can lead to an infinite number of outcomes. This variety of forms of resistance and [[empowered democracy|empowerment]] (i.e. negative capability) make change possible.&lt;ref name="fn 35"&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 |pages=35–36, 164, 169, 278–80, 299–301| isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This thesis of ''negative capability'' addresses the problem of [[agency (sociology)|agency]] in relation to [[social structure|structure]]. It recognizes the constraints of structure and its molding influence upon the individual, but at the same time finds the individual able to resist, deny, and transcend their context. Unlike other theories of [[structure and agency]], ''negative capability'' does not reduce the individual to a simple actor possessing only the dual capacity of compliance or rebellion, but rather sees him as able to partake in a variety of activities of self empowerment.&lt;ref name="fn 282"&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 |pages=282| isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bion==
The twentieth-century British psychoanalyst [[Wilfred Bion]] elaborated on Keats's term to illustrate an attitude of openness of mind which he considered of central importance, not only in the psychoanalytic session, but in life itself.&lt;ref&gt;Joan and Neville Symington, ''The Clinical Thinking of Wilfrid Bion'' (1996) p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; For Bion, negative capability was the ability to tolerate the pain and confusion of not knowing, rather than imposing ready-made or omnipotent certainties upon an ambiguous situation or emotional challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Meg Harris Williams, ''The Aesthetic Development'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; His idea has been taken up more widely in the British Independent School,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1990) p. 10 and p. 13-4&lt;/ref&gt; as well as elsewhere in psychoanalysis and psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychoanalysisdownunder.com.au/issues/8/papers/106]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the context of Zen ==
The notion of negative capability has been associated with the Zen philosophy.  Keats' man of negative capability had qualities that enabled him to "lose his self-identity, his 'imaginative identification' with and submission to things, and his power to achieve a unity with life". The Zen concept of [[satori]] is the outcome of passivity and receptivity, culminating in "sudden insight into the character of the real".  Satori is reached without deliberate striving. The antecedent stages to satori: quest, search, ripening and explosion. The "quest" stage is accompanied by a strong feeling of uneasiness, resembling the capacity to practice negative capability while the mind is in a state of "uncertainties, mysteries and doubts". In the explosive stage (akin to Keats' 'chief intensity'), a man of negative capability effects a "fellowship with essence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benton|first=R. P.|date=1966|title=Keats and Zen. Philosophy East and West|url=|journal=Philosophy East and West, 16(1/2), pp. 33–47|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Stanley Fish]] has expressed strong reservations about the attempt to apply the concept of negative capability to social contexts. He has written in critique of Unger's early work as being unable to chart a route for the idea to pass into reality, which leaves history closed and the individual holding onto the concept while kicking against air. Fish finds the capability Unger invokes in his early works unimaginable and unmanufacturable that can only be expressed outright in blatant speech, or obliquely in concept.&lt;ref&gt;S. Fish, "Unger and Milton", in ''Doing What Comes Naturally'' (1989): 430&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, Fish finds the idea of radical culture as an oppositional ideal in which context is continuously refined or rejected impracticable at best, and impossible at worst.&lt;ref&gt;H. Avram Veeser ed., ''The Stanley Fish Reader'' (Oxford 1999) p.216-7&lt;/ref&gt; Unger has addressed these criticisms by developing a full theory of historical process in which negative capability is employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4715">'''Organization studies''' (also called '''organization science''' or '''organization theories''') is the inter-disciplinary academic field interested in a ''collective activity, and how it relates to organization, organizing, and management'' (see e.g. Tsoukas and Knudsen, 2005&lt;ref&gt;Tsoukas, H., &amp; Knudsen, C. (2005). The Oxford handbook of organization theory. Oxford Handbooks Online.&lt;/ref&gt; or Clegg et al., 2006&lt;ref&gt;Clegg, S. R., Hardy, C., Lawrence, T., &amp; Nord, W. R. (Eds.). (2006). The Sage handbook of organization studies. Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;). 
It has followed numerous 'turns' since its emergence in the 1960s: linguistic turn, spatial turn, practice turn, process turn, materiality turn, communication turn... A turn is a collective direction of research, focused on some coherent sets of concepts, theories, and ideas, which represent a point of bifurcation for the field itself. Most turns in organization studies relate to broader ones in social sciences and humanities. Researchers studying organizations and/or organizing processes have a recurring concern that those who work in organizations do not find organizational research particularly relevant. There is therefore growing interest in the impact of organization studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacIntosh|first=Robert|last2=Beech|first2=Nic|last3=Bartunek|first3=Jean|last4=Mason|first4=Katy|last5=Cooke|first5=Bill|last6=Denyer|first6=David|date=2017-01-01|title=Impact and Management Research: Exploring Relationships between Temporality, Dialogue, Reflexivity and Praxis|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8551.12207/abstract|journal=British Journal of Management|language=en|volume=28|issue=1|pages=3–13|doi=10.1111/1467-8551.12207|issn=1467-8551}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In spiritual terminology, '''piety''' is a [[virtue]] that may include [[religion|religious devotion]], [[spirituality]], or a mixture of both. A common element in most conceptions of piety is [[humility]].

== Etymology ==
The word piety comes from the [[Latin]] word ''[[Pietas (virtue)|pietas]]'', the noun form of the adjective ''pius'' (which means "devout" or "dutiful"). 

==Classical interpretation==
''Pietas'' in traditional Latin usage expressed a complex, highly valued [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] virtue; a man with ''pietas'' respected his responsibilities to gods, country, parents, and kin.&lt;ref&gt;See Cicero, ''Nature of the Gods'', 1. 116 and ''On Rhetorical Invention'', 2. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; In its strictest sense it was the sort of love a son ought to have for his father. [[Aeneas]]'s consistent epithet in [[Virgil]] and other Latin authors is ''pius'', a term that connotes reverence toward the gods and familial dutifulness. At the fall of Troy, Aeneas carries to safety his father, the lame [[Anchises]], and the [[Lares]] and [[Penates]], the statues of the household gods.

In addressing whether children have an obligation to provide support for their parents, [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] quotes, [[Cicero]], "..."piety gives both duty and homage": "duty" referring to service, and "homage" to reverence or honor."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3101.htm Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Theologiae'', "Question 101. Piety", Article 2]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Filial piety]] is central to Confucian [[role ethics|ethics]].&lt;ref name="Chang"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wonsuk Chang|author2=Leah Kalmanson|title=Confucianism in Context: Classic Philosophy and Contemporary Issues, East Asia and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_UC1mvUKaU8C&amp;pg=PA68|date=8 November 2010|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-3191-8|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a virtue==
In [[Roman Catholicism|Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Lutheranism]], and [[Anglicanism]], piety is one of the [[seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]]. "It engenders in the soul a filial respect for God, a generous love toward him, and an affectionate obedience that wants to do what he commands because it loves the one who commands."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/dictionary/index.cfm?id=33735 "Gift of Piety", Catholic Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Piety belongs to the virtue of Religion, which the concordant judgment of theologians put among the moral virtues, as a part of the [[Cardinal virtues|cardinal virtue]] Justice, since by it one tenders to God what is due to him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12748a.htm  Delany, Joseph. "Virtue of Religion." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 12 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Francis]] described piety as recognizing “our belonging to God, our deep bond with him, a relationship that gives meaning to our whole life and keeps us resolute, in communion with him, even during the most difficult and troubled moments” in life.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2014/06/04/piety-is-embracing-god-others-with-real-love-not-fake-devotion/ Glatz, Carol.  ''Catholic Herald'', 4 June 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "'''power behind the throne'''" refers to a person or [[cabal|group]] that informally exercises the real power of a high-ranking office, such as a [[head of state]]. In politics, it most commonly refers to a relative, aide, or nominal subordinate of a political leader (often called a "[[figurehead]]") who serves as ''[[de facto]]'' leader, setting policy through possessing great influence and/or skillful manipulation.

The original concept of a power behind the [[throne]] was a [[Medieval]]-era figure of speech referring to the fact that the [[monarch]]'s policies could be set by a counselor not seated in the throne but standing behind it&amp;mdash;perhaps whispering in the monarch's ear&amp;mdash;out of common sight.  Among the earliest examples of such powerful advisors were the [[Mayor of the Palace|Mayors of the Palace]] under the [[Merovingian]] kings.

==In history==
Historical examples of a "power behind the throne" include: [[Nogai Khan]], [[Mamai]] and [[Edigu]] in the [[Golden Horde]]; [[Diego Portales]] of [[Chile]]; [[Chancellor of Germany]] and [[Minister President of Prussia]] [[Otto von Bismarck]], with [[German Emperor]] and [[King of Prussia]] [[William I of Germany|William I]] as a de facto [[figurehead]]; [[Martin Bormann]] of [[Nazi Germany]]. The [[Genrō]] had this role in [[Meiji period]] of Japan. Another example is the rule of [[Pol Pot]] in Cambodia from 1975–78, who led the [[Khmer Rouge]] to victory following a devastating civil war. King [[Norodom Sihanouk]] returned to reign over Cambodia, but held no executive power.  

In the United States, [[Edith Bolling Galt Wilson|Edith Wilson]]—second wife of President [[Woodrow Wilson]]—took over many of the routine duties and details of the government after her husband was incapacitated by a [[stroke]]. Another modern example was [[Deng Xiaoping]] in China, who was recognized as China's [[paramount leader]] without holding the position of either [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]], [[President of the People's Republic of China|head of state]] or [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|head of government]].

Earlier examples include the ''[[Magister militum|magistri militum]]'' of the later decades of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. Examples of such are [[Stilicho]] the general of Emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]], the power behind the throne of Honorius' nephew [[Valentinian III]], [[Ricimer]] the puppet master of Emperors [[Avitus]], [[Majorian]], [[Libius Severus]], [[Anthemius|Procopius Anthemius]] and [[Olybrius]], and then finally [[Orestes (father of Romulus Augustulus)|Flavius Orestes]], the father of the usurper emperor [[Romulus Augustulus]], and the [[Heruli|Germanic]] chieftain [[Odoacer]], who were the masters in the West during the reigns of Emperor [[Julius Nepos]] and then Orestes' son, the aforementioned Romulus. Odoacer then deposed [[Romulus Augustulus|the figurehead Roman ruler]], captured and executed Orestes, and established his own Italian kingdom as the ''[[King of Italy|Dux Italiae]]'', only to be overthrown by the [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothic]] chieftain [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]] on the behest of the Eastern Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]].

In Latin America, an example was Joseph-Marie Córdoba Montoya during the Presidency of [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] (1988–1994). Córdoba Montoya, a French naturalized Mexican, was the Head of the Office of the Presidency, and was considered the second-most powerful man in Mexico at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Bussey, "Joseph Marie Córdoba Montoya" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'' vol. 1. p. 344. Chicago: Fitzroy and Dearborn 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another example in the same region is the one of the former general [[Manuel Noriega]], who was the military leader and the ''de facto'' [[President of Panama|chief of state of Panama]] from 1983 to 1989.

Notable Middle Eastern examples include the Crown Prince of [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Muhammad bin Salman]] who effectively rules the country for his {{age|1935|12|31}}-year old father [[King Salman]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-40354415&lt;/ref&gt; In Qatar, [[Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani]] was often called the power behind the throne of [[Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thedailybeast.com/qatars-succession-drama&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related terms==
A related term is ''[[éminence grise]]'' (French: "gray eminence"), a powerful advisor or decision-maker who operates secretly or otherwise unofficially. This phrase originally referred to [[Cardinal Richelieu|Cardinal de Richelieu]]'s right-hand man, [[François Leclerc du Tremblay]] (also known as the ''Père Joseph''), a [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin friar]] who wore grey robes. Because the Cardinal de Richelieu, the power behind the throne of King [[Louis XIII of France]], as a [[Catholic]] [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] was styled ''Son Eminence'' ("His Eminence"), his alter ego Père Joseph was called ''l'éminence grise'' (which is also the English title of his biography by [[Aldous Huxley]]). [[Martin Bormann]] was referred to as the Brown Eminence, brown referring to the brown uniform of the [[Nazi Party]].

The [[Proconsul#Modern_analogy|modern usage of the term Proconsul]], as analogy for a person from a foreign power manipulating another country's internal affairs, is also referred as the ''power behind the throne''.

In the branch of [[abstract algebra]] known as [[ring theory]], a '''left primitive ring''' is a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] which has a faithful simple [[left module]]. Well known examples include [[endomorphism ring]]s of [[vector spaces]] and [[Weyl algebra]]s over fields of characteristic zero.

== Definition ==
A [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''R'' is said to be a '''left primitive ring''' if and only if it has a [[faithful module|faithful]] [[simple module|simple]] [[module (mathematics)|left ''R''-module]].  A '''right primitive ring''' is defined similarly with right ''R''-modules. There are rings which are primitive on one side but not on the other. The first example was constructed by [[George Bergman|George M. Bergman]] in {{harv|Bergman|1964}}.  Another example found by Jategaonkar showing the distinction can be found in {{harv|Rowen|1988, p.159}}

An internal characterization of left primitive rings is as follows: a ring is left primitive if and only if there is a maximal [[left ideal]] containing no nonzero two-sided [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]]. The analogous definition for right primitive rings is also valid.

The structure of left primitive rings is completely determined by the [[Jacobson density theorem]]: A ring is left primitive if and only if it is isomorphic to a [[Jacobson density theorem#Topological characterization|dense]] subring of the [[ring of endomorphisms]] of a left [[vector space]] over a division ring.

Another equivalent definition states that a ring is left primitive if and only if it is a [[prime ring]] with a faithful left module of [[length of a module|finite length]] ({{harvnb|Lam|2001}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2T5DAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA191 Ex.&amp;nbsp;11.19, p.&amp;nbsp;191]).

==Properties==
One sided primitive rings are both [[semiprimitive ring]]s and [[prime ring]]s.  Since the ring product of two or more nonzero rings is not prime, it is clear that the product of primitive rings is never primitive.  

For a left [[Artinian ring]], it is known that the conditions "left primitive", "right primitive", "prime", and "[[simple ring|simple]]" are all equivalent, and in this case it is a [[semisimple ring]] isomorphic to a square matrix ring over a division ring.  More generally, in any ring with a minimal one sided ideal, "left primitive"="right primitive"="prime".

A [[commutative ring]] is left primitive if and only if it is a [[field (mathematics)|field]].

Being left primitive is a [[Morita equivalence|Morita invariant property]].

== Examples ==
Every [[simple ring]] ''R'' with unity is both left and right primitive.  (However, a simple non-unital ring may not be primitive.)  This follows from the fact that [[maximal ideal#Properties|''R'' has a maximal left ideal]] ''M'', and the fact that the [[quotient module]] ''R''/''M'' is a simple left ''R''-module, and that its [[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]] is a proper two-sided ideal in ''R''. Since ''R'' is a simple ring, this annihilator is {0} and therefore ''R''/''M'' is a faithful left ''R''-module.

[[Weyl algebra]]s over fields with [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] zero are primitive, and since they are [[domain (ring theory)|domain]]s, they are examples without minimal one-sided ideals.&lt;!-- how about positive char? --&gt;

===Full linear rings===
A special case of primitive rings is that of ''full linear rings''.  A '''left full linear ring''' is the ring of ''all'' linear transformations of an infinite dimensional left vector space over a division ring.  (A '''right full linear ring''' differs by using a right vector space instead.)  In symbols, &lt;math&gt;R=\mathrm{End}(_D V)\,&lt;/math&gt; where ''V'' is a vector space over a division ring ''D''.  It is known that ''R'' is a left full linear ring if and only if ''R'' is [[von Neumann regular]], [[Injective module#Self-injective rings|left self-injective]] with [[socle (mathematics)|socle]] soc(&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;''R'')≠{0}. {{harv|Goodearl|1991|p=100}} Through linear algebra arguments, it can be shown that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{End}(_D V)\,&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to the ring of [[matrix ring#Examples|row finite matrices]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{RFM}_I(D)\,&lt;/math&gt;, where ''I'' is an index set whose size is the dimension of ''V'' over ''D''.  Likewise right full linear rings can be realized as column finite matrices over ''D''.

Using this we can see that there are non-simple left primitive rings.  By the Jacobson Density characterization, a left full linear ring ''R'' is always left primitive. When dim&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;''V'' is finite ''R'' is a square matrix ring over ''D'', but when dim&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;''V'' is infinite, the set of finite rank linear transformations is a proper two-sided ideal of ''R'', and hence ''R'' is not simple.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11693">A '''problem statement''' is a concise description of an issue to be addressed or a condition to be improved upon. It identifies the gap between the current (problem) state and desired (goal) state of a process or product. Focusing on the facts, the problem statement should be designed to address [[Five_Ws|the 5 W’s]] – who, what, where, when, and why. The first condition of solving a problem is understanding the problem, which can be done by way of a problem statement.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kush|first=Max|date=June 2015|title=The Statement Problem|url=|journal=Quality Progress|volume=48|issue=6|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problem statements are widely used by businesses and organizations to execute process [[improvement]] projects. A simple and well-defined problem statement will be used by the project team to understand the problem and work toward developing a solution. It will also provide management with specific insights into the problem so that they can make appropriate project-approving decisions. As such, it is crucial for the problem statement to be clear and unambiguous.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Annamalai|first=Nagappan|last2=Kamaruddin|first2=Shahrul|last3=Azid|first3=Ishak Abdul|last4=Yeoh|first4=TS|date=September 2013|title=Importance of Problem Statement in Solving Industry Problems|url=|journal=Applied Mechanics and Materials|location=Zurich|volume=421|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The main purpose of the problem statement is to identify and explain the problem. This includes describing the existing environment, where the problem occurs, and what impacts it has on users, finances, and ancillary activities.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Six sigma for dummies|last=Gygi|first=Craig|last2=DeCarlo|first2=Neil|last3=Williams|first3=Bruce|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2015|isbn=|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=76-78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the problem statement is used to explain what the expected environment looks like. Defining the desired condition provides an overall vision for the process or product. It makes clear the purpose for initiating the improvement project and the goals that it is meant to accomplish.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ceptara.com/blog/how-to-write-problem-statement|title=How To Write A Problem Statement|last=Lindstrom|first=Chris|date=2011-04-24|website=www.ceptara.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important function of the problem statement is to be used as a communication device. It helps with obtaining buy-in from those involved in the project.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Before the project begins, the [[Stakeholder_(corporate)|stakeholders]] verify the problem and goals are accurately described in the problem statement. Once this approval is received, the project team reviews it to ensure everyone understands the issue at hand and what they are trying to accomplish. This also helps define the [[Scope_(project_management)|project scope]], which keeps the project concentrated on the overall goal.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Commercializing Great Products with Design for [[Six Sigma]]|last=Perry|first=Randy|last2=Bacon|first2=David|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem statement is referenced throughout the project to establish focus within the project team and verify they stay on track. At the end of the project, it is revisited to confirm the implemented solution indeed solves the problem. A well-defined problem statement can also aid in performing [[Root_cause_analysis|root-cause analysis]] to understand why the problem occurred and ensure measures can be taken to prevent it from happening in the future.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

It is important to note that the problem statement does ''not'' define the solution or methods of reaching the solution. The problem statement simply recognizes the gap between the problem and goal states. It can be said that, “a problem well stated is half solved.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, there are often multiple, viable solutions to a problem. Only after the problem statement is written and agreed upon should the solution(s) be discussed and the resulting course of action determined.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.proprojectmanager.com/problem-statement/|title=How to Write a Problem Statement|last=Shaffer|first=Deb|date=2017-07-12|work=ProProject Manager|access-date=2018-04-10|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defining the problem ==
Before the problem statement can be crafted, the problem must be defined. It is human nature to want to begin working on a solution as soon as possible and neglecting the definition of the true problem to be solved. However, a poorly defined problem increases the risk of implementing a solution that does not fully meet the expected results. A problem cannot be solved if it is not completely understood.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.batimes.com/articles/cooking-up-business-analysis-success.html|title=Cooking Up Business Analysis Success|last=Shaffer|first=David|date=2015-12-21|website=BA Times|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of defining the problem is often a group effort. It starts with meeting with the stakeholders, customers, and/or users affected by the issue (if possible) and learning about their pain points.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/04/02/take-these-steps-to-define-your-uiux-problem-and-avoid-haphazard-changes/#22f21cda7c6c|title=Take These Steps To Define Your UI/UX Problem And Avoid Haphazard Changes|last=Widen|first=Steven|date=2018-04-02|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-04-10|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since people often struggle with effectively communicating their issues, particularly to someone outside of the process, it is helpful to ask a series of “why” questions until the underlying reasoning is identified. This method, known as the “5 Why’s”, helps drill down to the core problem as many of the experienced frustrations could be mere symptoms of the actual problem.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Asking these additional questions as well as paraphrasing what the stakeholder had said demonstrates a degree of empathy and understanding of the problem.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The information collected from these initial interviews is only one part of problem analysis. Many times the problem extends to multiple areas or functions to which the stakeholders, customers, and users are unaware. They may also be familiar with what is happening on the surface but not necessarily the underlying cause. Therefore, it is just as essential to gather knowledge, information, and insights from project team members and subject matter experts concerning the problem.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Additional research materials, including work instructions, user manuals, product specifications, workflow charts, and previous project plans may also need to be consulted. Like most other stages in the process improvement project, defining the problem is often iterative as several rounds of discussions may be needed to get the full picture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Once the problem is understood and the circumstances driving the project initiation are clear, it is time to write the problem statement.

== Writing the problem statement ==
The problem statement will be used to gain project support and approval from stakeholders. As such, it must be action-oriented.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; More importantly, the problem statement must be written clearly and accurately in order to deliver successful results. A poorly crafted or incorrect problem statement will lead to a faulty solution, as well as wasted time, money, and resources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are several basic elements that can be built into every problem statement to decrease the risk of project failure. First, the problem statement must focus on the [[end user]]. A common mistake is focusing on “how” a problem will be solved rather than the current gap. Second, the problem statement shouldn’t be too broad. A benefit of using the “5 Why’s” approach is that it avoids over-simplicity by providing the details needed for understanding the problem and developing an appropriate solution. Finally, the problem statement shouldn’t be too narrow. Solution-bias stifles the creativity that arises while [[brainstorming]] a solution, which may result in a less-than-optimal experience for the user.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

It is useful to design and follow a specific format when writing a problem statement. While there are several options for doing this, the following is a simple and straightforward template often used in Business Analysis to maintain focus on defining the problem.

# '''IDEAL:''' This section is used to describe the desired or “to be” state of the process or product. It identifies the goals of the stakeholders and customers as well as assists in defining scope. At large, this section should illustrate what the expected environment would look like once the solution is implemented.
# '''REALITY:''' This section is used to describe the current or “as is” state of the process or product. It explains the pain points expressed by the stakeholders and customers. It should also include the insights and expertise of the project team and subject matter experts provided during problem analysis.
# '''CONSEQUENCES:''' This section is used to describe the impacts on the business if the problem is not fixed or improved upon. This includes costs associated with loss of money, time, productivity, competitive advantage, and so forth. The magnitude of these effects will also help determine the priority of the project.
# '''PROPOSAL:''' This section is used to describe potential solutions. Once the ideal, reality, and consequences sections have been completed, understood, and approved, the project team can start offering options for solving the problem. It can also include suggestions by the stakeholders and customers, although further discussions and research will be needed before a specific course of action can be determined.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

Following this format will result in a workable document that can be used by all parties to understand the problem and elicit requirements that will lead to a winning solution.

== Example ==
Problem statements can vary in length, depending on the complexity of the problem. The following is an example of a simple problem statement for the creation of a Single Sign On capability:

'''IDEAL'''

Ideally our users would be able sign into their laptops and then automatically have access to all of the applications they need to use.

'''REALITY'''

In reality we use at least three applications every day to accomplish our work. Each application is protected by a password with different requirements for username &amp; password length. Passwords also expire at different times.

'''CONSEQUENCES'''

* Users waste approximately 2 minutes per day logging into multiple applications (500 users * 2 minutes per day = 1000 minutes in lost productivity; 1000 minutes = 16.67 hrs per day * $75/hr = $1250 per day).
* Helpdesk resolves approximately 6000 calls per year to reset forgotten passwords &amp; unlock accounts.
* Security risk as users will continue to write usernames &amp; passwords on sticky notes at their desks.

'''PROPOSAL'''

Have S/W Dev, Network Administration and business stakeholders collaborate to evaluate potential solutions for a Single Sign On capability.

The '''psychology of reasoning''' is the study of how people [[reason]], often broadly defined as the process of drawing conclusions to inform how people solve problems and make decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Leighton, J. P. (2004).  [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=o1Tn_nkUhYkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=%22Defining+and+describing+reason%22&amp;ots=2IMoo4LPgx&amp;sig=e-nUVBv3U4MkVoymC71IZBU7dRo#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Defining%20and%20describing%20reason%22&amp;f=false Defining and describing reason], in ''The Nature of Reasoning'' (eds Leighton, J. P. and Sternberg, R. J.) Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; It overlaps with [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], [[linguistics]], [[cognitive science]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[logic]], and [[probability theory]].

Psychological experiments on how humans and other animals reason have been carried out for over 100 years. An enduring question is whether or not people have the capacity to be rational. What does it mean to be [[rationality|rational]]? Current research in this area addresses various questions about reasoning, rationality, judgments, [[intelligence]], relationships between [[emotion]] and reasoning, and development.

==Everyday reasoning==
How do people reason about sentences in natural language?  Most experimentation on deduction has been carried out on hypothetical thought, in particular, examining how people reason about [[Material conditional|conditional]]s, e.g., ''If A then B''.&lt;ref name=evans&gt;Evans, J.St.B.T., Newstead, S. and Byrne, R.M.J. (1993). Human Reasoning: ''The Psychology of Deduction''.  Hove, UK, Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt;   Participants in experiments make the [[modus ponens]] inference, given the [[indicative conditional]] ''If A then B'', and given the premise ''A'', they conclude ''B''. However, given the indicative conditional and the minor premise for the [[modus tollens]] inference,  ''not-B'', about half of the participants in experiments conclude ''not-A'' and the remainder concludes that nothing follows.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;

The ease with which people make conditional inferences is affected by content, as demonstrated in the well-known  [[Wason selection task|selection task]] developed by [[Peter Wason]]. Participants are better able to test a conditional that contains sensible content, e.g., ''if the envelope is sealed then it must have a 50 cent stamp on it'' compared to one that contains symbolic content, e.g.,'' if the letter is a vowel then the number is even''.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt; Background knowledge can also lead to the suppression of even the simple modus ponens inference &lt;ref&gt;Byrne, R.M.J. (1989). [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010027789900188 Suppressing valid inferences with conditionals]. ''Cognition'', 31,61-83&lt;/ref&gt; Participants given the conditional ''if Lisa has an essay to write then she studies late in the library'' and the premise ''Lisa has an essay to write '' make the [[modus ponens]] inference 'she studies late in the library',  but the inference is suppressed when they are also given a second conditional ''if the library stays open then she studies late in the library''. Interpretations of the suppression effect are controversial &lt;ref&gt;Bonnefon, J-F. &amp; Hilton, D. (2002). [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13546780143000134 The suppression of modus ponens as a case of pragmatic preconditional reasoning]. ''Thinking and Reasoning'', 8, 21-40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, R.M.J., Espino, O. &amp; Santamaria, C.  (1999). Counterexamples and the suppression of  inferences." Journal of Memory &amp; Language", 40, 347-373.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other investigations of propositional inference examine how people think about disjunctive alternatives, e.g., ''A or else B'', and how they reason about negation, e.g., ''It is not the case that A and B''. Many experiments have been carried out to examine how people make relational inferences, including comparisons, e.g., ''A is better than B''. Such investigations also concern spatial inferences, e.g. ''A is in front of B'' and temporal inferences, e.g. ''A occurs before B''.&lt;ref name="johnson-laird byrne deduction"&gt;[[Philip Johnson-Laird|Johnson-Laird, P.N.]] and Byrne, R.M.J. (1991). Deduction. Hillsdale: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; Other common tasks include [[categorical syllogisms]], used to examine how people reason about quantifiers such as ''All'' or ''Some'', e.g., ''Some of the A are not B''.&lt;ref name="how we reason"&gt;Johnson-Laird, P.N. (2006). "How we reason". Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories of reasoning ==
There are several alternative theories of the cognitive processes that human reasoning is based on.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, R.M.J. and Johnson-Laird, P.N. (2009).'If' and the problems of conditional reasoning. ''Trends in Cognitive Sciences'', 13, 282-287&lt;/ref&gt; One view is that people rely on a mental logic consisting of formal (abstract or syntactic) inference rules similar to those developed by logicians in the [[propositional calculus]].&lt;ref&gt;O’Brien, D. (2009). Human reasoning requires a mental logic. ''Behav. Brain Sci.'' 32, 96–97&lt;/ref&gt; Another view is that people rely on domain-specific or content-sensitive rules of inference.&lt;ref&gt;Cosmides, L. et al. (2005) Detecting cheaters. ''Trends in Cognitive Sciences''. 9,505–506&lt;/ref&gt; A third view is that people rely on [[mental models]], that is, mental representations that correspond to imagined possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Laird, P.N. and Byrne, R.M.J. (2002) Conditionals: a theory of meaning, inference, and pragmatics. ''Psychol. Rev.'' 109, 646–678&lt;/ref&gt; The mental model theory is the subject of the [http://mentalmodelsblog.wordpress.com ''mental models website'']. A fourth view is that people compute probabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Oaksford, M. and Chater, N. (2007) ''Bayesian Rationality''. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

One controversial theoretical issue is the identification of an appropriate competence model, or a standard against which to compare human reasoning.   Initially [[classical logic]] was chosen as a competence model.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Peter Wason|Wason]], P. C. (1966). "Reasoning", in Foss, B. M.: New horizons in psychology. Harmondsworth: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, some researchers opted for [[non-monotonic logic]]&lt;ref&gt;Da Silva Neves, R., Bonnefon, J. F., &amp; Raufaste, É. (2002). An empirical test for patterns of nonmonotonic inference. ''Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence'', 34, 107-130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith Stenning|Stenning]], K. &amp; van Lambalgen, M. (2005). Semantic Interpretation as Computation in Nonmonotonic Logic: The Real Meaning of the Suppression Task. ''Cognitive Science'', 29, 919-960&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] [[probability]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Oaksford, M. &amp; Chater, N. (2001) [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661300016995 The probabilistic approach to human reasoning]. ''Trends in Cognitive Sciences'', 5, 349-357&lt;/ref&gt; Research on [[mental models and reasoning]] has led to the suggestion that people are rational in principle but err in practice.&lt;ref name="johnson-laird byrne deduction"/&gt;&lt;ref name="how we reason" /&gt;  Connectionist approaches towards reasoning have also been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ron Sun|Sun]], R. (1994). ''Integrating Rules and Connectionism for Robust Commonsense Reasoning''. John Wiley and Sons, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of reasoning==
How does reasoning develop? [[Jean Piaget]]'s [[theory of cognitive development]]&lt;ref&gt;Demetriou, A. (1998). Cognitive development. In A. Demetriou, W. Doise, K. F. M. van Lieshout (Eds.), Life-span developmental psychology (pp. 179-269). London: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; describes a sequence of stages in the development of reasoning from infancy to adulthood. According to the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]], changes in reasoning with development come from increasing [[working memory]] capacity, increasing [[speed of processing]], and enhanced [[executive functions]] and control. Increasing [[self-awareness]] is also an important factor.&lt;ref&gt;Demetriou, A., Mouyi, A., &amp; Spanoudis, G. (2010). The development of mental processing. Nesselroade, J. R. (2010). Methods in the study of life-span human development: Issues and answers. In W. F. Overton (Ed.), Biology, cognition and methods across the life-span. Volume 1 of the Handbook of life-span development (pp. 36-55), Editor-in-chief: R. M. Lerner. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Different sorts of reasoning==
[[Inductive reasoning]] makes broad generalizations from specific cases or observations.  In this process of reasoning, general assertions are made based on past specific pieces of evidence.  This kind of reasoning allows the conclusion to be false even if the original statement is true.&lt;ref name=reisberg&gt;Reisberg, Daniel. (2013). Cognition: Exploring the Science of the Mind. W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if one observes a college athlete, one makes predictions and assumptions about other college athletes based on that one observation. Scientists use inductive reasoning to create theories and hypotheses.&lt;ref name=livescience&gt;LiveScience Staff. (2012). Deductive Reasoning vs. Inductive Reasoning. Retrieved from http://www.livescience.com/21569-deduction-vs-induction.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In opposition, [[deductive reasoning]] is a basic form of valid reasoning.&lt;ref name=livescience /&gt;  In this reasoning process a person starts with a known claim or a general belief and from there asks what follows from these foundations or how will these premises influence other beliefs.&lt;ref name=reisberg /&gt;  In other words, deduction starts with a hypothesis and examines the possibilities to reach a conclusion.&lt;ref name=livescience /&gt;  Deduction helps people understand why their predictions are wrong and indicates that their prior knowledge or beliefs are off track.   An example of deduction can be seen in the scientific method when testing hypotheses and theories.  Although the conclusion usually corresponds and therefore proves the hypothesis, there are some cases where the conclusion is logical, but the generalization is not.  For example, the argument, “All young girls wear skirts.  Julie is a young girl.  Therefore, Julie wears skirts,” is valid logically, but is not sound because the first premise isn't true.

The [[syllogism]] is a form of deductive reasoning in which two statements reach a logical conclusion.  With this reasoning, one statement could be “Every A is B” and another could be “This C is A”.  Those two statements could then lead to the conclusion that “This C is B”.  These types of syllogisms are used to test deductive reasoning to ensure there is a valid hypothesis.&lt;ref name=livescience /&gt;  A Syllogistic Reasoning Task was created from a study performed by Morsanyi, Kinga, Handley, and Simon that examined the intuitive contributions to reasoning.  They used this test to assess why “syllogistic reasoning performance is based on an interplay between a conscious and effortful evaluation of logicality and an intuitive appreciation of the believability of the conclusions”.&lt;ref&gt;Morsanyi, Kinga; Handley, Simon J. (2011). Syllogistic Reasoning Task. doi:10.1037/t09520-000&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of reasoning is called [[abductive reasoning]].  This type is based on creating and testing hypotheses using the best information available.  Abductive reasoning produces the kind of daily decision-making that works best with the information present, which often is incomplete.  This could involve making educated guesses from observed unexplainable phenomena.  This type of reasoning can be seen in the world when doctors make decisions about diagnoses from a set of results or when jurors use the relevant evidence to make decisions about a case.&lt;ref name=livescience /&gt;

==Judgment and reasoning==
Judgment and reasoning involve thinking through the options, making a judgment or conclusion and finally making a decision. Making judgments involves heuristics, or efficient strategies that usually lead you to the right answers.&lt;ref name=reisberg /&gt; The most common heuristics used are attribute substitution, the [[availability heuristic]], the [[representativeness heuristic]] and the [[anchoring]] heuristic – these all aid in quick reasoning and work in most situations. Heuristics allow for errors, a price paid to gain efficiency.&lt;ref name=reisberg /&gt;
 
Other errors in judgment, therefore affecting reasoning, include errors in judgment about covariation – a relationship between two variables such that the presence and magnitude of one can predict the presence and magnitude of the other.&lt;ref name=reisberg /&gt; One cause of covariation is [[confirmation bias]], or the tendency to be more responsive to evidence that confirms your beliefs. But assessing covariation can be pulled off track by neglecting base-rate information – how frequently something occurs in general.&lt;ref name=reisberg /&gt; However people often ignore base rates and tend to use other information presented.
 
There are more sophisticated judgment strategies that result in fewer errors. People often reason based on availability but sometimes they look for other, more accurate, information to make judgments.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheimer, D.M. (2004). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.320.7365&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Spontaneous discounting of availability in frequency judgment tasks]. Psychological Science, 15, 100-105.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests there are two ways of thinking, known as the [[Dual process theory|Dual-Process Model]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans, J. S. B. T. (2012a). Dual-process theories of deductive reasoning: Facts and fallacies. In Holyoak, K. J., &amp; Morrison, R. G. (Eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BNdBAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22dual-process%22&amp;f=false The Oxford Handbook of Thinking and Reasoning] (pp. 115-133). New York, NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The first, System I, is fast, automatic and uses heuristics – more of intuition. The second, System II, is slower, effortful and more likely to be correct – more reasoning.&lt;ref name=reisberg /&gt;

==Pragmatics and reasoning==
* How do various related factors such as linguistic [[pragmatics]] and [[emotion]] relate to the inferences people draw?&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Noveck, I. A. (2004) Pragmatic Inferences Related to Logical Terms. In Noveck, I. A. &amp; [[Dan Sperber|Sperber]], D. (ed.), ''Experimental Pragmatics'', Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blanchette, I. &amp; Richards, A. (2004). [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00751.x Reasoning about emotional and neutral materials]. Is logic affected by emotion? ''Psychological Science'', 15, 745-75&lt;/ref&gt;

Decision making is often influenced by the emotion of regret and the element of risk. People are strongly motivated by regret and we can see this when they select options they tend to select the option that they will regret the least trying to minimize the amount of regret we will have.&lt;ref&gt;Connolly, T., &amp; Zeelenberg, M. (2002). [http://www.bbs.sciopsy.com/viewthread.php?tid=2761&amp;extra=&amp;page=1 Regret in decision making]. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 11, 212-216.&lt;/ref&gt; Many decisions also include a large element of risk, and in these cases people tend to ask themselves what the level of risk is. They ask themselves how much dread they would experience when thinking about a nuclear accident, and then use that dread as an indicator of risk.&lt;ref&gt;Slovic, P., et al., (2002). The affect heuristic. In t. Gilvoch, D. Griffen, &amp; New York, NY: Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; We ask “how does this make me feel?” rather than “how risky is this?”

[[Antonio Damasio]] suggests that [[Somatic marker hypothesis|somatic markers]], certain memories that can cause a strong bodily reaction, act as a way to guide decision making as well. For example, when you are remembering a scary movie and once again become tense and your palms might begin to sweat. Damasio argues that when making a decision we rely on our “gut feelings” to assess various options, and this makes us decide to go with a decision that is more positive and stay away from those that are negative.&lt;ref&gt;Damasio, A.R. (1994) Descartes’ error: Emotion reason, and the human brain. New York, NY: Putnam.&lt;/ref&gt; He also argues that the orbitofrontal cortex - located at the base of the frontal lobe, just above the eyes - is crucial in your use of somatic markers, because it is the part in the brain that allows you to interpret emotion.

Another note to make is that when emotion shapes decisions, the influence is usually based on predictions of the future. When people ask themselves how they would react, they are making inferences about the future. Researchers suggest [[affective forecasting]], the ability to predict your own emotions, is poor because people tend to overestimate how much they will regret their errors.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Morewedge, Risen, &amp; Wilson, T. D. (2004). [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00681.x Looking forward to looking backward]. Psychology Science, 15, 346-350.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neuroscience of reasoning==
* What are the neural correlates of reasoning, often investigated using [[event-related potentials]] and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]]?&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Goel, V. (2005). Cognitive Neuroscience of Deductive Reasoning.  In Holyoak, K. J. &amp; Morrison, R. G. (ed.). ''The Cambridge Handbook of Thinking and Reasoning'', Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

A  '''school of thought''' (or '''intellectual tradition''') is the perspective of a group of people who share common characteristics of [[opinion]] or outlook of a [[philosophy]], [[List of academic disciplines|discipline]], [[belief]], [[social movement]], [[Schools of economic thought|economics]], [[cultural movement]], or [[art movement]].

Schools are often characterized by their currency, and thus classified into "new" and "old" schools. There is a convention, in political and philosophical fields of thought, to have  "modern" and "classical" schools of thought. An example is the [[social liberalism|modern]] and [[classical liberalism|classical liberals]]. This dichotomy is often a component of [[paradigm shift]]. However, it is rarely the case that there are only two schools in any given field.

Schools are often named after their founders such as the "[[Rinzai school]]" of [[Zen]], named after [[Linji Yixuan]]; and the [[Asharite]] school of [[early Muslim philosophy]], named after [[Abu l'Hasan al-Ashari]]. They are often also named after their places of origin, such as the [[Ionian School (philosophy)|Ionian school]] of [[philosophy]], which originated in [[Ionia]]; the [[Chicago school (architecture)|Chicago school]] of [[architecture]], which originated in [[Chicago, Illinois]]; the [[Prague school]] of linguistics, named after a linguistic circle founded in [[Prague]]; and the [[Tartu–Moscow Semiotic School]], whose representatives lived in [[Tartu]] and [[Moscow]].

'''''The Morals of Chess''''' is an essay on [[chess]] by the American intellectual [[Benjamin Franklin]], which was first published in ''The Columbian Magazine'' in December 1786. 

Franklin, who was one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], played chess from at least 1733. Evidence suggests that he was an above-average player, who, however, did not reach the top level. He outlined the essay around 1732, but did not publish it until 1786. After a short prologue in which Franklin details the history of chess he gets to the main part of his essay. He compares chess to life and writes that foresight, circumspection and caution can be learnt from the game. After describing the effects chess can have on one's perception of life he describes a set of moral rules that a chess player should hold, including to not cheat and not disturb the opponent. Franklin suggests that the opponent be told about mistakes he makes, for example if he would lose a piece.

The essay is one of the first texts about chess that was published in the United States; it appeared in the first chess-related book that was published in Russia in 1791. It still is widely reproduced, especially on the Internet. In 1999 Franklin was inducted into the [[World Chess Hall of Fame|U.S. Chess Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;John McCrary: [http://www.benfranklin300.org/_etc_pdf/Chess_John_McCrary.pdf ''Chess and Benjamin Franklin—his pioneering contributions''], including the full text of ''The Morals of Chess''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Washing out mouth with soap''' is a traditional form of [[physical punishment]] that consists in placing [[soap]], or a similar cleansing agent, inside a person's mouth so that the person will taste it, inducing what most people consider an unpleasant experience.  This form of punishment was especially common in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] from the late 19th century through the 1960s.

Washing out mouth with soap is most often used as a response to [[profanity]], [[Lie|lying]], [[biting]],&lt;ref&gt;Old Remedy Not Advised. Portsmouth Daily Times - May 3, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; [[tobacco use]], or verbal disrespect. It functions both as a symbolic "cleansing" following the infraction, as well as acting as a deterrent due to the foul [[aftertaste]]. It is commonly used as [[child discipline]] or [[school discipline]], and is more frequently employed by mothers than fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Dimensions of discipline by fathers and mothers as recalled by university students http://gauss.unh.edu/~mas2/DD03%20Draft%20D9.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407082144/http://gauss.unh.edu/~mas2/DD03%20Draft%20D9.pdf |date=2014-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This punishment still has advocates today, even though its use has diminished considerably in recent years in favour of [[discipline]] methods that are not considered [[violence|violent]] or [[humiliation|humiliating]]. Additionally, ingestion of [[soap]]s and [[detergent]]s can have potentially serious health consequences, and persons utilizing this form of punishment may face legal sanctions.

==Technique==
Washing out mouth with soap is essentially defined by the introduction of soap, or a soap-like cleansing agent, into the [[oral cavity]].  Methods commonly used for this purpose include placing a bar of soap in a person's mouth and forcing them to hold it there, chew it, and/or swallow it; forcing a person to drink liquid soap or another liquid cleanser or to swish such liquids in their mouth; and using a toothbrush to brush the used cleaning product onto a person's teeth and oral tissues.

Washing out mouth with soap is meant to be unpleasant, but is usually not intended to cause death or serious harm.  Nonetheless, many people employ the aforementioned techniques with extremely limited knowledge regarding the safety of ingesting their chosen cleansing agents.  Agents likely to cause serious harm if swallowed include many [[automatic dishwasher detergent]]s and [[laundry detergent]]s.  Even ordinary bar soaps and liquid hand soaps may cause harmful effects including [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], irritation of the lining of the mouth and [[digestive tract]], and in rare instances, [[pulmonary aspiration]].  This is especially true if these products are ingested in large quantities.

==History==
{{rquote|left|A friend of mine was horrified one day by hearing her little boy make use of a very bad word [...] Turning to the maid she said, "Jane, you may take Master Dick up stairs and wash his mouth out with soap and water. It is too soiled for him to sit at the table with us..."|[[Good Housekeeping]], 1889&lt;ref&gt;Good Housekeeping: Volume 9 - Page 276. 1889&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One of the earliest recorded uses of forcing another to ingest soap as punishment appeared in the 1832 [[Legal Examiner]], in which it was noted that a married couple "were constantly quarrelling ; and that one evening, on the man's return home, he found his wife intoxicated, [...] perceiving a piece of kitchen soap lying on the ground near the spot, he crammed it into his wife's mouth, saying, "She has had plenty of water to wash with, she ought now to have a little soap".&lt;ref&gt;The Legal examiner: Volume 1 - Page 508. Great Britain. Courts - 1832&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860s, the periodical [[Aunt Judy's Annual Volume]] featured the main characters forced to eat a bar of soap as punishment for constantly failing to wash up, as the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] to a story entitled "Scaramouches at School".&lt;ref&gt;Volume 6, Issue 32 (Aunt Judy's Annual Volume)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872, [[The Chinese Recorder and Missionary Journal]] stated that the practice of washing out the mouth of a child heard to swear was noted by an American colleague, and should be recommended to colleagues in the Orient as well.&lt;ref&gt;The Chinese recorder and missionary journal - Page 452. ''A friend of the writer in America called into the bath room a little son who was heard for the first time to swear, and scrubbed his mouth out with soap and a nail brush''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873, a schoolmistress in [[Mahaska County, Iowa|Mahaska, Iowa]] was noted to have punished a boy in her class for indulging in [[chewing tobacco]] by washing his mouth out with soap.&lt;ref&gt;The New York State educational journal: devoted to popular ...: Volumes 2-3 - Page 607books.google.comO. R. Burchard, New York State Teachers Association - 1873&lt;/ref&gt;  Much later examples tell how [[Filipino people|Filipino]] or [[Lakota people|Lakota]] aboriginals were punished for speaking their native language with a similar punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Styles of speaking: an analysis of Lakota communication alternatives ES Grobsmith - Anthropological Linguistics, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Man in the Outhouse: How Western Colonization Silenced the Filipino Imagination. P Abarquez-Delacruz - Amerasia Journal, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

An 1898 "study in moral education", published by the [[Journal of Genetic Psychology]], noted that whipping, withdrawal of privileges, lectures, being sent alone to a room and washing out a subject's mouth with either soap, salt or pepper, were the most likely punishments to deter future abuses.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of genetic psychology: Volume 5. [[Granville Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Allanmore Murchison]] - 1898&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, a New York State Department of Social Welfare officer submitted a complaint against the [[Rochester Orphan Asylum]] noting that "I find, as charged, that children's mouths have been washed with soap-suds, but not, as also charged, with ashes and water; that such punishments were ordered for obscene or profane language".&lt;ref&gt;Report. New York (State). Dept. of Social Welfare - 1890&lt;/ref&gt; By the start of the 20th century, the practice was also noted at the [[Maryland State Reformatory for Women]] as punishment for any infraction of the rules.&lt;ref&gt;Initiated Water Cure. The Sun (1837-1985) - Baltimore, Md. Date: Dec 21, 1919&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, washing out mouth with soap was a [[hazing ritual]] in the British [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavyresearcharchive.org.uk/SLINGER/SLING-1.HTM|title=Birth of SLINGER|website=www.royalnavyresearcharchive.org.uk|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, several American schoolboards ruled in favour of washing out a pupil's mouth with soap as a legitimate punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Washing Mouth With Soap Ruled Okay .St. Petersburg Times - Dec 14, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mouth-Washing Of Pupil Seen As Not Violating School Policy -Hartford Courant - Apr 29, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, Wisconsin judge Harvey L. Neelan fined a Miss Mertz $25 for her drunken obscenities and noted that she should be required to wash her mouth with soap.&lt;ref&gt;The Milwaukee Journal - Jan 16, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1963, Michigan judge Francis Castellucci ordered Louis Winiarski, who had been found using obscene language around women and children, to wash his mouth with soap before leaving the courtroom.&lt;ref&gt;Kentucky New Era - Jul 10, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; A similar case in October 1979 saw a New York resident choose to wash his mouth out with soap, rather than serve ten days in prison for his disorderly conduct and obscenities.&lt;ref&gt;The Press-Courier - Oct 19, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the [[National Criminal Justice Reference System]] published a report defending the use of corporal punishment in schools, in which a school administrator noted that he documented 200 cases, over his 13-year career, of using corporal punishmenting, noting "That's not just using paddles in every instance, but if you shake a student, if you grab a student, if you wash a student's mouth out with soap, that's corporal punishment under the definition of the law".&lt;ref&gt;A practical defense of corporal punishment in the schools[PDF] from ncjrs.govLK Reinholz - Hyman, IA, &amp; Wise, JH (1979). Corporal punishment in schools, 1977. https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/51400NCJRS.pdf#page=37&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the [[Journal of Youth and Adolescence]] listed the practise, alongside [[Paddle (spanking)|paddling]] and [[hairpulling]] as a "moderate" punishment for children, beneath the realm of "severe" punishment such as [[Flagellation|whipping]].&lt;ref&gt;Corporal punishment: Normative data and sociological and psychological correlates in a community college population. JW Bryan… - Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly in 1996, the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] classified it as an alternative to [[spanking]].&lt;ref&gt;A review of the outcomes of parental use of nonabusive or customary physical punishment. RE Larzelere - Pediatrics, 1996 - Am Acad Pediatrics&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, students at the [[Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts]] carried out a [[peer-reviewed]] study on the ability of punishment to curb the use of profanity by interviewing colleagues on their remembered upbringings, and noted that the most commonly reported parental reaction was a verbal reprimand (41%). Soap in the mouth was mentioned in 20% of the episodes, and physical punishments were described in 14%.&lt;ref&gt;Memories of punishment for cursing.

[[File:Bobcat urbanLandscape.jpg|thumb|A bobcat (''[[Lynx rufus]]'') using a wildlife corridor to cross between habitats in an urban area.]]

A '''wildlife corridor''', '''habitat corridor''', or '''green corridor'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/england/professionals/en/1115310689250.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201180024/http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/england/professionals/en/1115310689250.html |date=1 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an area of [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] connecting [[wildlife]] populations separated by human activities or structures (such as roads, development, or logging). This allows an exchange of individuals between populations, which may help prevent the negative effects of [[inbreeding]] and reduced genetic diversity (via [[genetic drift]]) that often occur within isolated populations.  Corridors may also help facilitate the re-establishment of populations that have been reduced or eliminated due to [[Disturbance (ecology)|random events (such as fires or disease)]].

This may potentially moderate some of the worst effects of habitat fragmentation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bond, M.|date=2003|title=Principles of Wildlife Corridor Design. Center for Biological Diversity|url=http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/publications/papers/wild-corridors.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Biologivaldiversity.org|accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein [[urbanization]] can split up habitat areas, causing animals to lose both their natural habitat and the ability to move between regions to use all of the resources they need to survive.  Habitat fragmentation due to [[Human development theory|human development]] is an ever-increasing threat to [[biodiversity]], and habitat corridors are a possible mitigation.

==Purpose==
The main goal of implementing habitat corridors is to increase [[biodiversity]]. When areas of land are broken up by human interference, population numbers become unstable and many animal and plant species become endangered. By re-connecting the fragments, the population fluctuations can decrease dramatically. Corridors can contribute to three factors that stabilize a population: 
* '''[[Colonisation (biology)|Colonization]]'''—animals are able to move and occupy new areas when food sources or other natural resources are lacking in their core habitat.
* '''[[Animal migration|Migration]]'''—species that relocate seasonally can do so more safely and effectively when it does not interfere with human development barriers.
* '''Interbreeding'''—animals can find new mates in neighboring regions so that [[genetic diversity]] can increase and thus have a positive impact on the overall population.

Rosenberg et.al. (1995) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Daniel K. |last2=Noon |first2=Barry R. |last3=Meslow |first3=E. Charles |title=Towards a definition of wildlife corridor |journal=Integrating People and Wildlife for a Sustainable Future |date=1995 |volume=Proceedings of the First International Wildlife Congress |pages=436–9 |url=https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/3662 |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; were among the first to define what constitutes a wildlife corridor. The definitions of "[[biological corridor]]" (i.e., wildlife corridor) had, in the early years of studying corridors, been "vague and inconsistent, and often they confound form and function" Rosenberg et.al. developed a [[conceptual model]] that emphasized the role of a wildlife corridor as a facilitator of movement that is not restricted by requirements of [[native vegetation]] or intermediate [http://www.umass.edu/landeco/research/fragstats/documents/Conceptual%20Background/What%20is%20a%20Landscape/What%20is%20a%20Landscape.htm target patches of habitat]. Their definition simply required that movement to a target patch via the corridor be greater that if the corridor were absent.

Although corridors had originally been implemented with the assumption that they would increase biodiversity, not enough research had been done to come to a solid conclusion. The case for corridors has been built more on intuition and much less on [[Empirical research|empirical evidence]] (Tewksbury et al. 2002). Tewksbury et. al. claimed that the early controversies had arisen because most studies had been limited in that they had a narrow taxonomic focus and, that if corridors facilitate animal movement, they should also have strong indirect effects on plant [[populations]] due to increased [[pollen]] and [[seed]] by animals. Results of their 2002 experiment provided a large-scale experimental demonstration that [[habitat]] (or wildlife) corridors facilitate movement of disparate [[Taxon|taxa]] between otherwise isolated patches even after controlling for area effects (Tewksbury et al, 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tewksbury |first1=Joshua |title=Corridors affect plants, animals, and their interactions in fragmented landscapes |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=October 1, 2002 |volume=99 |issue=20 |pages=12923–6 |doi=10.1073/pnas.202242699 |pmid=12239344 |pmc=130561 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/99/20/12923.short |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  Another factor that needs to be taken into account is what species the corridor is intended for. Some species have reacted more positively to corridors than others.

A habitat corridor could be considered as a possible solution in an area where the destruction of a natural area has greatly affected its [[native species]]. Development such as [[roads]], [[buildings]], and [[farms]] can interrupt plants and animals in the region being destroyed. Furthermore, [[natural disaster]]s such as [[wildfire]]s and [[flood]]s can leave animals with no choice but to evacuate. If the habitat is not connected to a safer one, it will ultimately lead to death. A remaining portion of natural habitat is called a remnant, and such portions need to be connected because when migration decreases, extinction increases (Fleury 1997).

Corridors can be made in two distinct areas—either water or land. Water corridors are called riparian ribbons and usually come in the form of rivers and streams. Land corridors come on a scale as large as wooded strips connecting larger woodland areas. However, they can also be as simple as [[Hedge|a line of shrubs along a sidewalk]] (Fleury 1997). Such areas can facilitate the movement of small animals, especially birds, from tree to tree, until they find a safe habitat to nest in. Not only do minimal corridors aid in the movement of animals, they are also aesthetically pleasing, which can sometimes encourage the community to accept and support them.

== Users ==
Species can be categorized in one of two groups; passage users and corridor dwellers.

Passage users occupy corridors for brief periods of time. These animals use corridors for such events as [[wikt:migration|seasonal migration]], [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] of a juvenile, or moving between parts of a large home range. Usually large [[Herbivory|herbivores]], medium to large [[carnivore]]s, and migratory species are passage users (Beier &amp; Loe 1992). One common misconception is that the corridor only needs to be wide enough for the passage users to get through. However, the corridor still must be wide enough to be safe and also encourage the animals to use it, even though they do not live out their entire lives in it.

Corridor dwellers can occupy the passage anywhere from several days to several years. Species such as [[plants]], [[reptiles]], [[amphibians]], [[birds]], [[insects]], and small [[mammals]] can spend their entire lives in linear habitats. In this case, the corridor must include everything that a species needs to live and breed, such as soil for [[germination]], burrowing areas, and multiple other breeding adults (Beier &amp; Loe 1992).

== Types ==
Habitat corridors can be categorized according to their width. Typically the wider the corridor, the more use it will get from species. However, the width-length ratio, as well as design and quality play just as important of a role in creating the perfect corridor (Fleury 1997). The strip of land will suffer less from [[edge effect]]s such as weeds, predators, and chemicals if it is constructed properly.  The following are three divisions in corridor widths: 
* '''Regional''' – (&gt;500m wide); connect major ecological gradients such as migratory pathways.
* '''Sub-regional''' – (&gt;300m wide); connect larger vegetated landscape features such as ridgelines and valley floors.
* '''Local''' – (some &lt;50m); connect remnant patches of gullies, wetlands, ridgelines, etc.

Habitat corridors can also be divided according to their continuity. Continuous corridors are strips that are not broken up, while “stepping stone” corridors are small patches of suitable habitat. When stepping stones are arranged in a line, they form a strip of land connecting two areas, just like a continuous corridor would. Both kinds provide linkages between protected core areas and stimulate or allow species to migrate.

Finally, corridors can come in the form of [[underpass]]es or [[overpass]]es, which can be very safe for both animals and humans. Many busy highways cross through natural habitats that native species occupy, as well. Large animals such as deer become a hazard when they cross in front of [[traffic]] and get hit. An overpass or an underpass serves as a bridge to facilitate the movement of animals across a busy road. Observations have shown that underpasses are actually more successful than overpasses because many times animals are too timid to cross over a bridge in front of traffic and would prefer to be more hidden (Dole et al. 2003).
[[Image:Estakada ponad Bogdanką Poznań.jpg|thumb|Overpasses such as this one allow for traffic to continue for human convenience, while allowing wildlife to pass unharmed beneath from place to place.]]

== Costs ==
Corridors can be expensive to plan out and put into action. For example, Daniel Simberloff et al. states that “a bridge that would maintain a [[Riparian zone|riparian corridor]] costs about 13 times as much per [[lane mile|lane-mile]] as would a road that would sever the corridor.” He also states that maintenance of a corridor would be much more costly than refuges for [[endangered species]]. It would simply be easier to move animals between refuges than to buy land, install a corridor, and maintain it. However, where the goal is not just to preserve a few large animal species but to protect biodiversity among all plants and animals, then habitat corridors may be the only option.  Corridors are going to be expensive to implement no matter what, but it does depend on the type, location, and size, which can all vary to a great degree. With the lack of field data on the effectiveness, many agencies are not willing to consider putting in corridors.

== Monitoring use ==
{{Tone|section|date=March 2008}}
It is extremely important for researchers to pay attention to the population changes in animals after a corridor has been implemented to ensure that there are no harmful effects. Researchers can use both [[Mark and recapture|mark-recapture techniques]] and evaluate [[Gene flow|genetic flow]] in order to observe how much a corridor is being used. Marking and recapturing animals is more useful when keeping a close eye on individual movement (Mech &amp; Hallet 2001). The only problem is that tagging animals and watching them does not tell anyone whether the migrating individuals are successfully mating with other populations in connected areas of land. On the other hand, genetic techniques can be more effective in evaluating migration and mating patterns.

One of the most important goals of developing a corridor is to increase migration in certain animal species. By looking at a population’s [[gene flow]], researchers can understand the genetic consequences of corridors (Mech &amp; Hallett 2001). The migration patterns of an entire population are much more important than the movements of a few individuals. From these techniques, researchers will better understand whether or not habitat corridors are increasing biodiversity.

Stephen Mech and James Hallett introduce an additional reason genetic techniques are more useful; they “measure average migration rates over time, which reveals the effects of fragmentation of several generations and is not as sensitive to current population sizes as mark-recapture studies are.” For example, when a population is extremely small, mark-recapture is almost impossible. Clearly, genetic analysis of a species is the best way to determine if animals are actually using corridors to move and reproduce.

==Design==
According to new research, wildlife corridors are best built with a certain degree of randomness or asymmetry, rather than built symmetrically. The research was conducted at UC Davis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/10/081020135221.htm|title=Designing wildlife corridors|publisher=Sciencedaily.com|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wildlife corridors are susceptible to [[edge effect]]s; habitat quality along the edge of a habitat fragment is often much lower than in core habitat areas. Wildlife corridors are important for large species requiring significant sized [[range (biology)|range]]s; however, they are also vital as connection corridors for smaller animals and plants as well as ecological connectors to provide a ''[[rescue effect]]''.

== Examples ==

Both the safety of animals and humans can be achieved through the creation of corridors. For example, deer commonly cross roads in order to get to other grazing land. When they are faced with a car coming at them, they freeze; this puts both the deer and the human’s life in danger. In [[Alberta|Alberta, Canada]], an overpass was constructed to keep animals off of the busy highway; the area is part of a [[national park]], so many different creatures roam the area. The top of the bridge is covered in the native grass of the area so that it blends in better and animals will not know the difference. Gates were also put of on either side of the overpass to help guide animals in the right direction (Semrad 2007).

In [[Southern California]], 15 underpasses and drainage [[culvert]]s were observed to see how many animals used them as corridors. They proved to be especially effective on wide-ranging species such as carnivores, [[mule deer]], small mammals, and reptiles, even though the corridors were not intended specifically for animals. Researchers also learned that factors such as surrounding habitat, underpass dimensions, and human activity also played a role in how much use they got. From this experiment, much was learned about what would constitute a successful habitat corridor (Dole et al. 2003).

In [[South Carolina]], five remnant areas of land were monitored; one was put in the center and four were surrounding it. Then, a corridor was put between one of the remnants and the center. Butterflies that were placed in the center habitat were two to four times more likely to move to the connected remnant rather than the disconnected ones. Furthermore, male holly plants were placed in the center region, and female holly plants in the connected region increased by 70 percent in seed production compared to those plants in the disconnected region. The most impressive dispersal into the connected region, though, was through bird droppings.  Far more plant seeds were dispersed through bird droppings in the corridor-connected patch of land (M. 2002).

There have also been positive effects on the rates of transfer and interbreeding in [[vole]] populations. A control population in which voles were confined to their core habitat with no corridor was compared to a treatment population in their core habitat with passages that they could use to move to other regions. Females typically stayed and mated within their founder population, but the rate of transfer through corridors in the males was very high. Researchers are not sure why the females did not move about as much, but it is apparent that the corridor effectively transferred at least some of the species to another location for breeding (Aars 1999).

In 2001, a wolf corridor was restored through a golf course in [[Jasper National Park]], [[Alberta]], which enabled [[Gray wolf|wolves]] to pass through the course. After this restoration, wolves passed through the corridor frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Shepherd, B|author2=J. Whittington |date=2006|title=Response of wolves to corridor restoration and human use management|journal=Ecology and Society |volume=11 |issue=2|url=http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol11/iss2/art1/|accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the first demonstrations that corridors are used by wildlife, and can be effective in decreasing fragmentation. Earlier studies had been criticised for failing to demonstrate that corridor restoration leads to a change in wildlife behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Daniel K. Rosenberg|author2=Barry R.

===Elephant corridor===
Elephant corridors are narrow strips of land that allow elephants to move from one habitat patch to another. There are 88 identified elephant corridors in India.

In Africa, [[Botswana]] houses the largest number of free-roaming elephant herds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourafricansafari.com/articles/new-way-to-protect-africas-elephant-herds|title=Elephant corridors in Botswana to protect the herds|author=Fran|website=Your African Safari|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elephants Without Borders (EWB) studies the movement of elephants is working to gain community support of local community corridors, so that elephants and humans can co-exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elephantswithoutborders.org/living_with_elephants.php|title=Elephants Without Borders Living with elephants|publisher=Elephantswithourborders.org|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major wildlife corridors===
Several artificial wildlife corridors have been created, these include:
* the Paséo Pantera (also known as the MesoAmerican Biological corridor or [[Paseo del Jaguar|Paséo del Jaguar]])
* the Eastern Himalayan Corridor
* China-Russia Tiger Corridor
* Tandai Tiger Corridor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panthera.org/programs/tiger/tiger-corridor-initiative|title=Panthera|publisher=Panthera.org|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[European Green Belt]]
* The Siju-Rewak Corridor, located in the Garo Hills of India, protects an important population of elephants(thought to be approximately 20% of all the elephants that survive in the country).This corridor project links together the Siju Wildlife Sanctuary and the Rewak Reserve Forest in Meghalaya State, close to the India-Bangladesh border. This area lies within the meeting place of the Himalayan Mountain Range and the Indian Peninsula and contains at least 139 other species of mammal, including tiger, clouded leopard and the Himalayan black bear.
* the [[Ecologische Hoofdstructuur]] is a network of corridors and habitats created for wildlife in the Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;[[:nl:Ecologische hoofdstructuur|Ecologische Hoofdstructuur]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation ==
Some animal species are much more apt to use habitat corridors than others depending on what their migration and mating patterns are like. For example, many cases of birds and butterflies successfully using corridors have been observed. Less successful stories have come out of mammals such as deer. How effective a corridor is may simply rely on what species it is directed towards (Tewskbury 2002). Corridors created with birds in mind may be more successful because they are highly migratory to begin with.

Human interference is almost inevitable with the quickly increasing population. The goal behind habitat corridors shows the most hope for solving habitat fragmentation and restoring biodiversity as much as possible. Although there are many positives and negatives, there may be enough positives to continue studying and improving corridors. It is truly difficult to say whether corridors are the solution to increasing biodiversity, because each one must be judged on its own.  Each corridor has its own set of standards and goals that may set it apart from another one.

===Negatives===
A major downfall to habitat corridors is that not much information has been gathered about their success. Due to the lack of positive data, many agencies will not allow corridors to be established because they are unsure of their effectiveness. Another problem with corridors is that they are not as useful as simply preserving land so that it cannot be fragmented. However, it is becoming very difficult to set aside land for nature reserves when road-building, industry, and [[urban sprawl]] are all competing for space.

Even if corridors are sought as a solution, it does not necessarily mean that animals will use them. Especially in the case of overpasses, research shows that animals do not like to use them to get to another remnant area of land. Usually overpasses are built over busy highways, and many species are too timid to expose themselves in front of all of the traffic. As more roads and buildings arise, there becomes less space to try to preserve.

Habitat corridors need to be species-specific (not every kind of animal will use every kind of corridor) and corridors can be barriers to some species.  For instance plants may use road verges as corridors however some mammals will not cross roads to reach a suitable habitat.

When a corridor is implemented, many times development is so close by, that it becomes difficult to build a wide enough passage. There is usually a very limited amount of space available for corridors, so buffers are not usually added in (Rosenberg 1997). Without a buffer zone, corridors become susceptible to harmful outside factors from city streets, [[suburb]] development, rural homes, [[forestry]], cropland, and feedlots.

Unfortunately, another limiting factor to the implementation of corridors is money. With such inconclusive data about the effectiveness of connecting land, it is difficult to get the proper funding. Those who would be in charge of the corridor design and construction would ask such questions as, “What if the corridors affect species negatively?” and “What if they actually aid in the spread of disease and catastrophic events?” Furthermore, there is a possibility that corridors could not only aid in the dispersal of native organisms, but invasive ones, as well (Beier &amp; Loe 1998). If [[invasive species]] take over an area they could potentially threaten another species, even to the point of extinction.

Although wildlife corridors have been proposed as solutions to habitat and wildlife population fragmentation, there is little evidence that they are broadly useful as a conservation strategy for all biodiversity in non-developed or less-developed areas, compared to protecting connectivity as the relevant ecological attribute. In other words, corridors may be a useful meme for conservation planning/ers, but the concept has less meaning to wildlife species themselves. Very few wildlife follow easily identified "corridors" or "linkages" (e.g., using [[Computer simulation|computer modeling]]), instead most species meander and opportunistically move through landscapes during daily, seasonal, and dispersal movement behavior. Wildlife corridors may be useful in highly developed landscapes where they are easily identified as the last remaining and available habitat.

===Positives===
Habitat corridors may be defenseless against a number of outside influences, but they are still an efficient way of increasing biodiversity. Strips of land aid in the movement of various animal species and [[pollen]] and [[Biological dispersal|seed dispersal]], which is an added benefit to the intended one (M. 2002). For example, when insects carrying pollen or birds carrying seeds travel to another area, plant species effectively get transported, as well.

Another positive aspect of corridors is that they allow both animals and humans to occupy virtually the same areas of land, and thus co-exist where without the corridor this would not be possible. Large animals such as [[bear]]s can be attracted to residential areas in search of food due to lack of natural resources because of [[habitat fragmentation]]. A corridor would provide a passage for the bears to [[Foraging|forage]] in other locations, so that they would not pose as much of a threat to humans.
