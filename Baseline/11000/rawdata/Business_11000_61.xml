'''Arthur Bryce Courtenay''', [[Member of the Order of Australia|AM]] (14 August 1933{{spaced ndash}}22 November 2012) was a [[South African]]/[[Australian]] advertising director and novelist. He is one of Australia's best-selling authors, notable for his book ''[[The Power of One (novel)|The Power of One]]''.

==Background and early years==

Arthur Bryce Courtenay was born in the Lebombo Mountains, South Africa, the son of Maude Greer and Arthur Ryder.  Ryder was married with six children, and lived with his family, but also maintained a relationship with Greer, with whom he already had a daughter, Rosemary.  Maude Greer gave the surname Courtenay to both her children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/the-man-who-made-christmas-presents-20121123-29xfk.html|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|title=The man who 'made Christmas presents'|date=23 November 2012|first=Patricia|last=Maunder|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227054122/http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/the-man-who-made-christmas-presents-20121123-29xfk.html|archivedate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryce Courtenay spent most of his early years in a small village in the [[Lebombo Mountains]] in the [[Limpopo province]]. He later attended [[King Edward VII School (Johannesburg)|King Edward VII School]].

In 1955, while studying journalism in London, Courtenay met his future wife, Benita Solomon, and they emigrated to Sydney in 1958. They married in 1959 and had three sons&amp;nbsp;– Brett, Adam and Damon.

Courtenay entered the advertising industry and, over a career spanning 34 years, was the Creative Director of [[McCann Erickson]], [[J. Walter Thompson]] and [[George Patterson Y&amp;R|George Patterson Advertising]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saxton.com.au/default.asp?sd8=325|title=Bryce Courtenay AM|work=Speaker details|publisher=Saxton Speakers' Bureau|archivedate=4 December 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204124816/http://www.saxton.com.au/default.asp?sd8=325}}&lt;/ref&gt; His award-winning campaigns included ''[[Louie the Fly]]'' and the original ''[[Milkybar]] Kid'' commercial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/bryce-courtenay-dies-in-canberra-aged-79/story-e6frg8n6-1226522635053|title=Bryce Courtenay dies in Canberra aged 79|first=Stephen|last=Romei|date=23 November 2013|newspaper=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with [[Geoffry Morgan Pike|Geoff Pike]], Bryce Courtenay developed the concept behind the [[Yowie (chocolate)|Cadbury Yowie]], a chocolate that contained a children's toy, typically an Australian or New Zealand native animal.

On 1 April 1991, Damon (who was born with the blood condition [[haemophilia]]) died at age 24 from [[AIDS-related complications]], contracted through a blood transfusion.

Courtenay divorced Benita in 2000 and acknowledged sexual relationships with other women during their 42-year marriage. Benita Courtenay died on 11 March 2007, at the age of 72, four months after being diagnosed with acute [[myeloid leukaemia]].&lt;ref name="Benita's death"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/people/sad-serenade-for-courtenay/2007/03/11/1173548008005.html|title=Sad Serenade for Courtenay|last=Sharp|first=Annette|date=12 March 2007|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130013455/http://www.smh.com.au/news/people/sad-serenade-for-courtenay/2007/03/11/1173548008005.html|archivedate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later lived in [[Canberra]] with his second wife, Christine Gee.

==Writing==
His novels are primarily set in Australia, his adopted country, or South Africa, the country of his birth. His first book, [[The Power of One (novel)|The Power of One]], was published in 1989 and, despite Courtenay's fears that it would never sell, quickly became one of Australia's best-selling books by any living author. The story was made into a [[The Power of One (film)|film]], as well as being re-released in an edition for children.

Courtenay was one of Australia's most commercially successful authors. He built up this success over the long term by promoting himself and developing a relationship with readers as much as marketing his books; for instance, he gave away up to 2,500 books free each year to readers he met in the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Byrne|first=Jennifer|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/firsttuesday/s2871243.htm|title=Blockbusters And Bestsellers|work=[[First Tuesday Book Club]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111214538/http://www.abc.net.au/tv/firsttuesday/s2871243.htm|archivedate=11 November 2012|date=11 May 2012|authorlink=Jennifer Byrne}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only ''The Power of One'' has been published in the United States. Courtenay claimed that this was because "American publishers for the most part have difficulties about Australia, they are interested in books in their own country first and foremost. However, we receive many e-mails and letters from Americans who have read my books and I am hoping in the future that publishers will recognize that there is a market for all my books in the U.S."&lt;ref name=EBA&gt;{{citation|url=http://ebookauthor.com.au/index.php/australian-author/Fiction-eBooks/bryce-courtenay-australian-author|title=Bryce Courtenay|publisher=eBooks International|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501175854/http://ebookauthor.com.au/index.php/australian-author/Fiction-eBooks/bryce-courtenay-australian-author|archivedate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
In September 2012, Courtenay announced that he was suffering from terminal [[gastric cancer]] and that his last book would be ''[[Jack of Diamonds (novel)|Jack of Diamonds]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/months-to-live-bryce-courtenay-reveals-terminal-cancer-20120907-25jtn.html|title='Months to live': Bryce Courtenay reveals terminal cancer|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=7 September 2012|archivedate=5 October 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005083302/http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/months-to-live-bryce-courtenay-reveals-terminal-cancer-20120907-25jtn.html|first=Craig|last=Butt}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 22 November at his Canberra home.&lt;ref name=abcnews&gt;{{cite news|title=Power of One author Bryce Courtenay dead at 79|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-11-23/bryce-courtenay-dead-at-79/4388010|publisher=ABC News|date=23 November 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909165340/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-11-23/bryce-courtenay-dead-at-79/4388010|archivedate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=22 November 2012|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20457516|title=Australian author Bryce Courtenay dies|archivedate=27 November 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127040710/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20457516|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=10849494|title= Bryce Courtenay has died, aged 79|date=23 November 2012|accessdate=27 December 2013|newspaper=The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/bryce-courtenay-writes-his-final-chapter-20121123-29xes.html |title=Bryce Courtenay writes his final chapter |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |first1=Jason|last1= Steger |first2=Steve|last2=Dow |date=23 November 2012|archivedate=8 March 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308230106/http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/bryce-courtenay-writes-his-final-chapter-20121123-29xes.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CDT''' is an Australian digital television station broadcasting in remote central and eastern Australia. It is jointly owned by [[Southern Cross Austereo]] (owner of [[QQQ|Southern Cross Central]]) and [[Imparja Television|Imparja Television Pty Ltd]] (owner of [[Imparja Television]]) and operates under the company name ''Central Digital Television''.&lt;ref name="LicenceAlloc"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The station is available via satellite and terrestrial platforms&lt;ref name="VAST-East"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.digitalready.gov.au/getattachment/81e1f2ff-ea8a-4571-a8d1-47e1e6033d37/Viewer-Access-Satellite-Television-service-for-cen

| date = March 2013
| publisher = digitalready.gov.au
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[free-to-air]] on a number of digital terrestrial transmitters, in remote areas of Australia.

The station is similar to other joint venture services already available in [[TDT (TV station)|Tasmania]], [[MDV (TV station)|Mildura]], [[DTD (TV station)|Darwin]] and [[West Digital Television|Western Australia]]. Officially, the service's call sign is CDT in the Remote Central and Eastern Australia TV2 licence areas, and '''IDQ''' in the [[Mount Isa]] TV1 licence area (reflecting the status of existing [[Southern Cross Television]] station [[QQQ|ITQ]]).

== History ==
Central Digital Television began broadcasting ''10 Central'', ''[[10 Boss]]'' and ''[[10 Peach|10 Peach]]'' as digital satellite channels on 30 June 2010, the same day as the Viewer Access Satellite Television service was partially launched. [[QQQ|Southern Cross Central]] and Imparja Television also commenced broadcasting digital satellite channels on the same day. The launch of the commercial digital channels coincided with the first analog television transmitter switch off in [[Mildura, Victoria]]. This was so viewers in the area who lost adequate television coverage were able to utilise VAST as an alternative source.&lt;ref name="DBCDEAnnualReport"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.archive.dbcde.gov.au/2012/october/annual_report_2010-11/section_2_-_performance_review/program_1.3_broadcasting_and_digital_television
| title = Annual Report 2010/2011: Broadcasting and Digital Television
| accessdate = 23 November 2013
| date = October 2012
| work = Department of Communications (previously DBCDE)
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 December 2010, VAST officially launched and began granting access to viewers in the Remote Central and Eastern Australia licence areas. This brought digital television to satellite viewers in the Northern Territory, Queensland and South Australia for the first time.&lt;ref name="DBCDEAnnualReport" /&gt; Digital terrestrial transmissions began in [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory]] and Mount Isa, Queensland on 2 May 2011,&lt;ref name="TerrLaunch1"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.acma.gov.au/theACMA/acma-media-release-382011-29-april-commercial-digital-television-services-switch-on-in-alice-springs-and-mt-isa-on-2-may
| title = Commercial digital television services switch on in Alice Springs and Mt Isa on 2 May
| accessdate = 23 November 2013
| date = 29 April 2011
| work = Australian Communications and Media Authority
}}&lt;/ref&gt; with other areas launching between 2012 and 2013.

== Programming ==
CDT is affiliated to Network Ten, but sources programming from two stations. ''Ten Central North'' is based on [[TVQ]] [[Brisbane]], and airs ''[[Ten News First]] Brisbane'' nightly at 5pm, as well as sports and events live in the Brisbane market. ''10 Central South'', 10 Peach and ''10 Boss'' are based on [[TEN (TV station)|TEN]] [[Sydney]], including news and sports such as ''[[Ten News First]] Sydney''. Both ''Ten Central'' channels also air programming produced by [[Southern Cross Austereo]]. ''10 Peach'' is the same as it is in every region.

==Availability==

=== Terrestrial ===
Central Digital Television broadcasts [[free-to-air]] digital television channels ''10 Central'', ''10 Peach'' and ''10 Boss'' via terrestrial transmissions in many regional cities and towns. The service is licensed to broadcast within the Remote Central and Eastern Australia TV2 and Mt Isa TV1 licence areas,&lt;ref name="LicenceRCEA"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Satellite ===
A digital satellite transmission of CDT's channels is available [[free-to-view]] on the VAST service in all states and territories of Australia, except Western Australia. ''10 Boss'' is broadcast as a single [[high-definition television|high definition]] channel to all viewers, while ''10 Central'' and ''10 Peach'' are each split into two separate [[standard definition]] channels.&lt;ref name="VAST-East" /&gt; ''Ten Central North'' and ''Eleven North'' are broadcast in Australian Eastern Standard Time for viewers in [[Northern Territory]] and [[Queensland]] (Northern Australia TV3 licence area), and ''10 Central South'' and ''10 Peach'' in Australian Eastern Summer Time for viewers in [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]] and [[Norfolk Island]] (South Eastern Australia TV3 licence area).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1720">The '''California Consumers Legal Remedies Act''' ("CLRA") is the name for [[California Civil Code]] §§ 1750 et seq.&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Civ. Code § 1750&lt;/ref&gt;  The CLRA declare unlawful several "methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices undertaken by any person in a transaction intended to result or which results in the sale or lease of goods or services to any [[consumer]]".&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Civ. Code § 1770&lt;/ref&gt;  Forbidden practices include misrepresenting the source of the good and services, representing reconditioned goods as new, advertising goods without having the expected demand in stock, representing a repair is needed when it is not, representing rebates that have hidden conditions, and misrepresenting the authority of a salesman to close a deal.  

The CLRA claim is attractive to potential [[plaintiff]]s because Cal. Civ. Code § 1780 allows consumers who suffer damage as a result of a practice declared unlawful by § 1770 to obtain actual [[damages]] (the total award of damages in a [[class action]] shall be more than $1,000); an order enjoining the methods, acts, or practices; restitution of property; [[punitive damages]]; court costs and attorney's fees; and any other relief that the court deems proper. A prevailing plaintiff gets to recover his attorney's fees, but a prevailing defendant usually may not recover his attorney's fees.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Code § 1780(e) only awards the defendant attorney's fees if the action was not in good faith.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=October 2012}}
'''Career counseling''' and '''career guidance''' are similar in nature to other types of [[counseling]] (e.g. marriage or clinical counseling). What unites all types of professional counseling is the role of practitioners, who combine giving advice on their topic of expertise with counseling techniques that support clients in making complex decisions and facing difficult situations. The focus of career counseling is generally on issues such as [[career]] exploration, career change, personal [[career development]] and other career related issues. 

There is no agreed definition of career counseling worldwide, mainly due to conceptual, cultural and linguistic differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Van Esbroeck, R.  |author2=Athanansou, J.|title=International Handbook of Career Guidance|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-6229-2|pages=1–19|editor=Athanasou, J. &amp; R. Van Esbroeck|chapter=1. Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; This even affects the most central term ''counseling'' (or: ''counselling'' in British English) which is often substituted with the word ''guidance'' as in ''career guidance''. For example, in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], ''career counseling'' would usually be referred to as ''careers advice'' or ''guidance''. Due to the widespread reference to both ''career guidance'' and ''career counseling'' among policy-makers, academics and practitioners around the world, references to ''career guidance and counselling'' are becoming common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiersmann, C., Ertelt, B.-J., Katsarov, J., Mulvey, R., Reid, H, &amp; Weber, P. (eds.)|title=NICE Handbook for the Academic Training of Career Guidance and Counselling Professionals|year=2012|publisher=Heidelberg University, Institute of Educational Science|location=Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-944230-03-0|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Related professional activities ==
Career counseling or career guidance includes a wide variety of professional activities which help people deal with career-related challenges. Career counselors work with [[Adolescence|adolescents]] seeking to explore career options, experienced professionals contemplating a career change, parents who want to return to the world of work after taking time to raise their child, or people seeking employment. Career counselling is also offered in various settings, including in groups and individually, in person or by means of digital communication.

Several approaches have been undertaken to systemize the variety of professional activities related to career guidance and counseling. In the most recent attempt, the Network for Innovation in Career Guidance and Counselling in Europe (NICE) – a consortium of 45 European institutions of higher education in the field of career counseling – has agreed on a system of professional roles for guidance counselors. Each of these five roles is seen as an important facet of the ''career guidance and counselling profession''. Career counselors performing in any of these roles are expected to behave professionally, e.g. by following ethical standards in their practice. The NICE Professional Roles (NPR) are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiersmann, C., Ertelt, B.-J., Katsarov, J., Mulvey, R., Reid, H, &amp; Weber, P. (eds.)|title=NICE Handbook for the Academic Training of Career Guidance and Counselling Professionals|year=2012|publisher=Heidelberg University, Institute of Educational Science|location=Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-944230-03-0|pages=41–60|chapter=Core Competences for Career Guidance and Counselling Professionals}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The ''Career Educator'' "supports people in developing their own career management competences"
* The ''Career Information &amp; Assessment Expert'' "supports people in assessing their personal characteristics and needs, then connecting them with the labour market and education systems"
* The ''Career Counsellor'' "supports individuals in understanding their situations, so as to work through issues towards solutions"
* The ''Programme &amp; Service Manager'' "ensures the quality and delivery of career guidance and counselling organisations' services"
* The ''Social Systems Intervener &amp; Developer'' "supports clients (even) in crisis and works to change systems for the better"

The description of the NICE Professional Roles (NPR) draws on a variety of prior models to define the central activities and competences of guidance counselors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Katsarov, J. |author2=Dörr, E. |author3=Weber, P. |title=NICE Handbook for the Academic Training of Career Guidance and Counselling Professionals|year=2012|publisher=Heidelberg University, Institute of Educational Science|location=Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-944230-03-0|pages=231–238|editor1=Schiersmann, C. |editor2=Ertelt, B.-J. |editor3=Katsarov, J. |editor4=Mulvey, R. |editor5=Reid, H |editor6=Weber, P. |chapter=The NICE Core Competences in Comparison with other National and International Competence Frameworks}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NPR can, therefore, be understood as a state-of-the-art framework which includes all relevant aspects of career counselling. For this reason, other models haven't been included here so far. Models which are reflected in the NPR include:

== Benefits ==
Empirical research&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whiston|first=Susan C.|last2=Li|first2=Yue|last3=Mitts|first3=Nancy Goodrich|last4=Wright|first4=Lauren|title=Effectiveness of career choice interventions: A meta-analytic replication and extension|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0001879117300283|journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior|volume=100|pages=175–184|doi=10.1016/j.jvb.2017.03.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; attests the effectiveness of career counseling. Professional career counselors can support people with career-related challenges. Through their expertise in career development and labor markets, they can put a person's qualifications, experience, strengths and weakness in a broad perspective while also considering their desired salary, personal hobbies and interests, location, job market and educational possibilities. Through their counseling and teaching abilities, career counselors can additionally support people in gaining a better understanding of what really matters for them personally, how they can plan their careers autonomously, or help them in making tough decisions and getting through times of crisis. Finally, career counselors are often capable of supporting their clients in finding suitable placements/ jobs, in working out conflicts with their employers, or finding the support of other helpful services. It is due to these various benefits of career counseling that policy makers in many countries publicly fund guidance services. For example, the European Union understands career guidance and counseling as an instrument to effectively combat [[social exclusion]] and increase citizens' employability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Council of the European Union|title=Council Resolution on Better Integrating Lifelong Guidance into Lifelong Learning Strategies.|date=October 31, 2008|issue=Resolution No. 14398/08 EDUC 241 SOC 607}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History and New Approaches ==
Frank Parson's ''Choosing a Vocation'' (1909) was perhaps the first major work which is concerned with careers guidance.

While until the 1970s a strongly normative approach was characteristic for theories (e.g. of Donald E. Super's ''life-span approach''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.grinnell.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Super.pdf |title=Donald Super’s LIFE-SPAN, LIFE-SPACE APPROACH |publisher=[[Grinnell College]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and practice of career counseling (e.g. concept of ''matching''), new models have their starting point in the individual needs and transferable skills of the clients while managing biographical breaks and discontinuities. Career development is no longer viewed as a linear process which reflects a predictable world of work. More consideration is now placed on nonlinear, chance and unplanned influences&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The chaos theory of careers: A new perspective on working in the twenty-first century.|last=Pryor, R. G. L., &amp; Bright, J. E.|first=|publisher=New York, NY: Routledge.|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

This change of perspective is evident in the constructivist&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Career counselling: Constructivist approaches (2nd ed.).|last=McMahon, M.|first=|publisher=Routledge.|year=2017|isbn=|location=Abingdon, UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and social constructionist paradigms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social constructionism in vocational psychology and career development|last=McIlveen, P., &amp; Schultheiss, D. E. (Eds.).|first=|publisher=Sense|year=2012|isbn=|location=Rotterdam, The Netherlands|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for career counselling. The constructivist/social constructionist paradigms are applied as narrative career counseling&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mcilveen|first=P.|last2=Patton|first2=W.|date=2007-09-01|title=Narrative career counselling: Theory and exemplars of practice|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1080/00050060701405592/abstract|journal=Australian Psychologist|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=226–235|doi=10.1080/00050060701405592|issn=1742-9544|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Career counseling: A narrative approach.|last=Cochran, L.|first=|publisher=Sage Publications|year=1997|isbn=|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that emphasizes personal stories and the meaning individuals generate in relation to their education and work.

Postmodern career counselling is a reflective process of assisting clients in creating self through writing and revising biographical [[narrative]]s taking place in a context of multiple choice from a diversity of options and constraints.  The shift moves from emphasizing career choice to empowering [[self-affirmation]] and improving [[decision making]].&lt;ref&gt;Peavy, R. V. (1996).  Constructivist career counselling and assessment.  Guidance &amp; Counselling, 11(3), 8-14.&lt;/ref&gt;
Recently this approach is widely applied in [[Australia]] such as in [https://web.archive.org/web/20110423085501/http://www.ausport.gov.au/participating/career_and_education Athlete Career and Education (ACE) program] by [[Australian Sports Commission]] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20110221225305/http://www.scopeforartists.com.au/Home Scope for artists] by [[Ausdance]].

== Training ==
There is no international standard qualification for professional career counselors, although various certificates are offered nationally and internationally (e.g. by professional associations). The number of degree programs in career guidance and/or career counseling is growing worldwide. The title "career counselor" is unregulated, unlike [[engineers]] or [[psychologist]]s whose professional titles are legally protected. At the same time, policy makers agree that the competence of career counselors is one of the most important factors in ensuring that people receive high quality support in dealing with their career questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=ELGPN|title=European Lifelong Guidance Policies: Progress Report 2011-12|year=2012|publisher=University of Jyväskylä|location=Jyväskylä}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the country of their education, career counselors may have a variety of academic backgrounds: In Europe, for instance, degrees in (vocational/ industrial/ organization) psychology and educational sciences are among the most common, but backgrounds in sociology, public administration and other sciences are also frequent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ertelt, B.-J., Weber, P. &amp; Katsarov, J|title=NICE Handbook for the Academic Training of Career Guidance and Counselling Professionals|year=2012|publisher=Heidelberg University, Institute of Educational Science|location=Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-944230-03-0|pages=83–104|editor1=Schiersmann, C. |editor2=Ertelt, B.-J. |editor3=Katsarov, J. |editor4=Mulvey, R. |editor5=Reid, H |editor6=Weber, P |chapter=6. Existing Degree Programmes in Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, many training programs for career counselors are becoming increasingly multidisciplinary.

== Professional career guidance centers ==
There are many career guidance and counseling centers all over the world. They give services of guidance and counseling on higher studies, possibilities, chances and nature of courses and institutes. There are many such service providers all over the world providing online counseling to people about their career or conducting a psychometric test to know the person's aptitude as well as interests.

== Career Assessment ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
Assessment tools used in career counseling to help clients make realistic career decisions.  These tools generally fall into three categories:  interest inventories, personality inventories, and aptitude tests.

Interest inventories are usually based on the premise that if you have similar interests to people in an occupation who like their job, you will probably like that occupation also.  Thus, interest inventories may suggest occupations that the client has not thought of and which have a good chance of being something that the client will be happy with. The most common interest inventory is a measure of vocational interests across six domains: Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making vocational choices: A theory of vocational personalities and work environments (3rd ed.)|last=Holland|first=J. L.|publisher=Psychological Assessment Resources.|year=1997|isbn=|location=Odessa, FL|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. People often report a mixture of these domains, usually with one predominant domain.

Aptitude tests can predict with good odds whether a particular person will be able to be successful in a particular occupation.  For example, a student who wants to be a physicist is unlikely to succeed if he cannot do the math.  An aptitude test will tell him if he is likely to do well in advanced math, which is necessary for physics.  There are also aptitude tests which can predict success or failure in many different occupations.

Personality inventories are sometimes used to help people with career choice.  The use of these inventories for this purpose is questionable, because in any occupation there are people with many different personalities.  A popular personality inventory is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator.  It is based on Carl Jung’s theory of personality, but Jung never approved it.  According to Jung most people fall in the middle of each scale, but the MBTI ignores this and puts everyone in a type category.  For example, according to the MBTI, everyone is either an extrovert or an introvert.  According to Jung, most people are somewhere in between, and people at the extremes are rare.  The validity of the MBTI for career choice is highly questionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cult of Personality|last=Paul|first=Annie Murphy|publisher=Free Press (Simon &amp; Schuster)|year=2004|isbn=0-7432-4356-0|location=New York|pages=118–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==
One of the major challenges associated with career counseling is encouraging participants to engage in the process. For example, in the UK 70% of people under 14 say they have had no careers advice while 45% of people over 14 have had no or very poor/limited advice.

In a related issue some client groups tend to reject the interventions made by professional career counselors preferring to rely on the advice of peers or superiors within their own profession. Jackson et al. found that 44% of doctors in training felt that senior members of their own profession were best placed to give careers advice.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson et al, Informing choices: the need for career advice in medical training&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it is recognised that the giving of career advice is something that is widely spread through a range of formal and informal roles. In addition to career counselors it is also common for [[psychologist]]s, teachers, managers, trainers and [[Human resources|Human Resources]] (HR) specialists to give formal support in career choices. Similarly it is also common for people to seek informal support from friends and family around their career choices and to bypass career professionals altogether. Today increasingly people rely on career web portals to seek advice on resume writing and handling interviews; as also to research on various professions and companies. It has even become possible to take vocational assessments online.

== Career Counseling in the United States ==

In the United States, the designation, "career counselor" is not legally protected; that is, anyone can call themselves a career counselor. However, [http://www.cacrep.org/for-programs/2016-cacrep-standards/ CACREP, the accrediting body for counselor education programs] requires that these programmes include one course in career counseling as a part of the coursework for a masters in counseling.

The National Career Development Association (NCDA), the credentialing body for career counselors, provides various certifications for qualified career counselors. For those university-trained counselors or psychologists who have devoted a certain number of years to career counseling and taken specific coursework, it offers a [http://ncda.org/aws/NCDA/pt/sd/news_article/4628/_PARENT/layout_details_cc/false Master Career Counselor (MCC) credential]. The National Career Development Association is the only professional association of career counselors in the United States that provides certification in career counseling.

== Career Counselling in Australia ==
In Australia, career counselling may be provided by professionals from various disciplines (e.g., psychology, education, guidance, and counselling).  The Professional Standards for Australian Career Development Practitioners&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cica.org.au/professional-standards/|title=Professional Standards for Australian Career Development Practitioners|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide guidelines about appropriate qualifications and competencies for career counselling. There are a range of postgraduate degrees (e.g., Master, Doctor) that are endorsed for career development practice according to the Professional Standards. The Career Industry Council of Australia (CICA) endorses career development programs in [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://careercentre.dtwd.wa.gov.au/occupations/Pages/careers-counsellor.aspx|title=Careers counsellor|website=careercentre.dtwd.wa.gov.au|access-date=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are other relevant qualifications but these may necessarily not be endorsed under the provisions of the Professional Standards by CICA. A Diploma of Counselling and a Certificate IV in Career Development are offered at TAFE colleges and other registered training organisations throughout Australia.

The '''counting method''' ('''CM'''), also known as '''Ochberg's counting method''', is a therapeutic treatment designed to help with the desensitization of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countingmethod.com/ The Counting Method official website]&lt;/ref&gt;  The method was designed by psychiatrist [[Frank Ochberg]] in the early 1990s.  Ochberg, who'd previously helped to define and characterize posttraumatic stress disorder, began using the CM in his private practice as a means of combating PTSD symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countingmethod.com/ The Counting Method official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The method==

During the CM, the clinician asks the PTSD client to recall a traumatic memory while the clinician counts out loud to 100.  After the counting the client is asked to discuss their memory.  Subsequently, clinician and client work to reframe that traumatic memory and minimize or eliminate the discomfort associated with it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giftfromwithin.org/html/counting.html "The Counting Method for Ameliorating Traumatic Memories". [[Frank Ochberg]]. Journal of Traumatic Stress, Vol.9 No.4 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Progressive counting (PC)]]

==Results==

A recent study sought to compare the CM to other existing forms of PTSD treatment.  The study divided 38 women among three forms of PTSD therapy, including the CM.  All three treatments worked very well in minimizing PTSD symptoms; additionally, the study showed that the CM may be as effective as other pre-established techniques in the treatment of PTSD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countingmethod.com/images/The_Counting_Method_as_Exposure_Therapy.pdf "The Counting Method as Exposure Therapy: Revisions and Case Examples".

[[Vice admiral]] '''Cristóbal Colón de Carvajal y Gorosábel, 18th Duke of Veragua, 17th Duke of la Vega, 19th Marquess of Aguilafuente, 16th Marquess of Jamaica''', [[Grandee|GE]], [[Order of Isabella the Catholic|OIC]] (October 4, 1949 - ) is a Spanish nobleman, businessman and formerly an officer, helicopter pilot, and commander of a naval vessel in the [[Spanish Navy]]. He is a direct descendant of [[Christopher Columbus]] by way of Christopher's son, [[Diego Columbus|Diego]]. From Diego, Colón de Carvajal also holds the [[Duchy of Veragua]] since 1986. As the Duchy corresponds to the present-day [[Veraguas Province]] of the independent republic of [[Panama]], Colón de Carvajal maintains close connections with Panamanian society, and serves on the advisory board of Petaquilla Minerals, a mining company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.petaquilla.com/newsrelease.aspx?petaquilla=Don%20Cristobal%20Colon%20de%20Carvajal%20Joins%20Advisory%20Board%20of%20Petaquilla%20Minerals%20Ltd|title = Don Cristobal Colon de Carvajal Joins Advisory Board of Petaquilla Minerals Ltd.|date = May 10, 2012|publisher = Petaquilla Minerals Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Colón inherited from his father the [[Cristóbal Colón de Carvajal, 17th Duke of Veragua|17th Duke of Veragua]] all of his titles after he was murdered by [[Basque people|Basque]] nationalist terrorist group [[Euskadi Ta Askatasuna|ETA]].

In 2011, his additional title as [[Duchy of Vega|Duke of Vega]] was among many to be spun away to different recipients, with the new Duke of Vega being Colón's son, [[Ángel Santiago Colón de Mandalúniz]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://titulosnobleza.blogspot.com/2011/04/nuevas-concesiones-de-titulos.html Nuevas Concesiones de Títulos Nobiliarios], [[Blog]] ''Títulos Nobiliarios''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2011/04/20/pdfs/BOE-A-2011-7102.pdf Real Carta de Sucesión]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, to commemorate the 500th anniversary of Columbus' landing on [[Hispaniola]], Colón de Carvajal was co-designated [[Grand Marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade|Grand Marshal]] of the [[Tournament of Roses Parade]], alongside US Congressman [[Ben Nighthorse Campbell]].

'''Downtown Baltimore''' is the [[central business district]] of [[Baltimore]] traditionally bounded by [[Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard (Baltimore)|Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard]] to the west, [[Mt. Royal Avenue]] to the north, [[President Street (Baltimore)|President Street]] to the east and the [[Inner Harbor]] area to the south.  It consists of five neighborhoods: Westside, Mount Vernon, City Centre, Inner Harbor, and Camden Yards.

In 1904, downtown Baltimore was almost destroyed by a [[Great Baltimore Fire|huge fire]] with damages estimated at $150 million. Since the City of Baltimore was chartered in 1796, this downtown nucleus has been the focal point of business in the [[Baltimore metropolitan area]].  It has also increasingly become a heavily populated neighborhood with over 37,000 residents and new condominiums and apartment homes being built steadily.

==Geography==
City Center is the historic financial district in Baltimore that has increasingly shifted eastward and into the Inner Harbor.  Hundreds of businesses are found here, and it remains the center of life in Baltimore.  The area is home to the majority of Baltimore's [[skyscraper]]s including the [[Bank of America Building (Baltimore)|Bank of America building]], the [[M&amp;T Bank Building]], the [[Transamerica Tower]], the [[Baltimore World Trade Center]], the [[100 East Pratt Street|old IBM building]], and the massive [[Charles Center]] district. It includes historic [[Maryland Route 139|Charles Street]] as well as significant avenues of commercial and cultural activity along [[Pratt Street]], east to west, and [[St. Paul Street-Calvert Street]], north to south.

The [[Inner Harbor]] is the chief commercial and tourist destination in Baltimore, {{Citation needed span|visited by over 13 million people a year.|date=April 2007}} The Inner Harbor features a large number of restaurants, hotels, retail areas (such as [[Harborplace]]), and entertainment (such as [[Power Plant Live!]]). It was named by ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' as one of the best summer trips in 2012 (along with all of Baltimore in general). The Inner Harbor is also home to a variety of museums and scientific institutions such as the [[Maryland Science Center]], the [[National Aquarium in Baltimore]], the [[Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History &amp; Culture]], the [[Flag House &amp; Star-Spangled Banner Museum]], [[Port Discovery (museum)|Port Discovery children's museum]], and Living Classroom environmental education centers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/best-trips-summer-2012/#/baltimore-maryland-summer-trips_52791_600x450.jpg Best Summer Trips 2012 - National Geographic]. Travel.nationalgeographic.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Like much of Baltimore, the area features historic, often industrial, buildings from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that have been repurposed for modern industry and residences, including the [[Pratt Street Power Plant]] which was built in 1900 and now hosts a [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] bookstore, the Baltimore [[Hard Rock Cafe]], and other retail tenants.

[[File:DowntownPartnership.jpg|thumb|left|Charles Street headquarters of the Partnership for Downtown Baltimore]]
Westside Baltimore is the western portion of downtown Baltimore that includes Market Center and many of the newest developments in downtown Baltimore, including the [[Baltimore Convention Center]]. It is also home to the site of the "Superblock" project that will include hundreds of condos and apartments as well as a variety of retail and commercial space.  The former home of Baltimore's many and famed department stores, Westside Baltimore is now anchored by the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore]] consisting of the University of Maryland Health System, [[University of Maryland School of Law]] and the University of Maryland Biopark. The Westside is also home to several performing arts centers, including the [[Hippodrome Theatre (Baltimore)|Hippodrome Theatre]], [[Royal Farms Arena]], and the [[Everyman Theatre, Baltimore|Everyman Theatre]]. [[G. Krug &amp; Son Ironworks and Museum]], in its original location, is the oldest continually operating blacksmith shop in the United States as well as a museum.

The former home of famed American writer [[Edgar Allan Poe]] is located at the [[Edgar Allan Poe House and Museum]], a few blocks northwest from his grave at the intersection of Greene and Fayette streets. Nearby is the historic [[Lexington Market]], one of the longest-running markets in the world, having been founded in 1782 and in continual operation since, selling a variety of prepared foods and groceries.

[[Mount Vernon, Baltimore|Mount Vernon]], also known as the cultural district, is a high-density area known for its attractive [[nightlife (activity)|nightlife]], buoyed by its large amount of bars, clubs and lounges and its historic multi-story townhomes (most of which have been transformed into apartments) and traditional apartment buildings. Mount Vernon features the [[Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall]], home of the [[Baltimore Symphony Orchestra]], as well as the [[Lyric Opera House]]. The world-renowned [[Peabody Institute]] is also located in Mount Vernon adjacent to the [[Walters Art Museum]]. To the very north is [[Pennsylvania Station (Baltimore)|Penn Station]], which offers [[Amtrak]] service to several U.S. major cities as well as [[MARC Train|MARC]] service to [[Washington, D.C.]] A major north-south avenue in Mount Vernon is Cathedral Street, named for the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary (Baltimore)|National Shrine of the Assumption]], the first Catholic cathedral built in the United States, which is also considered the masterpiece of [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]], the "father of American architecture" and famed creator of the [[U.S. Capitol]].

Downtown Baltimore also contains Camden Yards, which includes the well-known home of the [[Baltimore Orioles]], [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]], and [[M&amp;T Bank Stadium]], home of the [[Baltimore Ravens]]. Nearby are the [[Sports Legends Museum at Camden Yards]], the now-closed [[Geppi's Entertainment Museum]], and the [[Babe Ruth#Memorial and museum|Babe Ruth Birthplace Museum]].

==Transportation==
Downtown Baltimore offers many options for transportation, including subway, light rail, bus service, [[Amtrak]], [[MARC Train]] service through Penn Station and Camden Station as well as access to [[Interstate 83|I-83]], [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|I-695]], [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|I-95]], 295, and [[Interstate 395 (Maryland)|395]].

[[File:Financial Masters.jpg|none|thumb|280px|Ntalami (seated first from right) at a retreat with leading stock exchange and capital markets officials. Windsor Golf and Country Club, [[Nairobi, Kenya]].]]

In 1970 he became an [[audit]] trainee with the City Council of [[Nairobi]] for two years. He later joined [[Magadi Soda Company]] (MSC) Limited, a mineral mining company, serving as an Assistant Accountant. After two years at the company, Ntalami joined international audit firm [[Ernst and Young]]. He served as a senior audit assistant, then transferred to Housing Finance Company of Kenya (HFCK) Limited, a local real estate financier, as Senior Accountant for three years.

Ntalami later served as Chief Accountant, and later, Ag. CEO, for [[Kenya Airways]] for four years.

The early 1980s, which was billed as the golden moment for local indigenous accounting firms,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bdafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3492&amp;Itemid=5813] {{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ntalami became a [[Partner (business rank)|partner]] at Kimani Onyancha &amp; Company, a medium size firm of Certified Public Accountants involved primarily in the provision of statutory audits. He held special responsibility for the management consultancy services (MCS).

After ten years with KO&amp; Co., he became a stockbroker in 1995. He served as Executive Director for Sterling Securities Limited (SSL), a then fledgling [[brokerage firm|stock broking firm]].

Here, Ntalami participated in a number of private and public share issues and flotation, including [[initial public offerings]] (IPOs), [[divestiture]], and [[privatisation]] of public enterprises. At its peak in 1996, SSL was retained by [[Kenya Commercial Bank]] (KCB) as a sponsoring broker during its third share issue.

By 1998 the Sterling Securities Limited partnership was dissolved and, on 11 August 1999, SSL was suspended from trading on the NSE,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationaudio.com/News/DailyNation/130899/News/News34.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 December 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092830/http://www.nationaudio.com/News/DailyNation/130899/News/News34.html |archive-date=29 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but later resumed its operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbendi.co.za/orgs/ccjw.htm|title=Africa Business Newsletter - Best Business Informations|website=Africa Business Newsletter|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the unexpected restructuring of the stockbroking business, Ntalami left to open and operate a Financial and Investment consultancy firm, Marited Associates. After two years, in December 2002 he was appointed Chief Executive of the Capital Markets Authority by the President replacing Paul. K. Melly, following a major cabinet and [[Civil Service|public service]] reshuffle.

===Capital Markets Authority (CMA)===

A new chairman, [[Chege Waruinge]], the [[Vice-Chancellor]] of Gretsa University and Dean Professor Academic Affairs, United States International University (USIU), was also appointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mashada.com/forums/politics/4415-kibaki-makes-changes-30-parastatals.html|title=Chyulu News - Breaking News from Africa|website=Mashada.com|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 January 2009 Waruinge, tendered his resignation to the regulator's board.

Ntalami completed his term in office on 17 December 2007, and did not renew his contract. His departure was immediately followed by the exit of [[Christine Mweti]], the Head of Legal Services who was second in command at CMA, who since moved to [[Renaissance Capital (Russian company)|Renaissance Capital]]. [[Stella Kilonzo]], was appointed the CMA acting chief executive, and confirmed as CEO on 15 July 2008

====Highlights of tenure====
[[File:CMA-Kenya.jpg|thumb|right|110px|CMA logo]]
Some of the key events that have characterised the Chief Executive's tenure include:
* '''Kenya Re initial public offering:'''

The Government sold 40 per cent of its stake in the 37-year-old [[reinsurance]] firm, or 240 million shares, through an [[initial public offering]] (IPO) at the [[Nairobi Stock Exchange]] (NSE). The IPO opened on 18 July 2007, and closed on 31 July 2007. The IPO was oversubscribed by an average of 363.5 per cent with the retail segment, recording the highest oversubscription of 715 per cent. For the first time ever, the transaction team implemented the [[delivery versus payment]] (DVP) method, which allowed institutional investors and insurance firms to hold off payment until the share allocation was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200708061780.html|title=Kenya Re IPO Oversubscribed By 334 Percent|first=Michael|last=Omondi|date=6 August 2007|accessdate=30 May 2018|website=AllAfrica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenya Reinsurance shares closed their first day of trading at KSh15.75. This was 65.78 per cent higher than the share offer price of Sh9.50 a share, a significant gain for shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=44639 |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022093629/http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=44639 |archive-date=22 October 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200708281056.html|title=Kenya Re Share Price Drops Sharply On Second Day of Trading|first=Allan|last=Odhiambo|date=28 August 2007|accessdate=30 May 2018|website=AllAfrica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''NSE revises stock market index:'''

On 20 July 2007, the [[Nairobi Stock Exchange]] (NSE) revised the companies listed on its main share index to replace inactive stocks. The 20-Share Index is a reflection of the twenty (20) most actively trading counters in Kenya and was last reviewed in May 2003.

In the financial sector, ICDCI replaced NIC Bank, while in the industrial sector; KenGen replaced BOC Gases, whose shares were suspended following the proposed merger with [[Carbacid Investments]] (see below). In the Agricultural sector, [[Rea Vipingo]] replaced Kakuzi, whereas, [[Mumias Sugar]] Company replaced Unilever Tea. In the Commercial and Service Sector, CMC replaced [[Uchumi]] Supermarkets Limited (under receivership&amp;nbsp;– see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200707201166.html|title=Kenya: NSE in Major Shake Up of 20-Share Index Companies|first=Washington|last=Gikunju|date=20 July 2007|accessdate=30 May 2018|website=AllAfrica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://africa.reuters.com/business/news/usnBAN048907.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218164747/http://africa.reuters.com/business/news/usnBAN048907.html |archive-date=18 December 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The review of the NSE 20-share index was done to bring on board newly listed firms with active trading track-records and would see the NSE [[market capitalisation]] increase substantially with the entry of the profitable firms from the country's fastest growing [[economic sectors]]. It is expected that this will give the market a better image, which reflects the true value of the [[:wikt:bourse|bourse]] as opposed to retaining less active stocks in the Index. [http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90778/6220960.html] [http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=43883]
* '''AccessKenya initial public offering:'''

On 4 June 2007 the AccessKenya Group was listed on the [[Nairobi Stock Exchange]], becoming the first [[Information Communication Technology]] (ICT) company to do so. The web firm, which provides wireless access and email, said the listing for 800 million Kenyan shillings (US$11.9 million) was oversubscribed by 363% with every category, from wealthy investors to institutional investors being fully subscribed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africa.reuters.com/business/news/usnBAN437638.html] {{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=42949 |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927041652/http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=42949 |archive-date=27 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPO also heralded the creation of a fifth investment segment at the bourse&amp;nbsp;– the technology sector. This is in addition to the already existing agricultural, commercial and services, finance and investment and industrial and allied sectors.

The shares began trading at Sh14 with 1,000,000 shares changing hands within an hour of the opening bell.
* '''The Carbacid Investments vs BOC Group tussle:'''

An attempted takeover bid of [[Carbacid Investments]] by [[The BOC Group|BOC Group]] was aborted after the capital markets regulator declined to endorse the deal. In May 2006, the CMA argued that the latter had not met all the terms it had stated in an offer to Carbacid shareholders. The critical condition in the deal to warrant the takeover and subsequent delisting of Carbacid from the NSE was that at least 80 per cent of Carbacid shareholders had to back the takeover transaction, but only owners holding 71.0 per cent backed the transaction. Ironically, a ruling by the Capital Markets Tribunal okayed the takeover forcing the CMA to appeal against the ruling. Mr Ntalami said the approval of the takeover deal was likely to set a bad precedent that would plunge future takeovers of listed companies into chaos.

The protracted takeover saga, that has seen the two counters suspended for over four(4) years was resolved in November 2009, as trading in carbon dioxide manufacturer Carbacid shares resumed after suspension since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastandard.net/InsidePage.php?id=1144029882&amp;cid=14] {{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Electronic trading commences at the NSE:'''

On 11 September 2006 the Nairobi Stock Exchange migrated from the hitherto Open Outcry system to the Automated Trading System (ATS), an electronic trading platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=39141 |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927041637/http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=39141 |archive-date=27 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The President commissioned the new technology on 25 October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kenyanewsnetwork.com/artman/publish/article_1363.shtml |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 December 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101040615/http://www.kenyanewsnetwork.com/artman/publish/article_1363.shtml |archive-date=1 November 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The change is expected to double the value of shares traded each day on the bourse with enhanced integrity and efficiency. Investors are now able to access current information thus facilitating them to make informed investment decisions on timely basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eastandard.net/hm_news/news_s.php?articleid=1143958077 |title=Archived copy |access-date=11 September 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914071105/http://www.eastandard.net/hm_news/news_s.php?articleid=1143958077 |archive-date=14 September 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 December 2007, the NSE completed its migration from the open outcry trading floor method to an all encompassing [[Wide Area Network]] (WAN) trading system which allows stockbrokers to trade from the comfort of their offices.
* '''Equity Bank listing:'''

Listing and official trading of Equity Bank shares on the NSE commenced on 7 August 2006; a day which saw the price move from Kes. 70 to Kes. 158 in a single price setting deal involving 1000 shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eastandard.net/archives/cl/print/news.php?articleid=1143956462 |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007113526/http://www.eastandard.net/archives/cl/print/news.php?articleid=1143956462 |archive-date=7 October 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''ScanGroup Ltd. IPO:'''

On 17 July 2006, the [[initial public offering]] of Scangroup Limited shares kicked off what was to be a historical listing at the NSE. Scangroup, became the first marketing services company in Africa to go public through an IPO. The advertising house, an intelligence-intensive outfit, offloaded 69 million company shares into the capital markets at an offer price of Kes 10.45 per share. The IPO was oversubscribed by 520% and official trading of the company's shares on the NSE) commenced on 29 August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eastandard.net/mag/mag.php?id=1143955486&amp;catid=50 |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007113444/http://www.eastandard.net/mag/mag.php?id=1143955486&amp;catid=50 |archive-date=7 October 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scangroup share price rose by 39% on its first day of trading to close the day at Kes. 15 with 3, 056,000 shares exchanging hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eastandard.net/hm_news/news.php?articleid=1143956445 |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927174536/http://www.eastandard.net/hm_news/news.php?articleid=1143956445 |archive-date=27 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''KenGen IPO:'''

In April 2006, the Government offloaded 659.51 million shares in Kenya Electric Generating Company (KenGen) through the [[capital markets]]. The IPO premiered at the NSE at a discounted price of Kes. 11.90 price before rallying to a high of Sh40, representing a massive fourfold jump.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eastandard.net/mags/fs/news.php?articleid=1143952893 |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010050930/http://www.eastandard.net/mags/fs/news.php?articleid=1143952893 |archive-date=10 October 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the IPO is credited for spurring the current appetite and excitement for investing in Kenya.

On 25 April 2007, an intended secondary offer for the shares, in pursuance of the IPO's initial success, was abruptly postponed by former Finance Minister [[Amos Kimunya]] attributing the move to the prevailing share price being very low and the bulk tariff conflict between Kengen and KPLC. [http://www.timesnews.co.ke/20may07/insight/ins1.html]
* '''CFCStanbic Bank rights issue:'''

On 23 December 2005, CFCStanbic Bank officially listed 12.0 million new shares, arising out of its successfully completed rights issue. The bank succeeded in raising the Kes. 744 million (US$10 million) needed to align its capital base with Central Bank of Kenya risk management guidelines.
* '''Uchumi Supermarkets rights issue:'''

In October 2005, the retail chain, already facing serious financial challenges, received approval from the CMA for its shareholders to inject an extra Kes. 1.1 billion (US$15 million) through a rights share issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.newratings.com/analyst_news/article_1040804.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927040444/http://www.newratings.com/analyst_news/article_1040804.html |archive-date=27 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, a year after the near-collapse of the retail supermarket, attention shifted to renewed efforts toward the retail chain's tortuous recovery strategy. The company's receiver-managers, led by Mr Jonanthan Ciano, offered shareholders yet another chance to inject Sh800 million (U.S$. 11.4 million) into the company under a new recapitalisation plan. Analysts then observed that were the plan to fail due to shareholder reluctance, the retail chain would have to find a new equity partner to fund its recovery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allafrica.com/stories/200705160997.html] {{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bdafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2114&amp;Itemid=5812 |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928151420/http://www.bdafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2114&amp;Itemid=5812 |archive-date=28 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''KCB rights issue:'''

The highly successful [[Kenya Commercial Bank]] rights issue in September 2004, mobilised in excess of Kes. 2.3 billion (US$31 million) needed for the bank's growth strategy. The rights offer for 50 million shares at a price of Kshs 49.00, was oversubscribed by 12.25%, necessitating a refund of Kes. 310 million (US$4.1million) to applicants following shortage of untaken rights for allotment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.firstglobalselect.com/scripts/cgiip.wsc/globalone/htm/news_article.r?vcnews-id=27 |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819144142/http://www.firstglobalselect.com/scripts/cgiip.wsc/globalone/htm/news_article.r?vcnews-id=27 |archive-date=19 August 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accolades==
* Kenya's secondary bond market voted among the best in Africa: A report released by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), in April 2007, ranked Kenya's secondary [[bond market]] as among the most vibrant in Africa, coming only third to South Africa and [[Mauritius]]. The World Regional Economic Survey for April 2007 reports that, "Kenya's lengthening maturities which has allowed better pricing of debt instruments, puts it among the few countries in Africa with a vibrant debt market."&lt;ref name="bdafrica.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://bdafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=853&amp;Itemid=3320 |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928151319/http://bdafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=853&amp;Itemid=3320 |archive-date=28 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The overwhelming success of the KenGen IPO was widely commended for generating a lot of awareness in investments among ordinary Kenyans of all ages, professions and income levels. The landmark IPO led to a massive interest in opening stock brokerage accounts and investing in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesnews.co.ke/02may06/business/buns2.html|title=Times News - Bold, Authoritative, and True|website=Times News|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastandard.net/archives/cl/hm_news/news_s.php?articleid=1143952641&amp;date=18/5/2006] {{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Central Depository and Settlement Corporation (CDSC), the number of people with CDS accounts increased significantly and as at the end of June 2007 stood at over 750,000 accounts up from 78,300 in December 2005; a noteworthy tenfold increase in only one-and-a-half years.
* Many have also commended Ntalami for his resolve in rejecting plans to use a bookbuilding approach to allocate the KenGen shares. The initial plan is said to have been abandoned after it appeared to be biased against the small investor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kenyanmarket.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=72&amp;Itemid=49] {{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Under Ntalami's watch at the healm, the NSE 20 Share Index posted a historic mark, surpassing its previous all-time high of 5,030 points, hit on 18 February 1994. As at close of trading on 10 November 2006 it stood at 5654.46 points. The NSE index has delivered an unprecedented growth in excess of over 300% over the last two and a half years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesnews.co.ke/27oct06/business/buns10.html|title=Times News - Bold, Authoritative, and True|website=Times News|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eastandard.net/hm_news/news.php?articleid=34242 |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218012056/http://www.eastandard.net/hm_news/news.php?articleid=34242 |archive-date=18 February 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.stockskenya.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901030710/http://www.stockskenya.com/ |archive-date=1 September 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kenya-Re IPO launched.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Nelius Kariuki, the Kenya Reinsurance MD, rings the bell during the opening of the Kenya Re IPO. Looking on (back-left) is former CMA CEO Edward Ntalami.]]
* For over a decade since March 1996, the NSE had only listed three new companies, namely [[Kenya Airways]], [[Mumias]] and ICID-I.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nse.co.ke/History.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=16 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104002912/http://www.nse.co.ke/History.htm |archive-date=4 November 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In under four years of the former Chief Executive's tenure, the bourse witnessed the successful launch of six IPOs, namely KenGen, Scangroup, [[Eveready Battery Company|Eveready]] East Africa (listed with an oversubscription of over 800%&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eveready.co.ke/pdf/IPO_results_announcement.pdf] {{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Mumias Sugar]] and AccessKenya Group (listed with an oversubscription of 363%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200705150699.html|title=Kenya: AccessKenya IPO Oversubscribed, Trading Starts on June 4|first=Fred|last=Oluoch|date=15 May 2007|accessdate=30 May 2018|website=AllAfrica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and recently Kenya Re ''(see photo (right))''; including the oversubscription of five Rights Issues, namely KCB Bank, CFCStanbic Bank, Uchumi Supermarkets, Diamond Trust and Olympia Capital. Ntalami left office just prior to the landmark listing of [[Safaricom]], the leading mobile telecommunications service provider in the country.
* The Year of the IPO: 2006 was hailed as "The Year of the IPO" by Madabhushi Soundarajan, former managing director, CFCStanbic Bank and CFC Financial Services. "You can call 2006 the Year of the Initial Public Offer where many Kenyans saw the benefit of the stock market to make wealth" he said, through a supplement/advertising feature released in the country's leading newspaper, ''Daily Nation'' on 13 December 2006. CFCStanbic Bank is part of the CFCStanbic Group whose Total Assets then stood at over KShs 16 billion. In line with this, [[James Murigu]], the former managing director of Suntra Investment Bank, has commended the CMA's pace in processing of new applications for bourse listings.
* The CMA has been lauded by the private sector and newly listed companies for reviving confidence in Kenya's capital markets which has in turn translated into active participation from both manufacturing and service sectors. In August 2007, [[Renaissance Capital (Russian company)|Renaissance Capital]] – a major multinational [[investment bank]], was granted license to operate in Kenya. RenCap commended the regulator for the speedy processing of its application which showed its commitment to deepening the [[capital markets]] in Kenya.&lt;ref name="bdafrica.com1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bdafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2197&amp;Itemid=5812 |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928151401/http://www.bdafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2197&amp;Itemid=5812 |archive-date=28 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bdafrica.com1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bdafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2160&amp;Itemid=5844 |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928151232/http://www.bdafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2160&amp;Itemid=5844 |archive-date=28 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Investor Education and Awareness Programmes: On 30 January 2006 the CMA hosted a major Workshop at the Grand Regency Hotel, Nairobi, inviting leading media houses, journalists and industry players, both local and international, to train them on the tenets of good capital markets reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ke.undp.org/JournalistsWorkshopCMA.doc |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 December 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613082530/http://www.ke.undp.org/JournalistsWorkshopCMA.doc |archive-date=13 June 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CMA also participated in the Mombasa and Nairobi Agricultural Society of Kenya (ASK) shows in August and October 2006 respectively, where the Authority won an award for the Best Financial Institutions stand at the Mombasa ASK. CMA has in the past hosted a number of seminars including one for State Corporations. Also, in May 2007, the market regulator begun supplement releases to educate the public on the capital markets.

==Criticism==
* Ntalami, a former stockbroker, and Jimnah Mbaru (current NSE chairman and stockbroker), have been criticised in the past of being inappropriate to self-regulate the [[capital markets]] because their affiliations to capital markets could create potential conflicts of interest. The NSE (and its top management) have in the past come under fire for being an 'exclusive club' tightly controlled by an eighteen (18) member team of existing [[brokerage firm|market brokers]] and investment banks. In fact, in a recent attempt to debunk this perception, it was reported on 3 August 2007 that the NSE would put up for sale a seat on its executive board at an estimated reserve price of Ksh 300 million (US$4.5million).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bdafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2285&amp;Itemid=5812 |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928151218/http://www.bdafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2285&amp;Itemid=5812 |archive-date=28 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The coveted seat was clinched on 21 August 2007 by [[Renaissance Capital (Russian company)|Renaissance Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rencap.com/eng/about/news.asp?ID=295 |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227111234/http://www.rencap.com/eng/about/news.asp?ID=295 |archive-date=27 December 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Corporate bonds: There have been few corporate bonds approved since the beginning of 2006. The domestic bond market is widely viewed as under-developed, an observation made by Ntalami.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=33954 |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 December 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927041609/http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=33954 |archive-date=27 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A report released in April 2007 by the [[International Monetary Fund]] ranked Kenya's secondary [[bond market]] as being among the best in Africa, coming third only to South Africa and [[Mauritius]].&lt;ref name="bdafrica.com"/&gt; The outstanding value of corporate bonds as at the end of October 2006 rose to Kes. 8.6 billion ($123 million) following the issue of the second [[tranche]] of Shelter Afrique in October.
* Media shy: Unlike his contemporaries such as NSE chairman Jimnah Mbaru, Suntra Investment Bank's [[James Murigu]] and Standard Investment Bank's [[James Wangunyu]], who do not mind the public limelight, Ntalami has by far and large curved out a quiet demeanor. There have been calls for the Chief Executive to be more visible and for the CMA to create a better communications/PR mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationmedia.com/dailynation/nmgindex.asp |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 July 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707221748/http://www.nationmedia.com/dailynation/nmgindex.asp |archive-date=7 July 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200704020440.html|title=Kenya: Sensational Stories Destructive|date=2 April 2007|accessdate=30 May 2018|website=AllAfrica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reacting to this, the CMA recently made efforts to bolster its human resource capacity. On 10 July 2007, it moved to recruit new personnel for various departments in financial, public relations, legal, research, IT and compliance. The recruitment is to be done through a human resources placement firm Osano and &amp; Associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bdafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1872&amp;Itemid=5822 |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928151414/http://www.bdafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1872&amp;Itemid=5822 |archive-date=28 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Master in Management''' (EMM) is a 2-year general management master program run jointly by [[École de management de Lyon|EMLYON Business School]] (France), [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Ludwig Maximilian Universität]] (Germany) and [[Lancaster University Management School]] (UK). The purpose of the program is to allow students to study international business from a European and global perspective.

The European Master in Management is '''''a triple master's degree based in the France, Germany and the UK'''''. After completing all program requirements, '''''students are awarded three [[Master of Science|MSc]] Diplomas: one from each of the Partner Universities'''''. The EMM was the first European triple-degree program.

The objective of the EMM is to prepare students for a wide range of career possibilities all focused on global business through a combination of academic periods on different campuses, in-company internships, and a unique multicultural European experience with a great diversity in the student body. The first year is devoted to general management courses, whereas the second year is dedicated to a specialization in [[Corporate finance|Corporate Finance]], [[Marketing]], Strategy &amp; Change or [[Corporate development|Corporate Development]].

When the program was launched, in 2007, [[Aston Business School]] was the program's Partner University in the UK. After Aston Business School left the partnership, the program was run as a double degree master from EMLYON Business School and Ludwig Maximilian Universität (Germany) until Lancaster University Management School joined the partnership, bringing it back to a triple degree program.

==Program==

In the first year, students stay on the same campus ([[École de management de Lyon|EMLYON Business School]]) and are provided with a broad foundation of management knowledge. Each fundamental management course gives students a broader perspective of global business, as it is designed and taught jointly by a team of professors from [[École de management de Lyon|EMLYON]], [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|LMU]] and [[Lancaster University Management School|LUMS]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.european-master.com/Content/classes-teaching-methods&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second year, students take on an elective specialisation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.european-master.com/Content/Specialisations&lt;/ref&gt; This is an opportunity to study at a new campus, depending on the specialization chosen:
* [[Corporate Finance]] at [[École de management de Lyon|EMLYON Business School]] (at the European Campus in Lyon or at the Asian Campus in Shanghai)
* Marketing at [[École de management de Lyon|EMLYON Business School]] (at the European Campus in Lyon)
* Strategy &amp; Change at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Ludwig Maximilian Universität]] (at the campus in Munich)
* Corporate Development at [[Lancaster University Management School]] (at the campus in Lancaster)

Students spend at least one semester in a company, on a management internship, and must write a professionally oriented Master's Dissertation. This provides the opportunity to strengthen relations with the business world.

==European Master in Management Partners Companies==

Throughout the year, students have multiple opportunities to contact with the corporate partners. Different companies are frequently represented on campus, either to give lectures and seminars or to offer internship and job opportunities directly to the students.

Some of the main partner companies are:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.european-master.com/Careers-Network/partner-companies&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Excellent SME''' is international project, aiming to establish [[white list]] of small and medium enterprises  (SME) by means of [[certification]] system. Project brings emphasis on web site certification, since internet is becoming prevailing media for promotion and search of business opportunities and partners.

== Principles ==

The project is built on three pillars:
* institution of trust, preferably a [[chamber of commerce]], assuming the role of '''issuer'''
* [[credit rating]] data provided by credit rating agency
* technology that enables easy verification of certificate validity and consequently prevents dilution of trust caused by forgery ({{cite web | title = Safesigned | url = http://safesigned.com/ }}).

== Criteria ==

The Excellent SME certificate can be obtained by companies meeting basic criteria:
* small or medium enterprise (usually up to 250 employees, other measures may apply in different countries)
* minimum turnover of 25000 €
* [[credit score]] at least 6 (out of 10), BBB in some credit scoring systems.

The certificate is issued for period of 1 year. However the credit score is under permanent monitoring and the certificate is revoked prematurely if the holder's credit score drops below 6.

==Suggested benefits==
=== For certificate holder ===
By publishing the certificate the holder exposes its good standing business and successful practices. The publishing is possible on holder's web site, stationery, promotional materials, vehicles etc. The observer can thus instantly establish the level of trust that would otherwise require some inquiries with credit rating agencies. As a consequence a selection of business partner becomes easier, faster, cheaper and risk free.

=== For the community ===
With growing number of certified companies the business environment becomes more transparent. Good enterprises are more exposed and visible and client have easier task finding such partner.

== History ==
Project was initiated in 2012 in [[Slovenia]] by partners [[Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gzs.si/en/&lt;/ref&gt; credit rating agency {{cite web | title = COFACE Slovenija | url = http://coface.si/ }} and technology provider CONNET d.o.o. with its {{cite web | title = SafeSigned(r) technology | url = http://safesigned.com/ }}

[[Serbia]] joined the project the same year. In 2013 [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Romania]] followed. In 2014 [[Bulgaria]] joined.

In [[management]], models of the '''learning curve effect''' and the closely related '''experience curve effect''' express the relationship between equation{{clarification needed|date=November 2018}} and [[x-efficiency|efficiency]] or between efficiency gains and investment in the effort.

== Learning curve and learning curve effect ==
{{main|Learning curve}}
"Learning curves" were first described qualitatively in 1885 by the German psychologist [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]], who was investigating the difficulty of memorizing varying numbers of verbal stimuli.&lt;ref name="ebbing_book"&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=oRSMDF6y3l8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Page 42, Fig 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=ikEMAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22learning+curve%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22learning%20curve%22&amp;f=false The American Journal of Psychology, Volume 14 1903 By Granville Stanley Hall, Edward Bradford Titchene&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent findings about the complex processes of learning are discussed in the [[Learning curve]] article.

Experience shows that the more times a task has been performed, the less time is required on each subsequent iteration.  This relationship was probably first quantified in 1936 at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] in the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;Wright, T.P., Factors Affecting the Cost of Airplanes, ''[[Journal of Aeronautical Sciences]]'', 3(4) (1936): 122-128.&lt;/ref&gt; where it was determined that every time total [[aircraft]] production doubled, the required labour time decreased by 10 to 15 percent. Subsequent empirical studies from other industries have yielded different values ranging from only a couple of percentages up to 30%, but in most cases it is a constant percentage: It did not vary at different scales of operation. The Learning Curve model posits that for each doubling of the total quantity of items produced, costs decrease by a fixed proportion.  

===Unit curve===

Empirical research has validated the following mathematical form for the unit cost, ''P&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', producing unit number ''x'' starting with ''P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' for a wide variety of different products and services:  

:&lt;math&gt;P_x = P_1 x^{\log_2 (b)}&lt;/math&gt;, 

where (1-''b'') is the proportion reduction in the unit cost with each doubling in the cumulative production.  To see this, note the following:  

:&lt;math&gt;P_2x = P_1 (2x)^{\log_2 (b)} = P_x 2^{\log_2 (b)} = P_x b&lt;/math&gt; 

Of course, this is only a statistical average and will rarely if ever exactly predict the unit cost of producing any future product.  However, it has been found to be useful in many contexts with ''b'' ranging from 0.75 to 0.9 in different industries (so 1-''b'' ranges from 0.1 to 0.25, as noted elsewhere in this article).

==The experience curve==
Generally, the production of any good or service shows the experience curve effect.  Each time cumulative volume doubles, value added costs (including administration, marketing, distribution, and manufacturing) fall by a constant percentage.

The Experience Curve was developed by [[Bruce D. Henderson]] and the [[Boston Consulting Group]] (BCG) while analyzing overall cost behavior in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Research by BCG in the 1960s and 70s observed experience curve effects for various industries that ranged from 10 to 25 percent.&lt;ref name="HaxMajluf"&gt;{{Citation

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Experience curve.gif|500px|thumb|Experience curve]] --&gt;

These effects are often expressed graphically. The curve is plotted with the cumulative units produced on the horizontal axis and unit cost on the vertical axis. A curve showing a 15% cost reduction for every doubling of output is called an “85% experience curve”, indicating that unit costs drop to 85% of their original level.

The experience curve is described by a [[power law]] function sometimes referred to as '''Henderson's Law''':&lt;ref name="Grant2003"&gt;{{Citation |last=Grant |first=Robert M. |authorlink= |title=Contemporary strategy analysis  |year=2004 |publisher=Blackwell publishing |location=[[United States|U.S.]], [[UK]], [[Australia]], [[Germany]] |isbn=1-4051-1999-3 }} &lt;!-- note first published in 1991 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C_n = C_1  n^{-a} &lt;/math&gt;
where:
* ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the cost of the first [[unit of production]]
* ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the cost of the ''n''-th unit of production
* ''n'' is the cumulative volume of production
* ''a'' is the elasticity of cost with regard to output

===Reasons for the effect===
&lt;div class="infobox" style="width: 20em;"&gt;
'''Examples'''

NASA quotes the following experience curves:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/news/reference/calc/learn.htm Cost Models - Learning Curve Calculator&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Aerospace]] 85%
*[[Shipbuilding]] 80-85%
*Complex [[machine tool]]s for new models 75-85%
*Repetitive electronics manufacturing 90-95%
*Repetitive [[machining]] or punch-press operations 90-95%
*Repetitive electrical operations 75-85%
*Repetitive [[welding]] operations 90%
*[[Raw material]]s 93-96%
*Purchased Parts 85-88%
&lt;/div&gt;

The primary reason for why experience and learning curve effects apply, of course, is the complex processes of learning involved.  As discussed in the [[learning curve|main article]], learning generally begins with making successively larger finds and then successively smaller ones.  The equations for these effects come from the usefulness of mathematical models for certain somewhat predictable aspects of those generally non-deterministic processes.
They include: 
* '''Labour efficiency''' - Workers become physically more dexterous. They become mentally more confident and spend less time hesitating, learning, experimenting, or making mistakes. Over time they learn short-cuts and improvements. This applies to all employees and managers, not just those directly involved in production.
* '''Standardization, specialization, and methods improvements''' - As processes, parts, and products become more standardized, efficiency tends to increase. When employees specialize in a limited set of tasks, they gain more experience with these tasks and operate at a faster rate.
* '''Technology-Driven Learning''' - Automated production technology and information technology can introduce efficiencies as they are implemented and people learn how to use them efficiently and effectively.
* '''Better use of equipment''' - as total production has increased, manufacturing equipment will have been more fully exploited, lowering fully accounted unit costs. In addition, purchase of more productive equipment can be justifiable.
* '''Changes in the resource mix''' - As a company acquires experience, it can alter its mix of inputs and thereby become more efficient.
* '''Product redesign''' - As the manufacturers and consumers have more experience with the product, they can usually find improvements.  This filters through to the manufacturing process.  A good example of this is Cadillac's testing of various "bells and whistles" specialty accessories.  The ones that did not break became mass-produced in other General Motors products; the ones that didn't stand the test of user "beatings" were discontinued, saving the car company money.  As General Motors produced more cars, they learned how to best produce products that work for the least money.
* '''Network-building and use-cost reductions''' ([[network effect]]s) - As a product enters more widespread use, the consumer uses it more efficiently because they're familiar with it.  One fax machine in the world can do nothing, but if everyone has one, they build an increasingly efficient network of communications.  Another example is email accounts; the more there are, the more efficient the network is, the lower everyone's cost per utility of using it.
* '''Shared experience effects''' - Experience curve effects are reinforced when two or more products share a common activity or resource. Any efficiency learned from one product can be applied to the other products. (This is related to the [[principle of least astonishment]]).

===Experience curve discontinuities===
The experience curve effect can on occasion come to an abrupt stop. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  Graphically, the curve is truncated. Existing processes become obsolete and the firm must upgrade to remain competitive. The upgrade will mean the old experience curve will be replaced by a new one. This occurs when:
* Competitors introduce new products or processes that you must respond to
* Key suppliers have much bigger customers that determine the price of products and services, and that becomes the main cost driver for the product
* Technological change requires that you or your suppliers change processes
* The experience curve strategies must be re-evaluated because
**they are leading to [[price wars]]
**they are not producing a [[marketing mix]] that the market values

===Strategic consequences of the effect===
The BCG strategists examined the consequences of the experience effect for businesses. They concluded that because relatively low cost of operations is a very powerful strategic advantage, firms should capitalize on these learning and experience effects.
&lt;ref name="Henderson1974"&gt;
{{cite web

 }} 
&lt;/ref&gt;
The reasoning is increased activity leads to increased learning, which leads to lower costs, which can lead to lower prices, which can lead to increased market share, which can lead to increased profitability and market dominance. According to BCG, the most effective business strategy was one of striving for market dominance in this way. This was particularly true when a firm had an early leadership in market share. It was claimed that if you cannot get enough market share to be competitive, you should get out of that business and concentrate your resources where you can take advantage of experience effects and gain dominant market share. The BCG strategists developed [[Portfolio (finance)|product portfolio techniques]] like the [[B.C.G. Analysis|BCG Matrix]] (in part) to manage this strategy.

Today we recognize that there are other strategies that are just as effective as cost leadership so we need not limit ourselves to this one path. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  See for example [[Porter generic strategies]] which talks about [[product differentiation]] and focused [[market segment]]ation as two alternatives to cost leadership. Sterman et al. show that expanding rapidly to realize experience curve benefits is a high risk strategy in dynamic markets with common features like bounded rationality and durable products.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://web.mit.edu/jsterman/www/BLC.html Strategic Dynamics with Increasing Returns and Bounded Rationality]'', John D. Sterman, Rebecca Henderson, Eric D. Beinhocker, and Lee I. Newman, Management Science, 53(4), April 2007, 683–696.&lt;/ref&gt;

One consequence of the experience curve effect is that cost savings should be passed on as price decreases rather than kept as profit margin increases. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  The BCG strategists felt that maintaining a relatively high price, although very profitable in the short run, spelled disaster for the strategy in the long run. They felt that it encouraged competitors to enter the market, triggering a steep price decline and a competitive [[shakeout]]. If prices were reduced as unit costs fell (due to experience curve effects), then competitive entry would be discouraged and one's market share maintained.  Using this strategy, you could always stay one step ahead of new or existing rivals.

===Origins of the experience curve===
[[File:Experience curve example Ford Model T.jpg|400px|right|An example application of the experience curve, 1974, [[Bruce D. Henderson]]|thumb]]
Excerpts of Bruce D. Henderson's published writing describe the development of the experience curve.&lt;ref name=Henderson&gt;{{cite web 
 | first = Bruce D.
 | last = Henderson
|url=https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/classics/corporate_finance_corporate_strategy_portfolio_management_the_experience_curve_reviewed_history/|title=The Experience Curve – Reviewed II: History, 1973|accessdate=2013-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Starting in 1966, according to Henderson: 
:"The Boston Consulting Group's first effort to formulate the experience curve concept was an attempt to explain cost behavior over time in a process industry. The correlation between competitive profitability and market share was strikingly apparent.&lt;ref name="Henderson" /&gt; 
 
:"The pattern of the learning curve was an attractive initial hypothesis to explain this. The name, Experience Curve, was selected to distinguish this cost behavior phenomenon from the well known and well documented learning curve effect. The two are related, but quite different."&lt;ref name="Henderson" /&gt;

:BCG found there were far reaching implications based on volume changes in production.&lt;ref name="Henderson" /&gt;

:"Semiconductors provided the evidence on which to build the experience curve concept itself. The wide variety of semiconductors offered a chance to compare differing growth rates and price decline rates in a similar environment. Price data supplied by the Electronic Industries Association was compared with accumulated industry volume. Two distinct patterns emerged.&lt;ref name="Henderson" /&gt;

:"In one pattern, prices, in current dollars, remained constant for long periods and then began a relatively steep and long continued decline in constant dollars. In the other pattern, prices, in constant dollars, declined steadily at a constant rate of about 25 percent each time accumulated experience doubled. That was the experience curve. That was 1966."&lt;ref name="Henderson" /&gt;

===Criticisms===
Some authors{{who|date=October 2014}} claim that in most organizations it is impossible to quantify the effects. They claim that experience effects are so closely intertwined with [[economies of scale]] that it is impossible to separate the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berndt|first=Ernst|title=The practice of econometrics: classic and contemporary, Chapter 3|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In theory we can say that economies of scale are those efficiencies that arise from an increased scale of production, and that experience effects are those efficiencies that arise from the learning and experience gained from repeated activities, but in practice the two mirror each other: growth of experience coincides with increased production. Economies of scale should be considered one of the reasons why experience effects exist. Likewise, experience effects are one of the reasons why economies of scale exist.  This makes assigning a numerical value to either of them difficult.

The [[well travelled road effect]] may lead people to overestimate the effect of the experience curve.

[[File:Fairtrade Certification Mark.svg|thumb|[[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]]]]

The '''Fairtrade certification''' initiative was created to form a new method for [[trade|economic trade]]. This method takes an ethical standpoint, and considers the [[Producer (agriculture)|producers]] first.

Several attempts to market fair trade products were observed in the 1960s and 1970s, fair trade sales became widespread with the Max Havelaar labeling initiative in 1988 and the establishment of Fairtrade International in 1997. Fairtrade sales prior to labeling initiatives were contained to relatively small world shops (also called charity shops), operated by alternative trading organizations (ATOs) such as Oxfam and Traidcraft.

At the initiative of Mexican coffee farmers, the first fair trade labeling initiative, Stichting Max Havelaar, was launched in the Netherlands on November 15, 1988, by Nico Roozen, Frans van der Hoff, and Dutch ecumenical development agency Solidaridad. In 1992, the organization was founded by Michael Gidney. The initiative offered coffee producers following various social and environmental standards an above market price for their crop. The coffee, originating from the UCIRI cooperative in Mexico, was imported by Dutch company Van Weely, roasted by Neuteboom, sold directly to shops and, for the first time, to mainstream retailers across the Netherlands.

The initiative was groundbreaking as for the first time Fairtrade coffee was being offered to a larger consumer segment. Fairtrade labeling certification provided some assurance that the products were really benefiting the farm workers at the end of the supply chain.

Fairtrade International started with the coffee industry, but now covers a range of products such as [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[fruit]], [[cotton]], [[flower]]s, [[tea]] and others. The established buyers of these products make up a [[niche market]], which makes marketing for Fairtrade a challenge.

As of 2016, 1,411 producer organizations in 73 developing countries were Fairtrade certified, representing over 1.66 million [[farmers]] and workers. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://monitoringreport2017.fairtrade.net/en/|title=Monitoring the Scope and Benefits of Fairtrade: Impact Report 2017 - Fairtrade Monitoring Report - 9th Edition|website=Fairtrade Monitoring Report - 9th Edition|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The fair trade movement stemmed from an initiative established by the Dutch development agency, Solidaridad, and aimed to create more equality between coffee producers and roasters. The agency recognized that the producers were not being treated fairly, and strived to create a more ethical system to trade. 

The Max Havelaar seal, which was based on a fictional character, was established "to license existing roasters and retailers who complied with its fair trade criteria".The seal provided specific benefits for cooperatives of small coffee producers in Mexico, with the aim of balancing the production of crops to be exported, as well as crops for the local population. The four benefits in this early model of the fairtrade initiative were:

#  A guaranteed minimum price to protect producers from any potential falls in the global market.
#  An additional 10% of the market price for their investment in social and environmental projects.
#  A 60% advance to producers to reduce the pressure of selling their product "immediately after harvest when its price is lowest"
#  A commitment by roasters to eliminate any other parties within the supply chain, with the aim of dealing more directly with producers.
The initiative was a great financial success and was replicated in several other markets: in the ensuing years, similar non-profit Fairtrade labelling organizations were set up in other European countries and North America, called "Max Havelaar" (in [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[France]]), "Transfair" (in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Italy]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Japan]]), or carrying a national name: "Fairtrade Mark" in the [[UK]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], "Rättvisemärkt" in [[Sweden]], and "Reilu kauppa" (Finnish) or "Rejäl handel" ([[Finland Swedish|Swedish]]) in [[Finland]].

Initially, while the Max Havelaars and the Transfairs co-operated product by product with equivalent standards and producer lists there was no contractual agreement to ensure global standards. In 1994, a process of convergence among the labelling organizations&amp;nbsp;– or "LIs" (for "Labelling Initiatives")&amp;nbsp;– started with the establishment of a TransMax working group, culminating in 1997 in the creation of [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]], now simply known as Fairtrade International (FLO). FLO is an umbrella organization whose mission is to set the Fairtrade Standards, support, inspect and certify disadvantaged producers and harmonize the Fairtrade message across the movement.

In 2002, FLO launched a new [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]], effectively replacing most previous Max Havelaar and TransFair certification marks. The goals of the launch were to improve the visibility of the Mark on supermarket shelves, facilitate cross-border trade and simplify export procedures for both producers and exporters.

Today, all but one labeling initiative have fully adopted the new mark. [[TransFair USA]] has apparently elected to continue with its own [[Fair Trade Certified Mark]] for the time being,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transfairusa.org/content/resources/faq-advanced.php#bluegreen TransFair USA FAQ] - "TransFair USA, has elected to continue using its current label."&lt;/ref&gt; while the Canadian organization currently allows certified products to carry either mark, it is transitioning toward the sole use of the International Fairtrade Certification Mark.

In January 2004, Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International was divided into two independent organizations: Fairtrade International (FLO), which sets Fairtrade Standards and provides producer business support, and FLO-CERT, which inspects and certifies producer organizations. The aim of the split was to ensure the impartiality, the independence of the certification process and compliance with [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 65 standards for product certification bodies.

At present, over 25 labelling initiatives and producer networks are members or associate members of Fairtrade International. There are now FAIRTRADE Certification Marks on dozens of different products, based on FLO's certification for coffee, [[tea]], [[rice]], [[banana]]s, [[mango]]es, [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[cotton]], [[sugar]], [[honey]], [[fruit juice]]s, [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[fruit|fresh fruit]], [[quinoa]], [[herb]]s and [[spice]]s, [[wine]] and [[Football (ball)|footballs]].

In 2009, fair trade coffee was sufficiently mainstream that [[Walmart]], the world's largest retailer began selling it, and pricing it about the same as regular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505144_162-51372457/what-to-buy-at-walmart/ What to Buy at Walmart] 2009; revised 2011; accessed 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fairtrade and Fairmined dual certification for [[gold]] was launched across the United Kingdom on 14 February 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/14/fairtrade-gold?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Fairtrade hallmark sets the gold standard|author=Kate Carter|date=14 February 2011|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a joint scheme between [[The Fairtrade Foundation]] and [[The Association for Responsible Mining]].

==The global market==

The Solidaridad informed large audiences of the mistreatment of coffee producers and poor living conditions in developing countries. They worked with other associations as well as the mass media to spread the message and create an awareness of their fair trade initiative. Because of their efforts, in 1988 the first bag of Max Hevelaar sealed coffee from Mexico was delivered to Holland's Prince Claus, and was launched to be sold in supermarkets throughout Holland. By the 1990s every western European country had established their own national version of the Max Hevelaar initiative.

Between the late 1980s and the mid-1990s, multiple national initiatives following a fair trade system coexisted within Europe, the US, Canada, and Japan.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Nicholls, A., &amp; Opal, C. (2005). Fairtrade certification. In ''Fair trade: Market-driven ethical consumption'' (p. 128). London.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, however, 17 national initiatives joined forces to create one international umbrella organisation called the Fair Trade Organization (FLO). FLO is based in Bonn, Germany, and has quickly become the largest organisation of its kind.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; FLO also has branches and field workers in Africa, Central and South America and China.  The international fair trade label was introduced in 2002 to improve visibility for consumers. The Fairtrade producers did not like the way they were treated.

==Marketing fair trade==
A key part of the fair trade initiative is to inform consumers through innovative marketing. The marketing must create a value proposition for the initiative that encompasses the ethical side, as well as the quality of the product.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

==How it works==
As an example: [[fair trade]] coffee packers in developed countries pay a fee to their country's Fairtrade organization for the right to use the brand and logo. Nearly the entire fee goes to marketing. Packers and retailers can charge as much as they want for the coffee. The coffee has to come from a certified Fairtrade cooperative, which pays certification and inspection fees. The importer is obliged to pay the exporter a base price which keeps the price from sinking below that level. It is sometimes higher than the going world price, but at times when coffee prices are high, it may be lower than the going price. There is an additional "producer premium" (20c/lb for coffee). For a few products, like coffee, there is also a minimum price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade International|title=Fairtrade Standard for Coffee for Small Producer Organizations|date=April 1, 2011|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-01_EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf |page=4|accessdate=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cooperatives or other Fairtrade certified firms incur additional costs including increased marketing costs, certification and inspection fees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/35.html|title=Fee System Small Producer Organization - Explanatory Document|year=2011|publisher=FLO-CERT Gmbh|accessdate= January 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and costs of conforming to the specifications.

Any deficit after paying these costs means a lower price for farmers, while any surplus from the premium price must be spent on "social projects" for "common goals" organized by the exporting cooperative rather than being an extra payment for farmers.&lt;ref name="EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade International|title=Fairtrade Standard for Coffee for Small Producer Organizations|date=April 1, 2011|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-01_EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf |accessdate=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V.

Fairtrade farmers have to meet a large range of criteria on production: there are limits on using child labour, pesticides, herbicides, genetically modified products and so on.&lt;ref name="GTS_EN.pdf p11"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V. |date=April 2, 2012 |title=Generic Fairtrade Trade Standard |page=11 |url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf |accessdate=January 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502051837/http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf |archivedate=May 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fairtrade standards==
[[File:FairtradeCertifiedCottonTShirt.jpg|thumb|275px|right|A T-shirt made from Fairtrade certified cotton]]

Fairtrade standards contain minimum requirements that all producer organizations must meet to become certified as well as progress requirements in which producers must demonstrate improvements over time. To become certified Fairtrade producers, the cooperatives and their member farmers must operate to certain standards laid down by Fairtrade International. FLO-CERT, the for-profit side, handles producer certification, inspecting and certifying producer organizations in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;ref name="FLOCERT"&gt;FLO-CERT (2008). [http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/main.php?lg=en FLO-CERT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918131636/http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/main.php?lg=en |date=2009-09-18 }}. URL accessed on August 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several types of Fairtrade standards, including standards for contract situations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade International|title=Fairtrade standard for Contract Production|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-09-25_CP_EN.pdf|date=September 25, 2012|accessdate=January 23, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510191206/http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-09-25_CP_EN.pdf|archivedate=May 10, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for importers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International|date=April 2, 2012|title=Generic Fairtrade Trade Standard|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf|accessdate=January 15, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502051837/http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf|archivedate=May 2, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also for the different products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our standards|url=https://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/List_of_Fairtrade_Standards.pdf|website=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairtrade standards for small farmers' organizations include requirements for [[democracy|democratic]] decision making, so that farmers may have a say in how the Fairtrade Premiums are invested. They also include requirements for capacity building and economic strengthening of the organization.&lt;ref name="SPO_EN.pdf"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V.|date=July 11, 2011|title=Fairtrade Standard for Small Producer Organizations|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-07-11_SPO_EN.pdf|accessdate=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairtrade standards for hired labour situations specify that employees receive minimum wages and [[collective bargaining]]. The standards also specify that Fairtrade-certified [[plantation]]s should have no forced or [[child labour]] and that health and safety requirements are met. In a hired labour situation, Fairtrade standards require a "joint body" to be set up with representatives from both the management and the employees. This joint body decides on how Fairtrade Premiums will be spent to benefit [[plantation]] employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade International|date=December 29, 2011|title=Fairtrade standard for Hired Labour|url=
http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2011-12-29-HL_EN.pdf|accessdate=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairtrade standards and procedures are approved by the Fairtrade International Standards Committee, an external committee comprising all FLO stakeholders (labeling initiatives, producers and traders) and external experts. Fairtrade standards are set by FLO in accordance to the requirements of the ISEAL Code of Good Practice in standard setting and are in addition the result of a consultation process, involving a variety of stakeholders: producers, traders, external experts, inspectors, and certification staff.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade International (2006). [http://www.fairtrade.net/standard_setting.html Standard Setting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925031518/http://www.fairtrade.net/standard_setting.html |date=2006-09-25 }}. Accessed October 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fairtrade pricing==

The main aspects of the Fairtrade system are the Minimum Price and the Premium. These are paid to the exporting firm, usually a second tier cooperative, not to the farmer. They are not paid for everything produced by the cooperative members, but for that proportion of their output they are able to sell with the brand 'Fairtrade Certified', typically 17% of their turnover, rising to as much as 60% in a few cases.
* The '''Fairtrade Premium''' is an extra payment over the market price (e.g. an extra 20c/lb for coffee) which is paid to the exporting organization. The residual after extra costs incurred in producing and marketing Fairtrade have been met must be spent on "social projects"  for social and economic development in the producing communities, rather than being given to farmers as extra payment.&lt;ref name="EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SPO_EN.pdf p28"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V.|date=July 11, 2011|title=Fairtrade Standard for Small Producer Organizations|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-07-11_SPO_EN.pdf|accessdate=January 3, 2013|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The producers themselves decide how these funds are to be spent. They are generally used for improvements in [[health]], [[education]] or other social facilities, although it may also be used for certain development projects to enable farmers to improve productivity or reduce their reliance on single commodities. Fairtrade producer organizations are required to be able to show what happened to the money, and FLO-CERT should check whether they have such a system in place. 
* The '''Fairtrade Minimum Price''' is a guaranteed price to be paid for a few products like coffee when the world prices collapse. Again, it would usually be spent on "social projects" rather than going to the farmers.

==Fairtrade inspection and certification==

Fairtrade inspection and certification are carried out by [[FLO-CERT]], an independent, for-profit body created by Fairtrade International. FLO-CERT certifies that both producers and traders have met with Fairtrade standards.FLO-CERT inspections and certification follow the international ISO standards for product certification bodies (ISO 65).&lt;ref name="flo-cert.net"&gt;[http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/35.html FLO-CERT Gmbh, (2011) Fee System Small Producer Organization - Explanatory Document. www.flo-cert.net, Retrieved January 3, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

FLO-CERT works with a network of around 100 independent inspectors that regularly visit producer and trade organizations and report back to FLO-CERT. All certification decisions are then taken by a Certification Committee, composed of stakeholders from producers, traders, national labelling organisations and external experts. An Appeals Committee handles all appeals.

In 2006, a ''[[Financial Times]]'' journalist found that ten out of the ten mills they visited had sold uncertified coffee to co-operatives as certified. It reported that they were "also handed evidence of at least one coffee association that received Fairtrade certification despite illegally growing some 20 per cent of its coffee in protected national forest land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weitzman|first1=Hal|title=The bitter cost of ‘fair trade’ coffee|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d191adbc-3f4d-11db-a37c-0000779e2340|accessdate=18 January 2018|work=An emerging criticism of Fairtrade within the industry is that the organisation misleads consumers about its ability to monitor production practices. FLO Cert, a body officially independent of FLO, monitors the certification process. Critics say there is a need for an outside auditor. “The way Fairtrade promotes itself is a little irresponsible,” says Mr Watts. “The certifiers need an external watchdog.”|agency=Financial Times|publisher=The Financial Times Ltd.|date=9 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification costs and returns==

Certified organizations such as cooperatives have to pay FLO-CERT a fee to become certified and a further annual fee for audit and continued certification&lt;ref name="flo-cert.net" /&gt; The first year certification fee per unit sold as "Fairtrade certified"  varies but has been over 6c/lb with an annual fee of 3c/lb to 3.4c/lb for coffee up to 2006 in some countries, at a time when the "Fairtrade premium" was 5c to 10c/lb.&lt;ref&gt;de Janvry, A., McIntosh, C., &amp; Sadoulet, E. (2010). Fair Trade and Free Entry:The Dissipation of Producer Benefits in a Disequilibrium Market. Retrieved December 24, 2012, from http://are.berkeley.edu/~alain/workingpapers.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairtrade farmers also have to meet a large range of criteria on production: there are limits on using child labour, pesticides, herbicides, genetically modified products and so on.&lt;ref name="GTS_EN.pdf p11" /&gt;

[[File:Friedrich Harkort 1793-1880.png|thumb|right|Friedrich Harkort in 1820]]
'''Friedrich Harkort''' (February 22, 1793, [[Hagen]] - March 6, 1880), known as the "Father of the [[Ruhr]]," was an early prominent German industrialist and pioneer of industrial development in the Ruhr region.&lt;ref name="faces1"&gt;(29 December 2009). [https://www.derwesten.de/kultur/friedrich-harkort-vorbild-und-vordenker-id2313221.html Friedrich Harkort - Vorbild und Vordenker], ''Derwesten.de'' (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1819, he founded the first industrial workshop at Castle [[Wetter (Ruhr)|Wetter]].  An early proponent of railroads, he proposed the construction of a railway line from [[Cologne]] to [[Minden]] in 1825, which eventuated as the [[Cologne-Minden trunk line]], completed in 1847. In 1826 he built a small test track, as a [[monorail]] following a design of the Englishman [[Henry Robinson Palmer]].

'''Good Deeds Day''' is an international day of [[volunteering]]. Beginning in 2007, its mission is to unite people from around the world in doing good deeds for others and the planet.

==Background==

This day of [[community service]] was launched in 2007 in [[Israel]] by businesswoman and [[philanthropist]], [[Shari Arison]], through [[Ruach Tova]], a [[Nonprofit organization]] that connects between people who want to volunteer and organizations in need of assistance.

Speaking about the day, initiator Shari Arison said: 
{{Quote|text= I believe that if people will think good, speak good and do good, the circles of goodness will grow in the world. Good Deeds Day has become the leading day of giving and this year individuals, school children, students, soldiers and employees from many businesses are joining in for the annual Good Deeds Day with the aim of doing a good deed for others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israel21c.org/900000-people-take-part-in-good-deeds-day/ 900,000 people take part in Good Deeds Day (Israel21c)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==

Approximately 7,000 people participated in Israel in 2007. The day became global in 2011, with participants from around the world, including in the USA, [[Ukraine]] and [[Poland]]. In 2012, project organizers teamed up with [[MTV]] Global for a six-week-campaign on its online and TV platforms, exposing the message to 24 million viewers around the world. In 2014, [[NASDAQ]] invited Shari Arison to kick off Good Deeds Day in the trading day closing bell ceremony. 2017 marked the fourth year in a row of the NASDAQ and Good Deeds Day collaboration.

Good Deeds Day 2018 will be on Sunday, April 15, 2018.

In 2017, the 11th annual Good Deeds Day, approximately 2,500,000 participants from 93 countries volunteered, marking it the largest and most global day yet. To celebrate, project organizers held mega events in Kenya, Portugal, Italy, Poland and more.

Good Deeds Day and Ruach Tova are part of The [https://web.archive.org/web/20130927194639/http://www.arison.co.il/AFFHome.aspx?Lang=2 Ted Arison Family Foundation], the philanthropic arm of the Arison Group.

==Around the world==

In 2011, international companies [http://en.shikunbinui.co.il/ Shikun &amp; Binui] and [[Bank Hapoalim]] were among the first international participants in Good Deeds Day outside of Israel. As of 2016, Good Deeds Day is celebrated in 75 countries worldwide, and has collaborated with major cities such as Rome, São Paulo, Kaohsiung City, and New York City to create special events. In the Good Deeds Day event at Herald Square, New York City, actor and activist [[Adrian Grenier]] supported the day by speaking at the event:
{{Quote|It’s important to have a day in which we acknowledge wonderful people who are dedicated to doing good.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtlwCohKXqY&amp;&amp;t=58s/ Adrian Grenier speaks in the 2016 Good Deeds Day Event at Herald Square, New York City (Youtube)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Pope Francis]] endorsed the day in his Sunday sermon prior to Good Deeds Day 2015 in Rome and said:
{{Quote|I send my wishes to the numerous groups of volunteers that have united to show solidarity by doing good deeds that promote a better society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shariarison.com/en/content/pope-honors-good-deeds-day/ Pope honors Good Deeds Day (Shari Arison)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2016 Good Deeds Day collaborated with [[Brazil]] based volunteering center Atados on a nationwide activation. Together they reached 10,000 volunteers around the country, and 40 cities across Brazil including major cities like [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brasília]], and [[São Paulo]].

In [[Latin America]], major Good Deeds Day events took place in Panama, Costa Rica, Brazil, Peru, and 16 other countries in the region.

In [[Taiwan]], Good Deeds Day collaborated with TAVE (Taiwan Association for Volunteer Effort) to create major citywide activities in [[Kaohsiung City]], Taiwan in 2016. Taiwan’s Vice President, [[Chen Chien-jen]], and Kaohsiung’s Mayor, [[Chen Chu]], were among the government officials honoring the day in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taiwanhot.net/?p=81289 (TaiwanHot, in Chinese)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taoyuan City]] also hosted citywide activities, arranged by Taoyuan City Volunteer Service Association and other partnering organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nownews.com/n/2016/05/05/2089169 (Now News, in Chinese)]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the biggest collaborations in [[Europe]] include SPES (Associazione Promozione e Solidarietà) in Italy, who organized a major Good Deeds Day event in Rome in 2016. Good Deeds Day invited runners in the [[Rome Marathon]] to join the “Roma Fun Run” and visit the Good Deeds Day fair of non-profits at the finish line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insiemeperilbenecomune.org/ (Insieme per il bene comune, in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Israel===

Good Deeds Day (Hebrew: יום מעשים טובים) first began in Israel in 2007 with 7,000 participants and grew to 1,500,000 in 2016. Local municipalities, companies, and nonprofit organizations all around the country participate by organizing special activities in their communities, renovating or painting buildings, building community gardens, and volunteering in many other ways for populations in need. Cities such as [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Jerusalem]] also host special Good Deeds Day events that are open to the public, such as the 2016 “Counselor’s Boulevard” that took place on [[Rothschild Boulevard]], Tel Aviv. Professionals gave free counseling sessions to passersby. Other public events include the 2015 Good Deeds Day nonprofit Fair at [[Rabin Square]], Tel Aviv, and [[Ashkelon]], which included hair donation stands, dog adoption area, and a give-and-take market.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19649">'''ISO 26262''', titled "Road vehicles – Functional safety",  is an international standard for [[functional safety]] of electrical and/or electronic systems in production automobiles defined by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) in 2011.

== Overview of Part 1==
Functional safety features form an integral part of each automotive product development phase, ranging from the specification, to design, implementation, integration, verification, validation, and production release. The standard ISO 26262 is an adaptation of the Functional Safety standard [[IEC 61508]] for Automotive Electric/Electronic Systems. ISO 26262 defines functional safety for automotive equipment applicable throughout the lifecycle of all automotive electronic and electrical safety-related systems.

The first edition, published on 11 November 2011, is intended to be applied to electrical and/or electronic systems installed in "series production passenger cars" with a maximum gross weight of 3500&amp;nbsp;kg. It aims to address possible hazards caused by the malfunctioning behaviour of electronic and electrical systems.

Although entitled "Road vehicles – Functional safety" the standard relates to the functional safety of Electrical and Electronic systems as well as that of systems as a whole or of their mechanical subsystems.

Like its parent standard, [[IEC 61508]], ISO 26262 is a risk-based safety standard, where the risk of hazardous operational situations is qualitatively assessed and safety measures are defined to avoid or control systematic failures and to detect or control random hardware failures, or mitigate their effects.

Goals of ISO 26262:
*Provides an automotive safety lifecycle (management, development, production, operation, service, [[wikt:decommission|decommissioning]]) and supports tailoring the necessary activities during these lifecycle phases.
* Covers functional safety aspects of the entire development process (including such activities as requirements specification, design, implementation, integration, verification, validation, and configuration).
*Provides an automotive-specific risk-based approach for determining risk classes ([[Automotive Safety Integrity Level]]s, ASILs).
*Uses ASILs for specifying the item's necessary safety requirements for achieving an acceptable residual risk.
*Provides requirements for validation and confirmation measures to ensure a sufficient and acceptable level of safety is being achieved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parasoft.com/jsp/products/article.jsp?articleId=3161  "ISO 26262 Software Compliance: Achieving Functional Safety in the Automotive Industry"] white paper by [[Parasoft]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parts of ISO 26262==

The standard consists of 9 normative parts and a guideline for the ISO 26262 as the 10th part.

The ten parts of ISO 26262:
# Vocabulary
# Management of functional safety
# Concept phase
# Product development at the system level
# Product development at the hardware level
# Product development at the software level
# Production and operation
# Supporting processes
# Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL)-oriented and safety-oriented analysis
# Guideline on ISO 26262

=== Part 1: Vocabulary ===
ISO 26262 specifies a vocabulary (a [[Project Glossary]]) of terms, definitions, and abbreviations for application in all parts of the standard.&lt;ref name="ISO26262Vocab"&gt;{{cite book | title =ISO 26262-1:2011(en)  Road vehicles — Functional safety — Part 1: Vocabulary | publisher =International Standardization Organization | url =https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:26262:-1:ed-1:v1:en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Of particular importance is the careful definition of ''fault'', ''error'', and ''failure'' as these terms are key to the standard’s definitions of functional safety processes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =ISO 26262-1:2011(en)  Road vehicles — Functional safety — Part 10: Guideline on ISO 26262 | publisher =International Standardization Organization | url =https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:26262:-1:ed-1:v1:en | pages= 5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in the consideration that "A ''fault'' can manifest itself as an ''error'' ... and the ''error'' can ultimately cause a ''failure''".&lt;ref name="ISO26262Vocab" /&gt;
{{glossary}}
{{term|Item}}
{{defn|Within this standard, ''item'' is a key term.  ''Item'' is used to refer to a specific system or array of systems that implements a function at the vehicle level to which the ISO 26262 [[#Safety Life Cycle|Safety Life Cycle]] is applied.  That is, the ''item'' is the highest identified object in the process and is thereby the starting point for product-specific safety development under this standard.}}
{{term|Element}}
{{defn|System or part of a system, including components, hardware, software, hardware parts, and software units -- effectively, anything in a system that can be distinctly identified and manipulated. }}
{{term|Fault}}
{{defn|Abnormal condition that can cause an ''element'' or an ''item'' to fail.}}
{{term|Error}}
{{defn|Discrepancy between a computed, observed or measured value or condition, and the true, specified or theoretically correct value or condition. }}
{{term|Failure}}
{{defn|Termination of the ability of an ''element'' to perform a function as required. }}
{{defn| ''Note: Since an element's specification defines its required function, the standard recognizes incorrect specification as a potential source of failure.''}}
{{term|Malfunctioning Behaviour}}
{{defn|''Failure'' or unintended behaviour of an ''item'' with respect to its design intent. }}
{{term|Hazard}}
{{defn|Potential source of harm caused by malfunctioning behaviour of the ''item''. }}
{{term|Functional Safety}}
{{defn|Absence of unreasonable risk due to ''hazards'' caused by malfunctioning behaviour of Electrical/Electronic systems. }}
{{glossary end}}
''Note: In contrast to the formal vocabularies defined for other Functional Safety standards, [[Fault Tolerance]] is not explicitly defined within this standard -- it is assumed impossible to comprehend all possible faults in a system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Greb |first1=Karl |last2=Seely |first2=Anthony |title=Design of Microcontrollers for Safety Critical Operation (ISO 26262 Key Differences from IEC 61508) |year=2009 |conference=ARMtechcon |url=http://www.ti.com/ww/en/mcu/tms570/downloads/Design_of_Microcontrollers_for_Safety.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906100246/http://www.ti.com/ww/en/mcu/tms570/downloads/Design_of_Microcontrollers_for_Safety.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Functional Safety'' rather than Fault Tolerance is the objective of the standard.  ISO 26262 does not use the ([[IEC 61508]]) terms SFF and hardware fault tolerance. The terms ''single point faults metric'' and ''latent faults metric'' are used instead.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=High-Availability Controller Concept for Steering Systems: The Degradable Safety Controller |first1=J. |last1=Boercsoek |first2=M. |last2=Schwarz |first3=E. |last3=Ugljesa |first4=P. |last4=Holub |first5=A. |last5=Hayek |url=http://www.wseas.us/e-library/conferences/2011/Tenerife/CSCC/CSCC-34.pdf |series=Recent Researches in Circuits, Systems, Communications and Computers |year=2011 |pages=222–228 |publisher=WSEAS |access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Part 2: Management of functional safety ===
ISO 26262 provides a standard for [[functional safety]] management for automotive applications, defining standards for overall organizational safety management as well as standards for a [[safety life cycle]] for the development and production of individual automotive products.&lt;ref&gt;ISO 26262-2:2011, "Management of functional safety" (Abstract)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Karl |last=Greb |title=Functional Safety and ISO 26262 |url=http://www.apec-conf.org/2013/images/PDF/2012/Industry_Sessions/is2.1.6.pdf |series=The Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition, Industry Sessions |year=2012 |page=9 |publisher=APEC}}{{dead link|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Criticality categories across safety standards in different domains |url=http://web1.see.asso.fr/erts2012/Site/0P2RUC89/1A-1.pdf |first1=Jean-Paul |last1=Blanquart |first2=Jean-Marc |last2=Astruc |first3=Philippe |last3=Baufreton |first4=Jean-Louis |last4=Boulanger |first5=Hervé |last5=Delseny |first6=Jean |last6=Gassino |first7=Gérard |last7=Ladier |first8=Emmanuel |last8=Ledinot |first9=Michel |last9=Leeman |first10=Joseph |last10=Machrouh |first11=Philippe |last11=Quéré |first12=Bertrand |last12=Ricque |series=ERTS2 Congress |year=2012 |pages=3–4 |publisher=Embedded Real Time Software and Systems |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417083732/http://web1.see.asso.fr/erts2012/Site/0P2RUC89/1A-1.pdf |archivedate=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ISO 26262-10:2012(E), "Guideline on ISO 26262", pp. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ISO 26262 safety life cycle described in the next section operates on the following safety management concepts:&lt;ref name="ISO26262Vocab" /&gt;{{glossary}}
{{term|Hazardous Event}}
{{defn|A ''hazardous event'' is a relevant combination of a vehicle-level ''hazard'' and an operational situation of the vehicle with potential to lead to an accident if not controlled by timely driver action.}}
{{term|Safety Goal}}
{{defn|A ''safety goal'' is a top-level safety requirement that is assigned to a system, with the purpose of reducing the risk of one or more ''hazardous events'' to a tolerable level.}}
{{term|Automotive Safety Integrity Level}}
{{defn|An ''Automotive Safety Integrity Level'' (ASIL) represents an automotive-specific risk-based classification of a ''safety goal'' as well as the validation and confirmation measures required by the standard to ensure accomplishment of that goal.}}
{{term|Safety Requirement}}
{{defn|''Safety requirements'' include all ''safety goals'' and all levels of requirements decomposed from the safety goals down to and including the lowest level of functional and technical safety requirements allocated to hardware and software components.}}
{{glossary end}}

=== Parts 3-7: Safety Life Cycle ===
Processes within the ISO 26262 ''safety life cycle'' identify and assess hazards (safety risks), establish specific safety requirements to reduce those risks to acceptable levels, and manage and track those safety requirements to produce reasonable assurance that they are accomplished in the delivered product.  These safety-relevant processes may be viewed as being integrated or running in parallel with a managed requirements life cycle of a conventional [[Quality management system|Quality Management System]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Min Koo Lee |author2=Sung-Hoon Hong |author3=Dong-Chun Kim |author4=Hyuck Moo Kwon |title=Incorporating ISO 26262 Development Process in DFSS |journal=Proceedings of the Asia Pacific Industrial Engineering &amp; Management Systems Conference |pages=1128 ( Figure 2) |year=2012 |url=http://www.apiems.net/conf2012/T2B2.pdf |accessdate=2013-08-01 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=Juergen Belz |title=The ISO 26262 Safety Lifecycle |date=2011-07-28 |url=http://www.mks.com/resources/data/multimedia/videos/video-clip-the-iso-26262-safety-lifecycle |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216000000/http://www.mks.com/resources/data/multimedia/videos/video-clip-the-iso-26262-safety-lifecycle |archivedate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An ''item'' (a particular automotive system product) is identified and its top level system functional requirements are defined. 
* A comprehensive set of ''hazardous events'' are identified for the ''item''.  
* An ''ASIL'' is assigned to each ''hazardous event''.
* A ''safety goal'' is determined for each ''hazardous event'', inheriting the ASIL of the hazard.
* A vehicle level ''functional safety concept'' defines a ''system architecture'' to ensure the ''safety goals''.
* ''Safety goals'' are refined into lower-level ''safety requirements''. 
: (In general, each safety requirement inherits the ASIL of its parent safety requirement/goal.  However, subject to constraints, the inherited ASIL may be lowered by decomposition of a requirement into redundant requirements implemented by sufficiently independent redundant components.)
* "Safety requirements" are allocated to ''architectural components'' (subsystems, hardware components, software components) 
: (In general, each component should be developed in compliance with standards and processes suggested/required for the highest ASIL of the safety requirements allocated to it.)
* The architectural components are then developed and validated in accord with the allocated safety (and functional) requirements.

{{See also|Automotive Safety Integrity Level#Comparison with Other Hazard Level Standards|label 1=Comparison of ASIL with Other Hazard Level Standards}}

''Automotive Safety Integrity Level'' refers to an abstract classification of inherent safety risk in an automotive system or elements of such a system. ASIL classifications are used within ISO 26262 to express the level of risk reduction required to prevent a specific hazard, with ASIL D representing the highest and ASIL A the lowest. The ASIL assessed for a given hazard is then assigned to the safety goal set to address that hazard and is then inherited by the safety requirements derived from that goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =Glossary, V2.5.0 | publisher =AUTOSAR | pages =19 | url =http://www.autosar.org/download/R4.1/AUTOSAR_TR_Glossary.pdf}}{{dead link|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====ASIL Assessment Overview====
The determination of ASIL is the result of ''hazard analysis and risk assessment''.&lt;ref name="ISO26262Part3"&gt;{{cite book | title =ISO 26262-3:2011(en)  Road vehicles — Functional safety — Part 3: Concept phase| publisher =International Standardization Organization | url =https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:26262:-3:ed-1:v1:en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the context of ISO 26262, a hazard is assessed based on the relative impact of hazardous effects related to a system, as adjusted for relative likelihoods of the hazard manifesting those effects.  That is, each hazardous event is assessed in terms of severity of possible injuries within the context of the relative amount of time a vehicle is exposed to the possibility of the hazard happening as well as the relative likelihood that a typical driver can act to prevent the injury.&lt;ref name="Hobbs"&gt;{{cite book | last =Hobbs | first =Chris | last2 =Lee | first2 =Patrick | title =Understanding ISO 26262 ASILs | publisher =Penton Electronics Group  | series =Embedded Technologies | date =2013-07-09 | url =http://electronicdesign.com/embedded/understanding-iso-26262-asils | magazine  =Electronic Design}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====ASIL Assessment Process====
At the beginning of the [[safety life cycle]], hazard analysis and risk assessment is performed, resulting in assessment of ASIL to all identified hazardous events and safety goals.

Each ''hazardous event'' is classified according to the ''severity'' (S) of ''injuries'' it can be expected to cause:
{{glossary}}
{{term|Severity Classifications (S):}}
{{defn|'''S0'''  No Injuries}}
{{defn|'''S1'''  Light to moderate injuries}}
{{defn|'''S2'''  Severe to life-threatening (survival probable) injuries}}
{{defn|'''S3'''  Life-threatening (survival uncertain) to fatal injuries}}
{{glossary end}}
[[Risk Management]] recognizes that consideration of the severity of a possible injury is modified by how likely the injury is to happen; that is, for a given hazard, a hazardous event is considered a lower risk if it is less likely to happen.  Within the ''hazard analysis and risk assessment'' process of this standard, the likelihood of an injurious hazard is further classified according to a combination of  
:''exposure'' (E) (the relative expected frequency of the operational conditions in which the injury can possibly happen) and 
:''control '' (C) (the relative likelihood that the driver can act to prevent the injury).
{{glossary}}
{{term|Exposure Classifications (E):}}
{{defn|'''E0'''  Incredibly unlikely}}
{{defn|'''E1'''  Very low probability (injury could happen only in rare operating conditions)}}
{{defn|'''E2'''  Low probability}}
{{defn|'''E3'''  Medium probability}}
{{defn|'''E4'''  High probability (injury could happen under most operating conditions)}}
{{term|Controllability Classifications (C):}}
{{defn|'''C0'''  Controllable in general}}
{{defn|'''C1'''  Simply controllable}}
{{defn|'''C2'''  Normally controllable (most drivers could act to prevent injury)}}
{{defn|'''C3'''  Difficult to control or uncontrollable}}
{{glossary end}}

In terms of these classifications, an "Automotive Safety Integrity Level D" hazardous event (abbreviated "ASIL D") is defined as an event having reasonable possibility of causing a life-threatening (survival uncertain) or fatal injury, with the injury being physically possible in most operating conditions, and with little chance the driver can do something to prevent the injury.  That is, ''ASIL D'' is the combination of S3, E4, and C3 classifications.  For each single reduction in any one classification from its maximum value (excluding reduction of C1 to C0), there is a single level reduction in the ASIL from ''D''.  [For example, a hypothetical uncontrollable (C3) fatal injury (S3) hazard could be classified as ASIL A if the hazard has a very low probability (E1).]  The ASIL level below ''A'' is the lowest level, ''QM''.  ''QM'' refers to the standard's consideration that below ASIL A, there is no safety relevance and only standard Quality Management processes are required.&lt;ref name="ISO26262Part3" /&gt;

These Severity, Exposure, and Control definitions are informative, not prescriptive, and effectively leave some room for subjective variation or discretion between various automakers and component suppliers.&lt;ref name="Hobbs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Dr. Qi |last=Van Eikema Hommes |title=Assessment of the ISO 26262 Standard, “Road Vehicles – Functional Safety” |url=http://www.sae.org/events/gim/presentations/2012/qi_volpe.pdf |series=SAE 2012 Government/Industry Meeting |place=John A.

'''''In Praise of Hard Industries''''' is a book about the economic impact of fewer [[manufacturing]] jobs in the [[United States]] written by Irish journalist and author [[Eamonn Fingleton]]. It was published in 1999. The book was reissued in a 2003 paperback edition under the title ''Unsustainable: How Economic Dogma Is Destroying American Prosperity''.

The book argues that the shift in the American work-force from industry to [[knowledge worker]]s was setting the country up for an economic collapse. It criticizes financial innovation as a ruse to sell complex [[financial instrument]]s and urged for more advanced manufacturing in the United States. The book argues that industrial activities create jobs and exports, and that job salaries would be protected in environments using high-end equipment.

In its first chapter, the book enunciates the “Three Strikes Against the New Economy”: a bad job mix, slow income growth. and a dearth of exports.

==Reception==
The book elicited strong and mixed responses.  Liberal economist [[James K. Galbraith]] said in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that Fingleton was “the sort of journalist economists despise,” arguing that the book was “anecdotal, spurning statistics or other corroboration” and that it overstated the decline of American manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 12, 1999|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/09/12/reviews/990912.12galbrat.html|title=Made in the U.S.A. A journalist looks at America's economic future and finds it is in manufacturing|first=James|last=Galbraith}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative economist [[George C. Leef]] commented that his snap judgment based on the cover was that it was “a lousy book” and that upon reading it, it “turned out to be far worse than I had guessed.”&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Freeman-2000aug-00055|first=George|last=Leef|title=Book Reviews|work=The Freeman/Ideas on Liberty|date=August 2000|pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Paul Craig Roberts]]&lt;ref name="counterpunch" /&gt; and activist Loren Goldner&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~lrgoldner/fingleton.html|first=Loren|last=Goldner|title=Presentation / Critique of Eamonn Fingleton, In Praise of Hard Industries: Why Manufacturing, Not the Information Economy, Is the Key to Future Prosperity (1999)|accessdate=November 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; both supported the book's message. Roberts viewed the book as substantially vindicated by the Wall Street [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008#US stock market|crash of 2007-2008]] as well as by the earlier [[dot.com bust]] of the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="counterpunch"&gt;Paul Craig Roberts, "How the Economy was Lost" ''Counterpunch'' Feb.  24, 2009 [http://www.counterpunch.org/2009/02/24/how-the-economy-was-lost/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PT. Indomarco Prismatama''' or '''Indomaret''' is a chain of retail [[convenience store]]s from [[Indonesia]], with over 11,000 stores &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.indomaret.co.id/korporat/tentang-indomaret/gerai-indomaret.html|title = Indomaret Official - Gerai Indomaret|date = |accessdate = November 19, 2015|website = Gerai Indomaret|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151119185255/http://www.indomaret.co.id/korporat/tentang-indomaret/gerai-indomaret.html|archivedate = November 19, 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; across Indonesia. It is the first and largest chain of this kind of store in Indonesia. Indomaret is a subsidiary of [[Salim Group]]. Its headquarter is in [[Jakarta]].

Indomaret is a minimarket network that provides daily needs. It has a store area of about 200m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The first official Indomaret store was opened in Ancol, North Jakarta in November 1988. By 2014, Indomaret had 10,600 outlets. 60% of the total outlets are self-owned and franchised outlets while the remaining 40% are company-owned, scattered in towns in Greater Jakarta, [[Sumatra]], [[Java]], [[Madura Island|Madura]], [[Bali]], [[Lombok]], [[Kalimantan]], and [[Sulawesi]]. In Jakarta, there are about 488 outlets.

Indomaret stores are easily found in residential areas, office buildings, and public facilities due to the placement location of outlets being based on the motto "simple and frugal" (Indonesian: ''mudah dan hemat''). Indomaret sells more than 5,000 types of food products and non-food items.

'''Jalan Jenderal Sudirman''' or ''' Jalan Sudirman''' ('''Sudirman Road''') is a major thoroughfare in [[Jakarta]] in [[Indonesia]]. The road runs from [[Patung Pemuda Membangun]] at the south end to the bridge of the [[Jakarta Flood Canal|West Flood Canal]] at the north. The road had been built between 1949 and 1953 to connect Central Jakarta with [[Kebayoran Baru]].{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=37}} The historically-prominent road is located in one of Jakarta's central business district area, marking the western side of [[Golden Triangle of Jakarta|Jakarta Golden Triangle]] and the eastern side of [[Jakarta Platinum Triangle]].

==Description==
Sudirman is one of Jakarta's most prominent main roads because of its location in the city's central business district. Sudirman Road was constructed in the late 1940s and was the foundation of the modern image of Jakarta. The road was named after a [[National Hero of Indonesia|National Hero]] [[Sudirman]], whose statue was erected near the north end of the road in September 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ariesaksono.wordpress.com/2008/05/28/patung-jenderal-sudirman-jakarta/ |title=Patung Jenderal Sudirman-Jakarta |author=Arue Saksono |date=May 28, 2008 |website=Arie Saksono - Saya Orang Indonesia |publisher=Wordpress |access-date=November 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109112030/https://ariesaksono.wordpress.com/2008/05/28/patung-jenderal-sudirman-jakarta/ |archive-date=November  9, 2016 |dead-url=no |quote= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire length of Sudirman Road marks the boundary of [[Central Jakarta]] (north of the road) and [[South Jakarta]] (south of the road).

Sudirman Road suffers from Jakarta's heavy traffic congestion. In June 2016, an [[Road space rationing|odd-even traffic scheme]] was implemented on Sudirman, replacing the [[High-occupancy vehicle lane|"Three-in-One"]] scheme which was introduced on December 23, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merdeka.com/jakarta/sejarah-pemberlakuan-3-in-1-di-jakarta.html |title=Sejarah Pemberlakuan 3-in-1 di Jakarta |author= |date=March 29, 2016 |website=Merdeka.com |publisher=KLN Kapanlagi Network |access-date=November 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109112934/https://www.merdeka.com/jakarta/sejarah-pemberlakuan-3-in-1-di-jakarta.html |archive-date=November  9, 2016 |dead-url=no |quote= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement was deemed necessary in order to eliminate the informal profession of [[car jockey]]s, which caused more problems than solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/04/end-of-the-road-jakartas-passengers-for-hire-targeted-by-carpooling-crackdown |title=End of the road: Jakarta's 'passengers for hire' targeted by carpooling crackdown |author= |date=November 9, 2016 |website=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |access-date=November 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109113400/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/04/end-of-the-road-jakartas-passengers-for-hire-targeted-by-carpooling-crackdown |archive-date=November  9, 2016 |dead-url=no |quote= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The odd-even license plate scheme is ti serve as a transitional regulation before an [[electronic road pricing]] system is implemented in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/07/25/ahok-expects-20-percent-fall-in-traffic-from-odd-even-policy.html |title=Ahok expects 20 percent fall in traffic from odd-even policy |author=Callistasia Anggun Wijaya |date=July 25, 2016 |website=The Jakarta Post |publisher=PT.

==History==

===Before Sudirman Road===
Sudirman Road and [[Jalan M.H. Thamrin|Thamrin Road]] were built between 1949 and 1953 with the purpose to connect the suburb [[Kebayoran Baru|Kebayoran]] with [[Central Jakarta]].{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=37}} The plan of Sudirman Road has been laid out at least since the colonial period in the 1930s as part of Batavia's street network expansion plan to the south of the [[Jakarta Flood Canal|west Flood Canal]]. The street planning that would become Sudirman Road is probably the only street planning south of the canal from the colonial period that was actually implemented after Indonesia's independence. The area where Sudirman Road would be laid were mainly kampung settlements, with rice plantation along the west bank of [[Krukut River]] and patches of coconut and fruit tree plantations.{{sfn|Herdruk Topografische Dienst Nederland|Koninklijk Instituut voor de Tropen|1930s}}

===1950s-1960s rural Sudirman Road===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Het aanleggen van de hoofdverkeersweg van Djakarta naar Kebajoran TMnr 60054772.jpg|thumb|left|Construction of the Sudirman road in 1950, then known simply as "road connection between Jakarta and Kebayoran".]]
With the development of the [[Kebayoran Baru|Kebayoran]] suburb to the south of Jakarta, there was a need to construct a road connecting the new suburb with the city center. Construction of the road started immediately in 1949 and was largely completed in 1953. This nameless road was dubbed ''Kebayoran Road'' or simply ''weg naar Kebayoran Baru'' (Dutch "the road to Kebayoran Baru"){{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=90}} The new road is rural in quality, lacking planned development on both side of the road. With the nationalization of road names in late 1950s, the road received a name Djalan Raja Djendral Sudirman (General Sudirman Main Road) after a [[Sudirman|National Hero]]. Some high-profile events were held in Sudirman Road e.g. the ''Pekan Raya'' or international trade and entertainment fairs, held between 1953-1955 on the site where [[Atma Jaya University]] now stands. The ''Pekan Raya'' event was the precursor of the [[Jakarta Fair]]s that was held at Medan Merdeka Selatan from 1968 to 1991, before it was relocated to an area of the converted [[Kemayoran Airport]] in 1992, where they are still held today.{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=39}}

Developments along Sudirman Road was relatively slow compared with the fast development of [[Jalan M.H. Thamrin|Thamrin Road]]. In the 1960s, the only apparent development along Sudirman Road were the residential neighborhood of Benhil and Setiabudi, which was mostly planned for government workers. These residential neighborhoods was designed with access to Sudirman Road. Other than these residential neighborhoods, Sudirman Road was devoid of any commercial developments.{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=27}} In 1963, the sports event [[GANEFO]] was held using the Sudirman Road as the main access to the new [[Gelora Bung Karno|stadium]].

===1970s-1980s construction boom===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Het centrum van Jakarta in de avonduren met kantoren en hotels TMnr 20018501.jpg|thumb|right|Sudirman Road in 1992.]]
Only during the 1970s that the Sudirman Road began to experience signs of development along the road, which first appeared north of [[Semanggi cloverleaf interchange|Semanggi]]. Among the first office buildings to be built at Sudirman Road were Wisma Arthaloka (1976), Toyota Astra, Wisma Harapan, Wisma Benhil, [[Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia|Atma Jaya University]], Wisma Metropolitan I, Hotel Sahid Jaya, [[Balai Sarbini|Balai Sarbini, and Gedung Veteran]] (Graha Purna Yudha, 1973). There was also a GKBI ''batik'' cooperatives building on the northwest corner of Semanggi; which would be replaced by Wisma GKBI office tower.{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=27}}

The late 1970s saw the construction of Gedung Panin, S. Widjoyo Center, and [[Ratu Plaza]] shopping complex.&lt;ref name="secuil2"/&gt;

The 1980s saw construction boom in Sudirman Road, among them were Prince Centre (Gedung Pangeran), Chase Plaza, Wisma Indocement, Wisma BCA, Summitmas Tower, Mid Plaza, Sentral Plaza, and Wisma Bumiputera.&lt;ref name="secuil2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://truelia.wordpress.com/2011/02/18/secuil-sejarah-pembangunan-jakarta-2/ |title=Secuil Sejarah Pembangunan Jakarta 2 |author=Amalia S. |date=February 18, 2011 |website=truelia.wordpress.com |publisher=Wordpress |dead-url=no |access-date=August 29, 2016 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829113759/https://truelia.wordpress.com/2011/02/18/secuil-sejarah-pembangunan-jakarta-2/ |archive-date=August 29, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present===
[[File:Sudirman Road 01.jpg|thumb|Sudirman Road in 2017]]
On December 23, 2003, a "3-in-1" scheme was introduced for Sudirman Road by Governor [[Sutiyoso]] to deal with the worsening traffic. In February 2004, the Corridor 1 of [[TransJakarta]] Bus Rapid Transit was commercially opened. The new line transformed one lane of the Sudirman Road into a dedicated bus lane unaffected by traffic.

[[Jakarta Mass Rapid Transit]] project which commenced in the end of 2013 would transform Sudirman Road following a transit-oriented scheme. MRT entrances will be constructed at the widened sidewalk, which was done by transforming the slow lane into wider sidewalk. To reduce the congestion, an [[electronic road pricing]] system will be introduced in 2017 to Sudirman Road.

'''James Armour Johnstone''' (25 June 1859&amp;ndash;8 May 1933) was a New Zealand businessman and stock breeder. He was born in [[Glasgow]], [[Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]] on 25 June 1859.&lt;ref name="DNZB Johnstone"&gt;{{DNZB|title=James Armour Johnstone|first= Janet C.|last= Angus|id=2j7|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnstone's father, David, was a [[Congregational church|Congregational]] minister. In 1868 he, his wife Jessie, and their four children moved to [[Dunedin]], New Zealand. After attending high school, James Johnstone joined the [[stock and station agency]] [[Wright Stephenson]] and worked his way uip through the business from office boy to stock agent, and by 1885 his business skills saw him made a partner in the business. In 1899 he became senior partner and became chairman of directors when the company was publicly listed in 1906.&lt;ref name="DNZB Johnstone"/&gt;

Johnstone married Margaret Donald in 1894, and together they had three daughters. They made their home at [[Maori Hill]] and owned farm property at Bushey Park near [[Palmerston, New Zealand|Palmerston]]. The family took frequent international trips, mainly for business reasons. During one of these trips Johnstone became aware of a demand in Argentina for [[Corriedale]] sheep, a breed which had been developed in New Zealand. As a result, in 1920 he purchased a large flock of the sheep and turned Bushey Park into a stud-stock breeding centre. He expanded the farm to include imported shorthorn cattle and a [[Clydesdale horse|Clydesdale]] stud.&lt;ref name="DNZB Johnstone"/&gt;

Both Johnstones had leadership roles in various agricultural and social organisations. James was the first president of the Clydesdale Horse Society of New Zealand and was also involved in the Royal Agricultural Society of New Zealand, the New Zealand Refrigerating Company and the Commercial Union Assurance Company. He also served as Dunedin's Argentine [[vice-consul]]. Margaret became president of the [[Plunket Society]].&lt;ref name="DNZB Johnstone"/&gt;

Johnstone suffered a bad fall from his horse in the early 1930s, which led to a decline in his health. He died at home on 8 May 1933. Margaret was to die later the same year.&lt;ref name="DNZB Johnstone"/&gt;

'''Japanese management culture''' refers to working philosophies or methods in Japan. It included concepts and philosophies such as [[Just-in-time manufacturing|Just in Time]], [[Kaizen]] and [[Total Quality Management]].
&lt;!--
== Japanese management studies in India ==
While Japanese management has always been a subject of great interest worldwide, particularly concepts and philosophies such as Just in Time, [[Kaizen]] and [[Total Quality Management]], in recent times there has been considerable interest in India for Japanese management. This is mainly due to the growing bi-lateral economic co-operation &lt;ref&gt;[http://wwno fqegc d in Japan. The popularity for Japanese management studies in India has grown due to the demand for skilled professionals who can deal effectively with Japanese companies in Japan or implement the management culture of the Japanese company in India. 

Currently, there is one full-time diploma program in Japanese Management&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/getahead/2008/aug/13iycu1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; offered by the RV-Nihongo Bashi Centre of Japanese Management Studies in Bangalore. The Institution is a joint venture between the RV Group of Institutions from Karnataka, India and Singapore-based Nihongo Bashi.One of the key features of this program is the emphasis on preparing students to the "Asian" / Japanese way of doing business, with considerable importance to the development of Emotional Quotient (EQ).--&gt;

==Managerial style==
The Japanese term "hourensou" (also rendered as “[[Ho-Ren-So]]”) refers to frequent reporting, touching base and discussing -- important attributes that are said to characterize collaboration and information flow within effective Japanese corporate culture. Hou’ stands for ‘Houkoku’, the Japanese word for ‘reporting’. ‘Ren’ comes from ‘Renraku’, the word for ‘informing’. ‘Sou’ is derived from ‘Soudan’, the word for ‘consulting’. refers to "getting your hands dirty", to identify or solve immediate problems and leaders are not exempt from this.&lt;ref name=Forest&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/blogs/japanese-versus-western-leadership/| title=JAPANESE CULTURE AND LEADERSHIP STYLE| accessdate=2 May 2017| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspects of these principles are often mistaken by western managers "micromanagement."&lt;ref name=Forest&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/blogs/japanese-versus-western-leadership/| title=JAPANESE CULTURE AND LEADERSHIP STYLE| accessdate=2 May 2017| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, these principles are used as tools to shepherd processes.

Mohammed Ala and William Cordeiro (1999) described the Japanese decision-making process of “ringiseido.” “Ringiseido” provides the opportunity for equal ranking managers or employees of a group within a company to partake in an individual’s idea. The process adheres to the Japanese cultural desire of harmony among people. The physical action of “ringiseido” is referred to as the “ringi decision-making process.” It fosters an environment of support and agreement for a decision once a higher ranking manager has reviewed and accepted the recommended decision.&lt;ref&gt;Ala, Mohammad; Cordeiro, William P., Can We Learn Management Techniques From the Japanese Ringi Process? ''Business Forum'' January 1, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The term of “ringi” has two meanings. The first meaning being of “rin," ‘submitting a proposal to one’s supervisors and receiving their approval,’ and "gi" meaning ‘deliberations and decisions.’ Corporate policy is not clearly defined by the executive leadership of a Japanese company. Rather, the managers at all levels below executives must raise decisions to the next level except for routine decisions. The process of “ringi decision-making” is conducted through a document called a “ringisho.”&lt;ref&gt;Ala, Mohammad; Cordeiro, William P., Can We Learn Management Techniques From the Japanese Ringi Process? ''Business Forum'' January 1, 1999 (p.&amp;nbsp;22-23).&lt;/ref&gt;

The “ringisho” is created and circulated by the individual who created the idea. As the “ringisho” reaches a peer for review, the peer places his or her “personal seal (hanko) right side up” to agree, “upside down” to disagree, and sideways to indicate being undecided. Once all peers have reviewed the “ringisho” the peers’ manager reviews the “ringisho” and places his or her hanko on it. The upper level manager’s decision is final and the “ringisho” is sent back to the originator who either initiates the idea or re-evaluates, based on the “hanko” of the upper level manager.&lt;ref&gt;Ala, Mohammad; Cordeiro, William P., Can We Learn Management Techniques From the Japanese Ringi Process? ''Business Forum'' January 1, 1999 (p.&amp;nbsp;22-23).&lt;/ref&gt;

Tony Kippenberger (2002) elaborates on the leadership values that are deeply rooted in the Japanese business culture. These values were created by [[Konosuke Matsushita]], the prominent deceased entrepreneur of Matsushita’s Electric Company, who cared deeply for the employees of his company as if they were family. Matsushita firmly believed that a business as large as his was responsible to help all of society prosper, and not simply for those that owned and ran the company to prosper. 

In 1933 Matsushita, during the great depression, created seven “guiding principles":&lt;ref&gt;*Kippenberger, T. (2002). ''[http://www.capstonepub.com/default.aspx Leadership styles]''. Oxford, United Kingdom: Capstone Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Service to the public – by providing high-quality goods and services at reasonable prices, we contribute to the public’s well-being;
*Fairness and honesty – we will be fair and honest in all our business dealings and personal conduct;
*Teamwork for the common cause – we will pool abilities, based on mutual trust and respect;
*Uniting effort for improvement – we will constantly strive to improve our corporate and personal performances;
*Courtesy and humility – we will always be cordial and modest and respect the rights and needs of others;
*Accordance with natural laws – we will abide by the laws of nature and adjust to the ever-changing conditions around us; and
*Gratitude for blessings – we will always be grateful for all the blessings and kindness we have received.”

The “guiding principles” were “remarkable for their time.” The seven principles are used by Matsushita’s company today and serve as principles for other Japanese companies. Because the “guiding principles” are such powerful statements and an extension of the Japanese cultural into business, the principles have been renamed  the “Seven Spirits of Matsushita" to honor Matsushita.&lt;ref&gt;*Kippenberger, T. (2002). ''[http://www.capstonepub.com/default.aspx Leadership styles]''. Oxford, United Kingdom: Capstone Publishing. p.71-72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smaller companies==
In smaller companies, an entirely different corporate culture developed. Similar to the ''Meister'' system of Germany, new recruits are placed under skilled senior specialists and spend years learning every technique that they have. They are trained to develop deeper understanding of specific areas of skills instead of the broader and less deep training that those in a larger corporation receive. They learn to produce work of high quality using few simple tools and few or no advanced industrial tools.

==Japanese women in management==
As the modern cultures of the world continue to advance, cultural concepts either lose presence or evolve with the modern concepts. Japan is experiencing such an evolution in regard to women in the workplace and in management roles. While a main reason for this evolution is the adoption of western influence on Japanese society, Japan is being forced to support this evolution because it is grappling with a declining population and lower birth rate which will lead to a smaller workforce. 

According to “Cloud, or Silver Linings?” published in the ''Economist'' (2007), it was reported that in 2006 Japan’s birth rate was 1.32 and has been below 2.1 since the 1970s. A birthrate of 2.1 is necessary to successfully maintain current population numbers. The article described that the OECD has proven there is a “positive correlation between fertility and female employment.” Thus, if an effort is made to support females work ambitions and family desires, then women will be more willing and likely to want to have children and families and not have to sacrifice their career in the process. Japanese officials are not taking this information lightly. During his last year in office, Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]] (2002-2007) began legislation to foster “financial support for families with young children and an expansion of child-care facilities (p.27).&lt;ref&gt;Cloud or silver linings? Japan’s changing demography. (2007 July 28). ''The Economist'' 384(8539) p.27. http://www.economist.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

The language used in the title can be misleading, as pointed by historian Abel Sierra Madero, "The hybrid structure of work camps cum military units served to camouflage the true objectives of the recruitment effort and to distance the UMAPs from the legacy of forced labor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sierra Madero|first1=Abel|title=Academies To Produce Macho-Men In Cuba|url=https://translatingcuba.com/academies-to-produce-macho-men-in-cuba-abel-sierra-madero/|website=Translating Cuba|publisher=Translating Cuba|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;The majority of UMAP servicemen were conscientious objectors. A small portion or about 8% to 9% of the inmates were [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] men, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|Catholic priests]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant ministers]], intellectuals, farmers who resisted [[collectivization]], as well as anyone else considered "anti-social" or "counter-revolutionary".&lt;ref name="Guerra"/&gt; Former [[Intelligence Directorate]] agent [[Norberto Fuentes]] estimated that of approximately 35,000 internees, 507 ended up in psychiatric wards, 72 died from torture, and 180 committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Fuentes, Norberto. Dulces Guerreros Cubanos. Barcelona: 1999. 300-303. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1967 human rights report from the [[Organization of American States]] found that over 30,000 internees are "forced to work for free in state farms from 10 to 12 hours a day, from sunrise to sunset, seven days per week, poor alimentation with rice and spoiled food, unhealthy water, unclean plates, congested barracks, no electricity, latrines, no showers, inmates are given the same treatment as political prisoners."&lt;ref name="cidh"&gt;http://www.cidh.org/countryrep/cuba67sp/cap.1a.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; The report concludes that the UMAP camps’ two objectives are "facilitating free labor for the state" and "punishing young people who refuse to join communist organizations."&lt;ref name="cidh"/&gt; The Cuban government maintained that the UMAPs are not labor camps, but part of military service.&lt;ref name="cidh"/&gt; In a 2010 interview with ''La Jornada'', [[Fidel Castro]] admitted in response to a question about the UMAP camps that "Yes, there were moments of great injustice, great injustice!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2010/08/31/mundo/026e1mun|title=La Jornada: Soy el responsable de la persecución a homosexuales que hubo en Cuba: Fidel Castro|last=C.V|first=DEMOS, Desarrollo de Medios, S. A. de|website=La Jornada|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically the Cuban government has presented UMAPs as a mistake, but according to Abel Sierra Madero, this institution has to be understood as part of a project of “social engineering” tailored for political and social control. Sophisticated methodologies were deployed that incorporated judicial, military, educational, medical and psychiatric apparatuses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sierra Madero|first1=Abel|title="El trabajo os hará hombres”: Masculinización nacional, trabajo forzado y control social en Cuba durante los años sesenta.|journal=Cuban Studies|date=2016|volume=44|page=309-349|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/613550|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Origins==
It is rumored that the UMAP camps were initially proposed by [[Fidel Castro]] and implemented by [[Raúl Castro]] after a state visit to the Soviet Union and Bulgaria, where he learned that the Soviets ran camps for "anti-socials".&lt;ref name="Almendros"&gt;Almendros, Néstor, dir. Improper Conduct. 1984. Film.&lt;/ref&gt; According to an April 14, 1966 article in ''[[Granma (newspaper)|Granma]]'', the official state newspaper, the UMAP camps were proposed at a November 1965 meeting between Fidel Castro and military leaders.&lt;ref name="Ros_155"&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both were concerned over how to handle "misplaced elements".&lt;ref name="Ros_155"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"Quedaba por ver el caso de una serie de elementos desubicados, vagos, que ni trabajaban, ni estudiaban. ¿Qué hacer con ellos? La cuestión era tema de preocupación para los dirigentes de la Revolución.''
''Un día del mes de noviembre del pasado año (1965) un grupo de oficiales se encontraban reunidos en el Estado Mayor General y discutían estas cuestiones. Hablaban con Fidel, el cual compartía esas mismas preocupaciones y le propusieron la creación de la UMAP."''&lt;ref name="Ros_155"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 

"Still left to consider was the case of misplaced elements, deadbeats, those who neither studied nor worked. What can be done with these people? This question was the worrying concern for the leaders of the Revolution.
One day in November of last year, 1965, a group of military officials met to discuss these questions. They spoke with Fidel, who shared these concerns and proposed to him the creation of the UMAP."''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- ==Operations==
The main ''recogidas'' ("round ups") of UMAP internees occurred in November 1965 and June 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another large ''recogida'' occurred after an airplane engineer for Cubana Airlines attempted to hijack an airplane in March 1966, which resulted in the firing of many airline employees and their sentencing to UMAP camps even without any connection to the hijacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|pp=140–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most common ways that individuals were taken to UMAP camps was through a false notice to appear for military service, which became obligatory with the establishment of the draft on November 12, 1963 through ''Ley 1129''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|pp=13, 52, 79, 94, 101, 141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals would receive a telegram with a notice to appear at a given location for SMO ("Servicio Militar Obligatorio," ''Obligatory Military Service''). Instead of being taken to an actual military camp to receive training for the army, they would be transported by train, truck, or bus to agricultural UMAP labor camps which were located in Camagüey, the former province on the eastern side of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions on the up to 8 hour trip across the island were poor, with internees provided little clean water, food, or facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|pp=20, 75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Almendros"/&gt;

Many interviewees in the documentary [[Improper Conduct]] report that police directly rounded up people off the streets into buses to be taken to UMAP camps. This method of selection into UMAP camps appears to have been more common for effeminate gay men and "anti-socials" such as "hippies."&lt;ref name="Almendros"/&gt;

UMAP camps typically held 120 internees, split up into squads of ten.&lt;ref name="Ros_34"&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each UMAP camp typically consisted of three barracks, two for internees and one for military personnel.&lt;ref name="Ros_34"/&gt; Camps had no running water or electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internees at the UMAP camps received no military training and were given no arms.&lt;ref name="Ros_34"/&gt; Their uniform was blue pants, a denim shirt, and boots.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The labor the internees performed consisted of a variety of agricultural tasks, from tearing down the [[marabou (weed)|marabou]] plant to picking fruit, but they mostly engaged in the cutting of sugar cane.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|pp=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bejel_100"&gt;{{harvp|Bejel|2001|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the military personnel who ran the camps were illiterate or semi-illiterate soldiers.&lt;ref name="Ros_45_46"&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|pp=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cuban government assigned these undereducated soldiers to UMAP camps because they were trying to professionalize the Cuban military.&lt;ref name="Ros_45_46"/&gt;

Every squad of ten was led by a ''cabo'' ("corporal") who was one of the inmates.&lt;ref name="Ros_161_163"&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|pp=161, 163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''cabo'' was in charge of tasks such as showing their squad where to work, but still wore the same uniform as other internees and still had to perform agricultural labor.&lt;ref name="Ros_161_163"/&gt;

Each camp also had an accountant who was chosen from amongst the inmates.&lt;ref name="Ros_165"&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accountant was in charge of keeping track of the amount of work each internee completed.&lt;ref name="Ros_165"/&gt;

Lastly, each camp had a ''suministro'', also an internee, who was in charge of bringing food rations from a central military barrack back to their respective UMAP camp, where the ''suministro'' would distribute food amongst fellow internees.&lt;ref name="Ros_166_168"&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|pp=166–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''suministro'' would have to carefully allocate the food amongst internees or else they would run out of food before the end of the month.&lt;ref name="Ros_166_168"/&gt; Former ''suministros'' from UMAP camps report that military officials did not provide enough food so that they could take the remaining foodstuffs back home or sell them to people in the countryside (''guajiros'').&lt;ref name="Ros_166_168"/&gt;

Internees were divided by category, into camps for gay men and camps for everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|pp=55, 87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The internees were often divided by category (Jehovah’s Witnesses, gay men, Catholics, etc.) en route to the camps and also at the camps themselves, where homosexuals and effeminate men would often be selected from one camp to another especially for homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|pp=55, 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are many reports of physical abuse at the camps, especially directed towards Jehovah’s Witnesses. Among the many forms of abuse, former internees report Jehovah’s Witnesses being beaten, threatened with execution, stuffed with dirt in their mouths, buried in the ground until their neck, and tied up naked outside in barbed wire without food or water until fainting.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|pp=80, 101, 112, 193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emilio Bejel, author of ''Gay Cuban Nation'', wrote that some of the officials who ran the camps were executed due to how badly they mistreated the inmates.&lt;ref name="Bejel_100"/&gt; Nevertheless, the state-run ''Granma'' newspaper reported: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"When the first groups, which were nothing good, began to arrive, some officers didn't have either the necessary patience or the required experience and lost their temper. For these reasons, some officers were submitted to a court-martial. In some cases they were demoted and, in other ones [cases] they were expelled from the Armed Forces (''Granma'', April 14, 1966).&lt;ref&gt;Zayas, Manuel. Mapa de la homofobia. http://manuelzayas.wordpress.com/mapa-de-la-homofobia/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Some internees mutilated themselves so they could be transferred from the camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|pp=205–208}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
===Third-party testimony of UMAP camps===
Paul Kidd, a Canadian foreign news correspondent, provides the only known first-hand, third party account of the UMAP camps. Kidd traveled to Cuba on August 29, 1966 to write for Southam News Service.&lt;ref name="Edmonton"&gt;Kidd, Paul. ""Cuba Expels Reporter"." Edmonton Journal 10 09 1966, Print.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 8, the Cuban foreign ministry asked him to leave "by the first flight" because he took photographs of anti-aircraft guns visible from his hotel room window and exhibited an incorrect attitude toward the revolution in an article he had published earlier.&lt;ref name="Edmonton"/&gt;

During this trip, Kidd departed Havana and wandered through the rural, former province of Camaguey where he encountered a UMAP labor camp near the hamlet of El Dos de Cespedes.&lt;ref name="Kidd"&gt;Kidd, Paul. "The Price of Achievement Under Castro". Saturday Review. 03 1969: 23-25. Web. &lt;http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1969may03-00023&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The barbed-wire enclosed camp was run by 10 security guards and held 120 internees, consisting of Jehovah's Witnesses, Roman Catholics, and "those loosely termed 'social misfits' by the government".&lt;ref name="Kidd"/&gt; The ages of the inmates ranged from 16 years old to over 60.&lt;ref name="Kidd"/&gt; None of the internees were given arms; all weapons at the camp were under the control of the ten guards running the camp.&lt;ref name="Kidd"/&gt;

The internees worked an average of 60 hours a week for a monthly income of 7 pesos (roughly worth a meal) and their internment typically lasted for at least six months.&lt;ref name="Kidd"/&gt; Cubans who served in the standard SMO ("Servicio Militar Obligatorio", ''Obligatory Military Service'') received the same monthly wage of 7 pesos a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As long as their agricultural quotas were met, most internees at the camp were allowed a break to visit family after six months of internment.&lt;ref name="Kidd"/&gt; Family members were allowed to visit internees at the camp on the second Sunday of each month and could bring personal items such as cigarettes to internees.&lt;ref name="Kidd"/&gt;

Internees at the camp Kidd discovered were housed in two long, white concrete buildings with no windows just the hole in the wall which had bunk beds with sacks slung between wooden beams for mattresses. After agricultural work was complete, internees were instructed in communist ideology for two hours every night.&lt;ref name="Kidd"/&gt;

Kidd estimated that about 200 such camps existed and in total housed about 30,000 people.&lt;ref name="Kidd"/&gt;

==Conferences==
Izurieta has given numerous conferences on trade and agriculture of which those at Cornell, Ithaca, NY (2000), Agritrade in Guatemala (1991) and University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona (1969) stand out.

==Legal disputes==
In November 2004 the Ecuadorian prosecutor for crimes against the environment and heritage demanded preventive jail-time against Izurieta. Charges concerned the illegal commercialization of several types of flowers. The patents relating to the flowers were in hands of the company [[Ecuador Roses]]. Izurieta responded to the charges by saying that they were made in bad faith and with the intent to harm him.&lt;ref name=charges&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.eluniverso.com/2004/11/19/0001/8/435EC85F3DA848C68F8DE72518ACF240.html |title=Fiscal Luis Enríquez pidió prisión contra Patricio Izurieta |language=Spanish |publisher=[[El Universo]] |date=19 November 2004 |accessdate=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The plaintiff was unable to prove the allegations, preventive jail-time was never enforced, and Izurieta was completely cleared of all charges.  Izurieta declined to counter-sue Ecuador Roses under article 494 of the Penal Code which protects citizens from malicious and reckless lawsuits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4566">'''Philip "Phil" Flynn''' (born 1940 in [[Dundalk]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]) is an Irish businessman. He was previously a vice-president of [[Sinn Féin]], a trade unionist, an industrial relations consultant, a government advisor and a financier. He was the eldest of five children of a nationalist mother and [[Fine Gael]] father.

He joined Sinn Féin at the age of 14 and lent support to some of those involved in the [[Border Campaign (IRA)|IRA Border campaign]] of the 1950s. He was taken in for police questioning on a number of occasions owing to his political activities. In 1974, he was tried with IRA membership, but acquitted, by the [[Special Criminal Court]]. During the trial, the state alleged that he was [[IRA Director of Finance]]. In [[Liverpool]], he was arrested and held for three days under the [[Prevention of Terrorism Acts|Prevention of Terrorism Act]]. In 1975, he came to public prominence when he acted as a mediator in the [[Tiede Herrema]] kidnap siege.

In 1984, he was elected general secretary of the [[Local Government and Public Services Union]]. His election caused problems for the Fine Gael-Labour administration as Flynn was also vice-president of Sinn Féin and as such, government officials and ministers refused to talk to him. Shortly after, he was elected to the executive of the [[Irish Congress of Trade Unions]] (ICTU). In the same year, he stepped down as Sinn Féin vice-president, telling the party's [[Ard fheis]] that his experience and support would always be available to the movement. 

In 1987, he was reported to have resigned from Sinn Féin. From 1993 to 1995, he was president of ICTU, representing the [[Irish Municipal Public and Civil Trade Union]]. In 1996, he was appointed chairman of the Industrial Credit Corporation (ICC) by [[Ruairi Quinn]]. ICC was subsequently acquired by the [[Bank of Scotland]] in 2001.

In February 2005, Flynn's office was raided by officers of the [[Criminal Assets Bureau]] (CAB) as part of an investigation into alleged IRA [[money-laundering]]. Flynn was a non-executive directors Chesterton Finance Company Ltd, a company at the centre of the CAB investigation. As a result, he resigned as chairman of the Irish Government committee on decentralisation, as non-executive chairman of [[Bank of Scotland (Ireland)]] and as director of the [[VHI]]. During the search of his officers, Flynn was found to be the illegal possession of a [[pen gun]] and mini [[tear gas]] canisters. At related court hearing In December 2005, he admitted to possession and agreed to pay €5,000 to a charity.

Ted Cunningham, the [[Cork (city)|Cork]] based financial adviser convicted of [[money laundering|laundering]] £3 million of the sum stolen by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] in the 2004 [[Northern Bank robbery]] stated "Phil Flynn is the boss behind everything" in a garda interview about the robbery introduced in evidence in Cunningham's trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Flynn ‘elephant in room’ during trial | author = Liam Heylin | url = http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/idqlsneygb/ | publisher = [[Irish Examiner]] | date = 28 March 2009 | accessdate = 2009-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Off tape admissions told the real story | author = Liam Heylin | url = http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/idqlsneymh/ | publisher = [[Irish Examiner]] | date = 28 March 2009 | accessdate = 2009-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poyiadjis worked for [[Morgan Stanley]] Co. and [[Lehman Brothers]] International Ltd between 1993 and 1996 in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg" /&gt; He later formed a merchant bank called [[Alpha Capital]], which focused on funding technology companies.&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg" /&gt;

According to ''[[Forbes magazine|Forbes]]'' magazine, in 1997 Poyiadjis met [[Lycourgos Kyprianou]], a fellow Greek Cypriot with a software company called AremisSoft.  Poyiadjis invested $7 million in AremisSoft in October 1997 and helped Kyprianou secure another $12 million of financing in March 1998.  The company went public on Nasdaq in April 1999.  Poyiadjis, became president and vice-chairman in 1998, and became CEO in 2000 (Kyprianou became chairman and chief technology officer).  By August 2000, Poyiadjis and Kyprianou owned about 30% of the company, and in Feb. 2001, they became co-chief executive officers.&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt; [[Irwin L.

In 2014, Poyiadjis and [[Martua Sitorus]], the co-founder of [[Wilmar International]] formed a partnership to create the largest biofuel power plant in Japan. The plant’s 20 year feed-in tariff is valued at $1.5 billion US dollars. In 2012, Poyiadjis began a venture to build the first independent power producer on the Island of Cyprus but due to the Greek and Cypriot economic crisis the project changed course resulting in a biofuel power plant in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Von Mayer, Wintress.

Roys Poyiadjis, along with an art historian and another Cypriot businessman, were responsible for the repatriation of the mosaic of St. Andrew in 2018. The mosaic was a work of art stolen from the church of [[Lythrangomi#Panagia Kanakaria|Panagia Kanakaria]] in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cyprus-mail.com/2018/04/23/one-last-two-pieces-looted-kanakaria-mosaics-back-cyprus/|title=Ceremony to greet return of priceless looted Kanakaria mosaic - Cyprus Mail|date=2018-04-23|work=Cyprus Mail|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/cyprusliving/docs/cy_living_june_18_web/14|title=Cyprus Living Magazine June 2018|work=Issuu|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018 Poyiadjis submitted an investment offer to acquire the [[AC Omonia|Omonia FC]].

==Securities and Exchange Commission settlement==
In May 2001, the United States [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) began to investigate AremisSoft after a [[New York Times]] article suggested that the company overstated the value of a contract to automate the National Healthcare Service in Bulgaria.&lt;ref name="Berenson"&gt;Berenson, Alex. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/17/business/the-markets-market-place-wall-street-s-new-interest-in-bulgaria.html?scp=6&amp;sq=roys+poyiadjis&amp;st=nyt The Markets: Marketplace; Wall Street’s New Interest in Bulgaria]." The New York Times. 17 May 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  On 4 October 2001, the SEC filed a civil enforcement action against AremisSoft.  On 19 December 2001, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York filed an indictment charging Poyiadjis and Kyprianou with securities fraud in connection with AremisSoft. The funds under question were in bank accounts on the [[Isle of Man]].&lt;ref name="Exhibits to Sentencing D"&gt;Crim No. 01-CR-01177 (LTS). Exhibits to Sentencing Memo. Exhibit D. Accessed via [https://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/login.pl PACER]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Poyiadjis and Kyprianou were in Cyprus at the time of the indictment.  In 2005, Poyiadjis voluntarily returned to the United States to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit security fraud.&lt;ref name="Memorandum in Aid of Sentencing"&gt;Crim No. 01-CR-01177 (LTS).

The case reached a global settlement when Poyiadjis agreed to pay $200 million.&lt;ref name="Court transcript"&gt;Crim No. 01-CR-01177 (LTS). [http://www.sentencingtranscripts.com/ny/p/Poyiadjis_Roys_20100722.pdf  Court transcript]&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Lawyer Magazine'', this is the largest SEC case of its kind.&lt;ref name="Malkin"&gt;Malkin, Brendan. "[http://www.thelawyer.com/isle-of-man-hosts-largest-ever-sec-fraud-case/98844.article Isle of Man Hosts Largest Ever SEC Fraud Case]." The Lawyer. 9 June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, Poyiadjis was sentenced by Judge [[Laura Taylor Swain]] to three years of probation. At Poyiadjis's sentencing, Judge Swain stated that she took into consideration "the extent of Mr. Poyiadjis's cooperation," and "Mr. Poyiadjis's remorse, as reflected both in his words and actions."&lt;ref name="Court transcript" /&gt; [[Lycourgos Kyprianou]] remains a fugitive from justice in the United States.&lt;ref name="Court transcript" /&gt;

The case was described in the book ''Selling America Short'', by Richard C.

{{The Salvation Army}}
'''Samuel Booth''' (1775–1842), the father of [[William Booth]], was born in [[Belper]], [[Amber Valley]], [[Derbyshire]], [[England]].  He was tall and often wore clothes that made him look like a [[Quaker]]; knee-breeches, drab-cloth suits, and cut-away coats.  He married [[Sarah Lockitt]] in 1797.  At that time, he was a nail-maker.  The [[industrial revolution]] made his job redundant, therefore he tried to set up some building companies and became an architect.  This provided him with sufficient funds to buy a house at [[Colston Bassett]].  Samuel and Sarah had a son named William, but he was not the William Booth who founded [[The Salvation Army]].  Sarah died in 1819 and William died five years later.

When Samuel Booth went to [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]] to drink the water in hopes that it would cure his rheumatism, he met [[Mary Moss]].  He proposed, but she declined.  He soon renewed his proposal and pursued her until she agreed, although he was sixteen years her senior.  They married and had five children: Henry, Ann, William, Emma, and Mary.  Henry died at the age of three.  This William became the founder of The Salvation Army.  Emma was an invalid from birth and she died without ever marrying at the age of forty.  Mary eventually became Mary Newell, and she lived until she was 69.

As Samuel was forced into bankruptcy by successive trade recessions, he moved to [[Nottingham]].  William was eventually to say of him:

:"My father was a Grab, a Get. He had been born in poverty. He determined to grow rich; and he did. He grew very rich, because he lived without God and simply worked for money; and when he lost it all, his heart broke with it, and he died miserably."

Samuel Booth was not a religious man, and although he had little interest in his children, he insisted that they attend church regularly.

Samuel began to lose more money and he was forced to move into a house on [[Sneinton]] Road in a poorer neighbourhood, but he eventually moved back to Nottingham.  It was there that he died.  He was baptised on his deathbed, after which he committed his wife and children to God.  Those who surrounded him, including his son William, sang ''[[Rock of Ages (Christian hymn)|Rock of Ages]]'' as he died.

'''Search analytics''' is the use of search data to investigate particular interactions among Web searchers, the [[search engine]], or the content during searching episodes.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, B. J. 2006. [https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/jjansen/academic/pubs/jansen_search_log_analysis.pdf Search log analysis: What is it; what's been done; how to do it]. Library and Information Science Research, 28(3), 407-432.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting analysis and aggregation of search engine statistics can be used in [[search engine marketing]] (SEM) and [[search engine optimization]] (SEO). In other words, search analytics helps website owners understand and improve their performance on search engines, for example identifying highly valuable site visitors,&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz-Cordova, A. and Jansen, B.

==Data collection==
Search analytics data can be collected in several ways. Search engines provide access to their own data with services such as Google Analytics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/|title=Analytics Tools &amp; Solutions for Your Business - Google Analytics|website=marketingplatform.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google Trends and Google Insights. Third party services must collect their data from [[ISP]]'s, [[phoning home]] software, or from [[web scraping|scraping]] search engines. Getting traffic statistics from ISP's and phone homes provides for broader reporting of [[web traffic]] in addition to search analytics. Services that perform keyword monitoring only scrape a limited set of search results depending on their clients' needs. Services providing reverse search however, must scrape a large set of keywords from the search engines, usually in the millions, to find the keywords that everyone is using.

Since search results, especially advertisements, differ depending on where you are searching from, data collection methods have to account for geographic location. Keyword monitors do this more easily since they typically know what location their client is targeting. However, to get an exhaustive reverse search, several locations need to be scraped for the same keyword.

==Accuracy==
Search analytics accuracy depends on service being used, data collection method, and data freshness. Google releases its own data, but only in an aggregated way and often without assigning absolute values such as number of visitors to its graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/intl/en/trends/about.html |title=About Google Trends&amp;nbsp;– Google Trends |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[internet service provider|ISP]] logs and phone home methods are accurate for the population they sample, so sample size and [[demographics]] must be adequate to accurately represent the larger population. Scraping results can be highly accurate, especially when looking at the non-paid, [[organic search|organic]] search results. Paid results, from [[Google Adwords]] for example, are often different for the same search depending on the time, geographic location, and history of searches from a particular computer. This means that scraping advertisers can be hit or miss.

==Market conditions==
Taking a look at Google Insights to gauge the popularity of these services shows that compared to searches for the term [[Adwords]] (Google's popular search ad system), use of search analytics services is still very low, around 1-25% as of Oct. 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/insights/search/#q=adwords%2Cgoogle%20trends%2Cspyfu%2Ckeyword%20spy%2Cgoogle%20insights&amp;cmpt=q |title=Google Trends |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could point to a large opportunity for the users and makers of search analytics given that services have existed since 2004 with several new services being started since.

==Calculations==
:Sessions with Search = The number of sessions that used your site's search function at least once.
:Percentage of sessions that used internal search = Sessions with Search / Total Sessions.
:Total Unique Searches = The total number of times your site search was used. This excludes multiple searches on the same keyword during the same session.
:Results Pageviews / Search = Pageviews of search result pages / Total Unique Searches.
:Search Exits = The number of searches made immediately before leaving the site.
:Percentage of Search Exits = Search Exits / Total Unique Searches
:Search Refinements = The number of times a user searched again immediately after performing a search.
:Percentage Search Refinements = The percentage of searches that resulted in a search refinement. Calculated as Search Refinements / Pageviews of search result pages.
:Time after Search = The amount of time users spend on your site after performing a search. This is calculated as Sum of all search_duration across all searches / (search_transitions + 1)
:Search Depth = The number of pages viewed after performing a search. This is calculated as Sum of all search_depth across all searches / (search_transitions + 1) &lt;ref&gt;https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1032321?hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seigniorage''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|eɪ|n|j|ər|ɪ|dʒ}}, also spelled '''seignorage''' or '''seigneurage''' (from [[Old French]] ''seigneuriage'' "right of the lord (''seigneur'') to mint money"), is the difference between the value of money and the cost to produce and distribute it. The term can be applied in the following ways:

* Seigniorage derived from specie—metal [[coin]]s—is a [[tax]], added to the total price of a coin (metal content and production costs), that a customer of the [[mint (coin)|mint]] had to pay to the mint, and that was sent to the sovereign of the political area.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/QR/QR2142.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Seigniorage derived from notes is more indirect, being the difference between interest earned on [[security (finance)|securities]] acquired in exchange for bank notes and the costs of producing and distributing those notes.&lt;ref name=bank-of-canada-backgrounder&gt;{{cite web|last=Bank of Canada|title=Backgrounders: Seigniorage|url=http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/seigniorage.pdf|accessdate=2 January 2013|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term also applies to monetary seignorage, where sovereign-issued securities [[Monetization#Monetizing debt|are exchanged]] for newly minted bank notes by a central bank, thus allowing the sovereign to 'borrow' without needing to repay.&lt;ref name=fred-seignorage&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neumann|first1=Manfred J.M.|title=Seigniorage in the United How Much Does the U.S. Government Make from Money Production?|url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/92/03/Seigniorage_Mar_Apr1992.pdf|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis|accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, monetary seignorage refers to the sovereign revenue obtained through routine [[Monetization#Monetizing debt|debt monetization]], including expanding the [[money supply]] during GDP growth and meeting yearly inflation targets.&lt;ref name=fred-seignorage/&gt;

Seigniorage is a convenient source of revenue for some governments. By providing the government with increased purchasing power at the expense of the public's purchasing power, it imposes what is metaphorically known as an '''inflation tax''' on the public.

==Examples==

===Scenario A===
A person has one ounce of gold, trades it for a government-issued gold certificate (providing for redemption in one ounce of gold), keeps that certificate for a year, and then redeems it in gold.  That person ends up with exactly one ounce of gold again. No seigniorage occurs.

===Scenario B===
Instead of issuing gold certificates, a government converts gold into currency at the market rate by printing paper notes. A person exchanges one ounce of gold for its value in currency. This person keeps the currency for one year, and then exchanges it all for an amount of gold at the new market value.  If the value of the currency relative to gold has changed during the interim this second exchange may yield more or less than one ounce of gold.  (Assume that the value or direct [[purchasing power]] of one ounce of gold remains constant through the year.)

If the value of the currency relative to gold has decreased, then the person receives less than one ounce of gold.  Seigniorage occurred.

If the value of the currency relative to gold has increased, then the person receives more than one ounce of gold.  Seigniorage did not occur.

Seigniorage, therefore, is the positive return on issuing notes and coins, or "[[carry (investment)|carry]]" on money in circulation.

The opposite, "[[demurrage (currency)|cost of carry (demurrage)]]", is not regarded as a form of seigniorage.

==Ordinary seigniorage==
Ordinarily seigniorage is only an interest-free loan (for instance of gold) to the issuer of the coin or paper money. When the currency is worn out, the issuer buys it back at face value, thereby balancing exactly the revenue received when it was put into circulation, without any additional amount for the interest value of what the issuer received.

Historically, seigniorage was the profit resulting from producing coins.  Silver and gold were mixed with base metals to make durable coins.  Thus the British "sterling" was 92.5% pure silver; the base metal added (and thus the pure silver retained by the government mint) was (less costs) the profit, the seigniorage.  United States gold coins before 1933 were made from 90% gold and 10% copper. To make up for the lack of gold the coins are over-weighted. A one-ounce Gold American Eagle will have as much of the alloy as is needed to contain a total of one ounce of gold which will be over one ounce. Seigniorage is earned by selling the coins above the melt value in exchange for guaranteeing the weight of the coin.

Currently, under the rules governing monetary operations of major central banks (including the central bank of the United States), seigniorage on bank notes is simply defined as the [[interest]] payments received by central banks on the total amount of currency issued.  This usually takes the form of interest payments on treasury bonds purchased by central banks, putting more dollars into circulation.  However, if the currency is collected, or is otherwise taken permanently out of circulation, the back end of the deal never occurs (that is, the currency is never returned to the central bank). Thus the issuer of the currency keeps the whole seigniorage profit, by not having to buy worn out issued currency back at face value.

===Solvency constraints of central banks===
The solvency constraint of the standard central bank only requires that the present discounted value of its net non-monetary liabilities (separate from its monetary liabilities accrued through seigniorage attempts) be zero or negative in the long run. Its monetary liabilities are liabilities only in name, as they are irredeemable: the holder of base money cannot insist at any time on the redemption of a given amount of base money into anything else other than the same amount of itself (base money)—unless, of course, the holder of said base money is another central bank reclaiming the value of its original interest-free loan.

==Seigniorage as a tax==
Economists regard seigniorage as a form of inflation tax, redistributing real resources to the currency issuer. Issuing new currency, rather than collecting taxes paid out of the existing money stock, is then considered in effect a tax that falls on those who hold the existing currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSVakrh8TToC&amp;pg=PA246&amp;dq=seigniorage+macroeconomics&amp;sig=8biDt3jtUXRForOCnW9rk_NzyEs#PPA365,M1|title=An Encyclopedia of Macroeconomics|first1=Brian|last1=Snowdon|first2=Howard R.|last2=Vane|date=11 April 2018|publisher=Edward Elgar|accessdate=11 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[monetary inflation|Inflation]] of the [[money supply]] in the long run may cause—and, all other things being equal, will cause—a general rise in prices due to the reduced purchasing power of the currency.

This is one reason offered in support of [[free banking]], a [[gold standard|gold]] or [[silver standard]], or at a minimum the reduction of political control over [[central banks]]. The latter could then take as their primary objective ensuring a stable value of currency by controlling monetary expansion and thus limiting inflation. Independence from government is required to reach this aim – indeed, it is well known in economic literature that governments face a conflict of interest in this regard{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}.  In fact, "hard money" advocates argue that central banks have utterly failed to obtain the objective of a stable currency.  Under the gold standard, for example, the price level in both England and the US remained relatively stable over hundreds of years, though with some protracted periods of [[deflation (economics)|deflation]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}.  Since the US [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] was formed in 1913, however, the US dollar has fallen to barely a twentieth of its former value through the consistently inflationary policies of the bank.  Economists counter that deflation is hard to control once it sets in and its effects are much more damaging than modest, consistent inflation.

Banks or governments relying heavily on seigniorage and [[Fractional reserve banking|fractional reserve sources of revenue]] can find it counterproductive.&lt;ref&gt;Tara McIndoe-Calder, [https://www.academia.edu/595168/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe_Money_Demand_Seigniorage_and_Aid_Shocks ''Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe: Money Demand, Seigniorage and Aid shocks''], [[Central Bank of Ireland]]; [[University of Dublin]] - Institute for International Integration Studies, May 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rational expectations]] of inflation take into account a bank's seigniorage strategy, and inflationary expectations can maintain high inflation. Instead of accruing seigniorage from [[fiat money]] and credit, most governments opt to raise revenue primarily through formal [[tax]]ation and other means.

===Inflation tax benefits to governments===

In the book ''Inflation Tax: The Plan To Deal With The Debts'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oi3IQXzH5kgC|title=Inflation Tax: The Plan to Deal with the Debts|first=Pete|last=Comley|date=1 July 2013|publisher=Pete Comley|accessdate=11 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are suggested to be a number of ways in which governments gain benefits directly or indirectly from inflation i.e.
* Decreased debt burden (the primary benefit; only occurs if inflation is unexpected)
* Increased personal tax revenue
* Extra revenue from saving account interest tax
* Increased revenue from business taxation
* Relatively lower public expenditure
* Taxing people who don't vote (e.g., foreigners)
* Helping to reduce the burden of other debtors (e.g. mortgage holders and banks; only occurs if inflation is unexpected)
* Making GDP appear higher.

It has been argued that inflation has been used by successive governments since 1945 as a tool to manage their debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Inflation Tax |author=Pete Comley |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary usage==
The [[50 State Quarters|"50 State" series]] of [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarters]] (25-cent coins) was launched in the U.S. in 1999. The [[U.S. government]] planned on a large number of people collecting each new quarter as it rolled out of the [[Us mint|U.S. Mint]], thus taking the pieces out of circulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/circulatingcoins/index.cfm?action=CircPenny United States Mint 50 State Quarters® Design Use Policy], Retrieved December 5, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Each set of quarters is worth $14.00 (a complete set includes quarters for all fifty states, the five U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia). Since it costs the Mint about five cents for each 25-cent piece it produces, the government made a profit whenever someone "bought" a coin.&lt;ref name="State quarters FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|work=The 50 State Quarters Program of the United States Mint|publisher=[[United States Mint]]|accessdate=2009-10-18|url=http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/50sq_program/index.cfm?action=faq_50sq#costtotaxpayer|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713215905/http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/50sq_program/index.cfm?action=faq_50sq#costtotaxpayer|archivedate=2007-07-13|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Treasury]] estimates that it has earned about US$6.3 billion in seigniorage from the quarters over the course of the entire program.&lt;ref name="Coin Update News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.coinupdate.com/state-quarters-program-seigniorage-0133/|title=50 State Quarters Program Earned $6.3 Billion in Seigniorage - Coin Update|author=|date=|website=news.coinupdate.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, national mints report the amount of seigniorage provided to their respective governments; for example, the [[Royal Canadian Mint]] reported that in 2006 it generated $C93 million in seigniorage for the Government of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mint.ca/royalcanadianmintpublic/RcmImageLibrary.aspx?filename=RCM_AR06_E.pdf|title=Canadian Coins - Circulation, Collecting Coins &amp; Coin Sets - the Royal Canadian Mint|author=|date=|website=www.mint.ca|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. government, the largest beneficiary of seignorage, earned approximately $25 billion annually as of 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://banking.senate.gov/docs/reports/dollar.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  For coinage only, seigniorage accruing to the U.S. Treasury per dollar issued for the fiscal year 2011 was 45 cents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasury.gov/about/budget-performance/Documents/20%20-%20FY%202013%20US%20Mint%20CJ.pdf United States Mint FY 2013 President’s Budget Submission] ''[[United States Treasury]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, central banks have introduced limited quantities of higher-valued banknotes in unusual denominations, with the intention of these notes being collected.  The denomination chosen will usually coincide with an anniversary of national significance.  However, the potential seigniorage that can be earned from such printings has proven to be limited, since the unusual denomination makes the notes more difficult to circulate and only a relatively small number of people are willing to collect higher-valued notes.

According to some reports,  over half of [[Zimbabwe]] governmental revenue in 2008 was seigniorage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/19/AR2008021902337.html |first=Michael |last=Gerson |title=Dying Silently In Zimbabwe |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2008-02-20 |accessdate=2009-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zimbabwe has experienced [[hyperinflation]] (see ''[[Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe]]''), with the annualized rate at about 24,000% in July 2008 (prices doubling every 46 days).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newzimbabwe.com/pages/inflation180.17386.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overseas circulation==
A very profitable type of seignorage is from the international circulation of banknotes. While the cost of printing banknotes is minimal, the foreign entity must provide goods and services at the face value of the note to obtain it. The banknote is retained because the entity values it as a ''[[store of value]]'' because of mistrust of the local currency.

Overseas circulation is intimately tied in with large value banknotes. One purpose of using foreign currency is for store of value, but another is efficiency of private transactions, some of which are illegal.

American currency has been circulating globally for most of the 20th century. Certainly in [[World War II]], the amount of currency in circulation was increased several fold. However, the modern era of huge printings of the [[United States one hundred-dollar bill]] started with the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. Production was quadrupled with the first ever trillion dollar printing of this bill. As of the end of 2008, U.S. currency in circulation with the public amounted to $824 billion and 76% of the currency supply was in the form of $100 denomination banknotes, amounting to twenty $100 bills per U.S. citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar L. Feige "New estimates of overseas U.S. currency holdings, the Underground economy and the "Tax Gap" Forthcoming in Crime, Law and Social Change. https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/19564.html&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past decade there has been considerable controversy concerning the amount of U.S. currency circulating abroad. Porter and Judson&lt;ref&gt;Porter and Judson, 1996, R. D. Porter and R. A. Judson, The location of U.S. currency: How much is abroad? Federal Reserve Bulletin 82 (1996), pp. 883–903&lt;/ref&gt; have claimed that in the mid nineties between 53 and 67 percent of U.S. currency was overseas, whereas Feige’s&lt;ref&gt;Feige, 1997, E. L. Feige, Revised estimates of the underground economy: Implications of U.S. currency held abroad, in O. Lippert and M. Walker (ed.) The Underground economy: Global evidence of its size and impact. (1997), pp. 151–208. https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/13805.html&lt;/ref&gt; estimates suggested a figure closer to 40 percent abroad. Most recently, Goldberg&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, 2010, L. S. Goldberg, Is the International Role of the Dollar Changing? Federal Reserve Bank Of New York, Current Issues in Economics and Finance, 16(1) (2010) pp. 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt; writing in a New York Federal Reserve publication asserted that “about 65 percent ($580 billion) of all banknotes are in circulation outside of the country. However, these assertions are contradicted by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors Flow of Funds statistics&lt;ref&gt;http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/current/ and See:Edgar L. Feige "New estimates of overseas U.S. currency holdings, the Underground economy and the "Tax Gap" https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/19564.html&lt;/ref&gt; which show that at the end of March 2009, only $313 billion (36.7 percent) of U.S. currency was held abroad. Feige calculates that since 1964, "the cumulative seigniorage earnings accruing to the U.S. by virtue of the currency held by foreigners amounted to $167–$185 billion and over the past two decades seigniorage revenues from foreigners have averaged $6–$7 billion dollars per year".

The American $100 bill has some competition, primarily from the [[500 euro note|€500 note]]. The larger value of the banknote makes it easier to transport larger amounts of money. As an example, $1 million in currency in $100 bills weighs 22 pounds, if, say, you were to carry it on board an airplane. It is difficult to carry this much money without a briefcase and some physical security. The same amount in €500 notes would weigh less than three pounds, and it could probably be dispersed in clothing and in luggage without attracting attention or alerting a security device. For many illegal operations, the problem of transporting currency is more difficult than transporting cocaine because of the size and weight of the currency. The ease of transporting banknotes makes the euro very attractive to Latin American drug cartels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/africa/09/21/africa.drug.cartels/index.html |title=Latin American drug cartels find home in West Africa | work=CNN | date=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Banknotes of the Swiss franc|Swiss 1000 franc note]] is probably the only other banknote that is in circulation outside of its home country. It is worth slightly more than US$1000. However, to the non-Swiss it doesn't provide a significant advantage over the €500 note as there are 20 times as many of the €500 note circulating and they are more widely recognized. As a [[reserve currency]] it is roughly 0.1% of the currency composition of official foreign exchange reserves.

Governments differ radically in their issuance of large banknotes. As of August 2009, the number of 1000 Swiss franc notes circulating was over three times the population of [[Switzerland]]. In comparison, the number of £50 banknotes circulating is slightly less than three times the population of the United Kingdom. But the 1000 franc note is worth roughly £600. The British government has traditionally been wary of large banknotes since the [[counterfeit]]ing [[Operation Bernhard]] in [[World War II]] which caused the [[Bank of England]] to withdraw all notes larger than £5 from circulation, and not reintroduce other denominations until the early 1960s (£10), 1970 (£20) and March 20, 1981 (£50).

The American treasury considered re-issuing a US$500 banknote when the euro banknotes began circulating. There was concern that the high value banknotes would provide competition. However, after recognition that the $500 banknote would provide a huge advantage to worldwide criminal operations and [[dictatorship]]s, the decision was made not to pursue this option.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4191">'''Silk waste''' includes all kinds of raw [[silk]] which may be unwindable, and therefore unsuited to the [[Silk throwing|throwing process]]. Before the introduction of machinery applicable to the spinning of silk waste, the refuse from [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]] reeling, and also from silk winding, which is now used in producing spun silk fabrics, was nearly all destroyed as being useless, with the exception of that which could be hand-combed and spun by means of the [[distaff]] and [[spinning wheel]], a method which is still practised by some of the peasantry in [[India]] and other countries in [[Asia]].

==Sources==
The supply of waste silk is drawn from the following sources:

* The [[silkworm]], when commencing to spin, emits a dull, lustreless and uneven thread with which it suspends itself from the twigs and leaves of the tree upon which it has been feeding, or  the straws provided for it by attendants in the worm-rearing establishments: this first thread is unreelable, and, moreover, is often mixed with straw, leaves and twigs.
* The outside layers of the true [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]] are too coarse and uneven for reeling; and as the worm completes its task of spinning, the thread becomes finer and weaker, so both the extreme outside and inside layers are put aside as waste.
* Pierced cocoons, that is, those from which the moth of the silkworm has emerged-and damaged cocoons.
* During the process of reeling from the cocoon the silk often breaks; and both in finding a true and reliable thread, and in joining the ends, there is unavoidable waste.
* Raw silk skeins are often re-reeled; and in this process part has to be discarded: this being known to the trade as gum-waste. The same term—gum-waste—is applied to "waste" made in the various processes of silk throwing; but manufacturers using threads known technically as organzines and trams call the surplus "manufacturer's waste."

==Processing==
A silk "[[wiktionary:throwster|throwster]]" receives the silk in skein form, the thread of which consists of a number of silk fibres wound together to make a certain diameter or size, the separate fibre having actually been spun by the worm. The silk-waste spinner receives the silk in quite a different form: merely the raw material, packed in [[:wikt:bale#Etymology 3|bales]] of various sizes and weights, the contents being a much-tangled mass of all lengths of fibre mixed with much foreign matter, such as ends of straws, twigs, leaves, worms and [[chrysalis]]. It is the spinner's business to straighten out these fibres, with the aid of machinery, and then to so join them that they become a thread, which is known as spun silk.

All silk produced by the worm is composed of two substances: [[fibroin]], the true thread, and [[sericin]], which is a hard, gummy coating of the fibroin. Before the silk can be manipulated by machinery to any advantage, the gum coating must be removed, really dissolved and washed away. Where the method used in achieving this operation is through fermentation, the product is called '''schappe'''. The former, schapping, is the French, Italian and Swiss method, from which the silk when finished is neither so bright nor so good in colour as the discharged silk; but it is very clean and level, and for some purposes essential, as, for instance, in [[velvet]] manufacture.

A {{Nihongo|'''special purpose company'''|特定目的会社|tokutei mokuteki kaisha|abbreviated '''SPC''' or '''TMK'''}} is a type of [[corporation]] which can be formed under [[Japanese law]]. SPCs were enacted by the [[Diet of Japan]] in Law No. 105 of 1998.

The main features of an SPC are:

* An SPC can only be used for the {{Nihongo|fluidization (i.e. securitization) of assets|資産の流動化|shisan no ryūdōka}}. It cannot manage or dispose of assets, although it can commission these activities to a third party manager.
* If certain conditions are met, an SPC can write off the assets it distributes as losses for tax purposes, thus exempting those distributions from [[corporate tax]]ation.

SPCs are the only corporate entity which can make tax-free distributions under Japanese tax law as of 2006, and are an attractive alternative to [[general partnership]]s, [[tokumei kumiai]], [[Trust law|trust]]s or other tax-free alternatives in a number of [[investment]] transactions.

==Structure==
An SPC is formed by registering [[articles of incorporation]] with a Legal Affairs Bureau, a branch office of the Ministry of Justice. Each SPC must have at least one [[board of directors|director]] and at least one [[statutory auditor]].

==Investing in an SPC==
An SPC may issue any of five types of [[security|securities]] in exchange for an investment:

# {{Nihongo|Preferred investment certificates|優先出資証券|yūsen shusshi shōken}}, [[Stock|equity]] securities similar to shares of [[preferred stock]], where the bearers have rights to share in the profits of the company, but cannot participate in decision-making 
# {{Nihongo|Special [[Bond (finance)|bond]]s|特定社債券|tokutei shasai ken}}
# {{Nihongo|Special [[commercial paper]]|特定約束手形|tokutei yakusoku tegata}}
# {{Nihongo|Convertible special bonds|転換特定社債|tenkan tokutei shasai}}
# {{Nihongo|Special bonds with subscription rights for new preferred investment certificates|新優先出資証券引受権付特定社債|shin yūsen shusshi shōken hikiuke ken tsuke tokutei shasai}}

==Taxation==
In order for its distributions to be exempt from corporate taxes, an SPC must meet a number of criteria:

# Be registered on the national list of SPCs (maintained by the Prime Minister's office)
# Either:
#* Have ¥100,000,000 or more in outstanding special bonds, or
#* Have all of its outstanding bonds held by [[institutional investor]]s, or
#* Have more than fifty holders of preferred investment certificates, or
#* Have all of its outstanding preferred investment certificates held by institutional investors
# Conduct at least 50% of the total value of its equity and debt offerings within Japan
# Have an accounting period of one year or less
# Conform to the purposes permitted for SPCs throughout the tax year in question

'''''The Cluetrain Manifesto''''' is a work of business literature collaboratively authored by Rick Levine, [[Christopher Locke]], [[Doc Searls]], and [[David Weinberger]]. It was first posted to the web in 1999 as a set of ninety-five theses, and was published as a book in 2000 with the theses extended by seven essays. The work examines the impact of the [[Internet]] on [[marketing]], claiming that conventional marketing techniques are rendered obsolete by the online "conversations" that consumers have and that companies need to join.

A revised and extended version of the text appeared as a book under the title ''The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business as Usual'' in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Perseus| isbn = 0738204315| last1 = Levine| first1 = Rick| last2 = Locke| first2 = Christopher| last3 = Searls| first3 = Doc| last4 = Weinberger| first4 = David| title = The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business as Usual| location = Cambridge, Massachusetts| date = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its central thesis that "markets are conversations", the work asserts that the Internet is unlike conventional media used in [[mass marketing]] as it enables conversations amongst consumers and between consumers and companies, which are claimed to transform traditional business practices. Technologies listed in the printed publication as conduits of such conversations include email, news groups, mailing lists, chat, and web pages. More recent technologies (such as [[blog]]s and [[wiki]]s) are not mentioned.

In its form, the work alludes to [[Martin Luther]]'s ''[[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]]'',&lt;ref name="gillmor1999" /&gt; a central text of the [[Protestant Reformation]].

The work asserts that the term "cluetrain" stems from an anonymous source speaking about their former corporate employer: "The clue train stopped there four times a day for ten years and they never took delivery."

''The Cluetrain Manifesto'' was re-published as an extended 10th Anniversary Edition in 2010.&lt;ref name="anniversary"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Doctorow| first = Cory| title = Cluetrain Manifesto 10th Anniversary Edition: Still the end of business as usual?| work = Boing Boing| accessdate = 2015-03-04| date = 2010-01-15| url = http://boingboing.net/2010/01/15/cluetrain-manifesto.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, two of the authors, Doc Searls and David Weinberger, posted ''New Clues'', a follow-up to the work.&lt;ref name="newclues"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Doc Searls| first = | author2=David Weinberger|title = New Clues| work = Cluetrain| date = 2015-01-08|url=http://cluetrain.com/newclues/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 'Cluetrain' theses==
A single paragraph summarizes the essential position taken by the writers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A powerful global conversation has begun. Through the Internet, people are discovering and inventing new ways to share relevant knowledge with blinding speed. As a direct result, markets are getting smarter—and getting smarter faster than most companies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A reading of the '95 theses' can lead to a number of divisions or aggregations, it is possible to make a somewhat arbitrary split of the listed theses as a basis for understanding the content of the printed publication and a simplified structural view of the main suppositions of the authors.

=== Theses 1–6: Markets are Conversations ===

Historically, the authors state, the marketplace was a location where people gathered and talked to each other (thesis 1): they would discuss available products, price, reputation and in doing so connect with others (theses 2–5.)
The authors then assert that the internet is providing a means for anyone connected to the internet to re-enter such a virtual marketplace and once again achieve such a level of communication between people. This, prior to the internet, had not been available in the age of mass media (thesis 6.)

=== Thesis 7: Hyperlinks Subvert Hierarchy ===

The ability of the internet to link to additional information – information which might exist beyond the formal hierarchy of organizational structure or published material from such an organization – acts as a means of subverting, or bypassing, formal hierarchies.

=== Theses 8–13: Connection between the new markets and companies ===

The same technology connecting people into markets outside of organizations, is also connecting employees within organizations (thesis 8.)  The authors suggest that these networks create a more informed marketplace/consumer (thesis 9) through the conversations being held.  The information available in the marketplace is superior to that available from the organizations themselves (thesis 10–12.)

The authors, through the remaining theses, then examine the impact that these changes will have on organizations and how, in turn, organizations will need to respond to the changing marketplace to remain viable.

=== Theses 14 – 25: Organizations entering the marketplace ===

With the emergence of the virtual marketplace, the authors indicate that the onus will be on organizations to enter the marketplace conversation (thesis 25) and do so in a way that connects with the ‘voice’ of the new marketplace (thesis 14–16) or risk becoming irrelevant (thesis 16).

=== Theses 26–40: Marketing &amp; Organizational Response ===

The authors then list a number of theses that deal with the approach that they believe organizations will need to adopt if they are to successfully enter the new marketplace (thesis 26) as it is claimed that those within the new marketplace will no longer respond to the previously issued mass-media communications as such communication is not ‘authentic’ (thesis 33.)

=== Theses 41–52: Intranets and the impact to organization control and structure ===

More fully exploring the impact of the intranet within organizations, theses forty-one through fifty-two elaborate on the subversion of hierarchy initially listed as thesis seven. When implemented correctly (theses 44–46), it is suggested that such intranets re-establish real communication amongst employees in parallel with the impact of the internet to the marketplace (thesis 48) and this will lead to a 'hyperlinked' organizational structure  within the organization which will take the place of (or be utilized in place of) the formally documented organization chart (thesis 50).

=== Theses 53–71: Connecting the Internet marketplace with corporate Intranets ===

The ideal, according to the work, is for the networked marketplace to be connected to the networked intranet so that full communication can exist between those within the marketplace and those within the company itself (thesis 53.) 
Achieving this level of communication is hindered by the imposition of ‘command and control’ structures (thesis 54–58) but, ultimately, organizations will need to allow this level of communication to exist as the new marketplace will no longer respond to the mass-media ‘voice’ of the organization (theses 59–71)

=== Theses 72–95: New Market Expectations ===

Theses seventy-two through ninety-five aim to identify the expectations (theses 76, 77, 78, 95) and changes (thesis 72) that exist within the new marketplace and how those expectations and changes will require a corresponding change from organizations (theses 79, 84, 91, 92, 94).

==Reception==
The ninety-five theses as initially posted to the web received positive reviews in mainstream publications such as the [[San Jose Mercury News]]&lt;ref name="gillmor1999"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Gillmor |first=Dan |title=Manifesto on 'global conversation' |work=Mercury Center |accessdate=2015-03-04 |date=1999-04-05 |url=http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg040699.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990508071621/http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg040699.htm |archivedate=May 8, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Wall Street Journal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0099-9660| page = B1| last = Petzinger| first = Thomas| title = Four Web Rebels Try to Make Managers Talk Like Human Beings| work = Wall Street Journal| location = New York| date = 1999-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also widely discussed online, provoking almost religious argument in some cases. Vocal adherents included technically oriented people, who were adept in building websites, writing blogs and making themselves heard on the Internet.

The book quickly became a business bestseller&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 247| issue = 14| pages = 28| last = Rosen| first = Judith| title = Riding the "Cluetrain"| journal = Publishers Weekly| date = 2000-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and entered the top ten of ''[[Bloomberg Business|Business Week]]'''s "Best-Sellers of 2000" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = The Best-Sellers of 2000| work = Business Week| accessdate = 2015-04-09| date = 2001-02-19| url = http://www.businessweek.com/2001/01_08/b3720069.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Cluetrain Manifesto'' has been credited with setting out "the guiding principles of [[social media]] years before Facebook and Twitter existed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Baker| first = Stephen| title = Beware Social Media Snake Oil| work = BloombergView| accessdate = 2015-04-09| date = 2009-12-03| url = https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/magazine/content/09_50/b4159048693735.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also considered a foundational text in the field of conversational marketing;&lt;ref name=naked&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons| isbn = 047174719X| last1 = Scoble| first1 = Robert| last2 = Israel| first2 = Shel| title = Naked Conversations : How Blogs are Changing the Way Businesses Talk with Customers| location = Hoboken, NJ| date = 2006-01-31|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = AMACOM| isbn = 9780814429907| last = Kelly| first = Lois| title = Beyond Buzz: The Next Generation of Word-of-mouth Marketing| location = New York| date = 2007| page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Advertising Age]]'' proclaimed in 2006: "the grand vision outlined in 1999's 'Cluetrain Manifesto' is now coming true. Consumers have control, markets are conversations and marketing is evolving into a two-way discipline."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| page = 26| last = Rubel| first = Steve| title = Advertising world, meet PR| journal = Advertising Age| date = 2006-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has been criticized for casting its central term of human "voice" in [[expressivism|expressivist]] rather than [[rhetorics|rhetorical]] terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 1080-5699| volume = 63| issue = 4| pages = 106–111| last = Kreth| first = Melinda L.| title = The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business as Usual| journal = Business Communication Quarterly| accessdate = | date = December 2000| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics consider the work's public reception to be cult-like. [[John C. Dvorak]], for example, dismisses the work as a product of "lunatic fringe dingbat thinking that characterized the Internet boom" and rebukes its adherents for their "apparent faith in this odd vision of an idealistic human-oriented internetworked new world/new economy."&lt;ref name="cult"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Dvorak| first = John C.| title = Cult of the Cluetrain Manifesto| work = PC Magazine| date = 2002-02-22 |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,43161,00.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics point to the fact that the Internet cannot be conceptualized simply as "a conversation" or that human activity online cannot be reduced to the notion of a "conversation".

It has also been pointed out that the work's predictions have largely failed to materialize.&lt;ref name="illusion"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Cherwanka| first = Andrew| title = The Illusion of Corporate Transparency: The Cluetrain Manifesto 10 Years Later| work = The Huffington Post| date = 2009-05-30|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andrew-cherwenka/the-illusion-of-corporate_b_193263.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Toast of New York''''' is a 1937 American [[Biographical film|biopic]] directed by [[Rowland V. Lee]] and starring [[Edward Arnold (actor)|Edward Arnold]], [[Cary Grant]], [[Frances Farmer]], and [[Jack Oakie]]. The film is a fictionalized account of the lives of financiers [[James Fisk (financier)|James Fisk]] and [[Edward Stiles Stokes|Edward S. Stokes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=76194&amp;mainArticleId=76183|title=The Toast of New York|website=Turner Classic Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[screenplay]] was based on the book ''The Book of Daniel Drew'' by [[Bouck White]] and the story "Robber Barons" by [[Matthew Josephson]]. This is also Grant's first [[period film]].

==Plot==
In post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] America, unscrupulous, ambitious partners Jim Fisk (Arnold) and Nick Boyd (Grant) talk tight-fisted businessman [[Daniel Drew]] ([[Donald Meek]]) into selling them his shipping company, paying with worthless Confederate bonds. Later, worried that his longtime rival, [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]] ([[Clarence Kolb]]), is trying to take control of his railroad, Drew seeks help from Fisk, only to have him turn the situation to his own advantage. Fisk and Boyd eventually become powers to be reckoned with on [[Wall Street]].

Meanwhile, both men fall in love with entertainer [[Helen Josephine Mansfield|Josie Mansfield]] (Farmer). Mansfield agrees to marry Fisk out of gratitude, but really loves Boyd.

Fisk's greed grows beyond all reason and he tries to [[corner the market]] in gold. When Fisk ignores Boyd's warnings, Boyd turns against him, worried that the [[Black Friday (1869)|resulting panic]] threatens the financial system of the whole country. The federal government finally intervenes by releasing its gold reserves, bankrupting Fisk in the process.

==Production==
The film was originally announced as ''The Robber Barons'' to star [[Robert Donat]] who had just made ''Count of Monte Cristo'' for producer [[Edward Small]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Donat, Jack Oakie and Other Stars to Glisten on R.-K.-O.

Filming was meant to take four weeks but ended up taking fifteen with Arnold on $10,000 a week, half of which went to [[B.P. Schulberg]] who owned his contract. Costing Small this much money gave satisfaction to Arnold, who had been rejected by the producer seeking his representation as an agent in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;HOLLYWOOD PICKET LINE: The Industry Watches the C.

==Reception==
Reviews were mixed. [[Frank Nugent|Frank S. Nugent]] wrote that it was "only moderately entertaining" and "a familiar formula Arnold show."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |date=1970 |title=The New York Times Film Reviews, Volume 2: 1932-1938 |url= |location= |publisher=The New York Times &amp; Arno Press |page=1411 |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it "good entertainment despite its inanities, extravagances and exaggerations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date=July 14, 1937 |title=Film Reviews |url= |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |location=New York |publisher=Variety, Inc. |page=20 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' wrote that it was "lacking in dramatic force" and had unsympathetic characters but offered "several thrilling moments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |date=August 7, 1937 |title=The Toast of New York |url= |journal=[[Harrison's Reports]] |location=New York |publisher=Harrison's Reports, Inc. |page=127 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell Maloney of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' called the story "fumbling and aimless" and found "shocking anachronisms" in the dialogue, concluding, "Not recommended."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Maloney |first=Russell |date=July 31, 1937 |title=The Current Cinema |url= |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |location=New York |publisher=F-R Publishing Corp. |page=49 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was a commercial disappointment, losing $530,000, making it RKO's biggest money loser of the year.&lt;ref name="rko"/&gt; This led to Edward Small leaving RKO and returning to [[United Artists]].

A '''time horizon''', also known as a '''planning horizon''', is a fixed point of time in the future at which point certain processes will be evaluated or assumed to end.  It is necessary in an [[Accountancy|accounting]], [[finance]] or [[risk management]] regime to assign such a fixed horizon time so that alternatives can be evaluated for performance over the same period of time. A time horizon is a physical impossibility in the real world.

Although short term horizons such as [[end of day]], end of week, end of month matter in accounting, generally it is mere summing-up and the simplest [[mark to market]] processes that take place at these short term horizons.  No [[scenario analysis]] or mark to future activities are usually undertaken for such short periods, except for very large portfolios.

The most common horizons used in planning are one "quarter" (a quarter year, or three months), a year, two years, three years, four years (especially in a [[representative democracy]] where this is a quite common [[term of office]] and election cycle) and five years (in corporate planning). More far-sighted companies and government agencies may also use between ten and one hundred years. Thirty years is often used in [[mortgage loan|mortgage]] contracts and [[Treasury security#Treasury bond|US Treasury bond]]s such as the "long bond". One hundred years, sometimes considered equal to seven generations, is a time horizon often cited by the ancient [[Iroquois]] and modern [[Green movement|Greens]]. The [[Forestry Commission]] in the UK plans over a century into the future.

Agreeing on a common time horizon for action is particularly important in global policy, as each participant will have very different time horizon habits.  Achieving [[simultaneous policy]] is quite difficult without an agreement, as those taking action early may be seriously disadvantaged in competition with those taking action late on a regulatory matter. One attempt to bring about a global simultaneous policy is being attempted by the [[International Simultaneous Policy Organization]]'s SIMPOL campaign.&lt;ref name="Campaign concept"&gt;[http://www.simpol.org.uk/index.php?id=8 Simpol.org -  Campaign concept]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in terms of physics, the term "time horizon" is also synonymous with [[event horizon]], first identified in [[Stephen Hawking]]'s [[A Brief History of Time]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Hawking stated that the time horizon is the boundary that separates a [[black hole]] from other celestial bodies. Even time and light cannot escape once trapped in the black hole.

'''"Too Much Finance?"''' is the title of a highly cited paper by [[Jean-Louis Arcand]], [[Enrico Berkes]], and [[Ugo Panizza]]. The paper was originally described in a 2011  [[VoxEU]] column,&lt;ref name="VoxEU Too Much Finance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voxeu.org/article/has-finance-gone-too-far|title=Too Much Finance|publisher=VoxEU|accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012 it was issued as [[IMF]] working paper,&lt;ref name="IMF Too Much Finance"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2012/wp12161.pdf|title=Too Much Finance|publisher=IMF Working Paper|accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2015 was published by the [[Journal of Economic Growth]].&lt;ref name="JEG Too Much Finance"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10887-015-9115-2|title=Too Much Finance|journal=Journal of Economic Growth|accessdate=27 May 2015|doi=10.1007/s10887-015-9115-2|volume=20|pages=105–148 | last1 = Arcand | first1 = Jean Louis }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Google Scholar"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=too+much+finance|title=Too Much Finance - Google Scholar|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions ==
The paper provides empirical evidence for the hypothesis that there is a point after which a growing financial sector starts having a negative impact on economic growth.

== Popular Media ==
On September 4, 2012, Time Magazine featured the article 'Bankers: Who Needs Them?',&lt;ref name="Bankers: Who Needs Them?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.time.com/2012/09/04/bankers-who-needs-them/|title=Bankers: Who Needs Them?|publisher=Time Magazine|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the working paper. The article features the same quote by [[James Tobin]] as the working paper:

{{quote|text="We are throwing more and more of our resources, including the cream of our youth, into financial activities remote from the production of goods and services, into activities that generate high private rewards disproportionate to their social productivity."}}

It further cites one of the authors, [[Ugo Panizza]] who summarizes the working paper as:

{{quote|"Our findings show that there can be "too much" finance. While opponents of regulation like Alan Greenspan argued that less credit may hurt our future standard of living, our results indicate that, in countries with very large financial sectors, regulatory policies that reduce the size of the financial sector may have a positive effect on economic growth."}}

On 26 September 2012 the BBC World Service programme Business Daily interviewed one of the authors - [[Ugo Panizza]] - on the issue of too much finance for a broadcast on the rise of digital currencies.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00y7fwb|title=Digital currencies|publisher=BBC World Service|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 26, 2015, the [[Financial Times]] published a widely read column by Martin Wolf&lt;ref name="Why finance is too much of a good thing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/64c2f03a-03a0-11e5-a70f-00144feabdc0.html?ftcamp=published_links%2Frss%2Fcomment_columnists_martin-wolf%2Ffeed%2F%2Fproduct#axzz3bKWUI5Ys|title=Why finance is too much of a good thing|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that discusses the original findings of the "Too much finance?" paper, as well as more recent research by the [[Bank of International Settlements]] and [[IMF]] which supports these findings. The [[Financial Times]] article labels the authors of "Too Much Finance?" as [[IMF]] researchers. However, only Berkes was at the IMF when the paper was originally written, Arcand and Panizza are professors of Economics at the [[Graduate Institute]] in [[Geneva]].

In [[law]], '''vesting''' is to give an immediately secured right of present or future deployment.  One has a '''vested right''' to an asset that cannot be taken away by any third party, even though one may not yet possess the asset.  When the right, interest, or title to the present or future possession of a legal estate can be transferred to any other party, it is termed a '''vested interest'''.

The concept can arise in any number of contexts, but the most common are [[inheritance]] law and [[retirement plan]] law. In real estate, '''to vest''' is to create an entitlement to a privilege or a right. For example, one may cross someone else’s property regularly and unrestrictedly for several years, and one’s right to an [[easement]] becomes vested. The original owner still retains the possession, but can no longer prevent the other party from crossing.

==Inheritance==
Some [[bequest]]s do not vest immediately upon death of the [[testator]]. For example, many [[Will (law)|will]]s specify that an [[heir]] who dies within a set period (such as 60 days) is not to inherit, and further specify how the corresponding share is to be distributed. This is generally done to obviate disputes over the precise time of death, and to avoid paying taxes twice in rapid succession should multiple members of a family die in the wake of a disaster. Such a bequest does not vest until the expiration of the specified period, because the actual heir cannot be determined with certainty.

It is also possible to give a person, A, a life interest in a property, with the [[Remainder (law)|remainder]] to go to another person or persons, B. If the beneficiary of the remainder cannot yet be known, then the remainder is said not to have vested, and the remainder is said to be [[Remainder (law)#Contingent remainder|contingent]]. This may happen with [[Fee tail|entail]]ed [[Estate (law)|estate]]s, or when property is left in trust to care for a child or relative without heirs. (See [[trust law]] for details).

==Employment==

===Retirement plans===
Vesting is an issue in conjunction with [[employer]] contributions to an [[employee stock option]] plan, deferred compensation plan, or to a retirement plan such as a [[401(k)]], [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]] or [[pension]] plan.

A '''vested right''' is "an absolute right; when a plan is fully vested, the employee has an absolute right to the entire amount of money in the account".&lt;ref&gt;[http://lectlaw.com/def2/u032.htm Lectric Law Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a "basic right that has been granted, or has accrued, and cannot be taken away"; for example. one has a right to a vested [[pension]].&lt;ref&gt;Ballentine's Law Dictionary, p. 577 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the portion ''vested'' cannot be reclaimed by the employer, nor can it be used to satisfy the employer's debts. Any portion not vested may be forfeited under certain conditions, such as termination of employment. The portion invested is often determined [[pro-rata]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Generally, for retirement plans in the [[United States]], employees are fully vested in their own salary deferral contributions upon inception.  For employer contributions, however, the employer has limited options under the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] (ERISA) to delay the vesting of their contributions to the employee. For example, the employer can say that the employee must work with the company for three years or they lose any employer contributed money, which is known as ''cliff vesting''. Or it can choose to have the 20% of the contributions vest each year over five years, known as ''graduated vesting''.

Choosing a vesting plan allows an employer to selectively reward employees who remain employed for a period of time. In theory, this allows the employer to make greater contributions than would otherwise be prudent, because the money they contribute on behalf of employees goes to the ones they most want to reward.

===Ownership in startup companies===
Small entrepreneurial companies usually offer grants of [[common stock]] or positions in an [[employee stock option]] plan to employees and other key participants such as [[independent contractor|contractors]], [[board of directors|board members]], [[Advisory board|advisors]] and major vendors. To make the reward commensurate with the extent of contribution, encourage loyalty, and avoid spreading ownership widely among former participants, these grants are usually subject to vesting arrangements.

Vesting of options is straightforward. The grantee receives an option to purchase a block of common stock, typically on commencement of employment, which vests over time. The option may be exercised at any time but only with respect to the vested portion. The entire option is lost if not exercised within a short period after the end of the employer relationship. The vesting operates simply by changing the status of the option over time from fully unexercisable to fully exercisable according to the vesting schedule.

Common stock grants are similar in function but the mechanism is different.  An employee, typically a company founder, purchases stock in the company at nominal price shortly after the company is formed. The company retains a [[Repurchase agreement|repurchase]] right to buy the stock back at the same price should the employee leave. The repurchase right diminishes over time so that the company eventually has no right to repurchase the stock (in other words, the stock becomes fully vested).

Beginning in the 1990s, vesting periods in the United States are usually 3–5 years for employees, but shorter for board members and others whose expected tenure at a company is shorter. The vesting schedule is most often a [[pro-rata]] monthly vesting over the period with a six or twelve month cliff. Alternative vesting models are becoming more popular including milestone-based vesting and dynamic equity vesting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://slicingpie.com/bootstrapper-equity-why-time-based-vesting-is-a-waste-of-time/|title=Perfect Equity Splits for Bootstrapped Startups|work=Slicing Pie|access-date=2017-09-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of both stock and options, large initial grants that vest over time are more common than periodic smaller grants because they are easier to account for and administer, they establish the arrangement up-front and are thus more predictable, and (subject to some complexities and limitations) the value of the grants and holding period requirements for tax purposes are set upon the initial grant date, giving a considerable tax advantage to the employee.

=== Profit sharing plans ===

[[Profit-sharing]] plans are usually vested in ten years, although in some cases a plan may serve essentially as a pension by allowing a limited amount of vesting should the employee retire or leave on good terms after an extended period of employment.

== Vested rights doctrine in zoning law ==
The '''vested rights doctrine''' is the rule of [[zoning]] law by which an owner or developer is entitled to proceed in accordance with the prior zoning provision where there has been a substantial change of position, expenditures, or incurrence of obligations made in good faith by an innocent party under a [[building permit]] or in reliance upon the probability of its issuance.

== Vesting arrangements and terminology==

A "vesting period" is a period of time an investor or other person holding a right to something must wait until they are capable of fully exercising their rights and until those rights may not be taken away.

In many cases vesting does not occur all at once. Specific portions of the rights grant vest on different dates over the duration of the period of the vesting.  When part of a right is vested and part remains unvested, it is considered "partly vested".

In cases of partial vesting, a "vesting schedule" is a table or chart showing the portion of a right that is vested over time; typically the schedule provides for equal portions to vest on periodic vesting dates, usually once per day, month, quarter, or year, in stairstep fashion over the course of the vesting period.  Often there is a cliff by which the first few steps in the graph are missing, so that there is no vesting at all for a period (usually six or twelve months in the case of employee equity), after which there is a cliff date upon which a large amount of vesting occurs all at once.

Some arrangements provide for "accelerated vesting", by which all or a major portion of the unvested right vests all at once upon the occurrence of a specified event such as a termination of employment by the company or acquisition of the company by another. Less commonly, the vesting schedule may call for variable grants or subject to conditions such as reaching milestones or employee performance. "Graded vesting" (vesting after each year until the employee is fully vested) may be "uniform" (e.g., 20% of the compensation vested each year for five years) or "non-uniform" (e.g., 20%, 30%, and 50% of the compensation vested each year for the next three years).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/graded-vesting.asp#ixzz20GyLrEjY Graded Vesting]&lt;/ref&gt;
