[[File:J C Maxwell with top.jpg|thumb|[[James Clerk Maxwell]], with his color top that he used for investigation of color vision and additive color]]

'''Additive color''' is a method to create [[color]] by mixing a number of different [[light]] colors, with shades of [[red]], [[green]], and [[blue]] being the most common [[primary color]]s used in the additive color system. 

Additive color is in contrast to [[subtractive color]], in which colors are created by subtracting (absorbing) parts of the spectrum of light present in ordinary white light, by means of colored [[pigment]]s or [[dye]]s, such as those in [[paint]]s, [[inks]], and the three dye layers in typical color [[photograph]]s on [[photographic film|film]].

The combination of two of the standard three additive [[primary color]]s in equal proportions produces an additive [[secondary color]]—[[cyan]], [[magenta]] or [[yellow]]—which, in the form of dyes or pigments, are the standard primary colors in subtractive color systems. The subtractive system using primaries that are the secondaries of the additive system can be viewed as an alternative approach to reproducing a wide range of colors by controlling the relative amounts of red, green, and blue light that reach the eye.

Computer monitors and televisions are the most common examples of additive color. Examination with a sufficiently powerful magnifying lens will reveal that each pixel in [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]], [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] and most other types of color video displays is composed of red, green and blue sub-pixels, the light from which combines in various proportions to produce all the other colors as well as white and shades of gray. The colored sub-pixels do not overlap on the screen, but when viewed from a normal distance they overlap and blend on the eye's [[retina]], producing the same result as external superimposition.

Another example of additive color can be found in the overlapping projected colored lights often used in theatrical lighting for plays, concerts, circus shows and night clubs.&lt;ref name="briggs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huevaluechroma.com/044.php|title=The Dimensions of Color|author=David Briggs|year=2007|accessdate=2011-11-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928031404/http://www.huevaluechroma.com/044.php|archivedate=2015-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The full [[gamut]] of color available in any additive color system is defined by all the possible combinations of all the possible [[luminosity|luminosities]] of each primary color in that system.  In [[chromaticity]] space, the gamut is a plane [[convex polygon]] with corners at the primaries. For three primaries, it is a [[triangle]].

Results obtained when mixing additive colors are often counterintuitive for people accustomed to the subtractive color system of pigments, dyes, inks and other substances that present color to the eye by reflection rather than [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]]. For example, in subtractive color systems, green is a combination of yellow and cyan; in additive color, red plus green makes yellow. Additive color is a result of the way the [[Human eye|eye]] detects color, and is not a property of light. There is a vast difference between a pure spectral yellow light, with a wavelength of approximately 580&amp;nbsp;nm, and a mixture of red and green light. However, both stimulate our eyes in a similar manner, so we do not detect that difference, and both are yellow light to the human eye. (See [[Eye#Cytology|eye (cytology)]], [[color vision]].)

==History==
[[File:Tartan Ribbon.jpg|thumb|The first permanent color photograph, taken by Thomas Sutton, under the direction of James Clerk Maxwell in 1861.]]
Systems of additive color are motivated by the [[Young–Helmholtz theory]] of [[trichromatic color vision]], which was articulated around 1850 by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], based on earlier work by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]].  For his experimental work on the subject, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] is sometimes credited as being the father of additive color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = James Clerk Maxwell | url = http://www.cis.rit.edu/node/280 | work = Inventor's Hall of Fame, Rochester Institute of Technology Center for Imaging Science | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100918095755/http://www.cis.rit.edu/node/280 | archivedate = 2010-09-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had the photographer [[Thomas Sutton (photographer)|Thomas Sutton]] photograph a tartan ribbon on black-and-white film three times, first with a red, then green, then blue color filter over the lens. The three black-and-white images were developed and then projected onto a screen with three different projectors, each equipped with the corresponding red, green, or blue color filter used to take its image. When brought into alignment, the three images (a black-and-red image, a black-and-green image and a black-and-blue image) formed a full color image, thus demonstrating the principles of additive color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Exploring Colour Photography: A Complete Guide | author = Robert Hirsch | publisher = Laurence King Publishing | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-85669-420-8 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4Gx2WItWGYoC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=maxwell+additive+color+photograph+register#PPA28,M1 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170225083437/https://books.google.com/books?id=4Gx2WItWGYoC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=maxwell+additive+color+photograph+register#PPA28,M1 | archivedate = 2017-02-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[File:RGB illumination.jpg|thumb|Red, green, and blue lights combining by reflecting from a white wall.]]

[[File:RGB additiv.svg|thumb|Additive mixing of primary colors by proximity: red, green, and blue lines brought close together create mixed colors. (Click image to enlarge and see the effect clearly.)]]

[[File:Additive color mixing.jpg|thumb|Additive color mixing]]

The following chart demonstrates an example of the mixing and perception of additive primaries, step by step.
{| class="wikitable"
 | Light source || Green (medium wavelength) light and red (long wavelength) light radiate from two different projectors.
 |-
 | Projection screen || Both the green and the red light reflect off of a spot on the screen.
 |-
 | Retina || The mixed light activates the M and L cones on a spot on the retina about equally.
 |-
 | Brain || The brain interprets the equal amounts of M and L signal as yellow.
 |}

To fully understand the process, it should be demonstrated how dull colors are obtained using cyan, magenta, and yellow instead of red, green, and blue.
{| class="wikitable"
 | Light source || Cyan (short to medium wavelengths) and yellow (medium to long wavelengths) light radiate from two different projectors.
 |-
 | Projection screen || Both the cyan and yellow reflect off of a spot on the screen.
 |-
 | Retina || M cones on a spot on the retina are strongly activated by both the cyan and yellow light, while S cones are activated by cyan and L cones by yellow.
 |-
 | Brain || The brain receives signals from the cones about some short, lots of medium, and some long wavelengths. It interprets the signal as pale (unsaturated) green.

* the ''[[Super Chief]]'' of the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]]; and
* the ''[[20th Century Limited]]'' of the [[New York Central Railroad]].

Descriptive text regarding each of the trains was listed on the gummed side of each stamp.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Del Vecchio. "New stamps will showcase Ted Rose, streamliners". ''[[Trains (magazine)|Trains]]''. May 1999. Vol. 59, Iss. 5; pg. 17. Retrieved from ProQuest.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bill McAllister. "All Aboard for Classic Design". ''[[The Washington Post]]''.

[[Image:WILLIAM BLAKE 1820 PORTRAIT BY JOHN LINNELL JPEG 1.JPG|150px|thumb|Portrait of William Blake drawn by [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]] (1820)]]

'''The Ancients''' (also known as the '''Shoreham Ancients''') were a group of young English artists and others who were brought together around 1824 by their attraction to archaism in art and admiration for the work of [[William Blake]] (1757-1827), who was a generation or two older than the group. The core members of the Ancients were [[Samuel Palmer]], [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]], and [[Edward Calvert (painter)|Edward Calvert]]. Except for Palmer, the central members who were artists were all students at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]]. They met in Blake's apartment, dubbed the "House of Interpreter"&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Wilcox, ''Samuel Palmer'' (London: Tate, 2005), 18.&lt;/ref&gt; and at the home of Samuel Palmer in the [[Kent]] village of [[Shoreham, Kent|Shoreham]].  The Ancients made little impact on the English artistic scene during the ten years or so that the group continued, but several members were later significant artists, and interest in the group has gradually increased since the late 19th-century.

They were the first English manifestation of the formalised artistic "brotherhood", an artistic movement whose aims included elements of communal living and promotion of a general vision for society. Continental groups of this sort included the German [[Nazarene movement]] and the Barbus in Paris, and the most successful later English example was to be the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]].  Like these groups they represented an oppositional break-away from the academic art establishment, and looked back to an idealized version of the past. They pursued equality among their members as a reaction to the hierarchical structure of the conventional art world.  Like Nazarenes and Barbus, they promoted the wearing of special revivalist costume, though only Palmer seems often to have worn it in practice; it seems to be shown in some portraits of Palmer by Richmond such as the bust-length miniature and chalk drawing (1829, both [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]]), which shows a round-necked pleated [[Smock-frock|smock]] under a coat with a loose untidy collar and lapels, combined with somewhat Christ-like long hair and a beard.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, 17-20, 105-106, 129; see also drawings at Yale on Wikimedia Commons&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ancients were probably aware of the Nazarenes, but probably not of the Barbus.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, 18-19 argues they must have known of the Nazarenes; though Paley, 99-100, is not so sure.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Group aims and activity==
[[File:George Richmond - Samuel Palmer - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]] drawing of [[Samuel Palmer]] wearing "Ancient" clothing, 1830]]
Unlike Blake they were mostly [[High Tory]] in politics, but equally distrustful of the modern mercantile society booming around them, and looked back to an idealized [[ruralist]] past.  They never produced a manifesto, and their activities and relationships are poorly documented; Palmer's son later destroyed most of his father's papers from the period, hinting darkly that they contained sexual material showing "a mental condition ... full of danger, and neither sufficiently masculine nor sufficiently reticent".  Most of the information about the group's activities and dynamics comes from memoirs by them or their families and friends recalled several decades later.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, 18-21, 20 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;  Their name may have come from John Giles, Palmer's stockbroker cousin, who despite being no artist was an important figure in the group and perhaps the initial instigator, as Palmer's son suggested.  He is recorded as very often extolling the superiority of "the ancients" in any context that occurred in conversation, though the word is also an important one for Blake.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, 98-99; Vaughan, 18, 105&lt;/ref&gt; At this period "ancient" was a vaguer term than in modern English, often used to refer to the medieval or even Renaissance, as in the English legal term "Ancient Monument".

Christiana Payne, in the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Art]]'', states, &lt;blockquote&gt; "Their subject-matter was drawn from the Bible, or from a vision of a golden age of [[pastoral]] innocence and abundance that had both Christian and [[Virgil|Vergilian]] overtones."&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Art Online, Subscription only: http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T002673&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The artist members submitted works for the Royal Academy exhibitions, many of which were exhibited, but these "stimulated no critical enthusiasm and were evidently not considered sufficiently threatening to provoke outrage, as the Pre-Raphaelites were to do a generation later".  None of the exhibited works seem to have been sold, and the group received very few commissions for works in "Ancient" style, though Richmond's successful career as a conventional portraitist took off in the early 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, 20-21, 20 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;  Nor did the people of Shoreham seem to take objection to Palmer and his visitors, though he records they were known by some locals as the '''Extollagers''', an attempt at "[[astrologer]]s".  Palmer added other local properties to his house there, which he rented out for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Nazarene Brotherhood and the Barbus were able to attempt communal living in abandoned monasteries outside Rome and Paris respectively, but these convenient possibilities on the continent in the Napoleonic period were not available in the London of the 1820s, so Palmer encouraged long-term stays at his house in Shoreham or elsewhere in the village.  Most members had commitments of work or family in London that meant their visits were of weeks if not days, and only William Palmer and Welby Sherman seem to have stayed longer.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, 19, 105-106&lt;/ref&gt; Blake himself made the trip at least once.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, 105&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:George Richmond self-portrait 1830 gouache.jpg|thumb|left|[[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]] self-portrait, 1830, [[gouache]]]]

The artist [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]]  (1792—1882) was not a member of the group however he was close to most of the members.  Palmer's reference to Linnell's young daughters as "little ancients" in a letter to him of September 1824 is a key piece of evidence as to the date the group was formed (Palmer later married one of them, Hannah).&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, 18&lt;/ref&gt;  Linnel was seven years older than Calvert, the oldest in the group, and a strong-minded person who disagreed with many of the group's positions.  In a letter to Palmer years later he wrote that "I ought to remember that I was not one of the monthly-meeting ''elite''— when at the Platonic feast of reason and soul only real Greeks from [[Hackney (parish)|Hackney]] and [[Lisson Grove]] were admitted".&lt;ref&gt;Paley, 103&lt;/ref&gt; Linnell was probably mainly responsible for introducing Palmer and the others to northern European art of the 15th and 16th centuries, which was then relatively little-known in England.  He knew Charles (Karl) Aders, a German businessman living in London who had an important collection of early Northern paintings, including a copy of the ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'', which Linnell enabled the group to visit.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, 18-19, 101-102; Paley, 103-104. Aders' collection was sold in London in 1835; he and his wife were also friends with [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1832 Palmer received a further legacy, with which he bought a cottage in [[St John's Wood]] in London, and thereafter he gradually spent more time in London. The monthly dinners to which Linnell's letter refers were usually held there.  Palmer and Richmond with their wives left together for an extended visit to Italy in 1837, which may be taken as the final end of the group, though most members continued as friends long afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, 108-112&lt;/ref&gt;  The exposure in Italy to art in the classical tradition influenced both artists to move away from Ancient primitivism.  The proximity of Shoreham to the [[Captain Swing]] campaign of insurgency among rural labourers in 1830, which Palmer violently opposed, may have disillusioned him as to the peace and harmony of rural life.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, 106-108&lt;/ref&gt;  Richmond wrote in a letter to Palmer in later life "We all wanted thrashing when in a dream of sentiment we thought we were learning art".&lt;ref&gt;Paley, 118&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yale University Art Gallery]], [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven.]]|293x293px]]'''Andean textiles''' represent a continuing textile tradition spanning from the [[Pre-Columbian era]] to the Colonial era and present day. Textiles have encompassed a variety of functions, including woven textiles for ceremonial clothing, cloth [[armour]], and [[Quipu|record-keeping]]. Cultural emphasis in the textile arts is often based on the spiritual and metaphysical qualities of the origins of material, as well as cosmological and symbolic messages carried by its visual appearance.

Arid desert conditions along the coast of [[Peru]] have preserved dyed textiles dating as old as 6000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/blue-jeans-6000-year-old-peruvian-ancestor|title=Blue jeans have a 6,000 year-old Peruvian ancestor|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most surviving samples of woven textiles exist as funerary bundles. The textile arts were also instrumental in military and utilitarian use, both as armor and as diplomatic tools and exchanged during interpolitical negotiations.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Textiles are also used as a medium of communication, indicating a person's social status and regional affiliation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Traditionally, [[Thread (yarn)|thread]] used for textiles was spun from indigenous [[cotton]] plants, as well as [[alpaca]] and [[llama]] wool. Synthetic threads have since replaced most animal fibers in modern textile arts.

==Origins==

=== Lithic Period ===
The earliest known surviving textiles are samples of fiberwork found in [[Guitarrero Cave]], Peru dating back to 8000 BCE.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49833926|title=Art of the Andes : from Chavín to Inca|last=1958-|first=Stone, Rebecca,|date=2002|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|isbn=9780500203637|edition=2nd |location=London|oclc=49833926}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early fiberwork by the [[Norte Chico civilization|Norte Chico]] civilization consisted of plant fibers that were intertwined and knotted to form baskets and other containers. Surviving examples of finely spun thread and simple cloths indicate that knowledge of spinning and weaving had already been well-established and developed in the area.

[[Mummy|Mummified]] human skeletons dating to this period were stuffed with plant fibers and wrapped in rope and cane, a preservation method invented in the Chilean Chinchoros area around 5000 BC.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/36461413|title=Art of the Andes : from Chavín to Inca|last=1958-|first=Stone, Rebecca,|date=1996|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|others=Jay I. Kislak Reference Collection (Library of Congress)|isbn=0500202869|location=New York|oclc=36461413}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existence of this technology demonstrates early knowledge of spinning naturally occurring fibers into cord.

=== Pre-Ceramic Era ===
Coastal civilizations were the first to create fishnets, and were the first to utilize the [[openwork]] tradition in knotted objects. The fishnets were created through twining, a non-loom technique similar to [[macramé]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Knotting patterns depicting standing humans, parrots, snakes, and cats have been decoded from surviving fragments.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Initial Period ===
The introduction of [[camelid]] herding for their meat, fibrous hair, and ability to transport cargo was developed in response to remarkably inhospitable environmental conditions found in Andean highlands. As a result, [[alpaca]]s and [[llama]]s were revered for their hardiness and ability to provide resources in both life and death.&lt;ref name="Art Institute of Chicago"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26095624|title=The Ancient Americas : art from sacred landscapes|date=1992|publisher=Art Institute of Chicago|others=Townsend, Richard F.,, Aveni, Anthony F.,, Art Institute of Chicago,, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston,, Los Angeles County Museum of Art,|isbn=3791311883|location=Chicago|oclc=26095624}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scaly fibers produced by these animals were both flexible and dye-permeable, allowing them to be woven with cotton to produce sturdy threads and textiles.[[File:Wari cap.jpg|thumb|[https://artgallery.yale.edu/collections/objects/60488 Wari wool-pile cap], 700-900 C.E., [[Yale University Art Gallery]], [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven.]]]][[Chavín culture]] began to emerge around the late Initial Period (c. 900-500 BC). Surviving textiles found from looted burials feature brown dye painted on large, seamed panels of cloth. Textiles from the burials of Karwa are featured as ritual cult center objects, and depict explicitly feminine deities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Chavín culture may have demonstrated the first extensive production of textiles for ritualistic and symbolic purposes.

[[Paracas culture]] rapidly developed the textile industry into a time-intensive and labor-consuming practice. Embroidered and woven textiles became commonplace, featuring consistent repetition and variation of motifs. Nonwoven fabric structures, such as headbands, were created through cross-knit looping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.interweave.com/article/needlework/nasca-cross-knit-looping/|title=Nasca Cross-Knit Looping - Interweave|date=2018-02-14|work=Interweave|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paracas officials adopted the practice of wearing multiple garments in sets, including headbands, turbans, mantles, ponchos, tunics, skirts, and loincloths.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

[[Wari culture|Wari]] fiber arts featured large-scale textiles created in state-sponsored workshops. Political messages of abundance and control were depicted using chaotic geometric imagery and camelid-like figures.&lt;ref name="Art Institute of Chicago"/&gt; Examples of surviving imagery (see image) feature multiple repeating motifs of highly geometric patterns, punctuated with highly expressive color palettes. Scholars have argued that the complexity of such designs broadcast the abilities and abundances of state-controlled resources.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==Woven textiles==
[[File:Nueva coronica.jpg|left|thumb|A page from the [[El primer nueva corónica y buen gobierno]] by [[Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala]], ca. 1600. Traditional Inca weaving, as depicted in Spanish text.]]

=== Manufacturing technique ===
Many textiles, such as baskets and fishing nets, did not require the use of a loom. The Andeans used the [[back strap loom]] to create woven textiles, as chronicled in [[El primer nueva corónica y buen gobierno]]. Several techniques were used to produce fabric, including [[plain weave]], tapestry weave, and scroll weave. Smaller woven pieces produced on the same loom were often stitched together to create a larger fabric. Borders of embroidered tunics and mantles are often decorated with yarn [[tassel]]s or fringe.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://artgallery.yale.edu/press-release/weaving-and-social-world-3000-years-ancient-andean-textiles|title=Weaving and the Social World: 3,000 Years of Ancient Andean Textiles|website=artgallery.yale.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prehistoric Andean weavers pioneered new weaving techniques, such as the triple weave and quadruple weave. The use of fine yarn and consistency in stitch size is remarkable, with analyses counting an average of 250 wefts per inch on average, and some samples exceeding 500 wefts per inch. This is attributed to the regularity in diameter and consistency of thread, as well as maintenance of tension on the loom throughout the entire weaving process.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technologies of Power: The Andean Case|last=Lechtman|first=Heather|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1993|isbn=1461490170|location=|pages=244–280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A combination of [[cotton]] and [[dye]]d camelid threads contribute structural strength and colorful visual imagery to textiles. The scaly hair of camelids is permeable to dye, allowing natural plant-based dyes to be fixed to camelid fibers in the presence of a natural [[mordant]], such as urine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heckman|first=Andrea M.|date=2006|title=Colorful Messages: The Revival of Natural Dyes in Traditional Cuzco Textiles|url=|journal=Textile Society of America Symposium Proceedings|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complex combinations of coloration and patterning were used to repeat geometric patterns while maintaining visual consistency; [[Paracas culture|Paracas]] textiles are especially well known for their regular gridlike arrangement of [[Inca mythology|iconographic]] images. The consistency of scale and shape of these patterns point to the use of counting systems used by textile artisans to record the number of stitches and distance between each geometric pattern.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/31780747|title=To weave for the sun : ancient Andean textiles in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|last=1958-|first=Stone, Rebecca,|date=1994|publisher=Thames and Hudson|others=Paul, Anne., Niles, Susan A., Young-Sánchez, Margaret., Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.|isbn=0500277931|location=London|oclc=31780747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Workshop production ===
[[File:Painted Andean textile.jpg|thumb|[https://artgallery.yale.edu/collections/objects/181312 Chancay or Chimu painted textile], 800-1200 C.E., [[Yale University Art Gallery]], [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven.]]]]
Several different methods of embroidery are attributed to distinctive styles of coloring and depiction of images in woven textiles. Block color, linear, and broad line styles of embroidery imparted different visual effects upon the woven textile, and were used to convey different types of information.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Designs were also painted directly onto woven textiles using various dyes (see figure).

Professional textile artisans in pre-Incan cultures often worked in large workshops with artisans in several specialties. Proximity to other artisans allowed for additional features to be incorporated into plain weave textiles, including [[metal]]lic threads, knotted strings of [[feather]]s, and [[Brocade|brocading]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Textile painting was common practice in the preparation of special cloths for [[Funeral|funerary bundles]] of high-ranking members of society. Pigments such as [[ochre]] and [[cinnabar]] have been used for painting textiles since the [[Early Horizon|Early Horizon period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnard|first=Hans|date=2016|title=Painted textiles: knowledge and technowledge in the Andes|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00776297.2016.1239831|journal=Nawpa Pacha|volume=36|pages=209–228|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Tupu pin.jpg|thumb|245x245px|[https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/309227?sortBy=Relevance&amp;ft=tupu&amp;offset=0&amp;rpp=20&amp;pos=2 Tupu pin], 1400-1533 AD, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City|New York]].|left]]

=== Social significance ===
Intricately woven [[mantle (clothing)|mantle]]s were created to be worn by nobles and elites, both in life and death. Mantles were often extensive and large, averaging 275 [[centimeters]] in length and 130 centimeters in width, and were draped around the neck and over the shoulders.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Women fastened fabrics at the front of the body with a ''tupu'', or shawl pin. The size of the mantle and [[Perspective (graphical)|foreshortening]] effects of imagery contributed to the appearance of the wearer as being "larger than life," serving as explicit status symbols.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Bright dyes served to distinguish social elite from those of lesser status, as undyed fabric worn by commoners was brown. [[Chinchero District|Chinchero]] officers wore red ponchos to signify rank during formal government occasions.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; [[Inca Empire|Inca]] rulers wore a ''llautu'', or tasseled red fringe, on their forehead to demonstrate their status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/315492|title=Male Figurine {{!}} Inca {{!}} The Met|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gifts were also given to conquered territories in ceremonial shows of dominance over the peoples of the region. A region's ability to produce textiles was intricately connected to its success of camelid herding, indicating the value of state-controlled wealth in a territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textilescusco.org/index.php/about-andean-textiles/|title=About Andean Textiles – Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco|website=www.textilescusco.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Burial bundles ===
Woven garments worn during life indicated an individual's social rank, and were often interred with the individual in death. Gift textiles created expressly for funerary purposes were also interred, without being worn in life. Ritual gift objects wrapped in "mummy bundles" include obsidian knives, combs, and balls of thread.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

[[Paracas culture]] practiced mummification by wrapping the deceased in several layers of woven textiles. Over 429 [[funeral bundle]]s containing gift textiles, reams of plain cloth, and various ritual paraphernalia have been excavated from a necropolis at [[Paracas National Reserve#Protected status|Cerro Colorado]]. These artifacts offer the largest source of pre-Columbian Andean textile arts known to date.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/20724087|title=Paracas ritual attire : symbols of authority in ancient Peru|last=Anne.|first=Paul,|date=1990|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=0806122307|location=Norman|oclc=20724087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military use==
While Andean civilizations had knowledge of and were capable of working metal, quilted armor was preferred for its light weight and flexibility. Soldiers depicted by [[Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala]] wear cloth tunics and wind strips of fabric around themselves to create a sturdy armor that allowed for movement while providing defense. The use of cloth rather than metallic armor was also motivated by cultural reasons. The properties of cloth were believed to transfer spiritual reinforcement and power to its wearer, supplying strength and force.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For similar reasons, woven [[Sling (weapon)|slings]] made of plant fibers were the preferred weapons of [[Moche culture|Moche]] civilization, rather than stiff wooden or metallic implements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cloth blankets and tent-making equipment were readily transportable, allowing caches of resources to be delivered to battle frontiers. Storage warehouses containing cloth equipment have been excavated throughout [[Tawantin Suyu]]. Defeated armies forced to retreat often burned all cloth unable to be carried, preventing enemy forces from capturing these valuable stashes.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murra|first=John V.|date=August 1962|title=Cloth and Its Functions in the Inca State|jstor=667788|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=64|pages=710–728|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Colonial Period ==
[[File:Colonial period womens mantle.jpg|thumb|[https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/316892 Woman's mantle], 1600-1700 C.E., [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City|New York.]]]]
The [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire]] resulted in the immigration of Spanish settlers to on the Andean coast. Middle- and upper-class Spanish families recognized the value of finely woven native textiles, and demanded luxury textiles to decorate their own homes. As a result, ''cumbi'', a fine tapestry cloth woven from alpaca fibers, was modified to a Spanish color palette and produced for the homes and churches of settlers.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dressworld.hypotheses.org/363|title="T" is for Cumbi Tapestries: Peruvian Textiles in the Spanish Colonial Home. Julia McHugh, Douglass Foundation Fellow in American Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York|work=DRESSING THE NEW WORLD|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''tornasol'' refers to the style of textile absorbed by Andean weavers after the European context, characterized by a silky texture that appears to change color from different perspectives.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phipps|first=Elena|date=2000|title='Tornesol': a Colonial synthesis of European and Andean textile traditions|url=|journal=Textile Society of America Symposium Proceedings|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Native weavers modified their technique to produce common items for their colonial audience. Bedcovers, table covers, rugs, and wall hangings became popular textile formats in the late 18th century. European influences introduced lace-inspired borders and stylized circular patterns.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

While garments had traditionally been brightly colored and highly patterned, the garments worn by highland Andeans during the Colonial period were characteristically plain and black. This has been interpreted as an act of mourning for the lost Inca empire, but may also be a result of cultural influence imported by arriving Spanish colonists.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;{{clear}}

'''The Architecture of the Tarnovo Artistic School''' is a term for the development of [[architecture]] during the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] (1185–1396).  In the 13th and 14th centuries the capital [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]] determined the progress of the [[Architecture of Bulgaria|Bulgarian architecture]] with many edifices preserved or reconstructed which show the skills of the [[Medieval]] [[Bulgaria]]n architects and the construction and decorative techniques they used. The builders have created a unique architectural style, known as Tarnovian Style (Tarnovo style), that influenced the architecture in many countries of [[Southeastern Europe]] and parts of [[Central Europe]]. With its diverse architecture, the Tarnovo School may be separated into several branches according to the function of the buildings.

== Religious architecture ==

=== Design ===
[[File:Sv.40.M.plan.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A general plan of [[Holy Forty Martyrs Church, Veliko Tarnovo|SS. Forty Martyrs Church]] in Tarnovo]]
During the Second Bulgarian Empire the churches did not have large or complicated designs because they were intended to be a place of penance. Typical of the Tarnovo School of Architecture were relatively small [[cruciform]] dome churches or [[basilica]]s. At the expense of its small length and width, the churches rose to height. They were often built over a stone base around one meter high. As a principle the main entrance was located to the west. After the doorway followed the ''pritvor'' (narthex), the [[Cella|naos]] and the altar. A small rectangular bell-tower sometimes rose above the narthex ("St Dimitar of Solun" in Tarnovo, the Church in the [[Asenova krepost]] in [[Asenovgrad]],  the [[Church of Christ Pantocrator, Nessebar|Church of Christ Pantocrator]] in [[Nessebar]] and others).  The naos could be separated into naves (in the basilicas) with columns or pillars.  According to the number of naves the churches were one-naved ([[Church of St Demetrius of Thessaloniki, Veliko Tarnovo]] in the Asen's Neighbourhood, Tarnovo, [[Boyana Church]]), two-naved ("St [[Ivan of Rila]]" in Trapezitsa, Tarnovo) and three-naved ([[Holy Forty Martyrs Church, Veliko Tarnovo|SS. Forty Martyrs Church]] in Tarnovo, "St Nicola" in [[Melnik, Bulgaria|Melnik]]). In the cruciform dome churches ([[Church of St John Aliturgetos]] and Church of Christ Pantocrator, both in Nessebar) the dome lied over four columns which were connected to the walls with arches. The altar was formed by a semicircular or polygonal apse. In some churches the altar was separated into three parts and the external ones (called ''bema'' and ''diakonnik'') were used for safe-keeping of the church plates, garments and books. In that case there was usually a triple apse. The design was complicated by a pre-apse space. The vaults were semicircular and built of bricks. Some churches had outhouse parts such as galleries (SS. Forty Martyrs Church and "St Peter and Pavel" in Tarnovo), chapels (Boyana Church), ossuaries and others. The Church "St Virgin Maria of Petrich" in the Asenova krepost has two stories and the lower one served as an ossuary.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Старобългарско изкуство", Том ІІ - Никола Мавродинов, издателство "Наука и изкуство", София, 1959 г.&lt;/ref&gt;

A peculiar type of Christian churches were those with a [[triconch]] plan. They are small, one-naved with or without a narthex. Their main peculiarity were the three conchas ([[apse]]s) placed in the eastern, southern and northern walls of the naos. The small dome is laid directly on the walls. The conchal churches can be found mainly in the monasteries and are not so exquisite. Examples include the church in the "St Archangels" Monastery in [[Tran, Bulgaria|Tran]], "St Nicola Mrachki" in the   Peshterski Monastery and others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Decorative ornaments===
[[File:Detail4 BG.jpg|200px|thumb|left|A detail from [[Church of St Demetrius of Thessaloniki, Veliko Tarnovo|Church of St Demetrius of Thessaloniki]], Veliko Tarnovo]]
The main feature of the Tarnovo School of Architecture is the rich decorative ornamentation in exterior of the edifices. The technique that was used was called mixed construction in which belts of stone and bricks alternated with each other. That method was a heritage from the [[Roman architecture]] (opus mixtum) but in that case it had lost its initial constructive application and was used mainly with artistic purpose. The wide plaster fugues also had decorative purpose. The builder chose different types of stone ([[limestone]], [[travertine]], [[marble]], [[granite]]), and the bricks had varied shape and dimensions and were put in different positions forming decorative ornaments and monograms. A cell type method was sometimes used in which each stone block was completely surrounded by bricks. The bricks were painted in red in order to increase the contrast. The facades of the churches were segmented by deep niches (often with two steps) decorated with flying buttresses and archvaults. Unlike the churches in [[Constantinople]] the niches from the Tarnovo School of Architecture do not respond to the interior (pseudo constructive niches) and were used for purely decoratve purpose. As an additional decoration rows of clay circles and four-leaves glazed in green, brown, yellow or orange were used. The origins of that type of decoration are in the Arab architecture. The Nessebar churches "St John Aliturgetos" and "Christ Pantocrator" have especially sumptuous decoration.
[[File:Nesebar - Church of Christ Pantocrator.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Church of Christ Pantocrator, Nesebar]]]]
[[File:Rila 14.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The tower of Hrelyo, 1335 in the Rila Monastery]]
Sometimes the architects used painting to decorate certain elements. The lunettes of the niches of St Dimitar of Solun Church in the capital were plastered up and painted with rhomboid patterns. High on the walls in some churches consoles were built in on which laid small decorative arches. The roofs were covered with tiles or lead plates (the initial cover of St Peter and Pavel in Tarnovo), the dome was narrow and high with circular or polygonal shape. The polygonal domes were characterized with small columns on the corners. The appearance of the churches was complemented with sculptures and paintings.

===Monasteries===

During the 13th and especially during the 14th centuries the construction of monasteries thrived. Small monasteries such as the SS Forty Martyrs Monastery as well as large monastery complexes were constructed. Due to the troubled times many monasteries resembled fortresses. They usually had rectangular shape, the buildings surrounded a yard in which the main church was located. From the outside they had high stone walls reinforced with counterforts, and from the inside there were galleries with several stores which led towards the dwellings of the monks. The monastery complexes also included farm buildings, stores and workshops. Examples of that type are the [[Zograf Monastery]] in [[Athon]]; [[Bachkovo Monastery]] near Asenovgrad or the [[Rila Monastery]]. Although destroyed several times, the overall plan of the later follows the traditions of the Second Bulgarian Empire.

With the growing influence of the [[Hesychasm]], during the 14th century the rock monasteries became widespread. The monk's dwelling and the churches were directly hewn into the rocks. Wooden balconies and stairs were added from which only the cradles in the rocks have survived. That type of monasteries were mainly built in north-eastern Bulgaria along the rivers Ruse Lom, Black Lom and White Lom.

The largest concentrations of monasteries in medieval Bulgaria were in northern [[Stara Planina]] especially around the capital; in the areas to the north and south [[Sofia]]; the southern [[Black Sea]] coast; the area around [[Pirot]] and in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. Many of these were called the small Mount Athon.

== Military architecture ==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Vidin Castle.jpg|thumb|left|The castle in [[Vidin]] on the shores of the [[Danube]].]] --&gt;
During the Second Empire the fortresses were usually built on locations which were difficult to access (hills or plateaus) and thus they sharply differed from the monumental construction in the north-east of the country from the period of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. The walls of the fortresses were built from stones welded together with plaster; they had two faces and the space between them was filled with a mixture of gravel and plaster (blockage). A wooden scaffolding was built from the inside which protected the walls from collapse until the blockage dried up. The height and thickness of the walls varied depending on the terrain and in the different parts of one castle complex they could vary. The top of the walls and the towers had pinnacles. Counterforts were used as additional protection from landslip.
[[File:571px-Vodna kyla.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A scheme of a water tower]]
The tower varied in shape: square, rectangular (the tower in [[Cherven (fortress)|Cherven]]), circular, oval, triangular, horseshoe-shaped or with irregular shape. Depending on their position and functions they were: entrance, defense, edge or water towers. The later were towers-wells, located in the immediate vicinity of a river in such a way that their foundations soaked up water. The immense fortress [[Tsarevets (fortress)|Tsarevets]] in Tarnovo had such water towers. They could be reached by vertical walls from the main stronghold with secret galleries. They were extremely useful during long sieges. In the most difficult place to access in the fortress stood the citadel: a separate rampart in case the outer areas were overrun by the enemy. Examples of such citadels can be found in the castles of [[Shumen]], [[Lovech]], Cherven, [[Ohrid]], [[Devol (Albania)|Devol]]&lt;ref&gt;"Каменните щитове" - Борис Чолпанов, "Военно издателство", София, 1989 г.&lt;/ref&gt; and others. As an additional defense some castles had water-filled moats. A fine example of this is [[Baba Vida]] in [[Vidin]]. In many cases such moat were of no need due to the fine positioning of the fortress. The [[Yantra]] river makes double curve around the two main fortresses in the capital Tarnovo, Tsarevets and Trapezitsa and served as a natural water obstacle. Many other castles were protected in a similar way such as Cherven or [[Prosek]]. Some seaside strongholds ([[Kaliakra]], Nessebar) also had a natural water barrier.
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:The fortress of Shumen in 1981.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A general view of the Shumen castle]] --&gt;
Sometimes the steep rocks were enough defense and walls were built only in vulnerable places. An example of such type of fortress is the [[Belogradchik Fortress]]. Often these ramparts looked like ordinary plateaus or hills and hence they were called "hidden fortresses". Many strongholds if that type guarded the mountain passes of Stara Planina between [[Moesia]] and [[Thrace]].

A peculiar type of defensive facility was the ''pirgos'' (a single tower) called in [[Western Europe]] [[dungeon]]. It was built inside the fortress without any links to the other edifices. It served as a last refuge for the defenders in case the other parts of the fortress had fallen. Examples for ''pirgos'' in the country are the ruins in [[Matochina]] (near the [[Tundzha]] river), the tower in the Sadovo monastery and the Tower of Hrelyo in the Rila monastery built in 1335 which is completely preserved. It is 23,60 meters high and has five storeys. A cellar is located in its foundations. There was also a well which supplied the defenders with fresh water during sieges. Reinforced counterforts supported the tower. They merge with brick arches and serve as a base for the Transfiguration of God Chapel located at the top of the tower. Most of the ''pirgos'' usually had four or five storeys. In the monastery ''pirgos'' the most valuable objects (the treasury and the donations) were kept as well as the [[library]].

Military architecture had purely functional purpose. The builder did not follow aesthetic criteria and rarely constructed decorative elements on the fortifications. In fact many castles were part of large defensive systems which covered the frontier regions or ran along the middle of the country. The most important fortification systems were along the Danube to the north, Stara Planina in the Middle, Black Sea to the east, the [[Rhodopes]] to the south and Macedonia to the south-west. Apart from the capital Tarnovo, the major Bulgarian fortresses included Vidin, [[Silistra]], Shumen, Cherven, [[Lovech]], Sofia, Plovdiv, [[Lyutitsa]], Ustra, Ohrid, [[Skopie]], [[Bitola]] and many others.

== Palace construction and urban planning ==
[[File:Medieval Tarnovo map SVG.svg|right|thumb|250px|Map of medieval Tarnovo]]
The defensive system of Tarnovo was impressive. The Medieval capital had three fortified hills: Tsarevets, Trapezitsa and Momina Krepost (Devingrad). Numerous monasteries nestled on the Sveta Gora heights. Between the hills were situated several neighbourhoods: the New City (Asenova mahala); the quarter of the foreign merchants (Frazgrad) and the [[Jew]] quarter; they were all surrounded by walls. The palaces of the Emperors and the Patriarch were located on the most heavily fortified hill, Tsarevets and both resembled a small citadel in way.
[[File:Dvorec.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The ruins of the Royal Palace in Tarnovo]]
The Imperial Palace was initially a bolyar castle and underwent two major reconstruction under [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen II]] (1218–1241) and [[Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria|Ivan Alexander]] (1331–1371). In its final appearance it was a small fortress with approximately oval shape. The thickness of its walls reached two meters. The entrance gates were guarded by round and rectangular towers, the main entrance was located in the round tower of the northern facade. The north-western edge tower was particularly massive. From the inside the edifices were built around an inner yard with richly decorated royal church in the middle. Due to the rugged terrain some buildings had two and others had three storeys.
[[File:Tarnovo Vaznesenie.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The [[Patriarchal Cathedral of the Holy Ascension of God]] in the Patriarch Palace]]
The Patriarch Palace rising on the highest point of Tsarevets dominated the city. Its plan resembled those of the Imperial Palace. Thick walls surrounded the patio in which the cruciform dome Ascension of God Church was situated. The foundations of two round towers have been excavated one in the northern and the other in the southern parts of the palace. The main entrance was in the western rectangular tower. A four-cornered bell-tower was adjoined to the [[Patriarchal Cathedral of the Holy Ascension of God]] whose architecture design is unique for [[South-eastern Europe]]. The residential and office sections were located in the southern part.

The construction of the palaces was from stone soldered with plaster. Large stone blocks were used only in some places unlike the buildings from Pliska and Preslav. From the outside they had austere and monumental appearance. For the imposing edifices the architects used mixed construction methods and decorative elements similar to those from the churches. Unfortunately due to the heavy damage they suffered, it is not possible to be restored the overall appearance of the palaces for certain. Some premises were richly decorated with [[mosaic]]s and mural paintings and probably served for audiences and Royal apartments. The use of stone inscriptions from [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] which were embedded into the walls was characteristic of the architecture of the Tarnovo School of Architecture. Most of them came from the ancient Roman town of [[Nicopolis ad Istrum]] located at 18&amp;nbsp;km to the north of Tarnovo. That feature impressed the Bulgarian [[Catholic]] [[archbishop]] Peter Bogdan who wrote an interesting description of Tsarevets in 1640.

On the hill there were also shops, workshops, warehouses and dwelling which probably belonged to the craftsmen and the servants. The narrow streets were covered with cobbles. The foundations of churches, water tanks and bolyar houses have been excavated. The walls which are 12 meters high follow the crown of the hill. The main gate was situated in the western section of the fortress and was defended by a complex fortification which included three towers, three gates and a drawbridge above the steep cliffs. Tsarevets had five more gates. There were also secret underground passages. Below the heights, along the river was built a second wall ring which surrounded the hill. In the vicinity of the Great Lavra monastery were discovered the foundations of a stone bridge which spanned over the Yantra river.

In a similar way was organized the defensive system of the other large hill Trapezitsa. It was surrounded by thick walls and many tower and had six gates. The foundations of a ''pirgos'' and 17 churches have been found during excavations.

During the 13th and 14th centuries Tarnovo had around 30,000 inhabitants and was the second largest city in the [[Balkan peninsula]] after the [[Byzantine]] capital Constantinople.

== Residential architecture ==

The abodes during the Second Bulgarian Empire can be generally separated into two major types depending on the social status of their inhabitants.

===Bolyar houses===
[[File:Boliar.dom.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A bolyar house, Tsarevets]]
The general type of the bolyar houses between the 13th and 14th centuries is difficult to determine because of the lack of enough architecture data. To the north of the Royal Palace in Tsarevets were excavated the foundations of a bolyar house from the beginning of the 13th century. Its general plan was Г-shaped and consisted of residential and economic part. High stone walls closed the yard from the other sides. The residential edifice had two floors. The first floor was built of stone and separated into three identical rooms, the middle of which looked towards the yard; there was the door. The marble bases of the two columns which supported the second floor and parts of the staircase have been preserved. The second floor was with bow-windows and the room in the middle was probably open-air. The economic section had one floor and was segmented into several parts and had veranda looking to the yard. In the south-western edge are visible the foundations of a small family church with one nave. The bolyar house in Melnik has a similar plan and is also dated from the 14th century.

===Mass dwelling===
[[File:Jilishta.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Foundations of overground houses in Tarnovo]]
From the Second Bulgarian Empire there are basically two types of mass dwellings: semi-dug houses (semi dug-out) and overground houses. The semi-dug dwelling can be also divided into two types: evenly dug in (around 150&amp;nbsp;cm) and dug in inclined terrain, in that cases the rear was fully under the ground and the front was exposed. The first type was built with timber and covered with straw or reed. Similar dwellings were known from the First Bulgarian Empire too. The second type of houses were built of stones soldered with mud (in the parts over the ground) and the roof was made of timber. The depth of dug-in reached two meters and the door was from the exposed part. The floor was covered with bricks or plastered up with clay. A furnace was used for heating and the smoke came out from an opening on the roof. Such dwellings are found in the western slopes of Momina Krepost and on the slopes of the Tsarevets hill. These houses had a very slow evolution, their root were from 8th to 12th century and continued to be used during the period of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] domination.&lt;ref&gt;Царстващият град Търновград. Археологически проучвания.", съставители Атанас Попов и Йордан Алексиев, издателство "Наука и изкуство", София, 1985 г.&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of that type are the semi-dug houses built entirely of stone which had a second floor. The most common type of houses in the Medieval Bulgarian towns were the overground houses. Their ruins have been found in Tarnovo, Shumen, Lovech, Cherven. They were usually with two storeys and one or two rooms. They were built on a previously leveled ground closely adjoining each other and were usually without yards. They were built of stones soldered with mud or plaster. The roof was probably made of timber. Their inhabitants were probably craftsmen or servants of the [[aristocracy]]. The ground floors were used for shops and workshops.

'''Blut und Ehre''' (English: "Blood and Honor") was a German [[Nazism|National Socialist]] (Nazi) political slogan that was used by the [[Hitler Youth]], among others.

The terms "Blood and Honor" were constitutive concepts of the "Nordic-German Racial Spirit" to [[Alfred Rosenberg]], who developed them in his work ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century|The Myth of the 20th Century]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz Schreckenberg: ''Erziehung, Lebenswelt und Kriegseinsatz der deutschen Jugend unter Adolf Hitler.'' LIT, Münster 2001. {{ISBN|3-8258-4433-1}}. pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Through Rosenberg's ''Myth'', these terms found an entry into the thinking of the Hitler Youth.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz Schreckenberg: ''Erziehung, Lebenswelt und Kriegseinsatz der deutschen Jugend unter Adolf Hitler.'' LIT, Münster 2001. {{ISBN|3-8258-4433-1}}. pg. 213&lt;/ref&gt; Four of the collected essays of Rosenberg published between 1936 and 1941 dealt with this concept.

Many Germans knew the terms in this combination that was used by the Hitler Youth. "Blood and Honor" was the title of a songbook. The motto was also embossed in the [[belt buckle]] of the Hitler Youth uniform, and between 1933 and 1938 it was also engraved on the blade of the [[Hitler Youth knife|Hitler Youth's pocketknife]].

In Germany, the use of this slogan is legally considered to be a use of a [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|symbol of an unconstitutional organization]], and is subject to legal penalty.&lt;ref&gt;Roman Trips-Hebert: ''[http://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/analysen/2009/Kennzeichen_verfassungswidriger_Organisationen.pdf Das strafbare Verwenden von Kennzeichen verfassungswidriger Organisationen - § 86a StGB im Spiegel der Rechtsprechung]''. Berlin 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a judgement of the Federal Court of Justice in 2009, the use of the English translation "Blood and Honour" is not subject to legal penalty.&lt;ref&gt;[[faz.net]] 13. August 2009: [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/bgh-urteil-nazi-parolen-in-fremder-sprache-nicht-strafbar-1838198.html ''Nazi-Parolen in fremder Sprache nicht strafbar''] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[BGHSt]] 54, S. 61–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The motto has been used in translation by several different [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] organisations. [[Blood &amp; Honour|Blood and Honour]] is an international network of neo-Nazi musical groups. The motto has also been used, in modified form, by followers of [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] party in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/04/greece-golden-dawn-not-political-party "Greece's Golden Dawn isn't a political party – it's more like a criminal gang"] guardian.co.uk vom 4.

'''''British Masters''''' is a three-part [[BBC]] television series on 20th century [[British art]], presented by [[James Fox (art historian)|Dr James Fox]] and first broadcast in July 2011 on [[BBC Four]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2011/03_march/30/arts.shtml#panel1 ''British Masters,'' BBC4 Press Office]&lt;/ref&gt; The series covers the period from 1910 to 1975.

The first programme explored the lives and works of [[Mark Gertler (artist)|Mark Gertler]], [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]], [[Walter Sickert]], [[Wyndham Lewis]], [[Lawrence Atkinson]], [[David Bomberg]], [[Christopher R. W. Nevinson|Richard Nevinson]], [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and [[Stanley Spencer]]. The second programme explored the works of [[John Nash (artist)|John Nash]], Stanley Spencer, [[Alfred Munnings]], [[William Coldstream]], Paul Nash and [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]]. In the third programme, subtitled 'A New Jerusalem,' Fox explored British art in the aftermath of the 2nd world war, and examined the works of [[Lucian Freud]], [[Graham Sutherland]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)| Francis Bacon]], [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[David Hockney]] and [[Keith Vaughan]]. In this final programme of the series Fox explored how the themes of evil, brutality, dehumanisation, consumerism and optimism can be seen in the works of these postwar artists. Fox contends in this programme that the death of Lucian Freud and the emergence of [[conceptual art]] have marginalised, eclipsed and brought to an end the tradition of British figurative painting.

In each case, the backgrounds, techniques, subjects and interests of each artist are analysed against a backdrop of the social and political events of their day, especially the two world wars, the decline of Edwardian values and traditions, the poverty and economic turmoil of the 1920s and 1930s and the relative sense of optimism following both wars. The programmes also reflect a personal and national search for security in enduring but elusive British values, beliefs and identity in what Fox depicts as a century of crisis and upheaval, in which much more had perhaps been lost than gained.

Fox's provocative approach seems to have divided the critics: [[The Times]] called the series "superb television;"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/tv-radio/article3092882.ece David Chater, ''Monday's TV: British Masters,'' The Times 16 July 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Observer]] called it "absurdly lucid,"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jul/17/torchwood-the-night-watch-review Euan Ferguson, ''Rewind TV,'' ''The Observer'', 17 July 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; but one critic criticised the series for its "grandiose, inflammatory statements,"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8640837/British-Masters-BBC-Four-The-Night-Watch-BBC-Two-review.html John Preston, ''British Masters'', BBC Four, The Night Watch, BBC Two, review, ''The Telegraph'', 15 July 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; while Fisun Güner described Fox's revisionist case as "ludicrous."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartsdesk.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=4089:british-masters-bbc-4-/-the-worlds-most-expensive-paintings-bbc-1&amp;Itemid=27 Güner, Fisun, ''British Masters, BBC Four/ The World's Most Expensive Paintings,'' BBC One, 12 July 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bursledon Brickworks Industrial Museum''', often shortened to '''Bursledon Brickworks''' is a volunteer-run [[brickworks]] [[museum]] based in the village of [[Swanwick, Hampshire|Swanwick]], [[Hampshire]], England. It is thought to be the last Victorian steam-driven brickworks left in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fareham.gov.uk/leisure/discover_fareham/bbrickworks.aspx|title=Bursledon Brickworks|last=Info|first=Webmaster|date=|website=www.fareham.gov.uk|publisher=Fareham Borough Council|access-date=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.erih.net/i-want-to-go-there/site/show/bursledon-brickworks-industrial-museum/|title=ERIH: Bursledon Brickworks Industrial Museum|last=|first=|date=|work=www.erih.net|access-date=7 December 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brick kiln, chimney, drying sheds, and the boiler and engine house at the south section of the brickworks are [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed Grade II*]] as a group on the [[National Heritage List for England]].&lt;ref name=NHLE&gt;{{NHLE|num=1233725|desc=Brick kiln, chimney, drying sheds, boiler and engine house at Bursledon Brickworks|access-date=11 March 2018|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==

===Edward Hooper===
Bursledon Brickworks started out in 1897 as ''Hooper &amp; Ashby'', a [[Southampton]]-based builders' merchants, who also made bricks. The company was co-founded by the Ashby's and the Hooper's two separate [[Quakers|Quaker]] families, both hailing from the town of [[Staines-upon-Thames|Staines]] in [[Middlesex]] (now part of the county of [[Surrey]]). Edward Hooper, who moved to Southampton at the age of 26 was a civil engineer and architect. In the 1851 census records, Edward is described as being both an engineer and a brick maker. He takes out a lease on Baltic Wharf in Chapel Road. It is here that Edward sets up a business as a builders' merchant and a manufacturer trading in slate. This is followed by the expansion of his business, when he takes out a lease on a second building, American Wharf, nine-years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=THE BRICKWORKS MUSEUM AT BURSLEDON A HISTORY AND GUIDE|last=|first=|publisher=Hampshire Buildings Preservation Trust|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- see this link at the bottom of the article (http://www.bursledonbrickworks.org.uk/history) --&gt;

===Hooper &amp; Ashby===
In 1903, ''Hooper &amp; Ashby'' changed its name to ''The Bursledon Brick Co. Limited'' or ''(B.B.C. Ltd.),'' this coincided with the extension of the southern complex with the addition of the northern complex. This was further extended in 1935. With the extra capacity, the brickworks was producing in excess of 20 million bricks a year. They were one of the main producers of bricks in the region.&lt;ref name="Collections - Museum Buildings"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bursledonbrickworks.org.uk/page.php?pageid=15 | title=The History | publisher=Bursledon Brickworks | work=www.bursledonbrickworks.org.uk | accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the original machinery was moved to the Swanwick site from Chandler's Ford.

==Sport==
{{Expand section|date=March 2017}}
On 20 March, Bursledon Brickworks F.C. beat [[North Warnborough]] 4–1 in the semi-finals of the 1926 Hants Junior Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nwcfsa.co.uk/centenary/|title=North Warnborough F.C. 1895-1995 (A Centenary Tribute by Anne Pitcher MBA)|last=Pitcher|first=Anne|date=|website=www.nwcfsa.co.uk|publisher=North Warnborough F.C.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Go to page 14 of 32 for N. Warborough vs B. Brickworks --&gt; The cricket team, Lower Swanwick B.C.C. won the Sarisbury and District Cricket League Division 2 championship shield.

==Post-war period==
{{Expand section|date=March 2017}}
After the [[World War II|Second World War]], the family business was amalgamated with the Sussex and Dorking Brick Company and in 1959 became [[Redland plc|Redland Holdings Ltd.]]&lt;!-- see this link at the bottom of the article (http://www.bursledonbrickworks.org.uk/history) --&gt;

==Closure of the brickworks==
The brickworks finally closed in 1974, and the site was later saved from demolition by the ''Hampshire Buildings Preservation Trust''. The south section of Bursledon Brickworks which houses the brick kiln, chimney, drying sheds, boiler and engine house are [[Listed building#Grade II|Grade II*]] listed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1233725|title=BRICK KILN, CHIMNEY, DRYING SHEDS, BOILER AND ENGINE HOUSE AT BURSLEDON BRICKWORKS SOUTH SECTION|last=|first=|date=|website=Historic England|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The north section was demolished and the land was acquired by the [[NATS Holdings|National Air Traffic Services]]. ''NATS'' operate the [[London Area Control Centre]] and [[London Terminal Control Centre]]. As site owners, they have provided funding for the [[Swanwick, Hampshire|Swanwick]] Lakes Wildlife Reserve project managed by the [[Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fareham.gov.uk/leisure/discover_fareham/swanwicklake.aspx|title=Swanwick Lakes Wildlife Reserve|last=|first=|date=|website=www.fareham.gov.uk|publisher=Fareham Borough Council|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charity status==
The Bursledon Brickworks Trust which ran from July 1997 – February 2007 was replaced by the Bursledon Brickworks Museum Trust in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityFramework.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1170043&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|title=BURSLEDON BRICKWORKS MUSEUM TRUST|last=|first=|date=|website=apps.charitycommission.gov.uk|publisher=Charity Commission|access-date=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a museum==
In 2012, the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] granted the museum funding of £666,300&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/9993087.Brickworks____666_000_bonanza/?ref=rss|title=Bursledon Brickworks £666,000 lottery bonanza|last=Phillips|first=Bethan|date=18 October 2012|website=www.dailyecho.co.uk/news|publisher=''Southern Daily Echo''|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to open up the first floor of the building, create two more education spaces and employ some paid staff. Project manager Carolyne Haynes said: “We’re always under threat, in that it’s a big building that’s permanently trying to fall down and we’re permanently trying to keep it open, running it with volunteers. The most important thing about this money is we’ll be able to pay some staff to make sure we can open three days a week – that will give us a regular opening time.

“The place deserves to be recognised nationally and this is a big first step towards that.”

The grant will also help pay for improved disabled access for the museum, in Coal Park Lane, Swanwick.

Head of the South-East’s Heritage Lottery Fund, Stuart McLeod, said: “Our industrial heritage is something we should be hugely proud of – it helped build the world we live in today. Bursledon Brickworks is the perfect example of this and an incredible survivor of its time.”

==Collections==
At the heart of the museum, and the heart of the collection, is the original brick making machinery, steam engine and related smaller equipment, such as barrows, shovels and wagons, once used at Bursledon Brickworks. The steam engine and machinery were restored about 20 years ago and are operated on special events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bursledonbrickworks.org.uk/collections|title=Collections|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bursledonbrickworks.org.uk|publisher=Bursledon Brickworks|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.strollingguides.co.uk/books/hampshire/places/brickworks.php|title=Bursledon Brickworks Industrial Museum|last=Houghton|first=Anthony|date=|website=www.strollingguides.co.uk/books/hampshire/places/brickworks.php|publisher=Strolling Guides|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrance to and from the site==
[[File:Coal_Park_Lane_sign.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Coal Park Lane entrance in February 2017]] &lt;!-- [[File:Swanwick_ Lane_sign.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Swanwick Lane entrance in March 2017]] --&gt; 
The brickworks has two entrances to the site, the first on Swanwick Lane. This entrance is used by the general public and has a car park. This is also where coaches drop off passengers (group visits) and the rear entrance on Coal Park Lane. The Coal Park Lane entrance is mainly used by the staff and/or volunteers based at the site, and is where deliveries are overseen.

==Radio and television==
Back in July 2015, [[BBC Radio Solent]] presenter [[Nick Girdler]] visited the brickworks. Here he oversaw the unveiling of a new brick sculpture, affectionately known as ''the Twisted Shard''. The structure which took 5 months to build was designed by local brick lecturer and artist Joe Taylor from [[Woolston, Southampton]], in partnership with [[Michelmersh|Michelmersh Brick Holdings]]. He enlisted the help of some of his [[Southampton City College]] students to aid in the construction of ''the Twisted Shard''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/leisure/news/13424506.Brickie_s_artwork_to_be_unveiled_at_festival/|title=Brickie's artwork to be unveiled at festival|last=|first=|date=16 July 2015|website=www.dailyecho.co.uk/leisure|publisher=''[[Southern Daily Echo]]''|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbhplc.co.uk/twisted-shard-multi-sensory-brick-design|title=The Twisted Shard a multi-sensory brick design|last=|first=|date=22 June 2015|website=www.mbhplc.co.uk|publisher=Michelmersh Brick Holdings PLC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jtaylorbuild.com/index.php/projects/|title=Projects|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=J Taylor Brickwork &amp; Building Contractors|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that same year, the brickworks was featured in the last five minutes of the [[South Today|BBC]]'s – ''VE Day: First Days of Peace'' documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet |user=BursledonBrickW|author=Bursledon Brickworks|number=598771182549217280|date=14 May 2015|title=Bursledon Brickworks on Twitter: We are in the last five minutes of BBC - VE day #ManorFarmCP and #MilestonesHCT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, a five-minute segment on Bursledon Brickworks featured on Series 14: Episode 6 of the [[BBC One]] television programme [[Antiques Road Trip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.bursledonbrickworks.org.uk/venue | title=Venue Hire | website=www.bursledonbrickworks.org.uk | publisher=The Brickworks Industrial Museum | access-date=11 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, the museum welcomed [[Wine tasting|wine connoisseur]] [[Master of Wine|Peter Richards]] from [[Saturday Kitchen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet |user=wineschools|author=Peter Richards MW|number=827790512505634818|date=4 February 2017|title=On today's @SaturdayKitchen I get excited about bricks.

[[UNESCO]]'s '''City of Literature''' programme is part of a wider [[Creative Cities Network]] which was launched in 2004 and is currently made up of 180 UNESCO Creative Cities globally. Members are drawn from 72 countries and cover seven creative fields: Crafts &amp; Folk Art, Design, Film, Gastronomy, Literature, Music, and Media Arts.&lt;ref name = "WCCN"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/creativity/creative-cities-network/about-creative-cities/ UNESCO What is the Creative Cities Network?]&lt;/ref&gt; The Network was born out of UNESCO's Global Alliance for Cultural Diversity initiative which was created in 2002. The Creative City Network’s aim is to "promote the social, economic and cultural development of cities in both the developed and the developing world." The cities in the network promote their local creative scene and conform to UNESCO’s goal of fostering cultural diversity. They recognise past, present and future: a strong cultural heritage, a vibrant and diverse contemporary cultural scene, and aspirations to extend culture to the next generation at home and to other cities in a global partnership.&lt;ref name = "WCCN"/&gt; {{As of|2017}}, 28 cities have been designated as part of the City of Literature programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Macdonald |first=Moira |date=31 October 2017 |title=UNESCO declares Seattle a City of Literature |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/books/unesco-declares-seattle-a-city-of-literature/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNESCO Cities of Literature network of 28 cities&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofliterature.com/international-cities-of-literature/how-it-began/ How It Began]&lt;/ref&gt; represents 6 continents and 23 countries, and a combined population of over 26 million.

==Criteria for Cities of Literature==
To be approved as a City of Literature, cities need to meet a number of criteria set by UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/creativity/creative-cities-network/literature/ Do you have what it takes to be a City of Literature?]&lt;/ref&gt; Designated UNESCO Cities of Literature share similar characteristics:
*Quality, quantity and diversity of publishing in the city
*Quality and quantity of educational programmes focusing on domestic or foreign literature at primary, secondary and tertiary levels
*Literature, drama and/or poetry playing an important role in the city
*Hosting literary events and festivals which promote domestic and foreign literature; 
*Existence of libraries, bookstores and public or private cultural centres which preserve, promote and disseminate domestic and foreign literature
*Involvement by the publishing sector in translating literary works from diverse national languages and foreign literature
*Active involvement of traditional and new media in promoting literature and strengthening the market for literary products.

Cities submit bids to UNESCO to be designated a City of Literature.  The designations are monitored and reviewed every four years by UNESCO.

'''Colonial architecture''' is an architectural style from a mother country that has been incorporated into the buildings of settlements or colonies in distant locations. Colonists frequently built settlements that synthesized the architecture of their countries of origin with the design characteristics of their new lands, creating hybrid designs.&lt;ref name="ovaita"&gt;{{cite book |last=Guaita |first=Ovidio |year=1999 |title=On distant shores: colonial houses around the world |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8BRUAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=world+colonial+architecture&amp;dq=world+colonial+architecture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=obfkUqKfFIqKiQfB2oFA&amp;redir_esc=y |location= |publisher=Monacelli Press |isbn=9781580930512 |accessdate=January 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conditioned taste aversion''' occurs when an animal associates the [[taste]] of a certain food with symptoms caused by a [[toxicity|toxic]], spoiled, or [[poison]]ous substance. Generally, taste aversion is developed after ingestion of food that causes [[nausea]], [[disease|sickness]], or vomiting. The ability to develop a taste aversion is considered an [[Adaptation|adaptive trait]] or survival mechanism that trains the body to avoid poisonous substances (e.g., poisonous berries) before they can cause harm. The association reduces the probability of consuming the same substance (or something that tastes similar) in the future, thus avoiding further poisoning. It is an example of [[classical conditioning|classical or "Pavlovian" conditioning]].

Studies on conditioned taste aversion which involved irradiating rats were conducted in the 1950s by [[John Garcia (psychologist)|Dr. John Garcia]],&lt;ref&gt;Garcia J, Kimeldorf DJ, Koelling RA. Conditioned aversion to saccharin resulting from exposure to gamma radiation. ''Science'' 1955; 122(3160): 157-8.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to it sometimes being called the '''Garcia effect'''.

Conditioned taste aversion sometimes occurs when sickness was merely coincidental and not related to the substance that caused the sickness. For example, a person who becomes very sick after consuming vodka-and-orange-juice cocktails may then become averse to the taste of orange juice, even though the sickness was caused by the over-consumption of alcohol. Under these circumstances, conditioned taste aversion is sometimes known as the '''"[[Sauce Bearnaise|Sauce-Bearnaise]] Syndrome"''', a term coined by [[Martin Seligman|Seligman]] and Hager.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, M. E. P. &amp; Hager, J. L. (1972, August). Biological boundaries of learning. The sauce-bearnaise syndrome. ''Psychology Today'', ''V6'', 59-61, 84-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Garcia's study ==

While studying the effects of radiation on various behaviors in the mid to late 1950s, Dr. John Garcia noticed that rats developed an aversion to substances consumed prior to being irradiated. To examine this, Garcia put together a study in which three groups of rats were given sweetened water followed by either no radiation, mild radiation, or strong radiation. When rats were subsequently given a choice between sweetened water and regular tap water, rats who had been exposed to radiation drank much less sweetened water than those who had not. Specifically, the total consumption of sweetened water for the no-radiation, mild radiation and strong radiation rats was 80%, 40% and 10%, respectively.

This finding ran contrary to much of the learning literature of the time in that the aversion could occur after just a single trial and over a long delay. Garcia proposed that the sweetened water became regarded negatively because of the nausea inducing effects of the radiation, and so began the study of conditioned taste aversion.

Many scientists were skeptical of Garcia's findings because it did not follow the basic principles of classical conditioning. However, Garcia replicated his results multiple times. He demonstrated that the particular stimulus used in classical conditioning does matter. An internal stimulus produced an internal response while an external stimulus produced an external response; but an external stimulus would not produce an internal response and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hockenbury|first=Don H. Hockenbury, Sandra E.|title=Discovering psychology|year=2010|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4292-1650-0|pages=197|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notes ==

Taste aversion does not require cognitive awareness to develop&amp;mdash;that is, the subject does not have to consciously recognize a connection between the perceived cause (the taste) and effect (the negative feeling). In fact, the subject may ''hope'' to enjoy the substance, but the body handles it reflexively. Conditioned taste aversion illustrates the argument that in classical conditioning, a response is elicited.

Also, taste aversion generally only requires one trial.  The experiments of [[Ivan Pavlov]] required several pairings of the neutral stimulus (e.g., a ringing bell) with the unconditioned stimulus (i.e., meat powder) before the neutral stimulus elicited a response. With taste aversion, after one association between sickness and a certain food, the food may thereafter elicit the response. In addition, lab experiments generally require very brief (less than a second) intervals between a neutral stimulus and an unconditioned stimulus. With taste aversion, however, the hotdog a person eats at lunch may be associated with the vomiting that person has in the evening.

If the flavor has been encountered before the subject becomes ill, the effect will not be as strong or will not be present. This quality is called [[latent inhibition]]. Conditioned taste aversion is often used in laboratories to study gustation and learning in rats.

Aversions can also be developed to odors as well as to tastes.

Common vampire bats (''Desmodus rotundus'') do not learn taste aversions despite being closely related to other species of bats that do.&lt;ref name=Ratcliffe2002&gt;{{Ratcliffe John. [https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0003347203920598/1-s2.0-S0003347203920598-main.pdf?_tid=f60c7f4e-ffd7-11e7-af92-00000aacb361&amp;acdnat=1516669047_f53b3148c97194c238a9a7088848404c "An exception to the rule: common vampire bats do not learn taste aversions"], ''[[Animal Behaviour]]'', Ontario, 21 May 2002. Retrieved on 22 January 2018.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diet of common vampire bats only consists of vertebrate blood and therefore it is hypothesized that the development of a taste aversion to their only food source would not be advantageous for these animals.&lt;ref name=Ratcliffe2002 /&gt;

== In humans ==

Taste aversion is fairly common in humans. When humans eat bad food (e.g., spoiled meat) and get sick, they may find that food aversive until [[extinction (psychology)|extinction]] occurs, if ever. Also, as in nature, a food does not have to ''cause'' the sickness for it to become aversive. A human who eats [[sushi]] for the first time and who happens to come down with an unrelated stomach virus may still develop a taste aversion to sushi. Even something as obvious as riding a roller coaster (causing nausea) after eating the sushi will influence the development of taste aversion to sushi. Humans might also develop aversions to certain types of alcohol because of vomiting during intoxication.

Taste aversion is a common problem with [[chemotherapy]] patients, who become nauseated because of the drug therapy but associate the nausea with consumption of food.

==  Applications ==

Taste aversion has been demonstrated in a wide variety of both captive and free-ranging predators.  In these studies, animals that consume a bait laced with an undetectable dose of an aversion agent avoid both baits and live prey with the same taste and scent as the baits.  When predators detect the aversion agent in the baits, they quickly form aversions to the baits, but discriminate between these and different-tasting live prey.

== Stimulus generalization ==

Stimulus generalization is another learning phenomenon that can be illustrated by conditioned taste aversion. This phenomenon demonstrates that we tend to develop aversions even to types of food that resemble the foods which cause us illness. For example, if one eats an orange and gets sick, one might also avoid eating [[tangerine]]s and [[clementine]]s because they look similar to oranges, and might lead one to think that they are also dangerous.

Stimulus generalization operates in most facets of animal and human life far beyond food tastes and aversion. Trauma and negative reinforcement of all kinds create aversion of other negative reaction to generalizations from the adverse event or events.  And like taste aversion, the generalization may or not be conscious.  Stimulus generalization is a factor in most "superstitious behavior", racism and prejudice of all kinds.

== Compared with taste avoidance==

Although the terms "taste avoidance" and "taste aversion" are often used interchangeably, studies with rats indicate they are not necessarily synonymous. "Aversion" is defined as "a strong dislike or disinclination"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/aversion "Aversion"]. Oxford Dictionaries. Oxford University Press. Retrieved 5 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and "avoidance" is defined as "stopping oneself from doing".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/avoid "Avoid"]. Oxford Dictionaries. Oxford University Press. Retrieved 5 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The difference is that in avoidance, the organism is controlling its behavioural responses. Taste avoidance and taste aversion can at times go hand in hand, but they cannot be looked at or be defined the same way.

Studies on rats to determine how they react to different tasting liquids and injections indicate this difference. Scientists measured the facial and somatic reactions of rats after exposure to a flavored solution (sucrose or salt) which do not induce abnormal feelings. However, immediately after the rat ingests the solution, the rat is injected with a drug that induces nausea. The rat subsequently expresses a disgust reaction towards the solution, seen by mouth gaping. This is a [[Classical conditioning|Pavlovian conditioned response]] as the rat is associating the disgust with the solution that it drank immediately before the injection. The rat experiences taste ''aversion''.  This is similar to when a human, for example, eats a steak that is perfectly safe and edible and coincidentally contracts a stomach bug and starts vomiting within a few hours of eating the steak. Although the human may know that the vomiting was due to a virus and not from eating the steak, the conditioned response in the brain associates the steak with vomiting due to the timing and the human may avoid steak because he has developed a learned taste aversion to the steak.

When examining taste avoidance, however, the rat may avoid a food yet still enjoy it and choose it over others. In further tests, the rats were tested with another sucrose solution but this time it was paired with a drug that gave positive, euphoric effects, such as [[amphetamine]], [[cocaine]], and [[morphine]].  The rats showed positive reactions to the drugs.  However, rats react to any change in physiological state as a sign of danger  and avoided approaching these solutions. When one of these euphoric solutions was placed next to another solution that had a learned taste aversion, the rat would choose the substance that it had a taste avoidance towards. Scientists theorize that in terms of evolution, because rats are unable to vomit and immediately purge toxins, rats have developed a strong "first line of defense", which is their sense of taste and smell. This further shows the importance of taste and the correlation between taste and any change in physiological state, whether it be good or bad. Because rats rely upon taste and pairing it with a reaction rather than relying on later responses that involve the [[gastrointestinal tract]], taste avoidance is just as prevalent as taste aversion, though the two don't necessarily go hand in hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Linda A.

A '''cosmorama''' is an exhibition of [[perspective picture]]s of different places in the world, usually world [[landmark]]s. Careful use of illumination and lenses gives the images greater realism.

Cosmorama was also the name of an entertainment in 19th century London, at 207-209 [[Regent Street]], at which the public could view scenes of distant lands and exotic subjects through optical devices that magnified the pictures. It was later converted into an exhibition of curiosities named the [[Prince of Wales Bazaar]]. Exhibits included a sea lion, a sea serpent and L. Bertolotto's [[Flea circus]].

A '''digital camera''' or '''digicam''' is a [[camera]] that captures [[photograph]]s in [[digital memory]]. Most cameras produced today are digital,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/11/AR2006011102323.html |title=Nikon Says It's Leaving Film-Camera Business| accessdate=2007-02-23 | date=2006-01-12 | publisher=Washington Post | first=Mike | last=Musgrove}}&lt;/ref&gt; and while there are still dedicated digital cameras, many more are now incorporated into devices ranging from [[mobile device]]s to vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;https://fstoppers.com/news/nikon-closes-china-camera-factory-cites-smartphones-cause-201773 Nikon Closes China Camera Factory, Cites Smartphones as Cause&lt;/ref&gt; However, high-end, high-definition dedicated cameras are still commonly used by professionals.

Digital and [[movie camera]]s share an optical system, typically using a lens with a variable [[Diaphragm (optics)|diaphragm]] to focus light onto an image pickup device.&lt;ref&gt;MakeUseOf: [http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/technology-explained-how-does-a-digital-camera-work/ How does a Digital Camera Work]; retrieved 2013-09-07&lt;/ref&gt; The diaphragm and [[Shutter (photography)|shutter]] admit the correct amount of light to the imager, just as with film but the image pickup device is electronic rather than chemical. However, unlike film cameras, digital cameras can display images on a screen immediately after being recorded, and store and delete images from [[Flash memory|memory]]. Many digital cameras can also record moving videos with [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound]]. Some digital cameras can [[Cropping (image)|crop]] and [[Image stitching|stitch]] pictures and perform other elementary [[image editing]].

==History==
{{See|History of the camera#Digital cameras|Digital single-lens reflex camera|Camera phone}}

The history of the digital camera began with [[Eugene F. Lally]] of the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], who was thinking about how to use a mosaic photosensor to capture digital images. His 1961 idea was to take pictures of the planets and stars while travelling through space to give information about the astronauts' position. As with [[Texas Instruments]] employee Willis Adcock's filmless camera (US patent 4,057,830) in 1972, the technology had yet to catch up with the concept.

The [[Cromemco Cyclops]] was an all-digital camera introduced as a commercial product in 1975. Its design was published as a hobbyist construction project in the February 1975 issue of ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' magazine, and it used a 32&amp;times;32 [[Metal Oxide Semiconductor]] sensor.

[[Steven Sasson]], an engineer at [[Eastman Kodak]], invented and built the first self-contained electronic camera that used a [[charge-coupled device]] image sensor in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David |last=Prakel|title=The Visual Dictionary of Photography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f7X5vYbUd0sC&amp;pg=PA91|accessdate=24 July 2013|date=10 December 2009|publisher=AVA Publishing|isbn=978-2-940411-04-7|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dobbin&gt;Dobbin, Ben.

''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]''. Retrieved on 2018-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Estrin |first=James |date=August 12, 2015 |title=Kodak's First Digital Moment |url=http://nyti.ms/1IK1u5a |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early uses were mainly military and scientific; followed by medical and news applications.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In 1986, Japanese company [[Nikon]] introduced the first [[Digital single-lens reflex camera|digital single-lens reflex]] (DSLR) camera, the Nikon SVC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apphotnum.free.fr/N2BE2.html Nikon SLR-type digital cameras], Pierre Jarleton&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="busch"&gt;David D. Busch (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=jOVSzasqzQ4C&amp;pg=PT11 ''Nikon D70 Digital Field Guide'', page 11], [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-to-late 1990s, DSLR cameras became common among consumers. By the mid-2000s, DSLR cameras had largely replaced film cameras.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 2000, [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] introduced the world's first digital [[camera phone]], the [[J-SH04]] [[J-Phone]], in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoista.net/post/18437919296/evolution-of-the-cameraphone-from-sharp-j-sh04-to |title=Evolution of the Camera phone: From Sharp J-SH04 to Nokia 808 Pureview |publisher=Hoista.net |date=2012-02-28 |accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-2000s, higher-end [[cell phones]] had an integrated digital camera. By the beginning of the 2010s, almost all [[smartphone]]s had an integrated digital camera.

== Image sensors ==
{{Further|Image sensor}}
The two major types of digital image sensor are [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] and [[CMOS]]. A CCD sensor has one amplifier for all the pixels, while each pixel in a CMOS [[active-pixel sensor]] has its own amplifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ebay.de/gds/What-Is-the-Difference-Between-a-CCD-and-CMOS-Video-Camera-/10000000177630865/g.html |title=What Is the Difference Between a CCD and CMOS Video Camera |accessdate=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to CCDs, CMOS sensors use less power.&lt;ref name="blog" /&gt; Cameras with a small sensor use a [[back-illuminated sensor|back-side-illuminated]] CMOS (BSI-CMOS) sensor. Overall final image quality is more dependent on the [[image processing]] capability of the camera, than on sensor type.&lt;ref name="blog"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avocebehindthelens.wordpress.com/2012/04/01/technology-bsi-cmos-cmos-ccd-whats-the-deal/ |title=Technology: BSI-CMOS, CMOS, CCD… What’s the deal |date=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/why-the-iphone-4-takes-good-low-light-photos-bsi-cmos-sensors-explained/ |title=Why the iPhone 4 takes good low-light photos: BSI CMOS sensors explained! |author=Joshua Goldman |accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sensor resolution ===

The [[Image resolution|resolution]] of a digital camera is often limited by the image sensor&lt;ref&gt;QuinStreet Inc: [http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/digital_camera.html What is digital camera?]; retrieved 2013-09-07&lt;/ref&gt; that turns light into discrete signals. The brighter the image at a given point on the sensor, the larger the value that is read for that [[pixel]].
Depending on the physical structure of the sensor, a [[color filter array]] may be used, which requires [[demosaicing]] to recreate a full-color image.
The number of pixels in the sensor determines the camera's "[[pixel count]]".
In a typical sensor, the pixel count is the product of the number of rows and the number of columns. For example, a 1,000 by 1,000 pixel sensor would have 1,000,000 pixels, or 1 [[megapixel]].

===Image sharpness===
Final quality of an image depends on all optical transformations in the chain of producing the image. Carl Zeiss points out that the weakest link in an optical chain determines the final image quality. In case of a digital camera, a simplistic way of expressing it is that the lens determines the maximum sharpness of the image while the image sensor determines the maximum resolution. The illustration on the right can be said to compare a lens with very poor sharpness on a camera with high resolution, to a lens with good sharpness on a camera with lower resolution.

===Methods of image capture===

[[Image:Ccd-sensor.jpg|At the heart of a digital camera is a CCD or a [[Active pixel sensor|CMOS]] image sensor.|thumb|upright]]
[[Image:Partly disassembled Lumix digital camera.jpg|thumb|Digital camera, partly disassembled. The lens assembly (bottom right) is partially removed, but the sensor (top right) still captures an image, as seen on the LCD screen (bottom left).]]

Since the first digital backs were introduced, there have been three main methods of capturing the image, each based on the hardware configuration of the sensor and color filters.

''Single-shot'' capture systems use either one sensor chip with a [[Bayer filter]] mosaic, or three separate image sensors (one each for the [[primary additive colors]] red, green, and blue) which are exposed to the same image via a beam splitter (see [[Three-CCD camera]]).

''Multi-shot'' exposes the sensor to the image in a sequence of three or more openings of the lens [[aperture]]. There are several methods of application of the multi-shot technique. The most common originally was to use a single image sensor with three filters passed in front of the sensor in sequence to obtain the additive color information. Another multiple shot method is called [[Microscanning]]. This method uses a single sensor chip with a Bayer filter and physically moved the sensor on the focus plane of the lens to construct a higher resolution image than the native resolution of the chip. A third version combined the two methods without a Bayer filter on the chip.

The third method is called ''scanning'' because the sensor moves across the focal plane much like the sensor of an [[image scanner]]. The ''linear'' or ''tri-linear'' sensors in scanning cameras utilize only a single line of photosensors, or three lines for the three colors. Scanning may be accomplished by moving the sensor (for example, when using [[color co-site sampling]]) or by rotating the whole camera. A digital [[rotating line camera]] offers images of very high total resolution.

The choice of method for a given capture is determined largely by the subject matter. It is usually inappropriate to attempt to capture a subject that moves with anything but a single-shot system. However, the higher color fidelity and larger file sizes and resolutions available with multi-shot and scanning backs make them attractive for commercial photographers working with stationary subjects and large-format photographs.{{original research inline|date=August 2013}}

Improvements in single-shot cameras and image file processing at the beginning of the 21st century made single shot cameras almost completely dominant, even in high-end commercial photography.

=== Filter mosaics, interpolation, and aliasing ===

[[Image:Bayer pattern on sensor.svg|thumb|left|The Bayer arrangement of color filters on the pixel array of an image sensor.]]
Most current consumer digital cameras use a [[Bayer filter|Bayer filter mosaic]] in combination with an optical [[anti-aliasing filter]] to reduce the aliasing due to the reduced sampling of the different primary-color images.
A demosaicing algorithm is used to [[interpolation|interpolate]] color information to create a full array of RGB image data.

Cameras that use a beam-splitter single-shot [[3CCD]] approach, three-filter multi-shot approach, color co-site sampling or [[Foveon X3 sensor]] do not use anti-aliasing filters, nor demosaicing.

[[Firmware]] in the camera, or a software in a raw converter program such as [[Adobe DNG Converter|Adobe Camera Raw]], interprets the raw data from the sensor to obtain a full color image, because the [[RGB color model]] requires three intensity values for each pixel: one each for the red, green, and blue (other color models, when used, also require three or more values per pixel).
A single sensor element cannot simultaneously record these three intensities, and so a [[color filter array]] (CFA) must be used to selectively filter a particular color for each pixel.

The Bayer filter pattern is a repeating 2x2 mosaic pattern of light filters, with green ones at opposite corners and red and blue in the other two positions. The high proportion of green takes advantage of properties of the human visual system, which determines brightness mostly from green and is far more sensitive to brightness than to hue or saturation. Sometimes a 4-color filter pattern is used, often involving two different hues of green. This provides potentially more accurate color, but requires a slightly more complicated interpolation process.

The color intensity values not captured for each pixel can be [[interpolate]]d from the values of adjacent pixels which represent the color being calculated.

=== Sensor size and angle of view ===

Cameras with digital image sensors that are smaller than the typical 35mm film size have a smaller field or [[angle of view]] when used with a lens of the same [[focal length]]. This is because angle of view is a function of both focal length and the sensor or film size used.

[[Image:kids 50mm 100mm.jpg|right|thumb|&lt;!-- comment welcome --&gt;]]

The [[crop factor]] is relative to the [[135 film|35mm film format]]. If a smaller sensor is used, as in most digicams, the field of view is cropped by the sensor to smaller than the 35mm full-frame format's field of view. This narrowing of the field of view may be described as [[crop factor]], a factor by which a longer focal length lens would be needed to get the same field of view on a 35mm film camera. [[Full-frame digital SLR]]s utilize a sensor of the same size as a frame of 35mm film.

Common values for field of view crop in DSLRs using [[active pixel sensor]]s include 1.3x for some [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] (APS-H) sensors, 1.5x for [[Sony]] APS-C sensors used by [[Nikon]], [[Pentax]] and [[Konica Minolta]] and for [[Fujifilm]] sensors, 1.6 (APS-C) for most Canon sensors, ~1.7x for [[Sigma Corporation|Sigma]]'s [[Foveon]] sensors and 2x for [[Kodak]] and [[Panasonic]] 4/3-inch sensors currently used by [[Olympus company|Olympus]] and Panasonic. Crop factors for non-SLR consumer compact and [[bridge digital camera|bridge]] cameras are larger, frequently 4x or more.

==Types of digital cameras==
Digital cameras come in a wide range of sizes, prices and capabilities. In addition to general purpose digital cameras, specialized cameras including [[multispectral imaging]] equipment and [[astrograph]]s are used for scientific, military, medical and other special purposes.

===Compacts===
[[File:Sony DSC-W170.jpg|thumb|left|Subcompact with lens assembly retracted]]
[[File:Disassembled digital camera.jpg|thumb|left|Disassembled compact digital camera]]
Compact cameras are intended to be portable (pocketable) and are particularly suitable for casual "[[snapshot (photography)|snapshots]]".

Many incorporate a retractable lens assembly that provides optical zoom. In most models, an auto actuating lens cover protects the lens from elements. Most ruggedized or [[Waterproof digital camera|water-resistant]] models do not retract, and most with [[superzoom]] capability do not retract fully.

Compact cameras are usually designed to be [[Usability|easy to use]].  Almost all include an automatic mode, or "auto mode", which automatically makes all camera settings for the user.  Some also have manual controls. Compact digital cameras typically contain a small sensor which trades-off picture quality for compactness and simplicity; images can usually only be stored using [[lossy compression]] ([[JPEG]]). Most have a built-in [[flash (photography)|flash]] usually of low power, sufficient for nearby subjects.  A few high end compact digital cameras have a [[hotshoe]] for connecting to an external flash. [[Live preview]] is almost always used to frame the photo on an integrated LCD. In addition to being able to take still photographs almost all compact cameras have the ability to record [[motion picture|video]].

Compacts often have [[Macro photography|macro]] capability and [[zoom lens]]es, but the zoom range (up to 30x) is generally enough for [[candid photography]] but less than is available on [[bridge camera]]s (more than 60x), or the interchangeable lenses of DSLR cameras available at a much higher cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/18-300mm.htm |title=Nikon 18-300mm VR DX AF-S G ED NIKKOR, $1,000 |author=Ken Rockwell |accessdate=January 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Autofocus]] systems in compact digital cameras generally are based on a contrast-detection methodology using the image data from the live preview feed of the main imager. Some compact digital cameras use a hybrid autofocus system similar to what is commonly available on DSLRs. 

Typically, compact digital cameras incorporate a nearly silent [[leaf shutter]] into the lens but play a simulated camera sound &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steves-digicams.com/knowledge-center/how-tos/digital-camera-operation/digital-cameras-turn-shutter-sound-on-or-off.html#b Turn shutter sound on or off] Steve's Digicams&lt;/ref&gt; for [[skeuomorph]]ic purposes.

For low cost and small size, these cameras typically use [[Image sensor format#Table of sensor formats and sizes|image sensor format]]s with a diagonal between 6 and 11&amp;nbsp;mm, corresponding to a crop factor between 7 and 4. This gives them weaker low-light performance, greater [[depth of field]], generally closer focusing ability, and smaller components than cameras using larger sensors. Some cameras use a larger sensor including, at the high end, a pricey full-frame sensor compact camera, such as [[Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX1]], but have capability near that of a DSLR.

A variety of additional features are available depending on the model of the camera. Such features include [[Geotagging|GPS]], compass, [[barometer]]s and [[altimeter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cameras.co.uk/specs/panasonic-dmc-ft3.cfm Panasonic DMC FT3 Specification]. Cameras.co.uk. Retrieved on 2013-08-16.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Starting in 2011, some compact digital cameras can take 3D still photos. These 3D compact [[stereo camera]]s can capture 3D panoramic photos with dual lens or even single lens for play back on a [[3D TV]].

In 2013, Sony released two add-on camera models without display, to be used with a smartphone or tablet, controlled by a [[mobile application]] via WiFi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/09/04/sony-qx100-qx10-lens-cameras/ |title=Sony DSC-QX100 and QX10 lens cameras bring top-notch optics to any smartphone or tablet, we go hands-on (video) |date=September 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rugged compacts ===
Rugged compact cameras typically include protection against submersion, hot and cold conditions, shock and pressure. Terms used to describe such properties include waterproof, freezeproof, heatproof, shockproof and crushproof, respectively. Nearly all major camera manufacturers have at least one product in this category. Some are waterproof to a considerable depth up to 82 feet (27 m);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://manmakesfire.com/3-best-waterproof-cameras-2014-rugged-compact-ready-action/ |title=3 Best Waterproof Cameras for 2015: Rugged, Compact, and Ready for Action |author=Chris Maxcer |accessdate=February 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; others only 10 feet (3m), but only a few will float. Ruggeds often lack some of the features of ordinary compact camera, but they have video capability and the majority can record sound. Most have image stabilization and built-in flash. Touchscreen LCD and GPS do not work under water.

=== Action cameras ===
{{details|Action camera}}
[[GoPro]] and other brands offer action cameras which are rugged, small and can be easily attached to [[helmet cam|helmet]], arm, bicycle, etc.  Most have wide angle and fixed focus, and can take still pictures and video, typically with sound.

The rising popularity of action cameras is in line with many people desiring to share photos or videos in [[social media]].  Many competitive manufacturers of action cameras results in many options and lowered, competitive prices, and nowadays, cameras are sold bundled with waterproof housings, accessories, and mountings compatible with the popular GoPro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/action-camera-market.html |title=Action Camera Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2016 - 2024 |author= |accessdate=April 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===360-degree cameras===
The 360-degree camera can take picture or video 360 degrees using two lenses back-to-back and shooting at the same time. Some of the cameras are Ricoh Theta S, Nikon Keymission 360 and Samsung Gear 360. Nico360 was launched in 2016 and claimed as the world's smallest 360-degree camera with size 46 x 46 x 28&amp;nbsp;mm (1.8 x 1.8 x 1.1 in) and price less than $200. With [[virtual reality]] mode built-in stitching, Wifi, and Bluetooth, live streaming can be done. Due to it also being water resistant, the Nico360 can be used as action camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gizmag.com/nico360-camera-smallest/44421/ |title=Big plans for "world’s smallest" 360-degree camera |author=Simon Crisp |date=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are tend that action cameras have capabilities to shoot 360 degrees with at least 4K resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/9/10742974/nikon-gopro-action-cameras-360-video-ces-2016 |title=Nikon’s new action camera could change the market in a big way This is the year action cameras and 360-degree videos collide |author=Sean O'Kane |date=January 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bridge cameras===
[[File:Sony DSC-H2 01.jpg|thumb|Sony DSC-H2]]
{{Main|Bridge camera}}

Bridge cameras physically resemble DSLRs, and are sometimes called DSLR-shape or DSLR-like. They provide some similar features but, like compacts, they use a fixed lens and a small sensor. Some compact cameras have also PSAM mode. Most use [[live preview]] to frame the image. Their usual autofocus is by the same contrast-detect mechanism as compacts, but many bridge cameras have a [[manual focus]] mode and some have a separate focus ring for greater control.

Big physical size and small sensor allow [[superzoom]] and wide [[aperture]]. Bridge cameras generally include an [[image stabilization]] system to enable longer handheld exposures, sometimes better than DSLR for low light condition.

As of 2014, bridge cameras come in two principal classes in terms of sensor size, firstly the more traditional 1/2.3" sensor (as measured by [[image sensor format]]) which gives more flexibility in lens design and allows for handholdable zoom from 20 to 24mm (35mm equivalent) wide angle all the way up to over 1000&amp;nbsp;mm supertele, and secondly a 1" sensor that allows better image quality particularly in low light (higher ISO) but puts greater constraints on lens design, resulting in zoom lenses that stop at 200mm (constant aperture, e.g. Sony RX10) or 400mm (variable aperture, e.g. Panasonic Lumix FZ1000) equivalent, corresponding to an optical zoom factor of roughly 10 to 15.

Some bridge cameras have a lens thread to attach accessories such as wide-angle or [[Teleconverter|telephoto converters]] as well as filters such as UV or [[Polarizing filter (photography)|Circular Polarizing]] filter and lens hoods. The scene is composed by viewing the display or the [[electronic viewfinder]] (EVF). Most have a slightly longer [[shutter lag]] than a DSLR. Many of these cameras can store images in a raw format in addition to supporting JPEG.&lt;ref&gt;JPEG is a lossy compression format with less colour depth than typical of raw formats; however, most raw formats require demosaicing ("raw converter") software to be viewed properly.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority have a built-in flash, but only a few have a [[hotshoe]].

In bright sun, the quality difference between a good compact camera and a digital SLR is minimal but bridge cameras are more portable, cost less and have a greater zoom ability. Thus a bridge camera may better suit outdoor daytime activities, except when seeking professional-quality photos.&lt;ref&gt;Digital SLR vs Compact SuperZoom Camera

=== Mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras ===

[[File:Nikon Z7 D81 2448 (44253991734).jpg|thumb|Nikon Z7 introduced 2018]]
{{Main|Mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera}}

In late 2008, a new type of camera emerged called mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera (MILC), which uses various sensors and offers lens interchangeability. These are simpler and more compact than DSLRs due to not having a lens reflex system. MILC camera models are available with various sensor sizes including: a small 1/2.3&amp;nbsp;inch sensor, as is commonly used in [[bridge camera]]s such as the original [[Pentax Q]] (more recent Pentax Q versions have a slightly larger 1/1.7&amp;nbsp;inch sensor); a 1-inch sensor; a [[Micro Four Thirds system|Micro Four Thirds]] sensor; an APS-C sensor such as the Sony NEX series, [[Fujifilm X series]], [[Pentax K-01]], and [[Canon EOS M]]; and some, such as the [[Sony α7]], use a full frame (35&amp;nbsp;mm) sensor and even [[Hasselblad]] X1D is the first medium format MILC. Some MILC cameras have a separate electronic viewfinder. In other cameras the back display is used as a viewfinder in same way as in compact cameras. A disadvantage of MILC compared to DSLR is battery life due to the energy consumption of the [[electronic viewfinder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/latest/opinion/rise-mirrorless-compact-system-cameras-94896 |title=The rise of mirrorless compact system cameras |author=Andy Westlake |date=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olympus and Panasonic released many Micro Four Thirds cameras with interchangeable lenses which are fully compatible each other without any adapter, while the others have proprietary mounts. In 2014, Kodak released its first Micro Four Third system camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dpreview.com/previews/kodak-pixpro-s-1/ |title=Kodak Pixpro S-1 First Impressions Review |author=Andy Westlake |accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2014|3}}, MILC cameras are available which appeal to both amateurs and professionals.&lt;ref name="Engadget-930976"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/03/13/nikon-1-v3/ |title=Nikon 1 V3 camera unveiled: $1,200, 120fps slow motion, 20fps continuous shooting |work=[[Engadget]] |date=March 13, 2014 |publisher=[[AOL]] |accessdate=March 19, 2014 |first=Richard |last=Lawler |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320035108/http://www.engadget.com/2014/03/13/nikon-1-v3/ |archivedate=March 20, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modular cameras{{anchor|SmartShot}} ===
While most digital cameras with interchangeable lenses feature a lens-mount of some kind, there are also a number of modular cameras, where the shutter and sensor are incorporated into the lens module.

The first such modular camera was the [[Minolta Dimâge V]] in 1996, followed by the [[Minolta Dimâge EX 1500]] in 1998 and the [[Minolta MetaFlash 3D 1500]] in 1999. In 2009, Ricoh released the [[Ricoh GXR]] modular camera.

At CES 2013, [[Sakar International]] announced the [[Polaroid iM1836]], an 18 MP camera with 1"-sensor with interchangeable sensor-lens. An adapter for [[Micro Four Thirds]], Nikon and K-mount lenses was planned to ship with the camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://connect.dpreview.com/post/3952862814/polaroid-announces-android-camera-with-interchangeable-lenses |title=Polaroid offers first Android camera with interchangeable lenses |date=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also a number of add-on camera modules for [[smartphone]]s called lens-style cameras (lens camera). They contain all components of a digital camera in a module, but lack a viewfinder, display and most of the controls.  Instead they can be mounted to a [[smartphone]] and use its display and controls. Lens-style cameras include:

=== Digital single-lens reflex cameras ===
[[File:E-30-Cutmodel.jpg|thumb|Cutaway of an [[Olympus E-30]] DSLR]]
{{Main|Digital single-lens reflex camera}}

Digital [[single-lens reflex camera]]s (DSLR) use a reflex mirror that can reflect the light and also can swivel from one position to another position and back to initial position.  By default, the reflex mirror is set 45 degree from horizontal, blocks the light to the sensor and reflects light from the lens to penta-mirror/prism at the DSLR camera and after some reflections arrives at the viewfinder. The reflex mirror is pulled out horizontally below the penta-mirror/prism when shutter release is fully pressed, so the viewfinder will be dark and the light/image can directly strike the sensor at the time of exposure (speed setting).

Autofocus is accomplished using sensors in the mirror box. Some DSLRs have a "[[Live preview|live view]]" mode that allows framing using the screen with image from the sensor.

These cameras have much larger sensors than the other types, typically 18&amp;nbsp;mm to 36&amp;nbsp;mm on the diagonal (crop factor 2, 1.6, or 1). The larger sensor permits more light to be received by each pixel; this, combined with the relatively large lenses provides superior low-light performance. For the same field of view and the same aperture, a larger sensor gives shallower focus.
They use [[interchangeable lens]]es for versatility. Usually some lenses are made for digital SLR use only, but recent trend the lenses can also be used in detachable lens video camera with or without adapter.

===Digital Single Lens Translucent (DSLT) cameras===
{{main|Sony SLT camera}}
A DSLT uses a '''fixed''' [[Transparency and translucency|translucent]] mirror instead of a '''moving''' reflex mirror as in DSLR. A translucent mirror or transmissive mirror or semi-transparent mirror is a mirror which reflects the light to two things at the same time. It reflects it along the path to a pentaprism/pentamirror which then goes to an optical view finder (OVF) as is done with a reflex mirror in DSLR cameras. The translucent mirror also sends light along a second path to the sensor. The total amount of light is not changed, just some of the light travels one path and some of it travels the other. The consequences are that DSLT cameras should shoot a half stop differently from DSL. One advantage of using a DSLT camera is the blind moments a DSLR user experiences while the reflecting mirror is moved to send the light to the sensor instead of the viewfinder do not exist for DSLT cameras. Because there is no time at which light is not traveling along both paths, DSLT cameras get the benefit of continuous auto-focus tracking. This is especially beneficial for burst mode shooting in low-light conditions and also for tracking when taking video.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Until early 2014, only Sony had released DSLT cameras. By March 2013, Sony had released more DSLTs than DSLRs with a relatively complete lenses line-up.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Digital rangefinders===

{{Main|Rangefinder camera#Digital rangefinder}}

A rangefinder is a device to measure subject distance, with the intent to adjust the focus of a camera's objective lens accordingly ([[open-loop controller]]). The rangefinder and lens focusing mechanism may or may not be coupled. In common parlance, the term "rangefinder camera" is interpreted very narrowly to denote manual-focus cameras with a visually-read out optical rangefinder based on [[parallax]]. Most digital cameras achieve focus through analysis of the image captured by the objective lens and distance estimation, if it is provided at all, is only a byproduct of the focusing process ([[closed-loop controller]]).

===Line-scan camera systems===
[[File:Strip_photo_of_San_Francisco_Cable_Car_10.jpg|thumb|A San Francisco cable car, imaged using an Alkeria Necta N4K2-7C line scan camera with a shutter speed of 250 microseconds, or 4000 frames per second.]]
A line-scan camera traditionally has a single row of pixel sensors, instead of a matrix of them. The lines are continuously fed to a computer that joins them to each other and makes an image. This is most commonly done by connecting the camera output to a [[frame grabber]] which resides in a [[PCI slot]] of an industrial computer. The frame grabber acts to buffer the image and sometimes provide some processing before delivering to the computer software for processing.

Multiple rows of sensors may be used to make colored images, or to increase sensitivity by TDI ([[Time delay and integration]]).
 
Many industrial applications require a wide field of view. Traditionally maintaining consistent light over large 2D areas is quite difficult. With a line scan camera all that is necessary is to provide even illumination across the “line” currently being viewed by the camera. This makes possible sharp pictures of objects that pass the camera at high speed.

Such cameras are also commonly used to make [[photo finish]]es, to determine the winner when multiple competitors cross the finishing line at nearly the same time. They can also be used as industrial instruments for analyzing fast processes.

Linescan cameras are also extensively used in imaging from satellites (see [[push broom scanner]]). In this case the row of sensors is perpendicular to the direction of satellite motion. Linescan cameras are widely used in [[Image scanner|scanner]]s. In this case, the camera moves horizontally.

=== Stand alone camera ===
Stand alone cameras can be used as [[remote camera]]. One kind weighs 2.31 ounces (65.5&amp;nbsp;g), with a periscope shape, IPx7 water-resistance and dust-resistance rating and can be enhanced to IPx8 by using a cap. They have no viewfinder or LCD. Lens is a 146 degree wide angle or standard lens, with fixed focus. It can have a microphone and speaker, And it can take photos and video. As a remote camera, a phone app using Android or iOS is needed to send live video, change settings, take photos, or use time lapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/10/08/htc-re-camera/ |title=HTC's RE camera is a GoPro for NoPros |author=Brad Molen |date=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integration into other devices ==
Many devices have a built-in digital camera, including, for example, [[camera phone|smartphones]], mobile phones, PDAs and laptop computers. Built-in cameras generally store the images in the JPEG file format.

Mobile phones incorporating digital cameras were introduced in Japan in 2001 by J-Phone. In 2003 [[camera phone]]s outsold stand-alone digital cameras, and in 2006 they outsold film and digital stand-alone cameras. Five billion camera phones were sold in five years, and by 2007 more than half of the [[installed base]] of all mobile phones were camera phones. Sales of separate cameras peaked in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/15/technology/15iht-navigate.html Kevin J. O'Brien, New York Times, 2010 Nov 15] Smartphone Sales Taking Toll on G.P.S. Devices&lt;/ref&gt;

== Market trends ==
[[File:Sale of smartphones and cameras.png|thumb|upright=1.1|alt=Chart of sale of smartphones (with built-in cameras) compared to digital cameras 2009-2013 showing smartphone sale soaring while camera sale is stagnating|Sale of smartphones compared to digital cameras 2009-2013]]

Sales of traditional digital cameras have declined due to the increasing use of [[smartphone]]s for casual photography, which also enable easier manipulation and sharing of photos through the use of [[Mobile app|apps]] and web-based services. "Bridge cameras", in contrast, have held their ground with functionality that most smartphone cameras lack, such as optical zoom and other advanced features.&lt;ref name=nyt-androidcamera&gt;{{cite web|title=Smile, and Say ‘Android’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/20/technology/personaltech/androidcameras-from-nikon-and-samsung-go-beyond-cellphones-review.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;|work=New York Times|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techradar.com/news/photography-video-capture/cameras/bridge-cameras-a-growing-market-says-canon-and-nikon-1064839 |title=Bridge cameras a growing market says Canon and Nikon |date=February 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; DSLRs have also lost ground to [[Mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera]] (MILC)s offering the same sensor size in a smaller camera. A few expensive ones use a full-frame sensor as DSLR professional cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://photographylife.com/future-digital-cameras |title=The Future of Digital Cameras |accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the convenience and flexibility of smartphone cameras, some manufacturers produced "smart" digital cameras that combine features of traditional cameras with those of a smartphone. In 2012, Nikon and Samsung released the [[Nikon Coolpix S800c|Coolpix S800c]] and [[Samsung Galaxy Camera|Galaxy Camera]], the first two digital cameras to run the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system. Since this [[software platform]] is used in many smartphones, they can integrate with services (such as [[e-mail attachment]]s, [[social networking service|social networks]] and [[photo sharing]] sites) as smartphones do, and use other Android-compatible software as well.&lt;ref name=nyt-androidcamera/&gt;

In an inversion, some phone makers have introduced smartphones with cameras designed to resemble traditional digital cameras. Nokia released the [[Nokia 808 PureView|808 PureView]] and [[Nokia Lumia 1020|Lumia 1020]] in 2012 and 2013; the two devices respectively run the [[Symbian]] and [[Windows Phone]] operating systems, and both include a 41-megapixel camera (along with a camera grip attachment for the latter).&lt;ref name=gsmarena-lumia1020&gt;{{cite web|title=Nokia Lumia 1020 preview: Take two|url=http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_lumia_1020-review-952.php|work=GSMArena|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Samsung introduced the Galaxy S4 Zoom, having a 16-megapixel camera and 10x optical zoom, combining traits from the [[Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini|Galaxy S4 Mini]] with the Galaxy Camera.&lt;ref name=laptop-phonecameras&gt;{{cite web|title=Nokia Lumia 1020 vs. Galaxy S4 Zoom: The Best Camera Phone Is…|url=http://blog.laptopmag.com/nokia-lumia-1020-vs-galaxy-s4-zoom|work=Laptop|accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panasonic Lumix DMC-CM1 is an Android KitKat 4.4 smartphone with 20MP, 1" sensor, the largest sensor for a smartphone ever, with Leica fixed lens equivalent of 28mm at F2.8, can take RAW image and 4K video, has 21mm thickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://connect.dpreview.com/post/7107523787/panasonic-announces-lumix-dmc-cm1-smartphone-with-1-inch-sensor |title=Panasonic announces Lumix DMC-CM1 smartphone with 1-inch sensor |author=Lars Rehm |date=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 2018 [[Huawei P20]] Pro is an android Oreo 8.1 has triple Leica lenses in the back of the smartphone with 40MP 1/1.7" [[RGB]] sensor as first lens, 20MP 1/2.7" [[monochrome]] sensor as second lens and 8MP 1/4" RGB sensor with 3x optical zoom as third lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_p20_pro-9106.php |title=Huawei P20 Pro |accessdate=July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combination of first lens and second lens will produce [[bokeh]] image with larger [[high dynamic range]], whereas combination of [[mega pixel]] first lens and optical zoom will produce maximum 5x [[digital zoom]] without loss of quality by reducing the image size to 8MP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/huawei-p20-pro-review/#/2/1 |title=Huawei P20 Pro review |author=Andy Boxall |date=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Light-field camera]]s were introduced in 2013 with one consumer product and several professional ones.

After a big dip of sales in 2012, consumer digital camera sales declined again in 2013 by 36 percent. In 2011, compact digital cameras sold 10 million per month. In 2013, sales fell to about 4 million per month. DSLR and MILC sales also declined in 2013 by 10–15% after almost ten years of double digit growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eoshd.com/content/11409/consumer-dslrs-dead-5-years 
|title=Consumer DSLRs "dead in 5 years" 
|author= Andrew Reid
|date= 26 October 2013 
|accessdate=December 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Worldwide unit sales of digital cameras is continuously declining from 148 million in 2011 to 58 million in 2015 and tends to decrease more in the following years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/269927/sales-of-analog-and-digital-cameras-worldwide-since-2002/ |title=Worldwide unit sales of digital cameras from 2011 to 2016 (in millions) |accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film camera sold got the peak at 36.671 million units in 1997 and digital camera sold began in 1999. In 2008, film camera market was dead and digital camera sold got the peak by 121.463 million units in 2010. In 2002, cell phone with camera has been introduced and in 2003 the cell phone with camera sold 80 million units per year. In 2011 the cell phone with camera sold hundreds of millions per year, when digital camera sold initialized to decline. In 2015, digital camera sold is 35.395 million units or only less than a third of digital camera sold number in a peak and also slightly less than film camera sold number in a peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tomstirrphotography.com/digital-camera-sales-continued-decline |title=DIGITAL CAMERA SALES CONTINUED TO DECLINE IN 2015 |author=Thomas Stirr |date=April 2, 2016 |accessdate=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connectivity==

=== Transferring photos ===
Many digital cameras can connect directly to a computer to transfer data:-
* Early cameras used the [[Personal computer|PC]] [[serial port]]. [[USB]] is now the most widely used method (most cameras are viewable as [[USB mass-storage device class|USB mass storage]]), though some have a [[IEEE 1394 interface|FireWire]] port. Some cameras use [[Picture Transfer Protocol|USB PTP]] mode for connection instead of USB MSC; some offer both modes.
{{anchor|Wireless media transfer}}
* Other cameras use [[wireless connection]]s, via [[Bluetooth]] or [[IEEE 802.11]] [[Wi-Fi]], such as the [[Kodak EasyShare One]]. [[Secure Digital#Integrated Wi-Fi|Wi-Fi integrated Memory cards]] (SDHC, SDXC) can transmit stored images, video and other files to computers or [[smartphone]]s.  Mobile operating systems such as [[Android (operating system)|Android]] allow automatic upload and backup or sharing of images over Wi-Fi to [[photo sharing]] and [[cloud computing|cloud services]].
{{anchor|Tethering}}
* Cameras with integrated Wi-Fi or specific Wi-Fi adapters mostly allow camera control, especially [[Shutter (photography)|shutter]] release, [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]] control and more ([[tethering]]) from computer or smartphone apps additionally to the transfer of media data.
* Cameraphones and some high-end stand-alone digital cameras also use [[cellular network]]s to connect for sharing images. The most common standard on cellular networks is the MMS [[Multimedia Messaging Service]], commonly called "picture messaging". The second method with [[smartphone]]s is to send a picture as an [[email attachment]]. Many old cameraphones, however, do not support email.

A common alternative is the use of a [[card reader]] which may be capable of reading several types of storage media, as well as high speed transfer of data to the computer. Use of a card reader also avoids draining the camera battery during the download process. An external card reader allows convenient direct access to the images on a collection of storage media. But if only one storage card is in use, moving it back and forth between the camera and the reader can be inconvenient. Many computers have a card reader built in, at least for SD cards.

===Printing photos===

Many modern cameras support the [[PictBridge]] standard, which allows them to send data directly to a PictBridge-capable [[computer printer]] without the need for a computer.

Wireless connectivity can also provide for printing photos without a cable connection.

{{Anchor|Instant-print}}
An ''instant-print camera'', is a digital camera with a built-in [[printer (computing)|printer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dpmag.com/how-to/tip-of-the-week/options-for-instant-print-cameras/|title=Options For Instant-Print Cameras|date=2016-03-28|author=William Sawalich|website=Digital Photo Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; This confers a similar functionality as an [[instant camera]] which uses [[instant film]] to quickly generate a physical photograph. Such non-digital cameras were popularized by [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reinventing Instant Photography for the Digital Age |publisher=Polaroid |url=http://thenewinstant.com/news-updates/Polaroid%20Introduces%20the%20Polaroid%20PoGo%E2%84%A2%20Instant%20Digital%20Camera/ |date=January 8, 2009 |accessdate=2009-01-15|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090121175859/http://thenewinstant.com/news-updates/Polaroid%20Introduces%20the%20Polaroid%20PoGo%E2%84%A2%20Instant%20Digital%20Camera/ |archivedate=2009-01-21|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Displaying photos===

Many digital cameras include a video output port.  Usually [[sVideo]], it sends a standard-definition video signal to a television, allowing the user to show one picture at a time.  Buttons or menus on the camera allow the user to select the photo, advance from one to another, or automatically send a "slide show" to the TV.

[[HDMI]] has been adopted by many high-end digital camera makers, to show photos in their high-resolution quality on an [[HDTV]].

In January 2008, [[Silicon Image]] announced a new technology for sending video from mobile devices to a television in digital form. [[Mobile High-definition Link|MHL]] sends pictures as a video stream, up to 1080p resolution, and is compatible with HDMI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mobile High-Definition Link Technology Gives Consumers the Ability to Link Mobile Devices to HDTVs with Support for Audio and Video |publisher=Silicon Image |url=http://www.siliconimage.com/news/releasedetails.aspx?id=480 |date=January 7, 2008 |accessdate=2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[DVD recorder]]s and television sets can read memory cards used in cameras; alternatively several types of flash card readers have TV output capability.

==Weather-sealing and waterproofing==
Cameras can be equipped with a varying amount of environmental sealing to provide protection against splashing water, moisture (humidity and fog), dust and sand, or complete waterproofness to a certain depth and for a certain duration. The latter is one of the approaches to allow [[underwater photography]], the other approach being the use of waterproof housings. Many waterproof digital cameras are also shockproof and resistant to low temperatures.

Some waterproof cameras can be fitted with a waterproof housing to increase the operational depth range. The Olympus 'Tough' range of compact cameras is an example.

==Modes==

Many digital cameras have preset [[mode dial|modes]] for different applications. Within the constraints of correct exposure various parameters can be changed, including [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]], aperture, [[focus (optics)|focus]]ing, [[light meter]]ing, [[white balance]], and equivalent sensitivity. For example, a [[portrait]] might use a wider aperture to render the background out of focus, and would seek out and focus on a human face rather than other image content.

== Image data storage ==

[[Image:Cf-card.jpg|right|thumb|A [[CompactFlash]] (CF) card, one of many media types used to store digital photographs]]

Many camera phones and most stand alone digital cameras store image data in flash [[memory card]]s or other [[removable media]]. Most stand-alone cameras use [[Secure Digital card|SD]] format, while a few use [[CompactFlash]] or other types. In January 2012, a faster [[XQD card]] format was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/06/sony-xqd-memory-cards/ |title=Sony Announces World’s First XQD Memory Cards |accessdate=January 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2014, some high end cameras have two hot-swapable memory slots. Photographers can swap one of the memory card with camera-on. Each memory slot can accept either Compact Flash or SD Card. All new Sony cameras also have two memory slots, one for its [[Memory Stick]] and one for SD Card, but not hot-swapable.

A few cameras used other removable storage such as [[Microdrive]]s (very small [[hard disk drive]]s), [[CD single]] (185&amp;nbsp;[[megabyte|MB]]), and [[3.5" floppy disk]]s.  Other unusual formats include:
* Onboard flash memory &amp;mdash; Cheap cameras and cameras secondary to the device's main use (such as a camera phone)
* [[PC Card]] hard drives &amp;mdash; early professional cameras (discontinued)
* [[Thermal printer]] &amp;mdash; known only in one model of camera that printed images immediately rather than storing
&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:Floppy disk 90mm.JPG|[[3.5" floppy disk]]s
Image:Memory_Stick_Front_and_Back.jpg|Sony's [[Memory Stick]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Most manufacturers of digital cameras do not provide drivers and software to allow their cameras to work with [[Linux]] or other [[free software]]. Still, many cameras use the standard [[USB storage]] protocol, and are thus easily usable. Other cameras are supported by the [[gPhoto]] project.

===File formats===

{{Main|Image file formats}}

The Joint Photography Experts Group standard (JPEG) is the most common file format for storing image data.  Other file types include Tagged Image File Format ([[TIFF]]) and various [[Raw image format]]s.

Many cameras, especially high-end ones, support a [[raw image format]]. A raw image is the unprocessed set of pixel data directly from the camera's sensor, often saved in a [[proprietary format]]. [[Adobe Systems]] has released the [[Digital Negative|DNG]] format, a royalty-free raw image format used by at least 10 camera manufacturers.

Raw files initially had to be processed in specialized image editing programs, but over time many mainstream editing programs, such as Google's [[Picasa]], have added support for raw images. Rendering to standard images from raw sensor data allows more flexibility in making major adjustments without losing image quality or retaking the picture.

Formats for movies are [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]], [[DV]], [[MPEG]], [[QuickTime#File formats|MOV]] (often containing motion JPEG), [[WMV]], and ASF (basically the same as WMV). Recent formats include [[MP4]], which is based on the QuickTime format and uses newer compression algorithms to allow longer recording times in the same space.

Other formats that are used in cameras (but not for pictures) are the Design Rule for Camera Format ([[Design rule for Camera File system|DCF]]), an [[International Organization for Standardisation|ISO]] specification, used in almost all camera since 1998, which defines an internal file structure and naming. Also used is the Digital Print Order Format ([[DPOF]]), which dictates what order images are to be printed in and how many copies. The DCF 1998 defines a logical file system with [[8.3 filename]]s and makes the usage of either FAT12, FAT16, FAT32 or exFAT mandatory for its physical layer in order to maximize platform interoperability.&lt;ref name="DC-009-2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cipa.jp/english/hyoujunka/kikaku/pdf/DC-009-2010_E.pdf |title=Standard of the Camera &amp; Imaging Products Association, CIPA DC-009-Translation-2010, Design rule for Camera File system: DCF Version 2.0 (Edition 2010) |author=JEIDA/JEITA/CIPA |year=2010 |accessdate=2011-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930190707/http://www.cipa.jp/english/hyoujunka/kikaku/pdf/DC-009-2010_E.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most cameras include [[Exchangeable image file format|Exif]] data that provides [[metadata]] about the picture. Exif data may include aperture, [[exposure time]], focal length, date and time taken, and [[Geotagged photograph|location]].

==Batteries==
Digital cameras have become smaller over time, resulting in an ongoing need to develop a [[battery (electricity)|battery]] small enough to fit in the camera and yet able to power it for a reasonable length of time.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Digital cameras utilize either proprietary or standard consumer batteries. {{as of|March 2014}}, most cameras use proprietary lithium-ion batteries while some use standard AA batteries or primarily use a proprietary Lithium-ion rechargeable battery pack but have an optional AA battery holder available.

===Proprietary=== 

The most common class of battery used in digital cameras is proprietary battery formats. These are built to a manufacturer's custom specifications. Almost all proprietary batteries are lithium-ion. In addition to being available from the [[Original Equipment Manufacturer|OEM]], aftermarket replacement batteries are commonly available for most camera models.

===Standard consumer batteries===
{{main|Commercial off-the-shelf}}

Digital cameras that utilize off-the-shelf batteries are typically designed to be able to use both single-use [[primary cell|disposable]] and [[rechargeable batteries]], but not with both types in use at the same time. The most common off-the-shelf battery size used is [[AA battery|AA]]. CR2, [[CR-V3]] batteries, and [[AAA battery|AAA batteries]] are also used in some cameras. The CR2 and CR-V3 batteries are [[lithium battery|lithium based]], intended for a single use. Rechargeable [[RCR-V3]] lithium-ion batteries are also available as an alternative to non-rechargeable CR-V3 batteries.

Some [[battery grip]]s for DSLRs come with a separate holder to accommodate AA cells as an external power source.

== Conversion of film cameras to digital ==

[[File:Reflex camera numeric.svg|thumb|[[Digital single-lens reflex camera]]]]

When digital cameras became common, many photographers asked whether their [[film camera]]s could be converted to digital.  The answer was yes and no.  For the majority of 35&amp;nbsp;mm film cameras the answer is no, the reworking and cost would be too great, especially as lenses have been evolving as well as cameras. For most a conversion to digital, to give enough space for the electronics and allow a liquid crystal display to preview, would require removing the back of the camera and replacing it with a custom built digital unit.

Many early professional SLR cameras, such as the [[Kodak DCS]] series, were developed from 35&amp;nbsp;mm film cameras. The technology of the time, however, meant that rather than being digital "backs" the bodies of these cameras were mounted on large, bulky digital units, often bigger than the camera portion itself. These were factory built cameras, however, not [[Aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]] conversions.

A notable exception is the [[Nikon E2]] and [[Nikon E3]], using additional optics to convert the 35mm format to a 2/3 CCD-sensor.

A few 35&amp;nbsp;mm cameras have had [[digital camera back]]s made by their manufacturer, Leica being a notable example. [[Medium format (film)|Medium format]] and [[large format]] cameras (those using film stock greater than 35&amp;nbsp;mm), have a low unit production, and typical digital backs for them cost over $10,000. These cameras also tend to be highly modular, with handgrips, film backs, winders, and lenses available separately to fit various needs.

The very large sensor these backs use leads to enormous image sizes. For example, Phase One's P45 39&amp;nbsp;MP image back creates a single TIFF image of size up to 224.6&amp;nbsp;MB, and even greater pixel counts are available. Medium format digitals such as this are geared more towards studio and [[portrait photography]] than their smaller DSLR counterparts; the [[ISO speed]] in particular tends to have a maximum of 400, versus 6400 for some DSLR cameras. (Canon EOS-1D Mark IV and [[Nikon D3S]] have ISO 12800 plus Hi-3 ISO 102400 with the Canon EOS-1Dx's ISO of 204800)

=== Digital camera backs ===
{{Main|digital camera back}}

In the industrial and high-end professional photography market, some camera systems use modular (removable) image sensors. For example, some medium format SLR cameras, such as the Mamiya 645D series, allow installation of either a digital camera back or a traditional photographic film back.

* Area array
** CCD
** CMOS
* Linear array
** CCD (monochrome)
** 3-strip CCD with color filters

Linear array cameras are also called scan backs.

* Single-shot
* Multi-shot (three-shot, usually)

Most earlier digital camera backs used linear array sensors, moving vertically to [[digitize]] the image.  Many of them only capture [[grayscale]] images. The relatively long exposure times, in the range of seconds or even minutes generally limit scan backs to studio applications, where all aspects of the photographic scene are under the photographer's control.

Some other camera backs use CCD arrays similar to typical cameras. These are called single-shot backs.

Since it is much easier to manufacture a high-quality linear CCD array with only thousands of pixels than a CCD matrix with millions, very high resolution linear CCD camera backs were available much earlier than their CCD matrix counterparts. For example, you could buy an (albeit expensive) camera back with over 7,000 pixel horizontal resolution in the mid-1990s. However, {{As of|2004|lc=on}}, it is still difficult to buy a comparable CCD matrix camera of the same resolution. Rotating line cameras, with about 10,000 color pixels in its sensor line, are able, {{As of|2005|lc=on}}, to capture about 120,000 lines during one full 360 degree rotation, thereby creating a single digital image of 1,200 Megapixels.

Most modern digital camera backs use CCD or CMOS matrix sensors. The matrix sensor captures the entire image frame at once, instead of incrementing scanning the frame area through the prolonged exposure. For example, [[Phase One (company)|Phase One]] produces a 39 million pixel digital camera back with a 49.1 x 36.8&amp;nbsp;mm CCD in 2008. This CCD array is a little smaller than a frame of [[120 film]] and much larger than a [[35 mm film|35 mm]] frame (36 x 24&amp;nbsp;mm). In comparison, consumer digital cameras use arrays ranging from 36 x 24&amp;nbsp;mm (full frame on high end consumer DSLRs) to 1.28 x 0.96&amp;nbsp;mm (on [[camera phone]]s) CMOS sensor.

[[Image:Pierre-Cécile Puvis de Chavannes 003.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Pierre-Cécile Puvis de Chavannes: ''The Dream'', 1883]]
'''Dream art''' is any form of [[art]] directly based on material from [[dream]]s, or which employs dream-like imagery.

==History==
References to dreams ''in'' art are as old as literature itself: the story of [[Gilgamesh]], the [[Bible]], and the [[Iliad]] all describe dreams of major characters and the meanings thereof. However, dreams ''as'' art, without a "real" frame story, appear to be a later development—though there is no way to know whether many premodern works were dream-based.

In European literature, the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement emphasized the value of emotion and irrational inspiration. "Visions", whether from dreams or intoxication, served as raw material and were taken to represent the artist's highest creative potential.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and [[Expressionism]] introduced dream imagery into visual art. Expressionism was also a literary movement, and included the later work of the playwright [[August Strindberg]], who coined the term "dream play" for a style of narrative that did not distinguish between fantasy and reality.

At the same time, discussion of dreams reached a new level of public awareness in the Western world due to the work of [[Sigmund Freud]], who introduced the notion of the [[subconscious]] mind as a field of scientific inquiry. Freud greatly influenced the 20th-century [[Surrealist]]s, who combined the visionary impulses of Romantics and Expressionists with a focus on the unconscious as a creative tool, and an assumption that apparently irrational content could contain significant meaning, perhaps more so than rational content.

The invention of film and [[animation]] brought new possibilities for vivid depiction of nonrealistic events, but films consisting ''entirely'' of dream imagery have remained an avant-garde rarity. [[Comic book]]s and [[comic strip]]s have explored dreams somewhat more often, starting with [[Winsor McCay]]'s popular newspaper strips; the trend toward confessional works in [[alternative comics]] of the 1980s saw a proliferation of artists drawing their own dreams.

In the collection, [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0982869509 The Committee of Sleep], Harvard psychologist [[Deirdre Barrett]] identifies modern dream-inspired art such as paintings including Jasper Johns's ''Flag'', much of the work of Jim Dine and Salvador Dalí, novels ranging from "Sophie's Choice" to works by Anne Rice and Stephen King and films including Robert Altman's ''Three Women'', John Sayles ''Brother from Another Planet'' and Ingmar Bergman's ''Wild Strawberries''. That book also describes how Paul McCartney's ''Yesterday'' was heard by him in a dream and Most of Billy Joel's and Ladysmith Black Mambazo's music has originated in dreams.

Dream material continues to be used by a wide range of contemporary artists for various purposes. This practice is considered by some to be of psychological value for the artist—independent of the artistic value of the results—as part of the discipline of "dream work".

The international [[Association for the Study of Dreams]][http://www.asdreams.org] holds an annual juried show of visual dream art.

'''Europeana.eu''' is the EU digital platform for cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/new-europeana-collections-site-brings-people-closer-culture|title=New Europeana Collections site brings people closer to culture|date=22 January 2016|website=Digital Single Market|publisher=[[European Commission]]|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], ''[[Girl With a Pearl Earring|Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' by [[Johannes Vermeer]], the works of [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Isaac Newton]] and the music of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] are some of the highlights on Europeana.

More than 3,000 institutions across Europe have contributed to Europeana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why become a data provider?|url=http://pro.europeana.eu/share-your-data/become-a-data-provider|website=pro.europeana|publisher=Europeana|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These range from major international names like the [[Rijksmuseum|Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam]], the [[British Library]] and the [[Louvre]] to regional archives and local museums from every member of the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;List of partners and contributors [http://europeana.eu/portal/partners.html List of partners and contributors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423034227/http://europeana.eu/portal/partners.html |date=23 April 2011 }}, Europeana.eu. Accessed 2 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Together, their assembled collections let users explore Europe's cultural and scientific heritage from prehistory to the modern day.

== History ==
The catalyst for Europeana was a letter sent by [[Jacques Chirac]], President of France, together with the premiers of [[Germany]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Poland]] and [[Hungary]] to the President of the European Commission, [[Jose Manuel Durao Barroso|José Manuel Durão Barroso]], in April 2005. The letter recommended the creation of a virtual European library, to make Europe's cultural heritage accessible for all.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/timeline-digitisation-and-online-accessibility-cultural-heritage Timeline of digitisation and online accessibility of cultural heritage]" (23 July 2014). European Commission, ''Digital Agenda for Europe''. The letter, written in French, was dated 28 April 2005 (see under that date in timeline): [http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=5978 ec.europa.eu]. Retrieved 2015-05-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter added resonance to the work that the [[European Commission]]'s [[Directorate-General for Information Society and Media (European Commission)|Information Society and Media Directorate]] had been engaged in for over a decade, with programmes such as Telematics for Libraries. It gave strong political endorsement to the Directorate's strategy, i2010: communication on digital libraries, which was published on 30 September 2005. The strategy announced the intention to promote and support the creation of a European [[digital library]], as a goal within the European Union,&lt;ref&gt;European Commission (30 September 2005). Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. ''[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52005DC0465&amp;from=EN i2010: Digital Libraries]''  p. 3. Retrieved 2015-05-19.&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to foster growth in the information society and media industries.

The project that began the building of Europeana was called the European Digital Library Network (EDLnet) and was aimed at building a prototype of a cross-border, cross-domain, user-centred service. It was funded by the European Commission under its eContentplus programme, one of the research and development funding streams of i2010.

The prototype was launched on 20 November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/aboutus_background.html |title=Background |publisher=Europeana.eu |accessdate= 10 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110122000251/http://www.europeana.eu/portal/aboutus_background.html |archivedate=January 22, 2011 |quote=2008 Europeana's prototype is launched on November 20th by Viviane Reding, European Commissioner for Information Society and Media, and the President of the Commission, José Manuel Barroso.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its beta launch, the site gave access to 4.5 million digital objects – more than double the initial target – from over 1,000 contributing organisations, including world-famous national library, gallery and museum collections from the capitals of Europe. Due to an unexpected user surge (peaking at an estimated 10 million hits an hour), the servers were unable to cope with the massive load. The site was temporarily taken down, and after series of technical upgrades went up again in December 2008.
In February 2009, the successor of EDLnet – Europeana version 1.0 – began. This 30-month project was to develop the prototype into a fully operational service. In 2010, the project accomplished its objective of giving access to over 10 million digital objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-v1.0 |title=Europeana Version 1 project |publisher=Europeana Foundation |date= |accessdate=2012-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710051622/http://www.pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-v1.0 |archivedate=10 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 2011, new features on the site included a translation tool and the ability to expand on information by automatically transferring the search term to Wikipedia and other services.

== Function ==
Europeana gives access to different types of content from different types of heritage institutions. The digital objects that users can find in Europeana are not stored on a central computer, but remain with the cultural institution and are hosted on their networks. Europeana collects contextual information – or [[metadata]] – about the items, including a small picture. Users search this contextual information. Once they find what they are looking for, if they want to access the full content of the item, they can click through to the original site that holds the content.

Different types of cultural heritage organisations – libraries, museums, archives and audiovisual collections – catalogue their content in different ways and to different standards. Approaches also vary in different countries. To make the information searchable, it has to be mapped to a single common standard, known as the Europeana Semantic Elements. This metadata standard at present takes a lowest common denominator approach to the integration of different types of digital content. In 2010 the ''Europeana Data Model'', a richer metadata standard, was introduced to help give users more and better information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Europeana Data Model Documentation|url=http://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-documentation|website=pro.europeana|publisher=Europeana|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Europeana accepts metadata about digital objects, it does not make any decisions about digitisation. The decision about which objects are digitised lies with the organisation that holds the material.

== Strategy ==
In its Strategic Plan for 2011–2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://version1.europeana.eu/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=c4f19464-7504-44db-ac1e-3ddb78c922d7&amp;groupId=10602 |title=Strategic Plan 2011–2015 |publisher=Europeana.eu |accessdate=10 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121132654/http://version1.europeana.eu/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=c4f19464-7504-44db-ac1e-3ddb78c922d7&amp;groupId=10602 |archivedate=21 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was published in January 2011, Europeana outlines four strategic tracks that will shape its further development:
# Aggregate – to build the open trusted source for European cultural and scientific heritage content;
# Facilitate – to support the cultural and scientific heritage sector through knowledge transfer, innovation and advocacy;
# Distribute – to make heritage available to users wherever they are, whenever they want it;
# Engage – to cultivate new ways for users to participate in their cultural and scientific heritage.

The current strategy is for the period 2015-2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Europeana Strategy 2015-2020|url=http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/|website=strategy2020.europeana.eu|publisher=Europeana|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation ==
The Europeana Foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pro.europeana.eu/foundation |title=The Europeana Foundation |publisher= Pro.europeana.eu |accessdate= 25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the governing body of the Europeana service. Its members are the presidents and chairs of European associations for cultural heritage and information associations.

The Foundation promotes collaboration between museums, archives, audiovisual collections and libraries so that users can have integrated access to their content through Europeana and other services.

The Foundation is incorporated under Dutch law as '''Stichting Europeana'''&lt;ref&gt;Stichting Europeana, [[Kamer van Koophandel|Kamer van Koophandel (Chamber of Commerce, Netherlands)]] (KvK) number 27307531, located at Prins Willem-Alexanderhof 5, 's-Gravenhage (The Hague).&lt;/ref&gt; and is housed within the [[Koninklijke Bibliotheek, National Library of the Netherlands|Koninklijke Bibliotheek]], the national library of the Netherlands. It provides a legal framework for the governance of Europeana, employing the staff, bidding for funding and enabling the sustainability of the service.

The executive director of the Europeana Foundation is Harry Verwayen.

== Europeana projects ==
There are a number of projects – the Europeana Group – that are contributing technology solutions and content to Europeana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://group.europeana.eu |title=Europeana Group |accessdate= 10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These projects are run by different cultural heritage institutions, and are part-funded by the [[European Commission]]'s [[EContentplus|eContentplus programme]] and the Information and Communications Technologies Policy Support Programme (ICT PSP).

== Financing ==
Europeana and the projects contributing content to Europeana.eu have been funded by the European Commission under [[eContentplus]], the Information and Communications Technologies Policy Support Programme (ICT PSP) and similar programmes. To participate in a wide range of projects, which are only funded by the Commission for 50–100% of the costs and do not include overheads, Europeana is also reliant for an element of its funding on Member States’ ministries of culture and education.

The '''[[Grammy Award]]''' for '''Best Pop Instrumental Performance''' was awarded between 1969 and 2011.

*In 1969 it was awarded as '''Best Contemporary-Pop Performance, Instrumental'''
*From 1970 to 1971 it was awarded as '''Best  Contemporary Instrumental Performance''' 
*In 1972 it was awarded as '''Best Pop Instrumental Performance'''
*In 1973 it was awarded as '''Best Pop Instrumental Performance by an Instrumental Performer''' 
*From 1974 to 1975 it was again awarded as '''Best Pop Instrumental Performance'''
*From 1986 to 1989 it was awarded as '''Best Pop Instrumental Performance (Orchestra, Group or Soloist)'''
*Since 1990 it has again been awarded as '''Best Pop Instrumental Performance'''
*The award was discontinued from 2011 in a major overhaul of Grammy categories. From 2012, all instrumental performances in the pop category (solo or with a duo/group) were shifted to either the newly formed '''[[Best Pop Solo Performance]]''' or '''[[Best Pop Duo/Group Performance]]''' categories.

A similar award for [[Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Performance|Best Instrumental Performance]] was awarded from 1965 to 1968.  This was also in the pop field, but did not specify pop music.

'''Helmet of eight plates in the Korean style''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: ''{{lang|zh|朝鲜式八板头盔}}'') is a helmet produced between 14th and 16th centuries in either [[Korean peninsula]] or [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This eight plated helmets may have come from Mongolian region. But the current theory is that they were originated in [[North Korea]]n regions.&lt;/ref&gt; This helmet consists of eight plates made of iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/26606 |accessdate=2017-11-21 |author= |publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] |title=Helmet of Eight Plates in the Korean Style }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is speculated that this helmet style was spread to [[Korean peninsula]] from the[[Tibet|Tibetan]] regions. Helmets with similar structure can be seen in [[Tibet]], while both versions of the helmet are made of iron and leather. But Korean-style eight plated helmets are distinguished from those of Tibetan style by its relatively smaller size. Usually a Tibetan-style eight plated helmet measures 21–22 cm in height. But this Korean style helmet measures only 13 cm in height. Currently displayed at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City|New York]], the Korean style helmet measures 24.3 cm in length and 21 cm in width and 1065.9 g in weight.&lt;ref name=la&gt;{{cite book |ref=la |author=La Rocca, Donald J. |title=Recent Acquisitions of Tibetan and Mongolian Arms and Armor in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Part 2. |year=2014 |volume=2 |pages=190-191 |location=New York |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
This kind of helmets called ''Ba Ban'' has historically originated in the 8th century AD. It spanned from 8th century to the 16th century AD. Originally it was seen in [[Tibet]]an region. The reason why it is called the "Helmet of eight plates", because it consists of eight plates made of iron and leather. Surprisingly, many well-preserved eight plated helmets in the Tibetan style can be observed at several Tibetan monasteries’&lt;ref name=tib&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://royaloakarmoury.com/eastern_armour_gallery.php?iden=1 |title=Tibetan Lamellar Helmet |publisher=Royal Oak Armory |author= |accessdate=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tibet|Tibetan]] style helmets are similar to Korean helmets in structure. But [[Tibet]]an ones are quite larger than that of Korean. Usually, a Tibetan style helmet measures 21–22 cm in height and the Korean example at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]] measures only 13 cm in height.&lt;ref name=la /&gt; Since, no enough evidence has been found from the research process, it is controversial whether a chin trap with the helmet was used or not. But neither Korean nor Tibetan eight plated helmets were found themselves with a chin strap.&lt;ref name=tib /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6299">'''Kerry Mitchell''' (born 1961) is an American artist known for his [[algorithmic art|algorithmic]] and [[fractal art]], which has been exhibited at  the [[Nature in Art|Nature in Art Museum]],&lt;ref name=NIA/&gt; [[The Bridges Organization|The Bridges Conference]],&lt;ref name=Bridges/&gt; and the [[Los Angeles Center for Digital Art]],&lt;ref name=LACDA/&gt; and for his "Fractal Art Manifesto".&lt;ref name=Manifesto/&gt;

==Life==
[[File:Mandelbrot Contours.jpg|thumb|Mitchell was inspired by a 1985 article on the [[Mandelbrot set]]. Shown here is a detail, with contours (just outside the boundary of the set).]]

Mitchell was born in [[Iowa]], United States, in 1961. His parents were LeRoy and Shirley Mitchell. His father was an art teacher and mother was a stay-at-home mother until Mitchell started seventh grade. Mitchell was a Presidential Scholar in 1979 and went on to pursue engineering at and graduated from [[Purdue University]] in [[aerospace engineering]], did a master's degree at [[Stanford University]], and then a PhD work at Purdue. He worked at [[NASA]] doing aerospace research. He then worked as a scientist at [[Arizona Science Center]]. He served as a mathematics and science professor at the [[University of Advancing Technology]] in [[Tempe, Arizona]]. As of 2015, he works as a manager at [[Maricopa County Community College District]] in  [[Tempe, Arizona]].&lt;ref name=FrantzCrannell2011&gt;{{cite book |last1=Frantz |first1=Marc |last2=Crannell |first2=Annalisa |title=Viewpoints: Mathematical Perspective and Fractal Geometry in Art |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H85WUaD9f5cC&amp;pg=PA193 |year=2011 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=1-4008-3905-X |pages=193–196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside his technical career, Mitchell works on [[algorithmic art]]. He ascribes his artistic awakening to a 1985 article in ''[[Scientific American]]'' on the [[Mandelbrot set]], explaining:&lt;ref name=FrantzCrannell2011/&gt;

{{quote|Like many others, I was amazed at the beauty that arose from [[iteration|iterating]] such a simple formula. Unlike most, I had the means and inclination to investigate the process further, which fed both sides of me.&lt;ref name=FrantzCrannell2011/&gt;}}

In 1999, Mitchell published his ''Fractal Art Manifesto''.&lt;ref name=Manifesto&gt;{{cite web|author=Mitchell, Kerry |title=The Fractal Art Manifesto |url=https://www.fractalus.com/info/manifesto.htm |publisher=Fractalus.com |accessdate=27 December 2015 |date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--[http://www.kerrymitchellart.com/gallery37/mobius-julia4.html ''Mobius Julia 4'']--&gt; The artist Janet Parke notes that in the manifesto, Mitchell suggests that fractal art cannot be made by a computer alone, and that not everyone who has a computer can necessarily make good fractal art. Instead, she explains, Mitchell is arguing that the artist's creative process is needed to inject elements such as the considered selection of colours and gradients, the merging of multiple layers, and decisions on composition such as by zooming in to a fractal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parke|first1=Janet|title=Fractal Art: A Comparison of Styles|url=http://www.infinite-art.com/index.about.comparison.php|website=Infinite Art|accessdate=27 December 2015|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell also prepared tutorials on how to create fractal art with tools including [[Ultra Fractal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Resources |url=http://www.ultrafractal.com/resources.html |publisher=UltraFractal.com |accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 he served on the panel of the "Fractal Art Contest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Contest Rules |publisher=Fractal Art Contests.com |accessdate=27 December 2015 |url=http://www.fractalartcontests.com/2011/rules.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222074629/http://www.fractalartcontests.com/2011/rules.php |archivedate=22 February 1015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 |ShortSummary    = The anime starts with a scene of war: samurai (swordsmen) vs senshi (people that use guns). More than half of the swordsmen get killed. Yajirō Kojima, the leader of the attack orders the retreat while trying to get the senshi attention to facilitate the others escape. While running he`s cornered and injured, then he hides in a hot spring where he meets Rushuna Tendō who claims to be just an ordinary traveler. She saves him from getting caught by the other senshi, then he departs while warning her that this road is dangerous. The second attack over taking back the castle fails as well. Rushuna appears again and saves Yajiro from getting shot then shots the others, revealing that she is a senshi, a very skilled one. She manages to save the master without killing anyone, as she was taught by a woman revealed at the end of the episode.

The aim is to encourage thoughtful discussion and a love of reading in young people.  The true intent of literature circles is "to allow students to practice and develop the skills and strategies of good readers" (DaLie, 2001).

==Background of literature circles==
Literature circles were first implemented in 1982 by Karen Smith, an elementary school teacher in Phoenix, Arizona.  Handed a box of odd-and-end novels by a fellow teacher, Karen took them and promptly forgot about them.  Later that year, some of her fifth grade students expressed an interest in reading them, organized themselves loosely into groups, and started to discuss the novels.  Smith was surprised at the degree of their engagement with the books and the complexity of their discussions, they had no outside help or instruction from their teacher (Daniels, 1994). From here literature circles evolved into reading, study and discussion groups based around different groupings of students reading a variety of different novels.  They differ from traditional English instruction where students in classroom all read one “core” novel, often looking to the teacher for the answers and the meaning and literary analysis of the text.  They highlight discussion, student response, free choice, and collaboration, "providing a way for students to engage in critical thinking and reflection" ([http://www.litcircles.org Literature Circles Resource Center] Schlick Noe, 2004).  Well-run literature circles highlight student choice; occur over an extended period of time as part of a [[Balanced Literacy]] program; involve numerous structured and unstructured opportunities for student response and interpretation; and incorporate assessment and evaluation that includes self-assessment and numerous extension projects.  Research on literature circles is conducted primarily by [[Harvey Daniels]] (1994, 2002, 2004), [[Katherine L. Schlick Noe]] (1995, 1999, 2001, 2003), Bonnie Campbell Hill (1995, 2001, 2003), and Nancy J. Johnson (1995, 1999, 2001);  they are credited with most of the research and teacher resources around this approach to student choice and reading; however, numerous other researchers, including Kathy Short and Kathryn Mitchell Pierce (1990), Jerome Harste, Kathy Short and Carolyn Burke (1988), Katherine Samway (1991), Suzi Keegan and Karen Shrake (1991)  have conducted research and classroom-based studies.  This approach to reading and learning looks to some of the best practices and theory from [[collaborative learning]] and [[scaffolding theory]].  [[Reader-response criticism]], [[independent reading]], and [[student-centered learning]]  comprise most of the theoretical underpinning of literature circles.

Literature circles combine the best practices of collaborative learning and student-directed learning.  They are not to be confused with [[book discussion club]]s, currently popular in some circles.  While both book clubs and literature circles focus on discussion of books in small group settings, book clubs have a more loosely structured agenda for discussions and are not usually tied into literary analysis such as thematic or symbolic analysis.{{cn|date=April 2014}}  Furthermore, literature circles are the domain of the classroom, both at the elementary and secondary level, and involve various types of [[Educational assessment|assessment]] (including [[self-assessment]], observations and conferences) and [[evaluation]] ([[Career portfolio|portfolios]], projects and student artifacts) by both the teacher and the student. Literature circles are a pedagogically sound alternative to teacher-centered discourse.{{cn|date=April 2014}}  They can be used at all grade and ability levels, and are often credited{{who|date=April 2014}} with instilling a love of reading and discussion in students.  Furthermore, current research indicates that peer collaboration has a positive effect on student learning and performance in Language Arts (Fall ''et al''., 2000), increases student learning, and also improves reading comprehension and content-knowledge (Klinger, Vaugn and Schumm, 1998, cited in Daniels, 2002).

==Key features of literature circles==
#Children choose their own reading materials.
#Small temporary groups are formed, based on book choice.
#Different groups read different books
#Groups meet on a regular predictable schedule.
#Students use written or drawn notes to guide both their reading and discussion.
#Discussion topics come from the students
#Group meetings aim to be open, natural conversations.  Often the conversations digress to topics relating to the students or loosely to the books, but should eventually return to the novel.
#The teacher serves as a facilitator, observer, listener and often a fellow reader, alongside the students.  The teacher is not an instructor.
#Students are given roles or jobs to complete for each group meeting.
#The teacher should model how students should facilitate each role or job.
#Evaluation is by teacher observation and student self-evaluation and should also include extension projects.
#A spirit of playfulness and fun pervades the room.
#New groups form around new reading choices.
(Daniels, 1994)

Discussion prompts can be given by the teacher to encourage a direction for the students' responses, such as "How does the setting affect the characters?"  "What are alternative solutions to the character's conflicts in the text?" "What connections can you make with regard to the character's situation(s)?"

==Implementation considerations==
Students begin literature circles by participating in mini-lessons on how to participate in a discussion group. To begin with they may be given role sheets to assist them in taking notes on their reading and preparing for the discussion.

Sticky notes (e.g. PostIt notes) are often distributed by teachers to assist students in recording their thoughts about text elements, as they make access easy to various pages in the book.  Clip boards may assist children in using their role sheets when groups use floor space to conduct their discussions. 

As group discussions evolve and improve, ideally the role sheets should eventually be used only for redirecting the discussion when students get off-track.  In fact, Daniels notes that "the goal of role sheets is to make the role sheets obsolete" (Daniels, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;75).  What he means by this is that role sheets help students stay on task and focus their discussions.  As students become more comfortable in their groups and learn the level of discourse and response that is expected of them, ideally they will no longer need the role sheets at all: "In many classrooms, the role sheets are abandoned as soon as groups are capable of lively, text-centered, multifaceted discussions" (Daniels, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;75).  Schlick Noe and Johnson note that role sheets take focus and energy away from group discussions:  "Students can learn collaborative and individual accountability strategies to make their discussions work without the constraints of role sheets" (Schlick Noe and Johnson, 1999, cited from [http://www.litcircles.org/Discussion/discussion.html Literature Circles Resource Center)] Most teachers starting out may, however, wish to assign roles to students to help them learn some of the structures of Literature Circles and to aid in classroom management.

==Roles in literature circles==
The following is a list of roles which give a thinking task to each group member.  Students divide the tasks among themselves in each group.  As the groups reconvene each session, students switch roles, so that by the end of the literature circles "unit," each student will have the opportunity to participate in each role.  Again, the ideal is to eventually do away with the roles, although many teachers opt to continue using the roles to assist group on-task behaviour.  One thing to keep in mind:  Readers who are deeply engaged with a book and eager to talk about it with others may not need the structure of roles.  Many teachers discover that the roles feel restrictive to some students and can become a disincentive to take part in literature circles.  Harvey Daniels always intended roles to be a temporary scaffold to support students as they learn to talk about books in small groups.

===Discussion facilitator===
This role involves developing a list of questions that the group might discuss about the section of the novel to be discussed for that meeting.  Questions should be designed to promote lively conversation and insights about the book; they should be [[open questions]].   A person with this task asks these questions of the group to prompt discussion; overall, the job is to keep the group talking and on-task.  Questions that a student might ask could be:  "What was going through your mind when you read this passage?" or "How did the main character change as a result of this incident?"{{sfrac|
|}}{{frac|{{frac|{{mvar|{{math|}}}}|}}|}}

===Commentator===

This role involves locating a few significant passages of text that are thought-provoking, funny, interesting, disturbing, or powerful.  The quotations are copied down with properly cited page numbers.  A student with this task can read the passages out loud him/herself or ask other group members to read as well.  Commentary and discussion will be generated from these passages.
and also draw a part of the scene that locates where the person took place

===Illustrator===

As the term implies, this job entails drawing, sketching, or painting a picture, portrait or scene relating to the appropriate section of the novel.  Collages from magazines, images from the internet, and other media can also be used.  The student with this role then shares the artwork with the group, explaining the passage(s) that relate to the art.  Often students who do not like to write do very well with this role.  The pictures usually generate interesting group conversations.

===Connector or Reflector===

This role involves locating several significant passages in the novel and connecting these passages to real life.  The connections might relate to school, friends or family, home, the community, or they might relate to movies, celebrities, the media etc.  Students should also feel free to connect incidents or characters with other books that they have read.  Of all the roles, this role is often the most personal in its focus.

===Summarizer===

This role involves preparing a brief summary of the reading that was assigned for that day's meeting.  The summary should include the main ideas or events to remember, major characters, symbols or other significant highlights of the passage.  Good summarizers are important to literature circles, as they can help their peers see the overall picture (DaLie, 2001). Also include important events and details.

===Vocabulary Enricher===

Also called the Word Master or Word Wizard, this role is to record important words for that day's reading.  Words that are unusual, unknown, or that stand out in some way are usually chosen by the student.  Their page number and definition is also recorded.  Often students do not see this role as particularly stimulating; however, it can be a role suited to students who are still developing confidence in English classes or textual analysis.

===Travel Tracer===

This role involves recording where the major shifts in action or location take place in the novel for the reading section.  Keeping track of shifts in place, time, and characters helps students keep track of important shifts in the novel.  Artistic students also are drawn to this role, as artwork can be incorporated into this role as well.  The student's role is to describe each setting in detail, using words or maps that illustrate the action.

===Investigator===

This role includes investigative work where background information needs to be found on any topic relating to the book.  Historical, geographical, cultural, musical or other information that would help readers connect to the novel is often researched and shared with the group.  The research is informal in nature, providing small bits of information in order that others can better understand the novel.

===Figurative Language Finder===

This role includes identification of various types of figurative language, including but not limited to simile, metaphor, personification, hyperbole, and idiom.  This may lead to discussion about the author's craft - why the author chose to use those particular words or phrases, and whether or not they were effective.  This in-context identification can be more relevant and memorable than isolated instruction by the teacher of these types of tools.

==Assessment and evaluation of literature circles==
Most teachers assess and evaluate what students do in Literature Circles. This may involve one or several of the following assessment(s) and evaluation(s):
*'''[[Self-Assessment]]'''
**Students should be involved in monitoring and recording their own level of response and engagement with their book and participation with their group as they meet each session. Often formal checklists are used for students to keep track of their progress.
*'''[[Peer group|Peer Assessment]]'''
**Students can also be empowered to assess their fellow group members over the course of their book talks.  As with self-assessment, checklists or other rubrics can provide structure.
*'''Observations'''
**On-going teacher observation and active participation in group discussions is critical in assessing student progress both individually and in whole group.  Daniels (1994) notes that most assessment should be formative, ensuring that students are provided with timely feedback to learn more effectively.  Observations can meet such formative assessment criteria.
*'''Conferences'''
**Face-to-face conversations between student and teacher can help to "access, track and monitor student growth" (Daniels, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;160).
*'''[[Career portfolio|Portfolios]]'''
**Collections of student products, collected and assembled in a meaningful fashion, provide the opportunity for reflection, discussion, response to the book, and displaying a student's best work.  Portfolios can take on many forms, ranging from writing, art, video/audiotapes, learning logs, student journals, personal responses etc. (Daniels, 1994).
*'''Extension Projects'''
**Extension Projects can take the form of numerous creative and artistic student products, from book jackets to visual media or printed forms.  Projects provide readers with "additional ways to revisit what they've read, continue the conversations (and the discoveries), and create even more meaning" (Schlick Noe &amp; Johnson, [http://www.litcircles.org Literature Circles Resource Center)].  More conversations about the books usually arise out of sharing of these projects with the group and the whole class.
*'''Student Artifacts'''
**Response logs, role sheets, and other process material that students have compiled over the course of the Literature Circle meetings can be also evaluated providing "a rich source of insight" (Daniels, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;164) for the teacher to assess growth and progress of students.
*'''Wikis and Blogs'''
**Students may blog on a teacher created website.  This blog will not only facilitate conversation, but implement technology.  The blog will also give teachers a means by which to grade and assess the quality of student comprehension. Blogs enable students to share ideas, read class notes, and give feedback to the class.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6774">"'''Lobachevsky'''" is a humorous song by [[Tom Lehrer]], referring to the mathematician [[Nikolai Lobachevsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dmdb.org/lyrics/lehrer.revisited.html#6 |title=Lobachevsky |publisher=The Demented Music Database |accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Lehrer, the song is "not intended as a slur on [Lobachevsky's] character" and the name was chosen "solely for [[prosodic]] reasons".&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes, "The Tom Lehrer Collection", ''Shout!'' Factory, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bessman"/&gt;

In the introduction, Lehrer describes the song as an adaptation of a routine that [[Danny Kaye]] did to honor the Russian actor [[Constantin Stanislavski]].&lt;ref name="bessman"/&gt; (The Danny Kaye routine is sung from the perspective of a famous Russian actor who learns and applies Stanislavski's secret to method acting: "Suffer.") &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXI2djKeerQ The Stanislavski routine] performed on the Danny Kaye Radio Show &lt;/ref&gt; Lehrer sings the song from the point of a view of a preeminent Russian mathematician who learns, from Lobachevsky, that [[plagiarism]] is the secret of success in mathematics (though adding "only be sure always to call it please '[[research]]'"). The narrator later uses this strategy to get a paper published ahead of a rival, then to write a book and earn a fortune selling the movie rights.

Lehrer wrote that he did not know [[Russian language|Russian]]. In the song he quotes two book reviews in Russian; the first is a long sentence that he then translates succinctly as "It stinks". The second, a different but equally long sentence, is also translated as "It stinks." The actual text of these sentences bear no relation to academics: the first phrase quotes [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s ''Song of the Flea'': "Once there was a king who had a pet flea." The second references a Russian joke: "Now I must go where even the Tsar goes on foot" [the bathroom].&lt;ref name="lobachevsky.htm"&gt;{{cite web |title="Lobachevsky" Words and music by Tom Lehrer |url=http://www.haverford.edu/physics/songs/lehrer/lobachevsky.htm |publisher=PhysicsSongs.org |accessdate=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was first performed as part of ''The Physical Revue,'' a 1951–1952 musical [[revue]] by Lehrer and a few other professors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Physical Revue, by Tom Lehrer |url=http://www.haverford.edu/astronomy/songs/lehrer/physrev.htm |publisher=PhysicsSongs.org |accessdate=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is track 6 on ''[[Songs by Tom Lehrer]]'', which was re-released as part of ''[[Songs &amp; More Songs by Tom Lehrer]]'' and ''[[The Remains of Tom Lehrer]]''. In this early version, [[Ingrid Bergman]] is named to star in the role of "[[Hypotenuse]]" in ''The Eternal Triangle'', a film purportedly based on the narrator's book.&lt;ref name="Calder2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nigel Calder|title=Magic Universe: A Grand Tour of Modern Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E4NfZ9FDcc8C&amp;pg=PT639 |year=2005 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-162235-9|page=639}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was recorded again for ''[[Revisited (Tom Lehrer album)]]'', with [[Brigitte Bardot]] as Hypotenuse. A third recording is included in ''[[Tom Lehrer Discovers Australia (And Vice Versa)]]'', a live album recorded in Australia, featuring [[Marilyn Monroe]] as Hypotenuse. A fourth recording was made in 1966 when ''Songs by Tom Lehrer'' was reissued in stereo, with [[Doris Day]] playing Hypotenuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dmdb.org/lyrics/lehrer.diff.html |title=Tom Lehrer lyric variations |date=April 2, 1995 |publisher=The Demented Music Database |accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lobachevsky.htm"/&gt;

The '''''Madonna Litta''''' is a late 15th-century painting, traditionally attributed to [[Leonardo da Vinci]], in the [[Hermitage Museum]], Saint Petersburg. It depicts the [[Madonna (art)|Virgin Mary]] breastfeeding the [[Child Jesus|Christ child]], a devotional subject known as the ''[[Nursing Madonna|Madonna lactans]]''. The figures are set in a dark interior with two arched openings, as in Leonardo's earlier ''[[Madonna of the Carnation]]'', and a mountainous landscape in [[aerial perspective]] can be seen beyond. In his left hand Christ holds a [[European Goldfinch|goldfinch]], which is symbolic of his future [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]].

Scholarly opinion is divided on the work's attribution, with some believing it to be the work of a [[Leonardeschi|pupil of Leonardo]] such as [[Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio]] or [[Marco d'Oggiono]]; the Hermitage Museum, however, considers the painting to be an autograph work by Leonardo. The painting takes its name from the [[Litta|House of Litta]], a [[Milan]]ese noble family in whose collection it was for much of the nineteenth century.

==History==
The ''Madonna Litta'' might be one of the paintings of the Madonna and Child recorded in Leonardo's studio before or during his first Milanese period ({{circa}}1481–3 to 1499). On a drawing in the [[Uffizi]] Leonardo noted that he had begun “two Virgin Maries” in late 1478 and an inventory of his studio written in 1482 (part of the [[Codex Atlanticus]]) again mentions two paintings of “Our Lady”. The second of these is, according to different interpretations, either noted as being “almost finished, in profile” or “finished, almost in profile”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kemp|2001|pp=263 and 293, n. 640}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Virgin's head in the ''Madonna Litta'' could be described either way, and it has therefore been argued that the painting was begun in Leonardo's first [[Florence|Florentine]] period and left unfinished until it was later worked up by a pupil in Milan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kemp|2006|pp=32–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific analysis of the painting has, however, suggested that it was produced by only one artist.&lt;ref name="London 222"&gt;{{Harvnb|Syson|Keith|Galansino|Mazzotta |2011|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Léonard de Vinci - Codex Vallardi 2376 r.jpg|thumb|left|Leonardo da Vinci, ''Head of a young woman in near profile''. Metalpoint heightened with white lead on grey prepared paper, 17.9 x 16.8 cm. Louvre, Cabinet des dessins, Codex Vallardi 2376 [[recto and verso|recto]].|alt=]]

Several drawings have been identified as preparatory to the ''Madonna Litta''. One, which is universally attributed to Leonardo, is a [[metalpoint]] drawing of a young woman’s face in near profile, part of the Codex Vallardi in the [[Louvre]] (''left''). There is evidence that this sheet was used as an ''exemplum'' for teaching pupils in Leonardo’s workshop; on the reverse another artist has traced the outline of the face in pen and ink, a technique Leonardo himself used when developing compositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Syson|Keith|Galansino|Mazzotta |2011|pp=228–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further evidence of pupils copying the drawing comes in the form of a direct copy, by a rather uncertain draughtsman, on a sheet which was turned over and reused for a different drawing by another sixteenth-century artist; this is now in the [[Städel]] in Frankfurt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Syson|Keith|Galansino|Mazzotta |2011|pp=230–1}} (cat. no. 60)&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other drawings, in metalpoint with [[white lead]] highlights on blue prepared paper, are attributed to a follower of Leonardo, usually considered to be [[Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio]]. One, a study for the Christ child's head, is in the [[Fondation Custodia]] in Paris; the other, in the [[Kupferstichkabinett Berlin|Kupferstichkabinett]] in Berlin, is a drapery study for the Virgin’s garments. These have been attributed to Boltraffio on the basis of the Berlin drawing's similarity to other drapery studies by the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Syson|Keith|Galansino|Mazzotta |2011|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the Paris and Berlin drawings are preparatory studies for the ''Madonna Litta'' rather than copies after it, as the drapery study shows more of the Virgin’s right arm than the finished work, in which this is obscured by Christ’s head. This suggests that the composition was partly pieced together from these studies.

A further related drawing in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], attributed to Boltraffio, is of the Virgin's face in strict profile and does not resemble the finished painting in the Hermitage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/19.76.3|title=Head of a Woman in Profile to Lower Left|work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that this study might represent an earlier idea by a pupil for the composition of the ''Madonna Litta'', which the master Leonardo then “corrected” with the drawing in the Louvre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|2003|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Times'' reported on 9 April 2017 that [[Martin Kemp (art historian)|Martin Kemp]] has now demoted the Hermitage Museum’s ''Litta Madonna'' (which was included as a Leonardo in the National Gallery’s 2011-12 exhibition) from Leonardo to Boltraffio&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artwatch.org.uk/tag/robert-simon/|title=» Robert Simon Artwatch|website=artwatch.org.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Attribution==
That the painting was regarded in Leonardo's lifetime as his work is suggested by the large number of copies made of it. A popular candidate for authorship is [[Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio]]. David Alan Brown argues that [[Marco d'Oggiono]] was responsible for the ''Madonna Litta'' as its composition is reflected in his later works, whereas it is not in those of Boltraffio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|2003|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the major exhibition on Leonardo's first Milanese period held at the [[National Gallery]] in London in 2011–12 the painting was attributed to Leonardo, but one art historian has remarked that this was “presumably a condition of the loan”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/The-National-Gallerys-blockbuster-exhibition-could-mark-a-turning-point-for-Leonardo-scholars/25515|title=The National Gallery’s blockbuster exhibition could mark a turning point for Leonardo scholars|first=Martin|last=Kemp|author-link=Martin Kemp (art historian)|date=1 February 2012|work=[[The Art Newspaper]]|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
It has been speculated that Leonardo might have taken the ''Madonna Litta'' with him to Venice in March 1500, as the diarist [[Marcantonio Michiel]] apparently recorded its presence in the [[House of Contarini|Ca' Contarini]] in that city in 1543:

{{quote|There is a little picture, of a foot or a little more, of an Our Lady, half length, who gives milk to the little boy, coloured by the hand of Leonardo da Vinci, a work of great power and highly finished.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Syson|Keith|Galansino|Mazzotta |2011|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A foot in Venetian measurements was 34.7cm, rather less than the height of the painting in the Hermitage and closer to its width.&lt;ref name="London 224"&gt;{{Harvnb|Syson|Keith|Galansino|Mazzotta |2011|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest print of the composition is Venetian, by an artist in the circle of [[Zoan Andrea]], and at least one painted copy by the Venetian school is known, in the Museo di Castelvecchio in Verona.

In 1784, the earliest secure date in its provenance, the painting was bought by Prince Alberico XII di Belgioioso from one Giuseppe Ro. After Belgioioso's death in 1813 it passed into the collection of the [[Litta]] family, from whom it takes its current name. In 1865 the Russian Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] acquired the panel from Count Antonio Litta,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Syson|Keith|Galansino|Mazzotta |2011|p=224}}, n. 5&lt;/ref&gt; quondam minister to Saint Petersburg, for the [[Hermitage Museum]], where it has been exhibited to this day. Upon acquiring the painting the Hermitage had it [[Transfer of panel paintings|transferred from wood to canvas]].

'''Manic Street Preachers''' are a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[rock music|rock]] band, formed in 1986 in [[Blackwood, Caerphilly]] and consisting of cousins [[James Dean Bradfield]] (lead vocals, [[lead guitar]]), and [[Sean Moore (musician)|Sean Moore]] (drums, percussion, soundscapes), plus [[Nicky Wire]] (bass guitar, lyrics). They are often colloquially known as '''The Manics'''. Following the release of their first single, "[[Suicide Alley]]", the band was joined by [[Richey Edwards]] as co-lyricist and [[rhythm guitar]]ist. The band's early albums were in a [[Punk rock|punk]] vein, eventually broadening to a greater [[alternative rock]] sound, whilst retaining a [[left-wing politics|leftist]] politicisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.richeyedwards.net/28nov08independent.html |title=Final Farewell for a Cult Hero |website=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their early combination of androgynous [[glam rock|glam]] imagery and lyrics about "culture, alienation, boredom and despair" has gained them a loyal following and [[Cult following|cult]] status.&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt;

With their debut album, ''[[Generation Terrorists]]'', the Manic Street Preachers proclaimed it would be the "greatest rock album ever",&lt;ref name="Pitchfork"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5073-lipstick-traces-a-secret-history-of-manic-street-preachers/ |title=Manic Street Preachers: ''Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of Manic Street Preachers''|last=Tangari |first=Joe |date=23 February 2004 |website=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] |accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as hoping to sell "sixteen million copies" around the world, after which they would split up.&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt; Despite the album's failure to meet this level of success, the band carried on with their career. The group became a trio after [[Richey Edwards#Disappearance|Richey Edwards disappeared]] in February 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/manic-street-preachers/pages/richey.shtml |title=BBC Wales – Music – Manic Street Preachers – Richey Edwards |website=[[BBC Cymru Wales|BBC Wales]] |accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band went on to gain critical and commercial success in spite of his absence. Edwards was legally "presumed dead" in 2008.

Throughout their career, the Manics have headlined several festivals including [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]], [[T in the Park]], [[V Festival]] and [[Reading Festival|Reading]], won eleven [[NME Awards]], eight [[Q (magazine)|Q Awards]] and four [[BRIT Awards]].&lt;ref name="brits.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brits.co.uk/artist/manic-street-preachers |title=Manic Street Preachers – BRITs Profile |website=brits.co.uk |accessdate=6 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915053946/http://www.brits.co.uk/artist/manic-street-preachers |archivedate=15 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been nominated for the [[Mercury Prize]] in 1996 and 1999, and have had one nomination for the [[MTV Europe Music Awards]]. The group has reached number 1 in the UK charts three times: in 1998, with the album ''[[This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours]]'' and the single "[[If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next]]", and again in 2000 with the single "[[The Masses Against the Classes]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1999/02/99/brit_awards/264746.stm |title=From Despair to Success |date=12 February 1999 |website=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have sold more than ten million albums worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.gigwise.com/features/107075/manic-street-preachers-everything-must-go-interview---new-album-tour|title= Manic Street Preachers: 'These are the last burning flames of rock n' roll'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Formation and early years (1986–1991) ===

Manic Street Preachers formed in 1986 at [[Oakdale Comprehensive School]], [[Blackwood, Caerphilly|Blackwood]], [[South Wales]], which all the band members attended.&lt;ref name="Monikers" /&gt; Bradfield and the slightly older Moore are cousins, and shared bunkbeds in the Bradfield family home after Moore's parents divorced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/manic-street-preachers/pages/james.shtml |title=BBC Wales - Music - Manic Street Preachers - James Dean Bradfield |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=3 December 2008 |accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the band's early years, Bradfield, alongside the classically trained Moore, primarily wrote the music while Wire focused on the lyrics. The origin of the band's name remains unclear, but the most often-told story relates that Bradfield, while busking one day in [[Cardiff]], got into an altercation with someone (sometimes said to be a homeless man)&lt;ref name = "Monikers"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/whats-in-a-band-name-here-are-the-stories-behind-the-monikers-807597.html |title= What's in a Band Name? Here Are the Stories Behind the Monikers – Features – Music – The Independent |date= 11 April 2008 |website= [[The Independent]] |accessdate= 25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who asked him "What are you, boyo, some kind of manic street preacher?"&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt;

Original bassist Flicker (Miles Woodward) left the band in early 1988, reportedly because he believed that the band were moving away from their punk roots.&lt;ref name="Price"&gt;{{cite book |last= Price |first= Simon |date= 20 March 1999 |title= Everything (A Book About Manic Street Preachers) |publisher= [[Virgin Books]] |isbn= 0753501392}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band continued as a three-piece, with Wire switching from guitar to bass,&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt; and in 1988 they released their first single, "[[Suicide Alley]]". Despite its recording quality, this punk ode to youthful escape provides an early insight into both Bradfield's guitar work and Moore's live drumming, the latter of which would be absent from the band's first LP.&lt;ref name=Discography&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson |first=Andy |url=https://manicsdiscog.wordpress.com/2013/01/10/a1-suicide-alley/ |title=[A1&amp;#93; ‘Suicide Alley’ &amp;#124; Manic Street Preachers: A Critical Discography |website=Manicsdiscog.wordpress.com |date=2013-01-10 |accessdate=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Manics intended to restore revolution to [[rock and roll]] at a time when Britain was dominated by [[shoegaze]] and acid house. The ''[[New Musical Express|NME]]'' gave "Suicide Alley" an enthusiastic review, citing a press release by Richey Edwards: "We are as far away from anything in the '80s as possible."&lt;ref name="AllMusic2"/&gt;

After the release of "Suicide Alley," Edwards joined the band on rhythm guitar and contributed to lyrics alongside Wire. Edwards also designed record sleeves and artwork, and drove the band to and from gigs.&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt;

In 1990 the Manic Street Preachers signed a deal with label [[Damaged Goods Records]] for one [[Extended play|EP]]. The four-track ''[[New Art Riot E.P.]]'' attracted as much media interest for its attacks on fellow musicians as for the actual music.&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt; With the help of Hall or Nothing management, the Manics signed to [[Independent record label|indie]] label [[Heavenly Records]]. The band recorded their first single for the label, entitled "[[Motown Junk]]".

Their next single, "[[You Love Us (Heavenly Version)|You Love Us]]", sampled [[Krzysztof Penderecki]]'s "[[Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima]]" as well as [[Iggy Pop]]. The video featured Nicky Wire in [[Cross dressing|drag]] as [[Marilyn Monroe]] and contained visual references to the film ''[[Betty Blue]]'' and to [[Aleister Crowley]]. In an interview with then-''NME'' journalist [[Steve Lamacq]], Edwards carved the phrase "4REAL" into his arm with a razor blade to prove their sincerity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nme.com/photos/richey-edwards-remembered/121944/11/3 |title= Pictures of Richey Edwards Remembered – Photos – nme.com |website= [[NME]] |accessdate= 14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was taken to hospital and received seventeen stitches.&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt;

As a result of their controversial behaviour, the Manics quickly became favourites of the British music press, which helped them build a rabidly dedicated following.&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"&gt;

[[File:Manic Street Preachers2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Manic Street Preachers in Chicago circa 1992]]

The band's debut album, ''[[Generation Terrorists]]'', was released in 1992 on the [[Columbia Records]] imprint. The liner notes contained a literary quote for each of the album's eighteen songs and the album lasted just over seventy minutes. The album's lyrics are politicised like those of [[the Clash]] and [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/wales/posts/john_robb_on_manic_street_preachers |title=BBC – Blogs – John Robb on Manic Street Preachers |last=McLaren |first=James |date=9 February 2012 |website=[[BBC Online]] |accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the album's songs regularly switching from a critical focus on global [[capitalism]] to more personal tales of despair and the struggles of youth. About the musical style of the album [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] writer Joe Tangari wrote that ''Generation Terrorists'' "walked a weird line between agit-[[Punk rock|punk]], [[cock rock]], romantic melodicism and [[Glam rock|glam]], and was so obviously patterned after the Clash's ''[[London Calling]]'' that it was actually kind of cute."&lt;ref name="Pitchfork"/&gt;

Other tracks combine personal and political themes, implicating a connection between global [[capitalism]] and personal struggle; "Nat West-Barclays-Midlands-Lloyds" was written as a critique of overseas banking credit policies, but also concerned [[Richey Edwards]]' issues involving overdrafts and refused loans.{{sfn|Price|1999|p=76}} Marc Burrows of [[Drowned in Sound]] considered the song to be an accurate prediction of "global financial meltdown" and its effects on everyday life.&lt;ref name="Burrows"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4145695-manics-monday--rain-down-alienation-generation-terrorists%E2%80%99-key-tracks |title=Manics Monday: Rain Down Alienation – ''Generation Terrorists'' Key Tracks.|last=Burrows |first=Marc |date=5 November 2012 |website=[[Drowned in Sound]] |accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single "[[Motorcycle Emptiness]]", meanwhile, criticises [[consumerism]] as a "shallow dream"{{sfn|Price|1999|p=76}} that makes human life overtly commercialised.&lt;ref name="Burrows"/&gt; "[[Little Baby Nothing]]", a duet between [[Traci Lords]] and Bradfield, was described by Priya Elan of the ''[[NME]]'' as a "perfect snapshot of [female] innocence bodysnatched and twisted".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=10&amp;title=manic_street_preachers_their_10_best_tra&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1 |title=Manic Street Preachers – Their 10 Best Tracks |last=Elan |first=Priya |date=7 October 2011 |website=[[NME]] |accessdate=30 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008113059/http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=10&amp;title=manic_street_preachers_their_10_best_tra&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1 |archivedate=8 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The record contained six singles and sold 250,000 copies.&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt; The success of 1996's ''[[Everything Must Go (Manic Street Preachers album)|Everything Must Go]]'' at the 1997 [[Brit Awards]] ensured that sales of ''Generation Terrorists'' and subsequent albums ''[[Gold Against the Soul]]'' and ''[[The Holy Bible (album)|The Holy Bible]]'' enjoyed a late surge; the band's debut sold an extra 110,000 copies.&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt; The band also made a cover version of the song "[[Suicide Is Painless]]" which peaked at number 7 in the UK charts, spending 3 weeks in the Top 10, and giving the band their first ever Top 10 hit single.&lt;ref name="UK charts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/manic%20street%20preachers/ |title=Manic Street Preachers |website=[[Official Charts Company|Official Charts]] |accessdate=21 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615114536/http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/manic%20street%20preachers/ |archivedate=15 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's second album, ''[[Gold Against the Soul]]'', displayed a more commercial, [[grunge|grungy]] sound which served to alienate both fans and the band itself. It was released to mixed reviews but still performed well, reaching number eight in the UK album chart. The album presents a different sound from their debut album, not only in terms of lyrics but in sound, the band privileged long guitar riffs, and the drums themselves feel more present and loud in the final mix of the album. This sound would be abandoned in their next album and as for the nature of the lyrics they also changed, with Edwards and Wire eschewing their political fire for introspective [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]].&lt;ref name="Price 1999"&gt;Price (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[AllMusic]], the album "takes the [[hard rock]] inclinations of ''Generation Terrorists'' to an extreme."&lt;ref name="Erlewine"/&gt;

The band also stated that the choice to work with [[Dave Eringa]] again was important for this album: "We finished work in November and then just went straight into a demo studio and we came out about four weeks later with the album all finished. We were all happy with all the songs, we knew what they wanted to sound like, so we didn't want to use a mainstream producer because they've got their own sound and vision of what a record should be like. So we just phoned Dave up and said 'Look, come down, let's see how this works out', and everyone loved what we were doing, so we decided to stay with him."&lt;ref name="Price 1999"/&gt;

The band have described ''Gold Against the Soul'' as their least favourite album and the period surrounding the album as being the most unfocused of their career. The band's vocalist and guitarist [[James Dean Bradfield]] has said "All we wanted to do was go under the corporate wing. We thought we could ignore it but you do get affected."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=James Dean Bradfield of the Manic Street Preachers on a Year of Hospital Horror... |magazine=[[Select (magazine)|Select]] |url=http://www.thisisyesterday.com/ints/horror.html |accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|quote= "It’s all about self-discipline. Like, self-obsession is connected completely with self-loathing, and it’s the same with, if you’ve got a weight problem. It’s all about... finding some worth in yourself, knowing that you’ve got the discipline to do it, and knowing that other people maybe can’t do it. And it’s also, I think, really connected to the fact that you almost feel, like, silent, you have no voice, you’re mute, there’s just no, you’ve got no option. Even if you could express yourself nobody would listen anyway. Things that go on inside you, there’s no other way to get rid of them."|source=—Edwards, about his condition|width=25%|align=left|style=padding:8px;}}

By early 1994, Edwards' personal difficulties became worse and began to affect the other band members as well as himself. He was admitted into [[The Priory]] in 1994 to overcome his problems and the band played a few festivals as a three-piece to pay for his treatment.&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt;

The group's next album, ''[[The Holy Bible (album)|The Holy Bible]]'', was released in August to critical acclaim, but sold poorly. The album displayed yet another musical and aesthetic change for the band, largely featuring army/navy uniforms. Musically, ''The Holy Bible'' marks a shift from the [[modern rock]] sound of their first two albums, ''[[Generation Terrorists]]'' and ''[[Gold Against the Soul]]''.&lt;ref name="O'Neil"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/manicstreetpreachers-holybible2005/ |title=Manic Street Preachers: ''The Holy Bible'' –– 10th Anniversary Edition|last=O'Neil |first=Tim |date=19 May 2005 |website=[[PopMatters]] |accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the album's [[alternative rock]] sound the album incorporates various elements from other musical genres, such as [[hard rock]],&lt;ref name="Erlewine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-holy-bible-mw0000123614 |title=''The Holy Bible'' – Manic Street Preachers Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards|last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[punk rock|British punk]], [[post-punk]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gigwise.com/photos/94508/manic-street-preachers-the-holy-bible-ranked |title=Manic Street Preachers' ''The Holy Bible'': The Tracks Ranked|last=Threndall |first=Andrew |date=23 September 2014 |accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[new wave music|new wave]], [[industrial music|industrial]], [[art rock]] and [[gothic rock]].&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/7538 |title=NME Reviews – Manic Street Preachers : ''The Holy Bible'' (Tenth Anniversary Edition)|last=Martin |first=Dan |date=12 September 2005 |website=[[NME]] |accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lyrically the album deals with subjects including prostitution, American [[consumerism]], British [[imperialism]], [[freedom of speech]], [[the Holocaust]], self-starvation, [[serial killer]]s, the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]], political revolution, childhood, [[fascism]] and suicide.&lt;ref name="Testament"&gt;{{cite journal |date=27 August 1994 |title=Manics New Testament |journal=[[Melody Maker]] |publisher=IPC Media |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'': "the tone of the album is by turns bleak, angry and resigned".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=May 1997 |title=Manic Street Preachers article|magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] |publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]] |page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also an element of autobiographic subjects, like in the song "[[4st 7lb]]" where the lyrics clearly tackle Richey's own experience and life. The song was named after 4 [[Stone (unit)|stones]] 7 [[Pound (mass)|pounds]], or {{convert|63|lbs|kg}}, because it is the weight below which death is said to be medically unavoidable for an anorexic sufferer.{{sfn|Clarke|1997|p=106}}

The title "The Holy Bible" was chosen by Edwards to reflect an idea, according to Bradfield, that "everything on there has to be perfection".{{sfn|Clarke|1997|p=117}} Interviewed at the end of 1994, Edwards said: "The way religions choose to speak their truth to the public has always been to beat them down [...] I think that if a Holy Bible is true, it should be about the way the world is and that's what I think my lyrics are about. [The album] doesn't pretend things don't exist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Interview with Richey Edwards |series=Artistspecial |station=[[ZTV]] |location=[[Stockholm]] |airdate=December 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{listen |filename=Motorcycle_emptiness.ogg|title="Motorcycle Emptiness"|description=The song has a different pace from all the other songs in the album. The lyrics were written by Richey and Nicky and presents a metaphor for the capitalist world.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Ben Patashnik of [[Drowned in Sound]] later said that the album in the time of its release "didn't sell very well, but its impact was felt keenly by anyone who'd ever come into contact with the Manics", and that it is now a "masterpiece [...] the sound of one man in a close-knit group of friends slowly disintegrating and using his own anguish to create some of the most brilliant art to be released on a large scale as music in years [...] It's not a suicide note; it's a warning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/2975947-discography-reassessed--the-manics-in-perspective |title=Discography reassessed: the Manics in perspective |last=Patashnik |first=Ben |date=25 February 2008 |work=[[Drowned in Sound]] |accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In support of the album the band appeared on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', performing its first single, "[[Faster (Manic Street Preachers song)|Faster]]", which reached No.&amp;nbsp;16. The performance was extremely controversial at the time, as the band were all dressed in army regalia. Bradfield wore a "terrorist-style" [[Balaclava (clothing)|balaclava]]. At the time, the band was told by the [[BBC]] that they had received the most complaints ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1831497,00.html |title='You Woke Up on a Thursday and It Smelled Like a ''Top of the Pops'' Day' |last1=Simpson |first1=Dave |last2=Lynskey |first2=Dorian |date=29 July 2006 |website=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album eventually has sold over 600,000 copies worldwide and is frequently listed among the greatest records ever recorded.&lt;ref name="Newsnight"&gt;{{cite news |title=Quintessential ''Newsnight'' |website=[[BBC Online|bbc.co.uk]] |publisher=BBC |date=5 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first album without Edwards, ''[[Everything Must Go (Manic Street Preachers album)|Everything Must Go]]'', was released on 20 May 1996. The band had chosen to work with new producer [[Mike Hedges]], mainly for his work on [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]' single "[[Swimming Horses]]" that Bradfield rated highly.&lt;ref name=quiet/&gt; Hedges had already been approached before to produce ''The Holy Bible'' but he wasn't available at the time.&lt;ref name=quiet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/20332-manic-street-preachers-everything-must-go-interview-simon-price|title=And If You Need An Explanation: Manic Street Preachers interviewed |publisher=Thequietus.com |first=Simon |last=Price |date=2 June 2016 |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Everything Must Go'' debuted on the [[UK Albums Chart]] at number 2, so far the album has gone [[RIAA certification|Triple Platinum]] in the UK and is their most successful album to date, spending 103 weeks in the Top 100 with the album still in the Top 5 a year after its release.&lt;ref name="UK charts"/&gt; Containing five songs either written or co-written by Edwards the album was released to overwhelmingly positive reviews. Lyrically the themes were different from their previous effort, instead of introspective and autobiographical tracks such as "4st 7lb", Wire's predilection for historical and political themes dominates, like the No. 2 hit single "[[A Design for Life]]". The song was the first to be written and released by the band following the mysterious disappearance of figurehead [[Richey Edwards]] the previous year and was used as the opening track on ''[[Forever Delayed]]'', the band's greatest hits album released in November 2002.

Much later on, interviewed in 2014 by ''[[NME]]'' for their "Song Stories" video series, singer/guitarist James Dean Bradfield recalled that the lyric had been a fusion of two sets of lyrics-"Design for Life" and "Pure Motive"-sent to him from Wales by bassist Nicky Wire, while he was living in [[Shepherd's Bush]]. The music was written "in about ten minutes" and Bradfield felt a sense of euphoria with the result. The song was credited with having "rescued the band" from the despair felt after the disappearance of Edwards, with Wire describing the song as "a bolt of light from a severely dark place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T4UgrW7tLw |title=How Writing 'A Design For Life' Saved Manic Street Preachers – Interview |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was shortlisted for the 1996 [[Mercury Prize]] award for best album, and won the band two [[Brit Awards]] for Best British Band and Best British Album,&lt;ref name="brits.co.uk"/&gt; as well as yielding the hit singles "[[Australia (Manic Street Preachers song)|Australia]]", "[[Everything Must Go (song)|Everything Must Go]]" and "[[Kevin Carter (song)|Kevin Carter]]".

Subjects tackled on the album include the tragic life of the photographer [[Kevin Carter]], on the track of the same name, [[Willem de Kooning]] and the maltreatment of animals in captivity on "Small Black Flowers That Grow in the Sky" (which is a quote from the film ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]''). The latter track, with lyrics by Edwards, can also be interpreted as an exploration of his mental state before his disappearance; the line "Here chewing your tail is joy" for instance may be as much about Richey's [[self-harm]] as it is the tormented self-injury of zoo animals. It was their most direct and mature record to date and it established the Manics as superstars throughout the world.&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"/&gt;

The album has sold over two million copies around the world, and it is still considered one of the finest releases of the decade,&lt;ref name=Clash&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/features/manic-street-preachers-the-complete-guide|title=Manic Street Preachers: The Complete Guide|website=Clashmusic.com|accessdate=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; a classic album from the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/nme_writers.htm#ClassicAlbums&amp;Singles|title= NME classic albums and singles|website=Rocklistmusic.com|accessdate=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and frequently voted in polls in the category of best albums of all time by many publications.&lt;ref name=NME2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/nme_500_greatest_albums_2013.htm|title=500 Greatest Albums Of All Time|website=Rocklistmusic.com|accessdate=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 the band performed a special gig at the [[Manchester Arena]] for more than 20,000 people. Bassist Nicky Wire said that was the moment he knew that the band had "made it".&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt; The recording was released as a [[VHS]] video on 29 September 1997, and has only been reissued on DVD in Japan.

With their fifth album, the group also had a No. 1 single, "[[If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next]]". The song's theme is taken from the [[Spanish Civil War]], and the idealism of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] volunteers who joined the [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[International Brigades]] fighting for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]] against [[Francisco Franco]]'s military rebels. The song takes its name from a [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] poster of the time, displaying a photograph of a young child killed by the [[Foreign involvement in the Spanish Civil War#Use of the Spanish Civil War as weapons testing ground|Nationalists]] under a sky of bombers with the stark warning "If you tolerate this, your children will be next" written at the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/1122 |title=Madrid.

The album also included the hit singles "[[You Stole the Sun from My Heart]]", "[[Tsunami (Manic Street Preachers song)|Tsunami]]" and "[[The Everlasting (song)|The Everlasting]]". The Manics won Best British Band and Album awards at the BRIT Awards in 1999.&lt;ref name="brits.co.uk"/&gt; ''This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours'' was also shortlisted for the 1999 [[Mercury Prize]] and the band received a further nomination in the category of Best UK &amp; Ireland Act in the 1999 [[MTV Europe Music Award]]s, where the band performed live the single ''If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next''. In the [[NME Awards]] in 1999, the band won every single big prize, Best Band, Best Album, Best Live Act, Best Single and Best Video, nailing also the prize for Best Band In The World Today in the [[Q Awards]] 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/bestalbumsandtracksoftheyear/1998 |title=Albums and Tracks of the Year |website=[[NME]] |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After headlining [[Glastonbury Festival]], [[T in the Park]] and [[V Festival]], the band played the [[Leaving the 20th Century]] concert at the [[Millennium Stadium]] in Cardiff on 31 December 1999, the first concert to be held there, with 57,000 people attending and the final song being broadcast around the world by satellite as part of [[2000 Today]]. The concert is available on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]]. Subtitled English lyrics, available as an extra, contain errors when compared to the official lyrics in the band's album booklets and in between some of the tracks there are interview clips where the band discusses their history and the songs.&lt;ref name="Larkin2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Larkin|title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music: Kollington – Morphine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgwKAQAAMAAJ|year=2006|publisher=MUZE|isbn=978-0-19-531373-4|pages=475–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, they released the limited edition single "[[The Masses Against the Classes]]". Despite receiving little promotion, the single sold 76,000 copies in its first week and reached number one in the [[UK Singles Chart]] on 16 January 2000, being the first new number one of the 21st Century and beating "U Know What's Up" by [[Donell Jones]] to the top. The catalogue entry for the single was deleted (removed from wholesale supply) on the day of release, but the song nevertheless spent 9 weeks in the UK chart.&lt;ref name="UK charts"/&gt;

In 2001, they became the first popular Western rock band to play in Cuba (at the [[Karl Marx Theater]]), and met with president [[Fidel Castro]]. Their concert and trip to Cuba was documented and then released as a DVD entitled ''[[Louder Than War]]''. At this concert they revealed many tracks from their upcoming sixth album, ''[[Know Your Enemy (Manic Street Preachers album)|Know Your Enemy]]'', which was released on 19 March. The [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] political convictions of the Manic Street Preachers are apparent in many of the album's songs, such as "Baby Elián" as they comment on the strained relations between the United States and Cuba as seen in the [[Elián González]] affair, a hot topic around the album's release.&lt;ref name="The Scotsman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ianwatsonuk.com/manics.html|title=Nicky Wire (Manic Street Preachers)|accessdate= 29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band also pays tribute to singer and civil rights activist [[Paul Robeson]] in the song "[[Let Robeson Sing]]", but the song "[[Ocean Spray (song)|Ocean Spray]]", which was a single, was written entirely by James about his mother's battle with cancer. The first singles from the album, "[[So Why So Sad]]" and "[[Found That Soul]]", were both released on the same day. The final single "Let Robeson Sing" was released later. The Manics also headlined [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading and Leeds Festival]].

The greatest hits (plus remixes) album ''[[Forever Delayed]]'' was released in 2002, containing two new songs, "Door to the River" and the single "[[There by the Grace of God]]". Several songs were edited for length ("[[Motorcycle Emptiness]]," "[[You Love Us]]", "[[Australia (Manic Street Preachers song)|Australia]]," "[[Everything Must Go (song)|Everything Must Go]]," "[[Little Baby Nothing]]," and "[[The Everlasting (song)|The Everlasting]]") so that more tracks could fit onto the CD (though not listed as edits in the liner notes)."&lt;ref name="Manic Street Preachers"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Power|first1=Martin|title=Manic Street Preachers|date=17 October 2010|publisher=Omnibus Press|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Forever Delayed'' DVD was released in 2002 together with the greatest hits CD and photo book that bear the same name, and features all the promo music videos from the start of the band's career released prior to the DVD. Along with the promo videos there is a selection of 14 remix videos, where the visual material is taken from clips of the other promo videos as well as backdrop visuals from the band's live concerts.
The album peaked and debuted on the [[UK Albums Chart]] at #4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/archive-chart/_/3/2002-11-09/|title=Official album charts archive for 9th&amp;nbsp;November 2002|website=|accessdate=7 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615185004/http://www.theofficialcharts.com/archive-chart/_/3/2002-11-09/|archivedate=15 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An album of [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]], rarities and cover versions was released in 2003 entitled ''[[Lipstick Traces (A Secret History of Manic Street Preachers)]]'', which contains the last song the band worked on with Edwards. The album received a far more positive reception from fans than the ''[[Forever Delayed]]'' greatest hits album, which was heavily criticised for favouring the band's more commercially successful singles. The only recurring criticism of ''Lipstick Traces'' was the exclusion of the fan favourite "Patrick Bateman", from the "[[La Tristesse Durera (Scream to a Sigh)]]" single. The band explained that it was excluded mainly because it was almost seven minutes long and simply would not fit on the album."&lt;ref name="Manic Street Preachers"/&gt;

=== ''Lifeblood'' to ''Journal for Plague Lovers'' (2004–2009) ===
The band's seventh studio album, ''[[Lifeblood (album)|Lifeblood]]'', was released on 1 November 2004 and reached No.&amp;nbsp;13 on the UK album chart. Critical response to the album was mixed. The album was more introspective and more focused on the past, Wire talked about the ghosts that haunted this record and stated that the record was a retrospective: "The main themes are death and solitude and ghosts. Being haunted by history and being haunted by your own past. Sleep is beautiful for me. I hate dreaming because it ruins ten hours of bliss. I had a lot of bad dreams when Richey first disappeared. Not ugly dreams, but nagging things. Until we wrote '[[A Design for Life|Design for Life]]', it was six months of misery. ''Lifeblood'' doesn't seek to exorcise Edwards' ghost, though, just admits that there are no answers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Watson |first=Ian |date=October 2004 |title=Nicky Wire (Manic Street Preachers) |newspaper=[[The Scotsman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tony Visconti]] helped the band produce three songs on the album, which was followed by a UK arena tour in December 2004. "[[Empty Souls]]" and "[[The Love of Richard Nixon]]" were the two singles released from the album, both reaching No. 2 in the UK.&lt;ref name="UKchart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/manic%20street%20preachers/ |title=Manic Street Preachers – Official Single Charts |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |accessdate=1 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928212406/http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/manic%20street%20preachers |archivedate=28 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tenth-anniversary edition of ''[[The Holy Bible (album)|The Holy Bible]]'' was released on 6 December 2004, which included a digitally remastered version of the original album, a rare U.S. mix (which the band themselves have admitted to preferring to the original UK mix)&lt;ref name="DVD interview"/&gt; and a DVD of live performances and extras including a band interview.

In April 2005, the band played a number of shows as the Past-Present-Future tour—announced as their last for at least two years. The band released an EP entitled ''God Save the Manics'' with only a limited number of copies available and given out to fans as they arrived at the venue. After all the copies were gone, the band made the EP available as a free download on their website.&lt;ref name="Manic Street Preachers website"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manicstreetpreachers.com/global/news/global/2010/06/01/postcards_from_a_young_man |title=Manic Street Preachers website |website=manicstreetpreachers.com |accessdate=16 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306162225/http://www.manicstreetpreachers.com/global/news/global/2010/06/01/postcards_from_a_young_man |archivedate=6 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, the band contributed the new track "[[Leviathan (song)|Leviathan]]" to the [[War Child (charity)|War Child]] charity album ''[[Help!: A Day in the Life]]''.

In 2006 the band received the prize for the Q Merit Award in the [[Q Awards]] 2006 and also the 10th-anniversary edition of ″Everything Must Go″ was released on 6 November. It included the original album, demos, B-sides, remixes, rehearsals and alternate takes of the album's songs, spread out over two CDs. An additional DVD, featuring music videos, live performances, TV appearances, a 45-minute documentary on the making of the album, and two films by [[Patrick Jones]], completed the three-disc set."&lt;ref name="Manic Street Preachers"/&gt;

In the 10th-anniversary edition, the band itself claims that they're still fond of the record, and Wire goes further saying: "I think it's our best record, I am not afraid to say that."&lt;ref name="Manic Street Preachers"/&gt;

[[File:Manic Street Preachers in Brighton2004-4.jpg|thumb|300px|Manic Street Preachers live in Brighton in 2004]]
The band's eighth studio album, ''[[Send Away the Tigers]]'', was released on 7 May 2007 on [[Columbia Records]]. It entered the official UK album charts at No.&amp;nbsp;2. Critical response to the album was largely positive, with some critics hailing the album as the band's best in a decade. A free download of a song entitled "[[Underdogs (Manic Street Preachers song)|Underdogs]]" from the album was made available through the group's website on 19 March 2007."&lt;ref name="Manic Street Preachers"/&gt;

The first official single released from ''Send Away the Tigers'' was "[[Your Love Alone Is Not Enough]]", which features [[The Cardigans|Cardigans]] vocalist [[Nina Persson]] and according to the band they always had a [[duet]] in mind, seeing that the lyrics have a [[Call and response (music)|question/reply]] style to it. According to singer Bradfield the title was the last line of a suicide note left by the friend of someone close to the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.richeyedwards.net/14may09hotpress.html |title=All This Futile Beauty: Richey Edwards' Last Words |website=Articles.richeyedwards.net |date= |accessdate=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second single, "[[Autumnsong]]", and a third, "[[Indian Summer (Manic Street Preachers song)|Indian Summer]]", were released in August. ″Indian Summer″ peaked at number 22, making it the first Manics single not to chart in the Top 20 since 1994's [[She Is Suffering]]. The album sleeve features a quotation from [[Wyndham Lewis]]: "When a man is young, he is usually a revolutionary of some kind. So here I am, speaking of my revolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manics.nl/site/quotes/inartwork/whenamanisyoung.htm |title=When a man is young, he is usually a... @ |publisher=Manics.nl |date=12 July 2007 |accessdate=14 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229013711/http://www.manics.nl/site/quotes/inartwork/whenamanisyoung.htm |archivedate=29 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band ended up promoting the album with appearances in the summer festivals like [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]] and [[Glastonbury Festival]].

The band released a Christmas single, "[[The Ghosts of Christmas]]", in December. The track was available as a free download on their official website throughout December 2007 and January 2008. In February 2008, the band were presented with the God-Like Geniuses Award at the [[NME Awards]] ceremony.&lt;ref name="God-Like Genius"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manicstreetpreachers.com/godlikegenius/fans/ |title=God-Like Genius Award |website=Manic Street Preachers |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304093513/http://www.manicstreetpreachers.com/godlikegenius/fans/ |archivedate=4 March 2008 |accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ninth Manics album, ''[[Journal for Plague Lovers]]'', was released on 18 May 2009 and features lyrics left behind by Edwards. Wire commented in an interview that "there was a sense of responsibility to do his words justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idiomag.com/peek/73365/manic_street_preachers |title=Manic Street Preachers News: Manics Talk New Album |last=Murray |first=Robin |date=31 March 2009 |website=[[Idiomag]] |accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was released to positive critical reviews and reached No. 3 on the UK Album Chart. However, the cover of the album generated some controversy, with the top four UK [[supermarket]]s stocking the CD in a plain slipcase, as the cover was deemed "inappropriate".&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8050110.stm |title=BBC News Supermarkets Cover Up Manics CD |last1=Rogers |first1=Georgie |last2=O'Doherty |first2=Lucy |date=14 May 2009 |website=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradfield regarded the decision as "utterly bizarre", and has commented: "You can have lovely shiny buttocks and guns everywhere in the supermarket on covers of magazines and CDs, but you show a piece of art and people just freak out."&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

Several tracks refer to Edwards' time in a couple of hospitals in 1994. Among them is "She Bathed Herself in a Bath of Bleach", of which James Dean Bradfield said to the ''[[NME]]'': "There're some people he met when he was in one of the two places having treatment and I think he just digested other people's stories and experiences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=15619 |title=She Bathed Herself in a Bath of Bleach by Manic Street Preachers Songfacts |website=songfacts.com |accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final track, "William's Last Words", has been compared to a [[suicide note]], and although Nicky Wire rejects this suggestion,&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/08/manic-street-preachers |title=Interview: Manic Street Preachers|last=Petridis |first=Alexis |date=8 May 2009 |website=[[The Guardian|guardian.co.uk]] |accessdate=26 September 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradfield observes, "you can draw some pretty obvious conclusions from the lyrics."&lt;ref name="NME"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=10&amp;title=manic_street_preachers_interview_part_fo&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1 |title=Manic Street Preachers Interview Part Four – "This Record Is More Personal Than 'The Holy Bible'"|last=Mackay |first=Emily |date=18 May 2009 |website=[[NME|nme.com]] |accessdate=26 September 2012 | archiveurl=http://articles.richeyedwards.net/18may09nme.html | archivedate=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wire, who admitted finding the task of editing this song "pretty choking",&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; eventually composed the music and sang lead vocals after Bradfield found himself unsuited to the task.&lt;ref name="NME" /&gt;

Bradfield commented that ''Journal for Plague Lovers'' was an attempt to finally secure the legacy of their former member [[Richey Edwards]] and the result was that, during the recording process, it was as close to feeling his presence since his disappearance: "There was a sense of responsibility to do his words justice. That was part of the whole thing of letting enough time lapse. Once we actually got into the studio, it almost felt as if we were a full band; it [was] as close to him being in the room again as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idiomag.com/peek/73365/manic_street_preachers |title=Manic Street Preachers News: Manics Talk New Album |last=Murray |first=Robin |date=31 March 2009 |website=[[Idiomag]] |accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracks from ''Journal for Plague Lovers'' have been remixed by a number of artists, and the ''Journal for Plague Lovers Remixes'' EP was released on 15 June 2009. [[Noble (musician)|Martin Noble]] of the band [[British Sea Power]] remixed the song "Me and Stephen Hawking";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/manic-street-preachers/44109 |title=British Sea Power Remixing Manic Street Preachers|date=17 April 2009 |website=[[NME]] |accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Weatherall]] remixed "[[Peeled Apples]]", which he has described as "sounding like [[Charlie Watts]] playing with [[Public Image Ltd|PiL]]"; [[The Horrors]] remixed "Doors Closing Slowly";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/01583-new-testament-manic-street-preachers-interviewed-about-journal-for-plague-lovers-richey-edwards-and-the-holy-bible |title=The Quietus New Testament: Manic Street Preachers on ''Journal for Plague Lovers'' |last=Doran |first=John |date=30 April 2009 |website=[[The Quietus]] |accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NYPC]] remixed the song "Marlon J.D" and the EP also features remixes by [[Patrick Wolf]], [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]], [[Four Tet]], [[Errors (band)|Errors]], [[Adem Ilhan|Adem]], [[Optimo]] and [[Fuck Buttons]].

On 18 June 2009 the Manics officially opened the new [[Cardiff Central Library]]. Wire later said in an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'' that the occasion had been a great honour for the band:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/07/nicky-wires-library-closures-manics |title=Music Blog:'If You Tolerate This ...': Nicky Wire on Library Closures |date=7 February 2011 |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Postcards from a Young Man'' and ''National Treasures'' (2010–2012) ===
On 1 June 2010, the band announced on their homepage that a new album called ''[[Postcards from a Young Man]]'' would be released on 20 September. James Dean Bradfield said that the album would be an unashamedly pop-orientated affair, following 2009's ''Journal for Plague Lovers''. "We're going for big radio hits on this one", he told ''NME''. "It isn't a follow-up to ''Journal for Plague Lovers''. It's one last shot at mass communication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/manic-street-preachers/51309/photo/2 |title=Manic Street Preachers Announce UK Tour and New Album details|date=1 June 2010 |website=[[NME]] |accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 July, the first single from the new album, "[[(It's Not War) Just the End of Love]]", was played on the breakfast shows of BBC Radio 2,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/music/playlist/ BBC Radio 2 Playlist: Week Commencing: 28 Aug 2010]", [[BBC]], retrieved 2010-08-31 {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5x0Ukzwmu?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/music/playlist/ |date=7 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; BBC 6Music, XFm and Absolute Radio.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.xfm.co.uk/onair/playlist XFM Playlist]", retrieved 2010-08-31 {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5k18LDGTp?url=http://www.xfm.co.uk/onair/playlist |date=24 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released on 13 September. The title had previously been suggested as a working title for the album by Nicky Wire. Three collaborations were also confirmed on the band's website later that day: [[Duff McKagan]] would appear on "A Billion Balconies Facing the Sun", [[Ian McCulloch (singer)|Ian McCulloch]] will add guest vocals to "Some Kind of Nothingness" and [[John Cale]] will feature on "Auto-Intoxication". Of the album's lead single, "[[(It's Not War) Just the End of Love]]," Nicky Wire claimed: "I believe in the tactile nature of rock 'n' roll. There's a generation missing out on what music meant to us...You can only elaborate on the stuff that compels you to. But "It's Not War..." is kind of saying, "Alright, we're not 18, but even at 40 the rage is still there".&lt;ref name="DUFF"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a223960/ex-gnr-bassist-features-on-new-manics-lp.html?rss |title=Ex-GN'R bassist features on new Manics LP |last=Nissim |first=Mayer |date=7 June 2010 |website=[[Digital Spy]] |accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Postcards from a Young Man'' was recorded with producer (and longtime Manics collaborator) [[Dave Eringa]] and was mixed in America by [[Chris Lord-Alge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/leisure/latest/8202090.Preview__Manic_Street_Preachers_in_Blackburn/ |title=Preview: Manic Street Preachers in Blackburn |author= |date=4 June 2010 |website= |publisher=Lancashire Telegraph |accessdate=14 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qV9sHBys?url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/leisure/latest/8202090.Preview__Manic_Street_Preachers_in_Blackburn/ |archivedate=15 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released in a standard version, 2 CD deluxe version, and limited edition box set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.play.com/Music/CD/4-/15416916/Manic-Street-Preachers-Postcards-From-A-Young-Man/Product.html |title=Postcards From A Young Man (Deluxe Edition) |author= |date= |website= |publisher=Play.com |accessdate=14 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qVAQsvIa?url=http://www.play.com/Music/CD/4-/15416916/Manic-Street-Preachers-Postcards-From-A-Young-Man/Product.html |archivedate=15 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The album cover art uses a black and white photograph of British actor [[Tim Roth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indie-rock.it/news_look.php?id=5170 |title=Nuovo dei Manics a settembre |author= |date=6 June 2010 |website= |publisher=Indie-Rock |accessdate=14 June 2010 |language=Italian |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qV9sUGe1?url=http://www.indie-rock.it/news_look.php?id=5170 |archivedate=15 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album was supported by the Manics' most extensive tour of the UK to date,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manicstreetpreachers.com/global/news/global/2010/06/01/postcards_from_a_young_man |title=Postcards From A Young Man |website=manicstreetpreachers.com |accessdate=16 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306162225/http://www.manicstreetpreachers.com/global/news/global/2010/06/01/postcards_from_a_young_man |archivedate=6 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; starting in Glasgow on 29 September 2010. [[British Sea Power]] were the support act for the band on the tour. Two further singles were released from the album—the McCulloch-featuring "[[Some Kind of Nothingness]]" and the title track "[[Postcards from a Young Man (song)|Postcards from a Young Man]]". "Some Kind of Nothingness" peaked at No. 44 in the UK making it the first ever Manics single to not make the Top 40 since they signed to Sony in 1991.

The band initially announced that their next album had the [[working title]] ''70 Songs of Hatred and Failure'' and would sound very different from ''Postcards From A Young Man'': "The next album will be pure indulgence. There's only so much melody stored in your body that you can physically get onto one record.

''[[National Treasures – The Complete Singles]]'' was released on 31 October 2011, preceded by the release of the single "[[This Is the Day (song)|This Is the Day]]", a cover of the song by [[The The]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/manic-street-preachers/58269 |title=Manic Street Preachers to Celebrate 21st Anniversary with Singles Collection|date=26 July 2011 |website=[[NME]] |accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 December 2011, the group performed 'A Night of National Treasures' at [[The O2 Arena (London)|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Arena]] in London to celebrate the band's 25 years to date, and enter into a period of hiatus where the eleventh album was written. The band performed all 38 singles, with around 20,000 people in attendance, as well as guest performers including [[Nina Persson]] from [[the Cardigans]] who sings with the band on the single "[[Your Love Alone Is Not Enough]]" and [[Gruff Rhys]] from [[Super Furry Animals]] who sang with the band that night on the track [[Let Robeson Sing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manicstreetpreachers.com/global/news/global/2011/08/30/once_in_a_lifetime_christmas_party_at_o2_arena_london_17th_december?headlines-page=3 |title=Once In A Lifetime Christmas Party At O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Arena London 17th December |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403135430/http://www.manicstreetpreachers.com/global/news/global/2011/08/30/once_in_a_lifetime_christmas_party_at_o2_arena_london_17th_december?headlines-page=3 |archivedate=3 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April and May 2012, the band embarked on a European greatest hits tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.manicstreetpreachers.com/global/news/global/2012/02/01/european_tour_dates_announced?headlines-page=4 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130721101522/http://archive.manicstreetpreachers.com/global/news/global/2012/02/01/european_tour_dates_announced?headlines-page=4 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 July 2013 |title=Manic Street Preachers / Official News (Global) / Send Away the Lions Part 2 |website=Manic Street Preachers |accessdate=21 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The compilation was voted by ''[[NME]]'' magazine as the best re issue of 2011, beating [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s deluxe and super deluxe edition of ''[[Nevermind]]'' to the top spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/2011.htm|title=NME Albums of 2011|website=Rocklistmusic.com|accessdate=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the "complete singles" title, ''National Treasures'' does not contain every Manic Street Preachers single. Notable omissions are the band's very first single, "[[Suicide Alley]]" (1989), "Strip It Down" from the ''[[New Art Riot]]'' EP (1990), for which the band's first promotional video was made,&lt;ref&gt;S. Price, Everything (A Book about Manic Street Preachers), Virgin Books, 1999, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[You Love Us (Heavenly Version)]]" (1991). For singles originally released as double-A sides, only one song is included: therefore from "[[Love's Sweet Exile/Repeat]]" (1992) and "[[Faster/P.C.P.]]" (1994), only the first of each pair are included."&lt;ref name="Manic Street Preachers"/&gt;

On 10 October the band announced via [[Facebook]] that a film-interview-documentary about their album ''Generation Terrorists'' would be screened at 2012's {{lang|cy|Sŵn}} Festival as a Welsh exclusive. The film was shown at Chapter Arts Centre on Saturday 20 October, with all profits being donated to Young Promoters Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.manicstreetpreachers.com/global/news/global/2012/10/10/manic_street_preachers_film_to_be_screened_at_swn_festival?headlines-page=3 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130721101505/http://archive.manicstreetpreachers.com/global/news/global/2012/10/10/manic_street_preachers_film_to_be_screened_at_swn_festival?headlines-page=3 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 July 2013 |title=Manic Street Preachers / Official News (Global) / Manic Street Preachers Film to Be Screened at Sŵn Festival 2012 |date=10 October 2012 |website=Manic Street Preachers |accessdate=21 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was made available in the 20th anniversary re-issue of ''Generation Terrorists'', of which there were five editions:

In May 2013, the band announced an Australasian tour for June and July, that would see them play their first ever show in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Manic-Street-Preachers-announce-Auckland-show/tabid/418/articleID/296263/Default.aspx|website=3 News NZ |title= Manics announce Auckland show| date=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tour coincided with the British and Irish Lions rugby tour to Australia and the Melbourne concert on the eve of the 2nd Test featured Lions' centre Jamie Roberts as a guest guitarist on "You Love Us".

In May 2013 the Manics released information about their most recent recording sessions, saying that they had enough material for two albums; the first would be almost exclusively without electric guitars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/20/manic-street-preachers-new-albums|website=Guardian.co.uk |title =Manic Street Preachers set to release two new albums| date=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the first album and title track was revealed to be ''[[Rewind the Film]]'' on 8 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/20/manic-street-preachers-new-albums |title=Manic Street Preachers Set to Release Two New Albums|last=Martin |first=Dan |date=20 May 2013 |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement, the band announced, "(If) this record has a relation in the Manics back catalogue, it's probably the sedate coming of age that was ''[[This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours]].''"&lt;ref name="walesonline.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/music/manic-street-preachers-reveal-details-4881786 | work=WalesOnline | title=Manic Street Preachers reveal details of new album Rewind The Film and a UK tour}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band also stated via [[Twitter]], "MSP were in the great Hansa Studios in January with Alex Silva (who recorded ''[[The Holy Bible (album)|The Holy Bible]]'' with us).

The other album, ''[[Futurology (album)|Futurology]]'', the band's twelfth studio album, was released on 7 July 2014 and it received immediate critical acclaim. The lead single from the album, "[[Walk Me to the Bridge]]", was released as a digital download on the day of the announcement, on 28 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nissim |first=Mayer|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a558379/manic-street-preachers-reveal-futurology-walk-me-to-the-bridge-video.html#~oCIocbIDNYJcra |title=Manic Street Preachers reveal Futurology, 'Walk Me to the Bridge' video |publisher=DigitalSpy |date=2014-04-28 |accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Futurology'', according to the band, is an album full of ideas and one of their most optimistic yet, as Wire said to the ''[[NME]]'' magazine in an interview: "There's an overriding concept behind 'Futurology' which is to express all the inspiration we get from travel, music and art—all those ideas, do that in a positive way. 'Rewind The Film' was a harrowing 45-year-old looking in the mirror, lyrically. 'Futurology' was very much an album of ideas. It's one of our most optimistic records, the idea that any kind of art can transport you to a different universe." &lt;ref name="NME3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/manic-street-preachers/78469|title=Manic Street Preachers' Nicky Wire: ''Futurology'' is one of our most optimistic records' |publisher=[[NME]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album sold about 20,000 copies in its first week and reached No. 2 on the [[UK Album Chart]]. The title track, [[Futurology (song)|Futurology]], was the second and final single released from the album on 22 September, the video debuted on [[YouTube]] on 10 August.

In February 2017 the band revealed a teaser trailer for a new documentary entitled ''Escape from History'', charting the band's journey from ''The Holy Bible'', through to the disappearance of lyricist and guitarist Richey Edwards, to the huge success of ''Everything Must Go''. The documentary aired on [[Sky Arts]] on 15 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wearesonylegacy.com/news/manic-street-preachers-escape-history |title=Manic Street Preachers: Escape From History - Sony Legacy We Are Sony Legacy |website=Wearesonylegacy.com |date=2017-04-10 |accessdate=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band also stated that they would release a new album later in that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/see-teaser-trailer-new-manic-street-preachers-film-escape-history-1973627 |title=See teaser trailer for new Manic Street Preachers film 'Escape from History' |publisher=''[[NME]]'' |date=2017-02-13 |accessdate=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band released a special edition of their album ''[[Send Away the Tigers]]'' on 12 May. 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the record and the Manics said that "this is a very important album" in their career. The special edition featured a remastered album as well as [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] and rarities spread over two discs, plus a DVD which features the band's 2007 Glastonbury performance, rehearsal footage, an album track-by-track, and promo videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/21998-manic-street-preachers-send-away-the-tigers|title=Manics To Reissue Send Away the Tigers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 November 2017, the band announced that their thirteenth album, ''[[Resistance Is Futile (album)|Resistance Is Futile]]'', would be released on 13 April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Manics/status/931446855854063616|title=ManicStreetPreachers on Twitter|website=Twitter|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After much delay, the band wrote "The main themes of ‘Resistance is Futile’ are memory and loss; forgotten history; confused reality and art as a hiding place and inspiration,” the band say in a statement. “It’s obsessively melodic—in many ways referencing both the naive energy of ‘Generation Terrorists’ and the orchestral sweep of ‘Everything Must Go’. After delay and difficulties getting started, the record has come together really quickly over the last few months through a surge of creativity and some old school hard work." It is the first album to be recorded at the "Door to The River" new studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diymag.com/2017/11/17/manic-street-preachers-announce-new-album-resistance-is-futile|title=MANIC STREET PREACHERS ANNOUNCE NEW ALBUM ‘RESISTANCE IS FUTILE’}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, Manic Street Preachers signed a new publishing contract with [[Warner/Chappell Music]], leaving their longtime home [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweek.com/publishing/read/hot-wire-warner-chappell-sign-manic-street-preachers/071266|title=Hot wire: Warner/Chappell sign Manic Street Preachers  - Publishing - Music Week|website=Musicweek.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the album focused on "(...)things that make your life feel a little bit better. Rather than my internalised misery, I tried to put a sense of optimism into the lyrics by writing about things that we find really inspiring." Said Wire, taking inspiration from [[David Bowie]] and seen as almost an escape and a wave of optimism, just like the previoous album was described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/manic-street-preachers-tell-us-new-single-international-blue-sister-song-motorcycle-emptiness-2169503|title=Manics: ‘New single ‘International Blue’ is the new ‘Motorcycle Emptiness|website=Nme.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, "Distant Colours" was written by James Dean Bradfield, rather than Nicky Wire, and inspired by disenchantment and Nye Bevan's old Labour. He said: "Musically, the verse is downcast and melancholic and the chorus is an explosion of disillusionment and tears."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/24048-manic-street-preachers-distant-colours|title=LISTEN: New Manic Street Preachers|website=Thequietus.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third single "[[Dylan &amp; Caitlin]]" was released as a download on 9 March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/manic-street-preachers-release-emotional-new-single-dylan-caitlin-2258854|title= Manic Street Preachers release emotional new single ‘Dylan &amp; Caitlin|website=Nme.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth single "[[Liverpool Revisited]]" is about a magical day in the city, Nicky added that: "It was on the Everything Must Go (anniversary) tour and I got up really early at sunrise to walk around Liverpool, polaroid camera in hand on a balmy day. It sounds clichéd I know, but Liverpool in the sun does take on a hypnotic quality, with the Mersey and the stone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4151681-people-can-tell-if-you-don-t-mean-it---dis-meets-manic-street-preachers|title= People Can Tell It If You Don't Mean It|website=Drownedinsound.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band also revealed that they were to support [[Guns N' Roses]] during their summer tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/manic-street-preachers-guns-n-roses-european-tour-2261146|title=Manic Street Preachers to support Guns N’ Roses on European tour|website=Nme.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth and final single, "[[Hold Me Like a Heaven]]", was released as a download on 4 May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.readdork.com/news/manic-street-preachers-have-debuted-a-video-for-hold-me-like-a-heaven/|title=Manic Street Preachers have debuted a video for ‘Hold Me Like A Heaven’|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wire said that the song was inspired musically by [[David Bowie]]‘s [[Ashes to Ashes (David Bowie song)|Ashes to Ashes]], something that the band wanted to write about, and Nicky thinks that this the closest that the band is going to get, sharing also that lyrics were informed by the work of [[Philip Larkin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/manic-street-preachers-share-striking-video-for-new-single-hold-me-like-a-heaven|title= Manic Street Preachers share striking video for new single Hold Me Like A Heaven|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album sold around 24,000 copies in the first week, entering the [[UK Albums Chart]] at number 2,&lt;ref name= ukalbums&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/albums-chart/|title= Official Albums Chart Top 100|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite being number 1 during the week,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clashmusic.com/news/could-manic-street-preachers-grab-number-one|title=Could Manic Street Preachers Grab Number One?|accessdate= 21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was the highest new entry on the chart. However, on physical sales the album peaked at number 1, both on [[Compact disc|CD]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/record-store-chart/|title=Official Record Store Chart Top 40|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Phonograph record|vinyl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/vinyl-albums-chart/|title= Official Vinyl Albums Chart Top 40 |accessdate= 21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Solo work ==
In late 2005, both Bradfield and Wire announced that they intended to release solo material prior to a new album by the band.&lt;ref name="Manic Street Preachers"/&gt; A free download of Nicky Wire's debut solo offering ''[[I Killed the Zeitgeist]]'' was posted on the band's website for just one day, Christmas Day 2005,&lt;ref name="Manic Street Preachers website"/&gt; while "The Shining Path" was released exclusively on [[iTunes]] for download. In addition, a promotional album sampler had been sent out to the press and certain other people which included "I Killed the Zeitgeist", "Goodbye Suicide", "Sehnsucht", and "Everything Fades".

The album was officially released in September 2006. It charted at No.&amp;nbsp;130 in the UK. The sound of the album, which Nicky referred to as his "nihilistic anti-everything album", was inspired by, among others, [[Neu!]], the [[Plastic Ono Band]], [[Einstürzende Neubauten]], [[the Modern Lovers]], [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]] and [[Lou Reed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nickyssecretsociety.com/ss/lists.php |title=Nicky Wire– Official Site |website=nickyssecretsociety.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114115959/http://www.nickyssecretsociety.com/ss/lists.php |archivedate=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only one official single was released, "[[I Killed the Zeitgeist|Break My Heart Slowly]]", which charted at No.&amp;nbsp;74. Nicky toured small intimate venues across the UK with his band the Secret Society.&lt;ref name="Manic Street Preachers"/&gt;

Bradfield's solo album, ''[[The Great Western]]'', was released in July 2006, to positive reviews from critics.&lt;ref name="AllMusic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-great-western-mw0000546944 |title=''The Great Western'' – James Dean Bradfield : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards : AllMusic |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |website=[[Allmusic|AllMusic]] |accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reached No.&amp;nbsp;22 in the UK. The sound of the album was inspired by, among others, [[Jeff Beck]], [[Badfinger]], [[Simple Minds]] and [[McCarthy (band)|McCarthy]]. Two singles were released: "[[That's No Way to Tell a Lie]]" (No.&amp;nbsp;18) in July, which was also the background music to the [[BBC]]'s [[Match of the Day]]'s '[[BBC Goal of the Month|Goal of the Month]]' competition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/match_of_the_day/4797885.stm | title=Ask us about: Music details | publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | accessdate=2007-06-14 | author=BBC Staff | date=2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then "[[An English Gentleman]]" (No.&amp;nbsp;31) in September. The latter is in remembrance of the first Manics manager Philip Hall, who died from cancer in 1993&lt;ref name=quiet/&gt; and to whom ''The Holy Bible'' had been dedicated. The initial pressings of the red 7" single were actually made with black vinyl, some of which were sent out to distributors by mistake. James toured the album with a band that included Wayne Murray, who would subsequently play second guitar for Manics live performances. James's solo gigs featured covers of [[the Clash]] songs "[[Clampdown]]" and "The Card Cheat", both from the album ''[[London Calling]]''.

In a later interview, when the band were collectively asked what they had learned from making a solo album, Sean Moore dryly quipped "Not to do one".&lt;ref name="Manic Street Preachers"/&gt;

== Collaborations and covers ==
[[File:Manicstreetpreachersatbrixton.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Manic Street Preachers performing live in Brixton O2 Academy, 2014]]

The band released a split single in 1992 with [[the Fatima Mansions]], a rock cover of "[[Suicide Is Painless]]", which became their first UK Top 10 hit.&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt; They have recorded many cover versions of songs by other artists, primarily as [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] for their own singles. Bands to whom the group have paid tribute in this way include [[the Clash]], [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Happy Mondays]], [[McCarthy (band)|McCarthy]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[Faces (band)|Faces]] and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]].&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt;

The band's first musical appearance since Edwards' departure was recording a cover of "[[Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head]]" for ''[[The Help Album]]'', a charity effort in 1995 in support of aid efforts in war-torn [[Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]].&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt;

[[The Lightning Seeds]]' song "Waiting for Today to Happen", from their fifth album, ''[[Dizzy Heights]]'' (1996), was written by Nicky Wire and [[Ian Broudie]]. That same year, James Dean Bradfield and [[Dave Eringa]] produced [[Northern Uproar]]'s first single, "[[Rollercoaster/Rough Boys]]". The [[808 State]] song "Lopez" (1997) features lyrics by Wire and vocals by Bradfield.&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt; It is featured on their greatest hits album, ''[[808:88:98]]''. [[Kylie Minogue]]'s sixth album, ''[[Impossible Princess]]'' (1997), features two songs co-written and produced by the Manics: "[[Some Kind of Bliss]]" (Bradfield, Minogue and Sean Moore) and "I Don't Need Anyone" (Bradfield, Jones and Minogue) were produced by Bradfield and Dave Eringa.&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt; Bradfield provided backing vocals, bass guitar and production for the [[Massive Attack]] song "[[Inertia Creeps]]" (1998), which features on their successful third album, ''[[Mezzanine (album)|Mezzanine]]''.&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt; [[Patrick Jones]]'s album of poetry set to music, ''[[Patrick Jones#Commemoration and Amnesia|Commemoration and Amnesia]]'' (1999), features two songs with music written by Bradfield: the title track and "The Guerilla Tapestry". Bradfield plays guitar on both songs. Furthermore, the track "Hiraeth" features a section called "Spoken Word", in which Nicky Wire talks about Welsh identity.&lt;ref name="Manic Street Preachers"/&gt;

In February 2006, the band contributed a cover version of "The Instrumental" to the album ''[[Still Unravished|Still Unravished: A Tribute to the June Brides]]''.&lt;ref name="Manic Street Preachers"/&gt;

In February 2008, the Manics covered [[Rihanna]]'s hit pop song "[[Umbrella (song)|Umbrella]]". Their version appeared on a CD titled ''[[NME Awards 2008 (album)|NME Awards 2008]]'' given away free with a special souvenir box-set issue of ''[[NME]]'' magazine, which went on sale 27 February. Additionally, the Manics' version of the song was made available on [[iTunes]] from 5 March 2008.&lt;ref name="God-Like Genius"/&gt; Despite being chart-eligible (it reached number 47 in the UK),&lt;ref name="UK charts"/&gt; the release was not intended as an official single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manicstreetpreachers.com/07/blogs/diary/2008/03/27/nicks_blog_march |title=Manic Street Preachers |website=Manic Street Preachers |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401121258/http://www.manicstreetpreachers.com/07/blogs/diary/2008/03/27/nicks_blog_march |archivedate=1 April 2008 |accessdate=21 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two further versions (the Acoustic and Grand Slam mixes) were later made available on iTunes and now comprise a three-track ''Umbrella EP''.

James Dean Bradfield and Nicky Wire contributed an original song, "The Girl from Tiger Bay", to [[Shirley Bassey]]'s 2009 studio album, ''[[The Performance]]''."&lt;ref name="Manic Street Preachers"/&gt;

The festival invites international and local experts from the fields of creative industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://festival.mikser.rs/en/about-mikser-house/ |title=About Mikser House - Mikser Festival 2017 |publisher=Festival.mikser.rs |date= |accessdate=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to lectures, competitions, and workshops, there are exhibits, concerts, films and theater plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://festival.mikser.rs/en/complete-programme/ |title=Complete Programme - Mikser Festival 2017 |publisher=Festival.mikser.rs |date= |accessdate=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==About==
The festival occurs once a year in [[Belgrade]] at the end of May or the beginning of June, and usually lasts about 4 to 7 days. The first show was held at the "Žitomlina" silo in the [[Dorćol]] area of [[Belgrade]].&lt;ref name="blic.rs"/&gt; Since then, the festival regularly took place in the once derelict industrial zone of [[Savamala]],  helping revitalize the [[Belgrade]] neighborhood, before returning to [[Dorćol]] in 2017.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=VL-aDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132&amp;lpg=PA132&amp;dq=mikser+festival+2008&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fn_ZVJNUv8&amp;sig=r4OCin_0-nn7HSYuCEeZtKlzdq0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV26nN06PbAhWrq1kKHXrXA9Q4ChDoAQgoMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mikser+festival+2008&amp;f=false|title=The Impact of Artists on Contemporary Urban Development in Europe|first1=Monika|last1=Murzyn-Kupisz|first2=Jarosław|last2=Działek|date=4 April 2017|publisher=Springer|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2010, the festival attracted 40,000 visitors and in 2017, the numbers had risen to 75,000.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 

The Misker Festival is part of the Mikser umbrella organization, which includes the Mikser House, a gallery and cultural space located in the [[Savamala]] neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/17/world/europe/hip-belgrade-resilient-capital/index.html|title=Hip Belgrade: Resilient capital finds new energy to rebuild once again|first=Paula Newton,|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The umbrella group also comprises the reMiks Studio, Mikser TV, the Mikser Organization, the Miksalište Refugee Center, the Mikser Café and the Balkan Design store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scen.uns.ac.rs/?p=20460|title=SCENLAB RAZGOVORI / SEZONA 5: ŠTA RADIM I ŠTA MI SE DOGAĐA, Maja Vidaković Lalić, arhitekta i kreativni direktor – SCEN|website=www.scen.uns.ac.rs}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Mikser Festival also sometimes coordinates with other events. In 2006, it's Ghost Project exhibit was shown at [[Belgrade Design Week]]. A multimedia installation, Ghost Project first focused on local unrealized projects in industrial design and since 2011 has evolved into a competition for international designers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designaustria.at/posts/3078-mikser-festival-international-design-competition-ghost-project-2017|title=Mikser Festival: International Design Competition »Ghost Project 2017« - designaustria|website=www.designaustria.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mikser-remiks.blogspot.com/search/label/Ghost%2Bproject|title=Mikser|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://festival.mikser.rs/en/project/ghost-project-2017-new-nomads/ |title=Exhibition: Ghost Project 2017 - The new nomads - Mikser Festival 2017 |publisher=Festival.mikser.rs |date= |accessdate=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://inhabitat.com/designcompetitions/ghost-project-international-design-competition-2011/|title=Ghost Project International Design Competition 2011 - Design Competitions|website=inhabitat.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Highlights==
The main theme of the 2011 festival was the promotion of workshops, new technologies, and experimentation, as well as commemorating the 20 year anniversary of the break-up of [[Yugoslavia]]. Musicians who had been popular before the break-up were invited to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/festival/1929925+Mikser+festival+2011|title=Mikser festival 2011 at Žitomlin magacini (Beograd) on 25 May 2011  - Last.fm|website=Last.fm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greg Wilson (DJ)|Greg Wilson]], [[John Tejada]], JD Twitch and JG Wilkes, from the British club scene, also made appearances.

Austrian choreographer William Dorner performed a dance recital with the goal of inspiring local residents to protect their city.&lt;ref name="mojasrbija.rs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mojasrbija.rs/wp/mikser-festival-2014/|title=Mikser festival 2014 - Moja Srbija|date=4 June 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three Swiss artists exhibited a multimedia installation featuring video footage of [[Savamala]] and other urban neighborhoods. A conference and workshops were also held with Dutch designer Renne Ramakers and British architect [[Jeremy Till]] in attendance.&lt;ref name="mojasrbija.rs"/&gt;

The 2017 festival concentrated on the themes of migration, education on the move, the city, and the making of culture. The topics were addressed through design, the visual arts, cinema and music, as well as the lecture series "Mikser Talks".

The '''''Mond Crucifixion''''' (or '''''Crocifissione Gavari'''''; both names are after former owners) is a [[painting]] by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[renaissance]] artist [[Raphael]].

An early work influenced by [[Perugino]], it was originally an [[altarpiece]] in the church of [[San Domenico, Città di Castello]], near Raphael's hometown of [[Urbino]]. The painting shows [[Jesus]] on the cross, who is looking peaceful even though he is dying. There are two angels catching his blood in chalices. On Jesus' left kneels [[Mary Magdalene]], with [[John the Evangelist]] standing behind her. On his right [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] stands, and [[Jerome|St. Jerome]], to whom the altar was dedicated, is kneeling. At the foot of the cross is the inscription &lt;small&gt;RAPHAEL/ VRBIN / AS /.P.[INXIT]&lt;/small&gt; ("Raphael of Urbino painted this") in silver letters.

The painting was bequeathed to the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] by [[Ludwig Mond]].

The sun and moon at the top are present despite the [[First Council of Constantinople|Council of Constantinople]] prohibition of such symbology for its reference to other religions.{{dubious|date=July 2017}}

==Painting materials==
The painting was analyzed in the National Gallery London&lt;ref&gt;Roy, A., Spring, M., Plazzotta, C. ‘Raphael’s Early Work in the National Gallery: Paintings before Rome‘. National Gallery Technical Bulletin Vol 25, pp 4–35.&lt;/ref&gt; and the typical [[pigments]] of the [[Renaissance]] period were identified. He painted the Crucifixion among other pigments with natural [[ultramarine]], [[lead-tin-yellow]], [[verdigris]], [[vermilion]] and [[ochres]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://colourlex.com/project/raphael-moon-crucifixion/ Raphael, The Mond Crucifixion], ColourLex&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mortality''''' is a 2012, posthumously published book by Anglo-American writer [[Christopher Hitchens]], comprising seven essays which first appeared in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' concerning his struggle with oesophageal cancer, with which he was diagnosed during his 2010 book tour&lt;ref&gt;Bowcott, Owen (1 July 2010) [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/01/aurtho-christopher-hitchens-diagnosed-cancer "Author Christopher Hitchens diagnosed with cancer"] from ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and which killed him in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, William (16 December 2011) [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/16/arts/christopher-hitchens-is-dead-at-62-obituary.html?_r=0 "Christopher Hitchens, Polemicist Who Slashed All, Freely, Dies at 62"] in ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; An eighth chapter consisting of unfinished "fragmentary jottings," a foreword by [[Graydon Carter]], Hitchens' ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' editor and an afterword by Carol Blue, Hitchens' widow, are also included in the publication.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, Christopher (30 August 2012) [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/02/books/review/mortality-by-christopher-hitchens.html?pagewanted=all "Review of ''Mortality'': Staying Power"] in ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

Hitchens held the post of contributing editor at ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' from November 1992 until his death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Hitchens]] contributor page at [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|''Vanity Fair'']]: http://www.vanityfair.com/contributors/christopher-hitchens&lt;/ref&gt; In this capacity he contributed about 10 essays per year on subjects as diverse as politics and the limits of self-improvement, writing about "anything except sports".&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens, Christopher (2012). Mortality. Atlantic Books Ltd., p.103 {{ISBN|978-1-4555-0275-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, he felt obliged when he was asked to write about his illness for the magazine, and managed to dispatch seven essays from "Tumourville" before he was overcome by his illness on 15 December 2011, aged 62.&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, William (16 December 2011) [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/16/arts/christopher-hitchens-is-dead-at-62-obituary.html?_r=0 "Christopher Hitchens, Polemicist Who Slashed All, Freely, Dies at 62"] in ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The essays take as their subject matter his fear of losing the ability to write, the torture of chemotherapy, an analysis of [[Nietzsche]]'s proclamation that "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger," the joy of conversation and the very meaning of life.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens, Christopher (2012). Mortality. Atlantic Books Ltd. {{ISBN|978-1-4555-0275-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==
The critical response to ''Mortality'' was largely positive with friends and admirers of Hitchens praising both his character in confronting his death and the way that this was transferred onto the page. In a glowing review of ''Mortality'' in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Christopher Buckley (novelist)|Christopher Buckley]] described Hitchens' seven essays as "diamond-hard and brilliant" and "word-perfect." He wrote that it was "sobering and grief-inducing to read this brave and harrowing account of his "year of living dyingly" in the grip of the alien that succeeded where none of his debate opponents had in bringing him down." Buckley was a friend of Hitchens.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, Christopher (30 August 2012) [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/02/books/review/mortality-by-christopher-hitchens.html?pagewanted=all "Review of ''Mortality'': Staying Power"] in ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colm Tóibín]] fondly wrote in ''[[The Guardian]] ''of his experiences with Hitchens, opining that "he was the best company in the world" and offered praise for ''Mortality'', writing that "in this book he does everything to make sure that his voice remains civilised, searching and ready to vanquish all his enemies, most notably in this case the dullness of death and its silence."&lt;ref&gt;Tóibín, Colm (31 August 2012) [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/31/mortality-christopher-hitchens-review "''Mortality'' by Christopher Hitchens – review"]'' ''in ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Observer]] ''[[Alexander Linklater]] was also complimentary. Referring to [[John N. Gray|John Gray's]] description of Hitchens as "one of the greatest living writers of English prose",&lt;ref&gt;Gray, John (6 October 2011) [http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2011/09/hitchens-trotsky-convictions "Review: ''Arguably'' by Christopher Hitchens"]'' ''in ''[[New Statesman|The New Statesman]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Linklater responded that "the only word of that which is certainly untrue is that Hitchens is now no longer living." He also noted: "The real struggle in ''Mortality'' is not with mortality. Hitchens cleaves to the logical conclusion of his materialism. He hints, rather, at a fear of losing himself, of becoming an imbecile, someone who might, in terror and pain, say something foolish or (God forbid) religious near the end, to give his enemies satisfaction. The true struggle of his last writings is to remain himself, deep in the country of the ill, for as long as he can."&lt;ref&gt;Linklater, Alexander (26 August 2012) [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/26/mortality-christopher-hitchens-review "''Mortality'' by Christopher Hitchens – review"] in ''[[The Observer]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Another positive review came from the magazine where Hitchens started his career, ''The New Statesman''. George Eaton wrote that Hitchens' final work had "a timeless, aphoristic quality".&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, George (7 September 2012) [http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/culture/2012/09/mortality-christopher-hitchens-–-review "''Mortality'' by Christopher Hitchens – review"] in ''[[New Statesman|The New Statesman]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2978">'''"Not A Cornfield"''' was a 2005 art project that transformed a {{convert|32|acre|m2|sing=on}} industrial [[Brownfield land|brownfield]] (today part of [[Los Angeles State Historic Park]] in the historic center of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]) into a [[Maize|cornfield]] for one agricultural cycle.  The project took place north of [[Chinatown, Los Angeles, California|Chinatown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{"'}}Not a Cornfield' Idea Is Food for Thought; It's fresh, but is it art?" (12 Sep 2005) ''Los Angeles Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

Lauren Bon created this work with funds from the [[Annenberg Foundation]] and considered the piece to be a [[sculpture]].  The installation cost $3 million and took place at the proposed site of Los Angeles State Historic Park, which had been referred to as "The Cornfield", because of the crops growing there prior to its industrial development.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;"L.A. THEN AND NOW; Pasadena's Gold Line Will Travel a History-Laden Route" (13 July 2008) ''Los Angeles Times''&lt;/ref&gt;  Fifteen hundred truck loads of [[soil]] were transported to the site and one million seeds were planted.

Some people complained that the project delayed the construction of the public park at that site, that the project was approved too quickly, and that it was a waste of money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csudh.edu/dearhabermas/publicart01bk.htm 'Not a Cornfield' idea is food for thought] by Daniel Hernandez&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://yubanet.com/artman/publish/article_25682.shtml 32 Acre Living Sculpture, Not a Cornfield, Rises in Los Angeles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060308174258/http://yubanet.com/artman/publish/article_25682.shtml |date=2006-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a small edible garden in the cornfield, and the site was used for film screenings and [[drum circle]]s.  Group and school tours were available.

The corn was harvested in November and December 2005, allowed to dry and put on display in the nearby empty Capital Milling Co. building for six months.  It was then used for the production of [[biodegradable]] containers.  The project left behind fertile soil.

"Not A Cornfield" was located at 1201 North Spring Street, Los Angeles, California, 90012.

'''''Officer and Laughing Girl''''', also known as '''''Officer and a Laughing Girl''''', '''''Officer With a Laughing Girl''''' or '''''De Soldaat en het Lachende Meisje''''', was painted by the Dutch artist [[Johannes Vermeer]] between 1655 and 1660. It was painted in [[oil on canvas]], typical of most Dutch artists of the time, and is 50.5 by 46&amp;nbsp;cm. It now resides in [[The Frick Collection]] in [[New York City|New York]].

''Officer and Laughing Girl'' includes many of the characteristics of Vermeer's style. The main subject is a woman in a yellow dress, light is coming from the left-hand side of the painting from an open window, and there is a large map on the wall. Each of these elements occur in some of his other paintings, although this painting differs slightly with the man also sitting at the table. Art historians, who have suggested conflicting interpretations of the work, believe that a painting by [[Gerard van Honthorst]] inspired the composition and that Vermeer used a [[camera obscura]] to create the perspective in this painting.

==Subject and interpretation==

The main subject is the woman, and soft, direct light falls on her face. She resembles Vermeer's wife, Catharina Bolnes, who is believed to have posed for many of his paintings. With x-ray photographs, art historians can see that Vermeer had planned to paint the woman with a large white collar which would have hidden much of her yellow dress.&lt;ref&gt;Essential Vermeer Website&lt;/ref&gt; Also, her cap was later extended to cover all of her hair, in order to draw attention to her face and expression. This yellow bodice with braiding has appeared in many of Vermeer's other portraits. It is called a schort and was usually worn as an everyday, common dress. The woman is also wearing a blue apron over her dress, but it is hidden in the shadows caused by the table. Blue aprons were common attire at that time because they hid stains well. Art historians have interpreted this to mean that the soldier surprised the girl with an impromptu visit during her morning chores.&lt;ref&gt;Essential Vermeer Website&lt;/ref&gt; The woman is holding a wine glass, usually used for white wine. Because at that time, wine cost more than beer, it illustrates her wealth.

The man in the painting is a cavalier wearing a red coat and an expensive hat, showing his wealth and rank. His hat is wide- brimmed and made of beaver pelt, which was weather resistant and good for snowy and rainy conditions. The pelts for these hats were imported from the New World. This hat was probably from [[New Netherlands]], which was then under the [[Dutch West India Company]]'s control.&lt;ref&gt;The Age of Rembrandt and Vermeer&lt;/ref&gt; The red in his uniform is associated with power and passion, bringing a passionate and emotional mood to the painting. His rank as an officer is identified by the black sash he wears. However, his presence in the immediate foreground is what the viewers notice first. His striking presence adds drama and mystery to the mood of the composition. This artistic device—in which an object is placed in the foreground to increase the depth of field of the overall painting—is called [[repoussoir]]. [[Caravaggio]] often used this technique and Vermeer probably learned it from a Caravaggist's painting.

The meaning of the interaction between the woman and the soldier is unknown. Many art historians believe that it only portrays a woman being innocently and honorably courted by this soldier. However, some have argued that her open hand and smile could be asking for payment before coitus.

"The Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer of Delft (1632-1675) holds a position of great honor among map historians. Several of his painting illustrate maps hanging on walls or globes standing on tables or cabinets. Vermeer painted these cartographical documents with such detail that it is often possible to identify the actual maps. Evidently, Vermeer was particularly attached to a [[Willem Blaeu]] - [[Balthasar Florisz van Berckenrode]] map of [[Holland]] and [[West Friesland (historical region)|West Friesland]], as he represented it as a wall decoration in three of his paintings... Though no longer extant, the map's existence is known from archival sources and second edition published by Willem Blaeu in 1621, titled "Nova et Accurata Totius Hollandiae Westfriesiaeq. Topographia, Descriptore Balthazaro Florentio a Berke[n]rode Batavo". Vermeer must have had a copy at his disposal (or the earlier one published by Van Berckenrode). Around 1658 he showed it as a wall decoration in his painting "Officer and Laughing Girl", which depicts a soldier in a large hat sitting with his back to viewer, talking with a smiling girl who holds a glass in her hand. Bright sunlight bathes the girl and the large map on the wall. Vermeer's gift for realism is evidenced by the fact that the wall map, mounted on linen and wooden rods, is identifiable as Blaeu's 1621 map of Holland and West Friesland. He captures all of its characteristic design, decoration, and geographic content."&lt;ref&gt;van der Krogt, Peter. 1998. "Vermeer's Blaeu Period." ''Mercator's World''. Volume 3 (5) September/October 1998. Page 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Window==
{{external media | width = 210px | align = right
 | headerimage=[[File:Johannes Vermeer 023 detail 01.jpg|210px]] | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rulvut1s9M Johannes Vermeer, ''Officer and Laughing Girl''], [[Frick Collection]],&lt;br&gt;1 min. 48 sec.&lt;ref name="frick"&gt;{{cite web | title =Johannes Vermeer, Officer and Laughing Girl | work = | publisher =[[Frick Collection]] | date = | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rulvut1s9M | accessdate =April 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The window and lighting is characteristic of Vermeer's interior paintings, most likely because it is modeled after the room he painted in. This window is extremely similar to the window in the ''Girl Reading a Letter'' and ''Open Window and the Milkmaid''. The glass in the window has many variations of color, showing Vermeer's precision in the details of this painting. Only bright light comes in from the window and no outside scene can be observed, as Vermeer never allows the viewer to see the outside world.

==Camera obscura==
Art historians believe that Vermeer used a device called a [[camera obscura]] to help him create the perspective in his painting.&lt;ref&gt;The World of Vermeer: 1632- 1675&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of using a mathematical formula or a [[vanishing point]], Vermeer probably used this mechanical device to show him what the relative size of the people should be. A camera obscura is similar to a camera as it projects an image seen through the aperture into a dark chamber. There is no historical evidence that Vermeer used such a device but the way he portrays perspective in many of his paintings, including ''Officer and Laughing Girl'', suggests that he did.

Kuhn&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, H., "A Study of the Pigments and the Grounds used by Jan Vermeer", ''Reports and Studies in the History of Art'', National Gallery of Art (Washington, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt; and also the more recent data collection&lt;ref&gt;Costaras, N., "A Study of the Materials and Techniques of Johannes Vermeer", in Gaskell, I. and Jonker, M. ed., ''Vermeer Studies'', in Studies in the History of Art, 55, National Gallery of Art, Washington 1998, pp. 148 – 167&lt;/ref&gt; revealed the use of the typical pigments of the Baroque period: [[ochres]], [[lead-tin-yellow]], natural [[ultramarine]], and [[azurite]]&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Vermeer, Officer and Laughing Girl, [http://colourlex.com/project/vermeer-officer-and-laughing-girl/ ColourLex]&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:2016-03-10 0896n ikebana.jpg|thumb|''Ohara-ryū'' floral arrangement]]
{{nihongo|'''''Ohara-ryū'''''|小原流|}} is a school of ''[[Ikebana]]'', or [[Japan]]ese [[Floral design|floral art]].

== History ==
Unshin Ohara (小原雲心) (1861-1916) started his own Ikebana school in 1895 when Japan opened up its economy to the West and began to import European flowers. The official founding date was in 1912.&lt;ref name="ohararyu.or.jp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohararyu.or.jp/english/history.html|title=History|publisher=Ohara School of Ikebana | access-date =2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the purpose of this art form, he developed shallow, circular, ceramic vases, which became known as the ''[[moribana]]'' style.&lt;ref name="ohararyu.or.jp1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohararyu.or.jp/english/his_what.html|title=What is Moribana?|publisher=Ohara School of Ikebana | access-date =2016-10-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ohara's son Koun (小原光雲) (1880-1938) invented a descriptive teaching method and moved from individual lessons to group classes. For the first time, teaching certificates were awarded to women. Under Houn's guidance, the school grew. Its headquarters were in Tokyo and Kobe, with other centers in New York and Sao Paulo. He developed the typical landscape style, as well as the ''[[rimpa]]'' and ''[[bunjin]]'' floral arrangements. The inspirations for ''rimpa'' came to him from rolling picture scrolls, screens (''[[byōbu]]'') and painted subjects of the 17th century. Chinese poetry became the foundation for ''bunjin'' arrangements. Houn (小原豊雲) (1908-1995) followed as the third headmaster in 1938.&lt;ref name="ohararyu.or.jp"/&gt; 

Houn's son, Natsuki Ohara (小原夏樹) (1949-1992) in turn was appointed as his successor in 1975. In the same year, the small ''moribana'' style, using semi circle ceramic vases, was developed. On the occasion of the 90th anniversary of the Ohara school in 1985, Natsuki created a new style called ''hana-mai'' (dancing flowers) and later the ''Hana-isho'' forms.&lt;ref name="ohararyu.or.jp1"/&gt; He died in 1992 at age 42 after an illness and was posthumously named as fourth headmaster. In 1995, his father Houn died at age 86. Houn's daughter Wakako Ohara (b. 1940 小原稚子) became interim headmistress until April 2010, when Hiroki Ohara (小原宏貴) became the fifth headmaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ikebanahq.org/ohara.php|title=Ohara School|publisher=Ikebana International | access-date =2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ikebanabeta.nwcic.com/schools-of-ikebana/ohara/|title=Ohara|publisher=Ikebana International San Francisco Bay Area Chapter #31 | access-date =2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ohararyu.or.jp"/&gt;

'''Oral poetry''' is [[poetry]] that is composed and transmitted without the aid of [[writing]]. The complex relationships between written and spoken literature in some societies can make this definition hard to maintain.

==Background==

Oral poetry is sometimes considered to include any poetry which is performed live. In many cultures, oral poetry overlaps with, or is identical with, [[song]]. Meanwhile, although the term oral etymologically means 'to do with the [[mouth]]', in some cultures oral poetry is also performed by other means, such as [[Drum (communication)|talking drums]] in some African cultures. Oral poetry exists most clearly within [[oral culture]]s, but it can survive, and indeed flourish, in highly [[literacy|literate]] cultures.

Oral poetry differs from [[oral literature]] in general because oral literature encompasses linguistic registers which are not considered poetry. In most oral literature, poetry is defined by the fact that it conforms to [[Meter (poetry)|metrical rules]]; examples of non-poetic oral literature in Western culture include some [[joke]]s, [[public speaking|speeches]] and [[storytelling]].

An influential movement in the study of oral poetry, both because it helped to bring oral poetry within the realms of academic literary study and because it illuminated the ways in which poetic form and orality interrelate, has been the [[Oral-formulaic composition|oral-formulaic theory]] developed by [[Milman Parry]] and [[Albert Lord]]. This theory showed how stock phrases could enable poets to improvise verse. One consequence of Parry and Lord's work is that orally improvised poetry (as opposed to poetry which is composed without the use of writing but then memorised and performed later) is sometimes seen as the example ''par excellence'' of oral poetry. Examples of orally improvised poetry are the epics of the Serbo-Croatian ''guslar''s studied by Parry and Lord, Basque ''[[bertsolaritza]]'', and [[freestyle rap]].

Much oral poetry, however, is memorised verbatim – though the precise wording, particularly of words which are not essential to sense or metre, do tend to change from one performance to another, and one performer to another.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, David C. Memory in Oral Traditions: The Cognitive Psychology of Epic, Ballads, and Counting-out Rhymes. New York: Oxford University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the original composition of a memorised oral poem may have been undertaken without the use of writing, memorial traditions sometimes originate in a written text. Likewise, memorised oral poems can come to be written down, leading to a situation in which written versions in turn influence memorised versions. Prominent examples of memorised oral poetry are some [[nursery rhyme]]s, [[ballad]]s and medieval Scandinavian [[Skaldic verse#Skaldic poetry|skaldic verse]].

==Regional and national traditions==

Poetical improvisation is a living tradition in many parts of the world. Regional traditions may include but surely are not limited to:

* ''La Payada'' in [[Argentina]]
* Basque ''[[Bertsolaritza]]''
* [[Malta|Maltese]] ''għana''&lt;ref&gt;[[:mt:Għana#G.C4.A7ana Spirtu Pront|Għana Spirtu Pront]], in Maltese Wikipedija, accessed Apr 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''canto a braccio'' of [[Lazio]], Italy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cantoabraccio.it Festival Regionale di Canto a Braccio, Borbona (RI)] in Italian, accessed Apr 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''improvvisazione in ottava rima'' of [[Tuscany]], Italy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accademiadellottava.it/filmati.html Accademia dell'Ottava] in Italian, accessed Apr 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''stornelli'' and other local traditions in other parts of Italy
* [[Rapping|Rap]], a component of the [[hip hop]] genre of American music.

'''Pholage''' is an artistic technique and method of graphic reproduction  invented by [[Manuel Bennett]] in 1959.

An extension of [[collage]], instead of consisting of mounting numerous pieces of colored paper or other material to make one original, pholage consists of taking positive or [[Negative (photography)|negative]] photographic film images, cutting out sections called "[[masks]]", and reassembling them to create a varied reproduction of the original.  Additional drawings can be added to the color-separated original to further manipulate the original.

While collage yields a single piece of art, pholage can be reproduced by exposing photosensitive paper through the mask, or any other reproductive technique.

The '''Pittsburgh Crèche''' is a large-scale [[nativity scene|crèche]], or nativity scene, located on the outside courtyard of the [[U.S. Steel Tower]] in downtown [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania. Since 1999, the crèche appears annually during the winter season from November's [[Light Up Night]] to [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] in January. It is the only authorized replica of the [[nativity scene]] in [[Saint Peter’s Basilica]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moody|first1=Chuck|title=Downtown crèche going on display Nov. 21|url=http://www.pittsburghcatholic.org/newsarticles_more.php?id=1026|accessdate=22 October 2014|work=Pittsburgh Catholic|date=2003-11-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023050813/http://www.pittsburghcatholic.org/newsarticles_more.php?id=1026|archivedate=23 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sponsored by the ecumenical Christian Leaders Fellowship.

==History==
In 1989, the Supreme Court banned a small nativity scene displayed in the Allegheny Courthouse due to its religious implications (in violation of the [[Establishment clause]]) in ''[[County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union]]''.&lt;ref name="Jr.2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ray W. Rowney Jr.|title=License to Steal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVBSAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PT216|date=31 May 2012|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=978-1-4771-0529-0|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Illinois Municipal Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AskqAQAAMAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Illinois Municipal League.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In wake of this ruling, the U.S. Steel Tower erected their own version of a crèche in downtown Pittsburgh, this time on privately owned land. Louis D. Astorino, chairman of the architectural firm L.D. Astorino Companies, traveled to Rome and was inspired to recreate the nativity scene in Pittsburgh.

The Pittsburgh Crèche Endowment Fund was created in 2006 to raise donations for the crèche construction and restoration each year.

==Design==
The crèche is a replica of the stable constructed by Italian architect Umberto Mezzana. It is 64 feet wide, 42 feet high, and 36 feet long. The human sculptures were designed by Pietro Simonelli.

===Figures===
The number of figures featured in the crèche has increased over time. The original 1999 display featured baby Jesus, Mary, Joseph, the Three Kings, two shepherds, and an assortment of animals. The next year, Simonelli added an angel that hung over the crib and more animals. In 2001, a woman and child were added. In 2002, JE Scenic Technologies added a kneeling shepherd, and later, they created a reclining cow. Two more shepherds and two more angels were later included, bringing the total figures in the display to 20.

'''''Portrait of Gustave Geffroy''''' is a c. 1895 painting by the French [[Post-Impressionist]] artist [[Paul Cézanne]]. It portrays [[Gustave Geffroy]], a French novelist and [[art critic]] noted as one of the earliest historians of [[Impressionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/geffroyg.htm |title=Geffroy, Gustave |publisher=Dictionary of Art Historians |accessdate=2011-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1894, Geffroy wrote a sympathetic article in the periodical ''[[Le Journal (Paris)|Le Journal]]'' praising the work of painter [[Paul Cézanne]] who until then had received little praise in critical circles.&lt;ref name=Newton&gt;Newton, 41-42&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual friend [[Claude Monet]] arranged for a meeting between the two in November of that year which ended abruptly due to Cézanne's oft-noted erratic behavior.&lt;ref name=MurphyA&gt;Murphy, 100-01&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Geffroy continued to write favorably of Cézanne, believing, "He is a great teller of truth. Passionate and candid, silent and subtle, he will go to [[The Louvre]]."&lt;ref name=MurphyB&gt;Murphy, 163-64&lt;/ref&gt; Cézanne expressed thanks in letters to Geffroy in the months following their meeting and, in a display of gratitude (and possible feeling that Geffroy understood him), he elected to paint Geffroy's [[portrait]].&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;

The painter sent the critic a request in April 1895, after which Geffroy sat for Cézanne daily over a span of three months in the study at his home in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=MurphyA/&gt; After the three months' time, Cézanne, disappointed with the portrait's results, fled both the painting and Paris itself for his home in [[Aix-en-Provence]]. In a July 6 letter to Monet, he explained, "I am a little upset at the meager result I obtained, especially after so many sittings and successive bursts of enthusiasm and despair."&lt;ref&gt;Wadley, 103&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been speculated that, despite his words of gratitude in the same letter to Monet noting Geffroy's patience over the three-month span, the artist had built up feelings of resentment, even hostility, toward the critic, causing his abandonment of the project for seclusion in Aix.&lt;ref name=Howard&gt;Howard, 135&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons for the breakdown in relations on Cézanne's part have been attributed to everything from politics to artistic principles to religion.&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Orsay&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/painting/commentaire_id/gustave-geffroy-10542.html?tx_commentaire_pi1%5BpidLi%5D=509&amp;tx_commentaire_pi1%5Bfrom%5D=841&amp;cHash=ed05bba678 |title=Paul Cézanne: Gustave Geffroy |publisher=Musée d'Orsay |year=2006 |accessdate=2011-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cézanne was unhappy with the painting and it was never finished, yet ''Portrait of Gustave Geffroy'' became a popular retrospective work after his death.&lt;ref name=Orsay/&gt; [[Cubist]] painters were interested in the [[geometry|geometrical]] dimensions of the bookcase and [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] of vast table space in relation to the rest of the pictorial space.&lt;ref name=Orsay/&gt; Geffroy noted that Cézanne painted the entire canvas at once, leaving the face and hands for last; they were ultimately unfinished.&lt;ref name=Howard/&gt;&lt;ref name=Orsay/&gt; The portrait has been described as angular, with the figure of Geffroy centered as a pyramidal or triangular figure, and surrounded by shelves, books and figurines complementing and converging on top of his profile.&lt;ref&gt;Wadley, 59&lt;/ref&gt; The multiple angles of perspective, particularly with the books both in cases and on the table, have been noted for their "zig-zag" effect on the viewer, creating movement within the painting.&lt;ref name=Howard/&gt;

The portrait has been noted as the continuation of a recurring Cézanne theme: people in their natural environment, reserved and unimposing, immersed in their everyday tasks.&lt;ref name=Schapiro&gt;Schapiro, 100&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been compared to the earlier ''Portrait of Duranty'' by [[Edgar Degas]], from which critics have speculated Cézanne drew inspiration.&lt;ref name=Howard/&gt;&lt;ref name=Orsay/&gt;

The painting was donated to the French state in 1969 by the family of collector [[Auguste Pellerin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nga.gov.au/exhibition/masterpiecesfromparis/Default.cfm?IRN=191186&amp;BioArtistIRN=21796&amp;MnuID=SRCH&amp;ArtistIRN=21796&amp;ViewID=2 |title=Gustave Geffroy 1895-96 |publisher=National Gallery of Australia |year=2009 |accessdate=2011-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is on permanent display at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in Paris.

{{Mary}}
'''Protestant views on Mary''' include the [[theological]] positions of major Protestant representatives such as Martin Luther and John Calvin as well as some modern representatives.  While it is difficult to generalize about the place of [[Mary, mother of Jesus]] in [[Protestantism]] given the great diversity of Protestant beliefs, some summary statements are attempted.

While reformers such as [[Martin Luther]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and [[John Calvin]] at different points in their writings had expressed what seem to be examples of a residual [[catholic]] Marian piety,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Walter Tappolet |year=1962 |title=Das Marienlob der Reformatoren |publisher=Tübingen &lt;!--really the location, but no publisher given--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=George Henry Tavard |year=1996 |title=The Thousand Faces of the Virgin Mary |publisher=Liturgical Press |pages=103 |isbn=0-8146-5914-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Protestant emphasis on ''[[sola scriptura]]'', ''[[solus Christus]]'', ''[[soli Deo gloria]]'', among others kept the honoring of Mary to a minimum, and Protestant teaching about Mary co-terminous with her short part in scripture and [[creed]]s. A newer Protestant view of Mary emerging out of the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical movement]] sees Mary as a feisty, assertive, and radically Christian woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Scot McKnight |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2006/december/8.26.html |title=The Mary We Never Knew |journal=Christianity Today |accessdate=2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protestant theologians==
Some early Protestants venerated and honored Mary. [[Martin Luther]] said of Mary:

{{quote|the honor given to the mother of God has been rooted so deeply into the hearts of men that no one wants to hear any opposition to this celebration... We also grant that she should be honored, since we, according to Saint Paul's words [Romans 12] are indebted to show honor one to another for the sake of the One who dwells in us, Jesus Christ. Therefore we have an obligation to honor Mary. But be careful to give her honor that is fitting. Unfortunately, I worry that we give her all too high an honor for she is accorded much more esteem than she should be given or than she accounted to herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Basely|first1=Joel R.|title=Festival Sermons of Martin Luther|date=2005|publisher=Mark V Publiscations|location=Dearborn, Michigan|isbn=0-9652403-1-2|page=167|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XfLCU2Nkxa8C&amp;pg=RA1-PA157&amp;|accessdate=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[John Calvin]] said, "It cannot be denied that God in choosing and destining Mary to be the Mother of his Son, granted her the highest honor."{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} [[Zwingli]] said, "I esteem immensely the Mother of God" and "The more the honor and love of Christ increases among men, so much the esteem and honor given to Mary should grow".{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Thus the idea of respect and high honour was not rejected by the first Protestants; but rather it was the matter of degrees of honor given to Mary, as the mother of Jesus, that [[Protestant Reformers]] were concerned with, and therefore the practical implications for [[Mariology]] are still a matter of debate.

===John Wycliffe===
The pre-Lutheran reformer [[John Wycliffe]] reflected the Marian spirit of the [[later Middle Ages]] in one of his earlier sermons: "It seems to me impossible that we should obtain the reward of Heaven without the help of Mary. There is no sex or age, no rank or position, of anyone in the whole human race, which has no need to call for the help of the Holy Virgin."&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martin Luther===
[[File:StPierreJeuneP156.JPG|thumb|A statue of Mary in the Protestant church of [[Saint-Pierre-le-Jeune Protestant Church|Saint-Pierre-le-Jeune]], Strasbourg]]
{{main article|Lutheran Marian theology}}
Despite Luther's polemics against his Roman Catholic opponents over issues concerning Mary and the saints, theologians appear to agree that Luther adhered to the Marian decrees of the [[ecumenical council]]s and dogmas of the church. He held fast to the belief that Mary was a perpetual virgin and the [[Theotokos]] or [[Mother of God]].&lt;ref&gt;Remigius Bäumer, ''Marienlexikon Gesamtausgabe'', Leo Scheffczyk, ed., (Regensburg: Institutum Marianum, 1994), 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Special attention is given to the assertion, that Luther some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the [[Immaculate Conception]] by [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life.&lt;ref&gt;Bäumer, 191&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the [[Assumption of Mary]], he stated that the [[Bible]] did not say anything about it. Important to him was the belief that Mary and the saints do live on after death.&lt;ref&gt;Bäumer, 190.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Throughout his career as a priest-professor-reformer, Luther preached, taught, and argued about the veneration of Mary with a verbosity that ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemics. His views are intimately linked to his christocentric theology and its consequences for liturgy and piety."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1 =[[Eric W. Gritsch]] |editor1=H. George Anderson |editor2=J. Francis Stafford |editor3=Joseph A. Burgess |title=The One Mediator, The Saints and Mary, Lutherans and Roman Catholic in Dialogue |volume=VII |location=Minneapolis |publisher=Augsburg Fortress |year=1992 |pages=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luther, while revering Mary, came to criticize the "Papists" for blurring the line, between high admiration of the grace of God wherever it is seen in a human being, and religious service given to another creature. He considered the Roman Catholic practice of celebrating [[saint]]s' days and making intercessory requests addressed especially to Mary and other departed saints to be [[idolatry]].&lt;ref&gt;''Luther's Works'', 47, pp. 45f; see also, ''Lutherans and Catholics in Dialogue'' VIII, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Calvin===
{{main article|John Calvin's views on Mary}}
John Calvin accepted Mary's perpetual virginity and the title "Mother of God", in a qualified sense. He considered himself the real follower of Mary{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} because he freed her from misuses of these titles and undeserved "Papist" honour which is due only to Jesus Christ, and for returning this honour to him alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Calvin |title=Commentary on John |volume=1 |chapter=On John 2:1-11 |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom34.viii.i.html |accessdate=2008-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin stated that Mary cannot be the advocate of the faithful, since she needs God’s grace as much as any other human being.&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, ''Works'', Serm. de la proph. de Christ: op  35, 686.&lt;/ref&gt; If the Catholic Church praises her as Queen of Heaven, it is blasphemous and contradicts her own intention, because she is praised and not God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Calvin |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom31.ix.ix.html |title=Harmony of the Evangelists |volume=1 |chapter=On Luke 1:46-50 |accessdate=2008-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvin expressed deep concern over its possible "superstitious" use of the title "Mother of God" from the teachings of the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] :&lt;ref&gt;Calvin to the Foreigners’ Church in London, 27 October 1552, in [[George Cornelius Gorham]], [https://books.google.com/books?vid=0bbTMcT6wXFWRHGP&amp;id=esICAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;dq=%22george+cornelius+gorham%22 ''Gleanings of a few scattered ears, during the period of [[Reformation in England]] and of the times immediately succeeding : A.D. 1533 to A.D. 1588''] (London: Bell and Daldy, 1857), p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not doubt that there has been some ignorance in their having reproved this mode of speech, — that the Virgin Mary is the Mother of God … I cannot dissemble that it is found to be a bad practice ordinarily to adopt this title in speaking of this Virgin: and, for my part, I cannot consider such language as good, proper, or suitable… for to say, the Mother of God for the Virgin Mary, can only serve to harden the ignorant in their superstitions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Karl Barth===
{{main article|Karl Barth's views on Mary}}
[[Karl Barth]] (1886–1968), a [[Reformed Protestant]], was a leading 20th century theologian. Aware of the common dogmatic tradition of the early Church, Barth fully accepted the dogma of Mary as the [[Mother of God]]. In his view, through Mary, Jesus belongs to the human race; through Jesus, Mary is Mother of God. Barth also agreed with the [[Dogma]] of the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|Virgin Birth]]. It meant to him that Jesus as a human does not have a father and that as the Son of God he has no mother. The Holy Spirit, through whom Mary conceived, is not just any spirit, but it is God himself whose act must be understood spiritually and not physically.&lt;ref&gt;Barth, Kirchliche Dogmatic I, 2, 219&lt;/ref&gt;  Mary is "full of grace" according to Barth, but this grace is not earned but totally given to her. Regarding Mary’s [[virginity]] after birth, Barth argued that the Church adopted this position not because of Mary but in defence of its [[Christology]]. Barth considered the Roman Catholic veneration of Mary a terrible mistake and [[idolatry|idolatrous]] heresy.&lt;ref&gt;"Where ever Mary is venerated, and devotion to her takes place, there the Church of Christ does not exist" (''Church Dogmatics'', I, 2, 154). "Catholic mariology is a cancer, a sick theological development, and cancers should be cut out" (''Church Dogmatics'', I, 2, 153). "The heresy of the Catholic Church is its mariology and Marian cult." (''Church Dogmatics'', I, 2, 157).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues in Protestant theology==

===Mother of God===
The designation ''[[Theotokos]]'' (in {{lang-el|Θεοτόκος}}) or "Bearer of God" for Mary emerged in the [[Church of Alexandria]] and was later adopted by the [[patristic]]-era universal Church at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431. It is a statement of [[Christology|Christological]] orthodoxy (See: [[Hypostasis (Christianity)|hypostasis]]) in opposition to [[Nestorianism]] and also a devotional [[Titles of Mary|title of Mary]] used extensively in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Oriental Orthodox Church|Oriental Orthodox]], and [[Anglican]] liturgy. The second verse of a well known Protestant hymn, [[Ye Watchers and Ye Holy Ones]], is directly addressed to Mary and is based on an Orthodox prayer.

Presently the [[Lutheran World Federation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.lutheranworld.org/sites/default/files/1993-Lutheran_Orthodox_Dialogue-EN.pdf |title=7th Plenary of the Lutheran-Orthodox Joint Commission in Sandbjerg, Denmark |chapter=The Ecumenical Councils and Authority in and of the Church |publisher=The Lutheran World Federation |date=10 July 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; accepts the teachings of the [[Council of Ephesus]] and other [[ecumenical council]]s of the [[patristic]]-era Church, including the formulation "Mother of God" as a function of Christ's [[hypostatic union]]. Luther says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Martin Luther |title=Selected Writings of Martin Luther |year=2007 |editor=Theodore G. Tappert |publisher=Fortress Press |isbn=0-8006-6226-1 |pages=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We too know very well that God did not derive his divinity from Mary; but it does not follow that it is therefore wrong to say that God was born of Mary, that God is Mary’s Son, and that Mary is God’s mother.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mariolatry===

{{Expand section|date=May 2016|small=no}}

In the 18th and 19th centuries various groups of Protestants began to use the term ''Mariolatry'' to refer to the [[Veneration of Mary in Roman Catholicism|Catholic]], [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] practices of [[Marian devotions|Marian veneration and devotion]]. In their view, the attention paid to Mary is extreme, and may not only distract from the worship of [[God in Christianity|God]], but actually borders on [[idolatry]].&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Christian Church'' by Philip Schaff 1960 {{ISBN|0-8028-8049-5}} pages 411 and 422&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Keegan, Matthew C. (2011, April 27). Book Review: The Virgin Mary in the Light of the Word of God. ''WordJourney Magazine'', Retrieved from http://www.wordjourney.com&lt;/ref&gt;

This trend has taken various directions over time, in that while some Protestants have at times softened their attitude towards it, others have strengthened their opposition in the 21st century. For instance, during the May 2006 celebrations at [[Our Lady of Walsingham]] in England, as [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] held a Marian procession, Protestant [[heckler]]s held banners that condemned [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Masses]], idolatry and "Mariolatry".&lt;ref&gt;''The Everything Jesus Book: His Life, His Teachings'' by Jon Kennedy 2006 {{ISBN|1-59337-712-6}} page 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Walsingham in Literature and Culture from the Middle Ages to Modernity'' by Dominic Janes, Gary Fredric Waller 2010 {{ISBN|0-7546-6924-6}} pages 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Charles Davidson''', [[Order of Canada|CM]], [[Order of British Columbia|OBC]] (born 4 November 1946 in [[Hydaburg, Alaska]]), is a [[Canada|Canadian]] artist of [[Haida people|Haida]] heritage. Davidson’s Haida name is ''Guud San Glans'', which means "Eagle of The Dawn". He is a leading figure in the renaissance of [[Haida art]] and culture.

==Life and work==

[[File:White Rock, BC - Haida totem pole 01.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Detail of "Gyaana", totem pole designed by Davidson and carved by him and others, Lions Lookout Park, [[White Rock, British Columbia]], Canada.]]

Davidson is known internationally as a carver of totem poles and masks, printmaker, painter and jeweller.  He lives near Vancouver, working out of a studio on [[Semiahmoo First Nation]] land and making annual return visits to [[Haida Gwaii]].

His parents are [[Claude Davidson (Haida artist)|Claude]] and Vivian Davidson. Through Claude, he is the grandson of the Haida artist and memoirist [[Florence Davidson]].  He is a member of the Eagle [[Moiety (kinship)|moiety]], Ts'ał'lanas lineage.  His younger brother and former apprentice, [[Reg Davidson]], is also a Haida carver.

In infancy, Robert Davidson moved with his family to the Haida village of [[Masset, British Columbia]], on [[Queen Charlotte Islands|Haida Gwaii (Queen Charlotte Islands)]]. For high school, he moved to [[Vancouver]] to attend [[Point Grey Secondary School]] in 1965. In 1966 he became apprenticed to the master Haida carver [[Bill Reid]].  In 1967 he began studies at the [[Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design|Vancouver School of Art]].  In 1969 he carved and raised the first totem pole on Haida Gwaii in approximately ninety years.

His works are included in the collections of the [[National Gallery of Canada]], the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]] and the [[Vancouver Art Gallery]].&lt;ref name=GG&gt;{{cite web|title=Eight remarkable Canadians win Governor General’s Awards in Visual and Media Arts from the Canada Council for the Arts|url=http://canadacouncil.ca/en/media-arts/news-room/news/2010/governor-generals-awards-in-visual-and-media-arts-%282010%29|work=news release|publisher=Canada Council for the Arts|accessdate=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant solo exhibition of his work, ''Robert Davidson: The Abstract Edge'', was organized by the [[Museum of Anthropology]] at the [[University of British Columbia]] (UBC) for viewing at the [[National Gallery of Canada]] in [[Ottawa]] in 2007.

==Notable works==
Sabo's first work that received mainstream attention was in May 2014, where he put up posters attacking Democratic politician and then-candidate for [[governor of Texas]] [[Wendy Davis (politician)|Wendy Davis]],&lt;ref name="Huffington Post 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Laura|last1=Bassett|title=Wendy Davis Greeted By ‘Abortion Barbie’ Posters In Los Angeles|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/22/wendy-davis-abortion-barbie_n_5374101.html|date=May 22, 2014|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=August 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; who held a thirteen-hour-long [[filibuster]] to block [[Texas Senate Bill 5|Senate Bill 5]] (a measure which included more restrictive [[abortion]] regulations for Texas) a year prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Tanya|last1=Ghahremani|title=Texas Senator Wendy Davis' 13-Hour Filibuster Successfully Beats Abortion Bill|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2013/06/wendy-davis-filibuster|date=June 13, 2013|website=[[Complex Media|Complex]]|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The posters feature mostly-naked [[Barbie dolls]] with a plastic baby in her belly area and Davis' face plastered on, with the caption: "Hollywood welcomes Abortion Barbie Wendy Davis".

During the [[2016 Republican National Convention]] in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], Sabo placed posters (most of which were themed to the 2016 [[Dinesh D'Souza]] political docudrama ''[[Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party|Hillary's America]]''), which criticized [[Hillary Clinton]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], at local bus stops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bond|first1=Paul|title=Conservative Street Artist Slams Hillary Clinton, Democrats in Artwork Outside GOP Convention|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/conservative-street-artist-slams-hillary-911843|accessdate=September 14, 2016|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, Sabo claimed credit for putting up posters (in a style heavily inspired by the works of [[Barbara Kruger]]) of actress [[Meryl Streep]] with producer [[Harvey Weinstein]] with the words "She knew" emblazoned across Streep's face, a reference to rumors that Streep had been aware that [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|Weinstein was a serial sexual predator]] before the information became public. He said that he considered it retribution for Streep's role in the film ''[[The Post (film)|The Post]]'' because he believed the film was a direct attack on [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref name="Guardian December 2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carroll|first1=Rory|title=Rightwing artist put up Meryl Streep 'she knew' posters as revenge for Trump|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/20/meryl-streep-she-knew-harvey-weinstein-posters-sabo-artist?CMP=share_btn_tw|accessdate=21 December 2017|date=20 December 2017|publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Han|first1=Angie |title=The reviews are in and critics absolutely adore Steven Spielberg's 'The Post'|url=http://mashable.com/2017/12/06/the-post-movie-review-roundup/|accessdate=December 6, 2017|work=[[Mashable]] |date=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, days before the [[90th Academy Awards]], Sabo vandalized three billboards in the Hollywood area (in a reference to nominee ''[[Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri]]'') that criticized the entertainment industry for shielding pedophiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bond |first=Paul |date=February 28, 2018 |title=Street Artist Erects Three Billboards Over Hollywood: 'Oscar for Biggest Pedophile Goes To ...' |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/street-artist-erects-three-billboards-hollywood-oscar-biggest-pedophile-goes-1089239 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=July 24, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Sabo vandalized a billboard in Los Angeles promoting ''[[Who Is America?]]'', a television series created by British comedian [[Sacha Baron Cohen]]. He mocked up a image of Baron Cohen as a war veteran, in relation to [[Sarah Palin]]'s comments on the show, who claimed that Baron Cohen had interviewed her in disguise, and disrespected the U.S. military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sacha-baron-cohen-criticized-stolen-valor-hijacked-la-billboard-1127231|title=Sacha Baron Cohen Criticized for "Stolen Valor" on Hijacked Billboard Near CBS Offices|work=The Hollywood Reporter|first=Paul|last=Bond|date=July 16, 2018|accessdate=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2018, Sabo vandalized a billboard promoting [[Halloween (2018 film)|the 2018 ''Halloween'' film]], which placed the face of [[Maxine Waters]], a Democratic member of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], on [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]]' body, with the hashtag #uncivildemocrats also plastered on. This work was done in response to Waters encouraging people to harass President Trump and [[Cabinet of Donald Trump|his Cabinet members]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bond |first=Paul |date=October 19, 2018 |title='Halloween' Billboard Hijacked to Target Maxine Waters |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/maxine-waters-halloween-billboard-made-by-la-street-artist-sabo-1153715 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=October 19, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The First Supper''''' (1988) is a work of art by [[Susan Dorothea White]], based on [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s painting ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]''. White's painting is acrylic on a large wood panel (1.2 x 2.4 m) and, in a challenge to the patriarchal concept of thirteen men on one side of a table, shows 13 women from all regions of the world; the woman in the position of Leonardo's Christ figure is an Australian aboriginal wearing a T-shirt with the [[Australian Aboriginal Flag]].  The only white woman seen is in the position of Judas.  She dines on a Coca-Cola and a hamburger, while all the other women are seen with a bread roll and glass of water.

'''''The Scapegoat''''' (1854–56) is a painting by [[William Holman Hunt]] which depicts the "[[scapegoat]]" described in the [[Book of Leviticus]]. On the [[Day of Atonement]], a goat would have its horns wrapped with a red cloth – representing the sins of the community – and be driven off.

Hunt started painting on the shore of the [[Dead Sea]], and continued it in his studio in London. The work exists in two versions, a small version in brighter colours with a dark-haired goat and a rainbow, in [[Manchester Art Gallery]], and a larger version in more muted tones with a light-haired goat in the [[Lady Lever Art Gallery]] in [[Port Sunlight]]. Both were created over the same period, with the smaller Manchester version being described as "preliminary" to the larger Lady Lever version, which was the one exhibited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/picture-of-month/displaypicture.aspx?id=379 ''The Scapegoat''], Lady Lever Art Gallery&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In the [[Royal Academy]] exhibition catalogue Hunt wrote that "the scene was painted at [[Jabal Usdum|Oosdoom]], on the margin of the salt-encrusted shallows of the [[Dead Sea]]. The mountains beyond are those of [[Edom]]."&lt;ref name = "bron"&gt;Bronkhurst, Judith, ''Wiliam Holman Hunt, A Catalogue Raisonné'', vol. 1, p.180.&lt;/ref&gt; He painted most of the work on location in 1854, but completed the work in London in the following year, adding some touches in 1856 before it was exhibited at the academy in that year.&lt;ref name = "bron"/&gt;

The painting was the only major work completed by Hunt during his first trip to the Holy Land, to which he had travelled after a crisis of religious faith. Hunt intended to experience the actual locations of the Biblical narratives as a means to confront the relationship between faith and truth. While in [[Jerusalem]], Hunt had met [[Henry Wentworth Monk]], a [[millenarianism|millenarian]] prophet who had distinctive theories about the meaning of the scapegoat and the proximity of the [[Last Judgement]]. Monk was particularly preoccupied with [[Christian Zionism]].

Hunt chose a subject derived from the [[Torah]] as part of a project to convert Jews to Christianity. He believed that Judaic views of the scapegoat were consistent with the Christian conception of the Messiah as a suffering figure. He wrote to his friend [[John Everett Millais|Millais]], "I am sanguine that [the Scapegoat] may be a means of leading any reflecting Jew to see a reference to the Messiah as he was, and not as they understand, a temporal King."&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, G.H.,'' John Everett Millais: A Biography'', 1998, Constable, p.158&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Book of Leviticus]] describes a "scapegoat" which must be ritually expelled from the flocks of the Israelite tribes as part of a sacrificial ritual of cleansing. In line with traditional Christian theology, Hunt believed that the scapegoat was a prototype for the redemptive sacrifice of Jesus, and that the goat represented that aspect of the [[Messiah]] described in [[Isaiah]] as a "suffering servant" of God. Hunt had the picture framed with the quotations "Surely he hath borne our Griefs and carried our Sorrows; Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of GOD and afflicted." ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 53:4) and "And the Goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a Land not inhabited." ([[Leviticus]] 16:22)

==Critical reception==

The reaction to the painting was not as Hunt expected. In his autobiography ''Pre-Raphaelitism and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood'', Hunt relates the first reaction to the painting by art dealer [[Ernest Gambart]]:
{{quote|Gambart, the picture-dealer, was ever shrewd and entertaining. He came in his turn to my studio, and I led him to ''The Scapegoat''. "What do you call that?"&lt;br/&gt;"''The Scapegoat''."&lt;br/&gt;"Yes; but what is it doing?"&lt;br/&gt;"You will understand by the title, ''Le bouc expiatoire''."&lt;br/&gt;"But why ''expiatoire''?" he asked.&lt;br/&gt;"Well, there is a book called the Bible, which gives an account of the animal. You will remember."&lt;br/&gt;"No," he replied, "I never heard of it."&lt;br/&gt;"Ah, I forgot, the book is not known in France, but English people read it more or less," I said, "and they would all understand the story of the beast being driven into the wilderness."&lt;br/&gt;"You are mistaken. No one would know anything about it, and if I bought the picture it would be left on my hands. Now, we will see," replied the dealer. "My wife is an English lady, there is a friend of hers, an English girl, in the carriage with her, we will ask them up, you shall tell them the title; we will see. Do not say more."&lt;br/&gt;The ladies were conducted into the room. "Oh how pretty! what is it?" they asked.&lt;br/&gt;"It is ''The Scapegoat''." I said.&lt;br/&gt;There was a pause. "Oh yes," they commented to one another, "it is a peculiar goat, you can see by the ears, they droop so."&lt;br/&gt;The dealer then, nodding with a smile towards me, said to them, "It is in the wilderness."&lt;br/&gt;The ladies: "Is that the wilderness now? Are you intending to introduce any others of the flock?" And so the dealer was proved to be right, and I had over-counted on the picture's intelligibility.|William Holman Hunt, loc cit.&lt;ref name=Hunt1906 /&gt; }}
[[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], in a letter to [[William Allingham]] in 1856, called the painting "a grand thing, but not for the public". [[Ford Madox Brown]] wrote in his diary: "Hunt's ''Scapegoat'' requires to be seen to be believed in. Only then can it be understood how, by the might of genius, out of an old goat, and some saline encrustations, can be made one of the most tragic and impressive works in the annals of art.". Ernest Gambart, as related by Hunt, was less enthusiastic, and was later to remark: "I wanted a nice religious picture and he painted me a great goat."&lt;ref name=Rossetti1856 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cook1905 /&gt;  ''[[The Art Journal]]'' in 1860, at the time of the exhibition of Hunt's later work ''[[The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple]]'', was to characterise the painting as "having disappointed even his warmest admirers".&lt;ref name=AJ1860 /&gt;

At the time of the exhibition of ''The Scapegoat'' itself, in 1856, ''The Art Journal'' questioned Hunt's eye for colour in the painting, casting doubt that the mountains of [[Edom]], seen in the background, really were in actual appearance as painted – which Matthew Dennison, writing in ''[[The Spectator]]'' in 2008 described the Manchester version as "Day-Glo striations of lilac, crimson and egg-yolk yellow". Dennison suggests the possibility that Hunt was painting the scene from memory, when he was finishing the painting in London after he had returned from his trip to the Dead Sea, and mis-remembered it.&lt;ref name=Dennison2008 /&gt; Hunt's own description of the landscape that he painted is that "never was so extraordinary a scene of beautifully arranged horrible wilderness. It is black, full of asphalte scum and in the hand slimy, and smarting as a sting – No one can stand and say that it is not accursed of God."&lt;ref name=Dennison2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fuller1989 /&gt; Art critic [[Peter Fuller]], in 1989, described the landscape of the painting as "a terrible image &amp;#91;&amp;hellip;&amp;#93; of the world as a god-forsaken wasteland, a heap of broken images where the sun beats".&lt;ref name=Fuller1989 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3966">[[File:Woody Guthrie 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Woody Guthrie in 1943 with his [[guitar]] labeled "This machine kills fascists"]]
"'''This Machine Kills Fascists'''" is a message that [[Woody Guthrie]] placed on his guitar in 1941,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Class in America [Three Volumes]: An Encyclopedia|editor=Robert Weir|page=337|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which inspired many subsequent artists.

==Conception==
Soon after moving into a small fourth-floor walk-up apartment in Manhattan, Guthrie wrote the war song "Talking [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s Head Off Blues".  This was printed in the ''[[Daily Worker]]'' newspaper: then "In a fit of patriotism and faith in the impact of the song, he painted on his guitar THIS MACHINE KILLS FASCISTS."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=There Ain't Nobody That Can Sing Like Me: The Life of Woody Guthrie|author=Anne E. Neimark|publisher=Atheneurn Books|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guthrie's stance against fascism==
In Guthrie's opposition to [[fascism]], he conceptualized the ideology "as a form of economic exploitation similar to slavery," straightforwardly denouncing the fascists - particularly their leaders - as a group of gangsters who set out to 'rob the world'."&lt;ref name="The Life"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Life, Music and Thought of Woody Guthrie: A Critical Appraisal|author=John S. Partington|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This recalled a protest strategy he had used "during the [[Great Depression]], when social, political and economic inequality had been engendered by a small rich elite."&lt;ref name="The Life"/&gt; During that era, Guthrie had "romanticized the deeds of outlaws such as [[Jesse James]], [[Pretty Boy Floyd]], [[Calamity Jane]] or the [[Dalton Gang]] both as legitimate acts of social responsibility and as 'the ultimate expression of protest', thus transforming the outlaw into an archetypal partisan in a fight against those who were held responsible for the worsening social and economic conditions".&lt;ref name="The Life"/&gt;

In this, Guthrie cast those opposing fascism not as mere outlaws in a fascist state, but as heroes rising "in times of economic turmoil and social disintegration" to fight "a highly illegitimate criminal endeavor intended to exploit the common people."&lt;ref name="The Life"/&gt; Guthrie portrayed these characters as something larger than merely "dumb gangsters," while his lyricism also "externalized the inhuman element of fascism by describing its representatives as animals that were usually held in very low esteem and were associated with a range of bad character traits."&lt;ref name="The Life"/&gt; For example, he talked about the "Nazi Snake" that has to be countered in his song, "Talking Hitler's Head Off Blues."&lt;ref name="The Life"/&gt; Guthrie would declare "[a]nything human is anti Hitler" and in his song "You Better Get Ready" he has the figure of [[Satan]] declare that "Old [[Hell]] just ain't the same/Compared to Hitler, hell, I'm tame!"&lt;ref name="The Life"/&gt; Guthrie saw the battle against fascism as the ultimate battle of good versus evil. In a letter to "Railroad Pete" he stated "fascism and freedom are the only two sides battling...[this was the war] the world has been waiting on for twenty five million years...[which would] settle the score once and for all".&lt;ref name="The Life"/&gt;

Guthrie did celebrate the killing of fascists by Soviet sniper [[Lyudmila Pavlichenko]] in his song "Miss Pavlichenko" which includes the lines, "You lift up your sight and down comes a hun, 
and more than three hundred nazidogs fell by your gun."&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, Woody, Guthrie, Hardtravelin’ The Asch Recirdings Vol 1, Smithsonian Folkways, Washington D.C.  1998, track 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Its design and build are usually attributed to the [[Juste family|Juste brothers]]&lt;ref name="C168"&gt;Cohen (1968), p. 461&lt;/ref&gt; although the work of several other hands can be distinguished. Design for and installed at the [[Basilica of St Denis|Saint-Denis Basilica]], France, it was commissioned in 1515 in memory of [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]] (d. 1515, aged 52) and his queen [[Anne of Brittany]] (d. 1514, aged 36), probably by Louis' successor [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (reigned 1515–1547), and after years of design and intensive building was unveiled in 1531.&lt;ref&gt;Giese et al (2018), p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; 

The tomb effigy represents a break from traditional representations in this format, and as an [[Early Renaissance]] work seems, in its monumentality, influenced by classical sources, especially Roman, probably borrowed from [[Andrea Sansovino]] and contemporary [[Florence|Florentine]] sculptors.

Art historian Barbara Hochstetler Meyer describes the tomb as portraying the deceased "with a verism, poignancy, and sensitivity to nature rarely equalled in the north of Europe during the sixteenth century."&lt;ref name="hm43"&gt;Hochstetler Meyer (1982), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

Louis is shown in the interior as a gaunt, rotting and naked recumbent cadaver, his head resting on a stone pillow.&lt;ref name="C133"&gt;Cohen (1992), p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; His [[death mask]] is a remarkably realistic depiction of the recently dead: his eyes are sunken into his skull, his skin is taut, especially his neck is emaciated, and his hair is{{clarify|date=August 2018}}  &lt;ref name="hm46"&gt;Hochstetler Meyer (1982), p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

The stone slab above the tomb shows both alive and in full flesh. Louis is seated with Anne kneeling behind him; both have their hands clasped in prayer. Unusually, the king is not wearing a crown. He had suffered prolonged illness before his death, and the impact of this is made evident by his sagging skin and decrepit muscles. Nor is his age is not shied away from; he has a long curved nose, beady and alert but swollen eyes, and a double chin.&lt;ref name="hm46" /&gt; 

The arches of the tomb contains a number of groupings of seated figures, including [[apostles]] and figures representing the seven [[seven virtues|cardinal virtues]]. Beyond them, at each corner are four larger, also seated, female figures.

==History==
In 1919, UCLA's leadership demonstrated an early commitment to offer students opportunities to explore the arts by the establishment of an art gallery and a music department. But in 1939 the College of Applied Arts was founded with the addition of a Department of Art, followed by the College of Fine Arts in 1960, with degrees available in art, dance, music, and theater arts.

Following academic restructuring in the late 1980s, the [[UC Regents]] formally approved the establishment of two schools: the School of the Arts and the [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television|School of Theater, Film and Television]]. In 1994 architecture and urban design joined the School of the Arts, which became the School of the Arts and Architecture (UCLA Arts).

Brett Steele was appointed dean of the School of the Arts and Architecture in 2017.

{{nihongo|'''''Yōga'''''|洋画||literally "Western-style painting"}} is a style of [[painting]]s by Japanese artists, made in accordance with Western (European) traditional conventions, techniques and materials. The term was coined in the [[Meiji period]], to distinguish such works from indigenous traditional [[Japanese painting]]s, or {{nihongo|''[[Nihonga]]''|日本画}}.

== History ==
European painting was introduced to Japan during the late [[Muromachi period]] along with [[Christian missionaries]]. Early religious works by Japanese artists in imitation of works brought by the missionaries can be considered some of the earliest forms of ''Yōga''. However, the [[sakoku|policy of national seclusion]] introduced by the [[Tokugawa bakufu]] in the [[Edo period]] effectively ended the influence of western art on Japanese painting, with the exception of the use of [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]], which was discovered by Japanese artists in sketches found in European medical and scientific texts imported from the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] via [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]].

In 1855, the Tokugawa ''bakufu'' established the ''[[Bansho Shirabesho]],'' a translation and research institute for western studies, including a section to investigate western art. This section was headed by [[Kawakami Togai]], whose assistant [[Takahashi Yuichi]] was a student of English artist [[Charles Wirgman]]. Takahashi is regarded by many as the first true Yōga painter.

In 1876, the ''Kobu Bijutsu Gakko'' ([[Tokyo Institute of Technology|Technical Art School]]) was established by the Meiji government as Japan's first dedicated ''Yōga'' art school. [[o-yatoi gaikokujin|Foreign advisors]], such as the Italian artist [[Antonio Fontanesi]], were hired by the government to teach Japanese artists, such as [[Asai Chu]] in the latest western techniques.

In the 1880s, the general reaction against Westernization and the growth in popularity and strength of the ''[[Nihonga]]'' movement caused the temporary decline of ''Yōga''. The ''Kobu Bijutsu Gakko'' was forced to close in 1883, and when the ''Tokyo Bijutsu Gakko'' (the forerunner of the [[Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music]]) was established in 1887, only ''Nihonga'' subjects were taught.

However, in 1889, the ''Meiji Bijutsukai'' (Meiji Fine Arts Society) was established by ''Yōga'' artists, and in 1893, the return of [[Kuroda Seiki]] from his studies in Europe gave fresh impetus to the ''Yōga'' genre. From 1896, a Yōga department was added to the curriculum of the ''Tokyo Bijutsu Gakko'', and from that point onwards, ''Yōga'' has been an accepted component of Japanese painting.

Since that time, ''Yōga'' and ''Nihonga'' have been the two main divisions of modern Japanese painting. This division is reflected in education, the mounting of exhibitions, and the identification of artists. However, in many cases ''Nihonga'' artists also adopted realistic Western painting techniques, such as perspective and shading. Because of this tendency to synthesize, although ''Nihonga'' forms a distinct category within the Japanese annual ''[[Japan Art Academy|Nitten]]'' exhibitions, in recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to draw a distinct separation in either techniques or materials between ''Nihonga'' and ''Yōga''.

== Materials ==
''Yōga'' in its broadest sense encompasses [[oil painting]], [[watercolor]]s, [[pastels]], [[pen-and-ink drawing|ink sketches]], [[lithography]], [[etching]] and other techniques developed in western culture. However, in a more limited sense, ''Yōga'' is sometimes used specifically to refer to oil painting.
