      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5508">[[Rao Sahib]] '''Abraham Pandithar''' ({{lang-ta|ஆபிரகாம் பண்டிதர்}}, 2 August 1859 – 31 August 1919) was a [[Tamil people|Tamil]] [[musicologist]], composer and a traditional medicine practitioner from [[Tirunelveli]], who is celebrated for his patronage of numerous Tamil musicians and his influential studies concerning the origins and evolution of traditional Tamil music.

==Biography==
Abraham Pandithar was born in Sambavar Vadakarai near Surandai in [[Tirunelveli district]] to a Tamil [[Christian]] family, the son of Muthusamy Pandithar and Annammal of the [[Pandithar Maruthuvar caste]]. He studied at the CVES Normal Teachers Training School at [[Dindigal]] and in 1876, became a teacher in the same college. He belonged to a family of doctors and became interested in [[Siddha medicine]].

In 1879, he went to Suruli hills to research herbs growing there. There he met the [[Siddha]]r Karunandhar and became his student. After completing his studies he went to [[Tanjore]] and worked as a Tamil teacher in Lady Napier Girls School. His wife Gnanavadivu Ponnammal  was the headmistress in the same school. In 1890, he left his teaching job to do research on medicine full-time. He started a farm outside Tanjore for growing medicinal plants. He named it Karanandhapuram after his teacher. It was called as Pandithar thottam (Pandithar's farm) by the locals. He also started a clinic - the  Karunanidhi Medical Hall at his residence in Tanjore. In 1909, the colonial government awarded him the "Rao Sahib" title. In 1911, Gnanavadivu died and Pandithar married Bhagyammal.&lt;ref name=hindu1/&gt;

The publication of ''[[Silapathikaram]]'' by [[U. V. Swaminatha Iyer]] in 1892, made Pandithar interested in [[Ancient Tamil music|Tamil music]] and he started studying it. He learnt traditional music as he is part of the Navithar Community, from Sadayandi Bhattar and western classical music from Tanjore A. G. Pichaimuthu pillai. He did extensive research on the origins and form of Tamil music. He established the ''Sangeetha Vidhyalaya Mahajana Sangam'' - a music association and organised six music conferences during 1912–1914. In 1917, he published his research into Tamil music as ''Karunamirdha Sagaram'', a 1346-page book, that remains a seminal work in the field till today. He also published ''Karunamirdha Sagara Thirattu'' - a collection of Tamil practice songs (musicians of that period trained using [[Telugu language|Telugu]] songs). He also translated several ''[[Keerthana]]is'' into Tamil. He attended the All India Music Conference held at Baroda in 1916 and presented his research there.&lt;ref name=hindu1&gt;{{cite news|title=Mother of all Music Conferences|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2005/12/16/stories/2005121603150300.htm|accessdate=14 March 2011|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=16 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Renowned work of Tamil scholar lauded|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/09/01/stories/2007090160960600.htm|accessdate=14 March 2011|newspaper=The Hindu|date=1 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a prolific composer and composed several kritis in chaste ragas in praise of [[Jesus Christ]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=V.

== Death ==
Pandithar died in 1919.

== Descendants ==
His family continued his research -  His son Varaguna Pandiyan Pandithar wrote the Tamil musical research work Paanarkaivazhi and his daughter Maragathavalli Duraipandian Pandithar completed part 2 of ''Karunamirdha Sagaram''. His grandson D. A. Thanapandian Pandithar is also a musician and musicologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ஆபிரகாம் பண்டிதர்|url=http://www.tamilvu.org/courses/degree/d051/d0513/html/d0513661.htm|work=[[Tamil Virtual University]]|accessdate=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=[[Jeyamohan]]|title=தஞ்சை ஆபிரகாம் பண்டிதர்

The '''Association for Industrial Archaeology''' ('''AIA''') was established in 1973 to promote the study of [[industrial archaeology]] and to encourage improved standards of recording, research, conservation and publication. It aims to support individuals and groups involved in those objectives and to represent the interests of industrial archaeology at a national level. It is a non-profit making registered charity (No. 277511) and a company limited by guarantee, its registered office is care of the [[Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust]].

== Leadership ==
The association is currently chaired by Mark Sissons, from September 2014, Keith Falconer OBE. The president is Professor Marilyn Palmer, MA (Oxon), Ph.D. Leicester, FSA, Professor Emeritus of Industrial Archaeology, University of Leicester (University of Leicester, January 2014). Overall administration is carried out by an elected Council of Management, whilst day-to-day operations are overseen by the officers of the association.

== Activities ==
Through its council it has contacts with both traditional archaeology and with those statutory organisations responsible for recording, preserving and funding Britain's historic monuments. The council also has contacts with the International Committee for the Conservation Of Industrial Heritage (TICCIH) and, at the European level, the European Federation of Associations of Industrial and Technical Heritage (E-faith).

Since its foundation the association has gathered at an annual conference held at various locations throughout the UK and Ireland. The 2013 conference was held in [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]] with the 2014 conference planned for [[Chester]], [[England]] in September. [[Brighton]], England is the venue for 2015. Each conference occupies a weekend but is followed by several days of visits and lectures. Additionally, the association organizes a spring weekend conference open to both members and non-members.

One important function of the association is to represent the interests of industrial archaeology in the planning process. The AIA is not a Statutory Consultee itself and the association's role in the process is carried out by its Endangered Sites Officer via the Council for British Archaeology (CBA).

Thanks to a series of generous donations the AIA has been able over the last five years to make available Restoration Grants for a number of worthwhile projects. To date seventeen grants have been made, examples of which are:

*Mellor Archaeological Trust for the restoration of the Wellington wheel pit;
*The Waterways Trust for the restoration of Box Boat 337;
*The South Yorkshire Trades Historical Trust for their work on Hoylandswaine Nail Forge.

The grants are for up to £20,000 and are only for capital projects and not on-going running costs. Applicants must be non-profit organisations, trusts, charities etc. and not businesses or individuals. Full details can be found on the association's web-site, see link below.

The AIA also provides an opportunity for taking part in escorted overseas visits that explore engineering history and industrial archaeology. These visits are organized for the association by ''Heritage of Industry'' and details of current and pending visits are to be found on the association's web-site.

== Publications ==
Industrial Archaeology Review, a bi-annual peer-reviewed journal, is sent to all members whilst a quarterly newsletter, the Industrial Archaeology News, contains shorter articles, reviews and a calendar of events. Additional occasional publications include regional gazetteers for areas where annual conferences take place.

== Membership ==

The association has some 520 individual members and approximately 50 local societies and organisations affiliated to it.

==History==

===The proposal and interim council (1959–1964)===


In the late 1950s, there was an increasing focus on the global need for anthropological research into 'disappearing cultures'.&lt;ref&gt;''International Social Science Bulletin: Disappearing Cultures'', vol 9, No 3, 1957, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Paris. http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0002/000247/024733eo.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heine-Geldern, R (1959), 'The International Committee on Urgent Anthropological and Ethnological Research', ''American Anthropologist'', 61: 1076–1078. doi: 10.1525/aa.1959.61.6.02a00130&lt;/ref&gt; This trend was also emerging in Australia in the work of researchers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples,&lt;ref&gt;Berndt, RM (1959), ‘Areas of research in Aboriginal Australia which demand urgent attention’, ''Bulletin of the International Committee on Urgent Anthropological and Ethnological Research'', Vienna, vol. 2, pp 63–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strehlow, TGH (1959), ‘Anthropological and ethnological research in Australia’, ''Bulletin of the International Committee on Urgent Anthropological and Ethnological Research'', Vienna, vol 2, pp 70–5&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a proposal by [[William Wentworth (Australian politician)|W.C. Wentworth MP]] for the conception of an Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies (AIAS) in 1959.&lt;ref name="Mulvaney,2008,p58-75"&gt;Mulvaney, DJ (2008), 'WEH Stanner and the foundation of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, 1959–1964', p 58-75, in: ''An Appreciation of Difference: WEH Stanner and Aboriginal Australia'', Hinkson, Melinda and Beckett, Jeremy (eds), Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal was made as a submission to Cabinet,&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002"&gt;Bryson, Ian (2002), ‘Aborigines, film and science’, ''Bringing to Light: a history of ethnographic filmmaking at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies'', Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra, pp 9–17&lt;/ref&gt; and argued for a more comprehensive approach by the Australian Government to the recording of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and cultures.&lt;ref name="Wentworth Lecture"&gt;'Wentworth Lectures', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/news-and-events/events/special-events/wentworth-lectures, retrieved 24 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, a Cabinet sub-committee assessed the proposal&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988"&gt;Chapman, Valerie (1988), 'The Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies', ''Resources for Australian Studies in the ACT'', Biskup, Peter &amp; Goodman, Doreen (eds), Centre for Library and Information Studies, CCAE, pp194-214&lt;/ref&gt; and formed a working party at the [[Australian National University]] (ANU) to consider the viability of the proposal.  One of their first actions was to appoint [[William Edward Hanley Stanner|W.E.H. Stanner]] to organise a conference on the state of Aboriginal Studies in Australia,&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt; to be held in 1961 at the ANU.

Academics and anthropologists in the field of Aboriginal Studies attended the conference,&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt; and contributed research papers published in a conference report in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Shiels, H (ed) 1963, ''Australian Aboriginal Studies: A Symposium of Papers at 1961 Research Conference'', Oxford University Press, Melbourne&lt;/ref&gt; No Aboriginal people were present at the conference.&lt;ref name="Mulvaney,2008,p58-75" /&gt;

The Prime Minister, [[Robert Menzies]] appointed an Interim Council in 1961.  The role of the Interim Council was to plan for a national Aboriginal research organisation and establish how this organisation would interact with existing research and scientific bodies.&lt;ref name="Mulvaney,2008,p58-75" /&gt; The Interim Council was also tasked with immediately developing a programme that would identify and address urgent research needs.&lt;ref name="AIAS Details,NAA"&gt;'Australian Institute for Aboriginal Studies Agency Details', National Archives of Australia, www.naa.gov.au, retrieved 28 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Interim Council consisted of 16 members and was chaired by Deputy Vice-Chancellor of the ANU, Professor AD Trendall,&lt;ref name ="Mulvaney,2008,p58-75" /&gt; officially recognised as the first Chair of the institute now known as AIATSIS.&lt;ref name="Chairs and Principals"&gt;'Chairs and Principals of AIATSIS', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/about-us/governance-and-structure/executive/chairs-and-principals {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316112934/http://aiatsis.gov.au/about-us/governance-and-structure/executive/chairs-and-principals |date=16 March 2015 }}, retrieved 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1962, a draft constitution for the institute was submitted to the Menzies government, and rejected. The Interim Council completed a revised constitution in July 1963. Amendments to the document included the change from the title ‘director’ to ‘principal’ of the institute.

This version of the constitution would go on to form the basis for the creation of the new Australian Institute for Aboriginal Studies the following year.&lt;ref name ="Mulvaney,2008,p58-75" /&gt;

===AIAS early years (1964–1970)===
The Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies was established as a [[Statutory authority]]&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies: Independent Review', ''Final Report to the Department of Education'', May 2014, p (i), http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/about-us/review-of-aiatsis-full-report-2014.pdf, retrieved 17 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; under an Act of Parliament in June 1964.&lt;ref name="Our history"&gt;'Our history', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/about-us/our-history, retrieved 17 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Interim Council for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies Agency Details', National Archives of Australia website, www.naa.gov.au,  retrieved 28 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the Institute at that time has been described as "to record language, song, art, material culture, ceremonial life and social structure before those traditions perished in the face of European ways."&lt;ref name="antiquity.ac.uk"&gt;Mulvaney, D. J. 'Reflections', ''Antiquity'', Vol. 80, no. 308, June 2006, pp 425–434, http://antiquity.ac.uk/Ant/080/0425/ant0800425.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

This notion is also reflected in the Institute’s official functions, as recorded in the Reading of the Bill in Parliament. These were:

:(a)	to sponsor and to foster research of a scientific nature on the Australian Aborigines.

:(b)	to treat as a matter of urgency those studies for which the source materials are disappearing.

:(c)	to establish and conduct a documentation centre on the Aborigines, and a library of books, manuscripts and other relevant material, both for the use of scholars and for public education.

:(d)	to encourage co-operation with and between scholars in universities, museums, and other institutions engaged in studies of the Aborigines, and with appropriate private bodies.

:(e)	to publish and to support the publication of the results of research.

:(f)	to co-operate with appropriate bodies concerning the financing of research, the preservation of sites, and the collection of records.

:(g)	to promote as and when necessary the training of research workers.

:(h)	to establish and maintain relations with relevant international bodies.&lt;ref name="AIAS Details,NAA" /&gt;

AIAS had a twenty-two member Council, composed mainly of academics, and had a foundation membership of one hundred.&lt;ref name="Our history"/&gt; The founding Principal of the newly formed institute was [[Frederick McCarthy]],&lt;ref name="Chairs and Principals"/&gt; a professional anthropologist and graduate of Sydney University who had spent nearly 30 years working in the field.&lt;ref&gt;'Fred McCarthy: the founding principal of AIATSIS', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website, {{cite web |url=http://www.aiatsis.gov.au/corporate/mccarthy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028055915/http://www.aiatsis.gov.au/corporate/mccarthy.html |archivedate=28 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}, retrieved 28 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the AIAS provided an opportunity for greater cross-discipline interaction in fields relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies in Australia.&lt;ref name="Our history"/&gt;

The Institute’s founding principal, Fred McCarthy, was an advocate of film as an important part of research methodology as early as his tenure as curator of anthropology at the Australian Museum in Sydney in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt; This was evident in the contributions he made during his involvement in establishing the AIAS and also as its principal, in continuing to support the development of the AIAS Film Unit&lt;ref name="Bryson,Capturing a changing culture,2002"&gt;Bryson, Ian (2002), ‘Capturing a changing culture: The first phase of the Film Unit’ , ''Bringing to Light: a history of ethnographic filmmaking at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies'', Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra, p 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; and championing ethnographic film in global forums.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt;

In the early years of the AIAS, the Film Unit largely outsourced early filmmaking work to other companies,&lt;ref name="Bryson,Capturing a changing culture,2002" /&gt; or worked in collaboration with the [[Commonwealth Film Unit]] (as early as 1962).&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Australian Ethnographic Film', Australian Screen Online website, http://aso.gov.au/titles/collections/ethnographic-film-in-Australia/, retrieved 28 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; But over the next 30 years, the Film Unit would go on to produce “one of the largest assembly of ethnographic films created in the world”.&lt;ref&gt;'AIATSIS Collections: Film', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/about-collections/film, retrieved 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In keeping with the AIAS official function “to publish and to support the publication of the results of research”,&lt;ref name="AIAS Details,NAA" /&gt; a publishing arm of the Institute was established in 1964. Publishing under the name Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, the publishing arm released a range of papers and research findings, including in the fields of linguistics, demography, physical anthropology, history and musicology.&lt;ref&gt;Elkin, AP, 'The Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies: Publications', in Oceania, Vol. 41, No. 1 (Sep. 1970), pp. 52–57, https://www.jstor.org/stable/40329899, retrieved 10 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The early work of the AIAS is credited with increasing interaction between academics in different fields, as well as establishing the foundations for the extensive collections AIATSIS holds today. But before 1970, there had never been an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander member on the AIAS Council.&lt;ref name="Our history"/&gt;

===Self-determination and the Institute (1970–1989)===
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Money and other resources are in short supply for Aboriginal control of their livelihood, but not, it seems, for discussing it."'' – Eaglehawk and Crow letter, 29 March 1974&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The 1970s marked a period of change for the AIAS. This began with the appointment of the first Aboriginal member of the AIAS Council in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Jacqueline, ''A History of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies 1959 -1989: An analysis of how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people achieved control of a national research institute'', thesis submitted for the Doctor of Philosophy, Menzies Library, Australian National University, November 2011, p106&lt;/ref&gt; Phillip Roberts, an Alawa man,&lt;ref&gt;‘Indigenous Rights: Phillip Roberts’, National Museum of Australia website, http://www.nma.gov.au/indigenous/people/pagination/phillip_roberts, retrieved 10 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pilling, A. R. (1963), '‘I, the Aboriginal’, Douglas Lockwood', ''American Anthropologist'', 65: 1152–1153. doi: 10.1525/aa.1963.65.5.02a00280&lt;/ref&gt; served on the Council from September 1970 until June 1972.&lt;ref name="Lambert 2011, p106"&gt;Lambert 2011, p106&lt;/ref&gt;

This was followed in 1971 with a second Aboriginal Council member, [[Neville Bonner|Senator Neville Bonner]], who served on Council until 1974 and for a second term in the late 1970s. And again in 1972, with the appointment of [[Dick Roughsey]] to replace Phillip Roberts at the end of his term.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p128&lt;/ref&gt;

The appointment of Phillip Roberts to the Council reflected a growing pressure for an increase in Aboriginal representation within the Institute.&lt;ref name="Lambert 2011, p106"/&gt; But the move did not allay the belief held by some Aboriginal activists that the AIAS was engaging in 'tokenism' in the extent to which Aboriginal people were involved in the administration of Aboriginal Studies.&lt;ref&gt;Widders, Thompson, Bellear &amp; Watson (1974), ''Eaglehawk and Crow: an open letter concerning the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies'', 29 March, AIAS, cited in Lambert 2011, p142&lt;/ref&gt;

The changes to the Institute that would take place in the following decade were also influenced by the shifting social and political landscape in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p107&lt;/ref&gt; The Aboriginal rights movement was growing&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988" /&gt; and Aboriginal people were demanding a voice on Council, consultation with communities and an increased focus on projects relevant to the needs of Indigenous people.&lt;ref name="antiquity.ac.uk"/&gt;

In 1972, the Whitlam government was elected. Their policy of [[Self-determination of Australian Aborigines|Self-determination for Aboriginal people]] echoed calls for greater Aboriginal involvement in the administration and functions of the AIAS.&lt;ref&gt;Rolls, Mitchell &amp; Johnson, Murray, ''Historical Dictionary of Australian Aborigines'', Scarecrow Press, Maryland, 2011, p xxv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aph.gov.au"&gt;Pratt, Angela, 'Make or Break? A Background to the ATSIC Changes and the ATSIC Review', Parliament of Australia website, http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/Publications_Archive/CIB/cib0203/03cib29, retrieved 10 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The new government was also responsible for a significant boost to AIAS funding.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition"&gt;Bryson, Ian (2002), Recording culture in transition, Bringing to Light: a history of ethnographic filmmaking at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra, pp 52–73&lt;/ref&gt;

The appointment of Peter Ucko in 1972 as Principal of the AIAS has since been described as the beginning of an increase in involvement of Aboriginal people in the workings of the Institute.&lt;ref name="Peter Ucko Obituary"&gt;Shennan, Stephen, ‘Peter Ucko Obituary’, The Guardian, 9 July 2007, https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jul/09/guardianobituaries.obituaries, retrieved 10 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In his time as Principal, Ucko was responsible for implementing a policy later labelled “Aboriginalisation”, which was aimed at opening up the Institute to Aboriginal involvement and representation.&lt;ref name="Moser,1995"&gt;Moser, Stephanie, ‘The Aboriginalisation of Archaeology’, in Ucko, Peter J (ed) Theory in Archaeology: A World Perspective, Routledge, London, 1995, p152&lt;/ref&gt; This policy was influenced by a document circulated in 1974, called the Eaglehawk and Crow letter, which criticised the current model of academic research.&lt;ref&gt;Mulvaney, John (2011), Digging Up the Past, University of NSW Press, Sydney, p186&lt;/ref&gt; The letter asserted that anthropologists "should not pretend that their studies are objective when the overwhelming factor in the lives of Aborigines is our oppression by the society of which the anthropologist is, to a greater or lesser extent, a part of." Its authors called for increased participation of Aboriginal people in the running of the Institute and for greater control over commissioning and funding of research into their cultures.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Widder, T et al, ''Open Letter concerning the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, ''referred to as the "Eaglehawk and Crow letter", 29 March 1974, http://www.50yearjourney.aiatsis.gov.au/stage4/_media/eaglehawk_and_crow_letter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy and structural changes to the Institute continued throughout the 1970s.

The Aboriginal Advisory Committee was established in 1975, and consisted of the six Aboriginal members of the AIAS Council.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p164&lt;/ref&gt; Early recommendations including increased representation of Aboriginal people on committees and the AIAS Council as well as employment at the Institute.&lt;ref name="Moser,1995" /&gt; The committee was renamed in 1978, to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Advisory Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p185&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975–1976, a category of research grants for Aboriginal researchers was introduced.&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988" /&gt; The emergence of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people filling the role of ‘cultural practitioner’, travelling to the AIAS to provide advice on projects and research being undertaken, was also documented from around 1976 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p175&lt;/ref&gt;

The time Peter Ucko spent as Principal of the AIAS saw a phase of “rapid expansion”&lt;ref name="Peter Ucko Obituary" /&gt; for the Institute.

The AIAS Film Unit that had operated in Sydney until 1973 was re-established in Canberra in 1975. Prominent American-born [[ethnographic film]]maker David MacDougall was appointed as the Director of this new AIAS Film Unit. With his wife and filmmaking partner Judith, and Kim McKenzie, the Film Unit operated until 1988 when its functions were absorbed back into the Institute.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition" /&gt;

During the MacDougall/McKenzie era, a new style of ethnographic film was explored.&lt;ref name="Ethno film,ASO"&gt;'Australian Ethnographic Film', Australian Screen Online website, http://aso.gov.au/titles/collections/ethnographic-film-in-Australia/, retrieved 10 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; One that moved away from film as a scientific record in favour of telling the story of individuals lives.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition" /&gt; The filmmakers also practised a more collaborative approach to their films, and chose to use translations and subtitles to give direct access to the subjects voice and thoughts rather than the dominant ‘voice of god’ narration style.&lt;ref name="Ethno film,ASO" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacDougall, David, 'Subtitling Ethnographic Films: Archetypes into Individualities', Visual Anthropology Review, 11 (1): 83–91&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most notable films produced towards the end of this period was ''Waiting for Harry'', a prize-winning film&lt;ref&gt;‘'Waiting for Harry’', Royal Anthropological Institute website, https://www.therai.org.uk/film/volume-ii-contents/waiting-for-harry {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129024103/https://www.therai.org.uk/film/volume-ii-contents/waiting-for-harry |date=29 November 2014 }}, retrieved 11 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; directed by Kim McKenzie with [[anthropologist]] [[Les Hiatt]] and now considered to exemplify the "style of collaborative filmmaking" the Film Unit favoured in their work.&lt;ref name="Ethno film,ASO" /&gt;

The power of film to "influence opinion"&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition" /&gt; was becoming increasingly recognised and with this, the lack of representation of Aboriginal people telling their own stories. In 1978, a meeting chaired by prominent activist and academic [[Marcia Langton]] expressed these concerns, arguing for greater access to film and video in Aboriginal communities, and training in film production by the AIAS.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition" /&gt;

By the following year, the AIAS Film Unit had begun to implement a training program&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition" /&gt; and had started employing trainee Aboriginal filmmakers on productions by the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;'A Short History of Indigenous Filmmaking', Australian Screen Online website, http://aso.gov.au/titles/collections/indigenous-filmmaking/, retrieved 10 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The AIAS began presenting a biennial Wentworth Lecture in 1978, named as a tribute to [[William Wentworth (Australian politician)|W.C. Wentworth]] for his role in establishing the Institute.&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988" /&gt; The lecture is presented by prominent person with knowledge or experience relating to issues affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia today.&lt;ref name="Wentworth Lecture"/&gt;

The expansion of the Institute continued into the 1980s. The Aboriginal Studies Press began publishing the Australian Aboriginal Studies Journal in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;Australian aboriginal studies: journal of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, Deaking University Library, http://encore.deakin.edu.au/iii/encore/record/C__Rb2865270, retrieved 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; a peer-reviewed journal aimed at  “promoting high-quality research in Australian Indigenous studies.”&lt;ref name="ASJ"&gt;‘Australian Aboriginal Studies online’, Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (AIATSIS) website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/publications/australian-aboriginal-studies-journal, retrieved 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the AIAS established a task force that identified the prevailing need for further ‘Aboriginalisation’ of the Institute’s workforce. At the time, there were four Aboriginal staff members, making up around 7% of the total staff.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p280&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 1985 with the creation of the role of Aboriginal Studies Coordination Officer within the AIAS, whose responsibilities involved improving access for Aboriginal people to the research and resources of the Institute.&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988" /&gt;

The ‘After 200 Years’ project was launched in 1985, aiming to fill some of the gaps in the AIAS photographic collection; particularly images of daily life in the southern, urban parts of Australia. Aboriginal involvement in selecting subject matter, photographing and documenting the collection was a major part of the project. The three-year project culminated in the publication of a book containing hundreds of photographs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and selected by them to represent their community.&lt;ref name="After 200 Years"&gt;Taylor, Penny.

The Rock Art Protection Program (RAPP) commenced in 1986 following a request for such an initiative by the then Minister of Aboriginal Affairs [[Clyde Holding]]. The aim of the RAPP was to protect Australian Indigenous rock art. Grants were approved by the Institute to fund various projects related to rock art protection.&lt;ref&gt;Ward. Graeme K, 'The role of AIATSIS in research and protection of Australian rock art', in: ''Rock Art Research''. Vol 28, no. 1 (May 2011), p 7-16&lt;/ref&gt;

The collections were also expanding, and by 1987 the AIATSIS library encompassed the print collections, a special Bibliographic Section and the Resource Centre (which contained the Institute’s audiovisual materials).&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988" /&gt;

Between 1987 and 1989, the survival of the AIAS as an independent statutory body was tied to a proposal for a new statutory commission that would take over all aspects of the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, pp288-308&lt;/ref&gt; This commission would become the [[Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission]] (ATSIC), conceived in an Act of Parliament in 1989.&lt;ref name="aph.gov.au"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Kingsley, 'ATSIC: Origins and Issues for the Future’, A Critical Review of Public Domain Research and Other Materials, AIATSIS Research Discussion Paper # 12, 2004, p5, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/products/discussion_paper/palmerk-dp12-atsic-origins-issues-future-research.pdf, retrieved 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The AIAS would not be folded into this commission; instead it would be recreated under a new Act with a new name.&lt;ref name="Our history"/&gt;

===AIATSIS (1989–now)===
The Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) Act was passed by parliament in 1989, replacing the AIAS Act.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Act 1989, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aioaatsisa1989702/, retrieved 20 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The newly established AIATSIS had a reduced Council consisting of nine members,&lt;ref name="Our history"/&gt; with the AIATSIS Act specifying that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people hold a minimum of five of these Council positions.&lt;ref&gt;AIATSIS Act 1989, Section 12, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aioaatsisa1989702/s12.html, retrieved 17 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Guidelines for Ethical Research in Australian Indigenous Studies (GERAIS).JPG|thumb|right|The Guidelines for Ethical Research in Australian Indigenous Studies (GERAIS)]]
[[File:Chrissy Grant, Chair of the AIATSIS Research Ethics Committee, running a GERAIS workshop at AIATSIS, 2015.JPG|thumb|right|Chrissy Grant, Chair of the AIATSIS Research Ethics Committee, running a GERAIS workshop at AIATSIS, 2015]]
AIATSIS publishes the Guidelines for Ethical Research in Australian Indigenous Studies (referred to as GERAIS),&lt;ref&gt;''Guidelines for Ethical Research in Indigenous Studies'', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, Canberra, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; a document considered to be the leading ethics guidelines for conducting research in and with Indigenous communities in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Janke, Terri, ''Writing up Indigenous research: authorship, copyright and Indigenous knowledge systems'',Terri Janke and Co, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The guidelines consist of 14 principles. These principles broadly fit under the following themes:

*rights, respect and recognition
*negotiation, consultation, agreement and mutual understanding
*participation, collaboration and partnership
*benefits, outcomes and giving back
*managing research: use, storage and access, and
*reporting and compliance&lt;ref name="EthicsMedia"&gt;‘Guidelines for Ethical Research in Australian Indigenous Studies’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/ethical-research/guidelines-ethical-research-australian-indigenous-studies, retrieved 19 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The GERAIS document is required reading for researchers applying for Ethical Clearance for research sponsored by AIATSIS.&lt;ref name="EthicsApplication"&gt;‘Application process’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/ethical-research/application-process, retrieved 19 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janke, Terri, Writing up Indigenous research:  authorship, copyright and Indigenous knowledge system, Terri Janke and Co, 2009, p15&lt;/ref&gt; However, the guidelines are also intended by AIATSIS to inform all research in the field of Indigenous studies.&lt;ref name=GERAIS /&gt;

Originally published by AIATSIS in 2000, the latest version of the GERAIS document was published in 2012. This update was made to reflect legal and technological developments that had occurred since original publication. In particular, in the area of intellectual property and the rights of Indigenous people in their traditional knowledge and cultural expressions as well as progress in digitisation technologies and data and information management.&lt;ref name=GERAIS /&gt;&lt;ref name=EthicsMedia /&gt;

These changes reflect AIATSIS’ support for the importance of research projects involving appropriate ethical conduct and rights protection for both the way data is collected during research and the findings and materials generated through that research.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Michael. ''Bringing ethics up to date: a review of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies ethical guidelines''. In: Australian Aboriginal Studies. no. 2,2010, p. 10-21&lt;/ref&gt;

The GERAIS document is the first point of reference in the ethical review process researchers must undergo before AIATSIS will sponsor a research project. All research projects are reviewed by the Research Ethics Committee for approval, using the following project documents:

*an ethical clearance proposal, using the GERAIS document as a guide,
*a plain English statement to explain to participants what the project is and how it will be conducted, and
*informed consent forms, that are completed by participants of the research.&lt;ref name=EthicsApplication /&gt;

In 2013, AIATSIS was involved in the review of two [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] research ethics guidelines relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health research.&lt;ref&gt;'Evaluation of NHMRC Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Research Ethics', The Lowitja Institute website, http://www.lowitja.org.au/nhmrc-research-ethics, 20 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pictorial:''' this collection contains roughly 650,000 photographs that date from modern day as far back as the late 1800s, and more than 90% of images in the pictorial collection are unique to AIATSIS, making it the most comprehensive record of its kind relating to Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.&lt;ref&gt;‘Pictorial’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/about-collections/pictorial, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sound:''' a collection of many unique and unpublished sound recordings totalling approximately 40,000 hours of audio. The recordings represent a breadth of cultural and historical information including languages, ceremonies, music, oral histories and interviews with participants in significant events such as the 1965 Freedom Rides and Prime Minister Kevin Rudd’s Apology to the Stolen Generations.&lt;ref&gt;‘Sound’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/about-collections/sound, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisitions===
Since the establishment of the Institute in 1964, the AIATSIS collection has been developed through acquisition by donation, gift and purchase or, through materials created and collected during the work of ethnographic field researchers and filmmakers funded by the AIATSIS grants program. The collection has also been built through deposits of materials, an arrangement which permits the original owners to assign access and use conditions appropriate to the cultural information contained in the items.

AIATSIS’ approach to collection building is based on three primary criteria:

:1.	Comprehensiveness – the aim is to have the collection be as comprehensive as possible. Given limited resources, the Audiovisual Archive focuses primarily on unpublished audio and visual materials and the Library generally on published materials. Other items are collected where possible. 
:2.	Significance – items that meet this criteria are considered to make ‘a lasting contribution to worldwide knowledge’, reflect current AIATSIS research areas, valued by a particular Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community, are not well represented in other collections, have a link to AIATSIS’ own history. 
:3.	Representativeness – when resources are limited, AIATSIS will focus on collecting items that are ‘representative of a particular class of creativity, research discipline or mode of cultural production.’&lt;ref name=CDP /&gt;

===Collection management===
Once material has been acquired by AIATSIS, the Institute faces the challenges of maintaining a cultural resource collection.&lt;ref&gt;AIATSIS Act 1989, Section 5 (e)&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved through a collection management plan that involves processes of recording and cataloguing, and appropriate storage and handling to extend the life of physical items and preserving their content through format shifting.

Preservation of physical items in the collection is achieved in two key ways:

:1.	Assessment and monitoring for contaminants, such as insects and mould, as well as any potential deterioration through environmental factors or physical damage.&lt;ref name=CMP&gt;‘’AIATSIS Collection Management Plan 2013–2016’’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/about-us/collection-management-plan.pdf, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
:2.	Storage of collection items in climate-controlled vaults, to maintain their integrity and to minimise contact with deteriorating agents such as moisture and light. The Institute also follows international archiving guidelines for the storage and preservation of materials.&lt;ref&gt;‘Preservation, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/caring-collection/preservation, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
There are a wide variety of analogue photograph, tape and film formats held in the AIATSIS collection, which pose special preservation and future access risks. The age of some of these formats and materials, combined with the varying conditions in which they were stored prior to their acquisition by AIATSIS, heightens the deterioration of the media. Another preservation issue inherent in these analogue materials is the machines that can play back that particular format, as in some cases the material and the playback device are no longer manufactured. To manage these risks and maintain future access to the collection, preservation of the actual content contained in collection items is also achieved through a program of digitisation.&lt;ref name="Caring collection"&gt;‘Caring for the collection’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/caring-collection, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:An AIATSIS pictorial technician prepares a tin type photograph for scanning.jpg|thumb|An AIATSIS pictorial technician prepares a tin type photograph for scanning]]Due to the potential issues of long-term archiving and storage of digital items, the opposite process is often employed to ensure access and preservation.&lt;ref&gt;'Future Watch: Strategies for Long-Term Preservation of Electronic Records’, Gordon E.J Hoke, CRM, http://content.arma.org/IMM/May-June2012/futurewatchstrategiesforlongtermpreservation.aspx, retrieved 25 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘Electronic Records – Problem Solved?: the Victorian Electronic Records Strategy and the future of electronic record keeping in Victoria’, VALA website, http://www.vala.org.au/vala2000/2000pdf/Gib_Hea.PDF, retrieved 25 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of digital publications and manuscripts, the originals will often be printed and incorporated into the print collections as an additional preservation measure.

The AIATSIS collection holds material that is sensitive and/or secret/sacred to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.&lt;ref&gt;‘Using the collection’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/using-collection, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with its founding Act,&lt;ref&gt;AIATSIS Act, Section 41, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aioaatsisa1989702/s41.html, retrieved 23 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and as part of their collection management plan, AIATSIS adheres to strict protocols when handling and processing these sensitive items. The Institute also supports and adheres to the protocols developed by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Library, Information and Resource Network (ATSILIRN).&lt;ref name="ATSILIRN" /&gt; Restricted visual media such as photographs and printed items are stored separately to the rest of the collection and audio and moving image items are not played until any cultural requirements are checked. Restricted material must also be carefully handled during digitisation, which means that the work is carried out in secured conditions such as enclosed booths and by staff that can meet the protocols of the item being digitised.&lt;ref name="CAUP"&gt;‘AIATSIS Collection Access and Use Policy’, p 8, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/about-us/collections-access-use-policy.pdf, retrieved 12 March  2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digitisation program===
AIATSIS launched its Library Digitisation Pilot Program in 2001, before which the Library had no dedicated digitisation equipment or policies for managing digital materials. This two-year program was originally funded by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), and involved the creation of digital collections across the institution.&lt;ref name="Barbara Lewincamp 2003"/&gt;

Since then AIATSIS has continued to incorporate digitisation of the collection into its management plan,&lt;ref name=CMP /&gt; but have publicly stated that an increase in funding is required for the Institute to digitise some of the at risk formats held in the collection before those items are lost.&lt;ref&gt;Barnsley, Warren, 'AIATSIS digitisation funding welcome but still "inadequate"', '’National Indigenous Radio Service'’, 16 May 2014, http://nirs.org.au/blog/NEWS/article/33902/AIATSIS-digitisation-funding-welcome-but-still-inadequate.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raggatt, Matthew, ‘Historic indigenous collection in "severe and catastrophic state"’, ‘’The Canberra Times’’, 6 December 2014, http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/historic-indigenous-collection-in-severe-and-catastrophic-state-20141206-121hl1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Given these limitations, AIATSIS prioritises the selection of materials for digitisation using factors including significance of the item/s, the level of deterioration, cultural protocols, copyright status, and client demand.&lt;ref name=CMP /&gt;&lt;ref name="Caring collection" /&gt; One of the identified priorities of the program is to digitise and preserve all of the audiovisual collection currently on endangered magnetic tape formats by the 2025 deadline set by UNESCO.&lt;ref name=CMP /&gt;

===Access to the collection===
[[File:Library stacks at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, Canberra ACT Australia.tif|thumb|left|Library stacks showing some of the print collection available at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, in Canberra, ACT, Australia]]
The collection is housed in the AIATSIS building on Acton Peninsula and is accessible through a number of resources. The AIATSIS Library is open to the public and holds a range of printed materials including manuscripts, journals, readers in different Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages, dictionaries, published books and rare books, maps, and posters.

Access to AIATSIS' print and manuscript collections can be made through the Library's Stanner Reading Room and the film, sound and pictorial collections by appointment through the Access Unit. These physical access points are open limited hours.&lt;ref&gt;'Visiting the collection', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/using-collection/visiting-collection, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The AIATSIS Digitisation Program contributes to increased access to the collection; whether access is through on site resources, the provision of copies of materials or the sharing of the collection online. Due to increasing obsolescence of analogue formats, AIATSIS identifies digitisation as the way to preserve those items for future generations  to access.&lt;ref name=CDP /&gt; This is considered to be particularly important for facilitating “remote access by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities” as well as for access by researchers and the general public.&lt;ref name=CMP /&gt;

The AIATSIS Access Unit runs a program called Return of Material to Indigenous Communities (ROMTIC), through which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients are provided with up to twenty copies of collection materials that relate to their language group or family. This service is limited to items that have been preserved, so AIATSIS’ digitisation program has allowed an increasing number of digital items available to ROMTIC clients.&lt;ref&gt;‘Return of materials to Indigenous communities’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/using-collection/return-material-indigenous-communities, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

AIATSIS also makes the collection available through a series of online exhibitions and digitised collection material published on their website.&lt;ref&gt;‘Collections online’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/collections-onlinel{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; These showcase different themes or discrete collections of material, including:

*'''Maningrida Mirage''' – a selection of issues of the Maningrida Mirage newsletter, produced by the Maningrida community between 1969 and 1974.&lt;ref&gt;‘Maningrida Mirage’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/archive_digitised_collections/Maningrida/home.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320132131/http://aiatsis.gov.au/archive_digitised_collections/Maningrida/home.html |date=20 March 2015 }}, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to the AIATSIS collection is also dictated by legislation governing the Institute and in some instances by legal agreements outlining the terms under which collection materials can be used.

The terms for access to the AIATSIS collection are in the first instance set by the AIATSIS Act, Section 41. This section states:

:1.	"Where information or other matter has been deposited with the Institute under conditions of restricted access, the Institute or the Council shall not disclose that information or other matter except in accordance with those conditions.
:2.	The Institute or the Council shall not disclose information or other matter held by it (including information or other matter covered by subsection (1)) if that disclosure would be inconsistent with the views or sensitivities of relevant Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders."&lt;ref&gt;AIATSIS Act 1989, Section 41, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aioaatsisa1989702/s41.html, retrieved 12 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The conditions referred to in Section 41(1) of the AIATSIS Act are usually covered in the agreement that AIATSIS enters into when material is deposited. These agreements, along with the section 41(2) of the Act, can govern the way that unpublished material can be accessed and used.&lt;ref name=CAUP /&gt;

Access to and use of material in the AIATSIS collection is also subject to the terms set out in the [[Australian Copyright Act 1968|Copyright Act (1968)]].&lt;ref&gt;'Ordering collection items', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/using-collection/ordering-collection-items, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

When a donation or deposit is being made, AIATSIS requests to be made aware of any sensitive items included in the material.&lt;ref&gt;‘Donate to the collection’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/donate-collection, retrieved 12  March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The secret or sacred nature of information contained in many collection items is an important factor in access to the AIATSIS collection. To protect items of high cultural sensitivity and reflect appropriate cultural values, access to items that contain culturally sensitive information are restricted to groups or individuals who have the permission of the relevant Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community and the depositor if restrictions have been applied by them.&lt;ref&gt;‘AIATSIS Collection Access and Use Policy’, p 7, 9, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/about-us/collections-access-use-policy.pdf, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

AIATSIS also acknowledges the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] and in particular Article 31's recognition of the right of Indigenous people to "maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions."&lt;ref name=CMP /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, United Nations, 2000, http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf, retrieved 12 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these complex issues AIATSIS developed an overarching Access and Use Policy in 2014, to “manage legal and cultural rights over material while maximising accessibility.”&lt;ref&gt;AIATSIS Annual Report 2013-2014, p42, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/publications/products/aiatsis-annual-report-2013-2014, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collection resources===
Since its inception, AIATSIS has developed and maintained a range of resources to enhance discoverability of the collection.

One of the most significant of these resources is the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Biographical Index (ABI). The ABI had its beginnings in 1979 as a non-selective biographical register of names, constructed using information on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from published material in the collection. In the early years of the biographical register, it was hoped it could “provide an important record of the achievements of Aboriginal people, and be a source of pride for generations to come".&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, Laurie and Barwick, Diane. Beginning a national Aboriginal biographical register at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies. Aboriginal history. Vol. 6 pt. 2, 1982. p. 135-138&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the index continues to be updated, now containing over 70,000 records and searchable online through AIATSIS’ collection catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;‘The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Biographical Index’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/guides-and-resources/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-biographical-index, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Other resources available on site include the Perfect Pictures Database, which contains over 140,000 digitised images from the AIATSIS Photographic Collection. This database is added to as more images are digitised and only includes images that are free of secret/sacred access restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;‘Pictures database’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/about-collections/pictorial/pictures-database, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

AIATSIS also hosts or contributes to a number of online resources, aimed at facilitating access to and understanding of the collection. These include:

*'''Mura''' – this is AIATSIS’ collection catalogue, which can be searched online.&lt;ref&gt;‘Search the collection’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/using-collection/search-collection, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Trove''' – the AIATSIS collection can be searched through the National Library of Australia’s Trove.&lt;ref&gt;‘Introduction to Trove’ video, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/research-and-guides/guides-and-resources/Tutorial-Introduction-to-Trove.swf, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; AIATSIS uses this platform as a means to further enhancing discoverability of and access to its collections.&lt;ref&gt;‘’Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies: Agency resources and planned performance’’, Department of Industry and Science website, http://www.industry.gov.au/AboutUs/Budget/Documents/PortfolioBudgetStatementsAIATSIS2011-12.pdf, retrieved 23 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Thesauri''' – there are three Thesauri that AIATSIS have created and make available through their website. These relate to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages, place names and subject areas of study.&lt;ref&gt;‘AIATSIS Pathways: Gateway to the AIATSIS Thesauri’, AIATSIS website, http://www1.aiatsis.gov.au/thesaurus/language/language.asp, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Library of Congress has approved these thesauri for use in bibliographic records worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;‘Pathways thesauri’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/publications/products/pathways-thesauri, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location of the Institute==
[[File:Institute of Aboriginal Studies, Canberra 2007.JPG|thumb|The west wing of the AIATSIS building designed by [[Ashton Raggatt McDougall]], is a black replica of [[Le Corbusier]]'s iconic [[Villa Savoye]]]]

AIATSIS is located on the [[Acton Peninsula]]&lt;ref&gt;'Contact us', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/get-involved/contact-us, retrieved 18 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; in a building that was newly built for the Institute and opened in 2001. The building was officially opened by the Honourable [[William Wentworth (Australian politician)|W.C. Wentworth]] and [[Ken Colbung|Mr Ken Colbung]]. As part of the opening the [[Ngunnawal people]], the traditional owners of the land on which the AIATSIS building stands performed a [[Welcome to Country and Acknowledgement of Country|Welcome to Country]] and [[smoking ceremony]], and the Anbarra people from North Central Arnhem Land performed a friendship ceremony, known as Rom.&lt;ref name="Koori Mail building"&gt;'AIATSIS finds a home', The Koori Mail, Issue 261, Wednesday 3 October 2001, p10, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/collections-online/digitised-collections/koori-mail/koori-mail-issues&lt;/ref&gt;

The architect, [[Howard Raggatt|Howard Ragatt]] of the firm Ashton Raggatt McDougall designed the building for AIATSIS and for its neighbour on the Acton Peninsula, the [[National Museum of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;The National Museum of Australia as Danse Macabre' in Healy, C &amp; Witcomb, A (eds), South Pacific Museums: Experiments in Culture, Monash University ePress, Victoria, 2006, p191&lt;/ref&gt; The building cost $13.75 million and was funded by the Commonwealth Government’s Centenary of Federation Grants Program.&lt;ref name="Koori Mail building"/&gt;

The design of the AIATSIS building has been the subject of differing interpretations. The rear of the building has been described as a black copy of pioneer architect [[Le Corbusier]]'s 1920's [[Villa Savoye]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;'The National Museum of Australia as Danse Macabre' in Healy, C &amp; Witcomb, A (eds), South Pacific Museums: Experiments in Culture, Monash University ePress, Victoria, 2006, p198&lt;/ref&gt; The architect, Howard Raggatt, was quoted as confirming this influence&lt;ref&gt;“Letters and Fixes: NMA, AIATSIS and Consultation”, Architecture Australia website, http://architectureau.com/articles/letters-and-fixes-6/, retrieved 5 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; but has also stated that it is designed to be reminiscent of [[Sidney Nolan]]'s famous paintings of Ned Kelly.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Dimitry (ed), National Museum of Australia: Tangled Destinies, Images Publishing, Victoria, 2002, p66&lt;/ref&gt;

During design of the AIATSIS building, it was reoriented from original plans to save two [[Eucalyptus bridgesiana|Apple Box trees]] that were identified as significant to the Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Report relating to the proposed new facilities for the National Museum of Australia and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, Parliament of Australia, 1998, p64&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bernard Price Institute for Palaeontological Research (2007).jpg|thumb]]
The '''Bernard Price Institute for Palaeontological Research''' (BPI) aka the '''Evolutionary Studies Institute''' (ESI), is part of the School of Geosciences in the Faculty of Science of the [[University of the Witwatersrand]], [[Johannesburg]], South Africa. It was established in 1945. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.wits.ac.za/esi/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early aircraft detection apparatus===
In 1937, the University of the Witwatersrand established the Bernard Price Institute of Geophysical Research, named for a local industrialist and philanthropist, Dr. [[Bernard Price]] OBE, who provided the initial funding. A world-recognized authority on lightning detection and analysis, Dr. [[Basil Schonland]], was selected as the founding director. Two years later, Dr. Schonland was asked to develop an aircraft detection apparatus (later called [[radar]]) for the Defence Force. Using the institute's small but highly qualified staff, this was accomplished before the end of the year. By 1941, the radar (designated JB) was deployed around the coast, and Lt. Colonel Schonland went to England where he made major contributions to the war effort. In 1945, when the institute returned to non-military activities at the end of the war, Dr. Price provided funds in several stages to expand its activities.

===Interest in fossil collection and study===

At a public lecture given at the University of the Witwatersrand, a remarkable Scottish-born medical doctor-turned-palaeontologist, Dr [[Robert Broom]] called attention to the fact that thousands of fossils were being lost annually in South Africa because of a lack of proper facilities to collect, preserve and study them. Dr. Price was in the audience. Broom's eloquence and passion won him over and he pledged an amount of money to establish a foundation at the university dedicated to the collection, curation and research of South African fossils. 

Several years earlier, another person had fallen under the spell of Broom – a young [[James Kitching|James William Kitching]] from the small town of Graaff-Reinet in the semi-desert [[Karoo]] region of the Eastern Cape province.

Broom knew that the Karoo was rich in fossils representing the period of earth history between about 265 million and 215 million years ago, and he visited the Karoo whenever he could. It was the richness of fossils in the Karoo that had originally attracted Broom to South Africa from Scotland via Australia in the closing years of the 19th century. He initially established a medical practice in the coastal town of Port Elizabeth. But it wasn’t long before he moved his practice to the small rural town of Pearston, near Graaff-Reinet in the Karoo, specifically so that he could be near the fossil beds and could devote all his spare time to searching for fossils. During his visits to the Karoo, Broom would call on the Kitching family in the nearby village of Nieu-Bethesda and encourage them to look for fossils for his researches. The entire family became dedicated and skilful fossil collectors, but none more so than the eldest son, James. 

In later life Broom would often say that he regarded James's father, CJM ("Croonie") Kitching, as 'the greatest fossil hunter in the world' — which was high praise – but for James himself Broom reserved the label 'the greatest fossil finder in the world'. 

It therefore made sense that when Dr Price endowed the institute at Wits and asked Broom who should be appointed to go out fossil-hunting, Broom had no hesitation in recommending James Kitching. Immediately on his return from active service in Italy at the end of World War II, the 23-year-old Kitching was appointed the first and only member of staff of the fledgling institute. 

Within a week of his appointment James took a train from Johannesburg back to Graaff-Reinet in the Karoo, scene of his childhood fossil-finding successes, to begin his first official field trip on behalf of the institute. Strict war-time fuel rationing was still in force and, having secured a miserly fuel ration of only eight gallons (45 litres), James borrowed his widowed mother's gas-guzzling Buick sedan and set off into the parched plains to look for fossils. Within five months he had assembled a collection of more than 200 exquisitely preserved skulls – mostly of mammal-like reptiles. 

Dr Price was so thrilled with the spectacular success of this first official field trip that he doubled his endowment, which allowed the institute to extend its field collecting activities to include the Makapansgat Caves at the other end of the country in what was then known as the Northern Transvaal (now Limpopo Province) of South Africa. 

Interest in these caves had been sparked by the discovery of fossil-bearing cave-fill breccias of [[Plio-Pleistocene]] age during lime-mining operations in the earlier years of the 20th century, but relatively little had been done to investigate them in any systematic way. 

James was joined in this work by his brothers Ben and Scheepers, and their discovery of the fossil remains of the 'ape-man' genus Australopithecus in the Makapansgat Limeworks Deposit further roused the interest and curiosity of Professor [[Raymond Dart]], the young head of the Anatomy Department in the Medical School of the newly established University of the Witwatersrand. It was Dart who in a controversial 1925 paper had first described the ‘ape-man’, Australopithecus from lime-workings at a place called Taung in what is now the North-West Province of South Africa. 

Dart boldly suggested that the large accumulations of Plio-Pleistocene fossil bones in the exposed cave-fill at Makapansgat were the work of early human ancestors – of tool-using, tool-making ape-men of the genus Australopithecus. From this grew Dart's now largely abandoned but always controversial theory of an 'Osteodontokeratic Culture' (bone-tooth-horn culture) practised by the australopithecines. 

This work at Makapansgat began a research interest in the institute which is still actively pursued today – namely, research into 'taphonomy' — literally the 'laws of burial', or the study of the processes involved in the history of an organism from death to ultimate fossilisation and discovery. 

From those beginnings and up to his death on 24 December 2003, the fortunes of the institute and of James Kitching were inseparably intertwined. 

The spectacular success of the Kitching brothers in collecting fossils meant that the Institute in Johannesburg soon outgrew its temporary accommodation on the University campus, and in 1963 new premises were allocated in a disused student residence behind the city's agricultural show grounds just west of the main university campus. 

The increased space was, however, soon under strain again, not only because field-work under the Kitchings was continuing as productively as ever, but also because new fields of research had been added to the institute's repertoire: in 1965 the renowned palaeobotanist Dr [[Edna P. Plumstead]] and a palynologist, Dr George Hart, joined the institute from the university's Geology Department. One of Dr Plumstead's projects at the time was the analysis of plant fossils collected by the 1955–58 American Trans-Antarctic Expeditions, in the course of which she showed that sedimentary rocks of the same age in Antarctica, South Africa, South America, India and Australia contained essentially identical plant fossils. 

This was in the days before general acceptance of the theory of 'continental-drift', plate-tectonics and sea-floor spreading, but the Antarctic fossil plants were seen by a few bold souls as powerful palaeontological evidence for the objective reality of the hypothetical former 'super-continent', [[Gondwana]]. 

Barely five years after the palaeobotanical evidence was announced to the world, [[James Kitching]] himself added the voice of vertebrate fossils to this debate when he was invited to join the United States Antarctic Research Group on a visit in 1970, during which he collected vertebrate fossils identical to those he was accustomed to finding in the Karoo. 

In 1973, Kitching was awarded a PhD degree by the University of the Witwatersrand for his thirty years of intensive work on the biostratigraphy of the Karoo Supergroup in South Africa. In 1983 he was appointed Reader in Karoo Biostratigraphy by the university. In 1987, after the departure of Professor Mike Raath, the first full-time director of the institute, Professor Kitching took over the leadership of the institute which he had almost single-handedly launched four decades earlier. When he initially retired from full-time service in 1990, he handed over to another Graaff-Reineter, Professor Bruce Rubidge, who is the current director. 

Rubidge is the grandson of another old friend of Broom's from his early Karoo days, Dr Sidney H Rubidge, who owned the farm "Wellwood" just outside Graaff-Reinet, which today houses his privately assembled collection of Karoo fossils – one of the most impressive and perhaps the most important of all such collections in South Africa. 

The BPI today remains an active research and teaching institution whose small staff and their students remain dedicated to exploring the fossil treasures of the [[Karoo]] — true to the original dreams of Broom and Price.

==Journal==
The Institute publishes its own journal, ''Palaeontologia africana''. It was originally established as a 'house journal' for papers arising from research carried out in the Institute, or work based on study of specimens from the Institute's collections.

Another important role of the journal originally was to publish the Institute's Annual Report, giving a review of work done during the year and reporting on domestic matters ranging from staff news to financial matters, building developments, and statistics on students, research projects in progress and publications during the year.

The journal soon broke from its 'house journal' role and began accepting papers from people not directly associated with the Institute, provided the subject matter of the papers was relevant to the fields in which the Institute was active. That policy continues today and now the contents of any single issue of ''Palaeontologia africana'' are a blend of papers written by members of the Institute and people who are not members, but rather are colleagues affiliated through their research interests, many of them from overseas.

The first issue appeared in 1953 under the editorship of the then Honorary Scientific Director, Professor [[Sidney H. Haughton]]. Haughton served in this editorial capacity from the inception of the journal until his death in 1982 at the age of 94, advising successive directors from the great breadth and depth of his knowledge of the geology and palaeontology of South Africa and of much of the rest of the world as well.

The journal has an Editorial Panel, whose members are experts in their particular fields, to advise the editor on the acceptability of manuscripts. The editor and/or advisory panel members submit each received manuscript to independent referees for review before deciding whether or not to accept it for publication.

There have been a variety of '''Christian views on poverty and wealth'''. At one end of the spectrum is a view which casts wealth and materialism as an evil to be avoided and even combatted.  At the other end is a view which casts prosperity and well-being as a blessing from God. 

Many taking the former position address the topic in relation to the modern [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal capitalism]] that shapes the Western world. [[Americans|American]] [[theologian]] [[John B. Cobb]] has argued that the "economism that rules the West and through it much of the East" is directly opposed to traditional Christian doctrine. Cobb invokes the teaching of Jesus that "man cannot serve both God and Mammon (wealth)". He asserts that it is obvious that "Western society is organized in the service of wealth" and thus wealth has triumphed over God in the West.&lt;ref name="Cobb, Jr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eastern View of Economics |url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=3607 |first=John B. |last=Cobb, Jr. |accessdate=2011-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906075839/http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=3607 |archivedate=September 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scottish people|Scottish]] theologian Jack Mahoney has characterized the saying of Jesus in {{bibleref|Mark|10:23–27}} as having "imprinted themselves so deeply on the Christian community through the centuries that those who are well off, or even comfortably off, often feel uneasy and troubled in conscience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Companion encyclopedia of theology |first=Jack |last=Mahoney |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1995 |page=759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christians argue that a proper understanding of Christian teachings on wealth and poverty needs to take a larger view where the accumulation of wealth is not the central focus of one's life but rather a resource to foster the "good life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Church and Society: Orthodox Christian Perspectives, Past Experiences, and Modern Challenges |first=George P. |last=Liacopulos |publisher=Somerset Hall Press |year=2007 |page=88 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xxY3gfmzdwwC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=Christianity+attitudes+money+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9780977461059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[David W. Miller]] has constructed a three-part rubric which presents three prevalent attitudes among Protestants towards wealth.  According to this rubric, Protestants have variously viewed wealth as: (1) an offense to the Christian faith (2) an obstacle to faith and (3) the outcome of faith.&lt;ref name="Miller2007"&gt;Miller, David W. "Wealth Creation as Integrated with Faith: A Protestant Reflection" Muslim, Christian, and Jewish Views on the Creation of Wealth April 23–24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wealth and faith==

===Wealth as an offense to faith===

According to historian Alan S. Kahan, there is a strand of Christianity that views the wealthy man as "especially sinful". In this strand of Christianity, Kahan asserts, the day of judgment is viewed as a time when "the social order will be turned upside down and ... the poor will turn out to be the ones truly blessed."&lt;ref name=Kahan43&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind vs. money: the war between intellectuals and capitalism |first=Alan S. |last=Kahan |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2009 |page=43 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=s-o6gs82MLQC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Christianity+money+wealth+attitudes#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianity%20money%20wealth%20attitudes&amp;f=false|isbn=9781412828772 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote "Greed is a sin against God, just as all mortal sins, in as much as man condemns things eternal for the sake of temporal things."

David Miller suggests that this view is similar to that of the third century [[Manichaeanism|Manicheans]] who saw the spiritual world as being good and the material world as evil with the two being in irreconcilable conflict with each other.&lt;ref name=Miller2007 /&gt;  Thus, this strand of Christianity exhorts Christians to renounce material and worldly pleasures in order to follow Jesus.  As an example, Miller cites Jesus' injunction to his disciples to "take nothing for the journey."{{bibleref2|Mark|6:8–9}}

The [[Catholic Worker Movement]] advocate [[voluntary poverty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholicworker.org/dorothyday/daytext.cfm?TextID=150 |title=More About Holy Poverty. Which Is Voluntary Poverty. |author=[[Dorothy Day]] |date=February 1945 |work= |publisher=[[The Catholic Worker]] |accessdate=October 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= |title=A Penny a Copy: Readings from the Catholic Worker |first=Tom | last=Cornell |authorlink=Tom Cornell |first2=Robert | last2=Ellsberg|authorlink2=Robert Ellsberg |year=1995 |page=198 |publisher=Orbis Books |quote=At its deepest level voluntary poverty is a way of seeing the world and the things of the world.… The Gospels are quite clear: the rich man is told to sell all he has and give to the poor, for it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter heaven. And we are clearly instructed that 'you can not serve God and Mammon'. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christians, such as [[New Monasticism|New Monastics]], may choose to reject personal wealth and follow an [[asceticism|ascetic]] lifestyle, in part as a protest against "a church and public that embraces wealth, luxury and ostentatious power."&lt;ref name="Fahlbusch2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fahlbusch|first=Erwin|title=The Encyclopedia Of Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C5V7oyy69zgC&amp;pg=PA307|accessdate=18 June 2012|year=2005|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-2416-5|page=307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wealth as an obstacle to faith===
According to David Miller, [[Martin Luther]] viewed Mammon (or the desire for wealth) as "the most common idol on earth".  Miller cites Jesus' encounter with the rich ruler {{bibleverse|Mark|10:17–31}} as an example of wealth being an obstacle to faith.  According to Miller, it is not the rich man's wealth per se that is the obstacle but rather the man's reluctance to give up that wealth in order to follow Jesus.  Miller cites [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]'s observation in [[First Epistle to Timothy|1st Timothy]] that, “people who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction." {{bibleverse|1|Timothy|6:9}}.  Paul continues on with the observation that "the love of money is the root of all evil."
{{bibleverse|1|Timothy|6:10}}  Miller emphasizes that "it is the love of money that is the obstacle to faith, not the money itself."&lt;ref name=Miller2007 /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!" The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, "Children, how hard it is[a] to enter the kingdom of God! 25 It is easier for a camel to go through the [[Eye of a needle#Christianity|eye of a needle]] than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God." The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, "Who then can be saved?" Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kahan cites Jesus' injunction against amassing material wealth as an example that the "good [Christian] life was one of poverty and charity, storing up treasures in heaven instead of earth.&lt;ref name=Kahan43 /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. {{bibleverse|Matthew|6|19:21}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jesus counsels his followers to remove from their lives those things which cause them to sin, saying "If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than to go with two hands into hell, where the fire never goes out." {{bibleref2|Mark|9:42–49}}.  In order to remove the desire for wealth and material possessions as an obstacle to faith, some Christians have taken vows of poverty.  Christianity has a long tradition of voluntary poverty which is manifested in the form of asceticism, charity and almsgiving.&lt;ref name=WellsQuash&gt;{{cite book |title=Introducing Christian Ethics |first1=Samuel |last1=Wells |first2=Ben |last2=Quash|publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2010 |page=244 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ezy6wZJHFCoC&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=Christian+land+wealth+usury#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20land%20wealth%20usury&amp;f=false|isbn=9781405152778 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kahan argues that Christianity is unique because it sparked the beginning of a phenomenon which he calls the "Great Renunciation" in which "millions of people would renounce sex and money in God's name."&lt;ref name=Kahan43/&gt;

In [[Roman Catholicism]], poverty is one of the [[evangelical counsels]].  Pope [[Benedict XVI]] distinguishes "poverty ''chosen''" (the poverty of spirit proposed by Jesus), and "poverty ''to be fought''" (unjust and imposed poverty). He considers that the moderation implied in the former favors solidarity, and is a necessary condition so as to fight effectively to eradicate the abuse of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/2009/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20090101_world-day-peace_en.htmlWorldPeaceDayAddress2009 Homily of His Holiness Benedict XVI]&lt;/ref&gt; Certain [[religious institute]]s also take a [[vow]] of extreme poverty. For example, the [[Franciscan]] orders have traditionally foregone all individual and corporate forms of ownership.

===Wealth as an outcome of faith===
One line of Protestant thinking views the pursuit of wealth as not only acceptable but as a religious calling or duty.  This perspective is generally ascribed to [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and [[Puritan]] theologies, which view hard work and frugal lifestyles as spiritual acts in themselves.  [[John Wesley]] was a strong proponent of gaining wealth, according to his famous "Sermon 50," in which he said, "gain all you can, save all you can and give all you can."&lt;ref name=Miller2007 /&gt; It is impossible to give to charity if one is poor; John Wesley and his Methodists were noted for their consistently large contributions to charity in the form of churches, hospitals and schools.  

Included among those who view wealth as an outcome of faith are modern-day preachers and authors who propound [[prosperity theology]], teaching that God promises wealth and abundance to those who will believe in him and follow his laws. Prosperity theology (also known as the "health and wealth gospel") is a [[Christianity|Christian]] religious belief whose proponents claim the [[Bible]] teaches that financial blessing is the will of [[God in Christianity|God]] for Christians. Most teachers of prosperity theology maintain that a combination of [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], positive speech, and donations to specific Christian ministries will always cause an increase in material wealth for those who practice these actions. Prosperity theology is almost always taught in conjunction with [[continuationism]].

Prosperity theology first came to prominence in the [[United States]] during the [[Healing Revival]]s in the 1950s. Some commentators have linked the genesis of prosperity theology with the influence of the [[New Thought]] movement. It later figured prominently in the [[Word of Faith]] movement and 1980s [[televangelism]]. In the 1990s and 2000s, it became accepted by many influential leaders in the [[charismatic movement]] and has been promoted by Christian [[missionaries]] throughout the world. It has been harshly criticized by leaders of mainstream [[evangelicalism]] as a non-scriptural doctrine or as an outright [[Heresy in Christianity|heresy]].

==Precursors to Christianity==

Professor [[Cosimo Perrotta]] describes the early Christian period as one which saw "the meeting and clash of three great cultures: the Classical, the Hebrew (of the Old Testament) and the Christian." Perrotta describes the cultures as having radically different views of money and wealth.  Whereas the Hebrew culture prized material wealth, the Classical and [[Christian culture]]s either held them in contempt or preached indifference to them.  However, Perrotta points out that the motivation of the Classical and Christian cultures for their attitudes were very different and thus the logical implications of the attitudes resulted in different outcomes.&lt;ref name=Perrotta43&gt;{{cite book |title=Consumption as an Investment: The fear of goods from Hesiod to Adam Smith|first=Cosimo |last=Perrotta |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2004  |page=43 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2ogMXO-ZxbEC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Christian+attitudes+wealth+poverty#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20attitudes%20wealth%20poverty&amp;f=false|isbn=9780203694572 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish attitudes in the Old Testament===
{{further|Jewish views of poverty, wealth and charity}}

Perrotta characterizes the attitude of the Jews as expressed in the Old Testament scriptures as being "completely different from the classical view."  He points out that servile and hired work was not scorned by the Jews of the Old Testament as it was by Greco-Roman thinkers.  Instead, such work was protected by biblical commandments to pay workers on time and not to cheat them.  The poor were protected from being exploited when in debt.  Perrotta asserts that the goal of these commandments was "not only to protect the poor but also to prevent the excessive accumulation of wealth in a few hands."  In essence, the poor man is "protected by God".  However, Perrotta points out that poverty is not admired nor is it considered a positive value by the writers of the Old Testament.  The poor are protected because the weak should be protected from exploitation.&lt;ref name=Perrotta44&gt;{{cite book |title=Consumption as an Investment: The fear of goods from Hesiod to Adam Smith|first=Cosimo |last=Perrotta |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2004  |page=44 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2ogMXO-ZxbEC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=Christian+attitudes+wealth+poverty#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20attitudes%20wealth%20poverty&amp;f=false|isbn=9780203694572 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perrotta points out that material wealth is highly valued in the Old Testament; the Hebrews seek it and God promises to bless them with it if they will follow his commandments.&lt;ref name=Perrotta44 /&gt;  Joseph Francis Kelly writes that biblical writers leave no doubt that God enabled men such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Solomon to achieve wealth and that this wealth was a sign of divine favor.  However, Kelly also points out that the Old Testament insisted that the rich aid the poor.  Prophets such as Amos castigated the rich for oppressing the poor and crushing the needy.  In summary, Kelly writes that, "the Old Testament saw wealth as something good but warned the wealthy not to use their position to harm those with less.  The rich had an obligation to alleviate the sufferings of the poor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The World of the early Christians |first=Joseph Francis |last=Kelly |publisher=Liturgical Press |year=1997 |page=166 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3Pw-n3puQwsC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=%22Old+Testament%22+attitudes+poverty+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Old%20Testament%22%20attitudes%20poverty%20wealth&amp;f=false|isbn=9780814653135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament==
{{quote|''Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.''|[[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#6:20|Luke 6:20]]}}

===The Gospels===
Jesus explicitly condemns excessive love of wealth as an intrinsic evil in various passages in the Gospels, especially in Luke (Luke 16:14–15 being an especially clear example).  He also consistently warns of the danger of riches as a hindrance to favor with God; as in the [[Parable of the Sower]], where it is said:

:"And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in; it chokes the Word, which becomes unfruitful"  – Mark 4:19.

Jesus makes [[Mammon]] a personification of riches, one in opposition to God, and which claims a person's service and loyalty as God does. But Jesus rejects the possibility of dual service on our part: for, he says, no one can serve both God and Mammon.

In the story of [[Jesus and the rich young man]] the young ruler's wealth inhibits him from following Jesus and thereby attaining the Kingdom. Jesus comments on the young man's discouragement thus:

:"How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God! Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the [[eye of a needle]] than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."  Those who heard this were astonished, "Who then can be saved?", they asked.  Jesus replied, "What is impossible with man is possible with God."   – Luke 19:23–27

In the [[Sermon on the Mount]] and the [[Sermon on the Plain]], Jesus exhorts his hearers to sell their earthly goods and give to the poor, and so provide themselves with "a treasure in heaven that will never fail, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys" (Lk 12.33); and he adds "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also" (Lk 12.34).

In [[The Parable of the Rich Fool]] Jesus tells the story of a rich man who decides to rest from all his labors, saying to himself:

:"And I will say to myself 'You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.' But God spoke to him, saying 'You fool! This very night your life will be required of you. Then who will get all that you have prepared for yourself?'" – Luke 12:16–20.

And Jesus adds, "This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God" (Lk 12.21).

[[Jesus and Zacchaeus]] (Lk 19.1–10) is an example of storing up heavenly treasure, and being rich toward God. The repentant tax collector Zacchaeus not only welcomes Jesus into his house but joyfully promises to give half of his possessions to the poor, and to rebate overpayments four times over if he defrauded anyone (Lk 19.8).

Luke strongly ties the right use of riches to discipleship; and securing heavenly treasure is linked with caring for the poor, the naked and the hungry, for God is supposed to have a special interest in the poor. This theme is consistent with God's protection and care of the poor in the Old Testament.

Thus, Jesus cites the words of the prophet Isaiah (Is:61.1–2) in proclaiming his mission:

:"The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to preach the Gospel to the poor, to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord."  – Luke 4:18–19

Luke, as is well known, had a particular concern for the poor as the subjects of Jesus' compassion and ministry. In his version of the [[Beatitudes]], the poor are blessed as the inheritors of God's kingdom (Lk 6.20–23), even as the corresponding curses are pronounced to the rich (Lk 6.24–26).

God's special interest in the poor is also expressed in the theme of the eschatological "great reversal" of fortunes between the rich and the poor in [[The Magnificat]] (Lk 1.46–55):

:He has shown the might of his arm:
:and has scattered the proud, in the conceit of their hearts.
:He has pulled down the mighty from their thrones,
:and exalted the lowly.
:He has filled the hungry with good things;
:and the rich has sent empty away.
:—Luke 1:51–53

and in Jesus repeated use of the tag "many that are first shall be last, and the last shall be first" (Mt 19.30, Mt 20.16, Mk 10.31 &amp; Lk 13.30) and similar figures (Mt 23.12, Lk 14.11 &amp; Lk 18.14).

In the [[Parable of the Wedding Feast]], it is "the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame" who become God’s honored guests, while others reject the invitation because of their earthly cares and possessions (Lk 14.7–14).

===Acts of the Apostles===

Luke’s concern for the rich and the poor continues in the Acts with a greater focus on the unity of the nascent Christian communities. The two famous passages (2.43–45; 4.32–37), which have been appealed to throughout history as the “normative ideal” of the [[common ownership|community of goods]] for Christians, rather describe the extent of fellowship (koinōnia) in Jerusalem community as a part of distinctive Christian identity. Acts also portrays both positive and negative uses of wealth: those who practiced almsgiving and generosity to the poor (9.36; 10.2, 4) and those who gave priority to money over the needs of others (5.1–11; 8.14–24).

===Epistles===
For Paul, riches mainly denotes the character and activity of God and Christ – spiritual blessings and/of salvation – (e.g., Rom. 2.4; 9.23; 2 Cor. 8.9; Eph. 1.7, 18; 2.4, 7) although he occasionally refers to typical Jewish piety and Greco-Roman moral teachings of the time, such as generosity (Rom. 12.8, 13; 2 Cor. 8.2; Eph. 4.28; 1 Tim. 6.17 ) and hospitality (1 Tim. 5.10) with warnings against pride (1 Tim. 6.17) and greed (1 Cor. 5.11; 1 Tim. 3.8). 1 Tim. 6.10 seems to reflect a popular Cynic-Stoic moral teaching of
the period: “the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.” Paul’s focus of generosity is devoted to the collection for the church in Jerusalem (Gal. 2.10; 1 Cor. 16.1–4; 2 Cor 8.1 – 9.15; Rom. 15.25–31) as an important symbol of unity between Jewish and gentile believers with an appeal to material and spiritual reciprocity. It is also noteworthy that Paul's teaching in 1 Tim 6:17 implies there were rich believers in the Early Church.

A concept related to the accumlation of wealth is [[World (theology)#Christianity|Worldliness]], which is denounced by the Epistles of James and John:  "Don't you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God" (Ja 4.4). The first letter of John says, in a similar vein: "Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him” (1 Jn 2:15).

The Epistle of James also stands out for its vehement condemnation of the oppressive rich, who were presumably outsiders to the Christian community, which mainly consisted of the poor. Adopting the [[Psalter]]'s convention of the “wicked rich” and the “pious poor” and adopting its voice, James indicts the rich with the sins of hoarding wealth, fraudulently withholding wages, corruption,  pride, luxury, covetousness and murder; and denounces the folly of their actions in the face of the imminent [[Day of Judgement]].

===Revelation===
Finally, the Revelation treats earthly riches and commercial activities with great ambivalence. While Jesus exposes the true poverty of the Laodicean church’s boast of wealth (3.17–18), he presents himself as the true source and dispenser of wealth (cf. 2 Cor. 8.13–15). Later, earthly riches and businesses activities are associated with the sins of Babylon, the earthly power of evil with self-accorded glory and luxury, whose fall is imminent (18.1–24). However, the Revelations also portrays the New Jerusalem with a lavish materialistic description, made of pure gold decorated with “every kind of precious stone” (21.18–19).

==Early Christianity==
[[File:Vespiolla Apostoli 3.jpg|thumb|240px|15th-century fresco of the Apostles, [[Turin]], Italy]]
Early Christianity appears to have adopted many of the ethical themes found in the Hebrew Bible.  However, the teachings of Jesus and his apostles as presented in the New Testament exhibit an "acute sensitivity to the needs of the disadvantaged" that Frederick sees as "adding a critical edge to Christian teaching where wealth and the pursuit of economic gain are concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A companion to business ethics |first=Robert |last=Frederick |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2002 |pages=292–93 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PDXVnfyKHBIC&amp;pg=PA293&amp;dq=Christian+attitudes+business#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20attitudes%20business&amp;f=false|isbn=9781405101028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alan Kahan points to the fact that Jesus was a poor man as emblematic of "a revolution in the way poverty and wealth were viewed."&lt;ref name=Kahan44&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind vs. money: the war between intellectuals and capitalism |first=Alan S. |last=Kahan|publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2009 |page=44|url=https://books.google.com/?id=s-o6gs82MLQC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=Christianity+money+wealth+attitudes#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianity%20money%20wealth%20attitudes&amp;f=false|isbn=9781412828772 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not to say that Christian attitudes borrowed nothing from its Greco-Roman and Jewish precursors.  Kahan acknowledges that, "Christian theology absorbed those Greco-Roman attitudes towards money that complemented its own."  However, as Kahan puts it, "Never before had any god been conceived of as poor."&lt;ref name=Kahan44 /&gt;  He characterizes Christian charity as being "different in kind from the generosity praised in the classical tradition."&lt;ref name=Kahan42&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind vs. money: the war between intellectuals and capitalism |first=Alan S.|last=Kahan|publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2009 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=s-o6gs82MLQC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Christianity+money+wealth+attitudes#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianity%20money%20wealth%20attitudes&amp;f=false|isbn=9781412828772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kahan contrasts the attitudes of early Christians with those of classical thinkers such as Seneca.  The New Testament urges Christians to sell material possessions and give the money to the poor.  According to Kahan, the goal of Christian charity is equality, a notion which is absent in the Greco-Roman attitudes toward the poor.&lt;ref name=Kahan42/&gt;

Cosimo Perrotta characterizes the Christian attitude vis-a-vis poverty and work as being "much closer to the tradition of the Old Testament than to classical culture."&lt;ref name=Perrotta43 /&gt;  However, [[Irving Kristol]] suggests that Christianity's attitude towards wealth is markedly different from that of the Hebrews in the Old Testament.  Kristol asserts that traditional Judaism has no precepts that parallel the Christian assertion that it is difficult for a rich man to get into heaven.&lt;ref name=Kristol437&gt;{{cite book |title=Neoconservatism: the autobiography of an idea |first=Irving |last=Kristol |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1995 |page=437 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=S2nUuTagIw8C&amp;pg=PA437&amp;dq=Christian+attitudes+poverty#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20attitudes%20poverty&amp;f=false|isbn=9780028740218 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perrotta characterizes Christianity as not disdaining material wealth as did classical thinkers such as [[Socrates]], [[Cynicism (philosophy)|the Cynics]] and Seneca and yet not desiring it as the Old Testament writers did.&lt;ref name=Perrotta44 /&gt;

==Patristic era==

Many of the [[Church Fathers]] condemned private property and advocated the communal ownership of property as an ideal for Christians to follow.  However, they recognized early on that this was an ideal which was not practical in everyday life and viewed private property as a "necessary evil resulting from the fall of man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Outlines of economics |first1=Richard Theodore |last1=Ely |first2=Thomas Sewall |last2=Adams |first3=Max Otto |last3=Lorenz |first4=Allyn Abbott |last4=Young |publisher=Macmillan |year=1920 |page=743 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=TiYuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA743&amp;dq=Christian+fathers+attitudes+money+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
American theologian [[Robert M. Grant (theologian)|Robert Grant]] noted that, while almost all of the Church Fathers condemn the "love of money for its own sake and insist upon the positive duty of almsgiving", none of them seems to have advocated the general application of Jesus' counsel to the rich young man viz. to give away all of his worldly possessions in order to follow him.&lt;ref name=Grant49&gt;{{cite book |title=Augustus to Constantine: the rise and triumph of Christianity in the Roman world |first=Robert McQueen |last=Grant |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |year=2004 |page=49 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=d_vxEB7nT_QC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=Christian+fathers+attitudes+money+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20fathers%20attitudes%20money%20wealth&amp;f=false|isbn=9780664227722 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] urged Christians to turn away from the desire for material wealth and success.  He argued that the accumulation of wealth was not a worthy goal for Christians.

[[Clement of Alexandria]] counselled that property be used for the good of the community, he sanctioned private ownership of property and the accumulation of wealth.&lt;ref name=Rothbard&gt;{{cite book |title=An Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought |first=Murray N. |last=Rothbard |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |year=2006 |page=33 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=MCcWhLmRo-cC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=Christian+fathers+attitudes+money+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9781610164771 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lactantius]] wrote that "the ownership of property contains the material of both vices and virtues but communism [communitas] contains nothing but license for vice."&lt;ref name=Grant49 /&gt;

==Medieval Europe==
{{further|Apostolic poverty}}
By the beginning of the medieval era, the Christian paternalist ethic was "thoroughly entrenched in the culture of Western Europe."  Individualist and materialist pursuits such as greed, avarice, and the accumulation of wealth were condemned as un-Christian.&lt;ref name=Hunt10&gt;{{cite book |title=Property and Prophets: The Evolution of Economic Institutions and Ideologies  |first=E.

Madeleine Gray describes the medieval system of social welfare as one that was "organized through the church and underpinned by ideas on the spiritual value of poverty.&lt;ref name=Gray119&gt;{{cite book |title=The Protestant Reformation: belief, practice, and tradition |first=Madeleine |last=Gray |publisher=Sussex Academic Press |year=2003 |page=119 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z1qRnlLwWsgC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=Protestant+Reformation+money+wealth+poverty#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9781903900116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kahan, Christian theologians regularly condemned merchants.  For example, he cites [[Honorius of Autun]] who wrote that merchants had little chance of going to heaven whereas farmers were likely to be saved.  He further cites [[Gratian]] who wrote that "the man who buys something in order that he may gain by selling it again unchanged and as he bought it, that man is of the buyers and sellers who are cast forth from God's temple."&lt;ref name=Kahan46&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind vs. money: the war between intellectuals and capitalism |first=Alan S.|last=Kahan|publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2009 |page=46 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=s-o6gs82MLQC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=Christianity+money+wealth+attitudes#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianity%20money%20wealth%20attitudes&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the medieval era saw a change in the attitudes of Christians towards the accumulation of wealth.  [[Thomas Aquinas]] defined avarice not simply as a desire for wealth but as an ''immoderate'' desire for wealth.  Aquinas wrote that it was acceptable to have "external riches" to the extent that they were necessary for him to maintain his "condition of life".  This argued that the nobility had a right to more wealth than the peasantry.  What was unacceptable was for a person to seek to more wealth than was appropriate to one's station or aspire to a higher station in life.&lt;ref name=Kahan44 /&gt; The period saw fierce debates on [[Absolute Poverty of Christ|whether Christ owned property]].

The church evolved into the single most powerful institution in medieval Europe, more powerful than any single potentate.  The Church was so wealthy that, at one time, it owned as much as 20–30% of the land in Western Europe in an era when land was the primary form of wealth.  Over time, this wealth and power led to abuses and corruption.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Monasticism===
As early as the 6th and 7th centuries, the issue of property and move of wealth in the event of outside aggression had been addressed in monastic communities via agreements such as the [[Consensoria Monachorum]].&lt;ref name=Bishko &gt;Charles J. Bishko, "The Date and Nature of the Spanish Consensoria Monachorum", ''The American Journal of Philology'' Vol. 69, No. 4, 1948 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/290910] also at [http://libro.uca.edu/monastic/monastic2.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= power &gt;''Topographies of power in the early Middle Ages'' by Frans Theuws, Mayke De Jong, Carine van Rhijn 2001 {{ISBN|90-04-11734-2}} p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; By the eleventh century, [[Benedictine]] monasteries had become wealthy, owing to the generous donations of monarchs and nobility.  Abbots of the larger monasteries achieved international prominence.  In reaction to this wealth and power, a reform movement arose which sought a simpler, more austere monastic life in which monks worked with their hands rather than acting as landlords over serfs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Medieval panorama |first=Robert |last=Bartlett |publisher=Getty Publications |year=2001 |page=56 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DjI5t3DE00wC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=monastic+communities+Christian+medieval#v=onepage&amp;q=monastic%20communities%20Christian%20medieval&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 13th century, [[mendicant orders]] such as the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and the [[Franciscans]] departed from the practice of existing religious orders by taking vows of extreme poverty and maintaining an active presence preaching and serving the community rather than withdrawing into monasteries. [[Francis of Assisi]] viewed poverty as a key element of the [[imitation of Christ]] who was "poor at birth in the manger, poor as he lived in the world, and naked as he died on the cross".&lt;ref name= Miles160 &gt;''The Word made flesh: a history of Christian thought'' by Margaret Ruth Miles 2004 {{ISBN|978-1-4051-0846-1}} pp. 160–61&lt;/ref&gt;

The visible public commitment of the Franciscans to poverty provided to the laity a sharp contrast to the wealth and power of the Church, provoking "awkward questions".&lt;ref name="Placher1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Carl Placher|author-link=William Placher |title=Readings in the History of Christian Theology: From its beginnings to the eve of the Reformation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rya0v9bgwT8C&amp;pg=PA144|accessdate=11 October 2011|date=15 April 1988|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-24057-8|pages=144–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usury===
{{main|Usury}}

[[File:UsuryDurer.jpg|right |thumb |Of Usury, from [[Sebastian Brant|Brant's]] ''Stultifera Navis'' ([[Narrenschiff|the Ship of Fools]]); [[woodcut]] attributed to [[Albrecht Dürer]]]]

[[Usury]] originally was the charging of [[interest]] on [[loan]]s; this included charging a fee for the use of money, such as at a [[bureau de change]]. In places where interest became acceptable, usury was interest above the rate allowed by law.  Today, usury commonly is the charging of unreasonable or relatively high rates of interest.

The first of the scholastics, [[Saint Anselm of Canterbury]], led the shift in thought that labeled charging interest the same as theft. Previously usury had been seen as a lack of charity.

St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], the leading theologian of the Catholic Church, argued charging of interest is wrong because it amounts to "double charging", charging for both the thing and the use of the thing.

This did not, as some think, prevent investment. What it stipulated was that in order for the investor to share in the profit he must share the risk. In short he must be a joint-venturer. Simply to invest the money and expect it to be returned regardless of the success of the venture was to make money simply by having money and not by taking any risk or by doing any work or by any effort or sacrifice at all. This is usury. St Thomas quotes Aristotle as saying that "to live by usury is exceedingly unnatural". St Thomas allows, however, charges for actual services provided. Thus a banker or credit-lender could charge for such actual work or effort as he did carry out e.g. any fair administrative charges.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Reformation==

The rising capitalistic middle class resented the drain of their wealth to the church; in northern Europe, they supported local reformers against the corruption, rapacity and venality which they viewed as originating in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History of commerce and industry |first=Cheesman Abiah|last=Herrick |publisher=Macmillan Co. |year=1917 |page=95 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BHVMAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=medieval+Europe+Christian+church+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q=medieval%20Europe%20Christian%20church%20wealth&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calvinism===

One school of thought attributes [[Calvinism]] with setting the stage for the later development of [[capitalism]] in northern Europe. In this view, elements of Calvinism represented a revolt against the medieval condemnation of [[usury]] and, implicitly, of profit in general.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Such a connection was advanced in influential works by [[R. H. Tawney]](1880–1962) and by [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920).

Calvin criticized the use of certain passages of scripture invoked by people opposed to the charging of interest. He reinterpreted some of these passages, and suggested that others of them had been rendered irrelevant by changed conditions. He also dismissed the argument (based upon the writings of [[Aristotle]]) that it is wrong to charge interest for money because money itself is barren. He said that the walls and the roof of a house are barren, too, but it is permissible to charge someone for allowing him to use them. In the same way, money can be made fruitful.&lt;ref&gt;Calvin's position is expressed in a letter to a friend quoted in {{cite book |last = Le Van Baumer | first = Franklin, editor | title = Main Currents of Western Thought: Readings in Western Europe Intellectual History from the Middle Ages to the Present | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven |year = 1978 | isbn = 0-300-02233-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Puritanism==

For [[Puritan]]s, work was not simply arduous drudgery required to sustain life.  Joseph Conforti describes the Puritan attitude toward work as taking on "the character of a vocation — a calling through which one improved the world, redeemed time, glorified God, and followed life's pilgrimage toward salvation."&lt;ref name=Conforti42&gt;{{cite book |title=Saints and strangers: New England in British North America |first=Joseph A. |last=Conforti |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2006 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zsO6_qJ0s9UC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Puritan+%22Stewardship+of+wealth%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Puritan%20%22Stewardship%20of%20wealth%22&amp;f=false|isbn=9780801882531 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gayraud Wilmore characterizes the Puritan social ethic as focused on the "acquisition and proper stewardship of wealth as outward symbols of God's favor and the consequent salvation of the individual."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=African American religious studies: an interdisciplinary anthology |first=Gayraud S. |last=Wilmore |publisher=Duke University Press |year=1989  |page=12 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=U-9vTPu5Z6QC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Puritan+%22Stewardship+of+wealth%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Puritan%20%22Stewardship%20of%20wealth%22&amp;f=false|isbn=0822309262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Puritans were urged to be producers rather than consumers and to invest their profits to create more jobs for industrious workers who would thus be enabled to "contribute to a productive society and a vital, expansive church."  Puritans were counseled to seek sufficient comfort and economic self-sufficiency but to avoid the pursuit of luxuries or the accumulation of material wealth for its own sake.&lt;ref name=Conforti42 /&gt;

==The rise of capitalism==

In two journal articles published in 1904–05, German sociologist [[Max Weber]] propounded a thesis that Reformed (i.e., Calvinist) Protestantism had engendered the character traits and values that under-girded modern capitalism. The English translation of these articles were published in book form in 1930 as ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''. Weber argued that [[capitalism]] in northern Europe evolved because the [[Protestant]] (particularly [[Calvinism|Calvinist]]) [[Protestant work ethic|ethic]] influenced large numbers of people to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own [[Organization|enterprises]] and engaging in [[trade]] and the accumulation of [[wealth]] for investment. In other words, the [[Protestant work ethic]] was a force behind an unplanned and uncoordinated [[mass action (sociology)|mass action]] that influenced the development of [[capitalism]].

Weber's work focused scholars on the question of the uniqueness of Western civilization and the nature of its economic and social development.  Scholars have sought to explain the fact that economic growth has been much more rapid in Northern and Western Europe and its overseas offshoots than in other parts of the world including those that where the Catholic and Orthodox churches have been dominant over Protestantism.  Some have observed that explosive economic growth occurred at roughly the same time, or soon after, these areas experienced the rise of Protestant religions.  Stanley Engerman asserts that, although some scholars may argue that the two phenomena are unrelated, many would find it difficult to accept such a thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism |url=http://eh.net/node/2724 |first=Stanley L. |last=Engerman |date=2000-02-29 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Chamberlain wrote that "Christianity tends to lead to a capitalistic mode of life whenever siege conditions do not prevail... [capitalism] is not Christian in and by itself; it is merely to say that capitalism is a material by-product of the Mosaic Law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Roots of Capitalism |first=John |last=Chamberlain |year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rodney Stark]] propounds the theory that Christian rationality is the primary driver behind the success of capitalism and the Rise of the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism, and Western Success|first=Rodney|last=Stark|location=New York |publisher=Random House |year=2005 |isbn=1-4000-6228-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Q9j6OoeWqK4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Christianity+capitalism#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John B. Cobb]] argues that the "economism that rules the West and through it much of the East" is directly opposed to traditional Christian doctrine. Cobb invokes the teaching of Jesus that "man cannot serve both God and Mammon (wealth)". He asserts that it is obvious that "Western society is organized in the service of wealth" and thus wealth has triumphed over God in the West.&lt;ref name="Cobb, Jr"/&gt;

[[Social justice]] generally refers to the idea of creating a society or institution that is based on the principles of [[social equality|equality]] and solidarity, that understands and values [[human rights]], and that recognizes the dignity of every human being.&lt;ref name="EducationSocialJustice"&gt;{{cite book |title=Education and Social Justice |first1=Joseph I. |last1=Zajda |first2=S. |last2=Majhanovich |first3=V. |last3=Rust |publisher=Springer |year=2006 |isbn=1-4020-4721-5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iCZH-x9FTWoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=education+and+social+justice+zajda#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NursingEthics"&gt;{{cite book |title=Nursing ethics: across the curriculum and into practice |first1=Janie B. |last1=Butts |first2=Karen |last2=Rich |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-7637-4735-0 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DmUBBCVjW_gC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Nursing+ethics%22+Butts+Rich+Jones#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Nursing%20ethics%22%20Butts%20Rich%20Jones&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term and modern concept of "social justice" was coined by the [[Jesuit]] [[Luigi Taparelli]] in 1840 based on the teachings of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] and given further exposure in 1848 by [[Antonio Rosmini-Serbati]].&lt;ref name="EducationSocialJustice"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NursingEthics"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Battleground criminal justice by Gregg Barak, Greenwood publishing group 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-313-34040-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engineering and Social Justice By Donna Riley, Morgan and Claypool Publishers 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-59829-626-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spirituality, social justice, and language learning By David I.

It is a part of [[Catholic social teaching]], [[Social Gospel]] from Episcopalians and is one of the [[Four Pillars of the Green Party]] upheld by [[Global Greens|green parties worldwide]]. Social justice as a secular concept, distinct from religious teachings, emerged mainly in the late twentieth century, influenced primarily by philosopher [[John Rawls]]. Some tenets of social justice have been adopted by those on the [[leftist|left]] of the [[political spectrum]].

According to Kent Van Til, the view that wealth has been taken from the poor by the rich implies that the redistribution of that wealth is more a matter of restitution than of theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Poverty and Morality: Religious and Secular Perspectives |first1=William A. |last1=Galston |first2=Peter H. |last2=Hoffenberg |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010  |page=72 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=VyzuGet8080C&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=Christianity+poverty+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianity%20poverty%20wealth&amp;f=false|isbn=9781139491068 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholic social teaching===
{{main|Catholic social teaching}}

[[Catholic social teaching]] is a body of doctrine developed by the [[Catholic Church]] on matters of [[poverty]] and [[wealth]], [[economics]], [[social organization]] and the role of the [[state (polity)|state]].  Its foundations are widely considered to have been laid by Pope Leo XIII's 1891 [[encyclical|encyclical letter]] ''[[Rerum novarum]]'', which advocated economic [[distributism]] and condemned [[socialism]].

According to [[Pope Benedict XVI]], its purpose "is simply to help purify reason and to contribute, here and now, to the acknowledgment and attainment of what is just…. [The Church] has to play her part through rational argument and she has to reawaken the spiritual energy without which justice…cannot prevail and prosper",&lt;ref&gt;(Pope Benedict XVI, Deus Caritas Est, 28).&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Pope John Paul II]], its foundation "rests on the threefold cornerstones of human dignity, solidarity and subsidiarity".&lt;ref&gt;(John Paul II, 1999 Apostolic Exhortation, Ecclesia in America, 55).&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns echo elements of [[Jewish law]] and the prophetic books of the [[Old Testament]], and recall the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]] recorded in the [[New Testament]], such as his declaration that "whatever you have done for one of these least brothers of Mine, you have done for Me."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 25:40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic social teaching is distinctive in its consistent critiques of [[modernity|modern]] social and political ideologies both of the left and of the right: [[liberalism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[libertarianism]], [[capitalism]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'', § 99 ff&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fascism]], and [[Nazism]] have all been condemned, at least in their pure forms, by several popes since the late nineteenth century.

===Marxism===

Irving Kristol posits that one reason that those who are "experiencing a Christian impulse, an impulse toward the ''imitatio Christi'', would lean toward socialism ... is the attitude of Christianity toward the poor. "&lt;ref name=Kristol437 /&gt;

[[Arnold Toynbee]] characterized Communist ideology as a "Christian heresy" in the sense that it focused on a few elements of the faith to the exclusion of the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Study of History|first=Arnold |last=Toynbee |year=1961 |page=545 |quote=The Communist ideology was a Christian heresy in the sense that it had singled out several elements in Christianity and had concentrated on these to the exclusion of the rest.

Although King criticized the Soviet Marxist–Leninist Communist regime sharply, he nonetheless commented that Marx's devotion to a classless society made him almost Christian. Tragically, said King, Communist regimes created "new classes and a new lexicon of injustice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=From civil rights to human rights: Martin Luther King, Jr., and the struggle for economic justice |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2007 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=B8k6btUYR68C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Martin+Luther+King+poverty+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q=Martin%20Luther%20King%20poverty%20wealth&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian socialism===
{{main|Christian socialism}}

[[Christian socialism]] generally refers to those on the [[Christian left]] whose politics are both [[Christian]] and [[socialist]] and who see these two philosophies as being interrelated. This category can include [[Liberation theology]] and the doctrine of the [[social gospel]].

The ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' [[encyclical]] of [[Leo XIII]] (1891) was the starting point of a [[Catholic social teaching|Catholic doctrine]] on social questions that has been expanded and updated over the course of the 20th century. Despite the introduction of social thought as an object of religious thought, ''Rerum novarum'' explicitly rejects what it calls "the main tenet of socialism":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Hence, it is clear that the main tenet of socialism, community of goods, must be utterly rejected, since it only injures those whom it would seem meant to benefit, is directly contrary to the natural rights of mankind, and would introduce confusion and disorder into the commonwealth. The first and most fundamental principle, therefore, if one would undertake to alleviate the condition of the masses, must be the inviolability of private property." ''Rerum novarum'', paragraph 16.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The encyclical promotes a kind of [[corporatism]] based on [[social solidarity]] among the classes with respects for the needs and rights of all.

In the November 1914 issue of ''The Christian Socialist'', Episcopal bishop [[Franklin Spencer Spalding]] of Utah, U.S.A. stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Christian Church exists for the sole purpose of saving the human race. So far she has failed, but I think that Socialism shows her how she may succeed. It insists that men cannot be made right until the material conditions be made right. Although man cannot live by bread alone, he must have bread. Therefore the Church must destroy a system of society which inevitably creates and perpetuates unequal and unfair conditions of life. These unequal and unfair conditions have been created by competition. Therefore competition must cease and cooperation take its place."&lt;ref name="D.Berman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berman|first=David|title=Radicalism in the Mountain West 1890–1920|year=2007|publisher=University Press of Colorado|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite the explicit rejection of Socialism, in the more Catholic countries of [[Europe]] the encyclical's teaching was the inspiration that led to the formation of new [[Christian democracy|Christian-inspired Socialist parties]].  A number of Christian socialist movements and political parties throughout the world group themselves into the [[International League of Religious Socialists]]. It has member organizations in 21 countries representing 200,000 members.

Christian socialists draw parallels between what some have characterized as the [[egalitarian]] and anti-establishment message of [[Jesus]], who–according to the [[Gospel]]–spoke against the religious authorities of his time, and the egalitarian, anti-establishment, and sometimes [[anti-clerical]] message of most contemporary socialisms. Some Christian Socialists have become active [[Communism|Communists]]. This phenomenon was most common among [[missionary|missionaries]] in [[China]], the most notable being [[James Gareth Endicott]], who became supportive of the struggle of the [[Communist Party of China]] in the 1930s and 1940s.

[[Michael Moore]]'s film [[Capitalism: A Love Story]] also features a religious component where Moore examines whether or not capitalism is a [[sin]] and whether [[Jesus]] would be a capitalist,&lt;ref name="ChurchMoore"&gt;{{cite news| last=Moore|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Moore|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-moore/for-those-of-you-on-your_b_308948.html|title=For Those of You on Your Way to Church This Morning ...|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=October 4, 2009| accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to shine light on the ideological contradictions among [[Christian right#History|evangelical conservatives]] who support free market ideals.

===Liberation theology===
{{main|Liberation theology}}

[[Liberation theology]]&lt;ref&gt;In the mass media, 'Liberation Theology' can sometimes be used loosely, to refer to a wide variety of activist Christian thought. In this article the term will be used in the narrow sense outlined here.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Christian movement]] in [[political theology]] which interprets the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]] in terms of a liberation from unjust economic, political, or social conditions. It has been described by proponents as "an interpretation of Christian faith through the poor's suffering, their struggle and hope, and a critique of society and the Catholic faith and Christianity through the eyes of the poor",&lt;ref&gt;[[Phillip Berryman|Berryman, Phillip]], ''Liberation Theology: essential facts about the revolutionary movement in Latin America and beyond''(1987)&lt;/ref&gt; and by detractors as Christianized [[Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;"[David] Horowitz first describes liberation theology as 'a form of Marxised Christianity,' which has validity despite the awkward phrasing, but then he calls it a form of 'Marxist–Leninist ideology,' which is simply not true for most liberation theology..." Robert Shaffer, "[http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2007nov/shaffer.html Acceptable Bounds of Academic Discourse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904165644/http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2007nov/shaffer.html |date=2013-09-04 }}," Organization of American Historians Newsletter 35, November, 2007. URL retrieved 12 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although liberation theology has grown into an international and inter-denominational movement, it began as a movement within the [[Roman Catholic]] church in Latin America in the 1950s–1960s. Liberation theology arose principally as a moral reaction to the poverty caused by [[social injustice]] in that region. The term was coined in 1971 by the [[Peruvian]] priest [[Gustavo Gutiérrez]], who wrote one of the movement's most famous books, ''A Theology of Liberation''. Other noted exponents are [[Leonardo Boff]] of Brazil, [[Jon Sobrino]] of El Salvador, and [[Juan Luis Segundo]] of Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. McBrien,''Catholicism''(Harper Collins, 1994), chapter IV.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gustavo Gutierrez,''A Theology of Liberation'', First (Spanish) edition published in Lima, Peru, 1971; first English edition published by Orbis Books (Maryknoll, New York), 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of liberation theology within the Catholic Church diminished after proponents using Marxist concepts were admonished by the [[Holy See|Vatican]]'s [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] (CDF) in 1984 and 1986. The Vatican criticized certain strains of liberation theology – without actually identifying any particular strain – for focusing on institutional dimensions of sin to the exclusion of the individual; and for allegedly misidentifying the church hierarchy as members of the privileged class.&lt;ref name="Wojda, Paul J. 1995"&gt;Wojda, Paul J., "Liberation theology", in R.P. McBrien, ed., ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' (Harper Collins, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ancient Near East topics}}
The '''chronology of the ancient Near East''' provides a framework of dates for various events, rulers and dynasties. Individual inscriptions and texts customarily record events in terms of a succession of officials or rulers, taking forms like "in the year X of king Y". Thus by piecing together many records a [[relative dating|relative chronology]] is arrived at, relating dates in cities over a wide area. For the first millennium BC, the relative [[chronology]] can be tied to actual calendar years by identifying significant astronomical events. An inscription from the tenth year of Assyrian king [[Ashur-Dan III]] refers to an eclipse of the sun, and astronomical calculations among the range of possible dates identify the eclipse as having occurred 15 June 763 BC. The date can be corroborated with other mentions of astronomical events and a secure [[Absolute dating|absolute chronology]] established, that ties the relative chronologies into our calendar.

For the third and second millennia, the correlation is not so fixed. A key document is the [[Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa]], preserving record of astronomical observations of [[Venus]], as preserved in numerous [[cuneiform]] tablets during the reign of the  Babylonian king [[Ammisaduqa]], known to be the fourth ruler after [[Hammurabi]] in the ''relative calendar''. In the series, the conjunction of the rise of Venus with the new moon provides a fixed point, or rather three fixed points, for the conjunction is a [[Periodic function|periodic]] occurrence. Astronomical calculation can therefore fix, for example, the first dates of the reign of Hammurabi in this manner either as 1848, 1792, or 1736 BC, depending on whether the "high" (or "long"), "[[Middle chronology|middle]]" or "low (or short) chronology" is followed.

For the [[3rd millennium BC|3rd]] and [[2nd millennium BC|2nd]] millennia BC, the following periods can be distinguished:
#[[Early Bronze Age]]: A series of rulers and dynasties whose existence is based mostly on the [[Sumerian King List]] besides some that are attested [[Epigraphy|epigraphically]] (e.&amp;nbsp;g., [[En-me-barage-si]]). No absolute dates within a certainty better than a century can be assigned to this period.
#[[Middle Bronze Age|Middle]] to [[Late Bronze Age]]: Beginning with the [[Akkadian Empire]] around 2300 BC, the chronological evidence becomes internally more consistent. Essentially, for this period, a good picture can be drawn of who succeeded whom, and synchronisms between [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Levant]] and the more robust [[chronology of Ancient Egypt]] can be established. The assignment of absolute dates is a matter of dispute; the conventional ''middle chronology'' fixes the [[sack of Babylon]] at 1595 BC while the ''short chronology'' fixes it at 1531 BC.
#The [[Bronze Age collapse]]: a "Dark Age" begins with the fall of Babylonian Dynasty III (Kassite) around 1200 BC, the invasions of the [[Sea Peoples]] and the collapse of  the [[Hittite Empire]].
#[[Early Iron Age]]: around 900 BC, historical data, written records become more numerous once more, with the rise of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], enabling the certain assignment of absolute dates. Classical sources such as the [[Canon of Ptolemy]], the works of [[Berossus]] and the [[Hebrew Bible]] provide chronological support and synchronisms. An eclipse in 763 BC anchors the [[Assyria]]n list of imperial officials.

==Variant Bronze Age chronologies==
[[File:Mesopotamian Chronology 2-2011-29-03.png|thumb|Middle chronology of the main dominations]]
Due to the sparsity of sources throughout the "Dark Age", the history of the Near Eastern [[Bronze Age]]  down to the end of the [[Third Babylonian Dynasty]] is a "floating chronology". In other words, it fits together internally as a "relative chronology" but not as an "absolute chronology".

The major schools of thought on the length of the Dark Age are separated by 56 or 64 years. This is because the key source for their dates is the [[Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa]] and the visibility of Venus has a 56/64{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} year cycle. More recent work by [[Vahe Gurzadyan]] has suggested that the fundamental 8-year cycle of Venus is a better metric.&lt;ref name="ultra"&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0311035] Gurzadyan, V. G., ''On the Astronomical Records and Babylonian Chronology'', Akkadica, v 119–120 (2000), pp. 175–184.)&lt;/ref&gt; (see update in &lt;ref name="ultra1"&gt;Warburton, D.A., The Fall of Babylon in 1499: Another Update, in Akkadica, v 132, 1 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="ultra2"&gt;Warburton, D.A., A Rejoinder in favour of an Ultra-Low Chronology, Akkadica, v 134, 17 (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;) There are also some scholars who discount the validity of the Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa entirely. There have been other attempts to anchor the chronology using records of eclipses and other methods, but they are not yet widely supported. The alternative major chronologies are defined by the date of the 8th year of the reign of [[Ammisaduqa]], king of Babylon. This choice then defines the reign of [[Hammurabi]].

The ''[[middle chronology]]'' (reign of Hammurabi 1792–1750 BC) is commonly encountered in literature, and many current textbooks on the archaeology and history of the ancient Near East continue using it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhrt|first=A.|title=Ancient Near East c. 3000–330 BC |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge|page=12|location=London|isbn=0-415-16763-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Potts|first=D.

As is mentioned below, at present, there are no continuous chronologies for the Near East and a floating chronology has been developed using trees in Anatolia for the Bronze and Iron Ages.

The following table gives an overview of the competing proposals, listing some key dates and the deviation relative to the short chronology:

The chronologies of Mesopotamia, the Levant and Anatolia depend significantly on the [[chronology of Ancient Egypt]]. To the extent that there are problems  in the Egyptian chronology, these issues will be inherited in chronologies based on synchronisms with Ancient Egypt.

==Sources of chronological data==

===Inscriptional===
Thousands of cuneiform tablets have been found in an area running from Anatolia to Egypt. While many are the ancient equivalent of modern grocery receipts, these tablets, along with inscriptions on buildings and public monuments, provide the major source of chronological information for the ancient Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Cuneiform Texts and the Writing of History, Marc van de Mieroop, Routledge, 1999, {{ISBN|0-415-19532-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Underlying issues====
*State of materials
While there are some relatively pristine objects, such as you might see in the Louvre or the British Museum, the vast majority of recovered tables and inscriptions are in much worse condition. They have been broken with only portions found, intentionally defaced, and damaged by weather or the effects of being buried underground. Many tablets were not even baked in antiquity and have to be carefully handled until they are heated properly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdli.ucla.edu/pubs/cdlj/2003/cdlj2003_001.html] Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative&lt;/ref&gt;
*Provenance
The site of an item's recovery is an important piece of information for archaeologists. Unfortunately, two factors impinge on this.  First, in ancient times old materials were often reused either as building material or fill, sometimes at a great distance from the original location. Secondly, looting has been a fact of life for archaeological sites, dating at least back to Roman times. The provenance of a looted object is difficult or impossible to determine.
*Multiple versions
Over time, key documents like the [[Sumerian King List]] were repeatedly copied across the generations. As a result, there are sometimes multiple versions of a chronological source that differ from each other. It can be very hard to determine which version is correct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section2/tr211.htm] Translation of Sumerian King List&lt;/ref&gt;
*Translation
The translation of cuneiform documents is quite difficult, especially given the damaged nature of much source material. Additionally, our knowledge of the underlying languages, like Akkadian and Sumerian, have evolved over time, so a translation done now may be quite different than one done in AD 1900. The result of all this is that there can be honest disagreement what the document really says. Worse yet, many archaeological finds have not yet been published, much less translated. Those held in private collections may never be.
*Slant
Many of our important source documents, such as the Assyrian King List, are the products of government and religious establishments. They often have a built-in slant in favor of the king or god in charge. A king may even take credit for a battle or construction project of an earlier ruler. The Assyrians in particular have a literary tradition of always putting the best possible face on history. The tablets or inscriptions in question still have value, though one does have to keep the slant in mind.

====King Lists====
Keeping historical lists of rulers was traditional in the ancient Near East.

*[[Sumerian King List]]
Covers rulers of Mesopotamia from a time "before the flood" up to the fall of the Isin Dynasty. For many early city-states it is the only source of chronological data. A major problem is that many early rulers are listed with fantastically long reigns. There has been some speculation that this stems from an error transcribing from the base 60 arithmetic of the Sumerians to the decimal-based system of the later Akkadians.&lt;ref&gt;"A Mathematical Approach to Certain Dynastic Spans in the Sumerian King List," Dwight W. Young, ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'', Vol. 47, No. 2 (Apr., 1988), pp. 123–129&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Babylonian King List]]
This list deals only with the rulers of Babylon. It has been found in two versions, Babylonian King List A and Babylonian King List B. The later dynasties in the list reflect the Kassite and Sealand periods of Babylon. There is also a Babylonian King List of the Hellenistic Period which covers the later part of the 1st millennium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/k/kinglist/babylonian_hellenistic.html] Babylonian King List of the Hellenistic Period&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Assyrian King List]]
Found in multiple differing copies, this tablet lists all the kings of Assyria and their regnal lengths back into the mists of time, with the portions with reasonable data beginning at around the 14th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/k/kinglist/assyrian.html] Assyrian King List at Livius.org.&lt;/ref&gt; When combined with the various Assyrian chronicles, the Assyrian King List anchors the chronology of the 1st millennium.
*[[Waddell's chronology|Indus Valley King List]]
A list of [[Indus Valley Civilization]] kings was compiled by [[Laurence Waddell]], but it is not generally accepted or well regarded by mainstream academia.&lt;ref name="Macnaughton1932"&gt;{{cite book|author=Duncan Macnaughton|title=A scheme of Egyptian chronology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pLYrAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=27 October 2012|year=1932|publisher=Luzac &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chronicles====
Many chronicles have been recovered in the ancient Near East. Most are partial or fragmentary, but when combined with other sources, they provide a rich source of chronological data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/chron00.html |work=Livius |title=Mesopotamian Chronicles |date=21 May 2017|access-date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Synchronistic Chronicle
Found in the library of Assurbanipal in Nineveh, it records the interaction of the Assyrian and Babylonian empires, from the Assyrian point of view. While useful, the consensus is that this chronicle should not be considered reliable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/abc21/synchronistic1.html] Synchronistic Chronicle at Livius.org&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Chronicle P]]
While quite incomplete, this tablet provides the same type of information as the Assyrian Synchronistic Chronicle, but from the Babylonian point of view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/abc22/p.html] Chronicle P at Livius.org.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Royal Chronicle of Lagash
The Sumerian King List omits any mention of [[Lagash]], even though it was clearly a major power during the period covered by the list. The Royal Chronicle of Lagash appears to be an attempt to remedy that omission, listing the kings of Lagash in the form of a chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/cm/lagash.html] Royal Chronicle of Lagash at Livius.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars believe the chronicle to be either a parody of the Sumerian King List or a complete fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;Mesopotamian Chronicles,Jean-Jacques Glassner,(2004) {{ISBN|1-58983-090-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Royal inscriptions====

In general, political figures in the ancient Near East liked to take credit for public works. Temples, buildings and statues built by a ruler are likely to have some sort of inscription mentioning his name. The kings also were sure to record major deeds like battles won, titles acquired, or gods appeased in some form of public inscription. These are very useful in tracking the reign of a ruler.

====Year lists====

Unlike current calendars, most ancient calendars were based on how long the current ruler had been in power. A year might be "the 5th year in the reign of Hammurabi". As part of this, each royal year was given a title, like "the year Ur was defeated". Most often this reflected a deed of the ruler. The compilation of these years are called date lists.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdli.ucla.edu/tools/yearnames/yn_index.html] Mesopotamian Year Names&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eponym (limmu) lists====

In Assyria, a royal official or [[limmu]] was selected every year of a king's reign. Many copies of these lists have been found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/li-ln/limmu/limmu_2.html] Assyrian Eponym List 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Eponyms of the Assyrian Empire 910–612 B.C., by Alan Millard. State Archives of Assyria Studies 11, Helsinki: Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project, 1994. xvi + 153 pp., 20 plates&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally, details are not always clear-cut. There are sometimes too many or few ''limmū'' for the length of a king's reign and sometimes the different versions of the eponym list disagree on a limmu. An example is the [[Mari Eponym Chronicle]]. There is now a Assyrian Revised Eponym List which attempts to resolve some of these issues.&lt;ref&gt;Gojko Barjamovic, Thomas Hertel and Mogens T. Larsen, Ups and Downs at Kanesh: Chronology, History and Society in the Old Assyrian Period (Leiden: Nederlands Instituut voor het Nabije Oosten, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trade, diplomatic, and disbursement records====

As is often the case in archaeology, it is everyday records that give the best picture of a civilization. Cuneiform tablets were constantly moving around the ancient Near East, offering alliances (sometimes including daughters for marriage), threatening war, acting as shipping documents for mundane supplies or settling accounts receivable. Most were tossed away after use the way that we would discard unwanted receipts. Fortunately for us, tablets are durable and many are well-preserved even when used as material for wall filler in new construction.

*[[Amarna letters]]

The classic example. A number of cuneiform tablets were found at Amarna in Egypt, the city of the pharaoh [[Akhenaten]]. They were written mostly in Akkadian, the diplomatic language of the time. Several named rulers in the region including the kings of Assyria and Babylon. Assuming that the correct kings have been identified, it locks the chronology of the ancient Near East to that of Egypt, at least from the middle of the 2nd millennium.

===Classical===
Some data sources are available to us from the classical period:
*[[Berossus]]
Berossus was a Babylonian astronomer living during the Hellenistic period. He wrote a history of Babylon which has not survived to modern times. Luckily, portions of this work were preserved by other classical writers.
*Canon of Ptolemy or [[Canon of Kings]]
This book provides a list of kings starting at around 750 BC in Babylon and forward through the Persian and Roman periods, in an astronomical context. It is used to help define the chronology of the 1st millennium.
*Hebrew Bible
Not having the benefit of being written into clay and buried, the records of the Hebrews have an additional layer of time to work through in being used as a source for chronology. On the other hand, the Hebrews did live pretty much in a territory directly in the crosshairs of Babylon, Assyria, Egypt and the Hittites, giving them a front row seat to actions in the area. Mainly of use in the 1st millennium and with the Assyrian New Kingdom.

===Astronomical===
*[[Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa]]

A record of the movements of Venus during the reign of a king of the First Babylonian Dynasty. Using it, various scholars have proposed dates for the fall of Babylon based on the 56/64 year cycle of Venus.  The mentioned recent work suggesting that the fundamental 8-year cycle of Venus is a better metric, led to the proposal of an "ultra-low" chronology.&lt;ref&gt;Gurzadyan, V. G., The Venus Tablet and Refraction, ''Akkadica'', v. 124 (2003), pp. 13–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eclipses====

A number of lunar and solar eclipses have been suggested for use in dating the ancient Near East. Many suffer from the vagueness of the original tablets in showing that an actual eclipse occurred. At that point, it becomes a question of using computer models to show when a given eclipse would have been visible at a site, complicated by difficulties in modeling the slowing rotation of the earth, [[Delta T]]. One important event is the [[Assyrian eclipse|Nineveh eclipse]], found in an Assyrian limmu list q.e. "Bur-Sagale of Guzana, revolt in the city of Ashur. In the month Simanu an eclipse of the sun took place." This eclipse is considered to be solidly dated to 15 June 763 BC. Another important event is the [[Ur III]] Lunar/Solar Eclipse pair in the reign of [[Shulgi]]. Most calculations for dating using eclipses have assumed that the Venus Tablet of Ammisaduqa is a legitimate source.&lt;ref name="ultra"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Wayne A., "Ancient Astronomical Observations and Near Eastern Chronology", ''JACF'', v.3 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dendrochronology===

[[Dendrochronology]] attempts to use the variable growth pattern of trees, expressed in their rings, to build up a chronological timeline. At present, there are no continuous chronologies for the Near East. A floating chronology has been developed using trees in Anatolia for the Bronze and Iron Ages.  Until a continuous sequence is developed, the usefulness for improving the chronology of the Ancient Near East is limited.&lt;ref&gt;Anatolian tree rings and the absolute chronology of the eastern Mediterranean, 2220–718 BC Kuniholm, Peter Ian, Kromer, Bernd, Manning, Sturt W, Newton, Maryanne, et al. Nature. London: Jun 27, 1996. Vol. 381, Iss. 6585; pp. 780–783&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dendrochronological Dating in Anatolia: The Second Millennium B.C."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter I. Kuniholm, Maryanne W. Newton, Carol B. Griggs, &amp; Pamela J. Sullivan, Der Anschnitt, Anatolian Metal III, Beiheft 18, 2005, pp. 41–47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=="dendro_2016"&gt;{{cite web 
|url=http://dendro.cornell.edu/projects/aegean.php|title=Aegean Dendrochronology Project |series=Cornell Tree-Ring Laboratory |date=May 11, 2016 |access-date=February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty in tying the chronology to the modern day lies primarily in the Roman period, for which few good wood samples have been found, and many of those turn out to be imported from outside the Near East.&lt;ref name=="dendro_2016"/&gt;

===Radiocarbon dating===

As in Egypt and the eastern Mediterranean, radiocarbon dates run one or two centuries earlier than the dates proposed by archaeologists. It is not at all clear which group is right, if either.&lt;ref&gt;Recent Developments in Near Eastern Chronology and Radiocarbon Dating, Michael G. Hasel, Institute of Archaeology, Southern Adventist University, Origins Vol 56 2004, pp. 6–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of accelerator based carbon dating techniques may help clear up the issue. Another promising front is the dating of lime plaster from structures.&lt;ref&gt;New Uses for Old Laboratory techniques, Jason A. Rech, Near Eastern Archaeology, Dec. 2004; 67,4. pp. 212–219.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, radiocarbon dates from the final destruction of [[Ebla]] have been shown to definitely favour the middle chronology (with the fall of Babylon and Aleppo at c. 1595 BC), and do not seem to fall with the ultra-low chronology (same event at c. 1499 BC), although it is emphasized that this is not to be seen as a decisive argument.&lt;ref&gt;Matthiae, P. (2007). The Destruction of Old Syrian Ebla. In Matthiae, P., Pinnock, F., Nigro, L. and Peyronel, L. (eds.) ''From relative chronology to absolute chronology: The second millennium BC in Syria-Palestine.'' Contributi del Centro Linceo Interdisciplinare "Beniamino Segre" N. 117. Roma. pp. 5–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Other emerging technical dating methods include [[Rehydroxylation dating]], [[Luminescence dating]] and archeointensity dating (geomagnetic). &lt;ref name="WilsonCHH09"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Wilson | first = Moira A. | last2 = Carter | first2 = Margaret A. | last3 = Hall | first3 = Christopher | last4 = Hoff | first4 = William D. | last5 = Ince | first5 = Ceren | last6 = Wilson | first6 = Moira A. | last7 = Savage | first7 = Shaun D. | last8 = McKay | first8 = Bernard | last9 = Betts | first9 = Ian M. | title = Dating fired-clay ceramics using long-term power law rehydroxylation kinetics | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society A| volume = 465 | issue = 2108 | pages = 2407–2415 | date = 8 August 2009 | url = http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/465/2108/2407 | doi=10.1098/rspa.2009.0117| bibcode = 2009RSPSA.465.2407W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;YvesGallet et al, Possible impact of the Earth's magnetic field on the history of ancient civilizations, Earth and Planetary Science Letters, vol. 246, iss. 1–2, pp. 17-26, 15 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synchronisms===

====Egypt====
At least as far back as the reign of [[Thutmose I]], Egypt took a strong interest in the ancient Near East. At times they occupied portions of the region, a favor returned in later days by the Assyrians. Some key synchronisms:
*[[Battle of Kadesh]], involving [[Ramses II]] of Egypt (in his 5th year of reign) and [[Muwatalli II]] of the Hittite empire. Recorded by both Egyptian and Hittite records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hittites.info/history.aspx?text%3Dhistory%2FMiddle+Late+Empire.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=30 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014163832/http://www.hittites.info/history.aspx?text=history%2FMiddle+Late+Empire.htm |archivedate=14 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }} Battle of Kadesh – Hittite Perspective&lt;/ref&gt;
*Peace treaty between Ramses II of Egypt (in his 21st year of reign) and [[Hattusili III]] of the Hittites. Recorded by both Egyptian and Hittite records.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/ramses-hattusili-treaty.htm] Treaty between Egypt and the Hittite Empire&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Amenhotep III]] (Amenophis III) marries the daughter of [[Shuttarna II]] of [[Mitanni]]. There is also a record of messages from the pharaoh to [[Kadashman-Enlil I]] of Babylon in the Amarna Letter (EA1–5). Other Amarna letters link Amenhotep III to [[Burnaburiash II]] of Babylon (EA6) and [[Tushratta]] of Mitanni (EA17–29) as well.
*[[Akhenaten]] (Amenhotep IV) married the daughter of Tushratta of Mitanni (as did his father Amenhotep III), leaving a number of records on the matter. He also corresponded with [[Burna-Buriash II]] of Babylon (EA7–11, 15), and [[Ashuruballit I]] of Assyria (EA15–16)

There are problems with using Egyptian chronology. Besides some minor issues of regnal lengths and overlaps there are three long periods of poorly documented chaos in the history of ancient Egypt, the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt]], the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt]], and the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt]], whose lengths are not well understood. This means the Egyptian Chronology is actually made up of three floating chronologies.

====Indus Valley====

There is much evidence that the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappan]] civilization of the [[Indus Valley]] traded with the region. This is demonstrated by clay seals found at Ur III and in the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref&gt;Gadd, C. J. “Seals of Ancient Indian Style Found at Ur.” Proceedings of the British Academy 18 (1932): 191–210.&lt;/ref&gt; Seals and beads were also found at the site of [[Esnunna]]. &lt;ref&gt;Henri Frankfort, The Indus civilization and the Near East. Annual Bibliography of Indian Archaeology for 1932, Leyden, VI, pp. 1-12, 1934&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, if the land of [[Meluhha]] does indeed refer to the Indus Valley, then there are extensive trade records ranging from the Akkadian Empire until the Babylonian Dynasty I.

====Thera and Eastern Mediterranean====

Goods from Greece made their way into the ancient Near East, directly in Anatolia and via the island of [[Cyprus]] in the rest of the region and Egypt. A Hittite king, Tudhaliya IV, even captured Cyprus as part of an attempt to enforce a blockade of the Assyrians.&lt;ref&gt;Urbanism on Late Bronze Age Cyprus: LC II in Retrospect, Ora Negbi, Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, Feb 2005, Iss. 337; pp. 1–45&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[minoan eruption|eruption of the Thera volcano]] provides a possible time marker for the region. A large eruption, it would have sent a plume of ash directly over Anatolia and filled the sea in the area with floating pumice. This pumice appeared in Egypt, apparently via trade. Current excavations in the Levant may also add to the timeline. The exact date of the volcanic eruption has been the subject of strong debate, with dates ranging between 1628 and 1520 BC. Radiocarbon dating has placed it at between 1627&amp;nbsp;BC and 1600&amp;nbsp;BC with a 95% degree of probability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Friedrich|first=Walter L|authorlink=|author2=Kromer, B |author3=Friedrich, M |author4=Heinemeier, J |author5=Pfeiffer, T |author6=Talamo, S |title=Santorini Eruption Radiocarbon Dated to 1627–1600 B.C.|journal=Science|volume=312|issue=5773|pages=548|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|year=2006|doi=10.1126/science.1125087|id=|accessdate=10 March 2007 |pmid=16645088 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;312/5773/548}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Manning"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Manning |first=Sturt W |author2=Ramsey, CB |author3=Kutschera, W |author4=Higham, T |author5=Kromer, B |author6=Steier, P |author7=Wild, EM|title=Chronology for the Aegean Late Bronze Age 1700–1400 B.C. |journal=Science |volume=312 |issue=5773 |pages=565–569 |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|year=2006 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;312/5773/565 |doi=10.1126/science.1125682 |accessdate=10 March 2007 |pmid=16645092 |bibcode=2006Sci...312..565M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first = SW | last = Manning | contribution=Clarifying the "high" v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3946">'''Computational irreducibility''' is one of the main ideas proposed by [[Stephen Wolfram]] in his book ''[[A New Kind of Science]]''.

==The idea==
Wolfram terms the inability to shortcut a program (e.g., a [[system]]), or otherwise describe its behavior in a simple way, "computational irreducibility". The [[empiricism|empirical]] [[fact]] is that the world of simple programs contains a great diversity of [[behavior]], but, because of [[undecidable problem|undecidability]], it is impossible to [[predict]] what they will do before essentially running them. The idea demonstrates that there are occurrences where theory's predictions are effectively not possible. Wolfram states several [[phenomena]] are normally computationally irreducible.

Computational irreducibility explains observed limitations of existing mainstream science. In cases of computational irreducibility, only observation and experiment can be used. Computational irreducibility may also provide a scientifically-based resolution for [[free will]].

==Implications==

* There is no easy theory for any behavior that seems [[Complexity|complex]].
* Complex behavior features can be captured with models that have simple underlying structures.
* An overall system's behavior based on simple structures can still exhibit behavior indescribable by reasonably "simple" laws.

==Analysis==

Israeli and Goldenfeld found that some less complex systems behaved simply and predictably (thus, they allowed [[approximation]]s). However, more complex systems were still computationally irreducible and unpredictable. It is unknown what conditions would allow complex phenomena to be described simply and predictably.

{{History of art sidebar}}
'''Contemporary art''' is the [[art]] of today, produced in the second half of the 20th century or in the 21st century. Contemporary artists work in a [[globally influenced]], [[culturally diverse]], and technologically advancing world. Their art is a dynamic combination of [[Medium (arts)|materials]], methods, concepts, and subjects that continue the challenging of boundaries that was already well underway in the 20th century. Diverse and eclectic, contemporary art as a whole is distinguished by the very lack of a uniform, organising principle, ideology, or "[[-ism]]". Contemporary art is part of a cultural dialogue that concerns larger contextual frameworks such as personal and cultural identity, family, community, and nationality.

In vernacular English, ''modern'' and ''contemporary'' are [[synonym]]s, resulting in some conflation of the terms ''[[modern art]]'' and ''contemporary art'' by non-specialists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/art/education/definitions NYU Steinhardt, Department of Art and Arts Professions, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==

Some define contemporary art as art produced within "our lifetime," recognising that lifetimes and life spans vary. However, there is a recognition that this generic definition is subject to specialized limitations.&lt;ref name="Esaak"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arthistory.about.com/od/current_contemporary_art/f/what_is.htm |title=What is "Contemporary" Art? |first1=Shelley |last1=Esaak |accessdate=28 April 2013 |website=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classification of "contemporary art" as a special type of art, rather than a general adjectival phrase, goes back to the beginnings of [[Modernism]] in the English-speaking world. In [[London]], the Contemporary Art Society was founded in 1910 by the critic [[Roger Fry]] and others, as a private society for buying works of art to place in public museums.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Fry|Fry Roger]], Ed. Craufurd D. Goodwin, ''Art and the Market: Roger Fry on Commerce in Art'', 1999, University of Michigan Press, {{ISBN|0472109022}}, 9780472109029, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zb8hTlHZOb0C&amp;pg=PA57 google books]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other institutions using the term were founded in the 1930s, such as in 1938 the [[Contemporary Art Centre of South Australia|Contemporary Art Society]] of [[Adelaide]], [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;Also the Contemporary Arts Society of [[Montreal]], 1939–1948&lt;/ref&gt; and an increasing number after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 257–258&lt;/ref&gt; Many, like the [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston]] changed their names from ones using "Modern art" in this period, as Modernism became defined as a historical [[art movement]], and much "modern" art ceased to be "contemporary". The definition of what is contemporary is naturally always on the move, anchored in the present with a start date that moves forward, and the works the Contemporary Art Society bought in 1910 could no longer be described as contemporary.

Particular points that have been seen as marking a change in art styles include the end of World War II and the 1960s. There has perhaps been a lack of natural break points since the 1960s, and definitions of what constitutes "contemporary art" in the 2010s vary, and are mostly imprecise. Art from the past 20 years is very likely to be included, and definitions often include art going back to about 1970;&lt;ref&gt;Some definitions: "Art21 defines contemporary art as the work of artists who are living in the twenty-first century." [http://www.art21.org/teach/on-contemporary-art/contemporary-art-in-context Art21]&lt;/ref&gt; "the art of the late 20th and early 21st century";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/contemporary+art|title=Contemporary art - Define Contemporary art at Dictionary.com|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the art of the late 20th cent. and early 21st cent., both an outgrowth and a rejection of modern art";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/encyclopedia/entry/cntmpryart|title=Yahoo|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720124418/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/encyclopedia/entry/cntmpryart|archivedate=2013-07-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Strictly speaking, the term "contemporary art" refers to art made and produced by artists living today";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/education/teachers/classroom_resources/curricula/contemporary_art/background1.html|title=About Contemporary Art (Education at the Getty)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Art from the 1960s or [19]70s up until this very minute";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistory.about.com/od/current_contemporary_art/f/what_is.htm|title=What is Contemporary Art?|author=Shelley Esaak|website=About.com Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes further, especially in museum contexts, as museums which form a permanent collection of contemporary art inevitably find this aging. Many use the formulation "Modern and Contemporary Art", which avoids this problem.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of specializing museums include the [[Strasbourg Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art]] and [[Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art of Trento and Rovereto]]. The ''Oxford Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art'' is one of many book titles to use the phrase.&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller commercial galleries, magazines and other sources may use stricter definitions, perhaps restricting the "contemporary" to work from 2000 onwards. Artists who are still productive after a long career, and ongoing [[art movement]]s, may present a particular issue; galleries and critics are often reluctant to divide their work between the contemporary and non-contemporary.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Sociologist [[Nathalie Heinich]] draws a distinction between modern and contemporary art, describing them as two different paradigms which partially overlap historically. She found that while "[[modern art]]" challenges the conventions of [[Representation (arts)|representation]], "contemporary art" challenges the very notion of an [[artwork]].&lt;ref&gt;Heinich, Nathalie, Ed. Gallimard, ''Le paradigme de l'art contemporain : Structures d'une révolution artistique '', 2014, {{ISBN|2070139239}}, 9782070139231, [https://books.google.fr/books/about/Le_paradigme_de_l_art_contemporain_Struc.html?id=vIQICgAAQBAJ&amp;redir_esc=y google books]&lt;/ref&gt; She regards [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp]]'s ''[[Marcel Duchamp's Fountain|Fountain]]'' (which was made in the 1910s in the midst of the triumph of modern art) as the starting point of contemporary art, which gained momentum after [[World War II]] with [[Gutai group|Gutai]]'s performances, [[Yves Klein]]'s monochromes and [[Robert Rauschenberg|Rauschenberg]]'s ''[[Erased de Kooning Drawing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhclwyYYbtY Nathalie Heinich lecture "Contemporary art: an artistic revolution ?] at 'Agora des savoirs' 21th edition, 6 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
[[File:Irbid-Jordan-Nida Alhamzeh-029.jpg|alt=Irbid, Jordan, "We are Arabs. We are Humans"|thumb|Irbid, Jordan, "We are Arabs. We are Humans". '''[[Inside Out Project|Inside Out]]''' is a global participatory art project, initiated by the French photographer [[JR (artist)|JR]], an example of [[Street art]]]]
One of the difficulties many people have in approaching contemporary artwork is its diversity&amp;mdash;diversity of material, form, subject matter, and even time periods. It is "distinguished by the very lack of a uniform organizing principle, ideology, or -ism"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art21.org/learn/tools-for-teaching/on-contemporary-art/contemporary-art-in-context Contemporary Art in Context. (2016). Retrieved December 11, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; that we so often see in other, and oftentimes more familiar, art periods and movements. Broadly speaking, we see [[Modernism]] as looking at modernist principles&amp;mdash;the focus of the work is [[Self-reference|self-referential]], investigating its own materials (investigations of line, shape, color, form). Likewise, Impressionism looks at our perception of a moment through light and color as opposed to attempts at stark [[Realism (arts)|realism]] ([[Realism (art movement)|Realism]], too, is an artistic movement). Contemporary art, on the other hand, does not have one, single objective or point of view. Its view instead is unclear, perhaps reflective of the world today. It can be, therefore, contradictory, confusing, and open-ended. There are, however, a number of common themes that have appeared in contemporary works. While these are not exhaustive, notable themes include: [[identity politics]], the body, [[globalization]] and migration, [[technology]], contemporary society and culture, time and memory, and institutional and political critique.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, J., &amp; McDaniel, C. (2012). ''Themes of Contemporary Art: Visual Art after 1980'' (3rd ed.). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Postmodernism|Post-modern]], [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]], [[Feminist theory|feminist]], and [[Marxist Theory|Marxist theory]] have played important roles in the development of contemporary theories of art.

==Institutions==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2018}}
[[File:MOCA North Miami.jpg|thumb|The [[Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in [[Miami, Florida]].]]
The functioning of the art world is dependent on art institutions, ranging from major museums to private galleries, non-profit spaces, art schools and publishers, and the practices of individual artists, curators, writers, collectors, and philanthropists. A major division in the art world is between the for-profit and non-profit sectors, although in recent years the boundaries between for-profit private and non-profit public institutions have become increasingly blurred.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Most well-known contemporary art is exhibited by professional artists at commercial [[Contemporary art gallery|contemporary art galleries]], by private collectors, art auctions, corporations, publicly funded arts organizations, [[contemporary art museums]] or by artists themselves in [[artist-run space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/market/art-language-philippe-meaille-french-chateau-310458|title=Largest Art &amp; Language Collection Finds Home - artnet News|date=2015-06-23|work=artnet News|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary artists are supported by grants, awards, and prizes as well as by direct sales of their work. Career artists train at [[art school]] or emerge from other fields.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

[[File:Château de Montsoreau Val de Loire.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Château de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art]] in [[Montsoreau]], [[France]].]]
There are close relationships between publicly funded contemporary art organizations and the commercial sector. For instance, in 2005 the book ''Understanding International Art Markets and Management'' reported that in Britain a handful of dealers represented the artists featured in leading publicly funded contemporary art museums.&lt;ref&gt;Derrick Chong in Iain Robertson, ''Understanding International Art Markets And Management'', Routledge, 2005, p95. {{ISBN|0-415-33956-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporations have also integrated themselves into the contemporary [[art world]], exhibiting contemporary art within their premises, organizing and sponsoring contemporary art awards, and building up extensive corporate collections.&lt;ref&gt;Chin-Tao Wu, ''Privatising Culture: Corporate Art Intervention Since the 1980s'', Verso, 2002, p14. {{ISBN|1-85984-472-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate advertisers frequently use the prestige associated with contemporary art and [[coolhunting]] to draw the attention of consumers to [[luxury goods]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The institutions of art have been criticized for regulating what is designated as contemporary art. [[Outsider art]], for instance, is literally contemporary art, in that it is produced in the present day. However, one critic has argued it is not considered so because the artists are self-taught and are thus assumed to be working outside of an art historical context.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Alan Fine, ''Everyday Genius: Self-Taught Art and the Culture of Authenticity'', University of Chicago Press, 2004, pp42-43. {{ISBN|0-226-24950-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craft activities, such as textile design, are also excluded from the realm of contemporary art, despite large audiences for exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Dormer, ''The Culture of Craft: Status and Future'', Manchester University Press, 1996, p175. {{ISBN|0-7190-4618-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art critic Peter Timms has said that attention is drawn to the way that craft objects must subscribe to particular values in order to be admitted to the realm of contemporary art. "A ceramic object that is intended as a subversive comment on the nature of beauty is more likely to fit the definition of contemporary art than one that is simply beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Timms, ''What's Wrong with Contemporary Art?'', UNSW Press, 2004, p17. {{ISBN|0-86840-407-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At any one time a particular place or group of artists can have a strong influence on subsequent contemporary art. For instance, The [[Ferus Gallery]] was a commercial gallery in Los Angeles and re-invigorated the Californian contemporary art scene in the late fifties and the sixties.

==Public attitudes==
Contemporary art can sometimes seem at odds with a public that does not feel that art and its institutions share its values.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Jane Jacob]] and Michael Brenson, ''Conversations at the Castle: Changing Audiences and Contemporary Art'', MIT Press, 1998, p30. {{ISBN|0-262-10072-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, in the 1990s, contemporary art became a part of popular culture, with artists becoming stars, but this did not lead to a hoped-for "cultural utopia".&lt;ref&gt;Julian Stallabrass, ''High Art Lite: British Art in the 1990s'', Verso, 1999, pp1-2. {{ISBN|1-85984-721-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics like [[Julian Spalding]] and [[Donald Kuspit]] have suggested that skepticism, even rejection, is a legitimate and reasonable response to much contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;Spalding, Julian, ''The Eclipse of Art: Tackling the Crisis in Art Today'', Prestel Publishing, 2003. {{ISBN|3-7913-2881-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Ashbee in an essay called "Art Bollocks" criticizes "much installation art, photography, conceptual art, video and other practices generally called post-modern" as being too dependent on verbal explanations in the form of theoretical discourse.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipod.org.uk/reality/art_bollocks.asp |title=Art Bollocks |publisher=Ipod.org.uk |date=1990-05-05 |accessdate=2011-08-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716210004/http://www.ipod.org.uk/reality/art_bollocks.asp |archivedate=16 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the acceptance of non traditional art in museums has increased due to changing perspectives on what constitutes an art piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-arthistory/chapter/what-is-art/|title=What is Art? {{!}} Boundless Art History|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concerns==
{{Main|Classificatory disputes about art}}
A common concern since the early part of the 20th century has been the question of what constitutes art. In the contemporary period (1950 to now), the concept of [[avant-garde]]&lt;ref&gt;Fred Orton &amp; [[Griselda Pollock]], ''Avant-Gardes and Partisans Reviewed''. Manchester University, 1996. {{ISBN|0-7190-4399-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; may come into play in determining what art is noticed by galleries, museums, and collectors.

The concerns of contemporary art come in for criticism too. [[Andrea Rosen Gallery|Andrea Rosen]] has said that some contemporary painters "have absolutely no idea of what it means to be a contemporary artist" and that they "are in it for all the wrong reasons."&lt;ref name="NYT00"&gt;Haas, Nancy (2000-03-05), "Stirring Up the Art World Again". ''The New York Times'', [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E4DB1638F936A35750C0A9669C8B63&amp;fta=y].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic background==
His academic background includes different universities, such as Universidad Católica de Chile and Université Catholique de Louvain, where he got his training; Universidad Academia de Humanismo Cristiano and Universidad de Santiago de Chile, where he has worked preferentially.

During his academic career he has contributed to the sociology of religion and culture, publishing various works in this field of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blasi|first1=Anthony|title=Sociology of Religion Searchable Bibliographic Database|url=http://www.thearda.com/rrh/resources/citations.asp?searchterms=cristi%E1n+parker&amp;incTitle=T&amp;incAuthor=T&amp;incAnnotation=T&amp;incPubInfo=T&amp;incBooks=T&amp;incPublications=T&amp;incTheses=T&amp;incDissertations=T&amp;pubStartYear=&amp;pubEndYear=&amp;p=Z&amp;c=ZABCDEF&amp;m=50&amp;sf=Citations&amp;t=Search+Citations&amp;pg=citations.asp|website=Association of Religion Data Archives|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 he published a book on popular religions and modernization in Latin America, under the title “Otra Lógica en América Latina, Religión popular y modernización capitalista”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parker|first1=Cristián|title=Otra Lógica en América Latina, Religión popular y modernización capitalista|date=1996|publisher=Fondo de Cultura Económica|location=Santiago y México|isbn=9567083088|pages=407}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has authored or coautored 22 books and 81 book chapters and 91 publications in scientific journals; he has also given conferences in no less than 15 Chilean universities and in 30 universities in America, Europe and Asia (258 presentations or conferences).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parker|first1=Cristián|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=http://media.wix.com/ugd/c6b930_d8da955aeffc4ae9bfcdc1b4fcff1727.pdf|website=Parker Sociologo|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been Director of the School of Sociology, Dean of Social Science (1989-1995) at the [[Universidad Academia de Humanismo Cristiano]], and then he was Vice-president of Research and Development (2002-2003) and Director of the  [[:es:Instituto de Estudios Avanzados (Universidad de Santiago de Chile)|Institute for Advanced Studies]] of the Universidad de Santiago de Chile (2005- 2010).
He has been a consultant for [[UNICEF]], [[UNDP]], [[ECLAC]], FLACSO-Ecuador, and various public agencies in Chile, among them ministries of Education, of Development and Justice. In addition he has lectured in Research Methodology in the Academia Diplomática de Chile (2004-2012) and the Master's program in Military History and Strategic Thought of the War Academy of the Chilean Army (2004-2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parker|first1=Cristián|title=Bio / CV|url=http://www.parkersociologo.com/|website=Parker Sociologo|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions to Sociology==
It has been stated &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cipriani|first1=Roberto|title=Manual de Sociología de la Religión|date=2011|publisher=Siglo Veintiuno Editores|location=Buenos Aires|isbn=978-987-629-194-1|page=365}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that the work of C. Parker enables a complete knowledge of popular culture with an empathic and participative approach on the “culture of the poor”. His contribution to the sociology of religion, underscoring its cultural character, rich in creativity, has led to the reevaluation of lived religion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGuire|first1=Meredith|title=Lived Religion. Faith and Practice in Everyday Life|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780195368338|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., to the noninstitutional character of religion. That is why his criticisms of the ecclesiocentric bias of the sociology of western religion have been the subject of relevant publications.
According to Roberto Cipriani, Cristián Parker in his work “has analyzed with scientífic rigor the crossing of popular and official culture, revealing congruences and incongruences, points of contact and contrast through theoretical and empirical work made along a trip that has lasted 30 years, aimed at discovering what he calls the “other logic” of popular culture (...). On the other hand, an extensive analysis of the relation between religion and politics from a democratic perspective is not missing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cipriani|first1=Roberto|title=Manual de Sociología de la Religión|date=2011|publisher=Siglo Veintiuno Editores|location=Buenos Aires|isbn=978-987-629-194-1|page=365}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of C. Parker is consulted by specialists and those interested in Latin America’s sociocultural and religious evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Llambías|first1=Jaime|title=América Latina : interrogantes y prespectivas|date=2013|publisher=York University Bookstore|location=Toronto|isbn=978-1-55014-583-0|pages=205–232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Parker has contributed to the sociology of development, especially in his analysis of new ways of understanding the relation between culture and development. In particular, he has conducted research on the social representations of social actors challenged by the radical scientific and technological innovations in the context of unequal globalization and on the environmental crisis, climate change, and energy transition in South American societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Cristian|last2=Letelier|first2=Mario|last3=Muñoz|first3=Juan|title=Elites, climate change and agency in a developing society: the Chilean case|journal=Environment, Development and Sustainability|date=20 March 2013|volume=15|issue=5|pages=1337–1363|doi=10.1007/s10668-013-9444-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social commitment==
During the time in which Chile was governed under the dictatorship of General [[Augusto Pinochet]], he became an active actor of a Catholic church and of the ecumenical efforts in defense of human rights and the return to democracy. In those days he became committed with the Church's base communities that fought inspired by the Liberation Theology.
As the country turned to democracy, and after the [[Chilean national plebiscite, 1988]] and the election of [[Patricio Aylwin]] as president of the democratic Concertación, he oriented his life toward academic work.
During this time he has contributed in key and strategic issues of the social sciences for the construction of democracy in Chile: development of indigenous people, overcoming poverty, social and political participation of youngsters, ethics and democracy, and the challenges of climate change and sustainable development.

[[File:Cycloconverter.png|thumb|Topology of blocking mode cycloconverter&lt;ref name="Bose (2006)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bose|first=Bimal K.|title=Power Electronics and Motor Drives : Advances and Trends|year=2006|publisher=Academic|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0-12-088405-6|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A '''cycloconverter''' (CCV) or a '''cycloinverter''' converts a constant voltage, constant frequency [[Alternating current|AC]] [[waveform]] to another AC waveform of a lower [[frequency]] by synthesizing the output waveform from segments of the AC supply without an intermediate DC link ({{harvnb|Dorf|1993|pp=2241–2243}} and {{harvnb|Lander|1993|p=181}}). There are two main types of CCVs, circulating current type or blocking mode type, most commercial high power products being of the blocking mode type.&lt;ref name="Klug (2005)"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Klug|first=Dieter-Rolf|author2=Klaassen, Norbert|title=High Power Medium Voltage Drives - Innovations, Portfolio, Trends|year=2005 |booktitle=European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications|doi=10.1109/EPE.2005.219669 |page=5}}&lt;!--|accessdate= Apr 29, 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Whereas phase-controlled [[silicon-controlled rectifier|SCR]] switching devices can be used throughout the range of CCVs, low cost, low-power [[TRIAC]]-based CCVs are inherently reserved for resistive load applications. The amplitude and frequency of converters' output voltage are both variable.  The output to input frequency ratio of a three-phase CCV must be less than about one-third for circulating current mode CCVs or one-half for blocking mode CCVs.{{harv|Lander|1993|p=188}}&lt;ref name="Bose 2006, p. 153"&gt;Bose (2006), p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Output waveform quality improves as the ''pulse number'' of switching-device bridges in phase-shifted configuration increases in CCV's input.  In general, CCVs can be with 1-phase/1-phase, 3-phase/1-phase and 3-phase/3-phase input/output configurations, most applications however being 3-phase/3-phase.&lt;ref name="Bose (2006)"/&gt;

==Applications==
The competitive power rating span of standardized CCVs ranges from few megawatts up to many tens of megawatts.  CCVs are used for driving [[mine hoist]]s, rolling mill main motors,&lt;ref name="Watzmann (1996)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watzmann|first=Marcus Watzmann|author2=Raskowetz, Steffen|title=Chinese rolling mill for extra high grade aluminium strip|date=Sep–Oct 1996|url=http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot271.nsf/veritydisplay/c2be0f4cc18285dac1256ddd00346eed/$file/28-33m214.pdf|accessdate=Aug 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ball mill]]s for ore processing, [[cement kiln]]s, [[ship propulsion]] systems,&lt;ref name="Pakaste (1999)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pakaste|first=Risto|title=Experience with Azipod propulsion systems on board marine vessels|date=Feb 1999|url=http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot271.nsf/veritydisplay/2314773146eb2d77c1256ec300341511/$file/12-18%20ENG%209902.pdf|accessdate=28 April 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; slip power recovery wound-rotor induction motors (i.e., Scherbius drives) and aircraft 400&amp;nbsp;Hz power generation.&lt;ref&gt;Bose (2006), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; The variable-frequency output of a cycloconverter can be reduced essentially to zero. This means that very large motors can be started on full load at very slow revolutions, and brought gradually up to full speed. This is invaluable with, for example, [[ball mill]]s, allowing starting with a full load rather than the alternative of having to start the mill with an empty barrel then progressively load it to full capacity. A fully loaded "hard start" for such equipment would essentially be applying full power to a stalled motor. Variable speed and reversing are essential to processes such as hot-rolling steel mills. Previously, SCR-controlled DC motors were used, needing regular brush/commutator servicing and delivering lower efficiency. Cycloconverter-driven synchronous motors need less maintenance and give greater reliability and efficiency. Single-phase bridge CCVs have also been used extensively in [[Railway electrification system|electric traction]] applications to for example produce 25&amp;nbsp;Hz power in the U.S. and 16 2/3&amp;nbsp;Hz power in Europe.&lt;ref name="Heydt (2005)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heydt|first=G.T.|author2=Chu, R.F.|title=The power quality impact of cycloconverter control strategies|journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery|date=Apr 2005|volume=20|issue=2|pages=1711–1718|doi=10.1109/tpwrd.2004.834350}}&lt;!--|accessdate=Apr 29, 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ACS 6000c (1998)"&gt;{{cite web|last=ACS 6000c|title=Cycloconverter application for high performance speed and torque control of 1 to 27 MW synchronous motors|url=http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot216.nsf/veritydisplay/2abc426982e203e6c1256e4d004deb49/$file/acs%206000c%20cycloconverter.pdf|accessdate=29 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719013216/http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot216.nsf/veritydisplay/2abc426982e203e6c1256e4d004deb49/%24file/acs%206000c%20cycloconverter.pdf|archivedate=19 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas phase-controlled converters including CCVs are gradually being replaced by faster [[pulse width modulation|PWM]] self-controlled converters based on IGBT, GTO, IGCT and other switching devices, these older classical converters are still used at the higher end of the power rating range of these applications.&lt;ref name="Bose 2006, p. 153"/&gt;

==Harmonics==
CCV operation creates current and voltage ''[[harmonics]]'' on the CCV's input and output. AC line harmonics are created on CCV's input accordance to the equation,
* {{math|&lt;var&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} &lt;var&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; (&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;&lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt;±1) ± 6&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;&lt;var&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}},&lt;ref name="IEEE 519"&gt;{{cite journal|last=IEEE Std 519|title=IEEE Recommended Practices and Requirements for Harmonic Control in Electrical Power Systems|year=1992|publisher=IEEE|page=25|doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.1993.114370}}&lt;!--|accessdate=Apr 12, 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], pp. 173-193.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with closely related terms such as '[[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]]' and '[[intersubjectivity]]', it is now well-established among scholars investigating the evolutionary emergence of human sociality, cognition and communication.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. and C. Power (2012). [http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/Knight-Power-Social-Conditions1.pdf Social conditions for the evolutionary emergence of language.] In M. Tallerman and K. Gibson (eds), ''Handbook of Language Evolution.'' Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], pp. 346-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mindreading in apes and humans==

It is widely agreed that the brain is social in both human and nonhuman primates.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, R. I. M. 1998. The social brain hypothesis. ''[[Evolutionary Anthropology (journal)|Evolutionary Anthropology]]'' 6: 178-91.&lt;/ref&gt; But, according to Andrew Whiten, human sociality goes much further than [[ape sociality]]. Ape social intelligence is overwhelmingly '[[Machiavellian]]' in the sense of scheming, self-interested and egotistically calculating.&lt;ref&gt;Whiten, A. and R. W. Byrne 1988. The manipulation of attention in primate tactical deception. In R. Byrne and A. Whiten (eds), ''Machiavellian Intelligence: Social expertise and the evolution of intellect in monkeys, apes, and humans.'' Oxford: [[Clarendon Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

One consequence is that while an ape may be motivated to 'read' (that is, to infer) the mental states of others around it, it has little motive to reciprocate. Instead of making its own mental states transparent to potential rivals, it seeks to block others from 'reading' its own mind. For example, one way to infer what another primate might be thinking is to detect which way its head is pointed, so as to reconstruct what it might be looking at. In the case of [[gorillas]] and [[chimpanzees]], adult apes have evolved eyes which give away very little information concerning direction of gaze. Their [[eyes]] are dark-on-dark: the iris is dark brown or even black and the same applies to the [[sclera]] and surrounding skin. Looking at the eyes, therefore, it is not easy to detect direction of [[gaze (physiology)|gaze]]. In the human case, the eyes are very different, the dark iris standing out against a white surrounding sclera. This feature, combined with the relatively large size of the [[human eye]] and its horizontally elongated shape, assists neighbouring conspecifics to detect direction of gaze and, on that basis, engage in mind-reading.&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi, H., and S. Kohshima (2001). ‘Unique Morphology of the Human Eye and Its Adaptive Meaning: Comparative Studies on External Morphology of the Primate Eye.’ ''[[Journal of Human Evolution]]'', 40 (5): 419-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 'Deep Social Mind' theory, this means that humans have become cognitively adapted to [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] and [[intersubjectivity]]: as a species, we are well-adapted to read the minds of trusted others while at the same time assisting those others in reading our own minds. One consequence of this is [[self-awareness]] or 'egocentric perspective reversal': I read your mind as you are reading mine. Therefore, between us, we can gain an awareness of our own minds as if from the outside: my mental states as these are reflected in yours and yours as they are reflected in mine. In that sense, if this argument is accepted, our minds mutually interpenetrate. 'Mind' in the human sense is not locked inside this or that skull but instead is relational, stretching between us.&lt;ref&gt;Whiten, A. 1999. The evolution of deep social mind in humans. In M. Corballis and S. E. G. Lea (eds), ''The Descent of Mind. Psychological perspectives on hominid evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 173-193.&lt;/ref&gt; According to evolutionary psychologist [[Michael Tomasello]], a [[human child]] normally achieves egocentric perspective reversal — viewing its own mental states as if from the standpoint of others — at around one year of age.&lt;ref&gt;M. Tomasello (2000). [http://www.unt.edu/rss/class/mike/5640/articles/culturecogdevelopment.pdf Culture and Cognitive Development.] ''[[Current Directions in Psychological Science]]'', 9: 2, pp. 37-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dickinson classification''' is a [[library classification]] scheme used to catalogue and classify [[musical composition]]s. It was developed by George Sherman Dickinson (1886–1964), and is used by many music libraries, primarily those at [[University at Buffalo]], [[Vassar College|Vassar]], and [[Columbia University|Columbia]] Universities.

It is fully detailed by [[Carol June Bradley]] in ''The Dickinson classification : a cataloguing &amp; classification manual for music''; including a reprint of the ''[[George Sherman Dickinson]] Classification of Musical Compositions'' published by Carlisle Books (1968).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3686">An '''early adopter''' (sometimes misspelled as ''early adapter'' or ''early adaptor'') or '''lighthouse customer''' is an early customer of a given company, product, or technology. The term originates from [[Everett M. Rogers]]' ''[[Diffusion of Innovations]]'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | first = Everett M.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Typically this will be a customer who, in addition to using the vendor's product or technology, will also provide considerable and candid feedback to help the vendor refine its future product releases, as well as the associated means of distribution, service, and support.  

[[File:DiffusionOfInnovation.png|thumb|Early adopters as shown in the [[Technology adoption lifecycle|Rogers' bell curve]]|384x237px]]

The relationship is [[synergy|synergistic]], with the customer having early (and sometimes unique, or at least uniquely early) access to an advantageous new product or technology, but he or she also serves as a kind of [[Human subject research|guinea pig]].

In exchange for being an early adopter, and thus being exposed to the problems, risks, and annoyances common to early-stage product testing and deployment, the lighthouse customer is sometimes given especially attentive vendor assistance and support, even to the point of having personnel at the customer's work site to assist with implementation.
The customer is sometimes given preferential pricing, terms, and conditions, although new technology is often very expensive, so the early adopter still often pays quite a lot.

The vendor, on the other hand, benefits from receiving early
revenues, and also from a lighthouse customer's endorsement and assistance in further developing the product and its go-to-market mechanisms. Acquiring lighthouse customers is a common step in new product development and implementation. The real-world focus that this type  of relationship can bring to a vendor can be extremely valuable.

Early adoption does come with pitfalls: early versions of products may be buggy and/or prone to malfunction.  Furthermore, more efficient, and sometimes less expensive, versions of the product usually appear a few months after the initial release ([[Apple iPhone]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.aol.com/top5/general/gadgets AOL Money]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13508_3-9790142-19.html Making sense of the million-dollar iPhone lawsuit]&lt;/ref&gt;  The trend of new technology costing more at release is often referred to as the "early adopter tax".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501465_162-3251293-501465.html | title=The Early Adopter's Gamble}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ecoecolfigure1.jpg|thumb|280px|Figure 1. A [[riparian forest]] in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]], [[New Hampshire]] (USA).]]

'''Ecosystem ecology''' is the integrated study of living ([[Biotic component|biotic]]) and non-living ([[Abiotic component|abiotic]]) components of [[ecosystem]]s and their interactions within an ecosystem framework. This [[science]] examines how ecosystems work and relates this to their components such as [[chemical]]s, [[bedrock]], [[soil]], [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s.

Ecosystem ecology examines physical and biological structures and examines how these ecosystem characteristics interact with each other. Ultimately, this helps us understand how to maintain high quality water and economically viable commodity production. A major focus of ecosystem ecology is on functional processes, ecological mechanisms that maintain the structure and services produced by ecosystems. These include [[primary productivity]] (production of [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]]), [[decomposition]], and [[trophic level|trophic]] interactions.

Studies of ecosystem function have greatly improved human understanding of sustainable production of [[Fodder|forage]], [[fiber]], [[fuel]], and provision of [[water]]. Functional processes are mediated by regional-to-local level [[climate]], [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]], and management. Thus ecosystem ecology provides a powerful framework for identifying ecological mechanisms that interact with global environmental problems, especially [[global warming]] and degradation of surface water.

This example demonstrates several important aspects of ecosystems:
# Ecosystem boundaries are often nebulous and may fluctuate in time
# Organisms within ecosystems are dependent on ecosystem level biological and physical processes
# Adjacent ecosystems closely interact and often are interdependent for maintenance of community structure and functional processes that maintain productivity and [[biodiversity]]

These characteristics also introduce practical problems into natural resource management. Who will manage which ecosystem? Will timber cutting in the forest degrade recreational fishing in the stream? These questions are difficult for land managers to address while the boundary between ecosystems remains unclear; even though decisions in one ecosystem will affect the other. We need better understanding of the interactions and interdependencies of these ecosystems and the processes that maintain them before we can begin to address these questions.

Ecosystem ecology is an inherently interdisciplinary field of study. An individual ecosystem is composed of [[populations]] of [[organisms]], interacting within communities, and contributing to the cycling of [[nutrients]] and the flow of [[energy]]. The ecosystem is the principal unit of study in ecosystem ecology.

Population, community, and physiological ecology provide many of the underlying biological mechanisms influencing ecosystems and the processes they maintain. Flowing of energy and cycling of matter at the ecosystem level are often examined in ecosystem ecology, but, as a whole, this science is defined more by subject matter than by scale. Ecosystem ecology approaches organisms and abiotic pools of energy and nutrients as an integrated system which distinguishes it from associated sciences such as [[biogeochemistry]].&lt;ref name= "CH 03"&gt;Chapman, S.K., Hart, S.C., Cobb, N.S., Whitham, T.G., and Koch, G.W.  (2003).  "Insect herbivory increases litter quality and decomposition: an extension of the acceleration hypothesis". in: ''Ecology'' 84:2867-2876.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogeochemistry and [[hydrology]] focus on several fundamental ecosystem processes such as biologically mediated chemical cycling of nutrients and physical-biological cycling of water. Ecosystem ecology forms the mechanistic basis for regional or global processes encompassed by landscape-to-regional hydrology, global biogeochemistry, and earth system science.&lt;ref name= "CH 03"/&gt;

== History ==
Ecosystem ecology is philosophically and historically rooted in terrestrial ecology. The ecosystem concept has evolved rapidly during the last 100 years with important ideas developed by [[Frederic Clements]], a botanist who argued for specific definitions of ecosystems and that physiological processes were responsible for their development and persistence.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, J.B. (1992). ''An Entangled Bank: The origins of ecosystem ecology''. Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, N.J.&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of Clements ecosystem definitions have been greatly revised, initially by [[Henry Gleason]] and [[Arthur Tansley]], and later by contemporary ecologists, the idea that physiological processes are fundamental to ecosystem structure and function remains central to ecology.

[[Image:Silver Spring Model.jpg|thumb|240px|Figure 3. Energy and matter flows through an ecosystem, adapted from the Silver Springs model.&lt;ref&gt;Odum, H.T. (1971). ''Environment, Power, and Society''. Wiley-Interscience New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; H are herbivores, C are carnivores, TC are top carnivores, and D are decomposers. Squares represent biotic pools and ovals are fluxes or energy or nutrients from the system.]] Later work by [[Eugene Odum]] and [[Howard T. Odum]] quantified flows of energy and matter at the ecosystem level, thus documenting the general ideas proposed by Clements and his contemporary [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton]]. See Figure 3.

In this model, energy flows through the whole system were dependent on biotic and abiotic interactions of each individual component ([[species]], inorganic pools of nutrients, etc.). Later work demonstrated that these interactions and flows applied to nutrient cycles, changed over the course of [[ecological succession|succession]], and held powerful controls over ecosystem productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Odum, E.P 1969. "The strategy of ecosystem development". in: ''Science'' 164:262-270.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="L70"&gt;Likens, G. E., F. H. Bormann, N. M. Johnson, D. W. Fisher and R. S. Pierce. (1970). "Effects of forest cutting and herbicide treatment on nutrient budgets in the Hubbard Brook watershed-ecosystem". in: ''Ecological Monographs'' 40:23-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Transfers of energy and nutrients are innate to ecological systems regardless of whether they are aquatic or terrestrial. Thus, ecosystem ecology has emerged from important biological studies of plants, animals, [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]], [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]], and [[marine (ocean)|marine]] ecosystems.

==Ecosystem services==
Ecosystem services are ecologically mediated functional processes essential to sustaining healthy [[human]] societies.&lt;ref&gt;Chapin, F.S. III, B.H., Walker, R.J., Hobbs, D.U., Hooper, J.H., Lawton, O.E., Sala, and D., Tilman. (1997). "Biotic control over the functioning of ecosystems". in: ''Science'' 277:500-504.&lt;/ref&gt; Water provision and filtration, production of [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] in [[forestry]], [[agriculture]], and [[fisheries]], and removal of [[greenhouse gas]]es such as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from the [[atmosphere]] are examples of ecosystem services essential to [[public health]] and economic opportunity. Nutrient cycling is a process fundamental to agricultural and forest production.

However, like most ecosystem processes, nutrient cycling is not an ecosystem characteristic which can be “dialed” to the most desirable level. Maximizing production in degraded systems is an overly simplistic solution to the complex problems of hunger and economic security. For instance, intensive [[fertilizer]] use in the midwestern United States has resulted in degraded fisheries in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Defries, R.S., J.A. Foley, and G.P. Asner. (2004). "Land-use choices: balancing human needs and ecosystem function". in: ''Frontiers in ecology and environmental science''. 2:249-257.&lt;/ref&gt; Regrettably, a “[[Green Revolution]]” of intensive chemical fertilization has been recommended for agriculture in [[developed countries|developed]] and [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;Chrispeels, M.J. and Sadava, D. (1977). ''Plants, food, and people''. W. H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quinones, M.A., N.E. Borlaug, C.R. Dowswell. (1997). "A fertilizer-based green revolution for Africa". In: ''Replenishing soil fertility in Africa''. Soil Science Society of America special publication number 51. Soil Science Society of America, Madison, WI.&lt;/ref&gt; These strategies risk alteration of ecosystem processes that may be difficult to restore, especially when applied at broad scales without adequate assessment of impacts. Ecosystem processes may take many years to recover from significant disturbance.&lt;ref name ="L70"/&gt;

For instance, large-scale forest clearance in the northeastern United States during the 18th and 19th centuries has altered soil texture, dominant vegetation, and nutrient cycling in ways that impact forest productivity in the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, D. R. (1992). "Land-use history (1730-1990) and vegetation dynamics in central New England, USA". In: ''Journal of Ecology'' 80: 753-772.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Motzkin, G., D. R. Foster, A. Allen, J. Harrod, and R. D. Boone. (1996). "Controlling site to evaluate history: vegetation patterns of a New England sand plain". In: ''Ecological Monographs'' 66: 345-365.&lt;/ref&gt; An appreciation of the importance of ecosystem function in maintenance of productivity, whether in agriculture or forestry, is needed in conjunction with plans for restoration of essential processes. Improved knowledge of ecosystem function will help to achieve long-term sustainability and stability in the poorest parts of the world.

==Operation==
Biomass productivity is one of the most apparent and economically important ecosystem functions. Biomass accumulation begins at the cellular level via photosynthesis. Photosynthesis requires water and consequently global patterns of annual biomass production are correlated with annual precipitation.&lt;ref&gt;Huxman TE, ea.(2004). "Convergence across biomes to a common rain-use efficiency". ''Nature''. 429: 651-654&lt;/ref&gt; Amounts of productivity are also dependent on the overall capacity of plants to capture sunlight which is directly correlated with plant leaf area and N content.

[[Primary production|Net primary productivity]] (NPP) is the primary measure of biomass accumulation within an ecosystem. Net primary productivity can be calculated by a simple formula where the total amount of productivity is adjusted for total productivity losses through maintenance of biological processes:

:NPP = GPP – R&lt;sub&gt;producer&lt;/sub&gt;

[[Image:Ecoecolfigure4.jpg|thumb|240px|Figure 4. Seasonal and annual changes in ambient carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) concentration at Mauna Loa Hawaii (Atmosphere) and above the canopy of a deciduous forest in Massachusetts (Forest). Data show clear seasonal trends associated with periods of high and low NPP and an overall annual increase of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Data approximates of those reported by Keeling and Whorf&lt;ref&gt;Keeling, C.D. and T.P. Whorf. (2005). "Atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; records from sites in the SIO air sampling network". In: ''Trends: A Compendium of Data on Global Change''. Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy, Oak Ridge, Tenn., U.S.A.&lt;/ref&gt; and Barford.&lt;ref name = "B01"/&gt;]] Where GPP is gross primary productivity and R&lt;sub&gt;producer&lt;/sub&gt; is photosynthate ([[Carbon]]) lost via [[cellular respiration]].

NPP is difficult to measure but a new technique known as eddy co-variance has shed light on how natural ecosystems influence the atmosphere. Figure 4 shows seasonal and annual changes in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration measured at [[Mauna Loa]], [[Hawaii]] from 1987 to 1990. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration steadily increased, but within-year variation has been greater than the annual increase since measurements began in 1957.

These variations were thought to be due to seasonal uptake of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during summer months.  A newly developed technique for assessing ecosystem NPP has confirmed seasonal variation are driven by seasonal changes in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake by vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Goulden, M. L., J. W. Munger, S.-M. Fan, B. C. Daube, and S. C. Wofsy, (1996). "Effects of interannual climate variability on the carbon dioxide exchange of a temperate deciduous forest". In: ''Science'' 271:1576-1578&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "B01"&gt;Barford, C. C., ea. (2001). "Factors controlling long and short term sequestration of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a mid-latitude forest". In: ''Science'' 294: 1688-1691&lt;/ref&gt;  This has led many scientists and policy makers to speculate that ecosystems can be managed to ameliorate problems with [[global warming]]. This type of management may include reforesting or altering forest harvest schedules for many parts of the world.

===Decomposition and nutrient cycling===
[[Decomposition]] and nutrient cycling are fundamental to ecosystem biomass production. Most natural ecosystems are [[nitrogen]] (N) limited and biomass production is closely correlated with N turnover.&lt;ref&gt;Vitousek, P.M. and Howarth, R.W. (1991). "Nitrogen limitation on land and in the sea: how can it occur?" In: ''Biogeochemistry'' 13:87-115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reich, P.B., Grigal, D.F., Aber, J.D., Gower, S.T. (1997). "Nitrogen mineralization and productivity in 50 hardwood and conifer stands on diverse soils". In: ''Ecology'' 78:335-347.&lt;/ref&gt;
Typically external input of nutrients is very low and efficient recycling of nutrients maintains productivity.&lt;ref name ="L70"/&gt; Decomposition of plant litter accounts for the majority of nutrients recycled through ecosystems (Figure 3). Rates of plant litter decomposition are highly dependent on litter quality; high concentration of phenolic compounds, especially [[lignin]], in plant litter has a retarding effect on litter decomposition.&lt;ref name= "M 82"&gt;Melillo, J.M., Aber, J.D., and Muratore, J.F. (1982).  "Nitrogen and lignin control of hardwood leaf litter decomposition dynamics". In: ''Ecology'' 63:621-626.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hättenschwiler S. and P.M. Vitousek (2000). "The role of polyphenols in terrestrial ecosystem nutrient cycling". In: ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution'' 15: 238-243&lt;/ref&gt; More complex C compounds are decomposed more slowly and may take many years to completely breakdown. Decomposition is typically described with [[exponential decay]] and has been related to the mineral concentrations, especially manganese, in the leaf litter.&lt;ref&gt;Davey MP, B Berg, P Rowland, BA Emmett. 2007. Decomposition of oak leaf litter is related to initial litter Mn concentrations. Canadian Journal of Botany. 85(1). 16-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berg B, Davey MP, Emmett B, Faituri M, Hobbie S, Johansson MB, Liu C, De Marco A, McClaugherty C, Norell L, Rutigliano F, De Santo AV. 2010. Factors influencing limit values for pine needle litter decomposition - a synthesis for boreal and temperate pine forest systems. Biogeochemistry. 100: 57-73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ecoecolfigure5.jpg|thumb|240px|Figure 5. Dynamics of decomposing plant litter (A) described with an exponential model (B) and a combined exponential-linear model (C).]]  
Globally, rates of decomposition are mediated by litter quality and climate.&lt;ref&gt;Meentemeyer, V.  1978  "Macroclimate and lignin control of litter decomposition rates". in: ''Ecology'' 59:465-472.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystems dominated by plants with low-lignin concentration often have rapid rates of decomposition and nutrient cycling (Chapin et al. 1982). Simple carbon (C) containing compounds are preferentially metabolized by [[decomposer]] microorganisms which results in rapid initial rates of decomposition, see Figure 5A,&lt;ref&gt;Aber, J.D., and J.M., Melillo  (1982). "Nitrogen immobilization in decaying hardwood leaf litter as a function of initial nitrogen and lignin content". In: ''Canadian Journal of Botany'' 60:2263-2269.&lt;/ref&gt; models that depend on constant rates of decay; so called “k” values, see Figure 5B.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, J.S. (1963). "Energy storage and the balance of producers and decomposers in ecological systems". In: ''Ecology'' 44:322-331.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to litter quality and climate, the activity of soil fauna is very important &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Castro-Huerta, R. |author2=Falco, L. |author3=Sandler, R. |author4=Coviella, C. |year=2015 |title=Differential contribution of soil biota groups to plant litter decomposition as mediated by soil use |journal=[[PeerJ]] |volume=3 |pages=e826 |doi=10.7717/peerj.826 |url=https://peerj.com/articles/826/?td=wk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these models do not reflect simultaneous linear and non-linear decay processes which likely occur during decomposition. For instance, [[proteins]], [[sugars]] and [[lipids]] decompose exponentially, but lignin decays at a more linear rate&lt;ref name= "M 82"/&gt; Thus, litter decay is inaccurately predicted by simplistic models.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, S.A. (1981). "Decay of heterogeneous detritus: a general model". In: ''Journal of theoretical biology''  89:539-547.&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple alternative model presented in Figure 5C shows significantly more rapid decomposition that the standard model of figure 4B. Better understanding of decomposition models is an important research area of ecosystem ecology because this process is closely tied to nutrient supply and the overall capacity of ecosystems to sequester CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere.

===Trophic dynamics===
Trophic dynamics refers to process of energy and [[nutrient]] transfer between organisms. Trophic dynamics is an important part of the structure and function of ecosystems. Figure 3 shows energy transferred for an ecosystem at Silver Springs, Florida. Energy gained by primary producers (plants, P) is consumed by herbivores (H), which are consumed by carnivores (C), which are themselves consumed by “top- carnivores”(TC).

One of the most obvious patterns in Figure 3 is that as one moves up to higher [[trophic level]]s (i.e. from plants to top-carnivores) the total amount of energy decreases. Plants exert a “bottom-up” control on the energy structure of ecosystems by determining the total amount of energy that enters the system.&lt;ref&gt;Chapin F.S. III, Matson, P.A., and Mooney, H.A. (2003). ''Principles of terrestrial ecosystem ecology''. Springer-Verlag, New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, predators can also influence the structure of lower trophic levels from the top-down. These influences can dramatically shift dominant species in terrestrial and marine systems&lt;ref&gt;Belovsky, G.E. and J.B. Slade. (2000). "Insect herbivory accelerates nutrient cycling and increases plant production". In: ''Proceedings of the national academy of sciences'' (USA). 97:14412-14417.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frank et al. 2005"&gt;Frank et al. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The interplay and relative strength of top-down vs. bottom-up controls on ecosystem structure and function is an important area of research in the greater field of ecology.

Trophic dynamics can strongly influence rates of decomposition and nutrient cycling in time and in space. For example, herbivory can increase litter decomposition and nutrient cycling via direct changes in litter quality and altered dominant vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, M.D. (2001). "Insect population dynamics meets ecosystem ecology: effects of herbivory on soil nutrient dynamics". In: ''Agricultural and Forest Entomology'' 3:77-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Insect herbivory has been shown to increase rates of decomposition and nutrient turnover due to changes in litter quality and increased [[frass]] inputs.&lt;ref name= "CH 03"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swank, W.T., Waide, J.B., Crossley, D.A., and Todd R.L. (1981). "Insect defoliation enhances nitrate export from forest ecosystems". In: ''Oecologia'' 51:297-299.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
However, insect outbreak does not always increase nutrient cycling. Stadler&lt;ref&gt;Stadler, B., Solinger, St., and Michalzik, B. (2001). "Insect herbivores and the nutrient flow from the canopy to the soil in coniferous and deciduous forests". In: ''[[Oecologia]]'' 126:104-113&lt;/ref&gt; showed that C rich honeydew produced during aphid outbreak can result in increased N immobilization by soil microbes thus slowing down nutrient cycling and potentially limiting biomass production. North atlantic marine ecosystems have been greatly altered by overfishing of cod. Cod stocks crashed in the 1990s which resulted in increases in their prey such as shrimp and snow crab&lt;ref name="Frank et al. 2005"/&gt; Human intervention in ecosystems has resulted in dramatic changes to ecosystem structure and function. These changes are occurring rapidly and have unknown consequences for economic security and human well-being.

==Applications and importance==

===Lessons from two Central American cities===
The biosphere has been greatly altered by the demands of human societies. Ecosystem ecology plays an important role in understanding and adapting to the most pressing current environmental problems. Restoration ecology and ecosystem management are closely associated with ecosystem ecology. Restoring highly degraded resources depends on integration of functional mechanisms of ecosystems.&lt;ref name= "E&amp;T97"&gt;Ehrenfeld, J.G. and Toth, L.A. (1997). "Restoration ecology and the ecosystem perspective". in: ''Restoration Ecology''  5:307-317.&lt;/ref&gt;

Without these functions intact, economic value of ecosystems is greatly reduced and potentially dangerous conditions may develop in the field. For example, areas within the mountainous western highlands of [[Guatemala]] are more susceptible to catastrophic landslides and crippling seasonal water shortages due to loss of forest resources. In contrast, cities such as [[Totonicapán]] that have preserved forests through strong social institutions have greater local economic stability and overall greater human well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Conz, B.W. 2004. Continuity and Contestation: Conservation Landscapes in Totonicapán, Guatemala. University of Massachusetts Masters of Science thesis.&lt;/ref&gt;

This situation is striking considering that these areas are close to each other, the majority of inhabitants are of [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] descent, and the topography and overall resources are similar. This is a case of two groups of people managing resources in fundamentally different ways. Ecosystem ecology provides the basic science needed to avoid degradation and to restore ecosystem processes that provide for basic human needs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2497">The '''electron beam prober (e-beam prober)''' is a specialized adaption of a standard [[scanning electron microscope]] (SEM) that is used for [[semiconductor]] [[failure analysis]]. While a conventional SEM may be operated in a voltage range of 10–30&amp;nbsp;keV, the e-beam Prober typically operates at 1&amp;nbsp;keV. The e-beam prober is capable of measuring voltage and timing waveforms on internal semiconductor signal structures. Waveforms may be measured on metal line, polysilicon and diffusion structures that have an electrically active, changing signal. The operation of the prober is similar to that of a sampling [[oscilloscope]]. A continuously looping, repeating test pattern must be applied to the device-under-test (DUT). E-beam probers are used primarily for front side semiconductor analysis. With the advent of [[Flip chip|flip-chip]] technology, many e-beam probers have been replaced with back side analysis instruments.

==Theory of operation==
The e-beam prober generates an SEM image by raster-scanning a focused electron beam over a selected region of the semiconductor surface. The high energy electrons in the primary beam strike the surface of the silicon, producing a number of low energy secondary electrons. The secondary electrons are guided back up through the SEM column to a detector. The varying numbers of secondary electrons reaching the detector are interpreted to produce the SEM image.

During waveform acquisition mode, the primary electron beam is focused on a single point on the device surface. As the DUT cycles through its test pattern, the signal at the point being probed changes. The signal changes produce a corresponding change in the local electric field surrounding the point being probed. This affects the number of secondary electrons that escape the device surface and reach the detector. Since electrons are negatively charged, a conductor at a +5&amp;nbsp;volt potential inhibits the escape of electrons, while a 0&amp;nbsp;volt potential allows a greater number of electrons to reach the detector. By monitoring these changes in potential, a voltage and timing waveform may be produced for the signal at the point being probed.

The '''Gallatin School of Individualized Study''' (commonly known as '''Gallatin''') is a small interdisciplinary college within [[New York University]]. Students design their own interdisciplinary program that meets their specific interests and career goals. Coursework can be taken at any of the schools that comprise NYU in addition to the school's own offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://thechoice.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/07/degrees-are-getting-a-makeover/?_r=0| title=Creating Your Own Major, From ‘Keeping It Real’ to ‘Grand Romantic Gestures’| author=Lily Altivina| date=February 7, 2012| publisher=The New York Times| access-date=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Founded in 1972 as the '''University Without Walls''', the school was renamed the Gallatin Division in 1976 after [[Albert Gallatin]], [[Secretary of the Treasury]] under [[Thomas Jefferson]], and the founder of NYU. In 1995, the school took its current name, The Gallatin School of Individualized Study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gallatin.nyu.edu/about/facts.html|title=Gallatin Leadership and Facts Page|last=|first=|date=|website=http://gallatin.nyu.edu/|publisher=NYU Gallatin|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert London]] was the school's first dean through 1992. The Gallatin building is situated within the [[Campus of New York University]] just east of [[Washington Square Park]] at 1 Washington Place.

The Gallatin School's facilities on the corner of Washington Place and Broadway underwent a redesign from 2007-2008. It was the first renovation project at NYU to achieve [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certification. The project earned a LEED Gold certification for the renovation of five floors (approximately 32,000 square feet) of the existing building, including the construction of a theater, art gallery, classrooms, studios, and offices.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyu.edu/gallatin/leed/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; The main building is named after Georgina Bloomberg.

==Academics==

===Curriculum===

Gallatin students develop a concentration, as opposed to a [[Academic major|major]], that is individualized to suit their interests and goals. A concentration can encompass multiple areas of study and often involves taking courses in various schools within NYU.

Rather than prescribing a specific set of courses (e.g., English 101, Western Civ), Gallatin employs a form of [[student-centered learning]] in which students are free to choose courses they are interested in but are expected to take responsibility for their own academic growth. There are, however, general requirements for graduation. Among these are:

*Gallatin students are required to take 25% of their courses within Gallatin.  Options include writing and arts workshops, [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] seminars reaching across the [[liberal arts]], community learning, [[Tutorials#Academia|tutorials]], [[internship]]s, and independent studies.
*Foundation courses, either the Liberal Arts Foundation (8 Humanities credits, 8 Social Science credits, 4 Mathematics or Science credits) or Historical and Cultural Foundation (4 Premodern credits, 4 Early Modern credits, and 4 Global Cultures credits). The two sets of foundation requirements may overlap and fulfill more than one requirement at once.&lt;ref name="nyu"&gt;http://gallatin.nyu.edu/academics/undergraduate/requirements.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*First year requirements: Students take a First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar, a First-Year Writing Seminar, and a First-Year Research Seminar (numerous topics are available). 
*Second year requirements: The student writes their Intellectual Autobiography and Plan for Concentration (IAPC), an essay which charts their studies thus far and describes the plan for their continuation and refinement.
*Third year requirements: The student writes their Rationale, an essay describing their planned course of study for their final year accompanied by a list of 20-25 books that will be discussed during the Colloquium (see below).  The Rationale is reviewed and approved by two faculty members.
*Fourth year/graduation requirement: The student must successfully pass their Colloquium, an intensive [[oral examination]] during which the student engages with a panel of three faculty for approximately two hours about their concentration and concomitant literature.&lt;ref name="nyu" /&gt;

===Advising===

Because Gallatin focuses on students at the individual level, advising is a major component of the program. Each student is assigned two advisors: a class advisor who serves the needs of a full grade level (freshmen, sophomores, juniors, seniors) and an academic advisor, who is more involved at the individual level with helping students shape their concentrations. The academic advisors help identify the interests of their advisees, approve class schedules, attend advisee Colloquiums, and serve as the primary source of advising. Academic advisors are usually faculty members at Gallatin who share similar interests with advisee students, but advisors can come from any of the schools within NYU across several disciplines. Students can request to change academic advisors.

===Colloquium===

In order to qualify for graduation, all students in the Gallatin undergraduate program must successfully complete a final oral examination called the Colloquium. The Colloquium is an intellectual conversation among four people (the student, the student's adviser, and two other members of the faculty) about a selection of books representing several academic disciplines and historical periods. The Colloquium provides an opportunity for students to reflect on their Gallatin concentration and to synthesize various experiences studying books, taking courses, doing independent studies and internships into an integrated discussion about several books and themes. In preparing for the Colloquium, each student creates a book list of twenty to twenty-five works and writes a brief paper known as the Rationale which describes the themes the student plans to discuss in the Colloquium.

==Student life==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
There are a variety of student-run organizations at Gallatin that span a vast array of interests for both undergraduate and graduate students of the school:

* '''Dancers Choreographers Alliance (DCA)''' provides student choreographers with the opportunity to create their work with fellow student dancers. DCA also allows other members of the performance community to participate in roles such as musicians, composers, and artistic managers.
* '''Gallatin Arts Festival (GAF)''' is a week-long community-wide celebration of the unique artistry and interdisciplinary scholarship of NYU’s Gallatin School. The festival features over 50 students presenting work in the visual and performing arts.
* '''Gallatin Cookies and Coloring''', invites students to eat cookies and color coloring books. The club provides an un-structured forum for students to socialize and relax. Under the current leadership, the club has hosted special events such as body painting and the appreciation of mid-70s feminist coloring books.
* '''Gallatin Theatre Troupe (GTT)''' exists as a collective of students interested in writing, directing, managing, and acting in theatre. GTT serves as a place to discuss theatre and attend shows.
* '''Students of Color &amp; Allies (SOCA)''' serves as a support and networking group that connects students within Gallatin for social outings, intellectual activities, and academic workshops that address common interests. SOCA now organizes events aimed at enhancing the Gallatin experience for students of color.
* '''''The Gallatin Review''''' publishes the poetry, prose, essays, and visual art of students and faculty. 
* '''''The Gallatin Research Journal (GRJ)'''''  is a student-run publication devoted to showcasing the excellence achieved by Gallatin students in the arena of academic non-fiction work. 
* '''''Journal of Global Affairs (JGA)''''' creates, produces, and publishes a scholarly undergraduate journal that showcases articles and artwork pertaining to all aspects of global affairs. JGA provides a forum for undergraduate students at NYU to publish their work in a scholarly journal.
* '''Gallatin Business Club (GBC)''' provides resources, such as seminars, speakers, and group discussion on a variety of business topics. This club is for students interested in the corporate world. The club is an outlet for students to discuss current events in business and provides networking opportunities through speakers in a variety of fields.
* '''NADI: Middle Eastern Studies Society''' endeavors to create an intellectual community for students of the Middle East at Gallatin by means of extra-curricular programming and an annual journal. The organization shares information about Middle Eastern Studies courses, study abroad programs and internships.
* '''Gallatin Math and Science Society''' allows students to advise each other on studying math and science within the Gallatin's requirements. G-MASS is also works to integrate science-based events into the Gallatin calendar.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8483">[[File:Gorgoneion Regnaudin Amelot de Bisseuil.jpg|thumb|A wooden door panel intended to guard the house from an unwelcome guest ([[Thomas Regnaudin]], former Hôtel des Ambassadeurs de Hollande, rue vieille du Temple, Paris c. 1660).]]

In [[Ancient Greece]], the '''Gorgoneion''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Γοργόνειον) was a special [[apotropaic]]  [[amulet]] showing the [[Gorgon]] head, used most famously by the [[Olympian gods|Olympian deities]] [[Athena]] and [[Zeus]]: both are said to have worn the gorgoneion as a protective [[pendant]].&lt;ref name="Vassilika"&gt;{{harvnb|Vassilika|1998|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was assumed, among other godlike attributes, as a royal [[aegis]] to imply divine birth or protection, by rulers of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic age]], as shown, for instance, on the [[Alexander Mosaic]] and the [[Gonzaga Cameo]].

==Origin==
According to [[Marija Gimbutas]], gorgoneia represent certain aspects of the [[Mother Goddess]] cult associated with "dynamic life energy" and asserts that the images may be related to a cultural continuity persisting since Neolithic examples. She defined the gorgoneion as a quintessentially European image. [[Jane Ellen Harrison]], on the other hand, claims that many primitive cultures use similar ritual masks in order to scare the owner from doing something wrong, or, as she terms it, to make an ugly face at the owner: "The ritual object comes first; then the monster is begotten to account for it; then the hero is supplied to account for the slaying of the monster".&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;{{harvnb|Harrison|1991|pp=187–188}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[Homer]] refers to the Gorgon on four occasions, each time alluding to the head alone, as if she had no body.&lt;ref name="Potts"&gt;{{harvnb|Potts|1982|pp=26–28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jane Ellen Harrison]] notes that "Medusa is a head and nothing more... a [[mask]] with a body later appended".&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; Prior to the fifth century BC, she was depicted as particularly ugly, with a protruding tongue, [[boar]] [[tusk]]s, puffy cheeks, her eyeballs staring fixedly on the viewer and the snakes twisting all around her.

The direct frontal stare, "seemingly looking out from its own iconographical context and directly challenging the viewer",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ogden|2008|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was highly unusual in ancient Greek art. (''But see'' the common depiction of the [[Evil_eye#Greece|evil eye]] on 6th century drinking vessels, and particularly, [[eye-cup]]s, which, like Gorgoneia, are assumed apotropaics.) In some instances what sometimes appears as a beard (probably standing for stylized hair or streaks of blood however) was appended to her chin, making her appear as an [[Dionysian Mysteries|orgiastic deity]] akin to [[Dionysus]].

Gorgoneia that decorate the shields of warriors on mid-fifth century Greek vases are considerably less grotesque and menacing. By that time, the Gorgon had lost her tusks and the snakes were rather stylized.&lt;ref name="Potts"/&gt; The [[Hellenistic]] marble known as the [[Medusa Rondanini]] illustrates the Gorgon's eventual transformation into a beautiful woman.&lt;ref name="Potts"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:OlympiaGorgo retouched.jpg|thumb|[[Winged Gorgoneion (Olympia B 110)|Winged Gorgoneion]] from [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], originally an [[apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] shield decoration, early sixth century BC]]
[[File:Gorgoneion Cdm Paris 320.jpg|thumb|Gorgoneion on the Tondo of an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] Attic [[Black-figure pottery|black-figured]] cup, end of sixth century BC - Cabinet des médailles de la Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris, France.]]
Gorgoneia appear frequently in Greek art at the turn of the eighth century BC. One of the earliest representations is on an [[electrum]] [[stater]] discovered during excavations at [[Parium]].&lt;ref name="Potts"/&gt; Other early eighth-century examples were found at [[Tiryns]]. Going further back into history, there is a similar image from the [[Knossos]] palace, datable to the fifteenth century BC. [[Marija Gimbutas]] even argues that "the Gorgon extends back to at least 6000 BC, as a ceramic mask from the [[Sesklo culture]] illustrates",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gimbutas|2001|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in her book, ''Language of the Goddess'', she also identifies the prototype of the Gorgoneion in [[Neolithic]] art motifs, especially in [[anthropomorphic]] vases and [[terracotta]] masks inlaid with gold.

In the sixth century, gorgoneia of a canonical "lion mask type" were ubiquitous on Greek temples, especially in and around [[Corinth]]. [[Pediment]]al gorgoneia were common in [[Sicily]]; probably the earliest occurrence being in the [[Temple of Apollo (Syracuse)|Temple of Apollo]] in [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].&lt;ref name="Marconi"&gt;{{harvnb|Marconi|2007|pp=214–217}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 500 BC, they ceased to be used for the decoration of monumental buildings, but were still shown on [[antefix]]es of smaller structures throughout the next century.&lt;ref name="Marconi"/&gt;

Apart from temples, the Gorgon imagery is present on dress, dishes, weapons, and coins found across the Mediterranean region from [[Etruria]] to the [[Black Sea]] coast. The Gorgon coins were struck in 37 cities, making her image on coins second in [[numismatics|numismatic ubiquity]] only to several principal [[Olympian gods]].&lt;ref name="Potts"/&gt; On [[mosaic]] floors, the gorgoneion usually was depicted next to the threshold, as if guarding it from hostile intruders. On [[Attica|Attic]] kilns, the gorgoneion over the kiln door protected from mishaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrison|1991|pp=189, figs. 27–30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gorgon imagery remained popular even in Christian times, especially in the [[Byzantine Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Deutsches Archäologisches Institut|1991|p=132}}.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Kievan Rus]], and was revived in the West by the [[Italian Renaissance]] artists.

More recently, the gorgoneion was adopted by [[Gianni Versace]] as a logo for his fashion company.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3626">'''Ground substance''' is an amorphous gel-like substance in the extracellular space that contains all components of the [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) except for fibrous materials such as [[collagen]] and [[elastin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Michelle | last = Peckham | name-list-format = vanc | title = Extracellular Matrix - 'Ground substance' | url = https://www.histology.leeds.ac.uk/tissue_types/connective/connective_groundS.php | publisher = University of Leeds }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ground substance is active in the development, movement, and proliferation of tissues, as well as their metabolism. Additionally, cells use it for support, water storage, binding, and a medium for intercellular exchange (especially between blood cells and other types of cells). Ground substance provides lubrication for collagen fibers.&lt;ref name=atlas&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stecco |first1=Carla |last2=Hammer |first2=Warren |last3=Vleeming |first3=Andry |last4=De Caro |first4=Raffaele | name-list-format = vanc |chapter=Connective Tissues |title=Functional Atlas of the Human Fascial System |pages=1–20 |year=2015 | publisher = Churchill Livingstone Elsevier | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-7020-4430-4.00001-4 | isbn=978-0-7020-4430-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The components of the ground substance vary depending on the tissue. Ground substance is primarily composed of water, [[glycosaminoglycans]] (GAGs) such as [[hyaluronic acid]], [[heparan sulfate]], [[dermatan sulfate]], and [[chondroitin sulfate]], [[proteoglycans]] which GAGs are bound to, and [[glycoproteins]]. Components of the ground substance are secreted by [[fibroblasts]]. Usually it is not visible on slides, because it is lost during staining in the preparation process.&lt;ref name="urlConnective Tissue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courseweb.uottawa.ca/medicine-histology/English/SS_BasicTissues/Connective_Tissue.htm | title=Connective Tissue | work = Self Study Unit of the Basic Tissues | publisher = University of Ottawa |access-date=2008-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081107231710/http://www.courseweb.uottawa.ca/medicine-histology/English/SS_BasicTissues/Connective_Tissue.htm |archive-date=2008-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Link proteins such as [[vinculin]], [[spectrin]] and [[actomyosin]] stabilize the proteoglycans and organize elastic fibers in the ECM.&lt;ref name=atlas/&gt; Changes in the density of ground substance can allow collagen fibers to form aberrant cross-links.&lt;ref name=atlas/&gt; [[Loose connective tissue]] is characterized by few fibers and cells, and a relatively large amount of ground substance. [[Dense connective tissue]] has a smaller amount of ground substance compared to the fibrous material.&lt;ref name=atlas/&gt;

The meaning of the term has evolved over time.&lt;ref name="pmid12756276"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wheatley DN | title = Diffusion, perfusion and the exclusion principles in the structural and functional organization of the living cell: reappraisal of the properties of the 'ground substance' | journal = The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 206 | issue = Pt 12 | pages = 1955–61 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12756276 | doi = 10.1242/jeb.00238 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MacVector''' is a commercial sequence analysis application for Apple Macintosh computers running [[Mac OS X]]. It is intended to be used by [[Molecular biology|molecular biologists]] to help analyze, design, research and document their experiments in the laboratory.

== Features ==
MacVector is a collection of sequence analysis algorithms linked to various sequence editors, including a single sequence editor, a [[multiple sequence alignment]] editor and a contig editor.  MacVector tries to use a minimum of windows and steps to access all the functionality. Functions include:

* [[Sequence alignment]] ([[ClustalW]], [[MUSCLE (alignment software)|Muscle]] and [[T-COFFEE|T-Coffee]]) and editing.
* Subsequence search and [[open reading frames]] (ORFs) analysis.
* [[Phylogenetic tree]] construction [[UPGMA]], [[Neighbour joining]] with bootstrapping and consensus trees
* Online Database searching - Search public databases at the NCBI such as [[Genbank]], [[PubMed]], and  [[UniProt]].
* Perform online [[BLAST]] searches.
* Protein analysis.
* Contig assembly and [[chromatogram]] editing
* Aligning [[cDNA]] against genomic templates
* Creating [[Dot plot (bioinformatics)|dot plots]] of DNA to DNA, Protein to Protein and DNA to protein.
* Restriction analysis - find and view restriction cut sites. Uses digested fragments to clone genes into vectors. Stores a history of digested fragments allowing multi fragment ligations.
* [[PCR]] Primer design - easy primer design and testing. Also uses [[primer3]]
* [[Agarose_gel_electrophoresis|Agarose Gel]] simulation.

MacVector has a contig assembly plugin called [[MacVector Assembler|Assembler]] that uses [[Phred quality score|phred]], [[phrap]], [[List of sequence alignment software#Short-Read Sequence Alignment|Bowtie]], SPAdes, [[Velvet assembler|Velvet]] and [[cross match]].

As of version 13.0.1 MacVector uses [[Sparkle (software)|Sparkle]] for updating between releases.

== History ==

MacVector was originally developed by IBI in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;"MacVector: an integrated sequence analysis program for the Macintosh". Olson SA. ''Methods Mol Biol''. (1994) 25,195-201.&lt;/ref&gt; It was acquired by Kodak, and subsequently Oxford Molecular in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.sciencemag.org/site/products/bt-dna.xhtml |title=DNA Sequencing Software - Special Ad Section|date= 7 June 1996|journal=Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb197/is_/ai_n5566980#{{Dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxford Molecular was merged into Accelrys in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://accelrys.com/company/ |title=About Accelrys, including company leadership, recognition, and news |publisher=Accelrys.com |date=2009-05-04 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was acquired by MacVector, Inc on 1 January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://accelrys.com/products/macvector/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607134226/http://accelrys.com/products/additional-products.html |archivedate=2008-06-07 |title=Accelrys - Additional Products |publisher=accelrys.com |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[psychology]], '''mental time travel''' (also called "chronosthesia") is the capacity to mentally reconstruct personal events from the past ([[episodic memory]]) as well as to imagine possible scenarios in the [[future]] (episodic [[Foresight (psychology)|foresight]] / episodic future thinking). The term was coined by Thomas Suddendorf and [[Michael Corballis]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=pmid9204544&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Suddendorf T, Corballis MC | title = Mental time travel and the evolution of the human mind | journal = Genetic, Social, and General Psychology Monographs | volume = 123 | issue = 2 | pages = 133–67 | date = May 1997 | pmid = 9204544 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The synonymous term '''chronesthesia''' was coined by [[Endel Tulving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195134971.003.0020 |chapter=Chronesthesia: Conscious Awareness of Subjective Time |title=Principles of Frontal Lobe Function |pages=311–325 |year=2002 |last1=Tulving |first1=Endel | name-list-format = vanc |isbn=978-0-19-513497-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental time travel has been studied by [[psychologists]], cognitive neuroscientists, philosophers and in a variety of other academic disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.26613/esic.2.1.75 |title=The History and Future of Human Prospection |journal=Evolutionary Studies in Imaginative Culture |volume=2 |pages=75 |year=2018 | first = Adam | last = Bulley | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klein SB | title = The complex act of projecting oneself into the future | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–79 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 26304175 | doi = 10.1002/wcs.1210 | url = https://philpapers.org/rec/KLETCA-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major areas of interest include the nature of the relationship between [[memory]] and foresight,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Suddendorf T | title = Episodic memory versus episodic foresight: Similarities and differences | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 99–107 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 26272843 | doi = 10.1002/wcs.23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klein SB | title = Autonoetic consciousness: Reconsidering the role of episodic memory in future-oriented self-projection | journal = Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 381–401 | year = 2018 | pmid = 25606713 | doi = 10.1080/17470218.2015.1007150 | url = https://philpapers.org/rec/KLEAAR }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[evolution]] of the ability (including whether it is uniquely human or shared with other animals),&lt;ref name=Suddendorf2013&gt;{{cite book |last1=Suddendorf |first1=Thomas | name-list-format = vanc |title=The gap: the science of what separates us from other animals |publisher=Basic Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-465-03014-9 }}{{page needed|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cheke LG, Clayton NS | title = Mental time travel in animals | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 915–930 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 26271786 | doi = 10.1002/wcs.59 }}&lt;/ref&gt; its development in young children,&lt;ref name=pmid23855564&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Suddendorf T, Redshaw J | title = The development of mental scenario building and episodic foresight | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1296 | pages = 135–53 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23855564 | doi = 10.1111/nyas.12189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.lmot.2005.02.003 |title=The emergence of episodic future thinking in humans |journal=Learning and Motivation |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=126–144 |year=2005 |last1=Atance |first1=Cristina M. |last2=o'Neill |first2=Daniela K. | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; its underlying brain mechanisms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schacter DL, Addis DR, Hassabis D, Martin VC, Spreng RN, Szpunar KK | title = The future of memory: remembering, imagining, and the brain | journal = Neuron | volume = 76 | issue = 4 | pages = 677–94 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23177955 | pmc = 3815616 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2012.11.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Irish2016&gt;{{cite book |first1=Muireann |last1=Irish | name-list-format = vanc |chapter=Semantic Memory as the Essential Scaffold for Future-Oriented Mental Time Travel |pages=389–408 |chapterurl={{Google books|bkYnDAAAQBAJ|page=389|plainurl=yes}} |editor1-first=Kourken |editor1-last=Michaelian |editor2-first=Stanley B. |editor2-last=Klein |editor3-first=Karl K. |editor3-last=Szpunar |year=2016 |title=Seeing the Future: Theoretical Perspectives on Future-oriented Mental Time Travel |isbn=978-0-19-024153-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as its potential links to [[consciousness]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = D'Argembeau A, Van der Linden M | title = Predicting the phenomenology of episodic future thoughts | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 1198–206 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22742997 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2012.05.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[self]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = D'Argembeau A, Lardi C, Van der Linden M | title = Self-defining future projections: exploring the identity function of thinking about the future | journal = Memory | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 110–20 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22292616 | doi = 10.1080/09658211.2011.647697 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[free will]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seligman ME, Railton P, Baumeister RF, Sripada C | title = Navigating Into the Future or Driven by the Past | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 119–41 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 26172493 | doi = 10.1177/1745691612474317 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview, terminology, and relationship to other cognitive capacities ==

Traditionally, [[declarative memory]] refers to the capacity to store and retrieve information that can be explicitly expressed, and thus consists of both facts or knowledge about the world ([[semantic memory]]), as well as autobiographical details about one’s own experiences ([[episodic memory]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Squire LR | title = Declarative and nondeclarative memory: multiple brain systems supporting learning and memory | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 232–43 | year = 1992 | pmid = 23964880 | doi = 10.1162/jocn.1992.4.3.232 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tulving (1985) originally suggested that episodic memory involved a kind of ‘autonoetic’ (‘self-knowing’) consciousness that required the first-person [[subjective experience]] of previously lived events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tulving |first1=Endel | name-list-format = vanc |title=Elements of Episodic Memory |publisher=Oxford University |year=1985 |isbn=978-0-19-852125-9 }}{{page needed|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Semantic memory]], however, refers to memory for facts and is associated with ‘noetic’ (knowing) consciousness but does not require such mental simulation.

It has become increasingly clear that both semantic and episodic memory are integral for thinking about the future.&lt;ref name=pmid17963565&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Suddendorf T, Corballis MC | title = The evolution of foresight: What is mental time travel, and is it unique to humans? | journal = The Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 299–313; discussion 313–51 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17963565 | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X07001975 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Irish M, Addis DR, Hodges JR, Piguet O | title = Considering the role of semantic memory in episodic future thinking: evidence from semantic dementia | journal = Brain | volume = 135 | issue = Pt 7 | pages = 2178–91 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22614246 | doi = 10.1093/brain/aws119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental time travel, however, specifically refers to the ‘autonoetic’ systems, and thus selectively comprises episodic memory and episodic foresight.

The close link between episodic memory and episodic foresight has been established with evidence of their shared developmental trajectory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.lmot.2005.02.010 |title=Making decisions with the future in mind: Developmental and comparative identification of mental time travel |journal=Learning and Motivation |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=110–125 |year=2005 |last1=Suddendorf |first1=Thomas |last2=Busby |first2=Janie | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; similar impairment profiles in [[neuropsychiatric]] disease and in brain damage,&lt;ref name = "Schacter_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schacter DL, Addis DR | title = The cognitive neuroscience of constructive memory: remembering the past and imagining the future | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

==Brain regions involved==
Various [[neuroimaging]] studies have elucidated the [[brain]] systems underlying the capacity for mental time travel in adults. Early [[fMRI]] studies on the topic revealed a number of close correspondences between remembering past experiences and imagining future experiences in brain activity.&lt;ref name = "Okuda_2003" /&gt;

===fMRI mapping of brain regions===
Addis et al. conducted an [[fMRI]] study to examine neural regions mediating construction and elaboration of past and future events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Addis DR, Wong AT, Schacter DL | title = Remembering the past and imagining the future: common and distinct neural substrates during event construction and elaboration | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 45 | issue = 7 | pages = 1363–77 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17126370 | pmc = 1894691 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.10.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The left [[hippocampus]] and posterior [[visuospatial]] regions are involved in past and future event construction, neural differentiation. The right hippocampus, right frontopolar cortex, and the left [[ventrolateral prefrontal cortex]] are involved in future event construction.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The elaboration phase, unlike the construction phase, has overlap in the cortical areas comprising the autobiographical memory retrieval network. In this study, it was also found that the left hippocampus and the right middle [[Occiput|occipital]] [[gyrus]] were significantly activated during past and future event construction, while the right hippocampus was significantly deactivated during past event construction. It was only activated during the creation of future events.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Episodic future thinking involves multiple component processes: retrieval and integration of relevant information from memory, processing of subjective time, and self-referential processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = D'Argembeau A, Stawarczyk D, Majerus S, Collette F, Van der Linden M, Feyers D, Maquet P, Salmon E | title = The neural basis of personal goal processing when envisioning future events | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 22 | issue = 8 | pages = 1701–13 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 19642887 | doi = 10.1162/jocn.2009.21314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; D'Argembeau et al.'s study found that the ventral [[medial prefrontal cortex]] and [[posterior cingulate]] cortex are the most activated areas when imagining future events that are relevant to one's personal goals than to unrelated ones. This shows that these brain regions play a role in personal goal processing, which is a critical feature of episodic future thinking.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Brain regions involved in the 'what' and 'where' of an event===
Cabeza et al. conducted a [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) scan study on a group of human test subjects to identify the brain regions involved in [[Time|temporal]] memory, which is based on a linear progression of events. Since 'recollecting a past episode involves remembering not only what happened but also when it happened', PET scans were used to find the areas of the brain that were activated when trying to remember a certain word in a sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cabeza R, Mangels J, Nyberg L, Habib R, Houle S, McIntosh AR, Tulving E | title = Brain regions differentially involved in remembering what and when: a PET study | journal = Neuron | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 863–70 | date = October 1997 | pmid = 9354332 | doi = 10.1016/S0896-6273(00)80967-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results show that temporal memory of past events involves the frontal and posterior brain regions.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The ability to travel mentally in time – especially into the future – has been highlighted as a potential prime mover in [[human evolution]], enabling humans to prepare, plan and shape the future to their advantage.&lt;ref name=Suddendorf2013/&gt; However, the question of whether or to what extent animals other than human beings can engage in mental time travel has remained controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roberts WA | title = Are animals stuck in time? | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 128 | issue = 3 | pages = 473–89 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 12002698 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.128.3.473 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jonathan |last1=Redshaw |first2=Adam |last2=Bulley | name-list-format = vanc |chapter=Future-Thinking in Animals: Capacities and Limits |pages=31–51 |chapterurl={{Google books|srk8DwAAQBAJ|page=31|plainurl=yes}} |editor1-first=Gabriele |editor1-last=Oettingen |editor2-first=A.

If mental time travel is unique to humans, then it must have emerged over the last 6 million years since the line leading to modern humans split from the line leading to modern [[chimpanzees]]. Perhaps the first hard evidence for the evolution of mental time travel in humans comes in the form of [[Acheulean]] [[Biface|bifacial handaxes]] associated with [[Homo erectus]]. Acheulean tools are complex and appear to have required advanced planning to create.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wynn T, Coolidge FL | title = Archeological insights into hominin cognitive evolution | journal = Evolutionary Anthropology | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 200–13 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27519459 | doi = 10.1002/evan.21496 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/650296 |title=Coevolution of Composite‐Tool Technology, Constructive Memory, and Language |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=51 |pages=S135–S147 |year=2010 |last1=Ambrose |first1=Stanley H. | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that they were often crafted in one location and then taken elsewhere for repeated use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hallos J | title = "15 Minutes Of Fame": exploring the temporal dimension of middle pleistocene lithic technology | journal = Journal of Human Evolution | volume = 49 | issue = 2 | pages = 155–79 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 15964609 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhevol.2005.03.002 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.628.4393 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Episodic-like memory and planning for the future in great apes===
Osvath et al. conducted a study on apes to show that they have the ability of foresight. The study consisted of testing for self-control, [[associative learning]], and envisioning in chimpanzees and orangutans through a series of experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Osvath M | title = Great ape foresight is looking great | journal = Animal Cognition | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 777–81 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20607575 | doi = 10.1007/s10071-010-0336-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics questioned whether these animals truly exhibited mental time travel, or whether it was associative learning that caused them to behave as they did. The Bischof-Kohler hypothesis says that animals cannot anticipate future needs, and this study by Osvath tried to disprove the hypothesis.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The scientists showed that when the apes were presented with a food item in conjunction with a utensil that could be used to actually eat that particular food, these animals chose the utensil instead of food. They anticipated a future need for the utensil that overcame the current want for just a food reward. This is an example of mental time travel in animals. It was not a result of associative learning that they actually chose the utensil instead of the food reward since the scientists ran another experiment to account for that. Other examples, such as food caching by birds, may be examples of mental time travel in non-humans. Even survival instinct by certain animals such as elephants, in response to imminent danger, could involve mental time travel mechanisms.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Another study to show that great apes have the ability of foresight was conducted by Martin-Ordas G. et al. These scientists were able to show that 'apes remember in an integrated fashion what, where and when' a particular event had happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martin-Ordas G, Haun D, Colmenares F, Call J | title = Keeping track of time: evidence for episodic-like memory in great apes | journal = Animal Cognition | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 331–40 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 19784852 | pmc = 2822233 | doi = 10.1007/s10071-009-0282-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two experiments were conducted in this study-the first being an investigation of the content of the memories of apes i.e. could these animals remember when and where two types of food they were shown before were now hidden. The second experiment explored the structure of the memories. It was found that the apes' memories were formed in an integrated what–where–when structure. All these findings once again show that it is not instinctive or learning predispositions that made the animals behave the way they did; rather, they have the ability to mental time travel, just like humans can.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Episodic-like memory in western scrub-jays===
In their study to show that birds exhibit [[episodic-like memory]], Clayton et al. used 3 behavioral criteria: content, structure, and flexibility, to decide whether the food caching habits of these birds were evidence of their ability to recall the past and plan for the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clayton NS, Bussey TJ, Dickinson A | title = Can animals recall the past and plan for the future? | journal = Nature Reviews. Neuroscience | volume = 4 | issue = 8 | pages = 685–91 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12894243 | doi = 10.1038/nrn1180 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Content involved remembering what happened based on a specific past experience. Structure required the formation of a 'what-where-when' representation of the event. Finally, flexibility was used to see how well the information could be organized and re-organized, based on facts and experiences. Mental time travel involves the use of both episodic future thinking and semantic knowledge. This study also contradicts the Bischof-Kohler hypothesis by showing that some animals can mentally time travel into the future or back to the past.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Development in children==
Studies into the development of mental time travel in [[infancy]] suggest that the involved component processes come online piecemeal. Most of the required psychological subcomponents appear to be available by approximately age four.&lt;ref name=pmid23855564/&gt; This includes the fundamental capacity to prepare for two [[mutually exclusive]] possible future events, which appears to develop between the ages of 3 and 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Redshaw J, Suddendorf T | title = Children's and Apes' Preparatory Responses to Two Mutually Exclusive Possibilities | journal = Current Biology | volume = 26 | issue = 13 | pages = 1758–1762 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27345164 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2016.04.062 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two and three year-old children can report some information about upcoming events, and by ages four and five, children can talk more clearly about future situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/mpq.2006.0005 |title=The Development of Future Time Concepts Through Mother-Child Conversation |journal=Merrill-Palmer Quarterly |volume=52 |pages=70–95 |year=2006 |last1=Hudson |first1=Judith A. | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is concern that children may understand more than they can articulate, and that they may say things without fully understanding. Thus, researchers have tried to examine future-oriented action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/cdep.12128 |title=Young Children's Thinking About the Future |journal=Child Development Perspectives |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=178–182 |year=2015 |last1=Atance |first1=Cristina M. | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; A carefully controlled study found that four-year-olds could already remember a specific problem they saw in a different room sufficiently enough to prepare for its future solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Suddendorf T, Nielsen M, von Gehlen R | title = Children's capacity to remember a novel problem and to secure its future solution | journal = Developmental Science | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 26–33 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21159085 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2010.00950.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; These results suggest that children by the end of the [[preschool]] years have developed some fundamental capacity for foresight, capacities that continue to develop throughout [[childhood]] and [[adolescence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/mbe.12124 |title=The Neurocognitive Development of Episodic Prospection and its Implications for Academic Achievement |journal=Mind, Brain, and Education |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=196–206 |year=2016 |last1=Prabhakar |first1=Janani |last2=Coughlin |first2=Christine |last3=Ghetti |first3=Simona | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Organology''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ὄργανον}} – ''organon'', "instrument" and λόγος – ''logos'', "study") is the science of [[musical instrument]]s and their classification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.music.vt.edu/musicdictionary/texto/Organology.html Organology]&lt;/ref&gt; It embraces study of instruments' history, instruments used in different cultures, technical aspects of how instruments produce sound, and [[musical instrument classification]]. There is a degree of overlap between organology, [[ethnomusicology]] (being subsets of [[musicology]]) and the branch of the science of [[acoustics]] devoted to musical instruments.

==History==
A number of ancient cultures left documents detailing the musical instruments used and their role in society; these documents sometimes included a classification system. The first major documents on the subjects from the west, however, date from the 16th century, with works such as [[Sebastian Virdung]]'s ''Musica getuscht und ausgezogen'' (1511), and [[Martin Agricola]]'s ''Musica instrumentalis deudsch'' (1529).

One of the most important organologists of the 17th century is [[Michael Praetorius]]. His ''Syntagma musicum'' (1618) is one of the most quoted works from that time on the subject, and is the source of much of what we know about [[renaissance music|renaissance]] musical instruments. Praetorius's ''Theatrum instrumentorium'' (1620) contains possibly the first pictures of [[Africa]]n instruments in a European publication.

For much of the 18th and 19th centuries, little work was done on organology. Explorers returned to Europe with instruments from different cultures, however, so that by the end of the 19th century, some musical instrument collections were quite large. This led to a renewed interest in the subject.

One of the most important organologists of the 20th century was [[Curt Sachs]], who, as well as writing ''Real-Lexicon der Musikinstrumente'' (1913) and ''The History of Musical Instruments'' (1940), devised with [[Erich von Hornbostel]] the [[Hornbostel-Sachs]] scheme of instrument classification, which was first published in 1914 in the  Zeitschrift für Ethnologie([[Hornbostel–Sachs]]). This system classified musical instruments into four distinct categories: idiophones, membranophones, chordophones, and aerophones. &lt;ref&gt;Hornbostel, Erich M. von, and Curt Sachs. 1961. “Classi cation of Musical Instruments.” Translated by 
A. Baines and K. Wachsmann. ''The Galpin Society Journal'' 14:3–29.&lt;/ref&gt; This system of classification was updated several times by Sachs and Hornbostel and still continues to be updated periodically. &lt;ref&gt;Kartomi, Margaret J. “Part One: On the Nature of Classification of Musical Instruments.” In ''On Concepts and Classifications of Musical Instruments'', 1-31. London: Univ. of Chicago, 1990. Pp.172&lt;/ref&gt; One update to the system was made by Sachs in 1940 through the addition of a 5th category-electrophones, a category encompassing instruments which produce music electronically.&lt;ref&gt;Kartomi, Margaret J. “Part One: On the Nature of Classification of Musical Instruments.” In ''On Concepts and Classifications of Musical Instruments'', 1-31. London: Univ. of Chicago, 1990. Pp.172&lt;/ref&gt; Sachs' 1940 book, ''The History of Musical Instruments'' was meant to be a comprehensive compilation of descriptions of instruments from many cultures and their functions within their societies. &lt;ref&gt;Sachs, Curt.''The History of Musical Instruments''. New York: Norton, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; The book is primarily divided into four chronological periods of instruments- early instruments, antiquity, the middle ages, and the modern occident. These periods are further subdivided into regions and then to significant time periods within those regions.&lt;ref&gt;Sachs, Curt.''The History of Musical Instruments''. New York: Norton, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[Andre Schaeffner]] introduced a system based on state-of-matter of the sound-producing mechanism, giving rise to two top-level categories: solid (containing strings and percussion), and gas (containing woodwind and brass).&lt;ref&gt;Kartomi (1990) On Concepts and Classifications of Musical Instruments, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, xix + 329 pp&lt;/ref&gt; With the invention of [[hydraulophone]], the physics-based organology has been expanded to use solid, liquid, and gas, wherein the top-level category is the state-of-matter of the material that makes the sound. Reference to Kartomi's book, page 173.

A number of societies exist dedicated to the study of musical instruments. Among the more prominent are the [[Galpin Society]], based in the [[United Kingdom]]; and the [[American Musical Instrument Society]], based in the [[United States]].

==Outside Perspectives on the Sachs-Hornbostel Classification System==
According to one paper written by Henry M. Johnson published by the University of Oxford, “the universally used classification system established by musical instruments of Hornbostel and Sachs has become the paradigm of organology in many cultures”. &lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Henry M. “An Ethnomusicology of Musical Instruments: Form, Function, and Meaning.” ''Journal of the Anthropological Society of Oxford'' 26, no. 3 (1995): 257-69.
Pp.261&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, Eliot Bates states in a paper published in the Journal of the Society of Ethnomusicology that “The Hornbostel-Sachs system was not intended to classify the specificity of unique instruments, but rather to highlight commonalities across the world of instruments.” &lt;ref&gt;Bates, Eliot. “The Social Life of Musical Instruments.” ''Ethnomusicology'' 56, no. 3 (2012): 363-395. Pp.379&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Alternative Perspectives on the Classification of Musical Instruments==
Margaret Kartomi, professor and chairperson in the Department of Music at Monash University in Melbourne, approached the topic of musical instrument classification in 1990 with the intention of understanding how musical instruments are classified across cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Kartomi, Margaret J. “Part One: On the Nature of Classification of Musical Instruments.” In ''On Concepts and Classifications of Musical Instruments'', 1-31. London: Univ. of Chicago, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach was justified by her observation that the concepts upon which an outside European researcher might classify musical instruments of a particular culture are likely different from the way that those native to the culture choose to classify their musical instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Kartomi, Margaret J. “Part One: On the Nature of Classification of Musical Instruments.” In ''On Concepts and Classifications of Musical Instruments'', 1-31. London: Univ. of Chicago, 1990. Pp.xv&lt;/ref&gt; Her book emphasizes the complexity that underlies the process of classifying musical instruments, as the classification system is often shaped by “socially influenced or structured ideas or belief systems”. &lt;ref&gt;Kartomi, Margaret J. “Part One: On the Nature of Classification of Musical Instruments.” In ''On Concepts and Classifications of Musical Instruments'', 1-31. London: Univ. of Chicago, 1990. Pp.271&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connections to Ethnomusicology== 
The 8th edition of UCLA’s publication on Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology published in 1990 was devoted to Issues in Organology. The first paper in the journal written by Sue Carole DeVale entitled “Organizing Organology” attempted to provide a more comprehensive system for defining the study of organology, particularly within the context of ethnomusicology.&lt;ref&gt;DeVale, Sue Carole. “Organizing Organology.” ‘’Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology’’ 8 (1990): 1-34. Pp.3&lt;/ref&gt; DeVale defines organology as “the science of sound instruments”.&lt;ref&gt;DeVale, Sue Carole. “Organizing Organology.” ''Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology'' 8 (1990): 1-34. Pp.4&lt;/ref&gt; The word choice in this definition is very intentional- DeVale avoids the use of the term “music” or “musical” but rather "sound" because the function of some instruments, such as the Balinese slit drum, serves to signal an event rather than aid in a musical performance.&lt;ref&gt;DeVale, Sue Carole. “Organizing Organology.” ''Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology'' 8 (1990): 1-34. Pp.4-5&lt;/ref&gt; She also defines three primary branches-classificatory, analytical, and applied- that serve as the basis for the study of organology.&lt;ref&gt;DeVale, Sue Carole. “Organizing Organology.” ''Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology'' 8 (1990): 1-34. Pp.5&lt;/ref&gt; The classificatory branch essentially encompasses all of the ways in which musical instruments have been categorized, both cross-culturally and through cultural-specific systems.&lt;ref&gt;DeVale, Sue Carole. “Organizing Organology.” ''Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology'' 8 (1990): 1-34. Pp.6&lt;/ref&gt; The analytical branch contains the body of work done on analyzing specific aspects of sound instruments and the cultural context/implications of the instruments.&lt;ref&gt;DeVale, Sue Carole. “Organizing Organology.” ''Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology'' 8 (1990): 1-34. Pp.15&lt;/ref&gt; The applied branch is the aspects of organology that exist within the realm of museum work that involves the preservation of musical instruments, as well as instrument making.&lt;ref&gt;DeVale, Sue Carole. “Organizing Organology.” ''Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology'' 8 (1990): 1-34. Pp.27&lt;/ref&gt; Devale also emphasizes throughout the paper the importance of the connections which exist between the three branches, as it is often essential to consider aspects of organology within all of three branches when doing work or research of any kind within the field.&lt;ref&gt;DeVale, Sue Carole. “Organizing Organology.” ''Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology'' 8 (1990): 1-34. Pp.27&lt;/ref&gt; She states that “these branches are independent in theory, but in practice, research and processes conducted with and on instruments and their sounds continuously flow between them and permeate the whole.”&lt;ref&gt;DeVale, Sue Carole. “Organizing Organology.” ''Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology'' 8 (1990): 1-34. Pp.27&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable paper on the topic of the connection between ethnomusicology and organology was written by Henry M. Johnson and published in 1995 in the Journal of the Anthropological Society of Oxford. This paper sought to demonstrate the contribution that the field of ethnomusicology can make to the study of musical instruments. Johnson defines four facets of the connection between ethnomusicology and organology- form, context, performance environment, and the interrelationship between instrument, performer and sound object.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Henry M. “An Ethnomusicology of Musical Instruments: Form, Function, and Meaning.” 
''Journal of the Anthropological Society of Oxford'' 26, no. 3 (1995): 257-69. Pp.258&lt;/ref&gt; These categories were meant to provide a more detailed look at the cultural significance of musical instruments. Johnson states, “Ethnomusicology can… produce a study of the instruments that includes an examination of the interrelationship between the material object, its context and its music, together with an understanding of the meanings connected with each of these areas in specific and general environments (i.e. the contexts in which a sound-producing instrument is played or understood)”.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Henry M. “An Ethnomusicology of Musical Instruments: Form, Function, and Meaning.” ''Journal of the Anthropological Society of Oxford'' 26, no. 3 (1995): 257-69. Pp.258&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2012, Eliot Bates of Cornell University approached the topic of the ethnomusicological study of musical instruments by focusing specifically on what he terms “the social life of musical instruments”.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Eliot. “The Social Life of Musical Instruments.” Ethnomusicology 56, no. 3 (2012): 363-395. Pp.364&lt;/ref&gt;Bates argues that “‘the social’ has not been adequately studied and theorized because of a paucity of attention given to how social relations are mobilized around material objects and the thing-power that they possess.”&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Eliot. “The Social Life of Musical Instruments.” Ethnomusicology 56, no. 3 (2012): 363-395. Pp.364&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, Bates states that material objects often hold significant social value. It is important to study the object not necessarily for the sake of categorization or understanding the way that it is played or how it works but the meaning that it holds for the musician and the audience.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8526">'''Photodegradation''' is the alteration of materials by light.  Typically, the term refers to the combined action of  [[sunlight]] and [[air]]. Photodegradation is usually [[oxidation]] and [[hydrolysis]].  Often photodegradation is avoided, since it destroys paintings and other artifacts. It is however partly responsible for remineralization of biomass and is used intentionally in some disinfection technologies. Photodegradation does not apply to how materials may be aged or degraded via [[infrared light]] or heat, but does include degradation in all of the [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet light]] wavebands.

==Applications==

===Foodstuffs===
The protection of food from photodegradation is very important. Some nutrients, like those found in [[beer]] for example, are affected by degradation when being exposed to sunlight. In the case of beer, the UV radiation causes a process, which entails the degradation of hop bitter compounds to 3-Methyl-2-buten-1-thiol and therefore changes the taste. As amber glass has the ability to absorb UV radiation, beer bottles are often made from this glass type to avoid this process.

=== Paints, inks and dyes ===
Paints, inks and dyes that are organic are more susceptible to photodegradation than those that are not. Ceramics are almost universally colored with non-organic origin materials so as to allow the material to resist photodegradation even under the most relentless conditions, maintaining its color.

===Pesticides and herbicides ===
The photodegradation of pesticides is of great interest because of the scale of agriculture and the intensive use of chemicals.  Pesticides are however selected in part not to photodegrade readily in sunlight in order to allow them to exert their biocidal activity.  Thus, additional modalities are implemented to enhance their photodegradation, including the use of photosensitizers, photocatalysts (e.g., [[titanium dioxide]]), and the addition of reagents such as [[hydrogen peroxide]] that would generate hydroxyl radicals that would attack the pesticides.&lt;ref name=burrows&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burrows|first1=H.D.|last2=Canle L|first2=M.|last3=Santaballa|first3=J.A.|last4=Steenken|first4=S.|title=Reaction pathways and mechanisms of photodegradation of pesticides|journal=Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology|date=June 2002|volume=67|issue=2|pages=71–108|doi=10.1016/S1011-1344(02)00277-4|hdl=10316/5187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharmaceuticals===
The photodegradation of pharmaceuticals is of interest because they are found in many water supplies.  They have deleterious effects on aquatic organisms including toxicity, endocrine disruption, genetic damage.&lt;ref name=boreen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boreen|first1=Anne L.|last2=Arnold|first2=William A.|last3=McNeill|first3=Kristopher|title=Photodegradation of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment: A review|journal=Aquatic Sciences|date=1 December 2003|volume=65|issue=4|pages=320–341|doi=10.1007/s00027-003-0672-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; But also in the primary packaging material the photodegradation of pharmaceuticals has to be prevented. For this, amber [[glasses]] like [[Fiolax |Fiolax amber]] and Corning 51-L are commonly used to protect the pharmaceutical from UV radiations. Iodine (in the form of [[Lugol's solution]]) and collodial silver are universally used in packaging that lets through very little UV light so as to avoid degradation.

===Polymers===
{{main|Photo-oxidation of polymers}}
[[Image:Failedrope1.jpg|thumb|300px|Effect of UV exposure on [[polypropylene]] rope]]
Common synthetic polymers that can be attacked include [[polypropylene]] and [[LDPE]], where [[tertiary carbon]] bonds in their chain structures are the centres of attack. Ultraviolet rays interact with these bonds to form [[free radicals]], which then react further with [[oxygen]] in the atmosphere, producing [[carbonyl]] groups in the main chain. The exposed surfaces of products may then discolour and crack, and in extreme cases, complete product disintegration can occur. 

In fibre products like [[rope]] used in outdoor applications, product life will be low because the outer fibres will be attacked first, and will easily be damaged by [[abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]] for example. Discolouration of the rope may also occur, thus giving an early warning of the problem. 

Polymers which possess UV-absorbing groups such as [[aromatic ring]]s may also be sensitive to UV degradation. [[Aramid]] fibres like [[Kevlar]], for example, are highly UV-sensitive and must be protected from the deleterious effects of sunlight.

==Mechanism==
[[File:Fotodegradazione secchio plastica usato come vaso da fiori.png|thumb|Photodegradation of a plastic bucket used as an open-air flowerpot for some years]]
Many organic chemicals are thermodynamically unstable in the presence of oxygen, however, their rate of spontaneous oxidation is slow at room temperature.  In the language of physical chemistry, such reactions are kinetically limited.  This kinetic stability allows the accumulation of complex environmental structures in the environment. Upon the absorption of light, triplet oxygen converts to [[singlet oxygen]], a highly reactive form of the gas, which effects spin-allowed oxidations.  In the atmosphere, the organic compounds are degraded by [[hydroxyl radical]]s, which are produced from water and ozone.&lt;ref name=Simmler&gt;Walter Simmler "Air, 6. Photochemical Degradation" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2011, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.&lt;/ref&gt;

Photochemical reactions are initiated by the absorption of a photon, typically in the wavelength range 290-700&amp;nbsp;nm (at the surface of the Earth).  The energy of an absorbed photon is transferred to electrons in the molecule and briefly changes their configuration (i.e., promotes the molecule from a [[ground state]] to an [[excited state]]).  The excited state represents what is essentially a new molecule.  Often excited state molecules are not kinetically stable in the presence of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and can spontaneously decompose ([[oxidize]] or [[hydrolyze]]).  Sometimes molecules decompose to produce high energy, unstable fragments that can react with other molecules around them.  The two processes are collectively referred to as direct photolysis or indirect [[photolysis]], and both mechanisms contribute to the removal of pollutants.

The United States federal standard for testing plastic for photo-degradation is 40 CFR Ch. I (7–1–03 Edition)PART 238

==Protection against photodegradation==
Photodegradation of plastics and other materials can be inhibited with additives, which are widely used.  These additives include [[antioxidant]]s, which interrupt degradation processes.  Typical antioxidants are derivatives of [[aniline]].  Another type of additive are UV-absorbers.  These agents capture the photon and convert it to heat.  Typical UV-absorbers are hydroxy-substituted [[benzophenone]]s, related to the chemicals used in [[sunscreen]].&lt;ref name=Wolf&gt;Rainer Wolf, Bansi Lal Kaul "Plastics, Additives" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2000, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Planctomycetes''' are a [[phylum]] of aquatic [[bacteria]]  and are found in samples of [[brackish water|brackish]], and [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] and [[fresh water|fresh]] [[water]]. They reproduce by [[budding]]. In structure, the organisms of this group are [[oval (geometry)|ovoid]] and have a [[holdfast]], at the tip of a thin cylindrical extension from the cell body called the stalk, at the nonreproductive end that helps them to attach to each other during budding.

[[Cavalier-Smith]] has postulated that the Planctomycetes are within the clade [[Planctobacteria]] in the larger clade [[Gracilicutes]], but this is not generally accepted.

==Structure==
For a long time bacteria belonging to this group were considered to lack [[peptidoglycan]], (also called murein) in their [[cell wall]]s, which is an important [[heteropolymer]] present in most [[bacteria]]l cell walls that serves as a protective component. It was thought that instead their walls were made up of [[glycoprotein]] which is rich in [[glutamate]]. Recently, however, representatives of all three clades within the Planctomycetes were found to possess peptidoglycan-containing cell walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Jeske, O., Schueler, M., Schumann, P., Schneider, A., Boedeker, C., Jogler, M.,  Bollschweiler, D., Rohde, M., Mayer, C., Engelhardt, H., Spring, S. &amp; Jogler, C.|year=2015|title=Planctomycetes do possess a peptidoglycan cell wall |journal=Nature Communications|volume=6|doi=10.1038/ncomms8116|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150512/ncomms8116/full/ncomms8116.html|pmid=25964217|pages=7116|pmc=4432640}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=van Teeseling, M.C.F., Mesman, R.J., Kuru, E., Espaillat, A., Cava, F., Brun, Y.V., VanNieuwenhze, M.S., Kartal, B &amp; van Niftrik, L.|year=2015|title=Anammox Planctomycetes have a peptidoglycan cell wall |journal=Nature Communications|volume=6|doi=10.1038/ncomms7878|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150512/ncomms7878/full/ncomms7878.html|pages=6878|pmid=25962786|pmc=4432595}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planctomycetes have a distinctive [[bacterial morphology|morphology]] with the appearance of [[cell membrane|membrane]]-bound internal compartments, often referred to as the ''paryphoplasm'' (ribosome-free space), ''pirellulosome'' (ribosome-containing space) and ''nucleoid'' (condensed nucleic acid region, in these species surrounded by a double membrane).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

One 2013 study found the appearance of internal compartments to be due to a densely invaginated but continuous single membrane, concluding that only the two compartments typical of [[Gram-negative]] bacteria - the [[cytoplasm]] and [[periplasm]] - are present. However, the excess membrane triples the surface area of the cell relative to its volume, which may be related to ''Gemmata's'' [[sterol]] biosynthesis abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Santarella-Mellwig, R., Pruggnaller, S., Roos, N., Mattaj, I., &amp; Devos, D.|year=2013|title=Three-Dimensional Reconstruction of Bacteria with a Complex Endomembrane System|journal=PLoS Biology|volume=11|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001565|url=http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001565|pmid=23700385|pages=e1001565|pmc=3660258}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 study using similar methods reported confirmation of the earlier enclosed compartment hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

It has recently been shown that ''Gemmata obscuriglobus'' is able to take in large molecules via a process which in some ways resembles [[endocytosis]], the process used by eukaryotic cells to engulf external items.&lt;ref name=Lonhienne2010&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lonhienne |first=Thierry G.

==Molecular Signatures==

Although the ''Planctomycetes'' are renowned for their unusual cellular characteristics, their distinctness from all other bacteria is additionally supported by the shared presence of two [[conserved signature indels]] (CSIs).&lt;ref name=Gupta2012&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gupta RS, Bhandari V, Naushad HS |title=Molecular Signatures for the PVC Clade (Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, Chlamydiae, and Lentisphaerae) of Bacteria Provide Insights into Their Evolutionary Relationships |journal=Front Microbiol |volume=3 |issue= |pages=327 |year=2012 |pmid=23060863 |pmc=3444138 |doi=10.3389/fmicb.2012.00327 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These CSIs demarcate the group from neighboring phyla within the [[PVC group]].&lt;ref name=pmid27279642&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gupta RS |title=Impact of genomics on the understanding of microbial evolution and classification: the importance of Darwin's views on classification |journal= FEMS Microbiol Rev |volume=40|issue=4|pages=520–53 |date=2016|pmid=27279642 |doi=10.1093/femsre/fuw011 |url=http://femsre.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/06/07/femsre.fuw011.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional CSI has been found that is shared by all ''Planctomycetes'' species, with the exception of ''[[Kuenenia stuttgartiensis]]'', which is in line with the observation that ''K. stuttgartiensis'' forms a deep branch within the phylum.

A [[conserved signature indel]] has also been found to be shared by the entire [[PVC group]], including Planctomycetes.&lt;ref name=Gupta2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid27279642/&gt; Planctomycetes also harbours an important conserved signature protein that has been characterized to play an important housekeeping function that is exclusive to members belonging to the PVC clade.&lt;ref name=pmid24185849&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lagkouvardos I, Jehl MA, Rattei T, Horn M |title= Signature protein of the PVC superphylum |journal=Appl Environ Microbiol |volume=80|issue=2|pages=440–445 |date=2014|pmid=24185849 |doi=10.1128/AEM.02655-13|pmc=3911108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life cycle==
The [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] of many planctomycetes involves alternation between [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] cells and [[flagellum|flagellated]] swarmer cells. The sessile cells bud to form the flagellated swarmer cells which swim for a while before settling down to attach and begin reproduction.

The '''Plant DNA C-values Database''' is a comprehensive catalogue of [[C-value]] ([[cell nucleus|nuclear]] [[DNA]] content, or in [[diploid]]s, [[genome size]]) data for [[Embryophyte|land plants]] and [[algae]].  The database was created by [[Michael D. Bennett|Prof. Michael D. Bennett]] and Dr. Ilia J. Leitch of the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], [[United Kingdom|UK]].  The database was originally launched as the "Angiosperm DNA C-values Database" in April 1997, essentially as an online version of collected data lists that had been published by Prof. Bennett and colleagues since the 1970s.  Release 1.0 of the more inclusive Plant DNA C-values Database was launched in 2001, with subsequent releases 2.0 in January 2003 and 3.0 in December 2004.  In addition to the [[angiosperm]] dataset made available in 1997, the database has been expanded [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomically]] several times and now includes data from [[pteridophytes]] (since 2000), [[gymnosperms]] (since 2001), [[bryophytes]] (since 2001), and algae (since 2004) (see [http://www.rbgkew.org.uk/cval/updates.html (1)] for update history).  (Note that each of these subset databases is cited individually as they may contain different sets of authors).  As of September 2005, the database as a whole contains data for over 4,800 [[species]] of [[plants]] in these various [[taxa]].  A similar [[Animal Genome Size Database]] was created in 2001 by [[T. Ryan Gregory|Dr. T. Ryan Gregory]] of the [[University of Guelph]], [[Canada]].

[[File:testedlabel.jpg|thumb|right|A common label for certifying that a device has been tested.]]
'''Portable appliance testing''' (commonly known as "PAT", "PAT inspection" or ([[RAS syndrome|redundantly]]) as "PAT testing") is the name of a process in the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mrengineers.co.uk/pat-testing|title=PAT Testing {{!}} Gas Safety Certificate from £30 Inc VAT|website=www.mrengineers.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Republic of Ireland, New Zealand and Australia by which electrical appliances are routinely checked for safety. The formal term for the process is "in-service inspection &amp; testing of electrical equipment".  Testing involves a [[visual inspection]] of the equipment and any flexible cables for good condition, and also where required, verification of earthing (grounding) continuity, and a test of the soundness of insulation between the current carrying parts, and any exposed metal that may be touched. The formal limits for pass/fail of these electrical tests vary somewhat depending on the category of equipment being tested.

Similar procedures exist in other countries, for example, testing of  equipment according to ''DGUV Vorschrift 3'' in Germany.

==Purpose==
[[Health and safety]] regulations require that electrical appliances are safe and maintained to prevent harm to workers.  Many equipment manufacturers recommend testing at regular intervals to ensure continual safety; the interval between tests depending on both the type of appliance and the environment in which it is to be used. The European Low Voltage Directive governs the manufacture or importation of electrical appliances. Compliance to this has to be declared and indicated by the display of the CE mark on the product. The responsibility for this lies with the manufacturer or the importer and is policed by Trading Standards.

Testing equipment has been specifically developed for PAT inspections, based on the testing equipment used by manufacturers to ensure compliance with the [[British Standard Code of Practice]] and European product standards relevant to that type of appliance. This in turn allows testing and the interpretation of results to be de-skilled to a large extent. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The inspection of the appliances can largely be carried out in-house in many organisations. This can result in cost savings and more flexibility as to exactly when a PAT is carried out.

==Origin of name==
Portable appliance testing is abbreviated as PAT. The correct term for the whole process is "In-service Inspection &amp; Testing of Electrical Equipment" (as defined by IET/IEE and City and Guilds).

In Australia and New Zealand, the common name for PAT is simply 'Test and Tag'. The regulatory guidelines are set out in AS/NZS3760:2010.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

==UK legal obligations==

===Appliances===
British law (the [[Health and safety regulations in the United Kingdom|Electricity at Work Regulations 1989]]) requires that all electrical systems (including electrical appliances) are maintained (so far as is reasonably practicable) to prevent danger. Private houses are not covered by this legislation, although [[occupiers' liability in English law|occupiers' liability]] requires householders not to deliberately expose occupants or visitors to unreasonable risks. The HSE and the local authority are responsible for the policing of this legislation.

===Fixed wiring in buildings===
Guidance from the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] (IET, published under the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers|IEE]] brand) and the [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) recommends that a competent person must inspect the installation regularly in any public building or a place that people work. They suggest initial intervals for combined inspection and testing that range from three months (for construction equipment) to one year, and in many cases, longer periods for re-testing (certain types of appliance in schools, hotels, offices and shops).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg236.pdf Health and Safety Executive, Electrical safety and you]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[Health and safety regulations in the United Kingdom|Electricity at Work Regulations 1989]] is an obligation on UK businesses, there is no obligation to undertake PAT inspection.  In reality neither act nor their corresponding regulations and associated statutory instruments detail PAT inspection as an obligation, but rather impose a requirement of maintenance of safety and evidence of [[planned maintenance|routine maintenance]] for all hand-held, portable and plug-in equipment.

Today a great many private companies and other organizations do meet their legal obligations to protect their workers by an enforced PAT regime, but it is not the only route.

Recent HSE publications have relaxed their tone somewhat to acknowledge this, and now point out that in many situations annual PAT is disproportionate to the risks and is often not required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg236.pdf Maintaining portable electric equipment in low-risk environment]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the HSE reviewed its approach to portable appliance maintenance in its own offices. Thinking about the type of equipment in use, and how it was used, the HSE looked back at the results from its annual testing of portable appliances across its estate over the last five years. Using the results of the previous tests, the HSE decided that further portable appliance tests are not needed within the foreseeable future or at all for certain types of portable equipment. Also, they decided to continue to monitor any faults reported as a result of user checks and visual inspections and review its maintenance system if evidence suggests that it needs revising. Electrical equipment will continue to be maintained by a series of user checks and visual inspections by staff that have had some training.

Annual portable appliance testing is not always necessary in low risk environments.
You do not need to be qualified as an electrician to carry out visual inspections.
Regular user checks and visual inspections can be a good method of maintaining portable electric equipment.
For landlords maintaining legal requirements it is not compulsory for them to have all appliances tested, but they do need to show a "duty of care" and most letting agents recommend that a test certificate is obtained.&lt;ref&gt;http://electricians-portsmouth.co.uk/electrical-landlord-certificates-need-know/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins in UK ==

The earliest formal portable appliance testing and inspection of both electrical installations and high risk equipment was introduced in the UK in government estates.  This was under the control of the [[Property Services Agency]] – prior to 1972 the [[Ministry of Public Building and Works]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} In some cases testing was conducted on a three-month (high-risk) and six-month (low-risk) cycle from the early 1960s onwards. Extensive record-keeping was made into log-books and generally the equipment used was an insulation resistance tester, simple hand tools and visual inspection. Evidence of testing was clearly visible to workers in the form of "passed", "tested for electrical safety" and "do not use after..." labels affixed to various parts of the electrical equipment used. This early testing and inspection was done under a planned maintenance scheme and pre-dated both the [[Health and Safety at Work Act 1974]] and the [[Electricity at Work Act 1989]].

==Site and campus requirements, events and contractors==

In the UK there is no legal instrument that requires a sub-contractor to ensure that all tools and equipment are PAT inspected before bringing onto a site of work.  Neither is there any legal instrument which obliges the site owner to ensure third-party equipment is PAT inspected either by themselves or the equipment owner.

The internal policies of many UK businesses and educational establishments make mistaken reference to PAT inspection being a legal requirement under the Electricity at Work Regulations, which is false.  Having such a policy is legitimate for internal reasons, but it is not underwritten by law, it is only their interpretation.  Therefore, it is not a legal requirement to have a PAT inspection sticker or certificate, the obligation is that equipment must be safe.

The HSE recommend policies use phrases such as "Equipment that is brought onto site for an event must be in a safe condition" and refrain from overzealous statements such as "must be PAT inspected" which can be restrictive without improving safety.  Overall it is safer if a competent person makes a visual inspection than if a layman merely observes the presence of a sticker.

==Carrying out PAT ==

This can be done by hiring an external company to test all the electrical products in a business (someone who has had some PAT training, either by an official qualification or by attending a health and safety course offered by some electrical health and safety companies) or it can be done in-house by a competent person.  In a low-risk environment most dangerous defects can be found simply by checking the appliances for obvious signs of damage such as frayed cables.

===User checks===
Advising the user of potential danger signs can result in problems being picked up before they can result in any danger. For example, if the power cable is frayed or the plug is cracked, users need to be advised not to use the appliance and report the fault to a supervisor. This information can be put across, say by the use of a poster or in a memo. User checks are always carried out before operation, and the results are generally not recorded, unless a defect is identified.

===Formal visual inspections===
This is a process of simply inspecting the appliance, the cable and the plug for any obvious signs of damage. According to the HSE, this process can find more than 90% of faults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energysafety.govt.nz/about/publications/accident-summaries Faults and electrical safety]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combined inspections and PAT ===
At periodic intervals, the portable appliances are tested to measure that the degree of protection to ensure that it is adequate. At these intervals, a formal visual inspection is carried out and then followed by PAT testing. Note the inside of the plug should be checked unless it is moulded or there is an unbroken seal covering the screws (bad internal wiring or an unsuitable fuse would cause the item to be classed as dangerous).

==Testing==

The tests an appliance is required to undergo will depend on the type of appliance, its electrical [[Appliance classes|Class]] and subject to a risk assessment by the technician. e.g. it may not be safe to perform a leakage current test which powers up the appliance, such as a grinder, if it can not be secured to a bench; an insulation resistance test may be a safe option.

===Earth resistance test===
This test shows the resistance offered by the earthing rods with the connection leads. Various testing instruments are available for earthing resistance tests. The earthing resistance should be less than 1Ω.

===Earth continuity test===
The equipment shall have a measured resistance of the [[Protective earth|protective earth circuit]], or the earthing conductor of an extension cord or appliance cord set, which does not exceed 1Ω.&lt;ref&gt;Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 “''In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Sec 2.3.3.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Testing is performed using an ohmmeter or [[Portable Appliance Test|PAT]] tester;
* Using the ohmmeter to produce a reading;
* Using a PAT tester under the following conditions;
** 12V maximum, test current range 100mA to 200mA - commonly known as "earth continuity test" or "screen test" 
** 12V maximum, test current 10A - commonly known as "routine test" 
** 12V maximum, 1.5 times rated current of appliance or 25A, whichever is greater - commonly known as "type test" or "bond test".

The choice of which of the tests to use is at the operator's discretion as there is merit in each test for given situations.  Later model testers that are battery powered are limited to doing the "screen test". Older mains powered units can do all tests. Even "type testing" may only be testing at a fraction of the operational power of the unit.The power dissipated in the earth is only 300 watts compared to operational power which may be in excess of 2000 watts.

===Insulation resistance test===

A leakage current test performed at rated voltage with values not exceeding 5mA for [[Appliance classes|Class I]] appliances or 1mA for [[Appliance classes|Class II]] appliances.&lt;ref&gt;Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 “''In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Sec 2. 3.3.2(a)&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, measure [[Electrical insulation|insulation resistance]] values are not less than 1MΩ for Class I and Class II appliances at 500 V d.c. or alternatively, to avoid the equipment apparently failing the test because the [[Surge protector|metal oxide varistors]] (MOVs), or electro-magnetic interference (EMI) suppression has triggered, for equipment containing voltage limiting devices such as MOVs, or EMI suppression, at 250 V d.c.&lt;ref&gt;Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 “''In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Sec 2.3.3.2(b). General&lt;/ref&gt;

Leakage current testing is performed using a PAT by applying a nominal voltage to the live conductors (active and neutral) of an appliance, and placing 0 volt reference on the earthed parts of a Class I appliance or the external metal parts of a [[Appliance classes|Class II]] appliance;
* Nominal voltage is 230V AC. (therefore it can not be performed with a digital multimeter)

Insulation resistance testing is performed using an ohmmeter or portable appliance tester by applying a nominal voltage to the live conductors (active and neutral) of an appliance, and placing 0 volt reference on the earthed parts of a [[Appliance classes|Class I]] appliance or the external metal parts of a [[Appliance classes|Class II]] appliance;
* Nominal voltage is 500V d.c (250 V d.c. may be used for equipment containing [[Surge protector|MOVs]] / EMI filtering)

A deficiency of the insulation resistance (500V/250V d.c) test is that the d.c voltage will not activate electromagnetic switches or internal relays etc. that are common in many modern power tools, computers, TVs etc. and therefore it can only test the appliance up to that point. Appliances with these components / design should be tested using the leakage current test.

===Polarity check===
In countries where the sockets are polarised, polarity testing is a simple test that can be carried out using a polarity tester to determine whether the active and neutral of the plug end are correctly connected to the corresponding terminals at the socket end.&lt;ref&gt;BS7671 wiring rules OR Best Practices in Testing &amp; Tagging of Electrical Equipment to AS/NZS 3760:2003. (Zahra &amp; Virieux 2007) 5.8.1&lt;/ref&gt; Note: The earth is tested during the [[#Earth continuity test|earth continuity test]]. In the UK, as per BS7671, the phase ('Live' or 'Hot') cable should connect with right hand side terminal of the socket (if we face the socket outlet).

====Plugs====
*The order ([[Electrical polarity|polarity]]) of the pins of a three pin flat pin plug, to their connections, shall be Earth (radial pin – green/yellow wire), Neutral (light blue wire) and then Active (brown wire), in a clockwise direction, when viewed from the front of the plug looking at the pins.&lt;ref&gt;Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 “''In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Sec 2.3.3.5(a). General&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cord extension sockets====
*The order ([[Electrical polarity|polarity]]) of the socket apertures of a three pin flat pin socket, to their connections, shall be Earth (radial pin – green/yellow wire), Active (brown wire) and then Neutral (light blue wire), in a clockwise direction, when viewed from the front of the socket looking at the apertures.&lt;ref&gt;Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 “''In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Sec 2.3.3.5(b). General&lt;/ref&gt;

===RCDs / ELCBs / Safety Switches===
There are two tests methods to be used;

====Press button====
This test requires specific test equipment RCD tester:

(the TEST button referred to here is the test button on the RCD tester NOT the TEST button on the RCD itself. If the RCD is live, pressing the RCD's own TEST button should ALWAYS trip the RCD).

The RCD tester should be connected with the socket, with earth terminal (must !!) and 
1)select the testing range 'delta' (10mA,30mA,100mA,300mA,500mA).
2)Select half delta range, and press TEST button - the RCD should not operate, this ensures against nuisance tripping.
3)Select delta range, and press TEST button - The RCD should operate, within m Sec for 50&amp;nbsp;Hz,230V system (as per BS 7671)

====Applied current====
This test requires specialised test equipment, knowledge and training;
*A current, equal to the rated tripping current, shall be “suddenly” applied between active and protective earth and the operating time measured&lt;ref&gt;Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 “''In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Appendix D D3&lt;/ref&gt; with maximum trip time 40ms for Type I and 300ms for Type II.

In addition to this, many technicians also test;
*using 1/2 (half) the rated tripping current to detect nuisance tripping.
*using 5 times rated tripping current, with trip times reduced accordingly, to simulate high current exposure.
* under 0 degree and 180 degree phases

Best Practice is to test the RCD under 1/2, 1X and 5X rated tripping current, each at both the 0 degree and 180 degree phases.

===Microwave ovens===
There are two specific extra checks mandated for microwave ovens in the United Kingdom.

The first is that the device immediately ceases production of the microwave radiation when the door is opened, which checks that the safety interlock systems are functional; and the second is that any leakage when operating is less than 5 mWcm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; which indicates that the door and casing are not distorted and any seals are intact so that there is no hazard to those in the vicinity of the equipment.

A piece of calibrated equipment is required for these tests to detect and measure leakage of the 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz microwave radiation, it is usually a hand-held device with a sensing antenna that can be scanned over the areas where the door meets the casing to find any radiation ''hot-spots'' whilst the unit is operating.  As Microwave ovens are not normally designed to be operated without a load this will usually take the form of an open container containing a quantity of water which is used to absorb the energy and as it gets warmed gives an indication that a unit not previously examined by a tester is actually producing microwaves.  After checking for leakage the door is required to be opened by whatever means is provided and the measurement device is not to record a level above the given limit.  In some scenarios a known quantity of water is heated for a known period of time and the temperature rise over the period of operation is used to generate an indication of the effective power output of the magnetron. This can be helpful to determine whether the oven is operating at the expected power levels indicated by labelling.

== Class of construction ==
Electrical [[appliance classes]] are differentiated by a series of IEC protection classes.  The protocols for PAT Testing vary by appliance class. 
*'''Class I''' – Single insulated wiring, which requires an earth connection. There is no symbol for a Class I product so if a rating plate has no symbol on it then it is usually Class I.
*'''Class II''' – Double insulated wiring, The earth clamp is still connected during the insulation test even though no earth on appliance. Class II is indicated by double box.
*'''Class III''' – These are appliances that are supplied at a low voltage (usually called Separated Extra Low Voltage) which must be less than 50&amp;nbsp;V. These appliances are supplied with a transformer supply that is also marked.

The earth lead is connected to metal parts on both Class I and Class II appliances. For "Class I" during the earth test to prove continuity between earth pin and metal parts on the appliance. For "Class II" during the insulation test to prove the insulation between active-neutral and the metal parts of the appliance. i.e. there is no leakage from mains coming into the appliance to the metal parts that are exposed.

==PAT training and qualifications==
[[File:PATtest.JPG|right|thumb|PAT testing at a workbench]]

In the UK, there is no requirement to have a formal qualification for persons carrying out PAT Testing.  The Electricity at Work regulations of 1989 simply state that where required, inspecting and testing must be carried out by a competent person, however does not mention a benchmark for competency.  It has become accepted practice, however, for individuals operating as PAT Testers to hold a 2377–22 City and Guilds qualification.  PAT Testers in the UK do not need to be electricians or have a background in the electrical industry. An example of a nationally recognised qualification of competence in PAT is offered by [[City and Guilds of London Institute|City &amp; Guilds]]: 'Code of Practice for In-service Inspection and Testing of Electrical Equipment – 4th Edition (No. 2377)'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityandguilds.com/cps/rde/xchg/SID-850C2351-18A457AB/cgonline/hs.xsl/1779.html?search_term=2377 City &amp; Guilds 'Code of Practice for In-service Inspection and Testing of Electrical Equipment' qualification]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; although there are others provided by EAL available.

In Australia it is a legal requirement to have attended a course or gained a qualification in order to PAT.  Proof of a company’s competence takes the form of a course certificate or qualification. A formal examination process for the topic is operated in collaboration with EAL or city and guilds (the awarding body) under the authority of the QCA (The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority) who validate and authorise the qualification.

==Types of PAT testers==
At the basic level PAT test instruments carry out basic safety checks. Most are equipped with an earth continuity test, insulation resistance test and the ability to check the wiring of detachable mains cords. Many do not however include tests which involve applying mains power to the appliance under test, for example, a protective conductor current or touch current tests. The main kind for businesses are simple PASS/FAIL testers that are easy to use, and are aimed at in-house PAT testing with minimal interpretation of results. Advanced PAT testers can give much more information and testing features but are mainly aimed at more highly skilled users.

===Pass / fail PAT testers===
These are the simple-to-use and comparatively much cheaper portable appliance testers for most businesses who will test in-house to carry out the testing and suitable for a wide range of businesses. They simply say PASS or FAIL when a test is carried out. Mains powered testers require AC power.   Battery operated PAT testers are self-contained and convenient to use. They usually come with rechargeable batteries.

These testers have a simple "lights" system. They have a "Pass" light, a "Fail" light, options for Class I metal / plastic or Class II. They also will show:
*earth continuity
*insulation resistance
*polarity.

===Advanced PAT testers===

These testers display more information than just pass or fail, including:
*Earth continuity resistance (aka Earth Bond) tests with a measurement range of 0 – 1.99&amp;nbsp;Ω at high test currents (usually 8&amp;nbsp;A, 10&amp;nbsp;A or 25&amp;nbsp;A) and lower test currents (in the range 20&amp;nbsp;mA to 200&amp;nbsp;mA), enabling a complete range of appliances including personal computers to be tested;
*Insulation resistance tests at test voltages of 500&amp;nbsp;V DC or 250&amp;nbsp;V DC.
*Protective conductor/touch current measurement (sometimes referred to as "earth leakage tests" on some older PAT units);
*Fuse test;
*Lead polarity.

These readings require interpretation by an electrician or someone with electrical understanding. Advanced PAT testers are effective as facilities management tools because they can record the location and test status of electrical equipment and appliances.

'''RCD testing'''

Some units can also test [[Residual-current device]]s, following the recommendation in the current IEE Code of Practice to test any RCD fitted on an extension lead or multiway adapter. 
[[Image:PrimeTest 250 RCD.jpg|thumb|left|Modern PAT testers include an RCD test]]

===Computerised PAT testers===
Some advanced PAT testers can download information to a computer. Bluetooth enabled computerised PAT testers make the two way transfer of test data between the tester and PC-based record keeping systems much simpler, and can be used with other test accessories such as label printers. Records can be maintained using PAT software such as [https://patorganiser.com.au PATorganiser]

== Calibration of testers ==
As PAT testers are sophisticated instruments, it is important to make sure that they are continuing to measure correctly. If a company fails to check and maintain calibration, it could face difficulty substantiating any measurements in the event of a claim. It is usually recommended that calibration is carried out annually on a PAT testing unit.

When a PAT tester is calibrated it is re-configuring it to match the original specification. This includes:

*Calibrating the unit back to national standards. This is best performed by the product manufacturer (if they offer a calibration service) or a laboratory accredited by [[United Kingdom Accreditation Service]] (UKAS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukas.com/ The United Kingdom Accreditation Service]&lt;/ref&gt;
*If it is mains powered, then a safety test must be carried out.
*A calibration certificate should be issued to prove the PAT unit has been electrically tested.

Dual purpose check boxes (which are essentially known resistances either side of the test limits)have also been introduced which are capable of validating the accuracy of both electrical installation testers and portable appliance testers in the field, reducing the risk of a tester being used when not operating correctly - this also allows the re-calibration interval to be increased.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19283">The standard '''[[problem of evil]]''' found in monotheistic religions does not apply to almost all traditions of '''[[Hinduism]]''' because it does not posit an omniscient, omnipotent, omnibenevolent creator.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw/&gt;&lt;ref name=skhk177/&gt;

Scholars have proposed alternate forms of the problem of evil based on Hinduism's karma and transmigration doctrines. According to Arthur Herman, karma-transmigration theory solves all three historical formulations to the problem of evil while acknowledging the theodicy insights of [[Adi Sankara]] and [[Ramanuja]].&lt;ref name=arthurhermanp5&gt;Arthur Herman, The problem of evil and Indian thought, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-20807537}}, pp. 5 with Part II and III of the book&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applicability==
[[Hinduism]] is a complex religion with many different currents or schools.&lt;ref name=bowker194&gt;{{cite book|author=John Bowker|title=Problems of Suffering in Religions of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W7IcQL1JBvAC |year=1975|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-09903-5 |pages=194, 206–220 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its non-theist traditions such as Samkhya, early Nyaya, Mimamsa and many within Vedanta do not posit the existence of an almighty, omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent god (monotheistic god), and the classical formulations of the problem of evil and theodicy do not apply to most Hindu traditions. Further, [[Deity|deities]] in Hinduism are neither eternal nor omnipotent nor omniscient nor omnibenevolent. [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] are mortal and subject to [[samsara]]. Evil as well as good, along with suffering is considered real and caused by human free will, its source and consequences explained through the [[karma]] doctrine of Hinduism, as in other Indian religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kaufman | first=Whitley R.

One text of the ancient [[Samkhya]] school of Hinduism, for example describes three kinds of suffering: first, of body and mind caused by diseases or personal behavior such as anger, greed, delusion, etc.; second, suffering caused by other beings such as men, beasts, reptiles etc.; third, suffering caused by the influence of yaksha, planets and such forces.&lt;ref name=othmar1998&gt;{{cite journal| author= Othmar Gächter |year= 1998| jstor= 40464839 |title= Evil and Suffering in Hinduism| journal= Anthropos|volume=Bd. 93, H. 4./6.|pages= 393–403}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindu texts describe and discuss suffering caused by both moral evils and natural evils.&lt;ref name=othmar1998/&gt;

Hinduism and other Indian religions do not focus on the [[problem of evil]] as formulated in monotheistic religions, by attempting to reconcile the nature of one all-powerful, all-seeing, all-benevolent god with existence of evil.&lt;ref name="Herman1993p235"/&gt; Rather, they focus on the path to spiritual liberation called [[moksha]], one that grants bliss in the present life such that evil and suffering have no effect on the liberated person's state of inner peace and happiness, and attaining moksha also means an end to the cycle of rebirth.&lt;ref name="Bowker1975p207"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur L.

==Problem of Injustice in the Brahma sutras==
A version of the problem of evil appears in the ancient ''[[Brahma Sutras]]'', probably composed between 200 BCE and 200 CE,&lt;ref name=nvisaeva36&gt;NV Isaeva (1992), Shankara and Indian Philosophy, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-1281-7}}, page 36&lt;/ref&gt; a foundational text of the [[Vedanta]] tradition of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=jamesloch124&gt;James Lochtefeld, Brahman, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}, page 124&lt;/ref&gt; Its verses 2.1.34 through 2.1.36 aphoristically mention a version of the problem of suffering and evil in the context of the abstract metaphysical Hindu concept of [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name=sradha30&gt;S Radhakrishnan (1960), [https://archive.org/stream/Sarvepalli.Radhakrishnan-Brahma.Sutra-The.Philosophy.of.Spiritual.Life/Radhakrishnan-Brahma.Sutra-The.Philosophy.of.Spiritual.Life#page/n361/mode/2up Brahmasutras: the philosophy of spiritual life], George Allen, pages 363-365&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sharma2008p31&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind Sharma |title=The Philosophy of Religion and Advaita Vedanta: A Comparative Study in Religion and Reason |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QxSrc6rkvzAC |year=2008|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |isbn=978-0-271-03946-6 |pages=30–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The verse 2.1.34 of ''Brahma Sutras'' asserts that inequality and cruelty in the world cannot be attributed to the concept of [[Brahman]], and this is in the Vedas and the Upanishads. In his interpretation and commentary on the ''Brahma Sutras'', the 8th-century scholar Adi Shankara states that just because some people are happier than others and just because there is so much malice, cruelty and pain in the world, some state that Brahman cannot be the cause of the world.&lt;ref name=sradha30/&gt; Shankara attributes evil and cruelty in the world to [[Karma]] of oneself, of others, and to ignorance, delusion and wrong knowledge,&lt;ref name=sharma2008p31/&gt; but not to the abstract Brahman.&lt;ref name=sradha30/&gt; Shankara develops the argument that God is not the Brahman, and that "a loving and good God could not have created the universe", a position held by Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=sharma2008p23&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind Sharma |title=The Philosophy of Religion and Advaita Vedanta: A Comparative Study in Religion and Reason |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QxSrc6rkvzAC |year=2008|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |isbn=978-0-271-03946-6 |pages=23–24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|
For that would lead to the possibility of partiality and cruelty. For it can be reasonably concluded that God has passion and hatred like some ignoble persons... Hence there will be a nullification of God's nature of extreme purity, (unchangeability), etc., [...] And owing to infliction of misery and destruction on all creatures, God will be open to the charge of pitilessness and extreme cruelty, abhorred even by a villain. Thus on account of the possibility of partiality and cruelty, God is not an agent.
|[[Adi Shankara]]|Translated by Arvind Sharma&lt;ref name=sharma2008p23/&gt;}}

In other words, in the ''Brahma Sutras'', the formulation of problem of evil is considered a metaphysical construct, but not a moral issue.&lt;ref name=sharma2008p31/&gt; [[Ramanuja]] of the theistic [[Sri Vaishnavism]] school – a major tradition within Vaishnavism – interprets the same verse in the context of Vishnu, and asserts that Vishnu only creates potentialities.&lt;ref name=sradha30/&gt;

According to Swami Gambhirananda, Sankara's commentary explains that God cannot be charged with partiality or cruelty (i.e. injustice) on account of his taking the factors of virtuous and vicious actions (Karma) performed by an individual in previous lives. If an individual experiences pleasure or pain in this life, it is due to virtuous or vicious action (Karma) done by that individual in a past life &lt;ref name=Gambhirananda1965&gt;{{cite book|author=Swami Gambhirananda |title=Brahma Sutra Bhasya Of Shankaracharya |url=https://www.amazon.com/Brahma-Sutra-Bhasya-Shankaracharya-Sankaracarya/dp/8175051051 |year=1965|publisher=Vedanta Press &amp; Bookshop |isbn=978-8175051058 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

[[Ramanuja]] of the theistic [[Sri Vaishnavism]] school interprets the same verse in the context of Vishnu, and asserts that Vishnu only creates potentialities.&lt;ref name="sradha30"/&gt; According to Arvind Sharma, Shankara's [[Advaita Vedanta]] school does not attribute the evil and suffering to the abstract concept of Brahman, but to ignorance, delusion and wrong knowledge.&lt;ref name="sharma2008p31"/&gt; The universe and all existence is without a beginning or end, and Brahman is everything before and after that beginning, before and after the end.&lt;ref name=sradha30/&gt; Further, in Hindu thought, neither evil nor error are final, all happiness and suffering is impermanent, and truth ultimately triumphs.&lt;ref name=sharma2008p31/&gt;

==Karma doctrine and the problem of evil==
The theory of [[karma]] refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/312474/karma Karma] Encyclopædia Britannica (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of evil, in the context of karma, has been long discussed in Indian religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, both in its theistic and non-theistic schools; for example, in Uttara Mīmāṃsā Sutras Book 2 Chapter 1;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Clooney (2005), in The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism (Editor: [[Gavin Flood]]), Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|0631215352}}, pp. 454-455&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Clooney (1989), ‘‘Evil, Divine Omnipotence and Human Freedom: Vedanta’s theology of Karma, Journal of Religion, Vol. 69, pp 530-548&lt;/ref&gt; the 8th century arguments by Adi Sankara in ''Brahmasutrabhasya'' where he posits that God cannot reasonably be the cause of the world because there exists moral evil, inequality, cruelty and suffering in the world;&lt;ref name=bilimoria&gt;P. Bilimoria (2007), Karma’s suffering: A Mimamsa solution to the problem of evil, in Indian Ethics (Editors: Bilimoria et al.), Volume 1, Ashgate Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0754633013}}, pp. 171-189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Kumarila’s ‘‘Slokavarttika’’; for English translation of parts and discussions: P. Bilimoria (1990), ‘ Hindu doubts about God - Towards a Mimamsa Deconstruction’, International Philosophical Quarterly, 30(4), pp. 481-499&lt;/ref&gt; and the 11th century theodicy discussion by Ramanuja in ''Sribhasya''.&lt;ref name=bilimoria2013/&gt;

Many Indian religions place greater emphasis on developing the karma principle for first cause and innate justice with Man as focus, rather than developing religious principles with the nature and powers of God and divine judgment as focus.&lt;ref&gt;B. Reichenbach (1998), Karma and the Problem of Evil, in Philosophy of Religion Toward a Global Perspective (Editor: G.E. Kessler), Wadsworth, {{ISBN|978-0534505493}}, pp. 248–255&lt;/ref&gt; Karma theory of Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism is not static, but dynamic wherein livings beings with intent or without intent, but with words and actions continuously create new karma, and it is this that they believe to be in part the source of good or evil in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yuvraj Krishan |title=The Doctrine of Karma: Its Origin and Development in Brāhmaṇical, Buddhist, and Jaina Traditions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Bi6FWX1NOgC |year=1997|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan |isbn=978-81-208-1233-8 |pages=17–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These religions also believe that past lives or past actions in current life create current circumstances, which also contributes to either. Other scholars&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Sharma (1973), Theodicy and the doctrine of karma, ‘‘Man’’, Vol. 8, No. 3, pp. 347-364&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that nontheistic Indian religious traditions do not assume an omnibenevolent creator, and some&lt;ref&gt;The Nyaya-Vaisesika school of Hinduism is one of the exceptions where the premise is similar to the Christian concept of an omnibenevolent, omnipotent creator&lt;/ref&gt; theistic schools do not define or characterize their God(s) as monotheistic Western religions do and the deities have colorful, complex personalities; the Indian deities are personal and cosmic facilitators, and in some schools conceptualized like Plato’s [[Demiurge]].&lt;ref name=bilimoria2013&gt;P. Bilimoria (2013), Toward an Indian Theodicy, in The Blackwell Companion to the Problem of Evil (Editors: McBrayer and Howard-Snyder), 1st Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|978-0470671849}}, Chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the problem of theodicy in many schools of major Indian religions is not significant, or at least is of a different nature than in Western religions.&lt;ref&gt;G. Obeyesekere (I968), Theodicy, sin and salvation in a sociology of Buddhism, in Practical religion (Ed. Edmund Leach), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521055253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dvaita tradition of Vaishnavism==
One sub-tradition within the [[Vaishnavism]] school of Hinduism that is an exception is dualistic [[Dvaita]], founded by [[Madhvacharya]] in the 13th-century. This tradition posits a concept of God so similar to Christianity, that Christian missionaries in colonial India suggested that Madhvacharya was likely influenced by early Christians who migrated to India,&lt;ref name=skhk177&gt;Sabapathy Kulandran and Hendrik Kraemer (2004), Grace in Christianity and Hinduism, James Clarke, {{ISBN|978-0227172360}}, pages 177-179&lt;/ref&gt; a theory that has been discredited by scholars.{{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=266}}{{Sfn|Sarma|2000|pp=19-21}} [[Madhvacharya]] was challenged by Hindu scholars on the problem of evil, given his dualistic [[Dvaita Vedanta]] (''Tattvavada'') theory that proposed [[God]] (Vishnu, supreme soul) and the individual souls ([[jiva|jīvātman]]) exist as independent realities, and these are distinct. Madhvacharya asserted, ''Yathecchasi tatha kuru'', which Sharma translates and explains as "one has the right to choose between right and wrong, a choice each individual makes out of his own responsibility and his own risk".{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=361}} Madhva's reply does not address the problem of evil, state Dasti and Bryant, as to how can evil exist with that of a God who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw&gt;{{cite book|author=David Buchta |editor=Matthew R. Dasti and Edwin F. Bryant| title=Free Will, Agency, and Selfhood in Indian Philosophy|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=iWLSAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA270|year = 2014| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=978-0199922758| pages=270–276}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=270, 370-371}}

According to Sharma, "Madhva's tripartite classification of souls makes it unnecessary to answer the problem of evil".{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=270, 370-371, '''Quote:''' The problem of evil and suffering in the world is the most difficult one in Theism. We have explained Madhva's attitude to the allied problem of freedom and freewill, on the basis of the doctrine of natural selection of good or bad and of the tripartite classification of souls. It is not therefore necessary for Madhva to answer the question of the consistency of evil with Divine goodness.}} According to David Buchta, this does not address the problem of evil, because the omnipotent God "could change the system, but chooses not to" and thus sustains the evil in the world.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw/&gt; This view of self's agency of Madhvacharya was, states Buchta, an outlier in Vedanta school and Indian philosophies in general.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw/&gt;

#''beads on a string'' structures with typical size of repeats over 50 residues, which are already large enough to fold independently into stable domains.

== Function ==
Some well-known examples of proteins with tandem repeats are [[collagen]], which plays a key role in the arrangement of the extracellular matrix; [[Coiled coil|alpha-helical coiled coils]] having structural and oligomerization functions; [[leucine-rich repeat]] proteins, which specifically bind a number of globular proteins by their concave surfaces; and [[Zinc finger|zinc-finger proteins]], which regulate the expression of genes by binding [[DNA]].

'''Refinement''' is a generic term of computer science that encompasses various approaches for producing [[correctness (computer science)|correct]] computer programs and simplifying existing programs to enable their formal verification.

== Program refinement ==
In [[formal methods]], '''program refinement''' is the [[formal verification|verifiable]] transformation of an ''abstract'' (high-level) [[formal specification]] into a ''concrete'' (low-level) [[executable program]].{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} ''[[Stepwise refinement]]'' allows this process to be done in stages. Logically, refinement normally involves [[logical consequence|implication]], but there can be additional complications.

The progressive just-in-time preparation of the product backlog (requirements list) in [[agile software development]] approaches, such as [[Scrum (software development)|Scrum]], is also commonly described as refinement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cho|first=L|title=Adopting an Agile Culture A User Experience Team's Journey|journal=Agile Conference|year=2009|doi=10.1109/AGILE.2009.76|isbn=978-0-7695-3768-9|pages=416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data refinement ==
'''Data refinement'''&lt;!-- REDIRECTs HERE--&gt; is used to convert an abstract data model (in terms of [[set (mathematics)|set]]s for example) into implementable [[data structures]] (such as [[Array data structure|arrays]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} Operation refinement converts a [[specification]] of an operation on a system into an implementable [[computer program|program]] (e.g., a [[Procedure (computer science)|procedure]]). The [[postcondition]] can be strengthened and/or the [[precondition]] weakened in this process. This reduces any [[Nondeterministic algorithm|nondeterminism]] in the specification, typically to a completely [[deterministic]] implementation.

For example, ''x'' ∈ {1,2,3} (where ''x'' is the value of the [[Variable (programming)|variable]] ''x'' after an operation) could be refined to ''x'' ∈ {1,2}, then ''x'' ∈ {1}, and implemented as ''x'' := 1. Implementations of ''x'' := 2 and ''x'' := 3 would be equally acceptable in this case, using a different route for the refinement. However, we must be careful not to refine to ''x'' ∈ {} (equivalent to ''false'') since this is unimplementable; it is impossible to select a [[Element (mathematics)|member]] from the [[empty set]].

The term [[Reification (computer science)|reification]] is also sometimes used (coined by [[Cliff Jones (computer scientist)|Cliff Jones]]). [[Retrenchment (computing)|Retrenchment]] is an alternative technique when formal refinement is not possible. The opposite of refinement is [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]].

== Refinement calculus ==
[[Refinement calculus]] is a [[formal system]] (inspired from [[Hoare logic]]) that promotes program refinement. The [[FermaT Transformation System]] is an industrial-strength implementation of refinement. The [[B-Method]] is also a [[formal method]] that extends refinement calculus with a component language: it has been used in industrial developments.

== Refinement types ==
{{Main|Refinement type}}

In [[type theory]], a '''refinement type'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first1=T.|last1=Freeman|first2=F.|last2=Pfenning|url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/papers/pldi91.pdf|doi=10.1145/113445.113468 |title=Refinement types for ML|booktitle=Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation|pages=268–277|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=S.|last=Hayashi|title=Logic of refinement types|citeseerx = 10.1.1.38.6346|doi=10.1007/3-540-58085-9_74|booktitle=Proceedings of the Workshop on Types for Proofs and Programs|pages=157–172|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=E.|last=Denney|citeseerx = 10.1.1.22.4988|title=Refinement types for specification|booktitle=Proceedings of the IFIP International Conference on Programming Concepts and Methods|volume=125|pages=148–166|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a type endowed with a predicate which is assumed to hold for any element of the refined type.  Refinement types can express [[precondition]]s when used as [[function argument]]s or [[postcondition]]s when used as [[return type]]s:  for instance, the type of a function which accepts natural numbers and returns natural numbers greater than 5 may be written as &lt;math&gt;f: \mathbb{N} \rarr \{n: \mathbb{N} \, | \, n &gt; 5\}&lt;/math&gt;.  Refinement types are thus related to [[behavioral subtyping]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6306">In astronomy, '''rotational Brownian motion''' is the [[random walk]] in orientation of a [[binary star]]'s orbital plane, induced by gravitational perturbations from passing stars.

==Theory==

Consider a binary that consists of two massive objects (stars, black holes etc.) and that is embedded in a [[stellar system]] containing a large number of stars.  Let &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; be the masses of the two components of the binary whose total mass is &lt;math&gt;M_{12}=M_1+M_2&lt;/math&gt;.  A field star that approaches the binary with [[impact parameter]] &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and velocity &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; passes a distance &lt;math&gt;r_p&lt;/math&gt; from the binary, where

&lt;math&gt;
p^2=r_p^2\left(1+2GM_{12}/V^2r_p\right) \approx 2GM_{12}r_p/V^2;
&lt;/math&gt;

the latter expression is valid in the limit that [[gravitational focusing]] dominates the encounter rate.  The rate of encounters with stars that interact strongly with the binary, i.e. that satisfy &lt;math&gt;r_p &lt; a&lt;/math&gt;, is approximately &lt;math&gt;n\pi p^2 \sigma =2\pi GM_{12} n a/\sigma &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; are the number density and velocity dispersion of the field stars and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[semi-major axis]] of the binary.

As it passes near the binary, the field star experiences a change in velocity of order 

&lt;math&gt;
\Delta V \approx V_{\rm bin} = \sqrt{GM_{12}/a}
&lt;/math&gt;, 

where &lt;math&gt;V_{\rm bin}&lt;/math&gt; is the relative velocity of the two stars in the binary.
The change in the field star's [[specific angular momentum]] with respect to the binary, &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, is then Δ''l'' ≈ ''a'' ''V''&lt;sub&gt;bin&lt;/sub&gt;.  Conservation of angular momentum implies that the binary's angular momentum changes by Δ''l''&lt;sub&gt;bin&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ -(m/μ&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;)Δ''l'' where ''m'' is the mass of a field star and μ&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is the binary [[reduced mass]]. Changes in the magnitude of ''l''&lt;sub&gt;bin&lt;/sub&gt; correspond to changes in the binary's orbital eccentricity via the relation ''e'' = 1 - ''l''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''GM''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;μ&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;''a''.  Changes in the direction of ''l''&lt;sub&gt;bin&lt;/sub&gt; correspond to changes in the orientation of the binary, leading to rotational diffusion. The rotational diffusion coefficient is

&lt;math&gt;
\langle\Delta\xi^2\rangle = \langle\Delta l_{\rm bin}^2\rangle / l_{\rm bin}^2 
\approx \left({m\over M_{12}}\right)^2 \langle\Delta l^2\rangle/GM_{12}a \approx {m\over M_{12}} {G\rho a\over\sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ρ = ''mn'' is the mass density of field stars.

Let ''F''(θ,''t'') be the probability that the rotation axis of the binary is oriented at angle θ at time ''t''.  The evolution equation for ''F'' is &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | author=Debye, P.
 | authorlink = Peter Debye
 | title=Polar Molecules
 | publisher=Dover
 | year=1929}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;

{\partial F\over\partial t} = {1\over\sin\theta} {\partial\over\partial\theta} \left(\sin\theta{\langle\Delta\xi^2\rangle\over 4} {\partial F\over\partial\theta}\right).  

&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;Δξ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&gt;, ''a'', ρ and σ are constant in time, this becomes

&lt;math&gt;

{\partial F\over\partial\tau} = {1\over 2} {\partial\over\partial\mu} \left[(1-\mu^2) {\partial F\over\partial\mu}\right]  

&lt;/math&gt;

where μ = cos θ and τ is the time in units of the relaxation time ''t''&lt;sub&gt;rel&lt;/sub&gt;, where

&lt;math&gt;
t_{\rm rel} \approx {M_{12}\over m} {\sigma\over G\rho a}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The solution to this equation states that the expectation value of μ decays with time as

&lt;math&gt;
\overline\mu = \overline{\mu}_0 e^{-\tau}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;rel&lt;/sub&gt; is the time constant for the binary's orientation to be randomized by torques from field stars.

==Applications==

Rotational Brownian motion was first discussed in the context of binary [[supermassive black hole]]s at the centers of galaxies.&lt;ref name=DM&gt;[[David Merritt|Merritt, D.]] (2002), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...568..998M  Rotational Brownian Motion of a Massive Binary], ''The Astrophysical Journal'', '''568''', 998-1003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Perturbations from passing stars can alter the orbital plane of such a binary, which in turn alters the direction of the spin axis of the single black hole that forms when the two coalesce.

Rotational Brownian motion is often observed in [[N-body simulation]]s of [[galaxies]] containing binary black holes.&lt;ref&gt;Löckmann, U. and Baumgardt, H. (2008), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008MNRAS.384..323L  Tracing intermediate-mass black holes in the Galactic Centre], ''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]'', '''384''', 323-330.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;	
Matsubayashi, T., Makino, J. and Ebisuzaki, T. (2007), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJ...656..879M|Orbital Evolution of an IMBH in the Galactic Nucleus with a Massive Central Black Hole], ''The Astrophysical Journal'', '''656''', 879-896&lt;/ref&gt;  The massive binary sinks to the center of the galaxy via [[dynamical friction]] where it interacts with passing stars. The same gravitational perturbations that induce a random walk in the orientation of the binary, also cause the binary to shrink, via the [[gravitational slingshot]].  It can be shown&lt;ref name=DM/&gt;  that the rms change in the binary's orientation, from the time the binary forms until the two black holes collide, is roughly

&lt;math&gt;
\delta\theta\approx \sqrt{20m/M_{12}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

In a real galaxy, the two black holes would eventually coalesce due to emission of [[gravitational wave]]s.  The spin axis of the coalesced hole will be aligned with the angular momentum axis of the orbit of the pre-existing binary. Hence, a mechanism like rotational Brownian motion that affects the orbits of binary black holes can also affect the distribution of black hole spins.  This may explain in part why the spin axes of supermassive black holes appear to be randomly aligned with respect to their host galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;Kinney, A. et al. (2000), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...537..152K  Jet Directions in Seyfert Galaxies], ''The Astrophysical Journal'', '''537''', 152-177&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Entry''', also known by various names, including '''Triumphal Entry''', [[Joyous Entry]], consisted of the ceremonies and festivities accompanying a formal entry by a ruler or his representative into a city in the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Early Modern Period]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Of course other cultures had equivalents, often even more spectacular, especially [[China]] and [[India]].&lt;/ref&gt; The entry centred on a procession carrying the entering prince into the city, where he was greeted and paid appropriate homage by the civic authorities. A feast and other celebrations would follow.

The Entry began as a gesture of loyalty and fealty by a city to the ruler, with its origins in the ''[[Adventus (ceremony)|adventus]]'' celebrated for Roman emperors, which were formal entries far more frequent than [[Roman triumph|triumph]]s. The first visit by a new ruler was normally the occasion, or the first visit with a new spouse. For the capital they often merged with the [[Coronation]] festivities, and for provincial cities they replaced it, sometimes as part of a '''Royal Progress''', or tour of major cities in a realm. (See also [[Itinerant court]], about this.)

From the [[late Middle Ages]]&lt;ref&gt;Earlier transformations of the [[Roman triumph]] in Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages have been discussed by Michael McCormick, ''Eternal Victory: Triumphal Rulership in Late Antiquity, Byzantium and the Early Medieval West'' (Cambridge University Press) 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; entries became the occasion for increasingly lavish displays of [[Medieval pageant|pageant]]ry and [[propaganda]]. The devising of the [[iconography]], aside from highly conventional patterns into which it quickly settled,&lt;ref&gt;"A remarkably consistent visual and iconographical vocabulary" according to Roy Strong.&lt;/ref&gt; was managed with scrupulous care on the part of the welcoming city by municipal leaders in collaboration with the chapter of the cathedral, the university, or hired specialists. Often the greatest artists, writers and composers of the period were involved in the creation of temporary decorations, of which little record now survives, at least from the early period.

==Origins and development==
[[File:Taddeo Zuccari 003.jpg|thumb|left|250px|King [[Francis I of France]], [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V|Charles V]], and [[Alessandro Farnese (cardinal)|Cardinal Alessandro Farnese]] enter Paris under a [[Baldachin|canopy of estate]] in 1540, in a fresco by [[Taddeo Zuccari]].]]

The contemporary account from [[Galbert of Bruges]] of the unadorned  "Joyous Advent" of a newly installed [[Count of Flanders]] into "his" city of Bruges, in April 1127, shows that in  the initial stage, undisguised by fawning and triumphalist imagery that came to disguise it, an Entry was similar to a [[parley]], a formal truce between the rival powers of territorial magnate and walled city, in which reiteration of the city's "liberties" in the medieval sense, that is its rights and prerogatives, were set out in clear terms and legitimated by the presence of [[Relic|saintly relics]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"On April 5... at twilight, the king with the newly elected [[william of Ypres|Count William, marquis of Flanders]], came into our town at Bruges. The canons of [[St. Donatian's Cathedral|Saint Donatian]] had come forth to meet them, bearing relics of the saints and welcoming the king and new count joyfully in a solemn procession worthy of a king. On April 6... the king and count assembled with their knights and ours, with the citizens and many Flemings in the usual field where [[Reliquary|reliquaries]] and relics of the saints had been collected. And when silence had been called for, the charter of the liberty of the church and of the privileges of Saint Donatian was read aloud before all... There was also read the little charter of agreement between the count and our citizens... Binding themselves to accept this condition, the king and count took an oath on the relics of saints in the hearing of the clergy and people".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in James M. Murray, "the Liturgy of the Count's Advent in Bruges", ''City and Spectacle in Medieval Europe'', Barbara Hanawalt and Kathryn Reyerson, eds., 1994, p. 137; Murray compares this "political bargain" with a contemporary account of the similar ''Adventus Iocundus'' of April 1384.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The procession of a new Pope to Rome was known as a ''possesso''.  A ruler with a new spouse would also receive an Entry. The entry of Queen [[Isabeau of Bavaria]] into Paris in 1389 was described by the chronicler [[Froissart]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Ribemont, "L'entree d'Isabeau de Bavière à Paris: une fete textuelle pour Froissart," in ''Feste und Feiern'', pp. 515–24.&lt;/ref&gt; The Entries of [[Charles IX of France]] and his Habsburg queen, [[Elisabeth of Austria (1554–1592)|Elizabeth of Austria]], into Paris, March 1571, had been scheduled for Charles alone in 1561, for the ''entrate'' were typically celebrated towards the beginning of a reign,&lt;ref&gt;The entries made by [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand of Aragon]] late in his reign, at Naples (1506), Valencia (1507), Seville (1508) and Valladolid (1509 and 1513), serve as exceptions that were occasioned by his need for confirmative propaganda, following the arrival in Castile of Philip that resolved the succession crisis attendant on the death of Isabella, and Ferdinand's withdrawal into Aragon. (Tess Knighton and Carmen Morte García, "Ferdinand of Aragon's Entry into Valladolid in 1513: The Triumph of a Christian King" ''Early Music History'' '''18''' (1999:119–163) p. 123.)&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[French Wars of Religion]] had made such festivities inappropriate, until the peace that followed the Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye signed in August 1570.&lt;ref name="Victor E 1975"&gt;Victor E. Graham and W. McAllister Johnson, ''The Paris Entries of Charles IX and Elizabeth of Austria 1571'' (University of Toronto Press) 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the mid-14th century, the occasions were relatively simple.  The city authorities waited for the prince and his party outside the city walls, and after handing over a ceremonial key&lt;ref&gt;Lingering into modern times is the ceremonial presentation of the "[[Freedom of the city|key to the city]]" to an honoured guest.&lt;/ref&gt; with a "loyal address" or speech,&lt;ref&gt;At Charles V's entry into Genoa in 1533, a twelve-year-old girl, dressed as Victory and carrying a palm frond, delivered a suitable oration ''all'antica''— in Latin. (George L. Gorse, "An Unpublished Description of the Villa Doria in Genoa during Charles V's Entry, 1533" ''The Art Bulletin'' '''68'''.2 [June 1986:319–322]).&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps stopping to admire ''[[Tableau vivant|tableaux vivants]]'' such as those that were performed at the entry into Paris of Queen [[Isabeau of Bavaria]], described in detail by the chronicler [[Froissart]], conducted him through the streets which were transformed with colour, with houses on the route hanging tapestries and embroideries&lt;ref&gt;The richly worked hangings of a bed would serve.&lt;/ref&gt; or carpets&lt;ref&gt;Pile carpets were displayed on tables or on a dais; pile carpets were not usually trod under foot until the seventeenth century.&lt;/ref&gt; or bolts of cloth from their windows, and with most of the population lining the route.   At Valladolid in 1509
:''the town was so gay, so decked out in wealth and canopies and luxurious carpets, that not even Florence or Venice could match it. All the beautiful ladies were delighted to be on display and were definitely worth seeing, [and] everything was so brilliantly arrayed, that I, who am of the town and have never left it, could not recognize it.''&lt;ref&gt;Luís de Soto, chaplain of the king and coordinator of the Entry, quoted in Knighton and Morte García 1999:139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heraldic displays were ubiquitous: at Valladolid in 1509, the bulls in the fields outside the city were caparisoned with cloths painted with the royal arms and hung with bells.  Along the route the procession would repeatedly halt to admire the set-pieces embellished with [[motto]]es and pictured and living allegories, accompanied by declamations and the blare of trumpets&lt;ref&gt;At Valladolid in 1513 Ferdinand was welcomed with four pairs of [[kettledrums]], trumpets by the dozens, [[shawm]]s and [[sackbut]]s. "They made such a din that if a bird happened to fly past, they made it fall from the sky into the crowd", the chroncicler records. (Knighton and Morte Garcia 1999:125).&lt;/ref&gt; and volleys of artillery. The procession would include members of the [[three Estates]], with the nobility and gentry of the surrounding area, and the clergy and [[guild]]s of the city processing behind the prince.  From the mid-14th century the guild members often wore special uniform clothes, each guild choosing a bright colour; in [[Tournai]] in 1464 three hundred men wore large embroidered silk [[fleur de lys]] (the royal badge) on their chests and backs, at their own expense.&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Piponnier and Perrine Mane; ''Dress in the Middle Ages''; pp. 150–151, Yale UP, 1997; {{ISBN|0-300-06906-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The prince reciprocated by confirming, and sometimes extending, the customary privileges of the city or a local area of which it was the capital.  Usually the prince also visited the cathedral to be received by the bishop and confirm the privileges of the [[cathedral chapter]] also.&lt;ref name="Strong, 1984, p. 7"&gt;Strong, 1984, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; There a ''[[Te Deum]]'' would be customary, and music written for the occasion would be performed.

===Increasing elaboration===

During the 14th century, as courtly culture, with the court of Burgundy in the lead,&lt;ref&gt;The refinements of court protocol and the magnificence of court entertainments of [[Philip the Good]] and [[Charles the Bold]] set courtly fashions for decades in the fifteenth century.&lt;/ref&gt; began to stage elaborate dramas re-enacting battles or legends as entertainment during feasts, the cities began to include in entry ceremonies small staged pageant "tableaux", usually organised by the guilds (and any communities of foreign merchants resident), and drawing on their growing experience of [[medieval theatre]] and [[medieval pageant|pageantry]].  Initially these were on religious themes, but "gradually these tableaux developed, through the fifteenth and into the sixteenth century, into a repertory of archways and street-theatres which presented variants of a remarkably consistent visual and iconographical vocabulary."&lt;ref name="Strong, 1984, p. 7"/&gt;  Fortune with her wheel, Fame and Time, the seven Virtues, both Christian and Classical, and the [[Nine Worthies]] and other Classical, Biblical and local heroes,&lt;ref&gt;At [[York]] in 1486 [[Henry VII of England]] was presented with the keys to the city by the mayor and the allegorical founder-figure of ''Eburak'', a phantom king conjured up by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s 12th-century [[The History of the Kings of Britain|history of the kings of Britain]] and embedded in civic cult (Gareth Dean, ''Medieval York'' 2008:50).&lt;/ref&gt; among whose number the honoree was now to be counted. As the tradition developed, the themes became more specific, firstly stressing the legitimacy of the prince, and his claim by descent, then setting before him the princely virtues and their rewards, which especially included the benefits to him of encouraging prosperous cities and provinces.

The procession might pause for allegorical figures to address it, or pass beside a [[family tree|genealogical tree]] or under a temporary classical-style [[triumphal arch]] with either painted figures or posed actors perching on it, standing in for statuary in the case of arches. Still more elaborate entertainments began to be staged during or after the civic feast, and by the mid-17th century these could be as spectacular as the staged naval battles, [[masque]]s, [[opera]]s and [[ballet]]s that courts staged for themselves.  The court now often had a major role in both designing and financing entries, which increasingly devoted themselves to the glorification of the [[absolute monarch]] as hero, and left the old emphasis on his obligations behind; "any lingering possibilities of its use as a vehicle for dialogue with the middle classes vanished".&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; At the third "triumph" at Valladolid  in 1509, a lion holding the city's coat-of-arms shattered at the King's arrival, revealing the royal arms: the significance could not have been lost, even on those unable to hear the accompanying declamation.&lt;ref&gt;Knighton and Morte García 1999:146&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 16th century, at dates differing widely by location, the [[tableau vivant]] was phased out and mostly replaced by painted or sculpted images, although many elements of street-theatre persisted, and small [[masque]]s or other displays became incorporated into the programmes.  The entry in 1514 of [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary Tudor]] to Paris, as Louis XII's new Queen, was the first French entry to have a single organizer; ten years before [[Anne of Brittany]]'s entry had been "largely medieval", with five stops for [[mystery play]]s in the streets.&lt;ref&gt;One Pierre Gringore, apparently appointed by the government. Baumgartner, Frederick J; ''Louis XII'', pp. 136 (Anne) and 240 (Mary), Alan Sutton Publishing Ltd, Stroud, 1994, {{ISBN|0-7509-0695-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Hundred Years' War]], the entry of the ten-year-old [[Henry VI of England]], to be crowned king of France in Paris, 2 December 1431, was marked with great pomp and heraldic propaganda. Outside the city he was welcomed by the mayor in a blue velvet ''[[houppelande]]'', his retinue in violet with scarlet caps, and representatives of the [[Parlement de Paris]] in red trimmed with fur. At the porte Saint-Denis the royal party were greeted with a grand achievement of the French arms that Henry claimed, gold [[Fleur de lis|fleurs de lis]] on an azure ground. The king was offered large red hearts, from which doves were released, and a rain of flowers pelted the procession. At the symbolic gateway, a [[canopy of estate]] embroidered with more gold lilies was erected over the young king, who was carried in a litter supported on six lances carried by men dressed in blue. Through the city there were welcoming pageants and allegorical performances: before the Church of the Innocents, a forest was erected, through which a captured stag was released and "hunted".&lt;ref&gt;The contemporary sources, including''The Chronicles of [[Enguerrand de Monstrelet]]'' (Thomas Johnes, tr., London 1810, vol. vii, p. 46ff) and the ''Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris'', are noted in the brief description in Walter Franz Schirmer, ''John Lydgate: a study in the culture of the XVth century'' 1979, p. 137; [[John Lydgate|Lydgate]] was called upon to provide texts for similar pageantry at home, such as the entry of Henry into London, 1434.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical influence===
[[File:Triunphus Caesaris plate 9 - Andreani.jpg|left|thumb|Later woodcut after [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], with hand-colouring, showing the culmination of the [[Triumphs of Caesar]].]]
Educated folk of the Middle Ages had close at hand an example of an allegorical series of entries at a wedding, in the frame story that opens [[Martianus Capella]]'s encyclopedic introduction to all one needed to know of the arts, ''On the Wedding of Philology and Mercury and of the Seven Liberal Arts.''  With the revival of Classical learning, Italian entries&lt;ref&gt;The bibliography of Italian Renaissance ''entrate'' is Bonner Mitchell, ''Italian Civic Pageantry of the High Renaissance: A Descriptive Bibliography of Triumphal Entries and Selected Other Festivals for State Occasions'' (Florence) 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; became influenced by literary descriptions of the [[Roman triumph]]. [[Livy]]'s account was supplemented by detailed descriptions in [[Suetonius]] and [[Cassius Dio]] of Nero's Greek Triumph,&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Nero'' 25; Cassius Dio lxiii.20.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Josephus]] of the Triumph of Titus.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Jewish Wars'' vii. 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recherché sources were brought to bear; [[Aulus Gellius]]' ''Noctes Atticae'' furnished a detail that became part of the conventional symbolism: coronation with seven crowns. [[Boccaccio]]'s long poem ''Amorosa visione'' (1342–43), following the schema of a triumph, offered a parade of famous personages, both historical and legendary, that may have provided a model for [[Petrarch]], who elaborated upon Livy in an account of the triumph of [[Scipio Africanus]] and in his poem ''[[I Trionfi]]''.  [[Castruccio Castracani]] entered [[Lucca]] in 1326 riding in a chariot, with prisoners driven before him.  [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] entered [[Naples]] in 1443 seated on a triumphal car under a [[baldachin]], as is shown by a surviving [[bas-relief]]&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984, p. 44 [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:NapoliMaschioAngioinoArcoLaurana3.jpg Picture of relief]&lt;/ref&gt; on the earliest, and still perhaps the most beautiful, permanent post-classical [[Triumphal arch]], which he built the same year.&lt;ref&gt;George L. Hersey, ''The Aragonese Arch at Naples, 1443–1475'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1973) summarises the scholarship on the Arch and reports eye-witness accounts of the Entry and pictorial illustrations.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Italian, specific meanings developed for ''trionfo'' as both the whole procession, and a particular car or cart decorated with a display or tableau; although these usages did not spread exactly to other languages, they lie behind terms such as "triumphal entry" and "triumphal procession".

The emphasis began to shift from the displays as static tableaux that were passed by a procession in festive but normal contemporary dress, to the displays' being incorporated in the procession itself, a feature also of the religious [[medieval pageant]]; the tableaux were mounted on ''carri'', the precursors of the float, and were now often accompanied by a costumed throng. The [[carnival]] parades of Florence that were refined to a high pitch in the late quattrocento set a high standard; they were not without a propaganda element at times, as in the lavish parades of Carnival 1513, following the not-universally welcomed return of the Medici the previous year; the theme of one pageant, more direct than subtle: ''The Return of the Golden Age''.&lt;ref&gt;Shearman 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; With the French invasions of Italy from 1494, this form of entry spread north. Cardinal Bibbiena reported in a letter of 1520 that the Duke of Suffolk had sent emissaries to Italy to buy horses and bring back to [[Henry VIII of England]] men who knew how to make festal decorations in the latest Italian manner.&lt;ref&gt;John Shearman, "The Florentine Entrata of Leo X, 1515" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''38''' (1975:136–154) p. 136.  The arrival in England, via another route, of [[Artists of the Tudor court#The Tudor Serjeant Painters|"Antony Toto" and Bartlommeo Penni]] may have satisfied this need.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Piero della Francesca 047.jpg|thumb|right|[[Piero della Francesca]], 1472, [[Federico da Montefeltro]] and his wife in triumphal cars, hers drawn by [[unicorn]]s.]]

[[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V|Charles V]] was indulged in a series of Imperial ''entrate'' in Italian cities during the Habsburg consolidation after the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]], notably in Genoa, where Charles and his heir Philip made no less than five triumphal entries.&lt;ref&gt;In 1529, 1533, 1536, 1542 and 1548. (J. Jacquot, ed., ''Les fêtes de la Renaissance'' II: ''Fêtes et cérémonies au temps de Charles-Quint'', Paris 1960).&lt;/ref&gt; Impressive occasions like Charles V's Royal Entry into Messina in 1535 have left few concrete survivals,&lt;ref&gt;Sheila ffoliot&lt;!--ffoliot is correct--&gt; argues convincingly in ''Civic Sculpture in the Renaissance: Montorsoli's Fountains at Messina'' (Studies in Renaissance History, Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1984) that many features of [[Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli]]'s Fountain of Orion in Messina, which survives in much degraded condition, owe their origins to the programme for the Entry of 1535.&lt;/ref&gt;  but representations were still being painted on Sicilian wedding-carts in the 19th century.

After [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s great mural of the [[Triumphs of Caesar]] rapidly became known throughout Europe in numerous versions in [[old master print|print]] form, this became the standard source, from which details were frequently borrowed, not least by Habsburg rulers, who especially claimed the Imperial legacy of Rome.  Although Mantegna's elephants were difficult to copy,&lt;ref&gt;Oxen were disguised as elephants to draw one of the floats in the carnival parade given by Lorenzo di Piero de' Medici's fraternal company, the ''Broncone'', at Florence, 6 February 1513. (John Shearman, "Pontormo and Andrea Del Sarto, 1513" ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''104''' No. 716 [November 1962:450, 478-483] p. 478.).&lt;/ref&gt; chained captives, real or acting the part, were not, and elaborate triumphal carts, often pulled by "[[unicorn]]s" might replace the earlier canopy held over the prince on horseback.  The [[woodcut]]s and text of the ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'' of 1499 were another well-known source, and Petrarch's ''I Trionfi'' was printed in many illustrated editions; both were works of mythological allegory, with no obvious political content.  Entries became displays of conspicuous learning, often with lengthy Latin addresses, and the entertainments became infused with matter from the abstruse worlds of Renaissance [[emblem]]s and [[hermeticism]], to which they were very well suited.  In the world of Renaissance [[Neo-Platonism]], the assertion and acting-out of the glory and power of the prince might actually bring it about.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984:40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

A precocious example of the Entrata with a consistent and unified allegorical theme was the Entry of [[Pope Leo X|Medici pope Leo X]] into Florence, November 1515.&lt;ref&gt;Singled out by André Chastel, "Le lieu de la fête", in J. Jacquot, ed. ''Fêtes de la Renaissance'' (Paris 1956, vol. I:420), and described at length by John Shearman, "The Florentine Entrata of Leo X, 1515" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''38''' (1975:136–154), from whose account these details are drawn.&lt;/ref&gt; All the city's artistic resources were drawn upon to create this exemplary Entry, to a planned programme perhaps devised by the historian [[Jacopo Nardi]], as [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]] suggested; the Seven Virtues represented by seven triumphal arches at stations along the route, the seventh applied as a temporary façade to the [[Florence Cathedral|Duomo, Santa Maria del Fiore]], which still lacked a permanent one.

===Propaganda===
Apart from the permanent theme of the reciprocal bonds uniting ruler and ruled, in times of political tension the political messages in Entries became more pointed and emphatic.  A disputed succession would produce a greater stress on the theme of legitimacy.  After the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], tension became a permanent condition, and most Entries contained a sectarian element.  After about 1540 French entries and Habsburg ones in the [[Low Countries]]&lt;ref&gt;The bibliography is John Landwehr, ''Splendid Ceremonies: State Entries and Royal Funerals in the Low Countries, 1550–1791: A Bibliography'' (Leiden 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; were especially freighted with implication, as the rulers' attempts to suppress Protestantism brought Protestant and Catholic populations alike to the edge of ruin.  But initially this increased the scale of displays, whose message was now carefully controlled by the court.
[[File:Pieter Paul Rubens - Ingresso trionfale di Enrico IV a Parigi - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|''Entry of Henry IV into Paris'', by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], 1628–30: an unfinished [[Baroque]] figuration of the allegory itself.]]

This transformation happened much earlier in Italy than in the North, and a succession of entries for Spanish Viceroys to the blockaded city of [[Antwerp]], once the richest in Northern Europe and now in steep decline, were "used by the city fathers to combine increasingly eulogistic celebrations of their Habsburg rulers with tableaux to remind them of the commercial ruin over which they presided."&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Pompa Introitus'' of the [[Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand]] into Antwerp in 1635, devised by [[Gaspar Gevartius]] and carried out under the direction of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], was made unmistakably pointed, and included [http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/pageview.aspx?strFest=0152&amp;strPage=220 a representation] of the god of commerce, [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], flying away, as a lamenting figure representing Antwerp points at him and looks imploringly out at the Viceroy, whilst beside her lie a sleeping sailor and a river god, representing the wrecked trade of the city from the blockading of the river [[Scheldt]].  Eventually the Viceroy managed to obtain the lifting of the ban on trade with the [[Indies]] which the entry had represented as Antwerp's only hope of escaping ruin; but by then the Spanish had agreed to the permanent blockade of the river.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1638, the occasion of the French queen mother [[Marie de Medici|Marie de Medici's]] triumphal entry into [[Amsterdam]] lent ''de facto'' international recognition of the newly formed [[Dutch Republic]], though she actually traveled to the Netherlands as an exile. Spectacular displays and water pageants took place in the city's harbor; a procession was led by two mounted [[trumpeter]]s; a large temporary structure erected on an artificial island in the [[Amstel River]] was built especially for the festival.  This building was designed to display a series of dramatic [[tableau vivant|tableaux]] in tribute to her once she set foot on the floating island and entered its [[pavilion]]. The distinguished poet and classicist [[Caspar Barlaeus]] wrote the official descriptive booklet, ''Medicea Hospes, sive descriptio publicae gratulationis, qua ... Mariam de Medicis, excepit senatus populusque Amstelodamensis''.  Published by Willem Blaeu, it includes two large folding engraved views of the ceremonies.

===Peace and war===
Although the essence of an entry was that it was supposed to be a peaceful, festive occasion, very different from the taking of a town by assault, several entries actually followed military action by the town against their ruler, and were very tense affairs.  In 1507 the population of [[Genoa]] revolted against the French who had conquered them in 1499, and restored [[Republic of Genoa|their Republic]].  [[Louis XII of France]] defeated the Genoan army outside the city, which then agreed a capitulation, including an entry which was followed by the execution of the [[Doge]] and other leaders of the revolt.  The gestural content was rather different from a peaceful entry; Louis entered in full armour, holding a naked sword, which he struck against the portal as he entered the city, saying "Proud Genoa! I have won you with my sword in my hand".&lt;ref&gt;Baumgartner, Frederick J; ''Louis XII'', pp. 185–7, Alan Sutton Publishing Ltd, Stroud, 1994, {{ISBN|0-7509-0695-2}} He had sent a small force into the city two days before, and though large fines were levied, the city was not sacked.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles V entered [[Rome]] in splendour less than three years after his army had [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked the city]].  The famously troublesome citizens of [[Ghent]] revolted against [[Philip the Good]] [[Battle of Gavere|in 1453]] and Charles V [[Revolt of Ghent (1539)|in 1539]], after which Charles arrived with a large army and was greeted with an entry.  A few weeks later he dictated the programme of a deliberately humiliating anti-festival, with the burghers coming barefoot with nooses round their necks to beg forgiveness from him which, after imposing a huge fine, he consented to do.&lt;ref&gt;Wilenski:34–35&lt;/ref&gt;  The entries of Charles and his son Philip in 1549 were followed the next year by a ferocious anti-Protestant edict that began the repression that led to the [[Dutch Revolt|Revolt of the Netherlands]], in the course of which Antwerp was to suffer a [[Sack of Antwerp|terrible sack]] in 1576 and a [[Siege of Antwerp (1584–1585)|long siege]] in 1584–85, which finally ended all prosperity in the city.

===Decline===
[[File:Triumphal Arch in Gdansk.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Temporary [[triumphal arch]] in [[Gdańsk]] to celebrate the ceremonial entry of Queen [[Marie Louise Gonzaga]], 1646]]
During the 17th century the scale of entries began to decline.  There was a clear trend, led from [[Medici]] Florence, to transfer festivities involving the monarch into the private world of the court. The ''[[intermedio|intermezzi]]'' developed in Florence, the ''[[ballet de cour]]'' that spread from Paris, the English [[masque]], and even elaborate equestrian ballets all increased as entries declined.&lt;ref&gt;A major theme of Strong, 1984, summed up in pp. 171–3&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1628, when Marie de' Medici commissioned from Rubens a ''Triumphal Entry of Henri IV into Paris'', it was for a suite of grand decorations for her own palace,  [[Palais du Luxembourg|the Luxembourg]]; Rubens did not recreate historic details of the 1594 Royal Entry, but overleapt them to render the allegory itself (''illustration'').

The cultural atmosphere of Protestantism was less favourable to the Royal Entry. In the new Dutch Republic entries ceased altogether.  In England, part of the [[Accession Day tilt|Accession Day festivities]] in 1588, following the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] were especially joyous and solemn. Delaying the event a week to 24 November, Elizabeth rode in triumph, "imitating the ancient Romans" from her [[palace of Whitehall]] in the [[city of Westminster]] to enter the [[city of London]] at [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]]. She rode in a chariot
&lt;blockquote&gt;"made with four pillars behind, to have a canopie, on the top whereof was made a crowne imperiall, and two lower pillars before. whereon stood a [[Lion and Unicorn|lyon and a dragon]], supporters of the armes of England, drawn by two white horses"&lt;ref&gt;The quote and the description are from Roy C. Strong, "The Popular Celebration of the Accession Day of Queen Elizabeth I" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''21'''.1/2 (January 1958:86–103) pp92f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] followed the triumphal car, leading the caparisoned and riderless horse of estate, followed by the ladies of honour. The windows of houses along the procession route up the [[Strand, London|Strand]] were hung with blue cloth. At Temple Bar, the official gate to the City, there was music and the Lord Mayor handed over the mace and received it again. In a "closet" constructed for the occasion, the Queen heard a festive service celebrated by fifty clergymen at [[St. Paul's Cathedral]] and returned in a torchlit procession in the evening.

Nevertheless, the entry of James I into London in 1604 was the last until the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of his grandson in 1660, after the [[English Civil War]].  The court of Charles I intensified the scale of private [[masque]]s and other entertainments, but the cities, increasingly at odds with the monarchy, would no longer play along.  The [[Duchy of Lorraine]], a great centre of all festivities, was swallowed up in the [[Thirty Years War]], which left much of Northern and Central Europe in no mood or condition for celebrations on the old scale.  In France the concentration of power in royal hands, begun by [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]], left city elites distrustful of the monarchy, and once Louis XIV succeeded to the throne, royal progresses stopped completely for over fifty years; in their place Louis staged his elaborate court [[fête]]s, redolent of cultural propaganda, which were memorialised in sumptupously illustrated volumes that the ''Cabinet du Roi'' placed in all the right hands.
[[File:GeorgeIVDublin.jpg|thumb|310px|Triumphal Entry of [[George IV of the United Kingdom]] into [[Dublin]], 1821, with temporary arch]]
Changes in the intellectual climate meant the old allegories no longer resonated with the population.  The assassinations of both [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] and [[Henry IV of France]], of [[William the Silent]] and other prominent figures, and the spread of guns, made rulers more cautious about appearing in slow-moving processions planned and publicised long in advance; at grand occasions for fireworks and illuminations, rulers now characteristically did no more than show themselves at a ceremonial window or balcony.  The visit of [[Louis XVI]] to inspect the naval harbour works at [[Cherbourg]] in 1786 seems, amazingly, to have been the first French entry of a King designed as a public event since the early years of Louis XIV well over a century before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Simon Schama|Schama, Simon]] | title=[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]] | page=57| location=New York | publisher=Alfred A. Knopf | year=1989 | isbn=0-394-55948-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though considered a great success, this was certainly too little and too late to avoid the catastrophe awaiting the French monarchy.

Ideologues of the [[French Revolution]] took the semi-private fête of the former court and made it public once more, in events like the ''[[Fête de la Raison]]''. Under Napoleon, the [[Treaty of Tolentino]] (1797) requisitioned from the Papacy a mass of works of art, including most of the famous sculptures of Roman antiquity in the Vatican. A Joyous Entry under the name of a fête was arranged for the arrival of the cultural loot in Paris, the carefully prepared ''Fête de la Liberté'' of 1798. With the increased sense of public security of the 19th century, Entries became grander again, on such occasions as the [[Visit of King George IV to Scotland]], where medieval revivalism makes its first appearance, along with much [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] romanticism, Queen Victoria's visits to Dublin and elsewhere, or the three [[Delhi Durbar]]s. On these occasions, though ceremonial acts remained meaningful, overt allegories never regained the old prominence, and the decorations receded into festive, but simply decorative affairs of flags, flowers and [[bunting (textile)|bunting]], the last remnant of the medieval show of rich textiles along the processional route.

Today, though many [[parade]]s and [[procession]]s have quite separate, independent origins, civic or republican equivalents of the Entry continue. They include [[Victory parade]]s, New York's traditional [[ticker-tape parade]]s and the [[Lord Mayor's Show]] in London, dating back to 1215 and still preserving the Renaissance car, or [[Float (parade)|float]] model. It is not frivolous to add that the specific occasion of the contemporary American [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade|Thanksgiving Day Parade]] or the [[Santa Claus parade]] is the triumphal entry into the city of [[Santa Claus]] in his sleigh.

===Artists===
[[File:HenriIIbetweenFrance&amp;Fame.jpg|thumb|240px|left|''[[Henry II of France]] between France and Fame'', [[engraving]] by [[Jean Duvet]],  may reflect a tableau from an occasion such as his Entry into Paris, 16 June 1549.]]
To the occasional irritation of modern [[art historian]]s, many of the great artists of the time spent a good deal of time on the ephemeral decorations for entries and other festivities, including [[Jan van Eyck]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], [[Andrea del Sarto]], [[Perino del Vaga]],&lt;ref&gt;His frescoes for [[Villa del Principe]], executed in expectation of Charles V's ''entrata'' of 1533, bear witness to the vanished theme of the event: Neptune and the defeat of the Giants.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polidoro da Caravaggio]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]  and [[Rubens]].  For some court artists, such as [[Inigo Jones]] or [[Jacques Bellange]], it seems to have been their major occupation, and both [[Giulio Romano]] and [[Giorgio Vasari]] were very heavily engaged in such work.  Composers from [[Lassus]] and [[Monteverdi]] to [[John Dowland]], and writers such as [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]], [[Ronsard]], [[Ben Jonson]] and [[John Dryden|Dryden]] also contributed.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1983, p. 6 for most of these.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shakespeare]] does not seem to have written anything for such an occasion, but with Jonson he was one of a group of twenty gentlemen processing in ''The Magnificent Entertainment'', as the published record called the first entry of [[James I of England]] into London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0238 Festival Book]&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historians also detect the influence of the tableau in many paintings, especially in the late Middle Ages, before artists had trained themselves to be able to develop new compositions readily.&lt;ref&gt;Many of the best known examples, like the [[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)]] or the large ''Virgin of Einsiedeln'' by [[Master E.S]] relate to tableaus not from entries, but engravings by [[Jean Duvet]], who worked on at least two royal entries, may well do.&lt;/ref&gt;   In the Renaissance, artists were often imported from other cities to help with, or supervise, the works, and entries probably helped the dissemination of styles.

===Festival books===
A [[festival book]] is an account of festivities such as entries, of which there are many hundreds, often surviving in very few copies.  Originally manuscripts, often illustrated, compiled for prince or city, with the arrival of print they were frequently published, varying in form from short pamphlets describing the order of events, and perhaps recording speeches, to lavish books illustrated with [[woodcut]]s or [[engraving]]s showing the various tableaux, often including a fold-out panorama of the procession, curling to and fro across the page. The pamphlets were ephemera themselves; a printed description of two leaves describing the entry of Ferdinand into Valladolid, 1513, survives in a single copy (at Harvard) because it was bound with another text. A lost description of the ceremonious reception given by Louis XII to Ferdinand at Savona (June 1507) is only known from a purchase receipt of [[Ferdinand Columbus]].&lt;ref&gt;Knighton and Morte Garcia 1999:120f.&lt;/ref&gt;

These ''livrets'' are not always to be trusted as literal records; some were compiled beforehand from the plans, and others after the event from fading memories. The authors or artists engaged in producing the books had by no means always seen the entry themselves.

The [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian I]], went a step further, creating enormous virtual triumphs that existed solely in the form of print. The ''[[Triumphs of Maximilian]]'' (begun in 1512 and unfinished at Maximilian's death in 1519) contains over 130 large woodcuts by Dürer and other artists, showing a huge procession (still in open country) culminating in the Emperor himself, mounted on a huge car.  ''[[The Triumphal Arch]]'' (1515), the largest print ever made, at 3.57 x 2.95 metres when the 192 sheets are assembled, was produced in an edition of seven hundred copies for distribution to friendly cities and princes. It was intended to be hand-coloured and then pasted to a wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aic.stanford.edu/sg/bpg/annual/v14/bp14-07.html The American Institute for Conservation]; Figure 9 (and many later ones) show the Triumphal Car of Maximilian, and Figure 10 is the first appearance of the Arch&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditional tableau themes, including a large genealogy, and many figures of Virtues, are complemented by scenes of Maximilian's life and military victories.&lt;ref&gt;For all on Dürer's involvement: Giulia Bartrum, ''Albrecht Dürer and his Legacy'', (British Museum Press), 2002:194–7, {{ISBN|0-7141-2633-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maximilian was wary of entries in person, having been locked up by his loyal subjects in [[Bruges]] in 1488 for eleven weeks, until he could pay the bills from his stay.&lt;ref&gt;A move the burghers were to regret when his son Charles V later took family revenge with an especially tough siege&lt;/ref&gt;

An early meeting between the festival book with travel literature is the [http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0097 account] of the visit in 1530 of the future [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]], then [[King of Hungary]] and [[Bohemia]] to [[Constantinople]].

===New World entries===
In Habsburg territories in the New World, the ''entradas'' of the [[Viceroy of Mexico]] were celebrated at his landing at [[Veracruz]] and at [[Mexico City]]; on the way, the ceremonial entry at the "second city", [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla de los Ángeles]], which were presented as late as 1696, served to promote an elite that self-identified strongly with Spain, and incurred expenses, which were borrowed from the ecclesiastic ''[[Cabildo (council)|cabildo]]'', that exceeded the annual income of the city. Printed commemorative pamphlets spelled out in detail the elaborately artificial allegories and hieroglyphic emblems&lt;ref&gt;Emblems were especially drawn from the much-reprinted and translated standard [[emblem book]]s of [[Andrea Alciati]] and [[Cesare Ripa]], which engendered a considerable Spanish emblem literature during the seventeenth century.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Entry, often drawn from astrology, in which the Viceroy would illuminate the city as the sun. In the 18th century, the Bourbon transformation of ''entrées'' into semi-private ''fêtes'' extended to Spanish Mexico: "While the event continued to be extravagant under Bourbon rule, it became more privatized and took place to a larger degree indoors, losing its street theater flavor and urban processional character."&lt;ref&gt;Nancy H. Fee, "La Entrada Angelopolitana: Ritual and Myth in the Viceregal Entry in Puebla de Los Angeles" ''The Americas'' '''52'''.3 (January 1996), pp. 283–320.&lt;/ref&gt;

*1356: the [[Joyous Entry]] into [[Brussels]], by [[Joanna, Duchess of Brabant|Joanna]] and her husband [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Luxembourg]], upon her becoming Duchess of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]].  "Joyous Entry" is a common term for French or [[Netherlandish]] entries.  This one is famous because the [[Charter]] granted by the ruler to the Duchy came to assume a position in the history of the Low countries similar to that of the [[Magna Carta]] in England.
*1431: [[Henry VI of England]] returned to London after being crowned [[King of France]] in [[Paris]], then occupied by the English, and the arms of both crowns were prominently displayed.  Henry, then aged fifteen, was encountered by the "empresses" of "Nature, Grace and Fortune" who destowed various virtues and talents upon, then by fourteen maidens, representing the [[Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit]] and a further set.  After further tableaux, at [[Cheapside]] a fountain ran with wine (a particular speciality of London festivities) and large tableaux represented the genealogy of the King, and a complementary [[Tree of Jesse]] showing that of Christ. The finale was a huge tableau of Heaven, where God the Father, surrounded by saints and angels, addressed the King.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984, pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;
*1443: [[Alfonso V of Aragon]]'s triumphal entry into Naples was "the earliest of the triumphal entries ''all'antica'' in Europe"&lt;ref&gt;Knighton and Morte García 1999:124, referencing C. Carandete, ''I triunfi nel primo rinascimento''  (Edizioni Rai 1963:20).&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most lathe-and-plaster painted triumphal arches, its permanent commemoration is the arch before the [[Castel Nuovo]]. The event, portraying Alfonso as a classical hero of Antiquity, set iconographic examples for his nephew in the Royal entries of Ferdinand of Aragon. The published account by [[Antonio Beccadelli (poet)|Antonio Beccadelli, "Il Panormita"]], circulated widely.

*1513: [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand of Aragon]]'s triumphal entry into Valladolid, taking the conquest of [[Navarre]] as an occasion for allegorical displays of regal power in "an unusually lavish and explicitly propagandist entry".&lt;ref&gt;Knighton and Morte García 1999:120.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1515: The triumphal entry of the [[Pope Leo X|Medici Pope Leo X]] into Florence is one of the most thoroughly documented entries, both in official records and private journals— though the visual and musical components are lost— and has attracted a separate monograph, by Ilaria Ciseri.&lt;ref&gt;Ilaria Ciseri, ''L'ingresso trionfale di Leone X in Firenze nel 1515'' (Biblioteca Storica Toscana (Florence: Olschki) 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced on a princely scale, catching Leo at the peak of his reputation, en route to a meeting at Bologna with François I, at the head of temporarily victorious forces. Ciseri identifies two likely candidates for the allegorical programme, Jacopo Nardi and Marcello Virgilio Adriani, and a theme that offered parallel evocations of Imperial Rome the heavenly Jerusalem. The unfinished façade of the Duomo was temporarily "completed" in "[[chiaroscuro]]" ([[grisaille]]) canvases of feigned architecture and sculpture by [[Andrea del Sarto]] to designs by [[Jacopo Sansovino]].&lt;ref&gt;Shearman 1962:480&lt;/ref&gt;

*1515 and 1535–36: [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] was both the most powerful and the most mobile monarch of the Renaissance, and made unprecedented numbers of entries. He made a series in his youth, from which the 1515 entry into [[Bruges]] is one of the best recorded of the old medieval style, with an unusually well-illustrated [http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0074 Festival Book] for the date. In 1533 he was regally entertained in Genoa by [[Andrea Doria]], with a mock battle staged in the harbour. In 1535–36, at the height of his success, he made a progress through Italy, being crowned as Emperor by the Pope in Bologna and visiting the capital of his new [[Kingdom of Naples]].&lt;small&gt;[http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0102 Book]&lt;/small&gt; His Imperial Entry into Rome, on April 5, 1536, is particularly well documented in contemporary accounts, in [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''Lives'' and in surviving drawings; it drew on the imagery of the ancient [[Roman Triumph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pinson|first=Yona |year=2001 |title= Imperial Ideology in the Triumphal Entry into Lille of Charles V and the Crown Prince (1549) |journal=Assaph: Studies in Art History |volume=6|page=212|url=http://www2.tau.ac.il/InternetFiles/Segel/Art/UserFiles/file/09pinson.pdf |accessdate=20 August 2013|quote=Already in his Imperial Triumphal Entry into Rome (1536) the Emperor appeared as a triumphant Roman Imperator: mounted on a white horse and wearing a purple cape, he embodied the figure of the ancient conqueror.

*1548–49: Philip II made a tour as the heir of Charles beginning in Italy, up through Germany, and ending in the Netherlands, entering many cities, often with Charles, with [[Antwerp]] as the culmination, shown in a well-illustrated [http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0116 Festival Book], which shows many decorations that were not actually constructed.

*1549–50. [[Henry II of France]] and his family made a tour of entries which set the tone for Valois propaganda. For the Entry into Paris, 16 June 1549, following [[Catherine de' Medici]]'s coronation at Saint-Denis, a loggia designed by [[Pierre Lescot]] with sculptures by [[Jean Goujon]] had been in preparation for two years; a naval battle was staged on the Seine, a [[tournament]] was held, and heretics were burned.&lt;ref&gt;I.

A [http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0231 much less elaborate] affair than Habsburg entries, but at least for the Protestant population, one more genuinely celebrated.  There is a typical English emphasis on poems and orations, of which the majority were given by children.  Elizabeth processed in a triumphal "Chariot", was presented with a bible by the city, and passed giant figures re-used from the wedding of her sister Mary.  Both speeches and tableaus depicted her as saviour of the Protestant faith, a new [[Deborah]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0231 Festival Book]&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1578 entry into [[Norwich]] is [http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0232 almost homely]; the master of the [[grammar school]] being apparently the only townsman whose Latin was fit to put before the Queen, he catches her up and orates at several points.
*1571: The separate Entries of [[Charles IX of France]] and his new Habsburg queen, [[Elisabeth of Austria (1554–1592)|Elizabeth of Austria]], into Paris, 6 March and 29, were recorded in a book of woodcuts with text, Simon Bouquet's ''Bref et sommaire receuil...'', published in July. Bouquet, an alderman of Paris, was responsible for coordinating the details. Poets [[Jean Dorat]] and [[Pierre Ronsard]] drew up the iconographic program, and [[Germain Pilon]] executed temporary allegorical sculpture, and [[Niccolo dell'Abate]] provided paintings. The main theme was the inauguration of a new era of peace: Charles' personal motto, ''Piety and Justice'' furnished the allegory presented at one of the cortege's stops. A little over a year later the [[Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre]]s inaugurated a new phase of the wars.&lt;ref name="Victor E 1975"/&gt;
*1574: The new King [[Henry III of France]] on his way back from his brief period as [[King of Poland]] was given an exceptionally grand Entry to [[Venice]], which rarely had the opportunity of welcoming a friendly monarch, though it had its own very lavish round of festivities. This was a "State Visit" with no element of accepting fealty.  Tintoretto and Veronese collaborated in painting an arch designed by [[Palladio]], and for the banquet for 3,000 in the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]], statuettes in [[sugar]] designed by Jacopo Sansovino decorated the tables.&lt;ref&gt;R.H.

*1583: The [[French Fury]] was a disastrously unsuccessful attempt by [[François, Duke of Anjou]] to use the excuse of an entry to take [[Antwerp]] – the citizens were forewarned and attacked the army as it marched through the streets, sending it running.  They had already been sacked in the [[Sack of Antwerp|Spanish Fury]] in 1576, with the sack of Rome in 1527, among the most notorious anti-entries of the period.
*1589: The triumphal entry of [[Christina of Lorraine]] at Florence and her wedding procession with [[Ferdinand I de' Medici]], complete with ephemeral triumphal arches, included — interspersed with public shows, a game of ''[[Football in Italy|calcio]]'', animal-baiting, a staged [[jousting|joust]] in Piazza Santa Croce — semi-private court events, the musical ''[[intermedio|intermedi]]'' that were presented in the newly redesigned theatre in the [[Uffizi]]; these elaborately costumed and staged allegorical ''tableaux'' with complex allegories mark a stage in the development of court pageantry and the [[masque]], as well as in the pre-history of [[opera]].&lt;ref&gt;See James W. Saslow, ''The Medici Wedding of 1589: Florentine Festival as Theatrum Mundi'' ((New Haven:Yale University Press) 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1598: For the triumphal entry of [[Pope Clement VIII]] into Ferrara, where the principal [[House of Este|Este]] line had failed and the Pope had declared the fief to have reverted to the Papal States, the occasion urgently required splendidly presented and concrete allegorical propaganda, in order to justify the new situation to the Ferrarese. Once ensconced, Clement was host to a series of dukes and ambassadors honoured with princely entries themselves, climaxed with the betrothals by proxy of [[Margaret of Austria, Queen of Spain|Margaret of Austria]] and [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Archduke Albert of Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;See Bonner Mitchell,  ''1598. A Year of Pageantry in Late Renaissance Ferrara'' (Binghamton: Medieval Texts and Studies) 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1648: The "[[Joyous Entry]]" of [[Archduke Leopold William of Austria]] into Antwerp was also coordinated by Gevartius, who devised its iconography and published his own description. Rather than three-dimensional arches and tableaux, the allegories were rendered in two dimensions on strategically placed screens.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Vlieghe, "The Decorations for Archduke Leopold William's State Entry into Antwerp" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''39''' (1976:190–198).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sloughing''' (pronounced "sluffing") in [[biology]] refers to the act of shedding or casting off dead tissue, such as cells of the [[endometrium]], shed during [[menstruation]], or the shedding of skin in [[amphibians]].

[[Skin sloughing]] is the process of shedding dead surface cells from the skin.

In [[veterinary medicine]], it may refer to the process where [[Necrosis|necrotic]] surface [[epithelial cells]] are discarded from the small intestinal [[mucosa]] following various infections which may occur within both [[monogastric]]s or [[ruminants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |vauthors=Dyce KM, Sack WO, ((Wensing CJG)) |title=Textbook of Veterinary Anatomy |edition=Fourth |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medicine]], slough may start occurring in [[pressure ulcer|pressure ulcers]] also known as ''decubitus ulcers'' or as bed sores at the stage 3, and in stage 4{{clarify|date=November 2013}} levels of wound, infection, and damage.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In plants, sloughing occurs during [[Root#Root growth|root growth]], where cells from the [[root cap]] are shed to the soil where they are biologically processed by microorganisms. Also, when a root undergoes secondary growth (transition from a primary root to a "woody" root), the [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]] and epidermis become isolated from the rest of the root and are eventually sloughed.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The '''Society for Crypto-Judaic Studies''' ("SCJS"), founded in August 1990 by Rabbi Joshua Stampfer of [[Portland, Oregon]], and Dr. Stanley Hordes of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], is the major academic organization conducting and encouraging research on the [[Crypto-Jews]]{{ref|1}} of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] and their descendants today. This also involves significant attention being given to the [[Inquisition]] and to its ramifications for [[Sephardic Jews]] as well as for the general [[Jewish]] community. 

Membership in the SCJS is composed of scholars interested in crypto-Jews, descendants of crypto-Jews, and others interested in the topic from a historical, sociological, anthropological, religious, ethnic, literary, philosophical, or other perspective. The Society is nonreligious, and membership is open to all. Today, there is much interest, both academic and personal, in the history and contemporary status of crypto-Jews, and a number of distinguished scholars have published in the area. Especially in recent years, a number of people, especially, but not limited to, [[Hispanics]], have returned or converted to Judaism, frequently in part because of knowledge of a previously-suppressed Jewish heritage. [[New Mexico]], [[Texas]], [[Arizona]], and [[California]] are major areas of interest, but significant interest also is found in [[Miami]], [[Florida]], [[Orlando, Florida]], [[New York City]], [[Portland, Oregon]], and other areas with large numbers of [[Hispanic]]s. This contemporary phenomenon of returning/converting also is of specific interest to some academic researchers.

The SCJS publishes ''HaLapid'': The Journal of the Society for Crypto-Judaic Studies, a combination newsletter and journal. Published four times per year, ''HaLapid'' (Hebrew for The Torch) mostly includes refereed academic research articles, personal stories by descendants of crypto-Jews, and news items, but also includes occasional poetry, links for related websites, and other items of interest. The SCJC also hosts a website, and helps answer questions and make referrals for interested persons.

The Society for Crypto-Judaic Studies meets annually for a three-day conference which includes a keynote speaker, sessions on recent research findings, personal stories of returnees, business sessions, and various forms of entertainment. At the 2003 annual conference in San Antonio, Texas, the keynote speaker was retired Rabbi Samuel Lerer who spent much of his 51-year career working with anusim in Mexico. The SCJS has taken a lead in interest in [[DNA]] studies, especially as it applies to crypto-Jews, other Sephardim, and the Jewish community in general.

* {{note|1}} The well-known Judaica author [[Cecil Roth]] popularized the term [[marranos]] in his 1932 book ''A History of the Marranos'', but, because of the negative meaning attached to the word marrano by supporters of the Inquisition, today the term preferred by descendants and scholars is Crypto-Jews (i.e., Secret Jews), or [[anusim]] ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for forced ones)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2761">'''SOUP''' stands for '''[[software]] of unknown''' (or '''uncertain''') '''pedigree''' (or '''provenance'''), and is a term often used in the context of [[safety-critical]] and [[safety-involved]] systems such as [[medical software]].  SOUP is software that has not been developed with a known [[software development process]] or [[software development methodology|methodology]], or which has unknown or no safety-related properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Felix Redmill|booktitle=Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Computer Safety, Reliability and Security, SAFECOMP 2001, Budapest, Hungary, September 26&amp;ndash;28, 2001|editor=Udo Voges|pages=122|title=The COTS Debate in Perspective|publisher=Springer|date=2001|isbn=978-3-540-42607-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, engineering projects are faced with economic or other pressure to embody SOUP into their high integrity systems.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

The problem with SOUP is that it cannot be relied upon to perform safety-related functions, and it may prevent other software, hardware or firmware from performing their safety-related functions.  The SOUP problem is therefore one of insulating the safety-involved parts of a system from the SOUP and its undesirable effects.&lt;ref name="emdt"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.emdt.co.uk/article/developing-medical-device-software-iso-62304 |title=Developing Medical Device Software to IEC 62304 |last=Hall |first=Ken |work=EMDT - European Medical Device Technology |date=June 1, 2010 |accessdate=2012-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SOUP is now a defined term ("Software Of Unknown Provenance") in some medical device regulations through the standard [[IEC 62304|IEC 62304:2006 "medical device software –
software life cycle processes"]]. It is not prohibited to use SOUP but additional controls are needed and the risk needs to be taken into account. Specific practices to take when using SOUP as part of a [[medical device]] may include review of the vendor's software development process, use of [[static program analysis]] by the vendor, design artifacts, and safety guidance.&lt;ref name="meddevice"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://medicaldesign.com/engineering-prototyping/software/device-cots-soup-1111/ |title=Device makers can take COTS, but only with clear SOUP |last=Hobbs |first=Chris |work=Medical Design |date=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Taima Mandala, 14th century, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 57.156.6.jpg|thumbnail|Taima Mandala, Kamakura period, 14th century, Japan]]
The '''Taima Mandala''' (當麻曼荼羅,綴織当麻曼荼羅図) is a [[mandala]] in Japanese [[Pure Land]] Buddhism. The original copy of the mandala is still housed in the [[Taima-dera]] temple in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], Japan, and was woven c. 763. The mandala is appointed as a [[National Treasures of Japan|national treasure of Japan]] on April 27, 1961. Many copies have been made since, and the original work has degraded considerably.  According to popular legend, [[Chūjō-hime]] witnessed the creation of the mandala, crafted from fibers of lotus stems by two nuns who were thought to be [[Amitābha|Amida]] Buddha (Buddha of Infinite Light) and [[Guan Yin|Kannon]] Bodhisattva.  The imagery of the Mandala is based mostly on the ''[[Contemplation Sutra|Sutra of the Contemplation of Amitayus]]'' 観無量寿経, and has been the subject of several doctrinal commentaries in Japanese Buddhism.

==Description==
The central image is the [[Pure Land]] itself, while the left, right, and lower borders are lined with images from the Contemplation Sutra. The central image, called the Court of Essential Doctrine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mason|first1=Penelope|title=History of Japanese Art|date=1993|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|isbn=0810910853|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; depicts the Amida Buddha surrounded by his worshippers that have reached enlightenment, buildings, and the land that exists in his Paradise. At the top of the central image there are many figures floating in the sky on clouds. Each of these figures have the distinctive characteristic of a halo behind their heads. This detail is a signifier that each of them have achieved enlightenment. Alongside of them are various birds flying about, scarves floating in the air, and some lotus flowers. All the figures, scarves, and birds all float towards the center of the image.

Below the floating figures, in the center, near the top of the image, there are images of buildings that appear to look like temples or palaces floating in the sky, as well. These floating buildings lead down to what appears to be an indoor garden surrounded by more buildings, this time located to the ground. These buildings are designed after eighth-century Chinese Palaces. Each of these buildings, as well as the trees in the garden, are made of the seven precious substances–gold, silver, lapis lazuli, rock crystal, coral, agate, and mother-of-pearl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grotenhius|first1=Elizabeth|title=Japanese Mandalas Representations of Sacred Geography|date=1999|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu, HI|page=18|chapter=The Taima Mandala}}&lt;/ref&gt;Throughout the palaces are more enlightened figures meditating.

Most Chinese palaces are raised on a platform as their foundation. The structural beams are primarily used to support the roof of the building. They are connected to directly to each other due to the brackets. The walls are either curtained or door panels to define the rooms or to enclose the building. In the Taima, the buildings display a sweeping roof. This type of roof holds a sweeping curve that raises the corners of the roofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zhao|first1=Ruiyong|last2=Caiwang|first2=Yang|title=Chinese Ancient Architecture|date=2004|publisher=[Jinan Shi]: Qi Lu yin xiang chu ban she chu ban fa xing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the very center of this image is what appears to be a dock in the middle of a lotus pond. On this dock, there are three figures seated on lotus blossom thrones surrounded by many meditating enlightened figures. All three of these figures are bigger than the rest throughout the image, but the centered one is the largest of them all. The centered figure is known as Amida, the deity of the Western Paradise. The figure to each of his sides are known as bodhisattvas, people who have reached enlightenment, but stayed on earth to teach the ways of the Buddha to help others reach their enlightenment. These two figures are the bodhisattva Kannon and bodhisattva Seishi.

Surrounding the middle dock holding Amida are several smaller docks, all connected to the centered dock, each holding more meditating figures.  In the pond itself are boats and lotus flowers. Upon close examination, one can see many figures being born from the lotus flowers. These are people who have reached enlightenment and are being welcomed into the Western Paradise. The boats are there to bring the enlightened figures to land so they can continue their worship.

The left border (the Court of Prefatory Legend) shows, first, the discovery of the Sutra on Vulture Peak at the top, and then illustrates the introduction of the Sutra, from the bottom upward: Prince Ajasatru's temptation, the imprisonment of his father and then his mother, and Queen Vaidehi's prayers answered by Shakyamuni Buddha. Shakyamuni transmits the knowledge of the Pure Land to his disciple in the last panel, second from the top.

Queen Vaidehi was given the task to meditate and visualize the elements that represented of the western paradise, illustrated in the right border. This is called Thirteen Meditational Contemplations (The Jozengzi). The elements are as shown:

'''1.''' The Sun 
'''2.''' The Moon
'''3.''' The Lapis Lazuli (Jeweled Realm of the Western Paradise)
'''4.''' The Trees of Paradise
'''5.''' The Lakes of Paradise
'''6.''' The Multi-storied Jeweled Towers of Paradise
'''7.''' Amida's Jeweled Lotus Throne
'''8.''' The Amida Triad
'''9.''' The Great Body of Amida
'''10.''' Amida in Half-lotus Position
'''11.''' The Bodhisattva Shishi
'''12.''' Imagining oneself reborn in Paradise
'''13.''' The Small Body of Amida&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mason|first1=Penelope E.|title=History of Japanese Art|date=1993|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|page=169|chapter=Samurai Culture and the coming of Pure Land and Zen Buddhism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bottom border illustrate the nine levels of birth. This is described as the Court of General Meditations (Sanzengi). This is an extension of the Thirteen Meditational Concentrations. The General Mediations are three levels of rebirth that are subdivided into three degrees (six births total). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mason|first1=Penelope|title=History of Japanese Art|date=1993|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|page=170|chapter=Samurai Culture and the Coming of Pure Land and Zen Buddhism}}&lt;/ref&gt; These births include from middle birth to upper degree to the upper birth of the lower degree (higher ranks closer to center of pond), and middle birth to lower degree and the lower birth of the lower degree (enclosed in the calyxes of lotus flowers further away from Amida).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grotenhuis|first1=Elizabeth|title=Japanese Mandalas Representations of Sacred Geography|date=1999|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu, HI|page=21-2|chapter=The Taima Mandala}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surrounding the borders to the ends of the hanging scroll are designs of lotus flowers. Each lotus is painted with small and careful details to help make the images stand out.

'''''The Procuress''''' is the name given to a number of similar paintings by the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age]] painter [[Dirck van Baburen]]. The painting is in the [[Caravaggio|Caravaggiesque]] style of the [[Utrecht Caravaggism|Utrecht school]].

==The painting==
The painting shows three figures, a prostitute on the left, the client in the middle and the procuress on the right pointing to her palm to indicate that she is expecting payment. The client is holding a coin between his fingers as he puts his arm around the prostitute, who is playing a [[lute]]. The painting is an example of the popular genre known as ''Bordeeltjes'', or brothel scenes (see also the overlapping genre of [[Merry company]] scenes).&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Schneider, ''Vermeer, 1632–1675: veiled emotions'', Taschen, 2000, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cropped, close-up figures close to the [[picture plane]] against a flat blank background are typical of [[Utrecht Caravaggism]].&lt;ref name = "jmm"/&gt;

There are at least three versions of the painting. The versions in the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam|Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121011141312/http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/collectie/zoeken/asset.jsp?id=SK-C-612&amp;lang=en Rijksmuseum catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/the-procuress-33414 |title=MFA catalogue |publisher=Mfa.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; are attributed to [[Dirck van Baburen]] or his studio. One copy of the painting was owned by [[Maria Thins]], mother-in-law of [[Johannes Vermeer]], who reproduced it in the background of two of his own paintings.  A copy owned by the [[Courtauld Institute]] in London has been identified as the work of the forger [[Han van Meegeren]]. This was featured in the third episode of the BBC TV series, ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]''.&lt;ref name="FoF3"&gt;{{Cite episode

==Vermeer==
[[File:Vermeer The concert.JPG|thumb|left|Vermeer's ''[[The Concert (Vermeer)|The Concert]]'' in which ''The Procuress'' hangs on the wall at the upper right]]
[[File:Johannes Vermeer - Zittende Klavecimbelspeelster (1673-1675).jpg|thumb|Vermeer's ''[[Lady Seated at a Virginal]]'', in which ''The Procuress'' hangs on the wall behind the figure]]

One of these paintings was owned by [[Vermeer]]'s mother-in-law, and it may have been an influence on one of his own early paintings on a similar subject, also known as ''[[The Procuress (Vermeer)|The Procuress]]'' (1656).&lt;ref name = "jmm"&gt;John Michael Montias, ''Vermeer and His Milieu: A Web of Social History'', Princeton University Press, 1991, p.146.&lt;/ref&gt; It also appears in the background of two of Vermeer's later paintings, ''[[The Concert (Vermeer)|The Concert]]'' (c.1664) and ''[[Lady Seated at a Virginal]]'' (c.1670). In both of these later paintings the blatant lust depicted by Baburen is contrasted with the genteel, but erotically charged, middle-class world occupied by Vermeer's women. The contrast between the images may also imply "a more general association between music and love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/johannes-vermeer-a-young-woman-seated-at-a-virginal |title=National Gallery |publisher=National Gallery |date=2013-09-08 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vermeer sets up a series of contrasts between his own delicate, restrained style and Baburen's vulgar realism. According to Michael Wayne Cole and Mary Pardo this represents Vermeer's own move away from such low-life subjects. The older, cruder style of Baburen is relegated to the background, "eclipsing it with the more modern kind of genteel subject that Vermeer would soon paint exclusively".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Wayne Cole, Mary Pardo, ''Inventions of the studio, Renaissance to Romanticism'', UNC Press Books, 2005, p.206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Courtauld Institute version==
[[File:The_Procuress_forgery_by_Han_van_Meegeren_from_the_Courtauld_Gallery.jpg|left|thumb|The Courtauld Institute copy, believed to be a van Meegeren forgery]]
In 1960, [[Geoffrey Webb]] presented a version of the painting to the Courtauld Institute. At the end of the [[Second World War]], he had been an allied officer in Europe investigating art works looted by the Nazis. He believed it was a fake painted by [[Han van Meegeren]], and he presented it to the Courtauld as such. In his own defense, van Meegeren claimed that the painting had been bought in an antique shop by his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/8612890/Master-forgery-17th-century-work-exposed-as-a-fake.html |title=report in the Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2011-07-02 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the painting was initially believed to be a fake, its authenticity remained controversial, and in 2009 a scientific study indicated that the painting was likely to be genuine, as no modern pigments were found. A spokesperson for the gallery stated that they were "surprised" by the results, but that the evidence indicated that it was "likely to be a 17th-century painting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Akbar |first=Arifa |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/fake-painting-revealed-as-dutch-masterpiece-1794254.html |title=Independent article |publisher=Independent article |date=2009-09-28 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following this, the BBC TV programme ''Fake or Fortune?'' conducted a further investigation.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; The resulting film was first shown July 2011.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; [[Philip Mould]] and [[Fiona Bruce]] traveled to Amsterdam where they obtained samples of the paints used by van Meegeren.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; These included an artificial resin which turned out to be [[Bakelite]].&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; The use of Bakelite had the effect of hardening the paint and thus making it difficult to detect that it was new.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; Chemical analysis showed Bakelite in the Courtauld painting, thus confirming that it was a modern forgery.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; Van Meegeren is the only forger known to have used this technique, so the painting was attributed to him.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; It was probably intended to be used as a prop in Vermeer forgeries.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt; It is more valuable as a van Meegeren forgery than as a 17th-century studio copy.&lt;ref name="FoF3" /&gt;

'''Tin-glazing''' is the process of giving [[ceramic]] items a tin-based [[ceramic glaze|glaze]] that is white, glossy and opaque, which is normally applied to red or buff [[earthenware]]. The opacity and whiteness of tin glaze encourage its frequent decoration with [[overglaze]] colour.  [[Majolica]], [[delftware]] and [[faience]] are among the terms used for common types of [[tin-glazed pottery]].  An alternative is [[Lead-glazed earthenware|lead-glazing]], where the basic glaze is transparent; some types of pottery use both.&lt;ref&gt;For example polychrome [[Delftware]]; Savage, 160&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Tin dioxide|Tin oxide]] is valued in glazes as both an [[opacifier]] and as a white colorant.&lt;ref&gt;’The Glazer’s Book’ – 2nd edition. ''A.B.Searle.The Technical Press Limited.'' London. 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; Tin oxide has long been used to produce a white, opaque and glossy glaze.&lt;ref name="C.W.Parmelee 1973"&gt;’Ceramic Glazes’ Third edition. C.W.Parmelee &amp; C.G.Harman. ''Cahners Books'', Boston, Massachusetts. 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ceramics Glaze Technology 1986"&gt;‘Ceramics Glaze Technology.’ J.R.Taylor &amp; A.C.Bull. ''The Institute Of Ceramics &amp; Pergamon Press''. Oxford. 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; As well as an opacifying agent, tin oxide also finds use as a colour stabiliser in some pigments and glazes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;‘Ceramics Glaze Technology.’ J.R.Taylor &amp; A.C.Bull. The Institute Of Ceramics &amp; Pergamon Press. Oxford. 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Minor quantities are also used in the conducting phases in some electrical porcelain glazes.&lt;ref name="Ceramics Glaze Technology 1986"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Conducting Glazes Part 2 : The Use of Valency Controlled Semiconducting Oxides and the Development of Tin Oxide Glazes'.

==History==
{{Main|Tin-glazed pottery}}
[[File:Chinese white ware and Iraqi earthenware bowls 9th 10th century both found in Iraq.jpg|thumb|350px|Chinese [[porcelain]] white ware bowl, not tin-glazed (left), found in [[Iran]], and Iraqi tin-glazed earthenware bowl (right) found in [[Iraq]], both 9-10th century, an example of [[Chinese influences on Islamic pottery]]. [[British Museum]].]]
The earliest tin-glazed pottery appears to have been made in [[Abbasid]] [[Iraq]] (750-1258 AD)/[[Mesopotamia]] in the 8th century, fragments having been excavated during the First World War from the palace of [[Samarra]] about fifty miles north of [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name=CaigerSmith73&gt;Caiger-Smith, Alan, ''Tin-Glaze Pottery in Europe and the Islamic World: The Tradition of 1000 Years in Maiolica, Faience and Delftware'', London, Faber and Faber, 1973 {{ISBN|0-571-09349-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From Mesopotamia, tin glazes spread to Islamic Egypt (868–905 AD) during the 10th century, and then to Andalusian Spain (711-1492 AD), leading to the maximum development of Islamic [[lusterware]].&lt;ref name=Mason&gt;Mason, R. B., and M. S. Tite, "The beginnings of tin-opacification of pottery glazes", ''Journal of Archaeological Science'' 39:41-58, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borgia, I., B. Brunettu, A. Sgamellontti, F. Shokouhi, P. Oliaiy, J. Rahighi, M. Lamehi-rachti, M. Mellini, and C. Viti. 2004&lt;/ref&gt; 

The history of tin glazes in the Islamic world is disputed. One possible reason for the earlier production of tin-glazed wares could be attributed to the trade between the [[Abbasid Empire]] and ancient China from the 8th to 9th century onwards, resulting in imitation of white Chinese [[stoneware]] by local Islamic potters.&lt;ref&gt;Kleimann, B. 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Another might be local glaze-making rather than foreign influence, supported by the similarility between the chemical and microstructural features of pre-Islamic white opaque glazes and that on the first tin-opacified wares&lt;ref name=Mason/&gt;
[[File:Dutch delft tile topsham.JPG|thumb|Dutch [[delftware]] tin-glazed tile]]

From the Middle East, tin-glaze spread through the Islamic world to [[Hispano-Moresque ware|Spain]]. In the 13th century, tin glazes reached [[Italy]], where the earliest recorded reference to their use is in the 1330s,&lt;ref&gt;’Ceramic Glazes’ C.W.Parmelee. ''Industrial Publications, Inc''. Chicago. 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the emergence of Italian [[Maiolica]]. Amongst others, [[Luca della Robbia]], born in Florence about 1400, used tin oxide as an opacifier in glazes.&lt;ref&gt;’Pottery And Ceramics.’ E.Rosenthal. Pelican Books. Harmondsworth. 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Potters began to draw polychrome paintings on the white opaque surface with metallic oxides such as cobalt oxide and to produce [[lustreware]]. The off-white fired body of [[Delftware]] and English [[Majolica]] was made to appear white, and hence mimic the appearance of Chinese porcelain, by the application of a glaze opacified and coloured white by the addition of tin oxide.&lt;ref&gt;’Pottery And Ceramics.’ E.Rosenthal. ''Pelican Books''. Harmondsworth. 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;’Pottery’ C.J.Noke &amp; H.J.Plant. Sir Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons, Ltd. London. 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current use and alternatives===
Tin oxide has been widely used as the opacifier in sanitaryware glazes.&lt;ref&gt;''Ceramics Glaze Technology.'' J. R. Taylor &amp; A. C. Bull. The Institute Of Ceramics &amp; Pergamon Press. Oxford. 1986&lt;/ref&gt; In this application, additions of up to 6% are reported to be in then-current use.&lt;ref&gt;’Sanitaryware’. D.Fortuna. ''Gruppo Editoriale Faenza Editrice s.p.a''. Florence. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of tin oxide rose considerably during the 1914-1918 war, and resulted in a search for cheaper alternatives.&lt;ref name="Ceramics Glaze Technology 1986"/&gt; The first successful replacement was [[zirconia]] and later [[zircon]].&lt;ref&gt;‘Ceramics Glaze Technology.’ J.R.Taylor &amp; A.C.Bull. ''The Institute Of Ceramics &amp; Pergamon Press''. Oxford. 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst zirconium compounds are not as effective their low price led to a gradual increase in popularity with an associated reduction in use of tin oxide. Today, tin oxide usage in glazes finds limited use in conjunction with zircon compounds, although it is generally restricted to specialist low temperature applications and use by studio potters.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ceramic Glazes 1960"&gt;‘Ceramic Glazes.’ F.Singer &amp; W.L.German. ''Borax Consolidated Limited''. London. 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;  The whiteness resulting from the use of zirconia has been described as more ''clinical'' than that from tin oxide, and is consequently preferred in some applications.&lt;ref&gt;'Science For Craft Potters And Enamellers.' K.Shaw. ''A.H.&amp; A.W.Reed.'' Wellington. 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The Koninklijke Tichelaar Makkum factory, or Royal Tichelaar Makkum, based in [[Makkum, Wûnseradiel|Makkum]], [[Friesland]] continue the production [[Delftware]] using tin-glazed [[earthenware]].&lt;ref&gt;''Klei/Glas/Keram''. 13, No.4, 1992. Pg.103-106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tichelaar.nl]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The nature of tin glaze==
[[File:SnO2powder.jpg|thumb|[[Tin dioxide]], the raw ingredient in Tin-glazing.]]
For glaze use only one tin compound, tin (IV) oxide [[Tin dioxide]] (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and also called stannic acid,&lt;ref&gt;’A Treatise On Ceramic Industries.’ E.Bourry. Fourth edition. ''Scott, Greenwood &amp; Son''. London. 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; is commercially exploited. Opacity is produced in glazes by the addition of some substance to scatter and reflect some of the incident light. 

The opacity of glaze could be determined by the particles which spread through the glaze, therefore the light is absorbed by the particles, being scattered back before reaching the ceramic body, leading to the opaque glaze. As a result, the concentration of the absorbing or scattering particles in the glaze could determine the degree of opacification. Generally speaking, the more different the [[refractive index]] between the particles and the glaze matrix, the larger the opacity. Similarly, the closer the particle size to the light wavelength (100-1000&amp;nbsp;nm for [[visible light]]) and the more irregular the surface, the larger the degree of opacification.

[[tin dioxide|Tin oxide]] remains in suspension in vitreous matrix of the fired glazes, and, with its high refractive index being sufficiently different from the matrix, light is scattered, and hence increases the [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]] of the glaze. The degree of dissolution increases with the firing temperature, and hence the extent of opacity diminishes.&lt;ref&gt;’A Treatise On Ceramic Industries.’ E.Bourry. Fourth edition. Scott, Greenwood &amp; son. London. 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; Although dependent on the other constituents the solubility of tin oxide in glaze melts is generally low. Its solubility is increased by Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and reduced by CaO, BaO, ZnO, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and to a limited extent PbO.&lt;ref name="C.W.Parmelee 1973"/&gt;

Some research on medieval tin glaze has shown that the particle size of tin oxide which appears as cassiterite is around several hundred nanometer, which corresponds to the range of wavelength of visible light.&lt;ref name=Molera1999&gt;Molera, J., Pradell T., Salvadó, N. and Vendrell-Saz, M. "Evidence of Tin Oxide Recrystallization in Opacified Lead Glazes", ''Journal of American Ceramic Society'', 1999, 82:2871-2875&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the tin oxide is presented not only as small crystals but also as aggregates of particles. These factors – the high refractive index, the low solubility in glazes and the particle size make tin oxide an excellent opacifier.    

In the beginning of the use of tin oxide, it is mainly viewed as a [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]] layer between the glaze and ceramic body. This could be seen from the [[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] photomicrographs of some earlier Islamic glazed ceramics, of which the particles of tin oxide are concentrated at the interface, together with the existence of [[wollastonite]], [[diopside]] and air bubble as other opacifiers.&lt;ref name=Manson&gt;Manson, R. B., and M. S. Tite, "The beginnings of tin-opacification of pottery glazes", ''Journal of Archaeological Science'' 39:41-58, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  The microanalysis of later tin glazes reveals the distribution of tin oxide through the glazes rather than just at the interface, which indicates that tin oxide is really acting as an [[opacifier]] instead of only a surface coating layer.&lt;ref name=Manson/&gt;

Lead is usually brought into the glazes with tin oxide. The reaction between lead and tin oxide results in the [[Recrystallization (metallurgy)|recrystallisation]] of tin oxide,&lt;ref name=Molera1999/&gt; and thus enhances the degree of opacification in tin-opacified glazes than in tin-opacified glass. A high PbO/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ratio is often found in ancient glazes. During the firing process, [[lead(II) oxide|lead oxide]] reacts with quartz at approximately 550℃ to form PbSiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which then reacts with tin oxide to produce lead-tin oxide (PbSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) at a temperature higher than 600℃. After the formation of lead-tin oxide, the melting of PbSiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, PbO and PbSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; occurs at the temperature in the range of 700℃ to 750℃, resulting in the dissolution of PbSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The degree of the crystallisation of SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increases with the increasing of temperature. During either heating or cooling, the recrystallisation is taken place until the supply of tin is exhausted. In the second heating, lead in the form of lead oxide no longer reacts with tin oxide to form lead silicate, thus the recrystallised [[cassiterite]] (SnO2) remain undissolved and precipitate in the glazes. The [[nucleation]] and [[Crystal growth|growth]] rates of the precipitation depend upon temperature and time. The particle size of the cassiterite developed is also dependent on the temperature, and smaller than that used in the very beginning. It is the smaller particle size of the recrystallised SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in glazes that increases the opacity in tin-opacified glazes. Besides the increasing the opacity, the high lead oxide to tin oxide ratio also reduces the melting point of glazes, lead to a lower firing temperature during production.&lt;ref&gt;Tite, M. S., T. Pradell, and A. Shortland. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest [[Middle East]]ern tin glazes used [[calcium]], [[lead]] and [[sodium]] [[Chemical compound|compounds]]  as fluxes in combination with the [[silica]] in silica. An Islamic opaque white glaze has been analysed, and is quoted below as a Seger formula:&lt;ref&gt;al-Saad, Z. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  
::*PbO=0.32
::*CaO=0.32
::*K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O=0.03
::*Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O=0.29
::*MgO=0.04
::*Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;=0.03
::*SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=1.73
::*SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=0.07

In this recipe, the addition of [[alkali]] helps to increase the hardness of the surface and clarify the colour of the glaze as well. With the development of tin glazes, the significant amount of tin oxide indicates its deliberate addition as an opacifier. A recipe involving the use of three ingredients was given in Abu’l-Qasim’s treatise from [[Iran|Persia]] in the 14th century: a glass-[[frit]] of [[quartz]] and [[potash]], a lead-tin [[calx]] and a [[calcination]] of [[limestone]] and quartz.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, J. 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, with the spread of tin glazes, lead gradually became the principal background in tin glazes, though a small proportion of alkali was still introduced in order to increase the [[fusibility]]. No specific recipes alluding to tin glazes in [[Spain]] have been found in ancient archives. However, recent research has shown that, at least since the 10th century AD, most Islamic white glazes in Spain were lead-silica glazes with tin oxide as an opacifier. That is, no alkaline glazes or lead-alkaline glazes have been found.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Molera, J., M. Vendrell-Saz, and J. Pérez-Arantegui. 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Piccolpasso recorded several glazes used in Italy in the 1550s, all variations of lead, tin, lime, soda and potash glazes.  It is believed early Spanish glazes were similar.&lt;ref name=CaigerSmith73/&gt;

A Seger analysis of a tin glaze from the early 20th century is:&lt;ref&gt;'A Text-Book On Ceramic Calculations.' W.Jackson. ''Longhmans, Green And Co.'' London. 1904.&lt;/ref&gt;
::*PbO=0.52
::*CaO=0.16
::*K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O=0.03
::*Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O=0.29
::*Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;=0.15
::*SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=2.77
::*SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=0.23

A more recent recipe is:&lt;ref name=CaigerSmith73/&gt;
::*[[Lead]] bisilicate [[frit]]: 74%
::*[[China clay]]: 10%
::*[[Calcium carbonate|Whiting]]: 2%
::*[[Flint]]: 4%
::*[[Tin oxide]]: 10%
And another is:&lt;ref name="Ceramics Glaze Technology 1986"/&gt;
::*Potassium [[feldspar]]: 65%
::*[[Calcium carbonate|Limestone]]: 11%
::*[[Silica]]: 11%
::*[[Zinc oxide]]: 9%
::*[[Tin oxide]]: 4%

===As a glaze colorant===
In combination with chromium compounds addition of 0.5 - 1.5% tin oxide to a glaze result in a pink colour, with such glazes being known as Chrome-tin pinks.&lt;ref&gt;‘An Introduction To The Technology Of Pottery.’ P.Rado. ''The Institute Of Ceramics''. Oxford. 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘Ceramics Glaze Technology.’ J.R.Taylor &amp; A.C.Bull. ''The Institute Of Ceramics &amp; Pergamon Press.'' Oxford. 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with small additions of zinc oxide and titanium oxide, additions of tin oxide up to 18% to lead glazes can produce a satin or vellum surface finish.&lt;ref name="Ceramic Glazes 1960"/&gt; The firing temperatures of such glazes are low, in the region of 950 – 1000 ℃ because of the variable degrees of solution of the individual oxides.&lt;ref name="Ceramics Glaze Technology 1986"/&gt; The amount of tin oxide used for coloured glazes depends upon the opacifying property of the chosen chromophore and the intensity of the colour desired; if a deep colour is required less opacifier will be needed than for pastel shades.&lt;ref&gt;’Ceramic Glazes’ C.W.Parmelee. ''Industrial Publications, Inc.'' Chicago. 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manufacture===

Though the recipe of tin glazes may differ in different sites and periods, the process of the production of tin glazes is similar. Generally speaking, the first step of the production of tin glazes is to mix tin and lead in order to form oxides, which was then added to a glaze matrix (alkali-silicate glaze, for example) and heated.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, S. R. 1997&lt;/ref&gt; After the mixture cooled, the tin oxide crystallises as what has been mentioned above, therefore generates the so-called white tin-opacified glazes. Besides, the body of tin-opacified wares is generally [[List of vineyard soil types|calcareous clays]] containing 15-25% CaO, of which the [[thermal expansion coefficient]] is close to that of tin glazes, thus avoid [[crazing]] during the firing process.&lt;ref&gt;Tite, M. S. 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ravaglioli, A., A. Keajewski, M. S. Tite, R. R. Burn, P. A. Simpson, and G. C. Bojani. 1996&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the calcareous clay fired in an oxidising atmosphere results in a buff colour, thus lower the concentration of tin oxide used &lt;ref&gt;Tite, M. S., Freestone, I. and Manson, R.B., "Lead glazes in antiquity - methods of production and reasons for use", ''archaeometry'', 1998, 40:241-260&lt;/ref&gt;

The white opaque surface makes tin glaze a good base for painted decoration. The decoration is applied as metallic oxides, most commonly [[cobalt oxide]] for blue, [[Copper(II) oxide|copper oxide]] for green, [[iron oxide]] for brown, [[manganese dioxide]] for purple-brown and [[antimony]] for yellow.  Late Italian [[maiolica]] blended oxides to produce detailed and realistic polychrome paintings, called ''istoriato''. To these oxides modern potters are able to add powdered ceramic colours made from combinations of oxide, sometimes [[frit]]ted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pottersconnection.co.uk/shop/33/index.htm Potters Connection]&lt;/ref&gt; In the sixteenth century, the use of subtle and blended colours which were not strong enough to penetrate the opaque glaze made the delicate control of ton-value possible, and the painting therefore had to be done on the glaze surface, which then becomes a common manner of painting on tin-glazed wares.&lt;ref name=CaigerSmith73/&gt;

The pottery vessels are biscuit fired, usually between 900 ℃ and 1000 ℃. The fired vessel is dipped in a liquid glaze [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] which sticks to it, leaving a smooth and absorbent surface when dry. On this surface colours are applied by brush, the colours made from powered oxides mixed with water to a consistency of water-colour paint, sometimes with the addition of a binding agent such as [[gum arabic]].  The unfired glaze absorbs the pigment like [[fresco]], making errors difficult to correct but preserving the brilliant colors of the oxides when fired.  The glazed and decorated vessels are returned to the kiln for a second firing, usually between 1000 and 1120 ℃ (the higher temperatures used by modern potters). Lustered wares have a third firing at a lower temperature, necessitating a delicate control of the amount of oxygen in the kiln atmosphere and therefore a flame-burning kiln.

Traditional kilns were wood firing, which required the pots to be protected in the glaze and luster firings by [[saggar]]s or to be fired in a [[muffle]] kiln. Except for those making luster ware, modern tin-glaze potters use electric kilns.

The recrystallisation of tin oxide during the firing provides evidence of the slightly different methods of different production sites, as the crystal size, the distribution and the concentration may be influenced. For instance, the analysis of the 14th century Islamic tin glazes from eastern Spain indicates that these samples may be produced by non-fritting methods, as the heterogeneous distribution of tin oxides may be the remains of original grains of tin oxides.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; 

The interaction between glaze and body also give clues to different handling and firing processes. As mentioned above, tin glaze suspension is applied to [[biscuit (pottery)|bisque or biscuit]] body made of calcareous clay with high content of [[calcium oxide]]. This could be inferred from the absence of trapped glaze bubbles. If it is applied to an unfired body, the [[calcium carbonate]] will decompose, generating [[carbon dioxide]], the releasing of which from the body to the glaze results in trapped bubbles in the glaze layers.

==History==
Trinity Western University traces its history back to 1957, when a committee was established by the [[Evangelical Free Church of America]] to study and consider the feasibility of a liberal arts college on North America's [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific Coast]]. The committee decided on a location between [[Vancouver]] and [[Seattle]] in rural British Columbia, in what is now the [[Township of Langley]]. 
Trinity Junior College began as a two-year college in 1962, and its name was changed to Trinity Western College 10 years later, following a significant period of growth in enrollment and program options. After 20 years as a transfer college, Trinity Western began awarding [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]] degrees in 1980.  
In 1985 the British Columbia Provincial Government legislated the institution to its current position as a privately funded Christian university and it became known as Trinity Western University.&lt;ref name=history0708&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.twu.ca/academics/calendar/ac0708-what-twu-is-all-about.pdf|title=What Trinity Western University is All About|accessdate=February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305001125/http://www.twu.ca/academics/calendar/ac0708-what-twu-is-all-about.pdf|archive-date=March 5, 2009|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the fourth-oldest university in the province of British Columbia after [[UBC|the University of British Columbia]], the University of Victoria, and [[Emily Carr University of Art and Design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wiki|url=https://www2.viu.ca/homeroom/content/timeline/1950s/1960.htm|title=British Columbia History of Higher Education Timeline|publisher=Vancouver Island University |year=1997|accessdate=January 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
Trinity Western University is an independent, privately supported institution, offering a liberal arts education. Since its founding in 1962, it has identified as a Christian institution, although it has always been governed independently from any church or religious organization. It is currently administered by a 14-member Board of Governors, to which the President reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://twu.ca/governance/board/ |title=Trinity Western University - Board of Governors |publisher=Twu.ca |accessdate=August 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902022937/http://www.twu.ca/governance/board/ |archivedate=September 2, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current president, Robert Kuhn, was the interim president before his inauguration in 2014.

Undergraduates fulfill general education requirements, choose among a wide variety of elective courses, and pursue departmental concentrations and interdisciplinary certificate programs. Students usually take classes through the university's semester system, with three semesters taking place each year. The fall semester lasts from September to December, and the spring semester from January to April. For students wishing to take classes over summer, the university offers several courses on campus as well as travel studies through its summer semester programming, which runs from May to August.

Graduate students take courses through the Faculty of Graduate Studies and [[Associated Canadian Theological Schools|ACTS Seminaries]]. Master's degree programs are available in the [[humanities]], [[education]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], [[business]], [[nursing]], and [[theology]].

The university hosts a number of research institutes and centres, including the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] Institute, [[Gender Studies]] Institute, Religion, Culture and Conflict Research Group, [[Septuagint]] Institute, Centre for Entrepreneurial Leadership, Centre for Spiritual Formation in Higher Education, [[Religion in Canada]] Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.twu.ca/research/ |title=Trinity Western University - Office of Research |publisher=Twu.ca |accessdate=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as, the Institute of Indigenous Issues and Perspectives.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Trinity Western's students are from all 10 [[provinces]], 37 [[U.S. state]]s, and 33 foreign countries.

Undergraduate courses in the humanities are traditionally either seminars or lectures held one- or two-times a week with an additional conversation-based seminar called a "discussion group". To graduate, all students must complete a [[liberal arts]] [[Core curriculum#Core curriculum|core curriculum]] known as the "University Core", comprising 18 classes of various subjects. Students have a high degree of latitude in creating a self-structured Core, which allows students to study subjects of interest outside their chosen major. Most of the Core classes at Trinity Western are led by a full-time professor (as opposed to a teaching assistant).{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Within the 18 classes, students complete a two-semester English language requirement, along with courses from the [[fine art]]s, [[natural science]]s, [[philosophy]], [[history]], [[sociology]], and [[religious studies]] departments, two courses of [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary studies]], and up to three [[physical education]] courses.

In addition to the Core, students are required to complete an [[academic major]]. Trinity Western University grants [[bachelor's degrees]] in 45 academic majors, and 56 minors, concentrations, or certificates, with over 1,200 courses from which to choose.&lt;ref name=fastfacts /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Canada |url=http://twu.ca/undergraduate/academics/majors-and-programs/ |title=Trinity Western University |publisher=Twu.ca |accessdate=August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students may choose courses from any of the university's faculties or schools:

* School of the Arts, Media + Culture
* School of Business
* School of Human Kinetics

Advanced Education Minister [[Amrik Virk]] revoked the province's approval of the proposed law school at Trinity Western University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/trinity-western-law-school-b-c-advanced-education-minister-revokes-approval-1.2870640 Trinity Western law school: B.C. advanced education minister revokes approval | CBC] (December 11, 2014) Retrieved on December 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In his letter to the school's administration, he expressed the importance of the legal process and encouraged TWU to re-apply when the court cases have been settled.

===Christian Creed and Covenant===
The university was founded by a committee commissioned by the [[Evangelical Free Church of America]] to establish a Christian liberal arts college. As such, the committee's mission has shaped the campus and the university. Trinity Western University has maintained extremely close ties with the broader [[Christian church]], and historically has had close relationships with the [[Evangelical]] and [[Mainline Protestant]] denominations, as well as with the [[Mennonite]] tradition recently. This has also resulted in the university having a significant American influence when compared with other Canadian universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://twu.ca/life/community/traditions/can-am-game.html |title=Can-Am Hockey Game |publisher=Twu.ca |accessdate=August 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918060015/http://www.twu.ca/life/community/traditions/can-am-game.html |archivedate=September 18, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than one out of every six students is American.&lt;ref name=fastfacts /&gt;

The university previously mandated that all students abide by a code of conduct called the Community Covenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/07/02/court-upholds-law-societys-decision-not-to-accredit-trinity-western-university.html|quote=Trinity Western University in Langley, B.C. plans to open a law school in 2015.

Despite some efforts by TWU to contend that the Community Covenant does not operate in a discriminatory fashion, it is self-evident that it does." The court ruling noted that "failure to adhere to the conduct imposed by the Community Covenant, carries with it serious consequences."&lt;ref name=2015onsc/&gt; The covenant mandated "at a minimum, suspension" for "sexual intimacy involving persons of the same sex."&lt;ref name=2015onsc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontariocourts.ca/scj/files/judgments/2015ONSC4250.pdf|title=Trinity Western University v.

[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and [[Jews|Hebrew]] professors are also on staff.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Approximately 80% of undergraduates enrolled self-identify as Christian. &lt;!--Denominations and traditions with significant representation in the makeup of the university include the Evangelical, mainline Protestant, Mennonite, [[Anglican]], [[Catholic]], and [[Pentecostal]] denominations. [[Jewish]] and [[Muslim]] students also attend, as do [[Buddhists]] and students of [[Atheism|no faith]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}--&gt; There are many Christian clubs, organizations, and ministries on campus. There is no compulsory participation in any religious liturgies. Students and clubs of other religious denominations are welcomed and supported. Nearly every resident hall has a [[Chaplain]] in residence. In the morning on every weekday there is [[Chapel]], at which attendance is voluntary, and [[Eucharist|communion]] is offered each Friday. Within the university Core, students are required four terms of Religious Studies. One term is allotted to a Survey of the [[Old Testament]], and one to a Survey of the [[New Testament]]. Another term must be a class in Religious and Cultural studies.

===Insignia and symbols===

Trinity Western's motto is Turris Fortis Deus Noster. The Latin motto is translated as "A Mighty Fortress is Our God". The inspiration for the motto came from a famous hymn of the same name written by [[Martin Luther]].

The Coat of Arms of Trinity Western University depicts an Azure shield enshrined with an Or Trinity Cross and an Or B.C. sun. Surrounding the shield are a Pioneer holding a rifle and an Aboriginal Chief wearing a headdress and carrying a talking stick, both of the mid 19th century. The two are standing with the shield on a field of [[Pacific Dogwood]]s, the provincial flower of British Columbia. Above the shield are gold and blue banners, and protecting it is the helmet of salvation. Above the banners is Old Fort Langley, on which the Hudson Bay flag is flying. Surrounding the shield is an escroll on which the University motto is written. The Coat of Arms was granted by the Royal College of Arms, and was presented to then-university president R. Neil Snider in 1986 by the Lieutenant Governor of B.C. on behalf of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.twu.ca/sites/magazine/no-22/back-40/default.html |title=Flags, Flowers, and Fur Traders &amp;#124; Issue No. 22 - Trinity Western Magazine |publisher=Twu.ca |accessdate=September 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610184211/http://www.twu.ca/sites/magazine/no-22/back-40/default.html |archivedate=June 10, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A torch symbol is also used prevalently at the university, as the Coat of Arms is reserved to authenticate the highest official University academic and legal documents.

[[Spartiate|Spartans]] is the nickname of the varsity teams that compete for Trinity Western University. The name, which comes from the Ancient Greek civilization of Sparta, originated when the university's first intercollegiate team the men's basketball team, began competing in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.twu.ca/sites/magazine/no-15/athletics/default.html |title=Spartan Logo Reborn &amp;#124; Issue No. 15 - Trinity Western Magazine |publisher=Twu.ca |accessdate=September 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918064611/http://www.twu.ca/sites/magazine/no-15/athletics/default.html |archive-date=September 18, 2011 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campus is situated about 45 minutes southeast from [[Vancouver]] and about 2 hours north from [[Seattle]].

Campus buildings vary in age and style from Hanson Chapel, completed in 1962 (the first building completed on campus), to the Skidmore Hall dormitory, completed in 2017. Today the campus consists of 35 buildings and residence halls that house the university's various departments and students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.twu.ca/about/campus-locations/campus-map |title=Trinity Western University - Campus Map|publisher=Twu.ca |accessdate=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture on campus is inspired by British Columbia, Rural B.C., and the Pacific Northwest. Modern red brick covers Alloway Library, Larsen Atrium, and Stanley Nelson Student Centre at the main part of campus. Other significant buildings on campus include Robert N. Thompson Building which houses the Political Science, History, English, and Geography departments. The newly built and yet to be named Music Building is home to the School of Art, Media + Culture. The Faculty of Natural and Applied Sciences are housed in the Neufeld Science Centre, which experienced a major renovation in 2011, and the Vernon Stromback Centre at the east end of campus. In total there are 33 buildings on the university campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Canada |url=http://twu.ca/campus/map-numerical.html |title=Trinity Western University |publisher=Twu.ca |accessdate=September 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815174054/http://twu.ca/campus/map-numerical.html |archivedate=August 15, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During President Raymond's tenure, the university has built the Music Building in 2010, and in 2011 Fraser Hall and the Neufeld Science Centre received major renovations in 2011.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} In 2012 the Vernon Strombeck Centre received a significant interior and exterior renovation, and in 2013 the prominent Robert N.

===Athletic facilities===

Rogers Field is located on the northeast edge of campus, and is the home pitch to the women's and men's varsity soccer teams. In 2008 Rogers Field was the host venue as the Spartans women's soccer team won the CIS Championship. It also hosted the men's CIS Championship in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.cis-sic.ca/championships/msoc/past_champs |title=CIS : Past CIS Champions |publisher=English.cis-sic.ca |accessdate=September 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David E. Enarson Gymnasium has been the university's indoor sports venue since it was built in 1969. In 2009, the newly built [[Langley Events Centre]] replaced Enarson as the home of Spartans basketball and volleyball, and replaced George Preston Arena as the home of Spartans hockey. The LEC was the host venue when the Spartans' men's volleyball team won the CIS Championship in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.cis-sic.ca/championships/mvball/past_champs |title=CIS : Past Champions |publisher=English.cis-sic.ca |accessdate=September 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Enarson Gymnasium houses the university's athletic offices and strength and conditioning room, hosts physical education classes and intramurals, and occasionally varsity sports events. It is also the new home court for the [[Vancouver Dragons]] of the [[Minor League Basketball Association]]. 

Tennis courts, an indoor rock wall, and practice fields are also located on campus. Though the university does not sponsor rowing teams, there are rowing facilities on the [[Fraser River]].

;Ottawa - Booth House
[[File:Booth House.JPG|right|thumb|The Laurentian Leadership Centre, in Ottawa]] The home of the Laurentian Leadership Centre in Ottawa is the [[Booth House (Ottawa)|Booth House]], an historic mansion in [[Downtown Ottawa]] and a [[National Historic Site of Canada]]. Built in 1901 as the home of lumber and railway baron [[John Rudolphus Booth|John R. Booth]], Trinity Western purchased the building in 2000. Located on [[Metcalfe Street (Ottawa)|Metcalfe Street]] near [[Somerset Street (Ottawa)|Somerset]], the campus is within minutes of the [[Canadian Parliament]] and many important governmental ministries, departments, and embassies.

The '''Laurentian Leadership Centre''' program, an extension of Trinity Western University, offers third and fourth year students, and recent graduates, an opportunity to experience a fully credited semester of study as well as a [[Parliamentary]], communications, business or NGO internship in Canada's national capital, [[Ottawa]], Ontario. Although the program is open to students of any major, it is primarily designed for those who plan a career in political science, business, communications, history or international studies. The program is also open to visiting students from other universities.

The LLC is located a few blocks away from [[Parliament Hill]], Ottawa. The 20 students accepted to the program each semester take three academic courses in: Canadian Governmental Leadership, Ethics &amp; Public Affairs, and Law &amp; Public Policy. Courses are taught both by TWU professors as well as national and international leaders and guest speakers.

The internship program is the distinguishing feature of the Laurentian Leadership Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Janet Epp-Buckingham |url=https://canadianchristianity.com/twu-proposes-law-school-4326/ |title=Trinity Western University proposes Law School |publisher=Canadian Christianity |date=September 18, 2012 |accessdate=January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.david-kilgour.com/faith/trinity.htm |title=Christian Students as Leaders in Public Life |publisher=David-kilgour.com |date=October 9, 2002 |accessdate=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LLC director places each student in an internship relevant to his or her academic or career interest. Internships fall into a number of categories: government, corporate, media, communications, and non-governmental. Previous internships have included: the [[Office of the Prime Minister (Canada)|Prime Minister's Office]] (which hosts one intern each semester), foreign embassies, offices of [[Members of Parliament]] and [[Senate of Canada|Senators]], the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], [[Mitel]], [[World Vision]], [[Make Poverty History]], the [[National Arts Centre]], [[RBC Capital Markets]], the [[Ottawa Citizen]] newspaper, and a variety of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.twu.ca/sites/laurentian/program/past.html |title=Past Internships |publisher=Twu.ca |accessdate=August 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020074059/http://www.twu.ca/sites/laurentian/program/past.html |archive-date=October 20, 2012 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often these internships lead to full-time employment.  Currently, there are several LLC graduates with positions in the PMO as well as in multiple ministries, political parties across Canada, and businesses from finance to high tech.

While participating in the program, students reside in an historic mansion on Metcalfe Street, the famous [[Booth House (Ottawa)|Booth House]], which is designated as a [[National Historic Site of Canada]].

The current Director is Dr. Janet Epp Buckingham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Janet Epp Buckingham |url=http://www.cardus.ca/comment/article/758/ |title=Q&amp;A with Janet Epp Buckingham, director, Laurentian Leadership Centre &amp;#124; Cardus |publisher=Cardus.ca |date=December 5, 2008 |accessdate=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Bellingham
Located very close to the Canadian-U.S. border on the U.S. side, Trinity Western's [[Bellingham]] campus provides adult degree completion Bachelor of Arts programs in leadership, psychology and the [[social sciences]]. Students meet one night per week and one Saturday per course. Upon completion of each six-week course in succession, students may work to finish their bachelor's degree in as few as 18 months, depending upon the number of credits transferred. TWU Bellingham personalizes evaluation of students' past education and life experiences to recognize the skills and knowledge applied to degree requirements. Classes engage dynamic discussions, are learner-centred and success focused.

Trinity Western's Bellingham campus also hosts the unique Freshman FASTTrack program, a one-year program of liberal arts core courses for new freshman. The program is designed to aid the transition from high school to university, transferring into the four-year college or university of their choice. Subjects are integrated to maximize interdisciplinary learning. Using the cohort model, small classes involve dynamic discussions and are supported with learning coaches. This concentrated immersion style of learning results in students completing a full 31 semester college credits attending morning classes, leaving their afternoons and evenings free to work or study.

===Athletics===
{{Main|Trinity Western Spartans}}
Since its founding in 1962 Trinity Western has provided athletics for both women and men. Today, the university supports athletics at the varsity, club, and intramural levels. Its colours are gold and blue.

The university sponsors 11 men's and women's varsity sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twu.ca/athletics|title=Trinity Western Athletics|work=twu.ca|accessdate=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teams compete in [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]], the top university athletics league in Canada, with teams competing in the [[Canada West Universities Athletic Association]] at the regional level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadawest.org/sports/2010/8/2/Members.aspx |title=Canada West Universities Athletic Association - Canada West Members |publisher=Canadawest.org |accessdate=August 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819132643/http://www.canadawest.org/sports/2010/8/2/Members.aspx |archivedate=August 19, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Varsity teams competing in [[U Sports]] include men's and women's [[basketball]], [[soccer]], [[volleyball]], [[track and field]], and [[cross country running|cross country]].

In addition to varsity sports, Trinity Western hosts five club sports teams for students who wish to participate in athletics at a high level while not making the time commitment that would be needed to compete on a varsity team. Club teams include women's and men's basketball and soccer, and men's hockey. Each year, several dozen teams compete in [[intramurals]]. Intramurals are open to members of the university's faculty, staff, and students, though a team representing a residential hall must consist only of members of that hall. Along with the academic requirements for graduation, Trinity Western requires every undergraduate to complete three classes of physical education, one of which is a lab in the Concepts of Physical Health.

===Traditions===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
Over its fifty years of history, the university and its students have developed several traditions, some formal, others informal. Some of the more noteworthy traditions include the CanAm game, a hockey game played between a side of male American students and a side of female Canadian students. The game is often hotly contested given its "Battle of the Sexes" nature with national pride on the line as well. Orientation Week is held at the beginning of each year for incoming freshman and new students. Continuous aspects of Orientation Week have been the Banana Challenge, Dorm Skit Night, and visiting [[Stanley Park]]. Hootenany is held every year at Enarson Gym, and showcases some of the university's more talented, and weird acts. Every other Friday during the academic year "11:07", a student improv comedy show, is held in the theatre. 11:07 is often widely attended given many of the students inability to leave campus. Every year the art students have a Senior Show, which shows art ranging from installation, to sculpture, to painting, to video. Each April, the graduating seniors give themselves a Graduate Banquet. This is usually held at a hotel in [[Downtown Vancouver]], but in previous years has also taken place in [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]] and in Langley. On campus at the beginning of every hour, the Bell Tower tolls. Located near the centre of campus next to the library gardens, it is Trinity Western's tallest structure and its chimes can be heard across campus.

At Spartans' sporting events, students, alumni, and fans sing the Spartan Song, the [[fight song]] of the university. With their strong level of [[school spirit]], the university's fans have gained the nickname the "Spartan Faithful".&lt;ref&gt;[http://twu.ca/athletics/spartan/spartan-of-the-week/2008-2009/2008-10-26-spartan-faithful.html Home of the Faithful - The Legend Continues] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614084319/http://twu.ca/athletics/spartan/spartan-of-the-week/2008-2009/2008-10-26-spartan-faithful.html |date=June 14, 2012 }}.

==Controversies and court cases==

In November 2016 ''[[The Province]]'' reported on the school's acceptance or lack thereof of [[LGBTQ]] students. According to the story, gay students were subjected to a culture of shame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/queer-at-twu |title=A university's queer covenant: Is TWU controlling a culture of shame?|first=Bethany|last=Lindsay|accessdate=July 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching certification program accreditation lawsuit===
{{refimprove section|date=August 2012}}
{{Main|Trinity Western University v. British Columbia College of Teachers}}

In 1995, Trinity Western launched a teaching certification program, but the [[British Columbia College of Teachers]] denied accreditation of the university's program, arguing that the "Responsibilities of Membership" agreement students must sign (replaced in 2009 with the Community Covenant) is discriminatory and that those graduating from Trinity Western's program will discriminate against [[gay]] students.&lt;ref name="lexum 2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1867/index.do|title=~Supreme Court Judgments; Trinity Western University v. British Columbia College of Teachers|publisher=Lexum|date=May 17, 2001|accessdate=January 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower courts in British Columbia and, later, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], ruled in favour of Trinity Western University, stating that there was no basis for the BCCT's decision, and, moreover, that "the concern that graduates of TWU will act in a detrimental fashion in the classroom is not supported by any evidence".&lt;ref name="lexum 2001" /&gt;

The final analysis of the case, as reported by the Factum of the Intervener, the [[British Columbia Civil Liberties Association|B.C. Civil Liberties Association]], was that "In the circumstances of this case the Council of the B.C. College of Teachers failed to conduct such an enquiry and erroneously concluded that equality of rights on the basis of sexual orientation trump freedom of religion and association. They do not."

===Faculty of Law accreditation lawsuits===
Automatic accreditation of graduates from TWU's proposed faculty of law were approved by most of the provincial law societies across Canada in 2014, except the Law Society of Upper Canada (now the [[Law Society of Ontario]]) and the [[Nova Scotia Barristers' Society]]. On June 11, 2014, 3,210 of the [[Law Society of British Columbia]]'s 13,000 members voted in support of a resolution to reverse its decision to grant the faculty accreditation and requested that the province revoke its accreditation of the law program because of the view that it discriminates against unmarried couples and homosexual individuals. 968 members voted against with 8,822 not registering a vote.&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/trinity-western-law-school-loses-b-c-law-society-vote-1.2670688 |title=Trinity Western law school loses B.C. Law Society vote - British Columbia - CBC News |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 26, 2014 the governing members of the Law Society decided to hold a binding referendum of their membership to determine whether to revoke Trinity Western's accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/law-society-of-b-c-to-hold-binding-referendum-on-trinity-western-law-school-1.2778849|title=Law Society of B.C. to hold binding referendum on Trinity Western law school|work=CBC News |accessdate=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nova Scotia: ''Trinity Western University v Nova Scotia Barristers' Society'''''

The case was brought before the [[Nova Scotia Supreme Court]], arguing that denying automatic accreditation to TWU law graduates is an infringement on the students' right to freedom of religion.&lt;ref name="courts.ns.ca"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trinity Western University v. Nova Scotia Barristers' Society, 2015 NSSC 25|url=http://decisions.courts.ns.ca/nsc/nssc/en/item/100659/index.do|website=Nova Scotia Courts' Decision Database|publisher=Supreme Court of Nova Scotia|accessdate=July 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court ruled in favour of TWU; accepting the argument that, as a private religious university, the school had the right to uphold its own code of conduct "even if the effect of that code is to exclude... or offend others" and attempting to force TWU to change its community covenant was an infringement on religious freedom. The ruling further noted that the [[Nova Scotia Barristers' Society]] already requires all lawyers to follow its Code of Professional Conduct, which forbids all discrimination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Professional Conduct|url=http://nsbs.org/sites/default/files/cms/menu-pdf/2015-05-25_codeofconduct.pdf|publisher=Nova Scotia Barristers' Society|accessdate=July 8, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709153655/http://nsbs.org/sites/default/files/cms/menu-pdf/2015-05-25_codeofconduct.pdf|archivedate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the Community Covenant would not affect TWU graduates in their practice of law.&lt;ref name="courts.ns.ca"/&gt; The NSBS appealed to the [[Nova Scotia Court of Appeal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Order CA438894: Trinity Western University v Nova Scotia Barristers' Society|url=https://www.nsbs.org/sites/default/files/ftp/TWU_Submissions/Order_CA438894_2015-08-28.pdf|publisher=Nova Scotia Court of Appeal}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the appeals court upheld the previous decision.&lt;ref name="twu v nsbs appeal dec - CBC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Skenderis|first1=Stephanie|last2=Tattrie|first2=Jon|title=Trinity Western University wins legal battle with N.S.

'''Ontario: ''Trinity Western University v The Law Society of Upper Canada'''''

The case was brought before the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]], arguing that the law school graduates should not be refused automatic accreditation in Ontario by the Law Society of Upper Canada based on the Community Covenant Agreement of their school because it violates TWU students' rights to freedom of religion, freedom of expression, and freedom of association.&lt;ref name=oscj-decision&gt;{{cite web|title=Trinity Western University v.

The Court ruled in favour of the LSUC; stating that its refusal to automatically accredit TWU graduates was a reasonable balancing of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter rights]] to equality and freedom of religion, and that the refusal of automatic accreditation was not a violation of TWU students' rights to freedom of expression or freedom of association. The ruling further noted that TWU graduates are free to apply independently to the LSUC for accreditation following their graduation.&lt;ref name=ts-lsuc&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gallant|first1=Jacques|title=Ontario court upholds Law Society's decision not to accredit Trinity Western University|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/07/02/court-upholds-law-societys-decision-not-to-accredit-trinity-western-university.html|accessdate=July 3, 2015|work=Toronto Star|date=July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; TWU filed a motion to appeal with the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] September 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motions for Leave to Appeal - 2015|url=http://www.ontariocourts.ca/coa/en/leave/2015.htm|website=Court of Appeal for Ontario|publisher=Ontario Courts Judges Library|accessdate=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Court of Appeal upheld the ruling in favour of LSUC in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gallant|first1=Jacques|date=June 29, 2016|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/06/29/ontario-appeal-court-upholds-decision-not-to-accredit-evangelical-law-school.html|title=Ontario appeal court upholds decision not to accredit evangelical law school|work=Toronto Star|access-date=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''British Columbia: ''Trinity Western University v Law Society of British Columbia'''''

The case was brought before the [[Supreme Court of British Columbia]] on August 24, 2015 with hearings concluding on August 26. The [[Law Society of British Columbia]] had argued that TWU forcing students to sign the "Community Covenant" creates an unwelcome atmosphere for LGBTQ students and, given the high levels of competition for law school seats in Canada, would effectively create a two-tier system in which LGBTQ individuals would not have equal access to limited law school spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lawsociety.bc.ca/page.cfm?cid=4127&amp;t=Hearing-in-TWU-v.-Law-Society-of-BC-concludes|title=Hearing in TWU v.

The Court ruled in favour of TWU on December 10, 2015, overturning the LSBC's decision against accrediting the TWU law school and stating the LSBC did not "attempt to resolve the collision of the competing [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter]] interests [of equality before the law and freedom of religion]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trinity Western University v.

https://www.thelawyersdaily.ca/articles/4375&lt;/ref&gt; On June 15, 2018 the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the law societies in 7-2 decisions for both ''Trinity Western University v Law Society of Upper Canada'' and ''Law Society of British Columbia v Trinity Western University''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fine |first1=Sean |title=Supreme Court upholds provincial law societies’ right to reject graduates from proposed Christian law school |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-supreme-court-upholds-provincial-law-societies-right-to-reject/ |accessdate=June 15, 2018 |work=The Globe and Mail |date=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority decisions said that TWU's Community Covenant would deter LGBT students from attending the proposed law school and that equal access to legal education, diversity in the legal profession and preventing harm to LGBT students was in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Harris |first1=Kathleen |title=Trinity Western loses fight for Christian law school |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trinity-western-supreme-court-decision-1.4707240 |accessdate=June 15, 2018 |publisher=CBC News |date=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For vehicles such as cars, '''vehicle dynamics''' is the study of how the vehicle will react to driver inputs on a given road.

Vehicle dynamics is a part of [[engineering]] primarily based on [[classical mechanics]].

== Factors affecting vehicle dynamics ==
The aspects of a vehicle's design which affect the dynamics can be grouped into drivetrain and braking, suspension and steering, distribution of mass, aerodynamics and tires.

=== Drivetrain and braking ===
* [[Automobile layout]] (i.e. location of engine and driven wheels)
* [[Powertrain]]
* [[Braking system]]

=== Suspension and steering===
Some attributes relate to the [[geometry]] of the [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], [[steering]] and [[Rolling chassis|chassis]]. These include:
* [[Ackermann steering geometry]]
* [[Axle track]]
* [[Camber angle]]
* [[Caster angle]]
* [[Ride height]]
* [[Roll center]]
* [[Scrub radius]]
* [[Steering ratio]]
* [[Toe (automotive)|Toe]]
* [[Wheel alignment]]
* [[Wheelbase]]

=== Distribution of mass ===
Some attributes or aspects of vehicle dynamics are purely due to [[mass]] and its distribution. These include:
* [[Center of mass]]
* [[Moment of inertia]]
* [[Roll moment]]
* [[Sprung mass]]
* [[Unsprung mass]]
* [[Weight distribution]]

=== Aerodynamics ===
Some attributes or aspects of vehicle dynamics are purely [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]]. These include:
* [[Automobile drag coefficient]]
* [[Automotive aerodynamics]]
* [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|Center of pressure]]
* [[Downforce]]
* [[Ground effect in cars]]

=== Tires ===
Some attributes or aspects of vehicle dynamics can be attributed directly to the [[tire]]s. These include:
* [[Camber thrust]]
* [[Circle of forces]]
* [[Contact patch]]
* [[Cornering force]]
* [[Ground pressure]]
* [[Pacejka#The Pacejka .22Magic Formula.22 tire models|Pacejka's Magic Formula]]
* [[Pneumatic trail]]
* [[Radial Force Variation]]
* [[Relaxation length]]
* [[Rolling resistance]]
* [[Self aligning torque]]
* [[Skid (automobile)|Skid]]
* [[Slip angle]]
* [[Slip (vehicle dynamics)]]
* [[Spinout (driving)|Spinout]]
* [[Steering ratio#Alternate definition|Steering ratio]]
* [[Tire load sensitivity]]

== Vehicle behaviours ==
{{Main|Car handling}}
Some attributes or aspects of vehicle dynamics are purely [[Analytical dynamics|dynamic]]. These include:
* [[Body flex]]
* [[Body roll]]
* [[Bump Steer]]
* [[Bundorf analysis]]
* [[Directional stability]]
* [[Oversteer#Critical speed|Critical speed]]
* [[Noise, vibration, and harshness]]
* [[Flight dynamics (aircraft)|Pitch]]
* [[Ride quality]]
* [[Flight dynamics (aircraft)|Roll]]
* [[Speed wobble]]
* [[Understeer| Understeer, oversteer]], [[lift-off oversteer]], and [[fishtailing]]
* [[Weight transfer|Weight transfer and load transfer]]
* [[Yaw (rotation)|Yaw]]

==Analysis and simulation==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
The dynamic behavior of vehicles can be analysed in several different ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elkady|first=Mustafa|author2=Elmarakbi, Ahmed |title=Modelling and analysis of vehicle crash system integrated with different VDCS under high speed impacts|journal=Central European Journal of Engineering|date=26 September 2012|volume=2|issue=4|pages=585–602|doi=10.2478/s13531-012-0035-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be as straightforward as a simple [[Tuned mass damper|spring mass]] system, through a three-[[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degree of freedom]] (DoF) bicycle model, to a large degree of complexity using a [[Multibody system|multibody system simulation]] package such as  [[MSC Software|MSC ADAMS]] or [[Modelica]]. As computers have gotten faster, and software user interfaces have improved, commercial packages such as [[CarSim]] have become widely used in industry for rapidly evaluating hundreds of test conditions much faster than real time. Vehicle models are often simulated with [[Electronic stability control|advanced controller]] designs provided as software in the loop (SIL) with controller design software such as [[Simulink]], or with physical hardware in the loop (HIL).

Vehicle motions are largely due to the shear forces generated between the tires and road, and therefore the tire model is an essential part of the math model. The tire model must produce realistic shear forces during braking, acceleration, cornering, and combinations, on a range of surface conditions. Many models are in use. Most are semi-empirical, such as the [[Pacejka]] Magic Formula model.

[[Sim racing|Racing car games or simulators]] are also a form of vehicle dynamics simulation.  In early versions many simplifications were necessary in order to get real-time performance with reasonable graphics. However, improvements in computer speed have combined with interest in realistic physics, leading to [[driving simulator]]s that are used for vehicle engineering using detailed models such as [[CarSim]].

It is important that the models should agree with real world test results, hence many of the following tests are correlated against results from instrumented test vehicles.

Techniques include:
* [[Bundorf analysis|Linear range constant radius understeer]]
* Fishhook
* [[Frequency response]]
* [[Lane change]]
* [[Moose test]]
* Sinusoidal steering
* [[Skidpad]]
* [[Swept path analysis]]

'''Wilma Subra''' (born 1943) is an American environmental scientist.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon, Cohen. [http://articles.latimes.com/2001/oct/21/news/mn-59858 "Genial Grandmother Is 'Top Gun' in Environmental Activism"], Associated Press, October 21, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; She is President of the Subra Company, an environmental consulting firm.&lt;ref name=epabio&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/air/ej/conference2007/Wilma_Subra_Bio.pdf "Biography of Wilma Subra"], Environmental Protection Agency, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subra was born in [[Morgan City, Louisiana]], and was raised there and in nearby [[Bayou Vista, Louisiana|Bayou Vista]]. Her father was a chemist, and her grandfather an oyster fisherman.
