'''Albert Heijn''' ([[Zaandam]], 25 January 1927 – [[Hereford]], 13 January 2011) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[entrepreneur]], major stock holder and founder and [[chairman]] of the board of [[Ahold]].&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9898659a-2590-11e0-8258-00144feab49a.html Obituary: Grocer who felt empathy for the shopper], Phil Davison, Financial Times, 21 January 2011 (registration required)&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert was the grandson of his namesake [[Albert Heijn (born 1865)|Albert Heijn]] (1865–1945), who began the family business with a single grocery store in [[Oostzaan]] and after extending to multiple stores laid the foundation of the same named leading Dutch [[Albert Heijn|retail chain]], which was expanded by Albert into a [[Multinational corporation|multinational company]]. Albert introduced the [[supermarket]] store model in the Netherlands and was instrumental behind several innovations in the retail industry such as the passing of an international standard for [[bar code]]s in 1974. He was [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Ahold until 1989.

His brother and business partner [[Gerrit Jan Heijn]] was murdered after being kidnapped in September 1987.&lt;ref name="FT" /&gt;

In 1989 he was honored with the ''Sydney R. Rabb Award'' by the [[Food Marketing Institute]] making him the first non-American to win this prestigious award.

Albert Heijn had lived at Pudleston Court in [[Herefordshire]], [[England]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-12191672 Ex-supermarket boss Albert Heijn dies in Herefordshire], BBC News, 14 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/herefordandworcester/hi/people_and_places/newsid_9361000/9361814.stm Albert Heijn - the supermarket millionaire], BBC Hereford and Worcester, 14 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; for many years when he died, and was in no way formally involved with Ahold at the time of his death, although he at times commented upon the state of the company. In Hereford he founded a new company called Eign Enterprises&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cylex-uk.co.uk/company/eign-enterprises-16106200.html Eign Enterprises]&lt;/ref&gt; (named after the English pronunciation of his surname) which established shops, restaurants, hotels and other enterprises in the local region. For this he was named ''Honorary Freeman of the City of Hereford''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herefordshirejournals.com/2011/01/20/tributes-to-grocer-who-revamped-city-eyesore/ Tributes to ‘grocer’ who revamped eyesore], Herefordshire Journals, 20 January 2011 ([https://www.webcitation.org/60IAXlAEo WebCite archive])&lt;/ref&gt; in 2002.

'''Rudi André Kamperveen''' (September 27, 1924 – December 8, 1982) was a [[Suriname]]se football player, sports administrator, politician and businessman.

During his playing career, the centre forward represented and captained the [[Suriname national football team]] in the 1940s. He played professionally in Brazil ([[Paysandu Sport Club]]) and Netherlands during his playing career, becoming the first Surinamese player to play professionally in the Netherlands in the process while plying his trade for [[HFC Haarlem]].

After his playing career he became Minister for Sport in Suriname. He also helped establish the [[Caribbean Football Union]] which was formed in 1978 and he was selected as the union's first President. He was also a vice-president of [[FIFA]].

He was killed in 1982 as part of the [[December murders]]. His body reportedly showed injuries to the jaw and a swollen face, 18 bullet wounds in the chest, a shot wound in the right temple, a fractured femur and a fractured arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Rights Committee|url=http://www.bayefsky.com/pdf/101_suriname146b.pdf|publisher=bayefsky.com|accessdate=29 February 2012|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was inducted into the [[CONCACAF]] hall of fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andres Kamperveen|url=http://www.concacaf.com/page/HallOfFameDetail/0,,12813~1769098,00.html|publisher=CONCACAF|accessdate=29 February 2012|date=31 August 1990|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510215513/http://www.concacaf.com/page/HallOfFameDetail/0,,12813~1769098,00.html|archive-date=2012-05-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[André Kamperveen Stadion]] is named in his honour.

==Early life==
Known as Suriname’s Man of the People, Kamperveen or 'Ampie' as he was more commonly called was born 27 September 1924 in [[Paramaribo]], [[Surinam (Dutch colony)|Surinam]]. Having pursued [[Sport of athletics|athletics]], [[basketball]], [[boxing]] and [[judo]], [[association football|football]] was his first love and the sport he was best at. He started playing as an 11-year old on the Dr. Sophie Redmond Straat and signs of potential were noticeable at an early age. In 1942 he was called up for [[military service]] at the age of 18.&lt;ref name = "kamperveen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/stut004eers01_01/stut004eers01_01_0117.php|title=Kamperveen, André; De eerste Surinaamse sportencyclopedie (1893-1988) |publisher=Alberga, Paramaribo, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association football career==

===Club career===

====MVV====
Kamperveen joined the [[military]] club [[Sportvereniging Nationaal Leger|MVV]] during his service, competing in the [[SVB Hoofdklasse|Hoofdklasse]], the top flight of football in Suriname. He was a crowd favorite, scoring many goals and helping MVV to win a national championship in 1948.&lt;ref name = "kamperveen"/&gt;

====Paysandu SC====
In 1950, he joined [[Paysandu Sport Club]] from [[Belém]], [[Brazil]] where he signed on a 1-year contract. He became the first professional football player from Suriname, joining a club that was used to winning, this proved to be a big change for Kamperveen, where he learned [[Brazilian Portuguese]] in order to communicate with his teammates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thehomeofcaribbeanfootball.com/2015/05/06/heroes-andre-kamperveen-surinames-man-of-the-people/|title=André Kamperveen: Suriname's Man of the people |publisher=Home of Caribbean Football, The}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1952 a Caribbean All-Stars team came to Suriname to play exhibition matches at the [[Andre Kamperveen Stadion|Cultuurtuinlaan]]. Kamperveen was called up to play for the Caribbean All-Star team together with Michel Kruin and [[Humphrey Mijnals]] from Suriname. He scored two goals in the opening match for the Caribbean All-Stars against the [[Suriname national football team|Suriname national team]] in a 2–2 draw. Two more matches were played against the national team, which ended in a draw and a loss for the All-Stars, while two additional matches played were lost to [[S.V. Robinhood]] and [[S.V. Voorwaarts]]. It is worth mentioning that Kamperveen had already played for the Suriname national team prior to being called up for the Caribbean regional team.&lt;ref name = "voetbal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/stut004eers01_01/stut004eers01_01_0254.php|title=Voetbal; De eerste Surinaamse sportencyclopedie (1893-1988) |publisher=Alberga, Paramaribo, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, Kamperveen graduated with an A-level diploma from the [[KNVB]], the highest level diploma issued by the Dutch governing body of football. At the end of the season he returned to Suriname.&lt;ref name = "kamperveen"/&gt;

===International career===

He made his debut in 1945 at the age of 21.&lt;ref name = "kamperveen"/&gt; Playing as a [[Forward (association football)|center forward]], he earned the captain armband in his first year with the team.&lt;ref name = "kamperveen"/&gt; In 1946 the national team travelled to [[Willemstad]], [[Curaçao]] to participate in a tournament with [[Territory of Curaçao national football team|Curaçao]], [[Aruba national football team|Aruba]] and [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] and Dutch club [[Feyenoord]].

==Basketball career==
Kamperveen played many sports apart from football. [[Basketball]] was one of his favorites, having joined the basketball team of the [[Military of Suriname|Surinamese military]] after enlisting.&lt;ref name = "basketbal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/stut004eers01_01/stut004eers01_01_0019.php|title=Basketbal; De eerste Surinaamse sportencyclopedie (1893-1988) |publisher=Alberga, Paramaribo, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basketball had arrived in Suriname in 1941 when the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] arrived on [[Timeline of United States military operations#1940.E2.80.931944|November 24th]].&lt;ref name = "basketbal"/&gt; Games were organized between teams of the battalions of both militaries and local community teams.&lt;ref name = "basketbal"/&gt; The local basketball teams 'Surinam' and 'Chung Fa Foei Kon', a Chinese basketball club from Suriname and one of the strongest in the sports national history, were among the first teams to register in the country. Kamperveen played [[Point Guard (basketball)|point guard]] for the basketball team of the [[Sportvereniging Nationaal Leger|Nationaal Leger]].&lt;ref name = "basketbal"/&gt;

The Surinamese Basketball Association was founded in 1947 with Kamperveen competing in the first official season. Kamperveen also played for the [[Suriname national basketball team]] at the same time that he was playing for the national football team.&lt;ref name = "basketbal"/&gt;

November 29, 1957 was the first time the national basketball team played inside an arena. The game was between the national teams of [[Suriname]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. Kamperveen officiated the game which ended in a 81-78 loss to Trinidad and Tobago for Suriname.&lt;ref name = "basketbal"/&gt;

Kamperveen became the first [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in the history of [[judo]] in Suriname. While studying in the Netherlands at [[:nl:CIOS|CIOS]], Kamperveen took up judo graduating to [[Dan (rank)|2nd dan]] in 1957.&lt;ref name = "judo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/stut004eers01_01/stut004eers01_01_0114.php|title=Judo; De eerste Surinaamse sportencyclopedie (1893-1988) |publisher=Alberga, Paramaribo, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 May 1957 Kamperveen opened the first [[dojo]] in [[Paramaribo]], known as '''Kodokan''' on the Mgr. Wulfingstraat.&lt;ref name = "judo"/&gt; Named after the original [[Kodokan]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], the Kodokan dojo is of great importance to the development of the practice in Suriname, organizing the first tournaments, it is the dojo where judoka Eddy Murray was given his first belts. Murray would go on to play a much bigger role in the Sport.&lt;ref name = "judo"/&gt;

In 1964, Kamperveen made an attempt at founding the first national judo/jiu-jitsu association in Suriname. Although the attempt failed it did serve to further promote judo in the outlying districts of Suriname. That year he graduated judoka in [[Nieuw Nickerie]] during half time of a football match as manager of [[S.V. Transvaal]]. In 1968, he founded the Surinamese Judo Association, becoming the first chairman of the organization.&lt;ref name = "kamperveen"/&gt;

==Broadcasting and Journalism==
On 15 December 1950 the first edition of 'Sport Ontspannings Kroniek' (also known as SOK) was published as a weekly sports newspaper. Although not the first sports paper in Suriname, the previous publication folded after only two years in existence. Kamperveen and Jules Defares were the directors of the new paper. Initially a weekly, it was eventually published twice a week, becoming a weekly once more by 1955.&lt;ref name = "sportjournalistiek"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/stut004eers01_01/stut004eers01_01_0222.php|title= Sportjournalistiek; De eerste Surinaamse sportencyclopedie (1893-1988) |publisher=Alberga, Paramaribo, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kamperveen contributed a great deal to sports journalism in Suriname. He was heavily involved in some of the earliest live radio broadcasting of football matches as well, working with Surinamese radio stations Rapar, Apintie and SRS.&lt;ref name = "sportjournalistiek"/&gt; He founded the VSJS (''Vereniging van Sportjournalisten in Suriname'' (English, Association of Sports journalists in Suriname), becoming the first chairman of the organization in 1963.&lt;ref name = "kamperveen"/&gt;

On 20 October 1966 the first Surinamese television station went on air, the Surinaamse Televisie Stichting (STVS), and two years later, Kamperveen produced the first weekly sports show in Suriname for the station called 'Sportrevue'.&lt;ref name = "sportjournalistiek"/&gt;

===Radio ABC===
{{main|Ampie's Broadcasting Corporation}}
On 6 December 1975 Kamperveen's dream, to one day own his own radio station, finally came true. [[Ampie's Broadcasting Corporation|Ampies Broadcasting Corporation Suriname]], commonly known as '''ABC, the lovestation''' was born. After years of working for Apintie, Kamperveen finally owned his own station. Both his Sons, Johnny and Henk Kamperveen joined him to work at the station, Johnny as a host, and Henk as a director. Radio ABC is a popular station in Suriname, blending news, activities, sports, humor and a lot of music.&lt;ref name = "sportjournalistiek"/&gt;

In 1957 he graduated with an A-level diploma from the Royal Dutch Football Association ([[KNVB]]), having completed studies at the [[:nl:CIOS|CIOS]] and attending the Sportshochschule in West Germany. After becoming a board member of the Surinamese Football Association, he held various positions within the board of the [[CONCACAF]], the continental governing body for association football in North America, Central America and the Caribbean.

That year Kamperveen as vice-president of FIFA appeared along the center circle at the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium]] in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]] as king [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]] kicked off the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] opening ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.starnieuws.com/index.php/welcome/index/nieuwsitem/3707 |title=Bally Lochem: belastingman, scheidsrechter en mati van Ampie |publisher=Star Nieuws|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kamperveen would also witness the beginning of Surinamese compatriots [[Frank Rijkaard]] and [[Ruud Gullit]]'s International career with the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in the buildup to the tournament before losing his life in the [[december murders]]. He would not survive to witness the rise and influence of Surinamese footballers in Dutch football throughout the eighties and nineties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/article/detail/2543567/1997/06/09/Herinneringen-aan-Ampie-Kamperveen.dhtml |title=Herinneringen aan Ampie Kamperveen |publisher=Trouw|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976 his Sons joined him at Radio ABC, Johnny became a popular radio host, while Henk became a director of the station. He was married to Lea van Leuvenum, his second wife. They were married in 1980 in [[New York City]] following his divorce from his previous marriage, they had no children together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://schrijfsterushamarhe.wordpress.com/2011/12/08/lea-kamperveen-over-de-moord-op-haar-man-ampie/|title=Lea Kamperveen over de moord op haar man ‘Ampie’ |publisher=De Volkskrant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activities==
Following the [[1980 Surinamese coup d'état]], Kamperveen was appointed Minister of Culture, Youth and Sports under Minister-president [[Henk Chin A Sen]]. Due to disagreements over the political direction of the National Military Council (NMR), he denounced his position and became vocal about his opposition through writing and on live radio on his own ABC station. Kamperveen believed the country should head in a more democratic direction, while [[Dési Bouterse]] wanted a [[military dictatorship]].

==Death==
{{main|December murders}}
On December 7, 1982 at 2:00 am, he and his wife were interrupted from their sleep by soldiers of [[Dési Bouterse]], the then dictator of Suriname. His guard dogs were shot and Kamperveen was taken away to [[Fort Zeelandia (Paramaribo)|Fort Zeelandia]], where he and 14 other men who had voiced opposition to the military regime were heard as "suspects in a trial" by Bouterse and other sergeants in a self-appointed court. After these "hearings" they were tortured and shot dead. The circumstances have not yet become completely clear; on December 10, 1982, Bouterse claimed on national television that all of the detainees had been shot dead "in an attempt to flee". That day his Wife went to the hospital to identify the body. He had sustained injuries to the jaw and a swollen face, 18 bullet wounds in the chest, a shot wound in the right temple, a fractured femur and a fractured arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starnieuws.com/index.php/welcome/index/nieuwsitem/9910|language=Dutch|title=Bouterse heeft Daal en Rambocus doodgeschoten|date=23 March 2012|accessdate=23 March 2012|work=Starnieuws}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His son Johnny had initially been reported as one of the victims of the murders. He was however able to escape abduction. and the family members fled to the Netherlands. The ABC Radio building had been torched to the ground and completely destroyed on the night of the abduction as well. Kamperveen's funeral was on 13 December 1982, buried at the Annette's Hof cemetery in Paramaribo, his funeral attracted thousands of people and was led by vicar Rudi Polanen of the Moravian Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterkant.net/special/8december2.html |language=Dutch|title=Eye witness account of survivor Freddy Derby, 18 years later|accessdate=6 March 2016|work=Waterkant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posthumous==

The Kamperveen family have long been involved with the prosecution of Bouterse, working with human rights organization and consulting with the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] in 1983 along with other victim families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/0a4d10d5f037b88ac1256b1700498130?Opendocument Appendix with Communication No. 148/1983 : Suriname. 04/04/85] of the UN Human Rights Committee, April 4, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Henk Kamperveen was also involved in the December murders trial that commenced on November 30, 2007. To this date the case has gone unresolved and Dési Bouterse has long denied guilt and only accepted political responsibility for the murders as of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.groene.nl/artikel/de-heer-bouterse-lust-ik-rauw|title= Pijnlijke geschiedenis De decembermoorden in Suriname 'De heer Bouterse lust ik rauw' |publisher=De Groene Amsterdamer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Johnny and Henk returned to Paramaribo to rebuild the ABC Radio station, and after 11 years of absence, the love station was back on air in Suriname. In 2003, Johnny died from a viral infection at his home after years as a host on his fathers station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abcsuriname.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=84&amp;Itemid=63|title= ABC Suriname - About Us |publisher=ABC Suriname}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Anti-siphoning law}}

'''Anti-siphoning laws''' in [[Australia]] regulate the media companies' access to significant sporting events. In 1992, when the country experienced growth in paid-subscription media, the [[Parliament of Australia]] enacted the [[Broadcasting Services Act 1992]] that gave free-to-air broadcasters essentially first refusal to certain sporting event broadcasting rights. The '''anti-siphoning list''' is a list of events, the televising of which should, in the opinion of the relevant Minister, be available free to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Section 115 of the ''Broadcasting Services Act 1992''.&lt;/ref&gt; To effect this 'freedom', the ''Broadcasting Services Act 1992'' includes a licence condition on pay TV providers that prohibits them from acquiring anti-siphoning  events unless a national broadcaster or a network of commercial television broadcasters have the right to televise the events.&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 10(1)(e) of Schedule 2 to the ''Broadcasting Services Act 1992''&lt;/ref&gt; This prohibition drops away a certain period before the event starts. The current anti-siphoning rules also prohibit national television broadcasters and commercial television  broadcasters from premiering listed events on digital multi-channels. Listed events may be shown on digital multi-channels if they have already been broadcast, or are simultaneously broadcast on the broadcaster's main channel.

{{update section|date=March 2011}}
The anti-siphoning list came into effect in 2006. The relevant Minister has the power to add, amend or remove events from the list.&lt;ref&gt;These decisions must be notified in the Gazette and laid before each House of Parliament. The decision will come into effect if no motion of disallowance has been moved within 15 sitting days in either House.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, only sporting events are listed, even though the ''Broadcasting Services Act 1992'' does not limit the types of events that can be listed. There are currently ten sport types (e.g. tennis, soccer, rugby league) on the anti-siphoning list plus the Olympic and Commonwealth Games. Events on the anti-siphoning list are delisted 12 weeks before they start to ensure pay TV broadcasters have reasonable access to listed events, if free-to-air broadcasters decide not to purchase the broadcast rights for a particular event. Any rights to listed sporting events that are not acquired by free-to-air broadcasters are available to pay TV. Before the end of 2009, the Federal Government conducted a review of the anti-siphoning scheme, with the Minister proposing changes to the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minister.dbcde.gov.au/media/media_releases/2010/103|title=Reforms to the Anti-siphoning Scheme Announced|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514170355/http://www.minister.dbcde.gov.au/media/media_releases/2010/103|archivedate=14 May 2013|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These changes can not come into effect until amending legislation is passed through the Australian Parliament.
After the broadcasting deals were announced with [[Cricket Australia]], [[Seven Network]] and [[Fox Cricket]], Men’s ODIs and T20s will be live and exclusively broadcast on [[Foxtel]].

'''Arthur Elvin Davies''' (7 May 1867 – 27 March 1918) was an Australian businessman and politician who was a member of the [[Western Australian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] of [[Western Australia]] from 1906 to 1911, representing the [[Electoral district of South Fremantle|seat of South Fremantle]].

Davies was born in [[Fremantle]] to Hannah Elizabeth (née Williams) and Alfred Alexander Davies. Two of his older brothers, [[George Alfred Davies|George Alfred]] and [[Edward William Davies]], served as [[List of mayors of Fremantle|Mayor of Fremantle]]. Before entering politics himself, Davies was a [[cabinet maker]] and [[upholsterer]] who eventually set up as a furniture importer. In November 1889, he also established an [[Undertaker|undertaking]] firm. Davies was elected to the Fremantle Road Board (now the [[City of Cockburn]]) in 1894, and would serve as mayor from 1905 to 1911.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/parliament/library/MPHistoricalData.nsf/(Lookup)/1E7DE2664800F265482577E50028A5A5?OpenDocument Arthur Elvin Davies] – Biographical Register of Members of the Parliament of Western Australia.

==United States service==
Bloomberg's U.S. broadcasts are headed by Justin Smith, the CEO of Bloomberg Media Group. Smith replaced Andy Lack,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= Hume, Tim |title= Andrew Morse named head of Bloomberg TV |url= http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/andrew-morse-named-head-of-bloomberg-tv_b71753 |work= [[TV Newser]] |date= June 16, 2011 |accessdate= January 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who would eventually return to [[NBC News]]. The network also provided funding and studio facilities for the nightly [[PBS]]/[[WNET]] program ''[[Charlie Rose (talk show)|Charlie Rose]]''.

===History===
Bloomberg Television first launched in the United States on January 1, 1994 under the name '''Bloomberg Information TV''', before it was shortened to its current name in 1998. Shortly after Bloomberg's launch, the now-defunct [[American Independent Network]] carried a simulcast of the channel at various times each weekday from 1995 to 1997, which was picked up by some broadcast stations in early morning periods to provide a ''de facto'' morning business show. The network's morning pre-opening bell programming was also aired on the [[USA Network]], [[simulcast]]ed in a [[paid programming]] arrangement with the channel until 2004, when that network dropped the simulcast months before the [[NBCUniversal|NBC Universal]] merger was consummated, due to concerns that USA would then air the coverage of a competitor to future sister network [[CNBC]]. The simulcast then moved to [[E!]] (which became [[NBCUniversal]]-owned in January 2011 due to that company's purchase by [[Comcast]]), where it remained until the simulcast ended in January 2009, when the network had expanded its reach on [[digital cable]] systems enough to discontinue the simulcast. During its time on E!, the 5–8 a.m. block was the most watched period for the network, according to [[Nielsen Media Research]].

Bloomberg Television's U.S. network debuted a new graphics package in January 2009. This current scheme was first used on the network's now-defunct pre-market program, ''Starting Bell'', before the new graphics expanded to all of the network's programs on February 17, 2009. Also on that date, Bloomberg U.S. revamped its weekday programming lineup (see "Programs on Bloomberg" below).

In October 2009, Bloomberg Television debuted another new graphics package.{{Clarify|date=September 2011}} In 2011, Bloomberg Television announced a strategic relationship with Gas Station TV (GSTV) to deliver personal finance and business news to more than 27 million viewers each month at GSTV pumps.

Bloomberg launched a [[High-definition television|high definition]] simulcast feed on May 9, 2011, with [[Time Warner Cable]] as the first provider to carry it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/467990-HD_Launch_On_Time_Warner_Cable_Puts_Bloomberg_Television_In_Focus.php |title=HD Launch on Time Warner Cable Puts Bloomberg Television in Focus &amp;#124; Cable Television News &amp;#124; Broadcast Syndication &amp;#124; Programming |publisher=Multichannel.com |date=May 9, 2011 |accessdate=2012-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-April 2013, [[DIRECTV]] started carrying Bloomberg HD.

As of July 2014, Bloomberg Television's standard-definition feed now shows a down-scaled version of its native HD feed, with the 16:9 letterbox picture on its 4:3 SD feed.

==International channels==
In February 2009, Bloomberg Television announced that it would cease operating some of the international variations of the channel, placing a greater focus on a more international Bloomberg channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mark Sweney and Stephen Brook |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/feb/04/bloomberg-cuts-tv-service-redundancies |title=Bloomberg cuts back TV service as it axes 100 jobs &amp;#124; Media &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= February 4, 2009|accessdate=2012-11-24 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 9, 2009, the localized channels available in Germany, France, Italy and Spain ceased operations. Today, throughout Europe, the original pan-European version of Bloomberg Europe (International) is available on cable and digital television providers.

Since March 9, 2009, Bloomberg Television utilizes its existing international production teams in Hong Kong (Bloomberg Asia), Europe (Bloomberg Europe) and America (Bloomberg), adding a more global feel to the channel. Bloomberg International provides programming from Hong Kong in the early morning, produced by Bloomberg Asia (International), from London in the late morning, produced by Bloomberg Europe (International), and from its main headquarters in New York City in the afternoon. Each Bloomberg receives localized advertising and a relevant business news ticker on screen.

Bloomberg Japan ceased broadcasting on April 30, 2009. The channel was then replaced by '''Bloomberg Asia (International)'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.bloomberg.co.jp/media/btv.html | archivedate= January 4, 2007| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104170043/http://www.bloomberg.co.jp/media/btv.html| title= Bloomberg.co.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomberg Japan's Japanese language print newsroom and website continue to operate as normal. In June 2009, the Japanese service began running small on-air segments in cooperation with BS-Fuji Television. In October 2009, segments produced with the [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] were added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bloomberg.co.jp/media/index.html |title=ブルームバーグ・メディア &amp;#124; 金融メディア一覧 |publisher=Bloomberg |date= |accessdate=2012-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127184027/http://www.bloomberg.co.jp/media/index.html |archivedate=November 27, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomberg Brazil and Bloomberg Latin America were integrated into the global Bloomberg channel during 2009.

In November 2011, Bloomberg announced the formation of "Bloomberg TV Mongolia" in partnership with [[Trade and Development Bank of Mongolia]] (TDB), the oldest and one of the largest commercial banks in Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-01/bloomberg-announces-formation-of-bloomberg-tv-mongolia.html | work=Bloomberg | title=Bloomberg Announces Formation of Bloomberg TV Mongolia | date=November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The channel offers a mix of locally produced, [[Mongolian language]] content as well as English language news from Bloomberg Television.

In February 2015, Bloomberg partnered with Canadian media company [[Channel Zero (company)|Channel Zero]] to form [[Bloomberg TV Canada]], which featured U.S. Bloomberg Television programming and Canadian-produced studio programs produced from Bloomberg's [[Brookfield Place (Toronto)|Brookfield Place]] studio and other Canadian bureaus. The channel replaced the U.S. service on Canadian television providers.&lt;ref name=fp-bloombergcanada&gt;{{cite web|title=Bloomberg Television set to launch Canadian channel this spring|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2015/02/25/bloomberg-television-set-to-launch-canadian-channel-this-spring/|website=Financial Post|accessdate=February 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gandm-bloombergcanada&gt;{{cite news|title=Bloomberg to launch Canadian business TV channel|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/bloomberg-to-launch-canadian-business-tv-channel/article23207065/|accessdate=February 26, 2015|work=The Globe and Mail|location=Toronto|date=February 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The channel shut down in October 2017, after which Bloomberg entered into a partnership with [[Bell Media]]'s [[Business News Network]] (BNN), to co-brand the channel as BNN Bloomberg, and grant the company rights to distribute its television and radio content in Canada.

==Controversy==
[[File:Bloomberg in London.jpg|thumb|right|Bloomberg Europe studio]]
In the [[United Kingdom]], Bloomberg Television was severely reprimanded for breach of [[Ofcom]] rules during the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 UK national (General) election]]. Bloomberg was found to have shown pro-[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/ocsc_adjud/bloomberg.pdf#search=%22bloomberg%20ofcom%22 |title=Ofcom Content Sanctions Committee |publisher=Ofcom.org |accessdate=2012-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred due to a breach of British law. In the run up to a general election, television channels must provide equal time to all major political parties. Bloomberg covered the release by the Labour Party of their so-called "Business Manifesto", but did not provide counterbalancing air time to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] or [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].

==Datascreen and news ticker==
Bloomberg was well known for using a datascreen format that occupied most of the television screen and the camera shots. Until 1998, Bloomberg did not have a moving ticker. Instead, it had boxes that were dedicated to world news, as well as weather conditions in selected cities, in addition to market data which was confined to the bottom of the screen. This changed gradually to focus more on business news. The data screen was reformatted several times to include a moving stock ticker and accommodate new graphics.

The datascreen format was phased out in late 2007, where the programs were seen almost in full-screen with the ticker and headlines bar confined to the lower part of the screen.  However, Bloomberg HD (available in the US only) features more data boxes on the right side of the screen compared to its SD counterpart. This effectively makes on-screen presentation on Bloomberg HD resemble the pre-2007 datascreen.

On Monday September 22, 2014 Bloomberg Television dropped the long-standing live stock ticker as part of the new on screen information format. No reason for this was given.

==Other platforms==
The widespread growth of mobile devices and [[social media]] have influenced sites such as Bloomberg to expand its news platforms into other areas. Bloomberg Television offers some off-air news updates via social media including [[Facebook]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Facebook|BloombergTelevision}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Google+]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Google+|101169269861152216375|name=Bloomberg News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Google+|105390560628055373663|name=Bloomberg TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Twitter|BloombergTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebroadcasts of news and other special programs are additionally aired on the station's official [[YouTube]] channel "Bloomberg Television".&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|user = Bloomberg Television|Bloomberg Television}}&lt;/ref&gt; On mobile devices, Bloomberg Television released an app available for the [[iPad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ITunes Preview App|460459302|bloomberg-tv+}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apple TV]], and other streaming services including [[Pluto TV]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10184">In computer [[software]], '''business logic''' or '''domain logic''' is the part of the program that encodes the real-world [[business rule]]s that determine how data can be [[Create, read, update and delete|created, stored, and changed]].  It is contrasted with the remainder of the software that might be concerned with lower-level details of managing a [[database]] or displaying the [[user interface]], system infrastructure, or generally connecting various parts of the program.

==Details and example==
Business logic:
* Prescribes how [[business objects]] interact with one another
* Enforces the routes and the methods by which business objects are accessed and updated

Business rules:
* Model [[Real life|real-life]] business objects (such as accounts, loans, itineraries, and inventories)

Business logic comprises:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebizq.net/topics/bpm/features/5757.html?&amp;pp=1|title=The Challenge of BPM Adoption|date=2005-03-27|author=Steven Minsky|publisher=eBizQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Workflow]]s that are the ordered tasks of passing documents or data from one participant (a person or a software system) to another.

Business logic should be distinguished from business rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?BusinessLogicDefinition|title=Definition of business logic|date=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business logic is the portion of an enterprise system which determines how data is transformed or calculated, and how it is routed to people or software (workflow). Business rules are formal expressions of business policy. Anything that is a process or procedure is business logic, and anything that is neither a process nor a procedure is a business rule. Welcoming a new visitor is a process (workflow) consisting of steps to be taken, whereas saying every new visitor must be welcomed is a business rule. Further, business logic is procedural whereas business rules are declarative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omg.org/news/meetings/tc/mn/special-events/br/Ulrich.pdf|author=William Ulrich|title=OMG Business Rules Symposium|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224094752/http://www.omg.org/news/meetings/tc/mn/special-events/br/Ulrich.pdf|archivedate=2013-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, an [[e-commerce]] website might allow visitors to add items to a shopping cart, specify a shipping address, and supply payment information.  The business logic of the website might include a workflow such as:
* The sequence of events that happens during checkout, for example a multi-page form which first asks for the shipping address, then for the billing address, next page will contain the payment method, and last page will show congratulations.

There will be also business rules of the website:
* Adding an item more than once from the item description page increments the quantity for that item.
* Specific formats that the visitor's address, email address, and credit card information must follow.
* A specific communication protocol for talking to the credit card network

The web site software also contains other code which is not considered part of business logic nor business rules:
* Peripheral content not related to the core business data, such as the [[HTML]] that defines the colors, appearance, background image, and navigational structure of the site
* Generic error-handling code (e.g. which displays the HTTP Error Code 500 page)
* Initialization code that runs when the web server starts up the site, which sets up the system
* Monitoring infrastructure to make sure all the parts of the site are working properly (e.g. the billing system is available)
* Generic code for making network connections, transmitting objects to the [[database]], parsing user input via HTTP POST events, etc.

==Business logic and tiers/layers==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2018}}
[[Image:Overview of a three-tier application vectorVersion.svg|thumb|right|Business logic in theory occupies the middle tier of a 3-tier architecture.]]

Business logic could be anywhere in a program.  For example, given a certain format for an address, a database table could be created which has columns that correspond exactly to the fields specified in the business logic, and type checks added to make sure that no invalid data is added.

Business logic often changes.  For example, the set of allowable address formats might change when an online retailer starts shipping products to a new country.  Thus it is often seen as desirable to make the code that implements the business logic relatively isolated, or [[coupling (computer science)|loosely coupled]].  This makes it more likely that changes to business logic will require a small set of code changes, in only one part of the code.  Distant but strongly coupled code also creates more of a risk that the programmer will only make some of the necessary changes and miss part of the system, leading to incorrect operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.awprofessional.com/articles/article.aspx?p=24260&amp;seqNum=3|chapter=Introduction to Enterprise Software|author1=Khawar Zaman Ahmed  |author2=Cary E. Umrysh |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Addison-Wesley|date=2001-10-17|isbn=0-201-73829-5|title=Developing Enterprise Java Applications with J2EE and UML}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[multitier architecture]] formalizes this decoupling by creating a '''business logic layer''' which is separate from other tiers or layers, such as the [[data access layer]] or [[service layer]].  Each layer "knows" only a minimal amount about the code in the other layers - just enough to accomplish necessary tasks. For example, in a [[model–view–controller]] paradigm, the controller and view layers, might be made as small as possible, with all the business logic concentrated in the model.  In the e-commerce example, the controller determines the sequence of web pages in the checkout sequence, and is also responsible for validating that email, address, and payment information satisfy the business rules (rather than leaving any of that up to the database itself or lower-level database access code).

Alternative paradigms are possible.  For example, with relatively simple business entities, a generic view and controller could access database objects which themselves contain all the relevant business logic about what formats they accept and what changes are possible (known as the [[database model]]).

Some tiered schemes use either a distinct [[application layer]] or a [[service layer]], or consider the business logic layer to be the same as one of those.

==Tools and techniques==
Business logic can be extracted from procedural code using a [[business rule management system]] (BRMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bring business logic to light: JRules 4.5 tames business rules with friendly tools|author=James Owen|publisher=JavaWorld|date=2003-09-19|url=http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-09-2003/jw-0919-iw-jrules.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[business rules approach]] of software development uses BRMSs and enforces a very strong separation of business logic from other code.  [[User interface management systems]] are another technology used to enforce a strong separation between business logic and other code.  The [[magic pushbutton]] is considered an "anti-pattern": a technique that in this case creates undesirable constraints which make it difficult to code business logic in an easy-to-maintain way.

A [[domain model]] is an abstract representation of the data storage types required by business rules.

'''''Chocolatier''''' is a [[casual game|casual]] [[strategy video game]] with [[action game]] elements, developed by American studio Big Splash Games and published by [[PlayFirst]]. The game was released as a download on May 1, 2007 and was followed by [[CD-ROM]] release on September 27, 2007. Players assume the role of a young [[Chocolatier]], who must navigate 14 cities around the globe while buying ingredients, manufacturing chocolates, and selling them to chocolate shops. Two modes of play are available: in story mode the player must rebuild an almost bankrupt chocolate empire and acquire 64 chocolate recipes from around the world; in free mode players start out with scant resources and must become successful chocolatiers.

''Chocolatier'' was the first game developed by Big Splash Games, a trio of video game designers, who remained employees whilst developing a prototype game in their spare time. This prototype was rejected by publishers, but after coming up with the premise of ''Chocolatier'' the team was signed-up by PlayFirst and completed the title. The game received a mostly positive reception: reviewers enjoyed the [[Action game|action]] [[mini-game]] which is played when chocolates are manufactured, and the game's graphics, sound, and Victorian-era presentation.

== Gameplay ==
The player assumes the role of a young chocolatier in 1880, during the [[Victorian era]]. The game has two modes of play: story and free play. Story mode involves a number of quests, including delivering specific chocolates and restoring the fictional Baumeister chocolate empire to its former glory.&lt;ref name="gamezone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r32809.htm |title=Reviews: Chocolatier |author=Hollingshead, Anise |publisher=GameZone |date=9 September 2007 |accessdate=2 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615193757/http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r32809.htm |archivedate=15 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The player is enlisted by Evangeline Baumeister to rebuild the Baumeister chocolate empire which has been ruined by Evangeline's younger sister who scattered chocolate recipes around the world.&lt;ref name="macworld"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.macworld.com/article/60769/2007/10/chocolatier.html|title = Challenging business tycoon game adds sweet arcade-style element|author = Cohen, Peter|publisher = [[Macworld]]|date = 29 October 2007|accessdate = 1 August 2008|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080620084150/http://www.macworld.com/article/60769/2007/10/chocolatier.html|archivedate = 20 June 2008|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The player must locate the 64 lost recipes, visit 14 different cities around the globe, purchase 6 closed Baumeister factories, establish business relationships with outlets and suppliers, and manufacture chocolates to keep in business.&lt;ref name="macworld" /&gt; Free play mode allows the player to travel, manufacture, and trade without undertaking quests.&lt;ref name="gamezebo"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gamezebo.com/games/chocolatier/review|title = Chocolatier: Full Review|author = Saltzman, Marc|publisher = [[Gamezebo]]|date = 12 May 2008|accessdate = 2 August 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161121042115/http://www.gamezebo.com/2007/05/01/chocolatier-review/|archivedate = November 21, 2016|deadurl = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This mode starts the player with a small amount of cash and all chocolate recipes unlocked for use.&lt;ref name="preview"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gamezebo.com/games/chocolatier/preview|title = Chocolatier preview|author = [[Erin Bell (journalist)|Bell, Erin]]|publisher = [[Gamezebo]]|date = 12 May 2007|accessdate = 2 August 2008|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080629121057/http://www.gamezebo.com/games/chocolatier/preview|archivedate = 29 June 2008|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In story mode, players begin with a single factory and a recipe for simple chocolate bars, the player must visit the market to purchase ingredients and begin the manufacturing process.&lt;ref name="gamezone" /&gt;

[[File:Chocolatier gameplay manufacturing.jpg|thumb|left|The chocolate manufacturing process is an action minigame and a departure from the main game's economic simulation gameplay.]]
The cities have a chocolate shop, where the player can sell his or her stock, and a market where ingredients can be purchased. Factories manufacturing chocolates produce a set amount of product every turn, as long as the required ingredients are in stock.&lt;ref name="preview" /&gt; During story mode, quests are given by [[non-player characters]]; these typically involve producing a particular volume and type of chocolate and delivering it to another non-player character, who is either traveling or can be found at a set location. Quest rewards take the form of a high price for the chocolates or a new recipe.&lt;ref name="gamezone" /&gt; Some encounters with characters give the player an opportunity to gamble a large amount of money on a dice roll.&lt;ref name="grrl" /&gt; Market owners can be bartered with, though this carries the risk of them becoming irritated and raising prices rather than lowering them.&lt;ref name="preview" /&gt;

When producing a particular chocolate for the first time, a [[minigame]] is played where ingredients are fired from a cannon to fill circular trays which revolve around the cannon.&lt;ref name="grrl" /&gt; The ingredients and quantities needed vary, depending on the recipe.&lt;ref name="grrl" /&gt; Each time a circle is filled with the correct ingredients, it is removed and an empty circle put in its place.&lt;ref name="grrl" /&gt; The trays spin faster as more circles are filled. If too many ingredients are wasted by misfiring the cannon, production is brought to a halt and the mini-game must be attempted again.&lt;ref name="preview" /&gt; The mini-game ends when the timer runs out; the number of completed circles is equal to the number of chocolates produced by that factory every week.&lt;ref name="grrl"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.grrlgamer.com/review.php?g=chocolatier|title = game reviews: Chocolatier|author = Cardoso, Didi|publisher = Grrlgamer|date = |accessdate = 2 August 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080621215211/http://www.grrlgamer.com/review.php?g=chocolatier|archivedate = 21 June 2008|deadurl = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mini-game cannot be played unless the player owns the correct ingredients, and it can be replayed if the player wishes to try to improve the efficiency of the factory.&lt;ref name="houston"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/tech/athome/4803889.html|title = Chocolate, jewels: Games tap into a few favorite things|author = Reeks, Anne|publisher = [[Houston Chronicle]]|date = 15 May 2007|accessdate = 3 August 2008|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080329071811/http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/tech/athome/4803889.html|archivedate = 29 March 2008|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
[[Tucson, Arizona]] based Big Splash Games was formed in late 2005 by three veterans of the videogame industry: Jon Blossom, Stephen Lewis and Michael Wyman.&lt;ref name="sassy"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://prettysassy.com/blog/?p=50|title = Interview With Jon Blossom of Big Splash Games|author = Kelly|publisher = Pretty Sassy|date = 31 January 2008|accessdate = 7 August 2008|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110715112523/http://prettysassy.com/blog/?p=50|archivedate = 15 July 2011|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="az"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.azcentral.com/members/Blog/Blog4Play/19543|title = 4Play 4Questions: Michael Thornton Wyman, Big Splash Games|author = Eilders, Ryan|publisher = [[AZCentral]]|date = 18 March 2008|accessdate = 2 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They came together to produce a prototype video game for the casual market. They worked on this for a few months when they were not working (they still held jobs within the industry to support themselves). This prototype was pitched to a few publishers in order to gain feedback. PlayFirst, though not interested in the prototype, issued the team a [[request for proposal]] for an economic simulation game, hoping that Big Splash could produce another proposal. The next morning, Big Splash co-founder Stephen Lewis remembered that he had been told that some people, in particular women, "have an almost religious connection with chocolate". Taking this idea he quickly wrote a proposal and forwarded it to his two partners. After [[brainstorming]] the idea the team decided that it satisfied PlayFirst's request for proposal, forwarded a copy of the idea and received word from the publisher that they "had hit the nail on the head".&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamer-girl.org/features/intlewis.html |title=An interview with Stephen Lewis, Game Designer |author=Short, Tanya |publisher=Gamer-Girl |date=1 February 2008 |accessdate=3 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211073214/http://www.gamer-girl.org/features/intlewis.html |archivedate=11 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chocolatier'' was designed to appeal to women aged between 35 and 55, a different market compared to the games previously developed by the trio.&lt;ref name="az" /&gt; In order to immerse themselves in the subject matter during development, Big Splash's staff tasted as many variety of chocolates as they could find and took the [[Scharffen Berger Chocolate Maker]] factory tour, where they witnessed the full "bean to bar" process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gamezebo.com/features/interviews/countdown-zeebys-chocolatier|title = Countdown to the Zeebys: Chocolatier|author = [[Erin Bell (journalist)|Bell, Erin]]|publisher = [[Gamezebo]]|date = 21 June 2008|accessdate = 1 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The factory mini-game was developed in order to give players a break from the economic side of the game, which involves buying low and selling high. It took approximately the same time to produce the mini-game as it did to create the rest of the game, which drained the developer's resources, though Stephen Lewis believed this was "the right decision".&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt; Journalists were sent ''Chocolatier''-branded chocolate bars and "golden tickets" which allowed them to download the game for free, in order to promote the game's release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2007/04/playfirsts_chocolatier_woos_us.php|title = Playfirst's Chocolatier Woos Us With Chocs|author = Carless, Simon|publisher = Game Set Watch|date = 30 April 2007|accessdate = 2 August 2008|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080421111705/http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2007/04/playfirsts_chocolatier_woos_us.php|archivedate = 21 April 2008|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's sequel, ''Chocolatier 2: Secret Ingredients'' was first released on November 27, 2007.

'''''Critical Chain''''' is a novel by Dr. [[Eliyahu Goldratt]] using the [[Critical Chain]] theory of [[Project Management]] as the major theme. It is really a teaching method for the theory.

==Plot introduction==
Like [[Eliyahu Goldratt|Goldratt’s]] book ''[[The Goal]]'', ''Critical Chain'' is written as a novel, not like a [[project manager]]'s how-to guide. This book is a story about a professor trying to attain his tenure at a university's business school. The plot is used to maintain interest in the subject and provide a real life feel to the book. It provides plenty of real-world examples. 
The plot of the novel is fourfold:
# A professor trying to become tenured,
# A business school's struggle to improve enrollment,
# Teaching philosophy,
# Applying the [[Theory of Constraints]] to [[project management]]
The goal of the book is the last point, but Goldratt makes it clear that educational systems must change to better accommodate the quickly changing world of business.

The book walks the reader through a series of steps to establish the principles for the discussion. It is written for someone with a modicum of project management background.

The book starts by pointing out the problems with how time estimates are normally done on projects. It then provides a primer on the Theory of Constraints and an example of its implementation in a steel mill. With the foundation set, it proceeds to show how the Theory of Constraints can be applied to schedule generation, resources constraints and multiple [[projects]].

== Plot summary ==

===Scheduling Estimates===
Goldratt claims that the current method of generating task time estimates is the primary reason for increased expense of projects and their inability to finish on time. The commonly accepted principle is to add safety ([[List of acronyms and initialisms: A#AK|aka]]: pad or slop) to generate a task time length that will essentially guarantee the step gets completed. He asserts that estimates for a task are based on individuals providing values that they feel will give them an 80-90% chance of completing the step, these estimates are further padded by managers above this person creating a length of time to complete a task that is excessive - as much as 200% of the actual time required. It is this excessive padding that has the opposite effect - guaranteeing the task will run full term or late. As counter intuitive as this seems, he provides examples of why this is the case. This predisposes the people on the project to consume the time estimate by:
# Triggering the "[[student syndrome]]" in the resource assigned to the task - they have more than enough time to do the task, therefore they start the task late using up all the safety.
# Encouraging [[Human multitasking|multitask]]ing. The safety is added knowing that the resource will not be able to focus on the task and hence encouraged to multitask on multiple projects at a time, which significantly impacts all projects.
# Not claiming early completion. In order to preserve the safety concept in future projects, resources do not report tasks completed early. Obviously, though, there is no way to hide a late completion.

===Theory of Constraints Primer===
The book presents a primer for Theory of Constraints. This is done in the form of a lecture by a professor who has recently returned from a [[sabbatical]] at a large [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] that uses the Theory of Constraints. The discussion focuses on the current methods of measuring success at a work center ([[Cost estimation models|cost]] and [[Throughput accounting|throughput]]) and shows how they are contradictory to the success of the production line as a whole.

The book enumerates the five principle steps of the Theory of Constraints:
# Identify. Identify the bottleneck of the system.
# Exploit. Exploit this bottleneck, making its throughput efficient by changing processes, equipment maintenance procedures, training, policies, etc.
# Subordinate: Subordinate the throughput of all other work centers to this work center. 
# Elevate. Invest in this work center to increase its throughput - add equipment, manpower, etc.
# Inertia. Start the process over on the line to determine the new bottleneck.
This philosophy keeps the cost and throughput models at odds with one another since the subordination process necessarily decreases efficiency. Hence, evaluation criteria for properly managing a work center must change to properly reward the organization’s success.

The book points out this conflict with respect to an axiom in the Theory of Constraints that states that if two concepts are in direct conflict, then there is an assumption as part of those concepts that is incorrect.

===Steel mill example===
To illustrate, the book uses an example of a steel mill with significant production problems, excess inventory and cost issues. It methodically assigns all the issues of the plant to the method in which success of a work center is measured. The errant assumption is efficiency being measured by tons of steel per hour. The flaw in the measurement is that not all material takes the same length of time to produce and not all work centers have the same throughput. It concludes the sources of the problems for the steel mill are:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Issue'''
| '''Causes'''
|-
| Yard inventory
|
* Over producing product to minimize set-up impact, 
* Producing excess high-throughput material
* Instead of sitting idle, produce unneeded product.
|-
| Raw material shortage
| 
* Over consumption of material to produce material in inventory
|}
After subordination, the key is to maintain a small buffer of material in front of the bottleneck to ensure it never stops producing due to lack of material.

===Basic principles===
After laying this groundwork, the book turns to applying this to Project Management. After declaring the constraint to be the schedule's critical path, the book maps out a set of terms. The result is: 
{| class="wikitable"
| '''Production term'''
| '''Project term'''
|-
| Work center
| Task
|-
| Product
| Time
|-
| Pre-work center inventory
| Work buffer from the feeding tasks of the critical path 
|-
| Bottleneck work center
| Bottleneck resource
|-
|}
It proposes a method of schedule generation where all tasks are estimated at a reasonable time for completion. This would be a time estimate that would give the resource a 50%-60% chance of completing the task on time. The theory being that one task may take less than its estimated time but another may take more - on the average evening out. Since there is no safety, the conditions [[#Scheduling Estimates|above]] that cause misuse of time on the task do not exist.

Safety is not added to individual tasks. Safety is added to the project as a whole (at the end) or to the end of a sequence of tasks feeding the critical path.

===Resources and bottlenecks===
Using numerous analogies and examples, the concept of a resource buffer is introduced. This concept claims that one must ensure the resource bottleneck on the critical path is always busy and stays focused. They should be:
* Kept on task. In other words, minimize multitasking 
* Be ready for the assignment; even if it means they are idle waiting for dependencies to complete.

The book introduces increasingly complex situations to remove the non-practical classroom approach until it reaches two common project situations:
* A bottleneck resource on the critical path and non-critical paths, 
* Multiple projects contending for constrained resources,

The book emphasizes that the project manager has to understand that he or she is not working with absolutes. Resolution of these issues are not absolute. The time estimates are just that - ''estimates'' - they cannot be treated as absolute times. This is essential for the following two points.

===Resource constraints===
A project example is given with a single bottlenecked resource on multiple paths. Since this resource is over utilized on multiple paths its tasks need to be considered when determining the project duration. This results in the introduction of the term ''[[critical chain]]'' - the aggregate of the critical path and the constrained resource leveled tasks.

===Multiple projects===
Projects are going to use common resources. Organizations need to accommodate parallel projects while adhering to the Theory of Constraints concepts. This requires developing a prioritization scheme for the resource to determine the correct order to do work (i.e. proportion of the project buffer remaining). As before, once the scheme has been developed, the resource needs to be focused (not multitasking) on completing the task as soon as possible.

===Cost of money===
The book closes by introducing a concept for a method for determining which projects should be selected for execution. It is based on looking at the investment in each project in terms of money-days. Money-days is the product of the investment in the project and its duration.

==Reviews and analysis==
The book was reviewed by a number of academic and business journals including Harvard Business Review &lt;ref&gt;J. Elton, J. Roe. 1998. "Bringing Discipline to Project Management." Harvard Business Review, 76(2), 153-159.&lt;/ref&gt; and IIE Transactions.&lt;ref&gt;K.N. McKay, T.E. Morton. 1998. "Review: Critical Chain." IIE Transactions, 30(8), 759-762.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a number of academics have studied [[Critical Chain Project Management]] and shown that while the packaging of the content is novel, the ideas are not necessarily original and in some cases, not advisable.&lt;ref&gt;W. Herroelen, R. Leus. 2001. "On the merits and pitfalls of critical chain scheduling." Journal of Operations Management, 19, 559-577.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Herroelen, R. Leus, E.

'''Customer Profitability Analysis''' (in short CPA) is a management accounting method, allowing businesses to determine the profitability of each customer or segments of customers, by attributing profits and costs to each customer separately. CPA can be applied at the individual customer level (more time consuming, but providing a better understanding of business situation) or at the level of customer aggregates / groups (e.g. grouped by number of transactions, revenues, average transaction size, time since starting business with the customer, distribution channels, etc.).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foster|first=George|last2=Gupta|first2=Mahendra|last3=Sjoblom|first3=Leif|date=1997|title=Customer Profitability Analysis: Challenges and New Directions|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270340286|journal=Journal of Cost Management|volume=January 1997|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CPA is a "retrospective" method, which means it analyses past events of different customers, in order to calculate customer profitability for each customer.

== Reasons for introducing CPA ==
Management accounting systems often focus on products, departments, or geographic regions, but not on customers. As a result, companies are often unable to produce reliable per-customer profitability figures, which leads to keeping unprofitable customers, decreasing company's potential to make profits.

The "why?" of Customer Profitability Analysis can be reduced to the simple statement that each dollar of revenue does not contribute equally to profit. Differences in customer profitability can arise from either differences in revenues and/or differences in costs. In other words, customer profitability depends not only on the revenue resulting from sold units of a product or service, but also on the 'back end' services provided, including marketing, distribution, and customer service.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[File:Whale curve - cumulative customer profitability.png|thumb|''Whale curve - cumulative customer profitability'']]According to Harvard Professors: [[Robert S. Kaplan|Robert Kaplan]] (who is co-developer of [[activity-based costing]]) and V.G. Narayanan, the 20-80 [[Pareto principle|Pareto rule]] does not apply to customer profitability for organizations. The whale curve for cumulative profitability (see picture) usually reveals that the most profitable 20 percent of customers generate between 150 percent and 300 percent of total profits. The middle 60-70 percent of customers break even and the least profitable 10-20 percent of customers lose from 50 to 200 percent of total profits, leaving the company with its 100 percent of total profits''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Robert S.|last2=Narayanan|first2=V. G.|date=2001|title=Managing and Measuring Customer Profitability|url=https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=11052|journal=Journal of Cost Management 15, no. 5|volume=September/October 2001|pages=5-15|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''  On the profitability whale curve, the difference between the highest point of the chart and current company profitability (100% profitability) represents unrealized profit potential for the company.

Typically companies have both: customers having positive impact on company profitability, and simultaneously those who erode potential profits of a company, by generating less revenue than costs - thus having a negative impact on company profitability. Often even managers who understand the issue are not able to easily distinct between customers belonging to these 2 groups. &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Leonard|date=2010|title=Customer Profitability Analysis|url=|journal=Profit analytics|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of customer is not a valid premise that the customer is automatically profitable, in fact the evidence suggests that even the largest customers may turn out to be the most unprofitable.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Objective ==

The main purpose of CPA is to provide to organization management with the understanding of each customer profitability. Grouping this information into customer profitability segments, allows the companies to take different, targeted actions and strategies against different profitability segments, having as a target increasing the company’s total profitability. Those companies that understand which customers are more profitable and which are not are “armed with valuable information needed to make successful managerial decision to improve overall organizational profitability”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pete|first1=Ștefan|last2=Cardos|first2=Ildiko Reka|date=2010|title=A MANAGERIAL AND COST ACCOUNTING APPROACH OF CUSTOMER PROFITABILITY ANALYSIS|url=https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:ora:journl:v:1:y:2010:i:1:p:570-576|journal=Annals of Faculty of Economics, 2010|volume=1|pages=570-576|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

CPA allows businesses to take the following key strategic decisions: 

* Identify customers’ profiles;
* Differentiate customer service activities depending on customer profile (e.g. highly-profitable customers could receive more attention, to ensure high-level satisfaction and loyalty, in order to protect continued business relations);
* Differentiate marketing strategy, depending on customer profile (e.g. implement more aggressive and expensive marketing strategies to high-spenders, while limiting the marketing costs against customers, who spend little and show few signs of spending more in the future);
* Take actions, to maintain or increase customers profitability, including turning unprofitable customers into profitable ones (e.g. decreasing cost to serve, of looking for ways to increase revenue, up to ceasing business relations with unprofitable customers to cut the costs)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;.

== Input information ==
Calculation of customer profitability takes into account both revenue associated to each customer, as well as all costs which can be attributed to the customer.

=== Revenue associated to the customer ===
Revenue differences across customers may differ due to various reasons, including:

* Differences in price charged for a unit a product or service to different customers;
* Differences in volumes sold to different customers;
* Differences in product or service specification delivered to different customers&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;;
*Other one-time events, such as bonus events, not directly related to a particular sale transaction.

CPA requires a company to associate all company's revenue to different customers (sources of revenue), in order to find out revenue associated to each customer. Companies most typically have no trouble finding out the amount of revenue attributed to a particular customer, thus article will not cover this aspect.

=== Costs associated to the customer ===
Customers differ in costs they generate by using company's resources in a different way. These reasons may include:

* Different amounts of marketing costs may be necessary to strike a deal with different customers
* Differences in used distribution channels / logistics by different customers
* Differences in customer service required by different customers
* Differences in volume of products purchased (production of large volume of a product for a single order can be cheaper that production of the same amount, divided into many orders, requested by many customers)
* 

CPA requires the company to associate &lt;u&gt;all company's costs&lt;/u&gt; to different customers, even if the costs are not directly related to any particular customer. Some costs can be easily associated with a particular customer (i.e. [[direct costs]] associated to all products sold to the customer), while other costs ([[indirect costs]] / [[Overhead (business)|overhead]], such as electricity bills for running a production plant) are not easy to be associated to a particular customer. There are several [[cost accounting]] methods, which can be used for this purpose, one commonly used method is [[Activity-based costing|activity based costing]].

In order to provide the best input to further management optimization activities, it's recommended to divide the costs assigned to each customer, to different cost pools. These cost pools should be defined depending on company's business, and can include product creation, processing purchase orders, shipping, invoicing, product samples, marketing, customer service, etc.

== CPA results ==

=== Customer profitability check ===
Possessing information defined above in "Input" chapter, management / accounting team can execute various different calculations, rankings, and comparisons between different customers / customer segments, necessary to reaching further conclusions and taking action. Few examples are displayed below, but the scope of calculations should be aligned to the company's business model. 

* Calculate [[operating income]] associated to the customer - if the results is above 0, customer is bringing positive effect on the company, while if is negative, company is currently losing money by conducting business with this customer; 
* Calculate [[operating income]] / [[revenue]] associated to the customer - this metric gives understanding, which part of revenue becomes operating income; 
* Compare customer particular cost pool ratio to average customer ratio - e.g. if 20% of total costs of Customer A is applicable to customer service, while on average, for entire customer base, customer service costs are 10% of total costs, company if given interesting information allowing to take action (look for ways to reduce Customer A customer service costs); 
* other. 

As a result of above, company becomes empowered to take targeted action / strategies against particular customers, or overall strategies against selected customer aggregates or whole customer base.

Literature suggests different strategies towards customers, depending on their profitability. Below are few examples from available literature, nonetheless each company may apply another strategy, better fitting into this particular organization business model, by either modifying below mentioned methods, or employing completely new ones.

=== Customer Classification Matrix (cost to serve / revenue) ===
[[File:Customer Classification Matrix.png|thumb|Customer Classification Matrix]]
The Customer Classification Matrix (matrix of customer revenue and cost to serve) method was suggested by several literature positions &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=Benson B.|last2=Rangan|first2=V. Kasturi|last3=Moriarty|first3=Rowland T.|last4=Ross|first4=Elliot B.|date=1987|title=Manage Customers for Profits (Not Just Sales)|url=https://hbr.org/1987/09/manage-customers-for-profits-not-just-sales|journal=Harvard Business Review|volume=September 1987|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

This categorization shows there are several different ways companies can serve profitable customers. Most valuable customers are in the '''passive''' category, generating high revenue at little costs. These are the most profitable customers, which company should pay special attention to. Some customers generating high revenue, could at the same time be expensive ('''carriage trade''' quadrant) – these may be profitable, if revenue exceeds the costs to serve. There could be customers who are easy to serve, but also bring little profits ('''bargain basement''' quadrant). Finally, the last quadrant ('''aggressive''') is listing customers generating high costs and bringing low revenue. By performing CPA, companies could assign their customer to above quadrants and apply different strategies towards each of the quadrants.

For example:

* Aggressive - company could renegotiate with these customers their delivery terms / pricing / scope of services (to increase revenue), or reconsider internal processes to decrease costs of serving to those customers. Finally, a company could request an increased price for their services, ultimately losing unprofitable customers.
* Bargain basement - company could focus on increasing revenue for these customers, starting with conducting research whether these customers are expecting different services, their price sensitivity, etc. 
* Passive - since passive customers generate most profit the company, company should consider investing their capital into better serving these customers, increasing their satisfaction and loyalty.
* Carriage trade - company should focus on reducing the cost to serve, investigating cost factors and looking for ways to streamline internal processes.

=== 4 boxes (profitability / strategy alignment) ===
[[File:4 boxes - Strategy alignment and Customer Profitability.png|thumb|4 boxes - Strategy alignment and Customer Profitability]]
This 4-boxes (matrix of customer profitability and strategy alignment) method was suggested by several literature positions &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;.

The foundation of the method is ability to decide, which customers are Target customers of a company (aligned to company's business strategy), and which are not. Given additionally the results of CPA (customer profitability), all customers are segmented into 4 segments, each having a different strategy to be applied to the customers:

* Profitable customers in "Target" group are associated to the action "RETAIN" - company should look into the possibility of increasing business relations with those customers, as long as business model will not significantly change;
* Profitable customers in "Non-target" group are associated to the action "MONITOR" - these customers need to be closely monitored, to make sure they don't fall into "Non-target" and unprofitable segment;
* Unprofitable customers in "Target" group as associated to the action "TRANSFORM" - company should employ different strategies to make these customers into profitable segment, or at the very least, to bring them into break-even point. The strategies to be used will differ, depending on the company-customer business circumstances.
* Unprofitable customers in "Non-target" group are associated to the action "REPLACE" - company should cease efforts into developing these customers. Suggested solution is to increase product or service selling prices up to the point, where the customer would either fall into "MONITOR" segment, or take their business to another provider. If that happens, company could refocus freed resources into serving the most desirable (profitable) customers.

== Limitations / implementation barriers ==
Using CPA is associated with some difficulties &amp; limitations:

* Most importantly, CPA is a backward-looking tool, meaning it analyses past events, providing results, based on which companies are making their strategic choices. Past however may not always be the determinant of the future, and decisions made based on past events only, could be incorrect if market conditions, or business strategy change;
* The cost of acquisition and customer service may be difficult to measure;
* Performing [[Activity-based costing|ABC]] or other methods of attributing costs to customers, CPA calculations, outlining distinct strategies towards different groups of customers, communicating internally and implementing those strategies can be a large undertaking for an organization in terms of the resources used and the costs to complete the initiative, requiring specialized knowledge and appropriately developed accounting systems;
* People often feel threatened by change, do not understand it, and are opposed to it within a company (e.g. Commission salespersons will try to protect customers even though they may not be profitable to the company).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2002|title=Customer profitability analysis|url=https://www.icaew.com/-/media/corporate/files/technical/business-and-financial-management/busines-support-functions/marketing/customer-profitability-analysis-gpg-37-march-02.ashx|journal=The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England &amp; Wales, Faculty of Finance and Management|volume=Good Practice Guideline no. 37|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overcoming limitations ===
There are various strategies which could be used to minimize limitations / implementation barriers to introduce CPA, including the following ones:

* Management needs to be sensitive to required change within the organization and be sure that employees are included in the decision and change processes. Management should seek to ensure employee buy-in, to minimize resistance towards change&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;;
*Management needs to properly set internal incentive model, e.g. rewarding salespeople on the basis of customer profitability, as opposed to revenue generated by the customer;
* To minimize the limitation resulting from the fact, that CPA is a backwards-looking tool, a company could additionally consider implementation of [[Customer lifetime value|Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)]]. [[Customer lifetime value|CLV]] is a forward-looking customer profitability estimator, taking CPA as a starting point for calculation. [[Customer lifetime value|CLV]] could be used for forecasting of future customer profitability (based not only on historical events, but also proposed marketing strategy, trends in customer behavior, etc.).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2944">'''Data extraction''' is the act or process of retrieving [[data]] out of (usually [[unstructured data|unstructured]] or poorly structured) data sources for further [[data processing]] or [[data storage device|data storage]] ([[data migration]]). The [[data import|import]] into the intermediate extracting system is thus usually followed by [[data transformation]] and possibly the addition of [[metadata]] prior to [[data export|export]] to another stage in the data [[workflow]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.extractingdata.com Definition of data extraction.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, the term data extraction is applied when ([[experiment]]al) data is first imported into a computer from primary sources, like [[measuring device|measuring]] or [[Data logger|recording devices]]. Today's [[electronic device]]s will usually present an [[electrical connector]] (e.g. [[USB]]) through which '[[raw data]]' can be [[data stream|streamed]] into a [[personal computer]].

==Data sources==
Typical unstructured data sources include [[web page]]s, [[email]]s, documents, [[PDF]]s, scanned text, mainframe reports, spool files, classifieds, etc. Which is further used for sales / marketing leads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suntecdata.com/data-extraction-services.html Data Extraction Services] Retrieved, April 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  Extracting data from these unstructured sources has grown into a considerable technical challenge where as historically data extraction has had to deal with changes in physical hardware formats, the majority of current data extraction deals with extracting data from these unstructured data sources, and from different software formats.  This growing process of data extraction&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loginworks.com/blogs/web-scraping-blogs/209-web-data-extraction/ data extraction.]&lt;/ref&gt; from the web is referred to as "Web data extraction" or "[[Web scraping]]".

==Imposing structure==
The act of adding structure to unstructured data takes a number of forms
* Using text [[pattern matching]] such as [[regular expression]]s to identify small or large-scale structure e.g. records in a report and their associated data from headers and footers; 
* Using a table-based approach to identify common sections within a limited domain e.g. in emailed resumes, identifying skills, previous work experience, qualifications etc. using a standard set of commonly used headings (these would differ from language to language), e.g. Education might be found under Education/Qualification/Courses;
* Using [[text analytics]] to attempt to understand the text and link it to other information

'''David Cowan''' (1742 &amp;ndash; 24 September 1808) was a Scottish farmer, naval officer, ship's captain, ferry operator and political figure in [[Upper Canada]]. He represented Essex County in the [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada]] from 1804 to 1808.

He was born in [[Lanarkshire]] and emigrated to the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in 1770, serving as gardener for [[George Washington]] at [[Mount Vernon]].&lt;ref name="soundings"&gt;[http://www.provincialmarine.org/PM-Oct08News.pdf ''Marine Soundings'', a publication of the Provincial Marine Re-enactment Group, Amherstburg] (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; Cowan served as a lieutenant in the [[Royal Navy]] during the [[American Revolution]] and went on to serve in the [[Provincial Marine]] for Upper Canada, commanding ships on the [[Great Lakes]]. He lived in [[Fort Erie, Ontario|Fort Erie]] and then [[Amherstburg, Ontario|Amherstburg]]. Cowan also owned property in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]].

Cowan is credited with bringing the first [[apple]] trees to the state of [[Michigan]] in 1796, a variety similar to the [[Red Calville]] which he brought to [[Detroit]].&lt;ref name="report"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tc1JAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA337&amp;dq=history+apple+michigan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fVVuTu3zHsf4sgaBgY29BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20apple%20michigan&amp;f=false ''Annual Report of the Secretary of the State Horticultural Society of Michigan'', 1873]&lt;/ref&gt;

At an elementary level, this includes the refusal to [[missed call|answer one's phone]] by [[Call screening|screening one's calls]] or by ignoring mailed notices informing the [[debtor]] of the debt. In more advanced cases, this includes misleading the creditor to believe the debtor does not reside at the location where the creditor is attempting to reach the debtor.

Debt evasion is common because many people are scared of creditors when they owe money and feel uncomfortable confronting those attempting to collect debt. But evasion does not make the debt disappear, and does not make the debtor any less liable toward the creditor.

In most cases, debt evasion is not a criminal act. All [[democracy|democracies]] prohibit [[debtor's prison|imprisonment of people who are in debt]] as a method of forcing their repayment.

==The process==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}
In the process of [[debt collection]], agents are doing a job they are assigned to collect debts. They are usually employed by large companies, so the likelihood the same agent will talk to the same debtor within a short enough period of time is low.

Contrary to what most debtors believe, debt evasion is not always advantageous to the debtor. The creditor, if not challenged, is able to take all legally allowable civil action against the debtor. A debtor's willingness to communicate with the creditor may help reduce some of this action.

On the other hand, any information given to creditor or its [[collection agency]] can be used against the debtor as an [[Admission (law)|admission]].

==Methods of avoidance used==

===Denying existence===
Some debtors pretend to be deceased to avoid paying. For example, if called, the debtor may say s/he is another person and claim the debtor does not live there or has died.

===Court summons avoidance===
Some debt is collected by court order. The debtor is summoned to court and must be served by a summons, usually at the hands of a sheriff. Many attempt to avoid contact with the sheriff and pretend they never received the summons. But the failure to come to court can only hurt the debtor. If the creditor shows to court and the debtor doesn't, the creditor is automatically awarded the case and may start collecting.

===Statute of limitations===
Some jurisdictions have a [[statute of limitations]] that limits the time between the last activity on the debt and the commencement of a civil suit. Once the limitation period expires, debtors can use this fact to stop the calls from an agency by demanding a civil suit be initiated, at which point they may successfully defend based on the expiration of the limitation period.

===Foreign bank accounts===
Some may be able to protect their assets by transferring them into a bank account in a foreign country, where the money is considered to be untouchable according to the laws of the country where the judgment was made.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsweek.com/id/95524/page/2&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the United States, more recent court rulings have made this more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessweek.com/archives/1999/b3639167.arc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''dimensional fact model''' ('''DFM''')&lt;ref name="GR09"/&gt; is an ad hoc and graphical formalism specifically devised to support the [[conceptual model]]ing phase in a DW project. DFM is extremely intuitive and can be used by analysts and non-technical users as well. A short-term working is sufficient to realize a clear and exhaustive representation of multidimensional concepts (e.g., attributes, measures and hierarchies). It can be used from the initial DW life-cycle steps, to rapidly devise a conceptual model to share with customers.

[[Data warehouses]] (DWs) are databases used by decision makers to ''analyze'' the status and the development of an organization. DWs are based on large amounts of data integrated from heterogeneous sources into [[multidimensional database]]s, and they are optimized for accessing data in a way that comes naturally to human analysts (e.g., [[OLAP]] applications).

Data in a DW are organized according to the multidimensional model, that hinges on the concepts of fact (a focus of interest for the decision-making process, such as sales and orders) and dimension (a coordinate for analyzing a fact, such as time, customer, and product). Each fact is quantified through a set of numerical measures, such as the quantity of product sold, the price of products, etc.

DW design and development require ad hoc methodologies and an appropriate life-cycle.&lt;ref name="GR09"&gt;Matteo Golfarelli and Stefano Rizzi.

Journal on Data Warehousing and Mining'' (IJDWM), volume 5, number 2. Idea Group 2009. Pages 1–23. {{ISSN|1548-3924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The DFM is a graphical conceptual model, specifically devised for multidimensional design, in order to:
* lend effective support to conceptual design
* create an environment in which user queries may be formulated intuitively
* make communication possible between designers and end users with the goal of formalizing requirement specifications
* build a stable platform for logical design
* provide clear and expressive design documentation.

The conceptual representation generated by the DFM consists of a set of fact schemata. Fact schemata model facts, measures, dimensions, and hierarchies (Figure 1). Besides these basic elements, the DFM includes a large set of constructs for expressing the multitude of conceptual nuances that characterize actual modeling scenarios in projects of small to large complexity. A multidimensional schema modeled with the DFM can easily (i.e., semi-automatically) be implemented on both [[ROLAP]] and [[MOLAP]] platforms.

== Basic concepts ==

A ''fact'' is a concept relevant to decision-making processes. It typically models a set of events taking place within a company. Examples of facts in the commercial domain are sales, shipments, purchases, and complaints.

[[Image:DFMSimpleFactSchema.png|frame|Figure 1: a simple fact schema for the invoice fact]]

A ''measure'' is a numerical property of a fact and describes a quantitative attribute that is relevant to analysis. For example, each sale is measured by the number of units sold, the unit price, and the total receipts.

A ''dimension'' is a property, with a finite domain, that describes an analysis coordinate of the fact. A fact generally has multiple dimensions that define its minimum representation granularity. Typical dimensions for the sales fact are products, stores, and dates; in which case, the basic information that can be represented is product sales in one store in one day.

A ''fact'' is represented by a box that displays the fact name along with the measure names. Small circles represent the dimensions, which are linked to the fact by straight lines (see Figure 1).

A ''dimensional attribute'' is a property, with a finite domain, of a dimension. Like dimensions, a dimensional attribute is represented by a circle. For instance, a product may be described by its type, category, and brand; a customer may be represented by city and nation. The relationships among the dimensional attributes are expressed by hierarchies.

A ''hierarchy'' is a directed tree whose nodes are dimensional attributes and whose arcs model many-to-one associations between dimensional attribute pairs. A hierarchy includes a dimension, positioned at the tree's root, and all of the dimensional attributes that describe it. Arcs are graphically represented by straight lines that connect dimensional attributes. Hierarchies define the way elemental business events can be selected and aggregated for decision-making processes.

== Advanced concepts ==

[[Image:DFMAdvancedFactSchema.png|frame|Figure 2: a more complex fact schema for the invoice fact]]

A ''descriptive attribute'' specifies a property of a dimension attribute, to which it is related by a x-to-one association. Descriptive attributes cannot be used for aggregation; they are always leaves of a hierarchy and are graphically represented by horizontal lines, like "telephone number" in Figure 2.

A ''cross-dimensional attribute'' is a dimensional or descriptive attribute whose value is defined by the combination of two or more dimensional attributes, possibly belonging to different hierarchies. For example, if a product value added tax (VAT) depends both on the product category and on the country where the product is sold, you can use a cross-dimensional attribute to represent it. Figure 2 shows this example by joining the arcs that define a product VAT with a circular arc.

[[Image:DFMMultipleArc.png|frame|Figure 3: a fact schema for the book sales fact]]

A ''convergence'' takes place when two dimensional attributes within a hierarchy are connected by two or more alternative paths of many-to-one associations. Convergences are represented by letting two or more arcs reach the same dimensional attribute. For instance, in Figure 2 the geographic hierarchy on the customer dimension contains a convergence if we assume that, though no inclusion relationships exists between districts and cities/states, sales districts never cross the nation boundaries. In this case, each customer belongs to exactly one nation whichever of the two paths is followed.

''Optional arcs'' are used to model scenarios for which an association represented in a fact schema is not defined for a subset of events. Optional arcs are marked with a dash. For instance, attribute ''diet'' in Figure 2 takes a value (such as cholesterol-free, gluten-free, or sugar-free) only for food products; for the other products, it is undefined.

A ''multiple arc'' models a many-to-many association between the two dimensional attributes it connects. Graphically, it is denoted by doubling the line that represents the arc. Consider the fact schema modeling the sales of books, represented in Figure 3, whose dimensions are date and book. It would certainly be interesting to aggregate and select sales on the basis of book authors. However, it would not be accurate to model author as a dimensional child attribute of book because a book may have more than one author, and authors can write more than one book. Hence, the relationship between books and authors is modeled as a multiple arc.

'''Edvin Leonard Bergroth''' (26 December 1836 – 29 March 1917) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[engineer]], [[businessman]] and [[vuorineuvos]].

Bergroth studied engineering in [[Hanover]]. After returning to Finland, he worked for the [[VR Group|Finnish State Railways]] and a [[gasworks]], until he moved to [[Caucasus Viceroyalty (1801–1917)|Caucasus]] to work for [[Branobel]]. When he got back to Finland in 1890, he worked in many companies. Bergroth managed the newly re-established [[Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstad|Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works]] in 1895–1900.

Between 1905 and 1915 Bergroth was board member of [[Tampella|Tampere Linen and Iron Industry]]. As a chairman, he initiated several development projects which grew the company and improved its productivity.

Bergroth was married twice. Four of his children lived until adult age.

== Early life and studies ==
Bergroth's parents were [[Pihlajavesi, Keuruu|Pihlajavesi]] [[chaplain]] Johan Mikael Bergroth and Emma Lovisa [[née]] Cajanus; the father died when Bergroth was just six years old. He did his [[Matriculation exam (Finland)|matriculation exam]] in [[Vaasa|Nikolaistad]] [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in 1857 and went to study engineering. After getting a [[scholarship]] he continued in [[University of Hanover|Hanover Polytechnic School]] in [[Prussia]] in 1858 and graduated [[engineer]] in 1860.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Edvin Bergroth I"/&gt;

== Career in Hanover, Helsinki and Caucasus ==
Bergroth worked for the Royal Prussian [[Mint (facility)|Mint]] in Hanover until 1861, and, upon returning to Finland, for a short time for the [[VR Group|Finnish State Railways]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Edvin Bergroth I"/&gt; Bergroth managed construction of Leppäkoski railway bridge in 1862.&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.141-151"/&gt; In the same year Bergroth was appointed [[Technical Manager]] of [[Helsinki]] Gas Illumination Company. The company was a private [[monopoly]], that had been granted in 1860 an exclusive permit for street illumination until 1900 in those areas of Helsinki, where it had built the network.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Edvin Bergroth I"/&gt; Bergroth travelled to Germany and Switzerland for a field trip visiting the local gas works and collecting knowledge.&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.141-151"/&gt; At the time he left the company in 1884, he had become its manager. Bergroth moved to [[Branobel]] in [[Baku]], [[Caucasus Viceroyalty (1801–1917)|Caucasus]], where he got a Technical Manager vacance. Bergroth got back to Finland in 1890, after which he worked for a number of companies. Until 1892 he was inspector in Finnish Sawmills Fire Assistance Association. One of the employers was [[Nokia]], where he worked from 1890 until 1913. By time Bergroth gained reputation as [[businessman]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Edvin Bergroth I"/&gt; When [[Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstad|Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works]] was re-established after [[bankruptcy]] on 18 November 1895, Bergroth was selected its first manager.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Edvin Bergroth I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.48-57"&gt;Osakeyhtiö Hietalahden...: ''Laivatelakka osakeyhtiönä.'' pp. 48–57.&lt;/ref&gt; During his leadership the company enlarged its premises and invested heavily on facilities and machinery. Considering the limited amount of capital and the market situation, Bergroth's management was successful. He left his position in 1900 but continued as board member after that.&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.48-57"/&gt;

By the 1880s city of Helsinki had become increasingly dissatisfied on Bergroth's old employer, the gas illumination company, which was unwilling to invest on new light technology and produced gas inefficiently by burning wood. In November 1899 the city took over the gas distribution; Bergroth was appointed to the board of the new City of Helsinki Illumination Works.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Edvin Bergroth I"/&gt;

== Tampere Linen and Iron Industry ==
In 1905 Bergroth became board member in [[Tampella|Tampere Linen and Iron Industry]] company and in the following year he became chairman of board. The company underwent thorough renewal under Bergroth's chairmanship, and many of the changes were initiated by him. The company invested on new buildings and machinery for linen production, increasing both capacity and productivity. During the economic upswing prior to [[First World War]], the company invested on production of various yarn types, [[canvas]], [[sailcloth]] and [[plain weave]] for bedclothes. The investments continued also during the war, when new linen storage and [[weaving]] facility were built. Bergroth left the board in 1915.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Edvin Bergroth I"/&gt;

== Political career ==
Bergroth was member of [[Helsinki City Council]] in 1875–1877, 1880–1882 and 1897–1899. He represented Helsinki [[bourgeoisie]] in [[Diet of Finland]] in 1882 and 1899. Bergroth took part in number of state committees, Swedish-speaking technical association, &lt;!-- Tekniska Föreningen i Finland --&gt; [[voluntary fire brigade]] activities and [[Charity (practice)|charity]] work.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Edvin Bergroth I"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
In 1864 Bergroth got married to Lydia née von Essen, daughter of [[professor]] [[Carl Gustaf von Essen]] and Catalina Sofia née Arppe. Between 1865–1871 they got three daughters and four sons. After Lydia Bergroth's death in 1872, he was married to Evelina née Bergroth, whose parents were [[vicar]] Carl Edvard Bergroth and Carolina Amalia née Stenbäck. They got one son in 1876. In total, four of Bergroth's children survived until adult age.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Edvin Bergroth I"/&gt;

Bergroth has been characterised as a warm-hearted person.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Edvin Bergroth I"/&gt;

'''GoodWeave International''', formerly known as '''Rugmark''', is a network of [[non-profit organization]]s dedicated to ending illegal [[child labour]] in the [[rug making]] industry. Founded in 1994 by [[children's rights]] activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner [[Kailash Satyarthi]],&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/oct/10/kailash-satyarthi-nobel-peace-prize-childrens-rights|title=Kailash Satyarthi: student engineer who saved 80,000 children from slavery|last=Chonghaile|first=Clar Ni|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The New Yorker"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/malala-yousafzai-nobel-prize|title=A Fitting Nobel for Malala Yousafzai and Kailash Satyarthi|last=Davidson|first=Amy|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/10/10/who-is-indias-kailash-satyarthi-the-other-nobel-peace-prize-winner|title=Who is India’s Kailash Satyarthi, the other Nobel Peace Prize winner?|last=Lakshmi|first=Rama|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; it provides a certification program that allows companies that pass inspection to attach a logo certifying that their product is made without child labour.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thecnnfreedomproject.blogs.cnn.com/2011/04/18/is-your-rug-slave-free/|title=Is your rug slave-free?

Nina Smith, Executive Director of GoodWeave International explains:
"I got involved in the movement to end child slavery because of a boy named [[Iqbal Masih]]. Iqbal was a carpet slave at the age of four and escaped servitude at 10. (...) Upon his return to [[Pakistan]], Iqbal’s life was tragically cut short: he was murdered for his activism. His death helped to inspire the birth of GoodWeave (then RugMark). I read Iqbal’s story in a [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] feature after his death and realized the work that needed to be done in his memory".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfp-dc.org/blog/2010/10/19/7-questions-nina-smith-goodweave-usa/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Media outlets worldwide have given detailed coverage to Rugmark (now known as GoodWeave). For example, ''The [[PBS NewsHour]]'' reported, "GoodWeave offers a labeling system that guarantees that no child labor was used in making the rugs."&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{Cite news

Responding to concern about violation of [[children’s rights]] during the 1980s, [[human rights]] organizations in Europe and India, along with [[UNICEF]]-India and the Indo-German Export Promotion Council, a German government agency, developed the program to provide assurance to consumers that the [[Oriental rug|oriental carpets]] they were purchasing were made by adults rather than exploited children, and to provide for the long term educational and rehabilitation of children found working illegally on [[loom]]s. The program was formally launched in India in the fall of 1994 and expanded into Nepal in 1996.  Thereafter, negotiations with programs in Germany, Nepal, India, and the U.S. resulted in the formal creation of Rugmark International.  An international constitution was adopted in May 1998.

Rugmark International re-branded the certification program and introduced the GoodWeave label in 2009. The organization was also re-branded to GoodWeave International. Today the international network comprises producing country offices in India, Nepal and Afghanistan; and consumer country programs in the [[United States|US]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], and [[Germany]]. GoodWeave International is responsible for licensing throughout Europe and North America.

'''Helio, Inc.''' (stylized as '''HΞLIO''') a current, and former, [[mobile virtual network operator]] (MVNO) using [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]]'s network that offered wireless voice, messaging and data products and services to customers in the continental United States beginning on May 2, 2006. Originally a 50/50 joint venture founded in January, 2005 between South Korean wireless operator [[SK Telecom]] and American Internet services provider [[EarthLink]], early losses caused EarthLink to stop providing additional funding in fall of 2007. SK Telecom provided the required additional funding to sustain Helio, which was re-organized as '''Helio LLC''', and by January 2008, SK Telecom had assumed an increased ownership stake and with it, operational control of the joint venture. Although SK Telecom publicly pledged to support Helio, SK Telecom entered into talks to sell the company to rival MVNO [[Virgin Mobile USA]]. Virgin Mobile USA closed the acquisition of Helio and its 170,000 subscribers on August 22, 2008. Virgin Mobile USA exited the postpaid wireless business and retired the Helio brand on May 25, 2010.

The Helio brand was resurrected by Ubi Telecom in July 2015. Helio's new $29 per month rate plan offers unlimited talk, text and data but at capped data speeds of 128 bits per second.&lt;ref name="theverge.com"&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/6/8903587/helio-mobile-network-sprint-comeback&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Foundation===

'''SK-EarthLink, Inc.''', the joint venture that would become Helio, Inc., was established on January 26, 2005. On October 26, 2005, EarthLink and SK Telecom announced that they had entered into an agreement to change the name of their joint venture from SK-EarthLink, Inc. to '''Helio, Inc'''. and provide a high-end wireless communications service targeting younger, bigger-spending customers.&lt;ref name=CNET_2005&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/EarthLink-mobile-venture-renamed-Helio/2100-1039_3-5914186.html |title=EarthLink mobile venture renamed 'Helio' |author=Borland, John |date=2005-10-25 |work=CNET |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helio provided service as a [[mobile virtual network operator]], primarily via the [[Sprint Nextel]] CDMA network. The joint venture partners described their choice of the name "Helio" by referencing Copernicus' heliocentric view of the universe, saying that wireless communications is the center of the universe for Helio's target customers.&lt;ref name=Helio_2005&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.mail-archive.com/medianews@twiar.org/msg05759.html |publisher=Business Wire |title=Say Hello To HELIO; SK-EarthLink Changes Its Name and Unveils Brand For Its Breakthrough Mobile Offering Launching Spring 2006; HELIO To Leverage SK Telecom Innovation In New Service |date=2005-10-26 |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategy===

SK Telecom hoped to grow its customer base in the United States due to stagnant growth in its saturated home market of [[South Korea]]. Helio management believed that Helio could avoid taking on the major US wireless carriers directly by targeting price-insensitive, technology-savvy consumers.&lt;ref name=CNET_2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ_2006&gt;{{cite news |title=Helio Set to Open Cellphone Stores For the Tech Savvy |author=Young, Shawn |date=2006-08-14 |work=Wall Street Journal |publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc }}&lt;/ref&gt; EarthLink and SK Telecom agreed to provide an initial round of financing totaling $440 million, with each partner owning 50% of the joint venture.&lt;ref name=Helio_2005/&gt;

===Service launch===

When Helio first began offering service via a soft launch in May 2006. Initially, most of the promotion was done by word of mouth and at promotional events held across the country. On July 13, 2006, Helio began running TV commercials with the slogan, "Don't Call Us a Phone Company; Don't Call it a Phone." Helio also began advertising on [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]]s, in the print media, specifically in magazines that serve the 18-32 demographic, and on MySpace. Helio opened five corporate flagship stores located in [[Cherry Creek, Denver|Cherry Creek]], [[Colorado]], [[New York City|New York]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and in [[Palo Alto]], [[San Diego]] and [[Santa Monica]], [[California]].&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/2006/05/02/helio-wireless-0502markets02.html |title=Helio Heats Up Handheld Lifestyle |author=DuBose Tomassi, Kate |date=2006-05-02 |work=Forbes.com |publisher=Forbes.com LLC |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marketing===

On February 16, 2006 and in conjunction with its initial handset lineup, Helio announced it had partnered with [[MySpace]]. Helio created a custom portal for users to interface with the social networking site. Helio was one of the first wireless communications providers in the United States to use social networking as a major promotional strategy. Cingular, AT&amp;T, Sprint and other competitors did not follow suit until months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |title=Cross MySpace, cell phones - mobile social networking taking off|author=Kim, Ryan|date=October 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=CNN |title=MySpace unwired.News Corp.'s youth-oriented Web portal extends its influence into the wireless world|author=Maier, Matthew|date=February 16, 2006|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/02/16/technology/business2_myspace0216/?cnn=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early financial losses===

Substantial startup costs for Helio resulted in millions of dollars of losses per month. These losses caused EarthLink to post a loss for its first quarter of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Atlanta Journal Constitution |title=Earthlink posts $30 million loss for first quarter|date=April 27, 2007|author=Leith, Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt; EarthLink and SK Telecom both upped their initial investments after it became clear that more money would be required to establish the new Helio brand. After this second round of financing ran out, EarthLink declined to provide further money to support Helio, stating that the investments in Helio were draining resources away from the company's core business.

===Change of ownership and control===

On September 21, 2007 EarthLink announced that SK Telecom would be increasing SK Telecom's investment in Helio by $270 million and they would be adjusting ownership positions in the company accordingly and giving operational control to SK Telecom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Yonhap News Agency|title=SK Telecom to raise US$100 mln in capital for U.S. operation|date=July 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Telecom Paper|title=SK Telecom, Earthlink up investments in Helio|date=July 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Telecomworld Wire|author=Earthlink|title=EarthLink confirms SK Telecom's investment in Helio|date=September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2008, CEO Sky Dayton was replaced by Dr. Won Hee Sull, a former executive of SK Telecom.

===Acquisition by Virgin Mobile USA===

In May 2008, rumors arose that Helio parent SK Telecom was in talks with [[Virgin Mobile USA|Virgin Mobile USA, Inc.]] over a possible merger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ali |first=Rafat |title=Virgin Mobile USA In Merger Talks With Helio; Other Options Still Being Considered |publisher=mocoNews.net |date=2008-05-08 |url=http://www.moconews.net/entry/419-virgin-mobile-usa-in-merger-talks-with-helio-other-options-still-being-/ |accessdate=2008-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612151951/http://www.moconews.net/entry/419-virgin-mobile-usa-in-merger-talks-with-helio-other-options-still-being-/ |archivedate=2008-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; SK Telecom denied these rumors, but Virgin Mobile USA divulged that the two, in fact, were having preliminary discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SK Telecom Denies Virgin Mobile Rumors |publisher=Business Week |date=2008-05-14 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/may2008/gb20080514_341566.htm?campaign_id=rss_daily |accessdate=2008-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217082011/http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/may2008/gb20080514_341566.htm?campaign_id=rss_daily |archivedate=2009-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duryee |first=Tricia |title=Virgin Mobile USA Confirms Early Talks With SK Telecom |publisher=mocoNews.net |date=2008-05-14 |url=http://www.moconews.net/entry/419-virgin-mobile-usa-confirms-early-talks-with-sk-telecom/ |accessdate=2008-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515131058/http://www.moconews.net/entry/419-virgin-mobile-usa-confirms-early-talks-with-sk-telecom/ |archivedate=2008-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 27, 2008, Virgin Mobile USA announced that it would pay $39 million in stock for Helio after SK Telecom promised to invest immediately $25 million in cash in Virgin Mobile USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Wall Street Journal|author=Lavalee, Andrew|date=June 28, 2008|title=Virgin Mobile to Acquire Helio}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Business Week |title=SK Telecom Eyes Virgin Mobile USA |url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/may2008/tc20080516_291495.htm |date=May 16, 2008 |author=Kharif, Olga |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010030122/http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/may2008/tc20080516_291495.htm |archivedate=October 10, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Virgin Mobile USA completed its acquisition of Helio, Inc. on August 22, 2008.

Virgin Mobile USA also announced a change of monthly plans and their first integrated phone, the PCD "Shuttle".

===Helio brand defunct===

Sprint Nextel announced in March 2010 that Virgin Mobile USA would stop providing service to its Helio post-paid customers. Sprint Nextel offered Helio customers incentives to switch to Sprint branded service and were told that if they did nothing their service would be disconnected on May 25, 2010.&lt;ref name=cnet2008&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnet.com/8301-17918_1-10462442-85.html |title=Virgin Mobile will end its postpaid plans starting by May 25 |author=Lee, Nicole |date=2010-03-02 |work=CNET |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Helio come back===

The Helio brand was resurrected by Ubi Telecom in July 2015. Helio's $29 per month rate plan offers unlimited talk, text and data but at capped data speeds of 128kbit/s.  &lt;br&gt; On the hardware front, you can either sign up with your own phone (limited to devices compatible with Sprint, Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile and Assurance Wireless), or buy one from their rather outdated selection that includes a Galaxy S4 for $299, Galaxy S III for $249, Galaxy Epic 4G for $49, or a Kyocera Kona flip phone for $89.&lt;ref name="theverge.com"/&gt;

===Plans===

At launch in 2006, Helio offered three "Helio All-In Membership" monthly plans of unlimited data and SMS messaging combined with 500 voice minutes for $65, 1,000 voice minutes for $85, 1,500 voice minutes for $100 or 2,500 voice minutes for $135.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;

Helio also offered "Helio A-la-Carte Membership" monthly plans that offered 500 voice minutes for $40, 1000 voice minutes for $60 or 1,500 voice minutes for $80 combined with pay-as-you-go $.02 per kilobyte data and $.10 per domestic incoming or outgoing text message.&lt;ref name=helio2006&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.helio.com/page?p=join |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028082447/http://www.helio.com/page?p=join |title=Join Helio |year=2006 |archivedate=2006-10-28 |work=helio.com |publisher=Helio, Inc |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Handsets===

At launch, Helio offered two models, the [[Helio Kickflip]] and Helio Hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=ZDNet News|title=Helio kicks off cell phone service|author=Reardon, Marguerite|date=May 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These handsets were replaced by the [[Samsung SPH-a503|Samsung Drift]] slider in November 2006 and the [[Samsung SPH-A303|Samsung Heat]] slider in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=NewsFactor Network|title=Helio's New Phone: On Target or Drifting?|author=Garrett, David|date=November 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Infosync World|title=Helio Heat makes its debut|author=Hooker, Jennifer|date=March 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2007, Helio introduced the [[Helio Ocean|Ocean]], its flagship dual-slider. In August 2007, Helio launched the Fin, an ultra-thin folder with a magnesium body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Wired Magazine|title=Helio Fin|author=Shamoon, Evan|date=October 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Business Wire|title=Helio Fin Packs Advanced 3G Services Into Thinnest Folder Currently Available in the U.S.|author=Helio|date=August 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2007, the Mysto slider saw a limited release to the Korean American market, which was followed up by a general market launch in January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=PhoneMag|title=Helio Mysto available now|author=Davies, Chris|date=January 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Business Week|title=A Holla to Helio's Hip Little Phone|author=Kharif, Olga|date=March 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 12, 2009, Helio launched sales of the Ocean 2 by Virgin Mobile, a device much like the original Ocean but sleeker and having new features.&lt;ref&gt;http://virginmobileusa.marketwire.com/easyir/pkit.do?easyirid=13135DE328B72AB2&lt;/ref&gt;

Helio was criticized for not having the latest phones its marketing promised. Almost all of Helio's handsets were re-branded versions of older Samsung phones that had been offered in South Korea for some time and were not cutting edge at the time of their offering in the United States. Helio handsets' features and specifications were on par with, not better than, offerings from rival American wireless providers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.611connect.com/content/what-deal-helio&lt;/ref&gt; Helios was awarded US Patents for user interface design directed by [[Matias Duarte]].&lt;ref name=duarte&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=D580949S |status=patent |title=User interface for a mobile electronic device |gdate=2008-11-08 |fdate=2006-09-12 |invent1=Duarte, Mathias |assign1=Helio, LLC |class= D14/488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broadband Internet access===

In October 2006, Helio began offering a combined 3G and Wi-Fi broadband Internet access service for personal computers. Customers accessed the Internet from their PC via Helio's 3G wireless service, 50,000 commercial Wi-Fi hotspots operated by Boingo or free Wi-Fi hotspots. The service required use of the Helio Hybrid [[PC card]], a re-branded [[Sierra Wireless]] AirCard. The Helio Hybrid PC card was offered at no cost when customers subscribed to a two-year term agreement costing $85 per month. In contrast, consumers at the time could choose similar service sold under the Sprint brand for $60 per month, albeit without the Wi-Fi roaming subscription which was offered by Helio.&lt;ref name=reardon&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/Helio-introduces-hybrid-wireless-service/2100-1039_3-6122694.html |last=Reardon |first=Marguerite |date=2006-10-04 |work=CNET |title=Helio introduces hybrid wireless service |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hezekiah Frith, Sr.''' (1763–1848) was an 18th-century British ship owner with the reputation of a "gentleman privateer", who engaged in piracy during the 1790s. One of the richest men in [[Bermuda]] during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, he built the Spithead House in [[Warwick, Bermuda]].&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bermuda-online.org/seewark.htm |title=Bermuda's Warwick Parish |author=Forbes, Keith Archibald |date=20 May 2008 |publisher=Bermuda-online.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was married three times, his daughters all marrying [[Presbyterian]] ministers; his son [[Hezekiah Frith, Jr.]] became a prominent religious figure. Brother and sister [[Heather Nova]] and [[Mishka (musician)|Mishka]], two popular Bermudian singers and songwriters, are descendants of Frith.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Rosemary. ''Moon Bermuda''. Emeryville, California: Avelon Travel Publishing, 2006 (p. 65); {{ISBN|1-56691-902-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable descendants include Graham Frith, one of original Buy Out Riddim and Smirnoff Ice promoters; Duncan Frith-Hunter, Learn-a-lot class of 1994; and Ian Frith, EDM connoisseur, part-time professional fence consultant, and the 4th member of Swedish House Mafia. When pictured together, the three Frith brothers are commonly referred to as Ert, Win &amp; Fyah!

==Biography==
[[File:"Spithead" - 18th Century Bermudian home of Hezekiah Frith and 20th Century home of Eugene O'Neill.jpg|thumb|left|"Spithead", the 18th Century Bermudian home of Hezekiah Frith and 20th Century home of [[Eugene O'Neill]] and [[Oona O'Neill]].]]
Born in Bermuda, he was one of seven children born to [[Captain William Frith]] and Sarah Lee. As a successful shipowner during the 1780s and 90s, he became engaged in privateering and smuggling, from which he reportedly made his fortune.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, Croswell. ''The Curse of the Misbegotten: A Tale of the House of O'Neill''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1959. (pg. 159)&lt;/ref&gt; As was normal practise in Bermuda, he often mixed slaves and free men in his crews.&lt;ref&gt;Zuill, William S. ''The Story of Bermuda and Her People''. New York: Macmillan, 1973. (pg.108)&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1796 he slipped into the French port of [[Cap-Haïtien|Cap Français]] at [[San Domingo]] during the night and stole away a captured British transport ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boda.bm/pages/boda_heritage.htm |title=Competitive Sailing: Bermuda's Shared Maritime Heritage |author=Bermuda Optimist Dinghy Association |date=21 May 2008 |publisher=Boda.bm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627222926/http://www.boda.bm/pages/boda_heritage.htm |archivedate=27 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His colourful piratical career may very likely be exaggerated. Participating in a number of privateering expeditions with the [[Royal Navy]], he is supposed to have hoarded treasure from at least two captured ships in the store he operated next to the Spithead House; he supposedly used the water tank at Spithead to smuggle captured goods and other valuable items before filing claim at the Customs House. Frith is also claimed to have rescued (or kidnapped) a Frenchwoman, whom he kept there as a [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]: both are said to haunt the house, according to local lore. The house would later be owned successively by dramatist [[Eugene O'Neill]], Sir [[Noël Coward]]&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.experiencebermuda.com/art/ |title=Art Scene: Bookish Bermuda |author=Gorham, Laura |year=2003 |publisher=ExperienceBermuda.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charlie Chaplin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cruisecritic.com/ports/newport.cfm?ID=130 |title=Ports: King's Wharf |year=1995 |publisher=CruiseCritic.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Granaway home on [[Harbor Road (Bermuda)|Harbor Road]], which he had built for his daughter, was later bought by a family of free blacks descended from a slave named Caprice, who had originally been brought to Bermuda on a ship captured by Hezekiah Frith on one of his voyages. [[Adele Tucker]], a well-known Bermudian educator and co-founder of [[Bermuda Union of Teachers]], grew up in the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bermudabiographies.bm/Bios/bio-adeletucker.html |title=Adele Evelina Johnson Tucker |year=2007 |publisher=BermudaBiographies.bm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115200349/http://bermudabiographies.bm/Bios/bio-adeletucker.html |archivedate=15 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Invensys Rail Group''' was a division of [[Invensys]], a UK-based multinational engineering company. It was a designer, manufacturer and integrator of railway equipment, including automation, [[Railway signalling|signalling]] and controls.  The group was headquartered in [[Chippenham]], Wiltshire, and {{asof|2005|lc=on}}, had over 2750 employees in 14 locations internationally. 
It operated through four companies: 
* Invensys Rail Dimetronic (Spain, Portugal and Latin America); 
* [[Westinghouse Rail Systems]] (UK); and 
* Invensys Rail Systems Australia incorporating Westinghouse Signals Australia and Foxboro Transportation, now known collectively as WRSA (Westinghouse Rail Systems Australia).

Westinghouse Rail Systems Ltd (WRSL) (UK) was previously known as Westinghouse Signals Ltd and before that was part of [[Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company]], named after inventor [[George Westinghouse]].

The other part of Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company, Westinghouse Brakes Ltd, was sold by Invensys to [[Knorr-Bremse]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Invensys]] investor relations news release, 25 April 2000 ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20060314205854/http://www.invensys-investor.com/isys/news/2000/2000-04-25/ Invensys Sells Westinghouse Brakes to Knorr-Bremse]''.  Retrieved from the [[Internet Archive]] on 30 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and has since left the Chippenham site to set up in the nearby town of [[Melksham]].

On 28 November 2012, Invensys agreed to sell its rail arm to [[Siemens]] AG for £1.7bn; the sale was completed 2 May 2013.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/siemens-completes-invensys-rail-acquisition.html Railwail gazette], Sale of Invensys rail to Siemens AG.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44368">'''Israel's Anti-Concentration Law''', formally “A Law for Promotion of Competition and Reduction of Concentration”, is a law passed in December 2013 which seeks to reduce the size of existing large Israeli business groups organized in a pyramidal holding structures, separate financial holdings from non-financial holdings and prevent new pyramids from being formed.

The law was approved by Israel's [[Knesset]] with no objections and included both coalition and opposition parties: 42 coalition Knesset members and 30 opposition Knesset members voted for the law, an extremely rare result in the Knesset's history.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.knesset.gov.il/vote/heb/Vote_Res_Map.asp?vote_id_t=19913. Retrieved on 2016-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anti-Concentration Law is arguably the broadest-reaching economic policy measure taken by an Israeli government since the [[1985 Israel Economic Stabilization Plan]], which helped the country fight hyperinflation. In a January 7, 2014, [[The New York Times|New York Times]] article titled “Overhaul of Israel’s Economy Offers Lessons for United States” Steven Davidoff wrote that “with a single bill and a few big changes in its corporate law, Israel is looking to overhaul its economy and hopefully reduce income inequality”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/07/overhaul-of-israels-economy-offers-lessons-for-united-states/ Overhaul of Israel’s Economy Offers Lessons for United States]. New York Times (January 7, 2014). Retrieved on 2016-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The law followed the creation of a committee, on October 24, 2010, the final recommendations of which were handed in February 2012. The committee's work has taken a dramatic turn and accelerated considerably following the wave of [[2011 Israeli social justice protests|social justice protests]] that swept Israel during the summer of 2011.

The issue of the concentration of economic power in few hands and its effect on competitiveness, prices, productivity, innovation and politics and lawmaking was campaigned for since 2008 by [[TheMarker]], a leading Israeli business publication.

An October 15, 2015 article in [[Financial Times]] stated that: “…it is the role that the business newspaper TheMarker has played in Israel in exposing the effect on the national economy of the concentration of power and wealth in the hands of a few billionaires”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/8843ca9e-70f5-11e5-9b9e-690fdae72044.html#axzz41UmQaaPQ/ A strong press is best defence against crony capitalism].

In a March 23, 2015 article titled “ How To Fix American Journalism” in [[The Nation]], [[Michael Massing]] wrote: “…  TheMarker, an Israeli financial newspaper distributed as a supplement to Haaretz, waged an unflagging campaign beginning in the mid-2000s against the extraordinary concentration of economic power in Israel and the dangers that this development posed to Israeli society and democracy. Led by its founding editor, [[Guy Rolnik]], the paper ran periodic stories and columns that paid special attention to the ‘Israeli oligarchs,’ a small group of billionaires and their families who controlled much of the Israeli economy. When the campaign began, the subject of economic concentration was barely discussed in Israel. The stories fed growing outrage over inequality, leading to a series of mass demonstrations in 2011. Those protests, in turn, spurred the Knesset to pass a bill to break up the Israeli conglomerates. It was a remarkable display of how one news organization, through tenacious and unflinching reporting over a period of years, can help spur systemic change.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thenation.com/article/how-fix-american-journalism/ How To Fix American Journalism]. The Nation (March 23, 2015). Retrieved on 2016-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in a December 11, 2013, [[HaAyin HaShevi'it]], an independent watchdog that focuses on the Israeli press, wrote that “For better or for worse, those who made concentration a major discussion topic are TheMarker, led by Rolnik. This is definitely an exceptional example, not only in Israel, of a media outlet that successfully employs an aggressive, but also creative and diverse, campaign to significantly influence the public discourse to the point of pushing for a law that is expected to lead to major changes in the economy’s structure.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the7eye.org.il/88470 בראייה היסטורית].

==Evidence of concentration==

In April 2008, [[Bank of Israel]] published a paper by research economist Konstantin Kosenko, “Evolution of Business Groups in Israel: Their Impact at the Level of the Firm and the Economy”, in which Kosenko wrote: “Using panel data on 650 public companies from 1995 to 2006, we identify twenty major business groups controlling about 160 listed companies and close to a half of total stock market capitalization, while the 10 largest groups' segment of the market capitalization is among the largest in the western world and amounts to 30 percent. These groups are family-controlled and highly diversified across different industries with common pyramidal structure of ownership: roughly 80 percent of all group-affiliated companies belong to business pyramids. Business groups are dominant especially in the financial sector, where half of banks and insurance companies are 
group-affiliated.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boi.org.il/en/Research/Pages/papers_dp0802e.aspx Evolution of Business Groups in Israel: Their Impact at the Level of the Firm and the Economy]. Bank of Israel (April 16, 2008). Retrieved on 2016-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt; A December, 2011 economic survey of Israel by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] mentioned this paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.financeisrael.mof.gov.il/financeisrael/Docs/En/EconomicData/OECD_EconomicSurveys2011.pdf OECD Economic Surveys: Israel ]. OECD (December, 2011). Retrieved on 2016-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its annual report for 2009, Bank of Israel wrote: “Israel is one of the most concentrated developed countries and even resembles a developing country in this respect (Figure 2). Israel’s business groups are typified by broad sectoral dispersion, a significant tendency to focus on the financial sector, strong maturity of affiliated firms in terms of both age and size, slow growth, and higher levels of financial leverage—and therefore also of risk—among affiliated than among stand-alone companies.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boi.org.il/en/NewsAndPublications/RegularPublications/Documents/Doch2009/pe_4.pdf Bank of Israel: The Financial System and Its Stability]. Bank of Israel. Retrieved on 2016-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The report also stated that: “On the basis of the totality of findings about their activities, one may include Israel’s business groups among the entities that have the latent potential of systemic risk. This is because their activity satisfies two main criteria in the test of systemic risk: both their economic size and their complexity—in terms of concentration of control, ownership structure, and sectoral interrelations with financial and real institutions—create the probability of a spillover effect in the event of their failure, make it difficult to analyze information about their activity, and, in turn, make it hard to assess the risks of this activity and its relation with overall system stability.”

In its interim report, released on October 11, 2011, the committee concludes that the Israeli economy is concentrated, both in the real and financial sectors; that a few holding groups, that have a pyramidal holding structure, control disproportionally large portions of the Israeli economy; that these groups are typically active both in real and financial sectors; and that this structure creates a situation where they are competitors, suppliers and customers of each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mof.gov.il/Committees/CompetitivenessCommittee/TyuyatRec_Report.pdf טיוטת המלצות הוועדה להגברת התחרותיות במשק]. Israel’s Finance Ministry (October 11, 2011, Hebrew). Retrieved on 2016-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pyramidal structure===

The interim report concludes that the Israeli economy as concentrated: “a clear majority (88%) of Israeli publicly-traded companies are characterized by a concentrated holding structure, meaning they have at least one controlling shareholder. In more than a third of the companies, the controlling shareholder holds less than 50% of the capital. A majority of the market capitalization is held by business groups (68%). The prevalent holding structure within Israeli holding groups is pyramidal (in 79% of the groups the structure contains at least two layers of publicly-traded companies. Additionally, the average controlling premium in Israel is among the highest in the world.”

The report also identifies the most influential groups: “24 business groups control 136 (about 23%) publicly-traded companies out of 596 publicly-traded companies.” Focusing on the 10 biggest groups, the report finds that their holding rate is the highest among OECD members.

===Financial and non-financial holdings===

The interim report also concludes that “the Israeli financial sector is characterized by a very high degree of concentration, both relative to the economy’s concentration and to financial sectors in other countries: the five biggest banking groups hold about 99% of public deposits and the six biggest financial groups manage about 69% of the public’s long-term savings. As a result of regulatory demands, almost all Israeli financial entities in Israel have controlling shareholders, and some of the major financial entities have controlling shareholders that also have real holdings.”

The report than describes the close ties between the groups and their controlling shareholders: “Most business groups are active in a few markets, a fact that brings them together in various markets, whether as competitors, suppliers and each other’s customers.”

==Concentration in the Israeli banking sector==

For decades, banking is one of the most concentrated industries in Israel. According to Bank of Israel data, the combined share of two largest banks, [[Bank Hapoalim]] and [[Bank Leumi]], in consumer credit is almost 70% of the total consumer credit of all five biggest banks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boi.org.il/he/NewsAndPublications/RegularPublications/DocLib4/BankingSystemAnnualReport/skira17/figure2.1.2.pdf "התפלגות תיק האשראי לציבור, ובפרט תיק האשראי הצרכני, בין הבנקים הגדולים לבין הבנקים הבינוניים, מארס 2014 עד דצמבר 2017"]. Bank of Israel (May, 2018, Hebrew, p. 100). Retrieved on 2018-11-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The banking sector was a major target of TheMarker’s campaign against concentration. During 2017, TheMarker campaigned for the creation of a parliamentary inquiry committee to investigate the loans that the banks extended to top Israeli business people. In June 2017 the [[Knesset]], Israel’s parliament, voted on the creation of such a committee.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4979224,00.html "אושרה ועדת החקירה הפרלמנטרית לאשראי הטייקונים"]. ynet (June 21, 2017, Hebrew). Retrieved on 2018-11-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The committee’s hearings are still ongoing.

During its late October 2018 sessions, the CEO of Bank Hapoalim and the Chairman of Bank Leumi made unexpectedly positive comments about the concentration committee and the ensuing law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.themarker.com/markets/.premium-1.6576657 "הטעות של הח"כים - והאתרוגים הגדולים במדינה: 6 הערות על ועדת הטייקונים"]. TheMarker (October 22, 2018, Hebrew). Retrieved on 2018-11-8.&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.themarker.com/markets/.premium-1.6601138 “כך לא נראית מנהיגה: הבונקר המוזר של מנכ"לית לאומי”]. TheMarker (October 28, 2018, Hebrew). Retrieved on 2018-11-8.&lt;/ref&gt; These comments were surprising since in 2010 and 2011, while the notion of concentration was still debated, bank executives denied that there is a significant problem of concentration in the Israeli economy.

The inquiry committee itself offered an explanation as to how the cooperation between the banking system and concentrated businesses comes at the expense of consumers and dispersed public. Its economic advisers claim that the financial system provides superior credit terms to large, multi-layered, borrowers who use the resources to generate income by extracting rents rather than by activities that create wide benefit. The rent-extracting activities that were mentioned by the committee’s advisers are concentration, stifling competition, influencing reforms and regulations and other activities that require power over decision makers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.themarker.com/markets/.premium-1.6616271 "יועצי ועדת החקירה לא חוששים לדון במלה בת שלוש אותיות"]. TheMarker (November 3, 2018, Hebrew). Retrieved on 2018-11-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

TheMarker has been pushing for banking sector reform in various occasions in the past too. TheMarker repeatedly pushed for the implementation of the recommendations of a 1985 inquiry committee (the “[[Bejski Commission]]”): to force banks to sell their asset management operations so as not to put them in a conflict of interests with their role as investment advisors. Eventually, in 2004 then-Finance Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] appointed a new commission who reached similar recommendations, and which were adopted and implemented.
Subsequent commissions were also pushed for and supported by TheMarker, e.g. the 2011 [[Trajtenberg Committee]], which recommended that banking sector concentration be confronted. This recommendation was adopted the same year with the creation of another committee (the “Zaken Committee”), which called for a few steps meant to increase competition in the banking sector and cut consumer costs. Additionally, in June 2015 a new committee was formed (the “Strum Committee”), whose recommendations to force banks to sell their credit card companies were adopted too (see below).

==Nochi Dankner and Danny Dankner==

Concentration of economic power was mostly associated with the Dankner family, that together controlled around $100 billion, or a fifth of all financial assets in Israel at the time.

Israeli businessman [[Nochi Dankner]] was the head of Israel's biggest conglomerate, the IDB Group. His close ally was his first cousin, Danny Dankner, who was the chairman of Israel's biggest bank, [[Bank Hapoalim]].

In May 2003, a group led by Nochi Dankner bought the controlling stake of IDB Group, later increasing the stake through open-market purchases.

In its peak, IDB Group's holdings included controlling stakes in [[Cellcom (Israel)|Cellcom]] – one of the biggest cellular providers in Israel; [[Shufersal]], the biggest supermarket chain; Clal Insurance, one of Israel's biggest insurance companies; [[ADAMA Agricultural Solutions|MA Industries]], a producer of crop protection products; Nesher – Israel's cement monopoly; Assets and Construction – a large commercial real estate company; and American Israeli Paper Mills, a large producer of paper products. In March 2011, five months after Netanyahu created the concentration committee, Nochi Dankner's IDB bought [[Maariv (newspaper)|Maariv]], a daily newspaper.

According to a list made public by the Israeli Ministry of Finance, that includes 1,786 real sector concentrated entities affected by the law, the number of such entities related to IDB was the biggest: 232.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mof.gov.il/Committees/CentralizationDecreaseCommittee/taagidim.pdf רשימת התאגידים הריאליים המשמעותיים לפי החוק לקידום התחרות ולצמצום הריכוזיות, התשע"ד-2013]. Israel’s Finance Ministry (Hebrew). Retrieved on 2016-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nochi Dankner is a descendent of the Dankner family, who has been a major player in Israeli business for decades. The family's oldest asset was Israel Salt Industries, which was founded in 1922 and sold to the Dankner family in 1957.

In 1997 the family was part of a group led by [[Ted Arison]], who bought the controlling stake in Bank Hapoalim, Israel's biggest bank. Until he bought IDB, Nochi Dankner was a member of the bank's board of directors, but his cousin and close ally, Danny Dankner, remained a board member, later to become vice chairman and then chairman of the board, a position he was forced to relinquish in June 2009.

Until that time, through Clal Insurance, Israel's biggest insurer, and Bank Hapoalim, the two cousins oversaw the largest share of the Israeli financial sector.

In November 2012 Nochi Dankner was arrested on suspicions regarding securities-related issues related to a February 2012 share issue by IDB Holdings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themarker.com/markets/1.1874460 החשד: דנקנר יזם ומימן תוכנית להעלות את שווי אי.די.בי לקראת ההנפקה].

Retrieved on 2016-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014, a day after he lost control over IDB, Dankner was called to a hearing prior to charges being brought up against him.

Haaretz (December 5, 2016). Retrieved on 2016-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 29, 2018, the Israeli [[Supreme Court (Israel)| Supreme Court]] rejected Dankner’s appeal and increased his prison sentence from two years to three years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-court-dankner/israeli-businessman-dankner-to-serve-three-years-in-prison-after-appeal-rejected-idUSKCN1LE13X Israeli businessman Dankner to serve three years in prison after appeal rejected].

Retrieved on 2018-11-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the appeal was rejected, Shalom Yerushalmi, a former top journalist for Maariv, the newspaper Dankner bought in 2011, wrote: “A significant part of Dankner’s wars were waged against TheMarker, which exposed the tycoon’s dubious actions…”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.makorrishon.co.il/opinion/73691/ “העבירה החמורה שדנקנר לא נענש עליה”].

In an April 2013 commentary HaAyin HaShevi'it described the dynamic between Dankner and TheMarker thus: “TheMarker is a significant contributor to the collapse of [Nochi Dankner’s holding company] IDB: the cell phone market [competition] reform, that tore apart one of Dankner’s conglomerate’s major profit engines, was strongly and unabashedly supported by TheMarker and [its then tech editor] Amir Teig. Lately, it was TheMarker that drew the light to a debt settlement in the works between one of the companies in Dankner’s holding pyramid and Bank Leumi. The speed at which other newspapers and the public in social media adopted TheMarker’s stance - and the eventual decision by Bank Leumi to abandon the settlement - proved that even that, in reality, the fight is still raging on, TheMarker’s defeat of Dankner on the fight over perception and consciousness was, in fact, a knockout.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.the7eye.org.il/60457 “כהה מתמיד”]. HaAyin HaShevi'it (April 24, 2013, Hebrew). Retrieved on 2018-11-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

And a few days after Dankner started serving his sentence, HaAyin HaShevi'it wrote:
“Rolnik, the only economic commentator that did not kneel and bow before Dankner that was the most powerful tycoon in Israel. Rolnik played a critical role in turning Dankner from a “going concern” in the hearts and minds of the business journalists and owners of their newspapers to a “doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern“ in the financial reports of the IDB group.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.the7eye.org.il/305285 “מערכת הנעדרת מכניזמים להגנת החירויות”]. HaAyin HaShevi'it (October 5, 2018, Hebrew). Retrieved on 2018-11-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, Haaretz reported that the then Governor of the Bank of Israel, [[Stanley Fischer]], met secretly with [[Shari Arison]], then the controlling shareholder of Bank Hapoalim, and demanded that she remove Danny Dankner from his position as chairman of the bank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.1256813 פישר לאריסון: דנקנר אחראי לתקלות בהפועלים]. Haaretz (April 22, 2009, Hebrew). Retrieved on 2016-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Fischer said that he lost confidence in Dankner following a string of apparent failures. Arison refused.

Since the conversation was published, TheMarker stood behind Fischer and called for the removal of Dankner. Eventually, on June 1, 2009, Dankner handed his resignation to Bank Hapoalim's board.&lt;ref&gt;http://maya.tase.co.il/reports/details/448598/2/0 Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (June 1, 2009, Hebrew).

Danny Dankner was also charged, and finally convicted, in two separate cases, one related to Bank Hapoalim.

On October 17, 2013, Dankner entered e plea bargain and was convicted of, among other things, obstructing the proper governance of the bank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calcalist.co.il/local/articles/0,7340,L-3614614,00.html דני דנקנר הודה והורשע במרמה ופגיעה בניהול התקין של בנק הפועלים].

On June 11, 2009, after Danny Dankner resigned from Bank Hapoalim, Fischer gave an interview to TheMarker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.1265473 "כבר הבנתי איך המשק פועל"]. Haaretz (June 11, 2009, Hebrew). Retrieved on 2016-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt; In the interview, following a question regarding the reasons for his decision to force Dankner out, Fischer referred to a paper by Randall Morck, Daniel Wolfenzon and Bernard Yeung from September 2005, “Corporate Governance, Economic Entrenchment, and Growth”, from which he read a single paragraph: “Around the world, large corporations usually have controlling owners, who are usually very wealthy families. Outside the U.S. and the U.K., pyramidal control structures, cross shareholding and super voting rights are common. Using these devices, a family can control corporations without making a commensurate capital investment. In many countries, such families end up controlling considerable proportions of their countries’ economies. Three points emerge. First, at the firm level, these ownership structures vest dominant control rights with families who often have little real capital invested – creating agency and entrenchment problem simultaneously. In addition, controlling shareholders can divert corporate resources for private benefits using transactions within the pyramidal group. The result is a poor utilization of resources. At the economy level, extensive control of corporate assets by a few families distorts capital allocation and reduces the rate of innovation. The result is an economy-wide misallocation of resources, and slower economic growth. Second, political influence is plausibly related to what one controls, rather than what one owns. The controlling owners of pyramids thus have greatly amplified political influence relative to their actual wealth. They appear to influence the development of both public policy, such as property rights protection and enforcement, and institutions like capital markets."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/3174/jel.pdf Corporate Governance, Economic Entrenchment, and Growth ].

==The law==

The two major parts of the law limit control in business groups that have a pyramidal holding structure and separates between major real corporations and major financial corporations. Other chapters include provisions regarding the consideration of concentration in granting state rights and general provisions.

===Pyramidal holding structure===

The law states that new pyramidal holding structures will have no more than two layers, that within four years structures will be reduced to three layers and that within six years they will be reduced to two layers.

===Separating real holdings from financial holdings===

The law bars a controlling shareholder in a major real entity (a real entity whose yearly turnover or credit exceeds 6 billion shekels, approximately 1.5 billion dollars) from holding a major financial entity (a financial entity whose assets exceed 40 billion shekels, approximately 10 billion dollars). Also, a financial entity will hold no more than 10% of a major real entity and the holder of at least 5% of a major real entity will not control of a major financial entity.

===Affected groups and businesspeople===

According to the list made public by the Israeli Ministry of Finance,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mof.gov.il/Committees/CentralizationDecreaseCommittee/taagidim.pdf רשימת התאגידים הריאליים המשמעותיים לפי החוק לקידום התחרות ולצמצום הריכוזיות, התשע"ד-2013]. Israel’s Finance Ministry (Hebrew). Retrieved on 2016-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt; the real sector concentrated entities affected by the law include: IDB Group (then controlled by Nochi Dankner), the [[Yitzhak Tshuva]] group (controlled by Yitzhak Tshuva), the Ofer brothers group (controlled by [[Eyal Ofer]] and [[Idan Ofer]]), [[Africa Israel Investments|Africa Israel Group]] (controlled by [[Lev Avnerovich Leviev|Lev Leviev]]), [[Bezeq]]-Eurocom Group (controlled by [[Shaul Elovitch]]), the Paz Group (controlled by [[Zadik Bino]]), the Fishman group (formerly controlled by Eliezer Fishman), Alon Blue Square Group, [[Gazit-Globe|Gazit-Globe Group]] (controlled by Chaim Katzman), The Israel Corporation Group (also controlled by Eyal Ofer and Idan Ofer), the Wertheim group (founded by Muzi Wertheim, deceased), Clal Industries group (controlled by [[Leonard Blavatnik|Len Blavatnik]]), and the [[Azrieli Group]] (founded by [[David Azrieli]], deceased).

==TheMarker’s campaign==

TheMarker, since the newspaper was founded in 2000, pointed out the many distortions in the Israeli economy, but in 2008-2009, following the global [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|Financial Crisis of 2007-08]], the newspaper increased its focus on the concentration of economic power in few hands. In these articles, the businesspeople who control the big conglomerates were described as “tycoons”, a term that became to bear resemblance to “[[Robber baron (industrialist)|Robber barons]]”.

The Campaign consisted of hundreds of analyses, columns, features and investigative pieces on the monopoly power of the many big companies that where controlled by tycoons, the duopoly banks, the close ties between big business and media and the difference between pro-market and pro-business economic policies.

==The Brandeis approach to anti-trust and concentration==

In a June 2010 special edition, TheMarker and Rolnik called on Israeli politicians, regulators and civil society to adopt a “Brandeisian” approach to anti-trust and economic policy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haaretz.com/1.5144789 "Democracy or Economic Concentration. Your Choice"]. Haaretz (July 6, 2010). Retrieved on 2018-11-8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Supreme Court of the United States | U.S. Supreme Court]] Justice [[Louis Brandeis]] is well known for his approach to [[Competition law | anti-trust]] that focuses on the importance of fighting “bigness” - the  concentration of economic and political power in the hands of the few in the beginning of 20th century U.S. TheMarker’s special edition was dedicated to the role of Justice Brandeis in fighting the American oligarchy in the U.S and in its opening column Rolnik called for a Brandiesian movement in Israel to curtail the increasing power of the Israeli oligarchy. "In taking on power-hungry tycoons 100 years ago” Rolnik wrote, “Louis Brandeis became the social conscience of the most capitalist country in the world. Who will be Israel’s savior from the oligarchs?”

==Adoption of the Brandeisian view==

The campaign of TheMarker, Rolnik and civic groups such as the [[Movement for Quality Government in Israel]] eventually prevailed. The report of the concentration October 2010 committee, the eventual law and Israel’s Anti-trust Authority all adopted some of the ideas of a political view of anti-trust, aka the Brandeisian view of anti-trust. For example, the committee’s final report states that “pyramidal [corporate] structures enable the creation of business and even political lobbies that results in the economic entrenchment of business groups and their owners”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mof.gov.il/Committees/CompetitivenessCommittee/FinalReport_FinalRec.pdf "הוועדה להגברת התחרותיות במשק: המלצות סופיות והשלמה לדו"ח הביניים"]. Israeli Finance Ministry (March 2012, Hebrew, pp. 9-10). Retrieved on 2018-11-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the explanatory notes to the anti-concentration law state that: “A small number of large holding groups currently control a significant share of the crucial infrastructure that the State has thus far allocated. These groups have accumulated significant power, among other things, because of the rights granted to them. Economy-wide concentration considerations are designed to disperse the power given to holders of national infrastructure…”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nevo.co.il/law_word/Law15/memshala-706.pdf "רשומות; הצעות חוק; הממשלה, 706"]. nevo.co.il (July 9, 2012, Hebrew, p. 1085). Retrieved on 2018-11-8.&lt;/ref&gt; And, finally, a January 2017 document by Israel’s Anti-trust Authority stated that “… the fear underlying the thesis of the existence of economy-wide concentration is of the exertion of bargaining power over the decision-making level.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antitrust.gov.il/subject/203/item/34435.aspx "מתודולוגיה לבחינת ריכוזיות כלל-משקית"]. Israel’s Anti-trust Authority (January 17, 2017, Hebrew, p. 4). Retrieved on 2018-11-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israeli Anti-trust Authority’s 2017 document outlines the way that economic power and concentration will be accounted for in decisions by the government and the anti-trust authority. The brief adopted two ideas that were promoted and primed by TheMarker for years: concentration of economic power leads to great risk of both [[Regulatory capture]] and “media capture”. &lt;ref&gt;For instance, see [https://www.themarker.com/news/macro/1.3429105 "פרופסור מיכל גל: "ראינו כמה שבי רגולטורי משמעותי במשק שלנו עם סיגרים וסוגיות אחרות""]. TheMarker (January 24, 2012, Hebrew). Retrieved on 2018-11-8.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the document, economic concentration raises the risk of regulatory capture and media capture. The brief asserts that business groups that gain significant economic power can have power vis-à-vis the regulators and that businesses that have investments and holdings in the news media in their portfolio may potentially have influence over politicians and regulators.

The concepts related to the connection between economy-wide concentration and economic policy and regulation were a main theme in the campaign of TheMarker. In 2014, Samuel Neaman Institute, a leading research institute within Israel’s [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology | Technion]], awarded Rolnik a grant to conduct a study on the connection between regulatory capture and concentration. Rolnik wrote the study in [[Harvard University]], where he was a fellow in 2014-2015. In January 2015 Rolnik presented the findings in the keynote address of Israel’s Anti-trust Authority annual event with his co-author, Dr. Roy Shapira from [[Harvard Law School]].

==The counter-campaign==

Among all major Israeli newspapers, TheMarker was the only one that put concentration on the agenda, primed it and framed it as harmful to the economy and as an issue that is not partisan. Other newspapers ignored or opposed it.

The counter-campaign was led by [[Globes]] and [[Yedioth Ahronoth]]. Between 1999 and 2016 Globes was controlled by Israeli tycoon [[Eliezer Fishman]]. Fishman was also the second-biggest investor in Yedioth Ahronoth, which is controlled by [[Arnon (Noni) Mozes]] and was for four decades the most popular and powerful newspaper in Israel.
In late 2016, following the collapse of Fishman's business empire, court documents that were handed to the court by him and the banks that lent him money, revealed that, in the decade prior to its collapse, Fishman's debts to banks were much larger than his assets and that he had trouble paying them off.
The Israeli investigative television program Uvda included testimonies of journalists that said that Globes’ editorial line was meant to thwart reforms meant to increase banking reforms and contain the power of Israel's biggest businesspeople. This helped in insulating Fishman and his lender banks and letting him maintain control of his empire for a decade even though it was, in fact, owned by Israel's banking duopoly – Hapoalim and Leumi.

According to HaAyin HaShevi'it, TheMarker is the only newspaper who fought against concentration while most newspapers tried to delegitimize it or to water it down.

In February 2010, HaAyin HaShevi'it wrote that when an economics commentator of one newspaper mocks the idea of concentration, “it is clear to all who he is pointing his arrows at: TheMarker”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the7eye.org.il/47362 מקפידים להכחיש]. HaAyin HaShevi'it (February 2, 2010, Hebrew). Retrieved on 2016-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in a May 2010 post referring to another commentary by another newspaper opposing the fight against concentration, HaAyin HaShevi'it wrote that he “does not mention TheMarker by name, but hints about a campaign that it has been running lately against concentration”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the7eye.org.il/52488 טרור מחשבתי]. HaAyin HaShevi'it (May 30, 2010, Hebrew). Retrieved on 2016-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

HaAyin HaShevi'it also reported on the comments made by yet another commentator. In a May 2015 post, it wore: “This week, as in most weeks, [this newspaper] aggressively criticizes his colleagues from TheMarker: ‘a certain group of journalists’ he writes about them and adds: ‘the knights of justice’, ‘the media’s purists’, ‘a closed and frightened tribe that is leaning on its scriptures and recites all kinds of empty slogans on concentration and competitiveness veiled as fake concern for consumers’”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the7eye.org.il/160550 להיות פרווה]. HaAyin HaShevi'it (May 29, 2015, Hebrew). Retrieved on 2016-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Nochi Dankner’s conviction, HaAyin HaShevi'it wrote that along with him, most of the Israeli press should have been convicted: “The problem is, of course, that it was a trial that the Israeli press could not attend because it should have been sitting next to Dankner as a defendant. After all, the overwhelming majority of the Israeli press – except few reporters and after that a whole newspaper, TheMarker – was part of the felony by action or inaction. In fact, Dankner could not have operated alone without that full and close partnership of the mainstream media and some of its leading reporters”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the7eye.org.il/209798 ציבור המשקיעים הופקר]. HaAyin HaShevi'it (July 4, 2016, Hebrew). Retrieved on 2016-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objections to the committee and the law==

Apart from the press, the committee was also met with objections, mainly from executives and corporations that stood to be affected by the recommendations.

In a paper filed with the committee in March 2011, IDB claimed that (1) there is no connection between concentration and competitiveness (2) concentration in Israel is average relative to other countries (3) the concentration in Israel is in a gradual process of decline, and (4) concentration is not addressed by any regulatory agency of any country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mof.gov.il/Committees/CompetitivenessCommittee/FirstRound_IDB.pdf מענה לפניית הוועדה להגברת התחרותיות במשק – נייר עמדה מטעם אי.די.בי אחזקות]. Israel’s Finance Ministry (March 30, 2011, Hebrew). Retrieved on 2016-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its paper, IDB cited OECD Secretary General [[José Ángel Gurría]], who said in 2010 that in the last generation, Israel's competitiveness has improved “beyond recognition”; and the former Chief Justice of [[Supreme Court (Israel)|Israel's Supreme Court]], [[Aharon Barak]], who wrote in 1998 that “the relative small size of the Israeli economy justifies – and makes possible – a high concentration relative to other countries”.

==The committee’s work==

The committee tasked with recommending on ways to increase competitiveness and decrease concentration was formed in October 2010. The committee was supposed to present its recommendations by March 2011, but the deadline was extended a few times. Its members came from the Prime Minister's Office, the Finance Ministry, Bank of Israel, the Antitrust Authority, the Securities Authority and the Attorney General.

In the meantime, many of its original members left, three of which for high-paid positions in the private sector: Rony Hizkiyahu and Udi Nissan left for the Yitzhak Tshuva group and Zohar Goshen started consulting Nochi Dankner. Following the July 2011 social justice protests, and in order to respond to the protesters’ demands, Netanyahu replaced the positions that were vacated.

In October 2011 the committee issued its interim report and issued its final report in February 2012.

==The social protests and the Trajtenberg Committee==

In July 2011, a wave of social protests, the biggest in Israel's history, erupted and swept the country for almost two months. Its peak came on September 3, 2011, when about half a million protesters went to the streets in many cities across the country.

The demonstrators, who adopted the slogan “The people demands social justice”, protested the high cost of living, especially housing and food, against inequality, against the banking system and against concentration.

Seeing the protests as a threat to his government, Netanyahu formed, in August 2011, the “Committee for Economic and Social change”, which was tasked with examining and proposing solutions to Israel's socio-economic problems. The committee was headed by economist Prof. Manuel Trajtenberg and was as informally known as the [[Trajtenberg Committee]].

In the epilog of its recommendations, which were published on September 26, 2011, the committee wrote: “The committee finds that there is considerable concentration in many of the Israeli economy’s markets as well as infrastructure. This concentration is manifested by difficulties and failures owing to barriers to entry of new, local entrants, barriers to imports and barriers to market expansion and innovation”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hidavrut.gov.il/sites/default/files/%20%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%99.pdf?bcsi_scan_99FE300B8A2E1F36=1 דו"ח הוועדה לשינוי כלכלי חברתי]. Hidavrut.org.il (September 26, 2011, Hebrew). Retrieved on 2016-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

These finding further strengthened the conviction that Israel does suffer from a problem of concentration and pushed to Concentration Committee, which was yet to publish its interim report, to follow suit.

==Similar policies campaigned for by TheMarker==

In the years leading up to the law and the years after the law was enacted TheMarker campaigned for and supported other related issues:

===Cellular market reform===

TheMarker convinced and later supported [[Moshe Kahlon]], while he was Minister of Communications (2009-2013  to reform the cellular market, which he saw as uncompetitive, by introducing [[Mobile Virtual Network Operator]]s (MVNOs). The move was strongly opposed by all incumbent players, two of which are owned by concentrated groups, as well as by most newspapers. Eventually, in 2010, the reform was enacted, resulting in significantly reduced consumer bills and, according to a Ministry of Finance paper, in 17.5 million shekels (approximately 4.6 billion dollars) of total economy savings up to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themarker.com/technation/1.2938246 הסכום המדהים שחסכה לנו רפורמת הסלולר - והאם המחירים יעלו בקרוב]. TheMarker (May 9, 2016, Hebrew). Retrieved on 2016-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bankers’ pay===

TheMarker has been pushing for many years for capping bank executives’ pay as, according to newspaper, their pay did not reflect market forces but rather the banking duopoly, the regulation that protects them from competition and corporate governance failure. On March 3, 2016, and with no objections, Israel's Knesset approved a bill that capped the maximum yearly pay in financial intuitions recognized for tax purposes at 2.5 million shekels (approximately 650 thousand dollars).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calcalist.co.il/local/articles/0,7340,L-3684687,00.html הכנסת אישרה הלילה את החוק להגבלת שכר הבכירים בבנקים ובביטוח]. Calcalist (March 29, 2016, Hebrew). Retrieved on 2016-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, CEOs’ pay would not exceed 35 times the wages of the lowest-paid employee, including people employed via contractors.

===Banking sector reform===

On September 1, 2016, a committee created by Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon and the Bank of Israel's Governor [[Karnit Flug]], recommended that Israel's two biggest banks, Hapoalim and [[Bank Leumi|Leumi]], sell their credit card companies and that new competitors be set up to compete against banks in the credit markets.

===Competition in the food market===

On March 19, 2014, the Knesset approved, with no objections,&lt;ref&gt;https://oknesset.org/vote/7154/. Oknesset.org. Retrieved on 2016-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt; another law supported and campaigned for by TheMarker: a law for the promotion of competition in the food market. The law aims to increase competition by limiting the market influence of major chains and suppliers and by affording smaller suppliers with bigger and more prominent shelf space.

Amouzou was born in [[Gbatope]], located in [[Zio, Togo|Zio Prefecture]].&lt;ref name=JO&gt;[http://www.legitogo.gouv.tg/annee_txt/1993/Pages%20from%20jo_1993-024.pdf ''Journal Official de la Republique Togolaise''], 6 August 1993, page 3 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the August 1993 presidential election, Amouzou ran as an independent candidate.&lt;ref name=JO/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vict&gt;[http://www.keesings.com/search?kssp_selected_tab=article&amp;kssp_a_id=39583n01tgo "Aug 1993 &amp;ndash; Election victory for Eyadema"], ''Keesing's Record of World Events'', volume 39, August 1993 Togo, page 39,583.&lt;/ref&gt; He and [[Ife Adani]] were the only candidates to stand against President Eyadéma, who won 96% of the vote. Amouzou and Adani were not considered serious challengers; all of the major opposition leaders chose to boycott the election.&lt;ref name=Vict/&gt;

Led by Amouzou, the ULI was founded in November 1993 as a moderate opposition party, representing the political space between Eyadéma's [[Rally of the Togolese People]] (RPT) and the radical opposition [[Collective of Democratic Opposition-2]] (COD-2).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,463af2212,469f2f522,469f38e9c,0.html "Chronology for Kabre in Togo"], Minorities at Risk Project (UNHCR.org), 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Togolese parliamentary election, 1994|February 1994 parliamentary election]], he ran as a candidate in Zio Prefecture, but did not win a seat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etiame.com/etiame502.htm "05 février 2007: «catastrophe gbatopéenne»"], Etiame.com {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amouzou and the ULI were viewed as close to the RPT, and Amouzou was described as "virtually a second RPT candidate" at the time of the 1998 presidential election; his critics alleged that he was merely a tool of Eyadéma who was used to manipulate the political playing field in Eyadéma's favor. He placed last in the 1998 election with 0.35% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8U4EAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Jacques+Amouzou&amp;dq=Jacques+Amouzou&amp;ei=954USsebJZS0zgTh5ITuBw&amp;pgis=1 ''Africa Today'', volume 4] (1998), pages 24&amp;ndash;25 and 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

When the British design magazine ''[[Wallpaper*]]'' described the [[Afrikaans|Afrikaans language]] as  "one of the ugliest languages in the world"  in its September 2005 edition (in reference to the [[Afrikaans Language Monument]]), Rupert responded by withdrawing advertising for his companies' brands such as [[Cartier SA|Cartier]], [[Van Cleef &amp; Arpels]], [[Montblanc (pens)|Montblanc]] and [[Dunhill (luxury goods)|Alfred Dunhill]] from the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.iafrica.com/news/657706.htm |title=Rupert snubs mag over Afrikaans slur |publisher=Business Africa |date=5 December 2005 |accessdate=31 December 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216042054/http://business.iafrica.com/news/657706.htm |archivedate=16 February 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, it was reported that Rupert had dropped [[Bell Pottinger]] as the PR agency of [[Richemont]], accusing Bell Pottinger of running a social media campaign against him, to divert attention away from persistent '[[state capture]]' allegations levelled at the [[Gupta family]].&lt;ref name="Hasenfuss"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hasenfuss|first1=Marc|title=Johann Rupert vexed by ‘spin campaign’|url=https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/2016-12-02-johann-rupert-vexed-by-spin-campaign/|accessdate=7 April 2017|work=Business Day|date=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="duToit-25Jan2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=du Toit|first1=Pieter|title=How Rupert Was Warned About Bell Pottinger: 'They're Behind It.'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2017/01/25/how-rupert-was-warned-about-bell-pottinger-theyre-behind-it/|accessdate=7 April 2017|work=Huffington Post|date=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, Rupert alleged that Bell Pottinger had maliciously altered his Wikipedia page. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Amato |last=Carlos |url=http://www.businesslive.co.za/fm/features/2017-02-16-the-worst-thing-is-to-invest-in-sa-and-create-jobs-and-be-criticised-for-it-says-johann-rupert/ |title=Johann Rupert on being cast as the poster boy of 'white monopoly capital'|publisher=businesslive.co.za|date=16 Feb 2017 |accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rupert e-mailed his friend [[Jimmy Wales]], the Wikipedia founder, to revert the alterations made to his Wikipedia page.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesslive.co.za/fm/features/2017-02-16-the-worst-thing-is-to-invest-in-sa-and-create-jobs-and-be-criticised-for-it-says-johann-rupert/|title=Johann Rupert on being cast as the poster boy of 'white monopoly capital'|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, Rupert, during [[Richemont]]’s annual general meeting in Geneva, described the use of the term "Radical Economic Transformation" by Bell Pottinger as "just a code word for theft”, in order to cover up the "State Capture" by their clients, the notorious Gupta family. Radical Economic Transformation is a policy championed by President [[Jacob Zuma]] to reduce racial inequality in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fin24.com/Economy/johann-rupert-radical-economic-transformation-just-a-code-word-for-theft-20170913|title=Johann Rupert: Radical economic transformation just a code word for theft|work=Fin24|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Treasure''' (20 June 1924 – 9 February 2004) was a leading figure in the British advertising industry in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. He was chairman of [[J. Walter Thompson|J Walter Thompson]] in the UK while it was the country's number one agency, and then vice chairman of [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]] when it in turn held the number one position; he was also Dean of [[Cass Business School|City University Business School]] and Master of the [[Worshipful Company of Marketors]]. He was a potent proponent of the economic and social value of his industry, and became known as "Mr Advertising."

== Early life and rise in BMRB and JWT ==
John Albert Penberthy Treasure was born at [[Usk]], in [[Monmouthshire]], on 20 June 1924. The son of a bank clerk, he was brought up in [[Cardiff]], where he was educated at the High School, and went on to take first-class honours in economics at University College, then part of the [[University of Wales]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt; In 1947 he won a Kemsley Fellowship to spend two years in America. He returned to teach and read for a doctorate at [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]]; his thesis, ''On problems of the British export trade'', later had some influence on the reporting of balance of payments figures. Meanwhile, he made ends meet by offering guided tours of Cambridge's colleges which earned him £5 a day.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; He met and married Valerie Bell during this period, and to finance his PhD studies, in 1952 he joined the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB). By 1957, he was BMRB's managing director; by 1960, director of the marketing and research department at its parent company, [[J. Walter Thompson|J Walter Thompson]]. While running this 60-strong department, he set up a research and development committee to plan and manage JWT's substantial research budget. Innovations during this period included the TV Attention Survey (a prototype of modern TV audience research which gave useful insights, enabled JWT to buy airtime better and became a remarkable new business tool) and the creative workshop, which tested new and experimental ideas with qualitative research. JWT became the standard bearer of modern market research and the theory of how advertising works, what it does and how to measure it.&lt;ref name="The Times"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article1028027.ece The Times], 24 Feb 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 'Mr Advertising' ==
In 1967, at the age of 43, Treasure became JWT chairman. Between then and 1976, when he resigned, he presided over one of the most successful periods in the long life of that agency: under his chairmanship, JWT in the UK grew fourfold in recorded billings from £20 million to £80 million.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/feb/18/guardianobituaries.advertising The Guardian], obituary by Jeremy Bullmore, 18 Feb 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Treasure became a director of the J Walter Thompson company worldwide, becoming vice chairman in 1974, and was president of both the [[Institute of Practitioners in Advertising]] and the Market Research Society. He was also president of the National Advertising Benevolent Society and later of the [[History of Advertising Trust]], where he remained a governor until 2002; he also headed a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] committee on communications.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; Not only to the advertising village, but also to a much wider world outside, he became known as ‘Mr Advertising’.&lt;ref name="The Times" /&gt; When he was the subject of [[Bernard Levin]]'s chat show The Levin Interview in 1966,&lt;ref name="Levin"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1743583/ The Levin Interview], aired 5 April 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; the television critic of [[The Sunday Times]] wrote: “On the level of civil, intelligent Q&amp;A it was very good. A good deal of rubbish that is talked about advertising, from both sides, was sensibly disposed of.”&lt;ref name="The Times" /&gt;

== Academia and the Saatchis ==
He left the agency world in 1977 at the age of 52 to become Dean and Professor of Marketing at the [[Cass Business School|City University Business School]], where in four years he raised the school's profile, expanded its range and secured new professorial posts and premises.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; He returned to the commercial advertising world in 1980, running his own agency John Treasure and Partners, which then merged with Freeman Mathews Milne to become Freeman Mathews Treasure, before the Saatchi brothers, possibly in recognition of the role he had played in suggesting them to [[Margaret Thatcher]] for the Conservative Party account, invited him to become vice-chairman of their rapidly growing agency. He joined [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]] in 1983, and added weight and gravitas to the predominantly young and aggressive management team there for several years.

== Taylor Nelson and the Marketors ==
In 1989 he moved back to his first love, market research, to become chairman of [[Taylor Nelson Sofres|Taylor Nelson AGB plc]], and presided over its acquisition of Sofres to become the world’s number two market research group.  In the Millennium year he was a well-connected, highly regarded Master of the [[Worshipful Company of Marketors]].&lt;ref name="The Times" /&gt; He retired the following year, and though he was active in [[Richmond, London|Richmond, Surrey]] (he chaired the Friends of Old Deer Park and raised money for [[Richmond Theatre]] and the Museum of Richmond)&lt;ref name="The Times" /&gt; his health declined from then on.

== Character and influence ==
Colleague and industry commentator Jeremy Bullmore wrote: "Although he retained a certain reserve all his life, Treasure was always possessed of presence; he commanded attention. He chaired meetings and spoke in public with natural confidence and evident enjoyment.... The source of this authority was a clear and analytical mind, combined with an enviable ability to express complicated thoughts in jargon-free language.... Treasure's intellectual curiosity, his withering contempt for flabby thinking and his fascination with theory had a liberating effect on others. His presence seemed to grant implicit permission to experiment, to speculate and to innovate."&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt;

Possibly the best evidence of Treasure’s intense focus and competitive nature came from golf. He took up the game at the age of 50, becoming an active member of Royal Mid-Surrey Golf Club – and within five years, with RMS professional David Talbot, he had become good enough to compete in the [http://www.pga.info/PGANationalProAmChampionship/40868009.htm State Express 555 National Pro-Am Championship] at Penina in Portugal. He holed a 40-footer on the 18th green to draw level with the leaders, and the pair went on to win the play-off;&lt;ref name="PGA"&gt;[http://www.pga.info/PGANationalProAmChampionship/40868009.htm PGA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129031356/http://www.pga.info/PGANationalProAmChampionship/40868009.htm |date=29 November 2010 }}, National Pro-Am website.&lt;/ref&gt; at the winners' press conference, Treasure revealed that he had dreamed the night before that he would win with just such a putt, provoking the [[Daily Mail]] headline "Prophetic Prof Sinks Dream Putt".&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1454437/Professor-John-Treasure.html The Daily Telegraph], 16 Feb 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Good publicity was in his nature.

John Treasure's influence on the advertising profession and its image in the UK was significant and lasting: [[Maurice Saatchi, Baron Saatchi|Maurice (later Baron) Saatchi]] called him “one of the great figures of advertising”.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; Hamish Pringle, the IPA director-general, said: "With John's passing we have lost another giant of UK advertising. His contribution to the industry was enormous."&lt;ref name="Campaign"&gt;[http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/203128/Former-JWT-chief-John-Treasure-dies-aged-79/?DCMP=ILC-SEARCH Campaign Magazine], 20 Feb 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Treasure died in Kingston Hospital on 9 February 2004. His papers from his time at JWT are stored as the John Treasure Collection at the [[History of Advertising Trust]].&lt;ref name="HAT"&gt;[http://www.hatads.org.uk/hat/newsitem.php?A=127&amp;C=22 The History of Advertising Trust] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720001506/http://www.hatads.org.uk/hat/newsitem.php?A=127&amp;C=22 |date=20 July 2011 }}, website.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6555">'''Kick the cat''' (or '''kick the dog'''&lt;ref name=pt&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200509/learning-not-lash-out|title=Learning Not to Lash Out|work=Psychology Today|first=Kat|last=McGowan|date=1 September 2005|accessdate=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[metaphor]] used to describe how a relatively high-ranking person in an organization or family [[Displacement (psychology)|displaces]] his or her frustrations by abusing a lower-ranking person, who may in turn take it out on his or her own subordinate.

==Origin of the idiom==
The term has been used at least since the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DHwXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA35&amp;dq=%22kick+the+cat%22+business&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NrV1VNC5BbOUsQS7yYKQCg&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kick%20the%20cat%22%20business&amp;f=false|title=Journal of Proceedings of the ... Annual Convention of Young Men's Christian Associations of the United States and British Provinces, Volume 14|p=35|year=1869}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author John Bradshaw, humans were far more cruel to cats at that time, to the extent that kicking one was not perceived to be unusual and hence entered the language as a popular idiom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cat Sense: How the New Feline Science Can Make You a Better Friend to Your Pet|first=John|last=Bradshaw|p=194|publisher=Basic Books|year=2013|isbn=978-0-465-04095-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept was reinforced in British culture by a scene in the ''[[Blackadder]]'' episode ''[[Nob and Nobility]]'' in which Edmund Blackadder kicks the cat when annoyed, and the cat bites the mouse, and the mouse bites Baldrick.

In current usage, the name envisions a scenario where an angry or frustrated employee comes home from work looking for some way to take out his anger, but the only thing present is the cat. He physically abuses it as a means of relieving his frustration, despite the cat playing no part in causing it.&lt;ref name="glass"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWy2GlYGDx0C&amp;pg=PT80&amp;lpg=PT80&amp;dq=kick+the+cat+syndrome&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2EgZkGoIvF&amp;sig=U8Gf-TrF4cZLZII107iJg0nv8-o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cLJ1VMNKhsaxBIaggtgP&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=kick%20the%20cat%20syndrome&amp;f=false|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Verbal Self Defense|first=Lillian|last=Glass|p=80|publisher=Penguin|year=1999|isbn=978-1-440-65074-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workplace or family dynamics==
Kicking the cat is commonly used to describe the behaviour of staff abusing coworkers or subordinates as a mechanism to relieve [[Occupational stress|stress]].&lt;ref name="quinn"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/jul/23/careers.theguardian5|title=With colleagues like these|first=Catherine|last=Quinn|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=23 July 2007|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behaviour can result in a [[chain reaction]], where a higher-ranking member of the company abuses his or her subordinate, who takes it out on his or her own subordinate, and so on down the line. This [[domino effect]] can also be seen in family dynamics, where the father yells at the mother who yells at the older child who yells at the younger child who yells at the pet.&lt;ref&gt;Cooney, Beth, [http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1999-05-02/features/9904290688_1_chain-reaction-nuclear-families-emotions Grumpy Ol' Dad], Sun-Sentinel, May 2, 1999. Retrieved 5 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Blaming]] others can lead to kicking the dog where individuals in a [[hierarchy]] blame their immediate subordinate, and this propagates down a hierarchy until the lowest rung (the "dog"). A 2009 experimental study has shown that blaming can be contagious even for uninvolved onlookers.&lt;ref&gt;Jeanna Bryner: [http://livescience.com/culture/blame-contagious-100119.html Workplace Blame Is Contagious and Detrimental], [[LiveScience]], 2010-01-19, citing the January 2010 issue of the ''[[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]]''.'.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological theories==
According to ''Psychology Today'', "Anger and frustration in one part of life can lead us to lash out at innocent people (or pets) in another."&lt;ref name=pt/&gt; The technical term for this kind of behaviour is "displaced aggression".&lt;ref name=pt/&gt;

Kicking the cat is looked upon unfavourably and viewed as a sign of  poor [[anger management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nLm2C_J9A90C&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=%22kick+the+cat%22+business&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NrV1VNC5BbOUsQS7yYKQCg&amp;ved=0CFsQuwUwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kick%20the%20cat%22%20business&amp;f=false|title=Understanding and Training Your Cat or Kitten|first=H.

==Family==

Kittiratt Na-Ranong comes from the [[Khaw na Ranong family]], a prominent [[Thai-Chinese]] family based in southern Thailand. He is a great-great grandson of Khaw Soo Cheang, a Hokkien Chinese immigrant from [[Zhangzhou]] in [[Fujian Province]] who migrated to [[Penang]] in 1810 and then to Thailand in 1822. Soo Cheang established a tin mining and shipping business in Penang and Southern Thailand. He was appointed governor of Ranong province in 1854 and given the princely title of Phraya Na Ranong by the royal family.&lt;ref&gt;https://thethaiger.com/thai-life/phuket-history-recalling-thaimalaysian-legacy&lt;/ref&gt; Soo Cheang's second son, Khaw Sim Kong was the governor of [[Ranong Province]] and the great-grandfather of Kittiratt. Soo Cheang's sixth son, [[Phraya Ratsadanupradit Mahitsaraphakdi]] served as the governor of [[Trang Province]]. The family was granted the "Na Ranong" surname in around 1916 by Rama VI, among the first families to receive one.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&amp;dat=19920211&amp;id=KLBUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NJADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6876,68621&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt; Today, several hundred members of the family use this surname.&lt;ref&gt;Voravudhi Chirasombutti, [http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/acd/re/k-rsc/hss/book/pdf/vol06_05.pdf Some Observations on Migrants’ Acquisition of Thai Family Names], Ritsumei University Japan,&lt;/ref&gt; According to a distant relative, Khaw Teik Gim who serves as the family's historian, Kittiratt's Chinese name is Khaw Cheng Thong.&lt;ref&gt;Wong Chun Wai, [http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Community/2013/09/28/Penangs-History-Mystory-Powerful-ties-that-bind-two-nations/ Powerful ties that bind two nations], 28 September 2013, [[The Star (Malaysia)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''odds compiler''' (or '''trader''') is a person employed by a [[bookmaker]] or [[betting exchange]] who sets the [[odds]] for events (such as [[sports betting|sporting outcomes]]) for customers to place [[gambling|bets]] on. Apart from pricing markets, they also engage in any activity regarding the trading aspects of gambling, such as monitoring customer accounts and the profitability of their operations.

The odds are derived from a variety of factors through analysis of information. Certain markets are highly [[statistics|statistical]], whereas other markets require more intuition and insight. An odds compiler may be required to monitor the financial position the bookmaker is in and adjust their position (and odds) accordingly. They may also be consulted as to whether to accept a bet or not, usually in the case where a very large bet is being placed, so as to not incur dangerously-high liabilities. Odds are usually not set completely independent from other bookmakers but are influenced by what others are quoting. This is particularly important when the overround is below 100% and hence [[arbitrage betting]], where betters can make a profit regardless of the outcome, is possible (see [[mathematics of bookmaking]]). In this case, the bookmaker with the most aberrant odds would usually alter their odds closer to other bookmakers' prices. The odds are influenced by betting volume so that a selection receiving a high volume of liquidity may have the odds for it cut.

In 2006, there were news reports that the only female odds compiler in the United Kingdom was a woman called Helen Jacob of [[Sky Betting and Gaming|Sky Bet]].&lt;ref&gt;McRae, Alex (29 June 2006).

'''Milan Janković''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Милан Јанковић}}, born 23 November 1950 in [[Veliko Gradište]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] now [[Serbia]]), mostly known as '''Philip Zepter''' ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]: Филип Цептер / Filip Zepter) is a [[businessman]] and [[entrepreneur]] of [[Serbs|Serbian]] origin. 

He completed primary school in [[Kozarska Dubica]] before graduating from the [[University of Belgrade]] [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Economics|Faculty of Economics]]. At the age of 29, he went to [[Salzburg]], following his wife [[Madlena Zepter]] (then Madlena Janković) who got a temporary job there and in order to study [[German language|German]], and liked it so much there that he decided to stay.

After he moved to [[Linz]], in 1986 he founded Zepter Handels-GmbH, a multi-level marketing firm for pots and pans, which has over time grown into the [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] [[Zepter International]] which provides “a wide range of products and services, including banking, insurance, telecommunications, and retail sales of consumer products.”&lt;ref&gt;https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-dc-circuit/1505826.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 Zepter sued the [[International Crisis Group]], a think tank cofounded by financier [[George Soros]], media mogul [[Rupert Murdoch]], lawyer [[David Boies]], money manager [[Paul Tudor Jones]], former [[Chase Manhattan Bank]] chief executive [[David Rockefeller]], [[Goldman Sachs]], and [[J.P. Morgan Chase]], for defamation following a 2003 report which described him as "an arms dealer, money launderer and crony of brutal Yugoslav president [[Slobodan Milošević|Slobodan Milosevic]]."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2004/0419/048.html Balkan Battle&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a final dismissal of the suit on the grounds that, "Zepter was a limited-purposed public figure in the post-Milosevic government."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.courthousenews.com/serbian-oligarch-loses-defamation-lawsuit/|title=Serbian Oligarch Loses Defamation Lawsuit|date=2016-05-11|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Serbian press, in 2008 he was interested in buying Serbia's famous football club [[Red Star Belgrade]]. However, he postponed the purchase because he was no longer interested.
In 2011 Philip Zepter joined the ranks of only five non-U.S. citizens who have been awarded the prestigious [[Ellis Island Medal of Honor]].

Zepter lives in the Villa Trianon in Cap Martin.&lt;ref&gt;Hello! Magazine, No. 1074, 2 June 2009, pg. 6-16&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''postvention''' is an [[intervention (counseling)|intervention]] conducted after a [[suicide]], largely taking the form of support for the bereaved (family, friends, professionals and peers). Family and friends of the suicide victim may be at increased risk of suicide themselves. Postvention is a term that was first coined by Shneidman (1972), which he used to describe "appropriate and helpful acts that come after a dire event." In Schneidman's view,  "the largest public health problem is neither the prevention of suicide nor the management of suicide attempts, but the alleviation of the effects of stress in the survivors whose lives are forever altered."&lt;ref&gt;Shneidman E. ''Deaths of man'' New York: Quadrangle Books, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Postvention is a process that has the objective of alleviating the effects of this stress and helping survivors to cope with the loss they have just experienced. 
 
The aim is to support and debrief those affected; and reduce the possibility of [[copycat suicide]]. Interventions recognize that those bereaved by suicide may be vulnerable to suicidal behaviour themselves and may develop complicated [[grief]] reactions.
 
Postvention includes procedures to alleviate the distress of suicidally bereaved individuals, reduce the risk of imitative suicidal behavior, and promote the healthy recovery of the affected community. Postvention can also take many forms depending on the situation in which the suicide takes place. Schools and colleges may include postvention strategies in overall crisis plans. These strategies are designed to prevent suicide clusters and to help students cope with the emotions of loss that follow the suicide of a friend.&lt;ref&gt;Poland S. ''Suicide intervention in the schools'' New York: Guilford, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;  Individual and group [[counseling]] may be offered for survivors (people affected by the suicide of an individual).

==Organizations==
The Suicide Aftercare Association [http://www.suicideaftercare.org], a 501(c)(3) public charity, was formed to reduce the possibility of suicide contagion and secondary suicides by performing biohazardous cleaning of suicide attempt and completion scenes so families are relieved of this burden.

==Programs==

===Responding to Loss (RTL)===

Responding to Loss (RTL) is one of the crisis response programs that has been used to deal with postvention at high schools. This program is part of the Community Action for Youth Survival (CAYS), which is a three-year adolescent suicide prevention project serving three counties in the Chicago area. The objective of RTL is to provide strategies that will help high school crisis teams develop a structured response to the suicide of any student or member of the staff.&lt;ref&gt;Underwood M &amp; Dunne-Maxim K. ''Managing sudden violent loss in the schools'' New Jersey State Department of Education and State Department of Human Services; and University of Medicine and Dentistry at New Jersey, Community Mental Health Center at Piscataway, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; There are three components to this program. The first is Preparing for Crisis Training, the second is Peer Witness Intervention, and the third is Crisis Consultation. This program proved to be quite successful during its trial and the participants of the program were generally satisfied with the training that they received. As a result of this program, several schools have developed or revised their crisis team in response to a suicide. They have done this by following the Preparing for Crisis training aspect of the program and also through consulting with the CAYS program.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, J., Hirsch, J., Goldenberg, D., Libby, S., Fendrich, M., Mackesy-Amiti, M., ... Chance, G. (1995). 'Strategies for school-based response to loss: Proactive training and postvention consultation. ''Crisis'', 16(1), 18-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===LOSS===

The LOSS Program includes a first-response team with the objectives of delivering immediate services to the survivors of a suicide at the time of the death. This team is made up of para-professional survivor volunteers and staff members of the Baton Rouge Crisis Intervention Center, located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The LOSS Program is different from other postvention programs in several ways. First, the LOSS team physically goes to the scenes of the suicides to begin helping the survivors to cope with their loss as close to the event of death as possible. Members of this team can provide access to the needed resources and can begin the grieving process at the scene of the death. Second, since the LOSS team includes survivor volunteers at the scene, an immediate and meaningful bond is established between the newly bereaved individuals and the para-professional surveyor team members. This bond allows for the start of a conversation about the grief and the potential for hope of a suicide between the bereaved and the crisis team members. Third, the LOSS team has a strong relationship with other first responders, such as law enforcement, emergency services, fire departments, funeral home representatives, and more. This relationship allows the newly bereaved to have a larger variety of choices in regards to coping with a suicide compared to other survivors who might not have access to this program. This model of postvention provides referrals for additional support to all survivors and individuals at the scene of the suicide &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, F. R., Cataldie, L., McIntosh, J., &amp; Millet, K. (2004). An active postvention program. ''Crisis'', 25(1), 30-32.&lt;/ref&gt; The model of the LOSS Program has changed the scene of the suicide to a more "concerned and caring environment" for all individuals and survivors.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell FR. Suicide: An American form of abuse. ''New Global Development (XVI)'', 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The five '''Ralli brothers''', '''Zannis''' a.k.a. '''John''' (1785–1859), '''Augustus''' (1792–1878),
'''Pandia''' a.k.a. '''Zeus''' (1793–1865),
'''Toumazis''' (1799–1858), and
'''Eustratios''' (1800–84) founded '''Ralli Brothers''', perhaps the most successful expatriate [[Greeks|Greek]] merchant business of the [[Victorian era]].

Born to a wealthy merchant family of [[Chios]], their father '''Stephanos Ralli''' (1755–1827) had settled in [[Marseille]], but recognised that the nexus of trading had changed in the aftermath of the [[Napoleonic wars]], and sent his eldest son John to [[London]] to explore business opportunities.

==Founding of the Ralli Brothers’ partnership==
John started trading in oriental [[silk]] and Russian [[grain]] in exchange for [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|British textiles]], and fetched his brothers over to help, incorporating as ''Ralli Brothers'' in London. Brother Eustratios ran the textile export operations from [[Manchester]], Toumazis sourced raw materials and grain from [[Odessa]] and [[Constantinople]], Pandia financed it from the [[Baltic Exchange]], and Augustus oversaw the [[Mediterranean]] operations from [[Marseille]].

Their move away from Greece was prescient as it preceded the turmoil that was about to befall the [[Ottoman Empire]] that resulted in the [[Chios massacre]] and subsequent [[Greek diaspora]], and saw their traditional home markets closed.

They were quick to seize new opportunities created by wars, political events, and the opening of new markets, such as corn, cotton, silk, [[opium]] and fruit, rapidly establishing major trading operations across the Mediterranean, Russia, reaching out as far as [[St Petersburg]], [[Taganrog]], [[Tabriz]], [[Alexandria]], [[Smyrna]], and [[Syria]].

Although they employed more than 40,000 people at one time, control rested in the hands of the extended family.  When Pandia married in 1831, it was to Marietta Scaramanga (1810–60), another merchant from Chios, whose family had significant trading operations in Russia.

From 1851 Ralli Brothers started operations in [[British Raj|India]] with offices in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] and [[Mumbai|Bombay]] that specialised in jute, shellac, [[sesame|teelseed]], turmeric, ginger, rice, saltpetre, and borax,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rallis.co.in/aboutus/history.asp Rallis India company website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819205601/http://www.rallis.co.in/aboutus/history.asp |date=19 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with 4,000 clerks and 15,000 warehousemen and dockers.

Their American operations ran from [[New York City]] and [[New Orleans]], in association with their cousin Alexander Vlasto.  They accurately gauged the grain opportunities that arose from the [[Crimean War]], and were early traders in [[Futures exchange#History of futures exchanges|grain futures]].

==Later generations, Ralli Brothers Ltd==
The partnership was dissolved on Pandia's death, but his nephew '''Stephen Augustus Ralli''' (1829–1902) passed the Russian business to the Scaramanga family, and re-constituted ''Ralli Brothers'' on the British, American and Indian operations. On his death it passed in turn to his nephew Sir Lucas Ralli Bt., (1846–1931), who continued the tradition of adroit investment.

They made fortunes by building on the Indian and American businesses, astutely shipping cotton and textiles after the [[American Civil War]] and, from 1882, dealing in opium.  From new offices in [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]] and [[Chennai|Madras]] they dealt in '[[Khandesh]]' groundnuts. When [[World War I]] started, Rallis held the exclusive contract with the British War Department for jute sandbags.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 4 September 1916&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great Depression]] saw the company beset with cashflow problems. This forced the Indian operations to close, and another Greek trading family, Argenti, stepped in to act as their agents.

In late 1960, Sir Isaac Wolfson, of [[Great Universal Stores]], and Harry Recanati, of the [[Israel Discount Bank]], approached the Board of Ralli Brothers. They offered to acquire the whole of its share capital, at a price that was between two and three times higher than the prevailing price, quoted on the London Stock Exchange. At this time, Jack Vlasto was the Company President, having taken over this role in 1950 from Sir Strati Ralli Bt., MC. The approach from Sir Isaac Wolfson was not welcomed by the Company Directors. However, as Ralli Brothers Ltd. was a merchant bank, the matter was referred to the Governor of the Bank of England. His advice was that the offer must be placed before the shareholders, so that they should not be denied the opportunity to sell their shares at a premium. In 1961, the shareholders subsequently voted to accept the offer. This led to Sir Isaac Wolfson taking over control of the commercial operations of the firm, in a deal worth £5.5m, a substantial sum at that time.

The Israel Discount Bank added the international merchant banks of Ralli Brothers to its portfolio of private banks, although Harry Recanati left when the other Directors chose to [[listing (finance)|list]] the banking group publicly on the [[Tel Aviv Stock Exchange]], in 1970. The Israel Discount Bank became insolvent in 1983 and was controversially [[nationalisation|nationalised]] by the Treasury of the Government of Israel. Recanati had retained ownership of the Swiss [[private bank]] of Ralli Brothers (Bankers) S.A. which he later sold to [[Security Pacific Bank]] of [[California]], using the proceeds to found a number of public museums. These Ralli Museums are free, non-profit galleries, of contemporary Latin-American art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://harryrecanati.org/ Harry Recanati]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Sir Godfrey Ralli and his brother, Lucas Ralli, (Major), who had both been on the Board of Ralli Brothers, set up a new venture called G &amp; L Ralli Investment &amp; Trustee Co. Ltd.  The Company was established in August 1962, and shortly afterwards registered as a Trust Corporation. (Source: Evening Standard, 26/9/62). The original capital of the Company was £250,000, consisting of 250K shares of £1. G &amp; L was primarily concerned with the management of trust funds, but soon branched out into general private client portfolio management.  The Company later became a Licensed Dealer in Securities, and was registered as a member of FIMBRA. The mid-1970s, saw Sir Godfrey taking 'early retirement', to pursue country interests. Lucas, the younger brother, subsequently took over as Chairman of the Group, with Mike Kemp promoted to Managing Director, soon thereafter. In 1983, Ralli Investment Company Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary, acquired a Deposit-Taking Licence from the Bank of England. John Ralli, son of Lucas, was a Director of G &amp; L Ralli, from 1986 -1990.

In 1997, G &amp; L Ralli merged with Ely Fund Managers. Ely Fund Managers, the UK private banking business of the Franco-Belgium group, Dexia, in turn, were subsequently absorbed into Rathbones in 2006, for a price of £14.5m.

In 1981 Ralli Brothers was sold to [[Cargill]] Inc. of Minneapolis, a billion dollar company. In 2002 this whole organization became known as Cargill Cotton.

1854-1931, Rallis' sojourn in India was extremely successful until the great economic crash of 1929 led them to close down their
Indian operations. 1948-1963, Rallis India was reborn in a partitioned and independent India. The Company diversified, and its
fertilizer and pesticides businesses began to take shape. 1964-1978, Rallis passed through turbulent times, molting and evolving.
1981-2000, Rallis' future was now firmly enmeshed in the future of Indian agriculture.

By the early nineties, Rallis became the fourth largest seed company in India. Tata Chemicals' fertilizer plant, manufacturing Urea,
was set up. Having identified agri-business as its core strength, Rallis divested its pharmaceutical business, and decided to
consolidate its position in pesticides, fertilizers and seeds.

==Cultural influence==
The Rallis used their establishment in London and elsewhere to help the influx of Greek merchants that emigrated to set up in business and settle into their new countries. Although they maintained their Greek culture and religion, they mostly became assimilated and naturalised subjects in their adopted lands. Pandia had a reputation for fair dealing and avoided questionable deals and finances, and forced his standards on the other Greek émigrés with whom they did business, earning him the nickname of 'Zeus'.

Through their contacts, which included [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]], they rose to prominence in British business and aristocratic circles, with Pandia becoming a leading representative of the Greek Community in London and British [[Consul]] for the newly independent country of Greece, and organised the Greek entry in [[The Great Exhibition]] of 1851.

==Legacy==
[[File:Ralli Hall, Denmark Villas, Hove (July 2010, from East).JPG|thumb|right|[[Ralli Hall]] in [[Hove]] commemorates Stephen Augustus Ralli.]]
Perhaps influenced by their families' own experience, they and their descendants were frequent donors to medical charities operating in Eastern Europe and the Balkan wars. The family initiated the construction of [[Saint Sophia (London)|Saint Sophia Cathedral]], (co-funded by prominent members of the Greek community in London) and Pandia was instrumental in setting up the [[Greek Orthodox]] cemetery within [[West Norwood Cemetery]] in 1842. Antonius commissioned the [[Doric order|Doric]] chapel to St Stephen there from [[John Oldrid Scott]], now [[Listed building|listed Grade II*]]. Some of the family also commissioned architects to create their own significant [[mausoleum]]s there, including:
*Eustratios Ralli, a [[Doric order|Doric]] temple by [[Edward Middleton Barry]] (Grade II)
*Antonios Ralli, a Roman-style temple mausoleum (Grade II)
*John Peter Ralli, a two-storey polychromatic mausoleum by [[George Edmund Street]] in his ''streaky bacon'' style (Grade II*)

[[Ralli Hall]] was built in 1913 in [[Hove]], [[East Sussex]], as the church hall of [[All Saints Church, Hove|All Saints Church]].  It was named in honour of Stephen Augustus Ralli, whose death in 1902 had also been commemorated by the installation of [[stained glass]] windows in the church in 1904.  The hall was sold in 1975 to the Brighton and Hove Jewish Community, who use it for their own activities and make it available for hire to other groups.  The Edwardian Baroque-style building was [[Listed building|listed at Grade II]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="RalliHall"&gt;{{cite book|last=Middleton|first=Judy|title=The Encyclopaedia of Hove &amp; Portslade|year=2002|publisher=Brighton &amp; Hove Libraries|location=Brighton|at=Vol. 11, p.10|nopp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rayon''' is a manufactured [[fiber]] made from regenerated [[cellulose fiber]]. The many types and grades of rayon can imitate the feel and texture of [[natural fiber]]s such as [[silk]], [[wool]], [[cotton]], and [[linen]]. The types that resemble silk are often called [[art silk|artificial silk]]. 

Rayon is made from purified [[cellulose]], primarily from [[dissolving pulp|wood pulp]], which is chemically converted into a soluble compound. It is then dissolved and forced through a [[spinneret (polymers)|spinneret]] to produce filaments which are chemically solidified, resulting in fibers of nearly pure cellulose.&lt;ref name="fibersource"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afma.org/f-tutor/rayon.htm |title=Rayon Fiber (Viscose) |work=afma.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406101953/http://www.afma.org/f-tutor/rayon.htm |archivedate=April 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because rayon is manufactured from naturally occurring [[polymer]]s, it is considered a [[semisynthesis|semisynthetic]] fiber,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1021/ed070p887|bibcode=1993JChEd..70..887K |title=Rayon: the first semi-synthetic fiber product |year= 1993 |last1= Kauffman |first1= George B. |journal= Journal of Chemical Education|volume= 70 |issue= 11 |page= 887}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in precise [[usage]] the term [[synthetic fiber]] is sometimes reserved for [[total synthesis|fully synthetic]] fibers. Specific types of rayon include [[viscose]], [[Modal (textile)|modal]] and [[lyocell]], each of which differs in manufacturing process and properties of the finished product.

==Rayon and its variations==

===Nitrocellulose===
The solubility of [[nitrocellulose]] in [[organic solvents]] such as [[ether]] and [[acetone]] was the basis for the first "[[artificial silk]]" by Georges Audemars in about 1855. Although it is chemically distinct from rayon, cellulose was successfully solubilized albeit with chemical modification.  Commercial production started in 1891, but the result was [[flammable]] and more expensive than cellulose acetate or [[cuprammonium]] rayon. Because of this expense, production ceased early in the 1900s.  Nitrocellulose was briefly known as "mother-in-law silk".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Editors|first = Time-Life|title = Inventive Genius|publisher = Time-Life Books|location = New York|year = 1991|isbn = 0-8094-7699-1|page = 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Hastings Griffin]] invented the double-godet, a special stretch-spinning process that changed artificial silk to rayon, rendering it usable in many industrial products such as tire cords and clothing. Nathan Rosenstein invented the "spunize process" by which he turned rayon from a hard fiber to a fabric. This allowed rayon to become a popular raw material in textiles.

===Acetate ===
Rayon should not be confused with acetate ([[cellulose acetate]]) or [[triacetate]]. These terms have often been used interchangeably in the past but are now distinct. While rayon reconstitutes the natural cellulose polymer, the older acetate process reacts cellulose with [[acetic anhydride]] to form [[cellulose acetate]]. Furthermore, rayon production requires carbon disulfide as a solvent while acetate uses considerably safer solvents such as [[acetone]]. However, rayon is a more robust fiber than the otherwise similar acetate, and has come to dominate.

===Cuprammonium method===
Swiss [[chemist]] [[Matthias Eduard Schweizer]] (1818–1860) discovered that cellulose dissolved in [[Schweizer's reagent|tetraaminecopper dihydroxide]]. [[Max Fremery]] and [[Johann Urban]] developed a method to produce [[Carbon (fiber)|carbon fiber]]s for use in [[light bulb]]s in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090322020858/http://www.industriepark-oberbruch.de/publish/en/location/history/historie.html Over 100 years old and still going strong From Glanzstoff (artificial silk) factory to industry park]. industriepark-oberbruch.de&lt;/ref&gt; Production of [[cuprammonium rayon]] for [[textiles]] started in 1899 in the [[Vereinigte Glanzstoff Fabriken AG]] in [[Oberbruch Industry Park|Oberbruch]] near [[Aachen]].&lt;ref&gt;''Verinigte Glanstoff Fabriken'' merged with the ''Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabrieken'' in 1929 to form the ''Algemene Kunstzijde Unie'', [[AkzoNobel]]'s predecessor&lt;/ref&gt; Improvement by the [[J. P. Bemberg AG]] in 1904 made the artificial silk a product comparable to [[silk|real silk]].&lt;ref name=r7&gt;''J. P. Bemberg AG'' was one of the ''[[Vereinigte Glanzstoff-Fabriken]]'' which merged into the Dutch based ''Algemene Kunstzijde Unie'' (AKU)--[[AkzoNobel]] today&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viscose method===
{{merge from|viscose|discuss=Talk:Viscose#viscose and rayon are not the same|date=July 2017}}
[[File:Viscose Rayon spinning machine.JPG|thumb|right|A device for spinning Viscose Rayon dating from 1901]]
English chemist [[Charles Frederick Cross]] and his collaborators, [[Edward John Bevan]] and Clayton Beadle, patented their artificial silk in 1894. They named their material "[[viscose]]", because its production involved the intermediacy of a highly viscous solution. The process built on the reaction of [[cellulose]] with a strong base, followed by treatment of that solution with [[carbon disulfide]] to give a [[xanthate]] derivative. The xanthate is then converted back to a cellulose fiber in a subsequent step. The first commercial viscose rayon was produced by the U.K. company [[Courtaulds|Courtaulds Fibres]] in 1905. Courtaulds formed an American division, [[American Viscose Corporation|American Viscose]], (later known as Avtex Fibers) to produce their formulation in the United States in 1910.&lt;ref name="Owen2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Owen|title=The Rise and Fall of Great Companies: Courtaulds and the Reshaping of the Man-Made Fibres Industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=coEnAQAAMAAJ|date=9 September 2010|publisher=OUP/Pasold Research Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "rayon" was adopted in 1924, with "viscose" being used for the viscous organic liquid used to make both rayon and [[cellophane]]. In Europe, though, the fabric itself became known as "viscose", which has been ruled an acceptable alternative term for rayon by the U.S. [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC).{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The viscose method can use wood as a source of cellulose, whereas other routes to rayon require lignin-free cellulose as starting material. The use of woody sources of cellulose makes viscose cheaper, so it was used on a larger scale than the other methods. On the other hand, the viscose process affords large amounts of contaminated waste water. Rayon was produced only as a filament fiber until the 1930s, when methods were developed to utilize "broken waste rayon" as [[Staple (textiles)|staple]] fiber.

The physical properties of rayon remain unchanged until the development of high-tenacity rayon in the 1940s. Further research and development led to high-wet-modulus rayon (HWM rayon) in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Kadolph"&gt;{{cite book|title=Textiles |edition=9 |author1=Kadolph, Sara J. |author2=Langford, Anna L. |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-025443-6|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in the UK was centred on the government-funded [[British Rayon Research Association]].

Industrial applications of rayon emerged around 1935. Substituting cotton fiber in tires and belts, industrial types of rayon developed a totally different set of properties, amongst which tensile strength (elasticity)&lt;!-- tensile strength and elasticity are different properties, the author is confused --&gt; was paramount.

===Lyocell===
{{main|Lyocell}}
The [[Lyocell]] process relies on dissolution of cellulose products in a solvent, [[N-Methylmorpholine N-oxide|N-methylmorpholine N-oxide]]. The process starts with woody sources of cellulose and involves dry jet-wet spinning. It was developed at the now defunct American Enka and Courtaulds Fibres. As of 2013, Lenzing's Tencel brand is perhaps the most widely known lyocell fiber producer.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

=== Modal ===
Modal is a type of rayon, a semi-synthetic [[cellulose fiber]] made by [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] reconstituted [[cellulose]], in this case often from [[beech]] trees. Modal is used alone or with other fibers (often cotton or [[spandex]]) in clothing and household items such as pajamas, underwear, bathrobes, towels, and bedsheets. 

Modal is processed under different conditions to produce a fiber that is stronger and more stable when it is wet than standard rayon, yet has a soft feel, similar to cotton. It can be [[Clothes dryer|tumble dried]] without damage due to its increased molecular alignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.undershirts.co.uk/blogs/research/viscose-vs-modal-vs-lyocell|title=Viscose vs. Modal vs. Lyocell - Difference?|work=Robert Owen Undershirts Co|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fabric has been known to [[Pill (textile)|pill]] less than cotton due to fiber properties and lower surface friction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-wash-modal-clothes-2145794|title=How to Wash Modal Clothes|work=The Spruce|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Micro-Modal is a variant of Modal textiles. The material is softer than cotton and has desirable properties that include higher resistance to shrinking and moisture wicking.

==Major fiber properties==
Rayon is a versatile fiber and is widely claimed to have the same comfort properties as natural fibers, although the drape and slipperiness of rayon textiles are often more like nylon. It can imitate the feel and texture of [[silk]], [[wool]], [[cotton]] and [[linen]]. The fibers are easily [[Dyeing|dyed]] in a wide range of colors. Rayon fabrics are soft, smooth, cool, comfortable, and highly absorbent, but they do not insulate body heat, making them ideal for use in hot and humid climates, although also making their "hand" (feel) cool and sometimes almost slimy to the touch.&lt;ref name="LaBat"&gt;{{cite book|title=Classifications &amp; Analysis of Textiles: A Handbook|author1=Karen L. LaBat  |author2=Carol J. Salusso |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=University of Minnesota|year= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The durability and appearance retention of regular viscose rayon are low, especially when wet; also, rayon has the lowest elastic recovery of any fiber. However, HWM rayon (high-wet-modulus rayon) is much stronger and exhibits higher durability and appearance retention. Recommended care for regular viscose rayon is dry-cleaning only. HWM rayon can be machine-washed.&lt;ref name="Kadolph"/&gt;

Rayon industrial yarns outperform polyester and are produced for belts in high performance tires (e.g. Cordenka, Germany).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Physical structure==
Regular rayon has lengthwise lines called [[:wikt:striation|striation]]s and its cross-section is an indented circular shape. The cross-sections of HWM and cupra rayon are rounder. [[wiktionary:filament|Filament]] rayon [[yarn]]s vary from 80 to 980 [[wiktionary:filament|filaments]] per [[yarn]] and vary in size from 40 to 5000 [[Denier (unit)|denier]]. [[Staple (textiles)|Staple fibers]] range from 1.5 to 15 denier and are mechanically or chemically crimped. Rayon fibers are naturally very bright, but the addition of delustering [[pigments]] cuts down on this natural brightness.&lt;ref name="Kadolph"/&gt;

==Production method==
[[File:Cellulose Haworth.svg|thumb|Cellulose]]

''Regular rayon'' (or ''viscose'') is the most widely produced form of rayon. This method of rayon production has been used since the early 1900s and it has the ability to produce either filament or staple fibers. The process is as follows:

===The steps===
#'''''Cellulose.''''' Production begins with processed cellulose (obtained from wood pulp and plant fibers). The cellulose content in the pulp should be around 87% to 95%.
#'''''Immersion.''''' The cellulose is dissolved in [[caustic soda]]:&lt;br&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sub&gt; + {{mvar|n}}NaOH → (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;ONa)&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sub&gt; + {{mvar|n}}H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;br&gt; is the chemical reaction. The reaction converts cellulose to alkali cellulose and removes impurities.
#'''''Pressing.''''' The solution is then pressed between rollers to remove excess liquid. The pressing is done in accordance with the press-weight ratio. Press weight ratio is the ratio between the pressed alkali cellulose sheet weight to the weight of air dried pulp. It is adjusted to 2.7-3.&lt;ref&gt;VB Gupta, VK Kothari, AK Sengupta, MANUFACTURED FIBRE TECHNOLOGY, published in 1997 by chapman &amp; hall, London.{{rp|484}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''''"White Crumb."''''' The pressed sheets are crumbled or shredded to produce what is known as "white crumb."
#'''''Ageing.''''' The "white crumb" is aged through exposure to [[oxygen]]. This is a depolymerization step and is avoided in case of polynosics.
#'''''"Xanthation."''''' The aged "white crumb" is mixed with [[carbon disulfide]] in a process known as "Xanthation," in which the aged alkali cellulose crumbs are placed in vats and are allowed to react with carbon disulfide under controlled temperature (20 to 30&amp;nbsp;°C) to form cellulose xanthate:
#:(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;ONa)&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sub&gt; + {{mvar|n}}CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&amp;minus;SC&amp;minus;SNa)&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;is the reaction.
#'''''"Orange-Yellow Crumb."''''' The Xanthation changes the chemical makeup of the cellulose mixture, and the resulting product is now called "yellow crumb." This orange coloration is due to the formation  of sodium trithiocarbonate (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;.VB Gupta, VK Kothari, AK Sengupta, MANUFACTURED FIBRE TECHNOLOGY, published in 1997 by chapman &amp; hall, London{{rp|485}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''''Viscose.''''' The "yellow crumb" is dissolved in a caustic solution to form viscose.
#'''''Ripening.''''' The viscose is set to stand for a period of time, allowing it to ripen:
#:(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&amp;minus;SC&amp;minus;SNa)&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sub&gt; + {{mvar|n}}H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sub&gt; + {{mvar|n}}CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + {{mvar|n}}NaOH&lt;br&gt; is the reaction.
#'''''Filtering.''''' After ripening, the viscose is filtered to remove any undissolved particles.
#'''''Degassing.''''' Any bubbles of air are pressed from the viscose in a degassing process.
#'''''Extruding.''''' The viscose solution is extruded through a [[Spinneret (polymers)|spinneret]], which resembles a shower head with many small holes.
#'''''Acid Bath.''''' As the viscose exits the spinneret, it lands in a bath of [[sulfuric acid]], resulting in the formation of rayon filaments. The acid is used as a regenerating agent. It converts cellulose xanthate back to cellulose. The regeneration step is rapid which doesn't allow proper orientation of cellulose molecules. So to delay the process of regeneration, zinc sulphate is used in the bath which converts cellulose xanthate to zinc cellulose xanthate thus providing time for proper orientation to take place before regeneration.  
#:(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&amp;minus;SC&amp;minus;SNa)&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sub&gt; + {{sfrac|1|2}}{{mvar|n}}H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sub&gt; + {{mvar|n}}CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + {{sfrac|1|2}}{{mvar|n}}Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt; is the reaction.&lt;ref&gt;VB Gupta, VK Kothari, AK Sengupta, MANUFACTURED FIBRE TECHNOLOGY, published in 1997 by chapman &amp; hall, London.{{rp|487}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''''Spinning.''''' The spinning of viscose rayon fibre is done using wet spinning process. The filaments are allowed to pass through a coagulation bath after extrusion from the spinneret holes. Two-way mass transfer takes place.
#'''''Drawing.''''' The rayon filaments are stretched, in a procedure known as drawing, to straighten out the fibers.
#'''''Washing.''''' The fibers are then washed to remove any residual chemicals from them.
#'''''Cutting.''''' If filament fibers are desired, then the process ends here. The filaments are cut down when producing staple fibers.&lt;ref name="fibersource"/&gt;

''High wet modulus rayon (HWM)'' is a modified version of viscose that has a greater strength when wet. It also has the ability to be [[mercerized]] like cotton. HWM rayons are also known as "polynosic." Polynosic fibers are dimensionally stable, and do not shrink or get pulled out of shape when wet like many rayons. They are also wear resistant and strong while maintaining a soft, silky feel. They are sometimes identified by the trade name [[Modal (textile)|Modal]].&lt;ref name="Ohio"&gt;Joyce A. Smith. [https://web.archive.org/web/20100331124255/http://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-fact/5000/5538.html Rayon – The Multi-Faceted Fiber]. Ohio State University Rayon Fact Sheet&lt;/ref&gt;

''High-tenacity rayon'' is another modified version of viscose that has almost twice the strength of HWM. This type of rayon is typically used for industrial purposes such as tire cord.&lt;ref name="Ohio"/&gt;

''Cuprammonium rayon'' has properties similar to viscose; however, during its production, the cellulose is combined with [[copper]] and [[ammonia]] ([[Schweizer's reagent]]). Due to the detrimental environmental effects of this production method, cuprammonium rayon is no longer produced in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Ohio"/&gt;

==Manufacturing health hazards==
''See also [[Viscose#Pollution and harm to workers]]''

Highly toxic [[carbon disulfide]] is used in the production of viscose, leading to many incidents and legal cases.&lt;ref name=court&gt;Supreme Court of Alabama. [https://caselaw.findlaw.com/al-supreme-court/1023084.html COURTAULDS FIBERS, INC. v. Horace L. LONG, Jr., et al.&lt;br&gt; Horace L. Long, Jr., et al. v. Courtaulds Fibers, Inc.]
1971996 and 1972028.&lt;br&gt;Decided: September 15, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; However, the volatile carbon disulfide is lost before the rayon gets to the consumer; the rayon itself is basically pure cellulose.&lt;ref name=blancbook/&gt; Studies from the 1930s show that 30% of American rayon workers suffered severe effects. Rates of disability in modern factories (mainly in China, Indonesia and India) are unknown.&lt;ref name="Monosson"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1126/science.aak9834|title=Toxic textiles|year= 2016 |last1= Monosson |first1= Emily |journal= Science|volume= 354|issue= 6315 |page=977|bibcode= 2016Sci...354..977M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scientificamerican.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=bamboo-boom|title=Bamboo Boom: Is This Material for You?|author=Michelle Nijhuis|work=Scientific American}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disposal and biodegradability==
{{see also|Microplastics}}
The biodegradability of various fibers in soil burial and sewage sludge was evaluated by Korean researchers. Rayon was found to be more biodegradable than cotton, and cotton more than acetate. The more water-repellent the rayon-based fabric, the more slowly it will decompose.&lt;ref name="biodegrade1"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/app.20879|title=Biodegradability of cellulose fabrics|year=2004|last1=Park|first1=Chung Hee|last2=Kang|first2=Yun Kyung|last3=Im|first3=Seung Soon|journal=Journal of Applied Polymer Science|volume=94|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silverfish]] can eat rayon.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} 

A recent ocean survey found that rayon contributed to 56.9% of the total fibers found in [[deep sea|deep ocean]] areas, the rest being [[polyester]], [[polyamides]], [[acetate]] and [[acrylic fiber|acrylic]].&lt;ref name="biodegrade2"&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/12/141216212253.htm Abundance of microplastics in the world's deep seas] (2014-12-16). Retrieved on 2014-12-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative to cotton==
Rising cotton prices in 2010 led clothing makers to begin replacing [[cotton]] with rayon in their fabrics. As demand for rayon increases, companies such as [[Fortress Paper]] have been investing in [[pulp mill]]s to increase production. Rayon now sells for as much as $2.70 per pound, which has led to an increase in the retail price of clothing made with rayon, yet rayon has a price advantage over cotton.&lt;ref&gt;Wirz, Matt (January 7, 2011) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703730704576066291209981236 "The Touch, The Feel – Of Rayon,"] ''Wall Street Journal'', Money and Investment section, p. c1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mislabelling===
''See also [[Bamboo textile]]''

In 2010, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission issued letters informing over 100 companies that they were mislabeling products made of rayon  as being made from [[bamboo]], deceiving environmentally conscious consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Lipka |first=Mitch |date=2010-02-03 |url= https://www.aol.com/2010/02/03/bamboo-zled-ftc-says-retailers-fibbed-about-bamboo-product-clai/ |title= Bamboo-zled: FTC Says Retailers Fibbed about Bamboo Product Claims |publisher=AOL.com |accessdate=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the FTC filed complaints against Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Nordstrom, J.C. Penney, Backcountry.com, and their subsidiaries, for continuing to deceptively sell rayon mislabeled as bamboo. The four companies were required to pay civil penalties totaling {{USD|1.3 million}} for violating the "Textile Act and the Textile Rules" and Section 5(m)(1)(B) of the FTC Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2015-12-09 |url= https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2015/12/nordstrom-bed-bath-beyond-backcountrycom-jc-penney-pay-penalties |title= Nordstrom, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Backcountry.com, and J.C.

===Impact on U.S. textile industry===
Rayon contributed partly to the decline of the US [[textile industry]] in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="edexcel"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Waugh |first1=Steve |authorlink1=Steve Waugh |last2=Wright |first2=John  |date=2009 |title=The USA 1919-1941, GCSE Modern World History for Edexcel |publisher=Hodder Education |page=24 |isbn=978-0-340-98441-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is far cheaper to produce than wool, cotton, or silk. It also requires less processing and hence fewer workers.  In addition, it was 50% cheaper than silk during the 1920s in the US.&lt;ref name="edexcel"/&gt;  Then, it was used initially for men's socks but later for [[lingerie]] and women's [[stockings]].&lt;ref name="edexcel"/&gt;

==Producers==
[[Trade name]]s are used within the rayon industry to label the type of rayon in the product. Viscose Rayon was first produced in Coventry England in 1905 by Courtaulds.

''Bemberg'' is a trade name for [[cuprammonium rayon|cupramonium rayon]] developed by [[Bemberg|J. P. Bemberg]]. Bemberg performs much like viscose but has a smaller diameter and comes closest to silk in feel. Bemberg is no longer produced in [[Italy]], but is still produced in Japan, due to [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] regulations in the US. The fibers are finer than viscose rayon.&lt;ref name=r7/&gt;

''[[Modal (textile)|Modal]]'' and ''[[Tencel]]'' are widely used forms of rayon produced by [[Lenzing AG]]. Tencel, generic name ''lyocell'', is made by a slightly different solvent recovery process, and is considered a different fiber by the US FTC. Tencel lyocell was first produced commercially by [[Courtaulds, Grimsby|Courtaulds' Grimsby plant]] in England. The process, which dissolves cellulose without a chemical reaction, was developed by Courtaulds Research.

[[AkzoNobel#Fibres|Accordis]] was a major manufacturer of cellulose based fibers and yarns. Production facilities can be found throughout Europe, the U.S. and [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090923204603/http://www.colbond.us/history.htm Colbond History]. colbond.us. Acordis was a spinoff by [[AkzoNobel]] in 2000 after it had acquired [[Courtaulds]].  It was through [[AkzoNobel]]'s original parent company's, the ''Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabriek'' (ENKA), joint venture with ''Rento Hofstede Crull'' 's ''De Vijf'', named ''De Internationale Spinpot Exploitatie Maatschappij'' (''ISEM'') that the commercial production of rayon was made viable.  Hofstede Crull had supplied the solution for the problem of manufacturing rayon with his ''Driving Device For A Centrifugal Spinning Machine'' in 1925 (1931 {{US Patent|1798312}}).  The ''ISEM'' was fully integrated with the ''Algemene Kunstzijde Unie'', the Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabriek's successor, with the death of Hofstede Crull in 1938.

''Visil rayon'' is a [[flame retardant]] form of viscose which has [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] embedded in the fiber during manufacturing.

[[North American Rayon Corporation]] of [[Tennessee]] produced viscose rayon until its closure in the year 2000.&lt;ref name="Tennessee encyclopedia"&gt;"[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=1005 North American Rayon Corporation and American Bemberg Corporation]" in the Tennessee Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;North American Rayon Corporation of Tennessee was an American subsidiary of ''J. P. Bemburg A.G.'' which was part of the ''Vereinigte Glanstoff Fabriken'' that were absorbed into the Dutch ''AKU'', [[AkzoNobel]] today&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grasim]] of [[India]] is the largest producer of rayon in the world (claiming 24% market share). It has plants in [[Nagda]], [[Kharach]] and [[Harihar]] – all in India, as well as joint ventures in Canada, Laos and China.&lt;ref name="Grasim"&gt;[http://www.grasim.com/products/birla_viscose.htm Grasim].

'''TAP Express''' (TAP standing for Transportes Aéreos Portugueses) is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[regional airline]] brand name for [[TAP Air Portugal]] which operates short and medium-haul routes.  TAP Air Portugal's lone wholly owned regional airline, [[Portugália Airlines]], operates under the '''TAP Express''' banner. [[White Airways]], an airline owned by [[Omni Aviation]], also operates regular flights for TAP Express using 9 [[ATR 72]] turboprops. Its head office is on the grounds of [[Lisbon Portela Airport]] in [[Lisbon]].

== History ==
On 14 January 2016, TAP Portugal announced that '''Portugália''', its regional subsidiary, would be rebranded as '''TAP Express''' as of 27 March 2016,&lt;ref name="rebranding" /&gt; as part of the restructuring measures within the group, even though the company still operates as a wholly owned company of TAP Air Portugal. [[Mainline (flight)|Mainline]] carriers often use regional airlines to operate services in order to increase frequency, serve routes that would not sustain larger aircraft, or for other competitive reasons.

Also on 14 January 2016, TAP Air Portugal also announced that the entire Portugália fleet consisting of [[Fokker 100]] and [[Embraer ERJ-145]] would be replaced by July 2016 with new [[Embraer 190]] and [[ATR 72-600]] aircraft (the latter operated by [[White Airways]]) which will receive a livery similar to that of TAP Portugal.&lt;ref name="rebranding"&gt;[http://atwonline.com/finance-data/tap-portugal-creates-tap-express-replace-portugalia atwonline.com - TAP Portugal creates TAP Express to replace Portugalia] 15 Januar 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tell Magazine''''' is a weekly magazine published in [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tellng.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=72&amp;Itemid=128&amp;limitstart=1|title=About Us - The Company|work=Tell Magazine|accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[BBC News]] described it as "one of Nigeria's most respected business magazines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6445125.stm|title=Firms struggle in crumbling Nigeria |author= |date=19 March 2007 |work= |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==
''Tell'' magazine published its first edition on 15 April 1991. All five of the founding editors had worked at ''[[Newswatch (Nigeria)|Newswatch]]'', where they learned to create in-depth, investigative feature stories. They left that magazine due to low pay and disagreements with senior management, hoping that the new magazine would be more fulfilling. Although the magazine's founders had high ambitions, they were not initially hostile to the government. However, they were determined to be free of government or political influence.&lt;ref name=Olukotun2004/&gt;

==Babangida era==
The magazine questioned whether General [[Ibrahim Babangida]] was sincere in saying he would hand over to a civilian government. 
The 2 May 1993 edition with headline "Transition: 21 Traps against handover" was seized, and had to be reprinted in tabloid format. Two more major seizures occurred before Babangida was forced from power in August 1993.&lt;ref name=Olukotun2004/&gt;
In all, 500,000 copies were seized in the last four months of Babangida's rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 |publisher=Africa World Press |year=1997|ISBN=0-86543-551-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tell's circulation rose to as many as 100,000 copies each week in the build-up to the June 1993 presidential election and in the subsequent confusion.
Facing harassment from security forces, the magazine began printing underground in July 1993.
On 15 August 1993 police raided the offices and arrested editor-in-chief [[Nosa Igiebor (journalist)|Nosa Igiebor]] and editors Kola Ilori, Onome Osifo-Whiskey and  Ayodele Akinkuoto. holding them for 12 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Conditions became more difficult after General [[Sani Abacha]] took power in November 1993.
On 2 January 1994 armed policemen and security officers seized 50,000 copies of the magazine at the printer's premises. The issue was titled "The Return of Tyranny - Abacha bares his fangs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The editors resorted to guerrilla tactics to survive, forming cells and frequently moving, with the magazine printed covertly in different locations. They relied on help from civilians, who supported the magazine by providing office space, buying copies and helping in many other ways.&lt;ref name=Olukotun2004/&gt;

After the newspaper published a story that revealed that Abacha was suffering from cirrhosis of the liver, police and military raided Igiebor's house while he was away. His wife was maltreated when she said she did not know where he was. A soldier pointed a gun at his four-year-old daughter, threatening to shoot if Igiebor was not produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Igiebor was jailed for six months from late 1995 to 1996, and later fled abroad to escape the threat of assassination.  Osifo-Whiskey also spent six months in detention, arrested after a year in which he avoided his own house and stayed with friends, one of whom was killed.&lt;ref name=Olukotun2004/&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
In 1993, the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] presented Igiebor its [[CPJ International Press Freedom Awards|International Press Freedom Award]], "an annual recognition of courageous journalism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpj.org/awards/ |title=CPJ International Press Freedom Awards 2011 |year=2011 |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his work with the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpj.org/attacks96/frontmatter/ipfa.html |title=Journalists Receive 1996 Press Freedom Awards |year=1996 |publisher=[[Committee to Protect Journalists]] |accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Nosa Igiebor and the staff as a whole were awarded the [[Special Award for Human Rights Journalism Under Threat]] at the [[Amnesty International UK Media Awards]].&lt;ref name="1998 Amnesty Media Awards 001"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/news/awards/1998.html |title=Amnesty International UK (AIUK) Media Awards 1998 |accessdate=2017-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010513170831/http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news/awards/1998.html |archivedate=May 13, 2001 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The award's notice stated; "Tell has continued to publish throughout the period of Nigerian dictatorship despite intimidation, harassment and the detention without charge or trial of Mr Igiebor and other senior members of the Tell staff."&lt;ref name="1998 Amnesty Media Awards 002"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/news/awards/1998.html |title=Amnesty International UK (AIUK) Media Awards 1998 - Winners - Short-list - Judges |accessdate=2017-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DkDDNDx9?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20010513170831/http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news/awards/1998.html |archivedate=January 17, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tori Richard''' is a [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]-based [[company]] which produces men's and women's resort wear. In its nearly 60-year history, the Tori Richard line has gone from exclusively women's [[fashion]]s (featured in ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]], [[Harper's Bazaar|Harper’s Bazaar]], [[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]], [[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]], [[Town &amp; Country (magazine)|Town &amp; Country]], [[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' and other national publications)&lt;ref name="Fujii2006a"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 22–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to a line of upscale [[Resort wear|resort apparel]], including sport shirts, [[Aloha shirt]]s, tropical dresses, [[swimwear]], separates, [[handbag]]s, interior accents and a range of fashion and lifestyle accessories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tori Richard resort wear targets those who enjoy art, [[travel]] and a casually upscale lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The collections are introduced biannually in showrooms on the east and west coasts.

Founder Mort Feldman, an avid collector of Japanese [[antiques]] and screens, translated his passion into the [[East–West dichotomy|East-West]] fabric prints that remain the Tori Richard signature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Textile print as an art form still defines the brand, as do fabrication, construction and attention to detail.

[[CEO]] Josh Feldman, Mort Feldman's son, leads the locally owned [[family business]] as it approaches its 60th year.&lt;ref name="themohs"&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Meyers | first = Aviva | title = Tori Richard | url = http://www.themohs.org/Tori_Richard.html | publisher =  | year = 2009 | accessdate = 5 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In two generations, the company has gone from designing primarily women's wear to becoming an international brand. Through its 10 retail stores, website and 2,500 wholesale accounts, Tori Richard is sold in all [[United states|50 states]], [[Mexico]], [[Puerto rico|Puerto Rico]], [[Guam]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Australia]] and [[Caribbean Sea|the Caribbean]].&lt;ref name="the.honoluluadvertiser"&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Rath | first = Paula | title = Flashback | url = http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2006/Apr/26/il/FP604260302.html | publisher = Honolulu Advertiser | date = 26 April 2006 | accessdate = 6 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The newest Tori Richard concept stores, primarily women's stores, are in Honolulu's Kahala Hotel &amp; Resort and Mashpee Cape Cod, Massachusetts. More than 80 percent of Tori Richard sales are [[Continental United States#Hawaii|U.S. mainland-driven]].&lt;ref name="hawaiibusiness"&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Ro | first = Lisa | title = Patterns of Success | url = http://www.hawaiibusiness.com/Hawaii-Business/July-2006/Patterns-of-Success/ | publisher = Hawaii Business | date = July 2006 | accessdate = 12 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prints==

[[File:Tori Richard Store in Waikiki.png|thumb|Tori Richard Store in Waikiki]]As many as 100 hours may be required to conceive, design and colorize the design and make each new design printable.&lt;ref name="Fujii2006"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 44 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tori Richard gathers concept art year-round from company artists, [[studio]]s, art collections, trade shows, retail outlets and private collections throughout [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and the [[United states|U.S.]]&lt;ref name="Fujii2006" /&gt; An in-house art and design team at the Honolulu [[headquarters]] expands on the concepts to create original Tori Richard resort prints.&lt;ref name="hawaiibusiness" /&gt; They adhere to specific criteria in design, color and placement, aiming for proportion, visual balance, and originality of the final design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When finalized, each TR print is copyrighted, named, and remains the exclusive property of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 43 }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 400 new prints are added annually to the TR archive, now numbering at least 25,000 designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 42, 64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tori Richard Truck.png|thumb|Tori Richard Truck]]Vital to each print is the number of color screens required.&lt;ref name="Fujii2006" /&gt; Printing a design on silk may require up to 22 screens, and for [[viscose]], 17. Patterns are repeated every 24 to 30 inches, while in the larger “engineered” prints, a single image can take up an entire 60-inch panel.&lt;ref name="Fujii2006" /&gt; Designs range from tightly patterned images to broad, painterly, artistic motifs in both printed and, in the men's Hawaiian shirts, embroidered images. Various visual elements—palette, proportion, mood, message, soft or hard edges—affect the image selection and final print design.

The motifs range from bold geometric prints to botanical, nature-inspired and lifestyle-inspired images. Past designs of Tori Richard's apparel include images of maps, ocean sports, Kiplingesque animals and abstract designs, as well as crisp paisleys and tapa motifs in various fabrications. Variations of popular designs from past collections are sometimes brought back by popular demand. From the beginning, the Japanese aesthetic—stylized waves, water, cranes, fans, chrysanthemum petals, bamboo, textures and brushstrokes—has been prominent in the line.&lt;ref name="themohs" /&gt;

Tori Richard has recently released its vintage-inspired 56 series, with its own signature themes, fabrications and a more tapered cut. Emblematic of 56 is the cotton, treated for the vintage-washed effect aimed towards the younger demographic. The Tori Richard line also includes seasonal themes in high-end fabrics, with embroidered, engineered designs in heavyweight silks.

Tori Richard pioneered the matched [[pocket]]s and fronts, now an industry standard. This feature matches the print so there is no interruption in design at the pocket or front seams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 54 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fabrications and Styles==
Tori Richard fabrics include [[silk]]s, silk blends, [[Pima cotton]], cotton blends, [[linen]] and linen blends, [[tencel|Tencel©]], cotton jacquard and spun viscose, as well as a fine proprietary Egyptian cotton called cotton lawn, giving a finish exclusive to Tori Richard.&lt;ref name="the.honoluluadvertiser" /&gt;&lt;ref name="the.honoluluadvertiser_a"&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Rath | first = Paula | title = Resort Style | url = http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2009/Aug/07/il/hawaii908070318.html | publisher = Honolulu Advertiser | date = 7 August 2009 | accessdate = 6 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; High-end silks, such as silk jacquard, also appear in single, bold embroidered patterns comprising the more luxurious end of the men's line. Some of the fabrics are made in Japan, unusual among retailers today.

==Details and Workmanship==
The details of a Tori Richard shirt include laser-etched [[Mother of pearl|mother-of-pearl]] [[Button (clothing)|button]]s, French [[Seam (sewing)|seams]] (raw edges turned in, sewn and invisible), matched pockets, and [[Collar (clothing)|collars]] with interlining, an extra layer of fabric fused to the inside of the collar to add crispness and prevent droop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's Fashion==
[[File:The Tori Richard store in the Hilton Hawaiian Village.png|thumb|The exterior of the Tori Richard store in the Hilton Hawaiian Village, Waikiki, Honolulu, Hawaii]]Tori Richard's women's line includes dresses, [[capris]], tops, [[tunic]]s, peplum tanks, beach cover-ups, [[sarong]]-style and asymmetrical skirts, as well as shorts and modernized caftans in black, exotic prints and casual geometrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 87 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Colors are inspired by the dunes of Marrakech, the deserts of Africa, autumn in the northeast, nature and deep ocean. The women's resort wear goes from day to evening and from beach to dinner, casual to elegant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 86–87 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Styles range from off-shoulder, one-shoulder, strapless and spaghetti-strap dresses to skinny, shirred and dolman-sleeved tops paired with skinny pants in all lengths and contemporary cuts.

Fabrics include cotton, cotton [[crape|crepe]], [[rayon]], [[jersey knit]] blends, cotton-spandex [[Piqué (weaving)|piqué]], and silk and silk blends, selected for drape, comfort and versatility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Rath | first = Paula | title = Fashion News | url = http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2009/May/15/il/hawaii905150325.html | date = 15 May 2009| accessdate = 16 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prints for the women's line range from tapa-inspired tribal prints, botanical motifs, abstract geometricals and art-inspired motifs for a global resort market.&lt;ref name="the.honoluluadvertiser_a" /&gt;

==History==
While known for its resort wear and Hawaiian shirts, Tori Richard got its beginnings in women's wear.&lt;ref name="the.honoluluadvertiser_b"&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Nakaso | first = Dan | title = Mortimer Feldman | url = http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2009/Aug/16/ln/hawaii908160318.html | publisher = Honolulu Advertiser | date = 16 August 2009 | accessdate = 6 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Founder Mort Feldman, an apparel manufacturer from Chicago, flew to the Territory of Hawaii in 1953 on [[Pan American Airways|Pan American's]] [[China Clipper]], intending to retire.&lt;ref name="the.honoluluadvertiser_b" /&gt;   He established the company in 1956.&lt;ref name="the.honoluluadvertiser_b" /&gt;   With partners Janice Moody, formerly a sportswear designer for Catalina, and Mitsue Aka, Moody's pattern maker, he formed Tori Richard with one sewing machine and practically no capital.&lt;ref name="the.honoluluadvertiser_b" /&gt;  They named the company after Victoria (Tori, Moody's daughter) and Richard, Feldman's oldest son.&lt;ref name="the.honoluluadvertiser" /&gt;

Their first office, at Pier 7 in Honolulu, was known to have floorboards that became damp from the tide rising in [[Honolulu harbor|Honolulu Harbor]].&lt;ref name="the.honoluluadvertiser" /&gt;  Among its early offices were a [[Quonset hut]] and the historic [[Primo Brewing &amp; Malting Company|Primo Brewery]], damaged by fire in 1973 and rebuilt to remain the company headquarters for 17 more years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Gordon | first = Mike | title = Mort Feldman of Tori Richard | url = http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2004/Nov/12/ln/ln59p.html | publisher = Honolulu Advertiser | date = 12 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after its 1956 launch, Tori Richard became nationally known for the unfussy [[Silhouettes#Fashion and fitness|silhouettes]], bright colors and dramatic prints of the dresses, culottes, beachwear, caftans and lounge wear of its high-fashion resort women's line, made largely of imported European fabrics at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Offices in key mainland markets—[[New York (state)|New York]], [[California]], [[Florida]], [[Dallas]] and [[Chicago]]—attracted attention from high-end retailers, such as Saks Fifth Avenue, Lord &amp; Taylor, Bergdorf Goodman, Gimbel's, I. Magnin, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Best &amp; Co. and Marshall Field.&lt;ref name="Fujii2006a" /&gt;

[[File:The interior of the Tori Richard store in the Hyatt Regency Waikiki.png|thumb|The interior of the Tori Richard store in the Hyatt Regency Waikiki]]In the 1960s and ‘70s, [[Fifth avenue#Shopping|Fifth Avenue]] windows and top national fashion magazines featured Tori Richard in features and ads, many of them photographed on location in Hawaii.&lt;ref name="Fujii2006b"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the leisure life was the zeitgeist of the era, the Tori Richard fashions—tunics, harem pants, hostess sets, shifts, caftans, culottes, sarong swimsuits and Capri pants—catered to the cocktail, beach and patio parties that were popular at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The esthetics—streamlined and dramatic—departed from the tropical “aloha wear” for which Hawaii was known.&lt;ref name="Fujii2006b" /&gt;  Customers ranged from [[Lucille ball|Lucille Ball]] to the [[List of rulers of Morocco|King of Morocco]] to department store customers across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fujii | first1 = Jocelyn K. | title = Tori Richard: The First Fifty Years | year = 2006 | publisher = Tori Richard | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | isbn = 978-0-9785466-0-1 | pages = 20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Mort Feldman and a fellow Hawaii fashion executive, Howard Hope, lobbied the [[Hawaii Legislature|Hawaii State Legislature]] to establish “Aloha Friday” as a state-sanctioned island practice.&lt;ref name="themohs" /&gt;  The effort succeeded, and businesses throughout the state wear aloha attire on Fridays, and, increasingly, on the other days of the week.

The company grew during the boom years of Hawaii [[tourism]]. From the early 1960s, soon after [[Hawaii statehood|statehood]] in 1959 and the introduction of jet travel to Hawaii, fashion emerged as the third largest export of the state, with Tori Richard as one of the biggest fashion exporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last =  | first =  | title = Hawaii's Glamour Garments | journal = Beacon | volume =  | issue = April | year = 1962 | pages = 8  | postscript =  &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In the 1980s, menswear eclipsed women's wear in the Tori Richard line.&lt;ref name="the.honoluluadvertiser" /&gt;  In 1983, Mort Feldman retired to New Zealand, to return to the U. S. three years later. His son, Josh, a graduate of [[Punahou School]] and the [[UC San Diego|University of California at San Diego]], with a degree in art and a degree in political science, dropped his ambitions for [[law school]] and joined Tori Richard in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Kam | first = Nadine | title = Tori Five-O: The clothing company Tori Richard recaptures its storied early success | publisher = Honolulu Star-Bulletin | date = 5 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the younger Feldman's leadership, the company grew by over 600 percent.&lt;ref name="Fujii2006c" /&gt;

Upon his return in 1994, Josh Feldman managed the print and product division of the company. He re-introduced the engineered print to the product line in 1995 and redoubled efforts to identify Tori Richard as a print house.&lt;ref name="the.honoluluadvertiser" /&gt;

In 2002, the women's line was relaunched, and a year later, the first Tori Richard retail store opened at the [[Hyatt|Hyatt Regency Waikīkī]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = One To Watch: Tori Richard's new womenswear designer brings a fresh feel to the iconic island brand | url = http://www.honolulumagazine.com/Honolulu-Shops-Waikiki/June-2012/One-To-Watch/ | publisher = Honolulu Magazine | date = June 2012 | accessdate = 6 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today there are Tori Richard shops at [[Ala Moana Center]], The Shops at Wailea, [[Royal Hawaiian Hotel]], [[Hilton Hawaiian Village]] and Whaler's Village in Ka‘anapali.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Tori Richard | first =  | title = Find A Store | url = http://www.toririchard.com/page.cfm/LOCATIONS.html | publisher = Tori Richard | date =  | accessdate = 8 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The year 2006 saw the company's 50th anniversary and was also the year Tori Richard received the “Resort Retailer of the Year” award from Retail Merchants Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Advertiser Staff | first =  | title = Jeans Warehouse wins Retailer of Year | url = http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2006/Oct/28/bz/FP610280329.html | publisher = Honolulu Advertiser | date = 28 October 2006 | accessdate = 6 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2012, the readers of the ''[[Honolulu Star-Advertiser]]'' voted Tori Richard “Best of the Best” in the aloha shirt category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Hawaii's Best 2012 | url = http://www.staradvertiser.com/specialprojects/2012/hawaiisbest2012/hawaiisbest2012.html?id=171852751 | publisher = Honolulu Star-Advertiser | date = 24 June 2012 | accessdate = 6 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
The company recently received film credit for creating [[George clooney|George Clooney's]] shirts in “[[The Descendants]],” the [[84th Academy Awards|2012 Academy Award]] winner for “Best Adapted Screenplay.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Zimmerman | first = Malia | title = The Obama Snub That Has Everyone Talking | url = http://www.hawaiireporter.com/celebrities-alex-oloughlin-and-george-clooney-wear-tori-richard-alohawear-but-president-obama-snubs-the-companys-shirt-made-exclusively-for-21-world-leaders-at-apec/123 | publisher = Hawaii Reporter | date = 14 November 2011 | accessdate = 7 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Working with costume designer Wendy Chuck, CEO Josh Feldman and his team provided George Clooney's shirts for many of the movie scenes.

Tori Richard also provides shirts for [[Alex O'Loughlin|Alex O’Loughlin]] (Steve McGarrett) and [[Daniel Dae Kim]] (Chin Ho Kelly) in “[[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0]],” as it did for [[Jack Lord|Jack Lord's]] Steve McGarrett in the original television series from 1968 to 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Magin | first = Janis L. | title = Island businesses ride 'Hawaii Five-0's' promotional wave | url = http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/blog/2012/03/island-businesses-ride-hawaii.html | publisher = Pacific Business News | date = 20 March 2012 | accessdate = 7 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musicians, such as [[Sammy Hagar]] and, [[Jimmy Buffett]], have worn Tori Richard shirts in their performances, and some artists have worn them on their [[album cover]]s.

Tori Richard designed the signature shirts for the more than 2,000 volunteers and staff of the [[Apec|Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)]], spearheaded by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] in Honolulu in November 2011.&lt;ref name="bizjournals"&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Magin | first = Janis L. | title = Tori Richard CEO: APEC shirts were 'expensive gamble' | url = http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/blog/2011/11/tori-richard-ceo-apec-shirts-were.html?page=all | publisher = Pacific Business News | date = 14 November 2011 | accessdate = 6 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tori Richard also designed and created an exclusive [[aloha shirt]] for Obama and the 21 world leaders in attendance, an effort that required an original design, special limited print run, custom labeling and hand-sewing in Hawaii.&lt;ref name="bizjournals" /&gt;  The shirt was given to the delegation but was never worn at the official gathering.&lt;ref name="bizjournals" /&gt;

==Company Environmental Conservation Efforts==
In 2008, the company installed a $1.1-million, 154-[[Kilowatt#Kilowatt|kilowatt]] system at its corporate headquarters and warehouses in Honolulu, becoming one of the world's first [[Photovoltaic system|solar-powered]] manufacturers and retailers.&lt;ref name="the.honoluluadvertiser_c"&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Advertiser Staff and News Services | first =  | title = Tori Richard goes photovoltaic | url = http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2008/Oct/29/bz/hawaii810290395.html | publisher = Honolulu Advertiser | date = 29 October 2008 | accessdate = 6 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The system meets 94 percent of the company's electricity needs in its Honolulu headquarters.&lt;ref name="the.honoluluadvertiser_c" /&gt;   In 2011, the company installed an additional 105 KWH system on an adjacent property, effectively offsetting 100% of its [[carbon footprint]].

'''''Woman's World''''' (also known as '''''A Woman's World''''') is a 1954 [[Technicolor]] [[drama film]] about corporate America. Three men compete for the top job at a large company.

==Plot==
When the general manager of Gifford Motors dies, company owner Ernest Gifford ([[Clifton Webb]]) invites the three candidates for the position to [[New York City]] so he can personally evaluate them and their wives. Bill and Katie Baxter ([[Cornel Wilde]] and [[June Allyson]]) are a loving couple from [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]. Elizabeth Burns ([[Lauren Bacall]]) is becoming estranged from her driven husband Sidney ([[Fred MacMurray]]) because his work is consuming him and undermining his health; she fears a promotion would eventually kill him. Jerry Talbot ([[Van Heflin]]), who has a sexy, ambitious wife, Carol ([[Arlene Dahl]]), rounds out the trio.

As time goes by, Katie is shown to be a bit of a [[Accident-proneness|klutz]], both physically and socially. On the other hand, Elizabeth is both poised and gracious. Despite their differences, she and Katie get along well. When the couples are unexpectedly invited to spend the weekend at the estate of Gifford's sister Evelyn Andrews, ([[Margalo Gillmore]]), Elizabeth generously helps Katie buy appropriate clothing on a limited budget. 

Meanwhile, Carol does her best to "help" her husband by playing up to a seemingly appreciative Gifford at every opportunity, despite Jerry's demands that she stop interfering. It becomes clear to Gifford that the best candidate and the most suitable wife are unfortunately not married to each other. He announces that he will reveal his decision after dinner. Carol makes one last brazen attempt to influence his choice and is surprised to learn that, while Jerry is Gifford's favorite, he will not get the job because of a fatal handicap. When she informs her husband and also how she helped him in the past, Jerry proves that he got at least one big promotion on his own merits, not because of her charms. He then says to her that they are through and tells her to pack and leave. When Gifford finds out, he is pleased. He had hoped that Jerry would see his wife for what she was. Gifford congratulates his new general manager for passing the test. The other two couples are relieved.
