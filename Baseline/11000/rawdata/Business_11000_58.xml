The '''Alabama International Trade Center''' was created in 1979 as one of the first ''international SBDCs''.  Since its inception, the AITC has provided export trade research, education, finance, and training throughout [[Alabama]].  

==History &amp; Personnel==

Dr. William R. Bennett, Emeritus Professor of Marketing and International Business at [[the University of Alabama]], founded the Trade Center in 1979.  AITC was one of the first university-based small business development centers in the country that focused specifically on international trade.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asbdc-us.org/About_Us/aboutus_history.html ASBDC History&lt;/ref&gt;  Following Dr. Bennett's retirement in 1983, Ms. Nisa Miranda, who had helped Bennett establish the Center while completing her MBA, was promoted to Director.  Miranda would oversee the Center's growth and development for the next 21 years, helping the Center become designated as SBA's State Model of Excellence in International Trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aitc.ua.edu/aitc-history Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sba.gov/advo/models.pdf SBA Office of Advocacy]&lt;/ref&gt; (Miranda has since moved on to become Director of the University of Alabama's Center for Economic Development.

In 2004, Mr. Brian Davis, who had served as the Trade Center's Associate Director since 1985, took over as Director.  Davis is the former president of the Alabama World Trade Association (AWTA) and [[NASBITE International]].  In addition to serving on the University's Advisory Board for International Business, Davis also teaches an import-export class at the Culverhouse College of Commerce &amp; Business Administration.

AITC currently employs several consultants:
*Michael J. Brooks, Assistant Director - Research &amp; Training
*Carolyn Turner, International Trade Specialist
*Pablo Diaz, Export Trade Consultant
*Deborah van der Toorn, Export Trade Consultant
*Amber Summers, Project Accountant
*Karla Jordan, Administrative Assistant

In addition to the professional staff, AITC employs up to 20 Research Fellows as part of its research staff.  The Research Fellows are hired on a competitive basis, and consist of graduate and undergraduate students with expertise in market research, business strategy, foreign relations, political science, and foreign languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aitc.ua.edu/student-success Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;  Mr. Brooks has been in charge of hiring and training the research staff since 1998; Brooks also serves as the Center's Senior International Trade Specialist.

The Trade Center is part of the Alabama Small Business Development Center Network, a statewide network of 10 management and technical assistance centers.

The '''Small Business Administration''' ('''SBA''') is a United States government agency that provides support to small businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sba.gov/aboutsba/index.html Small Business Administration]&lt;/ref&gt; The SBA was created by way of the '''Small Business Act''' of July 30, 1953.

==Export Alabama Trade Alliance==

The Alabama International Trade Center is a founding member of the Export Alabama Trade Alliance.  Export Alabama is a group of government agencies, business and professional associations, and economic development entities in Alabama that share the fundamental goal of helping Alabama companies to grow their business internationally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://exportalabama.com/ Export Alabama]&lt;/ref&gt; The list of Export Alabama partners includes:

*Alabama Development Office
*Alabama International Trade Center
*Alabama State Port Authority
*Alabama World Trade Association (AWTA)
*Birmingham Regional Chamber of Commerce
*Madison County Commission, International Trade Development Center
*Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce
*North Alabama International Trade Association
*Port of Huntsville
*US Chamber of Commerce
*US Department of Commerce, Birmingham &amp; Tallahassee Offices

As part of the Export Alabama team, AITC provides input that helps drive the Governor's Annual Trade Strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ado.alabama.gov/content/media/publications/trade/2007_ExportAlabamaTradeStrategy.pdf |title=Governor's Trade Strategy |access-date=2008-06-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120144159/http://www.ado.alabama.gov/content/media/publications/trade/2007_ExportAlabamaTradeStrategy.pdf |archive-date=2008-11-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anti Video Piracy Association of Singapore''' (AVPAS) is a copy protection consortium with other anime producers founded by [[Odex]] on 30 July 2003. The association lists over 400 titles (as of 25 May 2007) and is supported by at least one governmental agency. AVPAS is not a governmental agency by itself. It aims to monitor and combat the unauthorized distribution of video related rights, in particular anime and Japanese-related Intellectual Property. The website technically is being maintained by NetroAsia. Its main committee members are Dr. Toh See Kiat (AVPAS president), Go Wei Ho Peter (AVPAS vice president and Odex director), Sing Xin Yang (AVPAS secretary and Odex director) and Yong Yet Yuen (AVPAS Secretary).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.avpas.com.sg/AVPAS_Member.html |title=AVPAS Members |publisher=AVPAS.com.sg |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920220901/http://www.avpas.com.sg/AVPAS_Member.html |archivedate=2010-09-20 |accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avpas.com.sg/members.html "Members"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722185137/http://www.avpas.com.sg/members.html |date=22 July 2012 }}. AVPAS. Retrieved 28 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation, along with Odex, gained considerable prominence in mid-2007 due to [[Odex's actions against file sharing|Odex's legal actions against Internet users]] in Singapore, which were ultimately rejected by the Court in January 2008.

==Efforts in tackling video infringement in Singapore==
Up to date, the AVPAS has only been known to have created a website which features the Odex Clarification Article on their homepage, has pictures of bootlegged anime and Japanese video CDs and contains a list of authorised titles.

According to the "Odex Clarification Article" on the AVPAS website, the AVPAS has also been said to have authorised Odex to carry out demands of money from anime downloaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.avpas.com.sg |title=Odex Clarification Article |publisher=Odex, avpas.com.sg |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008190228/http://www.avpas.com.sg/Index.html |archivedate=2007-10-08 |quote=Odex is authorised by the Anti-Video Piracy Association (Singapore) (AVPAS), a non-profit organisation whose members consist primarily of Japanese companies involved in the anime industry...|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the AVPAS has not publicly announced its authorisation and has not commented on whether this claim by Odex is true or false.{{when|date=November 2012}}

==Controversy==
The title "AVPAS" may mislead people into believing that AVPAS is a government organization or an organization registered with the Registry of Societies (ROS). The AVPAS is also not a commercial entity by itself (not registered with ACRA) but is registered by NETROASIA PTE LTD, the "technical admin" for ODEX.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Netizens virtually unanimously agree that they did not even know about the existence of AVPAS before the Odex Saga.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The domain name for the AVPAS website was registered in April 2007, three months before Odex started the saga in July to September 2007.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

About its sudden prominence in mid-2007, which coincided with Odex's rise to notoriety among Netizens, there have been concerns raised regarding the legitimacy and purpose of AVPAS, especially since its main committee is dominated by the Odex directors.&lt;ref&gt;Liang, Chen (12 September 2007). [http://www.straitstimes.com/ST%2BForum/Online%2BStory/STIStory_157007.html "Whose interests is Avpas really serving?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309023853/http://www.straitstimes.com/ST+Forum/Online+Story/STIStory_157007.html |date=9 March 2008 }}. ''[[Straits Times]]''. Retrieved 28 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The AVPAS website appears to have ceased from being updated since 31 August 2007, which is coincidentally the beginning of the period when the Odex Saga started to blow over in mainstream media.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Despite being self-dubbed the Anti Video Piracy Association of Singapore, the AVPAS does not seem to be interested in monitoring or combating the copyright violation of non-anime or non-Japanese films as the only titles listed or displayed on its website are either anime or Japanese video titles.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} No publicly known action has been taken by the AVPAS against file sharers dabbling in non-anime and non-Japanese videos.

Their responsibility is to ensure that payments to employees are correct, their vacation pay arrives on time and they receive proper care if they are injured while working.

In [[banking]], a branch manager is responsible for all functions and staff within the [[branch (banking)|branch office]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nshp.org/jobfair/job/2427 Branch Manager job description, JP Morgan Chase Bank], nshp.org. Retrieved on 2007  June.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''corporate promoter''' is a firm or person who does the preliminary work incidental to the formation of a company, including its [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]], [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]], and [[Initial public offering|flotation]], and solicits people to invest money in the company, usually when it is being formed. An [[investment banker]], an [[underwriter]], or a [[stock promoter]] may, wholly or in part, perform the role of a promoter. Promoters generally owe a duty of utmost good faith, so as to not mislead any potential investors, and disclose all material facts about the company's business.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Erlanger v New Sombrero Phosphate Co]]'' (1878) 3 App Cas 1218&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiduciary duties==
Generally, promoters are in a [[fiduciary relationship]] with the company and its [[investor]]s and  [[shareholder]]s, and must avoid [[conflicts of interest]]s and exercise reasonable care in performing their duties. They must refrain from self-dealing or other types of abuse to take advantage of their position as a promoter.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Self-dealing occurs, for example, when a promoter unfairly profits from the conduct of business with the company by charging higher prices for the goods they sell to the company than it would otherwise pay.

A promoter can be a shareholder in the promoted company. If the promoter is the only shareholder, the company may, in compliance with the rule of the [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and similar rules in other jurisdictions, need to disclose the information prior to selling shares to the public.

The fiduciary duties of promoters include:

* not to make any secret profit out of the promotion of the company. Secret profit is made by entering into a transaction on their own behalf and then selling the concerned property to the company at a profit, without disclosing the profit to the company or its members. Pomoters can make profits in dealings with the company, provided they discloses these profits to the company and its members.
* to make full disclosure to the company of all relevant facts, including any profit made by them in transactions with the company.

If a promoter fails to disclose the profits, made by him in the course of promotion or he knowingly makes a false statement in the prospectus, whereby the person relying on that statement, makes a loss, he will be liable to make good the loss, suffered by that other person. The promoter is liable for untrue statements, made in the prospectus.

A person, who subscribes for any shares or debenture in a company on the faith of the untrue statement contained in the prospectus, can sue the promoter for the loss or damages, sustained by the subscriber as the result of such untrue statement.

==Types of promoters==
Promoters may be classified into the following types.

===Professional promoters===
There are firms which specialise in company promotion, including its incorporation and flotation, before handing it over to the shareholders or their representatives for the company.

===Occasional promoters===
These promoters take interest in floating some companies. They are not engaged in promotion work on a regular basis. They take up the promotion of some company and once it is over they go to their original profession.For instance, engineers, lawyers etc. may float some companies.

===Entrepreneur promoters===
They are both promoters and entrepreneurs. They conceive the idea of a new business unit, do the groundwork to establish it and may subsequently become a part of the management.

===Financial promoters===
Some financial institutions, like investment banks or industrial banks, may take up the promotion of a company with a view to finding opportunities for investment.

==Functions of promoters==
The functions of a promoter may include:

===Discovery of a business idea===
The first stage in company promotion is the generation of new ideas. It is the promoter who conceives the idea of setting up a business, and makes an assessment of the viability of a particular aspects business be it technical feasibility ,financial feasibility ,economic feasibility and also incorporation of company .

===Detailed investigation===
Promoters undertakes a detailed investigation of the viability, profitability and future prospects of the growth of the proposed activity, and may seek the help of specialists such as lawyers, accountants, cost accountants, a company secretary, and engineers. Organisations engaged in market research and other specialised agencies. Specialists are in a position to make an objective analysis of their own areas which may help the promoters. Decisions have to be taken regarding the size, location, layout, manpower etc.

===Assembling the factors of production===
If the proposed endeavour gives promise of success and the promoter is willing to undertake the risk of forming the business, step must be taken to assemble various factors of production, such as land, labour, capital and managerial personnel. Assembly of resources involves making contracts for the purchase of these resources.promoters organise the resources to convert the idea into a reality by forming a company.

===Entering into preliminary contracts===
The promoter may enter into contracts with third parties in anticipation of the registration of a company; but after registration, the company must approve or confirm these contracts.

[[File:CRISP-DM Process Diagram.png|thumb|right|Process diagram showing the relationship between the different phases of CRISP-DM]]
'''Cross-industry standard process for data mining''', known as '''CRISP-DM''',&lt;ref name=Shearer00&gt;Shearer C., ''The CRISP-DM model: the new blueprint for data mining'', J Data Warehousing (2000); 5:13—22.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[open standard]] process model that describes common approaches used by [[data mining]] experts. It is the most widely-used [[analytics]] model.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/metabrown/2015/07/29/what-it-needs-to-know-about-the-data-mining-process/#2065f3a3515f What IT Needs To Know About The Data Mining Process] Published by Forbes, 29 July 2015, retrieved June 24, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2015, IBM corporation released a new methodology called ''Analytics Solutions Unified Method for Data Mining/Predictive Analytics''&lt;ref&gt;[https://developer.ibm.com/predictiveanalytics/2015/10/16/have-you-seen-asum-dm/ Have you seen ASUM-DM?], By Jason Haffar, 16 October 2015, SPSS Predictive Analytics, IBM{{Dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/software/data/sw-library/services/ASUM.pdf Analytics Solutions Unified Method - Implementations with Agile principles] Published by IBM, 1 March 2016, retrieved October 5, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as ASUM-DM) which refines and extends CRISP-DM. 

==History==

CRISP-DM was conceived in 1996 and became a European Union project under the [[European Strategic Program on Research in Information Technology|ESPRIT]] funding initiative in 1997.  The project was led by five companies: [[Integral Solutions Ltd (ISL)]], [[Teradata]], [[Daimler AG]], [[NCR Corporation]] and [[OHRA]], an insurance company.

This core consortium brought different experiences to the project: ISL, later acquired and merged into SPSS. The computer giant NCR Corporation produced the Teradata [[data warehouse]] and its own data mining software. Daimler-Benz had a significant data mining team. OHRA was just starting to explore the potential use of data mining.

The first version of the methodology was presented at the 4th CRISP-DM SIG Workshop in Brussels in March 1999,&lt;ref name=crispDMbrussels&gt;Pete Chapman (1999); [http://lyle.smu.edu/~mhd/8331f03/crisp.pdf ''The CRISP-DM User Guide''].&lt;/ref&gt; and published as a step-by-step data mining guide later that year.&lt;ref name=crispDMguide&gt;Pete Chapman, Julian Clinton, Randy Kerber, Thomas Khabaza, Thomas Reinartz, Colin Shearer, and Rüdiger Wirth (2000); [ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/software/analytics/spss/support/Modeler/Documentation/14/UserManual/CRISP-DM.pdf ''CRISP-DM 1.0 Step-by-step data mining guides''].&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2006 and 2008 a CRISP-DM 2.0 SIG was formed and there were discussions about updating the CRISP-DM process model.&lt;ref name="Marban"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shearer"&gt;Colin Shearer (2006); [http://www.kdnuggets.com/news/2006/n19/4i.html ''First CRISP-DM 2.0 Workshop Held'']&lt;/ref&gt; The current status of these efforts is not known.  However, the original crisp-dm.org website cited in the reviews,&lt;ref name="kurgan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AzevedoSantos"/&gt; and the CRISP-DM 2.0 SIG website&lt;ref name="Marban"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shearer"/&gt; are both no longer active.

While many non-IBM data mining practitioners use CRISP-DM,&lt;ref name="KDnug2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KDnug2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KDnug2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marban"/&gt; IBM is the primary corporation that currently embraces{{peacock-inline|date=April 2018}} the CRISP-DM process model. It makes some of the old CRISP-DM documents available for download&lt;ref name="crispDMguide"/&gt; and it has incorporated it into its [[SPSS Modeler]] product.

Based on current research CRISP-DM is the most widely used form of data-mining model because of its various advantages which solved the existing problems in the data mining industries. Some of the drawbacks of this model is that it does not perform project management activities. The fact behind the success of CRISP-DM is that it is industry, tool, and application neutral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mariscal,G.,Marban,O.,Fernandez,C.||title=A Survey of Data Mining and knowledge discovery process Models and methodologies|url=http://doi.org/10.1017/S0269888910000032|accessdate=30 April 2018|publisher=The Knowledge Engineering Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major phases==
CRISP-DM breaks the process of [[data mining]] into six major phases.&lt;ref name="Harper06"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Harper | first = Gavin |author2=Stephen D. Pickett |date=August 2006 | title = Methods for mining HTS data | journal = [[Drug Discovery Today]] | volume = 11 | issue=15–16 | pages = 694–699 | url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T64-4KDJSRH-4&amp;_user=793840&amp;_coverDate=08%2F31%2F2006&amp;_rdoc=4&amp;_fmt=full&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_srch=doc-info(%23toc%235020%232006%23999889984%23627946%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&amp;_cdi=5020&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=17&amp;_acct=C000043460&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=793840&amp;md5=f7f5b2376172e12b63177a32b03de111 |doi=10.1016/j.drudis.2006.06.006 | pmid = 16846796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequence of the phases is not strict and moving back and forth between different phases as it is always required. The arrows in the process diagram indicate the most important and frequent dependencies between phases.  The outer circle in the diagram symbolizes the cyclic nature of data mining itself. A data mining process continues after a solution has been deployed. The lessons learned during the process can trigger new, often more focused business questions, and subsequent data mining processes will benefit from the experiences of previous ones.

==Polls==
Polls conducted at the same website (KDNuggets) in 2002, 2004, 2007 and 2014 show that it was the leading methodology used by industry data miners who decided to respond to the survey.&lt;ref name="KDnug2002"&gt;Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro (2002); [http://www.kdnuggets.com/polls/2002/methodology.htm ''KDnuggets Methodology Poll'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KDnug2004"&gt;Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro (2004); [http://www.kdnuggets.com/polls/2004/data_mining_methodology.htm ''KDnuggets Methodology Poll'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KDnug2007"&gt;Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro (2007); [http://www.kdnuggets.com/polls/2007/data_mining_methodology.htm ''KDnuggets Methodology Poll'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KDnug2014"&gt;Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro (2014); [http://www.kdnuggets.com/polls/2014/analytics-data-mining-data-science-methodology.html ''KDnuggets Methodology Poll'']&lt;/ref&gt; The only other data mining approach named in these polls was [[SEMMA]]. However, SAS Institute clearly states that SEMMA is not a data mining methodology, but rather a "logical organization of the functional toolset of SAS Enterprise Miner." A review and critique of data mining process models in 2009 called the CRISP-DM the "de facto standard for developing data mining and knowledge discovery projects."&lt;ref name="Marban"&gt;Óscar Marbán, Gonzalo Mariscal and Javier Segovia (2009); [http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/5937/InTech-A_data_mining_amp_knowledge_discovery_process_model.pdf ''A Data Mining &amp; Knowledge Discovery Process Model'']. In Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery in Real Life Applications, Book edited by: Julio Ponce and Adem Karahoca, {{ISBN|978-3-902613-53-0}}, pp. 438–453, February 2009, I-Tech, Vienna, Austria.&lt;/ref&gt; Other reviews of CRISP-DM and data mining process models include Kurgan and Musilek's 2006 review,&lt;ref name="kurgan"&gt;Lukasz Kurgan and Petr Musilek (2006); [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=451120 ''A survey of Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining process models'']. The Knowledge Engineering Review. Volume 21 Issue 1, March 2006, pp 1–24, Cambridge University Press, New York, NY, USA doi: 10.1017/S0269888906000737.&lt;/ref&gt; and Azevedo and Santos' 2008 comparison of CRISP-DM and SEMMA.&lt;ref name="AzevedoSantos"&gt;Azevedo, A. and Santos, M. F. (2008); [http://recipp.ipp.pt/bitstream/10400.22/136/3/KDD-CRISP-SEMMA.pdf KDD, SEMMA and CRISP-DM: a parallel overview]. In Proceedings of the IADIS European Conference on Data Mining 2008, pp 182–185.&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to update the methodology started in 2006, but have {{as of|2015|06|30}} not led to a new version, and the "Special Interest Group" (SIG) responsible along with the website has long disappeared (see [[#History|History of CRISP-DM]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17040">The term '''"Crown servant"''' is used to denote a "person employed by the Crown".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tpv2alpha/alpha-fra.html?lang=fra&amp;i=&amp;index=alt&amp;srchtxt=CROWN%20SERVANT |title=Crown Servant |website=Termium Plus - The Government of Canada’s terminology and linguistic data bank.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term is not consistently defined, generally speaking the term encompasses all [[Minister of the Crown|executive officials]] and their staffs, [[civil servants]], [[police]], [[judiciary|judicial officials]], and members of the [[armed forces]]. While the term is used in other Commonwealth countries such as [[Canada]], it has the most predominant use and is the most well-defined with the [[United Kingdom]].

==Crown servant vs civil servant==
{{quote|There is no meaningful legal definition of a civil servant. The [[Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010]] following the Tomlin Commission on the Civil Service unhelpfully refers to "the civil service of the State".|John Alder, ''Constitutional and Administrative Law''&lt;ref name=Alder&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alder|first1=John|title=Constitutional and Administrative Law|date=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137050007|pages=326–327|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qwAdBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA327&amp;ots=qfSDSQHqz1&amp;dq=crown%20servant%20definition&amp;pg=PA326#v=onepage&amp;q=crown%20servant%20definition&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The terms [[civil servant]] and Crown servant can coincide but are sometimes exclusive. It is suggested that the phrase "civil servant" may include every person who serves the Crown, with the exception of members of the [[British Armed Forces|armed forces of the United Kingdom]], the [[British Government frontbench|Ministers of the Crown]] and the [[judiciaries of the United Kingdom]]. However, members of the armed forces are nonetheless Crown servants.&lt;ref name=Alder /&gt;

==Employment rights==
Crown servants serve "at the pleasure of the Crown", and do not therefore benefit from the protections normally available to employees by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carroll|first1=Alex|title=Constitutional and Administrative Law|date=2007|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=9781405812313|page=267|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TViGFDOkFRoC&amp;lpg=PA269&amp;ots=gyEB_FuHV1&amp;dq=crown%20servant%20definition&amp;pg=PA267#v=onepage&amp;q=crown%20servant%20definition&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority of these protections are applied to them by the [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]]. For the purposes of the Act, "crown employment" means employment "under or for the purposes of a government department or any officer or body exercising on behalf of the Crown functions conferred by an enactment", though members of the armed forces are excluded from this provision, and the government has the ability to exclude other Crown servants "for the purpose of safeguarding national security".&lt;ref&gt;{{Halsbury|39|Employment|893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official Secrets Act 1989==
Section 12(1) of the [[Official Secrets Act 1989]] defines the expression "Crown servant" for the purposes of that Act. It now provides:

{{Blockquote|In this Act "Crown servant" means -
:(a) a [[Minister of the Crown]];
:[(aa) a member of the [[Scottish Executive]] or a [[junior Scottish Minister]];]
:[(ab) the [[First Minister for Wales]], a [[Welsh Minister]] appointed under section 48 of the Government of Wales Act 2006, the [[Counsel General to the Welsh Assembly Government]] or a [[Deputy Welsh Minister]];]
:(b) . . .
:(c) any person employed in the civil service of the Crown, including [[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service]], [[Her Majesty's Overseas Civil Service]], the civil service of Northern Ireland and the [[Northern Ireland Court Service]];
:(d) any member of the naval, military or air forces of the Crown, including any person employed by an association established for the purposes of [Part XI of the [[Reserve Forces Act 1996]]];
:(e) any [[constable]] and any other person employed or appointed in or for the purposes of any police force [(including the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] and the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland Reserve]])][or of the [[Serious Organised Crime Agency]]];
:(f) any person who is a member or employee of a prescribed body or a body of a prescribed class and either is prescribed for the purposes of this paragraph or belongs to a prescribed class of members or employees of any such body;
:(g) any person who is the holder of a prescribed office or who is an employee of such a holder and either is prescribed for the purposes of this paragraph or belongs to a prescribed class of such employees.}}

Paragraph (aa) was inserted on 6 May 1999 by section 125 of, and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/46/schedule/8/paragraph/26 paragraph 26(2)] of the Schedule to, the [[Scotland Act 1998]].

Paragraph (ab) was inserted by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/32/schedule/10/paragraph/34 paragraph 34] of Schedule 10 to the [[Government of Wales Act 2006]].

[[Image:Graph 02 spending per country.jpg|thumb|Spending allocation per country.]]
[[Image:Who benefits from the ESF?.jpg|thumb|Spending by demographics.]]

The '''European Social Fund''' ('''ESF''') is the [[European Union]]'s main financial instrument for supporting employment in the [[member states of the European Union]] as well as promoting economic and social cohesion. ESF spending amounts to around 10% of the EU's total budget.

The ESF is one of the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), which are dedicated to improving social cohesion and economic well-being across the regions of the Union. The funds are redistributive financial instruments that support cohesion within Europe by concentrating spending on the less-developed regions.

The particular aim of ESF spending is to support the creation of more and better jobs in the EU, which it does by co-funding national, regional and local projects that improve the levels of employment, the quality of jobs, and the inclusiveness of the labour market in the member states and their regions.

==History==
The European Social Fund was created in the founding [[Treaty of Rome]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="brine25"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brine|first1=Jacky|title=The European Social Fund and the EU: Flexibility, Growth, Stability|date=2002|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press|location=London|isbn=9781841271286|oclc=59470598|page=25|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DNPKDxTBnDQC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=European+Social+Fund+1957&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KYT-SFBtja&amp;sig=un7Do0qUP9E8CxpYHY7O7YHJFcM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi637DzopzPAhVjKMAKHYXkBZ4Q6AEIODAE#v=onepage&amp;q=European%20Social%20Fund%201957&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the oldest of the [[Structural Funds]]. It was established as a "remedial instrument" against the end of nationalist protectionism due to the advent of the [[European Economic Community]].&lt;ref name="munzitheeuropeansocialfund"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Munzi|first1=Ugo|title=The European Social Fund in the Development of the Mediterranean Regions of the EEC|journal=Journal of International Affairs|date=1965|volume=19|issue=2|pages=286–296|jstor=24363303|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, the main goal is to foster employment, reduce social exclusion and invest in skills.&lt;ref name="govukeuropeansocialfund"&gt;{{cite web|title=England 2014 to 2020 European Structural and Investment Funds|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/england-2014-to-2020-european-structural-and-investment-funds|website=Government of the United Kingdom|accessdate=September 19, 2016|date=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some EU countries it also supports administrative reform.

==The place of the ESF in EU policies and strategies==
The overarching strategy of the European Union is the [[Europe 2020]] strategy, which aims to promote "smart, sustainable, inclusive growth" with greater coordination of national and European policies. In 2010 this succeeded the [[Lisbon Agenda]] which aimed to make Europe the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion, and respect for the environment, by 2010. The objectives of Europe 2020 shape the priorities of the ESF.

In the light of the need to increase competitiveness and employment against a background of [[globalisation]] and ageing populations, the European Employment Strategy&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=101&amp;langId=en European Employment Strategy] retrieved on 2008-10-14&lt;/ref&gt; provides a coordinating framework for the Member States to agree common priorities and goals in the field of employment. These common priorities are then taken up in the Employment Guidelines&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=108&amp;langId=en Employment Guidelines] retrieved on 2008-10-12&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporated into the National Reform Programmes&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/making-it-happen/country-specific-recommendations/2015/index_en.htm] National Reform Programmes retrieved on 2016-07-13&lt;/ref&gt; prepared by the individual Member States. ESF funding is deployed by the Member States in support of their National Reform Programmes as well as their National Strategic Reference Frameworks (NSRF) which establish a member state's main priorities for spending the EU Structural Funds it receives.

The European Social Agenda&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=547&amp;langId=en Social Agenda] retrieved on 2008-10-12&lt;/ref&gt; also plays a role in shaping the priorities of ESF spending. The Social Agenda seeks to update the '[[European social model]]' by modernising labour markets and social protection systems so that workers and businesses can benefit from the opportunities created by international competition, technological advances and changing population patterns while protecting the most vulnerable in society. In addition, the concept of '[[flexicurity]]' contributes to current ESF initiatives. [[Flexicurity]] can be defined as a policy strategy to enhance the flexibility of labour markets, work organisations and labour relations, on the one hand, and employment security and income security on the other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=102&amp;langId=en Flexicurity] retrieved on 2008-10-16&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[flexicurity]] encompasses a new approach to employment involving 'work for life' rather than the 'job for life' model of the past. It encourages workers to take charge of their working lives through lifelong training, adapting to change and mobility.

==Strategy definition==
The ESF is managed through seven-year programming cycles. The ESF strategy and budget is negotiated between the [[EU member states]], the [[European Parliament]] and the [[EU Commission]]. The strategy defines the objectives of ESF funding, which it shares partly or wholly with other structural funding. For the current ESF funding cycle these objectives are:
{{ordered list|type=none
| ''The regional competitiveness and employment objective'': to reinforce regional competitiveness, employment and attractiveness for investment.
| ''The convergence objective'': to stimulate growth and employment in the least-developed regions. This objective receives more than 80% of total ESF funding.
}}
The strategy also lays down broad priority axes – the actions required to achieve the objectives and which are eligible for funding.

==Funds allocation==
The level of ESF funding differs from one region to another depending on their relative wealth. EU regions are divided into four categories of eligible regions, based on their regional GDP per capita compared to the EU average (EU with 25 or 15 Member States) and split between the two objectives.

Convergence objective includes:
* convergence regions: with a GDP per capita of less than 75% of the EU-25 average; 
* phasing-out regions: with a GDP per capita of more than 75% of the EU-25 average but less than 75% of the EU-15 average.

The regional competitiveness and employment objective includes:
* phasing-in regions: with a GDP per capita of less than 75% of the EU-15 average (in the period 2000–2006) but more than 75% of the EU-15 average (in the period 2007–2013); 
* competitiveness and employment regions: applies to all other EU regions.

In convergence regions, ESF co-financing of projects can reach 85% of total costs. In regional competitiveness and employment regions, 50% co-financing is more common. For the richer Member States and regions, ESF funding complements existing national employment initiatives; for less-wealthy Member States, ESF funding can be the main source of funds for employment-related initiatives. The eligible regions for the current ESF programming round (2007–2013) are shown on the map.

While the allocation of funds to poorer regions intends to work towards the objective of convergence between regions (i.e. inter-regional equality), research has suggested that the funds may amplify intra-regional inequalities with for example in Poland richer municipalities receiving more funds than poorer municipalities within the regions. One explanation may lie in the co-financing procedures with poorer potential applicants being less likely to gather the required co-funding. Another issue with allocation has been that project applications have been rejected purely on minor administrative issues. While this has improved over time, research has shown that information provision and familiarity with application procedures is still a barrier in submitting applications for funds, and may play a larger role in than outright corruption in the selection process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dubois &amp; Fattore|first=HFW|date=26 July 2011|title=Public fund assignment through project evaluation|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13597566.2011.578827#abstract|journal=Regional and Federal Studies|doi=10.1080/13597566.2011.578827|pmid=|access-date=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
While strategy definition is done at EU level, implementation of ESF funding is the responsibility of EU Member States and regions. Once the strategy and budget allocation have been agreed, a shared approach to programming is taken. Seven-year Operational Programmes are planned by Member States and their regions together with the European Commission. These Operational Programmes describe the fields of activity that will be funded, which can be geographical or thematic.

The Member States designate national ESF management authorities that are responsible for selecting projects, disbursing funds, and evaluating the progress and results of projects. Certification and auditing authorities are also appointed to monitor and ensure compliance of expenditure to the ESF regulation.

Until 2007, approximately 5% of ESF funds were allocated to 'Community Initiatives' to support [[transnationality|transnational]] and innovative actions. They have addressed such issues as employment for women (NOW), disabled people (INTEGRA) and young people, new professions and qualifications (EUROFORM) and adaptability (ADAPT). The most recent of these, the [[EQUAL Community Initiative]], saw in the admission of 10 new Member States in 2004 but ended in 2008.

==ESF projects==
The implementation of the ESF on the ground is achieved through projects which are applied for and implemented by a wide range of organisations, both in the public and private sector. These include national, regional and local authorities, educational and training institutions, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the voluntary sector, as well as social partners, for example, trade unions and works councils, industry and professional associations, and individual companies.

The beneficiaries of ESF projects are varied, for example, individual workers, groups of people, industrial sectors, trades unions, public administrations or individual firms. Vulnerable groups of people who have particular difficulty in finding work or getting on in their jobs, such as the long-term unemployed and women, are a particular target group.  As an indication, it is estimated that over 9 million individuals from these vulnerable groups are helped each year through participation in ESF projects – see chart 1.

==The European Social Fund 2007–2013==
The last programming cycle of the ESF ran from 2007 to 2013 under the banner 'Investing in People'. Over this period, it invested around €75 billion – close to 10% of the EU budget – on employment-enhancing projects. Funding was given to six specific priority areas:

* Improving human capital (34% of total funding)
* Improving access to employment and sustainability (30%)
* Increasing the adaptability of workers and firms, enterprises and entrepreneurs (18%)
* Improving the social inclusion of less-favoured persons (14%)
* Strengthening institutional capacity at national, regional and local levels (3%)
* Mobilisation for reforms in the fields of employment and inclusion (1%)

In any given region, the actual distribution of funds varied to reflect local and regional priorities. All six priorities were applicable to both the convergence and regional competitiveness and employment objectives; however, convergence would normally place an emphasis on the ‘improving human capital’ priority.

'''FICO''' (legal name: '''Fair Isaac Corporation'''), originally '''F'''air, '''I'''saac and '''Co'''mpany, is a [[data analytics]] company based in [[San Jose, California]] focused on [[credit scoring]] services. It was founded by [[Bill Fair]] and [[Earl Isaac]] in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fico-became-credit-score-100000037.html |title=How FICO became 'the' credit score |publisher=finance.yahoo.com |date=2013-12-12 |accessdate=2018-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[FICO score]], a measure of consumer credit risk,&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/10/is-that-credit-score-a-fico-or-a-fico-8/ | title = Is That Credit Score a FICO, or a FICO 8? | author = Ann Carrns | date=10 May 2012 | accessdate=21 October 2014 | publisher = ''New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt; has become a fixture of consumer lending in the United States.

In 2013, [[creditor|lenders]] purchased more than 10 billion FICO scores and about 30 million American consumers accessed their scores themselves.&lt;ref name=nationalmortgagenews&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/technology/new-fico-scoring-model-coming-this-summer-1041282-1.html | title = New FICO Scoring Model Coming This Summer | author = Evan Nemeroff | date=7 March 2014 | accessdate = 21 October 2014 | publisher = National Mortgage News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
FICO was founded in 1956 as Fair, Isaac and Company by engineer [[Bill Fair|William Fair]] and mathematician [[Earl Isaac]].&lt;ref name="businessweek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2008-02-06/credit-scores-not-so-magic-numbers|title=Credit Scores: Not-So-Magic Numbers|date=2008-02-06|author=Dean Foust|author2=Aaron Pressman|accessdate=2014-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two met while working at the [[SRI International|Stanford Research Institute]] in [[Menlo Park, California]].&lt;ref name="startribune"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/business/185665572.html|title=Fair Isaac moving its HQ back to California|date=2013-01-04|author=Jennifer Bjorhus|accessdate=2014-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selling its first credit scoring system two years after the company's creation,&lt;ref name=hist&gt;[http://www.fico.com/en/Company/Pages/history.aspx History] FICO Official Site&lt;/ref&gt; FICO pitched its system to fifty American [[creditor|lenders]].&lt;ref name="marketplace"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketplace.org/topics/your-money/how-i-learned-stop-worrying/brief-history-credit-score|title=A brief history of the credit score|date=2014-04-22|author=Adriene Hill|accessdate=2014-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FICO went [[public company|public]] in 1986 and is traded on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref name=businessweek/&gt; The company debuted its first general-purpose FICO score in 1989.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; FICO scores are based on credit reports and "base" FICO scores range from 300 to 850,&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; while industry-specific scores range from 250 to 900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myfico.com/credit-education/credit-report-credit-score-articles/ |title=What is a FICO score? |website=MyFICO.com official website |publisher=Fair Isaac Corporation |accessdate=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lenders use the scores to gauge a potential borrower's creditworthiness.&lt;ref name="nytimes2"&gt;{{cite

[[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] first began using FICO scores to help determine which American consumers qualified for mortgages bought and sold by the companies in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.benbest.com/business/credit.html|title=North American Credit Scoring &amp; Reporting |publisher=benbest.com |date=2009-12-04 |accessdate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Financial Security Law of France''' (known in France as LSF or Loi de sécurité financière), signed by the Minister of Finance, [[Francis Mer]], was adopted by the [[French Parliament]] on July 17, 2003 in order to strengthen the legal provisions relating to corporate governance. The LSF was published in OJ No. 177, August 2, 2003 (No. 2003-706 dated August 1, 2003).

Similar to the American [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]], the Financial Security Law of France rests mainly on: 
* An increased responsibility of leaders
* A strengthening of internal control 
* A reduction in the sources of conflicts of interest &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definitions &amp; Legislation: Internal Control|url=http://www.praxiam.com/definitions-legislation.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gottlieb Duttweiler''' (15 August 1888 – 8 June 1962) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[businessman]] and [[politician]], founder of both the [[Migros]] chain of grocery stores and the [[Alliance of Independents]] (''Landesring der Unabhängigen'') party.

== Life and work ==
Duttweiler was born in [[Zürich]]. Starting with five vehicles in 1925, his [[Migros]] eventually opened stores and is today one of the main grocery chains in [[Switzerland]]. The original secret to his success was bringing daily necessities to the consumer by excluding the middlemen. As a result, many producers initially chose to boycott Migros, and Duttweiler's Migros would itself manufacture or package those missing products. In 1941, Gottlieb and his wife [[Adele Duttweiler]] transferred ownership of Migros to their customers, as a [[cooperative]].&lt;ref name="flexibles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flexibles.ch/Nachhaltigkeit/Gottlieb%20Duttweiler/Duttweiler.htm|title=Ethischer Individualismus im Leben und Werk unserer Zeitgenossen und Zeitgenossinnen: Zu Gottlieb und Adele Duttweiler|publisher=flexibles.ch|author=Jens Martignoni|language=German|date=24 October 2004|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Duttweiler also required that Migros contribute a percentage of profits (actual from the total revenue) to cultural, athletic, and hobby-related activities. This led to the Migros-club-schools and several hobby courses.

He also initiated the so-called ''[[Park im Grüene]]'' or ''Dutti-Park'' at the site of the later institute that was named after Gottlieb Duttweiler. In 1949, he participated at the former ''[[Buchclub Ex Libris]]'', which was integrated in the Migros group in 1956.&lt;ref name="exlibris"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exlibrisrecords.ch/geschichte.html|title=Ex Libris Geschichte|publisher=exlibrisrecords.ch|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Zürich-based [[Reederei Zürich AG]] ordered at the ''H. C. Stülcken Sohn'' shipyard in Hamburg, Germany, the cargo ship [[Adele (1952 ship)|''Adele'']] which was launched in Hamburg on 15 July 1952, the ship was christened by [[Adele Duttweiler]], the wife of Gottlieb Duttweiler, on behalf of the [[Federation of Migros Cooperatives]] (''Migros Genossenschaftsbund'').&lt;ref name="brückenbauer-launch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swiss-ships.ch/reeder/reederei-berichte/r-z-migros/1952-07-25%20Brueckenbauer%20Euses%20Schiff.pdf|title=Euses Schiff|publisher=[[Brückenbauer]]|author=|language=German|date=25 July 1952|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, he founded the [[Migros Bank]].

Duttweiler also founded the political party [[Alliance of Independents]] (''Landesring der Unabhängigen''). Adele and Gottlieb Dutweiler established the ''Adele und Gottlieb Duttweiler Stiftung'' to ensure the future work of the Migros chain as a cooperative according to the founding act.&lt;ref name="AGD-stiftung"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.migros.ch/de/ueber-die-migros/geschichte/duttweiler-stiftung.html|title=G. und A.

Duttweiler died in [[Zurich]]. The [[Gottlieb Duttweiler Institute]] in [[Rüschlikon]] was founded after his death.

[[Lieutenant-Colonel]] '''Henry Breedon Everard''' [[Legion of Merit (Rhodesia)|GCLM]] [[Doctor of Canon Law|ICD]] [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] [[Territorial Decoration|TD]] (21 February 1897 – 7 August 1980) was a railway engineer and executive who briefly became  the Acting [[President of Rhodesia]] during the [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|U.D.I.]] period.

Everard was born in [[Chipping Barnet|Barnet]] and educated at [[Marlborough College]] and graduated from [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge University List of Members, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[First World War]] he served in France with the [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)|Rifle Brigade]], where he was wounded in combat and reached the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]]. He worked as a railway engineer from 1922, but was commissioned again on the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], this time in the [[Sherwood Foresters]]; he was taken prisoner by German forces, awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]], and reached the rank of [[Lieutenant-Colonel]]. When repatriated after the war he became an executive of [[British Railways]].

In 1953 Everard moved to [[Bulawayo]], [[Southern Rhodesia]] to become General Manager of [[Rhodesia Railways]], which he remained for five years before retiring. He supported the [[Rhodesian Front]] and stood in for [[Clifford Dupont]] (who had been made "[[Officer Administering the Government]]") in 1968–69.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xREiAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22Henry+Everard%22+rhodesia&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Henry+Everard%22++ ''Survey of British and Commonwealth Affairs''], Volume 2, British Information Services, 1968, page 715&lt;/ref&gt; Following the proclamation of a republic, Everard was Acting President on three occasions between 1975 and 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TzOxCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA265&amp;dq=%22Henry%20Everard%22%20rhodesia&amp;pg=PA265#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Henry%20Everard%22%20rhodesia&amp;f=false ''Heads of State and Government''], John V.

'''Herminie Cadolle''' (1845–1926) was the French inventor of the modern [[bra]] and founder of the Cadolle [[lingerie]] house.

Cadolle was a close friend of the [[France|French]] insurrectionist [[Louise Michel]], and it was this connection that led her to leave for the safety of [[Buenos Aires]]. Here, in 1887, Herminie opened a shop selling made-to-measure underwear.

Returning to [[Paris]] in 1889, she opened a similar lingerie workshop on the street ''[[Chaussée d'Antin]]'', where she invented a two-piece undergarment called ''le bien-être'' (the wellbeing). The lower part was a corset for the waist and the upper supported the breasts by means of shoulder straps. She exhibited at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Great Exposition of 1900]] and by 1905 the upper half was being sold separately as a ''soutien-gorge'' (literally, "support for the throat", but ''gorge'' in old French meant breast), the name by which bras are still known in France.

Herminie became a fitter of bras to queens, princesses, dancers, and actresses. [[Mata Hari]] was among her customers. She was also the first to use cloth incorporating rubber (elastic) thread. Cadolle's business is still running today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14742">In [[economics]], '''hot money''' is the flow of funds (or capital) from one country to another in order to earn a short-term profit on [[interest rate]] differences and/or anticipated [[exchange rate]] shifts. These speculative [[capital (economics)|capital flows]] are called 'hot money' because they can move very quickly in and out of markets, potentially leading to market instability.&lt;ref name = "CRS"&gt;CRS Report for Congress, July 21, 2008: China’s “Hot Money” Problems, by Micheal F. Martin and Wayne M. Morrison&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illustration of hot money flows==
The following simple example illustrates the phenomenon of hot money: In the beginning of 2011, the national average rate of one year [[certificate of deposit]] in the United States is 0.95%. In contrast, China's benchmark one year deposit rate is 3%. The [[Chinese currency]] (renminbi) is seriously undervalued against the world's major trading currencies and therefore is likely to appreciate against the US dollar in the coming years. Given this situation, if an investor in the US deposits his or her money in a Chinese bank, the investor would get a higher return than that in the situation in which he or she deposits money in a US bank. This makes China a prime target for hot money inflows. This is just an example for illustration. In reality, hot money takes many different forms of investment.
 
The following description may help further illustrate this phenomenon: "one country or sector in the world economy experiences a [[financial crisis]]; capital flows out in a panic; investors seek a more attractive destination for their money. In the next destination, capital inflows create a boom that is accompanied by rising indebtedness, rising asset prices and booming consumption - for a time. But all too often, these capital inflows are followed by another crisis. Some commentators describe these patterns of capital flow as “hot money” that flows from one sector or country to the next and leaves behind a trail of destruction."&lt;ref&gt;Hot Money and Serial Financial Crises, Anton Korinek, IMF Economic Review (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of hot money==
As mentioned above, capital in the following form could be considered hot money:
* Short-term foreign [[portfolio investment]]s, including investments in [[Equity (finance)|equities]], [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] and [[Derivative (finance)|financial derivatives]]
* Short-term foreign bank loans
* Foreign bank loans with short term investment horizon
 
The types of [[Financial capital|capital]] in the above categories share common characteristics: the investment horizon is short, and they can come in quickly and leave quickly.

== Estimates of total value ==
There is no well-defined method for estimating the amount of “hot money” flowing into a country during a period of time, because “hot money” flows quickly and is poorly monitored. In addition, once an estimate is made, the amount of “hot money” may suddenly rise or fall, depending on the economic conditions driving the flow of funds. One common way of approximating the flow of “hot money” is to subtract a nation’s [[Balance of trade|trade surplus]] (or deficit) and its net flow of [[Foreign direct investment|foreign direct investment (FDI)]] from the change in the nation’s [[Foreign exchange reserves|foreign reserves]].&lt;ref name = "CRS"/&gt;

Hot Money (approx) = Change in foreign exchange reserves - Net exports - Net foreign direct investment

== Sources and causes ==

Hot money is usually originated from the capital rich, developed countries that have lower GDP growth rate and lower interest rates compared to the GDP growth rate and interest rate of [[Emerging markets|emerging market]] economies such as India, Brazil, China, Turkey, Malaysia etc. Although the specific causes of hot money flow are somewhat different from period to period, generally, the following could be considered as the causes of hot money flow:&lt;ref name="calvoetal"&gt;Inflows of Capital to Developing Countries in the 1990s, by Calvo, Leiderman, Reinhart, Journal of Economic Perspective 1996&lt;/ref&gt; 
* a sustained decline of interest rates in the highly industrialized, developed countries. The lower interest rates in the developed nations attract investors to the high investment yields and improving economic prospects in Asia and Latin America.
* a general trend towards international diversification of investments in major financial centers and towards growing integration of world [[capital market]]s.
* [[emerging markets|Emerging market]] countries began to adopt sound monetary and fiscal policies as well as market-oriented reforms including trade and capital market liberalization. Such policy reforms, among others, have resulted in a credible increase in the rate of return on investments.

As described above, hot money can be in different forms. [[Hedge fund]]s, other portfolio investment funds and international borrowing of domestic financial institutions are generally considered as the vehicles of hot money. In the [[1997 Asian financial crisis|1997 East Asian Financial Crisis]] and in the [[1998 Russian financial crisis|1998 Russian Financial Crises]], the “hot money” chiefly came from banks, not portfolio investors.&lt;ref&gt;Hot Money, by Martin N.Baily, Diana Farrell, and Susan Lund, May 2000, McKinsey Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact==

Capital flows can increase welfare by enabling households to smooth out their consumption over time and achieve a higher level of consumption. Capital flows can help developed countries achieve a better international diversification of their portfolios.&lt;ref name="calvoetal"/&gt;

However, large and sudden inflows of capital with a short term investment horizon have negative  macroeconomic effects, including rapid monetary expansion, inflationary pressures, real exchange rate appreciation and widening [[current account]] deficits. Especially, when capital flows in volume into small and shallow local [[financial market]]s, the exchange rate tends to appreciate, asset prices rally and local commodity prices boom. These favorable asset price movements improve national fiscal indicators and encourage domestic credit expansion. These, in turn, exacerbate structural weakness in the domestic bank sector. When global investors' sentiment on emerging markets shift, the flows reverse and asset prices give back their gains, often forcing a painful adjustment on the economy.&lt;ref name=bonanzas&gt;Capital Flow Bonanzas: An Encompassing View of the Past and Present, by Carmen M. Reinhart and Vincent R. Reinhart, NBER Working Paper No. 14321, September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are the details of the dangers that hot money presents to the receiving country's economy:

* '''Inflow of massive capital with short investment horizon (hot money)''' could cause asset prices to rally&lt;ref name=bonanzas/&gt; and [[inflation]] to rise. The sudden inflow of large amounts of foreign money would increase the monetary base of the receiving country (if the central bank is pegging the currency), which would help create a credit boom. This, in turn, would result in such a situation in which "too much money chases too few goods". The consequences of this would be inflation.

Furthermore, hot money could lead to exchange rate appreciation or even cause exchange rate overshooting. And if this exchange rate appreciation persists, it would hurt the competitiveness of the respective country's export sector by making the country's exports more expensive compared to similar foreign goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo J. Caballero, Guido Lorenzoni, 2007. Persistent Appreciation and Overshooting: A Normative Analysis. (MIT and NBER)&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Sudden outflow of hot money''', which would always certainly happen, would deflate asset prices and could cause the collapse value of the currency of respective country. This is especially so in countries with relatively scarce internationally liquid assets. There is growing agreement that this was the case in the [[1997 Asian financial crisis|1997 East Asian Financial Crisis]]. In the run-up to the crises, firms and private firms in South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia accumulated large amounts of short-term foreign debt (a type of hot money). The three countries shared a common characteristic of having large ratio of short term foreign debt to international reserves. When the capital started to flow out, it caused a collapse in asset prices and exchange rates. The financial panic fed on itself, causing foreign creditors to call in loans and depositors to withdraw funds from banks. All of these magnified the illiquidity of the domestic financial system and forced yet another round of costly asset liquidations and price deflation. In all of the three countries, the domestic financial institutions came to the brink of default on their external short term obligations.&lt;ref&gt;Short Term Capital Flows, by Dani Rodrik, Andres Velasco, 1999 NBER&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some economists and financial experts argue that hot money could also play positive role in countries that have relatively low level of foreign exchange reserves, because the capital inflow may present a useful opportunity for those countries to augment their central banks' reserve holdings.&lt;ref name=imf2010&gt;Capital Inflows: The Role of Controls, IMF Staff Position Note, February 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Control ==
Generally speaking, given their relatively high interest rates compared with that of the developed market economies, [[emerging market]] economies are the destination of hot money. Although the emerging market countries welcome capital inflows such as [[foreign direct investment]], because of hot money's negative effects on the economy, they are instituting policies to stop "hot money" from coming into their country in order to eliminate the negative consequences.

Different countries are using different methods to prevent massive influx of hot money. The following are the main methods of dealing with hot money.&lt;ref name=imf2010/&gt;

* '''Exchange rate appreciation''': the exchange rate can be used as a tool to control the inflow of hot money. If the currency is believed to be undervalued, that would be a cause of hot money inflow. In such circumstance, economists usually suggest a significant one-off appreciation rather than a gradual move in the [[exchange rate]], as a gradual appreciation of the exchange rate would attract even more hot money into the country. One downside of this approach is that exchange rate appreciation would reduce the competitiveness of the [[export]] sector.
* '''Interest rate reduction''': countries that adopt this policy would lower their central bank's benchmark interest rates to reduce the incentive for inflow. For example, on December 16, 2010, the [[Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey|Turkish Central Bank]] surprised markets by cutting interest rates at a time of rising inflation and relatively high [[economic growth]]. Erdem Basci, deputy bank governor of Turkish Central Bank argued that gradual rate cuts were the best way to prevent excessive capital inflows fuelling asset bubbles and currency appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;Turkey surprises with interest rate cut, by Delphine Strauss, Financial Times, December 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On February 14, 2011, Mehmet Simsek, the Turkish Finance Minister said: “more than $8 billion in short-term investment had exited the country after the central bank cut rates and took steps to slow credit growth. The markets have got the message that Turkey does not want hot money inflows”&lt;ref&gt;Simsek Says $8 Billion ‘Hot Money’ Left Turkey, by Steve Bryant, Bloomberg News, Feb 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Capital controls]]''': some capital control policies adopted by China belong to this category. For example, in China, the government does not allow foreign funds to invest directly in its [[capital market]]. Also, the [[People's Bank of China|central bank of China]] sets quotas for its domestic [[financial institution]]s for the use of short-term foreign debt and prevent banks from overusing their quotas.&lt;ref&gt;China enhances efforts to curb hot money inflow, China Daily, November 09, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1991, the Chilean government instituted a non-remunerated (non-paid) 20 percent reserve requirement to be deposited at the Central Bank for a period of one year for liabilities in foreign currency, for firms which are borrowing directly in foreign currency.&lt;ref&gt;Controls on Short-Term Capital Inflows - The Latin American Experience and Lessons For DMCs, by Pradumna B. Rana. Asian Development Bank, Economics and Development Resource Center Briefing Notes, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Increasing bank reserve requirements and sterilization''': some countries pursue a [[fixed exchange rate]] policy. In the face of large net capital inflow, those countries would [[currency intervention|intervene in the foreign exchange market]] to prevent exchange rate appreciation. Then sterilize the monetary impact of intervention through [[open market operations]] and through increasing [[bank reserve]]s requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Capital Inflows: Macroeconomic Implications and Policy Responses, by Roberto Cardarelli, Selim Elekdag, M. Ayhan Kose, IMF Working Paper, March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when hot money originated from the U.S. enters China, investors would sell [[United States dollar|US dollars]] and buy [[Chinese yuan]] in the [[foreign exchange market]]. This would put upward pressure on the value of the yuan. In order to prevent the appreciation of the Chinese currency, the central bank of China print yuan to buy US dollars. This would increase money supply in China, which would in turn cause inflation. Then, the central bank of China has to increase [[bank reserve]] requirements or issue Chinese government bonds to bring back the money that it has previously released into the market in the [[exchange rate]] intervention operation. However, like other approaches, this approach has limitations. The first, the [[central bank]] can't keep increasing [[bank reserves]], because doing so would negatively affect bank's profitability. The second, in the [[emerging market]] economies, the domestic [[financial market]] is not deep enough for [[open market operations]] to be effective.
* '''[[Fiscal policy|Fiscal]] tightening''': the idea is to use fiscal restraint, especially in the form of spending cuts on nontradables, so as to lower aggregate demand and curb the inflationary impact of capital inflow.&lt;ref&gt;Capital Flows in the APEC Region (book), edited by Mohsin S. Khan, Carmen M. Reinhart. International Monetary Fund, March 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joannes de Mol''' (September 15, 1726 – November 22, 1782) was a Dutch [[minister (Christianity)|minister]], [[Patriots (Dutch Republic)|Patriot]] and porcelain manufacturer in the second half of the 18th century.  De Mol - like many of his contemporaries - had a great interest in poetry and scientific experiments.

==Life==
[[File:Domineedemol.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Joannes de Mol by Pieter Oets (1720-1790). [[Kasteel-museum Sypesteyn]], [[Nieuw-Loosdrecht]].]]

De Mol was born in 1726 at [[Midlum, Friesland|Midlum]], near [[Harlingen, Netherlands|Harlingen]] and, like his father, studied theology in [[Leiden University|Leiden]].  His first post was at [['s-Gravenpolder]] in [[Zeeland]], before moving in 1752 to [[Oud-Loosdrecht]]. There he got to know one of the richest women in Amsterdam, [[Anna de Haze]] who had a country house in the village and a collection of [[Meissen]] porcelain.  In 1774 De Mol bought a clay part, stored in the [[Muiderslot]], left over from the porcelain factory in [[Weesp]].  That factory started in 1759 by [[Bertrand Philip, count of Gronsveld]], [[drost|bailiff]] of [[Muiden]] and member of the [[Admiralty of Amsterdam]].  The factory was declared a failure in 1770, and hardly produced a little more for its last two years.

De Mol began with experiments in his garden shed behind the parsonage, opposite the church in Oud-Loosdrecht.  In 1774, he started producing [[porcelain]] as a way of creating employments for the local population in the impoverished peat district.  A part of the production process, however, was sited in [[Bilthoven]].&lt;ref&gt;Zappey, W.M. (1988) De Loosdrechtse porseleinfabriek 1774-1784. In: Blaauwen, A.L. den, et al. (1988) Loosdrechts porselein 1774-1784.&lt;/ref&gt;  On a country estate, property of the youngest brother of [[Belle van Zuylen]], stood a "pletmolen met stamperij" (mill with grinding facilities), where [[feldspar]], but possibly also cheap Chinese porcelain was added and ground up.  The raw materials were mixed up with suitable white clay (from England?) and [[quartz]] in a cellar in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], and shipped to Oud-Loosdrecht.

The factory at Oud-Loosdrecht employed sixty men, of which twenty acted as painters and 25 were children, who also were trained in drawing.  Under the foreign employees was [[Louis Gerverot|Louis Victor Gerverot]], then known as a painter of exotic birds on porcelain.  To finance the business, a few regents in Amsterdam, along with his sister-in-law, Eva de Mol-van Eibergen, acted as guarantor, jointly invested 200,000 [[Dutch guilder|guilders]] in the factory.

In 1779, De Mol was laureated by the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences|Economics Branch]] for the care of his workforce.  De Mol took former soldiers from [[Surinam]] to employ.  The managers of the [[Suriname Company]] had made contact with him and convened in his business.  J.G. Eichhorn, a German, who had a stiff right arm, was given &lt;!---???---&gt;a salary of two guilders per week and the Association provided a same sum .&lt;ref&gt;Habermehl, N.D.B. (2000) Joan Cornelis van der Hoop (1742—1825). Marinebestuurder voor stadhouder Willem V en koning Willem I, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless De Mol - who had in the meantime become a patriot - had major difficulties keeping his head above water.  His products were expensive: a cup and saucer costing seven guilder, then more than a week's salary for most.

De Mol's main fear was his competitor [[Anton Lyncke]] in the Hague, who imported white porcelain from Germany to the Hague for painting.  De Mol organised special lotteries to finance his work, but in 1781 was again forced to borrow money from the Amsterdam banker and art collector [[Jan Hope]].  Barbara van der Hoeven, Hope's wife, came into the possession of 25% of the shares in the Manufactuur Old-Loosdrecht (M.O.L.).

==Old age==
Because of weak health and output problems, De Mol had to sell his factory in 1782 for 12,000 guilder to four Amsterdam [[regenten|regents]]:  [[Joachim Rendorp]], John Hope, Abraham Dedel and Cornelis van der Hoop.  His creditors put in place a new manager, Frederik Daeuber.  De Mol died two weeks later at a prestigious lodging ''de Rondeel'' on the river [[Amstel]].  The innkeeper tried to take possession of de Mol's stock in the warehouse on [[Singel]].

Johannes de Mol always had the illusion that his son would follow in his footsteps.  In 1783, however, Huibert fled to Germany with a 19-year-old (under age) noble girl from [[Maarssen]].  In 1784, porcelain production was moved to Amsterdam. It received the protection of [[Louis Bonaparte]], in 1806 the first king of the Netherlands.  About 1820, it ceased porcelain production.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2562">'''Kung'u Karumba''' was a Kenyan [[nationalist]] and freedom-fighter. He was a member of the [[Kapenguria Six]], along with [[Bildad Kaggia]], [[Jomo Kenyatta]], [[Fred Kubai]], [[Paul Ngei]], and [[Achieng Oneko]].

Kungu Karumba along with other five legendary men including Kenya's first president (Jomo Kenyatta) were arrested on October 20, 1952 in Kapenguria by a British colonial governor at the time, for been involved in a revolutionary group called the Mau Mau, which led a revolt against British colonial rule. Reason as to why the case was held in Kapenguria was so that the Mau Mau could not get to free the men. The area was remote at the time. He was convicted and locked up in prison for seven years with hard labor before the country's independence on December 12, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/12/dec-12-1963-kenya-gains-independence/?_r=0 Dec. 12, 1963 | Kenya Gains Independence - The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; The case that immortalised Kenya's 'Kapenguria Six'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1453">"'''Labour is not a commodity'''" is the principle expressed in the preamble to the [[International Labour Organization]]'s founding documents. It expresses the view that people should not be treated like inanimate [[commodities]], [[Human capital|capital]], another mere [[factor of production]], or [[Human resources|resources]]. Instead, people who work for a living should be treated as [[human being]]s and accorded [[dignity]] and respect.

'''Leo Burnett''' (October 21, 1891 – June 7, 1971) was an [[United States citizen|American]] [[advertising]] executive and the founder of  [[Leo Burnett Worldwide|Leo Burnett Company, Inc.]]. He was responsible for creating some of advertising's most well-known characters and campaigns of the 20th century, including [[Tony the Tiger]], [[Charlie the Tuna]], the [[Marlboro Man]], the [[Maytag#Ol' Lonely|Maytag Repairman]], [[United Airlines|United]]'s "Fly the Friendly Skies", and [[Allstate]]'s "Good Hands", and for garnering relationships with [[multinational corporation|multinational]] clients such as [[McDonald's]], [[Hallmark]] and [[Coca-Cola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CNBC Titans: Leo Burnett|url=http://www.leoburnett.com/|website=Hulu|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Burnett was named by [[Time Magazine]] as one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=March 11, 2012 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,991227,00.html |title= Time Magazine  |work= Times 100 Persons of the Century |date=June 14, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Leo Burnett was born in [[St. Johns, Michigan]], on October 21, 1891 to Noble and Rose Clark Burnett. Noble ran a dry goods store and as a young man, Burnett worked with his father, watching Noble as he designed ads for the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Star Reacher|date=1995|publisher=Leo Burnett Company, Inc.|location=Chicago, IL|page=7|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CNBC Titans: Leo Burnett|url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/296814|website=Hulu|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After high school, Burnett went on to study [[journalism]] at the [[University of Michigan]] and received his bachelor's degree in 1914.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Burnett's first job out of college was as a reporter for the Peoria ''Journal Star'' in [[Peoria, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Leo Burnett: Advertising|date=1993|publisher=Art Director's Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, he moved to [[Detroit]] and was hired to edit an in-house publication for Cadillac Clearing House, later becoming an advertising director for the same institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leo Burnett|url=http://www.top-biography.com/9129-Leo%20Burnett|website=Top Biography|accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Cadillac, Burnett met his advertising mentor, [[Theodore F. MacManus]], whom Burnett called "one of the great advertising men of all time". MacManus ran the agency that handled Cadillac's advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joan Kufrin|title=Star Reacher|date=1995|publisher=Leo Burnett Company, Inc.|location=Chicago, IL|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, Burnett married Naomi Geddes. The couple met at a small restaurant near the Cadillac offices, where Naomi worked as a cashier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joan Kufrin|title=Star Reacher|date=1995|publisher=Leo Burnett Company, Inc.|location=Chicago, IL|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; They went on to have three children: Peter, Joseph and [[Phoebe Snetsinger|Phoebe]].

During [[World War I]], Burnett joined the [[United States Navy|Navy]] for six months. However, his service was mostly spent at [[Naval Station Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] building a [[breakwater (structure)|breakwater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joan Kufrin|title=Star Reacher|publisher=Leo Burnett Company, Inc.|location=Chicago, IL|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his time in the military, Burnett returned to Cadillac for a short while. It was then when a few employees at Cadillac formed the LaFayette Motors Company – triggering Burnett to move to [[Indianapolis]] to work for the new establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leo Burnett|url=http://www.top-biography.com/9129-Leo%20Burnett|website=Top Biography|accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, he was offered a position at Homer McKee. He then left LaFayette and joined McKee, where Burnett said of the founder, "(He) gave me my first feel of what I have come to regard as the "warm sell" as contrasted to the "hard sell" and "soft sell".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joan Kufrin|title=Star Reacher|date=1995|publisher=Leo Burnett Company, Inc.|location=Chicago, IL|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was his first agency job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Denis Higgins|title=The Art of Writing Advertising: Conversations with Masters of the Craft|date=1987|location=Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After spending a decade at McKee's, and working through the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash of 1929]], Burnett left the company. In 1930, he moved to [[Chicago]] and was hired by Erwin, Wasey &amp; Company, where he was employed for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joan Kufrin|title=Star Reacher|date=1995|publisher=Leo Burnett Company, Inc|location=Chicago, IL|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, Burnett founded the Leo Burnett Company, Inc. in a suite at the [[Palmer House]] in downtown Chicago.&lt;ref name="CNBC Titans: Leo Burnett"&gt;{{cite web|title=CNBC Titans: Leo Burnett|url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/296814|website=Hulu|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, the operation moved to the 18th floor of the London Guarantee Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joan Kufrin|title=Star Reacher|date=1995|publisher=Leo Burnett Company, Inc.|location=Chicago, IL|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the agency has 9,000+ employees in over 85 offices globally.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In December 1967, nearing the end of his career, Burnett delivered his famous "When To Take My Name Off The Door" speech at the agency's annual holiday gathering.&lt;ref name="CNBC Titans: Leo Burnett"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When To Take My Name Off The Door|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WUxb8YB88o|website=YouTube|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 1971, Burnett went to his agency, pledging to his colleagues to cut back to working only three days per week due to some  health problems. That evening, at the age of 79, he died of a [[heart attack]] at his family farm in [[Lake Zurich, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joan Kufrin|title=Star Reacher|date=1995|publisher=Leo Burnett Company, Inc.|location=Chicago, IL|page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CNBC Titans|url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/296814|website=Hulu|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leo Burnett Company==
A [[Privately held company|private company]] formed in 1935 and officially running under the name of '[[Leo Burnett Worldwide|Leo Burnett Company, Inc.]]', the agency started with working capital of $50,000, eight employees and three clients.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Now a part of [[Publicis|Publicis Groupe]], Leo Burnett is one of the largest agency networks with 85 offices in 69 countries and 9,000+ employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicisgroupe.com/#/en/videos/brand-videos/brand/Bartle+Bogle+Hegarty+%28BBH%29|website=Publicis Groupe|title=Publicis Groupe Showcase|accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Overview of Leo Burnett Company, Inc.|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=427231|website=Bloomberg Businessweek|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kufrin|first1=Joan|title=Leo Burnett: Star Reacher|publisher=Leo Burnett Company, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first several years, Burnett billed about $1 million annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HrBHohLC56AC&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;ots=xpxEh6Kqui&amp;dq=Burnett%20billed%20about%20$1%20million%20annually&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q=Burnett%20billed%20about%20$1%20million%20annually&amp;f=false|title=Life List: A Woman's Quest for the World's Most Amazing Birds|last=Gentile|first=Olivia|date=2009-07-01|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|year=|isbn=9781608191468|location=|page=39|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1950, billings had increased to $22 million, and by 1954 the company was at $55 million annually. By the end of the 1950s, the Leo Burnett Company was billing $100 million  annually.&lt;ref name="topbiography"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 12, 2012 |url=http://www.top-biography.com/9129-Leo%20Burnett

==Advertising techniques==
Burnett used dramatic realism in his advertising, the [[Soft sell]] approach to build brand equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hackley|first=Chris|title=Advertising &amp; Promotion An Integrated Market Communications Approach|year=2010|publisher=Sage Publications Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-1-84920-145-2|pages=36|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burnett believed in finding the "inherent drama" of products and presenting it in advertising through warmth, shared emotions and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ad Age Advertising Century: People: Leo Burnett|url=http://adage.com/century/people003.html|publisher=Advertising Age|accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His advertising drew from heartland-rooted values using simple, strong and instinctive imagery that talked to people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=ciaadvertising.org |editor1-first=Gerrard |editor1-last=Tellis |editor2-first=Tim |editor2-last=Ambler |title=The SAGE Handbook of Advertising |publisher=SAGE Publications |date=January 16, 2006 |pages=17–35 |chapter=1.2: A Brief History of Advertising |isbn=978-1-4129-1886-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also known for using "cultural archetypes" in his copy, by creating mythical creatures that represented American values. This is evident on such campaigns as [[Jolly Green Giant]], [[Tony the Tiger]], [[Pillsbury Doughboy]] and more famously the [[Marlboro Man]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sandra|first1=Moriarty|last2=Mitchell|first2=Nancy|last3=Wells|first3=William|title=Advertising &amp; IMC Principles and Practice|year=2012|publisher=Pearson Education Limited|location=Harlow|isbn=978-0-27-37-5292-9|pages=44|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, these campaigns played on the 1950s attitudes towards masculinity that pervaded his campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ewen|first1=Stuart|title=Leo Burnett: The Sultan of Sell|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,989783-2,00.html|website=Time|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corny language===
Burnett was known for keeping a folder in the lower left-hand corner of his desk called "Corny Language".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 15, 2012 |url= http://www.longlostmarketingsecrets.com/mastermarketers/leoburnett.html 
 |title= Long Lost Marketing Secrets – Leo Burnett  |work=Peter Woodhead |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He collected words, phrases, and analogies that struck him as being particularly apt in expressing an idea.&lt;ref name="ogilvy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ogilvy|first=David|title=Ogilvy on Advertising|year=1983|publisher=Carlton Publishing Group|location=London|isbn=978-1-85375-615-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social advertising==
In 1947, Burnett wrote ''The Good Citizen'', a booklet concerning the duties and privileges of being a [[U.S. citizen]]. This was done as a public service for The [[Advertising Council]] and The [[American Heritage Foundation]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

'''Main Street Programs''' aim to revitalize their downtowns and commercial districts through preservation-based economic development and community revitalization. The project commenced in 1977 with a pilot involving 3 towns: [[Galesburg, Illinois]], [[Madison, Indiana]], and [[Hot Springs, South Dakota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the National Main Street Center|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/main-street/about-main-street/the-center/history.html|website=Main Street America|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, the program has been expanded to include many other towns. These may be statewide or regional "coordinating programs" or "local programs." Programs determined to be "Designated" follow best-practices established by the National Main Street Center and/or statewide or regional coordinating programs. A [[main street manager]] is appointed to implement the program locally.

Chimirri was appointed as the head of the state-owned telecom company [[Hondutel]] after his uncle became president in 2006.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

According to [[Reporters Without Borders]], on May 8, 2006, Chimirri attacked reporter Octavio Carvajal, an action Carvajal attributed to embarrassing questions and criticism he had made about Chimirri. Chimirri reportedly grabbed Carvajal by the throat and said "I am not intimidating you because I am not someone who makes threats - I act and I execute... the president’s office is irritated by all the questions you have been asking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/Radio-journalist-flees-to-US-after.html |title=Radio journalist flees to US after being threatened by state phone company official |publisher=Reporters Without Borders |date=2006-05-12 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, Latin Node Inc., an American company, pleaded guilty in [[Miami, Florida]] to making improper payments to Hondutel, "knowing that some, or all of those funds, would be passed on as bribes to officials of Hondutel".&lt;ref&gt;[http://miami.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/pressrel09/mm040709.htm Department of Justice Press Release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101003082642/http://miami.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/pressrel09/mm040709.htm |date=2010-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later, Chimirri was arrested by the Dirección General de Investigación Criminal (DGNI) after being indicted on charges of bribery, fraud and abuse of authority, charges which he denies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nacionales&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Julio, 2009 |url=http://www.latribuna.hn/web2.0/?p=15493 |title=Capturado ex gerente de Hondutel Marcelo Chimirri |publisher=LaTribuna.hn |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2010-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119003612/http://www.latribuna.hn/web2.0/?p=15493 |archivedate=2010-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chimirri remains in prison. In addition to Chimirri, Oscar Danilo Santos (the former manager of Hondutel), Jorge Rosa, and James Lagos were all charged in connection with allegedly committing crimes of abuse of authority, fraud and bribery having received bribes of $1.09 million U.S. from an Latin Node in exchange for Hondutel providing that carrier lower rates than other firms.

'''Metalworking''' is the process of working with [[metal]]s to create individual parts, assemblies, or large-scale structures. The term covers a wide range of work from large [[ship]]s and [[bridge]]s to precise [[engine]] parts and delicate [[jewelry]]. It therefore includes a correspondingly wide range of skills, processes, and [[tool]]s.

Metalworking is a science, art,&lt;ref&gt;Metal sculptures http://www.janetgoldner.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idiotdiary.com/this-steampunk-metal-scupltures-by-igor-verniy-will-leave-your-jaws-wide-open/|title=Steampunk Metal Sculptures|date=|accessdate=2012-08-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707190819/http://idiotdiary.com/this-steampunk-metal-scupltures-by-igor-verniy-will-leave-your-jaws-wide-open/|archivedate=2015-07-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; hobby, industry and trade. Its historical roots span cultures, civilizations, and millennia. Metalworking has evolved from the discovery of [[smelting]] various [[ore]]s, producing [[malleable]] and [[ductile]] metal useful tools and adornments. Modern metalworking processes, though diverse and specialized, can be categorized as forming, cutting, or joining processes. Today's [[machine shop]] includes a number of [[machine tool]]s capable of creating a precise, useful workpiece.

==Prehistory==
The oldest archaeological evidence of [[copper]] [[mining]] and working was the discovery of a copper [[pendant]] in [[northern Iraq]] from 8,700 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, Rayner, W. (2007). ''Jewelrymaking through History: an Encyclopedia.'' Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 56. {{ISBN|0-313-33507-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest substantiated and dated evidence of metalworking in the [[Americas]] was the processing of copper in [[Wisconsin]], near [[Lake Michigan]]. Copper was hammered until brittle then heated so it could be worked some more. This technology is dated to about 4000-5000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Emory Dean Keoke|author2=Kay Marie Porterfield|title=Encyclopedia of American Indian Contributions to the World: 15,000 Years of Inventions and Innovations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QIFTVWJH3doC&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate=8 July 2012|year=2002|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0990-9|pages=14–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest [[gold]] artifacts in the world come from the Bulgarian [[Varna Necropolis]] and date from 4450 BCE.

Not all metal required fire to obtain it or work it. [[Isaac Asimov]] speculated that gold was the "first metal".&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, Isaac: "The Solar System and Back", pp. 151 ff. Doubleday and Company, Inc. 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; His reasoning is that by its [[chemistry]] it is found in nature as nuggets of pure gold. In other words, gold, as rare as it is, is sometimes found in nature as the metal that it is.  There are a few other metals that sometimes occur natively, and as a result of [[meteor]]s. Almost all other metals are found in [[ore]]s, a mineral-bearing [[Rock (geology)|rock]], that require heat or some other process to liberate the metal. Another feature of gold is that it is workable as it is found, meaning that no technology beyond a stone [[hammer]] and [[anvil]] to work the metal is needed.  This is a result of gold's properties of [[malleability]] and [[ductility]]. The earliest [[tool]]s were stone, [[bone]], [[wood]], and [[sinew]], all of which sufficed to work gold.

At some unknown point the connection between heat and the liberation of metals from rock became clear, and rocks rich in copper, [[tin]], and [[lead]] came into demand. These ores were mined wherever they were recognized.  Remnants of such ancient mines have been found all over [[Southwestern Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Percy Knauth et al. "The Emergence of Man, The Metalsmiths", pp. 10–11 ff. Time-Life Books, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Metalworking was being carried out by the [[South Asia]]n inhabitants of [[Mehrgarh]] between 7000–3300 BCE.&lt;ref name=Possehl&gt;Possehl, Gregory L. (1996). ''Mehrgarh'' in ''Oxford Companion to Archaeology'', Brian Fagan (Ed.). Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-507618-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the beginning of metalworking occurs sometime around 6000 BCE when copper [[smelting]] became common in Southwestern Asia.

Ancient civilisations knew of seven metals. Here they are arranged in order of their [[oxidation potential]] (in [[volt]]s):

The oxidation potential is important because it is one indicator of how tightly bound to the ore the metal is likely to be.  As can be seen, iron is significantly higher than the other six metals while gold is dramatically lower than the six above it. Gold's low oxidation is one of the main reasons that gold is found in nuggets. These nuggets are relatively pure gold and are workable as they are found.

Copper ore, being relatively abundant, and tin ore became the next important players in the story of metalworking. Using heat to smelt copper from ore, a great deal of copper was produced. It was used for both [[jewelry]] and simple tools. However, copper by itself was too soft for tools requiring edges and stiffness. At some point tin was added into the molten copper and [[bronze]] was born.  Bronze is an [[alloy]] of copper and tin.  Bronze was an important advance because it had the edge-durability and stiffness that pure copper lacked.  Until the advent of iron, bronze was the most advanced metal for tools and [[weapon]]s in common use (see [[Bronze Age]] for more detail).

Outside Southwestern Asia, these same advances and materials were being discovered and used around the world. [[China]] and [[Great Britain]] jumped into the use of bronze with little time being devoted to copper. [[Japan]] began the use of bronze and [[iron]] almost simultaneously. In the Americas things were different.  Although the peoples of the Americas knew of metals, it was not until the [[European colonisation of the Americas|European colonisation]] that metalworking for tools and weapons became common. Jewelry and [[art]] were the principal uses of metals in the Americas prior to European influence.

Around 2700 BCE, production of bronze was common in locales where the necessary materials could be assembled for smelting, heating, and working the metal. Iron was beginning to be smelted and began its emergence as an important metal for tools and weapons. The period that followed became known as the [[Iron Age]].

==History==
{{See also|History of ferrous metallurgy}}
[[File:WomanFactory1940s.jpg|thumb|A turret lathe operator machining parts for transport planes at the Consolidated Aircraft Corporation plant, Fort Worth, Texas, USA in the 1940s]]

&lt;!-- UNCITED SPECULATION Through trial and error, and crude harnessing of the malleability of metals, inquisitions as to the sources of these elements probably began. --&gt;By the historical periods of the [[Pharaohs]] in [[Egypt]], the [[Vedic]] [[King]]s in [[India]], the [[Tribes of Israel]], and the [[Maya civilization]] in [[North America|South America]], among other ancient populations, [[precious metal]]s began to have value attached to them. In some cases rules for ownership, distribution, and [[trade]] were created, enforced, and agreed upon by the respective peoples. By the above periods metalworkers were very skilled at creating objects of adornment, religious artifacts, and trade instruments of [[precious metals]] (non-ferrous), as well as weaponry usually of ferrous [[metals]] and/or [[alloys]].  These skills were finely honed and well executed.  The techniques were  practiced by artisans, [[blacksmith]]s, [[atharvaveda|atharvavedic]] practitioners, [[alchemy|alchemists]], and other categories of metalworkers around the globe. For example, the [[Granulation (jewellery)|granulation]] technique was employed by numerous ancient cultures before the historic record shows people traveled to far regions to share this process.   This and many other ancient techniques are still used by metalsmiths today.

As time progressed metal objects became more common, and ever more complex. The need to further acquire and work metals grew in importance. Skills related to extracting metal ores from the earth began to evolve, and metalsmiths became more knowledgeable. Metalsmiths became important members of society. Fates and economies of entire civilizations were greatly affected by the availability of metals and metalsmiths. The metalworker depends on the extraction of precious metals to make [[jewelry]], build more efficient [[electronics]], and for [[industry|industrial]] and technological applications from [[construction]] to [[shipping]] containers to [[railway|rail]], and [[air transport]]. Without metals, goods and services would cease to move around the globe on the scale we know today.

==General processes==
[[File:CombinationSquareSet.jpg|thumb|A [[combination square]] used for transferring designs.]]
[[File:DigitalCaliperEuro.jpg|thumb|A caliper is used to precisely measure a short length.]]

Metalworking generally is divided into the following categories, ''forming'', ''cutting'', and, ''joining''.  Each of these categories contain various processes.

Prior to most operations, the metal must be marked out and/or measured, depending on the desired finished product.

''[[Marking out]]'' (also known as layout) is the process of transferring a [[design]] or [[pattern]] to a workpiece and is the first step in the handcraft of metalworking. It is performed in many industries or hobbies, although in industry, the repetition eliminates the need to mark out every individual piece. In the metal trades area, marking out consists of transferring the engineer's [[Technical drawing|plan]] to the workpiece in preparation for the next step, machining or manufacture.

''[[Caliper]]s'' are hand tools designed to precisely measure the distance between two points. Most calipers have two sets of flat, parallel edges used for inner or outer diameter measurements. These calipers can be accurate to within one-thousandth of an inch (25.4 μm). Different types of calipers have different mechanisms for displaying the distance measured. Where larger objects need to be measured with less precision, a [[tape measure]] is often used.

== Casting ==
[[File:SandMoldCopeDragCores.jpg|thumb|A sand casting mold]]
{{Main article|Metal casting}}
Casting achieves a specific form by pouring molten metal into a mold and allowing it to cool, with no mechanical force. Forms of casting include:
* [[Investment casting]] (called [[lost wax casting]] in art)
* [[Centrifugal casting (industrial)|Centrifugal casting]]
* [[Die casting]]
* [[Sand casting]]
* [[Shell casting]]
* [[Spin casting]]

==Forming processes==
These ''forming'' processes modify metal or workpiece by deforming the object, that is, without removing any material. Forming is done with a system of mechanical forces and, especially for bulk metal forming, with heat.

===Bulk forming processes===
[[File:Drop forging Gesenkschmieden.jpg|thumb|A red-hot metal workpiece is inserted into a forging press.]]
[[Plasticity (physics)|Plastic]] [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]] involves using heat or [[pressure]] to make a workpiece more conductive to mechanical force. Historically, this and casting were done by blacksmiths, though today the process has been industrialized. In bulk metal forming, the workpiece is generally heated up.

===Sheet (and tube) forming processes===

These types of forming process involve the application of mechanical force at room temperature. However, some recent developments involve the heating of dies and/or parts. Advancements in automated metalworking technology have made progressive die stamping possible which is a method that can encompass punching, coining, bending and several other ways below that modify metal at less cost while resulting in less scrap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.manortool.com/blog/bid/223131/Top-7-Advantages-of-Progressive-Die-Metal-Stamping-Your-Parts|title=Top 7 Advantages of Progressive Die Metal Stamping Your Parts|last=Creighton|first=John|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cutting processes ==
[[File:Cnc plasma cutting.jpg|thumb|A CNC [[plasma cutting]] machine]]
{{Main article|Cutting}}

''Cutting'' is a collection of processes wherein material is brought to a specified geometry by removing excess material using various kinds of tooling to leave a finished part that meets specifications.  The net result of cutting is two products, the waste or excess material, and the finished part.  In woodworking, the waste would be sawdust and excess wood.  In cutting metals the waste is chips or [[swarf]] and excess metal.

Cutting processes fall into one of three major categories:
* Chip producing processes most commonly known as [[machining]]
* Burning, a set of processes wherein the metal is cut by oxidizing a kerf to separate pieces of metal 
&lt;!-- above needs a wikilink to a main article, but hell if I know what the main article should be (-kierkkadon) --&gt;
* Miscellaneous specialty process, not falling easily into either of the above categories

[[Drilling]] a hole in a metal part is the most common example of a chip producing process.  Using an [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|oxy-fuel cutting torch]] to separate a plate of steel into smaller pieces is an example of burning. Chemical milling is an example of a specialty process that removes excess material by the use of etching chemicals and masking chemicals.

There are many technologies available to cut metal, including: 
*Manual technologies: [[saw]], [[chisel]], [[tin snips|shear or snips]]
*Machine technologies: [[turning]], [[Milling (machining)|milling]], [[drilling]], [[Grinding machine|grinding]], [[saw]]ing
*Welding/burning technologies: burning by [[laser]], [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|oxy-fuel burning]], and [[plasma cutting|plasma]]
*Erosion technologies: by [[Water jet cutter|water jet]], [[spark erosion|electric discharge]], or [[abrasive flow machining]].
*Chemical technologies: [[Photochemical machining]]

[[Cutting fluid]] or [[coolant]] is used where there is significant friction and heat at the cutting interface between a cutter such as a drill or an end mill and the workpiece.  Coolant is generally introduced by a spray across the face of the tool and workpiece to decrease friction and temperature at the cutting tool/workpiece interface to prevent excessive tool wear. In practice there are many methods of delivering coolant.

===Milling===
[[File:Makino-S33-MachiningCenter-example.jpg|thumb|A milling machine in operation, including coolant hoses.]]
{{Main article|Milling (machining)}}

'''Milling''' is the complex shaping of metal or other materials by removing material to form the final shape. It is generally done on a [[milling machine]], a power-driven machine that in its basic form consists of a [[milling cutter]] that rotates about the spindle axis (like a [[drill]]), and a [[worktable]] that can move in multiple directions (usually two dimensions [x and y axis] relative to the workpiece). The spindle usually moves in the z axis.  It is possible to raise the table (where the workpiece rests).  Milling machines may be operated manually or under [[computer numerical control]] (CNC), and can perform a vast number of complex operations, such as slot cutting, [[planer (metalworking)|planing]], [[drilling and threading]], [[rabbet]]ing, [[wood router|routing]], etc. Two common types of mills are the horizontal mill and vertical mill.

The pieces produced are usually complex 3D objects that are converted into x, y, and z coordinates that are then fed into the [[CNC]] machine and allow it to complete the tasks required.  The milling machine can produce most parts in 3D, but some require the objects to be rotated around the x, y, or z coordinate axis (depending on the need).  Tolerances come in a variety of standards, depending on the locale. In countries still using the imperial system, this is usually in the thousandths of an inch (Unit known as Thou), depending on the specific machine. In many other European countries, standards following the ISO are used instead.

In order to keep both the bit and material cool, a high temperature coolant is used.  In most cases the coolant is sprayed from a hose directly onto the bit and material.  This coolant can either be machine or user controlled, depending on the machine.

Materials that can be milled range from [[aluminum]] to stainless steel and almost everything in between.  Each material requires a different speed on the milling tool and varies in the amount of material that can be removed in one pass of the tool.  Harder materials are usually milled at slower speeds with small amounts of material removed.  Softer materials vary, but usually are milled with a high bit speed.

The use of a milling machine adds costs that are factored into the manufacturing process.  Each time the machine is used coolant is also used, which must be periodically added in order to prevent breaking bits.  A milling bit must also be changed as needed in order to prevent damage to the material.  Time is the biggest factor for costs.  Complex parts can require hours to complete, while very simple parts take only minutes.  This in turn varies the production time as well, as each part will require different amounts of time.

Safety is key with these machines.  The bits are traveling at high speeds and removing pieces of usually scalding hot metal.  The advantage of having a CNC milling machine is that it protects the machine operator.

===Turning===
[[File:SchlichtenDrehen.jpg|thumb|A lathe cutting material from a workpiece.]]
{{Main article|Turning}}

Turning is a metal cutting process for producing a cylindrical surface with a single point tool. The workpiece is rotated on a spindle and the cutting tool is fed into it radially, axially or both. Producing surfaces perpendicular to the workpiece axis is called facing. Producing surfaces using both radial and axial feeds is called profiling.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Schneider, George. [http://www.americanmachinist.com/304/Issue/Article/False/85333/Issue Chapter 4: Turning Tools and Operations], American Machinist, January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''lathe'' is a machine tool which spins a block or cylinder of material so that when [[abrasive]], cutting, or [[knurling|deformation tools]] are applied to the workpiece, it can be shaped to produce an object which has [[rotational symmetry]] about an [[axis of rotation]]. Examples of objects that can be produced on a lathe include [[candlestick]] holders, [[crankshaft]]s, [[camshaft]]s, and [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] mounts.

Lathes have four main components: the bed, the headstock, the carriage, and the tailstock.  The bed is a precise &amp; very strong base which all of the other components rest upon for alignment. The headstock's [[spindle (tool)|spindle]] secures the workpiece with a [[chuck (engineering)|chuck]], whose jaws (usually three or four) are tightened around the piece. The spindle rotates at high speed, providing the energy to cut the material. While historically lathes were powered by [[belt (mechanical)|belt]]s from a [[line shaft]], modern examples uses electric motors. The workpiece extends out of the spindle along the axis of rotation above the flat bed. The carriage is a platform that can be moved, precisely and independently parallel and perpendicular to the axis of rotation. A hardened [[tool bit|cutting tool]] is held at the desired height (usually the middle of the workpiece) by the toolpost. The carriage is then moved around the rotating workpiece, and the cutting tool gradually removes material from the workpiece. The tailstock can be slid along the axis of rotation and then locked in place as necessary. It may hold centers to further secure the workpiece, or cutting tools driven into the end of the workpiece.

Other operations that can be performed with a single point tool on a lathe are:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Chamfering: Cutting an angle on the corner of a cylinder.&lt;br /&gt;
Parting: The tool is fed radially into the workpiece to cut off the end of a part.&lt;br /&gt;
[[Threading (manufacturing)|Threading]]: A tool is fed along and across the outside or inside surface of rotating parts to produce external or internal [[Screw thread|threads]].&lt;br /&gt;
[[boring (manufacturing)|Boring]]: A single-point tool is fed linearly and parallel to the axis of rotation to create a round hole.&lt;br /&gt;
[[Drilling]]: Feeding the drill into the workpiece axially.&lt;br /&gt;
[[Knurling]]: Uses a tool to produce a rough surface texture on the work piece.  Frequently used to allow grip by hand on a metal part.

Modern computer numerical control (CNC) lathes and (CNC) machining centres can do secondary operations like milling by using driven tools. When driven tools are used the work piece stops rotating and the driven tool executes the machining operation with a rotating cutting tool.  The CNC machines use x, y, and z coordinates in order to control the turning tools and produce the product. Most modern day CNC lathes are able to produce most turned objects in 3D.

Nearly all types of metal can be turned, although more time &amp; specialist cutting tools are needed for [[Hardness|harder]] workpieces.

===Threading===
[[File:ThreadingTaps.jpg|thumb|Three different types and sizes of taps.]]
{{Main article|Threading (manufacturing)}}

There are many threading processes including: cutting threads with a [[tap and die|tap or die]], thread milling, single-point thread cutting, thread rolling, cold root rolling and forming, and thread grinding. A ''tap'' is used to cut a female thread on the inside surface of a pre-drilled hole, while a ''die'' cuts a male thread on a preformed cylindrical rod.

===Grinding===
[[File:Scheibe im eingriff.jpg|thumb|left|A surface grinder]]
{{Main article|Grinding (abrasive cutting)}}

''Grinding'' uses an abrasive process to remove material from the workpiece.  A '''grinding machine''' is a machine tool used for producing very fine finishes, making very light cuts, or high precision forms using an [[grinding wheel|abrasive wheel]] as the cutting device. This wheel can be made up of various sizes and types of stones, [[diamond]]s or [[inorganic]] materials.

The simplest grinder is a bench grinder or a hand-held angle grinder, for deburring parts or cutting metal with a zip-disc.

Grinders have increased in size and complexity with advances in time and technology. From the old days of a manual toolroom grinder sharpening endmills for a production shop, to today's 30000 RPM CNC auto-loading manufacturing cell producing jet turbines, grinding processes vary greatly.

Grinders need to be very rigid machines to produce the required finish. Some grinders are even used to produce glass scales for positioning CNC machine axis. The common rule is the machines used to produce scales be 10 times more accurate than the machines the parts are produced for.

In the past grinders were used for finishing operations only because of limitations of tooling. Modern grinding wheel materials and the use of industrial diamonds or other man-made coatings (cubic boron nitride) on wheel forms have allowed grinders to achieve excellent results in production environments instead of being relegated to the back of the shop.

Modern technology has advanced grinding operations to include CNC controls, high material removal rates with high precision, lending itself well to aerospace applications and high volume production runs of precision components.

===Filing===
{{Main article|Filing (metalworking)}}
[[File:Surface of a file.jpg|thumb|A file is an abrasive surface like this one that allows machinists to remove small, imprecise amounts of metal.]]

''Filing'' is combination of grinding and saw tooth cutting using a [[file (tool)|file]]. Prior to the development of modern machining equipment it provided a relatively accurate means for the production of small parts, especially those with flat surfaces.  The skilled use of a file allowed a [[machinist]] to work to fine tolerances and was the hallmark of the craft.  Files can vary in shape, coarseness, and whether the teeth or single cut or double cut depending on what application the file is to be used for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.simondsint.com/handfiles/HAND%20FILES%20PUBLICATIONS/File%20Facts.pdf|title=Facts On Files: Including Helpful Tips And Proper Filing Techniques|last=|first=|date=2017-08-02|website=Simonds International|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today filing is rarely used as a production technique in industry, though it remains as a common method of [[deburr]]ing.

===Other===
[[Broaching (metalworking)|Broaching]] is a machining operation used to cut [[Keyway (engineering)|keyway]]s into shafts. [[Electron beam machining]] (EBM) is a machining process where high-velocity electrons are directed toward a work piece, creating heat and vaporizing the material. [[Ultrasonic machining]] uses [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] vibrations to machine very hard or brittle materials.

== Joining processes ==
[[File:GMAW.welding.af.ncs.jpg|thumb|Mig welding]]

===Welding===
{{Main article|Welding}}

''Welding'' is a [[fabrication (metal)|fabrication]] process that joins materials, usually metals or [[thermoplastic]]s, by causing [[wikt:coalesce|coalescence]].  This is often done by [[melting]] the workpieces and adding a filler material to form a pool of molten material that cools to become a strong joint, but sometimes pressure is used in conjunction with [[heat]], or by itself, to produce the weld.

Many different energy sources can be used for welding, including a gas [[fire|flame]], an [[electric arc]], a laser, an [[electron]] beam, [[friction]], and [[ultrasound]].  While often an industrial process, welding can be done in many different environments, including open air, [[underwater welding|underwater]] and in [[Outer space|space]].  Regardless of location, however, welding remains dangerous, and precautions must be taken to avoid burns, [[electric shock]], poisonous fumes, and overexposure to [[ultraviolet light]].

===Brazing===
{{Main article|Brazing}}

''Brazing'' is a joining process in which a filler metal is melted and drawn into a [[capillary action|capillary]] formed by the assembly of two or more work pieces.  The filler metal reacts metallurgically with the workpiece(s) and solidifies in the capillary, forming a strong joint.  Unlike welding, the work piece is not melted.  Brazing is similar to soldering, but occurs at temperatures in excess of {{convert|450|C|abbr=on}}.  Brazing has the advantage of producing less thermal stresses than welding, and brazed assemblies tend to be more ductile than weldments because alloying elements can not segregate and precipitate.

Brazing techniques include, flame brazing, resistance brazing, furnace brazing, diffusion brazing, inductive brazing and vacuum brazing.

===Soldering===
{{Main article|Soldering}}
[[File:Soldering-PCB-b.jpg|thumb|Soldering a printed circuit board.]]

''Soldering'' is a joining process that occurs at temperatures below {{convert|450|C|abbr=on}}. It is similar to brazing in the way that a filler is melted and drawn into a capillary to form a join, although at a lower temperature. Because of this lower temperature and different alloys used as fillers, the metallurgical reaction between filler and work piece is minimal, resulting in a weaker joint.

===Riveting===
{{Main article|Rivet}}

''Riveting'' is one of the most ancient metalwork joining processes. Its use has declined markedly during the second half of the 20th century, but it still retains important uses in industry and construction, and in artisan crafts such as [[jewellery]], [[medieval armouring]] and [[Metal Couture]] into the 21st century. The earlier use of rivets is being superseded by improvements in [[welding]] and component [[Fabrication (metal)|fabrication]] techniques.

A [[rivet]] is essentially a two-headed and unthreaded [[Screw|bolt]] which holds two other pieces of metal together. Holes are [[drill]]ed or [[punch (tool)|punch]]ed through the two pieces of metal to be joined. The holes being aligned, a rivet is passed through the holes and permanent heads are formed onto the ends of the rivet utilizing hammers and forming dies (by either [[cold]]working or [[hotworking]]).
Rivets are commonly purchased with one head already formed.

When it is necessary to remove rivets, one of the rivet's heads is sheared off with a [[chisel|cold chisel]]. The rivet is then driven out with a [[hammer]] and [[punch (tool)|punch]].

==Associated processes==
While these processes are not primary metalworking processes, they are often performed before or after metalworking processes.

=== Heat treatment ===
{{Main article|Heat treatment}}

Metals can be heat treated to alter the properties of strength, ductility, toughness, hardness or resistance to corrosion.  Common heat treatment processes include [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]], [[precipitation hardening]], [[quenching]], and [[tempering (metallurgy)|tempering]].  The '''annealing''' process softens the metal by allowing recovery of cold work and grain growth.  '''Quenching''' can be used to harden alloy steels, or in precipitation hardenable alloys, to trap dissolved solute atoms in solution.  '''Tempering''' will cause the dissolved alloying elements to precipitate, or in the case of quenched steels, improve impact strength and ductile properties.

Often, mechanical and thermal treatments are combined in what is known as thermo-mechanical treatments for better properties and more efficient processing of materials.  These processes are common to high alloy special steels, super alloys and titanium alloys.

=== Plating ===
{{Main article|Plating}}

[[Electroplating]] is a common surface-treatment technique. It involves bonding a thin layer of another metal such as [[gold]], [[silver]], [[chromium]] or [[zinc]] to the surface of the product by hydrolysis. It is used to reduce corrosion, create abrasion resistance and improve the product's aesthetic appearance. Plating can even change the properties of the original part including conductivity, heat dissipation or structural integrity. There are four main electroplating methods to ensure proper coating and cost effectiveness per product: mass plating, rack plating, continuous plating and line plating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.electrum.ca/en/news2.php|title=News &amp; Events : Plating &amp; Electroplating|website=Electrum|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thermal spraying ===
{{Main article|Thermal spraying}}

Thermal spraying techniques are another popular finishing option, and often have better high temperature properties than electroplated coatings due to the thicker coating. The four main thermal spray processes include electric wire arc spray, flame (oxy acetylene combustion) spray, plasma spray and high velocity oxy fuel (HVOF) spray.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.precisioncoatings.com/what-is-thermal-spray.html|title=Thermal Spray, Plasma Spray, HVOF, Flame Spray, Metalizing  &amp; Thermal Spray Coating - Saint Paul, Minnesota|website=www.precisioncoatings.com|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[contract law]], a '''mistake''' is an erroneous belief, ''at contracting'', that certain facts are true.  It can be argued as a defense, and if raised successfully can lead to the agreement in question being found [[Void (law)|void ''ab initio'']] or [[voidable]], or alternatively an equitable remedy may be provided by the courts. Common law has identified three different types of mistake in contract: the 'unilateral mistake', the 'mutual mistake' and the 'common mistake'.  The distinction between the 'common mistake' and the 'mutual mistake' is important.

Another breakdown in contract law divides mistakes into four traditional categories: unilateral mistake, mutual mistake, mistranscription, and misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = "Mistake in Contract Law" by Melvin A. Eisenberg|url = http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/californialawreview/vol91/iss6/3/|website = scholarship.law.berkeley.edu|access-date = 2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
'''Mistake''' can be-
(1) Mistake of Law; or
(2) Mistake of Fact

'''Mistake of law''': when a party enters into a contract, without the knowledge of the law in the country, the contract is affected by such mistakes but it is not void. The reason here is that ignorance of law is not an excuse. However, if a party is ''induced'' to enter into a contract by the mistake of law then such a contract is not valid.&lt;ref&gt;Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Lincoln City Council&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Illustration''': Harjoth and Danny make a contract grounded on the erroneous belief that a particular debt is barred by the Indian law of Limitation; the contract is not voidable.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

'''Mistake of Fact''': Where both the parties enter into an agreement are under a mistake as to a matter of fact essential to the agreement, the agreement is void.

'''Explanation''': An erroneous opinion as to the value of the thing which forms the subject-matter of the agreement is not to be deemed a mistake as to a matter of fact.{{R|"McRae v Commonwealth"}}

'''Illustration''': A sells a cow to B for $80 because it is an infertile cow. The cow is actually pregnant and worth $1000. The contract is void.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood v. Walker (MI).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anti-Illustration''': Lady found a stone and sold it as a Topaz for $1 ($25 today). It was a raw uncut diamond worth $700 (today $17,000). The contract is not voidable. There was no mistake because neither party knew what the stone was.&lt;ref&gt;Wood v. Boynton (WI)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unilateral mistakes==
{{Contract law}}
A unilateral mistake is where only one party to a contract is mistaken as to the terms or subject-matter contained in a contract.&lt;ref name="Taylor v Johnson"/&gt; This kind of mistake is more common than other types of mistake. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}} One must first distinguish between mechanical calculations and business error when looking at unilateral mistake. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Ordinarily, unilateral mistake does not make a contract void.&lt;ref name="Kubasek"/&gt;  Traditionally, [[Caveat Emptor]] (let the buyer beware), and under Common Law [[Caveat emptor#Caveat venditor|Caveat Venditor]] (let the seller beware).

===Exceptions===

A contract might be voidable from unilateral mistake for any of the following:

:(1)  One party relied on a statement of the other about a material fact that the second party knew or should have known was mistaken by the first party.&lt;ref name="Kubasek"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kubasek|first1=Nancy|last2=Browne|first2=M. Neil|last3=Heron|first3=Daniel|last4=Dhooge|first4=Lucien|last5=Barkacs|first5=Linda|title=Dynamic Business Law: The Essentials|date=2016|page=227|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9781259415654|edition=3d|url=http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0073524972/information_center_view0/table_of_contents.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:(2)  “clerical error that did not result in [[gross negligence]]”&lt;ref name="Kubasek"/&gt;

::For mechanical calculations, a party may be able to set aside the contract on these grounds provided that the other party does not try to take advantage of the mistake, or 'snatch up' the offer (involving a bargain that one did not intend to make, betrayed by an error in arithmetic etc.). This will be seen by an objective standard, or if a reasonable person would be able to know that the mistake would not make sense to one of the parties. Unless one of the parties 'snatched up' the one-sided offer, courts will otherwise uphold the contract.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

:(3)  The mistake was “[[Unconscionability|unconscionable]]”, i.e. so serious and unreasonable to be outrageous.&lt;ref name="Kubasek"/&gt;

==Mutual mistake==
A mutual mistake occurs when the parties to a contract are both mistaken about the same ''material'' fact within their contract. They are at cross-purposes. There is a meeting of the minds, but the parties are mistaken. Hence the contract is voidable. ''Collateral'' mistakes will not afford the right of rescission. A collateral mistake is one that 'does not go to the heart' of the contract. For a mutual mistake to be void, then the item the parties are mistaken about must be ''material'' (emphasis added). When there is a material mistake about a material aspect of the contract, the essential purpose of the contract, there is the question of the assumption of the risk. Who has the risk contractually? Who bears the risk by custom? Restatement (Second) Contracts Sec. 154 deals with this scenario.

This is easily confused with [[mutual assent]] cases such as ''Raffles v Wichelhaus''.{{R|"Raffles v Wichelhaus"}}

In ''Raffles'', there was an agreement to ship goods on a vessel named ''Peerless'', but each party was referring to a different vessel. Therefore, each party had a different understanding that they did not communicate about when the goods would be shipped.

In this case, both parties believed there was a "meeting of the minds," but discovered that they were each mistaken about the other party's different meaning. This represents not a mutual mistake but a failure of mutual assent. In this situation, no contract has been formed, since mutual assent is required in the formation stage of contract.  Restatement (Second) Contracts Sec. 20 deals with this scenario.

==Common mistake==
A common mistake is where both parties hold the same mistaken belief of the facts.

The [[House of Lords]] case of ''[[Bell v Lever Brothers Ltd.]]''{{R|"Bell v Lever Brothers Ltd"}} established that common mistake can void a contract only if the mistake of the subject-matter was sufficiently fundamental to render its identity different from what was contracted, making the performance of the contract impossible.

Later in ''Solle v Butcher'',{{R|"Solle v Butcher"}} [[Lord Denning]] added requirements for common mistake in equity, which loosened the requirements to show common mistake. However, since that time, the case has been heavily criticized in cases such as ''[[Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd]]''.{{R|"Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd"}}. For Australian application of Great Peace Shipping (other than in [[Queensland]]), see ''Svanosio v McNamara''.{{R|"Svanosio v McNamara"}}  For Queensland, see ''Australian Estates v Cairns City Council''.{{R|"Australian Estates v Cairns City Council"}}

Those categories of mistake in the United States exist as well, but it is often necessary to identify whether the error was a "decisional mistake," which is a mistake as a matter of law (faced with two known choices, making the wrong one), or an "ignorant mistake," unaware of the true state of affairs.

The difference is in the extent to which an innocent in the information chain, passing along or using or processing incorrect information, becomes liable. There is a principle that an entity or person cannot be made more liable merely by being in the information chain and passing along information taken in good faith in the belief that it was true, or at least without knowledge of the likelihood of falsity or inaccuracy.

===''Roswell State Bank v. Lawrence Walker Cotton Co.''===
Under [[New Mexico]] law a bank, title company, document processing firm, or the like is not liable for false information provided to it, any more than a bank was liable for false information from a trusted customer turned embezzler who drew an unauthorized cashier’s check. ''Roswell State Bank v. Lawrence Walker Cotton Co.'', 56 N.M. 107, 240 P.2d 143 (1952):

‘A thing is done “in good faith” within the meaning of this act, when it is in fact done honestly, whether it be done negligently or not.
‘…
‘…[a] transferee is not bound to inquire whether the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary in transferring the instrument, and is not chargeable with notice that the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary unless he takes the instrument with actual knowledge of such breach or with knowledge of such facts that his action in taking the instrument amounts to bad faith.’

56 N.M. at 112-113 (quoting from the Uniform Fiduciaries Act{{R|"Uniform Fiduciaries Act"}}).

===''Davis v. Pennsylvania Co. 337 Pa. 456''===
Roswell was the case of first impression on this issue in the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[New Mexico]], and drew on cases in other jurisdictions interpreting the same language, most notably ''Davis v. Pennsylvania Co. 337 Pa. 456'', 12 A.2d 66 (1940), which on similar facts to Roswell came to the same conclusion and exonerated the innocent actor in favor of shifting any responsibility for the loss to tortfeasors and those who enabled them to act by giving them unjustified authority. 56 N.M. at 114.

The Davis case leads into another good analysis, in a case relied upon by Davis:

:‘At what point does negligence cease and bad faith begin? The distinction between them is that bad faith, or dishonesty, is, unlike negligence, wilful. The mere failure to make inquiry, even though there be suspicious circumstances, does not constitute bad faith, unless said failure is due to the deliberate desire to evade knowledge because of a belief or fear that inquiry would disclose a vice or defect in the transaction, – that is to say, where there is an intentional closing of the eyes or stopping of the ears.’

===''Union Bank &amp; Trust Co.v. Girard Trust Co.''===
''Union Bank &amp; Trust Co.v. [[Girard Trust Co.]]'', 307 Pa. 468, 500-501, 161 A.2d 865 (1932).

:A firm processing information in order to transfer title using information provided by customers lacked the intent to commit illegal or improper acts when the information furnished to it was wrong. It was not part of its job description to know better, and it did not know better, and charged only a nominal fee for the clerical work, clearly not including any investigation. Further, it could not be in a conspiracy with another party or several parties who knew the information was wrong but failed to inform the title firm. The title firm could not unknowingly become part of a conspiracy of which it was never informed, and from which it could derive no benefit. The attempt to enhance liability or shift blame by filtering data through an innocent party has been tried before, but where the conduit providing document preparation does not know more than its informants, and was not hired or paid to investigate, it is not liable in their place for using their bad facts without guilty knowledge.

===''Hynix Semiconductor America, Inc. v. United States''===
The law governing record-keeping mistakes and how they are corrected has been gathered by the U.S. Court of International Trade in ''Hynix Semiconductor America, Inc. v. United States'', 414 F. Supp. 2d 1317 (C.I.T. 2006), in which the Court was faced with application of a tariff which had been calculated at the wrong rate by a customs clerk. To enforce "anti-dumping" legislation against foreign-made goods (in this case, Korean electronic components) made using cheap labor and undercutting American industry, a regulatory scheme was implemented under which such imports were charged a “liquidation duty” at a rate to be found on a schedule. The schedule had been made up by a panel of experts using standards for adjusting the price differential in the overseas goods. The custom clerk used the wrong category of goods and overcharged the duty, and by the time Hynix figured out what had happened, part of a very short statute of limitations on protest had expired. Hynix nevertheless prevailed and received the correction in its tariff rate by showing that such an error “…was correctable under 19 U.S.C. § 1520(c) as a mistake of fact or clerical error not amounting to an error in the construction of a law, and because the failure to file a protest within ninety days of the liquidation of the entries is without legal consequence in this context …” Id. at 1319.

The ''Hynix'' court explains the difference between a mistake of law “…where the facts are known but the legal consequences are not, or are believed to be different than they really are…,” ''Century Importers, Inc. v. United States'', 205 F.3d 1308, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2000), and a mistake of fact, “…where either (1) the facts exist, but are unknown, or (2) the facts do not exist as they are believed to [exist],” quoting ''Hambro Auto. Corp. v. United States'', 66 C.C.P.A. 113, 118, C.A.D. 1231, 603 F.2d 850, 853 (1979) (“A mistake of fact is any mistake except a mistake of law.” Id. at 855) Hynix, 414 F. Supp. 2d. at 1325.

''Hynix'', in reviewing the tariff application to the facts, also provided a guided tour of the different kinds of mistake and how they are treated in the federal court system. The key distinction is between “decisional mistakes” and “ignorant mistakes.” Id. at 1326; ''G &amp; R Produce Co, v. U.S.'', 281 F. Supp. 2d 1323, 1331 (2003); ''Prosegur, Inc. v. U.S.'', 140 F. Supp. 2d 1370, 1378 (2001); ''Universal Cooperatives, Inc. v. United States'', 715 F. Supp. 1113, 1114 (1989).

‘Decisional mistakes are mistakes of law and occur when “…a party [makes] the wrong choice between two known, alternative sets of facts.” ''Universal Cooperatives'', (citation partly omitted), 715 F. Supp. at 1114. On the other hand, an ignorant mistake occurs where “…a party is unaware of the existence of the correct alternative set of facts.” Id. “In order for the goods to be reliquidated under 1520 (c) (1), the alleged mistake of fact must be an ignorant mistake.” Prosegur, (citation partly omitted), 140 F. Supp. 2d at 1378.’ ''Hynix'' at 1326.

''Hynix'' provided one more criterion, and that is “materiality,” citing to extensive development of that requirement in ''Degussa Canada Ltd. v. United States'', 87 F.3d 1301, 1304 (Fed. Cir. 1996), and ''Xerox Corp. v. United States'', 2004 C.I.T. (Sept. 8, 2004) (“[A] mistake of fact … is a factual error that, if the correct fact had been known, would have resulted in a different classification.”) The error must be “material” in order to be corrected without consequence.

The [[Furniture]] industry was developed many times in [[Egypt]] from the old ancient to now. During 1st 30 years of the 20th century, there was a great furniture developments in Europe from [[transitional furniture]] to Modern tastes ("[[Modernism]]"). Egyptian were influenced by these movements which was a mix of many different styles. Fahim ElGindy was the leader of this development in [[Egypt]]. He demonstrated his art in [[Europe]] and Egypt. He established the furniture industry in [[Damietta]].

== Personal ==

His full name is '''Mohamed  Fahim  AlSayed  AbdAlla  Ahmed  ElGindy'''.  He was an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]]. He was born in 1880 in Damiatta. He died on 29 April 1959 in Cairo. His Family is one of the most famous family in Turkey and Arabic Countries.

== Achievements ==

He was known as ''' Fahim ElGindy'''. He was the man who established and developed the industry of furniture during the 20th century in  [[Damietta]]  and [[Egypt]].  In 1926, he got the Kingdom Golden Prize from the Conference of Industrial and Agriculture of Fabricating the Furniture in Cairo. Also, He was the first Arab who got Diplomas and golden medals from [[Rome|Roma]] and [[Paris]] for his wonderful art and initiations in fabricating the furniture in 1926. 

He was a pioneer in establishing the Furniture Industry. He learnt this art to many manufacturers who are very famous now in Egypt. He made two furniture centers. The first was in Damietta in 1910. The second was in Cairo in 1920. During the second Conference of Furniture Industry in Damietta in 1986, the Egyptian government appropriated his efforts by providing a certificate to his name.

'''[[His Excellency|H.E.]] Mohammad Abdallah Al Gaz''' (c. 1930-2016) &lt;ref&gt;The name is alternatively spelt "Al Kaz," "Al Qaz," and "Al-Gaz."&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ar|معالي محمد عبدالله القاز الفلاسي }}), was an influential financier, developer, diplomat, central banker and philanthropist in the early years of the United Arab Emirates. A scion of the [[House of Al-Falasi]], Al Gaz rose to prominence in the 1950s as a member of Dubai's first generation of market-making investors and developers through his partnership with [[Juma al Majid|H.E. Juma Al Majid]], himself recently ranked among the 100 Richest Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbesmiddleeast.com/en/lists/people/pname/juma-al-majid/pid/13171/|title=The World's Richest Arabs|publisher=|accessdate=23 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161124024651/http://www.forbesmiddleeast.com/en/lists/people/pname/juma-al-majid/pid/13171/|archivedate=24 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Sheikh]] [[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan]] presented Al Gaz with the Spirit of the Union Award for his contributions toward the early development of the UAE.

[[File:MFM1.jpg|thumb|right|HH Sheikh Zayed of Abu Dhabi, HH Sheikh Rashid of Dubai, and HE Mohammad Al Gaz shortly after Unification.]]

==Partnership in the Gold Trade==

Emerging as an enterprising trader in textiles and commodities between markets in the Middle East, Al Gaz entered the historic Switzerland-Dubai-India gold trade in the 1950s after recruiting and partnering with his then-grocer and friend, Juma Al Majid. Partnerships such as those between the brothers [[Saif Ahmad Al Ghurair]] and [[Abdulla Al Ghurair]], between cousins [[Majid Al Futtaim]] and [[Abdulla Al Futtaim]], and that between Al Gaz and Al Majid served as the economic foundation for the aggressive vision of H.H. Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed, who assumed formal rule in 1958.

The close-knit support between government, in the singular form of Sheikh Rashid, and business, represented by the lucrative and highly industrious work of these partnerships, led to a period of growth and stability unseen in Dubai's history. This particularly contrasted to the difficulties Sheikh Rashid's predecessor, Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum, experienced in the  1930s with the disloyal pearl merchants who dominated Dubai's then pearl-based, fishing trade, and caused the Rebellion of 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher M. Davidson, "Arab Nationalism and British Opposition in Dubai, 1920-66," ''Middle Eastern Studies'' 2007 43(6): 879-892&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the new gold tycoons, Mohammad Al Gaz became a particularly trusted diplomatic adviser to Sheikh Rashid. In addition to offering steady economic insights into the booming hustle of Dubai's markets, because of his close relationship to rulers in the region, particularly with the aspiring leader of Abu Dhabi, H.H. Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, Al Gaz was used as an initial diplomatic channel between Dubai and Abu Dhabi. During a time when protracted zero-sum land negotiations were the highlights of the diplomatic relationship, Al Gaz helped to unite the two leaders' vision for solidarity and union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Records of Dubai 1761-1960|editor=A.

The Indian gold trade fell out of vogue with the partnerships in the early 1970s. With the dawn of a new nation, Al Gaz and his partner Al Majid led the way in a push to direct their investments into projects that brought know-how or infrastructure to Dubai's optimistic future. Betting on long-term growth in Dubai, as the regional trading hub to overtake its then-far more developed rivals in Kuwait and Bahrain, Al Gaz and Al Majid invested heavily in securing franchise rights and developing real estate projects. Al Gaz and Al Majid secured distribution or exclusive franchise rights to international brands in Dubai, including General Electric, Samsung, Phillips, Opel, Pepsi, Nissan, Hyundai, and Kia.

After 11 years of partnership, Al Gaz and himself split their assets on a basis that they easily agreed was equal, despite having both maintained little accounting record or valuations for their empire. Reflecting in later years, Al Majid was proud to note theirs was the only Dubai trading empire of the age to split amicably,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/business/sectors/features/juma-al-majid-a-life-in-service-1.717158|title=A Life in Service|publisher=Gulf News|accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Al Futtaim partnership being a prime example of the bitter empire battles that had become the rule in the ending of the major partnerships.

Unlike Al Majid, Al Gaz divested from the majority of his franchise holdings (e.g. selling franchise rights to Nissan in the 1980s) to concentrate on real estate development. Having already distinguished himself in building the first three-story building in Dubai's history, Al Gaz went on to develop much of the properly around Port Said, the clock-tower plaza, and Hamriya in Bur Deira, helping to create the infrastructure for what has become the vibrant Deira market place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alkhaleej.ae/supplements/page/0e825417-f468-4ff1-8b0e-e8b66602767d|title=محمد عبد الله القاز.. العصامي الذي بنى لنفسه مجداً|date=2016-06-28|publisher=Al Khaleej|accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal Roles and Philanthropy==

Post-federation, Al Gaz helped found the National Council&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emaratalyoum.com/local-section/other/2016-04-15-1.888573|title=محمد عبدالله القاز أحد أوائل رجال الأعمال والسياسة في الإمارات. الإمارات اليوم|publisher=Emarat Alyoum|accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and served as the first Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank of the UAE, from the Bank's founding in 1980 into the mid-1990s. Serving under the Chairman Sheikh Suroor bin Mohammad Al Nahyan, Al Gaz was a key stakeholder in the UAE’s economic development in its first two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alkhaleej.ae/supplements/page/60ff3a48-3855-4a56-b0a9-995c33de0793|title=محمد عبد الله القاز.. العصامي الذي بنى لنفسه مجداً|date=2016-06-28|publisher=Al Khaleej|accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DCFUPLOAD2.jpg|frame|left|The President, H.H. Sheikh Khalifa presenting Abdallah Mohammad Al Gaz with the Spirit of the Union Award on the behalf of his father, 2012.]]

As a leader of the first generation of Dubai business magnates to form after the crises of the 1930s, Al Gaz made efforts to break tradition with earlier pearling merchants who used financial pressure to destabilize government in Dubai. Where formerly rich pearl traders Rashid bin Dalmook and Sheikh Mani bin Rashid used tight public funding in education as an excuse for the Rebellion of 1938, Al Gaz aggressively fueled private investment in public education with a number of early-built schools, including the Amna bint Wahb Girls School, the Gamal Abdulnasser Boys School, and the Community Schools. Targeting areas in need philanthropically, Al Gaz continued to endow public and private institutions anonymously, in Islamic tradition, until he developed with Juma Al Majid the United Arab Emirates' first charitable society in 1989, Beit Al Khair.

On April 12, 2016, Mohammed Al Gaz died of cardiovascular failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albayan.ae/across-the-uae/news-and-reports/2016-04-15-1.2618554|title=محمد القاز.. سجل وطني وسيرة حافلة بالعطاء|first=دبي - رامي عايش وسعيد|last=الوشاحي|date=15 April 2016|publisher=|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Succeeded by eight sons, Al Gaz relinquished the control and management of his holding firm to his eldest son, Abdallah Al Gaz, during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zawya.com/cm/profile.cfm/cid730440//United%20Arab%20Agencies|title=United Arab Agencies Inc - Zawya|publisher=|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Department of Defense ==

Brinkley accepted an appointment as Deputy Undersecretary of Defense in 2004.

=== Business Transformation Agency ===

In partnership with Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Financial Management [[Thomas Modly]], Brinkley consolidated Department-wide business systems used by the [[Department of the Army]], [[Department of the Navy]] and [[Department of the Air Force]] into the [[Business Transformation Agency]]. The work of the Business Transformation Agency was lauded by the [[Government Accountability Office]]&lt;ref&gt;http://fcw.com/articles/2006/03/27/business-transformation-is-turning-heads.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; for streamlining departmental business systems.

=== Task Force for Business and Stability Operations ===

In 2006, under the direction of [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Gordon R. England|Gordon England]], Brinkley established the [[Task Force for Business and Stability Operations]], charged with restoring normal economic activity in Iraq during widespread conflict in the [[Iraq War]], and to streamline and transform the Department's contracting process and systems in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;https://files.secureserver.net/0sqvhCwlN6rqS8&lt;/ref&gt; While interdepartmental disagreements took place given the nature of the TFBSO's directives,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/13/AR2007051301165.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://money.cnn.com/2007/08/31/magazines/fortune/iraq_inc.fortune/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; the task force focused on making business development a component of a broader military counter-insurgency.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/MH05Df02.html&lt;/ref&gt;  At its peak in Iraq, TFBSO had over 350 professionals deployed in every province of the country, including large numbers of civilian business leaders and agriculture experts from the American private sector and academia.&lt;ref name="csis"&gt;http://csis.org/publication/final-report-lessons-learned&lt;/ref&gt; Over 200 international companies visited Iraq as part of the foreign direct investment initiative sponsored by TFBSO, with 80 initiating business activity as a result of their engagement. The Task Force directly facilitated over $8 billion in foreign direct investment.

In 2009, the TFBSO began work supporting the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|United States mission in Afghanistan]], placing heavy focus on rapid development of mining resources with a goal of imposing environmental and socially responsible processes for the Afghan government to finance its own security and development. TFBSO also launched aggressive efforts to encourage foreign investment in other sectors, including agriculture and information technology.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/14/world/asia/14minerals.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fastcompany.com/1761397/google-ibm-youtube-and-kabul-pentagon-hosts-afghan-tech-entrepreneurs-us&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/09/01/in-afghanistan-roya-mahboob-connects-girls-with-computers.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-06/pentagon-s-brinkley-plays-afghan-matchmaker-for-ibm-jpmorgan.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its work in Afghanistan and Iraq, TFBSO projects supported the [[Embassy of the United States, Islamabad|US Embassy in Islamabad]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icci.com.pk/event/detail/322&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Africa Command]] in Rwanda and Sudan.

=== Recognition ===
Brinkley received the [[Distinguished Public Service Medal]], the highest civilian award conferred by the Department of Defense, for his service in establishing and leading the TFBSO.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.econstability.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Brinkley_Distinguished_Public_Service_Medal_28.06.2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He also received the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joint Distinguished Civilian Service Award|Joint Distinguished Civilian Service Award]], the highest civilian award conferred by the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], for his contributions to the stabilization of Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.econstability.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Brinkley_Joint_Distinguished_Civilian_Service_Award_22.03.2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, he received the Eagle Award, an annual award for the outstanding civilian information technology leader in the federal government, for his work leading defense business modernization.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.govhealthit.com/news/eagle-awards-go-baird-brinkley&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2010, Brinkley and four members of his team were meeting with a hotel manager when a powerful car bomb detonated 30 meters from their conference room in downtown Baghdad. The blast destroyed the building's exterior façade and shattered windows, causing numerous casualties. Despite sustaining significant concussive and shrapnel injuries requiring medical care, all five individuals returned to work virtually without interruption under hazardous security conditions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.econstability.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Medical-Consult.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/world/middleeast/26iraq.html&lt;/ref&gt; Brinkley and the four task force members received the [[Defense of Freedom Medal]], the civilian equivalent of the [[Purple Heart]], in response to this incident.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.econstability.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Defense_of_Freedom_Medal_Release_27.09.2010-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resignation ===
In May 2010, after four years of work in Iraq and Afghanistan, the work of the Task Force was ruled to be outside of the normal role of the Department of Defense under [[Title X]] of the [[United States Code]].  Months of Congressional engagement ensued, with [[Senate Armed Services Committee]] Chairman [[Carl Levin]] and Minority Leader [[John McCain]] urging Secretary of Defense Robert Gates in writing to retain the TFBSO.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.econstability.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/SASC-Letter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their intervention, Congress passed legislation in December 2010 to move the work of TFBSO into the [[United States Agency for International Development]] no later than October 2011 and immediately cease its operations in Iraq and Pakistan. The task force experienced subsequent resignations from most of its senior leadership. Citing inability to rebuild a leadership team for a mission limited to a six month term in Afghanistan, Brinkley resigned July 1, 2011, his departure date coinciding with the retirement of Robert Gates.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/defense-task-force-on-afghanistan-development-unravels/2011/03/22/ABe2PHSB_story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== North America Western Asia Holdings ==
In October 2011, Brinkley co-founded North America Western Asia Holdings (NAWAH), with [[Thomas Pritzker]] serving as co-founder and chairman. According to its mission statement, NAWAH will "respect the history of the nations in which it operates, their culture and their people; commit our own capital to build and sustain great companies; partner equally with regional companies, remaining personally and professionally vested in their long-term success (and will) require our employees, suppliers, and partners operate in a transparent manner, following the highest ethical and international business standards."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nawah.com&lt;/ref&gt; In October, 2012, NAWAH reached an agreement with the Iraqi government to invest up to $14 million to modernize operations at the [[Al-Maqal Port|Port of Maqal]] in the city of [[Basra]], which has been largely inoperable since the [[Iran–Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.porttechnology.org/news/iraq_signs_multi_million_dollar_deal_to_modernize_basras_maqal_port/&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, NAWAH announced the reopening of the port, marking less than one year during which NAWAH had rebuilt damaged port infrastructure and hired and trained an Iraqi workforce and management team. The port established a modern container terminal in the city center of Basra and provided a needed gateway for commercial goods into the growing Iraqi economy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nawah.com/nawah-modernizes-historic-port-of-basra/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other pursuits ==
=== ''War Front to Store Front'' ===
Brinkley is the author of ''War Front to Store Front: Americans Rebuilding Trust and Hope in Nations Under Fire'', published in 2014 by Turner Publishing. The book suggests changes to U.S. foreign policy in war-torn nations based on his seven years bridging the internal dynamics of the Pentagon with the conflict-zone realities of energizing international investment in Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bryen|first1=Shoshana|title=One Slice of the Iraq War|url=http://www.jewishpolicycenter.org/5215/war-front-to-store-front|accessdate=December 6, 2015|work=inFocusQuarterly|publisher=Jewish Policy Center|date=Spring 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brinkley presented the book at the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] in February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=War Front to Store Front: Americans Rebuilding Trust and Hope in Nations Under Fire|url=http://csis.org/event/war-front-store-front-americans-rebuilding-trust-and-hope-nations-under-fire|website=Center for Strategic and International Studies|accessdate=December 6, 2015|date=February 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act''' (ch. 27, {{USStat|22|403}}) is a [[United States federal law]] enacted in 1883 that mandated that positions within the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] should be awarded on the basis of merit instead of political affiliation.&lt;ref name=penl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=3&amp;psid=1098|title=Digital History|website=www.digitalhistory.uh.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act provided selection of government employees by competitive exams,&lt;ref name="penl" /&gt; rather than ties to politicians or political affiliation. It also made it illegal to fire or demote government officials for political reasons and prohibited soliciting campaign donations on Federal government property.&lt;ref name="penl" /&gt; To enforce the merit system and the judicial system, the law also created the [[United States Civil Service Commission]].&lt;ref name="penl" /&gt; This board would be in charge of determining the rules and regulations of the act.&lt;ref name=CS2014 /&gt; The act also allowed for the president, by executive order, to decide which positions would be subject to the act and which would not.&lt;ref name=CS2014 /&gt; A result was the shift of the parties to reliance on funding from business,&lt;ref name=Tragedy&gt;{{cite book|last=Quigley|first=Carroll|title=Tragedy and Hope: A History of the World in Our Time|year=1966|publisher=Macmillan Co.|location=San Pedro, CA|isbn=094500110X|pages=71|url=https://www.amazon.com/Tragedy-Hope-History-World-Time/dp/094500110X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347944945&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=tragedy+and+hope}}&lt;/ref&gt; since they could no longer depend on patronage.

== History ==
In 1877, there was growing interest in the United States concerning the effects of the [[spoils system]] on the American political system.&lt;ref name=CS2014 /&gt; [[New York City]] established the Civil Service Reform Association to help address the issues, which would lead to several other organizations like it appearing in other cities.&lt;ref name=CS2014&gt;{{cite book|title=Civil Service 2014|publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls New World Encyclopedia|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=1&amp;sid=0a1a74b1-da5a-4d83-9d8d-68f2d4ebbdca%40sessionmgr110&amp;hid=120&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#db=funk&amp;AN=CI149100|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of these organizations was one of the first steps in trying to up end the spoils system in America.

The [[assassination of James A. Garfield|assassination]] of President [[James A. Garfield]] moved the Civil Service Reform from city organizations to a leading topic in the political realm.&lt;ref name=CS2014 /&gt;  President Garfield was shot in July 1881 by [[Charles Guiteau]], because Guiteau believed the president owed him a patronage position for his "vital assistance" in securing [[United States presidential election, 1880|Garfield's election]] the previous year.&lt;ref name=TAP&gt;{{cite web|title=Life and Death in the White House|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/presidency/3d1d.html|website=The American Presidency|publisher=Smithsonian Natural Museum of American History|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garfield died two months later, and Vice President [[Chester A. Arthur]] acceded to the presidency.&lt;ref name=Study&gt;{{cite web|title=Gilded Age Politics: Political Machines &amp; Civil Service Reform|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/gilded-age-politics-political-machines-civil-service-reform.html|website=Study.Com|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once in office, President Arthur pushed through legislation for civil reform.&lt;ref name=Study /&gt;

On January 16, 1883 Congress passed the Civil Service Act, which is sometimes referred to as the Pendleton Act after Senator [[George H. Pendleton]] of [[Ohio]],&lt;ref name=CS2014 /&gt; one of the primary sponsors. The Act was written by [[Dorman Bridgman Eaton]], a staunch opponent of the patronage system who was later first chairman of the [[United States Civil Service Commission]].  However, the law would also prove to be a major political liability for Arthur.&lt;ref name="penl" /&gt;  The law offended [[Political machine|machine politicians]], or politicians who belong to a small clique that controls a political party.&lt;ref name=TFD&gt;{{cite web|title=Machine Politician|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/machine+politician|website=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These politicians realized that with the Pendleton Act in place they would have to find a new means of income, since they could no longer count on donations from the wealthy hoping to receive jobs.&lt;ref name=Study /&gt;

The Act initially covered only about 10% of the U.S. government's civilian employees.&lt;ref name="penl" /&gt;  However, there was a provision that allowed outgoing presidents to lock in their own appointees by converting jobs to civil service. After a series of party reversals at the presidential level (1884, 1888, 1892, 1896), the result was that most federal jobs were under civil service.

! Product !! Offering !! Type !! Recent version (EE) !! Recent version (CE) !!Description
|-
|'''Pentaho BA Platform''' || EE, CE || Server application || 7.1 || 7.1 || Commonly referred to as the BI Platform, and recently renamed Business Analytics Platform (BA Platform), makes up the core software piece that hosts content created both in the server itself through plug-ins or files published to the server from the desktop applications.  It includes features for managing security, running reports, displaying dashboards, report bursting, scripted business rules, OLAP analysis and scheduling out of the box.  &lt;br&gt;Commercial plug-ins from Pentaho expand out-of-the-box features.  A few open-source plug-in projects also expand capabilities of the server.  The Pentaho BA Platform runs in the Apache [[Application server#Java application servers|Java Application Server]].  It can be embedded into other Java Application Servers.

|-
| '''Pentaho Analysis Services (Mondrian)''' || EE, CE || Server application || 3.7.0 || [http://sourceforge.net/projects/mondrian/files/ 3.6.1] ||Pentaho Analysis Services, codenamed [[Mondrian OLAP server|Mondrian]],  is an [[open-source software|open-source]] [[Online analytical processing|OLAP]] (online analytical processing) [[Server (computing)|server]], written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]].
It supports the [[MultiDimensional eXpressions|MDX]] (multidimensional expressions) query language and the [[XML for Analysis]] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20150312031439/http://www.olap4j.org/ olap4j] interface specifications.  It reads from [[SQL]] and other data sources and aggregates data in a memory cache.  Mondrian can be run separately from the Pentaho BI Platform, but is always bundled with the platform itself in both EE and CE versions.

|-
| '''Pentaho Dashboard Designer (PDD)''' || EE || Server plug-in || 5.0.6 || - || A commercial plug-in provided to enterprise edition (EE) subscribers.  It allows users to create [[Dashboards (management information systems)|dashboards]], which are collections of other content components displayed together with the goal of providing a centralized view of [[Key performance indicator| key performance indicators (KPI)s]] and other business data movements, letting users monitor them and make decisions.  Content components are usually individual [[Information graphics]], tables, OLAP views or reports.  The plug-in simplifies dashboard creation through the use of layout templates, drag-and-drop interaction and a [[GUI]] for providing parameters and inputs to dashboard components.

|-
| '''Pentaho Analysis (Analyzer) (PAZ)''' || EE || Server plug-in || 5.0.6 || - || The Pentaho Analyzer plug-in provides a web-based, drag-and-drop OLAP viewer. It allows a user to visually create MDX queries by dragging parts of a previously defined Mondrian OLAP schema onto a canvas, where other activities can take place like filtering, sorting, creating calculated members from other measures, exporting the result table to PDF or MS Excel, and optionally graphing the data.  It is also known to work on Apple iPads by using the Safari web browser.
|-
| '''Pentaho Interactive Reporting (PIR)''' || EE || Server plug-in || 5.0.6 || - || This plug-in enables users to create [[ad hoc]] reports in a visual drag-and-drop fashion.
|-
| '''Pentaho Data Access Wizard''' ||EE, CE|| Server plug-in || - || - || This plug-in is bundled with all servers and allows users to create new data sources for use throughout the system from other databases or CSV files uploaded to the server while using a setup wizard.  During the steps of creating a data source users also are given a chance to create a data model describing how columns or fields relate to each other creating hierarchies of relationships like Time: Year, Quarters, Months, Weeks and Product Division, Category, Type etc.  The resultant model is used by Mondrian and any other plug-in like Analyzer or Saiku to create new queries against the newly created data source.  This component is part of what Pentaho introduces as agile BI, which simply means having a way to start from basic data and quickly iterate through steps to discover the proper way to structure, study and present the data.&lt;ref name="pentahodataaccess"&gt;Michael Terallo, Pentaho [http://www.pentahoevalcenter.com/content-creation-delivery/data-access-wizard/ Data Access Wizard] Retrieved July 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

| '''Pentaho Metadata Editor (PME)''' || EE, CE || Desktop application || 6.1 || The metadata editor is used to create business models and act as an abstraction layer from the underlying data sources.  The resulting metadata models are used by Pentaho Interactive Reporting, Saiku Reporting, and Pentaho's legacy AD HOC reporting plug-in applications to create reports within the BA server without using any of the other external desktop applications.
|-
| '''Pentaho Aggregate Designer (PAD)''' || EE, CE || Desktop application || 6.1 || Aggregate Designer operates on Pentaho Analysis (Mondrian) XML schema files and the database with the underlying tables described by the schema to generate precalculated, aggregated answers to speed up analysis work and MDX queries executed against Mondrian.  This is accomplished by the software examining the hierarchies described in the schema and the measures also defined there and generating SQL which would result in the creation of tables storing those answers away for future use by Mondrian.  After using the software to generate these aggregate tables, the original Mondrian XML schema file describing the OLAP cube is modified to reference the precomputed results.

|-
| '''Pentaho Design Studio (PDS)''' || EE, CE || Desktop application || [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pentaho/files/Design%20Studio/ 4.0] || The Pentaho BA Server supports special XML scripts called xactions to implement business logic and other forms of automation in the platform.  Design Studio is a modified version of the Eclipse Development Environment with a plug-in designed to understand the components supported by xaction scripts.  Xactions are very powerful, and useful, but sometimes prove difficult to troubleshoot because of the low-level way they interact with parts of the BA server.  Developers are starting to use Pentaho Data Integration transformation files to carry out automation and business logic tasks.  The transformations can be run directly by the BA Server and visually debugged in Pentaho Data Integration (PDI) and are quickly gaining favor in the community over xactions. It is a small leap to imagine PDI transformations will eventually replace xactions entirely.

Rami Makhlouf is related to the [[Assad family]] through his aunt, [[Anisa Makhlouf]], who was the wife of the late Syrian president [[Hafez al-Assad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/26/world/meast/assad-family/index.html?iref=allsearch

==Business activities==
Rami Makhlouf is the main owner of [[Syriatel]], one of two licensed mobile phone companies in Syria. Besides Syriatel, he is involved in real estate, banking, free trade zones along the border with [[Lebanon]], [[duty-free shop]]s, and luxury department stores.&lt;ref name=Bar395/&gt; According to the ''[[Financial Times]]'', he is thought to control as much as 60% of the Syrian economy through his web of business interests.&lt;ref name=ftpeel&gt;

Makhlouf was among a diverse group of connected insiders who monopolized the small, but growing, Syrian private sector in the 1990s. As President Hafez al-Assad prepared for his son's succession, the distribution of assets from privatization began to shift clearly in favor of the Makhloufs. Assad believed the [[Assad family#Anisa's siblings|Makhlouf family]] could be relied upon to support Bashar without reserve in the uncertain political environment that would follow upon his death, unlike other insiders, who had close financial ties to billionaire [[Lebanese Prime Minister]] [[Rafiq Hariri]], such as former Syrian Vice President [[Abdul Halim Khaddam]]. Rami and his brother Ihab therefore enjoyed easy access to opportunities such as an exclusive license to operate a network of duty-free retail shops, where a significant portion of goods were redistributed inside the country.

Rami Makhlouf is thought to have tried in 2004 to take over the [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] concession in Syria, by ensuring passage of a law denying Mercedes the right to import parts unless Makhlouf was made the exclusive agent for Mercedes in Syria. Mercedes wanted to keep the Sankar family, who had had the concession since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;

Makhlouf's current business interests are extensive. He is the majority owner of Cham Holding which has investments in luxury tourism, restaurants, and real estate through [[Bena Properties]]. Cham Holding also controls [[Syrian Pearl Airlines]], the first private airline to be allowed in the country. He is also invested in several private banks established in Syria, such as the International Islamic Bank of Syria, [[Al Baraka Banking Group|Al Baraka Bank]], [[International Bank of Qatar]], [[Cham Bank]], and the Bank of Jordan in Syria; in insurance and financial services companies, such as Cham Capital. Like his father, Mohammed Makhlouf, he is active in the [[Economy of Syria#Energy|oil sector]], via the [[United Kingdom|British]] oil company Gulfsands Petroleum. He is also invested in real estate companies such as [[Sorouh Real Estate|Sourouh]], Fajr, Al Batra, and Al Hada'iq; in tourism companies such as Al Mada'in and in media companies such as the daily ''[[Al-Watan (Syria)|Al Watan]]'',&lt;ref name=dany&gt;

Makhlouf maintains a close relationship with [[Bushra al-Assad]], Bashar's older sister, and her husband [[Assef Shawkat]]. He also operates a number of business projects in Lebanon with [[Maher al-Assad]], Bashar's younger brother. There are reports of tensions between the two, which is thought to explain why parts of the Makhlouf business were shifted in 2005 to [[Dubai]]. Some observers believe the transfers were made because the Makhloufs were worried that they were going to be made the scapegoats of an anti-corruption propaganda campaign.&lt;ref name="Bar395"/&gt;

On 5 July 2012, it was reported that the Central Bank of the [[UAE]] ordered the banks and financial institutions to search for and submit details of any financial assets and transactions performed by the Syrian ruling elite, including Rami Makhlouf.&lt;ref name=khaleej512&gt;

==Accusations of corruption==
In February 2008, the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] designated Makhlouf as a beneficiary and facilitator of public corruption in Syria. His influence and connections within the government have allowed him to control the issuance of certain types of profitable commodities contracts, it said.&lt;ref name="USTreasury" /&gt; According to the US Treasury, "Makhlouf has manipulated the Syrian judicial system and used Syrian intelligence officials to intimidate his business rivals. He employed these techniques when trying to acquire exclusive licenses to represent foreign companies in Syria and to obtain contract awards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Political observers generally accept that Makhlouf's great wealth is a result of his close family ties to the Syrian government. It is reported that Bashar al-Assad before he became president would during official meetings try to make business contacts for Rami.&lt;ref name="Bar395" /&gt; In [[United States diplomatic cables leak|US diplomatic cables leaked]] by [[WikiLeaks]], Rami Makhlouf is described as a powerful government financer.&lt;ref name=USEmbassy&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Makhlouf has further been accused of illegally diverting Lebanese telephone calls through Syria with the help of businessman Pierre Fattouch for the benefit of Syriatel.&lt;ref name="Bar395" /&gt;

Makhlouf controlled three Syrian companies close to the government of Bashar Al-Assad – Maxima Middle East Trading, Morgan Additives Manufacturing and Pangates International. These companies used Mossack Fonseca shell companies registered in the Seychelles and British Virgin Islands to ease the pressure global sanctions put on his cousin's regime. He paid for the [[Syrian Air Force]] helicopter fuel through shell companies, for example.&lt;ref name="AJSyria"&gt;{{cite news

Seif, a member of parliament and one of the most ardent critics of the Syrian government, became known outside of Syria because of his criticism of the government during the [[Damascus Spring]] of 2001. Despite several warnings from the Syrian government not to interfere, Seif began an anticorruption campaign in September 2001 against the way the two [[GSM]] mobile phone licenses were awarded, of which one to Maklouf's Syriatel. Shortly thereafter Seif lost his parliamentary immunity and was arrested and imprisoned for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

And they said, 'Oh, there is this bank who still does business with him, so we should still keep with him, as well'."

Some opposition activists during the Syrian Civil War accused Makhlouf of financing pro-government demonstrations both across Syria and abroad, by providing flags, meals and money for those participating. The tycoon insisted his businesses are legitimate and provide professional employment for thousands of Syrians.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13216195|title=Bashar al-Assad's inner circle|date=18 May 2011|work=BBC|accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boyd Raymond 'Ray' Borrill''' was founder of [[The Data Domain]], a retail computer store in [[Bloomington, Indiana]], and vice-president of [[itty bitty machine company]] retail computer store, December 1975 – 1980, located in [[Evanston, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Data Domain|url=http://www.applefritter.com/node/9626|quote="In February, 1976 Ray opened The Data Domain, one of the pioneering retail computer stores." (itty bitty machine co. in Evanston was open before Data Domain.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stores have their place in computer history as they are two of the first computer stores to sell the [[Apple I]] computer.  The dealer arrangement was made by [[Steve Jobs]].  The Data Domain is also believed to be the first to ever use the phrase "Personal Computer" commercially. These stores are the first retail outlets for personal computers. Items could be purchased as either complete assembled and tested, or as kits.

In 1975, Borrill was one of the participants of the Kansas City symposium, which established the [[Kansas City standard]], a standard format for recording data on audio [[Magnetic tape data storage|cassette tapes]]. The Kansas City standard format allowed for exchange of data between [[microcomputers]]. Many pioneers of the microcomputer industry, such as [[Bill Gates]] while working for [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems|MITS]], were also in attendance.

'''Recaredo Santos Tornero Olmos''' (October 14, 1842 – July 26, 1902) was a [[Chilean people|Chilean]] editor, journalist and director of ''[[El Mercurio de Valparaíso]]'' and founder of ''[[El Comercio (Chile)|El Comercio]]''.

== Biography ==
Tornero was born in [[Valparaíso]], on October 14, 1842. His parents were Carmen Olmos de Aguilera Orrego, and Spanish immigrant José Santos Tornero Monteros, the proprietary of the first public library in Chile. He studied in the National Institute of Santiago, and he later went to France to study on the [[Ecole Superieure de Commerce de Paris]]. He returned to Chile in 1860,&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt; and he succeeded his father as director of ''[[El Mercurio de Valparaíso]]'' in 1866.&lt;ref name="Historia, Geografía y Ciencias Sociales"&gt;{{cite book|title=Historia, Geografía y Ciencias Sociales 2° Educación Media|author=Verónica Méndez Montero, Carolina Santelices Ariztía and Rodrigo Martínez Iturriaga|language=Spanish|publisher=Santillana|year=2009|isbn=978-956-15-1557-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married Elena Stuven Olmos, and they had 4 children: Carmela, Recaredo, Teresa and Enrique.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;

His father's enterprises included the Spanish Library ({{lang-es|Librería Española}}), the [[printing house]] of ''[[El Mercurio]]'' and the [[Valparaíso]] newspaper of [[El Mercurio de Valparaíso|the same name]]. They remained in the family for 33 years. In 1866, Tornero and his brother Orestes bought the enterprise from their father.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;

Orestes maintained the library and its dependencies, while Recaredo continued administering the printing house and the newspaper.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt; Later, they formed Tornero &amp; Sons Society ({{lang-es|Sociedad Tornero e Hijos}}) with his father, who was living in outside Chile.&lt;ref name="Icarito"/&gt;

[[File:Chile Ilustrado main page.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Front page of ''[[Chile Ilustrado]]'' (1872).]]

Since 1867, Tornero was the only editor of ''[[El Mercurio de Valparaíso]]'' until 1870, when he partnered with Camilo Letelier.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt; Blanco Cuartín assumed as main editor of the newspaper later; who proposed a cultural and literary-scoped topic.&lt;ref name="Icarito"/&gt;

He published ''[[Chile Ilustrado]]'' in 1872, the first illustrated album of Chile, with a descriptive guide, historic, politic, industrial, social and statistical review of the country and a rich graphic backup,&lt;ref name="Historia, Geografía y Ciencias Sociales"/&gt; with more than 200 wood engravings and 10 lithographs.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt; He was awarded for this book on [[1876 Philadelphia Exposition]].&lt;ref name="Icarito"/&gt;

After 9 years as director, he sold his part of the newspaper to Camilo Letelier.&lt;ref name="Icarito"/&gt; He revisited Europe in 1877, where he stayed until 1880.&lt;ref name="Icarito"/&gt; He bought machinery in Europe to create the first paper factory in Chile, after which he began publishing foreign works translated into Spanish.&lt;ref name="Historia, Geografía y Ciencias Sociales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Icarito"&gt;{{Cite web

After his comeback to Valparaíso, Tornero established a library and a printing house in Almendral. When his brother Orestes died in 1881, he took over Mercurio library, that was mainly focused on editing teaching books and works translated from French.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;

He founded ''[[El Comercio (Chile)|El Comercio]]'' newspaper in 1890, on the eve of the [[1891 Chilean Civil War]], to support President [[José Manuel Balmaceda]], who had bad relationship with the Chilean press.&lt;ref name="Historia, Geografía y Ciencias Sociales"/&gt;

The '''Society of Plastics Engineers''' (SPE) is an [[international organization]] dedicated to the advancement of knowledge and education for all [[plastics]] professionals. The SPE was founded in 1942. Today it is home to more than 20,000 plastics professionals in the [[United States]], and more than 70 countries around the world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.thomasnet.com/companystory/spe-antec-2016-drew-next-generation-of-plastics-professionals-20058113|title=SPE ANTEC® 2016 Draws Next Generation of Plastics Professionals|website=news.thomasnet.com|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization is divided into five parts: local and geographical sections, technical divisions, staff, volunteer leadership, and student organizations.  There are also groups which are under formation, such as Sections in Formation (SPE  Sections) or Special Interest Groups (SPE Divisions.) Sections exist around the world in over 70 countries. Sections publish local news letters as well as organize technical and social meetings.

Members of the SPE are also members of one or more of 26 specific technical affiliations. Affiliations include processing techniques, analysis, material specifics, markets, job function, and others.  The Divisions are varied and include areas such as [[Blow Molding]] and [[Extrusion]] to types of plastics like [[Polyvinyl chloride|Vinyl]]s or [[Thermoset]]s. 14 groups exist for the interest of development of new technologies or special interest areas that may at one point become a Technical Division.  Locations without an active SPE Section  that have formed a core group of interested members and potential officers are known as SIFs or "Sections in Formation."

The Society holds an "Annual Technical Conference" or ANTEC for short, each spring.  Usually the meetings are in early May in various locations around North America.  The meeting includes the largest presentation of peer-reviewed technical papers about plastics in the world, with usually over 700 submissions in sessions running all day from Monday thru Wednesday afternoon. The 2016 ANTEC was held in Indianapolis from May 22 through May 25.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="78607">Over the past two decades, '''state-building''' has developed into becoming an integral part and even a specific approach to [[peacebuilding]] by the international community. Observers across the political and academic spectra have come to see the state-building approach as the preferred strategy to peacebuilding in a number of high-profile conflicts, including the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israeli-Palestinian]], Bosnia, Iraq, and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]]. According to the political scientist [[Anders Persson]], internationally led state-building is based on three dimensions: a security dimension, a political dimension and an economic dimension. Of these three, security is almost always considered the first priority.&lt;ref&gt;Persson, Anders (2012). [http://cesran.org/building-a-state-or-maintaining-the-occupation-international-support-for-fayyads-state-building-project.html "Building a state or maintaining the occupation? International support for Fayyad’s state-building project"], ''Journal of Conflict Transformation and Security'', Vol. 2, No. 1, pp: 101–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

The general argument in the academic literature on state-building is that without security, other tasks of state-building are not possible.
Consequently, when state-building as an approach to peacebuilding is employed in conflict and post-conflict societies, the first priority is to create a safe environment in order to make wider political and economic development possible. So far, the results of using the state-building approach to peacebuilding have been mixed, and in many places, such as in the Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq, the initial high expectations set by the international community have not been met. The literature on state-building has always been very clear in that building states has historically been a violent process and the outcomes in the above-mentioned cases and many others confirm the destabilizing and often violent nature of state-building.

==Definition==
There are two main theoretical approaches to definitions of state-building.

First, state-building is seen by some theorists as an activity undertaken by external actors (foreign countries) attempting to build, or re-build, the institutions of a weaker, post-conflict or [[Failed state|failing state]]. This 'exogenous' or International Relations school views state-building as the activity of one country in relation to another, usually following some form of intervention (such as a UN peacekeeping operation).

The second, developmental, theory followed a set of principles developed by the [[OECD]] in 2007 on support to conflict-affected states which identified 'statebuilding' as an area for development assistance.  The result saw work commissioned by donor countries on definitions, knowledge and practice in state-building, this work has tended to draw heavily on political science.  It has produced definitions that view state-building as an indigenous, national process driven by state-society relations.  This view believes that countries cannot do state-building outside their own borders, they can only influence, support or hinder such processes. Illustrations of this approach include a think-piece commissioned for OECD{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} and a research study produced by the [[Overseas Development Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;Verena Fritz and Alina Rocha Menocal, '' [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=1340&amp;title=understanding-state-building-political-economy-perspective-analytical-conceptual-paper-processes-embedded-tensions-lessons-international-engagement|Understanding State-Building from a Political Economy Perspective: An Analytical and Conceptual Paper on Processes, Embedded Tensions and Lessons for International Engagement]'', 2007; [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The developmental view was expressed in a number of papers commissioned by development agencies.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} These papers tend to argue that state-building is primarily a 'political' process rather than just a question of technical capacity enhancements and sees state-building as involving a threefold dynamic of: political (usually elite) deals, the prioritization of core government functions and the willingness to respond to public expectations.&lt;ref&gt;http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090118231836/http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/State-in-Development-Wkg-Paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  A further important influence on thinking on states affected by conflict was the [[World Bank]]'s 2011 World Development Report, which avoided the language of state-building while addressing some related themes.

Across the two streams of theory and writing there is a broader consensus that lessons on how to support state-building processes have not yet been fully learned.  Some believe that supporting state-building requires the fostering of legitimate and sustainable state institutions, but many accept that strategies to achieve this have not yet been fully developed. Little of the post-conflict support to state-building undertaken so far has been entirely successful. From an exogenous perspective, it can be argued that sustained focus on supporting state-building has tended to happen in states frequently characterized by brutalized civilian populations, destroyed economies, institutions, infrastructure, and environments, widely accessible small arms, large numbers of disgruntled soldiers to be demobilized and reintegrated, and ethnically or religiously divided peoples. These obstacles are compounded by the fundamental difficulty of grafting democratic and human rights values onto countries with different political, cultural, and religious heritages. Pluralizing societies is theoretical in its viability for immediate political and economic stability and expediency; ideological overtones can be met with opposition within host nations and issues of self-determination and external state trusteeship and stewarding of nascent institutional reform, or its creation, could damage a tenuous post-conflict national self-identity (for critical analyses of neotrusteeship, see e.g. Ford &amp; Oppenheim, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Neotrusteeship or Mistrusteeship? The "Authority Creep" Dilemma in United Nations Transitional Administration {{!}} Journal of Transnational Law {{!}} Vanderbilt University|url = https://wp0.its.vanderbilt.edu/jotl/2012/07/neotrusteeship-or-mistrusteeship-the-authority-creep-dilemma-in-united-nations-transitional-administration/|website = wp0.its.vanderbilt.edu|access-date = 2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Both schools of thinking have generated critiques and studies seeking to test the propositions made.  A more developmental approach with an emphasis on composite state-building processes would have implications for donor programmes, diplomacy and [[Peacekeeping|peace-keeping]].  Some research has tried to test some of the ideas involved&lt;ref&gt;(OECD, Do No Harm in State-building 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and at least one donor agency issued a guidance note for its own programmes.&lt;ref&gt;(DFID, Building Peaceful States and Societies 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  Important critiques were developed by NGOs such as [[Conciliation Resources]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.c-r.org/resources/occasional-papers/documents/CR_2Renegotiating_Settlement_20Mar09-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Asia Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;http://asiafoundation.org/resources/pdfs/PoliticalSettlementsFINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; focused primarily on Whaites proposition that a 'political settlement' drives state-building.  There have also been attempts to test out the thesis by looking at individual areas of state provision, particularly the area of healthcare.  Further research on state–society relations has also been undertaken by groups including the Secure Livelihoods Research Consortium and the Crisis States Research Centre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthandfragilestates.org/index2.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_view&amp;gid=32&amp;Itemid=38&lt;/ref&gt;

While some development papers have tried to argue that state-building takes place in all countries and that much can be learnt from successful state-building there is a tendency to narrow the discussion to the most problematic contexts.  As a result, much of the literature on state-building is preoccupied with post conflict issues. See e.g. (Dahrendorf, 2003), (The Commission on Post-Conflict Reconstruction, 2003), (Collier, 2003) (Fukuyama, 2004), (Paris, 2004), (Samuels 2005). Critiques common to both schools include inadequate strategy and a lack of coordination, staffing weaknesses, and that funding is insufficient or poorly timed. Moreover, it is increasingly recognized that many of the tasks sought to be achieved are extremely complex and there is little clarity on how to best proceed. For instance, it is extremely difficult to provide security in a conflictual environment, or to disarm, demobilize and reintegrate armies successfully. It remains practically impossible to address vast unemployment in states where the economy is destroyed and there is high illiteracy, or to strengthen the rule of law in a society where it has collapsed. Moreover, the unintended negative consequences of international aid are more and more evident. These range from distortion of the economy to skewing relationship of accountability by the political elite towards internationals rather than domestic population.

The [[United Nations Research Institute for Social Development]] (UNRISD) determined that basic state capacities are to

i. Assist in the acquisition of new technologies

ii. Mobilize and channel resources to productive sectors

iii. Enforce standards and regulations

iv. Establish social pacts

v. Fund deliver and regulate services and social programmes&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3"&gt;UNRISD 2010. "Building State Capacity for Poverty Reduction." Chapter 10, pp. 3–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

States must be able to create the
# Political Capacity to address the extent to which the necessary coalitions or political settlements can be built
# Resource Mobilization Capacity to generate resources for investment and social development
# Allocate Resources To Productive And Welfare-Enhancing Sectors&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3" /&gt;

When developing this infrastructure a state can meet several roadblocks including policy capture from powerful segments of the population, opposition from interest groups, and ethnic and religious division.
Developing countries have tried to implement different forms of government established in advanced democracies. However, these initiatives have not been fully successful. Scholars have looked back at the development of Europe to determine the key factors that helped create bureaucracies that were sustainable throughout the centuries.

== Application of state-building theories ==

=== The predatory theory ===

==== War making ====
When studying the development of European states, Charles Tilly identified that European countries engaged in four activities:&lt;ref name="Peter B. Evans 1985"&gt;Peter B. Evans, D. R.; Skocpol, T., War Making and State Making as Organized Crime Bringing the State Back In. Cambridge University Press: 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

# war making – eliminating or neutralizing their own rivals
# state making – eliminating or neutralizing their rivals inside their own territory
# protection – eliminating or neutralizing the enemies of their clients
# extraction – acquiring the means of carrying out the first three activities.

For Tilly, these activities are interdependent and rely in the state’s ability to monopolize violence. Before the consolidation of European states, kings relied on their lords’ troops to emerge victorious from war, setting the final boundaries of their territories after years of campaigns. Still, these lords and their private armies could become potential threats to the king’s power during peacetime. Originally, structures were created to facilitate extraction from the king’s subordinates in exchange for protection (from their enemies and from the state), covering the expenses of war campaigns. However, extraction also economically strengthened the states, allowing them to expand their hold over the use violence.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Out of these four activities, war making was the main stimulus to increasing the level of taxation, thus increasing the capacity of the state to extract resources otherwise known as [[fiscal capacity]].&lt;ref name="Peter B. Evans 1985" /&gt; The increased capacity of the state to extract taxes from its citizens while facing external threats prompted [[Jeffrey Herbst]] to propose allowing failed states to dissolve or engage in war to re-create the process endured by European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herbst | first1 = J | year = 1996 | title = Responding to State Failure in Africa | url = | journal = International Security | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 120–144 | doi=10.1162/isec.21.3.120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of extraction in exchange for protection was further argued by economic historian Frederic Lane. Lane argued that "governments are in the business of selling protection... whether people want it or not".&lt;ref name="jesusradicals.com"&gt;Tilly, Charles: War Making and State Making as Organized Crime. 1985. http://www.jesusradicals.com/uploads/2/6/3/8/26388433/warmaking.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Lane argued that a monopoly was best equipped to produce and control violence. This, he argued, was due to the fact that competition within a monopoly raised costs, and that producing violence renders larger economies of scale.&lt;ref name="jesusradicals.com" /&gt; Although the logic was consistent with the predatory theory of the state in early modern Europe,&lt;ref name="Thies, C. G. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thies | first1 = C. G. | year = 2004 | title = State building, interstate and intrastate rivalry: A study of post-colonial developing country extractive efforts, 1975–2000 | url = | journal = International Studies Quarterly | volume = 48 | issue = 1| pages = 53–72 | doi=10.1111/j.0020-8833.2004.00291.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbst’s point of view was criticized by several scholars including Richard Joseph who were concerned that the application of predatory theory was an excessive approach of Darwinism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Joseph | first1 = R. | last2 = Herbst | first2 = J. | year = 1997 | title = Responding to State Failure in Africa | url = | journal = International Security | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 175–184 | doi=10.1162/isec.22.2.175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many have disregarded the limited view of this theory and have instead extended it to include strong external threats of any kind. External threats to the state produce stronger institutional capacities to extract resources from the state.&lt;ref name="Thies, C. G. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thies | first1 = C. G. | year = 2005 | title = War, rivalry, and state building in Latin America | url = | journal = American Journal of Political Science | volume = 49 | issue = 3| pages = 451–465 | doi=10.2307/3647725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In harnessing this increased capacity, Cameron Thies describes the state as a machine that requires a "driver" that is able to use the increased capacity to expand influence and power of government. The driver can be state personnel, a dominant class, or a charismatic individual. Without these drivers, the political and military machine of the state has no direction to follow and therefore, without this direction, war and the increased resources extracted from war can not be used for growth.&lt;ref name="Thies, C. G. 2005"/&gt; On the other hand, internal wars, i.e. civil wars, have a negative effect on extraction of a state. Internal rivals to the state decrease the state's capacity to unify and extract from its citizens. Rivals usually will bargain with the state to lower their tax burden, gain economic or political privileges.&lt;ref name="Thies, C. G. 2005"/&gt;

==== Limited access orders ====
In their paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=North|first=Douglass|last2=Wallis|first2=John|last3=Weingast|first3=Barry|date=December 2006|title=A Conceptual Framework for Interpreting Recorded Human History|url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w12795|journal=National Bureau of Economic Research|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglass North, John Wallis, and Barry Weingast offer an alternative framework - limited access orders - for understanding the predatory role of the state. In limited access orders, entry is restricted in both economic and political systems to produce rents which benefit the ruling elites. In open access orders, entry is open to all. The logic of the open access state is based in impersonality. Both systems are interdependent and are only stable when both have similar access frameworks, either limited or open. Transitioning from a limited access order to an open access order involves difficult, radical changes based on three "doorstep conditions": 1) rule of law for elites, 2) perpetual life for organizations, and 3) political control of the military. Once all three initial conditions are satisfied, more incremental changes can be made to move the state further in the direction of an open access order.

=== Social changes and social order ===
In his study on countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, Joel Migdal presented the necessary and sufficient conditions for establishing a strong state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/876100982|title=Strong societies and weak states : state-society relations and state capabilities in the third world|last=Migdal|first=Joel S.|date=1988|publisher=Princeton University press|year=|isbn=9780691010731|location=|pages=269–275|oclc=876100982}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered "massive societal dislocation" that weakens old social control and institutions as the necessary condition. Such cases include the [[Black Death]] and the [[Hundred Years' War]] in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/876100982|title=Strong societes and weak states : state-society relations and state capabilities in the third world|last=Migdal|first=Joel S.|date=1988|publisher=Princeton University press|year=|isbn=9780691010731|location=|pages=91–92|oclc=876100982}}&lt;/ref&gt; the expansion of world economy into Asia, Africa and Latin America in the 19th century, the combination of war and revolution in [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] and mass migration in [[Taiwan]] and [[Israel]] in the 20th century. Furthermore, he listed the sufficient conditions as follows:
* World historical timing when exogenous political forces were in favor of concentrated social control;
* Existence of military threat from outside or other groups in the country;
* A group of skillful and independent people to build an independent bureaucracy;
* Skillful top leadership that would take advantage of the above conditions.

== Differentiating "nation-building", military intervention, regime change ==

Some commentators have used the term "nation-building" interchangeably with "state-building" (e.g. Rand report on America's role in nation-building). However, in both major schools of theory the state is the focus of thinking rather than the "nation" (''nation'' conventionally refers to the population itself, as united by identity history, culture and language). The issues debated related to the structures of the state (and its relationship to society) and as result state-building is the more broadly accepted term.  In political science '[[nation-building]]' usually has a quite distinct meaning, defined as the process of encouraging a sense of national identity within a given group of people, a definition that relates more to socialisation than state capacity (see the ODI, OECD, and DFID reports cited above).

Similarly, state-building (nation-building) has at times been conflated with military intervention or regime change. This derives in part from the military actions in Germany and Japan in World War II and resulting states, and became especially prevalent following the military interventions in Afghanistan (October 2001) and Iraq (March 2003). However, the conflation of these two concepts has been highly controversial, and has been used by opposing ideological and political forces to attempt to justify, or reject as an illegal military occupation, the actions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Hence, regime change by outside intervention should be differentiated from state-building.

There have been some examples of military interventions by international or multilateral actors with a focus on building state capacity, with some of the more recent examples including Bosnia, East Timor, and Sierra Leone. Such interventions are alternatively described as "neotrusteeship" or "neoimperialism". Under this framework, strong states take over part of all of the governance of territories with underdeveloped existing governing structures, often with the backing of international legal authority. Unlike the classic imperialism of the 19th and early 20th centuries, this type of intervention is aimed at (re)building local state structures and turning over governance to them as quickly as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fearon|first=James|last2=Laitin|first2=David|date=Spring 2004|title=Neotrusteeship and the Problem of Weak States|url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/fearon-research/cgi-bin/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Neotrusteeship-and-the-Problem-of-Weak-States.pdf|journal=International Security|volume=28|issue=4|pages=5–43|doi=10.1162/0162288041588296}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such efforts vary in the scope of their objectives, however, with some believing that sweeping change can be accomplished through the sufficient and intelligent application of personnel, money, and time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Beginner's Guide to Nation-Building|last=Dobbins|first=James|last2=et. al.|publisher=RAND Corporation|year=2007|isbn=978-0833039880|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others believe that any such plans will founder on the inherent unpredictability of interventions and that lengthy, sustained interventions often prevent local leaders from taking responsibility and strengthen insurgent forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Can Intervention Work?|last=Stewart|first=Rory|last2=Knaus|first2=Gerald|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2012|isbn=978-0393342246|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-trusteeship, shared sovereignty, and other new models of intervention rest on the assumptions that intervention is the most effective strategy for state-building and that countries cannot recover from the failures of government without external interference. However, Jeremy M. Weinstein proposes autonomous recovery exists as a process that offers "lasting peace, a systematic reduction in violence, and post-war political and economic development in the absence of international intervention."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;''Autonomous Recovery and International Intervention in Comparative Perspective''. Jeremy M. Weinstein. Working Paper Number 57. April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The argument suggests that external interference detracts from the state-building by-products produced from war or military victories, given that military intervention makes rebel victories less likely and that peace-building discourages violence. External support undermines the creation of a self-sustaining relationship between rulers or political leaders and its constituents. Foreign aid promotes governments that maintain the same leaders in power and discourages developing a revenue extraction plan that would bind local politicians and local populations. War or military victories create conditions for self-sustaining and representative institutional arrangements through the domestic legitimacy and capacity of state revenue extraction that are by-products of war.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Versus peace-building==
State-building does not automatically guarantee peace-building, a term denoting actions that identify and support structures that strengthen and solidify peace in order to prevent a relapse into conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Boutros-Ghali, Boutros (1992) "An Agenda for Peace: Preventive Diplomacy, peacemaking and peacekeeping", paragraph 21&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst they have traditionally been considered two individual concepts with a complex relationship giving rise to dilemmas and necessitating trade-offs, as Grävingholt, Gänzle and Ziaja argue, the two actually representative two diverging perspectives on the same issue: a shaky social peace and a breakdown of political order.&lt;ref&gt;Grävingholt J, Gänzle S &amp; ZiajaS (2009), Policy Brief:

Concepts of Peacebuilding and State Building – How Compatible Are They?, ''German Institute for Development,'' p.2, Available at https://www.die-gdi.de/uploads/media/Peacebuilding_and_Statebuilding__Draft_11-03-09__01.pdf (Retrieved 23 January 2016). 
&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] emphasises that peace-building and state-building are not the same, it does recognise the nexus between them and the reinforcement of one component has on the other: 'peace-building is primarily associated with post-conflict environments, and state-building is likely to be a central element of it in order to institutionalise peace'.&lt;ref&gt;OECD (2008), Concepts and Dilemmas of State Building

in Fragile Situations: from Fragility to Resilience, ''Journal on Development'', Vol 9, Issue 3, Available at&lt;nowiki/&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dac/governance-peace/conflictandfragility/docs/41100930.pdf (Retrieved 23 January 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Paris' model including the peace-building and state-building is one of the better known ones. He advocates an Internationalisation Before Liberalisation (IBL) approach, arguing that peace-building must be geared towards building liberal and effective states, thus 'avoiding the pathologies of liberalization, while placing war-shattered states on a long-term path to democracy and market-oriented economics'.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heathershaw | first1 = J | last2 = Lambach | first2 = D | year = 2008 | title = Introduction: Post-Conflict Spaces and Approaches to Statebuilding | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17502970802436296?instName=King%2527s+College+London| journal = Journal of Intervention and Statebuilding | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 269–289 | doi = 10.1080/17502970802436296 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the advantages of incorporating peace-building and state-building in the same model, applicational limitations should be recognised. In practice, foreign and security policy making still largely treat them as separate issues. Moreover, academics often approach the subjects from different angles. Heathershaw and Lambach caution that in practice, interventions that attempt the ambitious goals that Paris (amongst others) sets out may be coercive and driven by a 'the end justifies the means' outlook.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This concern is acute in [[United Nations]] peacekeeping missions for there have been instances where peace-builders aspire not only to go a step further and eradicate the causes of violence, which are oftentimes not agree upon by the parties to the conflict, but also to invest 'post-conflict societies with various qualities, including democracy in order to reduce the tendency toward arbitrary power and give voice to all segments of society; the rule of law in order to reduce human rights violations; a market economy free from corruption in order to discourage individuals from believing that the surest path to fortune is by capturing the state; conflict management tools; and a culture of tolerance and respect'.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett M &amp; Zuercher C (n.D), The Peacebuilder's Contract:

How External State-building Reinforces Weak Statehood, ''Research Partnership on Postwar State-Building'', p.2, Available at http://www.sfb-governance.de/teilprojekte/projekte_phase_1/projektbereich_c/c1/barnettzuercherstatebuilding.pdf (Retrieved 23 January 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Such ambitious goals are questionable when the [[United Nations]] has been seen to struggle in high-profile conflict-ridden situations such as [[Darfur]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Where it has accomplished a degree of stability such as in Haiti and Liberia, it endures pressure 'to transition from heavy and costly security-oriented peacekeeping operations to lighter, peace-building-oriented missions'. Introducing state-building to mandates is controversial not only because this would entail extra costs and commitments but also because 'the expansion of peacekeeping into these areas has de facto extended the authority of the Security Council, with political, financial, institutional, and bureaucratic implications that have yet to be fully addressed'.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman J &amp; Tortolani B (2009), Implications of Peacebuilding and Statebuilding in United Nations Mandates, ''International Forum Challengers of Peace Operations'', p.2, Available at&lt;nowiki/&gt;http://www.operationspaix.net/DATA/DOCUMENT/4997~v~Implications_of_Peacebuilding_and_Statebuilding_in_United_Nations_Mandates.pdf (Retrieved 23 January 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the inherently political nature of state building, interventions to build the state can hinder peace, increasing group tensions and sparking off further conflict.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Menocal, Alina Rocha (2009) 'State-building for peace’: navigating an arena of contradictions [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/download/3673.pdf] London: Overseas Development Institute&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of the consensus that has emerged stressing that 'a minimally functioning state is essential to maintain peace',&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ignores the complications that poor legitimacy and inclusion can lead to in the future, undermining the whole process.{{According to whom|date=April 2016}} For instance, while the [[Guatemala|Guatemala Peace Accords]] were considered successful, 'the formal substance of these agreements has not altered power structures that have been in place for decades (if not centuries) in any substantial manner. The underlying (informal) understanding among elites – that their privileges and hold on power are not to be touched – appears to remain. Therefore, while the Accords may be deemed successful because they prevented the outbreak of war, this 'success' was tainted by the implications made by a subsequent report published by the Commission of Historical Clarification in February 1999. In it 'particular institutions were singled out as responsible for extensive human rights abuses. State institutions were attributed responsibility for 93% of these, and the guerrilla forces 3%. In unexpectedly strong language, the report described Guatemalan governmental policy at the height of the war as a policy of genocide'.&lt;ref&gt;Salvesen H (2002), Guatemala: Five Years after the Peace Accords: The Challenges of Implementing Peace, ''International Peace Research Institute, Oslo (PRIO)'' for the Norwegian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, p. 13, Available at  http://mercury.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/ISN/37978/ipublicationdocument_singledocument/c1f807e7-a86a-4a6d-a248-10c6c1315551/en/2002_03_Guatemala+Five+Years+After+the+Peace.pdf. (Retrieved 23 January 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The reinforcement of these state institutions as part of the peace-building process taints it by association.

Efforts to "appease" or 'buy off' certain interest groups in the interest of peace may undermine state-building exercises, as may power-sharing exercises that could favor the establishment of a political settlement over effective state institutions. Such political settlements could also enshrine power and authority with certain factions within the military, allowing them to carve up state resources to the detriment of state-building exercises.&lt;ref name="Call, Charles T 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Call | first1 = Charles T | year = 2008 | title = The Fallacy of the 'Failed State' | url = | journal = Third World Quarterly | volume = 29 | issue = 8| page = 1499 | doi=10.1080/01436590802544207}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in weak states where the government has not sufficient power to control peripheries of the territory, alliances with the elites could strengthen the state's governing power.  Yet, these alliances are successful if the agreement is mutually beneficial for the parties e.g. elites's power is threatened by competition and the entitlement of the government would help them to diminish it. In return, the government would acquire information and control over the peripheries' policies. Afghanistan since 2001, is an example of a beneficial pact between government and elites; entitling some select set of warlords as governors yielded a strongman brand of governance in two key provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Warlords, strongman governors, and the state in Afghanistan|last=Mukhopadhyay|first=Dipali|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes peace-building efforts bypass the state in an effort bring peace and development more quickly, for example, it was found that many NGOs in the Democratic Republic of Congo were building schools without involving the state. The state also may be part of the problem and over-reliance on the state by international actors can worsen security inside the country.

Conversely, state corruption can mean that state building efforts serve only one ethnic, religious or other minority group, exacerbating tensions that could escalate towards violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Call | first1 = Charles T | year = 2008 | title = The Fallacy of the 'Failed State' | url = | journal = Third World Quarterly | volume = 29 | issue = 8| page = 1498 | doi=10.1080/01436590802544207}}&lt;/ref&gt; State building can also assist predatory states to strengthen their institutions, reinforcing abusive authority and further fueling grievances and popular resistance.&lt;ref name="Call, Charles T 2008"/&gt;

In practice, however, there remains confusion over the differences between state-building and peace-building. The UN's [[High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change]] stated that "along with establishing security, the core task of peace-building is to build effective public institutions that, through negotiations with civil society, can establish a consensual framework for governance with the rule of law".&lt;ref&gt;High-Level Panel of Threats, Challenges and Change, paragraph 229&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a 2004 UN study found that a number of UN officials felt that the establishment of effective and legitimate state institutions was a key indicator of a successful peace operation.&lt;ref&gt;Call, Charles T (2008), "The Fallacy of the 'Failed State', 'Third World Quarterly'', 29:8, p 1498.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market-oriented aid==

Aid is an important part to the development dialogue. In the 1980s and 1990s due to a series of economic crises and unsuccessful attempts in intervention programs in [[Africa]], [[Latin America]], and [[Eastern Europe]], the international community shifted towards a market-oriented model of foreign aid.&lt;ref name="Fritz, V. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fritz | first1 = V. | last2 = Menocal | first2 = A. R. | year = 2007 | title = Developmental states in the new millennium: Concepts and challenges for a new aid agenda | url = | journal = Development Policy Review | volume = 25 | issue = 5| pages = 531–552 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-7679.2007.00384.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donor countries believed that a reduction in the size and the reach of the state could provide a more efficient outcome.&lt;ref name="Fritz, V. 2007"/&gt; However, the success of East Asia, East Europe, Brazil, and India has suggested even market economies require a capable state to grow sustainably.  Moreover, international donors became concerned over seriously malfunctioning states in the 1990s, i.e. [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="Fritz, V. 2007"/&gt;

==State Capacity==
Economic historians Noel Johnson and Mark Koyama define state capacity as "the ''ability'' of a state to collect taxes, enforce law and order, and provide public goods."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Noel D.|last2=Koyama|first2=Mark|date=April 2017|title=States and economic growth: Capacity and constraints|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014498316301966|journal=Explorations in Economic History|volume=64|pages=1–20|doi=10.1016/j.eeh.2016.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, various definitions of state capacity among scholars.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berwick, Elissa and Fotini, Christia|first=|date=Forthcoming 2017|title=Building State Capacity|url=|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berwick and Fotini consolidate the literature of state capacity into 3 different domains: extractive capacity, governmental capacity, and regulatory-productive capacity:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* '''Extractive capacity''' is the process of collecting rents in order to provide resources for the governed. Taxing is the most common form of extraction.  Tilly argues that state-building was not intended, but once it has begun, extraction capacity was necessary.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Furthermore, Herbst argues that war is a catalyst to start or increase extractive capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Herbst, Jeffrey. "War and the State in Africa." International Security (1990): 117-139&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Governmental capacity''' is the ability of lower level governmental workers to implement the agenda of the higher level of government. 
* '''Regulatory-Productive Capacity''' is the capacity of the state to provide output for the citizens. This output can include the enforcement of laws and the setting of policy for the citizens. 
State capacity is widely cited as an essential element to why some countries are rich and others are not: "It has been established that the richest countries in the world are characterized by long-lasting and centralized political institutions"; "that poverty is particularly widespread and intractable in countries that lack a history of centralized government... and are internally fragmented"; "and countries with weak state capacity are particularly vulnerable to civil war and internal conflict".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Pritchett, Woolcock &amp; Andrews (2013)&lt;sup&gt;[[State-building#cite note-36|[36]]]&lt;/sup&gt; offer a criticism of why state building fails to work. They claim that many countries are in a capability trap – countries are, at most, converging at a very low pace to the same levels of state capacity. They estimate that on average, it would take 672 years for the bottom 15 countries to reach the state capability level of the best performer if their capabilities keep growing at the same average rate with which they have grown since their political independence.{{efn|They use three index to estimate state capability: i) ‘government effectiveness’ from the World Bank World Governance Indicators, ii) resource efficiency, from the Bertelsmann Transformation Index, and iii) ‘progressive deterioration in public services’ from the Failed State Index.}} Other indexes suggest that countries are not catching up: the bureaucratic quality and corruption index from the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) have a negative pace of growth for the bottom 30 countries. The authors argue that the capability trap shows that external assistance to increase state capacity have not been successful in accelerating the development process. They identify that this implementation failure may occur through two techniques: i) ''systemic isomorphic mimicry'', by which the structures of institutions are imitated (specific rules are followed) but they do not serve purposes functional to the society; and ii) ''premature load bearing'', in which the pressure exerted by outsiders undermines the organic evolution of local institutions.

== State structures within the concept of state-building ==

The term "state" can be used to mean both a geographic sovereign political entity with a permanent population, a defined territory, a government, and the capacity to enter into relations with the other states, as defined under international law (Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, December 26, 1933, Article 1),  as well as a set of social institutions claiming a monopoly of the legitimate use of force within a given territory (Max Weber, 1919).

For the purposes of state-building in environments of instability, the sub-structures of states can be defined as a political regime (or system of government), a governance framework (or constitution), and a set of state institutions (or organizations) such as the armed forces, the parliament, and the justice system. State capacity refers to the strength and capability of the state institutions. Nation conventionally refers to the population itself, as united by identity, history, culture, and language.

===Authoritarian regime===

Governments that have implemented the top-down method present the idea that there is a great external threat that can diminish the capabilities of a state and its citizens. The perceived threat creates an incentive that focuses policy, make elites cooperate, and facilitates the adoption of a nationalistic ideology. In an [[authoritarian government]], political, military, and ideological power is concentrated to be conducive to policy continuation. The bureaucracies implemented are well trained, well paid, and highly competitive in recruitment and promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Evans | first1 = P. | last2 = Rauch | first2 = J. E. | year = 1999 | title = Bureaucracy and growth: A cross-national analysis of the effects of "Weberian" state structures on economic growth | url = | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 64 | issue = 5| pages = 748–765 | doi=10.2307/2657374}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economically successful states in East Asia have taken on programs to create infrastructure, subsidize the farming sector, provide credit, support spending on targeted research, and invest in health and education. However, most governments are non-developmental and unstable. Furthermore, even when countries have tried to pursue authoritarian strategies that have worked, specifically Brazil, a divided military, regional oligarchs in power, and vast disparities in inequality delegitimized the regime.&lt;ref&gt;Kay, C., Why East Asia overtook Latin America: agrarian reform, industrialisation and development. Third World Q 2002, 23 (6), 1073-1102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic regime===

A democratic regime engages citizens more actively than a top-down government. It respects the right of citizen to contest policies. Successful democracies developed political capacities by nurturing active citizenship, maintaining electoral competitiveness that gave value to the votes of the poor, fostered political parties that were strongly oriented towards equality, and had strong party-social movement ties.

== Approaches ==
While many specific techniques exist for creating a successful state-building strategy, three specific approaches have been identified by the recent 2010 UNRISD report.&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3"/&gt;  These three approaches would all fall under the endogenous school of thinking, and are: [[Good Governance]], [[New Public Management]], and [[Decentralization]].&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3"/&gt;

=== Good governance ===
{{main article|Good governance}}
[[Good governance]] is a very broadly used term for successful ways a government can create public institutions that protect people’s rights.      There has been a shift in good governance ideals, and as Kahn&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;Khan, Mushtaq H. Governance, Growth and Poverty Reduction. Governance, Growth and Poverty Reduction. DESA, June 2009. Web. 10 Nov. 2010. &lt;http://www.un.org/esa/desa/papers/2009/wp75_2009.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; states, "The dominant 'good governance' paradigm identifies a series of capabilities that, it argues are necessary governance capabilities for a market-friendly state.  These include, in particular, the capabilities to protect stable property rights, enforce the rule of law, effectively implement anti-corruption policies and achieve government accountability."
This good governance paradigm is a market-enhancing process which emerged in the 1990s.  This approach involves enforcing the rule of law, creating stronger property rights, and reducing corruption.  By focusing on improving these three traits, a country can improve its market efficiency.  There is a theoretical cycle of market failure&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt; which explains how a lack of property rights and strong corruption, among other problems, leads to market failure:

* The cycle starts with economic stagnation, which can enhance and expose the inefficiencies of a weak government and rule of law that cannot effectively respond to the problem.
* Because a government is unaccountable or weak, small interest groups can use the government for their specific interests, resulting in rent seeking and corruption.
* Corruption and rent seeking from interest groups will lead to weak property rights that prevent citizens and smaller businesses from the assurance that their property is safe under national law.  Also the corruption will result in welfare-reducing interventions.
* These weak property rights and welfare-reducing interventions lead to high transaction cost markets.
* High transaction cost markets lead back to economic stagnation.

While it is understood that improving rule of law and reducing corruption are important methods to increasing the stability and legitimacy of a government, it is not certain whether this approach is a good basis for a state building approach.  Researchers&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt; have looked at this approach by measuring property rights, regulatory quality, corruption, and voice and accountability.  There was little correlation found between increasing property rights and growth rates per capita GDP.&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3"/&gt; Similarly, there is disagreement among development researchers as to whether it is more beneficial to promote comprehensive set of reforms or to promote a minimal set of necessary reforms in contexts of poor institutionalization. Proponents of the former approach have put forward the concept of "good enough governance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grindle|first=Merilee S.|date=2007|title=Good Enough Governance Revisited|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-7679.2007.00385.x/epdf|journal=Development Policy Review|volume=25 | issue = 5 |pages=553–574|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7679.2007.00385.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Public Management ===

In response to the unsuccessful attempts to strengthen government administrations, developing countries began to adopt market-oriented managerial reforms under the pressure of the IMF and the World Bank. [[New Public Management]] approach first emerged in New Zealand and the United Kingdom in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3"/&gt;  New Public management uses market like reforms within the public sector to provide the government with the necessary power to implement a development plan on the economy while also using competitive market-based techniques to enhance public sector production.  It changed public sector employment practices from career tenure positions towards limited-term contracts for senior staff, locally determined pay, and [[performance-related pay]].&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3"/&gt; Secondly, the provision of government services shifted towards contracts, franchising, vouchers, and user charges in an effort to promote efficiency in service provision to citizens.&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3"/&gt;

In this type of government, large bureaucracies within a ministry (the principal) no longer maintain their hierarchical structure but rather are composed of operational arms of ministries that perform the role of an individual agent. The strategy has been more prominent in liberal market-driven policy regimes like New Zealand, United Kingdom, and the United States. Continental Europe has been more resistant to implementing this type of policy. In developing countries, the implementation of these types of infrastructure has been difficult because the markets for the delivery of services are imperfect and increase the danger of regulatory capture by companies. For successful implementation, governments must have the infrastructure to measure reliable performance indicators and the capacity to regulate the behavior of private providers.&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3"/&gt;

=== Decentralization ===
In reference to state building approaches [[decentralization]] is beneficial because "It seeks to reduce rent-seeking behavior and inefficient resource allocation associated with centralized power by dispersing such power to lower levels of government, where the poor are likely to exercise influence and a variety of actors may participate in the provision of services".&lt;ref&gt;UNRISD 2010. “Building State Capacity for Poverty Reduction.” Chapter 10, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Limitations to decentralization are the reduction of the meritocratic basis can limit the state's capacity to serve citizens, limited control of the fiscal funds at the local level can prevent effectiveness, and substantial inequalities in fiscal capacity among different regions can create ineffective redistribution of resources. Therefore, for these policies to work, there must be coordination efforts to ensure that growth-oriented and redistributive strategies initiated at the central government are implemented regionally. Furthermore, government elites must be in favor of low-income groups and grass root groups should be able to engage with local authorities during policy making.&lt;ref name="Poverty Reduction pp. 3"/&gt;

== Examples of state-building ==
European states replicated or bequeathed their institutions in the territories they colonized, but many new emerging states have evolved differently. European states consolidated after long years of internal and external struggles that greatly differ in context from the struggles of some recently emerged states.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Tilly, Charles (1985). "War making and state making as organized crime," in ''Bringing the State Back In'', eds P.B. Evans, D. Rueschemeyer, &amp; T. Skocpol. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kosovo===

Kosovo has gone through extensive state building by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), that assumed all executive, legislative and judicial powers in 1999, aiming to restore order, stability and peace in the turbulent region. This is a unique example of state-building that is directly administered by external actors, the effectiveness of which is to this date contested. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, Enver Hoxhaj claimed Kosovo is the most successful state-building example in the region,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ministry of Foreign Affairs|title=Hoxhaj: Kosovo, the most successful state-building example in the region.|url=http://www.mfa-ks.net/?page=2,217,1398|accessdate=29 January 2018|work=Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Republic of Kosovo.|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as its transition from war and genocide, to peace and progress has been remarkable. The developmental progress of Kosovo is apparent in its new institutional framework, that although initially centrally planned and administered by the UNMIK, has gradually transferred competencies to relevant national bodies and relevant institutions. The 2012 Report of the Secretary-General on the UNMIK claims of 'encouraging signals of commitment by the parties to engaging with one another through peaceful means and dialogue to resolve their differences'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|url=https://unmik.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/old_dnn/S-2012-818.pdf|website=Reports of the Secretary-General on UNMIK|publisher=UNMIK|accessdate=29 January 2018|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Kosovo remains a "black hole"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coelho|first1=J|title=Building State Failure in Kosovo?|journal=Contemporary Southeastern Europe|date=2015|volume=2|issue=2|pages=17–25|url=http://www.suedosteuropa.uni-graz.at/cse/sites/default/files/papers/coelho_kosovo.pdf|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Europe, being a semi-consolidated authoritarian regime, noting high levels of corruption, crime and unemployment, casting doubts over the extent to which state-building was successful. Arguably, the state is still overly dependent on international aid and external assistance for its economy, part of which is still linked to networks of the old war economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Deppler|first1=M|title=The Economic Consequences of the Kosovo Crisis: An Updated Assessment|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/kosovo/052599.htm#II|website=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=29 January 2018|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensive state building

===Latin America===

Latin America experienced a period of rapid economic growth and political stability in the late-19th century, following [[Independence of Latin America|independence]] and subsequent decades of decline caused by violence, reduced state-capacity, and fiscal fragmentation. This trajectory is markedly successful relative to other{{which|date=September 2017}} post-conflict societies at the time. Differences can be attributed{{by whom|date=September 2017}} to the demography of Latin America compared to other newly-independent European colonies, the massive European presence in Latin America,{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} the collapse of indigenous institutions, and the death of indigenous populations - unparalleled at the time. Latin Americans also enacted a number of liberal public policies swiftly and effectively, such as [[abolitionism|abolition]] of [[slavery]] ([[Saint-Domingue]] in 1793, [[Haiti]] in 1804, [[New Spain]] in 1813, [[Peru]] in 1854, Brazil in 1888), socializing property rights over land, and eliminating public monopolies, which fostered long-term stability that facilitated economic growth and established a new political economy for these new nations. The growth and stability seen in Latin America, however, did come at a high social cost  in the form of social inequality that continued into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Robert H., John H. Coatsworth, and Jeffrey G. Williamson. 2007. “Lost Decades: Post-independence Performance in Latin America and Africa.” The Journal of Economic History&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century it became economically and politically difficult for Latin American countries to increase revenues, which led states to turn to debt for the necessary resources to pay for war.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} As a result, Latin American countries did not establish the same tax basis that their European counterparts did. This can be explained by the predatory theory. Studies on the extraction of tax revenues have demonstrated that both external and internal rivals affect the ability of a state to develop and extract resources from its citizens. Interstate rivals had a positive effect on the state's capacity to extract resources while intrastate rivals had a negative effect on state building.&lt;ref name="Thies, C. G. 2005"/&gt;{{qn|date=September 2017}}

===Africa===

[[Charles Tilly|Tilly]]'s theory that external threats strengthen the state's capacity to extract taxes from its citizens can apply to developing countries in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = State Building, Interstate and Intrastate Rivalry: A Study of Post-Colonial Developing Country Extractive Efforts, 1975-2000 |jstor = 3693563 |journal = International Studies Quarterly |date = 2004-01-01 |pages = 53–72 |volume = 48 |issue = 1 |first = Cameron G. |last = Thies |doi=10.1111/j.0020-8833.2004.00291.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of both external state rivals and internal ethnic rivals prompted states to increase their extraction of taxes from citizens while internal political rivals failed to affect the extraction of taxes.{{citation needed | reason= This statement is contested in political science|date= February 2016}} The [[leader]]s in power try to maintain their position by catering to the majority ethnic group and by increasing taxes to gain the resources to diminish threats from minority ethnic groups. Thus the presence of internal ethnic rivals creates the capacity to significantly increase the [[tax ratio]].

Drawing on Charles Tilly's theory of European state formation, a number of scholars have suggested that in focusing on internal rivalries, rather than challenging colonial borders, rulers were "less likely to see their economies as a resource to be nurtured than as an object of periodic plunder—the analogy to Olson's (1993) roving bandits should be clear" (Thies, 2004: 58). In the absence of external threats, rulers thus had no impetus to replicate the patterns described by Tilly—war making, coercion, resource extraction—that had proven crucial to the process of centralization of power in the states of Europe.

For example, in ''[[States and Power in Africa: Comparative Lessons in Authority and Control|States and Power in Africa]]'' (2000), [[Jeffrey Herbst]] explains that "domestic security threats, of the type African countries face so often, may force the state to increase revenue; however, civil conflicts result in fragmentation and considerable hostility among different segments of the population", undermining the state's ability to rally the population's support for the "national project" (2000: 126).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Herbst, J.: States and Power in Africa: Comparative Lessons in Authority and Control. (Second edition) (eBook, Paperback and Hardcover) |url = http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10355.html |website = press.princeton.edu |access-date = 2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later article, Herbst argues that war in Europe lead to strong states and that without war African states will remain weak.&lt;ref name="Herbst"&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 2538753 |title = War and the State in Africa |last = Herbst |first = Jeffery |date = Spring 1990 |journal = International Security |doi = 10.2307/2538753 |pmid = |volume=14 |page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, external threats allowed states to tax, increase taxation, and forge a national identity. Additionally, the states that were invaded and taken over (such as [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland-Lithuania]] or Ireland) by stronger countries were militarily and politically weak. African states are poor, have weak governments, and are fragmented on ethnic or regional lines. According to theory, these weak African states should be susceptible to external threats, but this is not the case. In Africa, Herbst notes, there are rarely conflicts between states, and if there are, war does not threaten the existence of the state. For example, in the 1979 [[Uganda–Tanzania War|Uganda-Tanzania]] War, Tanzania invaded Uganda to overthrow [[Idi Amin]], but after the Tanzanians had removed Amin, they left the country. Although African states do not experience widespread interstate war, Herbst argues they need it to reform the tax structure and to build a national identity. Herbst concludes that war in Africa is likely to occur when African leaders realize that their economic reforms and efforts to build a national identity do not work and in desperation will start wars to build the states that their countries need.&lt;ref name="Herbst"/&gt; [[James A. Robinson (economist)|James Robinson]] disagrees with Herbst in the grade of influence of war on state-building, stating that European colonization and European influences in the continent impacted more deeply the creation of institutions, and therefore, states in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = James A | year = 2002 | title = States and Power in Africa by Jeffrey I. Herbst: A Review Essay | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Literature | volume = 40 | issue = 2| pages = 510–519 | doi=10.1257/jel.40.2.510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of | 2017}} the provision of [[public services]], another dimension of state-building, which includes the management of human capital within the realm of service along with the delivery of public services, remains another major challenge for post-conflict African nations. Academics have built models of the political economy in post-conflict African societies to understand the trade-off between the capability, delivery, and stability of public-service administration, and policies which result in weak civil service rooted in the nations' legacies of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Jurgen, Fotini Christia, and Daniel Rogger. 2016. “Public Service Reform in Post-Conflict Societies.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Several researchers have emphasized that the internal violence seen in Africa was characteristic for [[early modern Europe]]an politics and that this{{which|date=September 2017}} type of structure may resolve to produce an increased level of political order.&lt;ref name="Thies, C. G. 2000" /&gt;{{qn|date=September 2017}} A number of scholars have  criticized this claim for its "excessively Darwinian", overly deterministic and Euro-centric understanding of the process of state-formation (Thies, 2004: 69, see also Joseph, 1997).

==== South Sudan ====
The international intervention which culminated in renewed conflict in South Sudan is cited{{by whom|date=September 2017}} as an example of a flawed application of international state-building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/world/africa/quandary-in-south-sudan-should-it-lose-its-hard-won-independence.html|title= Quandary in South Sudan: Should It Lose Its Hard-Won Independence?|last= Gettleman|first= Jeffrey|date= 2017-01-23|work= The New York Times|access-date= 2017-05-19|issn= 0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 9, 2011, with unilateral{{clarify|date=September 2017}} support from the [[United Nations Security Council]] and the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development ([[IGAD]]), the nation of [[South Sudanese independence referendum, 2011|South Sudan]] was officially recognized{{by whom|date=September 2017}} as an independent Sovereign, forged by an alliance of rebel groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/10/world/africa/10sudan.html|title= After Years of Struggle, South Sudan Becomes a New Nation|last= Gettleman|first= Jeffrey|date= 2011-07-09|work= The New York Times|access-date= 2017-05-19|issn= 0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of building this state, however, had begun in 2005 with the proclamation of the [[Comprehensive Peace Agreement]] (CPA), a militarist{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} agreement forged among warlords to establish a military dictatorship in South Sudan.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The United States, Britain, Norway, and the IGAD conceptualized and facilitated the process as the solution to the ongoing [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] of 1983 to 2005.&lt;ref name="Mamdani"&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/08/opinion/can-african-union-save-south-sudan-from-genocide.html|title= Can the African Union Save South Sudan from Genocide?|last= Mamdani|first= Mahmood|date= 2017-01-08|work= The New York Times|access-date= 2017-05-19|issn= 0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agreement rested on an assumption that the terms of a peace agreement should be determined solely by military leaders.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Later, in 2010, an attempt was made{{by whom|date=September 2017}} to include political leaders in the state-building process through the [[All South Sudanese Political Parties convention]], which ultimately resolved to create a transitional government with representation from all major political factions, with a goal of hosting free and fair elections within two years of independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article36650|title= Final Communiqué of Southern Sudan Parties Conference on Referendum - Sudan Tribune: Plural news and views on Sudan|website= www.sudantribune.com|language= en|access-date= 2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the transitional government never kept these terms, and South Sudan subsequently devolved into fierce ethnic conflict and civil war. Mahmood Mamdani asserts that this renewed violence was caused by the blatant disregard that South Sudan's rulers have shown for the peace treaties, due to a perception of reassurance through unconditional international support. The treaties have in effect become, as Jeffrey Herbst describes, unenforceable contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/901048279|title= States and power in Africa : comparative lessons in authority and control|last= Ira,|first= Herbst, Jeffrey|isbn= 9780691164144|oclc= 901048279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mamdani and other scholars have called for the establishment of a new transitional process, through a [[Failed state#Neotrusteeship|neotrusteeship]] facilitated by the [[African Union]] (AU).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} They cite the successful resolution of the Gambian post-election crisis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/world/africa/gambia-adama-barrow-yahya-jammeh.html|title= Troops Enter Gambia as New President Is Sworn In|last= Searcey|first= Dionne|date= 2017-01-19|work= The New York Times|access-date= 2017-05-19|last2= Barry|first2= Jaime Yaya|issn= 0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; to assert that the AU is the only international institution with the credibility and regional representation required to effectively manage the crisis. They assert that this new transition should exclude all participants from the first failed government, should be jointly mandated by the AU and the UN, and should be funded by the United States, Norway, and Britain as an admission of their past failures.&lt;ref name="Mamdani"/&gt;

====Palestine====
The [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) claims sovereignty over the [[Palestinian Territories]] whose legal statehood is somewhat widely recognized (though not by some major global powers), as well as representative status over the [[Palestinian people]], a claim that is universally recognized. However, it does not have sole jurisdiction over the areas it claims. In addition, many of those it aims to represent currently reside elsewhere, most notably in Arab countries such as [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Syria]]. Nonetheless, the PLO and other Palestinian organisations have historically made great efforts to install institutions of a type commonly associated with states in the Palestinian territories - as well as in countries with large numbers of Palestinian residents. Examples include:

* [[Jordan]] after the [[Six-Day War]] (June 1967), where the installation of parallel structures of power and mechanisms for taxation and education led to largely independent Palestinian enclaves which formed a threat to the power and legitimacy of the [[Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan|Hashemite monarchy]]&lt;ref name="Jabber, F. 1973 pp. 79–101"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jabber | first1 = F | year = 1973 | title = The Arab regimes and the Palestinian revolution, 1967-71 | url = | journal = Journal of Palestine Studies | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 79–101 | doi=10.1525/jps.1973.2.2.00p0049v}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lebanon]], where a similar process exacerbated ethnic and religious tensions&lt;ref name="Jabber, F. 1973 pp. 79–101"/&gt;

Despite the break-down of the [[Oslo process]] of 1993-2000 and the ongoing construction of [[Israeli settlement]]s (1967 to present), the [[Palestinian National Authority]] continues to engage in state-building activities in its territories and has referred to the "State of Palestine" in official documents since 2013. In 2003 the United Nations Security Council passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1515|UN Resolution 1515]], calling for the "establishment of an independent, democratic and viable Palestinian state". Despite this official acknowledgement of the legitimacy of PNA state-building by the international community, a 2011 report prepared by the London-based [[Overseas Development Institute]] found international assistance to have been "sporadic and fragmented".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/7318.pdf |title = The Palestinian State-building Agenda |date = 2011 |access-date = 24 January 2016 |website = Overseas Development Institute |publisher = Overseas Development Institute |last = Rocha Menocal |first = Alina}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the lack of consistent outside support, the report identified key challenges to Palestinian state-building at the international level, including the lack of horizon on "final status" negotiations, failed peace negotiations, the tightening of the [[Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Territories|occupation]], and the weak economic base, in addition to profound challenges at the domestic level, including:

* a lack of an internal political settlement
* weak linkages between ruling authorities and society at large
* weakened social cohesion
* gender inequality
* weak civil-society
* lack of capacity of formal PNA institutions
* (perceived) securitization of authority across the occupied Palestinian territory&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A number of scholars have questioned whether the Palestinian Authority was ever in a position to build a viable state. Edward Said, Neve Gordon and Sara Roy – among others – have argued that the PNA was designed{{by whom|date=September 2017}} as an "occupation subcontractor", only strengthening the power asymmetries between occupier and occupied.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Another strand of analysis, associated with Jamil Hilal and Mushtaq Khan (2004), portrays the PNA as a "transitional client quasi-state", stuck in a situation where core functions of the state remain in the hands of the Israeli state. They identify structural issues within the Oslo process and disunity and corruption prevalent among the Palestinian elite as key reasons for the failure of Palestinian state-building efforts.

[...] The state narrative of the Kingdom's history begins in the eighteenth century, a time of chaos akin to the Hobbesian state of nature. [...] The emergence of the first Saudi state (1744-1818) is introduced in Saudi literature as a 'corrective mechanism bringing the ''umma'' to the right path'. [...] The second Saudi state was born only six years after the demise of the first, during which time the land formerly ruled by the Saudi-Wahhabi alliance had 'returned to unbridled tribal rivalry and feuding'. [...] The second Saudi Kingdom ended in 1887 and was characterised by internal feuding, tribal rivalries, and civil war.

'''Stephen Bienko''' (born February 24, 1979) is an American coach and athlete. He is best known as the founding Director of the Institute of Athletic Performance, the former largest franchise owner of the [[College Hunks Hauling Junk]] brand,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Turning Point USA Advisory Council |url = http://tpusa.com/aboutus/advisory-council//|website = tpusa.com/|accessdate = 2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and holding the [[Villanova University]] [[discus throw]] record for eight years.&lt;ref name = discus&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www25.homepage.villanova.edu/andrew.blaich/outdoorMENrecords.htm | title = Villanova Men's Track &amp; Field Outdoor Records | publisher = Villanova University | accessdate = 25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Bienko grew up in, [[Green Township, New Jersey]] and was a three-sport star during high school at the [[Delbarton School]], where he graduated in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Ruse, Leslie. [http://www.dailyrecord.com/story/news/local/new-jersey/2014/09/21/morris-twp-man-collecting-sports-equipment-nicaraguans/15894757/ "Ruse on the Loose: Morris Twp. man collecting sports equipment for Nicaraguans"], ''[[Daily Record (Morristown)]]'', September 21, 2014. Accessed December 1, 2017. "New Jersey entrepreneur Stephen Bienko, whose Montville company, 42 Holdings, LLC, is the largest owner of College Hunks Hauling Junk and Moving franchise territories, has been selected by ''NJBIZ'' Magazine as one of its 2014 '40 Under 40' top business people in the state.

'''Theodore Levitt''' (March 1, 1925, Vollmerz, [[Main-Kinzig-Kreis]], [[Germany]] – June 28, 2006, [[Belmont, Massachusetts]]) was an American economist and professor at [[Harvard Business School]]. He was also editor of the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' and an editor who was especially noted for increasing the Review's circulation and for popularizing the term [[globalization]]. In 1983, he proposed a definition for ''corporate purpose:'' Rather than merely making money, it is to create and keep a customer.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, T (1983) The Marketing Imagination, New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Levitt was born in 1925 in Vollmerz to a Jewish family.  A decade later his family moved to [[Dayton, Ohio]].  He served in [[World War II]], received his high school diploma through correspondence school and then earned a [[bachelor's]] at [[Antioch College]] and a [[Ph.D.]] in [[economics]] at [[Ohio State University]].  His first teaching job was at the [[University of North Dakota]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbs.edu/news/releases/062906_levittobit.html ''PROFESSORTHEODORE LEVITT, LEGENDARY MARKETING SCHOLAR AND FORMER HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW EDITOR, DEAD AT 81'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959 he joined the faculty of the [[Harvard Business School]]. Later that year, he became world-renowned after publishing ''[[Marketing Myopia]]'' in [[Harvard Business Review]] where he asks "What business are you in?", a phrase that demands one account for the significance of the job one does.&lt;ref name="Mullman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mullman |first=Jeremy |title=An 'original mind' of marketing dies. | work=Advertising Age | date=July 10, 2006 | volume=77 | pages=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in developing the term "globalization"==
Though widely credited with coining the term [[globalization]] in an article entitled "Globalization of Markets", which appeared in the May–June 1983 issue of [[Harvard Business Review]], he was not the originator of the term. As a NYTimes article notes, the term 'globalization' was in use well before this publication (at least as early as 1944) and had been used by economists as early as 1981. Nonethless, Levitt can be credited with popularizing the term and bringing to a mainstream business audience. 

== Further work ==
Between 1985 and 1989, he headed the ''Harvard Business Review'' as an editor.&lt;ref name="Mullman" /&gt;

He was the author of ''The Marketing Imagination'', and was a best-selling author whose works have been translated into eleven languages. He was also the author of numerous articles on economic, political, management, and marketing subjects.

==Honors and accolades==
He was a four-time winner of the McKinsey Awards competitions for best annual article in the ''Harvard Business Review''; winner of Academy of Management Award for the outstanding business books of 1962 for ''Innovation in Marketing''; winner of John Hancock Award for Excellence in Business Journalism in 1969; recipient of the Charles Coolidge Parlin Award as "Marketing Man of the Year," 1970; recipient of the George Gallup Award for Marketing Excellence, 1976; recipient of the 1978 Paul D. Converse Award of the [[American Marketing Association]] for major contributions to marketing and recipient of the 1989 William M. McFeely Award of the International Management Council for major contributions to management.

==Death==
Levitt died at the age of 81 years in his home on June 28, 2006 after a long battle with an illness. His memorial was held at his favorite tennis club. He was survived by his wife of 58 years, and by four children.

==Company history==
Trinseo's precursor Styron was formed in August 2009 when [[Dow Chemical Company]] combined several of its businesses--[[Styrene|styrenics]]; [[polycarbonate]] and compounds &amp; blends; Dow Automotive plastics; [[Emulsion polymerization|emulsion polymers]] (paper and carpet latex); and [[synthetic rubber]] — as part of a larger process of identifying and selling non-strategic assets.&lt;ref name="Dow2010"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dow.com/en-us/news/press-releases/Dow%20Closes%20Sale%20of%20Styron%20Division%20to%20Bain%20Capital%20for%20163%20Billion |title=Dow Closes Sale of Styron Division to Bain Capital for $1.63 Billion |publisher=Dow Chemical Company (press release)|date=June 17, 2010 |accessdate =August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canplastics.com/economy/dow-puts-new-styron-business-up-for-sale/1000336597/ |title=Dow puts new Styron business up for sale |publisher=Canadian Plastics |date=August 3, 2009 |accessdate =August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Victory Yard''' was a temporary expansion of the [[General Dynamics Electric Boat]] facility in [[Groton, Connecticut]] to dramatically increase submarine construction during [[World War II]].

==Early property ownership==
On 5 February 1942, the US Navy purchased the former [[Groton Iron Works]] property from Alfred Holter and [[Shell Oil Company]] for $222,000 using condemnation proceedings.&lt;ref name="US Navy"/&gt; $9.5 million was spent to construct the '''Victory Yard''', where [[General Dynamics Electric Boat]] began building submarines on 22 July 1942.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; On 3 November 1943 a Federal Court Committee awarded an additional $203,000 to the former owners.&lt;ref name="Federal Court"/&gt;

'''''Wall Street Week with [[Maria Bartiromo]]''''' ('''''WSW'''''), retitled in early 2018 as '''''Maria Bartiromo's Wall Street,''''' is an [[investment]] news and information [[Television|TV]] program airing Friday nights on the [[Fox Business Network]].  The original weekly show hosted by [[Louis Rukeyser]] aired each Friday evening on [[PBS]] in the United States from 1970 to 2002. The program features a host (or hosts) and guest experts participating in discussions related to the [[financial market]]s.

The original show, which was created by [[Anne Truax Darlington]] and produced by [[Maryland Public Television]] (MPT), debuted on the entire [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] network on January 7, 1972 and was officially titled '''''Wall $treet Week with [[Louis Rukeyser]]''''' ('''''W$W''''') during the 32 years he hosted from 1970 to 2002 (the "S" in "Street" was in the shape of a dollar sign).

{{wikinews|PBS cancels 'Wall $treet Week' after 35 years}}

In June 2002, the show was modified, dropping Rukeyser and changing the name to '''''Wall Street Week with [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'''''. Rukeyser went on to host ''[[Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street]]'' on [[CNBC]] (cancelled on December 31, 2004 at Rukeyser's request due to continuing ill health), which was also distributed to PBS stations. '''''Wall Street Week with [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]''''', which was hosted by [[Geoff Colvin]] and former [[Fox News]] business correspondent [[Karen Gibbs]], ended its PBS run on June 24, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Ives | first = Nat | authorlink = | last2 = Elliott | first2 = Stuart | authorlink2 = | title = 'Wall St. Week,' a PBS Staple, Will Go Off the Air in June | work = [[The New York Times]] | page = 8 | date = 2005-03-24 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E5D8163FF937A15750C0A9639C8B63 | accessdate = 2009-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Wall Street Week''''' was resurrected in April 2015 by SkyBridge Media LLC, an affiliated entity of global investment firm [[SkyBridge Capital]], which was founded by financier and entrepreneur [[Anthony Scaramucci]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://nypost.com/2014/05/15/scaramucci-to-revive-iconic-wall-street-week/ | work=New York Post | first=Michelle | last=Celarier | title=Scaramucci to revive iconic 'Wall Street Week' | date=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new "Wall Street Week" featured [[Anthony Scaramucci]] and Morgan Stanley senior advisor Gary Kaminsky as co-hosts. In March 2016, the show's licensing rights were picked up by [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] and it now airs Friday nights at 8 PM ET on the [[Fox Business Network]].  In April 2017, the show's name was changed to reflect Fox Business naming Maria Bartiromo as the new presenter. It was further changed in early 2018 to ''Maria Bartiromo's Wall Street.''&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title| id=4679468 | title=Maria Bartiromo's Wall Street (originally Wall Street Week) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Show format==

===''Wall Street Week with Louis Rukeyser''===
* Commentary: Rukeyser would begin the program with a short commentary on the week's financial news, followed by a summation of market statistics.
* Panel Discussion: A panel of financial analysts (usually three in number) offered their opinions on the market, and gave specific stock recommendations. Panelists over the years, who numbered close to 30 by the turn of the 20th century, included financial names like Frank Cappiello, Jim Price,  Gail Dudack, Mary Farrell, Michael Holland, Carter Randall, [[Julius Westheimer]] and [[Martin Zweig]].
* Viewer Mail: The panelists would answer questions submitted by viewers. This segment always ended with Rukeyser delivering a pun-laden solicitation for letters.
* Interview Prelude: Occasionally, before the final interview, Rukeyser would provide his insight on some aspects of business, such as a certain stock sector (e.g. food, medical, energy), the right choice for mutual funds, and even the best deals on various products. The most commonly repeated commentaries were "Professor Lou's Classroom" (during the back-to-school season), "Uncle Lou Goes Christmas Shopping" (held during in December, usually on the Friday before Christmas), and "Sentiment-al Journey" (New Year's Eve).
* Interview: In the final segment, Rukeyser and the panelist interviewed a guest expert.
Over the years, the list of guests included such notables as [[Paul Volcker]], [[Alan Greenspan]], [[Ross Perot]], [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], [[Malcolm Forbes]], and [[Paul Samuelson]]. &lt;!-- Warren Buffett was never a guest--&gt;

===="Ms. Smythe"====
After being introduced, guests for the interview segment were escorted from backstage by a woman in formal dress dubbed by production staff and listed in the [[Credits roll|credits]] as "Ms. Smythe" ("Miss Smythe" until the late 1980s), always followed by her real name. Various women over the years performed this task, the most famous being Natalie Seltz.

===="TWX in 12 Bars"====
During Rukeyser's tenure, the program featured a distinctive theme composed by Donald Swartz entitled "TWX in 12 Bars," which featured percussion supplied by a [[teletype machine]]. The opening bells of the song replicated the sound of the [[Westminster chime]]s.

====New Year's Show====
On the last Friday of the year, the host and panelists would appear in [[black tie]], make market predictions and stock recommendations for the upcoming year, and review how well their predictions of one year ago fared.

====Alternative format====
On October 23, 1987, the first program following [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday]], the show dropped its regular format for a special program where Rukeyser interviewed three experts on the impact of the stock market crash.

Afterwards, the show would employ this alternative format whenever events warranted, usually once every few months.

====Stand-ins for Rukeyser====
Whenever Rukeyser was on vacation or otherwise absent, one of the show's regular panelists would fill in. For many years this function was usually performed by Carter Randall, though in later years it was usually Frank Cappiello or (less often) [[Martin Zweig]] after Randall died in 1999. Both Randall and Cappiello were investment bankers from [[Baltimore]], convenient to where ''WSW'' was produced in [[Owings Mills, Maryland]].

===="An Investment Primer" specials====
During the 1984 and 1985 [[pledge drive|pledge-drive]] seasons, Rukeyser hosted two "Investment Primer" specials, introducing viewers to the stock market and how it worked. The first show, which aired in 1984, dealt with stocks, bonds, and gold; whereas the second show in 1985 dealt with mutual funds, options and commodities. Some of the guests included [[Stan Weinstein]] (editor of ''The Professional Tape Reader''), Peter Lynch (manager of the Magellan funds at [[Fidelity Investments]]), and Dick Fabian (editor for "The Telephone Switch Newsletter")

===''Wall Street Week with Fortune''===
With the new hosts came a change in format:

* Opening report: Geoff Colvin and Karen Gibbs presented separate news reports on major stories impacting the market.
* Viewer Mail: The hosts answered questions from viewers.
* Interviews: The hosts conducted separate guest interviews; Gibbs handled interviews related to specific investing issues, while Colvin handled interviews relating to politics and the overall economy.
* Closing Commentary: A brief commentary by Colvin.

The new show's theme music was an updated, more orchestral version of "TWX in 12 Bars", produced again by Don Swartz and Don Barto.

Without Louis Rukeyser as host, this new version suffered from lower ratings, neither capturing a new more youthful market as PBS had intended, nor retaining the original viewers. It was canceled after three seasons.

===Wall Street Week Index===
During its run, the show used two different indexes to predict future market trends:

From 1970 to 1989, the show used the Wall Street Week Index (later known as the WSW Technical Market Index), a [[technical analysis]] developed by [[Robert Nurock]]. The analysis consisted of ten separate technical [[Technical indicator|indicators]], each of which was assigned a value of either +1 (indicating a [[bullish]] trend), -1 (for a [[bearish]] trend, or 0 (neutral)). A net balance of +5 (or higher) was interpreted as a buy signal, while a reading of -5 (or lower) was a sell signal. While the index rarely gave outright buy or sell signals, over time it was found to give an accurate forecast of the stock market.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Rukeyser irreverently named the index "The Elves" (a reference to the [[Gnomes of Zürich]]), and dubbed Nurock the "Chief Elf." After being in neutral for a considerable period of time, Rukeyser requested significant changes in the makeup of the index.  Nurock refused since he believed his ten indicators were still the best way to judge the technical aspects of the market.  This ended Nurock's association with the show and the Index was replaced.

Used From 1989 to the end of the Rukeyser era, the Elves Index was also a reading of ten indicators scored in the same manner as the Wall Street Week Index. Instead of reflecting technical factors, the indicators now represented the personal sentiment of ten market analysts about the direction of the market over the next three months. The Elves Index had more volatility and gave more buy and sell signals than the old Wall Street Week Index, but was not as highly regarded. In 1998, one magazine even suggested the Elves Index was more useful as a [[contrarian]] tool, citing three examples where buy signals were followed by periods of market drift or contraction.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Later, Rukeyser added an Elves Index for the NASDAQ. This index had one of the worst predictive records of any public index.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The indexes were "retired" by Rukeyser after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. At that point, the indexes were signalling a very strong sell signal. However, as was usually the case, it was an excellent time to do the opposite as the market rallied significantly after the initial selloff.

==Show popularity==
The premiere of ''WSW'' on November 20, 1970 was carried on eleven stations of the [[American Public Television|Eastern Educational Television Network]]. The show rapidly grew in coverage and viewers until it became one of the most popular programs on the newly created PBS member stations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} At its peak in the 1980s, the program aired on over 300 stations, and claimed a viewership of 4,100,000 households, which meant more people watched ''WSW'' every week than read the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The program became a major source of profit for both MPT and PBS through underwriting support and viewer pledges (it is estimated PBS earned $5,000,000 profit annually from the show).{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

===The Rukeyser Effect===
Over the years, stock traders and analysts noted that a company touted on ''WSW'' on Friday would experience a run-up in its stock price the following Monday. This phenomenon, dubbed "The Rukeyser Effect", was stated to be a further demonstration of the program's influence. However, in 1987, Prof. [[Robert Pari]] of [[Bentley College]] published an academic article in the ''[[Journal of Portfolio Management]]'' detailing the results of a study that found that stocks recommended by Rukeyser's guests on Wall Street Week not only tended to rise in price and trading volume in the days ''preceding'' the Friday evening broadcast, peaking on the Monday afterward, but thereafter those stocks tended to drop in price and under-perform the market for up to a year following the recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;Pari, R. (1987). ''Wall Street Week recommendations: yes or no?'' Journal of Portfolio Management, 14, 74-76.&lt;/ref&gt; Rukeyser strongly disputed this claim, but ten years later Professors [[Jess Beltz]] and [[Robert Jennings (economist)|Robert Jennings]] published another academic article in the ''[[Review of Financial Economics]]'' reporting results consistent with Pari's original findings, and that there was "little correlation between the 6-month performance of a recommendation and the abnormal volume at the date the recommendation is made." They observed that there were differences in return performance between the recommendations of different individuals, but the market could not discern the more insightful recommendations from the less insightful.&lt;ref&gt;Beltz, J., &amp; Jennings, R. (1997). "Wall Street Week with Louis Rukeyser" recommendations: trading activity and performance. Review of Financial Economics, 6, 15-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Another commentator observed "It is mathematically impossible for the thirty million viewers of this show to beat the market, since they are the market."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/996/basics.htm William J. Bernstein]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rukeyser as host==
Louis Rukeyser conducted the proceedings with a wry sense of humor (including the use of [[pun]]s) and a reassuring manner. In 1980 Rukeyser explained his hosting philosophy to ''[[The New York Times]]'' as, "I am talking to one person, whom I regard as intelligent, with a good sense of humor, but not all that technically knowledgeable." He instructed panelists and guests not to use technical jargon and economic theories on the show, but rather talk about making money, because, "Economics puts people to sleep. Money wakes them up."

==Rukeyser's dismissal==
From its ratings peak in the early 1980s, ''WSW'' suffered a long steady decline in viewers due to competition from shows such as the ''[[Nightly Business Report]]'', cable programs like ''[[Lou Dobbs Tonight|Moneyline]]'', and cable networks such as [[CNBC]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} By 2001 viewership was down to 1,500,000 households and demographics showed that the average ''WSW'' viewer was 65 years old (about the same age as Rukeyser). MPT began to discuss the possibility of updating the format in an effort to reverse these trends. On March 21, 2002, MPT announced that beginning in June the program would be renamed ''Wall Street Week with Fortune'', would be a collaboration between MPT and Fortune magazine, and would feature two new cohosts. Rukeyser was invited to remain with the program in a reduced role as a senior correspondent, but he turned down the offer.

The following evening, Rukeyser opened the telecast by announcing "A funny thing happened to me on the way to the studio this week—I got ambushed." He criticized MPT's decision to change the show format, announced that he was developing a new business program for PBS, and concluded his commentary by asking viewers to write to their local PBS station and request it carry his new show. After the broadcast MPT dismissed Rukeyser and executive producer Rich Dubroff. Over the next three months [[Marshall Loeb]] and Ray Brady served as guest hosts while the new format was put in place.

Despite "ambushing" Rukeyser, the show's trend of losing viewers continued as the show floundered on without Rukeyser's trusted presence and was terminated in early 2005. Rukeyser died 11 months after the show ended.

==Return of "Wall Street Week"==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AnthonyScaramucci.jpg|thumb|'''Anthony Scaramucci''': Host of new ''Wall Street Week'' and founder, co-managing partner of global investment firm SkyBridge Capital]] --&gt;
In May 2014, [[SkyBridge Capital]] acquired licensing rights to ''Wall Street Week'', creating a new entity, SkyBridge Media, for the purpose of re-launching the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://nypost.com/2014/05/15/scaramucci-to-revive-iconic-wall-street-week/ | title=Scaramucci to revive iconic 'Wall Street Week' | publisher=''[[New York Post]]'' | date=15 May 2014 | accessdate=19 February 2015 | author=Celarier, Michelle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new ''Wall Street Week'' originally featured SkyBridge founder and managing partner [[Anthony Scaramucci]] and Morgan Stanley senior advisor Gary Kaminsky as hosts, and the format has been refreshed to maintain the spirit of the original show while modernizing certain aspects of the presentation. 

The first episode of the new "Wall Street Week" aired April 19, 2015 and was streamed from its website, WallStreetWeek.com. Airtime for the show was purchased on television stations in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New "Wall Street Week" Premieres On April 19 With Exclusive Guest Lineup|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-new-wall-street-week-premieres-on-april-19-with-exclusive-guest-lineup-300067725.html|website=Cision PR Newswire|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first episode featured special guest "bond king" [[Jeffrey Gundlach]] of DoubleLine Capital and panelists Liz Ann Sonders (who was a frequent panelist on the original "Wall Street Week with [[Louis Rukeyser]]") of Charles Schwab and Jonathan Beinner of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Gundlach's commentary on the show, where he called for a potential crash in the junk bond market, made news across Wall Street following the premiere.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/jeff-gundlach-issues-ominous-warning-for-junk-bond-market-2015-04-20&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was picked up by Fox Business Network with its first episode airing there on March 18, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fox Business|url=http://press.foxbusiness.com/2016/03/fox-business-network-to-premiere-anthony-scaramuccis-wall-street-week-on-friday-march-18th/|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scaramucci stepped away from his position hosting the show after Donald Trump added him to his transition team as an economic advisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hill|url=http://thehill.com/media/305692-fox-business-host-steps-down-after-being-tapped-for-trump-transition-team|website=The Hill|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Maria Bartiromo]] was named by Fox Business as the show's permanent anchor in April 2017.  

The new program airs every Friday night at 8 PM ET on the [[Fox Business Network]], with replays airing Friday nights at 8:30 PM ET, 12 and 12:30 AM ET, and Saturday and Sunday mornings at 9 &amp; 9:30 AM ET. &lt;ref&gt;
http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2016/03/14/fox-business-network-welcomes-iconic-wall-street-week-program.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Again, the opening bars (only) of "TWX in 12 Bars" is used for the opening, with a quote attributed to Rukeyser, “This show has never been solely about investments. We've talked about anything that affected people and their money," with both Scaramucci and Kaminsky featured in the opening.

==''Maria Bartiromo's Wall Street''==
Sometime in January 2018, the show's title was changed to ''Maria Bartiromo's Wall Street.'' The name change was implemented with little notice or fanfare by Fox Business, and no reason was announced for the change.
