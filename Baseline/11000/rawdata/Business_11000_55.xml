'''Agile tooling''' is the design and fabrication of [[manufacturing]] related-tools such as [[die (manufacturing)|die]]s, [[Mold (casting)|molds]], [[Pattern (casting)|patterns]], [[Jig (tool)|jigs]] and [[Fixture (tool)|fixtures]] in a configuration that aims to maximise the tools' performance, minimise manufacturing time and cost, and avoid delay in [[prototyping]].  A fully functional agile tooling laboratory consists of [[Numerical control#Mills|CNC milling]], [[turning]] and [[Router (woodworking)|routing]] equipment. It can also include [[additive manufacturing]] platforms (such as [[fused filament fabrication]], [[selective laser sintering]], [[Stereolithography]], and [[direct metal laser sintering]]), [[hydroforming]], [[vacuum forming]], [[die casting]], [[Stamping (metalworking)|stamping]], [[injection molding]] and [[welding]] equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cdme.osu.edu/resources/agile-tooling|title=Agile Tooling|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agile tooling is similar to [[rapid tooling]], which uses additive manufacturing to make tools or tooling quickly, either directly by making parts that serve as the actual tools or tooling components, such as mold inserts; or indirectly by producing patterns that are in turn used in a secondary process to produce the actual tools. Another similar technique is prototype tooling, where molds, dies and other devices are used to produce prototypes.  Rapid manufacturing, and specifically rapid tooling technologies, are earlier in their development than [[rapid prototyping]] (RP) technologies, and are often extensions of RP.

The aim of all toolmaking is to catch design errors early in the design process; improve product design better products, reduce product cost, and reduce [[time to market]].

{{Unreferenced|section|date=October 2016}}
Hundreds of universities and research centers{{examples|date=October 2016}} around the globe are investing in additive manufacturing equipment in order to be positioned to make prototypes and tactile representations of real parts. Few have fully committed the concept of using [[additive manufacturing]] (AM) to create manufacturing tools (fixturing, clamps, molds, dies, patterns, negatives, etc.). AM experts{{who|date=October 2016}} seem to agree that tooling is a large, namely untapped market. Deloitte University Press estimated that in 2012 alone, the AM Tooling market $1.2 Billion. At that point in the development cycle of AM Tooling, much of the work was performed under the guise of “let’s try it and see what happens”.

== Industry applications ==
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2016}}
Additive manufacturing, starting with today's infancy period, requires manufacturing firms to be flexible, [[continuous improvement process|ever-improving]] users of all available technologies to remain competitive. Advocates{{who|date=November 2016}} of additive manufacturing also predict that this arc of technological development will counter [[globalization]], as end users will do much of their own manufacturing rather than engage in trade to buy products from other people and corporations.&lt;ref name="3D opp"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6dc11070-d763-11e1-a378-00144feabdc0.html#axzz24gFn5Cal |title=Exploring the 3D printing opportunity |work=[[The Financial Times]] |author=Jane Bird |date=2012-08-08 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The real integration of the newer additive technologies into commercial production, however, is more a matter of complementing traditional subtractive methods rather than displacing them entirely.&lt;ref name="Albert_2011-02_MMS_column"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Albert |first=Mark|date=17 January 2011 |title=Subtractive plus additive equals more than ( – + + = &gt; )|journal=Modern Machine Shop |volume=83 |issue=9 |publisher=Gardner Publications Inc. |location=Cincinnati, Ohio, USA |page=14 |url=http://www.mmsonline.com/columns/subtractive-plus-additive-equals-more-than }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Automotive''' – approaching niche vehicle markets (making less than 100, 000 vehicles), rather than high production volume

'''Aircraft''' – the U.S. aircraft industry operates in an environment where production volumes are relatively low and resulting product costs are relatively high. Agile tooling can be applied in the early design stage of the development cycle to minimize the high cost of redesign.

'''Medical''' – cast tooling would benefit a great deal from agile tooling. However, the cost for the tooling may still be significantly greater than the cost of a casting piece, with high lead times. Since only several dozen or several hundred metal parts are needed, the challenge for mass production is still prevalent. A balance between these four areas – quantity, design, material, and speed are key to designing and producing a fully functional product.

'''Alicia Koplowitz y Romero de Juseu''' (born 12 September 1954) is a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[business magnate]] and one-time noblewoman. When her father died, she and her sister inherited Construcciones y Contratas, S.A. (CYCSA), a company founded by her father. She then sold her part of the company to her sister and created one of the largest family offices in Europe called Omega Capital. She ranks as Spain's richest woman in ''[[Forbes]] 2013 World's Richest People'' list (#589 in the world).

==Early life and education==
Alicia was born in [[Madrid]] (Spain) in 1954, the second and youngest daughter (after [[Esther Koplowitz, Marquise of Cubas|Esther]], born in 1953) of [[Ernesto Koplowitz]] Sternberg, a [[Jewish]] businessman from [[Upper Silesia]] ([[Germany]]) who settled down in Spain to escape the increasing [[Germany|German]] [[Nazi]] persecution in the early-1930s,&lt;ref name=ABCMasRicas&gt;[http://www.abc.es/hemeroteca/historico-24-08-2007/abc/Gente/las-koplowitz-las-mas-ricas-de-espa%C3%B1a_164500293074.html ABC (Spain): "Las Koplowitz Las más ricas de España" by ISABEL GUTIÉRREZ (''in Spanish'')] August 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and Esther Romero de Juseu y Armenteros, a Spanish [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]].&lt;ref name=ABCMasRicas /&gt; (Alicia and Esther inherited their titles from their mother. Alicia is ''Marquesa de Bellavista'' and ''Marquesa del Real Socorro'' while Esther was ''Marquesa de Casa Peñalver'', a title now inherited by one of her daughters.) Her parents married in 1950 in a Catholic ceremony.&lt;ref name=IndependentFlourishing&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/behind-some-great-men-women-who-do-it-better-two-ladies-of-spain-are-flourishing-at-the-top-of-a-construction-empire-after-wresting-it-from-their-wayward-husbands-1534177.html Independent: "Behind some great men, women who do it better: Two ladies of Spain are flourishing at the top of a construction empire after wresting it from their wayward husbands" by JUSTIN WEBSTER] July 19, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Using his German language skills, her father first worked for the German electronics company [[AEG]]&lt;ref name=IndependentFlourishing /&gt; and then in 1952, borrowing funds from a German friend,&lt;ref name=IndependentFlourishing /&gt; purchased the construction company ''Construcciones y Reparaciones S.A.'' which he renamed ''Construcciones y Contratas S.A. (CYCSA).''&lt;ref name=ABCMasRicas /&gt; He slowly built the company, carefully cultivating relationships during the precarious [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] era, and when Spain experienced a construction boom in the early 1960s, the company flourished.&lt;ref name=IndependentFlourishing /&gt;

Alicia attended the ''Lycée Français'' and University Complutense of Madrid. {{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Career==
In 1962, her father died in a horse-riding accident&lt;ref name=ABCMasRicas /&gt; and her mother enlisted [[Ramón Areces]], a close friend of her father and the president of [[El Corte Inglés S.A.]], the largest department store chain in Europe, to run CYCSA for her and her daughters' benefit.&lt;ref name=ABCMasRicas /&gt;&lt;ref name=IndependentFlourishing /&gt; In 1968, Alicia's mother died of cancer.&lt;ref name=IndependentFlourishing /&gt;

In 1969, Alicia's sister Esther married [[Alberto Alcocer]] and six months later, Alicia married Alberto Alcocer's cousin [[Alberto Cortina]], the son of [[Pedro Cortina Mauri]], foreign minister during the Franco period and founder of the beer brand San Miguel.&lt;ref name=ABCMasRicas /&gt; The sisters gave up their board seats to their husbands and the ''"Albertos"'', as they were known, made the firm grow spectacularly from 1973 onwards and diversified acquiring real estate, Banco Zaragozano,&lt;ref name=ABCMasRicas /&gt; and 47 percent of Catalonia construction firm ''Fomento de Obras y Construcciones SA (FOCSA).''&lt;ref name=IndependentFlourishing /&gt;

In 1990, Alicia divorced Alberto Cortina&lt;ref name=ABCMasRicas /&gt; after he was [[paparazzi|photographed]] by [[paparazzi]] in 1989 with another woman (Marta Chávarri, then wife of Fernando Falcó, ''marqués de Cubas,'' who Esther would later marry in 2003).&lt;ref name=ABCMasRicas /&gt; At the same time, Esther also found that her husband was having an affair and divorced six months later. In 1990, the sisters returned to the board of CYCSA, filling the seats vacated by their husbands. Their husbands received ownership of the Banco Zaragozano as part of the divorce settlement.&lt;ref name=ABCMasRicas /&gt;

In 1992, CYCSA merged with '''Fomento de Obras y Construcciones, S.A.'' (FOCSA) forming the largest construction company in Spain. The company was renamed ''[[Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas|Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas S.A.]] (FCC).'' In 1998, Alicia sold her 28.26% stake in FCC to her sister Esther for 871 million euro.&lt;ref name="solidaridad.net"&gt;[http://www.solidaridad.net/articulo1255_enesp.htm Alicia Koplowitz Es La Mujer Más Rica De España : Solidaridad.Net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; When Alicia left FCC in 1998, FCC was the largest construction and services company in Spain with nearly the sales of the next largest. In 2012, FCC had dropped to fifth largest in Spain while its competitor [[Grupo ACS]] (with the sisters' ex-husbands Alberto Cortina &amp; Alberto Alcocer among its largest shareholders) is now the largest construction and services company in the world.

Since then, Alicia has diversified her investments, mainly through Private Equity, [[Blue chip (stock market)|blue chip companies]] in the [[stock exchange]], [[oil]] and [[real estate]] (such as the Ritz in Madrid, the Park Hyatt in Milan and commercial and office buildings all over the US), advised by [[Oscar Fanjul]] (a former ex-chairman of [[Repsol]]). She has an estimated fortune of 3,000 million euro.&lt;ref name="solidaridad.net"/&gt;

In 1998, Alicia created Omega Capital,{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} a venture capital firm specializing in growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=519927 BusinessWeek: "Company Overview of Omega Capital, S.L."] retrieved August 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Omega Capital is an investment company 100% owned by Alicia Koplowitz.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The first investment in funds of hedge funds was made in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundspeople.com/noticias/omega-gestion-la-gestora-espanola-que-mas-apuesta-por-la-inversion-libre-39318 Omega Gestión, la gestora española que más apuesta por la inversión libre]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy and awards==
She has created two foundations: ''Fundación Vida y Esperanza'' (in 1994), that helps children, adolescents and young adults with social, family and financial problems with housing, education and work. The foundation now has approximately 100 people receiving full-time aid in Spain. Through a different branch of Vida y Esperanza she also gives housing and support to the elderly, helps people with special needs and works with other foundations.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Through her charitable foundation ''Fundación Alicia Koplowitz'' she sends Spanish fellows to research in child psychiatry in England and the U.S. at places like King's College, Columbia University's Medical Center or Stanford University. These fellowships cover the full research, housing and salary for 2 to 4 years and then help the fellow seek employment at a top institution when they return to Spain. The Foundation also organizes every year the largest convention for psychiatry in Spain where top scientist from all over the world come during one week to give lectures and make round tables and debates. In 2009 she was named an honorary member of the Spanish Society of Psychiatrists for her efforts to promote the study and development of child and adolescent psychiatry. Thanks to her efforts, the Spanish State recognized child and adolescent psychiatry as different specialization within general psychiatry in Spain.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Alicia Koplowitz also promoted, built and donated to the State the largest hospital in Europe specialized in multiple sclerosis in 2004 (Alicia Koplowitz Multiple Sclerosis Hospital).{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Among her distinctions and awards, she was awarded the ''Gran Cruz de la Orden del Mérito Civil'' (May 2003), Chevalier de La Légion d'honneur of France (Knight of the Legion of Honour, of France), the prize for the recognition of her career from the State of Madrid in 2007 (Premio Persona Singular de la Comunidad de Madrid), the Gold Medal from the Spanish State in 2009 and the Gold Medal from the Red Cross in 2013.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

She is a member of several organizations, universities and foundations such as Member of the Board of the following organizations:  L’Union Centrale des Arts Décoratifs "UCAD" de France, Christie's Auction House, The Shimon Peres Center for Peace, Guggenheim Museum, Prado Museum and The Prince of Asturias Foundation and Prize. She is also a member of the Board of trustees of University Charles III of Spain.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Alicia is known to have a very low-key way of life and an extremely discreet social life. It is rare to see her at any social event besides the ones organized by her foundation and she always uses commercial airlines when traveling.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Alicia was brought up [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] by her mother and was for some years associated with the [[Legion of Christ]].&lt;ref name=Clarin /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/cronica/2004/437/1078148131.html El Mundo: "La maravillosa fortuna de Alicia - La pequeña de las hermanas Koplowitz se ha convertido en la mujer más rica de España.

Her Cuban-born mother, Esther Romero de Juseu y Armenteros (died 1968), started a legal battle to obtain the Marquisate of El Real Socorro, which ended in 1971 with Koplowitz gaining the nobiliary title; her sister Esther obtained in court in 1988 the County of Peñalver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Galán|first1=Lola|title=Ser o no ser noble, he ahí la obsesión|url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2012/11/23/gente/1353692623_441411.html|accessdate=28 April 2017|publisher=El País|date=24 November 2012|location=Madrid|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017 she lost in court the right to be called the Marquise of Bellavista after being sued by her Cuban-American distant cousin [[María Elena de Cárdenas y González]], aged 97. The same month de Cárdenas also won in the Spanish courts the Marquisate of Almendares from another Cuban man, meanwhile in the previous month (February 2017), she gained the Marquisate of Campo Florido from Koplowitz's niece, Alicia Alcocer-Koplowitz.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elnuevoherald.com/noticias/sur-de-la-florida/article138467653.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Madrid|first=José|title=Alicia Koplowitz pierde su marquesado a manos de una nonagenaria cubana|url=http://www.vanitatis.elconfidencial.com/noticias/2017-03-16/alicia-koplowitz-pierde-marquesado-bellavista-favor-maria-elena-cardenas_1349023/|accessdate=28 April 2017|agency=El Confidencial|publisher=Vanitatis|date=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anti Kuus''' (born December 29, 1956 in [[Saaremaa]]) is an [[Estonia]]n [[entrepreneur]] and [[photographer]].

==Biography==
Kuus graduated from [[Tallinn Polytechnic Institute]] (now called [[Tallinn University of Technology]]), [[Estonian Business School]], and [[York University]] (in Canada). He has a Master’s degree in International Business Administration.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has worked as economist, finance director and, for the last 20 years, as CEO.  He has established companies Arco, Baltic Tours, AKTA, Aktaprint...
From 1989 to 1992, Kuus was a member of the City Council of [[Kuressaare]]. During Estonia's [[History of Estonia#Independent Estonia|transition from socialism to capitalism]], Kuus worked in the Kuressaare development centre called “Arco” and actively dealt with starting up entrepreneurship and foreign economic relations in [[Saaremaa]].

In 1989 he arranged an international photo festival in [[Saaremaa]] with [[Peeter Linnap]] as Art Director.

From 1995 onward, Kuus has split his time between living and working in [[Tallinn]] and leisure time on his farm in [[Saaremaa]].

==Photography==
Kuus started to take a serious interest in photography in 1991, and has since published seven books of his photographs.  He deals mostly with nature subjects, especially the natural environs of Saaremaa.  His photographs portray the sea and sky in different variations.  Each year, Kuus publishes a calendar featuring his nature photographs.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7425">'''Antoine Beaussant''' (born 1957), is a French entrepreneur, businessman and oboist. He was President of Buffet Crampon since November 2007 and was replaced in July 2014 by Jérôme Perrod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffet-group.com/sites/buffetgroup/files/2014_07_28_PR_Buffet%20Group%20CEO_UK_VF.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808042453/http://www.buffet-group.com/sites/buffetgroup/files/2014_07_28_PR_Buffet%20Group%20CEO_UK_VF.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-08-08 |title=Jérôme Perrod appointed CEO of Buffet Group |publisher=Buffet Group |date= |accessdate=2014-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antoine Beaussant completed a science [[Baccalauréat]] in 1974, at the age of 16. He graduated from Ecole de Hautes Etudes Commerciales du Nord ([[EDHEC]]) in [[Lille]] and from Institut Européen d'Administration des Affaires ([[Insead]]), where he followed the European Marketing Program.

He began his professional career in the field of new technologies and the media, first as Head of Multimedia at French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' and then at Amaury, publisher of ''[[Le Parisien]]'' and ''[[L'Équipe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronext.com/trader/companynews/companyNews-2495-EN-FR0000072969.html?selectedMep=1&amp;docid=111445 |title=Stocks &gt; News |publisher=Euronext |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an internet pioneer in France, he launched, ran and invested in a number of start-ups between 1994 and 2002. In 1999, he founded Nart,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fredforest.org/Parcelle-Reseau/fr/index.html |title=Fred Forest |publisher=Fred Forest |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the web’s first art auction site, before going on to buy L’Œil and Le Journal des Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.strategies.fr/articles/r13596W/nart-une-strategie-click-and-mortar.html |title=Stratégies - Marketing, Communication, Médias, Marques, Conseils, Publicité |publisher=Strategies.fr |date=2000-06-30 |accessdate=2012-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402040558/http://www.strategies.fr/articles/r13596W/nart-une-strategie-click-and-mortar.html |archivedate=2012-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2002 to 2005 he was deputy CEO of [[Capgemini]] Sogeti, an IT company with some 15,000 employees, and from 2005 to 2006 he was deputy CEO of ESR, an IT service provider listed on the Paris stock exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tradingsat.com/actu-bourse-5317-ESRP.html |title=ESR : Antoine Beaussant nommé Directeur Général Délégué |publisher=Trading Sat |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He combined his managing director roles with membership of the Conseil Supérieur de la Télématique, the administrative body responsible for regulating the ICT sector, a role to which he was appointed in 1992 by the French Minister for Industry and which he performed until 2000. In 1996, the government appointed him to produce a white paper on internet regulation in France, resulting in publication of the Charte de l’Internet (internet charter).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/rap/r96-436/r96-43624.html |title=L'entrée dans la société de l'information |publisher=Senat.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2001 to 2008 he was a member of the Conseil des Ventes Volontaires, France’s auctioneering regulator. He is currently chairman of the Conseil de développement de la [[Communauté d'agglomération de Mantes-en-Yvelines]], an urban planning agency in the Paris area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffet-crampon.com/fr/actualites.php?mode=printNews&amp;nid=566 |title=Clarinettes de prestige, clarinette professionnelle, saxo, basson, hautbois Buffet Crampon |publisher=Buffet-crampon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321171521/http://www.buffet-crampon.com/fr/actualites.php?mode=printNews&amp;nid=566 |archivedate=2012-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Beaussant, who is a keen [[oboist]], joined the Supervisory Board of [[Buffet Crampon]], Europe’s leading wind instrument manufacturer since its takeover by the Argos Soditic investment fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argos-soditic.com/fr/actualites/32-19012009-argos-soditic-apporte-1-million-deuros-pour-le-developpement-du-groupe-buffet-crampon.html |title=19/01/2009 - Argos Soditic apporte 1 million pour le développement du groupe Buffet-Crampon |publisher=Argos-soditic.com |date=2009-01-19 |accessdate=2012-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422171337/http://www.argos-soditic.com/fr/actualites/32-19012009-argos-soditic-apporte-1-million-deuros-pour-le-developpement-du-groupe-buffet-crampon.html |archivedate=2012-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He took control of the group in November 2007, a move which enabled him to combine his experience as a manager with his passion for music in the service of the great French professional musical instrument manufacturing tradition. Buffet Crampon was created in 1825, and with some 750 employees based in France, Germany, the United States, Japan and China, today turns over around €67 million, of which 94% outside France. It manufactures some 60,000 musical instruments every year under the [[Buffet Crampon]], [[Besson (company)|Besson]], B&amp;S, [[Antoine Courtois]], Hans Hoyer, J. [[Keilwerth]], Meinl Weston, Scherzer and W.

In 2004, Antoine Beaussant was made Chevalier de la [[Légion d’Honneur]] by the French prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marc Champenois |url=http://www.france-phaleristique.com/lh_promo_09-04-04.htm |title=Ordre de la Légion d'honneur - Nominations, promotions et élévations du 09-04-2004 |publisher=France-phaleristique.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Antoine Beaussant was appointed vice-president of CSFI (Association of Instrument Manufacturers),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csfimusique.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=47&amp;Itemid=74 |title=Qui sommes-nous ? |publisher=Csfimusique.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426000029/http://www.csfimusique.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=47&amp;Itemid=74 |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the European Association et de la Chambre syndicale Allemande (German Association).

==Personal life==

'''Armin Mordekhai Schreiner''' (25 February 1874{{spaced ndash}}29 November 1941) was influential [[Croatian people|Croatian]] industrialist, banker, [[Jew]]ish activist and member of the first [[Freemasonry]] Jewish Lodge Zagreb No. 1090 independent order of [[B'nai B'rith]].&lt;ref name="hz"&gt;{{harvtxt|Ivo Goldstein|2001|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Australian Accounting Standards Board''' ('''AASB''') is an Australian [[Government agency]] that develops and maintains [[Financial statement|financial reporting]] standards applicable to entities in the private and public sectors of the [[Economy of Australia|Australian economy]]. Also, the AASB contributes to the development of global financial reporting standards and facilitates the participation of the Australian community in global standard setting. The AASB's functions and powers are set out in the ''Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001''.&lt;ref name="ootaasb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov.au/PublicationsAndMedia/Publications/2011/Portfolio-Budget-Statements-2011-12/Report/Office-of-the-Australian-Accounting-Standards-Board |title=Office of the Australian Accounting Standards Board |publisher=The Treasury |accessdate=24 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424165103/http://www.treasury.gov.au/PublicationsAndMedia/Publications/2011/Portfolio-Budget-Statements-2011-12/Report/Office-of-the-Australian-Accounting-Standards-Board |archivedate=24 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]]’s (ASIC's) role is to enforce and regulate company and financial services laws to protect Australian consumers, investors and creditors. The AASB uses a conceptual framework to develop and evaluate accounting standards.

==Reporting standards==
The AASB makes Australian Accounting Standards, including Interpretations, to be applied by:&lt;br /&gt;
(a)	entities required by the ''Corporations Act 2001'' to prepare financial reports;&lt;br /&gt;
(b)	governments in preparing financial statements for the whole of government and the General Government Sector (GGS); and&lt;br /&gt;
(c)	entities in the private or public for-profit or not-for-profit sectors that are reporting entities or that prepare general purpose financial statements.

AASB 1053 ''Application of Tiers of Australian Accounting Standards'' establishes a differential reporting framework consisting of two tiers of reporting requirements for preparing general purpose financial statements:&lt;br /&gt;
(a)	Tier 1: Australian Accounting Standards; and&lt;br /&gt;
(b)	Tier 2: Australian Accounting Standards – Reduced Disclosure Requirements.

Tier 1 requirements incorporate International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), including Interpretations, issued by the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB), with the addition of paragraphs on the applicability of each Standard in the Australian environment.

Publicly accountable (defined in AASB 1053) for-profit private sector entities are required to adopt Tier 1 requirements, and therefore are required to comply with IFRSs.  Furthermore, other for-profit private sector entities complying with Tier 1 requirements will simultaneously comply with IFRSs.  Some other entities complying with Tier 1 requirements will also simultaneously comply with IFRSs.

Tier 2 requirements comprise the recognition, measurement and presentation requirements of Tier 1 but substantially reduced disclosure requirements in comparison with Tier 1.

Australian Accounting Standards also include requirements that are specific to Australian entities.  These requirements may be located in Australian Accounting Standards that incorporate IFRSs or in other Australian Accounting Standards.  In most instances, these requirements are either restricted to the not-for-profit or public sectors or include additional disclosures that address domestic, regulatory or other issues.  These requirements do not prevent publicly accountable for-profit private sector entities from complying with IFRSs.  In developing requirements for public sector entities, the AASB considers the requirements of International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs), as issued by the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB) of the [[International Federation of Accountants]].

==Standard application==
The original series of Australian Accounting Standards (AASs), which was applicable to entities not regulated under the Corporations Law, was issued by the former AASB and the Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (PSASB) of the Australian Accounting Research Foundation (AARF) on behalf of the professional accounting bodies, prior to 2000. The original series of AASB Standards (AASBs), which was applicable to entities regulated under the Corporations Law, was also issued by the former AASB, prior to 2000. Most AASs were superseded by AASBs for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 – as at 1 July 2011, only AAS 25 ''Financial Reporting by Superannuation Plans'' was still operative. All standards now issued by the AASB are labelled AASB Accounting Standards – their application paragraphs specify the types of entities to which they apply. 

Under the Australian ''Corporations Act 2001'', many entities are required to apply Australian Accounting Standards when preparing their financial statements. Some public sector entities are required to apply Australian Accounting Standards under either Commonwealth, state or territory legislation, through specific instructions to preparers or reporting frameworks that set out guidelines or regulations.

Members of [[CPA Australia]], the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia]] and the [[Institute of Public Accountants]] have a professional obligation to take all reasonable steps within their power to ensure that entities with which they are involved comply with Australian Accounting Standards when preparing their general purpose financial statements.

==Adopted standards==
Since 2002, the AASB implemented the broad strategic direction from the Australian Financial Reporting Council (FRC) to adopt [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB) standards for financial reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005. In July 2004, the AASB issued a number of standards that apply from 2005, including:

* Australian Accounting Standards that incorporate IASB Standards
* Other AASB Standards supporting the Australian Accounting Standards that incorporate IASB Standards
* Other AASB Standards that apply to certain types of entities

The Australian Accounting Standards that incorporate IASB Standards include:
* AASB 1 ''First-time Adoption of Australian Accounting Standards'', AASB 2 ''Share-based Payment'', etc., which incorporate   IFRS 1 ''First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards'', IFRS 2 ''Share-based Payment'', etc., being the Standards issued by the IASB since 2001
* AASB 101 ''Presentation of Financial Statements'', AASB 102 ''Inventories'', etc., which incorporate IAS 1 ''Presentation of Financial Statements'', IAS 2 ''Inventories'', etc., being the Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC), which was the predecessor to the IASB

For reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005, the Australian Accounting Standards that incorporate IASB Standards supersede their previous Australian counterparts, if any.

The other AASB Standards supplementing the Australian Accounting Standards that incorporate IASB Standards comprise:
* AASB 1023 ''General Insurance Contracts''
* AASB 1031 ''Materiality''
* AASB 1038 ''Life Insurance Contracts''
* AASB 1048 ''Interpretation and Application of Standards''
* AASB 1053 ''Application of Tiers of Australian Accounting Standards''
* AASB 1054 ''Australian Additional Disclosures''

Current Australian Accounting Standards for which there are no corresponding IASB Standards remain in force beyond 1 January 2005, even though they may be reissued in the future to update them in this new regime. These include:
* AAS 25 ''Financial Reporting by Superannuation Plans''
* AASB 1004 ''Contributions'', AASB 1039 ''Concise Financial Reports'', AASB 1049 ''Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial Reporting'', AASB 1050 ''Administered Items'', AASB 1051 ''Land Under Roads'' and AASB 1052 ''Disaggregated Disclosures''

==Life and music career==

===Childhood and early endeavors===
Born in [[Fukuoka Prefecture]], Hamasaki was raised as an only child by her mother and grandmother. Her father had left the family when she was three and never again came into contact with her.&lt;ref name="Rockin"&gt;{{cite magazine | first=Atsushi | last=Shikano | title=Interview with Ayumi Hamasaki| magazine=[[Rockin'on Japan]]| date=February 20, 2001|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news | last=Takeuchi Cullen| first=Lisa| url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/cover3.html |title=Empress of Pop|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]| accessdate=November 28, 2011 | page=3 | date=March 25, 2002 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020403135213/http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/cover3.html | archivedate=April 3, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamasaki's mother worked to support the family, so Hamasaki was primarily taken care of by her grandmother.&lt;ref name="Rockin"/&gt; She described herself as a "[[tomboy]]" when she was a teenager, and as a “strange kid” who “liked to be alone”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tan |first1=Tammi |title=Ayumi Hamasaki: A strange kid that liked to be alone |url=http://xin.msn.com/en-sg/entertainment/celebrity/ayumi-hamasaki-a-strange-kid-that-liked-to-be-alone/ar-BB9CaNM |publisher=xinmsn |accessdate=20 October 2014 |location=Singapore |date=18 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020120135/http://xin.msn.com/en-sg/entertainment/celebrity/ayumi-hamasaki-a-strange-kid-that-liked-to-be-alone/ar-BB9CaNM |archivedate=October 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age seven, Hamasaki began modeling for local institutions, such as banks, in order to supplement the family's income. She continued this career path by leaving her family at fourteen and moving to Tokyo as a model under SOS, a talent agency.&lt;ref name="Rockin"/&gt; Her modeling career did not last long; SOS eventually deemed her too short for a model and transferred her to Sun Music, a musicians' agency. Under the name of "Ayumi", Hamasaki released a rap EP, ''[[Nothing from Nothing (EP)|Nothing from Nothing]]'', on the [[Nippon Columbia]] label in 1995. She was dismissed from the label when the album failed to chart on the Oricon.&lt;ref name="allmusic" /&gt; After this failure, Hamasaki took up acting and starred in [[B-movies]] such as ''Ladys Ladys!! Sōcho Saigo no Hi'' and [[Japanese television drama|television dramas]] such as ''Miseinen'', which were poorly received by the public.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Metropolis"/&gt; From August 1995 to March 1996, Hamasaki also co-hosted the [[SoundLink]] "[[SoundLink Magazine|magazine]]" ''Hōkago no Ōsama'' (''After-school King'') for the [[Satellaview|Nintendo Satellaview]] once a week with [[Shigeru Izumiya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |script-title=ja:スーパーファミコンアワー番組表8/1～8/31 ～スーパーファミコンアワー番組ガイド～ |magazine=[[Satellaview Tsūshin|サテラビュー通信]] |date=September 1995 |volume=2 |pages=33–66 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |script-title=ja:スーパーファミコンアワー音声連動番組ガイド3/1→3/30 |magazine=サテラビュー通信 |date=April 1996 |volume=10 |pages=40–73 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing dissatisfied with her job, Hamasaki quit acting and moved in with her mother, who had recently moved to Tokyo.&lt;ref name="Rockin"/&gt;

Hamasaki was initially a good student, earning good grades in [[Education in Japan#Junior high school|junior high school]]. Eventually, she lost faith in the curriculum, thinking that the subjects taught were of no use to her. Her grades worsened as she refused to put her mind to her studies. While living in Tokyo, she attempted to further her studies at [[Horikoshi Gakuen]], a [[Education in Japan#High school|high school]] for [[the arts]], but dropped out in the first year. Hamasaki did not attend school or have a job, so she spent much of her time shopping at [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] boutiques and dancing at [[Velfarre]], an [[Avex Trax|Avex]]-owned disco club.&lt;ref name="Rockin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;

At Velfarre, she was introduced to her future producer, [[Max Matsuura]], through a friend. After hearing Hamasaki sing [[karaoke]], Matsuura offered her a recording deal, but Hamasaki suspected ulterior motives and turned the offer down.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; He persisted and succeeded in recruiting her for the Avex label in the following year.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Belfiore | first = Michael | url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003868/Ayumi-Hamasaki.html | title=Ayumi Hamasaki Biography | accessdate=June 5, 2008| publisher=Musicianguide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamasaki started vocal training, but skipped most of her classes after finding her instructors to be too rigid and the classes dull.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; When she confessed this to Matsuura, he sent her to New York to train her vocals under another method. During her foreign sojourn, Hamasaki frequently corresponded with Matsuura and impressed him with her style of writing. On her return to Japan, he suggested that she try writing her own lyrics.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;

===1998–99: Musical beginnings, ''A Song for xx'' and ''Loveppears''===
Hamasaki made her debut under Avex at 19 on April 8, 1998 with the single "[[Poker Face (Ayumi Hamasaki song)|Poker Face]]". It—and the following four singles—were not major hits, however each release was better than the last, thus gradually increasing her exposure and presence on the market. Hamasaki's debut album, ''[[A Song for ××]]'' (1999), was likewise "unassuming":&lt;ref name="VillageVoice" /&gt; the tracks, composed by Yasuhiko Hoshino, Akio Togashi (of [[Da Pump]]), and Mitsuru Igarashi (of [[Every Little Thing (band)|Every Little Thing]]), were "cautious" [[pop rock|pop-rock]] songs.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VillageVoice" /&gt; However, Hamasaki's lyrics, introspective observations about her feelings and experiences that focused on loneliness and individualism, resonated with the Japanese public.&lt;ref name="beatfreak1"&gt;{{cite magazine | title=A Song for XX | magazine=Beatfreak |date=January 1999 | volume=132|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; The songs gained Hamasaki a growing following, and the release of the album was a success: it topped the Oricon charts for five weeks and sold over a million copies.&lt;ref name="allmusic"&gt;{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p430329/biography|pure_url=yes}} | title=Ayumi Hamasaki |publisher=Allmusic | accessdate=April 17, 2008 | first=Chris | last=True}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YCTT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SCMP"&gt;{{cite news | title = Siege Mentality | page =1 |work=South China Morning Post | publisher = [[SCMP Group]] | location = Hong Kong, China | date=May 13, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; For her achievements, she earned a [[Japan Gold Disc Award]] for "Best New Artist of the Year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.riaj.or.jp/e/data/gdisc/1999.html | title=The 14th Japan Gold Disc Award 1999 | accessdate=April 17, 2008 | publisher=[[RIAJ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With ''[[Ayu-mi-x]]'' (March 1999), the first of a series of remix albums, Hamasaki began moving beyond the pop-rock of ''A Song for ××'' and began to incorporate different styles including [[trance music|trance]], [[dance music|dance]], and orchestra.&lt;ref name="VillageVoice"&gt;{{cite news | last =Walters | first =Barry | title =Turning (Japanese) Point | newspaper =[[The Village Voice]] | date =March 5, 2002 | url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0209,168697,32804,22.html | accessdate =April 19, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805144109/http://www.villagevoice.com/2002-03-05/music/turning-japanese-point/ |archivedate=August 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamasaki began to experiment with different musical styles in her singles as well, releasing dance tunes and ballads as well as remixes on the singles which spanned [[reggae]] and [[house music|house]]. The singles were milestones: Hamasaki earned her first number-one single ("[[Love (Destiny)|Love: Destiny]]") and first million-selling single ("[[A (EP)|A]]").&lt;ref name="fierce" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.riaj.or.jp/data/others/million_list/1999.html | title=Million-Selling Singles of 1999 | publisher=RIAJ | accessdate=April 19, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080417233128/http://www.riaj.or.jp/data/others/million_list/1999.html| archivedate= April 17, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her second studio album, ''[[Loveppears]]'' (November 1999), not only topped the Oricon charts, it sold nearly 3 million copies.&lt;ref name="YCTT"&gt;{{Cite news| title =You Can't Top This |work = [[The Straits Times]] | publisher = [[Singapore Press Holdings]] |location=Singapore | date =November 25, 1999|agency=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album also showcased a change in Hamasaki's lyrics. Though the lyrics of ''Loveppears'' still dealt with loneliness, many of them were written from a [[Third-person narrative|third-person]] perspective.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite magazine | title=Loveppears | magazine=Beatfreak |date=November 1999 | volume=142|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; In support of ''Loveppears'', she held her first tour, ''Ayumi Hamasaki Concert Tour 2000 A''.

[[A Film for XX]] is the first video clip collection by Ayumi Hamasaki, it was released on September 15, 1999.

===2000–02: ''Duty'', compilation releases, ''I Am...'' and ''Rainbow''===
From April to June 2000, Hamasaki released the "Trilogy", a series of singles consisting of "[[Vogue (Ayumi Hamasaki song)|Vogue]]", "[[Far Away (Ayumi Hamasaki song)|Far Away]]", and "[[Seasons (Ayumi Hamasaki song)|Seasons]]". The lyrics of these songs focused on hopelessness, a reflection of Hamasaki's disappointment that she had not expressed herself thoroughly in any of her previous lyrics and a sense of shame of her public image.&lt;ref name="Jpoint"&gt;{{cite magazine | title=Review of Ayu's Year 2000 &amp; M| magazine=J-Point|date= December 22, 2000| volume=75|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, many of the songs she wrote for her subsequent studio album, ''[[Duty (album)|Duty]]'' (September 2000), involved feelings of loneliness, chaos, confusion, and the burden of her responsibilities. She described her feelings after the writing as "unnatural" and "nervous".&lt;ref name="Rockin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cawaii10th"&gt;{{cite magazine | title=Ayu 10th Year Career Anniversary | magazine=Cawaii|date=May 2008|pages=15, 18 |author=Tsuriya, Takako|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; The musical style was darker as well; in contrast with ''Loveppears'', ''Duty'' was a [[Rock music|rock]]-influenced album with only one dance song, "[[Audience (Ayumi Hamasaki song)|Audience]]".&lt;ref name="Rockin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="profilestory"&gt;{{cite magazine | title=Side Face Story | magazine=Cawaii |date=November 2007|author=Tsuriya, Takako|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Duty'' resonated with fans: the "Trilogy" were "hit singles" ("Seasons" was a million-seller), and the album became Hamasaki's best-selling studio album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/artist/246497/ranking/cd_album/|title=Ranking of Ayumi Hamasaki's Albums by Sales|publisher=[[Oricon]]|accessdate=July 24, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100813023311/http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/artist/246497/ranking/cd_album/| archivedate= August 13, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.riaj.or.jp/data/others/million_list/2000.html | title=Million-Selling Singles of 2000 | accessdate=April 19, 2008 | publisher=RIAJ| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080418094213/http://www.riaj.or.jp/data/others/million_list/2000.html| archivedate= April 18, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2000, Hamasaki held her first [[Ayumi Hamasaki Countdown Live 2000–2001 A|New Year countdown concert]] at the [[Yoyogi National Gymnasium]].

In 2001, Avex forced Hamasaki to release her first compilation album, ''[[A Best]]'', on March 28, putting the album in "competition" with [[Hikaru Utada]]'s second studio album, ''[[Distance (Hikaru Utada album)|Distance]]''. The "competition" between the two singers (which both claimed was merely a creation of their record companies and the media) was supposedly the reason for the success of the albums; both sold over 5 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =J-pop Divas Fight It Out |work = [[Straits Times]] | publisher = [[Singapore Press Holdings]]| location=Singapore | date =April 20, 2001|agency=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In support of ''Duty'' and ''A Best'', Hamasaki held a [[Ayumi Hamasaki Dome Tour 2001 A|tour of Japan's domes]], making her one of few "top-drawer" Japanese artists to hold a concert at the [[Tokyo Dome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2007/04/19/2007041961012.html|title=Rain to Perform at Prestigious Tokyo Dome | date=April 19, 2007|accessdate=July 23, 2010|publisher=Chosun Ilbo Co|work=[[Chosun Ilbo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[I Am... (Ayumi Hamasaki album)|I Am...]]'' (January 2002) marked several milestones for Hamasaki. Hamasaki increased her control over her music by composing all of the songs on the album under the pseudonym "Crea", of which the 2000 single "[[M (song)|M]]" was the first. "[[Connected (Ayumi Hamasaki song)|Connected]]" (November 2002) and "[[A Song Is Born (song)|A Song Is Born]]" (December 2001) were the exceptions.&lt;ref name="TimeInterview2"&gt;{{cite news|first=Lisa |last=Takeuchi Cullen |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/int_ayumi2.html |title=I have very clear ideas of what I want |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=January 2, 2008 |page=2 |date=March 25, 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212005108/http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/int_ayumi2.html |archivedate=December 12, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''I Am...'' also showed evolution in Hamasaki's lyrical style: it was a retreat from the themes of "loneliness and confusion" of some of her earlier songs.&lt;ref name="Time5"&gt;{{cite news|first=Lisa |last=Takeuchi Cullen |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/cover5.html |title=Empress of Pop |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=February 2, 2008 |page=5 |date=March 25, 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228123046/http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/cover5.html |archivedate=December 28, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moved by the [[September 11 attacks]], Hamasaki revised her vision of ''I Am...'', focusing on issues such as faith and world peace.

The lyrics were also varied: themes in the album included freedom, the struggles of women, and "a summer that ends in sadness".&lt;ref name=rainbow&gt;{{cite web | url=http://avexnet.or.jp/ayu/en/special/rainbow/index2.html | title=Ayumi Hamasaki's director's notes on Rainbow | publisher= [[Avex Trax|Avex Marketing Inc.]]| accessdate=April 9, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080327060445/http://avexnet.or.jp/ayu/en/special/rainbow/index2.html| archivedate= March 27, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Hamasaki released three singles, "[[&amp; (Ayumi Hamasaki EP)|&amp;]]", "[[Forgiveness (Ayumi Hamasaki song)|Forgiveness]]", and "[[No Way to Say]]". To celebrate the release of her thirtieth single ("Forgiveness"), Hamasaki held the ''[[30th Single Collection Live (Ayumi Hamasaki)|A Museum]]'' concert at the Yoyogi National Gymnasium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Interview With Ayumi Hamasaki|magazine=Casa Brutus|date=September 2004|volume=54|pages=24–28|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mini-album ''[[Memorial Address]]'' (December 2003) was her first album to be released in CD+DVD format in addition to the regular CD-only format, a decision that came from her increased interest in the direction of her music videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |script-title=ja:浜崎あゆみ | magazine=Beat Freak ([[Avex]])| issue=192|date=January 5, 2004|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like her previous albums, ''Memorial Address'' topped the Oricon chart and sold over a million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.riaj.or.jp/data/others/million_list/2003.html | title=Million-Selling Albums of 2003|publisher=RIAJ| accessdate=January 25, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080117095927/http://www.riaj.or.jp/data/others/million_list/2003.html| archivedate= January 17, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/music/special/041222_01.html|title=Yearly Album Rankings for 2004|publisher=[[Oricon]]|accessdate=December 1, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081214060904/http://www.oricon.co.jp/music/special/041222_01.html| archivedate= December 14, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales of Hamasaki's singles began to wane.

By the end of her [[Ayumi Hamasaki Arena Tour 2003–2004 A|''Arena Tour 2003–2004'']], Hamasaki had grown dissatisfied with her position in Avex: she felt that the company was treating her as a product instead of a person.&lt;ref name=MyStoryInt&gt;{{cite magazine | title=The First-Time Stench of Being a Human|magazine=[[Oricon|Oricon Style]]|date=December 27, 2004|issue= 49–1275|pages=17–19|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with her dissatisfaction over her last two studio albums (which she thought had been rushed), this led her to begin work on ''[[My Story (Ayumi Hamasaki album)|My Story]]'' (December 2004) early. In contrast with her previous albums, ''My Story'' had no set theme, nor did Hamasaki attempt to write "something good" or even "something that would give people hope"; rather, she simply wrote freely and honestly.&lt;ref name="MyStoryInt"/&gt;&lt;ref group=fn&gt;Original text from ''Oricon Style'': "今回、正直にとか自由にっていうことはずっと頭の中にありましたね。だから、いいことを書 こうとか感動してもらおうとか、希望を持ってもらおうっていうようをことは一切意誠していなくて。単純に、ただ正直に書いていこうというだけでした。"&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the album contained mostly autobiographical lyrics about her emotions and reminiscences of her career. She approached the composition of the music with the same freedom as the lyrics, with the album's notable rock overtones expressing her liking for rock music.&lt;ref name="CawaiiF2005"&gt;{{cite magazine | title=Ayumi Hamasaki: Always our Princess| magazine=[[Cawaii]]|date=January 1, 2005|pages=10–15|author=Tsuriya, Takako|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was so pleased with the result that she declared ''My Story'' the first album she felt satisfied with.&lt;ref name="CawaiiF2005"/&gt; ''My Story'' and its singles, "[[Moments (Ayumi Hamasaki song)|Moments]]", "[[Inspire (song)|Inspire]]", and "[[Carols (song)|Carols]]", all topped the weekly Oricon charts; moreover, with sales of over 1,100,000 units, ''My Story'' became Hamasaki's last million-selling studio album according to Oricon.&lt;ref group=fn name=oricondiscrep /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riaj.or.jp/data/others/million_list/2004.html |title=Million-Selling Albums of 2004 |publisher=RIAJ |accessdate=April 9, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418094110/http://www.riaj.or.jp/data/others/million_list/2004.html |archivedate=April 18, 2008 |deadurl=yes |language=ja |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/music/special/051219_01_2.html|title=Yearly Album Rankings for 2005|publisher=[[Oricon]]|accessdate=December 1, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081215165044/http://www.oricon.co.jp/music/special/051219_01_2.html| archivedate= December 15, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; From January to April 2005, Hamasaki held the nationwide [[Ayumi Hamasaki Arena Tour 2005 A|''My Story'' arena tour]], her first album-based tour.&lt;ref name=MyStoryInt/&gt; Also in January, she began working with [[Lamoureux Orchestra]] to create ''[[My Story Classical]]'', a [[classical music|classical]] version of ''My Story''; the album served as an "alter-ego" of the mostly aggressive ''My Story''.

In December 2015, Hamasaki also contributed with the lyrics of "Diary", the debut single of fellow artist Micchie, who has been working as one of her live band's back-up singers since 2011. The lyrics "Diary" were credited to CREA, and the song was composed by Timothy Wellard, who's also been contributing as part of Hamasaki's live band and composing music for her since 2011. Micchie's single was released on December 23, 2015, through [[Nippon Crown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=miccie、浜崎あゆみツアーで披露した「Diary」を配信リリース |url=https://www.barks.jp/news/?id=1000122664 |accessdate=17 July 2018 |publisher=Barks Japan Music Network |date=23 December 2015 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 30, 2016, Hamasaki released the digital single "We are the Queens", which was used as a theme song of smartphone game ''Clash of Queens'' developed by Elex Wireless. Hamasaki herself starred in the TV commercial for the game, which was first broadcast on September 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ayumi Hamasaki Assumes Rightful Role as Queen in new CMs; new song "We are the QUEENS"|url=http://aramajapan.com/news/newrelease/ayumi-hamasaki-assumes-rightful-role-as-queen-in-new-cms-new-song-we-are-the-queens/64050/|website=Arama Japan|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018: 20th anniversary, "Trouble"===
From April 7, 2018 to July 22, 2018, Hamasaki embarked on her arena tour titled Power of Music, in celebration of her 20th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;https://aramajapan.com/news/ayumi-kicks-off-20th-anniversary-arena-tour/84462/&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Hamasaki participated in a special concert alongside the likes of Crystal Kay, Daichi Miura, LiSA, as well as King &amp; Prince.&lt;ref&gt;https://aramajapan.com/aramaexclusive/featured/ayumi-hamasaki-arashi-crystal-kay-daichi-miura-and-more-perform-on-2018-fns-uta-no-natsu-matsuri/90154/&lt;/ref&gt; Later that same month, she announced the release of her seventh extended play, [[Trouble (Ayumi Hamasaki EP)|TROUBLE]], which was released on August 15, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://aramajapan.com/news/newrelease/ayumi-hamasaki-to-release-new-album-trouble-in-august-2018/90108/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Image and artistry==
[[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] has noted that Hamasaki lacked talents such as the dance moves of [[Namie Amuro]], the "supermodel allure" of [[Hitomi (singer)|Hitomi]], and the "vocal pyrotechnics" of [[Hikaru Utada]]. Her own fans even considered her high-pitched voice screechy.&lt;ref name="SinChew" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Time2" /&gt; However, her music is sometimes considered one of the major forces in shaping Japan's current music trends; this has been attributed to her constantly changing image as well as her self-penned lyrics,&lt;ref name="SinChew" /&gt; though critics credit clever marketing strategies.&lt;ref name="Metropolis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SinChew"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time2"/&gt; Hamasaki is also noted for the visual aspects of her artistry: she is considered a fashion trendsetter, with her influence extending beyond Japan.&lt;ref name="time_photoessay2"&gt;{{cite news|first=Lisa |last=Takeuchi Cullen |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/photoessay/2.html |title=The Many Faces of Ayu |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=May 3, 2008 |page=2 |date=March 25, 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415191511/http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/photoessay/2.html |archivedate=April 15, 2008 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time3"&gt;{{cite news|first=Lisa |last=Takeuchi Cullen |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/photoessay/3.html |title=The Many Faces of Ayu |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=May 3, 2008 |page=3 |date=March 25, 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415191516/http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/photoessay/3.html |archivedate=April 15, 2008 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news| last = Pan| first = Philip P.|work=Washington Post| title=Taiwan's Teens Take Style Cues From Tokyo| date=November 27, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' says that Hamasaki has "married accessible, mainstream hits with over-the-top costumes and high-concept videos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nieman|first=Teresa|title=Why Japanese Pop Matters|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/mar/25/japanese-pop-women|accessdate=August 31, 2010|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The widespread influence of her music and her constantly changing image has meant that Hamasaki has often been compared to [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Hickey | first= David| url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fm20060622a1.html | title= The D.I.Y.

Hamasaki's lyrics and image have gained a following predominantly among the [[Generation X]] of Asia, mainly because of the "conflicting or inharmonious beauty" of her fashion and lyrics; Hamasaki's fashions combine Eastern and Western elements, and her songs, unlike those of many of her contemporaries, mostly all have English titles but contained no English lyrics (until ''Rainbow'').&lt;ref name="SinChew" /&gt; Music critic Tetsu Misaki believed that the juxtaposition of her fashionable appearance and her personal lyrics was one of her most important selling points.&lt;ref name="Jpopnonihongo1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Misaki, Tetsu |chapter=浜崎あゆみ～共感はどこまで可能か |trans-chapter=Ayumi Hamasaki: How far can empathy go? |title=Jポップの日本語―歌詞論 |trans-title=J-Pop Japanese: Lyricism |language=Japanese |location=[[Chiyoda, Tokyo]] |publisher=Sairyuusha |publication-date=July 20, 2002 |pages=23–40 |asin= |bibcode= |isbn=4-88202-752-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of her music extends beyond Japan;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-20827647_ITM | title=Viacom's MTV Networks Announces Landmark Content and Advertising Alliance with China's No. 1 Search Engine Baidu. | date=October 17, 2006 | publisher=[[PR Newswire]]|accessdate=February 5, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090111232012/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-20827647_ITM| archivedate= January 11, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; she has a "sizable [following] across Asia" and is one of the few Japanese singers whose albums have sold over 10,000 copies in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher = [[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]| url=http://www.star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2006/1/9/music/13031077&amp;sec=music| title=Discovering Fujita| date=January 9, 2006|accessdate=February 5, 2009| archiveurl= https://archive.is/20090109060610/http://www.star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2006/1/9/music/13031077&amp;sec=music| archivedate= January 9, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Brian| last=Bremner|work=BusinessWeek| url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/may2007/gb20070507_535989.htm| title=Raising Japan's Cool Quotient| date=May 7, 2007|accessdate=February 5, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090304031415/http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/may2007/gb20070507_535989.htm| archivedate= March 4, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, however, Hamasaki's domestic sales began declining due to a sluggish Japanese market and increasing [[copyright infringement|piracy]] in Japan.&lt;ref name="Time4" /&gt; As a result, she began moving toward the Asian market in 2002, performing at the 2002 MTV Asia awards in Singapore, at South Korea's "[[Asia Song Festival]]", and at a concert in Beijing to celebrate [[Sino-Japanese relations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5231327_ITM |title=Asian Stars to Shine in Seoul. |date=November 26, 2004 |publisher=[[Yonhap]] |accessdate=August 5, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207161403/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5231327_ITM |archivedate=December 7, 2008 }} (Registration needed to view article)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ZrKnkRHv?url=http://archive.japantoday.com/jp/news/233912 |archivedate=August 6, 2008 |url=http://archive.japantoday.com/jp/news/233912 |title=Japan, China celebrate 30 years with gala concert |first=Sachie |last=Kanda |date=October 10, 2002 |publisher=[[Japan Today]] |accessdate=August 5, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; With her popularity declining (due in part to the rising popularity of other singers), she made a foray into the Asian market, starting with her first tour of Asia in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=She goes all out to charm Hong Kong |url=http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/show/story/0,4136,132975,00.html |work=[[The New Paper]] |publisher=[[Singapore Press Holdings]] |date=June 12, 2007 |accessdate=February 4, 2009 |first=James |last=Kang |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616060521/http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/show/story/0%2C4136%2C132975%2C00.html |archivedate=June 16, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her debut album ''A Song for ××'' dealt mostly with themes of "loneliness and confusion", as did her second album ''Loveppears''. ''Duty'' likewise expressed feelings of disappointment and confusion. Hamasaki began to take on a more global outlook with her following albums ''I Am...'' and ''Rainbow'', branching out to wider themes such as faith and peace.&lt;ref name="Time5"/&gt; Music critic Tetsu Misaki noted a large change in her lyrics style between her debut album ''A Song for ××'' (1999), which mostly dealt with personal problems, and her following albums ''Loveppears'' and ''Duty''. Misaki believed Hamasaki had begun thinking about her influence on society more, and began writing songs with important messages she wanted to express to her listeners. This was signalled by her not using first person pronouns as much, and instead using the words {{nihongo|''bokura''|僕ら||"we"}} and {{nihongo|''tsutaeru''|伝える||"convey"}} more often.&lt;ref name="Jpopnonihongo1"/&gt; As Hamasaki matured, her lyrics began to express more confidence; themes in her later albums included love and the struggles of women.&lt;ref name="rainbow"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sweet"&gt;{{cite magazine| title=Ayumi Hamasaki | magazine=Sweet |date=January 2006|pages=18–20|author=Hayakawa, Kanako|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vivi"/&gt; With ''Guilty'', Hamasaki began to compose her lyrics not only as an exposition of her personal feelings but as encouragements for her listeners, an outlook she applied in ''Next Level'' as well. In songs such as "Talkin' 2 Myself" and "Mirrorcle World", Hamasaki deals with the "awareness and fighting spirit of surviving in a high-risk age" to encourage listeners; in "Rollin'" (from ''Next Level''), Hamasaki writes, "The age is rolling around/At the speed of heading toward the end/Beyond the border/Disappointment and hope fight with each other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fuji |first=Miho |title=Ayumi Hamasaki 『NEXT LEVEL』 |url=http://www.tokyoheadline.com/vol402/show01.html |accessdate=September 2, 2010 |newspaper=[[Tokyo Headline]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313063846/http://www.tokyoheadline.com/vol402/show01.html |archivedate=March 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to personal experiences and feelings, Hamasaki bases lyrics on sources such as historical events.

In addition to writing her own lyrics, Hamasaki has also involved herself in other aspects of production such as [[artistic direction]]. Though Max Matsuura is officially credited as the producer of her records, he said of Hamasaki, "Ayu is a very meticulous worker behind the scenes. A lot of the work she does by herself is more in the producer's arena. I think really we should say 'Produced by [A]yumi [H]amasaki'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040820032901/http://www.avexnet.or.jp/beatfreak/142/artists/ayumi.html|archivedate=August 20, 2004|url=http://www.avexnet.or.jp/beatfreak/142/artists/ayumi.html|title=Loveppears|last=Kazuki|first=Okabe|work=Beat Freak Online|publisher=[[Avex]]|accessdate=November 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- quotation translated by Delirium-Zer0 @ http://ahsforum.com/forum/member.php?u=235 --&gt; Until her single "M", however, Hamasaki left the task of composing to her staff; as she has explained, "I'm not a professional; I lack even basic knowledge about writing music."&lt;ref name="TimeInterview2" /&gt; However, she started to compose her own melodies after her staff had failed to compose a tune for "M" that appealed to her.&lt;ref name="Rockin"/&gt; Wanting to produce works faithful to her visions, Hamasaki took control of most aspects of her artistry.&lt;ref name="Time5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TimeInterview"/&gt; ''I Am...'' is representative of this stage in Hamasaki's career; she directed the production of its songs, videos, and artwork. She began to compose less after ''I Am...'': whereas nearly all of ''I Am...'' was her work, only nine of ''Rainbow'''s fifteen tracks were composed by her. She was even less involved in the composition of subsequent albums, composing two tracks on ''Memorial Address'', three on ''My Story'', and one on ''(Miss)understood''; since ''Secret'', none of the songs on her studio albums have listed her as a composer. With later albums, Hamasaki also began to delegate to her staff tasks she had once handled herself.&lt;ref name="CNNinterview"&gt;{{cite video| people=Shubert, Atika (Interviewer) | medium=TV-series | publisher=CNN | location=Japan | title=[[TalkAsia]] |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamasaki cites Madonna, [[soul music|soul]] musicians [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]] and [[En Vogue]], and rock bands [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Deep Purple]] as her influences and states that she admires [[Michelle Branch]], [[Kid Rock]], [[Joan Osborne]], [[Seiko Matsuda]], [[Rie Miyazawa]], and [[Keiko Yamada]];&lt;ref name="TimeInterview2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AvexProfile"/&gt; these diverse influences have led to the variety of her own music. Hamasaki began commissioning remixes of her songs early in her career, and this practice also influenced the diversity of her music.&lt;ref name="VillageVoice"/&gt; Found on many of her records, these remixes span different genres of [[electronic dance music]] including [[Eurobeat]], [[house music|house]], and [[trance music|trance]], as well as [[acoustic music|acoustic]] genres such as classical and [[Music of China#Traditional music|traditional Chinese music]].

For her 2007 tour ''Tour of Secret'', Hamasaki collaborated with [[Sanrio]] to create a line of merchandise, "Ayumi Hamasaki x Hello Kitty/", that features Ayupan and [[Hello Kitty]] together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/music/42797/ | title=Ayumi Hamasaki x Hello Kitty Collaboration: The Dream Is Realized! | publisher=[[Oricon]] | accessdate=November 17, 2008|date=March 9, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081207173630/http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/music/42797/| archivedate= December 7, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; The merchandise included cell phone straps and [[Lumix]] cameras decorated with a picture of Hello Kitty behind Hamasaki's "A" logo;&lt;ref group="fn"&gt;This is the symbol: [[File:Ayumi_Hamasaki_A_Logo.png]]. It is used either as a substitute for the letter ''a'' or to represent Hamasaki's name. The titles of six albums, ''Rainbow'', ''A Best'', ''A Ballads'', ''A Best 2 -White-'', ''A Best 2 -Black-'', and ''A Complete'' use this symbol; the titles of these albums appearing as ''R[[File:Ayumi_Hamasaki_A_Logo.png]]INBOW'', ''[[File:Ayumi_Hamasaki_A_Logo.png]] Best'', ''[[File:Ayumi_Hamasaki_A_Logo.png]] Ballads'', ''[[File:Ayumi_Hamasaki_A_Logo.png]] Best 2 -White-'', ''[[File:Ayumi_Hamasaki_A_Logo.png]] Best 2 -Black-'', and ''[[File:Ayumi_Hamasaki_A_Logo.png]] Complete''. (Dashes are commonly used in Japanese script to enclose subtitles.)&lt;/ref&gt; the former product was a result of a collaboration with Sanrio and Japanese fashion brand Ash &amp; Diamonds, the latter a collaboration with Sanrio and Panasonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.barks.jp/news/?id=1000031701 | title=Ayumi Hamasaki Collaboration is a Dream! | work= Barks.jp|publisher=ITmedia| accessdate=July 23, 2008|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ayuready?''===
From October 2002 to March 2004 she was also the [[Television presenter|host]] of her own talk and variety TV show, ''[[Ayuready?]]'', on [[Fuji Television]]. The talk show, aired on Saturday nights from 11:30 to midnight, often featured her performing songs with guests, among whom were [[Goto Maki]], [[Puffy AmiYumi|Puffy]], and [[Akina Nakamori]]. To promote the program (and her album ''Rainbow''), Hamasaki opened a restaurant, Rainbow House, on [[Shōnan|Shōnan Beach]] on July 1, 2003, which was open through August 31, 2003.&lt;ref name="NEP" /&gt; After less than two years, the last episode of ''Ayuready?'' aired in March 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Philanthropy==
In March 2011, Hamasaki donated 30 million yen to relief efforts for the [[Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. She also collaborated with fashion magazine ViVi to sell charity T-shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://asiapacificarts.usc.edu/article@apa?ayumi_hamasaki_donates_35_million_yen_to_relief_efforts_in_japan_16535.aspx | title = Ayumi Hamasaki donates 35 million yen to relief efforts in Japan | publisher = Asia Pacific Arts | date = March 22, 2011 | access-date = March 29, 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140209132736/http://asiapacificarts.usc.edu/article@apa?ayumi_hamasaki_donates_35_million_yen_to_relief_efforts_in_japan_16535.aspx | archive-date = February 9, 2014 | dead-url = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

On January 1, 2011, Hamasaki announced her engagement to Austrian actor and model Manuel Schwarz, whom Hamasaki met in August 2010 on the set of her music video for "[[L (Ayumi Hamasaki EP)|Virgin Road]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sponichi.co.jp/entertainment/news/2011/01/01/01.html |title=Ayumi Hamasaki's Marriage Announcement |publisher=Sponichi Annex |date=December 31, 2010 |accessdate=December 31, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104054005/http://www.sponichi.co.jp/entertainment/news/2011/01/01/01.html |archivedate=January 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 2, her office announced that she and Schwarz had married in the United States the day before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110103a8.html | title=Pop music idol Hamasaki gets married in U.S.|work=The Japan Times |date=January 3, 2011|accessdate=January 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on January 16, 2012, Hamasaki announced on her website that she would divorce Schwarz. The reason for the divorce was that, initially, Hamasaki wanted to move in with Schwarz in the United States but due to the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|earthquake and tsunami]] that hit her home country in March, 2011, she strongly desired not to leave Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tokyoreporter.com/2012/01/18/japans-empress-of-pop-ayumi-hamasaki-to-divorce-austrian-actor-husband-kyodo-says |title=Japan’s ‘Empress of Pop’ Ayumi Hamasaki to divorce Austrian actor husband |date=January 18, 2012 |accessdate=January 18, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118224809/http://www.tokyoreporter.com/2012/01/18/japans-empress-of-pop-ayumi-hamasaki-to-divorce-austrian-actor-husband-kyodo-says/ |archivedate=January 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/entertainment/view/1177364/1/.html | title=Japan's pop queen to divorce Austrian hubby |date=January 17, 2012|accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 13, 2013, it was announced on her official TeamAyu site that Hamasaki had become engaged to an American medical student 10 years her junior, whom she had been with since the spring of that year, adding: "As my partner is an ordinary student, I would be very happy if you could watch over us quietly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nikkansports.com/entertainment/news/f-et-tp0-20131213-1230913.html |title=浜崎あゆみ米国人医学生と婚約|publisher=Nikkan Sports |date=2013-12-13|accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/entertainment/view/ayumi-hamasaki-engaged-to-ucla-medical-student-10-years-her-junior |title=Ayumi Hamasaki engaged to UCLA medical student 10 years her junior |publisher=Japan Today |date=2013-12-13|accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 3, 2014, the singer announced on her fan club site "Team Ayu" that she was officially married. According to her agency, the couple already finished their marriage procedure in the United States near the end of February. On the 3rd, Hamasaki's mother, as a deputy, submitted the marriage registration to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyohive.com/article/2014/03/hamasaki-ayumi-is-now-officially-married- |title=Hamasaki Ayumi is now officially married|publisher=Tokyohive |date=2014-03-03|accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 11, 2016, Hamasaki announced that she and her husband had separated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://global-fc.net/teamayu/life/detail/?id=7125|title=2016-09-11 13:21(JST) {{!}} ayu 伝えたいこと。{{!}} TeamAyu|last=TeamAyu|first=|date=2016-09-11 |work=|newspaper=TeamAyu|access-date=2016-10-11|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 30, 2016, she announced that her divorce had been finalized;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jpopasia.com/feed/18717/ayumi-hamasaki-finalizes-2nd-divorce/|title=Ayumi Hamasaki Finalizes 2nd Divorce|last=JpopAsia|first=|date=|work=|newspaper=JpopAsia|access-date=2016-10-11|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, a motion for dissolution of the marriage was not filed until April 2017, in Los Angeles, California.

:A key factor in explaining the sad state of American education can be found in over-bureaucratization, which is seen in the compulsion to consolidate our public schools into massive factories and to increase to mammoth size our universities even in underpopulated states. The problem with bureaucracies is that they have to work hard and long to keep from substituting self-serving survival and growth for their original primary objective. Few succeed. Bureaucracies have no [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], no memory, and no [[conscience]]. If there is a single stumbling block on the road to the future, it is the bureaucracy as we know it. (p. 219)

'''Capital accumulation''' (also termed '''the accumulation of capital''') is the dynamic that [[Profit motive|motivates the pursuit of profit]], involving the [[investment]] of money or any [[financial asset]] with the [[Financial goal|goal]] of increasing the initial monetary [[Value (economics)|value]] of said asset as a [[financial return]] whether in the form of [[profit (accounting)|profit]], [[Economic rent|rent]], [[interest]], [[royalties]] or [[capital gains]]. The process of capital accumulation forms the basis of [[capitalism]], and is one of the defining characteristics of a capitalist [[economic system]].&lt;ref&gt;''Unbounded Organization and the Future of Socialism'', by Howard Richards. 2013. Education as Change, Vol. 17, No. 2, pp. 229-242: "Capital accumulation is both a dynamic and a logic. It is a dynamic that motivates human action, namely the pursuit of profit. It is a logic that defines rational decision-making, namely optimizing profits by maximizing revenue from sales while minimizing costs...The case is better understood if one takes into account that accumulation is the mainspring (according to Marx, the invariable accompaniment and virtually the definition) of capitalism."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Definition of Capital, Marxist Internet Archive Encyclopedia"&gt;''Capital'', Encyclopedia on Marxists.org: http://marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/a.htm#capital&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
{{Capitalism|Concepts}}
The definition of capital accumulation is subject to controversy and ambiguities, because it could refer to:
*a ''[[Net (economics)|net]] addition'' to existing [[Wealth#Economic analysis|wealth]]
*a ''redistribution'' of wealth.
Most often, capital accumulation involves both a net addition and a [[redistribution of wealth]], which may raise the question of who really benefits from it most. If more wealth is produced than there was before, a [[society]] becomes richer; the total [[Stock and flow|stock]] of wealth increases. But if some accumulate [[Capital (economics)|capital]] only at the expense of others, wealth is merely shifted from A to B. It is also possible that some accumulate capital much faster than others.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} When one person is enriched at the expense of another in circumstances that the law sees as unjust it is called [[unjust enrichment]].&lt;ref&gt;See generally: Mitchell et al, ''Goff &amp; Jones Law of Unjust Enrichment'' (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 8th ed, 2011); Graham Virgo, ''The Principles of the Law of Restitution'' (3rd ed, 2015); Andrew Burrows, ''The Law of Restitution'' (3rd ed, 2011); Mason, Carter, and Tolhurst, ''Mason &amp; Carter's Restitution Law in Australia'' (LexisNexis, 2nd ed, 2008). On unjust enrichment as a 'unifying legal concept', see the judgment of Deane J in ''Pavey &amp; Mathews v Paul'' (1987) 162 CLR 221.&lt;/ref&gt; In principle, it is possible that a few people or organisations accumulate capital and grow richer, although the total stock of wealth of society ''decreases''.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In [[economics]] and [[accounting]] '''capital accumulation''' is often equated with investment of profit income or savings, especially in [[real vs. nominal in economics|real]] [[capital goods]]. The concentration and [[centralisation]] of capital are two of the results of such accumulation (see below).

[[Capital (economics)|Capital]] accumulation refers ordinarily to:

*real investment in tangible means of production, such as acquisitions, research and development, etc. that can increase the capital flow.
*investment in financial assets represented on paper, yielding profit, interest, rent, [[royalties]], fees or [[capital gains]].
*investment in ''non-productive'' physical assets such as residential real estate or works of art that appreciate in value.

and by extension to:

*[[human capital]], i.e., new education and training increasing the [[Skill (labor)|skills]] of the (potential) [[labour force]] which can increase earnings from work.
*[[social capital]], i.e. the wealth and [[productive capacity]] that the people in a society hold in common, rather than as individuals or corporations.
* etc.

Both non-financial and financial capital accumulation is usually needed for [[economic growth]], since additional [[Production (economics)|production]] usually requires additional funds to enlarge the scale of production. Smarter and more [[Productivity|productive]] organization of production can also increase production without increased capital. Capital can be created without increased investment by inventions or improved organization that increase productivity, discoveries of new [[Asset (economics)|assets]] (oil, gold, minerals, etc.), the sale of property, etc.

In modern [[macroeconomics]] and [[econometrics]] the term ''[[capital formation]]'' is often used in preference to "accumulation", though the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) refers nowadays to "accumulation". The term is occasionally used in [[national accounts]].

===The measurement of accumulation===

Accumulation can be measured as the monetary value of investments, the amount of [[income]] that is reinvested, or as the change in the [[Valuation (finance)|value of assets]] owned (the increase in the value of the capital stock). Using company [[balance sheet]]s, [[tax]] data and direct [[Statistical survey|surveys]] as a basis, government statisticians estimate total investments and assets for the purpose of [[national accounts]], national [[balance of payments]] and [[flow of funds]] statistics. Usually, the [[reserve bank]]s and the [[Treasury]] provide interpretations and analysis of this [[Economic data|data]]. Standard [[Economic indicator|indicators]] include [[Capital formation]], [[Gross fixed capital formation]], [[fixed capital]], household asset wealth, and [[foreign direct investment]].

Organisations such as the [[International Monetary Fund]], UNCTAD, the [[World Bank Group]], the [[OECD]], and the [[Bank for International Settlements]] used national investment data to estimate world trends. The [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]], [[Eurostat]] and the Japan Statistical Office provide data on the USA, Europe and Japan respectively.

Other useful sources of investment information are business magazines such as ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]], [[Forbes]], [[The Economist]], [[Business Week]]'', etc., and various corporate "[[Watchdog journalism|watchdog]]" organisations and [[non-governmental organization]] publications. A reputable [[scientific journal]] is the ''[[Review of Income and Wealth]]''. In the case of the USA, the "Analytical Perspectives" document (an annex to the yearly budget) provides useful wealth and capital estimates applying to the whole country.

==Demand-led growth models==
In [[macroeconomics]], following the [[Harrod–Domar model]], the [[savings ratio]] (&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;) and the [[capital coefficient]] (&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;) are regarded as critical factors for accumulation and growth, assuming that all saving is used to finance [[fixed investment]]. The rate of growth of the real stock of fixed capital (&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;) is:

:&lt;math&gt; {{\Delta K} \over K} =  {{{\Delta K} \over Y} \over {K \over Y}}  = {s \over k }&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is the real national income. If the capital-[[Output (economics)|output]] ratio or capital coefficient (&lt;math&gt;k={K \over Y}&lt;/math&gt;) is constant, the rate of growth of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the rate of growth of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. This is determined by &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; (the ratio of net fixed investment or saving to &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.

A country might, for example, save and invest 12% of its [[Gross national income|national income]], and then if the capital coefficient is 4:1 (i.e. $4 billion must be invested to increase the national income by 1 billion) the rate of growth of the national income might be 3% annually. However, as [[Keynesian economics]] points out, [[saving]]s do not automatically mean investment (as [[Liquid capital|liquid funds]] may be [[Hoarding (economics)|hoarded]] for example). Investment may also not be investment in fixed capital (see above).

Assuming that the turnover of total production capital invested remains constant, the proportion of total investment which just maintains the stock of total capital, rather than enlarging it, will typically increase as the total stock increases. The growth rate of incomes and net new investments must then also increase, in order to accelerate the growth of the capital stock. Simply put, the bigger capital grows, the more capital it takes to keep it growing and the more [[Market (economics)|markets]] must expand.

The Harrodian model has a problem of unstable static equilibrium, since if the growth rate is not equal to the Harrodian warranted rate, the production will tend to extreme points (infinite or zero production).&lt;ref&gt;Serrano, F., Freitas, F., &amp; Bhering, G. The Trouble with Harrod: the fundamental instability of the warranted rate in the light of the Sraffian Supermultiplier.&lt;/ref&gt; The Neo-Kaleckians modelos doesn’t suffers from the Harrodian unstability but fails to deliver a  convergence dynamic of the effective capacity utilization to the planned capacity utilization.&lt;ref&gt; Fagundes, L., &amp; Freitas, F. (2017). The Role of Autonomous Non-Capacity Creating Expenditures in Recent Kaleckian Growth Models: An Assessment from the Perspective of the Sraffian Supermultiplier Model.&lt;/ref&gt; For its turn, the model of the Sraffian Supermultiplier grants a static stable equilibrium and a convergence to the planned capacity utilization.&lt;ref&gt; Serrano, F. (1995). Long period effective demand and the Sraffian supermultiplier. Contributions to Political Economy, 14(1), 67-90. &lt;/ref&gt; The Sraffian Supermultiplier model diverges from the Harrodian model since it takes the investment as induced and not as autonomous. The autonomous component in the this model is are the Autonomous Non-Capacity Creating Expenditures, such as exports, credit lead consumption and public spending. The growth rate of these expenditures determines the long run rate of capital accumulation and product growth.

==Marxist concept==
{{Marxism|Economics}}
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Surplus value]] --&gt;

In [[Karl Marx]]'s [[economic theory]], capital accumulation is the operation whereby profits are reinvested into the economy, increasing the total quantity of capital. Capital was understood by Marx to be expanding value, that is, in other terms, as a sum of capital, usually expressed in [[Marxian economics#Money|money]], that is [[Transformation in economics|transformed]] through [[Labor theory of value|human labor into a larger value]] and extracted as profits. Here, capital is defined essentially as economic or commercial asset [[Value (economics)|value]] that is used by capitalists to obtain additional value ([[surplus-value]]). This requires property relations which enable objects of value to be appropriated and [[Ownership|owned]], and trading rights to be established.

===Over-accumulation and crisis===
The Marxist analysis of capital accumulation and the development of capitalism identifies systemic issues with the process that arise with expansion of the [[productive forces]]. A crisis of [[overaccumulation]] of capital occurs when the [[rate of profit]] is greater than the rate of new profitable investment outlets in the economy, arising from increasing productivity from a rising [[organic composition of capital]] (higher capital input to labor input ratio). This depresses the [[wage]] bill, leading to stagnant wages and high rates of [[unemployment]] for the [[working class]] while excess profits search for new profitable investment opportunities. Marx believed that this cyclical process would be the fundamental cause for the [[Post-capitalism|dissolution of capitalism]] and its replacement by [[socialism]], which would operate according to a different economic dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;''The Social Dividend Under Market Socialism'', by Yunker, James. 1977. Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, Vol. 48, No. 1, pp. 93-133: "Nevertheless, while Marx employed the surplus labor value theory to undermine the moral foundations of capitalism, it was, in his view, neither to be the instrumentality of capitalist collapse, nor was it the primary reason for the desirability of the abrogation of capitalism...Surplus value was seen as providing the fuel for the cyclical engine and therefore as the fundamental cause of the impending dissolution of capitalism."&lt;/ref&gt;

In Marxist thought, socialism would succeed capitalism as the [[Socialist mode of production|dominant mode of production]] when the accumulation of capital can no longer sustain itself due to [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|falling rates of profit]] in real production relative to increasing productivity. A [[socialist economy]] would not base production on the accumulation of capital, instead basing production on the criteria of satisfying human needs and directly producing [[use-values]]. This concept is encapsulated in the principle of [[production for use]].

===Concentration and centralization===

According to Marx, capital has the tendency for concentration and [[centralization]] in the hands of richest capitalists. Marx explains:

"It is concentration of capitals already formed, destruction of their individual independence, expropriation of capitalist by capitalist, transformation of many small into few large capitals.... Capital grows in one place to a huge mass in a single hand, because it has in another place been lost by many.... The battle of competition is fought by cheapening of commodities. The cheapness of commodities demands, ''caeteris paribus'', on the productiveness of labour, and this again on the scale of production. Therefore, the larger capitals beat the smaller. It will further be remembered that, with the development of the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], there is an increase in the minimum amount of individual capital necessary to carry on a business under its normal conditions. The smaller capitals, therefore, crowd into spheres of production which Modern Industry has only sporadically or incompletely got hold of. Here competition rages.... It always ends in the ruin of many small capitalists, whose capitals partly pass into the hands of their conquerors, partly vanish."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch25.htm ''Das Kapital'', vol. 1, ch. 25]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The rate of accumulation===

In [[Marxian economics]], the ''rate of accumulation'' is defined as (1) the value of the real net increase in the stock of capital in an accounting period, (2) the proportion of realized surplus-value or profit-income which is reinvested, rather than consumed. This rate can be expressed by means of various ratios between the original capital outlay, the realized turnover, surplus-value or profit and reinvestment's (see, e.g., the writings of the economist [[Michał Kalecki]]).

Other things being equal, the greater the amount of profit-income that is [[disbursed]] as [[Personal income|personal earnings]] and used for [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] purposes, the lower the savings rate and the lower the rate of accumulation is likely to be. However, earnings spent on consumption can also [[Stimulus (economics)|stimulate]] market [[demand]] and higher investment. This is the cause of endless controversies in economic theory about "how much to spend, and how much to save".

In a boom period of capitalism, the growth of investments is [[Cumulative process|cumulative]], i.e. one investment leads to another, leading to a constantly expanding market, an expanding [[labor force]], and an increase in the [[standard of living]] for the majority of the people.

In a [[Economic stagnation|stagnating]], decadent capitalism, the accumulation process is increasingly oriented towards investment on [[Military budget|military]] and [[security forces]], [[Real estate investing|real estate]], financial [[speculation]], and [[luxury consumption]]. In that case, income from [[value-adding]] production will decline in favour of interest, rent and tax income, with as a [[corollary]] an increase in the level of permanent unemployment.

As a rule, the larger the total sum of capital invested, the higher the [[return on investment]] will be. The more capital one owns, the more capital one can also borrow and reinvest at a higher rate of profit or [[Interest rate|interest]]. The inverse is also true, and this is one factor in the widening [[Economic inequality|gap between the rich and the poor]].

[[Ernest Mandel]] emphasized that the rhythm of capital accumulation and growth depended critically on (1) the division of a society's social product between [[necessary product]] and [[surplus product]], and (2) the division of the surplus product between investment and consumption. In turn, this [[Resource allocation|allocation]] pattern reflected the outcome of [[Competition (economics)|competition]] among capitalists, competition between capitalists and workers, and competition between workers. The pattern of capital accumulation can therefore never be simply explained by commercial factors, it also involved social factors and [[economic power|power]] relationships.

===The circuit of capital accumulation from production===

Strictly speaking, capital has accumulated only when realized [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] income has been ''reinvested'' in [[capital assets]]. But the process of capital accumulation in [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]] has, as suggested in [[Capital, Volume I|the first volume]] of Marx's ''[[Das Kapital]]'', at least 7 distinct but linked moments:

*The initial investment of capital (which could be [[borrowed capital]]) in [[means of production]] and [[labor power]].
*The command over [[surplus-labour]] and its appropriation.
*The [[valorisation]] (increase in value) of capital through production of new outputs.
*The appropriation of the new output produced by employees, containing the added value.
*The realisation of surplus-value through output sales.
*The appropriation of realised surplus-value as (profit) income after deduction of costs.
*The reinvestment of profit income in production.

All of these moments do not refer simply to an economic or [[commercial process]]. Rather, they assume the existence of legal, [[Power (social and political)|social]], cultural and economic power conditions, without which [[Wealth creation|creation]], [[Distribution of wealth|distribution]] and circulation of the new wealth could not occur. This becomes especially clear when the attempt is made to create a market where none exists, or where people refuse to trade.

In fact Marx argues that the original or [[primitive accumulation of capital]] often occurs through violence, plunder, slavery, robbery, extortion and theft. He argues that the capitalist mode of production requires that [[Marx's theory of alienation|people be forced to work]] in value-adding production for someone else, and for this purpose, they must be cut off from sources of income other than selling their labor power.

===Simple and expanded reproduction===

In volume 2 of ''Das Kapital'', Marx continues the story and shows that, with the aid of bank [[credit (finance)|credit]], capital in search of growth can more or less smoothly mutate from one form to another, alternately taking the form of money capital (liquid deposits, securities, etc.), commodity capital (tradeable products, [[real estate]] etc.), or production capital (means of production and labor power).

His discussion of the simple and expanded [[reproduction (economics)|reproduction]] of the conditions of production offers a more sophisticated model of the parameters of the accumulation process as a whole. At simple reproduction, a sufficient amount is produced to sustain society at the given [[living standard]]; the stock of capital stays constant. At expanded reproduction, ''more'' product-value is produced than is necessary to sustain society at a given [[living standard]] (a surplus product; the additional product-value is available for investments which enlarge the scale and variety of production.

The [[bourgeois]] claim there is no [[economic law]] according to which capital is necessarily re-invested in the expansion of production, that such depends on anticipated profitability, market expectations and perceptions of investment risk. Such statements only explain the subjective experiences of investors and ignore the objective realities which would influence such opinions. As Marx states in Vol.2, simple reproduction only exists if the variable and surplus capital realized by Dept. 1—producers of means of production—exactly equals that of the constant capital of Dept. 2, producers of articles of consumption (pg 524). Such equilibrium rests on various assumptions, such as a constant labor supply (no population growth). Accumulation does not imply a necessary change in total magnitude of value produced but can simply refer to a change in the composition of an industry (pg. 514).

[[Ernest Mandel]] introduced the additional concept of ''contracted economic reproduction'', i.e. reduced accumulation where business operating at a loss outnumbers growing business, or economic reproduction on a decreasing scale, for example due to wars, natural disasters or de[[valorisation]].

Balanced [[economic growth]] requires that different factors in the accumulation process expand in appropriate proportions. But markets themselves cannot spontaneously create that balance, in fact what drives business activity is precisely the imbalances between [[supply and demand]]: inequality is the motor of growth. This partly explains why the worldwide pattern of economic growth is very uneven and unequal, even although markets have existed almost everywhere for a very long time. Some people argue that it also explains government regulation of market trade and [[protectionism]].

===Origins===
According to Marx, capital accumulation has a double origin, namely in trade and in [[Confiscation|expropriation]], both of a legal or illegal kind. The reason is that a stock of capital can be increased through a process of exchange or "trading up" but also through directly taking an asset or resource from someone else, without compensation. [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] calls this [[accumulation by dispossession]]. Marx does not discuss gifts and [[Grant (money)|grants]] as a source of capital accumulation, nor does he analyze taxation in detail (He couldn't, as he died even before completing his major book, Das Kapital). Nowadays the tax take is often so large (i.e., 25-40% of GDP) that some authors refer to [[state capitalism]]. This gives rise to a proliferation of [[tax havens]] to evade tax liability.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The continuation and progress of capital accumulation depends on the removal of obstacles to the expansion of trade, and this has historically often been a violent process. As markets expand, more and more new opportunities develop for accumulating capital, because more and more types of goods and services can be traded in. But capital accumulation may also confront resistance, when people refuse to sell, or refuse to buy (for example a [[Strike action|strike]] by investors or workers, or [[consumer resistance]]).

===Capital accumulation as social relation===
{{Overquotation|section|date=December 2017}}
"Accumulation of capital" sometimes also refers in Marxist writings to the reproduction of [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[social relations]] (institutions) on a larger scale over time, i.e., the expansion of the size of the [[proletariat]] and of the wealth owned by the bourgeoisie.

This interpretation emphasizes that capital ownership, predicated on command over labor, is a social relation: the growth of capital implies the growth of the [[working class]] (a "[[law of accumulation]]"). In the first volume of ''Das Kapital'' Marx had illustrated this idea with reference to [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]]'s theory of colonisation:

{{Quotation|"...Wakefield discovered that in the Colonies, property in money, means of subsistence, machines, and other means of production, does not as yet stamp a man as a capitalist if there be wanting the correlative — the wage-worker, the other man who is compelled to sell himself of his own free-will. He discovered that capital is not a thing, but a social relation between persons, established by the instrumentality of things. Mr. Peel, he moans, took with him from England to [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]], West Australia, means of subsistence and of production to the amount of £50,000. Mr. Peel had the foresight to bring with him, besides, 3,000 persons of the working-class, men, women, and children. Once arrived at his destination, “Mr. Peel was left without a servant to make his bed or fetch him water from the river.” Unhappy Mr. Peel, who provided for everything except the export of English modes of production to Swan River!"|[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch33.htm ''Das Kapital'', vol. 1, ch. 33]}}

In [[Capital, Volume III|the third volume]] of ''Das Kapital'', Marx refers to the "fetishism of capital" reaching its highest point with ''interest-bearing capital'', because now capital seems to grow of its own accord without anybody doing anything. In this case,

{{Quotation|"The relations of capital assume their most externalised and most fetish-like form in interest-bearing capital. We have here &lt;math&gt;M - M'&lt;/math&gt;, money creating more money, self-expanding value, without the process that effectuates these two extremes. In merchant's capital, &lt;math&gt;M - C - M'&lt;/math&gt;, there is at least the general form of the capitalistic movement, although it confines itself solely to the sphere of circulation, so that profit appears merely as profit derived from alienation; but it is at least seen to be the product of a social relation, not the product of a mere thing. (...) This is obliterated in &lt;math&gt;M - M'&lt;/math&gt;, the form of interest-bearing capital. (...) The thing (money, commodity, value) is now capital even as a mere thing, and capital appears as a mere thing. The result of the entire process of reproduction appears as a property inherent in the thing itself. It depends on the owner of the money, i.e., of the commodity in its continually exchangeable form, whether he wants to spend it as money or loan it out as capital. In interest-bearing capital, therefore, this automatic fetish, self-expanding value, money generating money, are brought out in their pure state and in this form it no longer bears the birth-marks of its origin. The [[social relations|social relation]] is consummated in the relation of a thing, of money, to itself.—Instead of the actual transformation of money into capital, we see here only form without content."|[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1894-c3/ch24.htm "Das Kapital", vol.1, ch. 24]}}

==Markets with social influence== 
Product recommendations and information about past purchases have been shown to influence consumers choices significantly whether it is for music, movie, book, technological, and other type of products.

'''Carlos Víctor Aramayo''' (7 October 1889, [[Paris]] – 14 April 1981, Paris)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6pQuAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Carlos+Víctor+Aramayo+1889&amp;dq=Carlos+Víctor+Aramayo+1889&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB-t6Ys_nZAhXB2aQKHfP-D3wQ6AEIJzAB Profile of Carlos Víctor Aramayo]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rulers.org/indexa4.html&lt;/ref&gt; was a Bolivian industrialist and politician.

==Biography==
Aramayo was one of [[Bolivia]]'s three principal [[tin]] [[magnates]] alongside [[Simón Iturri Patiño]] and [[Mauricio Hochschild]] in the early 20th century. Responsible for over half of global [[tin]] production, they were known as the three [[tin]] barons.

In 1926, Carlos Víctor Aramayo was appointed President of Compagnie Aramayo de Mines en Bolivie SA (CAMB) with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. The holding company represented the assets of the Aramayo family in mining (mainly Bismuth, Tin, Tungsten and other metals) and land properties across Bolivia.

As CAMB President, one of Aramayo's first major decision was to form a subsidiary for CAMB in charge of the purchase of machinery and supplies and for hiring specialist personnel around Europe. In 1929, Mining and Chemical Products Ltd (MCP) was formed in London. Around the same time, Aramayo was appointed as Bolivia's Ambassador to [[London]] and then to Paris.

In 1935, Aramayo was appointed as Bolivia Finance minister by president [[José Luis Tejada Sorzano]].

Throughout the [[Second World War]], MCP contributed to the Allied war effort by producing and selling vital anti-aircraft gun components exclusively to the US and to the UK.

In 1952 CAMB's mines and all other properties in Bolivia were nationalised by the [[Bolivian revolution]] of 1952.

During his lifetime, Aramayo held numerous responsible positions in his country and abroad as Newspaper owner (La Razon), Member of Congress, Ambassador of Bolivia to London and Paris, Minister of Finance and Minister of Foreign Affairs during president Sorzano's term.

After his death, he was succeeded as President of CAMB and MCP by his nephew [[John German-Ribon]].

}}A '''communications audit''' is a comprehensive evaluation of an organization’s ability to send, receive and share information with various audiences within the organization (and as organizations become flatter to allow groups within the organization to cooperate and share among themselves), as well at key constituencies outside, such as customers and investors, in the case of publicly traded companies.  This type of [[audit]] can be performed to evaluate an organization's external or internal [[communication]] effectiveness. The purpose of a communications audit is to uncover the strengths and weaknesses between management, typically, and employees, customers and other groups such as investors, the news media, and regulators and legislative bodies with the objective to improve future communications by developing a strategic plan, through a series of recommendations, and to determine where gaps exists which need to be bridged.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Brenda. [http://www.sideroad.com/Business_Communication/communications-audit.html "Communications Audit: How Can It Help You?"], "The Side Road". Retrieved on 2010-09-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

A communications audit may be undertaken by corporate communications team or by outside consultants who are retained by management to assess the company’s communications effectiveness in accordance with the business objectives, compare the company vs. competitors, and identify target audience perceptions and motivators. The resulting strategic positioning and corresponding communications plan is focused on achieving strategic communications objectives – whether they be to achieve brand recognition, modify perceptions, maximize sales, encourage community support or establish leadership.  If an outside auditor is retained, the auditor may include an evaluation of the corporate communications staff and the activities of the corporate communications department with recommendations to management designed to streamline departmental communications and inter-company communications effectiveness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5189">In [[consumer rights]] legislation and practice, a '''cooling-off period''' is a period of time following a purchase when the purchaser may choose to cancel a purchase, and [[returning|return goods]] which have been supplied, for any reason, and obtain a full refund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/ago/consumer-resources/consumer-information/retail-rights/cancel-a-sale.html|title=Cooling-Off Periods, Right to Cancel a Sale|author=[[Martha Coakley]]|publisher=Attorney General of Massachusetts|accessdate=2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws==
Many nations have passed laws that create cooling off periods for specific transactions, although the conditions under which they may apply and the transactions covered by the laws varies significantly by jurisdiction. For example, within the United States, the federal government imposes 72-hour cooling down periods for many consumer transactions completed at home or away from the seller's traditional place of business.&lt;ref name=lars&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How Can You Get Out of a Contract|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/canceling-contracts|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=16 March 2018|date=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many U.S. states impose versions of those cooling down period laws, and offer similar laws for an additional range of transactions, such as time share purchases and health club contracts.&lt;ref name=lars/&gt; For example, California provides cooling-off periods for many consumer transactions, including insurance purchases, car warranties, dental services, and weight-loss services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blaine|first1=Tristan|title=Contract Cancellation periods or “Cooling off periods”|url=http://la.lawsoup.org/legal-guides/laws-by-role/consumer/contract-cancellation-cooling-off-periods/|website=LawSoup LA|publisher=Law Offices of Tristan D. Blaine|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union]] allows residents of member states to seek refunds for goods and services purchased outside of a shop, such as by telephone, mail order or in response to a door-to-door sales pitch, to cancel the transaction, return any purchase and obtain a refund within fourteen days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guarantees and returns|url=https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/shopping/guarantees-returns/index_en.htm|website=Your Europe|publisher=European Union|accessdate=16 March 2018|date=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Refund policies ==
Although not technically cooling off periods, many retailers voluntarily grant purchasers a defined period of time during which they may return products that have not been damaged and remain in salable condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Kelvin|title=Refunds and Exchanges: What to Know Before You Go Shopping|url=https://www.bbb.org/central-georgia/news-events/news-releases/2017/12/refunds-and-exchanges-what-to-know-before-you-go-shopping/|website=Better Business Bureau|accessdate=16 March 2018|date=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some jurisdictions require retailers to offer return policies. For example, in the European Union the [[Consumer Rights Directive]] of 2011 obliges [[Member state of the European Union|member states]] to give purchasers the right to return goods or cancel services purchased from a business away from a normal commercial premises, such as [[e-commerce|online]], [[mail order]], or [[door-to-door]], with limited exceptions, within two weeks or one year if the seller did not clearly inform the purchaser of their rights from the receipt of the goods, for a full refund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-11-450_en.htm?locale=en|title=Consumer Rights: 10 ways the new EU Consumer Rights Directive will give people stronger rights when they shop online|publisher=[[European Commission]]|date=2011-06-23|accessdate=2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Consumer Rights Directive is implemented in the [[United Kingdom]] by the Consumer Contracts (information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013.

== Experimental economics ==
The effects of cooling-off periods have been studied in [[experimental economics]] in the context of the so-called [[ultimatum game]]. In this game, one party makes an offer to divide a pie (say, 10 dollars). Then another party can accept or reject the offer. When the offer (say, 8 dollars for the first party and 2 dollars for the second party) is accepted, the parties get the respective payments. When the offer is rejected, both parties get zero. Cooling-off periods can reduce the rejection rates of unfair offers when the parties perceive the stakes to be large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oechssler|first=Jörg|last2=Roider|first2=Andreas|last3=Schmitz|first3=Patrick W.|date=2015|title=Cooling Off in Negotiations: Does it Work?|url=https://doi.org/10.1628/093245615X14307212950056|journal=Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics JITE|language=en|volume=171|issue=4|pages=565–588|doi=10.1628/093245615x14307212950056|issn=0932-4569|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crescent Bay''' is a {{convert|108|acre|m2|sing=on}} under-construction [[Upscale shopping|upscale]] [[Mixed-use development|mixed-use]] [[oceanfront]] development in [[Defence, Karachi|Defence]], [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]]. It is considered as one of the biggest Projects in Pakistan.

The development feature's a series of high and mid-rise towers for [[residential]] and [[Commerce|commercial]] use, a [[shopping centre]], a five-star beachfront hotel and an Iconic tower located in the heart of the project. The development includes approximately 4,000 residential apartments. Launched on May 31, 2006, when completed the development would be the first development with a private beach and also the first based on [[reclaimed land]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/208375/emaar-seeks-more-time-in-crescent-bay-case/|title=Emaar seeks more time in Crescent Bay case  - The Express Tribune|date=2011-07-12|website=The Express Tribune|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even-though the development sold out in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.riazhaq.com/2008/02/emaars-crescent-bay-project-sold-out-in.html|title=Haq's Musings: Emaar's Crescent Bay Project Sold Out in  Karachi|website=www.riazhaq.com|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has faced significant delay's, initially due to the [[liquidity crisis]] faced by [[Emaar Properties]] following the [[2008 financial crisis]]. Later, due to a legal battle with [[Defence Housing Authority|DHA Ltd]] for allegedly for breach of contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/204627/dha-takes-over-crescent-bay-project-on-the-rocks/|title=DHA takes over: Crescent Bay project on the rocks  - The Express Tribune|date=2011-07-07|website=The Express Tribune|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction resumed in mid-2015 and is contracted to [[NESPAK]].

'''Dough sheeting technology''' is used by (industrial) [[bakeries]] and rolls out [[dough]] into a (consistent) dough sheet with a desired even dough thickness.

==Process==
Dough is compressed between two or more rotating rollers.&lt;ref name=Patent&gt;{{cite web|title=Dough sheeting apparatus|url=https://www.google.com/patents/WO2005027645A1?cl=en&amp;dq=dough+sheeting&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8gkQU8yrN8_xoATYnIKoCQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When done the right way, a smooth and consistent dough sheet is produced. The dough then passes one or several gauging rollers (mostly on [[conveyor system|conveyors]]) that reduce the dough to the required thickness.  After this the dough sheet is shaped into a desired dough product. This technology is mainly used in industrial production machines for (semi) industrial bakeries and the food industry.  Most dough sheeters can handle a wide variety of dough depending on the machine manufacturer. Most commonly dough sheeting technology is used for the production of [[laminated dough]] products like [[croissants]] and [[pastries]], but it is also suitable for the production of [[bread]], [[flatbread]] and [[pizza]].

==Function==
*	Shape the dough from individual dough batch to continuous dough sheet
*	Less damaging of the [[gluten]] network
*	Laminate layers of dough together (no pocket proofers and dividers are necessary as the dough sheet is the base of every product).

==Benefits==
A big benefit for using sheeting technology is the large dough capacity that can be handled. Dough sheeting manufactures are able to process high quality dough sheets at high capacities.
An other benefit is that sheeting makes it possible to handle a great variety of dough types which traditional dough production systems can’t handle, for example strongly hydrated wet and sticky [[ciabatta]] dough.

==History==
The origin of the dough sheeting process is not specifically traced back to at least 1977 in the case of Rademaker BV, who may be considered to be one of the earliest dough sheeting technology specialists.

[[Croissants]] and [[puff pastry]] were first products to have been produced with dough sheeting technology. Nowadays the bakery industry sees a trend that also includes the production of [[bread]], [[flatbread]] and [[pizza]] products being produced with sheeting technology.

'''Electronic textiles''', also known as '''smart garments''', '''smart clothing''', '''smart textiles''', or '''smart fabrics''', are [[fabric]]s that enable [[Digital electronics|digital]] components such as a battery and a light (including small [[computer]]s), and electronics to be embedded in them. Smart textiles are fabrics that have been developed with new technologies that provide added value to the wearer. Pailes-Friedman of the Pratt Institute states that "what makes smart fabrics revolutionary is that they have the ability to do many things that traditional fabrics cannot, including communicate, transform, conduct energy and even grow".&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite web|title = What Is The Future Of Fabric? These Smart Textiles Will Blow Your Mind|author = Gaddis, Rebecca|date = May 7, 2014|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites#/sites/forbesstylefile/2014/05/07/what-is-the-future-of-fabric-these-smart-textiles-will-blow-your-mind/|website = Forbes|accessdate = 2015-10-16|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170307204934/https://www.forbes.com/sites/#/sites/forbesstylefile/2014/05/07/what-is-the-future-of-fabric-these-smart-textiles-will-blow-your-mind/|archivedate = March 7, 2017|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Smart textiles can be broken into two different categories: aesthetic and performance enhancing. Aesthetic examples include fabrics that light up and fabrics that can change colour. Some of these fabrics gather energy from the environment by harnessing vibrations, sound or heat, reacting to these inputs. The colour changing and lighting scheme can also work by embedding the fabric with electronics that can power it. Performance enhancing smart textiles are intended for use in athletic, extreme sports and military applications. These include fabrics designed to regulate body temperature, reduce wind resistance, and control muscle vibration – all of which may improve athletic performance. Other fabrics have been developed for protective clothing, to guard against extreme environmental hazards, such as radiation and the effects of space travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Applications of Smart and Interactive Textiles|url=http://textilelearner.blogspot.com/2013/04/applications-of-smart-and-interactive.html|website=Textile Learner|publisher=Saddamhusen Jamadar|accessdate=2013-04-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612145109/http://textilelearner.blogspot.com/2013/04/applications-of-smart-and-interactive.html|archivedate=2013-06-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The health and beauty industry is also taking advantage of these innovations, which range from drug-releasing medical textiles, to fabric with moisturizer, perfume, and anti-aging properties.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt; Many smart clothing, [[wearable technology]], and [[wearable computing]] projects involve the use of e-textiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Smart textiles: Challenges and opportunities|url = http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jap/112/9/10.1063/1.4742728|journal = Journal of Applied Physics|date = 2012-11-01|issn = 0021-8979|pages = 091301|volume = 112|issue = 9|doi = 10.1063/1.4742728|first = Kunigunde|last = Cherenack|first2 = Liesbeth van|last2 = Pieterson|publication-date = 7 November 2012|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150529161600/http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jap/112/9/10.1063/1.4742728|archivedate = 29 May 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electronic textiles are distinct from [[wearable computing]] because emphasis is placed on the seamless integration of textiles with electronic elements like microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators. Furthermore, e-textiles need not be wearable.  For instance, e-textiles are also found in interior design.

The related field of [[fibretronics]] explores how electronic and computational functionality can be integrated into textile fibers.

A new report from Cientifica Research examines the markets for textile based wearable technologies, the companies producing them and the enabling technologies. The report identifies three distinct generations of textile wearable technologies:

# "First generation" attach a sensor to apparel. This approach is currently taken by sportswear brands such as Adidas, Nike and Under Armour
# "Second generation" products embed the sensor in the garment, as demonstrated by current products from Samsung, Alphabet, Ralph Lauren and Flex.
# In "third generation" wearables, the garment is the sensor. A growing number of companies are creating pressure, strain and temperature sensors for this purpose.

Future applications for e-textiles may be developed for sports and well-being products, and medical devices for patient monitoring. Technical textiles, fashion and entertainment will also be significant applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.innovationintextiles.com/new-report-smart-textiles-and-wearables-markets-applications-and-technologies/|title=Smart Textiles and Wearables - Markets, Applications and Technologies|date=September 7, 2016|work=Innovation in Textiles|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160907145805/http://www.innovationintextiles.com/new-report-smart-textiles-and-wearables-markets-applications-and-technologies/|archivedate=September 7, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The basic materials needed to construct e-textiles, conductive threads and fabrics have been around for over 1000 years. In particular, artisans have been wrapping fine metal foils, most often gold and silver, around fabric threads for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, J., ed. Textiles, 5,000 years: an international history and illustrated survey. H.N. Abrams, New York, NY, USA, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of [[Queen Elizabeth I]]'s gowns, for example, were embroidered with [[Goldwork (embroidery)|gold-wrapped threads]].
 
At the end of the 19th century, as people developed and grew accustomed to electric appliances, designers and engineers began to combine electricity with clothing and jewelry—developing a series of illuminated and motorized necklaces, hats, brooches and costumes.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin, C. When Old Technologies Were New: Thinking About Electric Communication in the Late Nineteenth Century. Oxford University Press, USA, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gere, C. and Rudoe, J. Jewellery in the Age of Queen Victoria: A Mirror to the World. British Museum Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the late 1800s, a person could hire young women adorned in light-studded evening gowns from the Electric Girl Lighting Company to provide cocktail party entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1884/04/26/archives/electric-girls.html|title=ELECTRIC GIRLS.|date=26 April 1884|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112225331/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0912FB3A5C15738DDDAF0A94DC405B8484F0D3|archivedate=12 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In 1968, the Museum of Contemporary Craft in New York City held a ground-breaking exhibition called Body Covering that focused on the relationship between technology and apparel. The show featured astronauts' space suits along with clothing that could inflate and deflate, light up, and heat and cool itself.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, P. Body Covering. Museum of Contemporary Crafts, the American Craft Council, New York, NY, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly noteworthy in this collection was the work of Diana Dew, a designer who created a line of electronic fashion, including [[electroluminescent]] party dresses and belts that could sound alarm sirens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecreatorsproject.com/blog/the-original-creators-diana-dew |title=The Original Creators: Diana Dew |last1=Flood |first1=Kathleen |date=11 April 2011 |website=VICE Media LLC |access-date=May 28, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219075111/http://www.thecreatorsproject.com/blog/the-original-creators-diana-dew |archivedate=19 December 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, inventor Harry Wainwright created the first fully animated sweatshirt. The shirt consisted of fiber optics, leads, and a microprocessor to control individual frames of animation. The result was a full color cartoon displayed on the surface of the shirt. in 1995, Wainwright went on to invent the first machine enabling fiber optics to be machined into fabrics, the process needed for manufacturing enough for mass markets and, in 1997, hired a German machine designer, Herbert Selbach, from Selbach Machinery to produce the world's first CNC machine able to automatically implant fiber optics into any flexible material.  Receiving the first of a dozen patents based on LED/Optic displays and machinery in 1989, the first CNC machines went into production in 1998 beginning with the production of animated coats for Disney Parks in 1998. The first ECG bio-physical display jackets employing LED/optic displays were created by Wainwright and David Bychkov, the CEO of Exmovere at the time in 2005 using GSR sensors in a watch connected via Bluetooth to the embedded machine washable display in a denim jacket and were demonstrated at the Smart Fabrics Conference held in Washington, D.C. May 7, 2007. Additional smart fabric technologies were unveiled by Wainwright at two Flextech Flexible Display conferences held in Phoenix, AZ, showing infrared digital displays machine-embedded into fabrics for [[Identification friend or foe|IFF (Identification of Friend or Foe)]] which were submitted to BAE Systems for evaluation in 2006 and won an "Honorable Mention" award from NASA in 2010 on their Tech Briefs, "Design the Future" contest.  MIT personnel purchased several fully animated coats for their researchers to wear at their demonstrations in 1999 to bring attention to their "Wearable Computer" research. Wainwright was commissioned to speak at the Textile and Colorists Conference in Melbourne, Australia on June 5, 2012 where he was requested to demonstrate his fabric creations that change color using any smart phone, indicate callers on mobile phones without a digital display, and contain WIFI security features that protect purses and personal items from theft.

In the mid 1990s a team of MIT researchers led by [[Steve Mann]], [[Thad Starner]], and [[Sandy Pentland]] began to develop what they termed [[wearable computer]]s. These devices consisted of traditional computer hardware attached to and carried on the body. In response to technical, social, and design challenges faced by these researchers, another group at MIT, that included Maggie Orth and Rehmi Post, began to explore how such devices might be more gracefully integrated into clothing and other soft substrates. Among other developments, this team explored integrating digital electronics with conductive fabrics and developed a method for embroidering electronic circuits.&lt;ref name="PostOrth2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Post|first1=E.

Fashion houses like CuteCircuit are utilizing e-textiles for their haute couture collections and specialty projects. CuteCircuit's Hug Shirt allows the user to send electronic hugs through sensors within the garment.

== Overview ==
The field of e-textiles can be divided into two main categories:
* E-textiles with classical electronic devices such as conductors, [[integrated circuit]]s, [[light emitting diodes|LEDs]], OLEDs and conventional batteries embedded into garments. 
* E-textiles with electronics integrated directly into the textile substrates. This can include either passive electronics such as conductors and resistors or active components like transistors, diodes, and solar cells.

Most research and commercial e-textile projects are hybrids where electronic components embedded in the textile are connected to classical electronic devices or components. Some examples are touch buttons that are constructed completely in textile forms by using conducting textile weaves, which are then connected to devices such as music players or LEDs that are mounted on woven conducting fiber networks to form displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lumalive.com/ |title=LumaLive.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206192014/http://www.lumalive.com/ |archivedate=2010-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sensors ==
Smart textile fabric can be made from materials ranging from traditional cotton, polyester, and nylon, to advanced Kevlar with integrated functionalities. At present, however, fabrics with electrical conductivity are of interest. Electrically conductive fabrics have been produced by deposition of metal nanoparticles around the woven fibers. The resulting metallic fabrics are conductive, hydrophilic and have high electroactive surface areas. These properties render them ideal substrates for electrochemical biosensing, which has been demonstrated with the detection of DNA and proteins.&lt;ref name="Grell2018"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grell|first=Max|last2=Dincer|first2=Can|last3=Le|first3=Thao|last4=Lauri|first4=Alberto|last5=Nunez Bajo|first5=Estefania|last6=Kasimatis|first6=Michael|last7=Barandun|first7=Giandrin|last8=Maier|first8=Stefan A.|last9=Cass|first9=Anthony E.

There are two kinds of smart textile (fabric) products that have been developed and studied for health monitoring: Fabric with textile-based sensor electronics and fabric that envelopes traditional sensor electronics. It has shown that weaving can be used to incorporate electrically conductive yarn into a fabric to obtain a textile that can be used as a "Wearable Motherboard". It can connect multiple sensors on the body, such as wet gel ECG electrodes, to the signal acquisition electronics. Later research has shown that conductive yarns can be instrumental in the fabrication of textile-based sensors made of fabric or metallic meshes coated with silver or conductive metal cores woven into the fabric.&lt;ref name="Shyamkumar2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shyamkumar|first=Prashanth|author2=Pratyush Rai|author3=Sechang Oh|author4=Mouli Ramasamy|author5=Robert Harbaugh|author6=Vijay Varadan|year=2014|title=Wearable Wireless Cardiovascular Monitoring Using Textile-Based Nanosensor and Nanomaterial Systems|journal=Electronics|volume=3|issue=3|pages=504–520|doi=10.3390/electronics3030504|issn=2079-9292}}  [[File:CC-BY_icon.svg|50x50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [[creativecommons:by-sa/3.0/|Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License]]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two broad approaches to the fabrication of garments with ECG sensor electrodes in research:
* Finished garments through functionalization or integration of finished garments with sensor elements. This approach involves the integration of finished electrodes into finished garments by simply stitching the electrodes at the appropriate locations on the garment or using deposition techniques to transfer the functional materials at the appropriate locations.
* Unfinished garments. The introduction of smart materials during the garment fabrication process. This in Finished approach entails the use of textile fabrication techniques to form woven or nonwoven fabrics with the inclusion of functional materials.&lt;ref name="Shyamkumar2014"/&gt;

== Fibretronics ==
Just as in classical electronics, the construction of electronic capabilities on textile fibers requires the use of conducting and semi-conducting materials such as a [[conductive textile]]. {{citation needed|date=January 2011}} There are a number of commercial fibers today that include [[metallic fiber]]s mixed with textile fibers to form conducting fibers that can be woven or sewn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atalay|first=Ozgur|last2=Kennon|first2=William|last3=Husain|first3=Muhammad|last4=Atalay|first4=Ozgur|last5=Kennon|first5=William Richard|last6=Husain|first6=Muhammad Dawood|date=2013-08-21|title=Textile-Based Weft Knitted Strain Sensors: Effect of Fabric Parameters on Sensor Properties|url=https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/13/8/11114|journal=Sensors|language=en|volume=13|issue=8|pages=11114–11127|doi=10.3390/s130811114|pmc=3812645|pmid=23966199}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because both metals and classical [[semiconductors]] are stiff material, they are not very suitable for textile fiber applications, since fibers are subjected to much stretch and bending during use.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

One of the most important issues of e-textiles is that the fibers should be washable. Electrical components would thus need to be insulated during washing to prevent damage. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

A new class of electronic materials that are more suitable for e-textiles is the class of [[organic electronics]] materials, because they can be conducting, as well as semiconducting, and designed as inks and plastics.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Some of the most advanced functions that have been demonstrated in the lab include:
* Organic fiber transistors:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121655064/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 |title=Electronic Textiles: Fiber-Embedded Electrolyte-Gated Field-Effect Transistors for e-Textiles|journal=Advanced Materials|via=Wiley Online Library |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |date=22 January 2009|volume=21|issue=5|doi=10.1002/adma.200990013|author1=Hamedi, M.|author2= Herlogsson, L.|author3= Crispin, X.|author4=Marcilla, R.|author5=Berggren, M. |author6=Inganäs, O.|pmid=21162140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/v6/n5/abs/nmat1884.html|title=Towards woven logic from organic electronic fibres|date=4 April 2007|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|journal=Nature Materials|volume=6|issue=5|pp=357–362|doi=10.1038/nmat1884|pmid=17406663|vauthors=Hamedi M, Forchheimer R, Inganäs O|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212194447/http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/v6/n5/abs/nmat1884.html|archivedate=12 December 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first textile fiber transistor that is completely compatible with textile manufacturing and that contains no metals at all.

==Early life==
Born at [[Hamilton, Ontario]], he was the son of John Cape (1841–1908) and Margaret Kittson (1843–1887), daughter of William Henry Kittson (1810–1882), Collector of Customs at Hamilton. He took his middle names from the family of his maternal grandmother, Harriet Meredith, sister of [[Edmund Allen Meredith]]. His maternal grandfather, William Kittson, was a stepson of [[Alexander Henry the elder|Alexander Henry]] and brother of [[Norman Kittson]]. Educated at Hamilton and [[McGill University]] ([[Bachelor of Applied Science|B.A.Sc.]], 1898).

==Career==
He started his career as the Assistant [[Engineer]] of the [[Lake Superior]] Power Company at [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]]. He was promoted to Chief Engineer during the construction of the [[Canada Car Company]], and afterwards practised for some years as a [[Civil engineer|Civil Engineer]] at [[Montreal]]. In 1908, he founded E.G.M. Cape &amp; Co., Engineers and Contractors of Montreal, which still exists today with the head office at [[Toronto]]. He retired as Chairman of the Board in 1958. He was a member of the [[Engineering Institute of Canada]] and of the [[Montreal Board of Trade]]. He was a Governor of the [[Montreal General Hospital]] and the Western General Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/EdmundGravesMeredithCape.htm The Quebec History Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==First World War==
In the autumn of 1915, Major Cape of the [[2nd Field Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery]] raised and commanded 3rd [[Artillery battery|Battery]], Canadian Siege [[Artillery]] and took them to Europe. After further training in [[England]], in {{nowrap|June 1916}}, Cape accompanied the Battery to [[France]]. Cape fought in the [[Battle of the Somme]] and was wounded at the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]]. He was twice mentioned in [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]]'s [[Mentioned in Despatches|Despatches]] for distinguished service under enemy fire. He was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] In 1920, upon reorganization of the [[Canadian Militia]], [[Lieutenant-colonel (Canada)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Cape was appointed [[Commanding officer|Commanding Officer]] of the 2nd Medium Brigade, [[Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadaveteranshallofvalour.com/CapeEGM.htm Canada Veterans Hall of Valour]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Ernest Hyam Davis''' (17 February 1872 – 16 September 1962) was a New Zealand businessman, and was [[Mayor of Auckland City]] from 1935 to 1941. He was also on other Auckland local bodies (Fire Board, Hospital Board, Drainage Board) and on various philanthropic and sporting organisations. He was Mayor of [[Newmarket, New Zealand|Newmarket]] (a small inner-Auckland borough) 1909–1910.

==Early life==
He was born in Nelson, and attended Bishops School Nelson and [[Auckland Grammar School]].{{sfn|Scholefield|1951|p=60}} On 2 August 1899, he married [[Marion Mitchell]], who had made a career as an opera singer with her debut at age 14.&lt;ref name="DNZB Mitchell"&gt;{{DNZB|Downes| Peter|2m51|Marion Mitchell|1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
He was in the brewing industry; W Macarthur &amp; Co, and later became managing director of Hancock &amp; Co. In 1923 [[New Zealand Breweries]] was formed. He was a brewery baron for half a century and a master tactician against the Prohibition movement. His brother [[Eliot Davis]] was also in the brewing company.

During the 1912 [[Waihi miners' strike]] the strike leaders were imprisoned, but were released in November for securities of £1600; the bond was later found to have been put up by Davis. He was a major source of funds for the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] for half a century.{{sfn|Gustafson|1980|p=62}} He was the employer of [[Michael Joseph Savage]] for most of the period 1908–1919.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=279}} He also employed [[John A. Lee]] to manage the Palace Hotel in Rotorua from 1929 to 1931 after the latter lost his seat in Parliament.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A millionaire who from 1912 until his death was a very generous financial supporter of the Labour Party ... A ruthless businessman, benefactor of worthy causes, and with an eye for the opposite sex.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=279}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Davis told [[Warren Freer]], then the Labour candidate for {{NZ electorate link|Mount Albert}} in the  [[Mount Albert by-election, 1947|1947]] by-election that ''he was not opposed to state control of liquor outlets, but was opposed to state control of breweries'' and supported Labour (sending a substantial cheque for party campaign funds) because ''the Labour Party policy allows a worker to have a few shillings in his pocket and without that he cannot buy my beer. Conservatives tend to look after the more affluent in the country and do not care if the worker has sixpence for a beer or not''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= [[Warren Freer|Freer]] |first= Warren W |title= A Lifetime in Politics: the memoirs of Warren Freer  |accessdate=  |edition=  |origyear=  |year= 2004 |publisher= [[Victoria University Press]] |location= Wellington |isbn= 0-86473-478-6 |oclc= |page= 26 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis was the owner of the [[Grand Hotel Auckland]] from the death of his father Moss Davis in 1910 until 1962 when he died himself. He had collected a large amount of Victorian paintings, which hung in the hotel until its closure in 1966 when leased by Hancock &amp; Co. Ltd from the Ara Masonic Lodge. He was also a racehorse owner and yachtsman, and was knighted as a [[Knight Bachelor]] in 1937.

In 1935 Davis was elected [[Mayor of Auckland City|Mayor of Auckland]] with Citizens' Committee endorsement, narrowly defeating Labour's candidate [[Joe Sayegh]] by only 400 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19350509.2.116.2 |title=City Mayoralty |newspaper=[[New Zealand Herald]] |date=9 May 1935 |volume=LXXII |issue=22104 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He greatly increased his majority when re-elected in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19380518.2.8.2 |title=Election of Mayor |newspaper=[[New Zealand Herald]] |date=18 May 1938 |volume=LXXV |issue=23040 |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis was appointed a Chevalier of the [[Légion d’honneur]] by the Republic of [[France]] on 2 April 1938 for his services to the [[French Navy]] during their visits to [[Auckland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP19380705.2.164 |title=Honoured by France: Auckland Citizens |newspaper=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|Evening Post]] |date=5 July 1938 |volume=CXXVI |issue=4 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grande Chancellerie de la Legion d’Honneur Letter, CK/G2 743 F42011, dated 21 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; His award was announced by the French Foreign Minister and recognised the never-failing courtesy and entertainment of [[French Navy|French Naval]] crews during visits to [[Auckland]], most notably the cruiser ''[[French cruiser Jeanne d'Arc (1930)|Jeanne d’Arc]]'', which had visited only two months previous.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, Mark, 'New Zealand and the Legion d'honneur: The Mid-War period', The Volunteers: The Journal of the New Zealand Military Historical Society, awaiting publication.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Evolutionary economics''' is part of [[mainstream economics]]&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, D. (1998). Evolutionary economics goes mainstream: A review of the theory of learning in games. ''Journal of Evolutionary Economics, 8''(4), 423-432.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] school of [[economics|economic]] thought that is inspired by [[evolutionary biology]]. Much like [[mainstream economics]],  it stresses complex [[Interdependency|interdependencies]], [[competition]], [[Economic growth|growth]], [[structural change]], and [[resource constraint]]s but differs in the approaches which are used to analyze these phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Hodgson|Geoffrey M. Hodgson]] (1993) ''Economics and Evolution: Bringing Life Back Into Economics'', Cambridge and University of Michigan Press. [http://www.press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do?id=14010 Description] and chapter-link [https://books.google.com/books?id=IupN3JF6zSkC&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PR5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false preview].&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary economics deals with the study of processes that transform economy for firms, institutions, industries, employment, production, trade and growth within, through the actions of diverse agents from experience and interactions, using evolutionary methodology&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, E.S., 2013. Evolutionary economics: post-Schumpeterian contributions. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2012. Options for moving beyond the canonical model of regional path dependence. International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 36(1), pp.172-178. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2427.2011.01090.x/full 
&lt;/ref&gt;. Evolutionary economics analyses the unleashing of a process of technological and institutional innovation by generating and testing a diversity of ideas which discover and accumulate more survival value for the costs incurred than competing alternatives. The evidence suggests that it could be [[Adaptive market hypothesis|adaptive efficiency]] that defines economic efficiency. [[Mainstream economics|Mainstream]] economic reasoning begins with the postulates of [[scarcity]] and [[rational agent]]s (that is, agents modeled as maximizing their individual welfare), with the "[[rational choice]]" for any agent being a straightforward  [[exercise (mathematics)|exercise]] in [[mathematical optimization]]. There has been renewed interest in treating economic systems as evolutionary systems in the developing field of [[Complexity economics]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Evolutionary economics does not take the characteristics of either the objects of choice or of the decision-maker as fixed. Rather its focus is on the non-equilibrium ''processes'' that transform the economy ''from within'' and their implications&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, R.R. and Winter, S.G., 2002. Evolutionary theorizing in economics. The journal of economic perspectives, 16(2), pp.23-46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2012. Options for moving beyond the canonical model of regional path dependence. International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 36(1), pp.172-178. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2427.2011.01090.x/full 
&lt;/ref&gt;.  The processes in turn emerge from actions of diverse agents with [[bounded rationality]] who may learn from experience and interactions and whose differences contribute to the change.  The subject draws more recently on [[evolutionary game theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Friedman (1998).  "On Economic Applications of Evolutionary Game Theory," ''Journal of Evolutionary Economics'', 8(1), pp. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/p62cu1yy9tkljh5l/ 15]-43.&lt;/ref&gt; and on the [[evolution]]ary methodology of [[Charles Darwin]] and the [[non-equilibrium economics]] principle of circular and cumulative causation. It is [[Natural science|naturalistic]] in purging earlier notions of economic change as [[teleology|teleological]] or necessarily improving the human condition.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Witt (2008). "evolutionary economics." ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition, v. 3,  pp. 67-68 [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_E000295&amp;q=evolutinary%20economics&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A different approach is to apply [[evolutionary psychology]] principles to economics which is argued to explain problems such as inconsistencies and biases in [[rational choice theory]]. Basic economic concepts such as [[utility]] may be better viewed as due to preferences that maximized evolutionary [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] in the ancestral environment but not necessarily in the current one.&lt;ref name=AEP&gt;Paul H. Rubin and C. Monica Capra. The evolutionary psychology of economics. In {{Cite book | last1 = Roberts | first1 = S.

==Predecessors==
In the mid-19th century, [[Karl Marx]] presented a schema of stages of historical development, by introducing the notion that [[human nature]] was not constant and was not determinative of the nature of the social system; on the contrary, he made it a principle that human behavior was a function of the social and economic system in which it occurred.

Marx based his theory of economic development on the premise of developing [[economic system]]s; specifically, over the course of history superior economic systems would replace inferior ones. Inferior systems were beset by internal contradictions and [[Inefficiency|inefficiencies]] that make them incapable of surviving over the long term. In Marx's scheme, [[feudalism]] was replaced by [[capitalism]], which would eventually be superseded by [[socialism]].&lt;ref name="ComparingEconomicSystems"&gt;''Gregory and Stuart''. (2005) ''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'', Seventh Edition, South-Western College Publishing, {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At approximately the same time, [[Charles Darwin]] developed a general framework for comprehending any process whereby small, [[random variation]]s could accumulate and predominate over time into large-scale changes that resulted in the emergence of wholly novel forms ("[[speciation]]").

This was followed shortly after by the work of the American pragmatic philosophers ([[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]], [[William James|James]], [[John Dewey|Dewey]]) and the founding of two new disciplines, [[psychology]] and [[anthropology]], both of which were oriented toward cataloging and developing explanatory frameworks for the variety of [[behavior]] patterns (both individual and collective) that were becoming increasingly obvious to all systematic observers. The state of the world converged with the state of the evidence to make almost inevitable the development of a more "modern" framework for the analysis of substantive economic issues.

=== Veblen (1898) ===

[[Thorstein Veblen]] (1898) coined the term "evolutionary economics" in English. He began his career in the midst of this period of intellectual ferment, and as a young scholar came into direct contact with some of the leading figures of the various movements that were to shape the style and substance of [[social science]]s into the next century and beyond. Veblen saw the need for taking account of cultural variation in his approach; no universal "human nature" could possibly be invoked to explain the variety of norms and behaviors that the new science of anthropology showed to be the rule, rather than the exception. He emphasised the conflict between "industrial" and "pecuniary" or ceremonial values and this [[Veblenian dichotomy]] was interpreted in the hands of later writers as the "ceremonial / instrumental dichotomy" (Hodgson 2004);

Veblen saw that every culture is materially based and dependent on tools and skills to support the "life process", while at the same time, every culture appeared to have a stratified structure of status ("invidious distinctions") that ran entirely contrary to the imperatives of the "instrumental" (read: "technological") aspects of group life. The "ceremonial" was related to the past, and conformed to and supported the tribal legends; "instrumental" was oriented toward the technological imperative to judge value by the ability to control future consequences. The "Veblenian dichotomy" was a specialized variant of the "[[Instrumentalism|instrumental]] theory of value" due to John Dewey, with whom Veblen was to make contact briefly at the [[University of Chicago]].

Arguably the most important works by Veblen include, but are not restricted to, his most famous works (''[[The Theory of the Leisure Class]]''; ''[[The Theory of Business Enterprise]]''), but his monograph ''Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution'' and the 1898 essay entitled ''Why is Economics not an Evolutionary Science'' have both been influential in shaping the research agenda for subsequent generations of [[social scientist]]s. TOLC and TOBE together constitute an alternative construction to the neoclassical marginalist theories of consumption and production, respectively.

Both are founded on his dichotomy, which is at its core a valuational principle. The ceremonial patterns of activity are not bound to any past, but to one that generated a specific set of advantages and prejudices that underlie the current institutions. "Instrumental" judgments create benefits according to a new criterion, and therefore are inherently subversive. This line of analysis was more fully and explicitly developed by [[Clarence E. Ayres]] of the [[University of Texas at Austin]] from the 1920s.

A seminal article by [[Armen Alchian]] (1950) argued for adaptive success of firms faced with uncertainty and incomplete information replacing [[profit maximization]] as an appropriate modeling assumption.&lt;ref&gt;Armen A. Alchian 1950, "Uncertainty, Evolution and Economic Theory," ''Journal of Political Economy'', 58(3), pp. [http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/wew/syllabi/Econ811JournalArticles/AlchianJPE.pdf 211-21].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Boulding]] was one of the advocates of the evolutionary methods in social science, as is evident from [[Kenneth Boulding's Evolutionary Perspective]]. [[Kenneth Arrow]], [[Ronald Coase]] and [[Douglass North]] are some of the [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]] winners who are known for their sympathy to the field.

More narrowly the works [[Jack Downie]]&lt;ref&gt;Jack Downie (1958) The Competitive Process&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edith Penrose]]&lt;ref&gt;E. Penrose (1959) The Theory of the Growth of the Firm&lt;/ref&gt; offer many insights for those thinking about evolution at the level of the firm in an industry.

[[Joseph Schumpeter]], who lived in the first half of 20th century, was the author of the book ''The Theory of Economic Development'' (1911, transl. 1934). It is important to note that for the word ''development'' he used in his native language, the German word "Entwicklung", which can be translated as development or evolution. The translators of the day used the word "development" from the French "développement", as opposed to "evolution" as this was used by Darwin. (Schumpeter, in his later writings in English as a professor at Harvard, used the word "evolution".)  The current term in common use is [[economic development]].

In Schumpeter's book he proposed an idea radical for its time: the evolutionary perspective. He based his theory on the assumption of usual [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]], which is something like "the normal mode of economic affairs". This equilibrium is being perpetually destroyed by [[entrepreneur]]s who try to introduce [[innovation]]s. A successful introduction of an innovation (i.e. a [[disruptive technology]]) disturbs the normal flow of economic life, because it forces some of the already existing technologies and means of production to lose their positions within the economy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

== Present state of discussion ==
One of the major contributions to the emerging field of evolutionary economics has been the publication of ''An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change'' by [[Richard R. Nelson (economist)|Richard Nelson]] and [[Sidney G. Winter]]. These authors have focused mostly on the issue of changes in [[technology]] and [[Business process|routines]], suggesting a framework for their analysis. If the change occurs constantly in the economy, then some kind of evolutionary process must be in action, and there has been a proposal that this process is [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] in nature.

Then, mechanisms that provide [[Selection (biology)|selection]], generate [[Genetic variation|variation]] and establish [[self-replication]], must be identified. The authors introduced the term '[[steady change]]' to highlight the evolutionary aspect of economic processes and contrast it with the concept of '[[steady state]]' popular in [[classical economics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Steady change]]&lt;/ref&gt; Their approach can be compared and contrasted with the [[population ecology]] or [[organizational ecology]] approach in sociology: see Douma &amp; Schreuder (2013, chapter 11).

[[Milton Friedman]] proposed that [[Market (economics)|market]]s act as major selection vehicles. As [[corporation|firm]]s compete, unsuccessful rivals fail to capture an appropriate [[market share]], go [[bankrupt]] and have to exit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Mariana Mazzucato |last=Mazzucato |first=Mariana |url=http://oro.open.ac.uk/22206/ |year=2000 |title=Firm Size, Innovation and Market Structure: The Evolution of Market Concentration and Instability |journal=Advances in Complex Systems |volume=3 |pages=417–431 |publisher=Edward Elgar |location=Northampton, MA |isbn=978-1-84064-346-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variety of competing firms is both in their products and practices, that are matched against markets. Both products and practices are determined by routines that firms use: standardized patterns of actions implemented constantly. By imitating these routines, firms propagate them and thus establish inheritance of successful practices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Milton Friedman|Friedman, Milton]] (1953). ''[[Essays in Positive Economics]]'', University of Chicago Press. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rSGekjfpf4cC&amp;printsec=toc&amp;dq=friedman+essays&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 Chapter preview links.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 251: [[Jon Elster]], ''Explaining Technical Change : a Case Study in the Philosophy of Science'', Second ed.&lt;/ref&gt;
A general theory of this process has been proposed by Kurt Dopfer, John Foster and Jason Potts as the micro meso macro framework.&lt;ref&gt;Dopfer, K., Foster, J., Potts, J. (2004). Micro-meso-macro. Journal of Evolutionary Economics. 14(3), 263-279&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic processes, as part of life processes, are intrinsically evolutionary&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, R.R. and Winter, S.G., 2002. Evolutionary theorizing in economics. The journal of economic perspectives, 16(2), pp.23-46.&lt;/ref&gt;. From the evolutionary equation that describe life processes, an analytical formula on the main factors of economic processes, such as fixed cost and variable cost, can be derived. The economic return, or competitiveness, of economic entities of different characteristics under different kinds of environment can be calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Unity of Science and Economics: A New Foundation of Economic Theory|last=Chen|first=Jing|publisher=Springer|year=2016|isbn=|location=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781493934645|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change of environment causes the change of competitiveness of different economic entities and systems. This is the process of evolution of economic systems.

In recent years, evolutionary models have been used to assist decision making in applied settings and find solutions to problems such as optimal product design and service portfolio diversification.&lt;ref&gt;Baltas, G., Tsafarakis, S., Saridakis, C. &amp; Matsatsinis, N. (2013). Biologically Inspired Approaches to Strategic Service Design: Optimal Service Diversification Through Evolutionary and Swarm Intelligence Models. ''Journal of Service Research'' 16 (2), 186-201&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary psychology ==
{{See also|Behavioral economics|Neuroeconomics}}
A different approach is to apply [[evolutionary psychology]] principles to economics which is argued to explain problems such as inconsistencies and biases in [[rational choice theory]]. A basic economic concept such as [[utility]] may be better viewed as due to preferences that maximized evolutionary [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] in the ancestral environment but not necessarily in the current one. [[Loss aversion]] may be explained as being rational when living at subsistence level where a reduction of resources may have meant death and it thus may have been rational to place a greater value on losses than on gains.&lt;ref name="AEP"/&gt;

People are sometimes more cooperative and altruistic than predicted by economic theory which may be explained by mechanisms such as [[reciprocal altruism]] and [[group selection]] for cooperative behavior. An evolutionary approach may also explain differences between groups such as males being less risk-averse than females since males have more variable [[reproductive success]] than females. While unsuccessful risk-seeking may limit reproductive success for both sexes, males may potentially increase their reproductive success much more than females from successful risk-seeking. [[Frequency-dependent selection]] may explain why people differ in characteristics such as cooperative behavior with cheating becoming an increasingly less successful strategy as the numbers of cheaters increase.&lt;ref name="AEP"/&gt;

Another argument is that humans have a poor intuitive grasp of the economics of the current environment which is very different from the ancestral environment. The ancestral environment likely had relatively little [[trade]], [[division of labor]], and [[capital good]]s. Technological change was very slow, wealth differences were much smaller, and possession of many available resources were likely [[zero-sum]] games where large inequalities were caused by various forms of exploitation. Humans therefore may have poor intuitive understanding the benefits of [[free trade]] (causing calls for [[protectionism]]), the value of capital goods (making the [[labor theory of value]] appealing), and may intuitively undervalue the benefits of technological development.&lt;ref name="AEP"/&gt;

There may be a tendency to see the number of available jobs as a zero-sum game with the total number of jobs being fixed which causes people to not realize that [[minimum wage]] laws reduce the number of jobs or to believe that an increased number of jobs in other nations necessarily decreases the number of jobs in their own nation. Large [[income inequality]] may easily be viewed as due to exploitation rather than as due to individual differences in [[productivity]]. This may easily cause poor economic policies, especially since individual voters have few incentives to make the effort of studying societal economics instead of relying on their intuitions since an individual's vote counts for so little and since politicians may be reluctant to take a stand against intuitive views that are incorrect but widely held.&lt;ref name=AEP/&gt;

'''George John Scipio Africanus''' (c. 1763 – 19 May 1834) was a West African former [[slavery|slave]] who became a successful entrepreneur in [[Nottingham]].

==Early years==
The early life of George Africanus is obscure. Calculating his birth year from his burial certificate, he was probably born in 1763. His obituary in the ''[[Nottingham Review]]'' of 30 May 1834&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Deaths |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002131/18340530/036/0003 |newspaper=Nottingham Journal |location=England |date=30 May 1834 |access-date=12 March 2018 |via=British Newspaper Archive |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; states that he was born in a village in [[Sierra Leone]], which became a British colony in 1787.

It is believed that George arrived in England in early 1766. On 31 March 1766, he was [[baptise]]d George John Scipio Africanus, and described as a negro boy belonging to Benjamin Molineux of [[Molineux Hotel|Molineux House]], in the Collegiate church of St Peter in [[Wolverhampton]].

When George was three years old Molineux began educating him. After Benjamin Molineux's death in 1772, his eldest son, George Molineux, inherited the estate and took responsibility for raising and educating the child. Growing up, Africanus probably worked as a servant in the Molineux family household, before becoming [[apprenticed]] to be a [[Brass foundry|brass founder]].

As an adult, Africanus moved to Nottingham, a place familiar to his adopted family. Benjamin Molineux's grandfather, Darcy Molineux (1652–1716), served as [[High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire]] in 1687, and Deputy Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire between 1698–1702. Darcy Molineux raised George Molineux's father John (1685–1754) in [[Mansfield]], Nottinghamshire, before settling in Wolverhampton around 1700. The family Molineux came from [[Teversal]] near Mansfield in the county of Nottinghamshire.
 
Africanus may have become interested in Nottingham after visiting on the way home from the funeral. A relative in his adopted family, [[Molyneux Baronets|Sir William Molineux, 6th Baronet of Teversall]], died near Mansfield in 1781. Members of the Wolverhampton Molineux family, including Africanus, may have passed through Nottingham town centre, a town of 18,000 people then, full of beautiful open-air gardens and pleasing surroundings.

==Starting a business==

Africanus moved to St Peter's Parish, Nottingham, at the age of 21 around 1784. He met a local girl, Esther (sometimes spelled Ester) Shaw, and they were married on 3 August 1788 at [[St. Peter's Church, Nottingham]]. Around 1793, they started up an employment agency, Africanus' Register of Servants,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackentrepreneurprofile.com/profile-full/archive/2004/september/article/george-john-scipio-africanus/ Errol I. Mars, "George John Scipio Africanus", BlackEntrepreneurProfile,com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222205348/http://www.blackentrepreneurprofile.com/profile-full/archive/2004/september/article/george-john-scipio-africanus/ |date=22 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; operating from their home at 28 Chandlers Lane. If the business was not bringing in sufficient income, Africanus may have performed other jobs for support; while their 1788 marriage bond document states that he was a Brass Founder by trade, trade directories of the time list him as a waiter and labourer as well. Following his death in 1834, his wife Esther remained in the house and continued to run the family business.

After she died on 12 May 1853, a notice appeared in the ''Nottingham Review'', stating: "Yesterday (Thursday), aged 85 years, Mrs. Africanus, for upwards of sixty years proprietor of the Servants' Register Office in Chandlers Lane." If this account is correct, then Ester ran the Servants' Register Office on Chandler’s lane from at least 1793. Africanus bought 28 Chandlers Lane and adjoining properties in Bluchers Yard for £380 on 24 October 1829.

==Family life==

Africanus and his wife had seven children, but only one lived to adulthood. While no descendants carry the Africanus family surname, his bloodline continued for some time. Daughter Hannah married Samuel Cropper (1802–1886/7), a watch and clock maker, at [[St. Mary's Church, Nottingham]], in 1825. They had three children: Sarah Ann Cropper (1825–1842), George Africanus Cropper (1838–1839) and Esther Africanus Cropper (1840–1911).

Granddaughter Esther married Charles Edward Turnbull at [[St. Mary's Church, Nottingham]], on 28 September 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Marriages |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000176/18651006/029/0008 |newspaper=Nottinghamshire Guardian |location=England |date=6 October 1865 |access-date=12 March 2018 |via=British Newspaper Archive |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; They lived at 9 St. Paul's Crescent, [[St. Pancras, London]]. Esther died at the age of 69 in [[Kingston, Surrey]]. The 1881 census indicates that she had three children: Arthur (aged 14), Fredrick (13), and Margaret Hannah (9).

According to the Last Will and Testament of George Africanus,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nottinghamshire.gov.uk/home/leisure/archives/documentofthemonth/july06.htm Will of George Africanus of Nottingham, 1833, Nottinghamshire County Council website, Document of the month, July 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt; he was unhappy with Hannah's marriage to Samuel Cropper. Hannah and Samuel Cropper lived apart for years until after the death of George Africanus. The 1841 census shows Hannah and Samuel Cropper living on Chandlers Lane with her 70-year-old mother, Esther, who was still working as proprietress of the register of servants office at the time.

Africanus's will also indicates that granddaughter, Sarah Ann Cropper, was "afflicted" in some unstated way; she died at the age of 17, so may have had a serious illness.

==Burial place and legacy==

[[Image:GeorgeAfricanus1.JPG|thumb|200px|Epitaph in [[St. Mary's Church, Nottingham]]]]
[[Len Garrison]], director of Afro-Caribbean Family and Friends (AcFF), ensured that Africanus was included in [[Nottingham Castle]]'s 1993 Black Presence exhibition. It was only in 2003 that, after painstaking research, Africanus's grave was uncovered, despite its worn inscription, in the churchyard of [[St. Mary's Church, Nottingham]]. His wife was buried alongside him. Their children are buried in a separate grave nearby.

A gravestone bearing an epitaph now reads:

''In Memory of George Africanus''&lt;br&gt;
''Who died 19 May 1834''&lt;br&gt;
''Aged 70 years''&lt;br&gt;
''Also Ester Africanus, wife of the above''&lt;br&gt;
''Who died 12 May 1853?''&lt;br&gt;
''Aged 81 years''

''Oh cruel death that separated here''&lt;br&gt;
''A loving father from his daughter dear''&lt;br&gt;
''Also a tender parent in decline of life''&lt;br&gt;
''A loving mother and a careful wife''&lt;br&gt;
''While in this world they did remain''&lt;br&gt;
''Their latter Days were full of pain''
[[Image:GeorgeAfricanus2.JPG|thumb|200px]]

A memorial plaque in memory of Africanus, "Nottingham's first black entrepreneur", was unveiled on St Mary's churchyard railings in April 2003.

On 25 March 2007, as part of the events taking place to commemorate the 200th Anniversary of Abolition of Slave Trade Act, an hour-long service was held at St Mary's Church, High Pavement, Nottingham, at the end of which  a new memorial stone was dedicated by religious leaders.  The Bishop of Kingston (Jamaica), the Rt Revd Robert Thompson, Preached at the service. In the same month, an exhibition was held at Nottingham Council House celebrating the life of Africanus, displaying documents and illustrations connected with his life in Wolverhampton and Nottingham.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/content/articles/2007/02/22/abolition_of_slavery_nottingham_listings_feature.shtml BBC, Nottingham, Abolition events.

The '''Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes''', founded in 2000 and restructured in September 2009, consists of [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries and other jurisdictions that agreed to implement tax related transparency and information exchange.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt; It addresses [[tax evasion]], [[tax haven]]s, [[offshore financial centre]]s, [[tax information exchange agreements]], [[double taxation]] and [[money laundering]]. The forum works under the auspices of the OECD and [[G-20 major economies|G20]]. In 2000 it published a blacklist of 35 [[tax haven]]s, which by 2009 had shrunk to zero. It has since focused on increasing the standard for information exchange. As of January 2018, the Forum had 147 member tax jurisdictions and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name=GF_members&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/transparency/about-the-global-forum/members/ |title=Global Forum Members |publisher=Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information on Tax Purposes |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The Forum promotes the implementation of two internationally agreed standards on exchange of information for tax purposes. Members must commit to at least implement the Exchange of Information on Request (EOIR) standard,&lt;ref name=eoir&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/transparency/exchange-of-information-on-request/ |title=Exchange of Information on Request |publisher=OECD Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes |date=n.d. |accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the lowest common denominator for information exchange, which is a weaker standard than Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) standard.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

It uses [[peer review]] to monitor that exchange information on request is implemented. As a prerequisite, countries have to pass relevant laws, which are then to be reviewed (Phase 1). Thereafter in Phase 2, the degree of implementation is graded into four categories from A to D.&lt;ref name=eoir/&gt; Since 2009 it has classified tax havens into a "blacklist" of non-committers and a "graylist" (or "greylist") of non-implementers of the request-based "internationally agreed tax standard". The terms blacklist and graylist are not used by the Forum but by news services like Reuters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-g20-havens-list-sb-idustre53177t20090402 | title=Four countries on OECD tax haven blacklist | work=Reuters | date=2 April 2009 | accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the BBC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7980848.stm |title=OECD names and shames tax havens |publisher=BBC |date=3 April 2009 |accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Congressional Research Service]].&lt;ref name="cro"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40623.pdf |title=Tax Havens: International Tax Avoidance and Evasion |work=Congressional Research Service |date=15 January 2015 |accessdate=7 May 2016 |author=Jane G. Gravelle |pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}

===Budget===
The 2009 estimate of a budget was 2.9 million. It was raised by a flat fee of 15000 euros for each of the members plus a fee based on the overall GNP with an abatement of 450 USD/inhabitant.&lt;ref name="Mexico2009"/&gt;

==History==

===Precursors===
In April 1998 an OECD report acknowledged that tax havens erode the tax base of other countries and undermine the fairness of tax systems, diminishing global welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Harmful Tax Competition: An Emerging Global Issue|date=1998|url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/transparency/44430243.pdf|pages=82|publisher=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt; It noted that tax havens were expanding at an exponential rate. The report focused on tax havens in the Caribbean who were not OECD members, and the OECD was thus criticized for not addressing tax havens who were its members. A second report in 2000 included a blacklist of 35 secrecy jurisdictions - all outside the OECD - and a threat of defensive measures against them, with backing from the United States under the Clinton administration.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Creation (2000) and first years===
In 2000, the Global Forum was created with 32 members. Efforts to move against tax evasion in tax havens were quickly "bogged down in arcane haggling", including by a working group between tax havens and the OECD set up at the suggestion of the Commonwealth. In the United States, the [[Heritage Foundation]] criticized the move as a European effort to limit competition among tax jurisdictions. The new U.S. administration of George Bush and his first treasury secretary Paul O'Neill stated in May 2001 that the OECD's efforts were "not in line with the administration's priorities". The OECD gave in and announced it had no intention to pursue "defensive measures" against tax havens.&lt;ref name="Shaxson"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Shaxson| first1=Nicholas| title=Treasure Islands - Uncovering the Damage of Offshore Banking and Tax Havens| date=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-34172-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|149–150, 160–162}}

After the [[September 11, 2001, attacks]] the United States wanted better cooperation from tax havens on terrorist financing, but was reluctant to tackle tax evasion forcefully. Since the two practices are very similar, the United States only asked the OECD to require tax havens to provide information on request under very narrow conditions, which became the OECD's model for information on tax exchange. As a result, for example [[Jersey]], an important tax haven, provided information to the United States in only five or six cases over a period of seven years.&lt;ref name="Shaxson"/&gt;{{rp|167–168}}

===Stepping-up of efforts after the financial crisis of 2007-08===
[[File:2009 G-20 London Summit - 4342568178.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Leaders of the G-20 countries at the London Summit in 2009]]
The activities against tax havens were only expanded after the [[financial crisis of 2007-08]]. At the April [[2009 G-20 London summit]] tax havens were divided into a "blacklist" of non-committers and  a "graylist" of non-implementers, based on compliance with the request-based "internationally agreed tax standard".&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news |last1= Watt|first1= Nicholas |last2= Elliott|first2 =Larry|last3= Borger|first3= Julian|last4= Black|first4= Ian |url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/02/g20-summit-tax-havens |title = G20 declares door shut on tax havens|work = The Guardian|date = April 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual list included three categories:

#40 countries and territories substantially implemented the standard
#38 countries and territories committed to but had not yet substantially implemented the standard 
# 4 countries  had not committed to the standard.

The list of non-implementers initially included, among others, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland. The list of non-committed included Costa Rica, Malaysia, the Philippines and Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/ctp/42497950.pdf |title=A Progress Report on The Jurisdictions Surveyed by The OECD Global Forum in Implementing The Internationally Agreed Tax Standard|date = 2 April 2009 |format=PDF |accessdate=|publisher = OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within five days Costa Rica, Malaysia, the Philippines and Uruguay made "a full commitment to exchange information to the OECD standards" and were removed from the "blacklist" which was thus empty.&lt;ref name="bbc2009-04-07"&gt;{{cite news |title=OECD removes tax havens from list |author=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7987417.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-04-07 |accessdate=2009-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Panama was ‘white listed’ because it signed a tax information exchange agreement (TIEA) with France.
The British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands were white listed by August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tax-oecd-idUSTRE57D20O20090814 | title=British Virgin Islands, Cayman on tax "white list" | publisher=Reuters | date=14 August 2009 | accessdate=8 May 2016 | author=Crispian Balmer}}&lt;/ref&gt;
No G-20 country was on the greylist of non-implementers, prompting Luxembourg Prime Minister [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] to criticise it for failing to include various states of the USA which provide incorporation infrastructure indistinguishable from the tax havens on the G-20 blacklist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Welcome to tax-dodge city, USA |publisher=The Guardian |date=2009-04-10|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/apr/10/tax-havens-blacklist-us-delaware |accessdate=2009-04-14 | location=London | first=Andrew | last=Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Der Spiegel called the list "The World's Shortest Blacklist" and "the Fight against Tax Havens Is a Sham".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/the-world-s-shortest-blacklist-why-the-fight-against-tax-havens-is-a-sham-a-618780.html | title=The World's Shortest Blacklist: Why the Fight against Tax Havens Is a Sham | work=Der Spiegel | date=11 April 2009 | accessdate=7 May 2016 | author=Alexander Neubacher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a meeting in Mexico in September 2009, the Global Forum was restructured and received its own Secretariat. The main decisions were:
*Agree on restructuring the OECD Global Forum to expand its membership and ensure its members participate on an equal footing;
*Agree on how to establish an in-depth peer review process to monitor and review progress made towards full and effective exchange of information; and
*Identify mechanisms to speed-up the negotiation and conclusion of agreements to exchange information and to enable developing countries to benefit from the new more cooperative tax environment.&lt;ref name="Mexico2009"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oecd.org/ctp/exchange-of-tax-information/43610626.pdf |title= Summary of Outcomes of the Meeting of the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes Held in Mexico on 1 - 2 September 2009| publisher=The Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes | accessdate=19 August 2014|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion of exchange of information===
In March 2010, international efforts were stepped up when the U.S. Congress passed the [[Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act]] (FATCA) which forces foreign financial firms to disclose their American clients.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Also in 2010, the 1988 [[Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters]] was amended to include automated exchange of tax information, a key instrument in fighting tax evasion, and expanding it to developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oecd.org/ctp/exchange-of-tax-information/conventiononmutualadministrativeassistanceintaxmatters.htm | title=Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters | publisher=OECD | date=n.d. | accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a working group was formed to promote the automated exchange of tax information.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

In July 2014, the Forum published standards for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/exchange-of-tax-information/standard-for-automatic-exchange-of-financial-account-information-for-tax-matters-9789264216525-en.htm | title=Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters | publisher=OECD | date=21 July 2014 | accessdate=7 May 2016 | doi=10.1787/9789264216525-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 2015, more than 90 members have committed to go beyond Exchange of Information on Request and to implement Automatic Exchange of Information.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} An international framework agreement, the Common Reporting Standard Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (CRS MCAA), specifies the details of what information will be exchanged and when. As of October 2015, it has been signed by 74 jurisdictions. Since the agreement is a framework agreement, it only comes into effect for each signatory after it has confirmed that it has undertaken certain steps such as passing national legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA)|url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/international-framework-for-the-crs/|publisher=GFTEITP|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Forum, "Work is currently underway to implement this Standard, with the first exchanges occurring on a very ambitious timeline of 2017 and 2018".&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/transparency/about-the-global-forum/ | title=About the Global Forum | publisher=GFTEITP | date=n.d. | accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compliance by country==
The forum reviews compliance of its member tax jurisdictions separately for the two standards, the more limited exchange of information on request and the more comprehensive automated exchange of information.

More than 80 countries and territories were not (yet) members of the Global Forum as of November 2015 and are thus not included in the lists below. Notable non-members include Belarus and Serbia in Europe; Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela in Latin America; Egypt, Ethiopia, Algeria and many smaller countries in Africa; as well as Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Thailand and Vietnam in Asia. All important tax havens, however, are members of the Global Forum - the 30 countries topping the [[Financial Secrecy Index]] in 2013 were all members as of 2015.

===Exchange of Information on Request===
The Global Forum's peer review process examines both the legal and regulatory aspects of exchange (Phase 1 reviews) and the exchange of information in practice (Phase 2). The peer reviews cover only the limited exchange of information on request.

====2013 Ratings====
At its meeting in [[Jakarta]] in November 2013, the Global Forum assigned the ratings for the
first 50 jurisdictions that had completed their Phase 1 and Phase 2 reviews. The Phase 1 review found that 14 countries and territories had gaps in their legal framework and were not allowed to move to Phase 2 unless they improved their legal framework.&lt;ref name="2013 report"/&gt;

The ten countries and territories that were at the top of the [[Financial Secrecy Index]] 2013, an index established by the NGO [[Tax Justice Network]] and that also takes into account the size of the transactions in a tax haven, were categorized as follows: Lebanons and Switzerland had not completed Phase 1. Luxembourg was listed as Category D, Jersey as Category C, and the Cayman Islands, Germany, Hong Kong, Singapore as well as the United States were listed as Category B. Japan was the only country classified as one of the ten major tax havens by the Tax Justice Network that was listed in Category A.

The following jurisdictions are not eligible to move to Phase 2 review until they act on recommendations to improve their legal and regulatory framework:

Among those countries that had created an adequate legal framework and thus had moved to Phase 2, four countries - including Luxembourg - were found to be non-compliant with their own legal framework (grade D). Two countries - Austria and Turkey - were only partially compliant (grade C).&lt;ref name="2013 report"&gt;Global Forum:[http://www.oecd.org/tax/transparency/draft%20annual%20report%202013%20%20for%20GF.pdf 2013 Annual Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126113320/http://www.oecd.org/tax/transparency/draft%20annual%20report%202013%20%20for%20GF.pdf |date=2013-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2015 Ratings====
As of October 31, 2015 the ratings were as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary of Compliance Ratings|url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/transparency/|publisher=GFTEITP|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 8 countries still had deficiencies in their legal framework. 25 countries, including Switzerland, had completed their legal framework (Phase 1 review), but had not yet had a Phase 2 review. Among the countries and territories that had passed a Phase 2 review, none was rated non-compliant (Grade D) any more. Nine countries were rated as only partially compliant (Grade C), still including Austria and Turkey.

The ten countries and territories that were at the top of the [[Financial Secrecy Index]] 2015, an index established by the NGO [[Tax Justice Network]] and that also takes into account the size of the transactions in a tax haven, were categorized as follows: Lebanon had not completed Phase 1. Switzerland and the UAE had completed Phase 1 and were awaiting Phase 2. Luxembourg and Jersey had moved up to Category B, along with the Cayman Islands, Germany, Hong Kong, Singapore as well as the United States. Bahrain, which had not been among the top ten tax havens in 2013, was also in Category B. Japan and Jersey had improved their transparency and were not any more among the ten most important tax havens, moving to number 12 and 16 respectively.

The following jurisdictions are not eligible to move to Phase 2 review until they act on recommendations to improve their legal and regulatory framework:

===Automated Exchange of Information===
As of March 2015, more than 90 countries have committed in principle to the automated exchange of tax information.&lt;ref name=AEP/&gt; 
More specifically, the first undertaking first exchanges by 2017 will be: Anguilla, Argentina, Barbados, Belgium, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Bulgaria, Cayman Islands,

As of November 2015, 41 countries have submitted specific commitments to implement legislation and other measures related to the automated exchange of tax information. No single tax haven has made specific commitments to the automated exchange of information so far. The following countries have passed [[primary legislation]] related to the automated exchange of tax information:&lt;ref name=AEP/&gt;

'''''Good Profit: How Creating Value for Others Built One of the World's Most Successful Companies''''' is a 2015 book by [[Charles G. Koch]]. It was published in the [[United States]] by Crown Business, an imprint of the [[Crown Publishing Group]], a division of Penguin Random House LLC. It was published in the [[United Kingdom]] by [[Little, Brown Book Group#Piatkus|Piatkus]].

It is a follow-up to a 2007 book by Koch called ''[[The Science of Success]]''.

==Book summary==
In the book, Koch explains the business strategy behind the remarkable success of his family-owned firm, Koch Industries, which is the second largest privately owned company in the United States. Koch is the firm's co-owner, CEO, and chairman of the board.

{{Main article| Koch Industries}}

This strategy, or “management framework,” is called “Market-Based Management,” or “MBM.” Koch says that his book is meant for all business readers who desire to move beyond “anecdotes, buzzwords, and laundry lists” to apply MBM methods to generate profit for themselves, their business, and to improve society as a whole.

In explaining MBM, Koch writes that it involves analyzing “business through a win-win mind-set.” This strategy, he maintains, has enabled the firm to deal with dramatic geopolitical, economic, and technological changes, and at the same time to earn what he describes as “good profits.” By this, he means profits that result from treating customers with respect and placing their values first. By contrast, “bad profit” involves “disrespecting customers by making them subsidize our business with their tax dollars and higher prices, siphoning away the good profit other companies could have earned.”

The book argues, then, for a free market, liberated from the distortions of [[corporate welfare]]. Koch calls for the elimination of government “distortions,” such as [[ethanol]] mandates and import [[tariff]]s. Although Koch Industries profits “short term from these market distortions,” states Koch, they “don't lead to good profit” and thus “leave virtually everyone worse off long term, including us.”

Koch explains that he has willingly shared MBM principles with other firms and organizations, since he is confident that the success of others will not diminish his own. “On the contrary, MBM is win-win” Koch has stated, revealing his view that there are no zero-sum scenarios.

==Dimensions of Market-Based Management==

===Vision===
Koch underscores that in order to achieve long-term success a business cannot rely on short-term profits but must accept the necessity of what economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] calls “creative destruction.” This means that a firm must innovate at least as quickly as its most effective competitor. Koch also cites [[Adam Smith]]'s maxim that “Consumption is the sole end and purpose of production; and the interests of the producer ought to be attended to only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer.” Building on these insights, Koch explains that at the heart of MBM is the understanding that the role of business “is to help people improve their lives by providing products and services they value more highly than their alternatives, and to do so while consuming fewer resources.”

===Virtue and Talents===
Koch explains that the most important attribute his firm looks for in potential employees is “good character and compatible values.” The company has a list of ten “Guiding Principles,” which include integrity, compliance, value creation, humility, and respect. Koch elaborates at length on each of the characteristics he seeks out in job applicants, and outlines the process by which his firm seeks to develop good hires into optimal employees. He offers many observations that might surprise some readers, noting, for example, that while some firms favor Ivy League graduates, “Koch has enjoyed much better results hiring from Wichita State or Kansas State than from Harvard.”

===Knowledge Processes===
Koch discusses what he calls “disruptive innovation,” which involves “creating, acquiring, sharing, and applying knowledge.” It is important, he underlines, for a business to be informed immediately about developments occurring all around the world, and to adjust its operations accordingly. He reflects on the advantages and disadvantages of hiring consultants, discusses how to convert information into results, and expands on the insight that “Knowing why something is profitable is often as valuable as knowing what is profitable.” He also discusses such procedures as “benchmarking,” which involves “identifying, understanding, and adopting superior practices from anywhere in the world.”

===Decision Rights===
The fourth dimension of MBM is “decision rights,” which, Koch explains, “should reflect an employee's demonstrated comparative advantages.” For example, a top salesperson's time should be devoted time to making sales, while analysis of those sales should be left to a technically qualified sales analyst. Such a division of labor, explains Koch, leads to greater value creation. The bestowal of decision rights upon an individual, moreover, should not be predicated upon that individual's position in the corporate hierarchy. Some decisions, Koch further observes, need to be centralized, while a change in circumstances can make it necessary to transfer decision rights from one person, department, or level to another. Koch also outlines his firm's “Decision Making Framework,” an eight-step procedure that stresses the importance of using “no more steps or complexity than is necessary to make a sound decision.”

===Incentives===
“MBM,” writes Koch, “eschews limits on what employees can earn.” Providing incentives is important, although he distinguishes between “beneficial incentives and perverse incentives.” The former are incentives that “reward creating the most value in society,” while the latter “motivate employees to do the wrong things.” Beneficial incentives are characteristic of prosperous societies; perverse incentives are found in societies, including Communist societies that suffer from poverty, waste, and corruption.

===Case studies and conclusion===
Toward the end of his book, Koch recounts four case studies in MBM from the corporate history of Koch Industries, specifying the ways in which the five dimensions of MBM came into play in each instance. In his conclusion, he stresses the importance of grasping MBM as a “holistic” strategy and lists several mistakes to avoid when implementing MBM.

==Critical responses==
In his review of ''Good Profit'' for the ''Financial Times'', Ed Crooks described it as “invaluable as a window on the thinking of a hugely important US figure who is uneasy in the public eye.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
| title =Review: ‘Good Profit’ by Charles Koch
| publisher =Financial Times
| url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4b2c7236-71be-11e5-ad6d-f4ed76f0900a.html#axzz3pa36uerb
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the book in the ''Wall Street Journal'', Joseph Maciariello, professor emeritus of social science and management at [[Claremont Graduate University]], wrote: “C. William Pollard, chief executive emeritus of [[ServiceMaster]], has posed the question: 'Can the business firm make money, create wealth, and also be a moral community for the development of human character and social concern?' In ''Good Profit'', Mr. Koch not only makes a strong argument in the affirmative but also provides a systematic framework—aimed at honing the vision and talent of executives and employees—for how it can be done.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

| publisher =WSJ
| url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-company-he-keeps-1445555620
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

F.H. Buckley, writing in the ''American Spectator'', suggested that ''Good Profit'' was “written for two different kinds of readers”: ambitious entrepreneurs and those who are curious “to know how a company that forswears crony capitalism can thrive, as Koch Industries did.” Koch, explained Buckley, believes in “a system of government and of laws that permits people to flourish – a system that clearly defines and protects property rights, that enforces bargains, and that allows people to speak freely.” Noting that this view has put Koch “at odds with the progressive Left,” Buckley concluded: “We’ve had countless novels and plays about how wealth is built on crime, about the evils of capitalism, from people like [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] and [[Arthur Miller]], people who had not the faintest idea about success in business or in life. How refreshing it is to get the real story!” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

| publisher =The Spectator
| url =http://spectator.org/articles/64421/charles-koch%E2%80%99s-human-flourishing-project
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review of ''Good Profit'' for ''National Review'', William Bennett, noting the left's attacks on the Koch brothers, argued that Charles Koch “should be applauded, not vilified,” for he “aims to revive our belief in entrepreneurship, labor, the joys of work, and the ability of a free people to prosper, innovate, and create value for themselves and others.” Bennett pointed out that “Koch’s philosophy is not to maximize short-term profit, but rather to create and sustain value for his customers over time and to do so in an ethical manner.” ''Good Profit'', stated Bennett, “is as much a course in ethics as one in business management, and Koch is a business icon with the soul and inclination of a philosopher” – an icon, moreover, who offers “the uplifting vision of entrepreneurship and work that America needs right now.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

| publisher =National Review
| url =http://www.nationalreview.com/article/425596/charles-koch-how-good-profit-benefits-everyone-william-bennett
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Good Profit'' has been praised by [[John Mackey (businessman)|John Mackey]], Co-Founder and Co-CEO of [[Whole Foods Market]], who said that it “helps show you the way to good profit – whether you work for an international supermarket chain, a medium-sized regional business, or your own start-up.” General [[Richard B. Myers]], former Chairman of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], called it “The ultimate 'how to' book on running a successful business.... A must read for those who want to take their enterprise to the next level.” [[John Schnatter]], CEO of [[Papa John's Pizza]], called Koch “a genuine patriot” whose “lifelong mission is to make America as strong and free as she can be” and who “believes the principles of economic opportunity that have guided America are worth protecting.” [[Charles R. Schwab]] described the book as “a clear example of the American dream and how our country benefits when successful entrepreneurs create new jobs (and more taxes for government services) while providing the golden egg for philanthropic efforts.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5708">'''Fondation Guilé''' is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] foundation. This non-profit organization of Swiss private law has been founded in 1997 by the Charles [[:fr:Famille Burrus|Burrus family]] headquartered in [[Boncourt, Switzerland]].  The foundation’s mission is to promote corporate responsibility in the process of globalization, focusing on human and labour rights, environmental protection and business ethics. The foundation supports and promotes the ten principles of the [[United Nations Global Compact]] through the engagement with companies about their sustainability and corporate responsibility efforts and by organizing high-level events on the topic. The foundation defines its role as “catalyst in helping companies implement and report on the ten principles of the Global Compact” according to the founders Nado and Charles Burrus.

== Company assessments and engagement ==
Fondation Guilé has initiated two investment funds to promote its goals.  The Guilé European Engagement Fund (GEEF) was set up in 2006 and is independently managed by de Pury Pictet Turrettini in Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
  |url=http://www.ppt.ch/en/sustainable-finance/guile.html
  |title=Guilé European Engagement Fund
  |publisher=Pury Pictet Turrettini
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fund is made up of approximately 45 European companies.

The Guilé Emerging Markets Engagement Fund (GEMEF) was set up in 2009 and is managed by Comgest in Paris, France. This fund contains roughly 45 companies. De Pury Pictet Turrettini and Comgest are both signatories of the [[Principles for Responsible Investment|United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment]] initiative.

The sustainability experts at Fondation Guilé analyse and benchmark the annual Communication on Progress (COP) and/or the sustainability reporting of all portfolio companies. The assessments focus on the four topical areas of the UNGC - human rights, labour standards, the environment and anti-corruption - and are based on publicly available information only. The assessments are aimed at determining strengths and areas for improvement to help each company further improve its commitment.&lt;ref&gt;

  |date=March 2009
|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The portfolio companies receive the assessment results and a detailed presentation of the findings. The assessment and benchmark is offered to each portfolio company free of charge. The costs are borne by the investors through the fund’s management fee.

== High-level meetings ==
Since 2008, Fondation Guilé has organized and co-hosted a series of private events on the UNGC during the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in [[Davos]], Switzerland. These meetings bring together high-level representatives of companies, investors, academia, governments as well as the United Nations and aim at strengthening the UNGC and enhancing its impact. In 2011, the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, the Global Compact Office, KPMG and Novo Nordisk co-hosted an event which focused on the UNGC's "Blueprint for Corporate Sustainability Leadership". UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-Moon]] was the special guest.

Other speakers at the 2011 event included Timothy P. Flynn, Chairman of [[KPMG|KPMG International]]; Kris Gopalakrishman, CEO and Managing Director of [[Infosys Technologies]]; Lise Kingo, Executive Vice President &amp; Chief of Staff of [[Novo Nordisk]]; Ditlev Engel, CEO of [[Vestas]]; Régis Burrus, Vice Chairman of Fondation Guilé; Robert Greenhill, Managing Director of the [[World Economic Forum]]; Ambassador Martin Dahinden, Director General of the [[Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation]]; John Weeks, [[International Institute for Management Development|IMD]] Professor of Leadership and Organizational Change; Peter Maurer, Secretary of State of the Swiss Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and Georg Kell, Executive Director of the Global Compact.&lt;ref&gt;

During the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2012, Fondation Guilé co-hosted the UN Global Compact LEAD Luncheon. The goal of the meeting was to review the LEAD initiative as well as to discuss priorities for the Rio+20 process. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Heads of UN Agencies, Funds and Programmes, LEAD Chief Executives and high-level representatives from PRI and PRME were among the participants of the event.

== Additional services ==
Fondation Guilé also served in an advisory capacity to the UNGC Office for the development and drafting of the Blueprint for Corporate Sustainability Leadership.

'''Key person insurance''', also commonly called '''keyman insurance''' and '''key man insurance''' or 'key employee insurance', is an important form of [[business insurance]]. There is no legal definition of "key person insurance". In general, it can be described as an [[insurance policy]] taken out by a business to compensate that business for financial losses that would arise from the death or extended incapacity of an important member of the business. To put it simply, key person insurance is a standard life insurance or trauma insurance policy that is used for business succession or business protection purposes. The policy's term does not extend beyond the period of the key person’s usefulness to the business. Key person policies are usually owned by the business and the aim is to compensate the business for losses incurred with the loss of a key income generator and facilitate business continuity.  Key person insurance does not [[Indemnity|indemnify]] the actual losses incurred but compensates with a fixed monetary sum as specified in the insurance policy.&lt;ref name="ind"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/money/insurance/how-would-your-business-cope-if-a-key-person-fell-ill-1870065.html|title=How would your business cope if a key person fell ill?|date=17 January 2010|publisher=[[The Independent]]|language=English|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many businesses have a key person who is responsible for the majority of profits or has a unique and hard to replace skill set such as Intellectual Property that is vital to the organisation. An employer may take out a key person insurance policy on the life or health of any employee whose knowledge, work, or overall contribution is considered uniquely valuable to the company.  The employer does this to offset the costs (such as hiring temporary help or recruiting a successor) and losses (such as a decreased ability to transact business until successors are trained) which the employer is likely to suffer in the event of the loss of a key person.&lt;ref name="jstor"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nicholson, Jack E. &amp; Corbett|first=Richard B.|date=January 1987|title=Key Man Insurance and Market Reaction: A Comment|journal=The Journal of Insurance Issues and Practices|publisher=Western Risk and Insurance Association|volume=10|issue=1|pages=53–61|jstor=41943220|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insurable losses==
There are four categories of loss for which key person insurance can provide compensation:

#Losses related to the extended period when a key person is unable to work, to provide temporary personnel and, if necessary to finance the recruitment and training of a replacement.
#Insurance to protect profits. For example, offsetting lost income from lost sales, losses resulting from the delay or cancellation of any business project that the key person was involved in, loss of opportunity to expand, loss of specialised skills or knowledge.
#Insurance to protect [[shareholders]] or [[partnership]] interests. Typically this is insurance to enable shareholdings or partnership interests to be purchased by existing shareholders or partners.
#Insurance for anyone involved in guaranteeing business loans or banking facilities. The value of insurance coverage is arranged to equal the value of the guarantee.

==Key person definition==
Key people are individuals whose skills, knowledge, experience or leadership are important to a business’ continued financial success. Should something happen to one of these individuals it is likely that their loss will have a detrimental impact on the profitability of the business and will cause financial strain. Examples of a key individual include, but are not limited to: company directors, sales directors, IT specialist, managing directors and heads of product development.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Worth attribution==
{{expand section|date=June 2017}}
Deciding on the sum of money to ensure the key person is dependent on the company and the reason for insuring that individual. It can be to cover a loan or investment amount, or it can be dependent on working out the worth of the person to the company. It is recommended that you think about potential loss of profits, the cost of replacement and any debts that would need to be covered to keep the company running without that person.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Loss of profits can be caused as a result of the loss of company reputation, the loss of clients or a decline in sales. For example, if a key sales manager had built up a relationship with key clients, they may no longer want to work with the business if that key person were no longer around. This can cause them to go elsewhere and cause a dip in sales figures. In addition to this, the cost of training, recruitment and temporary cover to find a replacement can be high. This also needs to be factored into the amount of cover that is taken out. The company would need to consider how they would be impacted as a result of a loss of a key person in different ways to determine how much that individual is worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key Man Insurance|url=https://businesscoverexpert.com/key-man-insurance/|website=businesscoverexpert.com/|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy ownership==
Key person insurance policies can be owned in a number of ways depending on the needs of the business. It is common for a business to own the policy with claim proceeds being paid directly to the business. There is no legislative or insurable requirement for a policy to be owned by a specific party or entity and there may be circumstances be it for taxation or policy continuation purposes where policies may be owned and paid for by the insured person directly or owned by another individual.

==Advantages==
# In case of death of a keyman the company is paid money to cope up with the loss.
# In the USA, any business concern buying keyman insurance for its employee can claim a deduction for the premium paid for the policy as a business expense under Section 37(1) of the [[Individual Income Tax Act of 1944|Income Tax Act]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}{{disambiguation needed|date=February 2018}} Tax deductions may also apply in other countries. 
# This policy can be used as either an extra superannuation benefit or an ex-gratia payment to the key employee during the service period. If the company receives the proceeds on maturity, then they may be taxable. (With recent changes in rules, only Term Plan is available under Key  Man Insurance. Hence, there will not be any maturity benefit)
# No need of giving advanced intimation to the income tax authorities.
# The company can also raise loans on the policy from LIC. (On Term Plan,  no loan is available)
# For the executives earning high salaries, this policy can be given as a hike in salary and saves income tax.
# It becomes a great help to the business for their [[tax planning]].
# The directors can also safeguard their immediate family from getting affected by the vagaries of the industry and the various business cycles that the business has to encounter.
# Key person insurance policy helps to improve the retention of key human resources of the business.

==Disadvantages==
# The amount on claim or maturity under a key person insurance policy is not exempt under Section 10 (10D) of the [[Individual Income Tax Act of 1944|Income Tax Act]] if the company is paying the premiums unless the policy is assigned to the key person who himself/herself pay the premium.
# If the policy is surrendered then the amount endorsed is taxable in the hands of key man as profit in lieu of salary.

==Taxation==
The tax treatment for premiums paid for key person insurance and the treatment of monies received from a claim vary among countries.

Premiums are generally not tax deductible in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Sec264"&gt;{{cite book |title=IRC Sec. 264(a)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the COLI Best Practices Act within the [[Pension Protection Act of 2006]], key person insurance proceeds for policies owned by employers can be taxable if certain conditions are not met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Taxation of Key Man Insurance|url=https://www.keypersoninsurance.com/taxation/|website=KeyPersonInsurance.com|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, Key person insurance policies are generally not deductible unless used specifically for business revenue protection purposes. Claim proceeds in Australia if used for revenue purposes may be taxable and depending on the ownership of the policy, may trigger a [[Capital Gains Taxation Event]]. In the UK the main principles of key person insurance taxation were outlined by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in 1944, [[Sir John Anderson]]. The "Andersen Rules" state "Treatment for taxation purposes would depend upon the facts of the particular case and it rests with the assessing authorities and the Commissioners on appeal, if necessary, to determine the liability by reference to these facts. I am, however, advised that the general practice in dealing with insurances on the lives of employees is to treat the premiums as admissible deductions, and any sums received under a policy as trading receipts, if (i) the sole relationship is that of employer and employee; (ii) the insurance is intended to meet loss of profit resulting from the loss of services of the employee; and (iii) it is an annual or short-term insurance. Cases of premiums paid by companies to insure the lives of Directors are dealt with on similar lines."&lt;ref name="taxation"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taxation.co.uk/Articles/2011/05/11/24242/key-people|title=Key people|last=Durrant-Walker|first=Rob|date=11 May 2011|publisher=taxation.co.uk|language=English|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UK taxation for key man insurance is normally taken from the guidance set out by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1944. In answer to a parliamentary question Sir John Anderson made the following statement:
“Treatment for taxation purposes would depend upon the facts of the particular case and it rests with the assessing authorities and the Commissioners on appeal, if necessary, to determine the liability by reference to these facts. I am, however, advised that the general practice in dealing with insurances on the lives of employees is to treat the premiums as admissible deductions, and any sums received under a policy as trading receipts, if (i) the sole relationship is that of employer and employee; (ii) the insurance is intended to meet loss of profit resulting from the loss of services of the employee; and (iii) it is an annual or short-term insurance. Cases of premiums paid by companies to insure the lives of Directors are dealt with on similar lines.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key Man Insurance Taxation How It Works|url=https://www.mykeymaninsurance.com/key-man-insurance-taxation/|website=MyKeyManInsurance.com|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK tax office, HMRC, has the view that key man insurance is tax-efficient if it is taken out 'solely for the purposes of the business'. Specifically, if the company takes out a key man insurance policy to protect the business from any loss of profits that have stemmed from the loss of the employee, then the premiums are not taxable. If a key employee has a substantial number of shares, then the key man insurance could potentially be seen as being taken out for their own interests, instead of the business. This is particularly the case if critical illness cover is added to the policy. Essentially, key man insurance can be tax-efficient, but it is always best to check with a financial advisor or the local tax office before making assumptions.

'''Managerial economics'''  deals with the application of the economic concepts, theories, tools, and methodologies to solve practical problems in a business. It helps the manager in decision making and acts as a link between practice and theory".&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Allen, Managerial Economics
Theory, Applications, and Cases, 7th Edition. Norton. [http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail-contents.aspx?ID=13385 Contents].&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes referred to as [[business economics]] and is a branch of [[economics]] that applies [[microeconomic]] analysis to decision methods of businesses or other management units. 

As such, it  bridges economic theory and economics in practice.&lt;ref&gt;• [[William J. Baumol]] (1961).

==Overview==
Managerial decision areas includes:
* assessment of investible funds
* selecting business area
* choice of product.
* determining optimum output.
* sales promotion.
 
Almost any business decision can be analyzed with managerial economics techniques, but it is most commonly applied to:
* ''Risk analysis'' – various models are used to quantify [[risk]] and asymmetric [[Information economics|information]] and to employ them in [[decision theory|decision rules]] to manage risk.&lt;ref&gt;• James O. Berger (2008)."statistical decision theory," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition.

At universities, the subject is taught primarily to advanced undergraduates and graduate business students. It is approached as an integration subject. That is, it integrates many concepts from a wide variety of prerequisite courses. In many countries it is possible to read for a degree in Business Economics which often covers managerial economics, [[financial economics]], [[game theory]], business [[forecasting]] and [[industrial economics]].

== Scope ==
Managerial economics to a certain degree is prescriptive in nature as it suggests course of action to a managerial problem. Problems can be related to various departments in a firm like production, accounts, sales, etc.

(a) Operational issues
# Demand decision
# Production decision
# Theory of exchange or price theory
# All human economic activity

(b) Environmental issues
# Nature and trend of domestic business/ international environment
# nature and impact of social costs and government policy

==Demand decision ==
[[Demand]] is the willingness of potential customers to buy a commodity. It defines the market size for a commodity, and at a disaggregated level the composition of the customer base. Analysis of demand is important for a firm as its revenue, profits, and income of its employees depend on it.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. M.S. BHAT, and mk RAU.Managerial economic and financial analysis.Hyderabad.{{ISBN|978-81-7800-153-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Maxwell Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook''', [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]], [[Order of New Brunswick|ONB]] (25 May 1879 – 9 June 1964) was a Canadian-British newspaper publisher and backstage politician who was an influential figure in British media and politics of the first half of the 20th century.  His base of power was the largest circulation newspaper in the world, the ''[[Daily Express]]'', which appealed to the conservative working class with intensely patriotic news and editorials. During the [[Second World War]] he played a major role in mobilising industrial resources as Winston Churchill's minister of aircraft production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/max-aitken-lord-beaverbrook/ "Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook."] ''The Canadian Encyclopedia.'' Retrieved: 6 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Beaverbrook although a Baronet CANNOT have both the Baronetcy and Peerage; they are a contradiction. The peerage supersedes the Baronetcy (although the baronetcy is hereditary too but is still classed above all knighthoods but is not a hereditary peerage but an honour) so he is William Maxwell 'Max' Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook Bt.--&gt;

The young Max Aitken had a gift for making money&lt;!-- Explain --&gt; and was a millionaire by 30. His business ambitions quickly exceeded opportunities in Canada and he moved to Britain. There he befriended [[Bonar Law]] and with his support won a seat in the House of Commons at the [[United Kingdom general election, December 1910|general election]] held in December 1910. A knighthood followed shortly after. During the [[First World War]] he ran the Canadian Records office in London, and played a role in the removal of [[H. H. Asquith]] as prime minister in 1916. The resulting [[Lloyd George ministry|coalition government]] (with [[Lloyd George]] as prime minister and Bonar Law as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]), rewarded Aitken with a peerage and, briefly, a Cabinet post as [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Minister of Information]].

Post-war, the now Lord Beaverbrook concentrated on his business interests. He built the ''Daily Express'' into the most successful mass-circulation newspaper in the world, with sales of 2.25 million copies a day across Britain. He used it to pursue personal campaigns, most notably for tariff reform and for the [[British Empire]] to become a [[free trade]] bloc. Beaverbrook supported the government of [[Stanley Baldwin]] and that of [[Neville Chamberlain]] throughout the 1930s and was persuaded by another long standing political friend, [[Winston Churchill]], to serve as his [[Minister of Aircraft Production]] from May 1940. Churchill and others later praised his Ministerial contributions.&lt;ref name=wcv2&gt;{{harvnb|Churchill|1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned due to ill-health in 1941 but later in the war was appointed [[Lord Privy Seal]]. Beaverbrook spent his later life running his newspapers, which by then included the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' and the ''Sunday Express''.&lt;ref name="PTitans"&gt;{{cite web |author=Peter Jackson &amp; Tom de Castella|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14136044|title=Clash of the press titans|publisher=BBC News|date=14 July 2011|accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as Chancellor of the [[University of New Brunswick]] and developed a reputation as a historian with his books on political and military history.&lt;ref name="OxfordComp"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Ramsden (Editor)|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|title=Oxford Companion to Twentieth Century British Politics|ISBN=0-19-861036-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marshalww2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Mavrikis (Editor)|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|year=2005|title=History of World War II|ISBN=978-0-7614-7231-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Early life==
Aitken was born in [[Maple, Ontario]], Canada, in 1879, one of the ten children of William Cuthbert Aitken, a Scottish-born [[Presbyterian]] minister&lt;ref&gt;who served under the Bounty or [[Annates#Britain|Augmentation Scheme]], see Beaverbrook 1963 p.107&lt;/ref&gt; and Jane Noble, the daughter of a prosperous local farmer and storekeeper. When he was a year old, the family moved to [[Newcastle, New Brunswick]], which Aitken later considered to be his hometown. It was here, at the age of 13, that he set up a school newspaper, ''The Leader''. Whilst at school, he delivered newspapers, sold newspaper subscriptions and was the local correspondent for the ''St. John Daily Star''.&lt;ref name="DoWB"&gt;{{cite book|author= Frank N. Magill (Editor)|publisher=Salem Press|year=1999|title=Dictionary of World Biography Vol VII The 20th Century A-Gl|ISBN=0-89356-321-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aitken took the entrance examinations for [[Dalhousie University]], but because he had refused to sit the Greek and Latin papers he was refused entry. He registered at the [[University of New Brunswick Faculty of Law|King's College Law School]], but left after a short while. This was to be his only formal higher education. Aitken worked in a shop then borrowed some money to move to [[Chatham, New Brunswick]] where he worked as a local correspondent for the ''[[Montreal Star]]'', sold life insurance and also collected debts. Aitken attempted to train as a lawyer and worked for a short time in the law office of [[Richard Bedford Bennett]], a future prime minister of Canada. Aitken managed Bennett's successful campaign for a place on Chatham Town Council. When Bennett left the law firm, Aitken moved to [[Saint John, New Brunswick]] where he again sold life insurance before moving to [[Calgary]] where he helped to run Bennett's campaign for a seat in the [[Legislative Assembly of the North-West Territories]] in the [[Northwest Territories general election, 1898|1898 general election]]. After an unsuccessful attempt to establish a meat business, Aitken returned to Saint John and to selling insurance.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite book|author= HCG Matthew &amp; Brian Harrison (Editors)|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Vol 1 (Arron-Amory)|ISBN=0-19-861351-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early business career==
In 1900, Aitken made his way to [[Halifax (former city)|Halifax]], Nova Scotia, where [[John F. Stairs]], a member of the city's dominant business family, gave him employment and trained him in the business of finance. In 1904, when Stairs launched the [[Royal Securities Corporation]], Aitken became a minority shareholder and the firm's general manager. Under the tutelage of Stairs, who would be his mentor and friend, Aitken engineered a number of successful business deals and was planning a series of bank mergers. Stairs' unexpected early death in September 1904 led to Aitken acquiring control of the company and moving to Montreal, then the business capital of Canada. There he bought and sold companies, invested in stocks and shares and also developed business interests in both Cuba and Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory P. Marchildon, ''Profits and politics: Beaverbrook and the gilded age of Canadian finance'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; He started a weekly magazine, the ''Canadian Century'' in 1910, invested in the ''[[Montreal Herald]]'' and almost acquired the ''[[Montreal Gazette]]''.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; In 1907 he founded the [[Montreal Engineering Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Profits and politics: Beaverbrook and the gilded age of Canadian finance|author =Gregory P. Marchildon| publisher = University of Toronto Press| year = 1996|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wsF3hL-POfAC| chapter = 5.

In 1910–1911 Aitken acquired a number of small regional cement plants in Canada, including [[Sandford Fleming]]'s Western Canada Cement Co. plant at [[Exshaw, Alberta]], and amalgamated them into Canada Cement, eventually controlling four-fifths of the cement production in Canada. Canada was booming economically at the time, and Aitken had a monopoly on the material. There were irregularities in the stock transfers leading to the conglomeration of the cement plants, resulting in much criticism of Aitken, as well as accusations of price-gouging and poor management of the cement plants under his company's control.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/05/13/105027570.pdf ''The New York Times'', 13 May 1911, "Canadian Cement Scandal,"; Edmonton Bulletin, Nov. 30, 1911]&lt;/ref&gt; Aitken sold his shares, making a large amount of money.

Aitken had made his first visit to Britain in September 1908, and when he returned there in the spring of 1910, in an attempt to raise money to form a steel company, he decided to make the move permanent,&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; but not before he led the underwriting, with a preponderance of British money, of an amalgamation of smaller units into the [[Steel Company of Canada]].&lt;ref name=ajpt&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very shortly later Aitken moved his family to the UK.&lt;ref name=kidd&gt;{{cite book|author= Janet Aitken Kidd|publisher=Collins|year=1988|title=The Beaverbrook Girl: An Autobiography|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Move to Britain==
[[File:Cherkley Court - geograph.org.uk - 1257519.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Cherkley Court]]
In 1910, Aitken moved to Britain and he became friends with [[Andrew Bonar Law]], a native of New Brunswick and the only Canadian to become [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]. The two men had a lot in common: they were both sons of the [[manse]] from Scottish-Canadian families and both were successful businessmen. Aitken persuaded Bonar Law to support him in standing for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Unionist Party]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, December 1910|December 1910 general election]] at [[Ashton-under-Lyne (UK Parliament constituency)|Ashton-under-Lyne]]. Aitken was an excellent organiser and, with plenty of money for publicity, he won the seat by 196 votes.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gtwar"&gt;{{cite web |author=Firstworldwar.com|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/beaverbrook.htm|title=Who's Who – Lord Beaverbrook|date=|accessdate=15 October 2014|work=Firstworldwar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aitken rarely spoke in the House of Commons, but did promise substantial financial support to the Unionist Party, and in 1911 he was knighted by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]]. Aitken's political influence grew when Bonar Law replaced [[A.J. Balfour]] as leader of the Unionist party late in 1911. Aitken bought [[Cherkley Court]] near [[Leatherhead]] and entertained lavishly there. In 1913 the house was offered as a venue for negotiations, between Bonar Law and the Prime Minister, [[H.H. Asquith]], over Ulster and [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Irish home rule]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;
Later in life Aitken wrote about his early political efforts:&lt;ref name=b16&gt;{{harvnb|Beaverbrook|1963|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Empire Fiscal Union was, in fact, my only reason for entering politics in Britain and for continuing to take an interest in public life. My devotion to Bonar Law, my belief in his Leadership, my faith in his ability to give to the Empire some day, perhaps some day soon, the Union I so ardently desired, had kept me in close and intimate touch with him and his political problems.}}

Aitken continued to grow his business interests while in Parliament and also began to build a British newspaper empire. After the death of [[Charles Rolls]] in 1910, Aitken bought his shares in [[Rolls-Royce Limited]], and over the next two years gradually increased his holding in the company. However, [[Claude Johnson]], Rolls-Royce's Commercial managing director, resisted Aitken's attempt to gain control of the company, and in October 1913 he sold his holding to [[James Buchanan Duke]], of the [[American Tobacco Company]].&lt;ref name="PPugh"&gt;{{cite book|author= Peter Pugh|publisher=Icon Books|year=2001|title= The Magic of a Name: The Rolls-Royce Story, The First 40 Years |ISBN=1-84046-151-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1911, Aitken, secretly, invested £25,000 in the failing ''[[Daily Express]]''. An attempt to buy the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' failed but he did gain control of another London evening paper, ''[[The Globe (London newspaper)|The Globe]]''. In November 1916 a share deal worth £17,500, with Lawson Johnson, landed Aitken a controlling interest in the ''Daily Express'', but again he kept the deal secret.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

==First World War==
[[File:Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook (seated).jpg|thumb|left|Lord Beaverbrook]]
During the [[First World War]] the Canadian government placed Aitken in charge of creating the Canadian War Records Office in London, and he made certain that news of Canada's contribution to the war was printed in Canadian and British newspapers. He was innovative in the employment of artists, photographers, and film makers to record life on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Aitken also established the Canadian War Memorials Fund that evolved into a collection of art works by the premier artists and sculptors in Britain and Canada.&lt;ref name="Harries"&gt;{{cite book|author=Merion Harries &amp; Susie Harries|publisher=Michael Joseph, The Imperial War Museum &amp; the Tate Gallery|year=1983|title=The War Artists, British Official War Art of the Twentieth Century |ISBN=071812314X}}&lt;/ref&gt; His visits to the Western Front, with the honorary rank of [[Colonel (Canada)|colonel]] in the [[Canadian Army]], resulted in his 1916 book ''Canada in Flanders'', a three-volume collection that chronicled the achievements of Canadian soldiers on the battlefields. After the war Aitken wrote several books including ''Politicians and the Press'' in 1925 and ''Politicians and the War'' in 1928.

Aitken became increasingly hostile towards the Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith whom he considered to be mismanaging the war effort. Aitken's opinion of Asquith did not improve when he failed to get a post in the Cabinet reshuffle of May 1915. An attempt by Bonar Law to secure the [[Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]] for Aitken was also blocked by Asquith. Aitken was happy to play a small part, which he greatly exaggerated, as a go-between when Asquith was forced from office and replaced by [[David Lloyd George]] in December 1916.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; Lloyd George offered to appoint Aitken as [[President of the Board of Trade]]. At that time, an MP taking a cabinet post for the first time had to resign and stand for re-election in a by-election. Aitken made arrangements for this, but then Lloyd George decided to appoint [[Albert Stanley, 1st Baron Ashfield|Albert Stanley]] instead. Aitken was a friend of Stanley and agreed to continue with the resignation, so that Stanley could take Aitken's seat in Parliament and be eligible for ministerial office. In return, Aitken received a peerage on 23 January 1917 as the ''1st Baron Beaverbrook'',{{sfn|Blake|1955|pp=346–347}}&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29913|page=842|date=23 January 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; the name [[Beaverbrook, New Brunswick|"Beaverbrook"]] being adopted from a small community near his boyhood home. He had initially considered "Lord [[Miramichi River|Miramichi]]", but rejected it on the advice of [[Louise Manny]] as too difficult to pronounce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://annamation.wordpress.com/2008/08/18/st-john-nb-the-magnificent-irvings-art-heist-at-beaverbrook-gallery/ "St John NB &amp; The Magnificent Irvings + Art heist at Beaverbrook Gallery."] ''wordpress.com,'' 18 August. 2008.

Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rayburn 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Beaverbrook" also had the advantage of conveying a distinctive Canadian ring to the title.

Later in 1917, Beaverbrook's controlling stake in the ''Daily Express'' became public knowledge and he was criticised by parts of the Conservative Party for financing a publication they regarded as irresponsible and often unhelpful to the party.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

In February 1918, Beaverbrook became the first Minister of Information in the newly formed [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]], was also made [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]] and was sworn of the [[Privy Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30557|page=2775|date=5 March 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beaverbrook became responsible for propaganda in Allied and neutral countries and [[Lord Northcliffe]] (owner of the ''Daily Mail'' and ''The Times'') became Director of Propaganda with control of propaganda in enemy countries. Beaverbrook established the [[British War Memorials Committee]] within the Ministry, on lines similar to the earlier Canadian war art scheme, but when he established a private charity that would receive income from BWMC exhibitions, it was regarded as a conflict of interest and he dropped the scheme.&lt;ref name="Harries"/&gt; Beaverbrook had a number of clashes with the Foreign Secretary [[Arthur Balfour]] over the use of intelligence material. He felt that intelligence should become part of his department, but Balfour disagreed. Eventually the intelligence committee was assigned to Beaverbrook but they then resigned en masse to be re-employed by the Foreign Office. In August 1918, Lloyd George became furious with Beaverbrook over a leader in the ''Daily Express'' threatening to withdraw support from the government over tariff reform. Beaverbrook increasingly came under attack from MPs who distrusted a press baron being employed by the state. Beaverbrook survived but became increasingly frustrated with his limited role and influence, and in October 1918, he resigned due to ill health.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; A tooth had become infected with [[actinomycosis]] and the often fatal disease progressed into his throat; his English doctors were unable to discover a cure and it was a Portuguese medic who cured him by administering orally iodine solution until the fungus was arrested.&lt;ref name=kidd/&gt;

[[A J P Taylor]] later wrote that Beaverbrook was a pathbreaker who "invented all the methods of publicity" used by Britain to promote the war, including the nation's first war artists, the first war photographers, and the first makers of war films. He was especially effective in promoting the sales of [[war bond]]s to the general public. Nevertheless, he was widely disliked and distrusted by the political elite, who were suspicious of all they sneeringly called "press lords."&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 1972, pp. 137 (quote), 129, 135, 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baron of Fleet Street==
[[File:Lord Beaverbrook 1941.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Lord Beaverbrook, c. August 1941]]
After the war, Beaverbrook concentrated on running the ''Daily Express''. He turned the dull newspaper into a glittering and witty journal with an optimistic attitude, filled with an array of dramatic photo layouts. He hired first-rate writers such as [[Francis Williams (journalist)|Francis Williams]] and the cartoonist [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]]. He embraced new technology and bought new presses to print the paper in Manchester. In 1919 the circulation of the ''Daily Express'' was under 40,000 a day; by 1937 it was 2,329,000 a day, making it the most successful of all British newspapers and generating huge profits for Beaverbrook whose wealth was already such that he never took a salary. After the [[Second World War]], the ''Daily Express'' became the largest-selling newspaper in the world, with a circulation of 3,706,000. Beaverbrook launched the ''Sunday Express'' in December 1918, but it only established a significant readership after [[John Junor]] became its editor in 1954. In 1923, in a joint deal with [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Lord Rothermere]], Beaverbrook bought the ''[[Evening Standard]]''. Beaverbrook acquired a controlling stake in the Glasgow ''[[Evening Citizen]]'' and, in 1928, he launched the ''Scottish Daily Express''.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

Consolidation was rampant.   James Curran and [[Jean Seaton]] state:
: after the death of Lord Northcliffe in 1922, four men–Lords Beaverbrook, [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Rothermere]] (1868-1940), [[William Berry, 1st Viscount Camrose|Camrose]] (1879-1954) and [[Gomer Berry, 1st Viscount Kemsley|Kemsley]] (1883-1968)–became the dominant figures in the inter-war press. In 1937, for instance, they owned nearly one in every two national and local daily papers sold in Britain, as well as one in every three Sunday papers that were sold. The combined circulation of all their newspapers amounted to over thirteen million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Curran|author2=Jean Seaton|title=Power Without Responsibility: Press, Broadcasting and the Internet in Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GM6OAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT72|date= 2009|publisher=Routledge|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Beaverbrook purchased [[The Vineyard, Fulham]], a "tiny Tudor house in Hurlingham Road" which ... "far from the centre of London I was relieved of casual callers and comparatively free of long-winded visitors. I provided facilities by means of private telephone lines without any direct contact with the Telephone Exchanges. Thus the political conferences held there were safeguarded against interruption."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beaverbrook|1963|p=65ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Powerful friends and acquaintances such as Asquith, Lloyd George, Churchill, [[Frederick Edwin Smith]], [[Philip Sassoon]], [[Lady Diana Cooper|Diana]] and [[Duff Cooper]], Balfour and [[Tim Healy (politician)|Tim Healy]] were guests at both Cherkley and the Vineyard. The circle included  [[Valentine Browne, 6th Earl of Kenmare|Valentine Castlerosse]], [[H. G. Wells]] and [[Rudyard Kipling]], who was godfather to Beaverbrook's youngest son Peter, but this did nothing to repair the rift that developed between them when Beaverbrook endorsed [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Irish Home Rule]].&lt;ref name=kidd/&gt;

Beaverbrook, the first baron of [[Fleet Street]], was often denounced as excessively powerful because his newspapers supposedly could make or break almost anyone. Beaverbrook enjoyed using his papers to attack his opponents and to promote his friends. From 1919 to 1922 he attacked [[David Lloyd George]] and his government on several issues. He began supporting independent Conservative candidates and campaigned for fifteen years to remove [[Stanley Baldwin]] from the leadership of the Conservative Party. He very shrewdly sold the majority of his share holdings before the [[1929 crash]] and in the resulting depression launched a new political party to promote free trade within the British Empire. [[Empire Free Trade Crusade]] candidates had some success. An Independent Conservative who supported Empire Free Trade won the [[Twickenham by-election, 1929|Twickenham by-election]] in 1929. The Empire Free Trade candidate won the [[Paddington South by-election, 1930|South Paddington by-election]] in October 1930. In February 1931, Empire Free Trade lost the [[Islington East by-election, 1931|Islington East by-election]] and by splitting the vote with the Conservatives allowed [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] to hold a seat they had been expected to lose.&lt;ref name=kidd/&gt; Duff Cooper's victory for the Conservatives in [[Westminster St George's by-election, 1931|St. George's Westminster]] by-election in March 1931 marked the end of the movement as an electoral force.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=F. W. S. Craig|title=Minor Parties at British Parliamentary Elections 1885–1974|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dA6xCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA109|year=1975|isbn=978-1-349-02346-2|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 March 1931, during [[Westminster St George's by-election, 1931|the St. George's Westminster by-election]], Stanley Baldwin described the media barons who owned British newspapers as having "Power without responsibility&amp;nbsp;– the prerogative of the harlot throughout the ages."&lt;ref name=kidd/&gt; In the 1930s, while personally attempting to dissuade [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]] from continuing his affair with American divorcee, [[Wallis Simpson]], Beaverbrook's newspapers published every titbit of the affair, especially allegations about pro-Nazi sympathies. Beaverbrook supported the [[Munich Agreement]] and hoped the newly named [[Duke of Windsor]] would seek a peace deal with Germany.

Testifying before a Parliamentary inquiry in 1947, former Express employee and future MP [[Michael Foot]] alleged that Beaverbrook kept a blacklist of notable public figures who were to be denied any publicity in his papers because of personal disputes. Foot said they included Sir [[Thomas Beecham]], [[Paul Robeson]], [[Haile Selassie]] and [[Noël Coward]]. Beaverbrook himself gave evidence before the inquiry and vehemently denied the allegations; Express Newspapers general manager E.J. Robertson denied that Robeson had been blacklisted, but did admit that Coward had been "boycotted" because he had enraged Beaverbrook with his film ''[[In Which We Serve]]'', for in the opening sequence Coward included an ironic shot showing a copy of the ''Daily Express'' floating in the dockside rubbish bearing the headline "No War This Year".&lt;ref&gt;Movie 'In Which We Serve' 0:05:57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sweet"&gt;Sweet 2005, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chisholm"&gt;{{cite book|author= Anne Chisholm &amp; Machael Davie|publisher=Knopf|year=1993|title=Lord Beaverbrook: A Life|isbn=978-0-394-56879-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1930s, Beaverbrook used his newspapers to promote the [[appeasement]] policies of the [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain]] government. The slogan 'There will be no war' was used by the ''Daily Express''.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Cox  'Countdown to War' page 104&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==
[[File:Maxwell Aitken (lord Beaverbrook) during the Second World War HU88386.jpg|right|thumb|Lord Beaverbrook during the Second World War]]
During the Second World War, in May 1940, his friend [[Winston Churchill]], the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], appointed Beaverbrook as [[Minister of Aircraft Production]]. With Churchill's blessing, Beaverbrook overhauled all aspects of war-time aircraft production. He increased production targets by 15% across the board, took control of aircraft repairs and RAF storage units, replaced the management of plants that were underperforming, and released German Jewish engineers from internment to work in the factories. He seized materials and equipment destined for other departments and was perpetually at odds with the [[Air Ministry]].&lt;ref name="GffBest"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Best|publisher=Humbledon and London|year=2005|title=Churchill and War |ISBN=1852854642}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Iron railing#History|appeal for pots and pans]] "to make Spitfires" was afterwards revealed by his son Sir Max Aitken to have been nothing more than a propaganda exercise. Still, a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' cover story declared, "Even if Britain goes down this fall, it will not be Lord Beaverbrook's fault. If she holds out, it will be his triumph. This war is a war of machines. It will be won on the assembly line."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,764676-2,00.html "Great Britain: Shirts On."] ''Time,'' 16 September 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Beaverbrook, fighter and bomber production increased so much so that Churchill declared: "His personal force and genius made this Aitken's finest hour." Beaverbrook's impact on wartime production has been much debated but he certainly energised production at a time when it was desperately needed. However, it has  been argued that aircraft production was already rising when Beaverbrook took charge and that he was fortunate to inherit a system which was just beginning to bear fruit.&lt;ref&gt;Deighton 1980, pp. 164–165.&lt;/ref&gt;  Air Chief Marshal [[Lord Dowding]], Head of Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain wrote that "We had the organization, we had the men, we had the spirit which could bring us victory in the air but we had not the supply of machines necessary to withstand the drain of continuous battle. Lord Beaverbrook gave us those machines, and I do not believe that I exaggerate when I say that no other man in England could have done so."&lt;ref name=kidd/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=37719 |pages=4543– |supp=y |title=The Battle of Britain |date=11 Sep 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spitfiresite.com/2010/04/battle-of-britain-in-the-words-of-air-chief-marshal-hugh-dowding.html spitfiresite.com: "Battle of Britain in the Words of Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beaverbrook resigned on 30 April 1941 and, after a month as Minister of State, Churchill appointed him to the post of [[Minister of Supply]]. Here Beaverbrook clashed with [[Ernest Bevin]] who, as [[Minister of Labour and National Service]], refused to let Beaverbrook take over any of his responsibilities. In February 1942, Beaverbrook became [[Minister of Production|Minister of War Production]] and again clashed with Bevin, this time over shipbuilding. In the face of Bevin's refusal to work with him, Beaverbrook resigned after only twelve days in the post. In September 1943 he was appointed [[Lord Privy Seal]], outside of the Cabinet, and held that post until the end of the war.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

In 1941, Beaverbrook headed the British delegation to Moscow with his American counterpart [[W. Averell Harriman|Averell Harriman]]. This made Beaverbrook the first senior British politician to meet Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] since [[Adolf Hitler]]'s invasion of the Soviet Union. Much impressed by Stalin and the sacrifice of the Soviet people, he returned to London determined to persuade Churchill to launch a second front in Europe to help draw [[Nazi Germany|German]] resources away from the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] to aid the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/BUbeaverbrook.htm "Lord Beaverbrook."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329121817/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/BUbeaverbrook.htm |date=29 March 2010 }}  ''Spartacus.'' Retrieved: 6 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their disagreement over the second front, Beaverbrook remained a close confidant of Churchill throughout the war, and could regularly be found with Churchill until the early hours of the morning. [[Clement Attlee]] commented that "Churchill often listened to Beaverbrook's advice but was too sensible to take it."{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

In addition to his ministerial roles, Beaverbrook headed the Anglo-American [[Combined Raw Materials Board]] from 1942 to 1945 and accompanied Churchill to several wartime meetings with [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]]. He was able to relate to Roosevelt in a different way to Churchill and became close to Roosevelt during these visits. This friendship sometimes irritated Churchill who felt that Beaverbrook was distracting Roosevelt from concentrating on the war effort. For his part Roosevelt seems to have enjoyed the distraction.

==Later life==
Beaverbrook devoted himself to Churchill's [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 General Election]] campaign, but a ''Daily Express'' headline warning that a Labour victory would amount to the 'Gestapo in Britain' was a huge mistake and completely misjudged the public mood.&lt;ref name="DoWB"/&gt; Beaverbrook renounced his British citizenship and left the Conservative Party in 1951 but remained an Empire loyalist throughout his life. He opposed both Britain's acceptance of post-war loans from America and Britain's application to join the [[European Economic Community]] in 1961.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; In 1953 he became chancellor-for-life of the [[University of New Brunswick]] through an Act of the local legislature.&lt;ref name=moyal&gt;[https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/JNBS/article/view/25393/29396 unb.ca: "A Conversation with Ann Moyal, Lord Beaverbrook’s Researcher"], [[Journal of New Brunswick Studies|JNBS]] vol 7 no 2&lt;/ref&gt; He became the university's greatest benefactor, fulfilling the same role for the city of [[Fredericton, New Brunswick|Fredericton]] and the province as a whole. He would provide additional buildings for the university, scholarship funds, the [[Beaverbrook Art Gallery]], the Beaverbrook Skating Rink, the Lord Beaverbrook Hotel, with profits donated to charity, the [[The Playhouse (Fredericton)|Playhouse]], [[Louise Manny]]'s early folklore work, and numerous other projects. He bought the archive papers of both Bonar Law and David Lloyd George and placed them in the Beaverbrook Library within the [[Daily Express Building, London|Daily Express Building]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Gladys Drury on a rooftop in Halifax, Nova Scotia.jpg|thumb|Gladys Drury, sometime before her marriage]]
On 29 January 1906, in Halifax, Aitken married Gladys Henderson Drury, daughter of Major-General Charles William Drury [[CBE]] (a first cousin of Admiral Sir [[Charles Carter Drury]]) and Mary Louise Drury (née Henderson). They had three children before her death on 1 December 1927.&lt;ref name=kidd/&gt; Their son [[Sir Max Aitken, 2nd Baronet|Max Aitken Jr.]] became a fighter pilot with 601 Squadron, rising to [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] with 16 victories in World War II. Beaverbrook remained a widower for many years until 1963 when he married [[Marcia Anastasia Christoforides]] (1910–1994), the widow of his friend [[Sir James Dunn]]. Beaverbrook was rarely a faithful husband, and even in old age was often accused of treating women with disrespect.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; In Britain he established the then-married Jean Norton as his mistress at Cherkley. Aitken left Norton for a Jewish ballet dancer named Lily Ernst whom he had rescued from pre-war Austria.&lt;ref name=Jameson&gt;{{cite web |author=Leonie Jameson|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/sex-and-power-1312660.html |title=Sex and Power |date= 2 December 1996|accessdate= 1 May 2017|work= The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historian==
After the First World War, Beaverbrook had written ''Politicians and the Press'' in 1925 and ''Politicians and the War'' in 1928 and had the two books were reprinted as one volume in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon their original publication, the books were largely ignored by professional historians and the only favourable reviews were in Beaverbrook's own newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the combined edition came out, the reviews were more positive.&lt;ref name=dr&gt;[https://dalspace.library.dal.ca/bitstream/handle/10222/60112/dalrev_vol59_iss1_pp129_143.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y Dalhousie Review v59 n1 p129: "Lord Beaverbrook: Historian Extraordinary"] by JM McEwen&lt;/ref&gt; A. J. P. Taylor said it was "Tacitus and Aubrey rolled into one".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 645.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dr/&gt;

Later Taylor said: "The enduring merits of the book are really beyond cavil. It provides essential testimony for events during a great political crisis...It contains character sketches worthy of Aubrey. On a wider canvas, it displays the behaviour of political leaders in wartime. The narrative is carried along by rare zest and wit, yet with the detached impartialty of the true scholar".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, pp. 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[John Elliot (railway manager)|John Elliot]] in 1981 said the work "will remain, despite all carping, the authoritative narrative; nor does the story want in the telling thereof".&lt;ref&gt;John Elliot, ‘Aitken, William Maxwell, first Baron Beaverbrook (1879–1964)’, ''Dictionary of National Biography'' (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Men and Power 1917–1918'' was published in 1956. It is not a coherent narrative but divided by separate episodes centred on one man, such as Carson, Robertson, Rothermere and others. The reviews were favourable, with Taylor's review in ''[[The Observer]]'' greatly pleasing Beaverbrook.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, pp. 629–630.&lt;/ref&gt; The book sold over 23,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 629.&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''The Decline and Fall of Lloyd George'' was published in 1963, favourable reviewers included Clement Attlee, [[Roy Jenkins]], [[Robert Blake, Baron Blake|Robert Blake]], [[Frank Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford|Lord Longford]], Sir [[C. P. Snow]], Lady [[Violet Bonham Carter]], [[Richard Crossman]] and [[Denis Brogan]].&lt;ref name="Taylor, p. 655"&gt;Taylor, p. 655.&lt;/ref&gt; Kenneth Young said the book was "the finest of all his writing".&lt;ref name="Taylor, p. 655"/&gt;

Beaverbrook was both admired and despised in Britain, sometimes at the same time: in his 1956 autobiography, [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]] quotes H.G. Wells as saying of Beaverbrook: "If ever Max ever gets to Heaven, he won't last long. He will be chucked out for trying to pull off a merger between Heaven and Hell after having secured a controlling interest in key subsidiary companies in both places, of course."{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Beaverbrook was of an imperialist mindset, with the quote, "There are countries so underdeveloped today that the gift of independence is like the gift of a razor to a child" attributed to him in a panel discussion on Canadian TV.&lt;ref name="Fighting Words, March 19, 1961"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/fighting-words-the-perils-of-independence-and-irish-cry-babies|title=Fighting Words: The perils of independence and Irish cry-babies |publisher=CBC Digital Archives|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Lord Beaverbrook died in Surrey in 1964, aged 85. He had recently attended a birthday banquet organised by fellow Canadian press baron, [[Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet|Lord Thomson of Fleet]], where he was determined to be seen on his usual good form, despite suffering from cancer. The Beaverbrook Foundation continues his philanthropic interests. In 1957, a bronze statue of Lord Beaverbrook was erected at the centre of Officers' Square in Fredericton, New Brunswick, paid for by money raised by children throughout the province. A bust of him by [[Oscar Nemon]] stands in the park in the town square of Newcastle, New Brunswick, not far from where he sold newspapers as a young boy.&lt;ref name=moyal/&gt; His ashes are in the plinth of the bust.&lt;ref name=kidd/&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[File:Lord Beaverbook Plaque.jpg|thumb|Lord Beaverbrook plaque in Maple, Ontario]]
For a period of time Beaverbrook employed novelist [[Evelyn Waugh]] in London and abroad. Waugh later lampooned his employer by portraying him as Lord Copper in ''[[Scoop (novel)|Scoop]]'' and as Lord Monomark in both ''[[Put Out More Flags]]'' and ''[[Vile Bodies]]''.

[[The Kinks]] recorded "Mr Churchill Says" for their 1969 album [[Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)|Arthur]], which contains the lines: "Mr Beaverbrook says: 'We've gotta save our tin/And all the garden gates and empty cans are gonna make us win...'."

Beaverbrook was one of eight notable Britons cited in [[Bjørge Lillelien]]'s famous "Your boys took a hell of a beating" commentary at the end of an [[English football team]] defeat to [[Norway football|Norway]] in 1981, mentioned alongside British Prime Ministers Churchill, Thatcher and Attlee.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|PqZTP8-8wIs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/16433259.stm "News."] ''BBC'' via Youtube. Retrieved: 13 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[alternate history]] novel, ''[[Dominion (Sansom novel)|Dominion]]'' by [[C. J. Sansom]], Beaverbrook serves as Prime Minister for most of the novel, which sees Britain as a puppet state of a longer-lived Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Sansom, C.J. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/19/sansom-dominion-nightmare-nazi-britain "My nightmare of a Nazi Britain."]  ''The Guardian,'' 19 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neihu District''' is a [[District (Taiwan)|district]] of [[Taipei|Taipei City]], [[Taiwan]]. Neihu means "inner lake." The older name originates from the [[Ketagalan]] word ''Tayour'' (transliterated by the Dutch as ''Cattajo''), meaning woman's head ornament.

Many mountainous roads and paths, which are ideal for hiking, connect Neihu with the neighboring [[Shilin District]] and [[Yangmingshan National Park]]. The Tri-Service General Hospital, which is a teaching hospital of the National Defense Medical Center, is also in Neihu. The [[Wuchih Mountain Military Cemetery]] borders Neihu.

In 2018, Neihu became the seat of the [[American Institute in Taiwan]] (AIT), the de facto embassy of the United States in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-diplomacy/u-s-unveils-de-facto-embassy-in-taiwan-amid-china-tensions-idUSKBN1J72QS|title=U.S. shows new de facto embassy in Taiwan amid China tensions|last=Yu|first=Jess Macy|date=2018-06-11|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Bloomfield''' (February 1946 – April 2016){{cn|date=June 2016}} was a British property investor known as "Boom-boom" Bloomfield.

==Career==
Bloomfield was involved with a string of high-profile deals during the 1980s and was known as the man that sourced the deals that made [[Tony Clegg (businessman)|Tony Clegg]]'s [[Mountleigh]] a stock market favourite in 1986-87.
 
In 1989, it emerged that he was the joint owner of the [[Alton Towers]] theme park and a leisure venture at [[Battersea Power Station]] after he formed a joint venture, Alton International, with David Broome of Alton Group who was struggling to complete the Battersea project.&lt;ref&gt;"Bloomfield Emerges as Co-owner of Alton Group", Paul Cheeseright, ''[[The Financial Times]]'', 31 May 1989, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

He became bankrupt during the 1990s property crash. He later moved to Russia where he made successful deals in the former Soviet states. He helped to raise the finance for the redevelopment of [[Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bilton |first=Richard |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31459067 |title=HMRC failed to prosecute tycoon over tax evasion |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Allen |first=Vanessa |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2955065/Let-property-tycoon-paid-no-tax-24-years-Entrepreneur-enjoyed-lavish-lifestyle-without-submitting-returns.html |title=Investor Paul Bloomfield let off not paying tax for 24 years |website=Dailymail.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Powell |first=Tom |url=http://www.theolivepress.es/spain-news/2015/02/16/multi-millionaire-who-avoided-tax-for-24-years-could-be-in-spain/ |title=British multi-millionaire property investor who avoided tax for 24 years could be in Spain &amp;#124; Olive Press News Spain |website=Theolivepress.es |date=2015-02-16 |accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/feb/13/observerbusiness.theobserver8 |title=Cloth that was cut too close &amp;#124; Business |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=2000-02-12 |accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alexi Mostrous |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/prince-and-oligarch-s-mansion-deal-hflfbq0dg |title=Prince and oligarch’s mansion deal &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; The Times &amp; The Sunday Times |website=Thetimes.co.uk |date=2016-06-11 |accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Photokina''' (rendered in the promoters' branding as "photokina") is a [[trade fair]] held in Europe for the [[Photography|photographic]] and [[Reprography|imaging]] industries. It is the world's largest such trade fair.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The first Photokina was held in [[Cologne]], [[Germany]], in 1950, and since 1966 it has been held biennially in September at the [[koelnmesse]] Trade Fair and Exhibition Centre in [[Deutz, Cologne|Deutz]]. The fair became an annual event starting in 2018, and will move to May starting in 2019.&lt;ref name=Baskin&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dpreview.com/news/7503898674/photokina-repositions-itself-will-become-an-annual-event |title=Photokina 'repositions' itself, will become an annual event |first=Dale |last=Baskin |publisher=''[[Digital Photography Review]]'' |date=May 23, 2017 |accessdate=May 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many photographic and imaging companies introduce and showcase [[state of the art]] imaging products at Photokina.

==Similar trade shows==
The show has two main competitors, both of which are annual shows held in different parts of the world. The CP+ show in [[Yokohama]], [[Japan]], originally the Japan Camera Show, has been held since the early 1960s. In the [[United States|U.S.]], the main photography show is [[Photo Marketing Association|PMA@CES]], which since 2012 has coincided with the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].

==History==
The first Photokina was held in 1950 at the initiative of {{Interlanguage link multi|Bruno Uhl|de}}. U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] sent a greeting [[telegram]] marking the opening of Photokina in 1956.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

A '''resin dispensing system''' is a technical installation to process [[casting resin]] for the purpose of filling, sealing, covering or soaking technical parts, especially in the field of electricity and electronics like [[transformer]]s, [[Liquid crystal display|LCDs]] and other devices of various size.

Due to progressing miniaturization and introduction of electronics into new areas, quality requirements for the parts are rising, and thus the quality of dispensing must be increased as well. To obtain the required quality, on one hand, the resin system has to be developed and optimized accordingly. On the other hand, the resin dispensing system has to work more and more precisely to obtain best dispensing. Because of continuously increasing cost pressure, casting devices must be capable of increased quality, while also becoming faster and more reliable.

== Requirements for good dispensing ==

First of all, by dispensing, electrical and electronic parts have to be insulated reliably and penetration of moisture has to be excluded totally. Very often heat has to be conducted out from the part properly, an attribute that can be improved by the choice of an appropriate resin e.g. epoxy, polyurethane or silicone.

== Process steps in a dispensing system ==

[[File:Schema vergussanlage.png|thumb|250px|Schematic illustration of a resin casting system]]
In a dispensing system the following processes have to be performed:
*Conditioning of the resin mix
*Material transportation
*Metering
*Mixing
*Casting

A good resin dispensing system provides high quality casting of the same high standard even during long series in mass production.

== Conditioning ==

Several properties of the resin mix, with or without filler material, one component or two components (resin + hardener), are crucial for the quality of the product:
*Even distribution of the fillers (no settling)
*Elimination of air and moisture
*Constant, often elevated temperature to maintain low viscosity

Even distribution of the fillers without setting is maintained by ongoing stirring.

Air and moisture are eliminated by evacuating the material tanks.

Elevated temperature is reached and maintained by thoroughly controlled heating of the tanks, the material feeding lines, the pumps and metering heads. In filled, complex resin mixes conditioning is especially crucial for the quality of the product.

== Material transportation ==
[[File:Doppelvergussanlage.jpg|thumb|250px|Resin casting unit with two metering units (gear pumps)]]

Which kind of feeding pump has to be used depends mainly on the viscosity of the material and the abrasiveness of the fillers.

For low to medium viscous material:
*[[Piston pump]]s
*Eccentric [[screw pump]]s
*[[Progressive cavity pump]]s
*[[Gear pump]]s

Gear pumps are not fit for abrasive material

For highly viscous material [[follower plate pump]]s are connected with an eccentric screw pump or a scooping piston pump. Metering is controlled for mass, time, and volume to determine the amount of resin dispensed.

=== Metering by mass ===
Weighing provides very exact determination of amount, but it lengthens the cycle time. Also, a scale within a production line can be quite sensitive to malfunction and hard to use on boards populated with many parts. Because of these issues, this method is rarely used.

=== Metering by using Volume ===
[[File:Schnitt dosierkopf.png|thumb|150px|Longitudinal section through a metering head for two components (resin left, hardener right)]]
[[Image:Dosierkopf 1 komponente einfach.png|thumb|150px|left|Metering head for single component (piston metering head)]]

Getting constant volume is, technically, relatively simple and metering systems relying on constant volume dispensing therefore are especially simple and reliable.

A very good way is the use of piston metering heads. The ratio of resin to hardener can be determined exactly by the ratio of the width of two separate pistons, one for resin, one for hardener, where both pistons are pushed simultaneously. The amount is determined by a common stopper, limiting the stroke of both pistons equally.

State of the art (2009) are metering volumes from 0,01 mL to about 250 mL, may be even more.

=== Metering by using time ===
This method demands that the appropriate pumps provide precisely constant flow of the material. Flow of material is started by a controlled valve and stopped after a certain time.

This method is especially susceptible to metering flaws, because the slightest change in flow speed causes different amounts of dispensed resin and/or hardener. Providing for an absolutely constant flow calls for relatively high electronic complexity, but provides much greater flexibility in adjusting the proportions of hardener to resin.

== Mixing ==
In two component resins, thorough mixing is crucial to obtain equal reaction between resin and hardener throughout all the material. There are three possible ways to mix:
*static mixing tube
*dynamic blender
*dynamic static mixing tube

=== Static mixing tube ===
The components meet in a mixing tube made of plastic. The tube contains immobile walls to divide and bring together the material several times, mixing resin and hardener by this process. The mixing tube is not cleaned after use, but discarded.

:'''advantages:''' no [[moving parts]], no cleaning process, no residue of cleaning liquid
:'''disadvantages:''' mixing tubes as litter, intensity of mixing can hardly be varied

=== Dynamic mixing ===
The components meet in a mixing chamber, usually made of stainless steel and there they are mixed homogeneously by a rotating blender. To optimize the mixing effect the rotational speed can be controlled electronically. Mixing chamber and blender have to be cleaned with a special cleaning fluid to be used again. Usually this happens automatically.
:'''advantage:''' the mixing intensity can be controlled exactly.
:'''disadvantages:''' more due to failure because of moving parts, cleaning required, possibly residue of cleaning fluid, used cleaning fluid is waste or even hazardous waste, expensive replacement or cleaning of the chamber in case of encrustation because of hardened resin within the mixing chamber.

=== Static-dynamic mixing ===
A mixing tube made from plastic contains a helix driven by an external motor. This method is rarely used.

== Dispensing ==
To provide for best casting, the part and the dispensing unit have to be moved relatively to each other. In principle there are two ways:
*Movement of the dispensing unit
*Movement of the part

For many applications, dispensing can only be done successfully in vacuum. This is true especially for parts with a large [[undercut (manufacturing)|undercut]], i.e. soaking of transformation coils. In such cases bubble free dispensing can only be obtained in vacuum. For this purpose dispensing systems are equipped with vacuum chambers. To shorten cycle times there can be an airlock at the entrance and one at the exit. In vacuum dispensing only systems where the parts are moving and the dispenser remains in place can be built reasonably.

For the production of series, dispensing systems with multifold metering heads can be used. At this time (2006) there are systems running capable to do up to thirty dispensing acts simultaneously.

=== Variability of dispensing ===
The most simple way of dispensing is, to cast a certain amount of resin into one spot of a not moving part. Such simple systems sometimes are called '''metering systems'''.Centrifugal casting tables are today available. The mold is fixed on this rotary table and while the resin mix is dispensed into the mold, centrifugal force ensures a solid, clean bubble free fill. The part is also stronger due to stress hardening. In some cases, the parts are equal to pressure injection dispensing.

[[File:2 komponenten einfachdosierer auf portal.jpg|thumb|250px|Single metering unit for two components, mounted on portal system to move the metering unit, CNC-controlled]]

By using adequate controls, many variations of the casting process are available. For instance, dams can be cast in different forms. Cast from highly viscous, [[Thixotropy|thixotropic]] material, dams can be filled with resin of low viscosity (dam &amp; fill). The deposition speed of the resin can be varied during casting or casting can be done in several portions. At the same time the part can execute complex movements. Using additional options of that kind make it possible to solve difficult casting problems.

==Implementation of Dispensing into a Production Line==

A casting system can be combined with many different production steps within a production line. So casting becomes an integrated part of the whole manufacturing of a part. To account for the delicate requirements of dispensing in all production steps in the best way, the most significant manufacturers are active in automation as well. The newest development in this area is the design of a production line from prefabricated, ideally adapted modules. This speeds up the development of individual solutions and decreases their costs.

==Examples for Application of Dispensing==

More and more parts are sealed by casting, because this accelerates the production and increases the lifetime and functionality of the parts. On the other side, sealed parts cannot be repaired.

===Sealing of electronic parts===

Electronic units, plugged into a board, usually are sealed by resin to protect them from environmental influences and from mechanical damage. In those cases dispensing usually means just to fill up a form, a relatively simple process.

===Production of LEDs===

[[Light-emitting diode]]s are produced in fully automated lines. Part of it is the dispensing in transparent plastics. Here short working cycles are of great significance to lower the price of the little lights. This an example for the use of multiple metering heads.

===Soaking of electrical windings===

In [[electric motor]]s and in transformers, multiple layers of windings of fine copper wire are essential. Today they usually are soaked in resin to protect them from environmental influences and to improve insulation from each other. Because of the fine structure of the space between the windings and because of much undercut, soaking of such windings puts highest demands to the used dispensing device.

The Rothschild family has frequently been the subject of [[conspiracy theories]], many of which have [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] origins.&lt;ref name=conspiracy1/&gt;

==Overview==
The first member of the family who was known to use the name "Rothschild" was Izaak Elchanan Rothschild, born in 1577. The name is derived from the [[German language|German]] ''zum rothen Schild'' (with the old spelling "th"), meaning "at the red shield", in reference to the house where the family lived for many generations (in those days houses were designated not by numbers but by signs displaying different symbols or colours). A red shield can still be seen at the centre of the Rothschild coat of arms. The family's ascent to international prominence began in 1744, with the birth of [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild]] in [[Frankfurt am Main]], Germany. He was the son of [[Amschel Moses Rothschild]] (born circa 1710),&lt;ref&gt;{{NDB|22|131|133|Rothschild, Mayer Amschel|Pohl, Manfred}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[money changer]] who had traded with the [[House of Hesse|Prince of Hesse]]. Born in the "[[Frankfurter Judengasse|Judengasse]]", the [[ghetto]] of [[Frankfurt]], Mayer developed a finance house and spread his empire by installing each of his five sons in the five main European financial centres to conduct [[business]]. The Rothschild coat of arms contains a clenched fist with five arrows symbolising the five dynasties established by the five sons of Mayer Rothschild, in a reference to [[Psalms|Psalm]] 127: "Like arrows in the hands of a warrior, so are the children of one's youth." The family motto appears below the shield: ''Concordia, Integritas, Industria'' (Unity, Integrity, Industry).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] writes "[T]he Rothschilds are elusive. There is no book about them that is both revealing and accurate. Libraries of nonsense have been written about them... A woman who planned to write a book entitled ''Lies about the Rothschilds'' abandoned it, saying: 'It was relatively easy to spot the lies, but it proved impossible to find out the truth.'" He writes that, unlike the [[court Jew|court factor]]s of earlier centuries, who had financed and managed European noble houses, but often lost their wealth through violence or expropriation, the new kind of international bank created by the Rothschilds was impervious to local attacks. Their assets were held in financial instruments, circulating through the world as stocks, bonds and debts. Changes made by the Rothschilds allowed them to insulate their property from local violence: "Henceforth their real wealth was beyond the reach of the mob, almost beyond the reach of greedy monarchs."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson, ''A History of the Jews'', p.317.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson argued that their fortune was generated to the greatest extent by [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild]] in London; however, more recent research by [[Niall Ferguson]] indicates that greater and equal profits also were realised by the other Rothschild dynasties, including [[James Mayer de Rothschild]] in Paris, [[Carl Mayer von Rothschild]] in Naples and [[Amschel Mayer Rothschild]] in Frankfurt.&lt;ref&gt;''The House of Rothschild (Vol. 2): The World's Banker: 1849–1999'', Niall Ferguson (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another essential part of Mayer Rothschild's strategy for success was to keep control of their banks in family hands, allowing them to maintain full secrecy about the size of their fortunes. In about 1906, the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] noted: "The practice initiated by the Rothschilds of having several brothers of a firm establish branches in the different financial centres was followed by other Jewish financiers, like the [[Bischoffsheim family|Bischoffsheims]], [[Péreire brothers|Pereires]], [[Joseph Seligman|Seligmans]], [[Lazard]]s and others, and these financiers by their integrity and financial skill obtained credit not alone with their Jewish confrères, but with the banking fraternity in general. By this means, Jewish financiers obtained an increasing share of international finance during the middle and last quarter of the 19th century. The head of the whole group was the Rothschild family..." It also states: "Of more recent years, non-Jewish financiers have learned the same cosmopolitan method, and, on the whole, the control is now rather less than more in Jewish hands than formerly."&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia'' c. 1906 [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=142&amp;letter=F&amp;search=Finance Finance]&lt;/ref&gt;
Mayer Rothschild successfully kept the fortune in the family with carefully [[arranged marriage]]s, often between first- or second-[[cousin marriage|cousins]] (similar to [[royal intermarriage]]). By the late 19th century, however, almost all Rothschilds had started to marry outside the family, usually into the aristocracy or other financial dynasties.&lt;ref name="Go Ahead, Kiss Your Cousin"&gt;[http://discovermagazine.com/2003/aug/featkiss Go Ahead, Kiss Your Cousin] by Richard Conniff, From the August 2003 issue, published online 1 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
His sons were:
* [[Amschel Mayer Rothschild]] (1773–1855): [[Frankfurt]], died childless as his fortune passed to the sons of Salomon and Calmann
* [[Salomon Mayer von Rothschild|Salomon Mayer Rothschild]] (1774–1855): [[Vienna]]

The German family name "Rothschild" is pronounced {{IPA-de|ˈʁoːtʃɪlt|}} in [[German language|German]], unlike {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɒ|θ|(|s|)|tʃ|aɪ|l|d}} in [[English language|English]].

The five sons of Mayer Amschel Rothschild were elevated to the [[Austrian nobility]] by Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I of Austria]], and they were all granted the Austrian hereditary title of ''[[Freiherr]]'' ([[baron]]) on 29 September 1822.&lt;ref name="Wurzbach1874" /&gt; The [[Rothschild banking family of England|British branch of the family]] was elevated by [[Queen Victoria]], who granted the hereditary title of [[baronet]] (1847)&lt;ref&gt;''The Genealogy of the Existing British Peerage and Baronetage'', By Edmund Lodge, Hurst and Blackett, 1859, page 808&lt;/ref&gt; and later the [[hereditary peer]]age title of [[Baron Rothschild]] (1885).&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=25486 |date=3 July 1885 |page=3060}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted by ''GreatGameIndia Magazine'' has revealed that the Rothschild family was one of the controller families of the [[East India Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=26 June 2016|title=Controller Houses Of The East India Company: EIC Series Part IV|url=http://greatgameindia.com/controller-houses-east-india-company-eic-series-part-iv/|journal=GreatGameIndia Magazine|series=East India Company Series|issue=Apr-June 2016 Issue|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rothschilds already possessed a significant fortune before the start of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803–1815), and the family had gained preeminence in the [[Precious metal#Bullion|bullion]] trade by this time.&lt;ref name="GrayOxNatBio" /&gt; From London in 1813 to 1815, [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild]] was instrumental in almost single-handedly financing the British war effort, organising the shipment of bullion to the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington's]] armies across Europe, as well as arranging the payment of British financial subsidies to their continental allies. In 1815 alone, the Rothschilds provided £9.8 million (in 1815 currency, about £566 million, €717 million or US$869 million today, when using the retail price index, and £6.58 billion, €8,34 billion or US$10.1 billion when using average earnings) in subsidy loans to [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain's]] continental allies.&lt;ref name="Money 2008 page 78"&gt;''The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World'', (London 2008), page 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rothschild-metternichgasse.jpg|thumb|One of the smaller city houses, Vienna. A collection of far larger Viennese palaces known as [[Palais Rothschild]] were torn down during the Second World War.]]
The brothers helped coordinate Rothschild activities across the continent, and the family developed a network of agents, shippers and couriers to transport gold across war-torn Europe. The family network was also to provide Nathan Rothschild time and again with political and financial information ahead of his peers, giving him an advantage in the markets and rendering the house of Rothschild still more invaluable to the British government.

In one instance, the family network enabled Nathan to receive in London the news of Wellington's victory at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] a full day ahead of the government's official messengers.&lt;ref name="GrayOxNatBio" /&gt; Rothschild's first concern on this occasion was not to the potential financial advantage on the market which the knowledge would have given him; he and his courier immediately took the news to the government.&lt;ref name="GrayOxNatBio"&gt;Victor Gray and Melanie Aspey, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24162 "Rothschild, Nathan Mayer (1777–1836)"], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edition, May 2006. Retrieved 21 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It was then repeated in later popular accounts, such as that of [[Frederic Morton|Morton]].&lt;ref name="Random Variables 1984"&gt;Victor Rothschild – "The Shadow of a Great Man" in ''Random Variables'', Collins, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferguson, Niall 1998"&gt;*Ferguson, Niall. ''The World's Banker: The History of the House of Rothschild.'' Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1998, {{ISBN|0-297-81539-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basis for the Rothschild's most famously profitable move was made after the news of British victory had been made public. Nathan Rothschild calculated that the future reduction in government borrowing brought about by the peace would create a bounce in British government bonds after a two-year stabilisation, which would finalise the post-war restructuring of the domestic economy.&lt;ref name="Money 2008 page 78" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Random Variables 1984" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferguson, Niall 1998" /&gt; In what has been described as one of the most audacious moves in financial history, Nathan immediately bought up the government bond market, for what at the time seemed an excessively high price, before waiting two years, then selling the bonds on the crest of a short bounce in the market in 1817 for a 40% profit. Given the sheer power of leverage the Rothschild family had at their disposal, this profit was an enormous sum.&lt;ref name="Money 2008 page 78" /&gt;

Nathan Mayer Rothschild started his business in [[Manchester]] in 1806 and gradually moved it to [[London]], where in 1809 he acquired the location at 2 New Court in St. Swithin's Lane, [[City of London]],&lt;ref name="GrayOxNatBio" /&gt; where it operates today; he established [[N M Rothschild &amp; Sons]] in 1811. In 1818, he arranged a £5 million (equal to £{{Inflation|UK|5|1818|r=-1}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) loan to the [[Prussia]]n government, and the issuing of [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] for government [[loan]]s formed a mainstay of his bank’s business. He gained a position of such power in the [[City of London]] that by 1825–26 he was able to supply enough coin to the [[Bank of England]] to enable it to avert a [[market liquidity]] crisis.

Rothschild family banking businesses pioneered international high finance during the industrialisation of Europe and were instrumental in supporting railway systems across the world and in complex government financing for projects such as the [[Suez Canal]]. During the 19th century, the family bought up a large proportion of the property in [[Mayfair]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://family.rothschildarchive.org/estates/46-1-seamore-place|title="1, Seamore Place, London, England".

The Rothschild family was directly involved in the [[Independence of Brazil|Independence]] of [[Brazil]] from [[Portugal]] in the early 19th century.

Major 19th-century businesses founded with Rothschild family capital include:
* Alliance Assurance (1824) (now [[Royal &amp; Sun Alliance]]);
* [[Chemin de Fer du Nord]] (1845)
* [[Rio Tinto Group|The Rio Tinto mining company]] (1873) (from the 1880s onwards, the Rothschilds had full control of Rio Tinto)&lt;ref&gt;''The Rio Tinto Company: an economic history of a leading international mining concern'', Charles E. Harvey (1981), page 188&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[De Beers]] (1888)

The family funded [[Cecil Rhodes]] in the creation of the African colony of [[Southern Rhodesia|Rhodesia]]. From the late 1880s onwards, the family took over control of the Rio Tinto mining company.

The name of Rothschild became synonymous with extravagance and great wealth; and, the family was renowned for its art collecting, for its palaces, as well as for its philanthropy. By the end of the century, the family owned, or had built, at the lowest estimates, over 41 palaces, of a scale and luxury perhaps unparalleled even by the richest royal families.&lt;ref name="Money 2008 page 78" /&gt; The British Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Lloyd George]] claimed, in 1909, that [[Nathan Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild|Nathan, Lord Rothschild]] was the most powerful man in Britain.&lt;ref name="Rothschild 1999, page 481-85" /&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;''A History of the Jews'', Paul Johnson (London 2004), page 319–20&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, with no male heir, the Frankfurt House closed its doors after more than a century in business. It was not until 1989 that the family returned, when N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons, the British investment arm, plus Bank Rothschild AG, the Swiss branch, set up a representative banking office in Frankfurt.

[[Hezekiah Niles|Niles']] Weekly Register, Volume 49 had the following to say about the Rothschilds influence on international high finance in 1836;

All of them were granted the Austrian hereditary title of ''[[Freiherr]]'' ([[baron]]) on 29 September 1822.&lt;ref name="Wurzbach1874" /&gt; As such, some members of the family used the [[nobiliary particle]] ''de'' or ''[[von]]'' before their surname to acknowledge the grant of nobility. Traditionally, a baron who received his title from the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], or (after the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806) from the Austrian and later Austro-Hungarian Emperor, was known as a ''Reichsfreiherr'' ("Baron of the Empire"), although the title is usually shortened to ''Freiherr''.

In 1847, [[Sir Anthony de Rothschild, 1st Baronet|Sir Anthony de Rothschild]] was made a hereditary [[baronet]] of the United Kingdom. In 1885, [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild|Nathan Mayer Rothschild II]] was granted the [[hereditary peer]]age title of [[Baron Rothschild]] in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]. This title is currently held by the [[Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild|4th Baron Rothschild]].

== British branch ==
{{Main article|Rothschild banking family of England}}
The Rothschild banking family of the United Kingdom was founded in 1798 by [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild]] (1777–1836), who first settled in [[Manchester]] but then moved to [[London]]. Nathan Mayer von Rothschild, the third son of [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild]] (1744–1812), first established a [[textile]] jobbing business in Manchester and from there went on to establish [[N M Rothschild &amp; Sons]] bank in London.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

During the early part of the 19th century, the Rothschild family's London bank took a leading part in managing and financing the subsidies that the British government transferred to its allies during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Through the creation of a network of agents, couriers and shippers, the bank was able to provide funds to the armies of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] in [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], therefore funding the war. The providing of other innovative and complex financing for government projects formed a mainstay of the bank's business for the better part of the century. N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons' financial strength in the [[City of London]] became such that, by 1825–26, the bank was able to supply enough coin to the [[Bank of England]] to enable it to avert a [[market liquidity|liquidity]] crisis.

Nathan Mayer's eldest son, [[Lionel de Rothschild]] (1808–1879), succeeded him as head of the London branch. Under Lionel, the bank financed the British government's 1875 purchase of [[Egypt]]'s interest in the [[Suez Canal]]. The Rothschild bank also funded [[Cecil Rhodes]] in the development of the [[British South Africa Company]]. [[Leopold de Rothschild]] (1845–1917) administered Rhodes's estate after his death in 1902 and helped to set up the [[Rhodes Scholarship]] scheme at the [[University of Oxford]]. In 1873, [[de Rothschild Frères]] in France and N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons of London joined with other investors to acquire the Spanish government's money-losing [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]] copper mines. The new owners restructured the company and turned it into a profitable business. By 1905, the Rothschild interest in Rio Tinto amounted to more than 30 percent. In 1887, the French and British Rothschild banking houses loaned money to, and invested in, the [[De Beers]] diamond mines in [[South Africa]], becoming its largest shareholders.

The London banking house continued under the management of [[Lionel Nathan de Rothschild]] (1882–1942) and his brother [[Anthony Gustav de Rothschild]] (1887–1961), and then to [[Sir Evelyn de Rothschild]] (b. 1931). In 2003, following Sir Evelyn's retirement as head of N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons of London, the British and French financial firms merged under the leadership of [[David René de Rothschild]].

== French branches ==

There are two branches of the family connected to France.

The first was the branch of [[James Mayer de Rothschild]] (1792–1868), known as "James", who established [[de Rothschild Frères]] in Paris. Following the Napoleonic Wars, he played a major role in financing the construction of railways and the mining business that helped make France an industrial power. By 1980, the Paris business employed about 2,000 people and had an annual turnover of 26&amp;nbsp;billion francs (€4,13 billion or $5 billion in the currency rates of 1980).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1487391620070614 RPT-French banker Guy de Rothschild dies aged 98] Reuters, 14 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baron [[David René de Rothschild|David de Rothschild]], then 39, decided to stay and rebuild, creating a new entity named [[Rothschild &amp; Cie Banque]], with just three employees and €830,000 (USD$1 million) in capital. Today, the Paris operation has 22 partners and accounts for a significant part of the global business.

Ensuing generations of the Paris Rothschild family remained involved in the family business, becoming a major force in international investment banking. The Paris Rothschilds have since led the [[Thomson Financial League Tables]] in Investment Banking Merger and Acquisition deals in the UK, France and Italy.

[[James Mayer de Rothschild]]'s other son, [[Edmond James de Rothschild]] (1845–1934), was very much engaged in philanthropy and the arts, and he was a leading proponent of [[Zionism]]. His grandson, Baron [[Edmond Adolphe de Rothschild]], founded in 1953 the [[LCF Rothschild Group]], a private bank. Since 1997, Baron [[Benjamin de Rothschild]] chairs the group. The group has €100bn of assets in 2008 and owns many wine properties in France ([[Château Clarke]], [[Château des Laurets]]), in Australia or in South Africa. In 1961, the 35-year-old [[Edmond Adolphe de Rothschild]] purchased the company [[Club Med]], after he had visited a resort and enjoyed his stay.&lt;ref name="indobit"&gt;{{cite news

The second French branch was founded by [[Nathaniel de Rothschild]] (1812–1870). Born in London, he was the fourth child of the founder of the British branch of the family, [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild]] (1777–1836). In 1850 Nathaniel Rothschild moved to Paris to work with his uncle James Mayer Rothschild. In 1853 Nathaniel acquired Château Brane Mouton, a vineyard in [[Pauillac]] in the [[Gironde]] ''département''.  Nathaniel Rothschild renamed the estate [[Château Mouton Rothschild]], and it would become one of the best known labels in the world. In 1868, Nathaniel's uncle, James Mayer de Rothschild, acquired the neighbouring [[Château Lafite-Rothschild|Château Lafite]] vineyard.

Czernin Verlag, Vienna. 1999. {{ISBN|3-85485-026-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crash of 1929 brought problems, and [[Louis Nathaniel de Rothschild|Baron Louis von Rothschild]] attempted to shore up the [[Creditanstalt]], Austria's largest bank, to prevent its collapse. Nevertheless, during the [[Second World War]] they had to surrender their bank to the [[Nazis]] and flee the country. Their [[Palais Rothschild|Rothschild palaces]], a collection of vast palaces in Vienna built and owned by the family, were confiscated, plundered and destroyed by the Nazis. The palaces were famous for their sheer size and for their huge collections of paintings, [[armour]], [[tapestries]] and [[statues]] (some of which were restored to the Rothschilds by the Austrian government in 1999). All family members escaped the [[Holocaust]], some of them moving to the [[United States]], and returning to Europe only after the war. In 1999, the government of Austria agreed to return to the Rothschild family some 250 art treasures looted by the Nazis and absorbed into state museums after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{Main article|Rothschild banking family of Naples}}
The C M de Rothschild &amp; Figli bank arranged substantial loans to the [[Papal States]] and to various Kings of Naples plus the Duchy of Parma and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. However, in the 1830s, Naples followed Spain with a gradual shift away from conventional bond issues that began to affect the bank's growth and profitability. The [[Unification of Italy]] in 1861, with the ensuing decline of the Italian aristocracy who had been the Rothschild's primary clients, eventually brought about the closure of their Naples bank, due to a forecasted decline in the sustainability of the business over the long-term. However, in the early 19th century, the Rothschild family of Naples built up close relations with the [[Holy See]], and the association between the family and the Vatican continued into the 20th century.{{fact|date=February 2018}} In 1832, when [[Pope Gregory XVI]] was seen meeting Carl von Rothschild to arrange the [[1832 Rothschild loan to the Holy See]] (for £400,000, worth €43,000,000 in 2014), observers were shocked that Rothschild was not required to kiss the Pope's feet, as was then required for all other visitors to the Pope, including monarchs.&lt;ref&gt;''The reign of the house of Rothschild'', Egon Caesar Corti (Conte), 1928, page 46&lt;/ref&gt; The 1906 ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' described the Rothschilds as "the guardians of the papal treasure".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12909-rothschild "Rothschild"].

== Jewish identity and positions on Zionism ==
Jewish solidarity in the family was not homogeneous. Many Rothschilds were supporters of [[Zionism]], while other members of the family opposed the creation of the Jewish state.  In 1917 [[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild]] was the addressee of the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]] to the [[Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland|Zionist Federation]],&lt;ref&gt;"Balfour Declaration."

Retrieved 12 August 2007, from [http://www.britannica.com/event/Balfour-Declaration Encyclopædia Britannica Online].&lt;/ref&gt; which committed the British government to the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people. His son, [[Victor Rothschild|Victor, Lord Rothschild]] was against granting asylum or helping Jewish refugees in 1938.{{efn|[[The Independent]] reported that he "shocked an audience by saying that in spite of 'the slow murder of 600,000 people' on the continent 'we probably all agree that there is something unsatisfactory in refugees encroaching on the privacy of our country, even for relatively short periods of time.'"}}&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news

Since the late-19th century, the family has taken a low-key public profile, donating many famous estates, as well as vast quantities of art, to charity, and generally eschewing conspicuous displays of wealth. Today, Rothschild businesses are on a smaller scale than they were throughout the 19th century, although they encompass a diverse range of fields, including: real estate, financial services, mixed farming, energy, mining, winemaking and nonprofits.&lt;ref name="The Rothschilds page 11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk" /&gt;

[[File:Chateau Lafite.jpg|thumb|[[Château Lafite Rothschild]], Bordeaux. Alongside [[Château Mouton Rothschild]], it is perhaps the most prestigious of the many Rothschild wine estates]]

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853 [[Nathaniel de Rothschild]] purchased [[Château Brane-Mouton]] and renamed it [[Château Mouton Rothschild]]. In 1868, [[James Mayer de Rothschild]] purchased the neighbouring Château Lafite and renamed it [[Château Lafite Rothschild]].

Today, the Rothschild family owns many wine estates: their estates in France include [[Château Clarke]], Château de Malengin, [[Château Clerc-Milon]], [[Château d'Armailhac]], [[Château Duhart-Milon]], [[Château Lafite Rothschild]], Château de Laversine, [[Château des Laurets]], [[Château L'Évangile]], Château Malmaison, Château de Montvillargenne, [[Château Mouton Rothschild]], [[Château de la Muette]], [[Château Rieussec]] and Château Rothschild d'Armainvilliers. They also own wine estates across North America, South America, South Africa and Australia.

Especially, [[Château Mouton Rothschild]] and [[Château Lafite Rothschild]] are classified as '''Premier Cru Classé'''—i.e., [[First Growth]], the status referring to a classification of wines from the Bordeaux region of France.

=== Art and charity ===
The family once had one of the largest private art collections in the world, and a significant proportion of the art in the world's public museums are Rothschild donations which were sometimes, in the family tradition of discretion, donated anonymously.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rothschilds: Portrait of a Dynasty'', By Frederic Morton, page 11-13&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'': "This multinational banking family is a byword for wealth, power – and discretion... The Rothschild name has become synonymous with money and power to a degree that perhaps no other family has ever matched."&lt;ref&gt;''The Daily Telegraph'' (London), ''The Rothschilds: They prefer to let their money do the talking'', William Langley, 25 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing of the [[Rockefeller family|Rockefeller]] and Rothschild families, [[Harry Mount]] writes: "That is what makes these two dynasties so exceptional – not just their dizzying wealth, but the fact that they have held on to it for so long: and not just the loot, but also their family companies."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/9300205/Rothschild-and-Rockefeller-their-family-fortunes.html Rothschild and Rockefeller: their family fortunes] Harry Mount, 30 May 2012, ''The Daily Telegraph'' (London)&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of the Rothschild family has been featured in a number of films. The 1934 Hollywood film titled ''[[The House of Rothschild]]'', starring [[George Arliss]] and [[Loretta Young]], recounted the life of [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild]] and [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild]] (both played by Arliss). Excerpts from this film were incorporated into the Nazi propaganda film ''[[The Eternal Jew (1940 film)|Der ewige Jude]]'' (''The Eternal Jew'') without the permission of the copyright holder. Another Nazi film, ''Die Rothschilds'' (also called ''Aktien auf Waterloo''), was directed by [[Erich Waschneck]] in 1940. A Broadway musical entitled ''[[The Rothschilds (musical)|The Rothschilds]]'', covering the history of the family up to 1818, was nominated for a [[Tony Award]] in 1971. [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild|Nathaniel Mayer ("Natty") Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild]] appears as a minor character in the historical-mystery novel ''[[Stone's Fall]]'', by [[Iain Pears]]. Mayer Rothschild is featured in [[Diana Gabaldon]]'s novel ''[[Voyager (novel)|Voyager]]'' as a coin seller summoned to Le Havre by Jamie Fraser to appraise coins, prior to the establishment of the Rothschild dynasty, when Mayer is in his early 20s. The Rothschild name is mentioned by [[Aldous Huxley]] in his novel ''[[Brave New World]]'', among many names of historically affluent persons, scientific innovators and others. The character, named Morgana Rothschild, played a relatively minor role in the story. The name Rothschild used as a synonym for extreme wealth inspired the song "[[If I Were a Rich Man (song)|If I Were a Rich Man]]", which is based on a song from the [[Tevye]] the Dairyman stories, written in the [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] as ''Ven ikh bin Rotshild'', meaning "If I were a Rothschild".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lyricsmania.com/tradition_lyrics_fiddler_on_the_roof.html|title=Fiddler On The Roof - Tradition Lyrics|website=www.lyricsmania.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the word "Rothschild" was throughout the 19th and 20th centuries a synonym for seemingly endless wealth, neo-Gothic styles, and epicurean glamour.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rothschilds: Portrait of a Dynasty'', By Frederic Morton (1998), page 5&lt;/ref&gt; The family also has lent its name to "{{visible anchor|le [[goût Rothschild]]}}," a suffocatingly glamorous style of interior decoration whose elements include neo-Renaissance palaces, extravagant use of velvet and gilding, vast collections of armour and sculpture, a sense of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[horror vacui]], and the highest masterworks of art. Le goût Rothschild has much influenced designers such as [[Robert Denning]], [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Vincent Fourcade]] and others.

Discussing this and similar views, the historian [[Niall Ferguson]] wrote, {{quote|Without wars, nineteenth-century states would have little need to issue bonds. As we have seen, however, wars tended to hit the price of existing bonds by increasing the risk that a debtor state would fail to meet its interest payments in the event of defeat and losses of territory. By the middle of the 19th century, the Rothschilds had evolved from traders into fund managers, carefully tending to their own vast portfolio of government bonds. Now having made their money, they stood to lose more than they gained from conflict. [...] The Rothschilds had decided the outcome of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] by putting their financial weight behind Britain. Now they would [...] sit on the sidelines.&lt;ref name="Money 2008 page 91"&gt;''The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World'', (London 2008), page 91.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Before being hacked in June 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kick|first=Russ|title=Both my WP sites - Memory Hole and Books Are People Too - have been hacked, turned into attack sites.|url=https://twitter.com/russkick/status/1994403951|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=29 November 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uapAZIoM?url=http://twitter.com/russkick/status/1994403951|archivedate=29 November 2010|date=1 June 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the site was devoted to preserving and publishing material that is in danger of being lost, is hard to find, or is not widely known. Topics include government files, corporate memos, court documents, police reports and eyewitness statements, Congressional testimony, reports from various sources, maps, patents, web pages, photographs, video, sound recordings, news articles, and books. The name is a tribute to the "[[memory hole]]" from [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', a slot into which government officials deposit politically inconvenient documents and records for destruction.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;

One of the most noticeable actions was the publication of several hundred photos depicting the coffins of U.S. soldiers fallen in [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. These were obtained by Kick by filing a request based on the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]]. The photos sparked a controversy regarding the publication of war photos, public opinion and the behavior of the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07EFDA123AF937A15757C0A9629C8B63 |title=  Photos of Soldiers' Coffins Spark a Debate Over Access |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2008-05-06 | first1=Thom | last1=Shanker | first2=Bill | last2=Carter | date=2004-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website is the 2005 winner of the [[Project on Government Oversight]]'s "Beyond the Headlines" Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pogo.org/honorees/beyond-the-headlines/| publisher=[[Project On Government Oversight]]| title= Beyond the Headlines Award Project On Government Oversight|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A successor website, The Memory Hole 2, was launched by Kick on June 16, 2016.

[[Malay titles|Datuk]] '''Vinod Balachandra Sekhar''' is the President and Group Chief Executive of Petra Group, a Malaysian company that focuses on [[rubber recycling]], [[biotechnology]] and financial software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leadership Summit Asia 2008|url=http://www.insead.edu/events/leadershipsummitasia2008/speakers/sekhar.cfm|publisher=Insead}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the chairman of the Sekhar Foundation, based in [[Kuala Lumpur]] and the CEO of Green Rubber. He was named by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine as Malaysia's 28th richest man for 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaysia's Richest No. 28 Vinod Sekhar|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2009/84/malaysia-09_Vinod-Sekhar_TL7H.html|work=Forbes.com|accessdate=27 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;Nevertheless, there were complaints filed against him, leading to lawsuits.

The title of Dato' was given to Sekhar at the early age of 26 by [[Yang di Pertuan Besar]] of Negeri Sembilan, Tuanku Ja'afar Ibni Almarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman on his 71st birthday, who was at that time the 10th Yang di Pertuan Agong of Malaysia. He was the youngest person to be conferred a Dato'ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cinderella Man|url=http://themalaysiamovement.com/images/Cinderella_Man.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal and Family Life==
Sekhar is the youngest son of Sukumari Nair and [[B.C. Sekhar]], also known as Mr. Natural Rubber, who for a time provided significant inputs in the global [[natural rubber]] industry. He has three siblings. He is married to Winy Sekhar with whom he has two daughters, Petra and Tara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaysian Rubber Industry Pioneer B.C. Sekhar Dies|url=http://news.oneindia.in/2006/09/07/malaysian-rubber-industry-pioneer-b-c-sekhar-dies-1157610620.html|publisher=One India News|accessdate=7 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from managing his businesses, Sekhar takes time to write literary contents. He has written numerous plays and even produced a book of poetry. "In the Mind's Eye", one of the plays that he has written was a success and was well received when it was produced in the United States, United Kingdom and in his homeland, [[Malaysia]]. Dato Vinod paid for it to be produced.

Moreover, he became the host of the first English talk show on television in Malaysia.

He also enjoys playing golf with a 22 handicap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roop|first=Sharma|title=Vinod Sekhar : Malaysia's most prominent businessmen, philanthropists|url=http://www.nriinternet.com/NRIentrepreneurs/ASIA/Malaysia/A_Z/Vinod_Sekhar/Forbes_Malaysia_40richest_2007%20.htm|publisher=NRI Internet|accessdate=30 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career life==
While he attended [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaysian work experience offer for six pupils|url=http://haileybury.com/news/archive/Default.asp?id=266&amp;offset=400|publisher=Haileybury and Imperial Service College|accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and writes broadly – for instance&lt;ref&gt;"Malaysia in the Asian Century: The Challenges we all face", in: [[Frank-Jürgen Richter]] and Thang D. Nguyen: ''The Malaysian Journey'', Marshall Cavendish 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; he started a non-partisan multiracial youth organisation, Malaysiana Muda. He remained president of one of the largest multiracial youth organisations in Malaysia at that time for two terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vinod Sekhar|url=http://greenleaderssummit.com/vinod-sekhar|publisher=Green Leaders Summit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sekhar was only 21 when he started his business career with just US$50 when he put up his own clothing company called Vincent Siefer Clothing Company that sold college embossed shirts to university students in different American universities. He later then sold his clothing company for US$5 million.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

In 1990, Sekhar formed Sekhar Tunku Imran (STI) Group together with his friend, Tunku Tan Sri Imran and penetrated various business ventures. Some of the most notable business deals that STI had was when it had a joint venture with [[Disney-MGM Studios]] in Florida, USA to produce the movie entitled Tarzan, The Epic Adventure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roop|first=Sharma|title=Vinod Sekhar : Malaysia's most prominent businessmen, philanthropists|url=http://www.nriinternet.com/NRIentrepreneurs/ASIA/Malaysia/A_Z/Vinod_Sekhar/Forbes_Malaysia_40richest_2007%20.htm|publisher=NRI Internet|accessdate=30 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, STI teamed up with various business partners both in the local and international scene that in 1997, the Petra Group was born.

The Petra Group is a privately held company that is well known for Green Rubber Global – the company's key business which is a cost-effective process that can efficiently recycle used rubber.

Sekhar is also an active supporter of different socio-civic organisations. He founded the Sekhar Foundation which owns 60% of The Petra Group and acts as the philanthropic arm of the company by supporting various charitable organisations worldwide. The Sekhar Foundation has donated to a range of organisations that are working in the fields of education, poverty alleviation, and healthcare provision. The Foundation is also the main sponsor for South East Asia's largest rain forest research programme in the Danum Valley in [[Borneo]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insead.edu/events/leadershipsummitasia2008/speakers/sekhar.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University Council Members: Dato Vinod Sekhar|url=http://www.limkokwing.net/university_guidance/council/datuk_vinod_sekhar/|publisher=Limkokwing University of Creative Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Green Rubber Global ===

Green Rubber Global (GRG) is a part of Sekhar's Petra Group. A recycling plant is being built near Gallup, New Mexico in USA to pave way to Green Rubber production. Aside from that, GRG is planning to expand and build more recycling plants in US, [[Mexico]] and Asia to increase production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaysian rubber recycler expands into USA|url=http://www.recyclinginternational.com/recycling-news/5170/other-news/archiv/malaysian-rubber-recycler-expands-usa|publisher=Recycling International|accessdate=1 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recycling plant will make use of the process that Sekhar's father has developed called De-Link to create "green rubbers". The De-Link process will devulcanise old and used tyres then revulcanise them and convert them into different new rubber products such as vehicle tyres and footwear soles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matthew|first=Phan|title=Watch 'green rubber' bounce back to life soon|url=http://www.wildsingapore.com/news/20070910/070912-5.htm|publisher=Wild Singapore|accessdate=12 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GRG has famous supporters and shareholders like Hollywood celebrities [[Mel Gibson]] and [[Bruce Willis]] and ''Forbes'' magazine publisher, [[Steve Forbes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mel Gibson-backed firm Green Rubber eyes London IPO|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/09/11/rubber-ipo-mel-gibson-idUSL1184655720070911|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=11 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Bruce Willis then sued the company to recoup US$900,000 (RM3.1mil) of the US$2mil he invested.In his complaint filed in the federal court in Los Angeles, Willis said Petra chief executive officer Datuk Vinod B. Sekhar and Tunku Imran induced him to invest in this company &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bruce Willis sues Petra and Tunku Imran|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2008/11/22/bruce-willis-sues-petra-and-tunku-imran|publisher=The Star Newspaper|accessdate=23 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disputes==
=== Declared bankruptcy in 2005 and Insolvency Dept bid against Vinod Sekhar in 2010 ===

In June 2005, the Kuala Lumpur High Court declared Sekhar a bankrupt due to failure of settling his debts to Orix Credit Malaysia Sdn Bhd and 11 other companies that totals RM 12.376 million.According to the application that the director-general of the Insolvency Department has submitted to KL's High Court, Sekhar committed two offences when he was still in directorship of 25 companies and flew out of the country without gaining permission from the Director-General of Insolvency, under Section 38 of the Bankruptcy Act 1967.However, in March 2011, Sekhar's attorney successfully proved to the court that the adjudication and receiving order documents pertaining to the bankruptcy were never served on his client and that the signatures appearing on those documents were forged. Because of that, the application to put Sekhar to jail was dismissed by High Court Senior Assistant Registrar Rozianti Mohamed Hanaphi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vinod Sekhar won't respond to allegations company|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2010/09/04/vinod-sekhar-wont-respond-to-allegations/|publisher=The Star Newspaper|accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== The filing of Lawsuit by Bruce Willis in 2008 ===

Hollywood actor Bruce Willis filed a lawsuit against Vinod Sekhar and Malaysian Prince Imran Ibni Tuanku Ja'afar last November 2008 when the actor wanted to get his $2 million investment but only received $1.1 million.[18]The actor sued Sekhar and Ja'afar for the remaining $900, 000 of his total investment immediately after learning that the plan to launch green rubber was put on hold because of the weakening global economy. In his complaint filed in the federal court in Los Angeles on 22 November 2008, Willis said Petra chief executive officer Datuk Vinod B. Sekhar and Tunku Imran induced him to invest in a company that was developing a non-toxic and recyclable rubber in 2007, according to a Bloomberg report. Willis was told that former US Vice-President Al Gore and actor Mel Gibson had also invested in the company.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bruce Willis sues Petra and Tunku Imran|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2008/11/22/bruce-willis-sues-petra-and-tunku-imran|publisher=The Star Newspaper|accessdate=23 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute was then resolved. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bruce Willis settles dispute with Malaysia company|url=http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2008Nov26/0,4675,PeopleBruceWillis,00.html|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=28 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
