[[File:GEM corn.jpg|thumb|right|Unusual strains of [[maize]] are collected to increase the [[crop diversity]] when selectively breeding domestic corn.]]

'''Agricultural biodiversity''' is a sub-set of general [[biodiversity]]. The [[Convention on Biological Diversity|Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)]] defines it as

''Agricultural biodiversity is a broad term that includes all components of biological diversity of relevance to food and agriculture, and all components of biological diversity that constitute the agricultural ecosystems, also named agro-ecosystems: the variety and variability of animals, plants and micro-organisms, at the genetic, species and ecosystem levels, which are necessary to sustain key functions of the agro-ecosystem, its structure and processes'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbd.int/decision/cop/default.shtml?id=7147|title=CBD / COP 5 Decision V/5|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It includes all forms of life directly relevant to [[agriculture]]: rare [[seed]] varieties and [[animal breed]]s (farm biodiversity), but also many other organisms such as [[soil fauna]], [[Weed|weeds]], pests, predators, and all of the native plants and animals (wild biodiversity) existing on and flowing through the farm.  It also includes diversity of ecosystems.  Agricultural biodiversity is essential to cope with the predicted impacts of [[climate change]], not simply as a source of traits but as the underpinnings of more resilient farm ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frison | first1 = E.A. | last2 = Cherfas | first2 = J. | last3 = Hodgkin | first3 = T. | year = 2011 | title = Agricultural Biodiversity Is Essential for a Sustainable Improvement in Food and Nutrition Security | url = http://www.bioversityinternational.org/e-library/publications/detail/agricultural-biodiversity-is-essential-for-a-sustainable-improvement-in-food-and-nutrition-security | journal = Sustainability | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 238–253 | doi=10.3390/su3010238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural biodiversity is the basis of our agricultural [[food chain]], developed and safeguarded by farmers, livestock breeders, forest workers, fishermen and indigenous peoples throughout the world.  The use of agricultural biodiversity (as opposed to non diverse production methods) can contribute to [[food security]], nutrition security and livelihood security.

==Scope==
Although the term ''agricultural biodiversity'' is relatively new - it has come into wide use in recent years as evidenced by bibliographic references - the concept itself is quite old. It is the result of the careful [[Selection (biology)|selection]] and inventive developments of farmers, herders and fishers over millennia. Agricultural biodiversity is a vital sub-set of [[biodiversity]]. It is a use of life, i.e. ancillary biotechnologies, by Mankind whose food and livelihood security depend on the sustained management of those diverse biological resources that are important for food and [[agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;FAO, (1996). Global Plan of Action for the Conservation and Sustainable Utilization of Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, {{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/ag/AGP/AGPS/GpaEN/gpatoc.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920040427/http://www.fao.org/ag/AGP/AGPS/GpaEN/gpatoc.htm |archivedate=2008-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As for everything, agricultural biodiversity can be used, not used, misused and even abused. Agricultural biodiversity includes:

*Domesticated [[agriculture|crop]] and 'wild' [[plant]]s (called: [[crop wild relative]]s), including woody perennials (see: [[forest genetic resources]]) and [[aquatic plant]]s (used for food and other natural resources based products), domestic and wild [[animal]]s (used for food, fibre, milk, hides, furs, power, organic fertilizer), fish and other aquatic animals, within field, [[forest]], [[rangeland]] and aquatic ecosystems
*Domesticated livestock species and their wild relatives
*Non-harvested species within production [[agroecosystem]]s that support food provision, including soil micro-biota, [[pollinator]]s and so on
*Non-harvested species in the wider environment that support food production [[agroecosystem]]s (agricultural, pastoral, forest and aquatic ecosystems)

However, agricultural biodiversity, sometimes called Agrobiodiversity, "''encompasses the variety and variability of animals, plants and [[microorganism|micro-organisms]] which are necessary to sustain key functions of the agroecosystem, its structure and processes for, and in support of, food production and [[food security]]''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/sd/EPdirect/EPre0080.htm FAO : SD Dimensions : Environment : Environmental conventions and agreements&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041213233609/http://www.fao.org/sd/EPdirect/EPre0080.htm |date=December 13, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It further "''comprises genetic, population, species, community, ecosystem, and landscape components and human interactions with all these.''"&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, L., Bawa, K.,
Pascual, U., and Perrings, C. (2005).agroBIODIVERSITY: A new science agenda for biodiversity in support of sustainable agroecosystems. DIVERSITAS Report N°4. 40 pp. {{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, most attention in this field is given to crop varieties and to crop wild relatives. Cultivated varieties can be broadly classified into “modern varieties” and “farmer's or traditional varieties”. Modern varieties are the outcome of formal breeding and are often characterized as '[[High-yielding variety|high yielding]]'. For example, the short straw wheat and rice varieties of the [[Green Revolution]]. In contrast, farmer's varieties (also known as [[landrace]]s) are the product of (breeding and) selection carried out by farmers. Together, these varieties represent high levels of genetic diversity and are therefore the focus of most crop genetic resources conservation efforts.

Aquatic diversity is also an important component of agricultural biodiversity. The [[conservation biology|conservation]] and [[sustainable]] use of local aquatic ecosystems, ponds, rivers, coastal commons by artisanal fisherfolk and smallholder farmers is important to the survival of both humans and the environment. Since aquatic organisms, including fish, provide much of our food supply as well as underpinning the income of coastal peoples, it is critical that fisherfolk and smallholder farmers have genetic reserves and sustainable ecosystems to draw upon as [[aquaculture]] and marine fisheries management continue to evolve.

==Genetic erosion in agricultural and livestock biodiversity==

[[Genetic erosion]] in [[agricultural]] and [[livestock]] biodiversity is the loss of genetic diversity, including the loss of individual genes, and the loss of particular combinations of genes (or gene complexes) such as those manifested in locally adapted [[landraces]] or breeds. The term genetic erosion is sometimes used in a narrow sense, such as for the loss of alleles or genes, as well as more broadly, referring to the loss of varieties or even species. The major driving forces behind genetic erosion in crops are: variety replacement, land clearing, [[overexploitation]] of species, population pressure, [[environmental degradation]], [[overgrazing]], policy and changing agricultural systems.&lt;ref&gt;FAO, (1997). The State of the World's Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, {{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/WAICENT/FAOINFO/AGRICULT/AGP/AGPS/Pgrfa/pdf/swrfull.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027225556/http://www.fao.org/WAICENT/FaoInfo/Agricult/AGP/AGPS/pgrfa/pdf/SWRFULL.PDF |archivedate=2006-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main factor, however, is the replacement of local varieties by high yielding or exotic varieties or species. A large number of varieties can also often be dramatically reduced when commercial varieties (including [[Genetically Modified Organism|GMO]]s) are introduced into traditional farming systems. Many researchers believe that the main problem related to agro-ecosystem management is the general tendency towards genetic and ecological uniformity imposed by the development of modern agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gao | first1 = L.Z. | year = 2003 | title = The conservation of rice biodiversity in China: significance, genetic erosion, ethnobotany and prospect | url = | journal = Genetic Resources and Crop Evolution | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 17–32 | doi=10.1023/a:1022933230689}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guarino, L., (1995). Assessing the threat of genetic erosion. In: Collecting Plant Genetic Diversity: Technical Guidelines (eds. Guarino L, Rao VR, Reid R) pp. 67-74. CAB International, Wallingford.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pressures for that ecological uniformity on farmers and breeders is caused by the food industry demand for more and more raw materials consistency.

In the case of [[Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture]], major causes of genetic erosion are reported to include indiscriminate cross-breeding, increased use of exotic breeds, weak policies and institutions in animal genetic resources management, neglect of certain breeds because of a lack of profitability or competitiveness,  the intensification of production systems, the effects of diseases and disease management, loss of pastures or other elements of the production environment, and poor control of inbreeding.&lt;ref&gt;FAO. 2015. The Second Report on the State of the World's Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic vulnerability==
In [[plant breeding]], a population of plants is considered genetically vulnerable if there is little 
genetic diversity within the population, and this lack of diversity makes the population as a whole particularly vulnerable to disease, pests, or other factors. The problem of genetic vulnerability often arises with modern crop varieties, which are uniform by design.&lt;ref&gt;Virchow, Detlef. ''Conservation of genetic resources: Costs and implications for a sustainable utilization of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture'' Springer, 1999. p22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plantbreeding.coe.uga.edu/index.php?title=7._Genetic_Resources_and_Genetic_Diversity|title=Genetic Resources and Genetic Diversity |author =Eric Elsner |accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the consequences of genetic vulnerability occurred in 1970 when [[Southern corn leaf blight|corn blight]] struck the US corn belt, destroying 15% of the harvest. A particular plant cell characteristic known as Texas male sterile cytoplasm conferred vulnerability to the blight - a subsequent study by the National Academy of Sciences found that 90% of American maize plants carried this trait.&lt;ref&gt;Kloppenburg, Jack Ralph Jr. "First the Seed: The political economy of plant biotechnology, 2nd edition" University of Wisconsin Press 2004. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

==Change in agricultural biodiversity in human diets==
Since 1961, human diets across the world have become more diverse in the consumption of major commodity staple crops, with a corollary decline in consumption of local or regionally important crops, and thus have become more homogeneous globally.&lt;ref name=Khoury&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Khoury, C.K. |author2=Bjorkman, A.D. |author3=Dempewolf, H. |author4=Ramirez-Villegas, J. |author5=Guarino, L. |author6=Jarvis, A. |author7=Rieseberg, L.H. |author8=Struik, P.C. |title=Increasing homogeneity in global food supplies and the implications for food security |journal=PNAS |date=2014 |volume=111 |issue=11 |pages=4001–4006 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1313490111 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1313490111 |pmid=24591623 |pmc=3964121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The differences between the foods eaten in different countries were reduced by 68% between 1961 and 2009. The modern "global standard"&lt;ref name=Khoury/&gt; diet contains an increasingly large percentage of a relatively small number of major staple commodity crops, which have increased substantially in the share of the total food energy (calories), protein, fat, and food weight that they provide to the world's human population, including [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[sugar]], [[maize]], [[soybean]] (by +284%&lt;ref name=Kinver/&gt;), [[palm oil]] (by +173%&lt;ref name=Kinver/&gt;), and [[sunflower]] (by +246%&lt;ref name=Kinver/&gt;). Whereas nations used to consume greater proportions of locally or regionally important crops, wheat has become a staple in over 97% of countries, with the other global staples showing similar dominance worldwide. Other crops have declined sharply over the same period, including [[rye]], [[yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[sweet potato]] (by -45%&lt;ref name=Kinver/&gt;), [[cassava]] (by -38%&lt;ref name=Kinver/&gt;), [[coconut]], [[sorghum]] (by -52%&lt;ref name=Kinver/&gt;) and [[millet]]s (by -45%&lt;ref name=Kinver/&gt;).&lt;ref name=Khoury/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kinver&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kinver |first1=Mark |title=Crop diversity decline 'threatens food security' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26382067|publisher=BBC |accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SciAm&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fischetti |first1=Mark |title=Diets around the world are becoming more similar |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/diets-around-the-world-are-becoming-more-similar/|publisher=Scientific American |accessdate=13 June 2016 |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human dependency==
Agricultural biodiversity is not only the result of human activity but human life is dependent on it not just for the immediate provision of food and other natural resources based goods, but for the maintenance of areas of land and waters that will sustain production and maintain agroecosystems and the wider biological and environmental services ([[biosphere]]).

Agricultural Biodiversity provides:

* [[Sustainable production]] of food and other agricultural products emphasising both strengthening [[sustainability]] in production systems at all levels of intensity and improving the conservation, sustainable use and enhancement of the diversity of all genetic resources for food and agriculture, especially plant and animal genetic resources, in all types of production systems &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thrupp | first1 = L. A. | year = 2000 | title = Linking agricultural biodiversity and food security: the valuable role of agrobiodiversity for sustainable agriculture | url = http://users.unimi.it/agroecol/pdf/coop_int/bocchi/linking_agricultural_biodiversity.pdf | format = PDF | journal = International Affairs | volume = 76 | issue = 2| pages = 265–281 | doi = 10.1111/1468-2346.00133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Biological or life support to production emphasising conservation, sustainable use and enhancement of the biological resources that support sustainable production systems, particularly [[soil biota]], [[pollinator]]s and predators
* Ecological and [[social services]] provided by agro-ecosystems such as landscape and [[wildlife protection]], [[soil protection]] and health (fertility, structure and function), [[water cycle]] and [[water quality]], [[air quality]], [[carbon sequestration|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sequestration]], etc.

Research supporting these findings addresses multifunctional agriculture in Europe, home gardens from around the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galluzi |first1=G. |last2=Eyzaguirre |first2=P. |last3=Negri |first3=V. |year=2010 |title=Home gardens: neglected hotspots of agro-biodiversity and cultural diversity |url=http://www.bioversityinternational.org/fileadmin/bioversityDocs/Announcements/Home_Gardens/Home_gardens_review_paper.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Biodiversity and Conservation |volume=19 |issue= |pages=3635–3654 | doi = 10.1007/s10531-010-9919-5 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; smallholder farms in the tropics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kull | first1 = C.

==Comparisons of Cropping Systems==
The general trend noticed by the analysis of biodiversity present in different cropping systems (e.g., [[industrial agriculture]] and [[organic farming]]) was that a greater the diversity of crops (temporally and spacially) resulted in a greater overall biodiversity of the [[agroecosystem]], though this is not always the case. A meta-analysis of studies comparing biodiversity noted that, when compared to organic cropping systems, conventional systems had significantly lower species richness and abundance (30% greater richness and 50% greater abundance in organic systems, on average), though 16% of studies did find a greater level of species richness in conventional systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bengtsoon | first1 = J. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2005 | title = The effects of organic agriculture on biodiversity and abundance: a metaanalysis | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01005.x | journal = Journal of Applied Ecology | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 261–269 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that cropping systems that required heavy use of chemical amendments (e.g., the widespread broadcasting of pesticides and [[glyphosate]], a practice ubiquitously found throughout the United States and Canada) had significantly greater levels of pollination deficits, whereas organic fields of the same crop (Canola) witnessed no pollination deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morandin | first1 = Lora A. | last2 = Winston | first2 = Mark L. | year = 2005 | title = WILD BEE ABUNDANCE AND SEED PRODUCTION IN CONVENTIONAL, ORGANIC, AND GENETICALLY MODIFIED CANOLA | url = | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 871–881 | doi=10.1890/03-5271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cropping systems like [[permaculture]] have undergone little study to determine relative levels of biodiversity compared to other cropping systems, but because they continue to reinforce the goals of increasing overall crop [[biodiversity]], it can be extrapolated that an even greater level of biodiversity would be observed.

==Agroecosystems vs natural ecosystems==
Agricultural biodiversity has spatial, temporal and scale dimensions especially at agroecosystem levels. These [[agroecosystem]]s - ecosystems that are used for agriculture - are determined by three sets of factors: the genetic resources ([[biodiversity]]), the physical [[natural environment|environment]] and the human management practices. There are not many ecosystems in the world that are "natural" in the sense of having escaped human influence. Most ecosystems have been to some extent modified or cultivated by human activity for the production of food and income and for livelihood security. However, most agricultural areas can be returned to their [[natural landscape]] after subsequent generations.

[[File:Frederic, Lord Leighton - Perseus and Andromeda - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Perseus and Andromeda'' (Andromeda tied to the rock while [[Perseus]] on the winged horse Pegasus flies above), by [[Frederic Leighton]]]]

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Andromeda''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|n|ˈ|d|r|ɒ|m|ɪ|d|ə}}; [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Ἀνδρομέδα, ''Androméda'' or Ἀνδρομέδη, ''Andromédē'') is the daughter of the [[Aethiopia]]n king [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia|Cepheus]] and his wife [[Cassiopeia (Queen of Ethiopia)|Cassiopeia]]. When Cassiopeia's [[hubris]] leads her to boast that Andromeda is more beautiful than the [[Nereids]], [[Poseidon]] sends the [[sea monster]] [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]] to ravage Andromeda as divine punishment.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in Classical Mythology'', Michael Grant &amp; John Hazel, Oxford University Press, 1973, 1993, p. 31, {{ISBN|0-19-521030-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Andromeda is chained to a rock as a sacrifice to sate the monster, but is saved from death by [[Perseus]].

Her name is the [[Latin language|Latinized]] form of the Greek {{lang|grc|Ἀνδρομέδα}} (''Androméda'') or {{lang|grc|Ἀνδρομέδη}} (''Andromédē''): "ruler of men",&lt;ref&gt;The traditional [[etymology]] of the name is, "she who has bravery in her mind"&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἀνήρ|ἀνήρ]], ἀνδρός}} (''anēr, andrós'') "man", and ''medon'', "ruler".

As a subject, Andromeda has been popular in art since classical times; it is one of several Greek myths of a [[Greek hero]]'s rescue of the intended victim of an archaic ''[[hieros gamos]]'' (sacred marriage), giving rise to the "[[princess and dragon]]" [[Motif (narrative)|motif]]. From the [[Renaissance]], interest revived in the original story, typically as derived from [[Ovid]]'s account.

==Mythology==
[[Image:Museo Nazionale Napoli Perseus And Andromeda.jpg|left|thumb|A small Roman fresco from [[Pompeii]]]]

In Greek mythology, Andromeda was the daughter of Cepheus and Cassiopeia, king and queen of the African kingdom of [[Aethiopia (Classical Greek term)|Aethiopia]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}}

Her mother Cassiopeia boasted that her daughter was more beautiful than the [[Nereids]], the [[nymph]]-daughters of the sea god [[Nereus]] and often seen accompanying [[Poseidon]]. To punish the queen for her arrogance, Poseidon, brother to [[Zeus]] and god of the sea, sent a sea monster named [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]] to ravage the coast of Aethiopia including the kingdom of the vain queen. The desperate king consulted the [[Oracle]] of Apollo, who announced that no respite would be found until the king sacrificed his daughter, Andromeda, to the monster. Stripped naked, she was chained to a rock on the coast.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}}

[[Perseus]] was returning from having slain the [[Gorgon]], [[Medusa]]. After he happened upon the chained Andromeda, he approached Cetus while invisible (for he was wearing [[Cap of invisibility#Origins|Hades's helm]]), and killed the sea monster. He set Andromeda free, and married her in spite of her having been previously promised to her uncle [[Phineus (son of Belus)|Phineus]]. At the wedding a quarrel took place between the rivals, and Phineus was turned to stone by the sight of the Gorgon's head.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' v. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Andromeda followed her husband, first to his native island of [[Serifos]], where he rescued his mother [[Danaë]], and then to [[Tiryns]] in [[Argos]]. Together, they became the ancestors of the family of the ''Perseidae'' through the line of their son Perses. Perseus and Andromeda had seven sons: [[Perses (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Perses]], [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]], [[Heleus]], [[Mestor]], [[Sthenelus (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Sthenelus]], [[Electryon]], and [[Cynurus]] as well as two daughters, [[Autochthe]] and [[Gorgophone (Perseid)|Gorgophone]]. Their descendants ruled Mycenae from [[Electryon]] down to [[Eurystheus]], after whom [[Atreus]] attained the kingdom, and would also include the great hero [[Heracles]]. According to this mythology, Perseus is the ancestor of the [[Persian people|Persians]].

At the port city of [[Jaffa]] (today part of [[Tel Aviv]]) an outcrop of rocks near the harbour has been associated with the place of Andromeda's chaining and rescue by the traveler [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], the geographer [[Strabo]] and the historian of the Jews [[Josephus]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias iv.35.9; Strabo xvi.2.28; Josephus, ''Jewish War'' iii.9.3&lt;/ref&gt;

After Andromeda's death, as [[Euripides]] had promised [[Athena]] at the end of his ''[[Andromeda (play)|Andromeda]]'', produced in 412 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Kerenyi]], ''The Heroes of the Greeks'' 1959:53; Euripides' drama is lost, save some fragments.&lt;/ref&gt; the goddess placed her among the [[constellation]]s in the northern sky, near Perseus and [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]]; the [[Andromeda (constellation)|constellation Andromeda]], so known since antiquity, is named after her.

== Black Andromeda ==
Andromeda was the daughter of the king and queen of Aethiopia (Αἰθιοπία) modern day [[Ethiopia]] ; Aethiopia roughly translates to "country of burnt faces", so we can conclude Andromeda was black. Prof. Elizabeth McGrath discusses this idea in her 1992 article ''The Black Andromeda'' &lt;ref&gt; Elizabeth McGrath, The Black Andromeda, Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, Vol. 55 (1992), pp. 1-18&lt;/ref&gt; based on Ovid's writings:

1. In his first work, the [[Heroides]] or Epistulae Heroidum (Epistles of the Heroines), [[Ovid]] uses the Latin word “fusca” to describe Andromeda, and “fusca” means “black or brown,” 

2. Also in ''[[Heroides]]'' he has [[Sappho|Sapho]] explain to [[Phaon]]: “though I’m not pure white, Cepheus’s dark/Andromeda/charmed Perseus with her native colour./White doves often choose mates of different hue/and the parrot loves the black turtle dove.”

3. In ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'' (The Art of Love), [[Ovid]] makes the following references to the daughter of the king and queen of [[Ethiopia]]:

a. That Perseus found her among “the black Indians” 

b. That in terms of attraction, “Nor was Andromeda’s colour any problem/to her wing-footed aerial lover” 

c. That when it came to fashion, “White suits dark girls; you looked so attractive in/white/Andromeda”

[[Henry Louis Gates Jr]] wrote about the black Andromeda in a 2014 article &lt;ref name = The Black Andromeda &gt;[https://www.theroot.com/was-andromeda-black-1790874592 "Henry Louis Gates Jr on ''Was Andromeda Black?''"], The Root.&lt;/ref&gt; for [[The Root]] magazine. In his article Gates points out the inaccuracies seen in the film [[Clash of the Titans (franchise)|Clash of the Titans]]. The original, the remake and the sequel all have Andromeda cast as a white women, when [[Ovid]] describes her as black and both her parents were black. In his book ''Amazing Fact About the Negro'' &lt;ref&gt;Gates, L.H., ''100 Amazing Facts About the Negro'', New York, Pantheon, 2017, isbn=9780307908711&lt;/ref&gt; Gates has at No 68: ''What was the original colour of the mythical beauty Andromeda - and why does it matter?'' The book is his homage to [[Joel Rogers]] ''100 Amazing Facts About The Negro With Complete Proof''.

===Constellations===
[[Image:1869 Edward Poynter - Andromeda.jpg|thumb|200px|''Andromeda'' (1869) [[Edward Poynter]]]]
Andromeda is represented in the northern sky by the [[constellation]] [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]], which contains the [[Andromeda Galaxy]].

The advancement of science and technology allowed the emergence of astrophotography which allowed more concrete observation of the Andromeda constellation and led to the discovery that the galaxy lies within the Andromeda constellation.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, David A. The Andromeda Galaxy and the Rise of Modern Astronomy. New York, NY: Springer, 2012. Astronomers' Universe. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Four constellations are associated with the myth. Viewing the fainter stars visible to the naked eye, the constellations are rendered as:
* A huge man wearing a [[Crown (headgear)|crown]], upside down with respect to the [[ecliptic]] (the constellation [[Cepheus (constellation)|Cepheus]])
* A smaller figure, next to the man, sitting on a chair; as it is near the [[Polaris|pole star]], it may be seen by observers in the Northern Hemisphere through the whole year, although sometimes upside down (the constellation [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]])
* A maiden, chained up, facing or turning away from the ecliptic (the constellation [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]]), next to [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]]
* A [[whale]] just under the ecliptic (the constellation [[Cetus]])

Other constellations related to the story are:
* [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]]
* The constellation [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]], who was born from the stump of [[Medusa]]'s neck, after Perseus had decapitated her
* The constellation [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]], which may have been treated as two fish caught by [[Dictys]] the [[fisherman]] who was brother of [[Polydectes]], king of [[Seriphos]], the place where Perseus and his mother [[Danaë]] were stranded

===In art===
[[File:1596 dArpino Perseus and Andromeda anagoria.JPG|thumb|right|Cesari: ''Perseus saving Andromeda'', 1596, [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]]]
[[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]] (and in more modern times, [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]]) made the story the subject of [[tragedies]], and its incidents were represented in numerous ancient works of art,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} including Greek vases. [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]'s opera, ''[[Persée]]'', also dramatizes the myth.

Andromeda has been the subject of numerous ancient and modern works of art, which typically show the moment of rescue, with Andromeda usually still chained, and often naked or nearly so. Examples include: one of [[Titian]]'s ''poesies'' ([[Wallace Collection]]), and compositions by [[Joachim Wtewael]] ([[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]]), [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] (Rennes), [[Perseus and Andromeda (Rubens)|many versions by Rubens]], [[Ingres]], and [[Gustave Moreau]]. From the [[Renaissance]] onward the chained nude figure of Andromeda typically was the centre of interest.  [[Rembrandt]]'s ''[[Andromeda Chained to the Rocks]]'' is unusual in showing her alone, fearfully awaiting the monster.

{{Quote box |width=300px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right
 |quote =&lt;poem&gt;
If by dull rhymes our English must be chain’d,
 And, like Andromeda, the Sonnet sweet
 Fetter’d, in spite of pained loveliness;
 Let us find out, if we must be constrain’d,
 Sandals more interwoven and complete
 To fit the naked foot of poesy;
 Let us inspect the lyre, and weigh the stress
 Of every chord, and see what may be gain’d
 By ear industrious, and attention meet:
 Misers of sound and syllable, no less
 Than Midas of his coinage, let us be
 Jealous of dead leaves in the bay wreath crown;
 So, if we may not let the Muse be free,
 She will be bound with garlands of her own.
&lt;/poem&gt; |source ="If by Dull Rhymes Our English Must Be Chain'd" &lt;br&gt; [[John Keats]] (1795–1821)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/173739|title=If by Dull Rhymes Our English Must Be Chain'd|publisher=Poetry Foundation |accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Italian composer [[Salvatore Sciarrino]] composed an hour-long operatic drama called ''Perseo e Andromeda'' in 2000.

===In films===
* In 1973, an animated film called ''Perseus'' (20 minutes) was made in the [[Soviet Union]] as part of the Soviet animated film collection called ''Legends and Mуths of Ancient Greece''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animator.ru/db/?p=show_film&amp;fid=2626|title=тПУУЙКУЛБС БОЙНБГЙС Ч ВХЛЧБИ Й ЖЙЗХТБИ - жЙМШНЩ - "ретуек"|work=animator.ru|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/315858/|title=КиноПоиск.ru - Все фильмы планеты|work=kinopoisk.ru|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1981 film ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'' retells the story of Perseus, Andromeda, and Cassiopeia, but makes a few changes (notably Cassiopeia boasts that her daughter is more beautiful than [[Thetis]] as opposed to the Nereids as a group). Thetis was indeed a Nereid and also the future mother of [[Achilles]]. Andromeda and Perseus meet and fall in love after he saves her soul from the enslavement of Thetis' son, Calibos, whereas in the myth, they simply meet as Perseus returns home from having slain [[Medusa]]. In the film, the monster is called a [[kraken]], although it is depicted as a lizard-like creature rather than a squid; and combining two elements of the myth, Perseus defeats the sea monster by showing it Medusa's face, turning the monster into stone. Andromeda is depicted as being strong-willed and independent, whereas in the stories she is only really mentioned as being the princess whom Perseus saves from the sea monster. Andromeda was portrayed by [[Judi Bowker]] in this film.
* Andromeda also features in the 2010 film ''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'', a remake of the 1981 version. Several changes were made in regard to the myth, most notably that Perseus did not marry Andromeda after he rescued her from the sea monster. Andromeda was portrayed by [[Alexa Davalos]]. The character was played by [[Rosamund Pike]] in the sequel ''[[Wrath of the Titans]]'', the second of a planned [[Clash of the Titans (franchise)|trilogy]]. In the end of the sequel, Perseus and Andromeda begin a relationship.
* In the Japanese anime ''[[Saint Seiya]]'' the character, [[Andromeda Shun|Shun]], represents the [[Andromeda constellation]] using chains as his main weapons, reminiscent of Andromeda being chained before she was saved by Perseus. In order to attain the Andromeda Cloth, he was chained between two large pillars of rock and he had to overcome the chains before the tide came in and killed him, also reminiscent of this myth.
* Andromeda appears in [[Disney]]'s ''[[Hercules: The Animated Series]]'' as a new student of "Prometheus Academy" which Hercules and other characters from Greek mythology attend.

===In novels===
* In [[Rick Riordan]]'s ''[[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians]]'' series, there are a few references to Andromeda. The most obvious is that the series' lead villains have a [[cruise ship]] which serves as their headquarters and is called ''The Princess Andromeda''.
* Andromeda is the main character in [[Harry Turtledove]]'s short story "Miss Manners' Guide to Greek Missology", published in [[Esther Friesner]]'s ''Chicks in Chainmail'' series of humorous feminist fantasy collections, and reprinted in other anthologies afterwards. It is a satire filled with role reversals, puns, and deliberate anachronisms relating to pop culture.
* Andromeda is Anna's full name in [[Jodi Picoult]]'s ''[[My Sister's Keeper (novel)|My Sister's Keeper]]'', which was turned into a movie in 2010. In the novel there are several references to mythology, as Anna's dad Brian is an astronomer in his free time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7181">The '''Austrian Studies Association''' or '''ASA''' (formerly the Modern Austrian Literature and Culture Association or MALCA, with its journal ''Modern Austrian Literature'') continues traditions started in 1961 (originally the International [[Arthur Schnitzler]] Research Association), as the only North American association devoted to scholarship on all aspects of [[Austria]]n and Austrian-associated cultural life and history from the eighteenth century to the present.

The Association publishes a quarterly scholarly journal, the ''Journal of Austrian Studies'' and holds an international annual spring conference, organized around a theme with open sessions. Its other activities include organizing scholarly panels for the annual conventions of the [[Modern Language Association]], the [[German Studies Association]], and at other national and international conferences. Current news and resources of interest are included on its website and distributed through its list-serv and on its [[Facebook]] page.

== Recent history ==
From 1971 through 1999, prior to its incarnation as the Modern Austrian Literature and Culture Association in 2000, the journal ''Modern Austrian Literature'' hosted annual conferences at the [[University of California, Riverside]] (UCR) under the auspices of editor and UCR German Studies professor/chair [[Donald G. Daviau]] and secretary-treasurer Jorun Johns ([[California State University, San Bernardino]]), publisher of [[Ariadne Press]], the California-based scholarly publication house for Austrian critical studies and works in translation. The ASA originated in a referendum held in early 2011, when MALCA's membership voted to change the Association's name and to retitle its journal as the ''Journal of Austrian Studies''. These changes acknowledge what has long been the Association's identity: an interdisciplinary organization that welcomes all eras and disciplines of Austrian studies at its conferences and in its journal, including scholarship on the cultures of Austria's earlier political forms ([[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Austrian Empire]], and [[Austria-Hungary]]) and scholarship that acknowledges this region's historical multi-ethnic, multilingual, and transcultural identities and their legacies in the present. {{as of|2010|January|1}}, the ASA/MALCA also assumed the role heretofore played by the American [[Grillparzer]] Society as liaison to the Austrian Grillparzer Gesellschaft, located in [[Vienna]] and the sponsor of conferences and a yearbook. The revision of the association and its publication was initiated by former Presidents David Luft ([[Oregon State University]]) (2010–12) and [[Robert Dassanowsky]] ([[University of Colorado, Colorado Springs]]) (2012–14). The current President of the ASA (2018–20) is Gregor Thuswaldner ([[North Park University]]), Business and Information Manager is Katherine Arens ([[University of Texas, Austin]]).

== Honorary Members==
{{as of|2014}}, the ASA has granted honorary membership to the following prominent Austrian artistic and cultural figures as well as museum directors: [[Ruth Beckermann]], [[Valie Export]], [[Lilian Faschinger]], [[Paul Harather]], [[Josef Haslinger]], [[Peter Henisch]], [[Agnes Husslein-Arco]], [[Elfriede Jelinek]], [[Barbara Neuwirth]], [[Hans Raimund]], [[Goetz Spielmann]], [[Peter Rosei]], [[Peter Tscherkassky]], [[Matti Bunzl]], [[Michael Loebenstein]], [[Christoph Thun-Hohenstein]].

== Recent Conferences==
MALCA/ASA conferences have been held at the following venues since the turn of century: 1999 and 2001: [[Lafayette College]], Easton, PA; 2002: [[University of Pennsylvania]], Philadelphia, PA; 2004: [[Rice University]], Houston, TX; 2005: [[University of Montana, Missoula]], MT; 2006: [[Wake Forest University]], Winston-Salem, NC; 2007: [[University of Alberta, Edmonton]], [[Canada]]; 2008: [[University of Washington, Seattle]], WA; 2009: [[Emory University]], Atlanta, GA; 2010: [[University of Vienna]], [[Austria]]; 2011: [[Washington &amp; Jefferson College]], Washington, PA; 2012: [[California State University, Long Beach]], CA; 2013: [[University of Waterloo]], [[Canada]]; 2014: AT&amp;T Conference Center and [[University of Texas, Austin]], TX; 2015: [[University of Michigan, Dearborn]], MI; 2016: [[University of Vienna]]/Elfriede Jelinek Research Center, [[Vienna]], Austria; 2017: [[University of Illinois at Chicago]]; 2018: [[University of Vermont]], Burlington, VT; 2019: [[Bowling Green State University]], Ohio.

The Jutta Landa Travel Fund (named after Austrian scholar Jutta Landa McLaughlin, 1945-2003, [[University of California, Los Angeles]]) and the [[Austrian Cultural Forum New York]] supports graduate students who are presenting papers at the Association's annual symposium by assisting with travel costs.

== ''Journal of Austrian Studies'' ==
The ''Journal of Austrian Studies'', produced and distributed by the [[University of Nebraska Press]] is an interdisciplinary quarterly that publishes scholarly articles and book reviews on all aspects of the history and culture of Austria and the former [[Habsburg]] territories. It is the flagship publication of the Austrian Studies Association and contains contributions in German and English from the world's premiere scholars in the field of Austrian studies. The journal highlights scholarly work that draws on innovative methodologies and new ways of viewing Austrian history and culture. Although the journal was renamed in 2012 to reflect the increasing scope and diversity of its scholarship, it has a long lineage dating back over a half century as ''Modern Austrian Literature'' and, prior to that, ''The Journal of the International Arthur Schnitzler Research Association''. {{as of|2012}}, its editors are Todd Herzog ([[University of Cincinnati]]) and Hillary Hope Herzog ([[University of Kentucky]]); book review editor is Joseph W. Moser ([[West Chester University]]), and the editorial board includes prominent Austrianists and Germanists from the U.S., UK, Canada, Austria, and Germany representing a variety of area studies. The [[Max Kade]] Foundation funds an annual Max Kade Prize for Best Article published in the journal, awarded at the conference of the ASA. The winner of the $1500 award is identified from among the articles published in the journal that year, based on a poll of the editorial board.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26679">In recent years, the use of biologically inspired methods such as the [[evolutionary algorithm]] have been increasingly employed to solve and analyze complex computational problems. '''BELBIC''' (Brain Emotional Learning Based Intelligent Controller) is one such [[Controller (control theory)|controller]] which is proposed by [[Caro Lucas]], Danial Shahmirzadi and Nima Sheikholeslami and adopts the network model developed by [[Jan Morén|Moren]] and [[Balkenius]] to mimic those parts of the brain which are known to produce emotion (namely, the [[amygdala]], [[orbitofrontal cortex]], [[thalamus]] and sensory input cortex).&lt;ref name="Lucas"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Lucas | first1 = C. | last2 = Shahmirzadi | first2 = D. | last3 = Sheikholeslami | first3 = N.| year = 2004 | title = Introducing BELBIC: Brain Emotional Learning Based Intelligent Controller | journal = Intelligent Automation and Soft Computing | volume = 10| pages = 11–22 | doi=10.1080/10798587.2004.10642862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emotions and learning ==

Traditionally, the study of learning in biological systems was conducted at the expense of overlooking its lesser known counterparts: [[motivation]] and [[emotion]]. However these phenomena can not be separated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = LeDoux | first = J. E. | editor = Gazzaniga, M. S | title = The Cognitive Neurosciences | year = 1995 | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum | location = Hillsdale, NJ  | pages = 1049–1061 | chapter = In Search of an Emotional System in the Brain: Leaping from Fear to Emotion and Consciousness}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivation is the drive that causes any system to do anything – without it, there is no reason to act. Emotions indicate how successful a course of actions have been and whether another set of actions should have been taken instead – they are a constant feedback to the learning system. Learning on the other hand, guarantees that motivation and emotional subsystems are able to adapt to constantly changing conditions.&lt;ref name = "LeDoux"&gt;{{Citation | author = LeDoux, J.E. | year = 1996 | title = The Emotional Brain| publisher = Simon and Schuster, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, in the study of biological organisms, emotions have arisen to prominence as an integral part of any biologically inspired system. But how does any living organism benefit from its emotions? It is crucial to answer this question as we attempt to increasingly employ biologically inspired methods in solving computational problems.

Every creature has innate abilities that accommodate its survival in the world. It can identify food, shelter, partners, and danger. But these "simple mappings between stimuli and reactions will not be enough to keep the organisms from encountering problems."&lt;ref name = "Moren"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Moren |first=Jan |title= Thesis: Emotion and Learning | publisher= Lund University |year= 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a given animal knows that its predator has qualities A, B and C, it will escape ''all'' creatures that have those qualities. And thus waste much of its energy and resources on non-existent danger.

We can not expect evolution to provide more advanced algorithms for assessing danger, because the predator is also evolving at the same speed. Thus, biological systems need to be equipped with the ability to learn. This learning and re-learning mechanism allows them to adapt to highly complex and advanced situations.&lt;ref name = "LeDoux" /&gt;

[[Image:LearningOrganism.JPG|frame|right|A Learning Organism]]To learn effectively, every learning organism needs an evaluation of the current situation and also feedback on how beneficial the results of learning were.&lt;ref name = "Moren" /&gt; On the most part, these evaluation mechanisms are built-in. And so we encounter a new problem: whereas creatures take appropriate measures in real time based on their evaluations, these built-in evaluation procedures are developed in evolutionary time. But all creatures need to learn of new evaluation techniques in their lifetime just as they learn the proper reactions.

This is where the ability to condition emotional reactions comes into play. Biological organisms associate innate emotional stimuli with other stimuli they encounter in the world and thus give them an emotional significance when needed.&lt;ref name = "Moren" /&gt; These evaluations can be monitored to operate at very specific times, specific places or when accompanied by other specific stimuli.

There is another reason why these observations are so significant and that is the creation of artificial systems. These systems do not evolve over time but are designed with certain abilities from the start. Thus, their adaptability must be built-in.

==Computational model==

[[Image:Brain limbicsystem.jpg|frame|right |The Brain Limbic System]]
[[Image:Amyg.png|frame|right |The Amygdala in the Human Brain]]

A [[Scientific modelling|model]] is a simplified description of a phenomenon. It brings to life some aspects of this phenomenon while overlooking others. What aspects are kept in the model and what are overlooked greatly depends on the topic of study. Thus, the nature of a model depends on the purpose the investigator plans to carry out. A computational model is one which can be mathematically analyzed, tested and simulated using computer systems.&lt;ref name = "Moren" /&gt;

To construct a computational model of emotional learning in the brain requires a thorough analysis of the [[amygdala]]  and the [[orbitofrontal cortex]] and the interaction between them:&lt;ref name = "MB"&gt;{{Citation | first = J. | last = Moren | author2 = Balkenius, C. | title = A Computational Model of Emotional Learning in the Amygdala | conference = Proc. 6th International Conference on the Simulation of Adaptive Behavior, Cambridge, Mass. | publisher = MIT Press | year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mammals, emotional responses are processed in a part of the brain called the [[limbic system]] which lies in the [[cerebral cortex]]. The main components of the limbic system are the [[amygdala]], [[orbitofrontal cortex]], [[thalamus]] and the sensory cortex.

The amygdala is an almond shaped area which is placed such that it can communicate with all other cortices within the limbic system. The primary affective conditioning of the system occurs within the amygdala. That is, the association between a stimulus and its emotional consequence takes place in this region.&lt;ref name = "Moren" /&gt;

It has been suggested that learning takes place in two fundamental steps.&lt;ref name = "Mower"&gt;{{Citation | last = Mower | first = O. H. | title = Learning Theory and Behavior | publisher = Wiley | origyear = 1960| year = 1973 | location = New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; First, a particular stimulus is correlated with an emotional response. This stimulus can be an endless number of phenomena from observing a face, to detecting a scent, hearing a noise, etc. Second, this emotional consequence shapes an association between the stimulus and the response.&lt;ref name = "Mower" /&gt; This analysis is quite influential in part because it was one of the first to suggest that emotions play a key part in learning.&lt;ref name = "MB" /&gt; In more recent studies, it has been shown that the association between a stimulus and its emotional consequence take place in the amygdala.&lt;ref name = "LeDoux" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rolls"&gt;{{Citation | last = Rolls | first = E. T. | editor = Gazzaniga, M. S. | title = The Cognitive Neurosciences | year = 1995 | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum | location = Hillsdale, NJ  | pages = 127–155 | chapter = A theory of Emotion and Consciousness, and its Application to Understanding the Neural Basis of Emotion}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In this region, highly analyzed stimulus representations in the cortex are associated with an emotional value. Therefore, emotions are properties of stimuli".&lt;ref name = "MB" /&gt;

The task of the amygdala is thus to assign a primary emotional value to each stimulus that has been paired with a primary reinforcer&lt;ref name = "Rolls" /&gt; – the reinforcer is the reward and punishment that the mammal receives. This task is aided by the orbitofrontal complex. "In terms of learning theory, the amygdala appears to handle the presentation of primary reinforcement, while the orbitofrontal cortex is involved in the detection of omission of reinforcement."&lt;ref name = "MB" /&gt;

The first thing we notice in the computational model developed by [[Jan Morén|Moren]] and [[Balkenius]] is that quite a number of interacting learning systems exist in the brain that deal with emotional learning. The computational model is presented below where:

* '''''Th''''' : Thalamus
* '''''CX''''' : Sensory Cortex
* '''''A'''''  : Input structures in the amygdala
* '''''E'''''  : Output structures in the amygdala
* '''''O'''''  : Orbitofrontal Cortex
* '''''Rew/Pun''''' : External signals identifying the presentation of reward and punishment
* '''''CR/UR'''''   : conditioned response/unconditioned response
* '''''V'''''  : Associative strength from cortical representation to the amygdala that is changed by learning
* '''''W'''''  : Inhibitory connection from orbitofrontal cortex to the amygdala that is changed during learning

&lt;Center&gt;
[[Image:Computational Model of Emotional Learning2.JPG]]
&lt;/Center&gt;

This image shows that the sensory input enters through the thalamus '''''TH'''''. In biological systems, the thalamus takes on the task of initiating the process of a response to stimuli. It does so by passing the signal to the amygdala and the sensory cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kelly | first = J. P. | title = The Neural Basis of Perception and Movement, Principles of Neural Science | publisher =  Prentice Hall | year = 1991 | location = London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This signal is then analyzed in the cortical area – '''''CX'''''. In biological systems, the sensory cortex operates by distributing the incoming signals appropriately between the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex.&lt;ref name = "Dan"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shahmirzadi, D. | title = Thesis: Computational Modeling of the Brain Limbic System and its Application in Control Engineering | publisher = Texas A &amp; M University | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sensory representation in '''''CX''''' is then sent to the amygdala '''''A''''', through the pathway '''''V'''''.

This is the main pathway for learning in this model. Reward and punishment enter the amygdala to strengthen the connection between the amygdala and the pathway. At a later stage if a similar representation is activated in the cortex, '''''E''''' becomes activated and produces an emotional response.

'''''O''''', the orbitofrontal cortex, operates based on the difference between the ''perceived'' (i.e. expected) reward/punishment and the actual ''received'' reward/punishment. This perceived reward/punishment is the one that has been developed in the brain over time using learning mechanisms and it reaches the orbitofrontal cortex via the sensory cortex and the amygdala. The received reward/punishment on the other hand, comes courtesy of the outside world and is the ''actual'' reward/punishment that the specie has just obtained. If these two are identical, the output is the same as always through '''''E'''''. If not, the orbitofronal cortex inhibits and restrains emotional response to make way for further learning. So the path '''''W''''' is only activated in such conditions.

== Controller ==

In most industrial processes that contain complex nonlinearities, control [[algorithms]] are used to create [[Linearization|linearized]] models.&lt;ref name = "Rouhani"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Rouhani | first1 = H. | last2 = Jalili | first2 = M. | last3 = Araabi | first3 = B. N. | last4 = Eppler | first4 = W. | last5 = Lucas | first5 = C. | year = 2006 | title = Brain Emotional Learning Based Intelligent Controller Applied to Neurofuzzy Model of Micro-Heat Exchanger | journal = Expert Systems with Applications | volume = 32 | pages = 911–918 | doi = 10.1016/j.eswa.2006.01.047 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason is that these linear models are developed using straightforward methods from process test data.

However, if the process is highly complex and nonlinear, subject to frequent disturbances, a nonlinear model will be required.&lt;ref name = "Rouhani" /&gt; Biologically motivated intelligent controllers have been increasingly employed in these situations. Amongst them, [[fuzzy logic]], [[neural networks]] and [[genetic algorithms]] are some of the most widely employed tools in control applications with highly complex, nonlinear settings.&lt;ref name = "Mehr"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Mehrabian | first1 = A. R. | last2 = Lucas | first2 = C. | year = 2007 | title = Intelligent Adaptive Control of Non-Linear Systems Based on Emotional Learning Approach | journal = International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–85 | doi = 10.1142/S0218213007003205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mehr2" /&gt;

BELBIC is one such nonlinear [[Controller (control theory)|controller]] – a [[neuromorphic]] controller based on the computational learning model shown [[:Image:Computational Model of Emotional Learning2.JPG|above]] to produce the control action. This model is employed much like an algorithm in these control engineering applications. In these new approaches, intelligence is not ''given'' to the system from the outside but is actually acquired by the system itself.&lt;ref name = "Lucas" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rouhani" /&gt;

This simple model has been employed as a [[feedback]] [[Controller (control theory)|controller]] to be applied to control design problems. One logic behind this use in control engineering is a belief held by many experts in the field that there has been too much focus on fully rational deliberative approaches, whereas in many real-world circumstances, we are only provided with a bounded rationality. Factors like computational complexity, multiplicity of objectives and prevalence of uncertainty lead to a desire to obtain more ad-hoc, rule-of-thumb approaches. Emotional decision making is highly capable of addressing these issues because it is neither fully cognitive nor fully behavioral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Mehrabian | first1 = A. R. | last2 = Lucas | first2 = C. | last3 = Roshanian | first3 = J. | year = 2006 | title = Aerospace Launch Vehicle Control: An Intelligent Adaptive Approach | journal = Aerospace Science and Technology | volume = 10 | pages = 149–155 | doi = 10.1016/j.ast.2005.11.002 | issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BELBIC, which is a model free controller, suffers from the same drawback of all intelligent model free controllers: it cannot be applied on unstable systems or systems with unstable equilibrium point. This is a natural result of the trial and error manner of the learning procedure, i.e. exploration for finding the appropriate control signals can lead to instability.&lt;ref name="Roshtkhari2010"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Javan Roshtkhari| first1 = M. | last2 = Arami | first2 = A. | last3 = Lucas | first3 = C. | year = 2010 | title = Imitative Learning Based Emotional Controller for Unknown Systems with Unstable Equilibrium | journal = International Journal of Intelligent Computing and Cybernetics | volume = 2 | pages = 334–359 | url=http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~javan/Imitative%20learning%20based%20emotional%20controller%20for%20unknown%20systems%20with%20unstable%20equilibrium.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Roshtkhari2009"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Javan Roshtkhari| first1 = M. | last2 = Arami | first2 = A. | last3 = Lucas | first3 = C. | year = 2009 | title = Emotional Control of Inverted Pendulum System, A soft switching from Imitative to emotional learning | conference= The 4th International Conference on Autonomous Robots and Agents (ICARA 09) | pages = 651–656}}&lt;/ref&gt; By integrating [[imitative learning]] and [[Fuzzy logic|fuzzy inference systems]], BELBIC is generalized in order to be capable of controlling unstable systems.&lt;ref name = "Roshtkhari2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Roshtkhari2009" /&gt;

'''Center of Excellence in Molecular Biology (CEMB)''' is a highly distinguished biological research institute in [[Asia]], located on the West Bank of the picturesque Canal Road [[Lahore]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]]. It is an autonomous organization that is under administrative control of [[University of the Punjab]], Lahore, Pakistan.

==History==
On 1 November 1981, University of the Punjab announced the "birth" of the Centre.  In April, 1983 the Federal Government allocated a sum of 1.635 million rupees to create a nucleus laboratory of the Centre.  In November, 1985 the proposal to establish the Centre for Advanced Molecular Biology (CAMB) was approved at a cost of 24.55 million rupees.  In 1986, the CAMB project was upgraded into a Centre of Excellence in Molecular Biology (CEMB) and the cost of setting it up was subsequently revised in January 1991, to 44.33 million rupees.  In April 1987, the Federal Ministry of Science &amp; Technology (MOST) approved the establishment of a Centre for Applied Molecular Biology (CAMB), located back to back with the laboratory block of the Centre of Excellence in Molecular Biology (CEMB).
The CEMB established nucleus laboratories in March, 1985 in two student laboratories of the Department of Zoology, University of the Punjab, Quaid-e-Azam Campus, Lahore.  Construction work on the CEMB building started in 1987 on a site located in Lahore's southern suburb of Thokar Niaz Baig along the Canal.  The scientific staff moved into the new building in late 1992-93.

==Admission process==

The Centre offers [[Master of Science|M.Phil]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[Molecular Biology]]. Annually, only 20-30 position for academically brilliant students with research aptitude, from all over the world, are available for M.Phil and Ph.D. The admission process is one of the toughest and highly competitive in [[Pakistan]] with admission rate of around 10% annually. A greater number of foreign scholars are also pursuing their M.Phil and Ph.D in the centre.

==Research groups==

CEMB has the following research groups:

#Applied and Functional Genomics
#Bioinformatics
#Congenital Mental Retardation
#Crop Breeding and GMO Detection Group
#Development of Recombinant Biopharmaceuticals
#Forensic Research Lab
#Forensic Services Lab
#Hearing Impairment
#Medical Genetics Group
#Molecular Medicine
#Molecular Virology and Molecular diagnostics
#Plant Biosafety,
#Plant Genomics,
#Plant Transformation
#Seed Biotechnology
#Stem Cell Research
#Vision Impairment

==Achievements==
CEMB researchers have made a great contribution to Molecular Biology. Recently, CEMB has made Bt transgenic rice, Bt transgenic cotton and virus-free gladiolus, potato and tomato. Several kits are made for the PCR-based diagnosis of HCV and HBV . A total of 11 new deafness loci, 3 vision impairment loci and 17 new genes are discovered here. All these results have been published in the form of research papers in more than 100 international journals of high reputation including Nature, American Journal of Human Genetics, European Journal of Human Genetics, Molecular Vision, Virology Journal, Infectious Diseases, PLoS, Differentiation, Forensic Science International and International Journal of Legal Medicine. Besides, CEMB holds the rights to 7 patents for inventions made by its scientists. In recognition of these achievements, Islamic Development Bank conferred it with Science and Technology Prize in 2008.

==International collaborations==
As research in general and molecular biology in particular is an expensive business to do, CEMB often has collaborations with many national and international research institutes. These include National Institute of Health (NIH) USA, University of Cincinnati, University of Washington, University of Arizona, Johns-Hopkins University, Brigham Young University and US Department of Agriculture.

==Local collaborations==
CEMB also has linkages with local institutes like Quaid-e-Azam University Islamabad, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, University of Lahore, Lahore College for Women University, Forman Christian University Lahore, Comsats Islamabad, Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan, Bahauddin Zakariya University Multan, Government College University Lahore, Government College University Faisalabad, Baluchistan University of Information Technology, Engineering and Management Sciences, Quetta, Sheikh Zayed Hospital Lahore, University of Health Sciences Lahore, Jinnah Hospital Lahore, King Edwards Medical University Lahore and Allama Iqbal Medical College Lahore.

==CEMB and CAMB==

CEMB is under the administrative control of the Ministry of Education (MOE) and CAMB is under the administrative control of the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST). Although, both are independent and autonomous, CEMB is the academic and basic research wing while CAMB is the applied and commercial production wing.

'''Civil-military operations''' or '''CMO''' are activities of a military force to minimize civil interference on and maximize civil support for [[military operation]]s.  CMO is conducted in conjunction with combat operations during wartime and becomes a central part of a military campaign in [[Counter-insurgency|counter-insurgencies]].  Some militaries have specialized units dedicated to conduct CMO, such as [[Civil Affairs|civil affairs]] forces or form task forces specifically for this purposes, such as a [[joint civil-military operations task force]] in the U.S. Military.  Also, some militaries have staff sections dedicated to planning and coordinating CMO for their command.  CMO is often called [[Civil-Military Co-operation|civil-military co-operation]] or CIMIC in [[NATO]] operations and [[Civil-military coordination|civil-military co-ordination]] in [[United Nations|UN]] operations.
==Official definitions==
The [[Canadian Forces|Canadian Military]] defines CMO as:

{{quote|Military activities associated with an operation that ensure that military commanders comprehend, make use of and mitigate any negative impact of the civil environment on military operations and plans.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Department of National Defence, Canadian Force Operations, National Defence Pub B-GJ-005-300/FP-000 (Ottawa: DND, August 15, 2005), p. 19-2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Military of the United States|U.S. Military]] defines CMO as:

{{quote|The activities of a commander that establish, maintain, influence, or exploit relations between military forces, governmental and nongovernmental civilian organizations and authorities, and the civilian populace in a friendly, neutral, or hostile operational area in order to facilitate military operations, to consolidate and achieve operational US objectives. Civil-military operations may include performance by military forces of activities and functions normally the responsibility of the local, regional, or national government. These activities may occur prior to, during, or subsequent to other military actions. They may also occur, if directed, in the absence of other military operations. Civil-military operations may be performed by designated civil affairs, by other military forces, or by a combination of civil affairs and other forces.&lt;ref&gt;Chairman, U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Civil-Military Operations, Joint Publication (JP) 3-57 (Washington, DC: CJCS, July 08, 2008), p. GL-6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Computational informatics''' is a subfield of [[informatics]] that emphasizes issues in the design of computing solutions rather than its underlying infrastructure. Computational informatics can also be interpreted as the use of computational methods in the information sciences.

== Development ==
From a historical viewpoint, medical informatics scientists (also known as medical informaticians) started to use artificial intelligence and [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] statistical methods in [[diagnosis]] and medical decision making, as early as in the 1970s.  An example is the [[MYCIN]] system developed at [[Stanford University]].  The field has since evolved to use a wide range of computational methods and to interact with all possible scientific and other disciplinary domains.  Later, the field integrated the following:

* Computational techniques: [[artificial intelligence]], [[algorithm]]s (for architectures ranging from single [[Central Processing Unit|CPU]] to [[massively parallel]] machines), programming, [[object-oriented]] system design, [[database]]s, information retrieval, computer graphics and visualization, [[data mining]], information extraction.
* [[Probability]], [[statistics]] and decision science: Theory of probability, statistical inference, cost/risk-benefit analysis, probabilistic analysis, stochastic modeling, decision theory, statistical data analysis, probabilistic networks, pattern classification, statistical learning and modeling, statistical data mining.
* Applied [[mathematics]]: [[graph theory]], [[differential equation]]s, [[optimization theory]], [[wavelet]]s, [[group theory]].
* [[Electrical engineering]] methods: signal and image processing.
* [[Domain knowledge]]: [[art]] and cultural heritage, [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]], the [[World Wide Web]].
* User sciences: design, human-computer interaction, evaluation.
* Cyberinfrastructure for informatics: [[search engine]]s, digital repositories, storage.
* [[Scientometrics]], [[bibliometrics]] and [[economics]]: science and policy evaluation, data mining and information extraction, knowledge discovery.
* Social sciences: [[social network]] analysis and metrics.

== Education ==
Several universities offer graduate programs in this area.  One example is the [[Penn State College of Information Sciences and Technology]].  Another example is the [[Hamburg University of Technology]] which offers a consecutive Bachelor and Master program with emphasis on computational techniques. Some programs are targeted at specific domains.  For instance, the Biomedical Informatics Program at [[Stanford University]] focuses on technologies and methods for understanding biomedical data and to improve health care.

In Tunisia, University of Manouba offers a Master program called Intelligent and Decisional Informatics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=MR IDIAG (Informatique décisionnelle et intelligence appliquée à la gestion)|url=http://www.esct.rnu.tn/site/index.php/formations/masteres/mridiag|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which tries to cover all aspect of computational informatics.

'''DNA isolation''' is a process of purification of DNA from sample using a combination of physical and chemical methods. The first isolation of DNA was done in 1869 by [[Friedrich Miescher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dahm R | title = Discovering DNA: Friedrich Miescher and the early years of nucleic acid research | journal = Human Genetics | volume = 122 | issue = 6 | pages = 565–81 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17901982 | doi = 10.1007/s00439-007-0433-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently it is a routine procedure in [[molecular biology]] or [[forensics|forensic]] analyses. For the chemical method, there are many different kits used for extraction, and selecting the correct one will save time on kit optimization and extraction procedures. [[PCR]] sensitivity detection is considered to show the variation between the commercial kits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yoshikawa H, Dogruman-Al F, Dogruman-Ai F, Turk S, Kustimur S, Balaban N, Sultan N | title = Evaluation of DNA extraction kits for molecular diagnosis of human Blastocystis subtypes from fecal samples | journal = Parasitology Research | volume = 109 | issue = 4 | pages = 1045–50 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21499752 | doi = 10.1007/s00436-011-2342-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

{{Empty section|date=November 2018}}

== Basic procedure ==
There are three basic and two optional steps in a DNA extraction:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Rice | first1 = George | name-list-format = vanc | title = DNA Extraction | url = http://serc.carleton.edu/microbelife/research_methods/genomics/dnaext.html | website = Educational Resources, Microbial Life | publisher = Montana State University | accessdate = 17 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, D. N., et al. "Evaluation and optimization of DNA extraction and purification procedures for soil and sediment samples." Applied and Environmental Microbiology 65.11 (1999): 4715-4724.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cells which are to be studied need to be collected.
* Breaking the [[cell membrane]]s open to expose the DNA along with the cytoplasm within ([[Lysis|cell lysis]]).
** Lipids from the cell membrane and the nucleus are broken down with  [[detergent]]s and [[surfactant]]s.
** Breaking [[protein]]s by adding a [[protease]] (optional).
** Breaking [[RNA]] by adding an [[RNase]] (optional). 
* The solution is treated with concentrated salt solution to make debris such as broken proteins, lipids and RNA to clump together.
* [[Centrifugation]] of the solution, which separates the clumped cellular debris from the DNA.
* DNA purification from detergents, proteins, salts and reagents used during cell lysis step. The most commonly used procedures are:
** [[Ethanol precipitation]] usually by ice-cold [[ethanol]] or [[isopropanol]]. Since DNA is insoluble in these alcohols, it will aggregate together, giving a ''pellet'' upon [[centrifugation]]. Precipitation of DNA is improved by increasing of ionic strength, usually by adding [[sodium acetate]].
** [[Phenol–chloroform extraction]] in which [[phenol]] [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatures]] proteins in the sample. After centrifugation of the sample, denaturated proteins stay in the organic phase while aqueous phase containing [[nucleic acid]] is mixed with the [[chloroform]] that removes phenol residues from solution.
** [[Minicolumn purification]] that relies on the fact that the [[nucleic acid]]s may bind ([[adsorption]]) to the solid phase (silica or other) depending on the [[pH]] and the salt concentration of the buffer.

Cellular and [[histone]] proteins bound to the DNA can be removed either by adding a [[protease]] or by having precipitated the proteins with [[sodium acetate|sodium]] or [[ammonium acetate]], or [[phenol-chloroform extraction|extracted them with a phenol-chloroform]] mixture prior to the DNA-precipitation.

After isolation, the DNA is dissolved in slightly alkaline buffer, usually in the [[TE buffer]], or in [[Ultrapure water|ultra-pure water]].

== Method Selection ==
Some of the most common DNA extraction methods include [[Phenol-chloroform extraction|organic extraction]], [[Chelex 100|Chelex extraction]], and [[solid phase extraction]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/dna-extraction|title=ScienceDirect|website=www.sciencedirect.com|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; These methods consistently yield isolated DNA, but they differ in both the quality and the quantity of DNA yielded. When selecting a DNA extraction method, there are multiple factors to consider, including cost, time, safety, and risk of contamination.

[[Phenol-chloroform extraction|Organic extraction]] involves the addition of and incubation in multiple different chemical solutions;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; including a [[Cell lysis|lysis]] step, a phenol chloroform extraction, an [[ethanol precipitation]], and washing steps. Organic extraction is often used in laboratories because it is cheap, and it yields large quantities of pure DNA. Though it is easy, there are many steps involved, and it takes longer than other methods. It also involves the unfavorable use of the toxic chemicals [[phenol]] and [[chloroform]], and there is an increased risk of contamination due to transferring the DNA between multiple tubes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/123448124|title=Forensic DNA typing : biology, technology, and genetics of STR markers|last=1969-|first=Butler, John M. (John Marshall),|date=2005|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|isbn=9780080470610|edition= 2nd|location=Amsterdam|oclc=123448124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chelex 100|Chelex extraction]] method involves adding the Chelex resin to the sample, boiling the solution, then vortexing and centrifuging it. The cellular materials bind to the Chelex beads, while the DNA is available in the [[Precipitation (chemistry)|supernatant]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Chelex method is much faster and simpler than organic extraction, and it only requires one tube, which decreases the risk of DNA contamination. Unfortunately, Chelex extraction does not yield as much quantity and the DNA yielded is single-stranded, which means it can only be used for [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]-based analyses and not for [[Restriction fragment length polymorphism|RFLP]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Solid phase extraction]] such as using a [[Spin column-based nucleic acid purification|spin-column based extraction]] method takes advantage of the fact that DNA binds to [[Silica gel|silica]]. The sample containing DNA is added to a column containing a silica gel or silica beads. The DNA binds to the silica, while the rest of the solution is washed out.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The DNA can then be removed from the silica using a buffer. This method is very easy and uses only one tube; it also yields high quantities of pure, high-quality DNA, and the procedure can even be automated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Multiple solid phase extraction commercial kits are manufactured and marketed by different companies; the only problem is that they are more expensive than organic extraction or Chelex extraction.

==Special types ==
Specific techniques must be chosen for isolation of DNA from some samples. Typical samples with complicated DNA isolation are:
* archaeological samples containing partially degraded DNA, see [[ancient DNA]] &lt;ref&gt;Pääbo, Svante. "Ancient DNA: extraction, characterization, molecular cloning, and enzymatic amplification." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 86.6 (1989): 1939-1943.&lt;/ref&gt;
* samples containing inhibitors of subsequent analysis procedures, most notably inhibitors of [[PCR]], such as [[humic acid]] from soil, [[indigo]] and other fabric dyes or [[haemoglobin]] in blood
* samples from microorganisms with thick cellular wall, for example [[yeast]]

Extrachromosomal DNA is generally easy to isolate, especially [[plasmid]]s may be easily isolated by cell lysis followed by precipitation of proteins, which traps chromosomal DNA in insoluble fraction and after centrifugation, plasmid DNA can be purified from soluble fraction.

A Hirt DNA Extraction is an isolation of all [[extrachromosomal DNA]] in a mammalian cell. The Hirt extraction process gets rid of the high molecular weight [[nuclear DNA]], leaving only low molecular weight [[mitochondrial DNA]] and any viral [[episomes]] present in the cell.

==Detecting DNA==
{{main|Quantification of nucleic acids}}

A diphenylamine (DPA) indicator will confirm the presence of DNA. This procedure involves chemical hydrolysis of DNA: when heated (e.g. ≥95&amp;nbsp;°C) in acid, the reaction requires a deoxyribose sugar and therefore is specific for DNA. Under these conditions, the 2-deoxyribose is converted to w-hydroxylevulinyl aldehyde, which reacts with the compound, diphenylamine, to produce a blue-colored compound. DNA concentration can be determined measuring the intensity of absorbance of the solution at the 600&amp;nbsp;nm with a [[spectrophotometer]] and comparing to a [[standard curve]] of known DNA concentrations.

Measuring the intensity of absorbance of the DNA solution at wavelengths [[Quantification of nucleic acids|260 nm and 280 nm]] is used as a measure of DNA purity. DNA absorbs [[UV]] light at 260 and 280 nanometres, and aromatic proteins absorb UV light at 280&amp;nbsp;nm; a pure sample of DNA has a ratio of 1.8 at 260/280 and is relatively free from protein contamination. A DNA preparation that is contaminated with protein will have a 260/280 ratio lower than 1.8.

DNA can be quantified by cutting the DNA with a [[restriction enzyme]], running it on an agarose [[gel electrophoresis|gel]], staining with [[ethidium bromide]] or a different stain and comparing the intensity of the DNA with a DNA marker of known concentration.

Using the [[Southern blot]] technique, this quantified DNA can be isolated and examined further using [[PCR]] and [[RFLP]] analysis. These procedures allow differentiation of the repeated sequences within the genome. It is these techniques which [[forensic]] scientists use for comparison, identification, and analysis.

[[File:Angelic movers.jpg|thumb|250px|alt= Ornate manuscript illumination showing celestial spheres, with angels turning cranks at the axis of the starry sphere|Fourteenth-century drawing of angels turning the celestial spheres]]

Ancient, medieval and [[Renaissance]] astronomers and philosophers developed many different theories about the '''dynamics of the [[celestial spheres]]'''.  They explained the motions of the various nested spheres in terms of the materials of which they were made, external movers such as celestial intelligences, and internal movers such as motive souls or impressed forces.  Most of these models were qualitative, although a few of them incorporated quantitative analyses that related speed, motive force and resistance.

==The celestial material and its natural motions==
In considering the physics of the celestial spheres, scholars followed two different views about the material composition of the celestial spheres.  For [[Plato]], the celestial regions were made "mostly out of fire"&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Timaeus'' 40a2–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornford 1957, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; on account of fire's mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Timaeus'', 55d-56a.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later Platonists, such as [[Plotinus]], maintained that although fire moves naturally upward in a straight line toward its natural place at the periphery of the universe, when it arrived there, it would either rest or move naturally in a circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Merlan  | first = Philip | title = Plotinus Enneads 2.2 | journal = Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association | volume = 74 | pages = 179–191 | year = 1943 | postscript =, pp.&amp;nbsp;186–7. | doi = 10.2307/283597 | jstor = 283597}}&lt;/ref&gt; This account was compatible with [[Aristotle]]'s [[Meteorology (Aristotle)|meteorology]]&lt;ref name="Webster2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |first2=E.W. |last2=Webster |year=2006 |title=Meteorology |publisher=Digireads.com |isbn=978-1-4209-2748-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=etvHt-bBafMC&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;pg=PA7 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a fiery region in the upper air, dragged along underneath the circular motion of the lunar sphere.&lt;ref name="Sorabji2005"&gt;{{cite book |first=R. |last=Sorabji |year=2005 |title=The Philosophy of the Commentators, 200-600 AD: Physics |series=G - Reference, Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects Series |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=978-0-8014-8988-4 |lccn=2004063547 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0QpQw8JDgQcC&amp;lpg=PA352&amp;pg=PA352 |page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Aristotle, however, the spheres themselves were made entirely of a special fifth element,&lt;ref&gt;Grant 1994, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aether (classical element)|''Aether'' (Αἰθήρ)]], the bright, untainted upper atmosphere in which the gods dwell, as distinct from the dense lower atmosphere, ''Aer'' (Ἀήρ).&lt;ref&gt;''Aether'' was personified in mythology as the offspring of night and the dwelling place of Zeus.{{cite book |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130%3Acard%3D104#note2 |author=Hesiod |title=Theogony |at=lines 123-4, 929j}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the four terrestrial elements ([[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Water (classical element)|water]], [[Air (classical element)|air]] and [[Fire (classical element)|fire]]) gave rise to the [[generation and corruption]] of natural substances by their mutual transformations, aether was unchanging, moving always with a [[uniform circular motion]] that was uniquely suited to the celestial spheres, which were eternal.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd  1968, pp.&amp;nbsp;134–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"by simple bodies I mean those which possess a principle of movement in their own nature, such as fire and earth and their kinds&amp;nbsp;... there must necessarily be some simple body which revolves naturally and by virtue of its own nature with a circular movement."  Aristotle, ''On the heavens'', 268b28-269a8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Earth and water had a natural heaviness (''gravitas''), which they expressed by moving downward toward the center of the universe. Fire and air had a natural lightness (''levitas''), such that they moved upward, away from the center. Aether, being neither heavy nor light, moved naturally around the center.&lt;ref&gt;Grant 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;196–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The causes of celestial motion==

As early as Plato, philosophers considered the heavens to be moved by immaterial agents.  Plato believed the cause to be a [[Anima mundi|world-soul]], [[Timaeus (dialogue)#The Creation of the World Soul|created]] according to mathematical principles, which governed the daily motion of the heavens (the motion of the Same) and the opposed motions of the [[Planet#Ancient Greece to Medieval Europe|planets]] along the [[zodiac]] (the motion of the Different).&lt;ref&gt;Cornford 1957, pp.&amp;nbsp;57–93.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle proposed the existence of divine [[unmoved mover]]s which act as [[Four causes#Final cause|final causes]]; the [[celestial spheres]] mimic the movers, as best they could, by moving with uniform circular motion.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd 1968, pp.&amp;nbsp;139–147.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant 1994, p. 515.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Aristotle maintained that an individual unmoved mover would be required to insure each individual motion in the heavens. While stipulating that the number of spheres, and thus gods, is subject to revision by astronomers, he estimated the total as 47 or 55, depending on whether one followed the model of [[Eudoxus of Cnidus#Eudoxan planetary models|Eudoxus]] or [[Callippus]].&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd 1968, pp.&amp;nbsp;147–53.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[On the Heavens]]'', Aristotle presented an alternate view of eternal circular motion as moving itself, in the manner of Plato's world-soul,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J.J. |last=Cleary |year=1995 |title=Aristotle and Mathematics: Aporetic Method in Cosmology and Metaphysics |series=Philosophia Antiqua |publisher=E.J.

===Later Greek interpreters===

In his ''Planetary Hypotheses'', [[Ptolemy]] (c.90–168) rejected the Aristotelian concept of an external prime mover, maintaining instead that the planets have souls and move themselves with a voluntary motion.  Each planet sends out motive emissions that direct its own motion and the motions of the [[epicycle]] and [[deferent]] that make up its system, just as a bird sends out emissions to its nerves that direct the motions of its feet and wings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Murschel | first = Andrea | title = The Structure and Function of Ptolemy's Physical Hypotheses of Planetary Motion | journal = Journal for the History of Astronomy | volume = 26 | pages = 33–61 | year = 1995 | bibcode = 1995JHA....26...33M | postscript =, pp.&amp;nbsp;38–40.| doi = 10.1177/002182869502600102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Neugebauer | first = Otto | authorlink = Otto E.

[[John Philoponus]] (490–570) considered that the heavens were made of fire, not of aether, yet maintained that circular motion is one of the two natural motions of fire.&lt;ref&gt;Wildberg 1988, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a theological work, ''On the Creation of the World'' (''De opificio mundi''), he denied that the heavens are moved by either a soul or by angels, proposing that "it is not impossible that God, who created all these things, imparted a motive force to the Moon, the Sun, and other stars&amp;nbsp;– just as the inclination to heavy and light bodies, and the movements due to the internal soul to all living beings&amp;nbsp;– in order that the angels do not move them by force."&lt;ref&gt;Wildberg 1988, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson 1962, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sorabji 1988, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is interpreted as an application of the concept of [[Theory of impetus|impetus]] to the motion of the celestial spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Sorabji 1988, pp.&amp;nbsp;231–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wildberg 1988, pp.&amp;nbsp;243–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sorabji 1988, pp. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;  In an earlier commentary on Aristotle's ''Physics'', Philoponus compared the innate power or nature that accounts for the rotation of the heavens to the innate power or nature that accounts for the fall of rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Sorabji 1988, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic interpreters===

The Islamic philosophers [[al-Farabi]] (c.872–c.950) and [[Avicenna]] (c.980–1037), following Plotinus, maintained that Aristotle's movers, called intelligences, came into being through a series of [[Emanationism|emanations]] beginning with God.  A first intelligence emanated from God, and from the first intelligence emanated a sphere, its soul, and a second intelligence.  The process continued down through the celestial spheres until the sphere of the Moon, its soul, and a final intelligence.  They considered that each sphere was moved continually by its soul, seeking to emulate the perfection of its intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Davidson | first = Herbert A. | title = Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, on Intellect: Their Cosmologies, Theories of the Active Intellect, and Theories of Human Intellect | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1992 | location = Oxford | pages = 44–48, 74–77 | isbn = 0-19-507423-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolfson"&gt;Wolfson 1958, pp.&amp;nbsp;243–4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Avicenna maintained that besides an intelligence and its soul, each sphere was also moved by a natural inclination (''mayl'').&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson 1962, pp.&amp;nbsp;82–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

An interpreter of Aristotle from [[Al-Andalus|Muslim Spain]], [[al-Bitruji]] (d. c.1024), proposed a radical transformation of astronomy that did away with [[epicycles]] and eccentrics, in which the celestial spheres were driven by a single unmoved mover at the periphery of the universe.  The spheres thus moved with a "natural nonviolent motion".&lt;ref&gt;al-Biţrūjī. (1971) ''On the Principles of Astronomy'', 1.60-62, trans. Bernard R. Goldstein, vol. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;78–9.  New Haven: Yale Univ. Pr.  {{ISBN|0-300-01387-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mover's power diminished with increasing distance from the periphery so that the lower spheres lagged behind in their daily motion around the Earth; this power reached even as far as the sphere of water, producing the [[tides]].&lt;ref&gt;Dales 1980, pp.&amp;nbsp;538–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weisheipl 1961, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

More influential for later Christian thinkers were the teachings of [[Averroes]] (1126–1198), who agreed with Avicenna that the intelligences and souls combine to move the spheres but rejected his concept of emanation.&lt;ref name="Wolfson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson 1962, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;  Considering how the soul acts, he maintained that the soul moves its sphere without effort, for the celestial material has no tendency to a contrary motion.&lt;ref&gt;Grant 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;539–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the century, the [[mutakallim]] Adud al-Din al-Iji (1281–1355) rejected the principle of uniform and circular motion, following the [[Ash'ari]] doctrine of [[atomism]], which maintained that all physical effects were caused directly by God's will rather than by natural causes.&lt;ref name=Huff-175&gt;{{Cite book |first=Toby |last=Huff |year=2003 |title=The Rise of Early Modern Science: Islam, China, and the West |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-52994-8 |page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He maintained that the celestial spheres were "imaginary things" and "more tenuous than a spider's web".&lt;ref name=Ragep&gt;pp.&amp;nbsp;55&amp;ndash;57 of {{Cite journal| doi = 10.1086/649338| issn = 0369-7827| last = Ragep| first = F.

===Medieval Western Europe===

In the [[Early Middle Ages]], Plato's picture of the heavens was dominant among European philosophers, which led Christian thinkers to question the role and nature of the world-soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | first = John | last = Marenbon  | editor-last = Gersh | editor-first = Stephen | editor2-last = Hoenen | editor2-first = M.

In the early phases of the Western [[recovery of Aristotle]], [[Robert Grosseteste]] (c.1175–1253), influenced by medieval Platonism and by the astronomy of al-Bitruji, rejected the idea that the heavens are moved by either souls or intelligences.&lt;ref&gt;Dales 1980, pp.&amp;nbsp;540–3.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Adam Marsh]]'s (c.1200–1259) treatise ''On the Ebb and Flow of the Sea'', which was formerly attributed to Grosseteste, maintained al-Bitruji's opinion that the celestial spheres and the seas are moved by a peripheral mover whose motion weakens with distance.&lt;ref&gt;Dales 1980, p. 540.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Aquinas]] (c.1225–1274), following Avicenna, interpreted Aristotle to mean that there were two immaterial substances responsible for the motion of each celestial sphere, a soul that was an integral part of its sphere, and an intelligence that was separate from its sphere.  The soul shares the motion of its sphere and causes the sphere to move through its love and desire for the unmoved separate intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson 1962, 87-90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;516–17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Avicenna, [[al-Ghazali]], [[Moses Maimonides]], and most Christian [[Scholasticism|scholastic philosophers]] identified Aristotle's intelligences with the [[angels]] of revelation, thereby associating an angel with each of the spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Grant 1994, p. 525.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, Aquinas rejected the idea that celestial bodies are moved by an internal nature, similar to the heaviness and lightness that moves terrestrial bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Weisheipl 1961, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;  Attributing souls to the spheres was theologically controversial, as that could make them animals.  After the [[Condemnations of 1277]], most philosophers came to  reject the idea that the celestial spheres had souls.&lt;ref&gt;Grant 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;546–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Kilwardby]] (c. 1215–1279) discussed three alternative explanations of the motions of the celestial spheres, rejecting the views that celestial bodies are animated and are moved by their own spirits or souls, or that the celestial bodies are moved by angelic spirits, which govern and move them.  He maintained, instead, that "celestial bodies are moved by their own natural inclinations similar to weight".&lt;ref&gt;Weisheipl 1961, p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;  Just as heavy bodies are naturally moved by their own weight, which is an intrinsic active principle, so the celestial bodies are naturally moved by a similar intrinsic principle.  Since the heavens are spherical, the only motion that could be natural to them is rotation.  Kilwardby's idea had been earlier held by another [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] scholar, [[John Blund]] (c. 1175–1248).&lt;ref&gt;Weisheipl 1961, pp. 316-317.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;547–548.&lt;/ref&gt;

In two slightly different discussions, [[John Buridan]] (c.1295–1358) suggested that when God created the celestial spheres, he began to move them, impressing in them a circular impetus that would be neither corrupted nor diminished, since there was neither an inclination to other movements nor any resistance in the celestial region.  He noted that this would allow God to rest on the seventh day, but he left the matter to be resolved by the theologians.&lt;ref&gt;Dales 1980, pp.&amp;nbsp;547–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = John Buridan | author-link = John Buridan | editor = Marshall Clagett | contribution = Questions on the Eight Books of the Physics of Aristotle | title = The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages | year = 1959 | page = 536 | place = Madison | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = John Buridan | author-link = John Buridan | editor = Marshall Clagett | contribution = Questions on the Four Books on the Heavens and the World of Aristotle | title = The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages | year = 1959 | page = 561 | place = Madison | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicole Oresme]] (c.1323-1382) explained the motion of the spheres in traditional terms of the action of intelligences but noted that, contrary to Aristotle, some intelligences are moved; for example, the intelligence that moves the Moon's epicycle shares the motion of the lunar orb in which the epicycle is embedded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Nicole Oresme | author-link = Nicole Oresme | editor = A. D. Menut and A. J. Denomy | title = Le Livre du ciel et du monde | place = Madison | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press | year = 1968 | pages = 286–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He related the spheres' motions to the proportion of motive power to resistance that was impressed in each sphere when God created the heavens.&lt;ref&gt;Dales 1980, pp.&amp;nbsp;548–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Nicole Oresme | author-link = Nicole Oresme | editor = A. D. Menut and A. J. Denomy | title = Le Livre du ciel et du monde | place = Madison | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press | year = 1968 | pages = 286–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In discussing the relation of the moving power of the intelligence, the resistance of the sphere, and the circular [[velocity]], he said "this ratio ought not to be called a ratio of force to resistance except by analogy, because an intelligence moves by will alone&amp;nbsp;... and the heavens do not resist it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Nicole Oresme | author-link = Nicole Oresme | editor = Edward Grant | title = De proportionibus proportionum ''and'' Ad pauca respicientes | place = Madison | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press | year = 1966 | page = 293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Grant, except for Oresme, scholastic thinkers did not consider the force-resistance model to be properly applicable to the motion of celestial bodies, although some, such as [[Bartholomeus Amicus]], thought analogically in terms of force and resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Grant 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;502–3, 541-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of the Middle Ages it was the common opinion among philosophers that the celestial bodies were moved by external intelligences, or angels, and not by some kind of an internal mover.&lt;ref&gt;Grant 1994, pp. 527.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The movers and Copernicanism===

Although [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (1473–1543) transformed Ptolemaic astronomy and Aristotelian cosmology by moving the Earth from the center of the universe, he retained both the traditional model of the celestial spheres and the medieval Aristotelian views of the causes of its motion.  Copernicus follows Aristotle to maintain that circular motion is natural to the form of a sphere.  However, he also appears to have accepted the traditional philosophical belief that the spheres are moved by an external mover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jardine | first = Nicholas | title = The Significance of the Copernican Orbs | journal = Journal for the History of Astronomy | volume = 13 | pages = 168–194 | year = 1982 | bibcode = 1982JHA....13..168J | postscript =, pp.&amp;nbsp;178–183.| doi = 10.1177/002182868201300302 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannes Kepler]]'s (1571–1630) cosmology eliminated the celestial spheres, but he held that the planets were moved both by an external motive power, which he located in the Sun, and a motive soul associated with each planet.  In an early manuscript discussing the motion of Mars, Kepler considered the Sun to cause the circular motion of the planet.  He then attributed the inward and outward motion of the planet, which transforms its overall motion from circular to oval, to a moving soul in the planet since the motion is "not a natural motion, but more of an animate one".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Donahue | first = W. H.  | title = Kepler's First Thoughts on Oval Orbits: Text, Translation, and Commentary | journal = Journal for the History of Astronomy | volume = 24 | pages = 71–100 | year = 1993 | bibcode = 1993JHA....24...71D | postscript =, pp.&amp;nbsp;75–76, 85-88.| doi = 10.1177/002182869302400103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In various writings, Kepler often attributed a kind of intelligence to the inborn motive faculties associated with the stars.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson 1962, pp.&amp;nbsp;90–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of Copernicanism  the planets came to be seen as bodies moving freely through a very subtle aethereal medium.  Although many scholastics continued to maintain that intelligences were the celestial movers, they now associated the intelligences with the planets themselves, rather than with the celestial spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Grant 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;544–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethnography''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἔθνος}} ''ethnos'' "folk, people, nation" and {{lang|grc|γράφω}} ''grapho'' "I write") is the systematic study of people and cultures. It is designed to explore [[cultural]] phenomena where the researcher observes society from the point of view of the subject of the study.  An ethnography is a means to represent graphically and in writing the culture of a [[ethnic group|group]].  The word can thus be said to have a double meaning, which partly depends on whether it is used as a [[count noun]] or uncountable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanethnography.com/ethnography.php "Technical definition of ethnography"], ''American Ethnography''&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting field study or a case report reflects the knowledge and the system of meanings in the lives of a cultural group.&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, C. (1973). [[Thick description]]: Toward an Interpretive Theory of Culture.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''The Interpretation of Cultures: Selected Essays'' (pp. 3-30). New York: Basic Books, Inc., Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philipsen, G. (1992). ''Speaking Culturally: Explorations in Social Communication.'' Albany, New York: State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt;

As a method of data collection ethnography entails examining the behaviour of the participants in a certain specific social situation and also understanding their interpretation of such behaviour.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;(Dewan M. (2018) Understanding Ethnography: An ‘Exotic’ Ethnographer’s Perspective. In: Mura P., Khoo-Lattimore C. (eds) Asian Qualitative Research in Tourism. Perspectives on Asian Tourism. Springer, Singapore)&lt;/ref&gt; Dewan (2018) further elaborates that this behaviour may be shaped by the constraints the participants feel because of the situations they are in or by the society in which they belong. Ethnography, as the presentation of [[empirical]] data on human [[Society|societies]] and [[culture]]s, was pioneered in the biological, social, and cultural branches of [[anthropology]], but it has also become popular in the [[social sciences]] in general—[[sociology]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ethnology "Ethnology" at ''dictionary.com''].&lt;/ref&gt; communication studies, history—wherever people study ethnic groups, formations, compositions, resettlements, social welfare characteristics, materiality, spirituality, and a people's [[ethnogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Токарев |first=Сергей Александрович |coauthors= |script-title=ru:История зарубежной этнографии |publisher=Наука |year=1978 |url=http://historia-site.narod.ru/library/ethnology/tokarev_main.htm |isbn= |language=Russian |title=Archived copy |access-date=2003-05-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030519225912/http://historia-site.narod.ru/library/ethnology/tokarev_main.htm |archive-date=2003-05-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical ethnography is a [[holistic]] study&lt;ref name="Ember 2006"&gt;Ember, Carol and Melvin Ember, ''Cultural Anthropology'' (Prentice Hall, 2006), chapter one.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heider, Karl 2001"&gt;Heider, Karl. ''Seeing Anthropology''. 2001. Prentice Hall, Chapters One and Two.&lt;/ref&gt; and so includes a brief history, and an analysis of the [[Physical geography|terrain]], the [[climate]], and the [[habitat]].  In all cases, it should be reflexive, make a substantial contribution toward the understanding of the social life of humans, have an aesthetic impact on the reader, and express a credible reality. An ethnography records all observed behavior and describes all symbol-meaning relations, using concepts that avoid causal explanations. Traditionally, ethnography was focussed on the western gaze towards the far 'exotic' east, but now researchers are undertaking ethnography in their own social environment. According to Dewan (2018), even if we are the other, the ‘another’ or the ‘native’, we are still ‘another’ because there are many facades of ourselves that connect us to people and other facades that highlight our differences. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[File:Sahagun.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Bernardino de Sahagún]] is known as the first modern ethnographer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/43462|title=Bernardino de Sahagun: First Anthropologist (review)|first=Louise M.|last=Burkhart|date=10 June 2003|publisher=|journal=The Catholic Historical Review|volume=89|issue=2|pages=351–352|via=Project MUSE|doi=10.1353/cat.2003.0100}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The word 'ethnography' is derived from the Greek ἔθνος (''ethnos''), meaning "a company, later a people, nation" and [[-graphy]], meaning "writing". Ethnographic studies focus on large cultural groups of people who interact over time. Ethnography is a set of qualitative methods that are used in social sciences that focus on the observation of social practices and interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.erialproject.org/for-librarians/what-is-ethnography|title=What is Ethnography? « ERIAL Project|website=www.erialproject.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its aim is to observe a situation without imposing any deductive structure or framework upon it and to view everything as strange or unique.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Preece, J., Sharp, H., &amp; Rogers, Y. (2015). Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction (4th edition). Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of anthropology originated from Europe and England designed in late 19th century. It spread its roots to the United States at the beginning of the 20th century. Some of the main contributors like [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E.&amp;nbsp;B. Tylor]] (1832–1917) from Britain and [[Lewis H. Morgan]] (1818–1881), an American scientist were considered as founders of cultural and social dimensions. [[Franz Boas]] (1858–1942), [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] (1884—1942), [[Ruth Benedict]] (1887–1948), and [[Margaret Mead]] (1901–1978), were a group of researchers from the United States who contributed the idea of [[cultural relativism]] to the literature. Boas's approach focused on the use of documents and informants, whereas Malinowski stated that a researcher should be engrossed with the work for long periods in the field and do a participant observation by living with the informant and experiencing their way of life. He gives the viewpoint of the native and this became the origin of field work and field methods.

Since Malinowski was very firm with his approach he applied it practically and traveled to [[Trobriand Islands]] which are located off the eastern coast of [[New Guinea]]. He was interested in learning the language of the islanders and stayed there for a long time doing his field work. The field of ethnography became very popular in the late 19th century, as many social scientists gained an interest in studying modern society.  Again, in the latter part of the 19th century, the field of anthropology became a good support for scientific formation.  Though the field was flourishing, it had a lot of threats to encounter. Postcolonialism, the research climate shifted towards post-modernism and feminism. Therefore, the field of anthropology moved into a discipline of social science.

==Origins==
[[Gerhard Friedrich Müller]] developed the concept of ethnography as a separate discipline whilst participating in the [[Second Kamchatka Expedition]] (1733–43) as a professor of history and geography. Whilst involved in the expedition, he differentiated ''Völker-Beschreibung'' as a distinct area of study. This became known as "ethnography," following the introduction of the Greek neologism ''ethnographia''  by Johann Friedrich Schöpperlin and the German variant by A. F. Thilo in 1767.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[August Ludwig von Schlözer]] and [[Christoph Wilhelm Jacob Gatterer]] of the [[University of Göttingen]] introduced the term into the academic discourse in an attempt to reform the contemporary understanding of world history.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Vermeulen, Han F., 2008, ''Early History of Ethnography and Ethnology in the German Enlightenment'', Leiden, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vermeulen"&gt;{{cite book|last = Vermeulen|first = Hans|title = Early History of Ethnograph and Ethnolog in the German Enlightenment: Anthropological Discourse in Europe and Asia, 1710-1808|year = 2008|publisher = Privately published|location = Leiden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]], known as the Father of History, had significant works on the cultures of various peoples beyond the Hellenic realm such as the [[Scythians]], which earned him the title "philobarbarian", and may be said to have produced the first works of ethnography.

==Forms of ethnography==

There are different forms of ethnography: confessional ethnography; life history; feminist ethnography etc. Two popular forms of ethnography are realist ethnography and critical ethnography. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 93)

Realist ethnography is a traditional approach used by cultural anthropologists. Characterized by Van Maanen (1988), it reflects a particular instance taken by the researcher toward the individual being studied. It's an objective study of the situation. It's composed from a third person's perspective by getting the data from the members on the site. The ethnographer stays as omniscient correspondent of actualities out of sight. The realist reports information in a measured style ostensibly uncontaminated by individual predisposition, political objectives, and judgment. The analyst will give a detailed report of the everyday life of the individuals under study. The ethnographer also uses standard categories for cultural description (e.g., family life, communication network). The ethnographer produces the participant's views through closely edited quotations and has the final work on how the culture is to be interpreted and presented. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 93)

Critical ethnography is a kind of ethnographic research in which the creators advocate for the liberation of groups which are marginalized in society. Critical researchers typically are politically minded people who look to take a stand of opposition to inequality and domination.  For example, a critical ethnographer might study schools that provide privileges to certain types of students, or counseling practices that serve to overlook the needs of underrepresented groups. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94). The important components of a critical ethnographer are to incorporate a value- laden introduction, empower people by giving them more authority, challenging the status quo, and addressing concerns about power and control. A critical ethnographer will study issues of power, empowerment, inequality inequity, dominance, repression, hegemony, and victimization. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94)

==Features of ethnographic research==
According to Dewan (2018) the researcher is not looking for generalizing the findings; rather, they are considering it in reference to the context of the situation. In this regard, the best way to integrate ethnography in a quantitative research would be to use it to discover and uncover relationships and then use the resultant data to test and explain the empirical assumptions &lt;ref&gt;(Dewan M. (2018) Understanding Ethnography: An ‘Exotic’ Ethnographer’s Perspective. In: Mura P., Khoo-Lattimore C. (eds) Asian Qualitative Research in Tourism. Perspectives on Asian Tourism. Springer, Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt;

* Involves investigation of very few cases, maybe just one case, in detail.
* Often involves working with primarily unconstructed data. This data had not been coded at the point of data collection in terms of a closed set of analytic categories.
* Emphasizes on exploring social phenomena rather than testing hypotheses.
* Data analysis involves interpretation of the functions and meanings of human actions. The product of this is mainly verbal explanations, where statistical analysis and quantification play a subordinate role. 
* Methodological discussions focus more on questions about how to report findings in the field than on methods of data collection and interpretation.
* Ethnographies focus on describing the culture of a group in very detailed and complex manner. The ethnography can be of the entire group or a subpart of it. 
* It involves engaging in extensive field work where data collection is mainly by interviews, symbols, artifacts, observations, and many other sources of data. 
* The researcher in ethnography type of research looks for patterns of the group's mental activities, that is their ideas and beliefs expressed through language or other activities, and how they behave in their groups as expressed through their actions that the researcher observed.
* In ethnography, the researcher gathers what is available, what is normal, what it is that people do, what they say, and how they work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Procedures for conducting ethnography==

* Determine if ethnography is the most appropriate design to use to study the research problem. Ethnography is suitable if the needs are to describe how a cultural group works and to explore their beliefs, language, behaviours and also issues faced by the group, such as power, resistance, and dominance. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94)
*  Then identify and locate a culture-sharing group to study.  This group is one whose members have been together for an extended period of time, so that their shared language, patterns of behaviour and attitudes have merged into discernible patterns. This group can also be a group that has been marginalized by society. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94)
* Select cultural themes, issues or theories to study about the group. These themes, issues, and theories provide an orienting framework for the study of the culture-sharing group. As discussed by [[Martyn Hammersley|Hammersley]] and Atkinson (2007), Wolcott (1987, 1994b, 2008-1), and Fetterman (2009). The ethnographer begins the study by examining people in interaction in ordinary settings and discerns pervasive patterns such as life cycles, events, and cultural themes. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94-95)
* For studying cultural concepts, determine which type of ethnography to use. Perhaps how the group works need to be described, or a critical ethnography can expose issues such as power, hegemony, and advocacy for certain groups (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 95)
* Should collect information in the context or setting where the group works or lives. This is called fieldwork. Types of information typically needed in ethnography are collected by going to the research site, respecting the daily lives of individuals at the site and collecting a wide variety of materials. Field issues of respect, reciprocity, deciding who owns the data and others are central to Ethnography (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 95)
*  From the many sources collected, the ethnographer analyzes the data for a description of the culture-sharing group, themes that emerge from the group and an overall interpretation (Wolcott, 1994b). The researcher begins to compile a detailed description of the culture-sharing group, by focusing on a single event, on several activities, or on the group over a prolonged period of time.
*   Forge a working set of rules or generalizations as to how the culture-sharing group works as the final product of this analysis. The final product is a holistic cultural portrait of the group that incorporates the views of the participants (emic) as well as the views of the researcher (etic). It might also advocate for the needs of the group or suggest changes in society. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 96)

==Ethnography as method==
The ethnographic method is different from other ways of conducting social science approach due to the following reasons:
[[File:Rozmowa z twórczyniami tradycyjnych, wołoskich pisanek.jpg|thumb|An ethnographer conducting field interviews, [[Wallachian Open Air Museum|Valašské muzeum v přírodě]]]]
* It is field-based. It is conducted in the settings in which real people actually live, rather than in laboratories where the researcher controls the elements of the behaviors to be observed or measured.
* It is personalized. It is conducted by researchers who are in the day-to-day, face-to-face contact with the people they are studying and who are thus both participants in and observers of the lives under study.
* It is multifactorial. It is conducted through the use of two or more data collection techniques - which may be qualitative or quantitative in nature - in order to get a conclusion.
* It requires a long-term commitment i.e. it is conducted by a researcher who intends to interact with people they are studying for an extended period of time.  The exact time frame can vary from several weeks to a year or more.
* It is inductive. It is conducted in such a way to use an accumulation of descriptive detail to build toward general patterns or explanatory theories rather than structured to test hypotheses derived from existing theories or models.
* It is dialogic.  It is conducted by a researcher whose interpretations and findings may be expounded on by the study’s participants while conclusions are still in the process of formulation.
* It is holistic. It is conducted so as to yield the fullest possible portrait of the group under study.
* It can also be used in other methodological frameworks, for instance, an action research program of study where one of the goals is to change and improve the situation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Data collection methods==
[[File:Izmir Ethnography Museum.jpg|thumb|220px|alt=text|[[Izmir Ethnography Museum]] (İzmir Etnografya Müzesi), [[Izmir]], [[Turkey]], from the courtyard]]
[[File:Ethnography Museum Budapest architecture.jpg|thumb|220px|alt=text|[[Ethnographic Museum (Budapest)|Ethnography museum]], [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]]]
According to the leading social scientist, [[John David Brewer|John Brewer]], data collection methods are meant to capture the "social meanings and ordinary activities"&lt;ref name="brewer"&gt;[Brewer, John D. (2000). ''Ethnography.'' Philadelphia: Open University Press. p.10.]&lt;/ref&gt; of people (informants) in "naturally occurring settings"&lt;ref name="brewer" /&gt; that are commonly referred to as "the field."  The goal is to collect data in such a way that the researcher imposes a minimal amount of personal bias in the data.&lt;ref name="brewer" /&gt;  Multiple methods of data collection may be employed to facilitate a relationship that allows for a more personal and in-depth portrait of the informants and their community.  These can include participant observation, field notes, interviews, and surveys.

Interviews are often taped and later transcribed, allowing the interview to proceed unimpaired of note-taking, but with all information available later for full analysis. Secondary research and document analysis are also used to provide insight into the research topic.  In the past, kinship charts were commonly used to "discover logical patterns and social structure in non-Western societies".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthrobase.com/Dic/eng/def/kinship.html]{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, anthropology focuses more on the study of people in urban settings and the use of kinship charts is seldom employed.

In order to make the data collection and interpretation transparent, researchers creating ethnographies often attempt to be "reflexive". Reflexivity refers to the researcher's aim "to explore the ways in which [the] researcher's involvement with a particular study influences, acts upon and informs such research".&lt;ref&gt;[Nightingale, David &amp; Cromby, John. ''Social Constructionist Psychology: A Critical Analysis of Theory and Practice''. Philadelphia: Open University Press. p.228.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite these attempts of reflexivity, no researcher can be totally unbiased. This factor has provided a basis to criticize ethnography.

Traditionally, the ethnographer focuses attention on a community, selecting knowledgeable informants who know the activities of the community well.&lt;ref name="G1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Garson |first=G. David |url=http://faculty.chass.ncsu.edu/garson/PA765/ethno.htm |title=Ethnographic Research: Statnotes, from North Carolina State University, Public Administration Program |publisher=Faculty.chass.ncsu.edu |year=2008 |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; These informants are typically asked to identify other informants who represent the community, often using snowball or chain sampling.&lt;ref name="G1"/&gt; This process is often effective in revealing common cultural denominators connected to the topic being studied.&lt;ref name="G1"/&gt; Ethnography relies greatly on up-close, personal experience. Participation, rather than just observation, is one of the keys to this process.&lt;ref&gt;Genzuk, Michael, PH.D., ''[http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~genzuk/Ethnographic_Research.html A Synthesis of Ethnographic]'', Center for Multilingual, Multicultural Research, University of Southern California&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnography is very useful in social research.

Ybema et al. (2010) examine the ontological and epistemological presuppositions underlying ethnography.  Ethnographic research can range from a realist perspective, in which behavior is observed, to a constructivist perspective where understanding is socially constructed by the researcher and subjects. Research can range from an objectivist account of fixed, observable behaviors to an interpretive narrative describing "the interplay of individual agency and social structure."&lt;ref&gt;S. Ybema, D. Yanow, H. Wels, &amp; F. Kamsteeg (2010). "Ethnography." In A. Mills, G. Durepos, &amp; E. Wiebe (Eds.), ''Encyclopedia of Case Study Research.'' (pp. 348-352). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical theory researchers address "issues of power within the researcher-researched relationships and the links between knowledge and power."

Another form of data collection is that of the "image." The image is the projection that an individual puts on an object or abstract idea. An image can be contained within the physical world through a particular individual's perspective, primarily based on that individual’s past experiences. One example of an image is how an individual views a novel after completing it. The physical entity that is the novel contains a specific image in the perspective of the interpreting individual and can only be expressed by the individual in the terms of "I can tell you what an image is by telling you what it feels like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barry|first1=Lynda|title=Lynda Barry: The answer is in the picture|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmT4wLWksOw|website=YouTube|publisher=INKtalks|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of an image relies on the imagination and has been seen to be utilized by children in a very spontaneous and natural manner. Effectively, the idea of the image is a primary tool for ethnographers to collect data. The image presents the perspective, experiences, and influences of an individual as a single entity and in consequence, the individual will always contain this image in the group under study.

== Differences across disciplines ==
The ethnographic method is used across a range of different disciplines, primarily by anthropologists but also occasionally by sociologists. [[Cultural studies]], (European) [[ethnology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], [[social work]], [[education]], [[design]], [[psychology]], [[computer science]], [[human factors and ergonomics]], [[ethnomusicology]], [[folkloristics]], [[religious studies]], [[geography]], [[history]], [[linguistics]], [[communication studies]], [[performance studies]], [[advertising]], nursing, [[urban planning]], [[usability]], [[political science]],&lt;ref&gt;Schatz, Edward, ed. ''Political Ethnography: What Immersion Contributes to the Study of Power''. University Of Chicago Press. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[social movement]],&lt;ref&gt;Balsiger, P., Lambelet, A.,  Participant Observation. In D. Della Porta (Ed.), Methodological Practices in Social Movement Research (pp. 144-172). Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and [[criminology]] are other fields which have made use of ethnography.

===Cultural and social anthropology===
[[Cultural anthropology]] and [[social anthropology]] were developed around ethnographic research and their [[canon (basic principle)|canonical]] texts, which are mostly ethnographies: e.g. ''[[Argonauts of the Western Pacific]]'' (1922) by [[Bronisław Malinowski]], ''Ethnologische Excursion in Johore'' (1875) by [[Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay]],  ''[[Coming of Age in Samoa]]'' (1928) by [[Margaret Mead]], ''The Nuer'' (1940) by [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]], ''Naven'' (1936, 1958) by [[Gregory Bateson]], or "[[The Lele of the Kasai]]" (1963) by [[Mary Douglas]]. Cultural and social anthropologists today place a high value on doing ethnographic research. The typical ethnography is a document written about a particular people, almost always based at least in part on [[emic]] views of where the culture begins and ends. Using language or community boundaries to bound the ethnography is common.&lt;ref&gt;Naroll, Raoul. ''Handbook of Methods in Cultural Anthropology.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Ethnographies are also sometimes called "case studies."&lt;ref&gt;Chavez, Leo. ''Shadowed Lives: Undocumented Workers in American Society'' (Case Studies in Cultural Anthropology). 1997, Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ethnographers study and interpret culture, its universalities, and its variations through the ethnographic study based on [[fieldwork]]. An ethnography is a specific kind of written observational science which provides an account of a particular culture, society, or community. The fieldwork usually involves spending a year or more in another society, living with the local people and learning about their ways of life.  Neophyte Ethnographers are strongly encouraged to develop extensive familiarity with their subject prior to entering the field; otherwise, they may find themselves in difficult situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burns |first=Janet M.C. | title=Caught in the Riptide: Female Researcher in a Patricentric Setting.  Pp. 171-182 in Fragile Truths: 25 Years of Sociology and Anthropology in Canada.  D. Harrison, W.K. Carroll, L. Christiansen-Ruffman and Raymond Currie (eds.) | publisher=Carleton University Press | year=1992 | location=Ottawa, Ontario, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnographers are participant observers. They take part in events they study because it helps with understanding local behavior and thought. Classic examples are [[Carol B. Stack]]'s ''All Our Kin'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stack |first=Carol B. | title=All Our Kin:Strategies for Survival in a black community | publisher=Harper and Row | year=1974 | location=New York, New York | isbn=0-06-013974-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Briggs' ''Never in Anger'', [[Richard Borshay Lee|Richard Lee]]'s ''Kalahari Hunter-Gatherers'', [[Victor Turner]]'s ''Forest of Symbols'', David Maybry-Lewis' ''Akew-Shavante Society'', [[E.E. Evans-Pritchard]]'s ''The Nuer,'' and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]' ''[[Tristes Tropiques]]''. Iterations of ethnographic representations in the classic, modernist camp include Joseph W. Bastien's "Drum and Stethoscope" (1992), Bartholomew Dean's recent (2009) contribution, ''Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07 |title=University Press of Florida: Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia |publisher=Upf.com |date=2009-11-15 |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical ethnography attempts to be [[holistic]]&lt;ref name="Ember 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heider, Karl 2001"/&gt; and typically follows an outline to include a brief history of the culture in question, an analysis of the [[physical geography]] or terrain inhabited by the people under study, including [[climate]], and often including what biological anthropologists call [[habitat]]. Folk notions of botany and zoology are presented as ethnobotany and ethnozoology alongside references from the formal sciences. Material culture, technology, and means of subsistence are usually treated next, as they are typically bound up in physical geography and include descriptions of infrastructure.  Kinship and social structure (including age grading, peer groups, gender, voluntary associations, clans, moieties, and so forth, if they exist) are typically included. Languages spoken, dialects, and the history of language change are another group of standard topics.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Ember and Ember 2006, Heider 2001 op cit.&lt;/ref&gt;  Practices of childrearing, acculturation, and emic views on personality and values usually follow after sections on social structure.&lt;ref&gt;Ember and Ember 2006, op cit., Chapters 7 and 8&lt;/ref&gt; Rites, rituals, and other evidence of religion have long been an interest and are sometimes central to ethnographies, especially when conducted in public where visiting anthropologists can see them.&lt;ref&gt;Truner, Victor. ''The Forest of Symbols''.  remainder of citation forthcoming&lt;/ref&gt;

As ethnography developed, anthropologists grew more interested in less tangible aspects of culture, such as values, worldview and what [[Clifford Geertz]] termed the "ethos" of the culture. In his fieldwork, Geertz used elements of a [[Empirical research|phenomenological]] approach, tracing not just the doings of people, but the cultural elements themselves. For example, if within a group of people, winking was a communicative gesture, he sought to first determine what kinds of things a wink might mean (it might mean several things). Then, he sought to determine in what contexts winks were used, and whether, as one moved about a region, winks remained meaningful in the same way. In this way, cultural boundaries of communication could be explored, as opposed to using linguistic boundaries or notions about the residence. Geertz, while still following something of a traditional ethnographic outline, moved outside that outline to talk about "webs" instead of "outlines"&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Clifford. ''The Interpretation of Culture,'' Chapter one.&lt;/ref&gt; of culture.

Within cultural anthropology, there are several subgenres of ethnography.  Beginning in the 1950s and early 1960s, anthropologists began writing "bio-confessional" ethnographies that intentionally exposed the nature of ethnographic research.  Famous examples include ''[[Tristes Tropiques]]'' (1955) by Lévi-Strauss, ''The High Valley'' by Kenneth Read, and ''The Savage and the Innocent'' by [[David Maybury-Lewis]], as well as the mildly fictionalized ''Return to Laughter'' by Elenore Smith Bowen ([[Laura Bohannan]]).

Later "[[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexive]]" ethnographies refined the technique to translate cultural differences by representing their effects on the ethnographer.  Famous examples include ''Deep Play:  Notes on a Balinese Cockfight'' by [[Clifford Geertz]],  ''Reflections on Fieldwork in Morocco'' by [[Paul Rabinow]], ''The Headman and I'' by Jean-Paul Dumont, and ''Tuhami'' by Vincent Crapanzano.  In the 1980s, the rhetoric of ethnography was subjected to intense scrutiny within the discipline, under the general influence of [[literary theory]] and [[postcolonial|post-colonial]]/[[post-structuralist]] thought.  "Experimental" ethnographies that reveal the ferment of the discipline include ''Shamanism, Colonialism, and the Wild Man'' by [[Michael Taussig]], ''Debating Muslims'' by Michael F. J. Fischer and Mehdi Abedi, ''A Space on the Side of the Road'' by Kathleen Stewart, and ''Advocacy after Bhopal'' by Kim Fortun.

This critical turn in sociocultural anthropology during the mid-1980s can be traced to the influence of the now classic (and often contested) text, ''Writing Culture: The Poetics and Politics of Ethnography'', (1986) edited by [[James Clifford (historian)|James Clifford]] and [[George E. Marcus|George Marcus]]. ''Writing Culture'' helped bring changes to both anthropology and ethnography often described in terms of being 'postmodern,' 'reflexive,' 'literary,' 'deconstructive,' or 'poststructural' in nature, in that the text helped to highlight the various epistemic and political predicaments that many practitioners saw as plaguing ethnographic representations and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Olaf Zenker &amp; Karsten Kumoll. ''Beyond Writing Culture: Current Intersections of Epistemologies and Representational Practices.'' (2010). New York: Berghahn Books. {{ISBN|978-1-84545-675-7}}. Pgs. 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Where Geertz's and [[Victor Turner|Turner's]] interpretive anthropology recognized subjects as creative actors who constructed their sociocultural worlds out of symbols, postmodernists attempted to draw attention to the privileged status of the ethnographers themselves. That is, the ethnographer cannot escape the personal viewpoint in creating an ethnographic account, thus making any claims of objective neutrality highly problematic, if not altogether impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Erickson &amp; Liam D. Murphy. ''A History of Anthropological Theory,'' Third Edition. (2008). Toronto: Broadview Press. {{ISBN|978-1-55111-871-0}}. Pg. 190&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to this last point, ''Writing Culture'' became a focal point for looking at how ethnographers could describe different cultures and societies without denying the subjectivity of those individuals and groups being studied while simultaneously doing so without laying claim to absolute knowledge and objective authority.&lt;ref&gt;Erickson &amp; Murphy (2008). A History of Anthropological Theory, Pgs. 190-191&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the development of experimental forms such as 'dialogic anthropology,' 'narrative ethnography,'&lt;ref&gt;Kristen Ghodsee, "Writing Ethnographies that Ordinary People Can Read." {{cite web |url=http://www.anthropology-news.org/index.php/2013/05/24/writing-ethnographies-that-ordinary-people-can-read/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227060610/http://www.anthropology-news.org/index.php/2013/05/24/writing-ethnographies-that-ordinary-people-can-read/ |archivedate=2013-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 'literary ethnography',&lt;ref&gt;Literary Ethnography http://literary-ethnography.tumblr.com/&lt;/ref&gt; ''Writing Culture'' helped to encourage the development of 'collaborative ethnography.'&lt;ref name="ZenkerKumoll"&gt;Olaf Zenker &amp; Karsten Kumoll.

Pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; This exploration of the relationship between writer, audience, and subject has become a central tenet of contemporary anthropological and ethnographic practice. In certain instances, active collaboration between the researcher(s) and subject(s) has helped blend the practice of collaboration in ethnographic fieldwork with the process of creating the ethnographic product resulting from the research.&lt;ref name="ZenkerKumoll"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luke E.

Lassiter. "Collaborative Ethnography and Public Anthropology". (2005). ''Current Anthropology,'' 46(1):83-106&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology===
{{Sociology}}
[[Sociology]] is another field which prominently features ethnographies. [[Urban sociology]], Atlanta University (now Clark-Atlanta University), and the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School,]] in particular, are associated with ethnographic research, with some well-known early examples being ''[[The Philadelphia Negro]]'' (1899) by W. E. B. Du Bois, ''[[Street Corner Society]]'' by [[William Foote Whyte]] and ''[[Black Metropolis]]'' by [[St. Clair Drake]] and [[Horace R. Cayton, Jr.]]. Major influences on this development were anthropologist [[Lloyd Warner]], on the Chicago sociology faculty, and to [[Robert E. Park|Robert Park]]'s experience as a journalist. [[Symbolic interactionism]] developed from the same tradition and yielded such sociological ethnographies as ''Shared Fantasy'' by [[Gary Alan Fine]], which documents the early history of fantasy [[role-playing games]].  Other important ethnographies in sociology include [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s work on Algeria and France.

Jaber F. Gubrium's series of organizational ethnographies focused on the everyday practices of illness, care, and recovery are notable.  They include ''Living and Dying at Murray Manor,'' which describes the social worlds of a nursing home; ''Describing Care: Image and Practice in Rehabilitation,'' which documents the social organization of patient subjectivity in a physical rehabilitation hospital; ''Caretakers: Treating Emotionally Disturbed Children,'' which features the social construction of behavioral disorders in children; and ''Oldtimers and Alzheimer's: The Descriptive Organization of Senility,'' which describes how the Alzheimer's disease movement constructed a new subjectivity of senile dementia and how that is organized in a geriatric hospital. Another approach to ethnography in sociology comes in the form of [[institutional ethnography]], developed by [[Dorothy E. Smith]] for studying the social relations which structure people's everyday lives.

Other notable ethnographies include [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]]'s ''Learning to Labour,'' on working class youth; the work of [[Elijah Anderson]], [[Mitchell Duneier]], and [[Loïc Wacquant]] on black America, and Lai Olurode's ''Glimpses of Madrasa From Africa''.  But even though many sub-fields and theoretical perspectives within sociology use ethnographic methods, ethnography is not the ''[[sine qua non]]'' of the discipline, as it is in cultural anthropology.

=== Communication Studies ===
Beginning in the 1960s and 1970s, ethnographic research methods began to be widely used by communication scholars. As the purpose of ethnography is to describe and interpret the shared and learned patterns of values, behaviors, beliefs, and language of a culture-sharing group, Harris, (1968), also Agar (1980) note that ethnography is both a process and an outcome of the research. Studies such as [[Gerry Philipsen|Gerry Philipsen's]] analysis of cultural communication strategies in a [[blue-collar]], working-class neighborhood on the south side of Chicago, ''Speaking 'Like a Man' in Teamsterville'', paved the way for the expansion of ethnographic research in the study of communication.

Scholars of [[communication studies]] use ethnographic research methods to analyze communicative behaviors and phenomena. This is often characterized in the writing as attempts to understand taken-for-granted routines by which working definitions are socially produced. Ethnography as a method is a storied, careful, and systematic examination of the reality-generating mechanisms of everyday life (Coulon, 1995). Ethnographic work in communication studies seeks to explain "how" ordinary methods/practices/performances construct the ordinary actions used by ordinary people in the accomplishments of their identities. This often gives the perception of trying to answer the "why" and "how come" questions of human communication.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, R. B., Rubin, A. M., and Piele, L. J. (2005). ''Communication Research: Strategies and Sources.'' Belmont, California: Thomson Wadworth. pp. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;  Often this type of research results in a [[case study]] or [[field study]] such as an analysis of speech patterns at a protest rally, or the way firemen communicate during "down time" at a fire station.  Like anthropology scholars, communication scholars often immerse themselves, and participate in and/or directly observe the particular [[social group]] being studied.&lt;ref&gt;Bentz, V. M., and Shapiro, J. J. (1998). ''Mindful Inquiry in Social Research.'' Thousand Oaks, California: Sage. pp. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other fields===
The American anthropologist [[George Spindler]] was a pioneer in applying the ethnographic methodology to the classroom.

Anthropologists such as [[Daniel Miller (anthropologist)|Daniel Miller]] and [[Mary Douglas]] have used ethnographic data to answer academic questions about consumers and consumption.  In this sense, Tony Salvador, [[Genevieve Bell]], and Ken Anderson describe design ethnography as being "a way of understanding the particulars of daily life in such a way as to increase the success probability of a new product or service or, more appropriately, to reduce the probability of failure specifically due to a lack of understanding of the basic behaviors and frameworks of consumers."&lt;ref&gt;Salvador, Tony; Genevieve Bell; and Ken Anderson (1999) "Design Ethnography," ''Design Management Journal'' (pp. 35-41). p.37&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Sam Ladner argues in her book,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Ethnography-Guide-Private-Sector/dp/1611323908/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1396459593&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sam+ladner] ''Practical Ethnography''&lt;/ref&gt; that understanding consumers and their desires requires a shift in "standpoint," one that only ethnography provides. The results are products and services that respond to consumers' unmet needs.

Businesses, too, have found ethnographers helpful for understanding how people use products and services. Companies make increasing use of ethnographic methods to understand consumers and consumption, or for new product development (such as [[video ethnography]]). The ''Ethnographic Praxis in Industry'' (EPIC) conference is evidence of this. Ethnographers' systematic and holistic approach to real-life experience is valued by product developers, who use the method to understand unstated desires or cultural practices that surround products. Where focus groups fail to inform marketers about what people really do, ethnography links what people say to what they do—avoiding the pitfalls that come from relying only on self-reported, focus-group data. Modern developments in computing power and AI have enabled higher efficiencies in ethnographic data collection via multimedia and computational analysis using machine learning.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon A, Liu Y, Setchi R. [http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=2592105 Computer-Aided Ethnography in Engineering Design]. ASME. International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference, Volume 7: 28th International Conference on Design Theory and Methodology ():V007T06A007. doi:10.1115/DETC2016-59832.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluating ethnography ==
The Ethnographic methodology is not usually evaluated in terms of philosophical standpoint (such as [[positivism]] and [[Appearance emotionalism|emotionalism]]). Ethnographic studies need to be evaluated in some manner.  No consensus has been developed on evaluation standards, but Richardson (2000, p.&amp;nbsp;254)&lt;ref&gt;Richardson,L. (2000). "Evaluating ethnography," in ''Qualitative Inquiry,'' 6(2), 253-255&lt;/ref&gt;  provides five criteria that ethnographers might find helpful. Jaber F. Gubrium and James A. Holstein's (1997) monograph, ''The New Language of Qualitative Method,'' discusses forms of ethnography in terms of their "methods talk."

# ''Substantive contribution'': "Does the piece contribute to our understanding of social life?"
# ''Aesthetic merit'': "Does this piece succeed aesthetically?"
# ''Reflexivity'': "How did the author come to write this text…Is there adequate self-awareness and self-exposure for the reader to make judgments about the point of view?"&lt;ref&gt;For post-colonial critiques of ethnography from various locations, see essays in Prem Poddar et al, ''Historical Companion to Postcolonial Literatures--Continental Europe and its Empires,'' Edinburgh University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Impact'': "Does this affect me? Emotionally? Intellectually?"  Does it move me?
# ''Expresses a reality'': "Does it seem 'true'—a credible account of a cultural, social, individual, or communal sense of the 'real'?"

==Challenges of ethnography==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2015}}
Ethnography, which is a method dedicated entirely to field work, is aimed at gaining a deeper insight of a certain people's knowledge and social culture.

Ethnography's advantages are:
* It can open up certain experiences during group research that other research methods fail to cover.
* Notions that are taken for granted can be highlighted and confronted.
* It can tap into intuitive and deep human understanding of and interpretations of (by the ethnographer) the accounts of informants (those who are being studied), which goes far beyond what quantitative research can do in terms of extracting meanings.
* Ethnography allows people outside of a culture (whether of a primitive tribe or of a corporation's employees) to learn about its members' practices, motives, understandings, and values.

However, there are certain challenges or limitations for the ethnographic method: 
* Deep expertise is required: Ethnographers must accumulate knowledge about the methods and domains of interest, which can take considerable training and time.
* Sensitivity: The ethnographer is an outsider and must exercise discretion and caution to avoid offending, alienating or harming those being observed.
* Access: Negotiating access to field sites and participants can be time-consuming and difficult. Secretive or guarded organizations may require different approaches in order for researchers to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |last=Monahan |first=Torin, Fisher, Jill A. | year = 2014 | title = Strategies for Obtaining Access to Secretive or Guarded Organizations | journal = Journal of Contemporary Ethnography | doi=10.1177/0891241614549834|pmc=4679148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Duration and cost: Research can involve prolonged time in the field, particularly because building trust with participants is usually necessary for obtaining rich data.
* Bias: Ethnographers bring their own experience to bear in pursuing questions to ask and reviewing data, which can lead to biases in directions of inquiry and analysis.
* Descriptive approach:  Ethnography relies heavily on storytelling and the presentation of critical incidents, which is inevitably selective and viewed as a weakness by those used to the scientific approaches of hypothesis testing, quantification and replication.

Among the dangers of ethnography are that it can become indistinguishable from a kind of [[embedded journalism]] or [[blog]] with academic jargon giving it the veneer of academic legitimacy but without actually meeting the classic requirements for ethnography.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, B. (2013).  "Post-Cold War Anthropology as  Ideological Blog:  Purging Klukhohn and Mead for a Diary Read",  ''Journal of Developing Societies'', Spring, Volume 29, No. 1, 61-87.  &lt;/ref&gt;  A series of tests can be applied to determine whether work is actually ethnography or academic journalism depending on the focus of the study (an "ethnos"), the scientific hypotheses and questions, whether there is model building, whether there are cross-cultural comparisons, and the purpose, uses and forms of the work.

==Ethics==
[[Gary Alan Fine]] argues that the nature of ethnographic inquiry demands that researchers deviate from formal and idealistic rules or ethics that have come to be widely accepted in qualitative and quantitative approaches in research. Many of these ethical assumptions are rooted in positivist and post-positivist [[epistemology|epistemologies]] that have adapted over time but are apparent and must be accounted for in all research paradigms. These ethical dilemmas are evident throughout the entire process of conducting ethnographies, including the design, implementation, and reporting of an ethnographic study. Essentially, Fine maintains that researchers are typically not as ethical as they claim or assume to be — and that "each job includes ways of doing things that would be inappropriate for others to know".&lt;ref&gt;Fine, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

Fine is not necessarily casting blame at ethnographic researchers but tries to show that researchers often make idealized ethical claims and standards which in are inherently based on partial truths and self-deceptions. Fine also acknowledges that many of these partial truths and self-deceptions are unavoidable. He maintains that "illusions" are essential to maintain an occupational reputation and avoid potentially more caustic consequences. He claims, "Ethnographers cannot help but lie, but in lying, we reveal truths that escape those who are not so bold".&lt;ref&gt;Fine, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these assertions, Fine establishes three conceptual clusters in which ethnographic ethical dilemmas can be situated: "Classic Virtues", "Technical Skills", and "Ethnographic Self".

Much debate surrounding the issue of ethics arose following revelations about how the ethnographer [[Napoleon Chagnon]] conducted his ethnographic fieldwork with the [[Yanomani]] people of South America.

While there is no international standard on Ethnographic Ethics, many western anthropologists look to the American Anthropological Association for guidance when conducting ethnographic work.&lt;ref&gt;''American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics'' http://www.aaanet.org/issues/policy-advocacy/upload/AAA-Ethics-Code-2009.pdf, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the Association adopted a code of ethics, stating: Anthropologists have "moral obligations as members of other groups, such as the family, religion, and community, as well as the profession".&lt;ref name="Ethics p.1"&gt;American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; The code of ethics notes that anthropologists are part of a wider scholarly and political network, as well as human and natural environment, which needs to be reported on respectfully.&lt;ref name="Ethics p.1"/&gt; The code of ethics recognizes that sometimes very close and personal relationship can sometimes develop from doing ethnographic work.&lt;ref name="Ethics p.1"/&gt; The Association acknowledges that the code is limited in scope; ethnographic work can sometimes be multidisciplinary, and anthropologists need to be familiar with ethics and perspectives of other disciplines as well.&lt;ref&gt;American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;  The eight-page code of ethics outlines ethical considerations for those conducting Research, Teaching, Application and Dissemination of Results, which are briefly outlined below.&lt;ref&gt;American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.1-8&lt;/ref&gt;

* "Conducting Research" - When conducting research Anthropologists need to be aware of the potential impacts of the research on the people and animals they study.&lt;ref name="Ethics p.2-3"&gt;American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.2-3&lt;/ref&gt;  If the seeking of new knowledge will negatively impact the people and animals they will be studying they may not undertake the study according to the code of ethics.&lt;ref name="Ethics p.2-3"/&gt;
* "Teaching" - When teaching the discipline of anthropology, instructors are required to inform students of the ethical dilemmas of conducting ethnographies and field work.&lt;ref&gt;American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Application" - When conducting an ethnography, Anthropologists must be "open with funders, colleagues, persons studied or providing information, and relevant parties affected by the work about the purpose(s), potential impacts, and source(s) of support for the work."&lt;ref name="Ethics p.5"&gt;American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Dissemination of Results" - When disseminating results of an ethnography, "[a]nthropologists have an ethical obligation to consider the potential impact of both their research and the communication or dissemination of the results of their research on all directly or indirectly involved."&lt;ref&gt;American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.5-6&lt;/ref&gt;  Research results of ethnographies should not be withheld from participants in the research if that research is being observed by other people.&lt;ref name="Ethics p.5"/&gt;

===Classic virtues===
* "The kindly ethnographer" – Most ethnographers present themselves as being more sympathetic than they are, which aids in the research process, but is also deceptive. The identity that we present to subjects is different from who we are in other circumstances.
* "The friendly ethnographer" – Ethnographers operate under the assumption that they should not dislike anyone. When ethnographers find they intensely dislike individuals encountered in the research, they may crop them out of the findings.&lt;ref name="Fine"&gt;Fine, p. 270-77&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The honest ethnographer" – If research participants know the research goals, their responses will likely be skewed. Therefore, ethnographers often conceal what they know in order to increase the likelihood of acceptance by participants.&lt;ref name="Fine" /&gt;

===Technical skills===
* "The Precise Ethnographer" – Ethnographers often create the illusion that field notes are data and reflect what "really" happened. They engage in the opposite of plagiarism, giving undeserved credit through loose interpretations and paraphrasing. Researchers take near-fictions and turn them into claims of fact. The closest ethnographers can ever really get to reality is an approximate truth.
* "The Observant Ethnographer" – Readers of ethnography are often led to assume the report of a scene is complete – that little of importance was missed. In reality, an ethnographer will always miss some aspect because of lacking omniscience. Everything is open to multiple interpretations and misunderstandings. As ethnographers' skills in observation and collection of data vary by individual, what is depicted in ethnography can never be the whole picture.
* "The Unobtrusive Ethnographer" – As a "participant" in the scene, the researcher will always have an effect on the communication that occurs within the research site. The degree to which one is an "active member" affects the extent to which sympathetic understanding is possible.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, p. 277-81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnographic Self===
The following are commonly misconceived conceptions of ethnographers:

* "The Candid Ethnographer" – Where the researcher personally situates within the ethnography is ethically problematic. There is an illusion that everything reported was observed by the researcher.
* "The Chaste Ethnographer" – When ethnographers participate within the field, they invariably develop relationships with research subjects/participants. These relationships are sometimes not accounted for within the reporting of the ethnography, although they may influence the research findings.
* "The Fair Ethnographer" – Fine claims that objectivity is an illusion and that everything in ethnography is known from a perspective. Therefore, it is unethical for a researcher to report fairness in findings.
* "The Literary Ethnographer" – Representation is a balancing act of determining what to "show" through poetic/prosaic language and style, versus what to "tell" via straightforward, 'factual' reporting. The individual skills of an ethnographer influence what appears to be the value of the research.&lt;ref name="Fine, p. 282-89"&gt;Fine, p. 282-89&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Norman K. Denzin, ethnographers should consider the following eight principles when observing, recording, and sampling data:

# The groups should combine symbolic meanings with patterns of interaction.
# Observe the world from the point of view of the subject, while maintaining the distinction between everyday and scientific perceptions of reality.
# Link the group's symbols and their meanings with the social relationships.
# Record all behavior.
# The methodology should highlight phases of process, change, and stability.
# The act should be a type of symbolic interactionism.
# Use concepts that would avoid casual explanations.

'''Graduate Medical Program (GMP)''' or sometimes also known as '''[[Graduate Entry|Graduate Entry Program (GEP)]]''' or '''[[Graduate Entry|Graduate Entry Medicine (GEM)]]''' are terms generally used outside of the United States to refer to medical programs usually of 4-years duration where applicants are [[university]] graduates who have taken aptitude tests such as the [[GAMSAT]], [[UKCAT]] or [[MCAT]]. These tests are not to be confused with tests such as the [[UMAT]] since tests such as the [[UMAT]] are designed for high school graduates. Medical programs in the United States technically do not require the completion of a previous degree, but do require the completion of 2–3 years of pre-medical sciences at the university level and so are thus classified as [[Second entry degree]]s. However, since in places such as [[Australia]] medical applicants were historically generally high school graduates and only recently have medical schools changed to requiring the completion of a previous [[bachelor's degree]], the terms '''Graduate Medical Program''' and '''Graduate Entry Medicine''' arose to differentiate the new courses.

'''Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning''' ('''HVAC'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |chapter-url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hvac |contribution=HVAC |title=Merriam–Webster Dictionary |accessdate=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the technology of indoor and vehicular environmental comfort. Its goal is to provide [[thermal comfort]] and acceptable [[indoor air quality]]. HVAC system design is a subdiscipline of [[mechanical engineering]], based on the principles of [[thermodynamics]], [[fluid mechanics]] and [[heat transfer]]. "[[Refrigeration]]" is sometimes added to the field's abbreviation, as '''HVAC&amp;R''' or '''HVACR''' or "ventilation" is dropped, as in '''HACR''' (as in the designation of HACR-rated [[circuit breaker]]s).

HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single family homes, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to large industrial and office buildings such as [[skyscraper]]s and hospitals, on ships and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and [[Sick building syndrome|healthy building]] conditions are regulated with respect to temperature and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.

Ventilating or [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] (the ''V'' in HVAC)  is the process of exchanging or replacing air in any space to provide high indoor air quality which involves temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation removes unpleasant smells and excessive moisture, introduces outside air, keeps interior building air circulating, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.

Ventilation includes both the exchange of air to the outside as well as circulation of air within the building. It is one of the most important factors for maintaining acceptable indoor air quality in buildings. Methods for ventilating a building may be divided into ''mechanical/forced'' and ''[[Natural ventilation|natural]]'' types.&lt;ref&gt;Ventilation and Infiltration chapter, Fundamentals volume of the ''[[ASHRAE Handbook]]'', ASHRAE, Inc., Atlanta, GA, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The three major functions of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning are interrelated, especially with the need to provide thermal comfort and acceptable indoor air quality within reasonable installation, operation, and maintenance costs. HVAC systems can be used in both domestic and commercial environments. HVAC systems can provide ventilation, and maintain pressure relationships between spaces. The means of air delivery and removal from spaces is known as [[room air distribution]].&lt;ref name="Rock and Zhu"&gt;''Designer's Guide to Ceiling-Based Air Diffusion'', Rock and Zhu, [[ASHRAE]], Inc., [[New York (state)|New York]], 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Individual systems ===
In modern buildings, the design, installation, and [[HVAC control system|control system]]s of these functions are integrated into one or more HVAC systems. For very small buildings, contractors normally estimate the capacity and type of system needed and then design the system, selecting the appropriate refrigerant and various components needed. For larger buildings, building service designers, mechanical engineers, or [[Building engineering|building services]] engineers analyze, design, and specify the HVAC systems. Specialty mechanical contractors then fabricate and commission the systems. Building permits and code-compliance inspections of the installations are normally required for all sizes of building.

=== District networks ===
Although HVAC is executed in individual buildings or other enclosed spaces (like [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD's]] underground headquarters), the equipment involved is in some cases an extension of a larger [[district heating]] (DH) or [[district cooling]] (DC) network, or a combined DHC network. In such cases, the operating and maintenance aspects are simplified and metering becomes necessary to bill for the energy that is consumed, and in some cases energy that is returned to the larger system. For example, at a given time one building may be utilizing chilled water for air conditioning and the warm water it returns may be used in another building for heating, or for the overall heating-portion of the DHC network (likely with energy added to boost the temperature).&lt;ref&gt;Rezaie B., Rosen M.A. (2012).

== History ==
{{see also|Air conditioning#History}}
HVAC is based on inventions and discoveries made by [[Nikolay Lvov]], [[Michael Faraday]], [[Willis Carrier]], [[Edwin Ruud]], [[Reuben Trane]], [[James Joule]], [[William Rankine]], [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Swenson | first=S. Don | title=HVAC: heating, ventilating, and air conditioning | year=1995 | publisher=American Technical Publishers | location=Homewood, Illinois | isbn=978-0-8269-0675-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple inventions within this time frame preceded the beginnings of first comfort air conditioning system, which was designed in 1902 by Alfred Wolff (Cooper, 2003) for the New York Stock Exchange, while Willis Carrier equipped the Sacketts-Wilhems Printing Company with the process AC unit the same year. Coyne College was the first school to offer HVAC training in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Heating, Air Conditioning &amp; Refrigeration|url=https://www.coynecollege.edu/programs/hvac|website=Coyne College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the components of HVAC systems went hand-in-hand with the [[industrial revolution]], and new methods of modernization, higher efficiency, and system control are constantly being introduced by companies and inventors worldwide.

== Heating ==
{{main|Central heating}}
{{Redirect|Heater}}
Heaters are appliances whose purpose is to generate heat (i.e. warmth) for the building. This can be done via [[central heating]]. Such a system contains a [[boiler]], [[furnace]], or [[heat pump]] to heat water, steam, or air in a central location such as a [[furnace room]] in a home, or a [[mechanical room]] in a large building. The heat can be transferred by [[convection]], conduction, or [[radiation]].

=== Generation ===
[[File:Panna.jpg|thumb|upright|Central heating unit]]
Heaters exist for various types of fuel, including [[Fuel#Solid fuel|solid fuels]], [[Fuel#Liquid fuel|liquids]], and [[Fuel#Gaseous fuels|gases]]. Another type of heat source is [[Electric heating|electricity]], normally heating ribbons composed of high resistance wire (see [[Nichrome]]). This principle is also used for baseboard heaters and [[Space heater|portable heaters]]. Electrical heaters are often used as backup or supplemental heat for heat pump systems.

The heat pump gained popularity in the 1950s in Japan and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Iain_Staffell/publication/255759857_A_review_of_domestic_heat_pumps/links/0c96052a39c98d9227000000.pdf 9291&lt;/ref&gt; Heat pumps can extract heat from [[Heat pump#Heat sources and sinks|various sources]], such as environmental air, exhaust air from a building, or from the ground. Initially, heat pump HVAC systems were only used in moderate climates, but with improvements in low temperature operation and reduced loads due to more efficient homes, they are increasing in popularity in cooler climates.

=== Distribution ===

==== Water/steam ====
In the case of heated water or steam, piping is used to transport the heat to the rooms. Most modern hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move hot water through the distribution system (as opposed to older [[Water heating#Gravity-fed system|gravity-fed systems]]). The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air using [[radiator (heating)|radiator]]s, hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be mounted on walls or installed within the floor to produce floor heat.

The use of water as the heat transfer medium is known as [[hydronics]]. The heated water can also supply an auxiliary heat exchanger to supply hot water for bathing and washing.

==== Air ====
Warm air systems distribute heated air through duct work systems of supply and return air through metal or fiberglass ducts. Many systems use the same ducts to distribute air cooled by an evaporator coil for air conditioning. The air supply is normally filtered through air cleaners to remove dust and pollen particles.

=== Dangers ===
The use of furnaces, space heaters, and boilers as a method of indoor heating could result in incomplete combustion and the emission of [[carbon monoxide]], [[NOx|nitrogen oxides]], [[formaldehyde]], [[volatile organic compound]]s, and other combustion byproducts. Incomplete combustion occurs when there is insufficient oxygen; the inputs are fuels containing various contaminants and the outputs are harmful byproducts, most dangerously carbon monoxide, which is a tasteless and odorless gas with serious adverse health effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bearg | first=David W. | title=Indoor Air Quality and HVAC Systems | year=1993 | publisher=Lewis Publishers | location=New York | pages=107–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without proper ventilation, carbon monoxide can be lethal at concentrations of 1000 ppm (0.1%). However, at several hundred ppm, carbon monoxide exposure induces headaches, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Carbon monoxide binds with hemoglobin in the blood, forming carboxyhemoglobin, reducing the blood's ability to transport oxygen. The primary health concerns associated with carbon monoxide exposure are its cardiovascular and neurobehavioral effects. Carbon monoxide can cause atherosclerosis (the hardening of arteries) and can also trigger heart attacks. Neurologically, carbon monoxide exposure reduces hand to eye coordination, vigilance, and continuous performance. It can also affect time discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Dianat, Nazari | first=I,I | title=Characteristic of unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning in Northwest Iran- Tabriz | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/ | publisher=International Journal of Injury Control and Promotion | accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ventilation==
{{Main|Ventilation (architecture)}}
Ventilation is the process of changing or replacing air in any space to control temperature or remove any combination of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, or carbon dioxide, and to replenish oxygen. Ventilation includes both the exchange of air with the outside as well as circulation of air within the building. It is one of the most important factors for maintaining acceptable indoor air quality in buildings. Methods for ventilating a building may be divided into ''mechanical/forced'' and ''natural'' types.&lt;ref&gt;Ventilation and Infiltration chapter, Fundamentals volume of the ''ASHRAE Handbook'', ASHRAE, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mechanical or forced ventilation ===
[[File:HVAC Ventilation Exhaust.jpg|thumb|HVAC ventilation exhaust for a 12-story building]]
Mechanical, or forced, ventilation is provided by an [[air handler]] (AHU) and used to control indoor air quality. Excess [[humidity]], odors, and contaminants can often be controlled via dilution or replacement with outside air. However, in humid climates more energy is required to remove excess moisture from ventilation air.

Kitchens and bathrooms typically have mechanical exhausts to control odors and sometimes humidity. Factors in the design of such systems include the flow rate (which is a function of the fan speed and exhaust vent size) and noise level. [[Direct drive mechanism|Direct drive]] fans are available for many applications, and can reduce maintenance needs.

Ceiling [[Fan (mechanical)|fans]] and table/floor fans circulate air within a room for the purpose of reducing the perceived temperature by increasing evaporation of perspiration on the skin of the occupants. Because hot air rises, ceiling fans may be used to keep a room warmer in the winter by circulating the warm stratified air from the ceiling to the floor.

=== Natural ventilation ===
[[File:N&amp;AMOV - Schoolroom - Impulsion.png|thumb|Ventilation on the [[downdraught]] system, by impulsion, or the [[Plenum space|'plenum' principle]], applied to schoolrooms (1899)]]
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Chimney]] --&gt;
Natural ventilation is the ventilation of a building with outside air without using fans or other mechanical systems. It can be via operable windows, louvers, or [[trickle vent]]s when spaces are small and the architecture permits. In more complex schemes, warm air is allowed to rise and flow out high building openings to the outside ([[stack effect]]), causing cool outside air to be drawn into low building openings. Natural ventilation schemes can use very little energy, but care must be taken to ensure comfort. In warm or humid climates, maintaining thermal comfort solely via natural ventilation might not be possible. [[Air conditioning]] systems are used, either as backups or supplements. Air-side [[Economizer#HVAC|economizers]] also use outside air to condition spaces, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outdoor air when appropriate.

An important component of natural ventilation is air change rate or [[air changes per hour]]: the hourly rate of ventilation divided by the volume of the space. For example, six air changes per hour means an amount of new air, equal to the volume of the space, is added every ten minutes. For human comfort, a minimum of four air changes per hour is typical, though warehouses might have only two. Too high of an air change rate may be uncomfortable, akin to a [[wind tunnel]] which have thousands of changes per hour. The highest air change rates are for crowded spaces, bars, night clubs, commercial kitchens at around 30 to 50 air changes per hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Room pressure can be either positive or negative with respect to outside the room. Positive pressure occurs when there is more air being supplied than exhausted, and is common to reduce the infiltration of outside contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Bell | first=Geoffrey | title=Room Air Change Rate | url=http://ateam.lbl.gov/Design-Guide/DGHtm/roomairchangerates.htm | publisher=A Design Guide for Energy-Efficient Research Laboratories | accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Airborne diseases====
Natural ventilation is a key factor in reducing the spread of airborne illnesses such as tuberculosis, the common cold, influenza and meningitis. Opening doors, windows, and using ceiling fans are all ways to maximize natural ventilation and reduce the risk of airborne contagion. Natural ventilation requires little maintenance and is inexpensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Escombe |first=A. R. |last2=Oeser |first2=C. C. |last3=Gilman |first3=R. H. |title=Natural ventilation for the prevention of airborne contagion |journal=PLoS Med |year=2007 |volume=4 |issue=68 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040068|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Air conditioning ==
{{Main|Air conditioning}}
An air conditioning system, or a standalone air conditioner, provides cooling and [[Air conditioning#Humidity control|humidity control]] for all or part of a building. Air conditioned buildings often have sealed windows, because open windows would work against the system intended to maintain constant indoor air conditions. Outside, fresh air is generally drawn into the system by a vent into the indoor heat exchanger section, creating positive air pressure. The percentage of return air made up of fresh air can usually be manipulated by adjusting the opening of this vent. Typical fresh air intake is about 10%.

Air conditioning and refrigeration are provided through the removal of heat. Heat can be removed through [[thermal radiation|radiation]], convection, or [[Thermal conduction|conduction]]. Refrigeration conduction media such as water, air, ice, and chemicals are referred to as [[refrigerant]]s. A refrigerant is employed either in a heat pump system in which a [[Heat pump and refrigeration cycle|compressor]] is used to drive thermodynamic [[refrigeration cycle]], or in a free cooling system which uses pumps to circulate a cool refrigerant (typically water or a glycol mix).

=== Refrigeration cycle ===
{{main|Heat pump and refrigeration cycle}}
[[File:Heatpump.svg|thumb|A simple stylized diagram of the refrigeration cycle: 1)&amp;nbsp;[[condensing coil]], 2)&amp;nbsp;[[thermal expansion valve|expansion valve]], 3)&amp;nbsp;[[evaporator coil]], 4)&amp;nbsp;[[Gas compressor|compressor]]]]
The refrigeration cycle uses four essential elements to cool.
* The system refrigerant starts its cycle in a gaseous state. The '''compressor''' pumps the refrigerant gas up to a high pressure and temperature.
* From there it enters a heat exchanger (sometimes called a '''condensing coil''' or condenser) where it loses energy (heat) to the outside, cools, and condenses into its liquid phase.
* An '''[[thermal expansion valve|expansion valve]]''' (also called metering device) regulates the refrigerant liquid to flow at the proper rate.
* The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is often called an '''evaporating coil''' or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs energy (heat) from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.

In variable climates, the system may include a [[reversing valve]] that switches from heating in winter to cooling in summer. By reversing the flow of refrigerant, the heat pump refrigeration cycle is changed from cooling to heating or vice versa. This allows a facility to be heated and cooled by a single piece of equipment by the same means, and with the same hardware.

=== Free cooling ===
{{main|Free cooling}}
Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a [[heat sink]] when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.

Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the [[enthalpy]] of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.

=== Packaged vs. split system===
Central, "all-air" air-conditioning systems (or package systems) with a combined outdoor condenser/evaporator unit are often installed in North American residences, offices, and public buildings, but are difficult to retrofit (install in a building that was not designed to receive it) because of the bulky air ducts required. (Minisplit ductless systems are used in these situations.) Outside of North America, packaged systems are only used in limited applications involving large indoor space such as stadiums, theatres or exhibition halls.

An alternative to packaged systems is the use of separate indoor and outdoor coils in [[Split-system air conditioner|split systems]]. Split systems are preferred and widely used worldwide except in the North America. In the North America, split systems are most often seen in residential applications, but they are gaining popularity in small commercial buildings.

With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor unit instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.

Split systems are more efficient and the footprint is typically smaller than the package systems. On the other hand, package systems tend to have slightly lower indoor noise level compared to split system since the fan motor is located outside.

=== Dehumidification ===
Dehumidification (air drying) in an air conditioning system is provided by the evaporator. Since the evaporator operates at a temperature below the [[dew point]], moisture in the air condenses on the evaporator coil tubes. This moisture is collected at the bottom of the evaporator in a pan and removed by piping to a central drain or onto the ground outside.

A [[dehumidifier]] is an air-conditioner-like device that controls the humidity of a room or building. It is often employed in basements which have a higher [[relative humidity]] because of their lower temperature (and propensity for damp floors and walls). In food retailing establishments, large open chiller cabinets are highly effective at dehumidifying the internal air. Conversely, a humidifier increases the humidity of a building.

=== Maintenance ===
All modern air conditioning systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauzy material, and must be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.

Because an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both must be kept clean. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.

==Energy efficiency==
Since the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC equipment have been making an effort to make the systems they manufacture more efficient. This was originally driven by rising energy costs, and has more recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental issues. Additionally, improvements to the HVAC system efficiency can also help increase occupant health and productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainable Facilities Tool: HVAC System Overview|url=https://sftool.gov/explore/green-building/section/9/hvac/system-overview|website=sftool.gov|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] has imposed tighter restrictions over the years. There are several methods for making HVAC systems more efficient.

===Heating energy===
In the past, water heating was more efficient for heating buildings and was the standard in the United States. Today, [[forced air]] systems can double for air conditioning and are more popular.

Some benefits of forced air systems, which are now widely used in churches, schools and high-end residences, are
* Better air conditioning effects
* Energy savings of up to 15-20%
* Even conditioning{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
A drawback is the installation cost, which can be slightly higher than traditional HVAC systems.

Energy efficiency can be improved even more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating systems. Zones are controlled by multiple thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats control [[zone valve]]s, and in forced air systems they control [[zone damper]]s inside the vents which selectively block the flow of air. In this case, the control system is very critical to maintaining a proper temperature.

[[Forecasting (heating)|Forecasting]] is another method of controlling building heating by calculating demand for heating energy that should be supplied to the building in each time unit.

===Ground source heat pump===
{{Main|Geothermal heat pump}}
Ground source, or geothermal, heat pumps are similar to ordinary heat pumps, but instead of transferring heat to or from outside air, they rely on the stable, even temperature of the earth to provide heating and air conditioning. Many regions experience seasonal temperature extremes, which would require large-capacity heating and cooling equipment to heat or cool buildings. For example, a conventional heat pump system used to heat a building in Montana's {{convert|-70|°F|°C|lk=on}} low temperature or cool a building in the highest temperature ever recorded in the US—{{convert|134|°F|°C}} in [[Death Valley]], California, in 1913 would require a large amount of energy due to the extreme difference between inside and outside air temperatures. A few feet below the earth's surface, however, the ground remains at a relatively constant temperature. Utilizing this large source of relatively moderate temperature earth, a heating or cooling system's capacity can often be significantly reduced. Although ground temperatures vary according to latitude, at {{convert|6|ft|m}} underground, temperatures generally only range from {{convert|45|to|75|°F|°C}}.

An example of a geothermal heat pump that uses a body of water as the heat sink, is the system used by the [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)|Trump International Hotel and Tower]] in Chicago, Illinois. This building is situated on the [[Chicago River]], and uses cold river water by pumping it into a recirculating cooling system, where heat exchangers transfer heat from the building into the water, and then the now-warmed water is pumped back into the Chicago River.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Future of the City: Tall Buildings and Urban Design|last = Al-Kodmany|first = Kheir|publisher = WIT Press|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1-84564-410-9|location = |pages = 242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While they may be more costly to install than regular heat pumps, geothermal heat pumps can produce markedly lower energy bills – 30 to 40 percent lower, according to estimates from the US Environmental Protection Agency.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Geothermal heat pumps still provide higher efficiency than air source heat pumps. Some models provide 70% saving compared to electric resistance heaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=geothermal heat pumps and power saving|url=https://www.ny-engineers.com/blog/types-of-electric-heat-pumps-and-their-advantages|website=ny-engineers.com|accessdate=30 Dec 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ventilation energy recovery===
[[Energy recovery]] systems sometimes utilize [[heat recovery ventilation]] or [[energy recovery ventilation]] systems that employ [[heat exchanger]]s or [[thermal wheel|enthalpy wheel]]s to recover [[sensible heat|sensible]] or [[latent heat]] from exhausted air. This is done by transfer of energy to the incoming outside fresh air.

===Air conditioning energy===
The performance of vapor compression refrigeration cycles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nuclear-power.net/nuclear-engineering/thermodynamics/thermodynamic-cycles/heating-and-air-conditioning/#Vapor-compression_Cycle_8211_Vapor-compression_Refrigeration|title=Heating and Air Conditioning|website=www.nuclear-power.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; is limited by [[Second law of thermodynamics|thermodynamics]]. These air conditioning and heat pump devices ''move'' heat rather than convert it from one form to another, so ''[[Thermal efficiency|thermal efficiencies]]'' do not appropriately describe the performance of these devices. The Coefficient-of-Performance (COP) measures performance, but this dimensionless measure has not been adopted. Instead, the Energy Efficiency Ratio (''EER'') has traditionally been used to characterize the performance of many HVAC systems. EER is the Energy Efficiency Ratio based on a {{convert|35|C|F}} outdoor temperature. To more accurately describe the performance of air conditioning equipment over a typical cooling season a modified version of the EER, the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (''SEER''), or in Europe the [[ESEER]], is used. SEER ratings are based on seasonal temperature averages instead of a constant {{convert|35|°C}} outdoor temperature. The current industry minimum SEER rating is 14 SEER.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Does SEER Stand For?|url = http://allclimate.net/2014/11/26/seer-stand/|website = allclimate.net|accessdate = 2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineers have pointed out some areas where efficiency of the existing hardware could be improved. For example, the fan blades used to move the air are usually stamped from sheet metal, an economical method of manufacture, but as a result they are not aerodynamically efficient. A well-designed blade could reduce electrical power required to move the air by a third.&lt;ref&gt;Keeping cool and green, ''The Economist'' 17 July 2010, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

==Air filtration and cleaning==
{{Main|Air filter}}
[[File:Air handling unit.JPG|thumb|[[Air handling unit]], used for heating, cooling, and filtering the air]]
Air cleaning and filtration removes particles, contaminants, vapors and gases from the air. The filtered and cleaned air then is used in heating, ventilation and air conditioning. Air cleaning and filtration should be taken in account when protecting our building environments.&lt;ref name="Howard 2003 1–63"&gt;{{citation |last=Howard |first=J |title=Guidance for Filtration and Air-Cleaning Systems to Protect Building Environments from Airborne Chemical, Biological, or Radiological Attacks |publisher=[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] |year=2003 |id=2003-136 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2003-136/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clean air delivery rate and filter performance===
Clean air delivery rate is the amount of clean air an air cleaner provides to a room or space. When determining CADR, the amount of airflow in a space is taken into account. For example, an air cleaner with a flow rate of 100 cfm (cubic feet per minute) and an efficiency of 50% has a CADR of 50 cfm. Along with CADR, filtration performance is very important when it comes to the air in our indoor environment. Filter performance depends on the size of the particle or fiber, the filter packing density and depth and also the air flow rate.&lt;ref name="Howard 2003 1–63"/&gt;

== HVAC industry and standards ==
The HVAC industry is a worldwide enterprise, with roles including operation and maintenance, system design and construction, equipment manufacturing and sales, and in education and research. The HVAC industry was historically regulated by the manufacturers of HVAC equipment, but regulating and standards organizations such as HARDI, [[ASHRAE]], [[SMACNA]], [[Air Conditioning Contractors of America|ACCA]], [[Uniform Mechanical Code]], [[International Building Code|International Mechanical Code]], and [[Air Movement and Controls Association|AMCA]] have been established to support the industry and encourage high standards and achievement.

The starting point in carrying out an estimate both for cooling and heating depends on the exterior climate and interior specified conditions. However, before taking up the heat load calculation, it is necessary to find fresh air requirements for each area in detail, as [[pressurization]] is an important consideration.

=== International ===
[[ISO 16813]]:2006 is one of the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] building environment standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ISO|title=Building environment standards|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_tc_browse.htm?commid=54740|publisher=www.iso.org|accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It establishes the general principles of building environment design. It takes into account the need to provide a healthy indoor environment for the occupants as well as the need to protect the environment for future generations and promote collaboration among the various parties involved in building environmental design for sustainability. ISO16813 is applicable to new construction and the retrofit of existing buildings.&lt;ref name=iso16813&gt;{{cite web | author=ISO | title=Building environment design—Indoor environment—General principles | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=41300 | accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building environmental design standard aims to:&lt;ref name=iso16813 /&gt;

* provide the constraints concerning sustainability issues from the initial stage of the design process, with building and plant life cycle to be considered together with owning and operating costs from the beginning of the design process;
* assess the proposed design with rational criteria for indoor air quality, thermal comfort, acoustical comfort, visual comfort, energy efficiency and HVAC system controls at every stage of the design process;
* iterate decisions and evaluations of the design throughout the design process.

=== North America ===

==== United States ====
{{Main|American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers}}
In the United States, HVAC engineers generally are members of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers ([[ASHRAE]]), EPA Universal [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]] certified (for installation and service of CFC HVAC devices), or locally engineer certified such as a Special to Chief Boilers License issued by the state or, in some jurisdictions, the city. ASHRAE is an international technical society for all individuals and organizations interested in HVAC. The Society, organized into regions, chapters, and student branches, allows exchange of HVAC knowledge and experiences for the benefit of the field's practitioners and the public. ASHRAE provides many opportunities to participate in the development of new knowledge via, for example, research and its many technical committees. These committees typically meet twice per year at the ASHRAE Annual and Winter Meetings. A popular product show, the AHR Expo, is held in conjunction with each winter meeting. The Society has approximately 50,000 members and has headquarters in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].

The most recognized standards for HVAC design are based on ASHRAE data. The most general of four volumes of the ASHRAE Handbook is Fundamentals; it includes heating and cooling calculations. Each volume of the ASHRAE Handbook is updated every four years. The design professional must consult ASHRAE data for the standards of design and care as the typical building codes provide little to no information on HVAC design practices; codes such as the UMC and IMC do include much detail on installation requirements, however. Other useful reference materials include items from [[SMACNA]], [[ACGIH]], and technical trade journals.

American design standards are legislated in the Uniform Mechanical Code or International Mechanical Code. In certain states, counties, or cities, either of these codes may be adopted and amended via various legislative processes. These codes are updated and published by the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials ([[IAPMO]]) or the International Code Council ([[International Code Council|ICC]]) respectively, on a 3-year code development cycle. Typically, local building permit departments are charged with enforcement of these standards on private and certain public properties.

HVAC professionals in the US can receive training through formal training institutions, where most earn [[associate degree]]s. Training for HVAC technicians includes classroom lectures and hands-on tasks, and can be followed by an apprenticeship wherein the recent graduate works alongside a professional HVAC technician for a temporary period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hvactraining.net/training/ |title=HVAC Training |publisher=HVACTraining.net |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; HVAC techs who have been trained can also be certified in areas such as air conditioning, heat pumps, gas heating, and commercial refrigeration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.natex.org/technicians/certification-basics101/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006052206/http://www.natex.org/technicians/certification-basics101/ |archive-date=2011-10-06 |title=Certification basics/101 |publisher=NATE |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===

==== United Kingdom ====
The [[Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers]] is a body that covers the essential [[Service (systems architecture)]] that allow buildings to operate. It includes the electrotechnical, [[heating]], [[ventilating]], air conditioning, refrigeration and [[plumbing]] industries. To [[train]] as a [[Building services engineering|building services engineer]], the [[academic]] requirements are GCSEs (A-C) / Standard Grades (1-3) in Maths and Science, which are important in measurements, planning and theory. Employers will often want a [[academic degree|degree]] in a branch of engineering, such as building environment [[engineering]], electrical engineering or mechanical engineering. To become a full member of CIBSE, and so also to be registered by the [[Engineering Council UK]] as a chartered engineer, engineers must also attain an Honours Degree and a master's degree in a relevant engineering subject.

CIBSE publishes several guides to HVAC design relevant to the UK market, and also the Republic of Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong. These guides include various recommended design criteria and standards, some of which are cited within the UK building regulations, and therefore form a legislative requirement for major building services works. The main guides are:
* Guide A: Environmental Design
* Guide B: Heating, Ventilating, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration
* Guide C: Reference Data
* Guide D: Transportation systems in Buildings
* Guide E: Fire Safety Engineering
* Guide F: Energy Efficiency in Buildings
* Guide G: Public Health Engineering
* Guide H: Building Control Systems
* Guide J: Weather, Solar and Illuminance Data
* Guide K: Electricity in Buildings
* Guide L: Sustainability
* Guide M: Maintenance Engineering and Management

Within the [[construction]] sector, it is the job of the building services engineer to [[design]] and oversee the installation and maintenance of the essential services such as gas, [[electricity]], water, heating and [[lighting]], as well as many others. These all help to make buildings comfortable and healthy places to live and work in. Building Services is part of a sector that has over 51,000 businesses and employs represents 2%-3% of the [[GDP]].

=== Australia ===
The Air Conditioning and Mechanical Contractors Association of Australia (AMCA), Australian Institute of Refrigeration, Air Conditioning and Heating (AIRAH), Australian Refrigeration Mechanical Association and CIBSE are responsible.

=== Asia ===
Asian architectural temperature-control have different priorities than European methods. For example, Asian heating traditionally focuses on maintaining [[Underfloor heating#History|temperatures of objects such as the floor]] or furnishings such as [[Kotatsu]] tables and directly warming people, as opposed to the Western focus, in modern periods, on designing air systems.

==== Philippines ====
The Philippine Society of Ventilating, Air Conditioning and Refrigerating Engineers (PSVARE) along with Philippine Society of Mechanical Engineers (PSME) govern on the codes and standards for HVAC / MVAC (MVAC means "mechanical ventilation and air conditioning") in the Philippines.

====India====
The Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ISHRAE) was established to promote the HVAC industry in India. ISHRAE is an associate of ASHRAE. ISHRAE was started at [[Delhi]] in 1981 and a chapter was started in Bangalore in 1989. Between 1989 &amp; 1993, ISHRAE chapters were formed in all major cities in India.

[[Anthropology]] is the study of various aspects of&amp;nbsp;[[human]]s&amp;nbsp;within past and present&amp;nbsp;[[Society|societies]].&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/anthropology?q=anthropology|title=anthropology|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/27505/anthropology|title=anthropology|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aaa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaanet.org/about/whatisanthropology.cfm|title=What is Anthropology?|publisher=[[American Anthropological Association]]|accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study is practiced in multiple countries, each of whom has their own history of how anthropology has developed in their respective countries.

== Latin America ==
Anthropology in Latin America is a well established discipline that has existed for over 100 years. The countries that are summarized in this section include Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, the Andean region, Costa Rica, and Colombia. Latin America anthropologists established their discipline in conjunction with American and European anthropologists, and revised their disciplines to study cultural phenomena through their own perspectives, independent of American and European thought.   [[File:Map-Latin America and Caribbean.png|thumb|Latin America and the Caribbean]]

=== Andes ===

Andean anthropology’s roots began during the turn of the 20th century, containing social movements between two groups in Peru, and from academia within the United States. The mestizo (non-native) and indigenous intellectuals known as indigenistas competed for political and intellectual space and recognition in Peru. Indigenous intellectuals advocated for interculturalidad, where indigenous thought could occupy Peruvian society as its own entity and not become blended as a singular national identity that the mestizaje proposed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Anthropologies: Disciplinary Transformations within Systems of Power|last=Ribiero|first=Gustavo|last2=Escobar|first2=Arturo|publisher=Berg|others=Marisol de la Cadena|year=2006|isbn=9781845201913|location=New York, New York|pages=201–224|chapter=The Production of Other Knowledges and Its Tensions: From Andeanist Anthropology to Interculturalidad?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mestizaje perspective sought to modernize Peru and model their society similar to the United States. [[José María Arguedas]] was a writer and ethnographer in Peru, who classified himself as an indigenous intellectual that challenged Western thought and ideology. [[John Victor Murra]], an anthropologist teaching in the United States collaborated with Arguedas. Their collaboration stemmed from Murra’s travels in 1952 to the Latin American region when he was working under the anthropologist [[Sidney Mintz]] as a PhD student. Indigenistas were active in social and political movements in Latin America and collaborated with people inside of the United States, but still sought to be independent from Western thought.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
[[File:Logo of the American Anthropological Association.png|thumb|AAA]]
In 1936, the [[American Anthropological Association]] initiated studies in Latin America on how to incorporate indigenous people in Latin American society, termed acculturation studies, and in 1935, the [[Social Science Research Council]], the [[American Council of Learned Societies]], and the Committee on Latin American studies worked to benefit the interests of the United States. The Peruvian government funded anthropological institutions beginning in the 1940s, and the establishment of the Instiuto de Etnologia y Arqueologia and a Peruvian sector in the Instituto Indigneista Interamericano followed. By the 1960s Peruvian governmental funding decreased, and became reliant upon the United States for funding. The indigenous incorporation into the goal of a singular society was termed cholification by the Peruvian sociologist [[Aníbal Quijano|Anibal Quijano]]. In the 1990s during the Neo-liberal era, indigenous thought became more recognized with political conflicts in the Andean region, and interculturalidad was pursued again for Andean states to recognize the diversity of the people that occupied them.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Argentina ===
Social Anthropology was established in Argentina in 1957. It was first institutionalized at the University of [[Buenos Aires]]. Before the institutionalization of social anthropology, the discipline largely focused on historical studies. Rosana Guber attributes the introduction of social anthropology to [[Esther Hermitte]] who was a history professor at the Ethnographic Museum in Argentina. It was during her trips to the University of Chicago that she was introduced to social anthropology, and so it was the west who influenced the institutionalization of social anthropology in Argentina. In 1965, students began to ask for a discipline separate from sociology, and that was not focused primarily on indigenous people. There was a movement around this time that called for a greater understanding of the changes modern society was going through, especially during and after the 1966 [[Revolución Argentina]]. Later, in 1974, students and faculty within departments that were studying social movements and change suffered kidnappings and murders by the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance|Argentine AntiCommunist Alliance]]. The current status of Argentinian anthropology is still deeply rooted in western influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Committed or Scientific?

=== Brazil ===
[[File:Getulio Vargas (1930).jpg|thumb|Getúlio Vargas (1930)|234x234px]]
Anthropology in Brazil was institutionalized in 1930 at the beginning of the [[Vargas Era]]. Later during the 1950s and 1960s, Brazil was experiencing political authoritarianism. As a result, anthropology began to address inter-ethnic friction. In the 1970s anthropologists began to consider nearby urban studies as a topic of research. The 1980s kicked off a more modern type of anthropology where anthropologists began to look at themselves as “the other”. Brazil did not have an issue of [[alterity]] or exoticism, because it existed within its own borders. Brazil began to value exoticism and viewed it as the acknowledgement of cultural diversity according to [[:pt:Mariza Peirano|Mariza Peirano]]. In general, the overall current goal for Brazilian anthropology was to better the future for modernization by enlightening modern political elite and identifying relevant topics for investigation. Some of Brazil’s main anthropological institutions are the University of Brazil, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, and the Brazilian Association of Anthropology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Other People's Anthropologies: Ethnographic Practice on the Margins|last=Boskovic|first=Alexander|publisher=Berghahn Books|others=Mariza G.S. Peirano|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=186–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colombia ===
Anthropology in Colombia was institutionalized during the mid-1940s. Between the 1950s-70’s, Colombian anthropologists sought to integrate into national society and began to deal with terms like culture, integration, and assimilation. However, during the 1970s, this early understanding of anthropology was opposed and anthropologists began to confront terms such as national integration because they felt it was loaded with other issues like racial supremacy. Emerging social movements encouraged this new way of thinking because it recognized the rights of peasant and ethnic populations as well as the influence of Marxism. Anthropologists continued this way of thinking through the 1980s although a larger influence from militant anthropology became apparent. By militant anthropology, Myriam Jimeno refers to anthropologists who often debate and participate, but write very little. The goal of this type of anthropology was to alter the symbols of national identity and to accompany new ethnic movements in finding representation. Anthropologists and ethnic groups aimed to challenge the way indigenous groups were being ostracized by cultural hegemony. Later on in 1991, Colombia underwent a process of constitutional reform and development in attempt to recognize more cultural and ethnic rights. Some of its current most influential institutions are the [[Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History]], the Colombian National University, and the National Institute of Ethnology.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/165081955|title=A companion to Latin American anthropology|last=Poole|first=Deborah|date=2008|publisher=Blackwell Pub|others=Jimeno, Myriam|year=|isbn=0631234683|location=Malden, MA|pages=72–89|oclc=165081955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Costa Rica ===
[[File:Margarita Bolaños.jpg|thumb|305x305px|Presidenta del Partido Acción Ciudadana 
'''Margarita Bolaños Arquín'''
]]
Costa Rican anthropology was institutionalized in 1967 under political influence. According to Margarita Bolaños Arquín, increasing notions of nationalism and anti imperialism led to the institutionalization of social sciences in Costa Rica. During the 1960s, around the time of institutionalization, social scientists' primary focus was on the birth and implications of social movements, as well as the consequences of modernization in rural areas. Later, French [[Structural Marxism]] influenced the social sciences to take an interest in the study of class structures. Over time, anthropology in Costa Rica was highly criticized in its struggle to find its identity. Caught in a sort of balancing act between western and Latin American practice, anthropology in Costa Rica eventually learned to take the criticisms of other anthropologies and made a name for itself with a focus on gender studies, identity studies, and developmental problems. To legitimize their discipline, anthropology contributed to other sciences such as linguistics, agriculture, and psychology. However, during the 1980s Costa Rica endured a recession, and anthropological institutions were under threat. During this time, [[globalization]] was becoming increasingly popular and while during the recession of the 1980s Costa Rica was not seen as a power player, at the start of the 1990s, the country could now participate in ways that were productive. It was not until around the 1990s that anthropologists regained the opportunity to research and, after such political and economic turmoil, there was much to question. Throughout the 1990s the focus of anthropology and other disciplines such as sociology continued to research in rural areas but shifted their research to the survival of the poor during tough economic times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolanos|first=Margarita|date=Fall 2002|title=Costa Rican Social Anthropology in the Central American Context at the End of the Twentieth Century|url=|journal=Practicing Anthropology|volume=24|pages=17–21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mexico ===
[[Manuel Gamio]], the first Mexican anthropologist, earned his PhD in 1921, having studied under [[Franz Boas]]. The first anthropology department was established in 1938. Indigenous population studies known as indigenism, are an integral part of Mexican anthropology, and became popular during the presidency of [[Lázaro Cárdenas|Lázaro Cardenas]], serving from 1934-1940. The [[Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia|National Institute of Anthropology and History]] was established by President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] in 1939, and remains a prominent place of anthropological study in Latin America. The nation-building interests of incorporating the indigenous population into the Mexican state also led to the establishment of the Inter-American Indian Institute in 1942, in Mexico City, along with the establishment of the academic journal, America Indígena. Marxist theory was predominantly used to analyze social phenomena, and was combined with social evolution theory that viewed Mexico in three historical time phases: pre-Hispanic, Colonial, and Modern.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
[[File:Lazaro cardenas2.jpg|thumb|President Lazaro Cardenas 
In office 1934-1940
]]
In the 1970s, [[Gonzalo Aguirre Beltrán]], an anthropologist who was formerly a medical doctor worked for the federal government and promoted critical anthropology in Mexico that used Marxist theory and rejected imperialistic practices from the United States. Mexico’s urban populations began to increase in the 1970s, which became another topic of study for anthropologists. In the 1980s, Gramscian Marxism became the theoretical center, and studies included rural and urban populations, and labor. Institutions of anthropology have continued to increase since the 1980s, offering undergraduate and graduate degrees. Neo-liberal market transformations in the 1990s have affected anthropological training presently, as students may find careers not only in the universities, but non-governmental organizations.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Anthropologies: Disciplinary Transformations within Systems of Power|last=Ribeiro|first=Gustavo|last2=Escobar|first2=Arturo|publisher=Berg|others=Esteban Krotz|year=2006|isbn=9781845201913|location=New York, New York|pages=87–109|chapter=Mexican Anthropology's Ongoing Search for Identity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Asia ==
Asia includes the countries China, Japan, Philippines, and Siberia. Anthropology in Asia has been influenced by Western anthropological ideologies through colonial contact, historically. While the discipline of anthropology is historically built from nation-building and colonization from core countries, language and publishing barriers, funding opportunities and political status all influence the structure of anthropological research in each Asian country. Anthropology in the social and cultural perspective have not always had a strong tradition in Asian anthropology, but ethnography, ethnology, and folklore often have dominant roots within the discipline.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

=== China ===
[[File:Cai_Yuanpei_1.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cai_Yuanpei_1.jpg|thumb|Cai Yuanpei, the father of anthropology in China]]
[[China|Chinese]] anthropology was founded by scholar [[Cai Yuanpei]]. Cai Yuanpei was a scholar educated at the [[University of Leipzig]], and he brought both Western influence and standardization into the discipline of anthropology in China. The first department of anthropology was founded in 1928 with Cai Yuanpei’s creation of [[Academia Sinica]] in [[Beijing]]. At Academia Sinica, physical anthropology and archaeology held focus.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62324831|title=World anthropologies : disciplinary transformations within systems of power|last=Smart|first=Josephine|publisher=|others=Ribeiro, Gustavo Lins., Escobar, Arturo, 1951-|year=|isbn=9781845201913|location=Oxford, UK|pages=69–85|oclc=62324831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franz Boas also brought Western influence to China, and British functionalism would make a lasting impact on Chinese anthropology. In addition to Cai Yuanpei, [[Wu Wenzao]] was one of the most influential proponents of Western-influenced anthropology, and he took classes under [[Ruth Benedict]] (one of Boas’ students that would be influential in the field of anthropology on her own overall).&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/55146652|title=The making of anthropology in East and Southeast Asia|last=Liu|first=Xin|date=2004|publisher=Berghahn Books|others=Yamashita, Shinji., Bosco, Joseph, 1957-, Eades, J. S. (Jeremy Seymour), 1945-|year=|isbn=1571812598|location=New York|pages=|oclc=55146652}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wu began teaching at Yenjing University in 1929, where he would influence students such as [[Fei Xiaotong]] and [[Lin Yaohua]], who would go on to be important in the scene of Chinese anthropology.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Chinese Ethnological Association created in 1934, but its progress was halted by China’s involvement in [[World War II]] in 1937.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

World War II pushed back the institutional development of anthropology in China until the late 1940s. With this revitalization, Chinese anthropologists began to look inwards at themselves for subjects of study. This inward focus led anthropologists of the time to attempt to use anthropology to better Chinese society.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; 1940-late 1950s was a time of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] influence in China, followed by 1957-1977 and [[Mao Zedong]]’s era of the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;  During this time, Maoist aims supplemented ethnology and Chinese national identity creation.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

Post-1978 was a time of reform in China following the end of Mao Zedong's leadership. Academia was reconstructed, and anthropology subsequently saw a revival during this time. Exchanges between foreign faculty and students helped to globalize Chinese anthropology and bring in other perspectives.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Liang Zhaotong was an advocate for the revival of social and cultural anthropology, but for this to happen, anthropology had to be seen as a useful tool for improvements in the field of the social sciences and society.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Anthropology was held in lower regard than ethnology in China due to the ideology of Mao Zedong, and anthropologists left anthropology for other disciplines in social science, such as sociology, which subsequently saw a large period of development in the 1980s. This lower regard for anthropology also caused the field to receive less attention and less funding from the public and Chinese institutions.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

The [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] (CASS) and the [[State Education Committee]] founded the Chinese Anthropological Association in 1981 (now part of the East Asian Anthropological Association). Today, anthropology in China is still influenced by its history of being less practical and less important in the field of social sciences. This causes a lack of public interest and awareness in Chinese anthropology in favor of more “professional” disciplines, such as medicine, business, law, etc.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== Japan ===
[[File:Ryuzo_Torii_01.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ryuzo_Torii_01.jpg|thumb|Torii Ryuzo 1952]]
The creation of anthropology in [[Japan]] was a response to the research of [[Edward S. Morse|Edward Morse]], the first professor of Zoology at [[Tokyo Imperial University]], where he discovered signs of cannibalism in Japan.  Japanese nationalism motivated Japanese peoples to study themselves rather than being subjects of study by outsiders.  This motivation led to the formation of Anthropological Society of [[Tokyo]] in 1886.  Tsuboi Shôgorô was a leading member of this group, and he is named one of the founding fathers of Japanese anthropology.  In 1892, he became the first professor of anthropology at [[Tokyo Imperial University]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Making of Anthropology in East and Southeast Asia|last=Bosco|first=Joseph|last2=Eades|first2=J.S.|last3=Yamashita|first3=Shinji|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2004|isbn=1-57181-259-8|location=United States|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, the Japanese colonial empire was marked by the annexation of [[Taiwan]] and led to an increase in domestic ethnographers in this region.  [[Torii Ryūzō]] was Tsuboi's successor and greatly attributed data and photographs of Taiwan during this time period.  His own research abroad redirected peoples' focus from themselves, Japanese folklore-studies, to the colonial Others.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  The expansion [[List of territories occupied by Imperial Japan|Japanese imperialism]] drove [[Torii Ryūzō|Ryūzō]]'s research of others.  This shift in research subjects created a separate discipline, ethnology or 'race studies.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anthropology and Colonialism in Asia and Oceania|last=Shimizu|first=Akitoshi|last2=van Breman|first2=Jan|publisher=Curzon Press|year=1999|isbn=0-7007-0604-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, Japanese Society of Ethnology (''Nihon Minzokugakkai'') was formed, which separated Japanese folklore and ethnological studies from comparative ethnology.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In 1968, the Eighth Congress of the [[International Union of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences]] (IUAES) was held in Japan.

In 2004, in response to the IUAES, the Japanese Society of Ethnology changed its name to the Japanese Society of Cultural Anthropology; this is one of the largest organizations at 2,000 members.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Considered to be a semi-peripheral country in comparison to the West, Japan is home to the largest number of anthropologists in Asia as well as the largest center for anthropological research in Asia.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Japan's history resembles a colonial power in East Asia.  Currently, language and audience discrepancies hinder open conversations between Japanese and American anthropologies.  Since Western academic anthropologists publish in English, their local and global audience is essentially one.  In Japan, writing for a global audience requires publishing in English.  While Japanese scholars are knowledgeable about Western anthropological theories and trends, institutional factors deter Japanese anthropologists to publish in English;  a more extensive peer review process can delay publication approval for years resulting in outdated empirical data.  Japanese academics prefer to publish in university in-house journals where there is a much shorter delay in publication approval.  A local audience means publishing in Japanese and increasing the gap between world anthropologies.

=== Philippines ===
The movement of [[indigenization]] of anthropology in the [[Philippines]] challenges foreign-adopted Western concepts, theories and methods.  To understand the viewpoints of this process, indigenization can be examined as a historical process, a perspective of native concepts, and as both a problem and solution created by colonial or neocolonial educational curriculum.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Yamashita, Shinji, et al. “Towards Indigenization: Responses, Challenges, and Experiences in the Philippines.” ''The Making of Anthropology in East and Southeast Asia'', Berghahn Books, 2004, pp. 335–353.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1560-1898, the Philippines was under Spanish colonial regime.  During this time, Spanish colonizers established society through theologoical orthodoxy.  They valued their own written history over the Philippines' native traditions, and oral tradition was undermined by colonization.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

From 1898-1941, the second period of colonization by the United States took place.  Ethnographic knowledge was established as the basis of integration of indigenous elements into mainstream Philippine society.  In 1914, anthropology curriculum was established at the [[University of the Philippines]], and three years later, an anthropology department was created.  In 1921, the anthropology department at the University of Philippines merged with the sociology department.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

During the post-war era (1946-1968), student activism, national pride and identity reinforced the process of decolonization; the University of the Philippines was at the forefront of this movement. Filipino scholars increasingly pursued graduate programs in the United States anthropology departments.  This created an issue that will be discussed further.

From 1970-1986, social and political consciousness in the Philippines marked a revolutionary period.  The country adopted conflict models; Marxist ideology was more suitable for the Philippines that was in a crisis state.  In the late 1970s, the Philippine Folklore Society was formed.  This growth of folklore studies was due to the further development of indigenization in the Philippines.  In 1977, The Philippine Anthropological Society (Ugnayan ng Agham Tao or UGAT) was founded.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

After 1986, this period was marked by a heightened cultural consciousness.  President Corazon Aquino promoted culture through creation of the National Commission for Culture and Arts (NCCA).

The distance between native and foreign anthropologists is a conflict in the Philippines.  While most scholars receive formal education in Western societies, they often return "home" and view their native society through a foreign, Westernized lens they were conditioned and educated by.  Native anthropologists are hindered by a perspective based on bias.  Interests, training, values, and field exposure can result in differences between foreign and native anthropologists.  It is important to recognize these different angles, politics of representation, and ethnographic authority in order to successful observe others as well as our own societies.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Another challenge in anthropology in the Philippines is discussed by Filipino anthropologist, Carlos Jr. P Tatel, about funding for research on governmental and regional levels.  He explains that anthropology proposals for funding often deviate from original plan in order to fit the agendas of agencies who grant travel and research funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=|last=Tatel|first=Carlos Jr. P.|date=2017|work=Video Interview|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Siberia ===
[[Siberia]] as a territory was important in the development of Russian anthropology due to its position of alterity within Russia. Siberia and the people of [[Northern Russia]] were points of great interest throughout various periods in Russian history as it tried to better understand its own people.
[[File:Vladimir_Bogoraz.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vladimir_Bogoraz.jpg|thumb|Vladimir Bogoraz, one of the founding fathers of Siberian studies in Russia]]
The beginnings of ethnographic research in Siberia were heavily influenced by anthropology in Germany and ideas of Russian nationalism in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62324831|title=World anthropologies : disciplinary transformations within systems of power|last=Vakhtin|first=Nikolai|publisher=|others=Ribeiro, Gustavo Lins., Escobar, Arturo, 1951-|year=|isbn=9781845201913|location=Oxford, UK|pages=49–65|oclc=62324831}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition led by Franz Boas, the [[Jesup North Pacific Expedition]] from 1897-1902, helped to bring international attention to the concept of doing anthropology in Siberia in relation to Russian anthropology in addition to bringing Boas’ anthropological perspective into Russia.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Also on this expedition were [[Vladimir Bogoraz]], [[Vladimir Jochelson]], and Leo Sternberg, who would be known as the founding fathers of Siberian studies, and influential ethnographers in Russia.

The nationalistic undercurrent in Russia at the time of the beginnings of researching Siberia as a place of intrigue was reflected in the Russians' attitude towards the people in Siberia. The impetus to study Siberians was rooted in the idea that one day the people in the area would all assimilate to Russian culture, and due to this, the current culture of the people should be documented and recorded.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Russian ideologies heavily influenced the research field in Siberia, and studying Russian and Siberian history was an easier route for research due to the uncertainty of what would be acceptable to study under the Russian government in the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Under Soviet Russia in the early 20th century, ethnology moved toward a more l[[Structuralist anthropology|structural]] and [[Functionalism (anthropology)|functionalist]] view, with the goal of generally understanding human culture.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; When [[Joseph Stalin]] came into power, this view shifted as Stalin aimed to homogenize Russian culture and identity.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Ethnologists were employed by the state with a focus on understanding, regulating, and standardizing the different ethnic groups of Russia.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Central and Eastern Europe ==
[[File:Central_and_Eastern_Europe_Map.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Central_and_Eastern_Europe_Map.png|left|thumb|468x468px|Map of Central and Eastern Europe]]
Central and Eastern Europe includes the countries of Austria, Croatia, Slovenia, Switzerland, Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, and Hungary among many others. Anthropological study is active in many places Europe through research centers, academic societies, and universities on a range of topics. One of the biggest problems facing anthropologists in Central and Eastern Europe is the need to define themselves as a discipline separate from any other.

== Central Europe ==
Anthropology in central European countries has its roots in [[Germany]]. The establishment of anthropology within central Europe has been a slow process that involved first understanding what the discipline was and then determining how it fit within each country's individual ideals.

== Eastern Europe ==
Anthropology in Eastern Europe varies in is roots, but many of the different anthropologies share a common interest in folklore and human populations. Eastern European anthropologists, official and non official, tend to focus on studying local issues and staying out of international affairs. The anthropological trend in Eastern Europe is a turn toward the social sciences and anthropology after separation from the [[Soviet Union]].

After separating from the Soviet Union, Belarus went through a period of state development that lasted from about 1990 to 1994. During this time, the focus was on nation-building. This required both an institutional and ideological change from the time when Belarus was under Soviet rule.

Belarusian anthropologists also looked outside of Belarus through the Research Institute and Museum of Anthropology from [[Moscow State University]] in order to study the [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]], [[Eskimo]]s, [[Kazakhs]], and [[Khakas people|Khakas]] peoples.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

One important figure in Belarusian anthropology was L.I. Tegako, who is cited as being one of its founders in the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; She began research on ethnic health issues in the 1960s, which is one of the first instances of an official sort of anthropology in Belarus. Her teacher was V.P. Alekseev of Russia. From her research, she concluded that “Belarusians manage to stay within variations which are typical for Caucasian race.” Tegako took part in much of the work in the 1980s on both the genetic structure of human populations and the child studies. She also led twenty expeditions outside of Belarus.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Lidiya Ivanovana is also an important character in Belarusian anthropology. She obtained her PhD in Russia in 1990 with a dissertation that looked at populations in Belarus. Her work was the first to take a multi-dimensional approach involving different types of materials from several different populations within Belarus. Ivanovana is attributed as having contributed many of the anthropological methods used in Belarus.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Bulgaria ===
[[File:NBU_blue.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NBU_blue.jpg|thumb|'''New Bulgarian University''']]
Anthropology appeared in an official status in [[Bulgaria]] in late 1989 due to the fall of the [[Communist Regime|communist regime]] and is thought to be a product of democratization of society. The first departments to include something like anthropology were departments of ethnology, which were concerned with ethnography and folklore, and were worked in to the departments of [[philology]] or history. Anthropology itself was introduced at [[New Bulgarian University]] (NBU) as a priority, but they had to combine with a discipline recognized by the state, which like in many other cases, was the department of sociology with the degree being a sociology one. It wasn’t until around 2004 that anthropology got its own department with its own degree in Bulgaria.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

One of Bulgarian anthropology’s main focuses at first was to carve out their own niche as a discipline, especially considering that Bulgarian anthropologists come from a variety of backgrounds. They were also left with ideas from the socialist period and the fall of communism. There was also focus on the changing social conditions from the period of transition after the fall of communism. There was push for democratization in Bulgaria, and anthropology became something of a symbol for that change.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Despite this, there was still polarization on methods and ideology within the new discipline based on debates about Soviet versus Western styles of education, which were understood to be ideological opposites. The shift was eventually toward Western ideas. Bulgarian anthropologists tend to focus on research within their own borders, but also research in [[Balkans]]. Despite the branching out of Bulgaria, there are a limited number of field-research sites, a limited number of subjects, and a limited number of methods taken advantage of by Bulgarian anthropologists. Much attention is paid to community formation, complex societies, power, polity, statehood, nationalism, myth, ritual, religion, marriage, kinship, ethnicity, nation-hood, magic, medicine, and multiculturality.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Czech Republic ===
[[File:LocationCzechRepublic.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LocationCzechRepublic.png|thumb|250x250px|'''Location of Czech Republic on the map''']]
The [[Czech Republic]] takes a constructivist approach to anthropology (closely connected to ethnology), which they take a positivist approach to.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jakoubek|first=Marek|date=2016|title=Anthropology in Eastern Europe Between Positivism and Constructivism: A Case from the Czech Republic|url=|journal=Anthropological Notebooks|publisher=Slovene Anthropological Society|volume=22|issue=3|pages=25–45|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnology is taken to be trying to get at objective truth, where anthropology is getting at social constructs and beliefs. Despite this split between ideas of ethnology and anthropology in the Czech Republic, anthropology is not yet a fully established discipline. After the split from communism in 1989, there was a turn to socio-cultural anthropology in the way of ideology, but it was inconsistent. Some academics saw it as the same thing as ethnology, while others thought of it as a different research field with different methods and traditions, which resulted in the difficulty of establishing anthropology as a discipline. Many argue for there being a real epistemological difference between the two approaches.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

=== Hungary ===
[[Hungary|Hungarian]] anthropology is a defined discipline with its own departments and methods, though there is still overlap between anthropology and other related departments, like history and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keen|first=Mike|last2=Mucha|first2=Janusz|date=|title=Sociology in Central and Eastern Europe in the 1990s: A Decade of Reconstruction|url=|journal=European Societies|volume=6|issue=2|pages=123–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hungarian anthropology places a premium on verifying sociological and anthropological results with scientific data.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bokonyi|first=Sandor|last2=Hofer|first2=Tamas|last3=Kiszely|first3=Istvan|last4=Szepe|first4=Gyorgy|last5=Maday|first5=Bela|date=February 1970|title=On Hungarian Anthropology|url=|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=11|issue=1|pages=61–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, the ''Ethnographic Research Group'', which was attached to the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] was founded. It was led by [[Gyula Ortutay]] and had twenty-two participating members. The research focused on Hungarian folklore, but the group also looked at peasant economy, social institutions, and Siberian tribal society. If a senior member had an interest outside of Hungary, then that was also a permissible research topic.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Cultural Anthropological departments were established at the [[University of Budapest]] in 1990 and the [[University of Miskolc]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/63116730|title=Three social science disciplines in Central and Eastern Europe : handbook on economics, political science and sociology, 1989-2001|date=2002|publisher=Social Science Information Centre (IZ)|others=Kaase, Max., Sparschuh, Vera., Wenninger, Agnieszka., Gesellschaft Sozialwissenschaftlicher Infrastruktureinrichtungen., Collegium Budapest.|isbn=3820601392|location=Berlin|oclc=63116730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many places to publish anthropological works within Hungary. The majority of the work is published in languages other than Hungarian and appear mostly in European periodicals. Many of the works do not appear in American anthropological journals due to a gap in how things are understood between the two anthropological fields. Many Hungarian anthropologists believe that the methods and problems that they need to consider are within their own borders or within their own region. They tend to stay out of international problems and direct their funding toward internal concerns.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Bela C. Maday points out that communication is not a strong suit for Hungarian anthropologists, which makes communicating ideas with core anthropologists, like those from the U.S. or Western Europe, difficult, but there has been much dispute on this point.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Russia ===
[[File:Russian_Academy_of_Sciences_SPB.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Russian_Academy_of_Sciences_SPB.jpg|thumb|'''[[Russian Academy of Sciences]]''' in Saint Petersburg]]
The beginnings of anthropology in [[Russia]] can be traced back to the establishment of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] under [[Peter the Great]] in 1725.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Following the Academy of Sciences, many museums were also created with the impetus for studying culture, including the Ethnographic Bureau of the [[Russian Geographical Society]] in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The 1840s also saw the creation of [[physical anthropology]] and [[archaeology]] as sub-disciplines of anthropology.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In 1864 the first university department for anthropology in Russia was created at [[Moscow University]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The first specialized journal for Russian anthropology, (trans.) The Ethnographic Review ([http://journal.iea.ras.ru/en/index.htm Etnograficheskoe obozrenie]), was created in 1889.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; As Russia did not have state-supplemented funding in the 19th century, much of the financial support came from aristocrats such as Count [[Aleksey Uvarov]] and Prince V. N. Tenishev.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;
[[File:Kunstkamera_(Peter_the_Great_Museum_of_Anthropology_and_Ethnography)_in_Saint_Petersburg_3.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kunstkamera_(Peter_the_Great_Museum_of_Anthropology_and_Ethnography)_in_Saint_Petersburg_3.jpg|thumb|276x276px|'''Kunstkamera''' (Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography) in Saint Petersberg]]
In the early 20th century, St. Petersburg and Moscow would be centers for the development of anthropology—focused on ethnology and ethnography—with the formation of the Department of Ethnology in Leningrad (1928), Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography (1924), the publication of the journal ''Ethnography'' (1926), the Anuchin Institute of Anthropology at the University of Moscow (1922), etc. Anthropology in Russia was also influenced by Western anthropological perspectives, such as [[Franz Boas]].

Following the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] takeover, Russia began to favor ethnology over anthropology. Ethnology was the study of different ethnic groups within the state, which supported the push for homogenization and national unification of the Russian state. [[Marxism|Marxist theory]] replaced Western anthropological theory, and various university departments were closed as Russia experienced an ideological reconstruction.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In the mid-20th century, with undercurrents of the [[Cold War]], social and cultural anthropology were rejected from ethnographic study, but ethnography was re-institutionalized and strengthened in universities and institutions across Russia.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In the latter half of the 20th century, Russian ethnography to other parts of the world in which Soviet influence was strong, such as [[Eastern Europe]]. The [[Perestroika]] in 1985 led to another bout of reconstruction for anthropology, and Russian science in general. Institutes were renamed and reconfigured to match this new trend. Social anthropology also began to make a comeback, leading to identity problems for social anthropology as a discipline in a country with such a strong ethnographic tradition that had excluded it for years.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The 1990s, a time of great social and political change for Russia with the end of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], were a time for critical introspective views on the recent past.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; With this, Russian anthropology turned towards more contemporary interests, where it still is today. Even with these contemporary interests, Russian anthropology still finds itself heavily influenced by the ethnology of its past and attempting to reconcile what it means to be a “social” anthropologist in this environment.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Anthropology of the Arab World ==
The discipline of [[anthropology]] is not new to the [[Arab world]]. While there were no established anthropological institutions until the 20th century, scholars such as [[Abu Rayhan al-Biruni]] and [[Ibn Khaldun]], are recognized for their contribution to the discipline as early as the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ata.org.tn/fichier_PDF/tsr5-2012-chaabani.pdf|title=Insights on the history of Anthropology|last1=Chaabani|first1=Hassen|website=ata.org|publisher=International Journal of Modern Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Egypt]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], and the [[Persian Gulf]] region have received most of the scholarly attention, with a particular focus on [[nationalism]] and the state. The Arab youth are a growing area of interest for anthropologists in the [[Arab world]]. Comparatively little research is done in [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]], the [[Sudan]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], and [[Iraq]]. This is in part a result of accessibility and the conditions of the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/documents/people/Winegar_Politics_of_Middle_East_Anthropology.pdf|title=Anthropologies of Arab-Majority Societies|last1=Deeb|first1=Laura|last2=Winegar|first2=Jessica|website=anthropology.northwestern.edu|publisher=The Annual Review of Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That status of anthropology in the Arab world would be labeled as peripheral in relation to anthropology in other regions of the world.

== Middle East ==

=== Iran ===
The man known as the father of Iranian Anthropology was named [[Sadegh Hedayat]] (1903-1951). His focus was on folklore. In 1937, an institute of ethnology was founded in Iran, which then closed in 1941. It then reopened with the rise to power of [[Mohammed Reza Shah]]. From 1956 to 1959, it published a journal titled "Majalle-ye Mardomshenasi" (Journal of Anthropology). In 1957, the first anthropological elective course offered at a college level in Iran began at the [[University of Tehran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shahshahani|first1=Soheila|date=1986|title=History of Anthropology in Iran|journal=Iranian Studies|volume=19|issue=1|pages=65–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, there was not as much of an emphasis placed on receiving degrees from foreign universities. Similarly, international research was also not highly valued. International study and research, however, has begun gaining more and more importance within the departments of anthropology in Iran. Anthropology in Iran suffers from a poor reputation in the public sphere. It is considered to be a weak discipline, according to Iranian anthropologist, [[Soheila Shahshahani]]. Perhaps because of this, most students of the social sciences tend to choose other disciplines, such as law, management, and psychology. As society changes, more attention is being paid to the field. Today, ethnographic research in the area focused on internal subjects, such as the pastoralists living in the arid areas around Iran. These studies continue today, but other fields of interest have started to emerge. A new focus on small town life and rural areas has recently developed. Professor Shahshanani states that the weakness of current anthology in Iran is the lack of theoretical work done by its practitioners. She also goes on to say that these issues could be solved by getting Iranian anthropologists who have trained elsewhere to come back and practice in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dominguez|first1=Virginia|last2=Metzner|first2=Emily|title=An Interview With Iranian Anthropologist Soheila Shahshahani|journal=American Anthropologist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Levant ==

=== Lebanon ===
The department of sociology at the [[American University of Beirut]] was the first to offer an anthropology course, which is listed in its 1950-51 catalogue. The department of anthropology was officially founded in the 1970s, and saw 33 students graduate with a Master of Arts degree in anthropology throughout that decade. The [[Lebanese Civil War]], which lasted from 1975-1990, interfered with the development of the department and anthropology at the university saw a decline as a direct result. During this time, the new department of social and behavioral sciences (SBS) which already encompassed sociology, psychology, and communication, absorbed the anthropology department.&lt;ref name="Anthropology in Beirut"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/873907/Anthropology_in_Beirut|title=Anthropology in Beirut|last1=King|first1=Diane E|last2=Scheid|first2=Kirsten|website=academia|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, records show just one student having graduated with a Master of Arts degree in anthropology, while there were none in the 1990s. There were three anthropologists on the faculty throughout this time. Among them were Fuad Khuri, Martha Mundy, and Gerald Obermeyer.

A survey conducted in 1989 by Seteney Shami, a 1976 graduate of the BA program in anthropology at the American University in Beirut, sought to learn more about the teachings of anthropology at universities in the Arab world. Her findings suggested that the role of the discipline in the Arab world were minimal. In an academic report that came out in 2006, anthropologists at the same university claim to have found little evidence in the local community of any significant changes since.

Today's anthropology graduates in Lebanon have opportunities to work with local NGOs. However, for those interested in pursuing anthropology as a discipline, the West still stands as the one destination for that. Anthropology departments at the American University in Beirut, and in Lebanon, are stifled by war.&lt;ref name="Anthropology in Beirut"/&gt;

As a destination for anthropologists to do research, Lebanon is among the top spots for emerging scholars in the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/documents/people/Winegar_Politics_of_Middle_East_Anthropology.pdf|title=Anthropologies of Arab-Majority Societies|last1=Deeb|first1=Laura|last2=Winegar|first2=Jessica|website=anthropology.northwestern.edu|publisher=The Annual Review of Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Palestine ===
Palestine has seen an increase in research conducted in the territory and among the Paletinian communities in Isarel, as well as refugee camps in neighboring countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/documents/people/Winegar_Politics_of_Middle_East_Anthropology.pdf|title=Anthropologies of Arab-Majority Societies|last1=Deeb|first1=Laura|last2=Winegar|first2=Jessica|website=anthropology.northwestern.edu|publisher=The Annual Review of Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of Palestinian anthropology can be marked by four modes of ethnographic engagement: Biblical Palestine, Oriental Palestine, Absent Palestine, and Post-Structural Palestine.

'''Biblical Palestine''' refers to the main method of ethnographic engagement of Palestine which took place in the first decades of the 20th century. Led predominately by Europeans, their interest was motivated by the use of the Bible as a legitimizing text to influence the region. Early work consisted of European writers fetishizing and romanticizing the land and the people based on the Biblical figures.

'''Oriental Palestine''', a term coined by a Palestinian scholar (find scholar, cite) was the leading mode of engagement throughout the first four decades of the 20th century. It was marked by a sense of urgency to document Palestine as a source of Europe's beginnings. Through this lens, a narrative was offered that challenged the colonial British vision of Palestinian history which saw the Arabs there as "transient and ephemeral". It was also marked by a sense of duty among others to capture the traditional fabric of Palestine before it's dissolution, which appeared evident at the time due to the events surrounding the rise of Zionism.

'''Absent Palestine''' follows immediately after the demise of Palestine in 1948, and can only be fully understood in terms of the success of Zionism. In this sense, the state of Palestine was eclipsed by the narrative of Israel as a place offering a safe haven to endangered refugees from Europe. This ethnographic silence of Palestinians is seen as the turning point in Israel's image of modernity.

'''Post-Structural Palestine''' is the current main method of ethnographic engagement. It is known primarily for its stance that challenges and brings to question Israel's efforts to repress Palestinian nationalism. The movement has seen a rising trend in which the Palestinian subject is explored for their national identity, rather than silenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-anthro-081309-145910|title=The Ethnographic Arriving of Palestine|last1=Furani|first1=Khaled|last2=Rabinowitz|first2=Dan|website=annualreviews.org|publisher=Review in Advance|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Turkey ===
Anthropology as a discipline in Turkey can trace its roots back to 1925. Developing in an nationalistic atmosphere, The Anthropology Institute, otherwise known as The Center for Anthropological Research in Turkey, was established on that year within the Faculty of Medicine at the [[University of Istanbul]]. From 1925 to the 1960s, the main topics of research centered around studies of rural and village life, with a focus on nation building. In the 1960s, a series of military coups occurred, causing considerable changes to the field and to academia itself. It was not until the year 1997 that the first official department of anthropology was established in Turkey, at the private [[Yeditepe University]] in Istanbul. As of 2010, 6 of the 53 state universities in Turkey offered training in anthropology. In contrast to this, only one of the 24 private universities offer similar training. The first anthropological association in Turkey was founded in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Other People's Anthropologies: Ethnographic Practice On The Margins|last1=Bošković,|first1=Aleksandar|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York|pages=110–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Persian Gulf ==

=== Saudi Arabia ===
Many Anthropologists investigate the tribal system in Saudi Arabia. Anthropology was not popular in many countries; however, the Universities in Saudi Arabia are adopting Anthropology. 
* What is the opposite of the impression of tribes is the ideology of regression. The idea that the tribe gets its meaning from the patriarchal descent. Which is now called Saudi genealogy. One of the famous genealogy is Hamad Aljassar who dead in 2000(Alshamlan). 
* Golf scholars are interested in how migrants and other racial groups are racialized by the legal system. They are also interested in examining the built environment, the history of the transnational connection and the rapid social change (Deep &amp; Winger).

=== United Arab Emirates ===
Anthropological studies, which are concerned with the privacy of the UAE community with a tribal background are rare and limited.
* Most of the studies are written with other international anthropologists such as the ethnographic observations of a British Anthropologists Bertram Thomas.
Tribes are the most form of UAE. Many anthropologists are interested in investigating the form of tribes. Many of the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]] are also based on the tribal system.
* Moreover, there are many migrants in UAE from two sides: The first side is the center and the south of the Arabian Peninsula. The second side of the eastern coast of the [[Persian Gulf]], contains many foreign migrations from the neighboring countries of Asia.There are also migrants from Iran. The main intention of those migrants is settling in UAE.
* The UAE community is a multi-tribal community. A multi-cultural community that divides communities into socially and economically linked in different sectors of the workforce(Alsnagry).

=== Qatar and Bahrain ===
In Qatar and Bahrain, anthropology was not as popular as other fields, like many other countries in the Persian Gulf region. Anthropology is expanding in educational aspect. Many anthropologists are also concerned on the structure of the tribes in the Arab countries in the Persian Gulf region (Gardner).

== North Africa ==

=== Egypt ===
Within the Arab-majority countries, [[Egypt]], has established itself among the other Arab-majority countries as the main hub for anthropologists in the region, with [[Cairo]] being the center for most of this attention. The rest of the country remains relatively understudied. Increased attention to [[Cairo]] can be attributed to the rise of anthropological interest in cities, particularly to the diverse interdisciplinary scholarship.

The centrality of Middle East area studies is largely responsible for the increase in anthropological attention towards Egypt. In addition to this is the accessibility of institutional support for US scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/documents/people/Winegar_Politics_of_Middle_East_Anthropology.pdf|title=Anthropologies of Arab-Majority Societies|last1=Deeb|first1=Laura|last2=Winegar|first2=Jessica|website=anthropology.northwestern.edu|publisher=The Annual Review of Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the early 21st century, the relationship of Egypt with anthropology remains under question. Egyptian anthropologist, [[Hania Sholkamy]], remarks that there are four main points that shape this ongoing relationship: the relationship of methods to theory, the relationship between methods and their analysis, the relationship of culture to its determinants, and the relationship between having data and being able to evaluate it.

The discipline of anthropology is in a constant state of judgment within Egypt, particularly when compared with the discipline of demography. The qualitative data more common in demography is given more attention than the theoretical and analytical methods associated with anthropology.

=== Morocco ===
In Morocco, topics of anthropological research include the ethnicization of Jews, the construction of ethnicity among Berber, Arab, and Haratine groups through agricultural practices, and how Berber ethnicities are politicized in ways that create raced and gendered notions of homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/documents/people/Winegar_Politics_of_Middle_East_Anthropology.pdf|title=Anthropologies of Arab-Majority Societies|last1=Deeb|first1=Laura|last2=Winegar|first2=Jessica|website=anthropology.northwestern.edu|publisher=The Annual Review of Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Africa ==
The region of Africa has had a long history of being colonized by others in economic and cultural ways, which is why the study of anthropology in Africa is a relatively new discipline that is usually grouped with historical work. Before becoming a discipline in the region, Western anthropologists came to the area to study and conduct ethnographies pertaining to the native culture of those who inhabited the area. Anthropologists in African academia are still on looking for what anthropology means to them.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nyamnjoh|first=F.|date=2012|title=Blinded by Sight: Divining the Future of Anthropology in Africa|url=|journal=Institute of African Affairs at GIGA,|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While anthropology was initially used by states to gain knowledge about local cultures, it was later seen as a way to help them. After the recognition of its importance many universities and associations have institutionalized departments, journals and conferences to carry out this work.&lt;ref name=":53"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62324831|title=World anthropologies : disciplinary transformations within systems of power|others=Ribeiro, Gustavo Lins., Escobar, Arturo, 1951-|isbn=9781845201913|location=Oxford, UK|oclc=62324831}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article includes the history, development, and future of African Anthropology in different regions.

Kenya]]'', which was the first time any article was published from a native’s perspective.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; The methodology of anthropology in Kenya is neither strictly Kenyan, nor is it strictly Euro-American, but rather a combination of the various methods between the nations.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Due to the variety of methods that were being taught worldwide, as well as the education development in Kenya, it was decided to create formal training for the discipline.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; There’s evidence of this from their two major universities of the [[University of Nairobi]] and [[Moi University]].&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; The University of Nairobi tended to disciplines of archaeology and anthropology, but taught them as separate departments, similar to England’s separation of the departments; and Moi University tended to the same disciplines of archaeology and anthropology, but taught the disciplines together in the same department of Anthropology, as is taught in the U.S.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

==== British and German Studies ====

The majority of British, as well as German, anthropologists dominated Kenya with their studies focusing solely on the groups of people who were considered to be distinct, or “otherly”.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; While some anthropologists studied these groups in order to achieve dominance over them, other anthropologists reasoned studying the communities for educational purposes before their culture no longer existed due to colonizing.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Thus, causing a means for Kenya anthropologists to disassociate with colonialism because of its harsh effects on Africans and their culture.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; This forced the local anthropologists to rethink about socio-cultural studies, including their own discipline and how it aided in colonialism.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Even Jomo Kenyatta, who had benefited from his education and studies, was struggling with the decision on whether to associate with the discipline anymore.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

[[Louis Leakey]] aided in bringing archaeology and physical anthropology to light in Kenya. He work as a curator in the [[National Museums of Kenya|Coryndon Memorial Museum]], which is an important establishment that helps to keep excavation sites accessible, such as [[Koobi Fora]], [[Olorgesailie]], and the [[Hyrax Hill Prehistoric Site and Museum|Hyrax Hill]], to both local and foreign archaeologists.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; In the 1950s, alongside his wife, Leakey found various primate fossils, including those of [[Paranthropus boisei|Australopithecus Boisei]] (1959), [[Homo habilis|Homo Habilis]] (1964), and [[Kenyapithecus]] (1967).&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; In 1960, he established the [http://www.primateresearch.org/ Institute of Primate Research] (IPR) which helped in comprehending human evolution and biomedical research for health challenges in Africa, such as HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

[[File:Daniel_arap_Moi_1979b.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Daniel_arap_Moi_1979b.jpg|thumb|230x230px|Daniel Arap Moi]]
Since the discipline of anthropology was associated with colonialism, the nation-state of Kenya did not identify with its trajectories and could not support it.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; It wasn’t until [[Daniel arap Moi|Daniel Arap Moi]], who succeeded Jomo as president, made culture a central means for socio-economic aspects, making anthropology slowly begin to gain popularity again among locals due to its national cultural ethos.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; In 1965, the [[University of Nairobi]] established its Institute for Development Studies which contained two aspects of social science and cultural divisions.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; The social science aspect of the department went on to develop its own Institute of Development Studies, which carried out economic development but through a multidisciplinary approach.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; The cultural divisions aspect used resources that informed university students, as well as regionally, from a cultural instruction perspective.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; In 1970, the two subjects came together and were known as the [[Institute of African Studies]] (IAS), in which students researched in African archaeology, history, social anthropology, musicology, linguistics, oral literature, traditional arts, crafts, and social systems;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ogot|first=B.E.|date=1999|title=Building on the Indigenous: Selected Essays 1981-1998|url=|journal=Kisumu: Anyange Press|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; this institute even contributed to some of the top scholars such as musicologists [[P.N. Kavyu]] and [[:pl:Washington Omondi|Washington Omondi]], historians [[H.S.K. Mwaniki]] and [[William R. Ochieng’]], and writers [[Okot p'Bitek|Okot p’Bitek]] and [[Taban Lo Liyong|Taban lo Liyong]].&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; In 1986, the IAS had established its first anthropology training program, providing courses of medical, linguistic, economic, and ecological anthropology and material culture (Amuyunzu-Nyamongo, 2006).&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Challenges and Prospects for Applied Anthropology in Kenya|last=Amuyunzu-Nyamongo|first=M.|publisher=African Anthropology: History, Critique, and Practice|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Anthropological Future ====

The future of the discipline of anthropology consists of research projects dedicated to resolving health issues, such as malaria and HIV/AIDS, so it’s not a surprise that most anthropologists in Kenya today are either medical anthropologists or those anthropologists who study medical issues.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Many of these local anthropologists are sought out for help by national non-government health organizations, like [[United States Agency for International Development|United State Agency for International Development]], [[Family Health International]], [[EngenderHealth|Engenderhealth]], [[PATH (global health organization)|PATH]], [[Population Council]], [[African Population and Health Research Center]], [[African medical and research foundation|African Medical Research Foundation]], the [[World Health Organization]] and the [[Ford Foundation]].&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Kenyan anthropologists do not conduct research for personal needs, but for needs of their nation-state and those funding agencies that they provide information to for health resolutions.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; In response to this upcoming need, universities are developing programs, like Anthropology in Developing Countries, Applied Anthropology, Medical Anthropology, and  Anthropology and Infectious Diseases, that educate for cultural developmental skills.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

=== Cameroon ===
Before [[Cameroon]] was split by the British and French in 1915 it was under the control of the German government since 1884.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Anthropologies Disciplinary Transformations within Systems of Power|last=Nkwi|first=Paul|publisher=Berg|year=2006|isbn=|editor-last=Ribeiro|editor-first=Gustavo|location=New York, New York|pages=157–178|chapter=Anthropology in a Postcolonial Africa The Survival Debate|editor-last2=Escobar|editor-first2=Arturo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very little Anthropological work was done until this time when the state recognized how useful knowing more about its people would be. Phyllis Kaberry and Elizabeth Chilver were two prominent researchers in West African area in the min-1900s.&lt;ref name=":63"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fokwang|first=Jude|date=September 2005|title=Cameroonising Anthropology: Some Trends and Implications|url=|journal=The African Anthropologist|volume= 12 |issue= 2|pages=181–198|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaberry, a trained anthropologist from England, studied women in a local tribe from the "grassfields" of Cameroon.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; She also co-wrote several books and papers on topics concerning female roles in specific African cultures.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; In 1973 the first institute in Cameroon with an anthropology department was established. In 1978 departments that were seen as not practical were starting to be eliminated.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt; After closing, reopening, and hiding within other departments, Anthropology was finally on the rise in the early 1990s.

==== Teaching ====

The [[University of Yaoundé I|University of Yaoundé-I]] is a main institution in the area providing students with opportunities to gain degrees in Anthropology.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt; Other Institutions of importance are the [[University of Ngaoundéré|University of Ngaoundere]] and the [[University of Buea]] which in 1992 added anthropology departments.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; Both of these universities produce scholars from the local communities and they promote research that is of common interest to the area. Language being a barrier in academia until its independence, in 1960, where universities were fashioned in the European style of education systems.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt; The University of Buea, a public university, offered the subjects in the English language which increased the number of local students that attend. Largely associated with sociology, the first person to gain a PhD in [[Social anthropology|Social Anthropology]] from Cameroon was Paul Nkwi in 1975. In 1993, a B.A. in anthropology could be received form the [[University of Yaoundé]].&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;

==== Research ====

[[File:CODESRIA.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CODESRIA.jpg|left|thumb|101x101px|CODESRIA]]
A stepping-stone organization was [[Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa|CODESRIA]], which was an organization that helped develop and promote anthropology as an institution.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt; It facilitated the establishment of the [[Pan African Anthropological Association]] (PAAA) in the 80s.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt; The PAAA is cooperative movement that unified Anthropologists from all over Africa. Its goal was to make anthropology known again as a useful and essential department that Africa needed.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt; This association is holding conferences annually, starting in 1989, to advance Anthropology and find ways to solve problems for the future.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt; Some dominant research topics in the area are witchcraft, chiefdoms, health, violence and ethno-history.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt; The PAAA started encouraging communication of cross disciplines to benefit Africa as a whole by discovering new ways of resolving issues.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt; A leading journal in Africa is the [[African Anthropologist|African Anthropology]], now known as [[African Anthropologist|The African Anthropologist]], allows research from all over Africa to be shared and more easily accessible.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt;

==== History ====

The history of the discipline of anthropology in South Africa comes from the result of political and ideological interpretations of the research there.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spiegel|first=Andrew D.|last2=Becker|first2=Heike|date=2015-12-01|title=South Africa: Anthropology or Anthropologies?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aman.12353/abstract|journal=American Anthropologist|language=en|volume=117|issue=4|pages=754–760|doi=10.1111/aman.12353|issn=1548-1433}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, the [[South African Association for the Advancement of Science]] was established, and it was here that anthropology was known.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Presentations were given by archeologists, linguists, anthropologists, and ethnologists; there was also a South African Journal of Science that many researchers published in as well.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; During the years of the 1940s to the 1990s, anthropology grew to be less popular due to the [[apartheid]] period, which in educators had strict guidelines as to what they could and couldn’t teach in the classroom, and they were not permitted to teach anything else but that particular curriculum.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Anthropological studies and research were offered at sixteen different universities, in which [[sociocultural anthropology]] and [[archaeology]] were offered within the discipline, and in another department, [[linguistics]], [[African studies]], and [[Gender studies]] were linked in the discipline.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Instead of using the word or teaching anthropology, the universities, more specifically [[Stellenbosch University]], taught [[Volkskunde|''volkekunde'']], which means knowledge about people, and it was first known from pre-WWII German passage that was written by [[wiktionary:Völkerkunde|Völkerkunde]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; This expansion of the discipline was also known as [[ethnology]] or [[cultural anthropology]], and it was paired with aspects of the apartheid period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://read.dukeupress.edu/lookup/doi/10.1215/9780822387107-012|title="Today We Have Naming of Parts"|last=Kuper|first=Adam|pages=277–299|language=en|doi=10.1215/9780822387107-012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused a division between social anthropology and volkekunde, as well as Afrikaans-medium universities and English-medium universities, respectively.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

==== Stellenbosch University and South African Relationship with the U.K. and U.S. ====

[[Stellenbosch University]] (an Afrikaan-medium university) had established its first anthropological department due to [[Max Eiselen|Werner Eiselen]], who was the Permanent Secretary in the National Department of Native Affairs, as well as being a developer of the concept of apartheid, with [[Hendrik Verwoerd]] being his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanders|first=Todd|date=1998|title=Review of Imperfect Interpreters: South Africa's Anthropologists 1920-1990|jstor=3034850|journal=The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute|volume=4|issue=4|pages=811–812|doi=10.2307/3034850}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were then new universities that were built in the 1960s, specifically for black students, which led to the continuation of the two types of universities within the area.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; The professors who obtained jobs at the new universities had a background that dealt with a volkekunde style of teaching anthropology. This entire movement didn’t appeal to those who identified themselves as social anthropologists in the discipline.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Even with this division of the methods to anthropological research, there was a mutual respect and influence for social anthropological studies that were being conducted by researchers in the U.K., as well as the U.S. Most students were moving on to proceed in getting their doctoral degrees preferred to attend the [[University of Cambridge]], due to its influence of academia through anthropologists who were South African natives, such as [[Meyer Fortes]], [[Isaac Schapera]], and [[Max Gluckman]]. South African anthropologists, such as [[Jean Comaroff]] and [[John Comaroff]] and Namibian-born Rob Gordon, who began their studies in their home region of South Africa, and more specifically at the Afrikaans-medium University of Stellenbosch, also had influence with the U.S. in their research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Robert|date=2014-04-03|title=Inside African anthropology: Monica Wilson and her interpreters|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23323256.2014.940183|journal=Anthropology Southern Africa|volume=37|issue=1-2|pages=135–138|doi=10.1080/23323256.2014.940183|issn=2332-3256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Self-Exile and Volkekunde Conference ====

[[File:The_University_of_South_Africa.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_University_of_South_Africa.jpg|thumb|290x290px|The University of South Africa]]
In the 1960s, South African anthropologists made the decision to start leaving their country for careers and research studies because of the apartheid methods, the inequality within their societies, and there was an increase in the violence that was surrounding the region. In 1967, a committee was formed in order to begin negotiating anthropological conferences that were held at the [[University of South Africa]], which added to the separation and tension of the social anthropologists and those who studied volkekunde.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Ten years later, black anthropologists started to attend these conferences, and this made the volkekunde group to initiate another new conference that was only to host research projects to those studying ethnology; this new conference was known in the [[Afrikaans]] language as ''Vereniging van Afrikaanse Volkekundiges'', which is translated to mean [[Association of Afrikaans Ethnologists]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; This conference excluded entry to those who did not speak the original Afrikaans language of South Africa, or the regional state area, and it continued to have majority and favor until the 1980s when the social anthropologists decided to have their own conference as well.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

==== Social Anthropology Conference ====

[[The Association for Anthropology in Southern Africa]] (AASA) was established in 1987 excluded membership into the group for those who believed in the apartheid concepts. Before anyone could become members of the conference, they were to sign a document, or a contract, saying that they reject any and all apartheid theories and concepts.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Regardless of this new conference, the methods of volkekunde remained to be prominent in the discipline of anthropology, though during the 1980s, the anthropology department of then known [[Rand Afrikaans University]], which was one of the newer White Afrikaans-medium universities in the area, officially denounced volkekunde as their way of research, in fact, the entire teaching department of this discipline turned their backs to apartheid concepts entirely.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Later on, [[Stellenbosch University]], which was where the first volkekunde department to be established, was closed down in the mid-1990s. A few years afterward, the discipline of social anthropology was introduced within the Department of Sociology.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

The new association of [http://www.asnahome.org/ Anthropology South Africa] was a cause to link the two distinguished branches of volkekunde and social anthropology. Its first annual conference was in 2001. In 2004, it became one of the founding members of the [https://www.wcaanet.org/ World Council of Anthropology Associations] in Brazil.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; There aren’t very many volkekundiges, or ethnologists, who have membership within the ASnA, nor do most of them attend any of the conferences that are held. A majority of those who do attend the annual conference are young, predominantly black, postgraduate anthropologists, but there are also a growing number of faculty members from the South African University anthropology programs who participate as well.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Though the faculty participation numbers are growing, the overall number of memberships within the ASnA fluctuate from year to year. This is due to postgraduates, who are members only having a membership for a year or two in order to obtain their dissertations.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; There is also a close link between membership and conference attendance, meaning that since the conferences are held in venues that are less accessible or less desirable, this doesn’t attract many anthropologists to participate and fewer people sign up for memberships.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

==== Topics of Research and Publication ====

Some of the topics of research for sociocultural anthropologists in South Africa consist of [[medical anthropology]], mostly concerning the [[HIV/AIDS pandemic]] in the region, [[development anthropology]], [[urbanism]], science and natural resources, conflict, violence and policing, [[human rights]], [[identity politics]] and belonging, and [[Popular culture studies|popular culture]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; There isn’t much attention paid to subjects, such as [[economic anthropology]], [[state formation]], and [[religion]] and [[religious movements]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Anthropologists at South African universities mostly publish to edited volumes and special theme collections in interdisciplinary and disciplinary journals in their own country, as well as internationally.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; One significant publication venue for South African anthropologists is the journal formerly known as the volkekunde’s Tydskrif van Suid Afrikaanse Volkekunde, which translates to [[Journal of South African Ethnology]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; The journal changed its name to [http://www.asnahome.org/ Anthropology Southern Africa] in 2002.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

== Postcolonial African Anthropology ==

=== The Future of the Discipline ===

Anthropologists, who studied in Africa and began their research from basic curiosities, cannot be of aid to how the discipline stays in existence.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Anthropology thrived from outside and inside perspectives of the same region or aspect of culture; having a [[Civilizing mission|missions civilisatrice]] perspective divided observer and participant, instead of taking into consideration the culture within the region from the perspectives of those who have lived there.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; The aspect of not being able, or not wanting to, collaborate with natives from the country was due to the [[Bronisław Malinowski|Malinowskian]] model.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Researchers developed their own personal objectives and reasoning to what and who they were observing in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Faris|first=Wendy B.|last2=Clifford|first2=James|title=The Predicament of Culture: Twentieth-Century Ethnography, Literature, and Art|jstor=1770355|journal=Comparative Literature|language=en|volume=44|issue=2|doi=10.2307/1770355}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused an explicit division of Africa into several regions based on finding and observing the exotic “Other” from various basis of culture, race, and location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/605/chapter/127376/|title=Beyond "Culture"|last=Gupta|first=Akhil|last2=Ferguson|first2=James|pages=33–51|language=en|doi=10.1215/9780822382089-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Imagining insiders: Africa and the question of belonging|url=http://choicereviews.org/review/10.5860/CHOICE.37-5492|journal=Choice Reviews Online|volume=37|issue=10|pages=37–5492–37-5492|doi=10.5860/choice.37-5492}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] helped anthropologists to realize that their personal needs and reasoning for research correlated with the aspect of seeing people differently instead of similarly.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; There was no insight from those who had inhabited the continent for centuries, and the country is not well represented.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; There was not a lot of support for methods that contradicted what had already been practiced and known within the discipline.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

Universally, there were various debates about the methodology of the discipline in relation to folklore, co-production with aid of natives, and boundaries within the field.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; These aspects had not been taken into consideration when observing the region. Anthropology surviving in Africa were due to not observing Africa explicitly as scientific (racially or geographically), not seeing African identities and cultures as scientific, redefining the Malinowskian model, and making the methods of fieldwork and participant observation more flexible.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Native anthropologists called for creative diversity and outsider anthropologists to observe themselves and how they contributed to the professional collaboration with those who were native to the region.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; This methodology or concept did not replace outside methods, but correlated the two methods together in knowledge about culture.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

The '''Institute of Business Studies formerly''' (IBS) now IBSUniversity is a tertiary education provider in Papua New Guinea, offering academic and professional courses in the fields of Accounting, Business and Information Technology. IBSU offers a combination of locally developed and International courses ranging from Certificates, Diploma’s and Degrees.

== History ==
IBS was originally set up in 1989 by entrepreneur Mick Nades. It provided revision classes for the Papua New Guinea Institute of Accountants (PNGIA) professional exams, at which time none existed.
At its inception, there were only nine qualified Papua New Guinean Accountants amongst the cohort of 300+ Commerce/Accounting graduates from the University of Papua New Guinea (UPNG) and the University of Technology (UNITECH).
IBS produced the first two female Accountants of Papua New Guinea. The Institute’s objective was to enhance the prospects for Papua New Guineans to study and further their careers in Accounting, Business and Computing.

== About IBSU ==

The IBSUniversity is an innovative university located in Port Moresby, capital of Papua New Guinea. It was established in 1st December 2016 with the ordinance of National Executive Council and gazette on 25th January 2017.

It took 28 years of visionary driven commitment and hard work of Sir Mick Nades, the man behind with this noble contribution to the educational growth of Papua New Guineans. IBS beginning can be traced back to 1989, conducting revision classes for the Professional Examinations of the CPA PNG (then PNGIA).  With the success of producing professional accountants, there was a demand to provide Certificate Courses for Grade 10/12 School Levers. 

IBS developed and offered its Certificate in Accounting, based on the syllabus of Accounting Technicians of United Kingdom in 2002. Certificate in Computing course was introduced in 2003. These two courses evolved as the primary wheels of IBS then.

More and more school leavers joined IBS at Saraga Campus to follow the above courses. IBS became a Study Centre of UPNG in 1995, and commenced classes for Diploma in Commerce (now Diploma in Accounting) a two year programme till 2016.

IBS formed an educational collaboration agreement with Southern Cross University in 1999 and started their Bachelor Degree of Business and Information Technology Programmes. These programs are offered in Mt. Eriama Campus in Port Moresby and Irelya Campus in Enga.

'''International Business School of Scandinavia - IBSS''' is a business school.
Started in 2004 with focus on privately run MBA programs through [[Blended learning]].
Programs run both in English as well as local languages around the world together with local partners.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Programs==
[[MBA]] in General Management
MBA in Human Resource
MBA in International Sales &amp; Marketing

The programs are a mix of theory and practice based training.

Through the training method "blended learning" participants can have international seminars from anywhere in the world and training material is supplied both online and during the face2face training.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Brief history==
IBSS history started in 2000, as a subsidiary with the aim to conduct educations and degree programs.

In 2004 the official school was established.

2009 IBSS initiated international status with sub activities done online.
Furthermore IBSS focus on international accreditation programs – which have not been of any need in Denmark but which are highly wanted internationally.
IBSS collaborates with the a number of universities in countries such as [[Malaysia]], UK, US, [[Bangladesh]] and [[Vietnam]].

A brief about IBSS cooperation internationally
IBSS has distinguished history of relations with External educational organizations, institutions and Universities.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

2009~ IBSS started its international Activities (outside of Scandinavian countries). Currently IBSS is conducting funding a PHD study with Aalborg University on the effects of blended learning in developing countries.

IBSS is running its own MBA programs but is also internationally conducting programs with universities in fields of diploma, BA and Doctorate programs.

One of IBSS major partners is [[Asia e University]] in [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref name="Academic Partners"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibss.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=110&amp;Itemid=1015|title=Academic Partners|publisher=International Business School of Scandinavia|accessdate=30 April 20125|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310203109/http://www.ibss.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=110&amp;Itemid=1015|archivedate=10 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Federation of Automatic Control''' (IFAC), founded in September 1957, is a multinational federation of 49 national member organizations (NMO), each one representing the [[engineering]] and [[scientific]] societies concerned with [[automatic control]] in its own country.

The aim of the Federation is to promote the science and technology of control in the broadest sense in all systems, whether, for example, [[engineering]], physical, [[biology|biological]], [[social]] or [[economic]], in both [[theory]] and application. IFAC is also concerned with the impact of control technology on society.

IFAC pursues its purpose by organizing technical meetings, by publications, and by any other means consistent with its [[constitution]] and which will enhance the interchange and circulation of information on automatic control activities.
 
International World Congresses are held every three years. Between congresses, IFAC sponsors many symposia, conferences and workshops covering particular aspects of automatic control. 

The official journals of IFAC are [[Automatica]], [[Control Engineering Practice]], [[Annual Reviews in Control]], [[Journal of Process Control]], [[Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence]], and the [[Journal of Mechatronics]], [[  Nonlinear Analysis: Hybrid Systems]], and  [[IFAC Journal of Systems &amp; Control.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25088">In [[human&amp;ndash;computer interaction]], the '''keystroke-level model''' ('''KLM''') predicts how long it will take an expert user to accomplish a routine task without errors using an interactive computer system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Allen|first3=Newell|title=The keystroke-level model for user performance time with interactive systems|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=1980|volume=23|issue=7|pages=396–410|doi=10.1145/358886.358895|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was proposed by [[Stuart K. Card]], [[Thomas P. Moran]] and [[Allen Newell]] in 1980 in the ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'' and published in their book ''The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction'' in 1983, which is considered as a classic in the HCI field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sauro|first1=Jeff|title=5 Classic Usability Books|url=http://www.measuringu.com/blog/usability-books.php|website=MeasuringU|accessdate=22 June 2015|ref=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perlman|first1=Gary|title=Suggested Readings in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), User Interface (UI) Development, &amp; Human Factors (HF)|url=http://hcibib.org/readings.html|website=HCI Bibliography : Human-Computer Interaction Resources|accessdate=22 June 2015|ref=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundations were laid in 1974, when Card and Moran joined the [[PARC (company)|Palo Alto Research Center]] (PARC) and created a group named Applied Information-Processing Psychology Project (AIP) with Newell as a consultant aiming to create an applied psychology of human-computer interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction|date=1983|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates Inc|location=Hillsdale|isbn=0898592437|pages=ix-x|ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The keystroke-level model is still relevant today, which is shown by the recent research about mobile phones and touchscreens (see [[#Adaptions|Adaptions]]).

== Structure of the keystroke-level model ==
The keystroke-level model consists of six operators: the first four are physical motor operators followed by one mental operator and one system response operator:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The keystroke-level model for user performance time with interactive systems|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=1980|volume=23|issue=7|pages=398–400|doi=10.1145/358886.358895|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''K''' (keystroke or button press): it is the most frequent operator and means keys and not characters (so e.g. pressing SHIFT is a separate K operation). The time for this operator depends on the motor skills of the user and is determined by one-minute typing tests, where the total test time is divided by the total number of non-error keystrokes.
* '''P''' (pointing to a target on a display with a mouse): this time differs depending on the distance to the target and the size of the target,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fitts|first1=Paul M|title=The information capacity of the human motor system in controlling the amplitude of movement|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|date=1992|volume=47|issue=3|doi=10.1037/h0055392|ref=3|pmid=13174710|pages=381–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is held constant. A mouse click is not contained and counts as a separate K operation.
* '''H''' (homing the hand(s) on the keyboard or other device): This includes movement between any two devices as well as the fine positioning of the hand.
* '''D''' (drawing (manually) n&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; straight-line segments with a total length of D(n&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;, l&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;) cm): where n&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of the line segments drawn and l&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; is the total length of the line segments. This operator is very specialized because it is restricted to the mouse and the drawing system has to constrain the cursor to a .56&amp;nbsp;cm grid.
* '''M''' (mentally preparing for executing physical actions): denotes the time a user needs for thinking or decision making. The number of Ms in a method depends on the knowledge and skill of the user. Heuristics are given to help decide where an M should be placed in a method. For example, when pointing with the mouse a button press is usually fully anticipated and no M is needed between both operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The keystroke-level model for user performance time with interactive systems|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=1980|volume=23|issue=7|pages=400–401|doi=10.1145/358886.358895|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following table shows the heuristics for placing the M operator:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The keystroke-level model for user performance time with interactive systems|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=1980|volume=23|issue=7|pages=400|doi=10.1145/358886.358895|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable collapsible" border="1"
|- 
| colspan="2" | Begin with a method encoding that includes all physical operators and response operations.&lt;br /&gt;
Use Rule 0 to place candidate Ms, and then cycle through Rules 1 to 4 for each M to see whether it should be deleted.
|-
| width="10%" align="center" | Rule 0 || Insert Ms in front of all Ks that are not part of argument strings proper (e.g., text strings or numbers).&lt;br /&gt;
Place Ms in front of all Ps that select commands (not arguments).
|-
| width="10%" align="center" | Rule 1 || If an operator following an M is fully anticipated in the operator just previous to M, then delete the M (e.g., PMK -&gt; PK). 
|-
| width="10%" align="center" | Rule 2 || If a string of MKs belong to a cognitive unit (e.g., the name of a command), then delete all Ms but the first.
|-
| width="10%" align="center" | Rule 3 || If a K is a redundant terminator (e.g., the terminator of a command immediately following the terminator of its argument), then delete the M in front of the K.
|-
| width="10%" align="center" | Rule 4 || If a K terminates a constant string (e.g., a command name), then delete the M in front of the K; but if the K terminates a variable string (e.g., an argument string) then keep the M. 
|}

* '''R''' (response time of the system): the response time depends on the system, the command and the context of the command. It only used when the user actually has to wait for the system. For instance, when the user mentally prepares (M) for executing his next physical action only the non-overlapping part of the response time is needed for R because the user uses the response time for the M operation (e.g. R of 2 seconds – M of 1.35 seconds = R of .65 seconds). To make things clearer, Kieras &lt;ref name=Kieras&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kieras|first1=David|title=Using the Keystroke-Level Model to Estimate Execution Times|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~itm/688/KierasKLMTutorial2001.pdf|accessdate=22 June 2015|ref=9|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests the naming waiting time (W) instead of response time (R) to avoid confusion. Sauro suggests taking a sample of the system response time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sauro|first1=Jeff|editor1-last=Jacko|editor1-first=Julie A|title=Estimating productivity: Composite operators for keystroke level modeling|journal=Human-Computer Interaction.

== Comparison with GOMS ==
The KLM is based on the keystroke level, which belongs to the family of [[GOMS]] models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction|date=1983|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates Inc|location=Hillsdale|isbn=0898592437|pages=161–166|ref=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KLM and the GOMS models have in common that they only predict behaviour of experts without errors, but in contrast the KLM needs a specified method to predict the time because it does not predict the method like GOMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction|date=1983|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates Inc|location=Hillsdale|isbn=0898592437|pages=260|ref=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the KLM has no goals and method selection rules, which in turn makes it easier to use.&lt;ref name="klm-book-goms"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction|date=1983|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates Inc|location=Hillsdale|isbn=0898592437|pages=269|ref=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KLM resembles the model K1 from the family of GOMS models the most because both are at the keystroke level and possess a generic M operator. The difference is that the M operator of the KLM is more aggregated and thus larger (1.35 seconds vs. 0.62 seconds), which makes its mental operator more similar to the CHOOSE operations of the model K2.&lt;ref name="klm-book-goms" /&gt; All in all, the KLM represents the practical use of the GOMS keystroke level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction|date=1983|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates Inc|location=Hillsdale|isbn=0898592437|pages=264|ref=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==
The KLM was designed to be a quick and easy to use system design tool, which means that no deep knowledge about [[psychology]] is required for its usage.&lt;ref name="klm-paper-advantages"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The keystroke-level model for user performance time with interactive systems|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=1980|volume=23|issue=7|pages=409|doi=10.1145/358886.358895|ref=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, task times can be predicted (given the [[#Limitations|limitations]]) without having to build a [[prototype]], recruit and test users, which saves time and money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sauro|first1=Jeff|editor1-last=Jacko|editor1-first=Julie A|title=Estimating productivity: Composite operators for keystroke level modeling|journal=Human-Computer Interaction. New Trends: Proceedings of the 13th International Conference (LNCS)|date=2009|volume=5610|pages=352–361|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-02574-7_40|ref=20|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin Heidelberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; See the [[#Example|example]] for a practical use of the KLM as a system design tool.

== Limitations ==
The keystroke-level model has several restrictions:
* It measures only one aspect of performance: time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The keystroke-level model for user performance time with interactive systems|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=1980|volume=23|issue=7|pages=400|doi=10.1145/358886.358895|ref=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means execution time and not the time to acquire or learn a task &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction|date=1983|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates Inc|location=Hillsdale|isbn=0898592437|pages=260–261|ref=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It considers only expert users. Generally, users differ regarding their knowledge and experience of different systems and tasks, motor skills and technical ability &lt;ref name="klm-paper-limitations-users"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The keystroke-level model for user performance time with interactive systems|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=1980|volume=23|issue=7|pages=397, 409|doi=10.1145/358886.358895}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It considers only routine unit tasks &lt;ref name="klm-paper-limitations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The keystroke-level model for user performance time with interactive systems|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=1980|volume=23|issue=7|pages=409|doi=10.1145/358886.358895|ref=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The method has to be specified step by step&lt;ref name="klm-paper-limitations" /&gt;
* The execution of the method has to be error-free &lt;ref name="klm-paper-limitations" /&gt;
* The mental operator aggregates different mental operations and therefore cannot model a deeper representation of the user’s mental operations. If this is crucial, a GOMS model has to be used (e.g. model K2)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction|date=1983|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates Inc|location=Hillsdale|isbn=0898592437|pages=285–286|ref=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, one should keep in mind when assessing a computer system that other aspects of performance (errors, learning, functionality, recall, concentration, fatigue, and acceptability),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The keystroke-level model for user performance time with interactive systems|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=1980|volume=23|issue=7|pages=396–397|doi=10.1145/358886.358895|ref=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; types of users (novice, casual)&lt;ref name="klm-paper-limitations-users" /&gt; and non-routine tasks have to be considered as well.&lt;ref name="klm-paper-limitations-users"/&gt;

Furthermore, tasks which take more than a few minutes take several hours to model and a source of errors is forgetting operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sauro|first1=Jeff|editor1-last=Jacko|editor1-first=Julie A|title=Estimating productivity: Composite operators for keystroke level modeling|journal=Human-Computer Interaction. New Trends: Proceedings of the 13th International Conference (LNCS)|date=2009|volume=5610|page=353|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-02574-7_40|ref=28|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin Heidelberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that the KLM is best suited for short tasks with few operators.
In addition, the KLM can not make a perfect prediction and has a root-mean-square error of 21%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction|date=1983|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates Inc|location=Hillsdale|isbn=0898592437|pages=275|ref=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
The following example slightly modified to be more compact from Kieras shows the practical use of the KLM by comparing two different ways to delete a file for an average skilled typist. Note that M is 1.35 seconds as stated in the KLM&lt;ref name="klm-paper-operators-table" /&gt;&lt;ref name="klm-book-operators-table" /&gt; instead of 1.2 seconds used by Kieras. The difference between the two designs would remain the same either way for this example.

This shows that Design B is 1 second faster than Design A, although it contains more operations.

== Adaptions ==

The six operators of the KLM can be reduced, but this decreases the accuracy of the model. If this low of an accuracy makes sense (e.g. “back-of-the-envelope” calculations) such a simplification can be sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction|date=1983|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates Inc|location=Hillsdale|isbn=0898592437|pages=296|ref=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the existing KLM applies to desktop applications, the model might not fulfill the range of mobile tasks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Hui|last2=Liu|first2=Ying|last3=Liu|first3=Jun|last4=Wang|first4=Xia|last5=Li|first5=Yujiang|last6=Rau|first6=Pei-Luen Patrick|title=Extended KLM for mobile phone interaction: a user study result|journal=CHI EA '10 CHI '10 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems|date=2010|publisher=ACM|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60558-930-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as Dunlop and Cross &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dunlop|first1=M.|last2=Crossan|first2=A.|title=Predictive Text Entry Methods for Mobile Phones|journal=Personal Technologies|date=2000|pages=134–143}}&lt;/ref&gt; declaimed KLM is no longer precise for mobile devices. There are various efforts to extend the KLM regarding the use for mobile phones or touch devices. One of the significant contributions to this field is done by Holleis, who retained existing operators while revisiting the timing specifications. Furthermore, he introduced new operators: Distraction (X), Gesture (G), Initial Act (I). 
While Li and Holleis &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holleis|first1=P.|last2=Otto|first2=F.|last3=Hussmann|first3=H.|last4=Schmidt|first4=A.|title=Keystroke-level model for advanced mobile phone interaction|journal=CHI ’07: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|date=2007|doi=10.1145/1240624.1240851}}&lt;/ref&gt; both agree that the KLM model can be applied to predict task times on mobile devices, Li suggests further modifications to the model, by introducing a new concept called operator blocks. These are defined as "the sequence of operators that can be used with high repeatability by analyst of the extended KLM.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Hui|last2=Liu|first2=Ying|last3=Liu|first3=Jun|last4=Wang|first4=Xia|last5=Li|first5=Yujiang|last6=Rau|first6=Pei-Luen Patrick|title=Extended KLM for mobile phone interaction: a user study result|journal=CHI EA '10 CHI '10 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems|date=2010|publisher=ACM|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60558-930-5|page=3521}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also discards old operators and defines 5 new mental operators and 9 new physical operators, while 4 of the physical operators focus on pen-based operations. 
Rice and Lartigue &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rice|first1=A.D.|last2=Lartigue|first2=J. W.|title=Touch-Level Model ( TLM ): Evolving KLM-GOMS for Touchscreen and Mobile Devices Categories and Subject Descriptors|journal=ACM SE '14 Proceedings of the 2014 ACM Southeast Regional Conference Article No. 53|date=2014|doi=10.1145/2638404.2638532}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest numerous operators for touch devices together with updating existing operators naming the model TLM (Touch Level Model).
They retain the operators Keystroke (K/B), Homing (H), Mental (M) and Response Time (R(t)) and suggest new touch specific operators partly based on Holleis’ suggested operators:

* Distraction. A multiplicative operator that adds time to other operators. 
* Pinch. A 2+ finger gesture commonly used to zoom out
* Zoom. A 2+ finger gesture commonly used to zoom in
* Initial Act. The action or actions necessary to prepare the system for use (e.g. unlocking device, tapping an icon, entering a password).
* Tap. Tapping some area of the screen to effect a change or initiate an action.
* Swipe. A 1+ finger gesture in which a finger or fingers are placed on the screen and subsequently moved in a single direction for a specified amount of time.
* Tilt. The tilting — or full rotation of — the entire device d degrees (or radians).
* Rotate. A 2+ finger gesture in which fingers are placed on the screen and then rotated d degrees (or radians) about a central axis.
* Drag. A 1+ finger gesture in which fingers are placed on the screen and then moved — usually in a straight line — to another location.

Generally, a '''local administrative unit (LAU)''' is a low level [[administrative division]] of a country, ranked below a [[province]], [[region]], or [[State (administrative division)|state]].  Not all countries describe their locally governed areas this way, but it can be descriptively applied anywhere to refer to counties, municipalities, etc.

In the [[European Union]], LAUs are basic components of [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|Classification of Territorial Units for Statistics]] (NUTS) regions. For each [[Member of the European Union|EU member country]], two levels of Local Administrative Units (LAU) are defined: LAU 1 and LAU 2, which were previously called NUTS 4 and NUTS 5 respectively, until the NUTS regulation went into force in July 2003. For some countries, the LAU 1 level is not defined, and thus equivalent to the NUTS 3 level. A similar statistical system is defined for the [[Future enlargement of the European Union#Recognised candidates|candidate countries]] and members of the [[European Free Trade Association]].

The '''maiden flight''' of an aircraft is the first occasion on which an aircraft leaves the ground under its own power. The same term is also used for the first launch of rockets. 

The first flight of a new aircraft type is always a historic occasion for the type and can be quite emotional for those involved. In the early days of aviation it could be dangerous, because the exact handling characteristics of the aircraft were generally unknown. The first flight of a new type is almost invariably flown by a highly experienced [[test pilot]]. First flights are usually accompanied by a [[chase plane]], to verify items like altitude, airspeed, and general [[airworthiness]].

A first flight is only one stage in the development of an aircraft type. Unless the type is a pure research aircraft (such as the [[X-15]]), the aircraft must be tested extensively to ensure that it delivers the desired performance with an acceptable margin of safety. In the case of civilian aircraft, a new type must be certified by a governing agency (such as the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] in the United States) before it can enter operation.

'''Malagana''', also known as the '''Malagana Treasure''' is an [[Archaeological sites in Colombia|archaeological site of Colombia]] named after the same name [[sugarcane]] [[estate (house)|estate]] where it was accidentally discovered in 1992 (Malagana being a [[misspelling]] of [[Málaga]]).  During a few days after its discovery, the place was subject to a large scale [[grave robbing|looting]] with a rough estimated of 4 [[ton]]s of [[pre-Columbian]] [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] illegally removed from the [[burial mound]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eldoradocolombia.com/guaqueria.html&lt;/ref&gt;  A rescue archaeological mission was sent by the National Institute of Anthropology and History (ICANH), led by archaeologist [[Marianne Cardale de Schrimpff]]. Archaeological excavations at the site established a previously unknown cultural complex, designated as Malagana-Sonsoid, that dates between 300 BC to 300 AD

== Discovery ==
The discovery of the Malagana Treasure began with an accident in a sugar-cane field at [[Hacienda]] Malagana, which is situated on the flatlands of the fertile [[Cauca river]] valley, near the city of Palmira in western Colombia.   A worker was driving a piece of heavy equipment (a tractor)&lt;ref name="Warwick-p94-111"&gt;Bray Warwick (2000). "Malagana and the Goldworking Tradition of Southwest Colombia".  In ''Precolumbian Gold: Technology, Style and Iconography'' (Colin McEwan, ed.). British Museum Press, London. {{ISBN|0-7141-2534-2}}, pp.94-111.&lt;/ref&gt; across the field when the ground suddenly [[cave in|collapsed]], and the vehicle fell into a large hole.  As the driver inspected his predicament, something shiny caught his eye.  The object was made of gold, and the hole turned out to be an ancient [[hypogeum]].  The worker removed some of the [[Goldsmith|goldwork]] items and quietly sold them.  Before long, his activities caught the attention of others.  Between October and December 1992, [[gold rush|hoards of gold-seekers]] arrived to Hacienda Malagana's sugar-cane field.&lt;ref name="Warwick-p94-111" /&gt;  According to newspaper accounts, the looters numbered as many as 5,000.  Reporters on the scene captured the bedlam on camera and published their photographs in newspapers.&lt;ref name="IARC"&gt;IARC [Illicit Antiquities Research Center] Colombia, illicit antiquities and ICOM Red List Latin America.  Culture Without Context, Issue 12, Spring 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Even the police and army on the scene were ineffective in controlling the chaos, including one murder, and the wide scale destruction of the ancient cemetery.  Countless artifacts were carried off by the treasure hunters.  The weight of the gold objects that were taken from the site has been estimated at 160 kilograms (352 pounds) by one source (Bray 2000:94) and between 140 kilograms (308 pounds) and 180 kilograms (396 pounds) by another, who speculates that the amount might even have been greater than 180 kilograms.&lt;ref name="IARC" /&gt;

Late in 1992 the [[Gold Museum, Bogotá|Gold Museum]] in Bogotá received an impressive assortment of the gold objects made in an unfamiliar style.  Research revealed that the source of the artifacts was the Hacienda Malagana site.&lt;ref&gt;Banco de la República (2005a).  From Board Room to Modern Museum: Gold Ended Up Asserting its Authority.  Museo del Oro, Bogotá, D.C.  {{cite web |url=http://www.banrep.gov.co/museo/eng/nm_moderno.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924031513/http://www.banrep.gov.co/museo/eng/nm_moderno.htm |archivedate=2006-09-24 |df= }} Retrieved November 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeological excavations ==
Even though plunderers were still present, archaeological investigations of the Hacienda Malagana cemetery were attempted in March 1993, but had to be discontinued after only a few days.  In that brief period the archaeologists were able to examine three of the tombs and to observe the site's [[stratigraphy]], which indicated a record of prolonged habitation.  One grave yielded two gold beads and a pottery vessel that the looters had overlooked.  A [[radiocarbon date]] of AD 70 +/- 60 (uncalibrated) was obtained from the debris inside the pottery vessel.  After the site had finally been abandoned by the treasurer hunters, more extensive excavations were conducted late in 1994.  Because the cemetery area of the site had been destroyed, the 1994 excavations focused on a residential area some 500 meters from the ransacked cemetery area.  These excavations revealed a lengthy and complex stratigraphy, seventeen burials, four occupation periods, and additional radiocarbon dates.  The occupational periods were designated as "Proto-Llama" (earliest period), "Llama," "Malagana," and "Sonsoid" (latest) (Bray 2000:94-95).  Links in the form of trade by the inhabitants of Malagana with groups in the San Agustín and Tierradentro areas to the south and with the Tolima and Quimbaya areas to the east and north are apparent in the artifact assemblies.  By the Malagana period, Malagana had developed as a regional culture with a distinguishable style.

== Museo del Oro (Gold Museum) ==
After receiving the initial gold items, the Museum of Gold launched a campaign to locate and recover as many artifacts as possible that were stolen from the tombs of the main cemetery at Hacienda Malagana.  Over 150 objects were acquired as a result of this endeavor.  While the gold items themselves are spectacular to look at, their ability to give important data about the people who created them was lost in the 1992 "gold rush" when they were ripped from tombs in which they had been placed many centuries before.  Although some physical information about the artifacts themselves may be gained by careful study of the objects, their true value of providing clues to the past is possible only when the objects are found in their [[archaeological context|original cultural context]].  Remarkably, museum archaeologists were able to obtain general information about the archaeological context for a number of these objects by pursuing accounts from individuals who had witnessed the plundering frenzy of 1992.  As a result, the archaeologists were able to designate the artifact assemblies for twenty-nine of the graves, which provides important knowledge not only about religion and burial practices, but also about the political and social structures and value systems of the Malagana culture (Bray 2000:94-95).

== Description of Tomb 1 and its contents, main cemetery ==
In several instances interviews with the 1992 observers coupled with meticulous study of the artifacts, the actual arrangement of the gold, pottery and other items in the tombs have been able to be reconstructed by the archaeologists.  One such tomb is Tomb 1, which is among the most prolific from the main cemetery of the site.  Bray describes the layout of the tomb, as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The tomb consisted of a rectangular shaft about 3 m deep, filled with [[gravel]] and river sand containing specks of alluvial gold.  The floor was paved with rectangular slabs of a white granitic stone foreign to the [[Cauca River|Cauca]] [[floodplain]], and a single course of more rounded stones had been placed around the base of the wall to define the funerary area.  A conical object of carved stone lay somewhere in the burial zone.

The body was stretched out on its back on the floor of the tomb, and the face was covered by three large [[Metal leaf#Gold leaf|gold leaf]] [[death mask|masks]], one on top of the other.  In the neck area were tubular gold beads and little gold birds, together with necklaces of coloured stone beads, carved [[emerald]]s and red [[Spondylus]] shells, and enough tiny stone beads to form a string about 50 m long.  Gold beads were found in the neck area and in a single row on the chest.  A sheet-gold mask concealed the feet of the corpse.  The published accounts also list two pendant-plaques and two plaques for sewing onto textiles.  A set of bone tubes (or cylindrical beads) found just below the waist may have been attached to a loincloth or kilt like those represented on miniature gold figurines, and the legs of the skeleton were separated by a line of rock crystal beads.  In a niche in the wall above the head of the corpse were two Ilama-style pots: one a bowl with four feet and the other an alcarraza (a vessel with two spouts joined by a bridge handle) in the form of a recumbent woman.  A layer of between fifty and one hundred stone slabs of various sizes covered and protected the entire funerary deposit (Bray 2000:96-97).  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Malagana treasure preserved ==
Prior to 1939 the gold objects that treasure hunters removed illegally from archaeological sites were either taken to the bank to be exchanged for cash or were sold to gallery owners and dealers in art and antiquities.  The gold purchased by the bank was melted down.  The items acquired by the galleries and dealers were resold to private collectors, museums, and other institutions, many of which were destined for other countries.  In 1939 a man named Julio Caro convinced the board of the Banco de la República in Bogotá that the gold items should be preserved and retained within Colombia.  The gold artifacts that were accumulated were kept in the bank's boardroom and, from 1947 to 1959, were shown only to important visitors.  In 1959 the bank constructed a new building, which contained a long room in the basement lined with showcases displaying the artifacts.  For the first time the public was permitted to see the golden treasures of the past.  When another new building for the bank was under construction in 1970, several individuals associated with the bank promoted the idea of making it into a first-class scientific museum for the exhibition of their collection.  Museum experts and anthropologists were called in to bring order and cultural milieu to the exhibits.  Upon completion of the four-storied, prism-shaped Museo del Oro building, the treasures of the Malagana culture and the other cultures of Colombia received the finest of accommodations for their preservation and for the enlightenment of present and future generations &lt;ref&gt;The Renovation of the Gold Museum, Bogotá, Colombia.  Museo del Oro, Bogotá, D.C.  {{cite web |url=http://www.banrep.gov.co/museo/eng/nm_transforma.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924031905/http://www.banrep.gov.co/museo/eng/nm_transforma.htm |archivedate=2006-09-24 |df= }}  Retrieved November 29, 2006(Banco de la República 2005a).&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2004, the Museo del Oro launched the first of a three-stage renovation to its facilities and exhibits.  When the project is completed in 2007, the treasures will be displayed with the latest, state-of-the-art techniques.  One of the goals of the renovations is to communicate to the viewer the lives of the objects and their makers in the most effective way possible (Banco de la República, 2005b).

Some of the gold artifacts were recently displayed in the United States.  The Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., presented an exhibit entitled "The Spirit of Ancient Colombia Gold" from November 9, 2005, through April 9, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian Institution.  The Spirit of Ancient Colombian Gold.  Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, Washington, D.C., 2005.  [http://www.mnh.si.edu/exhibits/gold/index.htm]  Retrieved on November 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  A total of 280 gold objects were loaned from the Museo del Oro of Bogotá for the exhibition.  A funerary mask, made of hammered-sheet gold in the Malagana style and dating between 200 BC and 200 AD, is depicted on the Smithsonian Institution's webpage announcing the exhibit (Smithsonian Institution 2005).
Sometime between 200 BC and AD 200, the Malagana treasure was laid with respect in tombs in a cemetery near Hacienda Malagana.  In 1992 the major portion of these treasures were ripped from their earthen resting places and were melted or transported to unknown places.  Now, the few examples that remain of the Malagana treasure, along with artifacts of its neighboring cultures, are once again under the control of their home country and housed with respect.  The treasure inspires its makers' descendants and the rest of the world with a sense of awe and utmost esteem for the craftsmen and culture of its origin.

The '''Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics''' is a former institute of the [[Max Planck Society]] in [[Germany]]. Located in [[Garching]] near [[Munich]], it was home to scientists such as [[Werner Heisenberg]]. The institute was founded in 1958 as a successor to the [[Max Planck Institute for Physics]] in [[Göttingen]]. In 1991, it was split into two successor institutes, the current [[Max Planck Institute for Physics]] and [[Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics]], both located in Garching.

      <comment>No, it is not. Most Christians today are Trinitarians, but not all of them. Historically speaking, Trinitarianism developed in late antiquity, several centuries after the beginning of Christianity, as one of several proposed solutions to the problem of the relationship between Jesus, God the Father, and the Holy Spirit, which is never actually clarified in the Bible itself. Christians before that time were still Christians, perhaps not "orthodox" Christians, but Christians nonetheless.</comment>

"Monotheism" Accessed 23 January 2013, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/390101/monotheism&lt;/ref&gt;

Monotheism is distinguished from [[henotheism]], a religious system in which the believer worships one god without denying that others may worship different gods with equal validity, and [[monolatrism]], the recognition of the existence of many gods but with the consistent worship of only one deity.&lt;ref&gt;Frank E. Eakin, Jr. ''The Religion and Culture of Israel'' (Boston: Allyn and Bacon, 1971), 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "monolatry" was perhaps first used by [[Julius Wellhausen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mackintosh|first=Robert|year=1916|title=Monolatry and Henotheism|journal=Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics|volume=VIII|pages=810|url=https://archive.org/details/EncyclopaediaOfReligionAndEthics.Hastings-selbie-gray.13Vols|accessdate=Jan 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The broader definition of monotheism characterizes the traditions of [[Bábism]], the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[Balinese Hinduism]], [[Cao Dai|Cao Dai (Caodaiism)]], [[Cheondoism|Cheondoism (Cheondogyo)]], [[Christianity]], [[Deism]], [[Eckankar]], [[Hindu sects]] such as [[Shaivism]] and [[Vaishnavism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Mandaeism]], [[Rastafari]], [[Seicho no Ie]], [[Sikhism]], [[Tengrism]] (Tangrism), [[Tenrikyo|Tenrikyo (Tenriism)]], [[Yazidism]], and [[Zoroastrianism]], and elements of pre-monotheistic thought are found in early [[religion]]s such as [[Atenism]], [[Chinese folk religion|ancient Chinese religion]], and [[Yahweh#Iron Age I (1200–930 BCE): El, Yahweh, and the origins of Israel|Yahwism]].&lt;ref&gt;References:&lt;br&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''[[:wikt:monotheism|monotheism]]'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:μόνος|μόνος]]}} (''monos'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368642 Monos], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "single" and {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:θεός|θεός]]}} (''theos'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2348292 Theos], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "[[Deity|god]]".&lt;ref&gt;The compound {{lang|el|μονοθεισμός}} is current only in [[Modern Greek]]. There is a single attestation of {{lang|grc|μονόθεον}} in a Byzantine hymn (''Canones Junii'' 20.6.43; A. Acconcia Longo and G. Schirò, ''Analecta hymnica graeca, vol. 11 e codicibus eruta Italiae inferioris''. Rome: Istituto di Studi Bizantini e Neoellenici. Università di Roma, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; The English term was first used by [[Henry More]] (1614–1687).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Explanation of the Grand Mystery of Godliness |last=More |first=Henry |year=1660 |publisher= Flesher &amp; Morden |location=London |page= 62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
{{Primary sources|section|date=July 2017}}
Quasi-monotheistic claims of the existence of a universal deity date to the [[Late Bronze Age]], with [[Akhenaten]]'s ''[[Great Hymn to the Aten]]''. A possible inclination towards monotheism emerged during the [[Vedic period]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Sharma | first= Chandradhar | title= Indian Philosophy: A Critical Survey| publisher= Barnes &amp; Noble| location= New York | year= 1962 | page= vi | chapter= Chronological Summary of History of Indian Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Iron-Age South Asia. The [[Rigveda]] exhibits notions of [[monism]] of the [[Brahman]], particularly in the comparatively late [[Mandala 10|tenth book]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv10190.htm HYMN CXC. Creation.]&lt;/ref&gt; which is dated to the early [[Iron Age]], e.g. in the [[Nasadiya sukta]]. 

Since the sixth century BCE, [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] have believed in the supremacy of one God above all: [[Ahura Mazda]] as the "Maker of All"&lt;ref&gt;Yasna, XLIV.7&lt;/ref&gt; and the first being before all others.&lt;ref&gt;"First and last for all Eternity, as the Father of the Good Mind, the true Creator of Truth and Lord over the actions of life." (Yasna 31.8)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Vispanam Datarem", ''Creator of All'' (Yasna 44.7)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Data Angheush", ''Creator of Life'' (Yasna 50.11)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2330.htm NYÂYIS.]&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Zoroastrianism was not strictly monotheistic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duchesne-Guillemin|first1=Jacques|title=Zoroastrianism|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Zoroastrianism|website=Britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it venerated other ''[[yazatas]]'' alongside Ahura Mazda. Ancient Hindu theology, meanwhile, was [[monist]], but was not strictly monotheistic in worship because it still maintained the existence of many gods, who were envisioned as aspects of one supreme God, [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Numerous ancient Greek philosophers, including [[Xenophanes of Colophon]] and [[Antisthenes]] believed in a similar polytheistic monism that came close to monotheism, but fell short.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Judaism was the first religion to conceive the notion of a personal monotheistic God within a monist context.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pBSJNDndGjwC&amp;pg=PA225#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=No Other Gods: Emergent Monotheism in Israel|first=Robert Karl|last=Gnuse|date=1 May 1997|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press|isbn=1-85075-657-0|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of [[ethical monotheism]], which holds that morality stems from God alone and that its laws are unchanging,&lt;ref name=EncyclopediaBritannica&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethical monotheism|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1770434/ethical-monotheism|website=britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JVL&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prager|first1=Dennis|title=Ethical Monotheism|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/mono.html|website=jewishvirtuallibrary.org|publisher=American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; first occurred in [[Judaism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fischer|first1=Paul|title=Judaism and Ethical Monotheism|url=https://blog.uvm.edu/pfischer/2013/10/27/judaism-and-ethical-monotheism/|website=platophilosophy|publisher=The University of Vermont Blogs|accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is now a core tenet of most modern monotheistic religions, including Zoroastrianism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, and Bahá'í Faith.&lt;ref&gt;Nikiprowetzky, V. (1975). Ethical monotheism. (2 ed., Vol. 104, pp. 69-89). New York: The MIT Press Article Stable. {{jstor|20024331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jewish, Christian and Islamic tradition, monotheism was the original religion of humanity; this original religion is sometimes referred to as "the Adamic religion", or, in the terms of [[Andrew Lang]], the "[[Urreligion]]". Scholars of religion largely abandoned that view in the 19th century in favour of an [[development of religion|evolutionary progression]] from [[animism]] via [[polytheism]] to monotheism, but by 1974 this theory was less widely held, and a modified view similar to Lang's became more prominent.&lt;ref name="odccmono"/&gt;{{qn|date=January 2017}} Austrian anthropologist [[Wilhelm Schmidt (linguist)|Wilhelm Schmidt]] had postulated an ''[[Urmonotheismus]]'', "original" or "primitive monotheism" in the 1910s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=Karen|title=A History of God: The 4,000-Year Quest of Judaism, Christianity and Islam|date=1994|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York City, New York|isbn=978-0345384560|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was objected{{by whom|date=January 2017}} that [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]] had grown up in opposition to polytheism as had Greek philosophical monotheism.&lt;ref name="odccmono"/&gt; More recently, [[Karen Armstrong]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=Karen|title=A History of God: The 4,000-Year Quest of Judaism, Christianity and Islam|date=1994|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York City, New York|isbn=978-0345384560}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other authors have returned to the idea of an evolutionary progression beginning with [[animism]], which developed into [[polytheism]], which developed into [[henotheism]], which developed into [[monolatry]], which developed into true monotheism.&lt;ref&gt;

| quote                 = Evolutionary interpretations of the history of religion are usually understood to be an explanation of the phenomenon of religion as a result of a continuous development. The model for such development is the growth of living beings which leads to increasingly subtle differentiation and integration. Within such a framework of thought, monotheism would be interpreted as the result of a continuous development from animism, polytheism, henotheism and monolatry to belief in the one and only God. Such a development cannot be proved. Monotheism appeared suddenly, though not without being prepared for.

==Abrahamic religions==
{{Further|Abrahamic religions}}
While all adherents of the Abrahamic religions consider themselves to be monotheists, some in Judaism do not consider Christianity to be a pure form of monotheism (due to The Christian doctrine of the Trinity), classifying it as [[Shituf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mohammedamin.com/Community_issues/Triangulating-the-Abrahamic-faiths.html |title=Triangulating the Abrahamic faiths – measuring the closeness of Judaism, Christianity and Islam |author=Mohammed Amin |quote=Christians were seen as polytheists, due to the doctrine of the Trinity. In the last few hundred years, rabbis have moderated this view slightly, but they still do not regard Christians as being fully monotheistic in the same manner as Jews or Muslims. Muslims were acknowledged as monotheists.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Jacobs|editor1-first=Louis|title=The Jewish Religion: A Companion 1st Edition|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0198264637|pages=79-80|url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/jewish-views-on-christianity/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam likewise does not recognize modern-day Christianity as monotheistic, primarily due to the Christian doctrine of Trinity, which Islam argues was not a part of the original monotheistic Christianity as preached by Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ulc.org/training-education/guide-to-divinity/22-religions-of-the-world/134-practicing-islam/ |title=Islamic Practices |publisher=Universal Life Church Ministries |quote=It is the Islamic belief that Christianity is not monotheistic, as it claims, but rather polytheistic with the trinity-the father, son and the Holy Ghost.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Christians, on the other hand, argue that the doctrine of the Trinity is a valid expression of monotheism, citing that the Trinity does not consist of three separate [[deities]], but rather the three [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|persons]], who exist [[consubstantiality|consubstantially]] (as one [[Ousia|substance]]) within a single [[Godhead in Christianity|Godhead]].&lt;ref&gt;https://icucourses.com/pages/025-10-three-persons-are-subsistent-relations ; International Catholic University, The One True God: "The fatherhood constitutes the Person of the Father, the sonship constitutes the Person of the Son, and the passive spiration constitutes the Person of the Holy Spirit. But in God "everything is one where there is no distinction by relative opposition." Consequently, even though in God there are three Persons, there is only one consciousness, one thinking and one loving. The three Persons share equally in the internal divine activity because they are all identified with the divine essence. For, if each divine Person possessed his own distinct and different consciousness, there would be three gods, not the one God of Christian revelation. So you will see that in this regard there is an immense difference between a divine Person and a human person."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://orthodoxwiki.org/Holy_Trinity ; Holy Trinity, Orthodox Wiki: "Orthodox Christians worship the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—the Holy Trinity, the one God. Following the Holy Scriptures and the Church Fathers, the Church believes that the Trinity is three divine persons (hypostases) who share one essence (ousia). It is paradoxical to believe thus, but that is how God has revealed himself. All three persons are consubstantial with each other, that is, they are of one essence (homoousios) and coeternal. There never was a time when any of the persons of the Trinity did not exist. God is beyond and before time and yet acts within time, moving and speaking within history."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Trinity-Christianity ; Britannica, Trinity: "The Council of Nicaea in 325 stated the crucial formula for that doctrine in its confession that the Son is “of the same substance [homoousios] as the Father,” even though it said very little about the Holy Spirit. Over the next half century, Athanasius defended and refined the Nicene formula, and, by the end of the 4th century, under the leadership of Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nyssa, and Gregory of Nazianzus (the Cappadocian Fathers), the doctrine of the Trinity took substantially the form it has maintained ever since. It is accepted in all of the historic confessions of Christianity, even though the impact of the Enlightenment decreased its importance."&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of Deuteronomy the earliest passages to state that there are no gods but the Lord are in poems and prayers attributed to Hannah and David, one and a half to two and a half centuries after the Exodus at the earliest. Such statements do not become common until the seventh century B.C.E., the period to which Deuteronomy is dated by the critical view."&lt;/ref&gt; God in later Judaism was strictly monotheistic,&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]], [[13 Principles of Faith|13 principles of faith]], Second Principle&lt;/ref&gt; an absolute one, indivisible, and incomparable [[being]] who is the ultimate cause of all existence. The [[Babylonian Talmud]] references other, "foreign gods" as non-existent entities to whom humans mistakenly ascribe reality and power.&lt;ref&gt;e. g., Babylonian Talmud, Megilla 7b-17a.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the best-known statements of [[Rabbinical Judaism]] on monotheism is the Second of [[Maimonides]]' [[13 principles of faith|13 Principles of faith]]:

====In Ancient Israel====
{{see also|Yahweh|Elohim|Baal}}
During the 8th century BCE, the worship of [[Yahweh|YHWH]] in Israel was in competition with many other cults, described by the [[Yahwist]] faction collectively as [[Baal]]s. The oldest books of the [[Hebrew Bible]] reflect this competition, as in the books of [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]] and [[Book of Nahum|Nahum]], whose authors lament the "[[apostasy]]" of the people of Israel, threatening them with the wrath of God if they do not give up their polytheistic cults.&lt;ref&gt;1 Kings 18, Jeremiah 2; Othmar Keel, Christoph Uehlinger, Gods, Goddesses, and Images of God in Ancient Israel, Fortress Press (1998); Mark S.

YHWH was originally the [[national god]] of the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] and the [[Kingdom of Judah]].&lt;ref name="Israel Drazin"/&gt; As time progressed, the [[henotheistic]] cult of Yahweh grew increasingly militant in its opposition to the worship of other gods.&lt;ref name=Albertz/&gt; Later, the reforms of [[King Josiah]] imposed a form of strict [[Monolatrism#In ancient Israel|monolatrism]].

====The Shema====
{{Main article|Shema Yisrael}}
''Shema Yisrael'' ("Hear, [O] Israel") are the [[Incipit|first two words]] of a section of the [[Torah]], and is the title of a prayer that serves as a centerpiece of the morning and evening [[Jewish services|Jewish prayer services]]. The first verse encapsulates the monotheistic essence of Judaism: "Hear, O Israel: the [[YHVH|{{LORD}}]] our God, the {{LORD}} is one" ({{Lang-he-n|שְׁמַע יִשְׂרָאֵל ה' אֱלֹהֵינוּ ה' אֶחָד}}), found in {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|6:4|HE}}, sometimes alternatively translated as "The {{LORD}} is our God, the {{LORD}} alone". Observant Jews consider the Shema to be the most important part of the [[prayer]] service in Judaism, and its twice-daily recitation as a ''[[mitzvah]]'' (religious commandment). It is traditional for Jews to say the Shema as their [[last words]], and for parents to teach their children to say it before they go to sleep at night.

===Christianity===
{{Main article|God in Christianity|Trinity}}
[[File:Shield-Trinity-Scutum-Fidei-English.svg|thumb|right|The [[Trinity]] is the belief in Christianity that God is one God in essence but three persons: [[God the Father]], [[God the Son]] ([[Jesus]]), and [[God the Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref name="def-lateran"&gt;Definition of the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] quoted in ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P17.HTM#1FT §253].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Among [[early Christians]] there was considerable debate over the nature of the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]], with some denying the incarnation but not the deity of Jesus ([[Docetism]]) and others later calling for an [[Arianism|Arian]] conception of God. Despite at least one earlier local [[Council of Alexandria|synod]] rejecting the claim of Arius, this [[Christology|Christological]] issue was to be one of the items addressed at the [[First Council of Nicaea]].

The First Council of Nicaea, held in [[Nicaea]] (in present-day [[Turkey]]), convoked by the [[Roman Emperors|Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] in 325, was the first [[ecumenical council|ecumenical]]&lt;ref&gt;''Ecumenical'', from [[Koine Greek]] [[Oikoumene|oikoumenikos]], literally meaning worldwide the earliest extant uses of the term for a council are in Eusebius's ''Life of Constantine'' 3.6 [http://khazarzar.skeptik.net/books/eusebius/vc/gr/index.htm] around 338 "{{lang|grc|σύνοδον οἰκουμενικὴν συνεκρότει}}" (he convoked an Ecumenical council), Athanasius's Ad Afros Epistola Synodica in 369 [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2819.htm], and the Letter in 382 to [[Pope Damasus I]] and the Latin bishops from the [[First Council of Constantinople]][http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-14/Npnf2-14-63.htm#TopOfPage]&lt;/ref&gt; council of [[bishop]]s of the [[Roman Empire]], and most significantly resulted in the first uniform Christian [[doctrine]], called the [[Nicene Creed]]. With the creation of the creed, a precedent was established for subsequent general ecumenical councils of bishops ([[synod]]s) to create statements of belief and [[Canon law|canons]] of doctrinal [[orthodoxy]]— the intent being to define a common creed for the [[Christian Church|Church]] and address [[heresy|heretical]] ideas.

One purpose of the council was to resolve [[Arian controversy|disagreements]] in [[Early centers of Christianity#Alexandria|Alexandria]] over the nature of [[Jesus]] in relationship to the Father; in particular, whether Jesus was of the [[Homoousia|same substance]] as [[God the Father]] or merely of [[Homoiousia|similar substance]]. All but two bishops took the first position; while [[Arius]]' argument failed.

Christian orthodox traditions (Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and most Protestants) follow this decision, which was reaffirmed in 381 at the [[First Council of Constantinople]] and reached its full development through the work of the [[Cappadocian Fathers]]. They consider God to be a triune entity, called the Trinity, comprising three "[[person]]s", [[God the Father]], [[God the Son]], and [[God the Holy Spirit]]. These three are described as being "of the same substance" ({{lang|grc|[[ousia|ὁμοούσιος]]}}).

Christians overwhelmingly assert that monotheism is central to the Christian faith, as the Nicene Creed (and others), which gives the orthodox Christian definition of the Trinity, begins: "I believe in one God". From earlier than the times of the [[Nicene Creed]], 325&amp;nbsp;CE, various Christian figures advocated&lt;ref&gt;''Examples of ante-Nicene statements'':

&lt;/ref&gt; the triune [[Holy Mystery|mystery]]-nature of God as a normative profession of faith. According to [[Roger E. Olson]] and Christopher Hall, through prayer, meditation, study and practice, the Christian community concluded "that God must exist as both a unity and trinity", codifying this in ecumenical council at the end of the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Olson|first1=Roger E.|title=The Trinity|date=2002|publisher=Wm.

Most modern Christians believe the [[Godhead in Christianity|Godhead]] is triune, meaning that the three persons of the Trinity are in one union in which each person is also wholly God. They also hold to the doctrine of a [[Hypostatic union|man-god]] [[Christ Jesus]] as [[God incarnate#Christianity|God incarnate]]. These Christians also do not believe that one of the three divine figures is God alone and the other two are not but that all three are mysteriously God and one. Other Christian religions, including [[Unitarian Universalism]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Mormonism]] and others, do not share those views on the Trinity.

Some Christian faiths, such as [[God in Mormonism|Mormonism]], argue that the Godhead is in fact three separate individuals which include God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormon.org/beliefs/articles-of-faith|title=Articles of Faith|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each individual having a distinct purpose in the grand existence of human kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormon.org/beliefs/jesus-christ|title=Jesus Christ|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Mormons believe that before the Council of Nicaea, the predominant belief among many early Christians was that the Godhead was three separate individuals. In support of this view, they cite early Christian examples of belief in [[subordinationism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=1105&amp;index=3|title=Offenders for a Word|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Unitarianism]] is a theological movement, named for its understanding of God as one person, in direct contrast to Trinitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15154b.htm Unitarians]'' at 'Catholic Encyclopedia', ed. Kevin Knight at New Advent website&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Allah1.png|thumb|upright|Arabic calligraphy reading "Allah, may his glory be glorified"]]

In Islam, [[God in Islam|God]] ([[Allāh]]) is [[omnipotence|all-powerful]] and [[omniscience|all-knowing]], the creator, sustainer, ordainer and judge of the universe.&lt;ref name="EoQ-Quran"&gt;Gerhard Böwering, ''God and his Attributes'', [[Encyclopedia of the Quran]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="esp22"&gt;John L.

The Qur'an asserts the existence of a single and absolute truth that transcends the world; a unique and indivisible being who is independent of the creation.&lt;ref name="EncRel"&gt;Vincent J. Cornell, Encyclopedia of Religion, Vol 5, pp.3561-3562&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an rejects binary modes of thinking such as the idea of a [[Dualistic cosmology|duality]] of God by arguing that both [[Goodness and evil|good and evil]] generate from God's creative act. God is a universal god rather than a local, tribal or parochial one; an absolute who integrates all affirmative values and brooks no evil.&lt;ref name="Barlas96"&gt;Asma Barlas, Believing Women in Islam, p.96&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ash'ari]] theology, which dominated Sunni Islam from the tenth to the nineteenth century, insists on ultimate divine transcendence and holds that divine unity is not accessible to human reason. Ash'arism teaches that human knowledge regarding it is limited to what was has been revealed through the prophets, and on such paradoxes as God's creation of evil, revelation has to accepted ''bila kayfa'' (without [asking] how).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Tamara Sonn|title=Tawḥīd|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|editor=John L.

''Tawhid'' constitutes the foremost article of the Muslim [[Shahada|profession of faith]], "There is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God.&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;D. Gimaret, ''Tawhid'', [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]&lt;/ref&gt; To attribute divinity to a created entity is the only unpardonable sin mentioned in the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref name="Barlas96"/&gt; The entirety of the Islamic teaching rests on the principle of ''tawhid''.&lt;ref&gt;Ramadan (2005), p.230&lt;/ref&gt;

As they traditionally profess a concept of monotheism with a singular [[God the father|person]] as God, Judaism&lt;ref name="RebShmuleyKosherJoshkel"/&gt; and Islam reject the Christian idea of monotheism. Judaism uses the term [[Shituf]] to refer to non-monotheistic ways of worshiping God. Though Muslims venerate Jesus ([[Jesus in Islam|Isa]] in Arabic) as a prophet, they do not accept the doctrine that he was a begotten son of God.

===Sabianism===
{{Main article|Sabians}}
According to the Quran, the Sabians were a monotheistic religious group.&lt;ref&gt;"the Jews, the Sabians, and the Christians." Bernard Lewis, The Jews of Islam, 1987, page 13&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Hadith]]s account them as converts to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Sahih Bukhari Book #7 Hadith #340, Book #59 Hadith #628, and Book #89 Hadith #299 etc.&lt;/ref&gt; However this interpretation may be related to the fact that [[Quraysh]] polytheists used to describe anyone who converted to Islam with the word "Saba"{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} ({{lang|ar|صبى/صبوت}}) which may either mean that this term was used for anyone who changed his religion or that they identified the message of Muhammed as a "Sabian belief". The former linguistic explanation (i.e. ''saba'' = ''changed his religion'') is the one adopted by most Muslim scholars.

Sabians are often identified with [[Mandaeism]], a small monotheistic community which lives today in [[Iraq]] and call themselves ''Yahyawiya'' ({{lang-ar|يحياوية}}). Muslim scholars traditionally viewed them as followers of the prophets [[Noah]] and ''Yahya'' (i.e. [[John the Baptist]]).&lt;ref name="Khalil ‘ibn Ahmad"&gt;Khalil ‘ibn Ahmad (d. 786–787), who was in Basra before his death, wrote: "The Sabians believe they belong to the prophet Noah, they read ''[[Zaboor]]'' (see also [[Book of Psalms]]), and their religion looks like Christianity." He also states that "they worship the angels."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Atenism==
{{Main article|Atenism}}
[[File:La salle dAkhenaton (1356-1340 av J.C.) (Musée du Caire) (2076972086).jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] and his family adoring the Aten.]]

[[Amenhotep IV]] initially introduced [[Atenism]] in Year 5 of his reign (1348/1346 BCE) during the [[18th dynasty]] of the [[New Kingdom]]. He raised [[Aten]], once a relatively obscure Egyptian [[Solar deity]] representing the disk of the sun, to the status of Supreme God in the Egyptian pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalie David, op. cit., p.125&lt;/ref&gt; To emphasise the change, Aten's name was written in the [[cartouche]] form normally reserved for Pharaohs, an innovation of Atenism. This religious reformation appears to coincide with the proclamation of a [[Sed festival]], a sort of royal jubilee intended to reinforce the Pharaoh's divine powers of kingship. Traditionally held in the thirtieth year of the Pharaoh's reign, this possibly was a festival in honour of [[Amenhotep III]], who some Egyptologists think had a [[coregency]] with his son Amenhotep IV of two to twelve years.

Year 5 is believed to mark the beginning of Amenhotep IV's construction of a new capital, [[Akhetaten]] (''Horizon of the Aten''), at the site known today as [[Amarna]]. Evidence of this appears on three of the boundary [[stele|stelae]] used to mark the boundaries of this new capital. At this time, Amenhotep IV officially changed his name to Akhenaten (''Agreeable to Aten'') as evidence of his new worship. The date given for the event has been estimated to fall around January 2 of that year. In Year 7 of his reign (1346/1344 BCE), the capital was moved from [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] to Akhetaten (near modern Amarna), though construction of the city seems to have continued for two more years. In shifting his court from the traditional ceremonial centres Akhenaten was signalling a dramatic transformation in the focus of religious and political power.

The move separated the Pharaoh and his court from the influence of the priesthood and from the traditional centres of worship, but his decree had deeper religious significance too—taken in conjunction with his name change, it is possible that the move to Amarna was also meant as a signal of Akhenaten's symbolic death and rebirth. It may also have coincided with the death of his father and the end of the coregency. In addition to constructing a new capital in honor of Aten, Akhenaten also oversaw the construction of some of the most massive [[Egyptian temple|temple]] complexes in ancient Egypt, including one at [[Karnak]] and one at Thebes, close to the old temple of [[Amun]].

In Year 9 (1344/1342 BCE), Akhenaten declared a more radical version of his new religion, declaring Aten not merely the supreme god of the Egyptian pantheon, but the only God of Egypt, with himself as the sole intermediary between the Aten and the Egyptian people. Key features of Atenism included a ban on idols and other images of the Aten, with the exception of a rayed solar disc, in which the rays (commonly depicted ending in hands) appear to represent the unseen spirit of Aten. Aten was addressed by Akhenaten in prayers, such as the ''[[Great Hymn to the Aten]]'': "O Sole God beside whom there is none".

The details of Atenist theology are still unclear. The exclusion of all but one god and the prohibition of idols was a radical departure from Egyptian tradition, but most scholars see Akhenaten as a practitioner of [[monolatrism|monolatry]] rather than monotheism, as he did not actively deny the existence of other gods; he simply refrained from worshiping any but Aten. It is known that Atenism did not solely attribute divinity to the Aten. Akhenaten continued the [[imperial cult#Ancient Egypt|cult]] of the Pharaoh, proclaiming himself the [[Son of God|son of Aten]] and encouraging the Egyptian people to worship him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientegyptonline.co.uk/amarnareligion.html|title=Ancient Egypt Gods: The Aten|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian people were to worship Akhenaten; only Akhenaten and Nefertiti could worship Aten directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hart|first=George|title=The Routledge dictionary of Egyptian gods and goddesses|year=2005|edition=2nd|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-34495-1|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Akhenaten's successors, Egypt reverted to its traditional religion, and Akhenaten himself came to be reviled as a heretic.

==Chinese view==
{{Main article|Shangdi|Tian|Mohism}}
[[File:天-bronze-shang.svg|thumb|upright|[[Shang Dynasty]] [[bronze script]] character for ''tian'' (天), which translates to Heaven and sky.]]
The orthodox faith system held by most dynasties of [[China]] since at least the [[Shang Dynasty]] (1766&amp;nbsp;BCE) until the modern period centered on the worship of ''[[Shangdi]]'' (literally "Above Sovereign", generally translated as "God") or [[Tian|Heaven]] as an omnipotent force.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Homer H. Dubs, "Theism and Naturalism in Ancient Chinese Philosophy," ''Philosophy of East and West'', Vol. 9, No. 3/4, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; This faith system pre-dated the development of [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]] and the introduction of [[Buddhism]] and [[Christianity]]. It has features of monotheism in that Heaven is seen as an omnipotent entity, a [[Incorporeality|noncorporeal]] force with a [[personal god|personality]] [[transcendent reality|transcending]] the world. From the writings of [[Confucius]] in the ''[[Analects]]'', it is known Confucius believed that Heaven cannot be deceived, Heaven guides people's lives and maintains a personal relationship with them, and that Heaven gives tasks for people to fulfill in order to teach them of virtues and morality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, this faith system was not truly monotheistic since other lesser gods and spirits, which varied with locality, were also worshiped along with ''Shangdi''. Still, later variants such as [[Mohism]] (470 BCE–c.391 BCE) approached true monotheism, teaching that the function of lesser gods and ancestral spirits is merely to carry out the will of ''Shangdi'', akin to the angels in Abrahamic religions which in turn counts as only one god. In [[Mozi]]'s ''Will of Heaven'' (天志), he writes:

{{quote box |width=60em |align=center
|quote="I know Heaven loves men dearly not without reason. Heaven ordered the sun, the moon, and the stars to enlighten and guide them. Heaven ordained the four seasons, Spring, Autumn, Winter, and Summer, to regulate them. Heaven sent down snow, frost, rain, and dew to grow the five grains and flax and silk that so the people could use and enjoy them. Heaven established the hills and rivers, ravines and valleys, and arranged many things to minister to man's good or bring him evil. He appointed the dukes and lords to reward the virtuous and punish the wicked, and to gather metal and wood, birds and beasts, and to engage in cultivating the five grains and flax and silk to provide for the people's food and clothing. This has been so from antiquity to the present."

且吾所以知天之愛民之厚者有矣，曰以磨為日月星辰，以昭道之；制為四時春秋冬夏，以紀綱之；雷降雪霜雨露，以長遂五穀麻絲，使民得而財利之；列為山川谿谷，播賦百事，以臨司民之善否；為王公侯伯，使之賞賢而罰暴；賊金木鳥獸，從事乎五穀麻絲，以為民衣食之財。自古及今，未嘗不有此也。
|source=''Will of Heaven'', Chapter 27, Paragraph 6, ca. 5th century BCE
}}

Worship of ''Shangdi'' and Heaven in ancient China includes the erection of shrines, the last and greatest being the [[Temple of Heaven]] in Beijing, and the offering of prayers. The ruler of China in every Chinese dynasty would perform annual sacrificial rituals to ''Shangdi'', usually by slaughtering a completely healthy bull as sacrifice. Although its popularity gradually diminished after the advent of Taoism and Buddhism, among other religions, its concepts remained in use throughout the pre-modern period and have been incorporated in later religions in China, including terminology used by early Christians in China. Despite the rising of non-theistic and pantheistic spirituality contributed by Taoism and Buddhism, Shangdi was still praised up until the end of the [[Qing Dynasty]] as the last ruler of the Qing declared himself [[son of heaven]].

The supreme god of the [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] was the god [[Dyeus|*''Dyḗus Pḥ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;tḗr '']]. A number of words derived from the name of this supreme deity are used in various [[Indo-European languages]] to denote a monotheistic God.

In western Eurasia, the ancient traditions of the Slavic religion contained elements of monotheism. In the sixth century AD, the Byzantine chronicler [[Procopius]] recorded that the Slavs "acknowledge that one god, creator of lightning, is the only lord of all: to him do they sacrifice an ox and all sacrificial animals."&lt;ref name=katicic2008&gt;{{cite book |last=Katičić |first=Radoslav |title=Božanski boj: Tragovima svetih pjesama naše pretkršćanske starine |year=2008 |publisher=IBIS GRAFIKA |location=Zagreb |isbn=978-953-6927-41-8 |url=http://ir.nmu.org.ua/bitstream/handle/123456789/120570/96db5654f2d3025b46454ace91716506.pdf |ref=Katičić 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018000746/http://ir.nmu.org.ua/bitstream/handle/123456789/120570/96db5654f2d3025b46454ace91716506.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The deity to whom Procopius is referring is the storm god [[Perún]], whose name is derived from [[Perkwunos|*''Perk&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;unos'']], the Proto-Indo-European god of lightning.

Hindu views are broad and range from monism, through pantheism and panentheism (alternatively called monistic theism by some scholars) to monotheism and even atheism. Hinduism cannot be said to be purely polytheistic. Hindu religious leaders have repeatedly stressed that while God's forms are many and the ways to communicate with him are many, God is one. The ''[[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]'' of the ''[[murti]]'' is a way to communicate with the abstract one god (''[[Brahman]]'') which creates, sustains and dissolves creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islam101.com/religions/hinduism/conceptOfGod.htm |title=Concept Of God In Hinduism By Dr Naik |publisher=Islam101.com |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[Aishvarya]]'' (sovereignty, derived from the word [[Ishvara]]), which consists in unchallenged rule over all
* ''Shakti'' (energy), or power, which is the capacity to make the impossible possible
* ''Bala'' (strength), which is the capacity to support everything by will and without any fatigue
* ''Vīrya'' (vigor), which indicates the power to retain immateriality as the supreme being in spite of being the material cause of mutable creations

In the [[Shaivite]] tradition, the ''[[Shri Rudram]]'' ([[Sanskrit]] श्रि रुद्रम्), to which the Chamakam (चमकम्) is added by scriptural tradition, is a Hindu ''[[stotra]]'' dedicated to [[Rudra]] (an epithet of [[Shiva]]), taken from the [[Yajurveda]] (TS 4.5, 4.7).&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of the Śatarudriya see: Kramrisch, pp. 71-74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a full translation of the complete hymn see: Sivaramamurti (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; Shri Rudram is also known as ''Sri Rudraprasna'', ''{{IAST|Śatarudrīya}}'', and ''Rudradhyaya''. The text is important in [[Vedanta]] where [[Shiva]] is equated to the Universal supreme God. The hymn is an early example of enumerating the [[Names of God|names of a deity]],&lt;ref&gt;For the {{IAST|Śatarudrīya}} as an early example of enumeration of divine names, see: Flood (1996), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; a tradition developed extensively in the [[sahasranama]] literature of [[Hinduism]].

The [[Nyaya]] school of Hinduism has made several arguments regarding a monotheistic view. The Naiyanikas have given an argument that such a god can only be one. In the ''Nyaya Kusumanjali'', this is discussed against the proposition of the ''[[Mimamsa]]'' school that let us assume there were many demigods (''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s'') and sages (''[[rishi]]s'') in the beginning, who wrote the Vedas and created the world. Nyaya says that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[If they assume such] omniscient beings, those endowed with the various superhuman faculties of assuming infinitesimal size, and so on, and capable of creating everything, then we reply that the ''law of parsimony'' bids us assume only one such, namely Him, the adorable Lord. There can be no confidence in a non-eternal and non-omniscient being, and hence it follows that according to the system which rejects God, the tradition of the Veda is simultaneously overthrown; there is no other way open.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, Nyaya says that the polytheist would have to give elaborate proofs for the existence and origin of his several celestial spirits, none of which would be logical, and that it is more logical to assume one eternal, omniscient god.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yP-fIislexUC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=In+other+words,+Nyaya+says+that+the+polytheist+would+have+to+give+elaborate+proofs+for+the+existence+and+origin+of+his+several+celestial+spirits,+none+of+which+would+be+logical,+and+that+it+is+more+logical+to+assume+one+eternal,+omniscient+god.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XcvJAwws4J&amp;sig=mJlpVrEaVtXqdq6u0n6kt6vzuNQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiEsZ7mt_zSAhVP5mMKHc5PBc4Q6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20other%20words,%20Nyaya%20says%20that%20the%20polytheist%20would%20have%20to%20give%20elaborate%20proofs%20for%20the%20existence%20and%20origin%20of%20his%20several%20celestial%20spirits,%20none%20of%20which%20would%20be%20logical,%20and%20that%20it%20is%20more%20logical%20to%20assume%20one%20eternal,%20omniscient%20god.&amp;f=false|title=The Arian Christian Doctrines: The Origins of Christianity|last=Studies|first=Institute for Metaphysical|last2=Inc|first2=The Institute for Metaphysi Studies|last3=MM|first3=MR Charles D.

Sikhism is a monotheistic faith&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/sikhism/beliefs.htm |title=Sikh Beliefs and Doctrine |publisher=ReligionFacts |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.multifaithcentre.org/sikhism/71-a-short-introduction-to-sikhism- |archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20091221113705/http://www.multifaithcentre.org/sikhism/71-a-short-introduction-to-sikhism- |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-12-21 |title=A Short Introduction to Sikhism |publisher=Multifaithcentre.org |accessdate=2012-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that arose in northern [[India]] during the 16th and 17th centuries. [[Sikh]]s believe in one, timeless, omnipresent, supreme creator. The opening verse of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], known as the [[Mul Mantra]], signifies this:

:{{lang-pa|ੴ ਸਤਿ ਨਾਮੁ ਕਰਤਾ ਪੁਰਖੁ ਨਿਰਭਉ ਨਿਰਵੈਰੁ ਅਕਾਲ ਮੂਰਤਿ ਅਜੂਨੀ ਸੈਭੰ ਗੁਰ ਪ੍ਰਸਾਦਿ ॥}}
:[[Transliteration]]: ikk ōankār sat(i)-nām(u) karatā purakh(u) nirabha'u niravair(u) akāla mūrat(i) ajūnī saibhan&lt;small&gt;(g)&lt;/small&gt; gur(a) prasād(i).
:One Universal creator God, The supreme Unchangeable Truth, The Creator of the Universe, Beyond Fear, Beyond Hatred, Beyond Death, Beyond Birth, Self-Existent, by Guru's Grace.

The word "ੴ" ("Ik ōaṅkār") has two components. The first is ੧, the digit "1" in [[Gurmukhi]] signifying the singularity of the creator. Together the word means: "One Universal creator God".

It is often said that the 1430 pages of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] are all expansions on the Mul Mantra. Although the Sikhs have many names for God, some derived from [[Islam]] and [[Hinduism]], they all refer to the same Supreme Being.

The Sikh holy scriptures refer to the One God who pervades the whole of space and is the creator of all beings in the [[universe]]. The following quotation from the Guru Granth Sahib highlights this point:
{{quote|
"Chant, and meditate on the One God, who permeates and pervades the many beings of the whole Universe. God created it, and God spreads through it everywhere. Everywhere I look, I see God. The Perfect Lord is perfectly pervading and permeating the water, the land and the sky; there is no place without Him."|Guru Granth Sahib, Page 782}}

However, there is a strong case for arguing that the Guru Granth Sahib teaches [[monism]] due to its non-dualistic tendencies:
{{quote|
{{lang-pa|ਸਹਸ ਪਦ ਬਿਮਲ ਨਨ ਏਕ ਪਦ ਗੰਧ ਬਿਨੁ ਸਹਸ ਤਵ ਗੰਧ ਇਵ ਚਲਤ ਮੋਹੀ ॥੨॥}}&lt;br&gt;
"You have thousands of Lotus Feet, and yet You do not have even one foot. You have no nose, but you have thousands of noses. This Play of Yours entrances me." |[[Guru Granth Sahib]], Page 13}}

Sikhs believe that God has been given many names, but they all refer to the One [[God]], [[VāhiGurū]]. Sikhs believe that members of other religions such as Islam, Hinduism and [[Christianity]] all worship the same God, and the names [[Allah]], [[Ar-Rahim|Rahim]], [[Al-Karim|Karim]], [[Hari]], [[Rama|Raam]] and [[Brahman|Paarbrahm]] are frequently mentioned in the Sikh holy scriptures. Although there is no set reference to God in Sikhism, the most commonly used Sikh reference to God is [[Akal Purakh]] (which means "the true immortal") or [[Waheguru]], the Primal Being.

====Zoroastrianism====
{{Main article|Zoroastrianism}}
[[File:Faravahar-Gold.svg|thumb|right|[[Faravahar]] (or Ferohar), one of the primary symbols of Zoroastrianism, believed to be the depiction of a Fravashi (guardian spirit)]]
Zoroastrianism combines [[Cosmology|cosmogonic]] dualism and [[Eschatology|eschatological]] monotheism which makes it unique among the religions of the world. Zoroastrianism proclaims an evolution through time from [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] to monotheism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Buddhism in China: A Historical Sketch | journal = The Journal of Religion| id = | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoroastrianism is a monotheistic religion,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Boyce|first=Mary|title=Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=2007|pages=19–20|isbn=978-0-415-23903-5|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Zoroastrianism is often regarded&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05528b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia - Eschatology] "The radical defect of the Persian religion was its dualistic conception of deity."&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]], duotheistic or bitheistic, for its belief in the [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostatis]] of the ultimately good [[Ahura Mazda]] ''(creative spirit)'' and the ultimately evil [[Angra Mainyu]] ''(destructive spirit)''. Zorastrianism was once one of the largest religions on Earth, as the official religion of the [[Persian Empire]]. By some scholars,{{who|date=January 2012}} the Zoroastrians ("Parsis" or "Zartoshtis") are credited with being some of the first monotheists and having had influence on other world religions. Gathered statistics shows the number of adherents at as many as 3.5 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html#Zoroastrianism |title=Major Religions Ranked by Size |publisher=Adherents.com |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; with adherents living in many regions, including South Asia.

===Ancient Greek religion===
{{main|Ancient Greek religion}}

====Classical Greece====
[[File:Xenophanes in Thomas Stanley History of Philosophy.jpg|thumb|right|Fictionalized portrait of [[Xenophanes]] from a 17th-century engraving]]

The surviving fragments of the poems of the classical Greek philosopher [[Xenophanes of Colophon]] suggest that he held views very similar to those of modern monotheists.&lt;ref&gt;McKirahan, Richard D. "Xenophanes of Colophon. ''Philosophy Before Socrates''. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 1994. 61. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; His poems harshly criticize the traditional notion of anthropomorphic gods, commenting that "...if cattle and horses and lions had hands or could paint with their hands and create works such as men do,... [they] also would depict the gods' shapes and make their bodies of such a sort as the form they themselves have."&lt;ref&gt;Diels-Kranz, ''Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker'', Xenophanes frr. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Xenophanes declares that there is "...one god, greatest among gods and humans, like mortals neither in form nor in thought."&lt;ref name="osborne62"&gt;Osborne, Catherine. "Chapter 4." ''Presocratic Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford UP. 62. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophanes's theology appears to have been monist, but not truly monotheistic in the strictest sense.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Although some later philosophers, such as [[Antisthenes]], believed in doctrines similar to those expounded by Xenophanes, his ideas do not appear to have become widely popular.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

In [[Plato]]'s writings, he often presents [[Socrates]] as speaking of "the God" in the singular form. He does, however, often speak of the gods in the plural form as well. The [[Euthyphro dilemma]], for example, is formulated as "Is that which is holy loved by the gods because it is holy, or is it holy because it is loved by the gods?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lamb|first1=W. R. M.|title=Euthyphro|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DEuthyph.%3Asection%3D10a|website=Perseus|publisher=Tufts University|accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hellenistic Religion====
{{main|Hellenistic religion}}
The development of pure (philosophical) monotheism is a product of the [[Late Antiquity]]. During the 2nd to 3rd centuries, [[origins of Christianity|early Christianity]] was just one of several competing religious movements advocating monotheism.

"[[Henology|The One]]" (Τὸ Ἕν) is a concept that is prominent in the writings of the [[Neoplatonists]], especially those of the philosopher [[Plotinus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wyller|first1=Egil A.|title=Henologische Perspektiven II: zu Ehren Egil A.

[[File:Columns of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, Greece.jpeg|thumb|Remains of the [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo]] at Delphi, Greece.]]

A number of oracles of [[Apollo]] from [[Didyma]] and [[Clarus]], the so-called "theological oracles", dated to the 2nd and 3rd century CE, proclaim that there is only one highest god, of whom the gods of polytheistic religions are mere manifestations or servants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible]], s.v. "Apollo".&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] concept of the "Uncaused Cause"—never incorporated into the polytheistic ancient Greek religion—has been used by many exponents of Abrahamic religions to articulate their arguments for the existence of the Judeo-Christian-Islamic version of God.

The [[Hypsistarian]]s were a religious group who believed in a most high god, according to Greek documents. Later revisions of this Hellenic religion were adjusted towards Monotheism as it gained consideration among a wider populace. The worship of Zeus as the head-god signaled a trend in the direction of monotheism, with less honour paid to the fragmented powers of the lesser gods.

==New religious movements==
{{Expand section|date=July 2012}}
Various [[New religious movements]], such as [[Cao Dai|Cao Đài]], [[Tenrikyo]], [[Seicho no Ie]], and [[Cheondoism]], are monotheistic.

==Tengrism==
{{See also|Tengrism}}
Tengrism or Tangrism (sometimes stylized as Tengriism), occasionally referred to as Tengrianism &lt;!-- Do not put non-English translations on the English Wikipedia page --&gt;, is a modern term&lt;ref&gt;
The spelling ''Tengrism'' is found in the 1960s, e.g. Bergounioux (ed.), ''Primitive and prehistoric religions'', Volume 140, Hawthorn Books, 1966, p. 80.
''Tengrianism'' is a reflection of the Russian term, {{lang|ru|Тенгрианство}}. It is reported in 1996 ("so-called Tengrianism") in Shnirelʹman (ed.), ''Who gets the past?: competition for ancestors among non-Russian intellectuals in Russia'', Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-8018-5221-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4iwHp8asmsdEC&amp;pg=PA31 p. 31] in the context of the nationalist rivalry over [[Bulgars#Legacy|Bulgar legacy]]. The spellings ''Tengriism'' and ''Tengrianity'' are later, reported (deprecatingly, in scare quotes) in 2004 in ''Central Asiatic journal'', vol. 48-49 (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GeRVAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Tengriism&amp;dq=Tengriism p. 238].
The Turkish term {{lang|tr|Tengricilik}} is also found from the 1990s. Mongolian {{lang|mn|Тэнгэр шүтлэг}} is used in a 1999 biography of [[Genghis Khan]] (Boldbaatar et. al, {{lang|mn|Чингис хаан, 1162-1227}}, {{lang|mn| Хаадын сан}}, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OMIMAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22%D0%A2%D1%8D%D0%BD%D0%B3%D1%8D%D1%80+%D1%88%D2%AF%D1%82%D0%BB%D1%8D%D0%B3%22&amp;dq=%22%D0%A2%D1%8D%D0%BD%D0%B3%D1%8D%D1%80+%D1%88%D2%AF%D1%82%D0%BB%D1%8D%D0%B3%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HVBLT4yGBImhOtPRtf8N&amp;redir_esc=y p. 18]).&lt;/ref&gt; for a [[Central Asia]]n [[Central Asia#Religions|religion]] characterized by features of [[shamanism]], [[animism]], [[totemism]], both [[polytheism]] and monotheism,&lt;ref&gt;R.

In ''[[Irk Bitig]]'', Tengri is mentioned as ''Türük Tängrisi'' (God of Turks).&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Roux, Die alttürkische Mythologie, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; The term is perceived among [[Turkic peoples]] as a ''national'' religion.

In [[Sino-Tibetan peoples|Sino-Tibetan]] and [[Altaic mythologies|Turco-Mongol]] traditions, the Supreme God is commonly referred to as the ruler of Heaven, or the Sky Lord granted with omnipotent powers, but it has largely diminished in those regions due to [[ancestor worship]], [[Taoism]]'s [[pantheistic]] views and Buddhism's rejection of a creator God, although Mahayana Buddhism does seem to keep a sense of divinity. On some occasions in the mythology, the Sky Lord as identified as a male has been associated to mate with an Earth Mother, while some traditions kept the omnipotence of the Sky Lord unshared.

==Native American religion==
Native American theology may be monotheistic, polytheistic, henotheistic, animistic, or some combination thereof.

Cherokee for example are monotheist as well as pantheist.

The [[Great Spirit]], called ''[[Wakan Tanka]]'' among the [[Sioux]],&lt;ref name=Ostler&gt;Ostler, Jeffry. The Plains Sioux and U.S. Colonialism from Lewis and Clark to Wounded Knee. Cambridge University Press, Jul 5, 2004. {{ISBN|0521605903}}, pg 26.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Gitche Manitou]]'' in [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]], is a conception of universal spiritual force, or [[God|supreme being]] prevalent among some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[First Nations|First Nation]] cultures.&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;Thomas, Robert Murray. Manitou and God: North-American Indian Religions and Christian Culture. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007. {{ISBN|0313347794}} pg 35.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Lakota people|Lakota]] activist [[Russell Means]] a better translation of ''Wakan Tanka'' is the Great Mystery.&lt;ref name=Means&gt;Means, Robert. Where White Men Fear to Tread: The Autobiography of Russell Means. Macmillan, 1995. {{ISBN|0312147619}} pg 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have interpreted [[Aztec philosophy]] as fundamentally monotheistic or panentheistic. While the populace at large believed in a polytheistic pantheon, Aztec priests and nobles might have come to an interpretation of [[Teotl]] as a single universal force with many facets.&lt;ref name="iepMaffie"&gt;{{cite web|author=James Maffie|title=Aztec Philosophy|work= [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|date= 2005|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/aztec.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been criticism to this idea, however, most notably that many assertions of this supposed monotheism might actually come from post-Conquistador bias, imposing an Antiquity pagan model unto the Aztec.&lt;ref&gt;James Maffie, Aztec Philosophy: Understanding a World in Motion, University Press of Colorado, 15/03/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

''Journal of medical ethics, 41''(4), 348-352. doi:10.1136/medethics-2013-101796&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the debate over MBE has focused on their 2012 book supporting it, ''Unfit for the Future? The Need for Moral Enhancement.''&lt;ref name = "Persson et al 2012a" /&gt;

==Defining moral enhancement==

Moral enhancement in general is sometimes distinguished from MBE specifically, such that ME includes any means of moral improvement while MBE only involves biomedical interventions.&lt;ref name = "Raus et al 2014"&gt;Raus, K., Focquaert, F., Schermer, M., Specker, J., &amp; Sterckx, S. (2014). [http://doi.org/10.1007/s12152-014-9205-4 On defining moral enhancement: a clarificatory taxonomy]. ''Neuroethics, 7''(3), 263-273. doi:10.1007/s12152-014-9205-4&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Persson and Savulescu have cited [[moral education]] as an example of socially accepted non-biomedical moral enhancement.&lt;ref name = "Persson et al 2012b" /&gt;

Some also distinguish invasive from non-invasive, intended from resultant, treatment-focused from enhancement-focused, capability-improving from behavior-improving, and passive from active ME interventions.&lt;ref name = "Raus et al 2014" /&gt; [[Vojin Rakić]] has distinguished voluntary from compulsory MBE, claiming that the former is justifiable even if the latter is not.&lt;ref name = "Rakic 2014a"&gt;Rakić, V. (2014a). [http://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2012-100700 Voluntary moral enhancement and the survival-at-any-cost bias]. ''Journal of medical ethics, 40''(4), 246-250. doi:10.1136/medethics-2012-100700&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rakić, V. (2014b). [http://doi.org/10.1080/15265161.2014.889249 Voluntary moral bioenhancement is a solution to Sparrow's concerns]. ''The American journal of bioethics, 14''(4), 37-38. doi:10.1080/15265161.2014.889249&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments in favor==

Douglas originally suggested MBE as a counter-example to what he called the "[[bioconservative]] thesis," which claims that [[human enhancement]] is immoral even if it is feasible. He argued that enhancements to reduce "counter-moral" racist and aggressive emotional reactions would at least be morally permissible.&lt;ref name = "Douglas 2008" /&gt;

[[Mark Alan Walker]] proposed a "Genetic Virtue Project" to genetically enhance moral traits. Given that personality traits are heritable, and some traits are moral while others are immoral, he suggested increasing moral traits while reducing immoral ones through [[genetic engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;Walker, M. (2009, September). [http://doi.org/10.2990/28_2_27 Enhancing genetic virtue: A project for twenty-first century humanity?]. ''Politics and the life sciences, 28''(2), 27-47. doi:10.2990/28_2_27&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the fact that human technological progress has advanced faster than human moral psychology can adapt through evolution, Persson &amp; Savulescu point out that humans' capability to cause large-scale destruction has increased exponentially. However, given that humans tend to care only about their immediate acquaintances and circumstances instead of thinking on a larger scale, they are vulnerable to [[Tragedy of the commons|tragedies of the commons]] like climate change and to technologies like nuclear weapons which pose an [[existential threat]] to humanity. Given that moral education and [[liberal democracy]] are insufficient, MBE is needed at least as a supplementary method to solve these problems.&lt;ref name = "Persson et al 2012a" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Persson et al 2012b" /&gt;

==Criticism==

Central issues debated in the MBE literature include whether there is an urgent need for MBE, a sufficient consensus on the definition of morality, some technically feasible and ethically permissible interventions to carry out MBE, no violation of consent in those interventions, and no harmful social side-effects that they produce.&lt;ref name = "Specker et al 2014" /&gt;

===Sufficiency of non-biomedical methods===

Terri Murray disputed the claim by Persson &amp; Savulescu that political will and moral education are insufficient to address the major problems facing humanity, claiming that Persson &amp; Savulescu unjustly reify moral dispositions in biology.&lt;ref name = "Murray 2012"&gt;Murray, T. (2012). [https://philosophynow.org/issues/93/The_Incoherence_of_Moral_Bioenhancement The incoherence of moral bioenhancement]. ''Philosophy now, 93'', 19-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical basis of moral enhancement===

Since the nature of morality has historically caused wide disagreements, several authors have questioned whether it is possible to come up with a sufficiently widely accepted ethical basis for MBE, especially with respect to what qualities should be enhanced.&lt;ref name = "Paulo et al 2017" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beck, B. (2015). [http://doi.org/10.1111/bioe.12090 Conceptual and practical problems of moral enhancement]. ''Bioethics, 29''(4), 233-240. doi:10.1111/bioe.12090&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feasibility===

MBE proponents have been accused of being too speculative, overstating the capabilities of future interventions and describing unrealistic scenarios like enhancing "all of humanity."&lt;ref name = "Specker et al 2014" /&gt; One literature review assessed the evidence on seven interventions cited by MBE proponents, finding all of them ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Dubljević, V., &amp; Racine, E. (2017, May 15). [http://doi.org/10.1111/bioe.12355 Moral enhancement meets normative and empirical reality: Assessing the practical feasibility of moral enhancement neurotechnologies]. ''Bioethics, 31''(5), 338-348. doi:10.1111/bioe.12355&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of individual choice===

Other authors have suggested that unless MBE is based on an individual's choice, it cannot truly be called "moral" enhancement because personal choice is the basis of ethics.&lt;ref name = "Rakic 2014a" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Murray 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melo‐Martin, I., &amp; Salles, A. (2015). [http://doi.org/10.1111/bioe.12100 Moral bioenhancement: much ado about nothing?]. ''Bioethics, 29''(4), 223-232. doi:10.1111/bioe.12100&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social equality===

If MBE is more effective for enhancing people that are already moral, then it could increase the gap between moral and immoral people, increasing social inequality.&lt;ref&gt;Ram-Tiktin, E. (2014). [http://doi.org/10.1080/15265161.2014.889246 The possible effects of moral bioenhancement on political privileges and fair equality of opportunity]. ''The American journal of bioethics, 14''(4), 43-44. doi:10.1080/15265161.2014.889246&lt;/ref&gt; Also, if MBE makes some people morally better, it could unfairly raise the moral standards for everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, A. (2016). [http://doi.org/10.1111/bioe.12251 Moral enhancement and those left behind]. ''Bioethics, 30''(7), 500-510. doi:10.1111/bioe.12251&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3586">In [[botany]], an '''obconic''' is an inverted cone shape. The term is most frequently applied to certain fruit or [[hypanthium]] structures with the apical end attached to the stem; however, less frequently the usage may apply to the [[pistil]] structure. In the case of [[fungi]] the designation is often made to the [[ascospore]]. The use of ''obconic'' in botany dates to at least as early as the nineteenth century; however, some modern usage applies to an entire plant form, such as the shape of a whole shrub.&lt;ref&gt;Annette J.G. Wilson, Alexander S. George, Anthony E. Orchard (2001) ''Flora of Australia'', Published by ABRS/CSIRO  {{ISBN|0-643-06720-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, in geometry or design, the term can be assigned in an abstract manner to shapes in the natural or man-made world which show an inverted cone design.

==Botanical examples==
The [[carnivorous plant]] ''[[Nepenthes deaniana]]'' has pitcher elements that are obconic in shape to capture insects.&lt;ref&gt;M.R. Cheek and M.H.P. Jebb (1999) ''Nepenthes'' (Nepenthaceae) in Palawan, Philippines. ''Kew Bulletin'' '''54'''(4): 887–895. {{DOI|10.2307/4111166}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hypanthium]] of the western USA plant ''[[Heuchera rubescens]]'' has one [[subspecies]] with an obconic structure, while several other subspecies have alternative hypantium geometries, so that the obconic characteristic is a subspecies determinant and diagnostic.&lt;ref&gt;Willis Linn Jepson and James C. Hickman (1993) ''The Jepson Manual: Higher Plants of California'', Published by University of California Press, 1400 pages  {{ISBN|0-520-08255-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hypanthium]] of the [[Toyon]] shrub is also generally obconic in shape.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan (2008) ''Toyon (Heteromeles arbutifolia)'', GlobalTwitcher, ed. Nicklas Stromberg {{cite web|url=http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid%3D84109%26lang%3Dus |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 19, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719220426/http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=84109&amp;lang=us |archivedate=July 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Asia]]n tree ''[[Eriobotrya]] latifolia'' and several other species within the genus ''[[Eriobotrya]]'' have an obconic [[Calyx (botany)|calyx]], although some individuals manifest [[clavate]] calices.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Dalton Hooker (1879) ''The Flora of British India'', Great Britain India Office, Published by L. Reeve&lt;/ref&gt; The basal portion of the pistil of ''[[Pachypodium baronii]] exhibits the obconic structural design.

As a fungal example the species ''[[Pocillum]] cesatii'' is noted to have an obconic ascospore.&lt;ref&gt;George Massee (1895) ''British Fungus-flora: A Classified Text-book of Mycology''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and historical usage==
The derivation of the word ''obconic'' is based upon the Greek with the common prefix ''ob'', meaning ''inverted'', and the Greek word for angle ''gon'' or ''gonia'', followed by the generic suffix ''ic''.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Urdang, Alexander Humez and Howard G. Zettler (1982) ''Suffixes and Other Word-final Elements of English'', Contributor Laurence Urdang, Published by Gale Research Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically botanists have used the designation ''obconic'' to describe elements of a plant such as the fruit, hypanthium, calyx or pistil base since at least as early as the nineteenth century, and in modern times the term has been generalized to also refer to an entire plant architectural shape.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4246">An '''open-ended question''' cannot be answered with a "yes" or "no" response, or with a static response. Open-ended questions are phrased as a statement which requires a response. The response can be compared to information that is already known to the questioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ackley | first = Betty | title = Nursing diagnosis handbook : an evidence-based guide to planning care | publisher = Mosby | location = Maryland Heights, Mo | year = 2010 | isbn = 9780323071505 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of open-ended questions:
*Tell me about your relationship with your supervisor.  
*How do you see your future?
*Tell me about the children in this photograph.
*What is the purpose of government?
*Why did you choose that answer?
*Tap?

== Education: open questioning ==
The received wisdom in education is that open questions are broadly speaking ‘good’ questions. They invite students to give longer responses that demonstrate their understanding. They are preferable to [[Closed-ended question|closed questions]] (i.e. one that demands a yes/no answer) because they are better for discussions or enquiries, whereas closed questions are only good for knowledge testing. 

Peter Worley argues that this is a false assumption. This is based on Worley’s central arguments that there are two different kinds of open and closed questions: grammatical and conceptual. He argues that educational practitioners should be aiming for questions that are “grammatically closed, but conceptually open”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worley|first=Peter|date=2016-12-03|title=Ariadne’s Clew Absence and presence in the facilitation of philosophical conversations|url=https://www.ojs.unisa.edu.au/index.php/jps/article/view/1350/870|journal=Journal of Philosophy in Schools|language=en|volume=3|issue=2|doi=10.21913/JPS.v3i2.1350|issn=2204-2482}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, in standard parlance, ‘is it ever right to lie?’ would be regarded as a closed question: it elicits a yes/no response. Significantly, however, it is conceptually open. Any initial yes/no answer to it can be ‘opened up’ by the questioner (‘why do you think that?,’ ‘Could there be an instance where that’s not the case?), inviting elaboration and enquiry. 

This grammatically closed but cognitively open style of questioning, Worley argues, “gives [educators] the best of both worlds: the focus and specificity of a closed question (this, after all, is why teachers use them) and the inviting, elaborating character of an open question”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/question-your-questioning|title=Question your questioning|date=2017-04-19|work=Tes|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Closed questions, simply require ‘opening up’ strategies to ensure that conceptually open questions can fulfil their educational potential. 

Worley's structural and semantic distinction between open and closed questions is integral to his pedagogical invention 'Open Questioning Mindset', or OQM. OQM refers to the development, in educators, of an open attitude towards the process of learning and the questioning at the heart of that process. It is a mind-set that is applicable to all subject areas and all pedagogical environments. Teachers who develop an Open Questioning Mindset listen openly for the cognitive content of student’s contributions and looks for ways to use what is given for learning opportunities, whether right, wrong, relevant or apparently irrelevant. OQM encourages a style of pedagogy that values genuine enquiry in the classroom. It provides teachers with the tools to move beyond what Worley calls ‘guess what’s in my head’ teaching, that relies on [[Closed-ended question|closed]] and leading questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worley|first=Peter|date=2015-11-29|title=Open thinking, closed questioning: Two kinds of open and closed question|url=https://www.ojs.unisa.edu.au/index.php/jps/article/view/1269|journal=Journal of Philosophy in Schools|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|doi=10.21913/JPS.v2i2.1269|issn=2204-2482}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Plants systematically use [[Plant hormone|hormonal]] [[signalling pathway]]s to coordinate their own [[Plant development|development]] and morphology.

====Neurochemicals====
Plants produce several proteins found in the animal neuron systems such as [[acetylcholine esterase]], [[glutamate receptor]]s, [[GABA receptor]]s, and [[endocannabinoid]] signaling components. They also use [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[Nitric oxide|NO]], and [[Reactive oxygen species|ROS]] like animals for signaling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Baluška F, Volkmann D, Mancuso S | year = 2006 | title = Communication in Plants: Neuronal Aspects of Plant Life. | publisher = Springer Verlag | isbn = 978-3-540-28475-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Electrophysiology====
Although plant cells are not [[neuron]]s, they can be electrically excitable and can display rapid electrical responses ([[action potential]]s) to environmental stimuli. These action potentials can influence processes such as [[actin]]-based cytoplasmic streaming, [[rapid plant movement|plant organ movements]], wound responses, respiration, [[photosynthesis]], and flowering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Wagner E, Lehner L, Normann J, Veit J, Albrechtova J | year = 2006 | chapter = Hydroelectrochemical integration of the higher plant—basis for electrogenic flower induction | pages = 369–389 | veditors =  Baluska F, Mancuso S, Volkmann D | title = Communication in plants: neuronal aspects of plant life | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fromm J, Lautner S | title = Electrical signals and their physiological significance in plants | journal = Plant, Cell &amp; Environment | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 249–257 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17263772 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3040.2006.01614.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zimmermann MR, Maischak H, Mithöfer A, Boland W, Felle HH | title = System potentials, a novel electrical long-distance apoplastic signal in plants, induced by wounding | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 149 | issue = 3 | pages = 1593–600 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19129416 | pmc = 2649404 | doi = 10.1104/pp.108.133884 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Pickard BG | title = Action Potentials in Higher Plants| jstor = 4353850| journal = Botanical Review| volume = 39| issue = 2| pages = 172–201| year = 1973| doi = 10.1007/BF02859299}}&lt;/ref&gt; These electrical responses can cause the synthesis of numerous [[Organic compound|organic molecules]], including ones that act as neuroactive substances in other organisms.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Thus, plants accomplish [[Behavior|behavioural responses]] in environmental, [[Plant communication|communicative]], and [[Plant ecology|ecological]] contexts.

===Signal response===
{{Further information|Plant hormone|Thigmotropism|Thigmomorphogenesis}}
A plant's concomitant reactive behavior is mediated by [[phytochrome]]s, [[kinin]]s, [[Plant hormone|hormones]], [[antibiotic]] or other chemical release, changes of water and chemical transport, and other means. These responses are generally slow, taking at minimum a number of hours to accomplish, and can best be observed with [[time-lapse]] cinematography, but [[Rapid plant movement|rapid movements]] can occur as well.
Plants respond to volatile signals produced by other plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Farmer EE, Ryan CA | title = Interplant communication: airborne methyl jasmonate induces synthesis of proteinase inhibitors in plant leaves | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 87 | issue = 19 | pages = 7713–6 | date = October 1990 | pmid = 11607107 | pmc = 54818 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.87.19.7713 | bibcode = 1990PNAS...87.7713F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Karban R, Baxter KJ | journal = Journal of Insect Behavior| volume = 14| issue = 2| pages = 147–156|title=Induced Resistance in Wild Tobacco with Clipped Sagebrush Neighbors: The Role of Herbivore Behavior| year = 2001| doi = 10.1023/A:1007893626166}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jasmonate]] levels also increase rapidly in response to mechanical perturbations such as [[tendril]] coiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Falkenstein E, Groth B, Mithöfer A, Weiler EW | title = Methyljasmonate and α-linolenic acid are potent inducers of tendril coiling | journal = Planta | volume = 185 | issue = 3 | pages = 316–22 | date = October 1991 | pmid = 24186412 | doi = 10.1007/BF00201050 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants have many [[inducible plant defenses against herbivory|strategies to fight off pests]]. For example, they can produce different toxins ([[phytoalexin]]s) against invaders or they can induce rapid [[cell death]] in invading cells to hinder the pests from spreading out.

Some plants are capable of [[Rapid plant movement|rapid movement]]: the mimosa plant (''[[Mimosa pudica]]'') makes its thin leaves point down at the slightest touch {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} and [[carnivorous plant]]s such as the [[Venus flytrap]] snap shut by the touch of insects. In the Venus flytrap, touch is detected by [[Cilium|cilia]] that generate an [[action potential]] that stimulates motor cells, by which movement occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Volkov AG, Adesina T, Jovanov E |date=May 1, 2007|title=Closing of Venus Flytrap by Electrical Stimulation of Motor Cells | doi = 10.4161/psb.2.3.4217 | journal=Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior|volume=2|pages=139-145|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In plants, the mechanism responsible for adaptation is [[signal transduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Scheel D, Wasternack C |title=Plant signal transduction |year=2002 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-963879-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Xiong L, Zhu JK | title = Abiotic stress signal transduction in plants: Molecular and genetic perspectives | journal = Physiologia Plantarum | volume = 112 | issue = 2 | pages = 152–166 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11454221 | doi = 10.1034/j.1399-3054.2001.1120202.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clark GB, Thompson G, Roux SJ | title = Signal transduction mechanisms in plants: an overview | journal = Current Science | volume = 80 | issue = 2 | pages = 170–7 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 12194182 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Trewavas A | title = How plants learn | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 96 | issue = 8 | pages = 4216–8 | date = April 1999 | pmid = 10200239 | pmc = 33554 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.8.4216 | bibcode = 1999PNAS...96.4216T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects of perception==

===Light===
[[File:Sonnenblume-hjf.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''The sunflower'', a common heliotropic plant which perceives and reacts to sunlight by slow turning movement]]
{{Main article|Photomorphogenesis|photoperiodism}}
Many plant organs contain photo-sensitive compounds ([[phototropin]]s, [[cryptochrome]]s and [[phytochrome]]s), each reacting very specifically to certain wavelengths of light.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} These light sensors tell the plant if it is day or night, how long the day is, how much light is available and from where the light comes. Shoots grow towards light and roots usually grow away from light. These responses are called [[phototropism]] and skototropism respectively. They are brought about by light sensitive pigments like [[phototropin]]s and [[phytochrome]]s and the plant hormone [[auxin]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}. Many plants exhibit certain phenomena at specific times of the day; for example, certain flowers open only in the mornings. Plants keep track of the time of day with a [[circadian clock]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} This internal clock is set to solar time every day using sunlight, temperature and other cues, similar to the biological clocks of other organisms. The internal clock coupled with the ability to perceive light also allows plants to measure the time of the day and so find the season of the year. This is how many plants know when to flower.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} (see [[photoperiodism]]) The seeds of many plants sprout only after they are exposed to light. This response is carried out by phytochrome signalling. Plants are also able to sense the quality of light and respond appropriately. For example, in low light conditions, plants produce more photosynthetic pigments. If the light is very bright or if the levels of harmful UV increase, plants produce more of their protective pigments that act as sunscreens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Strid | first1 = Åke | last2 = Porra | first2 = Robert J. | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1992 | title = Alterations in Pigment Content in Leaves of Pisum sativum After Exposure to Supplementary UV-B | url = http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/33/7/1015 | journal = Plant and Cell Physiology | volume = 33 | issue = 7| pages = 1015–1023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gravity ===
{{Main article|Gravitropism}}
To orient themselves correctly, plants must have an adequate sense of the direction of gravity’s unidirectional pull. The subsequent response plant movement is known as [[gravitropism]]. Typically, in the root this works as gravity is sensed and translated in the [[Root cap|root tip]], and subsequently roots grow towards gravity via elongation of the cells. In the shoot, similar effects are happening, but gravity is perceived and then growth occurs in the opposite direction, as the above ground part of the plant experiences negative gravitropism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Biological science | last = Freeman | first = Scott | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = Pearson | year = 2014 | isbn = 978-0-321-74367-1 | location = Illinois | pages = 803 | oclc = 821271420 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the root tip, there are [[amyloplast]]s containing starch granules that fall in the direction of gravity. This weight activates secondary receptors, which signal to the plant the direction of gravitational pull. After this occurs, [[auxin]] is redistributed through [[polar auxin transport]] and differential growth towards gravity begins. In the shoots, auxin redistribution occurs in a way to produce differential growth away from gravity.

For perception to happen, the plant must sense, perceive and translate the direction of gravity. Without gravity, proper orientation will not occur and the plant will not effectively grow. The root will not be able to uptake nutrients or water, and the shoot will not grow towards the sky to maximize [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Perrin RM, Young LS, Murthy UM, Harrison BR, Wang Y, Will JL, Masson PH | title = Gravity signal transduction in primary roots | journal = Annals of Botany | volume = 96 | issue = 5 | pages = 737–43 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16033778 | pmc = 4247041 | doi = 10.1093/aob/mci227 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plant intelligence==
{{Further information|Hormonal sentience|Plant cognition}}
Plants do not have a brain or [[neuronal network]], but reactions within signalling pathways may provide a biochemical basis for learning and memory in addition to computation and problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhalla US, Iyengar R | title = Emergent properties of networks of biological signaling pathways | journal = Science | volume = 283 | issue = 5400 | pages = 381–7 | date = January 1999 | pmid = 9888852 | doi = 10.1126/science.283.5400.381 | bibcode = 1999Sci...283..381B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversially, the brain is used as a metaphor in plant intelligence to provide an integrated view of signalling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brenner ED, Stahlberg R, Mancuso S, Vivanco J, Baluska F, Van Volkenburgh E | title = Plant neurobiology: an integrated view of plant signaling | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 413–9 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16843034 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2006.06.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants respond  to [[Stimulus (physiology)|environmental stimuli]] by [[Tropism|movement]] and changes in [[Plant morphology|morphology]]. They  communicate while actively competing for resources. In addition, plants accurately compute their circumstances, use sophisticated [[cost–benefit analysis]] and take tightly controlled actions to mitigate and control diverse environmental stressors. Plants are also capable of discriminating positive and negative experiences and of learning by registering memories from their past experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goh CH, Nam HG, Park YS | title = Stress memory in plants: a negative regulation of stomatal response and transient induction of rd22 gene to light in abscisic acid-entrained Arabidopsis plants | journal = The Plant Journal | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 240–55 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14535888 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-313X.2003.01872.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Volkov AG, Carrell H, Baldwin A, Markin VS | title = Electrical memory in Venus flytrap | journal = Bioelectrochemistry | volume = 75 | issue = 2 | pages = 142–7 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19356999 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.bioelechem.2009.03.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rensing L, Koch M, Becker A | title = A comparative approach to the principal mechanisms of different memory systems | journal = Die Naturwissenschaften | volume = 96 | issue = 12 | pages = 1373–84 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19680619 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/s00114-009-0591-0 | bibcode = 2009NW.....96.1373R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gagliano M, Renton M, Depczynski M, Mancuso S | title = Experience teaches plants to learn faster and forget slower in environments where it matters | journal = Oecologia | volume = 175 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–72 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24390479 | doi = 10.1007/s00442-013-2873-7 | url = https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-013-2873-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gagliano M, Vyazovskiy VV, Borbély AA, Grimonprez M, Depczynski M | title = Learning by Association in Plants | language = En | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 38427 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27910933 | doi = 10.1038/srep38427 | url = https://www.nature.com/articles/srep38427 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants use this information to update their behaviour in order to survive present and future challenges of their environment.

Plant physiology studies the role of [[Signal transduction|signalling]] to integrate data obtained at the [[Plant genetics|genetic]], [[Phytochemistry|biochemical]], [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] and [[Plant physiology|physiological]] levels to understand plant development and behaviour. The neurobiological view sees plants as information-processing organisms with rather complex processes of communication occurring throughout the individual plant organism. It studies how environmental information is gathered, processed, integrated and shared (sensory plant biology) to enable these adaptive and coordinated responses (plant behaviour); and how  sensory perceptions and behavioural events are 'remembered' in order to allow predictions of future activities upon the basis of past experiences. Plants, it is claimed by some plant physiologists, are as sophisticated in behaviour as animals but this sophistication has been masked by the time scales of plants' response to stimuli, many [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] slower than animals'.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

It has been argued that although plants are capable of adaptation, it should not be called intelligence, as plant neurobiologists are relying primarily on metaphors and analogies to argue that complex responses in plants can only be produced by intelligence.&lt;ref name="NoBrain" /&gt; ''"A bacterium can monitor its environment and instigate developmental processes appropriate to the prevailing circumstances, but is that intelligence? Such simple adaptation behaviour might be bacterial intelligence but is clearly not animal intelligence."''&lt;ref name="firn2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Firn R | title = Plant intelligence: an alternative point of view | journal = Annals of Botany | volume = 93 | issue = 4 | pages = 345–51 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15023701 | pmc = 4242337 | doi = 10.1093/aob/mch058 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, plant intelligence fits a definition of intelligence proposed by [[David Stenhouse]] in a book about evolution and animal intelligence where he described it as "adaptively variable behaviour during the lifetime of the individual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Helen | last = Phillips | name-list-format = vanc | title = Not just a pretty face | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17523535.700-not-just-a-pretty-face.html | date = 27 July 2002 | work =  New Scientist }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the concept have also argued that a plant cannot have goals once it is past the development stage of seedling because, as a modular organism, each module seeks its own survival goals and the resulting organism level behavior is not centrally controlled.&lt;ref name="firn2004"/&gt; This view, however, necessarily accommodates the possibility that a tree is a collection of individually intelligent modules cooperating, competing and influencing each other to determine behavior in a bottom-up fashion. The development into a larger organism whose modules must deal with different environmental conditions and challenges is not universal across plant species however, as smaller organisms might be subject to the same conditions across their bodies, at least, when the below and above ground parts are considered separately. Moreover, the claim that central control of development is completely absent from plants is readily falsified by apical dominance.

The Italian botanist [[Federico Delpino]] wrote on the idea of plant intelligence in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mancuso S | title = Federico Delpino and the foundation of plant biology | journal = Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior | volume = 5 | issue = 9 | pages = 1067–71 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 21490417 | pmc = 3115070 | doi = 10.4161/psb.5.9.12102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Darwin]] studied the movement of plants and in 1880 published a book ''[[The Power of Movement in Plants]]''.  In the book he concludes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the [[radicle]] thus endowed [..] acts like the brain of one of the lower animals; the brain being situated within the anterior end of the body, receiving impressions from the sense-organs, and directing the several movements.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In philosophy, there are few studies of the implications of plant perception. [[Michael Marder]] put forth a [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of plant life based on the physiology of plant perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marder M | title = Plant intentionality and the phenomenological framework of plant intelligence | journal = Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior | volume = 7 | issue = 11 | pages = 1365–72 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 22951403 | pmc = 3548850 | doi = 10.4161/psb.21954 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paco Calvo Garzon offers a philosophical take on plant perception based on the cognitive sciences and the computational modeling of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garzón FC | title = The quest for cognition in plant neurobiology | journal = Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 208–11 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 19516990 | pmc = 2634130 | doi = 10.4161/psb.2.4.4470 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison to neurobiology===
A plant's sensory and response system has been compared to the [[neurobiological]] processes of animals. [[Plant neurobiology]], an unfamiliar misnomer, concerns mostly the sensory [[adaptive behaviour (ecology)|adaptive behaviour]] of plants and plant [[electrophysiology]]. [[India]]n  scientist [[J. C. Bose]] is credited as the first person to research and talk about neurobiology of plants. Many plant scientists and neuroscientists, however, view this as inaccurate, because plants do not have neurons.&lt;ref name="NoBrain"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alpi A, Amrhein N, Bertl A, Blatt MR, Blumwald E, Cervone F, Dainty J, De Michelis MI, Epstein E, Galston AW, Goldsmith MH, Hawes C, Hell R, Hetherington A, Hofte H, Juergens G, Leaver CJ, Moroni A, Murphy A, Oparka K, Perata P, Quader H, Rausch T, Ritzenthaler C, Rivetta A, Robinson DG, Sanders D, Scheres B, Schumacher K, Sentenac H, Slayman CL, Soave C, Somerville C, Taiz L, Thiel G, Wagner R | title = Plant neurobiology: no brain, no gain? | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 135–6 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17368081 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2007.03.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas behind plant neurobiology were criticised in a 2007 article&lt;ref name="NoBrain" /&gt; published in ''[[Trends in Plant Science]]'' by Amedeo Alpi and 35 other scientists, including such eminent plant biologists as [[Gerd Jürgens]], Ben Scheres, and Chris Sommerville. The breadth of fields of plant science represented by these researchers reflects the fact that the vast majority of the plant science research community reject plant neurobiology.  Their main arguments are that:&lt;ref name="NoBrain" /&gt;
* "Plant neurobiology does not add to our understanding of plant physiology, plant cell biology or signaling".
* "There is no evidence for structures such as neurons, synapses or a brain in plants".
* The common occurrence of [[plasmodesmata]] in plants which "poses a problem for signaling from an electrophysiological point of view" since  extensive electrical coupling would preclude the need for any cell-to-cell transport of a ‘neurotransmitter-like’ compounds.
The authors call for an end to "superficial analogies and questionable extrapolations" if the concept of "plant neurobiology" is to benefit the research community.&lt;ref name="NoBrain" /&gt;

There were several responses to the criticism clarifying that the term "plant neurobiology" is a metaphor and metaphors have proved useful on several previous occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Trewavas A | title = Response to Alpi et al.: Plant neurobiology--all metaphors have value | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 231–3 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17499006 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2007.04.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brenner ED, Stahlberg R, Mancuso S, Baluska F, Van Volkenburgh E | title = Response to Alpi et al.: plant neurobiology: the gain is more than the name | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 285–6 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17591455 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2007.06.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ecophysiology#Plants|Plant ecophysiology]] describes this phenomenon.&lt;!--{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} unnecessary--&gt;

===Parallels in other taxa===

As described above in the case of a plant, similar mechanisms exist in a bacterial cell, a choanoflagellate, a fungal hypha, or a sponge, among the many other examples. All of these individual organisms of the respective taxa, despite being devoid of a brain or nervous system, are capable of sensing their immediate and momentary environment and responding accordingly. In the case of single-celled life, the sensory pathways are even more primitive in the sense that they take place on the surface of a single cell, as opposed to a network of many cells.

{{History of Greek art}}

The '''Protogeometric style''' (or "Proto-Geometric") is a style of [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek pottery]] led by [[Athens]] produced between roughly 1050 and 900 BC, the period of the [[Greek Dark Ages]] and the beginning of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]].&lt;ref&gt;Cook, 30&lt;/ref&gt; After the collapse of the [[Mycenaean civilization|Mycenaean]]-[[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] Palace culture and the ensuing Greek Dark Ages, the Protogeometric style emerged around the mid 11th century BCE as the first expression of a reviving civilization. Following on from the development of a faster potter's wheel, vases of this period are markedly more technically accomplished than earlier Dark Age examples. The decoration of these pots is restricted to purely abstract elements and very often includes broad horizontal bands about the neck and belly and concentric circles applied with compass and multiple brush.  Many other simple motifs can be found, but unlike many pieces in the following [[Geometric art|Geometric style]], typically much of the surface is left plain.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many pieces, the example illustrated includes a colour change in the main band, arising from a firing fault.  Both the red and black colour use the same clay, differently [[Elutriation|levigated]] and fired.  As the Greeks learnt to control this variation, the path to their distinctive [[three-phase firing]] technique opened.

Some of the innovations included some new [[Mycene]]an influenced shapes, such as the belly-handled [[amphora]], the neck handled amphora, the [[krater]], and the [[lekythos]]. [[Attica|Attic]] artists redesigned these vessels using the fast wheel to increase the height and therefore the area available for decoration.

From Athens the style spread to several other centres.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, 30-31&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public opinion''' consists of the desires, wants, and thinking of the majority of the people; it is the collective opinion of the people of a society or state on an issue or problem.

This [[concept]] came about through the process of [[urbanization]] and other political and social forces. For the first time, it became important what people thought, as forms of political contention changed.

==Etymology==
The term ''public opinion'' was derived from the French ''opinion publique'' which was first used in 1588 by [[Michel de Montaigne]] in the second edition of his ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essays]]'' (ch. XXII).&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Braatz, ''Friedrich Nietzsche: Eine Studie zur Theorie der Öffentlichen Meinung'', Walter de Gruyter, 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French term also appears in the 1761 work ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise]]'' by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].&lt;ref&gt;The term ''opinion publique'' appears in the chapter: "Lettre XXIV à Julie" of the book.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Speier&gt;Hans Speier, "Historical Development of Public Opinion", ''American Journal of Sociology'', Vol. 55, No. 4 (Jan., 1950), pp. 376–388. {{doi|10.1086/220561}}. {{jstor|2772299}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Precursors of the phrase in English include [[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|William Temple]]'s "general opinion" (appearing in his 1672 work ''On the Original and Nature of Government'') and [[John Locke]]'s "law of opinion" (appearing in his 1689 work ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'').&lt;ref name=Speier/&gt;

==History==
The emergence of public opinion as a significant force in the political realm can be dated to the late 17th century. However, opinion had been regarded as having singular importance since far earlier. Medieval ''fama publica'' or ''vox et fama communis'' had great legal and social importance from the 12th and 13th centuries onward.&lt;ref&gt;See {{fr}} [http://books.openedition.org/pur/15839?lang=fr Julien Théry, "''Fama'' : l'opinion publique comme preuve judiciaire. Aperçu sur la révolution médiévale de l'inquisitoire (XIIe-XIVe s.)", in B. Lemesle (ed.), ''La preuve en justice de l'Antiquité à nos jours'', Rennes, PUR, 2003, pp. 119–147, available online], and Daniel Smail, Thelma Fernster (ed), Fama. ''The Politics of Talk and Reputation'', Ithaca, Cornell University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[William Shakespeare]] called public opinion the 'mistress of success' and [[Blaise Pascal]] thought it was 'the queen of the world.'

[[John Locke]] in his treatise ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' considered that man was subject to three laws: the [[divine law]], the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and most importantly in Locke's judgement, the law of [[opinion]] or [[reputation]]. He regarded the latter as of the highest importance because dislike and ''ill opinion'' force people to conform in their behaviour to social norms, however he didn't consider public opinion as a suitable influence for governments.

[[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|William Temple]] in his essay of 1672, ''On the Original and Nature of Government'' gave an early formulation of the importance of public opinion. He observed that "...when vast numbers of men submit their lives and fortunes absolutely to the will of one, it...must be force of custom, or opinion...which subjects power to authority."

Temple disagreed with the prevalent opinion that the basis of government lay in a [[social contract]] and thought that government was merely allowed to exist due to the favour of public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Historical Development of Public Opinion|last=Speier|first=Hans|journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|issn=1537-5390|volume=55|issue=4|year=1950|pages=376–88|jstor=2772299|registration=y|doi=10.1086/220561|url=http://www.raco.cat/index.php/Analisi/article/download/15081/189532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prerequisites for the emergence of a public sphere were increasing levels of literacy which was spurred on by the [[Reformation]], which encouraged individuals to read the [[Bible]] in the vernacular, and the rapidly expanding printing presses. During the 18th century religious literature was replaced with secular literature, novels and pamphlets. In parallel to this was the growth in reading societies and clubs. At the turn of the century the first circulating library opened in London and the [[public library]] became widespread and available to the public.

===Coffee-houses===
[[File:17th century coffeehouse england 1-580x400.jpg|thumb|right|Coffeehouse in [[London]], 17th century]]
An institution of central importance in the development of public opinion, was the [[coffee-house]], which became widespread throughout Europe in the mid-17th century. Although [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] later tried to suppress the London coffeehouses as "places where the disaffected met, and spread scandalous reports concerning the conduct of His Majesty and his Ministers", the public flocked to them. For several decades following the Restoration, the [[Wit]]s gathered round [[John Dryden]] at [[Will's Coffee House]], in Russell Street, Covent Garden.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gk8OAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22places%20where%20the%20disaffected%20met%2C%20and%20spread%20scandalous%20reports%20concerning%20the%20conduct%20of%20His%20Majesty%20and%20his%20Ministers%22&amp;pg=PA531#v=onepage&amp;q=%22places%20where%20the%20disaffected%20met,%20and%20spread%20scandalous%20reports%20concerning%20the%20conduct%20of%20His%20Majesty%20and%20his%20Ministers%22&amp;f=false An historical and chronological deduction of the origin of commerce, from the earliest accounts. : Containing an history of the great commercial interests of the British Empire. To which is prefixed an introduction, exhibiting a view of the ancient and modern state of Europe ; of the importance of our colonies ; and of the commerce, shipping, manufactures, fisheries, &amp;c., of Great-Britain and Ireland ; and their influence on the landed interest. With an appendix, containing the modern politico-commercial geography of the several countries of Europe. Author:	Adam Anderson; William Combe; John Walter; Logographic Press.]&lt;/ref&gt; The coffee houses were great social levellers, open to all men and indifferent to social status, and as a result associated with equality and republicanism.

More generally, coffee houses became meeting places where business could be carried on, news exchanged and ''[[The London Gazette]]'' (government announcements) read. [[Lloyd's of London]] had its origins in a coffeehouse run by [[Edward Lloyd (coffeehouse owner)|Edward Lloyd]], where underwriters of ship insurance met to do business. By 1739, there were 551 coffeehouses in London; each attracted a particular clientele divided by occupation or attitude, such as [[Tory|Tories]] and [[Whig (British political faction)|Whigs]], wits and [[stockjobber]]s, merchants and lawyers, booksellers and authors, men of fashion or the "cits" of the [[City of London|old city center]]. [[Joseph Addison]] wanted to have it said of him that he had "brought philosophy out of closets and libraries to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea tables and in coffee houses." According to one French visitor, [[Antoine François Prévost]], coffeehouses, "where you have the right to read all the papers for and against the government," were the "seats of English liberty."&lt;ref&gt;Prévost, Abbé (1930) ''Adventures of a man of quality'' (translation of ''Séjour en Angleterre'', v. 5 of ''Mémoires et avantures d'un homme de qualité qui s'est retiré du monde'') G. Routledge &amp; Sons, London, {{OCLC|396693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gentleman clubs===
[[File:Joseph Highmore - A Club of Gentlemen - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''A Club of Gentlemen'' by [[Joseph Highmore]] c. 1730.]]
[[Gentlemen's club]]s proliferated in the 18th century, especially in the [[West End of London]]. Clubs took over the role occupied by coffee houses in 18th century London to some degree, and reached the height of their influence in the late 19th century – some notable names were [[White's]], [[Brooks's]], [[Arthur's]], and [[Boodle's]] which still exist today.

These social changes, in which a closed and largely illiterate public became an open and politicized one, was to become of tremendous political importance in the 19th century as the mass media was circulated ever more widely and literacy was steadily improved. Governments increasingly recognized the importance of [[propaganda|managing and directing public opinion]]. This trend is exemplified in the career of [[George Canning]] who restyled his political career from its aristocratic origins to one of popular consent when he contested and won the parliamentary seat in [[Liverpool]]; a city with a growing and affluent middle class, which he attributed to the growing influence of "public opinion."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen M. Lee, "George Canning and Liberal Toryism, 1801–1827" Woodbridge: Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeremy Bentham]] was an impassioned advocate of the importance of public opinion in the shaping of constitutional governance. He thought it important that all government acts and decisions should be subject to the inspection of public opinion, because "to the pernicious exercise of the power of government it is the only check."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482436/public-opinion/258764/Public-opinion-and-government|title=public opinion}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opined that public opinion had the power to ensure that rulers would rule for the greatest happiness of the greater number. He brought in [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian philosophy]] in order to define theories of public opinion.

==Concepts==

The German sociologist [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], by using the conceptional tools of his theory of [[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft]], argued (''Kritik der öffentlichen Meinung'', 1922), that 'public opinion' has the equivalent [[social function]] in societies (''Gesellschaften'') which [[religion]] has in communities (''Gemeinschaften'').&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Fechner/[[Lars Clausen]]/Arno Bammé (eds.): ''Öffentliche Meinung zwischen neuer Religion und neuer Wissenschaft. Ferdinand Tönnies' "Kritik der öffentlichen Meinung" in der internationalen Diskussion'', in: ''Tönnies im Gespräch'', tom. 3, Munich/Vienna: Profil 2005, {{ISBN|3-89019-590-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

German social theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]] contributed the idea of "[[Public sphere]]" to the discussion of public opinion. The Public Sphere, or bourgeois public, is according to Habermas, where "something approaching public opinion can be formed" (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;351). Habermas claimed that the Public Sphere featured universal access, rational debate, and disregard for rank. However, he believes that these three features for how public opinion are best formed are no longer in place in western [[Liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] countries. Public opinion, in western democracy, is highly susceptible to elite manipulation.

The American sociologist [[Herbert Blumer]] has proposed an altogether different conception of the "public". According to Blumer, public opinion is discussed as a form of [[collective behavior]] (another specialized term) which is made up of those who are discussing a given public issue at any one time. Given this definition, there are many publics; each of them comes into being when an issue arises and ceases to exist when the issue is resolved. Blumer claims that people participate in public in different capacities and to different degrees. So, public opinion polling cannot measure the public. An educated individual's participation is more important than that of a drunk. The "mass", in which people independently make decisions about, for example, which brand of toothpaste to buy, is a form of collective behavior different from the public.

Public opinion plays an important role in the political sphere. Cutting across all aspects of relationship between government and public opinion are studies of voting behavior. These have registered the distribution of opinions on a wide variety of issues, have explored the impact of special interest groups on election outcomes and have contributed to our knowledge about the effects of government propaganda and policy.

Contemporary, quantitative approaches to the study of public opinion may be divided into 4 categories:
# quantitative measurement of opinion distributions;
# investigation of the internal relationships among the individual opinions that make up public opinion on an issue;
# description or analysis of the public role of public opinion;
# study both of the communication media that disseminate the ideas on which opinions are based and of the uses that propagandists and other manipulators make of these media.

The rapid spread of public opinion measurement around the world is reflection of the number of uses to which it can be put. Public opinion can be accurately obtained through [[survey sampling]]. Both private firms and governments use [[opinion poll|surveys]] to inform public policies and public relations.

==Formation==
Numerous theories and substantial evidence exists to explain the formation and dynamics of individuals' opinions. Much of this research draws on psychological research on [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]]. In [[communications studies]] and [[political science]], [[mass media]] are often seen as influential forces on public opinion. Additionally, [[political socialization]] and [[behavioral genetics]] sometimes explain public opinion.

===Mass media effects===
The formation of public opinion starts with [[Agenda-setting theory|agenda setting]] by major media outlets throughout the world. This agenda setting dictates what is newsworthy and how and when it will be reported. The media agenda is set by a variety of different environmental and newswork factors that determines which stories will be newsworthy.

Another key component in the formation of public opinion is [[Framing (social sciences)|framing]]. Framing is when a story or piece of news is portrayed in a particular way and is meant to sway the consumers attitude one way or the other. Most political issues are heavily framed in order to persuade voters to vote for a particular candidate. For example, if Candidate X once voted on a bill that raised income taxes on the middle class, a framing headline would read "Candidate X Doesn't Care About the Middle Class". This puts Candidate X in a negative frame to the news reader.

[[Social desirability]] is another key component to the formation of public opinion. Social desirability is the idea that people in general will form their opinions based on what they believe is the prevalent opinion of the social group they identify with. Based on media agenda setting and media framing, most often a particular opinion gets repeated throughout various news mediums and [[social network]]ing sites, until it creates a false vision where the perceived truth can actually be very far away from the actual truth.

Public opinion can be influenced by [[public relations]] and the [[political media]]. Additionally, [[mass media]] utilizes a wide variety of [[advertising]] techniques to get their message out and change the minds of people. Since the 1950s, [[television]] has been the main [[mass media|medium]] for molding public opinion.&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p53"&gt;Diggs-Brown, Barbara (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7c0ycySng4YC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53 ''Strategic Public Relations: Audience Focused Practice''] p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of influentials==
{{see also|Two-step flow of communication}}
There have been a variety of academic studies investigating whether or not public opinion is influenced by "[[Social influence|influentials]]," or persons that have a significant effect on influencing opinion of the general public regarding any relevant issues.  Many early studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elihu Katz and Paul Felix Lazarsfeld|title=Personal Influence: the Part Played by People in the Flow of Mass Communications|year=1955|isbn=1-4128-0507-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lazarsfeld et al., 1968&lt;/ref&gt; have modeled the transfer of information from [[mass media]] sources to the general public as a "two-step" process.  In this process, information from mass media and other far-reaching sources of information influences influentials, and influentials then influence the general public as opposed to the mass media directly influencing the public.

While the "two-step" process regarding public opinion influence has motivated further research on the role of influential persons, a more recent study by Watts and Dodds (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Watts, D.J. and P.S. Dodds|year=2007|title=Influentials, Networks, and Public Opinion Formation|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=34|issue=4|pages=441–458|url=https://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/research/papers/others/2007/watts2007a.pdf|doi=10.1086/518527}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that while influentials play some role in influencing public opinion, "non-influential" persons that make up the general public are also just as likely (if not more likely) to influence opinion provided that the general public is composed of persons that are easily influenced.  This is referred to in their work as the "Influential Hypothesis."  The authors discuss such results by using a model to quantify the number of people influenced by both the general public and influentials.  The model can be easily customized to represent a variety of ways that influencers interact with each other as well as the general public.  In their study, such a model diverges from the prior paradigm of the "two-step" process.  The Watts and Dodds model introduces a model of influence emphasizing lateral channels of influence between the influencers and general public categories.  This thus leads to a more complex flow of influence amongst the three parties involved in influencing public opinion (i.e., media, influencers and general public).

==Relationship with public policy==
The most pervasive issue dividing theories of the opinion-policy relation bears a striking resemblance to the problem of [[monism]]-[[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] in the history of philosophy. The controversy deals with the question of whether the structure of [[socio-political]] action should be viewed as a more or less centralized process of acts and decisions by a class of key leaders, representing integrated hierarchies of influence in society or whether it is more accurately envisaged as several sets of relatively autonomous opinion and influence groups, interacting with representative [[decision maker]]s in an official structure of differentiated [[governmental authority]]. The former assumption interprets individual, group and official action as part of a single system and reduces politics and governmental policies to a derivative of three basic analytical terms: society, culture and [[personality]].

Despite philosophical arguments regarding public opinion, social scientists (those in [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[economics]] and [[social psychology]]) present compelling theories to describe how public opinion shapes public policy and find myriad effects of opinion on policy using various empirical research methods. Moreover, researchers find that causal relationships likely run in both directions from opinion to policy and from policy to opinion. On the one hand, public opinion signals public preferences and potential voting behaviors to policymakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pierson|first1=Paul|title=Coping with Permanent Austerity: Welfare State Restructuring in Affluent Democracies|journal=Revue Française de Sociologie|date=2002|volume=43|issue=2|pages=369–406|jstor=3322510|doi=10.2307/3322510}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Soroka|first1=Stuart|last2=Wlezien|first2=Christopher|title=Degrees of Democracy: Politics, Public Opinion and Policy|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; This impact should be greater under more stable democratic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Papadakis|first1=Elim|title=Public Opinion, Public Policy and the Welfare State|journal=Political Studies|date=1992|volume=40|issue=1|pages=21–37|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9248.1992.tb01758.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be greatest in the realm of social policy because the public are highly motivated by potential goods and services they get from the state. On the other hand, social policy impacts public opinion. The goods and services the public gets via social policy builds normative expectations that shape public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mau|first1=Steffen|title=Welfare Regimes and the Norms of Social Exchange|journal=Current Sociology|date=2004|volume=52|issue=1|pages=53–74|doi=10.1177/0011392104039314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Oorschot|first1=Wim|title=Culture and Social Policy: A Developing Field of Study|journal=International Journal of Social Welfare|date=2007|volume=16|issue=2|pages=129–139|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2397.2006.00451.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plus, social policy constitutes the largest share of state spending budgets, making it an active and contentious political area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Expenditures Database|url=https://www.oecd.org/social/expenditure.htm|publisher=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together these theories suggest that causal effects are part of a feedback loop between opinion and policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=Andrea Louise|title=Policy Makes Mass Politics|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|date=2012|volume=15|issue=1|pages=333–351|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-012610-135202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wlezien|first1=Christopher|last2=Soroka|first2=Stuart|title=Relationships between Public Opinion and Policy|journal=Oxford Handbook of Political Behavior|date=2007|pages=799–817|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199270125.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199270125-e-043?mediaType=Article}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shapiro|first1=Robert|title=Public Opinion and American Democracy|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|date=2011|volume=75|issue=5|pages=982–1017|doi=10.1093/poq/nfr053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using increasingly sophisticated methods, scholars are beginning to grasp and identify the feedback of opinion and policy and use this phenomenon to explain the path dependency of institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Breznau|first1=Nate|title=Positive Returns and Equilibrium: Simultaneous Feedback Between Public Opinion and Social Policy|journal=Policy Studies Journal|date=14 July 2016|doi=10.1111/psj.12171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wlezien|first1=Christopher|title=The Public as Thermostat: Dynamics of Preferences for Spending|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=1995|volume=39|issue=4|pages=981–1000|jstor=2111666|doi=10.2307/2111666}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pierson|first1=Paul|title=Increasing Returns, Path Dependence, and the Study of Politics|journal=The American Political Science Review|date=2000|volume=94|issue=2|pages=251–267|jstor=2586011|doi=10.2307/2586011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with foreign policy==
As with public policy, public opinion also has a close relationship with [[foreign policy]]. There is much debate concerning what the relationship is, and the study of foreign policy's relationship with public opinion has evolved over time, with the Almond-Lippmann Consensus being one of the first attempt to define this relationship. Published before the Vietnam War, Almond and Lippmann argued that public opinion about foreign policy was unstructured, incoherent, and highly volatile, and that public opinion shouldn't influence foreign policy.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;Holsti, Ole R. "Public Opinion and Foreign Policy: Challenges to the Almond-Lippmann Consensus Mershon Series: Research Programs and Debates." International Studies Quarterly, vol. 36, no. 4, 1992, pp. 439–466. {{jstor|2600734}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies have rebuked the Almond-Lippmann Consensus, showing how people's opinions are generally stable, and that while individuals may not be entirely informed about every issue, they still act efficiently and rationally.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew A. Baum and Philip B. K. Potter, "The Relationships Between Mass Media, Public Opinion, and Foreign Policy: Toward a Theoretical Synthesis," ''Annual Review of Political Science'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

People’s judgments about issues are often based on heuristics, which are mental shortcuts that allow rational decisions to be made quickly. [[Heuristics]] apply to public opinion about domestic as well as foreign policy. The deductive heuristic is one that relies on a person's core values and social groups. Delegative heuristics are influenced by figures of authority such as the media or president.&lt;ref&gt;Sniderman, Paul. Reasoning and Choice. ''Explorations in Political Psychology''&lt;/ref&gt;

Another key theory about how people form their opinions on foreign policy issues is Hurwitz and Peffley's hierarchical attitudes model. They argue that it is structured, with core values providing the basis for postures which further influence the ultimate issue position.&lt;ref&gt;Hurwitz, Jon, and Mark Peffley. "How Are Foreign Policy Attitudes Structured? A Hierarchical Model." The American Political Science Review, vol. 81, no. 4, 1987, pp. 1099–1120. {{jstor|1962580}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public opinion about foreign policy is measured in the same way that all public opinion is measured. Through [[Opinion poll|polls]] and surveys, respondents are asked about their issue positions. Conclusions are drawn by researchers by applying the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/12/methods-101-random-sampling/ pewresearch.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with U.S. Presidency==
According to Robert Shapiro, public opinion and policy-making are fundamental to a democracy, which is linked to electoral accountability, meaning that the leader who was elected "will not deviate far from voters’ opinion".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A problem that arises when analyzing the data collected by researchers is how these issues that are "important" are selected when collecting the data about public opinion. It is hard to determine if there has been underdevelopment of certain issues. Another concern is how elites influence public opinion by persuasion and rhetoric, ultimately shaping policy-making. These two variables are ambiguous by nature and are hard to get to any conclusions, in most cases beyond the limits of research. Other variables to look at when analyzing the opinion-policy effect are the size of the majority public, election cycle time, degree of electoral competition, and the type of issue. For example, domestic affairs public opinion will be of greater importance than that of foreign affairs, because of the complexity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shapiro|first1=Robert|date=2011|title=Public Opinion and American Democracy|url=https://academic.oup.com/poq/article-abstract/75/5/982/1826441|journal=The Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=75|issue=5|pages=982–1017|doi=10.1093/poq/nfr053|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since presidents have the ability to influence their political agenda, it is easier for them to respond to public opinion. Also, since they are not an institution (like Congress) they can "shift the standards by which the public evaluates their performance in office – away from policy concerns and towards more symbolic activities, image, and personality."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A study by James N. Druckman and Lawrence R. Jacobs discusses how presidents collect their information for policymaking. They found that on one hand, they collect data about the public's preference on salient matters like crime and economy. This reflects a populist type of democracy where the government portrays respect toward the people's views and they are connected. On the other hand, government institutions and elites believe the general populations’ understanding of certain issued is limited, therefore they exercise autonomy when making these decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Druckman|first1=J.N.|date=2009|title=Presidential Responsiveness to public opinion|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238859.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199238859-e-8|journal=The Oxford Handbook of American Presidency|volume=|page=454|pages=|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238859.003.0008|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Baum and Kernell have stated that a challenge that modern presidents face when trying to persuade public opinion is that there is so many different types of media, that getting people's attention is hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baum and Kernell|first1=M.A., S|title=Has Cable Ended the Golden Age of Presidential Television?|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=93|pages=99–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; New media alternatives has also caused on effect on Presidential leadership as they now use them to be able to communicate younger generations, but targeting small groups of people.

[[Image:Ventilated wall scheme.jpg|thumb|Air circulating scheme]]

A '''rainscreen''' is an exterior [[wall]] detail where the [[siding]] (wall cladding) stands off from the [[moisture]]-[[Hydraulic conductivity|resistant]] surface of an air barrier applied to the sheathing (sheeting) to create a capillary break and to allow drainage and evaporation. The ''rain screen'' is the siding itself&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/aiaucmp/groups/ek_members/documents/pdf/aiab098384.pdf Micheal J. Lough and David Altenhofen, "The Rain Screen Principle"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322013717/http://www.aia.org/aiaucmp/groups/ek_members/documents/pdf/aiab098384.pdf |date=2014-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the term rainscreen implies a system of building. Ideally the rain screen prevents the wall air/moisture barrier on sheathing from getting wet. In some cases a rainscreen wall is called a ''pressure-equalized rainscreen'' wall where the ventilation openings are large enough for the air pressure to nearly equalize on both sides of the rain screen,&lt;ref name="Brown" &gt;Brown, W. C, Rousseau, M. Z., and Dalgliesh, W. A., "Field Testing of Pressure-Equalized Rain Screen Walls," Donaldson, Barry, ed.. ''Exterior wall systems: glass and concrete technology, design, and construction''. Philadelphia, PA: ASTM, 1991. 59. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; but this name has been criticized as being redundant&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, M.Z., "Facts and Fictions of Rain-Screen Walls", ''Construction Canada'', 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; and is only useful to scientists and engineers.

==Definitions==
A ''screen'' in general terms is a barrier.&lt;ref&gt;"Screen" def. 2. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The rainscreen in a wall is sometimes defined as the first layer of material on the wall, the siding itself.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; Also, rainscreen is defined as the entire system of the siding, ''drainage plane'' and a ''moisture/air barrier''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ctu-sc/files/doc/ctu-sc/ctu-n17_eng.pdf ''Pressure Equalization in Rainscreen Wall Systems'', National Research Council of Canada]. Retrieved 2013-12-01&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archinfo.it/whitepaper_library/RainScreenPrinciple.pdf ''The Rainscreen Principle in Design'', National Research Council of Canada]. Retrieved 2013-12-01&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Masonry veneer|veneer]] that does not stand off from the wall sheathing to create a [[cavity wall|cavity]] is not a rainscreen. However, a [[masonry veneer#Rain screens|masonry veneer]] can be a rainscreen wall if it is ventilated&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gobrick.com/Portals/25/docs/Technical%20Notes/TN27.pdf Technical Note 27, ''Brick Masonry Rain Screen Walls''] (pdf file) Brick Industry Association. Retrieved 4 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Many terms have been applied to rain screen walls including basic, open, conventional, pressure-equalized, pressure-moderated rainscreen systems or assemblies. These terms have caused confusion as to what a rain screen is but all reflect the ''rainscreen principle'' of a primary and secondary line of defense. One technical difference is between a plane, a gap of {{convert|3/8|in|mm}} or less and a channel, a gap of more than {{convert|3/8|in|mm}}.

In general terms a rainscreen wall may be called a ''cavity'' or ''drained wall''.&lt;ref name="WBDG" &gt;[http://www.wbdg.org/design/env_wall.php "Building Envelope Design Guide - Wall Systems" in ''Whole Building Design Guide'']&lt;/ref&gt; The two other basic types of exterior walls in terms of water resistance are ''barrier walls'' which rely on the one exterior surface to prevent ingress and ''mass walls'' which allow but absorb some leakage.&lt;ref name="WBDG"/&gt;

==History==
In the early 1960s research was conducted in Norway on rain penetration of windows and walls, and Øivind Birkeland published a treatise referring to a "rain barrier". In 1963 the Canadian National Research Counsel published a pamphlet titled "Rain Penetration and its Control" using the term "open rain screen".&lt;ref&gt;G.K. Garden, "Rain Penetration and its Control". ''Canadian Building Digest'' (40) 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rainscreen cladding==
Rainscreen cladding is a kind of double-wall construction that utilizes a surface to help keep the rain out, as well as an inner layer to offer thermal insulation, prevent excessive air leakage and carry wind loading. The surface breathes just like a skin as the inner layer reduces energy losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanfibercement.com/information/rainscreen-cladding/|title=Rainscreen Cladding|work=American Fiber Cement Corporation.|date=2015|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The rainscreen system==
For water to enter a wall first the water must get onto the wall and the wall must have openings. Water can then enter the wall by capillary action, gravity, momentum, and air pressure (wind).&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt; The rainscreen system provides for two lines of defense against the water intrusion into the walls: The rainscreen and a means to dissipate leakage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aia.org/aiaucmp/groups/ek_members/documents/pdf/aiab098384.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322013717/http://www.aia.org/aiaucmp/groups/ek_members/documents/pdf/aiab098384.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; often referred to as a channel.
In a rainscreen the air gap allows the circulation of air on the [[Housewrap|moisture barrier]]. (These may or may not serve as a [[Vapor barrier|vapour barrier]], which can be installed on the interior or exterior side of the insulation depending on the climate). This helps direct water away from the main exterior wall which in many climates is insulated. Keeping the insulation dry helps prevent problems such as mold formation and water leakage. The vapour-permeable air/weather barrier prevents water molecules from entering the insulated cavity but allows the passage of vapour, thus reducing the trapping of moisture within the main wall assembly.

The air gap (or cavity) can be created in several ways. One method is to use [[furring]] (battens, strapping) fastened vertically to the wall. Ventilation openings are made at the bottom and top of the wall so air can naturally rise through the cavity. Wall penetrations including windows and doors require special care to maintain the ventilation. In the pressure-equalized system the ventilation openings must be large enough to allow air-flow to equalize the pressure on both sides of the cladding. A ratio of 10:1 cladding leakage area to ventilation area has been suggested.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;

A water/air resistant membrane is placed between the furring and the sheathing to prevent rain water from entering the wall structure. The membrane directs water away and toward special drip edge [[Flashing (weatherproofing)|flashings]] which protect other parts of the building.

[[Building insulation|Insulation]] may be provided beneath the membrane. The thickness of insulation is determined by building code requirements as well as performance requirements set out by the architect.

The system is a form of double-wall construction that uses an outer layer to keep out the rain and an inner layer to provide thermal insulation, prevent excessive air leakage and carry wind loading. The outer layer breathes like a skin while the inner layer reduces energy losses. The structural frame of the building is kept absolutely dry, as water never reaches it or the thermal insulation. Evaporation and drainage in the cavity removes water that penetrates between panel joints. Water droplets are not driven through the panel joints or openings because the rainscreen principle means that wind pressure acting on the outer face of the panel is equalized in the cavity. Therefore, there is no significant pressure differential to drive the rain through joints. During extreme weather, a minimal amount of water may penetrate the outer cladding. This, however, will run as droplets down the back of the cladding sheets and be dissipated through evaporation and drainage.

==The rainscreen drainage plane==
[[Image:Rainscreen layersbw.png|thumb|Typical layers in a wall system with rainscreen drainage plane]] 
A '''rainscreen drainage plane''' is a separation between the veneer and the weather resistant barrier of a rainscreen. It provides predictable, unobstructed path drainage for liquid moisture to drain from a high point of the wall (where it enters) to a low point of the wall (where it exits) the wall detail. The drainage plane must move the water out of the wall system quickly to prevent absorption and consequential rot, mold, and structural degradation.

A drainage plane 
&lt;blockquote&gt;is designed to shed bulk rainwater and/or condensation downward and outward in a manner that will prevent uncontrolled water penetration into the conditioned spaces of a building or structure. In a barrier wall system, the exterior cladding also serves as the principal drainage plane and primary line of defense against bulk rainwater penetration. In cavity wall construction, however, the principal drainage plane and primary line of defense against bulk rainwater penetration is located inside the wall cavity, generally on the inboard side of the air space (either directly applied to the outboard surface of the exterior sheathing layer or, in the case of insulated cavity walls, on the outboard surface of the rigid or otherwise moisture-impervious insulation layer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Building Envelope Design Guide - Wall Systems|date=January 2007|work=Whole Building Design Guide|accessdate=March 1, 2009|url=http://www.wbdg.org/design/env_wall.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===A predictable pressure equalization plane===
Air pressure difference is one of the dominant forces for driving a rainwater into wall systems.&lt;ref name="ctu"&gt;Pressure Equalization in Rainscreen Wall Systems (July 1998). In Construction Technology Update. Retrieved March 1, 2009 from {{cite web |url=http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/pubs/ctus/17_e.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228220815/http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/pubs/ctus/17_e.html |archivedate=2009-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A rainscreen drainage plane that works as a predictable pressure equalization plane creates a separation (an air chamber) between the backside of a rainscreen and the exterior surface of the weather-resistant barrier that is installed on the exterior sheeting of the structural back up wall. This separation allows air contaminated with water vapor from all points in that wall system to exit the interior of the wall system. Moisture laden air that is allowed to pressurize will attempt to move to a lower pressure area that may be deeper into the interior of a wall detail.

===Technical considerations===
*To prevent '''bridging''' due to [[capillary action]], Building Science Consulting recommends the drainage plane maintain a cavity of &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;" or greater, though smaller cavities with hydrophobic materials can also provide the capillary break.&lt;ref&gt;BSD-013: Rain Control in Buildings (September 2008).

Masonry Technology Incorporated. Retrieved March 1, 2009 from http://www.mtidry.com/testing/about_time.php&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ensure that the drainage plane does not compress when installed so that it maintains an acceptable air space.
*Similarly, ensure that the drainage plane isn't plugged by debris which commonly is present in the form of mortar squeezings or excess stucco. Some mechanical drainage planes include measures to prevent clogging.
*Ensure that the drainage plane creates a compartmentalized pressure equalization plane to prevent pressure driven moisture intrusion.&lt;ref name="ctu" /&gt;
*Details at top and bottom terminations of a wall system should accommodate moisture drainage (often termed "'''weeping'''") and air flow to properly dry out the wall.
*ASTM International Standards include  a standard test for drainage plane systems in [[Exterior insulation finishing system|EIFS]] Systems under code '''ASTM E2273'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Standard Test Method for Determining the Drainage Efficiency of Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems (EIFS) Clad Wall Assemblies|url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/E2273.htm|website=ASTM International|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the International Code Council features a more general "Evaluation guideline for a moisture drainage system used with exterior wall veneers" under code '''ICC-ES EG356'''.
*Inappropriate rain screen materials may also introduce a risk of fast-spreading external fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fire Risks From External Cladding Panels – A Perspective From The UK|url=http://www.probyn-miers.com/perspective/2016/02/fire-risks-from-external-cladding-panels-perspective-from-the-uk/|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entrapped moisture risks===
Once moisture has penetrated deep into a wall system through the weather resistant barrier and into the exterior sheathing, the wall is deep wet. The air flow that exists in most wall systems is a slight draft that will not dry this condition out in a timely manner. The result is a compromised wall system with rot, rust, and mold potential. The structural integrity of the wall is at stake, as is the health of the occupants. The longer the wall remains wet, the greater the risk.  50% percent of homes suffer from mold problems.&lt;ref&gt;Mold Occurrence Influenced By Building Inspection Practice (January 2005) Dr. Richard A. Wolfe. Construction News &amp; Articles. Retrieved March 1, 2009 from http://www.greatpossibilities.com/articles/publish/mold.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Billions of dollars are spent annually on litigation involving mold and rot problems stemming from entrapped moisture; this has created an entire industry centered around construction litigation. Such litigation has caused insurance premiums for contractors to increase significantly and has made it difficult for contractors involved in moisture related lawsuits to obtain insurance at all.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rics.org/NR/rdonlyres/81485882-20E6-4408-A4D0-61FC8D6C1D3A/0/Grosskopf.pdf{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Identifying the Causes of Moisture-Related Defect Litigation in U.S.

====Danger levels====
[[Image:Moisture graph.png|thumb|Wood Moisture Equivalent Graph]] Dampness levels in construction are measured in '''wood moisture equivalent''' (WME) percentages and is calculated as follows:

Retrieved March 1, 2009 from http://www.domosystem.fr/en/faq/moisture-measurement-1/wood-moisture-equivalent-hbe-2&lt;/ref&gt;

A normal range is 8–13% WME, with fungal growth beginning at the 16% threshold. A 20% WME is enough to promote wood rot.&lt;ref&gt;Moisture Testing. Built Environments. Retrieved March 1, 2009 from http://www.built-environments.com/moisture.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It logically follows that the more time a part of a wall system exceeds one of these thresholds the greater chance of damage from fungal growth or rot.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2386">'''Roughness length''' (&lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt;) is a [[parameter]] of some vertical wind profile equations that model the horizontal mean wind speed near the ground; in the [[log wind profile]], it is equivalent to the height at which the wind speed theoretically becomes zero. In reality the wind at this height no longer follows a mathematical logarithm. It is so named because it is typically related to the height of terrain roughness elements. Whilst it is not a physical length, it can be considered as a length-scale representation of the roughness of the surface.

==Application==
As an approximation, the roughness length is approximately one-tenth of the height of the surface roughness elements. For example, short grass of height 0.01m has a roughness length of approximately 0.001m. Surfaces are rougher if they have more protrusions. Forests have much larger roughness lengths than tundra, for example. Roughness length is an important concept in [[urban meteorology]] as the building of tall structures, such as skyscrapers, has an effect on roughness length and wind patterns.

{{Distinguish|Sanitation engineering}}
'''Sanitary engineering''', also known as '''public health engineering''', is the application of engineering methods to improve [[sanitation]] of human communities, primarily by providing the removal and disposal of human waste, and in addition to the supply of safe [[potable water]]. Traditionally a branch of civil engineering, in the mid-19th century, the discipline concentrated on the reduction of disease, then thought to be caused by [[Miasma theory|miasma]]. This was accomplished mainly by the collection and segregation of sewerage flow in [[London]] specifically, and Great Britain generally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-sul.stanford.edu/depts/hasrg/ablit/britlit/sanitary.html Sanitary Reform of London], The Working Collection of [[Sir Joseph Bazalgette]], British and Commonwealth Literary Studies, [[Green Library]], [[Stanford University]]&lt;/ref&gt;  These and later regulatory improvements were reported in the United States as early as 1865.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/31/news/european-sanitary-reform-the-british-sanitary-legislation.html EUROPEAN SANITARY REFORM.; The British Sanitary Legislation], [[The New York Times]], July 31, 1865&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is not concerned with environmental factors that do not have an immediate and clearly understood effect on public health.  Areas outside the purview of sanitary engineering include [[traffic]] management, concerns about [[noise pollution]] or [[light pollution]], aesthetic concerns such as [[landscaping]], and [[environmental conservation]] as it pertains to [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s.

Skills within this field are usually employed for the primary goal of [[disease]] prevention within [[human beings]] by assuring a supply of healthy [[drinking water]], treatment of waste water, removing [[Waste|garbage]] from inhabited areas, and so on.

Compared to (for example) [[electrical engineering]] or [[mechanical engineering]] which are concerned primarily with [[closed system]]s, sanitary engineering is a very [[interdisciplinary]] field which may involve such elements as [[hydraulics]], constructive modelling, [[information technology]], project design, [[microbiology]], [[pathology]] and the many divisions within [[environmental science]] and [[environmental technology]].  In some cases, considerations that fall within the field of [[social sciences]] and urban planning must be factored in as well.

Although sanitary engineering may be most associated with the design of [[sanitary sewer|sewers]], [[sewage treatment]] and [[waste water treatment]] facilities, [[recycling]] centers, [[landfill|public landfills]] and other things which are constructed, the term applies equally to (for example) a plan of action to reverse the effects of [[water pollution]] or [[soil contamination]] in a specific area.

==History==
{{Further information|History of water supply and sanitation}}
Irrigation systems were invented five to seven thousand years ago as a means of supplying water to agriculture-based societies. Aqueducts and irrigation systems were among the first forms of wastewater engineering.  As population centers became more dense, they were used to remove sewage from settlements. The Romans were among the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of the aqueduct.  The Dark Ages marked a period where progress in water management came to a halt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steinbeck|first1=SG|title=An Abridged History of  Onsite Wastewater: Early Years to Present|url=http://ehs.ncpublichealth.com/oet/docs/cit/oswpmod/HistoryOfOSWW.pdf|website=REHS Onsite Water Protection Branch|publisher=Environmental Health Section, Division of Public Health, NC Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=April 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As populations grew, the management of human waste became a growing concern and a public health threat.  By the 1850s in London more than 400,000 tons of sewage were flushed into the Thames River each day - around 150 million tons a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London's Victorian sewer system|url=http://www.thameswater.co.uk/about-us/10092.htm|website=Thames Water|publisher=Tames Water|accessdate=April 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diseases such as smallpox, diphtheria, measles, scarlet fever, typhus, cholera and typhoid  were spread via the contaminated water supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hardy|first1=Anne|title=Water and the Search for Public Health in London in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries|journal=Medical History|date=1984|volume=28|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1139446/pdf/medhist00078-0028.pdf|pmc=1139446|pmid=6390024|pages=250–82|doi=10.1017/s0025727300035936}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century major cities started building sewage systems to remove human waste out of cities and into rivers.

During the 1900s the activated sludge process was invented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matsuo|first1=Tomonori|title=Civil Engineering Vol. I|url=http://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c05/E6-37-01-03.pdf|website=Wastewater Management Engineering|publisher=Encyclodedia of Life Support Systems|accessdate=April 3, 2015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The activated sludge process is a form of water purification that uses bacteria to consume human feces.  Chlorine is used to kill off the bacteria.

Over the centuries much has changed in the field of wastewater engineering. Advancements in microbiology, chemistry, and engineering have drastically changed the field. Today wastewater engineers work on the collection of clean water for drinking, chemically treating it, and using UV light to kill off micro-organisms. They also treat [[Water Pollution]] in wastewater (blackwater and greywater) so that this water may be made safe for use without endangering the population and environment around it.

==Municipalities==
Generally, sanitary engineers work for municipalities and are highly trained professionals with a diverse range of engineering skills.  Some are involved with a specific area of concern such as [[waste collection]] or the maintenance of [[waste water]] facilities and  [[storm water]] [[drainage]] systems within a district.

Others cover a broader scope of activities that might include the two just listed as well as such maintenance of the public [[water supply]], collection of residential yard waste program, disposal of  [[hazardous waste]], recycling strategies and even community programs where individuals or businesses "adopt" an area and either maintain it themselves or donate funds for doing so.

==Wastewater==
'''Wastewater engineering''' is not usually its own degree course but a specialization from degrees such as [[civil engineering]], [[environmental engineering]], Bio-chemical engineering or [[chemical engineering]]. Wastewater engineering deals with the transportation and cleaning of [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]], [[greywater]], and irrigation water. [[Wastewater treatment]] and [[water reclamation]] are areas of concern in this field.

Wastewater engineers map out topographical and geographical features of Earth to determine the best means of collection, design pipe and pumped collection systems, and design treatment processes for collected wastewater.

===Job description and typical tasks===
Wastewater engineers use a variety of skills and must have knowledge of  mechanical and environmental engineering. They are required to perform tasks and demonstrate knowledge in design, mathematics, English, construction, physics, chemistry, biology, management, and personnel. Wastewater engineers must have skills in complex problem solving, critical thinking, mathematics, active listening, judgement, reading comprehension, speaking, writing, science, and system analysis.&lt;ref name=Onet&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary Report for: 17-2081.01 - Water/Wastewater Engineers|url=http://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/17-2081.01|website=O*net Online|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical work activities include problem solving, communication with management and staff, gathering information, analyzing data, evaluating standards and complying with them, and communicating with others in the field.

Wastewater engineers perform these activities by combining their knowledge and skills to perform tasks. These tasks are to understand computer-aided design programs, and to conduct studies for the  construction of facilities, water supply systems and collection systems.  They may design systems for wastewater collection machinery, as well as system components.  They may perform water flow analysis, then select designs and equipment based on government and industry standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fairfax County Department of Human Resources|title=Wastewater Plant Operations Manager Classification Specification|url=http://agency.governmentjobs.com/fairfaxcounty/default.cfm?action=viewclassspec&amp;classSpecID=969985&amp;viewOnly=yes|website=Fairfax County Classifications|publisher=Fairfax County, VA|accessdate=March 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Typical employers===
Wastewater engineers work for private companies, state and local governments, and special districts. As of 2012 there were 53,000 wastewater engineers employed in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bureau of Labor Statistics|title=Water and Wastewater Treatment Plant and System Operators|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/production/water-and-wastewater-treatment-plant-and-system-operators.htm|website=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2014-15 Edition|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=March 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern challenges: climate change===
Today the wastewater managers confront new challenges and the need for new technology as water levels decrease due to increasingly frequent and extended droughts. Technologies such as sonar mapping are being used in wells to determine the volume of water that they can hold. For example, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the State of New York worked together to map underground aquifers since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ground Water Resource Mapping|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/36118.html|website=New York State Department of Resource Conservation|publisher=State of New York|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today they have thorough maps of these aquifers to assist in water management.

Wastewater treatment contributes to global warming in many ways. One of the factors that contributes to global warming is wastewater treatment facilities and their emissions of greenhouse gases. Some of those gases are carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. These gases occur because of the decomposition of organic material from the anaerobic bacteria. These bacteria clean the leftover waste. Even if the anaerobic bacteria decomposition produces these gases, the percentage of greenhouse gases that other equipment produce is still greater than the contribution of the anaerobic bacteria. Also, the power usage from those machinery is very high. That is why many facilities are undergoing renovation to use higher levels of anaerobic bacteria compared to other types of equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cakir|first1=FY|title=Greenhouse gas production: A comparison between aerobic and anaerobic wastewater treatment technology|journal=Water Research|date=September 26, 2005|volume=39|issue=17|pages=4197–4203|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2005.07.042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[effects of global warming]] on waste water treatment facilities vary from location to location. In the Northeast there has been increased rainfall causing treatment plants to be too small relative to the amount coming in. In the West there is a lack of rainfall and water sources are being depleted. This means the facilities will need to be updated to meet modern and future environmental changes such as the increased use of recycled and [[reclaimed water]] Climate change also affects piping and increases the rate of corrosion, adding to facility cost.

Desalination plants may be required in the future for those regions hardest hit by [[water scarcity]]. Desalination is a process of cleaning water by means of evaporation. Water is evaporated and it passes through membranes. The water is then cooled and condenses allowing it to flow either back into the main water line or out to sea. Desalination is not completely "green" since the plants require energy to run and due to the fact that the brine waste must managed to avoid ecological damage to the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lattemann|first1=Sabine|title=Environmental impact and impact assessment of seawater desalination|journal=Desalination|date=2008|volume=220|issue=1|pages=1–15|accessdate=April 20, 2015
|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Th_Hoepner/publication/222564177_Environmental_impact_and_impact_assessment_of_seawater_desalination/links/54129baa0cf2bb7347daecf2.pdf||display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/j.desal.2007.03.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education necessary for the job===
Formal education for wastewater engineers begins in high school with students taking classes such as chemistry, biology, physics, and higher mathematics including calculus. After high school most jobs require certification from a state agency. Those wanting to advance in the industry should pursue a civil engineering, [[mechanical engineering]], environmental engineering, or a [[facilities engineering]] degree. Gaining experience through internships and working while in college is a common pathway toward advancement.

Education about waste treatment requires course work in systems design, machinery design principles, water chemistry, and similar coursework. Other classes may include Chemistry of Plant Processes, and various plant operations courses.

Initial employment in wastewater engineering can be obtained by those with and without advanced formal education. The California State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB), for example, shows how individuals can advance through a progression of certifications as Waste Water Treatment Operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=California Environmental Protection Agency|title=Operator Certification Requirements TABLE|url=http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/operator_certification/docs/ocr_table.pdf|website=State Water Resources Control Board|publisher=State of California|accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Board uses a five level classification system to classify
water treatment facilities into categories I-V according to the population served
and the complexity of the treatment system.

The Operator Certification requirements for water treatment operators and waste water treatment operators are described in detail by State law. To meet certification requirements, operators must submit an application to SWRCB, have the necessary work experience, meet the educational requirements, and pass an examination based on the knowledge, skill,and abilities described in the regulations. Operators are required to renew their certificates every three years.  To be elibible for renewal, certified operators must complete a specified number of continuing education hours after the previous issuance of a certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wastewater Treatment Plant Classification, Operator Certification, and Contract Operator Registration |url=http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/operator_certification/docs/ocr_clean.pdf|website=State Water Resources Control Board|publisher=State of California|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wastewater engineers may advance in their careers through additional education and experience. With additional knowledge and experience one can become the manager of an entire plant. The accreditation body certifying the education for the degree and license is the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET).  Over time some companies may require the wastewater engineer to continue their education to keep up with any changes in technology.

Obtaining one’s master's degree is encouraged since many companies list it as a preference in selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental Engineer|url=http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-engineering-careers/engineering/environmental-engineer#education|website=Science Buddies|publisher=Science Buddies, Inc.|accessdate=March 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental Engineer: Career Profile|url=http://study.com/articles/Environmental_Engineer_Career_Profile.html|website=Study.com|publisher=Study.com, Mountain View, CA|accessdate=March 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this field 76 percent of those employed have a bachelor's degree, 17 percent have a master's degree and three percent have a post-doctoral degree as of 2013.&lt;ref name="Onet"/&gt;  The average annual salary is approximately $83,360.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wages and Employment Trends|url=http://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/17-2081.01#WagesEmployment|website=Onetonline.org|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GCDickens-one-man-show.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gerald Charles Dickens (actor)|Gerald Dickens]] in solo performance of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'']]
A '''solo performance''', sometimes referred to as a '''one-man show''' or '''one-woman show''', features a single person telling a story for an audience, typically for the purpose of entertainment. This type of performance comes in many varieties, including autobiographical creations, comedy acts, novel adaptations, vaudeville, poetry, music, and dance.&lt;ref name="ExtAnth"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://users.erols.com/jobonney/index.htm|title=Extreme Exposure: An Anthology of Solo Performance Texts from the Twentieth Century|last=Bonney|first=Jo|author2=Anthology|date=1 February 1999|publisher=Theatre Communications Group; 1st edition|isbn=1-55936-155-7|editor=Jo Bonney|edition=1st|pages=450|chapter=preface xiii|accessdate=28 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traits of solo performance ==
Solo performance is used to encompass the broad term of a single person performing for an audience. Some key traits of solo performance can include the lack of the [[fourth wall]] and audience participation or involvement. Solo performance does not need to be written, performed, and produced by a single person-- a solo performance production may utilize directors, writers, designers, and composers to bring the piece to life on a stage. An example of this collaboration is [[Eric Bogosian]] in the published version of his show ''Wake Up And Smell the Coffee'', by [[Theatre Communications Group]], [[New York City]]. &lt;ref&gt;Bonney, Jo. ''Extreme Exposure: an Anthology of Solo Performance Texts from the Twentieth Century''. Theatre Communications Group, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It is assumed that individuals have told stories in front of other members of their tribe or society for thousands of years. They would have [[Speech communication|orally]] passed down many of today's [[Mythology|myths]] and [[legend]]s in this manner.&lt;ref name="ExtAnth" /&gt; So it is a style of performance that has been with us for generations developing through theatrical people such as [[Greek people|Greek]] [[Monologists]], the strolling [[Minstrels]] of [[Medieval England]] and the French [[Troubadors]].

[[Edgar Allan Poe]] both lectured and recited poetry as a platform performer between 1843 and 1849; his performances stand as a paradigm of the solo performance hybrid simply called "the lecture-recital". The reading tours of [[Charles Dickens]] in Britain and America between 1858 and 1870 created a sensation. His American tour of 1867–68 was unparalleled until the arrival of the Beatles in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gentile|first=John S. |year=1989|title= Cast of One. One-Person Shows from the Chautauqua Platform to the Broadway Stage| publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]| isbn=978-0252015847 |pages= 10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solo performance enjoyed an unprecedented artistic and commercial vogue in the United States during the second half of the nineteenth century (John S. Gentile Calls it the golden age of platform performance). Literary historians often associate the [[Victorian era|Victorian period]] with the highest development of the dramatic monologue as a poetic form. There were several discussions about the importance and distinction between the literary monologue and the performance monologue during the nineteenth century, however, this discussions confirms a continuous interchange between literature and performance, which may at times appear competitive but is more often productive. By the time the United States entered the 20th century, the number and variety of professional solo performances presented throughout the country had grown large.&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, pages 61–64.&lt;/ref&gt; This renaissance of solo performance also created ripples in the larger sense of American theatre; after this "boom" of the one man show had passed, the presentational style seeped into popular theatre productions such as ''Amadeus'', ''Equus'', and ''Evita'' among others, modeling a combination of representational theatricality and presentational, direct-address style.&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, pages 194–195.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s, the term [[performance art]] became popular and involved any number of performance acts or [[happenings]], as they were known. Many performers, like [[Laurie Anderson]], developed through these happenings and are still performing today.

==Types and Examples of Solo Performance ==
The backgrounds of solo performers over the decades range from [[vaudeville]], comedy, poetry, music, the [[visual arts]], [[magic (illusion)|magic]], [[cabaret]], [[theatre]] and [[dance]].&lt;ref name="ExtAnth" /&gt;

Solo performers include [[Lily Tomlin]], [[Andy Kaufman]], Rod Maxwell, [[Lord Buckley]], [[Eric Bogosian]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Jade Esteban Estrada]], [[Eddie Izzard]], [[John Leguizamo]], [[Marga Gomez]], [[Anna Deavere Smith]], [[Bill Hicks]], [[Brother Blue]] and [[Lenny Bruce]].&lt;ref name="ExtAnth" /&gt;

Several performers have presented solo shows in tribute to famous personalities. The blueprint for this type of show may have been drafted by [[Hal Holbrook]], who has performed as [[Mark Twain]] in his solo show, ''[[Mark Twain Tonight]]'', more than 2,000 times since 1954. Examples since that time include [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]] in the [[Emily Dickinson]] biography, ''[[The Belle of Amherst]]''; [[Tovah Feldshuh]] as Golda Meir in ''[[Golda's Balcony]]''; [[Frank Gorshin]] as [[George Burns]] in ''[[Say Goodnight, Gracie|Say Goodnight Gracie]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=13425 Ibdb.com]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Rupert Holmes]]; [[Ed Metzger]] in his solo show, performing since 1978, ''[[Albert Einstein: The Practical Bohemian]]''; Metzger in another solo performance, ''[[Hemingway: On the Edge]]''; [[Henry Fonda]] as [[Clarence Darrow]] in ''Darrow'', and [[Tom Dugan (American actor)|Tom Dugan]] as [[Simon Wiesenthal]] in ''Wiesenthal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=Stoudt, Charlotte|title=Theater review: 'Nazi Hunter – Simon Wiesenthal' at Theatre 40|date=26 May 2011|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2011/05/theater-review-nazi-hunter-simon-wiesenthal-at-theatre-40.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few actors adapted entire novels for the stage including [[Patrick Stewart]] who played all 43 parts in his version of ''[[A Christmas Carol (play)|A Christmas Carol]]'', which played three times on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and at[[The Old Vic]] in [[London]]; actor [[Gerald Charles Dickens (actor)|Gerald Charles Dickens]] played 26 characters in his performances from the same work; and [[Jack Aranson]] starred in a solo, 13-character production of ''[[Moby Dick]]''.

Solo performance may be personal, autobiographical creations. This ranges from the intensely confessional but comedic work of [[Spalding Gray]], the semi-autobiographical ''[[A Bronx Tale (play)|A Bronx Tale]]'' by [[Chaz Palminteri]], or [[Holly Hughes (performance artist)|Holly Hughes]]' solo piece ''World without End,'' in which she attempts to make sense of her relationship with her mother who had died. Another example of this is ''In The Body of the World,'' written and performed by [[Eve Ensler]] in 2018.

Still other shows may rally around a central theme, such as pop culture in Pat Hazel's ''The Wonderbread Years'', relationships in Robert Dubac's ''The Male Intellect'', the history of the New York City transit system in [[Mike Daisey]]'s ''Invincible Summer'', or fighting the system in [[Patrick Combs]]' ''Man 1, Bank 0''. these themes could also be centered around a certain topic such as a political or social issue.&lt;ref name="ExtAnth" /&gt; [[Tim Miller (performance artist)|Tim Miller]] explores the topic of gay culture and society surrounding the LGBTQ community in his production of ''My Queer Body''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hemisphericinstitute.org/hemi/en/modules/item/2636-tim-miller-body|title=My Queer Body (1992)|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karen Finley]] expressed her frustration with the standards women are held to and the issues surrounding them such as rape and abortion in her solo piece titled ''We Keep Our Victims Ready''.&lt;ref&gt;Neely, Kent. "Theatre Journal." ''Theatre Journal'', vol. 42, no. 4, 1990, pp. 495–497. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/3207728.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, solo shows are simply traditional plays written by playwrights for a cast of one. Examples: ''[[Shirley Valentine]]'' by [[Willy Russell]], ''[[I Am My Own Wife]]'' by [[Doug Wright]], ''[[The Blonde, the Brunette and the Vengeful Redhead]]'' by Robert Hewett and ''[[Topless (stage play)|Topless]]'' by [[Miles Tredinnick]]. A performer of shows of this type is [[Chris Harris (actor)|Chris Harris]], whose performances in the genre include ''Kemp's Jig'', ''That's The Way To Do It!'', ''[[Ally Sloper's Half Holiday]]'', ''Beemaster'', '''Arris Music 'All'' and ''A Night at the Pantomime''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chris Harris|work=Chrisharrisproductions.co.uk|url=http://www.chrisharrisproductions.co.uk/one%20man%20shows.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been many British comedians who have moved away from performing pure stand-up comedy in recent years. The shows that appear annually at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] can involve stories of [[pathos]] and the use of technological equipment such as [[Image projector|projector]]s. Examples include [[Howard Read]], who has performed with the animated character [[Little Howard]] which was projected with the aid of computers and [[Dave Gorman]], who has performed several shows described as "documentary comedy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hudson|first=Ben|title=Dead Funny: Posthumous liveness in mediatized stand-up comedy performance.|url=https://www.academia.edu/7110762/Dead_Funny_Posthumous_liveness_in_mediatized_stand-up_comedy_performance|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solo performance in Film==
The First full-length talking film who showed only a single character was Sofi, a 1968 film starring [[Tom Troupe]]. The film was based on "[[Diary of a Madman (short story)|Diary of a Madman]]" by [[Gogol]].
In the [[21st century]] the "solo performance" had a rejuvenation period. with films like [[Locke (film)|Locke]], [[All Is Lost]] and [[Buried (film)|Buried]]. The characteristics were different from the previous one character films that were made - mainly by location and style. Sofi and works like [[Give 'em Hell, Harry!]], were still studio filmed theater pieces. The 21th century films were mostly shot on location and were much more stylized with their cinematic expression and camera usage. Most recently films by [[Marcus Tell]] showed ongoing characteristics of one character films. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/list/ls059718934/|title=One actor movies|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Microphone and cover.JPG|thumb|Microphone covers are occasionally used to improve sound quality by reducing noise from wind.]]
'''Sound quality''' is typically an assessment of the accuracy, enjoyability, or intelligibility of [[sound|audio]] output from an electronic device. Quality can be measured objectively, such as when tools are used to gauge the accuracy with which the device reproduces an original sound;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teamaudionutz.com/tutorial/27/What_is_Sound_Quality_and_How_is_it_Judged|title=What is Sound Quality and How is it Judged {{!}} Tutorials {{!}} Team Audionutz|website=www.teamaudionutz.com|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; or it can be measured subjectively, such as when human listeners respond to the sound or gauge its ''perceived'' similarity to another sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Sound/timbre.html|title=Sound Quality or Timbre|website=hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sound quality of a reproduction or recording depends on a number of factors, including the equipment used to make it,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/131462-quality-of-sound-and-the-tech-behind-it-what-to-look-for-when-choosing-a-speaker|title=Quality of sound and the tech behind it: What to look for when choosing a speaker - Pocket-lint|website=www.pocket-lint.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; processing and mastering done to the recording, the equipment used to reproduce it, as well as the listening environment used to reproduce it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.passmyexams.co.uk/GCSE/physics/pitch-loudness-quality-of-musical-notes.html|title=Pitch, Loudness and Quality of Musical Notes - Pass My Exams: Easy exam revision notes for GSCE Physics|website=www.passmyexams.co.uk|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, processing such as [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]], [[dynamic range compression]] or [[3D audio effect|stereo processing]] may be applied to a recording to create audio that is significantly different from the original but may be perceived as more agreeable to a listener.  In other cases, the goal may be to reproduce audio as closely as possible to the original.

When applied to specific electronic devices, such as [[loudspeakers]], [[microphones]], [[amplifiers]] or [[headphones]] sound quality usually refers to accuracy, with higher quality devices providing higher accuracy reproduction.  When applied to processing steps such as [[Audio mastering|mastering]] recordings, absolute accuracy may be secondary to artistic or aesthetic concerns.  In still other situations, such as recording a live musical performance, audio quality may refer to proper placement of microphones around a room to optimally use [[room acoustics]].

==Digital Audio==
{{see also|Digital audio|Audio codec}}

Digital audio is stored in many formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nch.com.au/acm/formats.html|title=File Formats|website=www.nch.com.au|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest form is [[Pulse-code modulation|uncompressed PCM]], where audio is stored as a series of [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantized]] audio samples spaced at regular intervals in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/pulse-code-modulation-PCM|title=What is pulse code modulation (PCM)? - Definition from WhatIs.com|work=SearchNetworking|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As samples are placed closer together in time, higher frequencies can be reproduced.  According to the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem|sampling theorem]], any bandwidth-limited signal (that does not contain a  pure sinusoidal component), [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] B, can be perfectly described by more than 2B samples per second, allowing [http://www.xiph.org/video/vid2.shtml perfect reconstruction] of the bandwidth-limited analog signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dspguide.com/ch3/2.htm|title=The Sampling Theorem|website=www.dspguide.com|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, for human hearing bandwidth between 0 and 20&amp;nbsp;kHz, audio must be sampled at above 40&amp;nbsp;kHz. Due to the need for filtering out ultrasonic frequencies resulting from the conversion to an analog signal, in practice slightly higher sample rates are used: 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz ([[Compact Disc|CD audio]]) or 48&amp;nbsp;kHz ([[DVD-Video|DVD]]).

In PCM, each audio sample describes the sound pressure at an instant in time with a limited precision.  The limited accuracy results in [[quantization error]], a form of noise that is added to the recording.  To reduce quantization error, more precision can be used in each measurement at the expense of larger samples (see [[audio bit depth]]).  With each additional [[bit]] added to a sample, quantization error is reduced by approximately 6 [[Decibels|dB]].  For example, CD audio uses 16 bits per sample, and therefore will have quantization noise approximately 96 dB below the maximum possible sound pressure level (when summed over the full bandwidth)

The amount of space required to store PCM depends on the number of bits per sample, the number of samples per second, and the number of channels.  For CD audio, this is 44,100 samples per second, 16 bits per sample, and 2 channels for stereo audio leading to 1,411,200 bits per second.  However, this space can be greatly reduced using [[Audio compression (data)#Audio|audio compression]].  In audio compression, audio samples are processed using an [[audio codec]].  In a [[lossless codec]] audio samples are processed without discarding information by packing repetitive or redundant samples into a more efficiently stored form.  A lossless decoder then reproduces the original PCM with no change in quality.  Lossless audio compression typically achieves a 30-50% reduction in file size.  Common lossless audio codecs include [[FLAC]], [[Apple Lossless|ALAC]], [[Monkey's Audio]] and others.

If additional compression is required, [[Lossy audio compression#Lossy audio compression|lossy audio compression]] such as [[MP3]], [[Ogg Vorbis]] or [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] can be used.  In these techniques, lossless compression techniques are enhanced by processing audio to reduce the precision of details that are unlikely or impossible for human hearing to perceive using principles from [[Psychoacoustics]].  After the removal of these details, [[lossy compression]] can be applied to the remainder to greatly reduce the file size.  Lossy audio compression therefore allows a 75-95% reduction in file size, but runs the risk of potentially reducing audio quality if important information is mistakenly discarded

'''Tagundaing''' ({{lang-my|တံခွန်တိုင်}}) refers to an ornamented [[victory column]] or [[Flag#Flagpoles|flagstaff]], typically {{convert|60|to|80|ft}}, found within the grounds of [[Buddhism in Burma|Burmese Buddhist]] [[pagoda]]s and [[kyaung]]s (monasteries).&lt;ref name="niu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niu.edu/burma/collections/art/sculptures/sculpture_38.shtml|title=Tagundaing|work=Burma Collections|publisher=Center for Burma Studies, Northern Illinois University|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ferrars"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferrars|first=Max|author2=Bertha Ferrars |title=Burma|publisher=S. Low, Marston &amp; Company|year=1900|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ornamented columns were raised within religious compounds to celebrate the submission of [[nat (spirit)|nats]] (local animistic spirits) to the [[Dharma#Buddhism|Dhamma]], the Buddhist doctrine and inspired by the [[Pillars of Ashoka]].&lt;ref name="niu"/&gt;

A mythical [[Hamsa (bird)|hintha]] (or more rarely a [[kinnara]]) is generally found perching atop the column, while the base of the column may be decorated with [[Thagyamin]].&lt;ref name="niu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ferrars"/&gt; [[Vasudhara]], the earth goddess, may also be found at the base.&lt;ref name="niu"/&gt;

'''''The Erotic Review''''', also functioning as '''TheEroticReview.com''', is a [[review site]] that ostensibly presents clients' assessments of their experiences with [[sex workers]] (referred to as "providers" on the website).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://nymag.com/news/features/sex/2012/johns-and-escorts-mixer/

==History==
The service was first launched in 1999 by David Elms, who came up with the idea after having what he described as a "bad encounter" with a [[call girl]].&lt;ref name="RFT"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.riverfronttimes.com/2008-06-04/news/oldest-profession-2-0-a-new-generation-of-local-providers-and-hobbyists-create-a-virtual-red-light-district/

''The Erotic Review'' website was acquired by Treehouse Park in 2004.&lt;ref name=leaves&gt;{{cite web|last=Duncan|first=Edward|title=Troubled Elms Leaves Erotic Review|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/technology/Troubled-Elms-Leaves-Erotic-Review-306112.html|publisher=AVN|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Madrigal|first=Alexis|title=Johns Help Each Other Find the Right 'Internet Sex Provider'|url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2008/03/internet_johns|publisher=Wired|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 6, 2018, the U.S. Congress passed the [[Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act#FOSTA-SESTA Package|Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act]]; following this and the FBI shutting down [[Backpage]] and other websites promoting or facilitating in prostitution, The Erotic Review blocked access to its site from the United States, though can still be accessed in the United States via a [[Virtual private network|VPN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/04/erotic-review-blocks-us-internet-users-to-prepare-for-government-crackdown/|title="Erotic Review" blocks US Internet users to prepare for government crackdown – Ars Technica|work=[[Ars Technica]]|date=2018-04-09|accessdate=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, 2018, The Erotic Review was mentioned in a superseding indictment filed by the government against Backpage.com. The superseding indictment alleges that Backpage and The Erotic Review had a reciprocal link agreement, where both parties allowed ads to be posted on their sites. The indictment alleges that Backpage paid “tens of thousands” of dollars to The Erotic Review for this agreement. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/amp/Technology/wireStory/indictment-levels-charges-backpage-officials-56874244|title=Indictment levels new charges against Backpage.com officials - ABC News|work=[[ABC News]]|date=2018-07-27|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4618737-Indictment-Superseding.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content and readership==
A 2008 ''[[River Front Times]]'' article features Elms commenting that the average site-user was "between 35 and 55 years old with a median income of $80,000".&lt;ref name="RFT" /&gt;

''The Erotic Review'' hosts reviews for over 90 cities around the world.&lt;ref name=leaves/&gt; The site offers both a free and paid membership. Free members can access site features such as the [[discussion boards]] and a limited search function. Paid members have additional features such as the ability to access complete reviews and a search page that allows the user to search based on various criteria such as physical attributes.

==Criticism==
The site has been met with criticism, most of which centered upon its founder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grant|first=Melissa Gira|title=Online critics accuse TheEroticReview.com CEO Dave Elms of rape|url=http://gawker.com/389612/online-critics-accuse-theeroticreviewcom-ceo-dave-elms-of-rape|publisher=Gawker|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics have claimed that Elms has accepted bribes to promote certain agencies or call girls and has pressured others into providing sexual favors.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Richtel|first=Matt|title=Prostitution Site Cuts Ties With Founder After Charges|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/04/prostitution-site-cuts-ties-with-founder-after-charges/|accessdate=9 July 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have made claims of Elms threatening them with bodily harm for criticizing the site or refusing to provide sexual services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bergen|first=Jennifer|title=Prostitution Review Site Breaks Up with Founder|url=http://appscout.pcmag.com/news-events/273448-prostitution-review-site-breaks-up-with-founder|publisher=PC Mag|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nix|first=Denise|title=Prostitution king sought|url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/news/ci_11989964|publisher=Daily Breeze|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elms denied the claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Sex Trade Monitors a Key Figure’s Woes | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = June 17, 2008 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/17/us/17erotic.html | first=Matt | last=Richtel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have expressed "frustration" over the company's association with law enforcement, stating that the site should be warning escorts and/or users if someone is a police officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10896432/

''The Erotic Review'' distanced itself from Elms in 2009 and cut ties with him after Elms was arrested in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], for hiring a [[hit man]] to assault a business rival, and was sentenced to four and a half years in prison that same year.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

{{For|other types of typology|Typology (disambiguation)}}


'''Typology''' (in urban planning and architecture) is the [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] classification of (usually physical) characteristics commonly found in buildings and urban places, according to their association with different categories, such as intensity of development (from natural or rural to highly urban), degrees of formality, and school of thought (for example, modernist or traditional).  Individual characteristics form patterns.  Patterns relate elements hierarchically across physical scales (from small details to large systems). 

For an authoritative essay on Typology in urban planning and architecture, see Rafael Moneo's 1978 Essay 'On Typology', published in Oppositions magazine. In this article the history of the notion of type is traced from its origins in the French Enlightenment until the late 20th century.

The following is an example of a set of characteristics with typological associations:&lt;br /&gt;  

[[Single-family detached home]]s set well back from a street on large [[land lot|lots]] (about, one-fifth acre to two or more acres) and surrounded by mowed lawns with naturalistic ornamental plantings of trees and shrubs are associated typologically with North American [[suburban]] places.&lt;br /&gt; 

Single-family residences that come all the way forward on an individual lot so that the front of the building is coincident with front lot line, or which are set back only a few feet to accommodate a lightwell or front entry stoop, are associated typologically with highly urbanized places in North America.  

An emphasis on typology is characteristic of [[New Urbanism]].  New Urbanists believe it is important to match the physical development characteristics of a place within the appropriate typology for that place, as determined by local preferences taken in context with urban patterns as evidenced throughout history.  Modernists, in keeping with their general disinclination to keep within the constraints of tradition and hierarchies of patterns, are less likely to focus on identifying the correct typology of a site.

The '''World Values Survey''' ('''WVS'''), a global [[research project]], explores people's [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] and [[belief]]s, how they change over time and what social and political impact they have. Since 1981 a worldwide network of [[social scientists]] have conducted representative national [[Statistical survey|surveys]] as part of WVS in almost 100 countries.

The WVS measures, monitors and analyzes: support for [[democracy]], tolerance of foreigners and [[ethnic minorities]], support for [[gender equality]], the role of [[religion]] and changing levels of [[religiosity]], the impact of [[globalization]], attitudes toward the [[Natural environment| environment]], [[Labour economics |work]], [[family]], [[politics]], national identity, [[culture]], [[multiculturalism |diversity]],  insecurity,  and [[subjective well-being]].

The findings provide information for policy makers seeking to build [[civil society]] and democratic institutions in [[developing countries]].{{cn|date=October 2018}} The work is also frequently used by governments around the world, scholars, students, journalists and international organizations and institutions such as the [[World Bank]] and the United Nations ([[United Nations Development Programme | UNDP]] and [[United Nations Human Settlements Programme | UN-Habitat]]). Data from the World Values Survey have (for example) been used{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} to better understand the motivations behind events such as the [[Arab Spring]], the [[2005 French civil unrest]], the [[Rwandan genocide]] in 1994 and the [[Yugoslav wars]] and political upheaval in the 1990s. {{Citation needed|date= December 2014}}

[[Romano Prodi]], former Prime Minister of Italy and the tenth President of the [[European Commission]], said about WVS work:  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The growing globalization of the world makes it increasingly important to understand ... diversity.  People with varying beliefs and values can live together and work together productively, but for this to happen it is crucial to understand and appreciate their distinctive [[worldview]]s.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Basanez | Diez-Medrano | Halman | 2004 | p = xiii}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Insights==
The WVS has over the years demonstrated that people's [[beliefs]] play a key role in [[economic development]], the emergence and flourishing of democratic institutions, the rise of [[gender equality]], and the extent to which societies have effective [[government]].

===Inglehart–Welzel cultural map===
{{main|Inglehart–Welzel cultural map of the world}}

Analysis of WVS data made by political scientists [[Ronald Inglehart]] and [[Christian Welzel]] asserts that there are two major dimensions of cross cultural variation in the world: 
# '''Traditional values''' versus '''Secular-rational values''' and 
# '''Survival values''' versus '''Self-expression values'''.
The global cultural map (below) shows how scores of societies are located on these two dimensions. Moving upward on this map reflects the shift from Traditional values to Secular-rational and moving rightward reflects the shift from Survival values to Self–expression values.&lt;ref name=wvs-old&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_54 |title=The WVS Cultural Map of the World |publisher=WVS |author1=Ronald Inglehart |author2=Chris Welzel |accessdate=6 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019112321/http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_54 |archivedate=October 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Traditional values'' emphasize the importance of religion, parent-child ties, deference to authority and traditional family values. People who embrace these values also reject divorce, abortion, euthanasia and suicide.  These societies have high levels of national pride and a nationalistic outlook.&lt;ref name=wvs-old/&gt;

''Secular-rational values'' have the opposite preferences to the traditional values. These societies place less emphasis on religion, traditional family values and authority. Divorce, abortion, euthanasia and suicide are seen as relatively acceptable.&lt;ref name=wvs-old/&gt;

''Survival values'' place emphasis on economic and physical security. It is linked with a relatively [[ethnocentric]] outlook and low levels of trust and tolerance.&lt;ref name=wvs-old/&gt;

''Self-expression values'' give high priority to environmental protection, growing tolerance of foreigners, gays and lesbians and gender equality, and rising demands for participation in decision-making in economic and political life.&lt;ref name=wvs-old/&gt;

====Culture variations====
A somewhat simplified analysis is that following an increase in [[standards of living]], and a transit from development country via [[industrialization]] to  [[post-industrial society|post-industrial]] [[Society#Knowledge society|knowledge society]], a country tends to move diagonally in the direction from lower-left corner (poor) to upper-right corner (rich), indicating a transit in both dimensions.

However, the attitudes among the population are also highly correlated with the philosophical, political and religious ideas that have been dominating in the country. Secular-rational values and [[materialism]] were formulated by philosophers and the [[left-wing politics]] side in the [[French revolution]], and can consequently be observed especially in countries with a long history of social democratic or socialistic policy, and in  countries where a large portion of the population have studied philosophy and science at universities.  Survival values are characteristic for eastern-world countries and self-expression values for western-world countries. In a liberal [[post-industrial economy]], an increasing share of the population has grown up taking survival and freedom of thought for granted, resulting in that self-expression is highly valued.

====Examples====
* Societies that have high scores in Traditional and Survival values: Zimbabwe, Morocco, Jordan, Bangladesh.
* Societies with high scores in Traditional and Self-expression values: the U.S., most of Latin America, Ireland.
* Societies with high scores in Secular-rational and Survival values: Russia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Estonia.
* Societies with high scores in Secular-rational and Self-expression values: Japan, [[Nordic countries]], Benelux, Germany, Switzerland, Czechia, Slovenia, France.

===Gender values===
Findings from the WVS indicate that support for [[gender equality]] is not just a consequence of [[democratization]]. It is part of a broader cultural change that is transforming [[Industrialisation|industrialized societies]] with mass demands for increasingly democratic institutions. Although a majority of the world's population still believes that men make better political leaders than women, this view is fading in advanced industrialized societies, and also among young people in less prosperous countries.{{Sfn | Alesina | Giuliano | Nunn | 2010}}

===Religion===
The data from the World Values Survey cover several important aspects of people's religious orientation.  One of them tracks how involved people are in religious services and how much importance they attach to their religious beliefs.  In the data from 2000, 98% of the public in [[Indonesia]] said that religion was very important in their lives while in [[China]] only three percent considered religion very important.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Basanez | Diez-Medrano | Halman | 2004 | p = 2}}  Another aspect concerns people's attitudes towards the relation between religion and politics and whether they approve of religious spokesmen who try to influence government decisions and people's voting preferences.

In a [[factor analysis]] of the latest wave (6) of World Values Survey data, [[Arno Tausch]] ([[Corvinus University Budapest]]) found that family values in the tradition of [[Joseph Alois Schumpeter]] and religious values in the research tradition of [[Robert Barro]] can be an important positive asset for society. Negative phenomena, like the distrust in the state of law; the shadow economy; the distance from altruistic values; a growing fatigue of democracy; and the lack of entrepreneurial spirit are all correlated with the loss of [[religiosity]]. Tausch based his results on a [[factor analysis]] with [[promax]] rotation of 78 variables from 45 countries with complete data, and also calculated performance indices for the 45 countries with complete data and the nine main global religious denominations. On this account, [[Judaism]] and also [[Protestantism]] emerge as most closely combining religion and the traditions of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;Tausch A. (2015) Towards new maps of global human values, based on World Values Survey (6) data. [[Corvinus University Budapest]] https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/63349.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Happiness and life satisfaction===
The WVS has shown that from 1981 to 2007 happiness rose in 45 of the 52 countries for which long-term data are available.&lt;ref name=wvs-old2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_122 |title=Is Denmark the happiest country in the world? |publisher=WVS |author=WVSA |accessdate=9 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019111440/http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_122 |archivedate=October 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1981, economic development, democratization, and rising social tolerance have increased the extent to which people perceive that they have free choice, which in turn has led to higher levels of happiness around the world, which supports the [[human development theory]].&lt;ref name=wvs-old2/&gt;

===Findings===
Some of the survey's basic findings are:
# Much of the variation in human values between societies boils down to two broad dimensions: a first dimension of “''traditional vs. secular-rational values''” and a second dimension of “''survival vs. self-expression values''.”{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2005 | loc = chapter 2}}
# On the first dimension, traditional values emphasize religiosity, national pride, respect for authority, obedience and marriage. Secular-rational values emphasize the opposite on each of these accounts.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2005 | loc = chapter 2}}
# On the second dimension, survival values involve a priority of security over liberty, non-acceptance of homosexuality, abstinence from political action, distrust in outsiders and a weak sense of happiness. Self-expression values imply the opposite on all these accounts.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2005 | loc = chapter 2}}
# Following the ‘revised theory of modernization,’ values change in predictable ways with certain aspects of modernity. People's priorities shift from traditional to secular-rational values as their ''sense of existential security'' increases (or backwards from secular-rational values to traditional values as their sense of existential security decreases).{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2005 | loc = chapter 2}}
# The largest increase in existential security occurs with the ''transition from agrarian to industrial societies''. Consequently, the largest shift from traditional towards secular-rational values happens in this phase.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2005 | loc = chapter 2}}
# People's priorities shift from survival to self-expression values as their ''sense of individual agency'' increases (or backwards from self-expression values to survival as the sense of individual agency decreases).{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2005 | loc = chapter 2}}
# The largest increase in individual agency occurs with the ''transition from industrial to knowledge societies''. Consequently, the largest shift from survival to self-expression values happens in this phase.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2005 | loc = chapter 2}}
# The value differences between societies around the world show a pronounced ''culture zone pattern''. The strongest emphasis on traditional values and survival values is found in the Islamic societies of the Middle East. By contrast, the strongest emphasis on secular-rational values and self-expression values is found in the Protestant societies of Northern Europe.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | Klingemann | 2003 | pp = 341–80}}
# These culture zone differences reflect different ''historical pathways'' of how entire groups of societies entered modernity. These pathways account for people's different senses of existential security and individual agency, which in turn account for their different emphases on secular-rational values and self-expression values.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | Klingemann | 2003 | pp = 341–80}}
# Values also differ within societies along such cleavage lines as gender, generation, ethnicity, religious denomination, education, income and so forth.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2010 | pp = 551–67}}
# Generally speaking, groups whose living conditions provide people with a stronger sense of existential security and individual agency nurture a stronger emphasis on secular-rational values and self-expression values.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2010 | pp = 551–67}}
# However, the ''within''-societal differences in people's values are dwarfed by a factor five to ten by the ''between''-societal differences. On a global scale, basic living conditions differ still much more between than within societies, and so do the experiences of existential security and individual agency that shape people's values.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2010 | pp = 551–67}}
# A specific subset of self-expression values—''[[emancipation|emancipative]] values''—combines an emphasis on freedom of choice and equality of opportunities. Emancipative values, thus, involve priorities for lifestyle liberty, gender equality, personal [[autonomy]] and the voice of the people.{{Sfn | Alexander | Welzel | 2010 | pp = 1–21}}
# Emancipative values constitute the key cultural component of a broader process of ''human empowerment''. Once set in motion, this process empowers people to exercise freedoms in their course of actions.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | 2010 | pp = 43–63}}
# If set in motion, human empowerment advances on three levels. On the socio-economic level, human empowerment advances as growing ''action resources'' increase people's capabilities to exercise freedoms. On the socio-cultural level, human empowerment advances as rising ''emancipative values'' increase people's aspirations to exercise freedoms.  On the legal-institutional level, human empowerment advances as widened ''democratic rights'' increase people's entitlements to exercise freedoms.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | Klingemann | 2003 | pp = 341–80}}
# Human empowerment is an ''entity of empowering capabilities, aspirations, and entitlements''. As an entity, human empowerment tends to advance in virtuous spirals or to recede in vicious spirals on each of its three levels.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | 2008 | pp = 126–40}}
# As the cultural component of human empowerment, emancipative values are highly consequential in manifold ways. For one, emancipative values establish a ''civic form of modern individualism'' that favours out-group trust and cosmopolitan orientations towards others.{{Sfn | Welzel | 2010 | pp = 1–23}}
# Emancipative values encourage ''nonviolent protest'', even against the risk of repression. Thus, emancipative values provide [[social capital]] that activates societies, makes publics more self-expressive, and vitalizes civil society. Emancipative values advance entire societies’ civic agency.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | Deutsch | 2005 | p = 121–46}}
# If emancipative values grow strong in countries that are democratic, they help to ''prevent movements away from democracy''.{{Sfn | Welzel | 2007 | pp = 397–424}}
# If emancipative values grow strong in countries that are undemocratic, they help to trigger ''movements towards democracy''.{{Sfn | Welzel | 2007 | pp = 397–424}}
# Emancipative values exert these effects because they encourage mass actions that put power holders under pressures to sustain, substantiate or establish democracy, depending on what the current challenge for democracy is.{{Sfn | Welzel | 2007 | pp = 397–424}}
# Objective factors that have been found to favour democracy (including economic prosperity, income equality, ethnic homogeneity, world market integration, global media exposure, closeness to democratic neighbours, a Protestant heritage, social capital and so forth) exert an influence on democracy mostly insofar as these factors favour emancipative values.{{Sfn | Welzel | 2007 | pp = 397–424}}
# Emancipative values do not strengthen people's desire for democracy, for the desire for democracy is universal at this point in history. But emancipative values do change the ''nature of the desire for democracy''. And they do so in a double way.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | 2010 | pp = 311–29}}
# For one, emancipative values make people's understanding of democracy more liberal: people with stronger emancipative values emphasize the empowering features of democracy rather than bread-and-butter and law-and-order issues.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | 2010 | pp = 311–29}}
# Next, emancipative values make people assess the level of their country's democracy more critical: people with stronger emancipative values rather underrate than overrate their country's democratic performance.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | 2010 | pp = 311–29}}
# Together, then, emancipative values generate a ''critical-liberal desire for democracy''. The critical-liberal desire for democracy is a formidable force of democratic reforms.  And, it is the best available predictor of a country's effective level of democracy and of other indicators of good governance. Neither democratic traditions nor cognitive mobilization account for the strong positive impact of emancipative values on the critical-liberal desire for democracy.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | 2010 | pp = 311–29}}
# Emancipative values constitute the single most important factor in advancing the [[empowerment]] of women. Economic, religious, and institutional factors that have been found to advance women's empowerment, do so for the most part because they nurture emancipative values.{{Sfn | Alexander | Welzel | 2010 | pp = 1–21}}
# Emancipative values change people's life strategy from an emphasis on securing a decent subsistence level to enhancing human agency. As the shift from subsistence to agency affects entire societies, the overall level of [[subjective well-being]] rises.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | 2010 | pp = 43–63}}
# The emancipative consequences of the human empowerment process are not a culture-specific peculiarity of the ‘West.’ The same empowerment processes that advance emancipative values and a critical-liberal desire for democracy in the ‘West,’ do the same in the ‘East’ and in other culture zones.{{Sfn | Welzel | 2011 | pp = 1–31}}
# The social dominance of Islam and individual identification as Muslim both weaken emancipative values. But among young Muslims with high education, and especially among young Muslim women with high education, the Muslim/Non-Muslim gap over emancipative values closes.{{Sfn | Alexander | Welzel | 2011}}

==History==
The World Values Surveys were designed to test the hypothesis that economic and technological changes are transforming the basic values and motivations of the publics of industrialized societies. The surveys build on the [[European Values Study]] (EVS) first carried out in 1981. The EVS was conducted under the aegis of [[Jan Kerkhofs]] and [[Ruud de Moor]] and continues to be based in the [[Netherlands]] at the [[Tilburg University]]. The 1981 study was largely limited to developed societies, but interest in this project spread so widely that surveys were carried out in more than twenty countries, located on all six inhabited continents. [[Ronald Inglehart]] of the [[University of Michigan]] played a leading role in extending these surveys to be carried out in countries around the world. Today the network includes hundreds of social scientist from more than 100 countries.

Findings from the first wave of surveys pointed to the conclusion that intergenerational changes were taking place in basic values relating to politics, economic life, religion, gender roles, family norms and sexual norms. The values of younger generations differed consistently from those prevailing among older generations, particularly in societies that had experienced rapid economic growth. To examine whether changes were actually taking place in these values and to analyze the underlying causes, a second wave of WVS surveys was carried out in 1990–91. Because these changes seem to be linked with economic and technological development, it was important to include societies across the entire range of development, from low income societies to rich societies.&lt;ref name=wvs51/&gt;

A third wave of surveys was carried out in 1995–97, this time in 55 societies and with increased attention being given to analysing the cultural conditions for democracy. A fourth wave of surveys was carried out in 1999–2001 in 65 societies. A key goal was to obtain better coverage of African and Islamic societies, which had been under-represented in previous surveys. A fifth wave was carried out in 2005–07 and a sixth wave was carried out during 2011–12.&lt;ref name=wvs51&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_51 |title=Building A Worldwide Network Of Social Scientists |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409204339/http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_51 |archivedate=April 9, 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the European origin of the project, the early waves of the WVS were [[eurocentric]] in emphasis, with little representation in Africa and South-East Asia. To expand, the WVS adopted a decentralised structure, in which social scientists from countries throughout the world participated in the design, execution and analysis of the data, and in publication of findings. In return for providing the data from a survey in their own society, each group obtained immediate access to the data from all participating societies enabling them to analyse social change in a broader perspective.&lt;ref name=wvs51/&gt;

The WVS network has produced over 300 publications in 20 languages and secondary users have produced several thousand additional publications.&lt;ref name=wvs51/&gt; The database of the WVS has been published on the internet with free access.

The official archive of the World Values Survey is located in [ASEP/JDS] [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].

==Methodology==
The World Values Survey uses the [[sample survey]] as its mode of data collection, a systematic and standardized approach to collect information through interviewing representative national samples of individuals. The basic stages of a sample survey are Questionnaire design; [[Sampling (statistics)|Sampling]]; [[Data collection]] and [[Analysis]].

===Questionnaire design===
For each wave, suggestions for questions are solicited by social scientists from all over the world and a final master [[questionnaire]] is developed in English. Since the start in 1981 each successive wave has covered a broader range of societies than the previous one. Analysis of the data from each wave has indicated that certain questions tapped interesting and important concepts while others were of little value. This has led to the more useful questions or themes being replicated in future waves while the less useful ones have been dropped making room for new questions.{{Sfn | Esmer | 2004 | p = 386}}

The questionnaire is translated into the various national languages and in many cases independently translated back to English to check the accuracy of the translation. In most countries, the translated questionnaire is pre-tested to help identify questions for which the translation is problematic. In some cases certain problematic questions are omitted from the national questionnaire.

===Sampling===
Samples are drawn from the entire population of 18 years and older. The minimum sample is 1000. In most countries, no upper age limit is imposed and some form of stratified random [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] is used to obtain representative national samples. In the first stages, a random selection of sampling points is made based on the given society statistical regions, districts, census units, election sections, [[electoral registers]] or [[polling place]] and central population registers. In most countries the population size and/or degree of [[urbanization]] of these Primary Sampling Units are taken into account. In some countries, individuals are drawn from national registers.{{Sfn | Esmer | 2004 | p = 390}}

===Data collection and field work===
Following the sampling, each country is left with a representative national sample of its public. These persons are then interviewed during a limited time frame decided by the Executive Committee of the World Values Survey using the uniformly structured questionnaires. The survey is carried out by professional organizations using face-to-face [[interviews]] or phone interviews for remote areas. Each country has a Principal Investigator (social scientists working in academic institutions) who is responsible for conducting the survey in accordance with the fixed rules and procedures.  During the field work, the agency has to report in writing according to a specific check-list.  Internal consistency checks are made between the sampling design and the outcome and rigorous data cleaning procedures are followed at the WVS data archive. No country is included in a wave before full documentation has been delivered. This means a data set with the completed methodological questionnaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/survey_2005 | title = World values survey | year = 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a report of country-specific information (for example important political events during the fieldwork, problems particular to the country). Once all the surveys are completed, the Principal Investigator has access to all surveys and data.

===Analysis===
The World Values Survey group works with leading social scientists, recruited from each society studied. They represent a wide range of cultures and perspectives which makes it possible to draw on the insights of well-informed insiders in interpreting the findings. It also helps disseminate social science techniques to new countries.

Each research team, that has contributed to the survey,  analyses the findings according to its hypotheses. Because all researchers obtain data from all of the participating societies, they are also able to compare the values and beliefs of the people of their own society with those from scores of other societies and to test alternative hypotheses. In addition, the participants are invited to international meetings at which they can compare findings and interpretations with other members of the WVS network. The findings are then disseminated through international conferences and joint publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/new_index_publications | title = New index publications | publisher = World values survey}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage===
The World Values Survey data has been downloaded by over 100,000 researchers, journalists, policy-makers and others. The data is available on the WVS website which contains tools developed for online analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/index_surveys | title = Index surveys | publisher = World values survey}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance and funding==
The World Values Survey is organised as a network of social scientists coordinated by a central body - the World Values Survey Association. It is established as a non-profit organization seated in Stockholm, Sweden, with a constitution&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_52/files/constitution.pdf | title = Constitution | format = PDF | publisher = World values survey}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and mission statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_52 | title = World values survey}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The project is guided by an Executive Committee representing all regions of the world. The Committee is also supported by a Scientific Advisory Committee, a Secretariat and an Archive. The WVS Executive Committee provides leadership and strategic planning for the association. It is responsible for the recruitment of new members, the organization of meetings and workshops, data processing and distribution, capacity building and the promotion of publications and dissemination of results. The WVS Executive Committee also raises funds for central functions and assists member groups in their fundraising.

Each national team is responsible for its own expenses and most surveys are financed by local sources. However, central funding has been obtained in cases where local funding is not possible. Presently, the activities of the WVS Secretariat and WVS Executive Committee are funded by the [[Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation]]. Other funding has been obtained from the [[U.S. National Science Foundation]], the [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]] (SIDA), the Volkswagen Foundation, the [[German Science Foundation (DFG)]] and the [[Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science]].

The '''École Nationale Supérieure des Industries Chimiques''' ('''ENSIC''') is an Engineering School dedicated to [[Chemical Engineering]] in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[France]].

Ensic Nancy is one of the seven schools of the [[National Polytechnic Institute of Lorraine|Institut National Polytechnique de Lorraine]] (INPL), France's largest technological university.
==Creation==
In October 1885, it was announced that the authorities were in favour of the creation of an institute of chemistry in Nancy.  This pulled together a variety of chemical activities in the University of Nancy, with the specific aim of instructing young men in the practical application of chemistry to industry and agriculture. The decree authorizing the creation of the Institute was made on 8 September 1887 and construction began in 1888. The first 6 students joined in 1889 and [[Albin Haller]] was appointed as director on 30 July 1890.  on 6 June 1892 it was formally inaugurated by the President of the Republic, [[Marie François Sadi Carnot]].

''La contribution des pharmaciens à la création (1887-1892) et à l'enseignement de l'Institut Chimique de Nancy. L'influence des systèmes étrangers d'éducation sur cette création.'' &lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Achievements==
One of its early professors, [[Victor Grignard]], obtained the [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Chemistry]] in 1912 for his invention of the organo-metallic compounds known as "[[Grignard reagent|Grignard's reagents]]". After the Second World War, ENSIC introduced to France chemical engineering principles developed in the English-speaking world.

The school created a [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|foundation]] in December 2008 to support its activities, called ''Fondation ENSIC'', with the participation of [[Arkema]].
