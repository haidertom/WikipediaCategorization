'''20-sim''' is commercial modeling and simulation program for multidomain dynamic systems, which is developed by Controllab. With 20-sim models can be entered as equations, block diagrams, bond graphs and physical components. 20-sim is widely used for modeling complex multi-domain systems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==

20-sim supports four methods for modeling dynamic systems: iconic diagrams, [[block diagram]]s, [[bond graphs]] and equations and allows all of these methods to be used in one model. The package has advanced support for bond graph modeling, making it well known in bond graph communities.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For modeling physical systems the package provides libraries for electrical systems, mechanical systems, hydraulics systems and thermal systems. For block diagrams, libraries comparable to those of [[Simulink]], are provided. A feature of the software is the option to create models with differential equations and package them as block diagram elements or physical components.

20-sim models can be simulated using state of the art [[numerical integration]] methods. After checking and processing, models are directly converted into [[machine code]], resulting in high speed simulations. Unlike Simulink, simulation results are shown in 20-sim in a separate window called the Simulator. The simulator is versatile: plots can be displayed horizontally and vertically as time and frequency based plots and [[3D animation]]s.

20-sim is self containing, i.e. no additional software is required and all toolboxes are included.  Toolboxes are available for model building, time domain analysis, frequency domain analysis and controller design. To enable scripting it is necessary to install either Matlab, GNU Octave, or Python. The last is included as an optional feature in the 20-sim installer.

== Reviews ==

Because of its extended support of bond graph modeling 20-sim is highly rated in the bond graph community. According to Borutzky &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bond Graph Modelling of Engineering Systems |first=W. |last=Borutzky |year=2011 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4419-9367-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; only 
"20-sim, MS1 and Symbols can be categorized as a fully integrated (multi-formalism) modeling and simulation environments especially supporting bond graphs".

Roddeck&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modellbildung mit Bondgraphen |last=Roddeck |first=Werner |pages=134–140 |year=2013 | publisher=Springer | isbn = 978-3-8348-1747-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; compares several modeling and simulation tools like [[Simulink]], [[Labview]] and 20-sim. Roddeck acknowledges the market leadership of Simulink but states that the advantage of 20-sim is the direct input of bond graphs in 20-sim and the availability of built-in tools for FFT-analysis and 3D mechanical modeling.   
  
The book of J. Ledin &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Simulation Engineering, Build Better Embedded Systems Faster |first=Jim |last=Ledin | pages = 241–283 |year=2001 |publisher=CMP Books |isbn=1-57820-080-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; gives practical guidelines for modeling and simulation of dynamic systems. An entire chapter is spent on simulation tools. According to Ledin, "20-sim differs from other simulation tools like Simulink and [[VisSim]] in that it supports four methods for modeling dynamic systems: iconic diagrams, [[block diagram]]s, [[bond graphs]] and equations. This allows for example, the construction of electrical circuit simulations using standard symbols to represent components, such as op-amps and capacitors." A weak point, according to Ledin is the missing capability for distributed simulation in 20-sim.

== Add-on Products ==

20-sim offers tight integration with 20-sim 4C. Any 20-sim model can be exported as C-code to 20-sim 4C where it can be used for deployment on hardware. Typical use is the development of controllers for embedded software and the creation of "virtual plants" for use in [[hardware-in-the-loop simulation|hardware-in-the-loop simulators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=Feb 25, 2013 |title=ODIM Launch and Recovery System simulator |url=http://www.20sim4c.com/images/stories/Factsheets/Factsheet%20Rolls-Royce%20Marine.pdf | location=Norway}}&lt;/ref&gt;
20-sim can be controlled by scripting, allowing task automation and scenario building. Scripting is supported in [[Matlab]] or [[GNU Octave]], and in Python (since v4.6).

Next to scripting, 20-sim has a tight connection with [[Matlab]], [[GNU Octave]] and [[Simulink]] allowing the import and export of data on many levels. The export of 20-sim models as M-files or S-functions is the most prominent example.

== History ==

20-sim is the redevelopment of the simulation software package [[TUTSIM]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was developed at the Control Laboratory of the [[University of Twente]]. While TUTSIM was sold in the late 70's, research into modeling and simulation continued at the laboratory.  A new program was developed as part of the Ph.D. project of Jan Broenink. The program was equipped with a graphical user interface and allowed the creation of models by bond graphs. The prototype name for this modeling and simulation package was CAMAS. While CAMAS was all built around [[bond graphs]], a new prototype package called MAX was developed to investigated object oriented modeling techniques and modeling by iconic diagrams. After extensive testing, in August 1995 version 1.0 of the software was commercially released under the trade name 20-sim (Twente Sim). The trade name refers to the origin (University of Twente) of the package and the region ([[Twente]]) where it was made. The company [[Controllab|Controllab Products]] was established to further develop and distribute the package.

The '''Abortion Rights Campaign''' (ARC) is an Irish [[Abortion-rights movements|pro-choice]] group. Its  main aim is the introduction of free, safe and legal abortion care in Ireland and Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abortion Rights Campaign |title=Submission to the Citizens' Assembly |date=2016-12-15 |pages=1 |url=https://issuu.com/abortionrightscampaign/docs/citizens_assembly_front |accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant aim prior to May 2018 was the repeal of the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution, which was achieved by the successful passing of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-sixth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_Bill_2018 Thirty-Sixth Amendment 2018]. ARC also campaigns for the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] to introduce extensive abortion legislation in common with the rest of the United Kingdom and "to ensure the health of women in pregnancy is protected in line with international human rights standards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = About ARC {{!}} Abortion Rights Campaign Ireland|url = http://www.abortionrightscampaign.ie/about-arc/|website = www.abortionrightscampaign.ie|accessdate = 2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARC supports the full decriminalisation of abortion in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Abortion must be fully decriminalised |url=https://www.abortionrightscampaign.ie/2018/01/16/abortion-must-be-fully-decriminalised/ |website=Abortion Rights Campaign Blog |accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Abortion Rights Campaign was formed on 10 July 2012, when 40 people came together. Initially formed as the Irish Choice Network, after another meeting in the [[Gresham Hotel]] in [[Dublin]] on 8 December 2012 and another meeting in 19 January 2013 the Abortion Rights Campaign was formally launched. It has organised the annual March for Choice in Dublin since 2013.

Many Irish politicians have supported ARC's aims, such as [[Richard Boyd Barrett]] ([[Anti-Austerity Alliance–People Before Profit]]), [[Catherine Murphy (politician)|Catherine Murphy]] ([[Social Democrats (Ireland)|Social Democrats]]), [[Mick Wallace]], [[Joan Collins (politician)|Joan Collins]] and [[Clare Daly]] ([[Independents 4 Change]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kitty Holland |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/march-for-choice-attracts-thousands-in-dublin-1.1944267 |title=March For Choice Attracts Thousands In Dublin |publisher=[[Irish Times]] |date=2014-09-27 |accessdate=2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However ARC itself is not affiliated with any political party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Abortion Rights Campaign |title=ARC is not affiliated to any political party |url=https://www.abortionrightscampaign.ie/2017/11/22/arc-is-not-affiliated-to-any-political-party/ |accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ARC was one of the main partner organisations in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Together_for_Yes Together for Yes], the civil society group advocating a Yes vote in the 2018 referendum. One of ARC's founding members was a co-director of Together for Yes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.togetherforyes.ie/about-us/our-executive/|title=Together for Yes Executive|last=|first=|date=|website=Together for Yes|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARC's network of regional groups across the island of Ireland formed the basis for many Together for Yes groups in several counties in Ireland. 

In January 2016, they received a grant of €23,000 from [[Open Society Foundation]] for "educational and stigma-busting projects." [[Standards in Public Office Commission|SIPO]] reasoned that the money had been raised for a political purpose. The ARC returned the money in November 2016, while disagreeing with the finding. The story was first published in ''[[The Irish Catholic]]'' in late March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/abortion-rights-campaign-group-returns-us-donation-after-sipo-warning-1.3033589|newspaper=The Irish Times|title=Abortion Rights Campaign group returns US donation after SIPO warning|date=1 April 2017|first=Aine|last=McMahon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=TheJournal.ie|url=https://www.thejournal.ie/abortion-rights-campaign-return-e23000-to-foreign-donor-3316866-Apr2017/|title=Abortion Rights Campaign gives back €23,000 US donation|date=1 April 2017|first=Gráinne|last=Ní Aodha}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=freesafelegal|number=848161372441628672|date=1 April 2017|title=Abortion Rights Campaign gives back €23,000 US donation (via @thejournal_ie)|author=Abortion Rights IE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Irish Catholic]]|url=http://irishcatholic.ie/article/pro-repeal-group-return-billionaire%E2%80%99s-cash-after-ethics-watchdog-probe|title=Pro-repeal group return billionaire’s cash after ethics watchdog probe|date=30 March 2017|first=Greg|last=Daly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
ARC is an all-volunteer, non-hierarchical organisation. Membership elect a Convening Group annually, which convenes a Steering Group made up of representatives of several working groups and regional groups. Ongoing decision-making is carried out by the Steering Group during regular meetings. There is no one leader or spokesperson of ARC as the Convening and Working Group roles change on a regular basis. This structure is designed to encourage engagement and activity by all members, and to avoid power hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abortion Rights Campaign |title=Annual Report 2015 |date=2017-12-06 |pages=8-9 |url=https://www.abortionrightscampaign.ie/2017/12/06/our-annual-report-2015/ |accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==March for Choice==
The Abortion Rights Campaign's most visible event is the annual March for Choice, normally held on the [http://www.september28.org/ Global Day of Action for Safe and Legal Access to Abortion]. The March is organised by ARC and attended by the public, as well as various national pro-choice groups, including trade unions such as [[Unite the Union|Unite]], [[Mandate (trade union)|Mandate]], [[Teachers Union of Ireland]], [[National Union of Journalists]] and [[Union of Students in Ireland]], political parties including [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour]], [[Solidarity–People Before Profit]], and the [[Social Democrats (Ireland)|Social Democrats]], and international groups such as [[Catholics for Choice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kitty Holland |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/march-for-choice-attracts-thousands-in-dublin-1.1944267 |title=‘March for Choice’ attracts thousands in Dublin |publisher=[[Irish Times]] |date=2014-09-27 |accessdate=2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mary Carolan |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/campaign-for-legal-abortions-says-new-laws-too-restrictive-1.1542611 |title=Campaign for legal abortions says new laws too restrictive |publisher=[[Irish Times]] |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent March for Choice was held on 29 September 2018, the first since the vote to repeal the Eighth Amendment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thejournal.ie/march-for-choice-dublin-2-4260824-Sep2018/|title=Large crowds as March for Choice takes place in Dublin|last=Barry|first=Aoife|date=2018-09-29|work=The Journal|access-date=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme was 'Free Safe Legal', the slogan of ARC, and was chosen to "show [their] support for stigma-free abortion access for anyone who wants or needs one, regardless of their financial or legal status".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abortionrightscampaign.ie/2018/09/16/march-for-choice-29th-september/|title=March for Choice 29th September|last=|first=|date=2018-09-16|website=Abortion Rights Campaign|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speakers included ARC co-conveners Sarah Monaghan and Denise O'Toole, Zanele Sibindi of Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland, Evie Nevin of Disabled Women for Yes and Emma Campbell and Kellie O'Dowd from the Belfast-based Alliance for Choice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The 2017 March for Choice was held on 30 September and over 40,000 people took part. The rally at the march's conclusion was addressed by [[Bernadette Devlin McAliskey]].  Additional "sympathy marches" were held in 20 cities around the world, including London, Sydney and Nicosia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2017/0930/908737-march-for-choice/|title=Tens of thousands take part in March for Choice rally|publisher=RTÉ|date=30 September 2017|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/thousands-attend-dublin-abortion-rights-protest-1.3239832|title=Thousands attend Dublin abortion rights protest|publisher=The Irish Times|date=30 September 2017|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10142">Active Perception is where an agents' behaviors are selected in order to increase the information content derived from the flow of sensor data obtained by those behaviors in the environment in question.  In other words, in order to understand the world we move around and explore it.  We sample the world through our eyes, ears, nose, skin, and tongue as we explore and construct an understanding (Perception) of the environment on the basis of this behavior (Action).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The senses considered as perceptual systems.|last=Gibson|first=J. J.|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1966|isbn=978-0313239618|location=Oxford England|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the construct of Active Perception, the interpretation of sensor data (perception) is inherently inseparable from the behaviors required to capture that data - action (behaviors) and perception (interpretation of sensor data) are tightly coupled.  This has been developed most comprehensively with respect to vision ([[Active vision|Active Vision]]) where  an agent (animal, robot, human, camera mount) changes position in order to improve the view of a specific object and/or where the agent uses movement in order to perceive the environment (e.g. for obstacle avoidance).

More formally Active Perception has been defined as follows:

"Active Perception (Active Vision specifically) is defined as a study of Modeling and Control strategies for perception. By modeling we mean models of sensors, processing modules and their interaction. We distinguish local models from global models by their extent of application in space and time. The local models represent procedures and parameters such as optical distortions of the lens, focal lens, spatial resolution, band-pass filter, etc. The global models on the other hand characterize the overall performance and make predictions on how the individual modules interact. The control strategies are formulated as a search of such sequence of steps that would minimize a loss function while one is seeking the most information. Examples are shown as the existence proof of the proposed theory on obtaining range from focus and sterolvergence on 2-0 segmentation of an image and 3-0 shape parametrization".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bajcsy|first=Ruzena|date=August 1988|title=Active Perception|url=https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yang/courses/cs294-6/papers/Bajcsy.active%20Perception.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|volume=76, 8|pages=996–1005|via=|doi=10.1109/5.5968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Optical flow|The theory of Optical Flow]] was derived from concepts of Active Perception, and while optical flow is now typically considered to be a vector representation of motion captured by a vision sensor (camera), it was originally described in terms of Active Perception.  The behavior of the agent (animal, robot, human) in the world generates a flow of data over the visual sensor (camera, eye) which is sampled by the sensor and interpreted into a percept of the environment by the agent, through some computation.  On the basis of this percept the agent then selects another behavior that generates more data flow.  Thus Optical Flow is the data flow carried by light from the environment to the vision sensor as a result of movement in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Perception of the Visual World|last=Gibson|first=J. J.|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1950|isbn=978-1114828087|location=Oxford England|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a related but narrower definition of '''active perception''' that [[perception]] and action are represented within the brain as the same thing. It states that when a person sees an action done, it is internally translated into, and understood within the context of, an action that they could do. This supports the capability in people and animals of learning what to do based on what they see others doing.&lt;ref&gt;(Bargh &amp; Dijksterhuis, 2001, p. 3)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological Psychology==
Active Perception is part of the broader field of [[ecological psychology]]. Ecological Psychology (and theories of Ecological Perception) was formulated by [[gestalt psychology|gestalt psychologists]] in the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;Koffka, 1936&lt;/ref&gt; and refined by Gibson through the 1950s to 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 1979, The [[Ecological Theory of Perception]], Haughton and Mifflin, Boston&lt;/ref&gt; The theory has held strong, although for the approximately 80 years that it has been around, it has always been considered a niche area of [[psychology]]. Ecological Perception has had little traction in medicine, for instance, until recently, when a series of coherent hypotheses proposed that active perception is the basis for developmental disorders and psychiatric symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Avenanti, A., &amp; Urgesi, C. (2011). Understanding 'what' others do: mirror mechanisms play a crucial role in action perception. Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, 6(3), 257-259. {{doi|10.1093/scan/nsr004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buccino | first1 = G. | last2 = Amore | first2 = M. | year = 2008 | title = Mirror neurons and the understanding of behavioural symptoms in psychiatric disorders | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Psychiatry | volume = 21 | issue = 3| page = 281 | doi=10.1097/yco.0b013e3282fbcd32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Golembiewski | first1 = J | year = 2012 | title = All common psychotic symptoms can be explained by the theory of ecological perception | url = | journal = Medical Hypotheses | volume = 78 | issue = | pages = 7–10 | doi = 10.1016/j.mehy.2011.09.029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rizzolatti | first1 = G. | last2 = Fabbri-Destro | first2 = M. | last3 = Cattaneo | first3 = L. | year = 2009 | title = Mirror neurons and their clinical relevance | url = | journal = Nature Clinical Practice Neurology | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 24–34 | doi=10.1038/ncpneuro0990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recognition of objects and opportunities (or ''[[affordances]]'') as they are called by Gibson, is a function of the Ecological Perception. A glass of water is recognized through the fact that it supports a desire to drink, and a book by reading, although usually affordances are considered at a more basic level e.g. that rock affords me to sit upon it. The fact that most people don't read every book that comes their way, drink every glass of water, or sit on every rock, is thought to be a function of a secondary inhibition process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Golembiewski | first1 = J | year = 2012 | title = All common psychotic symptoms can be explained by the theory of ecological perception | url = | journal = Medical Hypotheses | volume = 78 | issue = | pages = 7–10 | doi = 10.1016/j.mehy.2011.09.029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus people with damaged inhibitory circuitry (in the [[frontal lobe]] of the brain) have no choice but to act in the face of perception. The classic examples are in the studies of [[environmental dependence syndrome]] and [[utilization behavior]] by.&lt;ref&gt;Avenanti, A., &amp; Urgesi, C. (2011).

== Applications of Active Perception ==
There is a wide range of work on the application of active perception to robotics, including ground vehicles, underwater vehicles, and air vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=active+perception+in+robotics&amp;oq=active+perception+in+robotics&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.3761j0j8&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8|title=Google search for "Active Perception in Robotics"|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As one would expect, when optical flow is included in the definition of active perception then the volume of related work significantly increases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5033">'Activist knowledge' or '[[dissident knowledge]]', refers to the ideological and ideational aspects of [[social movements]] such as challenging or reformulating dominant political ideas and ideologies, and developing new concepts, thoughts and meanings through the interactions with social, political, cultural and economic authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hosseini|first=S A Hamed|title=Alternative Globalizations: An Integrative Approach to Studying Dissident Knowledge in the Global Justice Movement|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-49476-2|url=http://www.routledge.com/9780415494762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cognitive or ideational aspects of social movements have been theorized by a group of scholars such as [[Ron Eyerman]] and [[Andrew Jamison]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eyerman|first=Ron|title=Social Movements: A Cognitive Approach|year=1991|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from a cognitive approach), [[Hank Johnston]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnston|first=Hank|title=Social Movements and Culture|year=1995|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David A. Snow|David Snow]] and others &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Snow|first=David|author2=Richford, E. B. Jr. |author3=Worden, S. K. |author4=Benford, R. D.|title=Frame Alignment Processes, Micromobilization, and Movement Participation|journal=American Sociological Review|year=1986|volume=51|issue=4|pages=464–481|doi=10.2307/2095581}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from a framing perspective) and S A Hosseini, from an integrative approach.

:"The ‘ideational dimension’ of a social movement consists of the intellectual processes of how the movement actors understand, conceptualize, explain, and analyze social problems and the events they have experienced, and how they reflect on their own individual and collective practices. The ‘ideational landscape’ of a social movement is a space where movement actors translate their collective experiences of social reality into ideas... Activist knowledge is, by definition, a process of (trans)forming social consciousness through a certain course of socio-political contentions and communicative actions – mostly undertaken in ‘public spheres’,  around a vital set of interrelated social issues, in order to explain and respond to them. This kind of collective-networked cognition is a practical-ideational process which proceeds out of a social movement’s relations with (and contributions to) both existing knowledge spheres and social reality."&lt;ref name="hosseini339"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hosseini|first=S A Hamed|title=Activist Knowledge: Interrogating the Ideational Landscape of Social Movements|journal=The International Journal of Interdisciplinary Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=5|issue=5|pages=339–357|url=http://iji.cgpublisher.com/product/pub.88/prod.1148|accessdate=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of new systems of meaning is an inseparable part of social movements. Especially in today's information society, as [[Manuel Castells]] points out, the real targets of the current mobilizations are the minds of people around the world; it is "by changing minds that they expect to put pressure on the institutions of governance and, ultimately, bring democracy and alternative social values to these institutions"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Castells|first=Manuel|title=The Power of Identity|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden; Oxford|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned in the [[World Social Forum]]’s Charter of Principles, for instance, ‘… the World Social Forum is a movement of ideas that prompts reflection, and the transparent circulation of the results of that reflection, on the mechanisms and instruments of domination by capital … and on the alternatives proposed to solve the problems of exclusion and inequality’ (WSF 2001 Principle 11)

The meaning and knowledge making processes in social movements are not however restricted to information acquisition and processing, social psychological cognitions, practical knowledge, deliberative contemplations in public spheres, discursive and ideological transformations, framing and so on.

:‘Activist/dissident knowledge’ "is formed through both strategic and communicative actions in confronting dominant social processes. Such knowledge is shaped at a very pragmatic level that differs in nature (despite some overlaps) from the academic level of knowledge production, the institutional level of political ideology construction, and even the routine interactional level of cultural reproduction".&lt;ref name="hosseini339"/&gt;

== Timeline ==

===October 2015 - Saada airstrike===
Doctors Without Borders reported that a Saudi Arabian-led [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|coalition]] airstrike on 26 October 2015&lt;ref name="urlExposed: British-made bombs used on civilian targets in Yemen | Amnesty International UK"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/exposed-british-made-bombs-used-civilian-targets-yemen |title=Exposed: British-made bombs used on civilian targets in Yemen &amp;#124; Amnesty International UK |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; had completely destroyed the [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] hospital in [[Saada]], in northwestern [[Yemen]], including the operating room.  The first strike hit an unused part of the hospital, so the facility was completely evacuated at once.  There were no direct casualties. The spokesman for the [[coalition forces]], Brig-Gen [[Ahmad Asiri (general)|Ahmed al-Asiri]], disclaimed responsibility for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34645469|title=Yemen conflict: MSF hospital destroyed by air strikes|date=27 October 2015|publisher=|accessdate=3 February 2017|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"With the hospital destroyed, at least 200,000 people now have no access to lifesaving medical care", MSF said.  "This attack is another illustration of a complete disregard for civilians in Yemen, where bombings have become a daily routine," said Hassan Boucenine, MSF head of mission in Yemen.  The GPS coordinates of the only hospital in the Haydan district were regularly shared with the Saudi-led coalition, and the roof of the facility was clearly identified with the MSF logo, he said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-10/28/c_134756413.htm "MSF hospital in Yemen bombed by airstrike", ''Xinhua'' (2015-10-28)]&lt;/ref&gt; Abdallah al-Mouallimi, the Saudi ambassador to the United Nations, said the coordinates were inaccurate, although he admitted that the airstrike was "a mistake".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.vice.com/article/exclusive-saudi-arabia-admits-bombing-msf-hospital-in-yemen-but-faults-msf|title=Exclusive: Saudi Arabia Admits Bombing MSF Hospital in Yemen — But Faults MSF - VICE News|publisher=|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNICEF said the hospital in Saada was the 39th health center hit in Yemen since March, when the violence escalated. MSF reports that the Saudi-led coalition, supported by the British military, has been bombing hospitals across Yemen for the past 10 months. As many as 130 health facilities have been hit. "More children in Yemen may well die from a lack of medicines and healthcare than from bullets and bombs," its executive director Anthony Lake said in a statement.  He added that critical shortages of fuel, medication, electricity and water could mean many more will close. [[Amnesty International]] said the strike may amount to a war crime and called for an independent investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/27/us-yemen-security-idUSKCN0SL0VK20151027 Noah Browning, "Yemeni MSF hospital bombed, Saudi-led coalition denies responsibility", ''Reuters'' (October 27 2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/10/28/doctors-without-borders-says-saudi-led-airstrikes-bomb-yemen-hospital/ "Doctors Without Borders says Saudi-led airstrikes bomb Yemen hospital", ''Associated Press'' (October 28, 2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===December 2015 - Taiz airstrike===
On December 3, 2015 an airstrike by the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]] hit a health center in [[Taiz]], wounding nine people. Two hospital staff were among the wounded.  "The bombing of civilians and hospitals is a violation of international humanitarian law," said Jerome Alin, head of MSF head of mission in Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/yemen-nine-wounded-saudi-led-coalition-airstrike-msf-clinic-taiz|title=Yemen: Nine Wounded in Saudi-Led Coalition Airstrike on MSF Clinic in Taiz|date=3 December 2015|publisher=|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/msf-supported-hospital-bombed-northern-yemen  "MSF-Supported Hospital Bombed in Northern Yemen", MSF (Update January 11 2016)].&lt;/ref&gt;
===January 2016 - Razeh district airstrike===
On January 10, 2016, Shiara Hospital, supported by MSF in Razeh district, [[Saada Governorate]], Northern Yemen, was hit by a projectile and shrapnel from the Saudi-led coalition.

'''Archetypal literary criticism''' is a type of [[critical theory]] that interprets a text by focusing on recurring [[mythology|myths]] and archetypes (from the Greek ''archē'', "beginning", and ''typos'', "imprint") in the [[narrative]], [[symbols]], [[image]]s, and character types in literary work. As a form of literary criticism, it dates back to 1934 when [[Maud Bodkin]] published ''[[Archetypal Patterns in Poetry]]''.

Archetypal literary criticism's origins are rooted in two other academic disciplines, [[social anthropology]] and [[psychoanalysis]]; each contributed to literary criticism in separate ways, with the latter being a sub-branch of critical theory. Archetypal criticism was at its most popular in the 1940s and 1950s, largely due to the work of Canadian literary critic [[Northrop Frye]]. Though archetypal literary criticism is no longer widely practiced, nor have there been any major developments in the field, it still has a place in the tradition of literary studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Devika|first1=S.|title=Archetypal Criticism|url=https://drdevika.wordpress.com/2016/11/02/archetypal-criticism/|website=Dr. S.

==Origins==

===Frazer===
The anthropological origins of archetypal criticism can pre-date its analytical psychology origins by over 30 years. ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890–1915), written by the Scottish anthropologist [[Sir James George Frazer]], was the first influential text dealing with cultural mythologies. Frazer was part of a group of comparative anthropologists working out of [[Cambridge University]] who worked extensively on the topic. ''The Golden Bough'' was widely accepted as the seminal text on myth that spawned numerous studies on the same subject. Eventually, the momentum of Frazer's work carried over into literary studies.

In ''The Golden Bough'' Frazer identifies practices and mythological beliefs shared among primitive religions and modern religions. Frazer argues that the death-rebirth myth is present in almost all cultural mythologies, and is acted out in terms of growing seasons and vegetation. The myth is symbolized by the death (i.e., final harvest) and rebirth (i.e., spring) of the god of vegetation. As an example, Frazer cites the Greek myth of [[Persephone]], who was taken to the [[Underworld]] by [[Hades]]. Her mother [[Demeter]], the goddess of the harvest, was so sad that she struck the world with fall and winter. While in the underworld [[Persephone]] ate six of the twelve pomegranate seeds given to her by Hades; consequently, she was forced to spend half the year, from then on, in the Underworld, representative of autumn and winter, or the death in the death-rebirth myth.  The other half of the year Persephone was permitted to be with Demeter in the mortal realm, which represents spring and summer, or the rebirth in the death-rebirth myth.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

===Jung===
While Frazer's work deals with mythology and archetypes in material terms, the work of [[Carl Gustav Jung]], the Swiss-born founder of analytical psychology, is, in contrast, immaterial in its focus. Jung's work theorizes about myths and archetypes in relation to the [[Collective unconscious|unconscious]], an inaccessible part of the mind. From a Jungian perspective, myths are the "culturally elaborated representations of the contents of the deepest recess of the human psyche: the world of the archetypes" (Walker 4).

Jungian analytical psychology distinguishes between the personal and [[collective unconscious]], the latter being particularly relevant to archetypal criticism. The collective unconscious, or the [[objective psyche]] as it is less frequently known, is a number of innate thoughts, feelings, instincts, and memories that reside in the unconsciousness of all people. Jung's definition of the term is inconsistent in his many writings. At one time he calls the collective unconscious the "a priori, inborn forms of intuition" (Lietch 998), while in another instance it is a series of "experience(s) that come upon us like fate" (998). Regardless of the many nuances between Jung's definitions, the collective unconsciousness is a shared part of the unconscious.

To Jung, an archetype in the collective unconscious, as quoted from Leitch et al., is "irrepresentable, but has effects which make visualizations of it possible, namely, the archetypal images and ideas" (988), due to the fact they are at an inaccessible part of the  mind. The archetypes to which Jung refers are represented through primordial images, a term he coined. Primordial images originate from the initial stages of humanity and have been part of the collective unconscious ever since. It is through primordial images that universal archetypes are experienced, and more importantly, that the unconscious is revealed.

With the same death-rebirth myth that Frazer sees as being representative of the growing seasons and agriculture as a point of comparison, a Jungian analysis envisions the death-rebirth archetype as a "symbolic expression of a process taking place not in the world but in the mind. That process is the return of the [[Ego, super-ego, and id|ego]] to the unconscious—a kind of temporary death of the ego—and its re-emergence, or rebirth, from the unconscious" (Segal 4).

By itself, Jung's theory of the collective unconscious accounts for a considerable share of writings in archetypal literary criticism; it also pre-dates the height of archetypal literary criticism by over a decade. The Jungian archetypal approach treats literary texts as an avenue in which primordial images are represented. It would not be until the 1950s when the other branch of archetypal literary criticism developed.

===Frye===
Bodkin's ''Archetypal Patterns in Poetry'', the first work on the subject of archetypal literary criticism, applies Jung's theories about the collective unconscious, archetypes, and primordial images to literature. It was not until the work of the Canadian literary critic [[Northrop Frye]] that archetypal criticism was theorized in purely literary terms. The major work of Frye's to deal with archetypes is ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]''
but his essay "The Archetypes of Literature" is a precursor to the book. Frye's thesis in "The Archetypes of Literature" remains largely unchanged in ''Anatomy of Criticism''. Frye's work helped displace [[New Criticism]] as the major mode of analyzing literary texts, before giving way to [[structuralism]] and [[semiotics]].

Frye's work breaks from both Frazer and Jung in such a way that it is distinct from its anthropological and psychoanalytical precursors. For Frye, the death-rebirth myth, that Frazer sees manifest in agriculture and the harvest, is not ritualistic since it is involuntary, and therefore, must be done. As for Jung, Frye was uninterested about the collective unconscious on the grounds of feeling it was unnecessary: since the unconscious is unknowable it cannot be studied. How archetypes came to be was also of no concern to Frye; rather, the function and effect of archetypes is his interest. For Frye, literary archetypes "play an essential role in refashioning the material universe into an alternative verbal universe that is humanly intelligible and viable, because it is adapted to essential human needs and concerns" (Abrams 224-225).

There are two basic categories in Frye's framework, comedic and tragic. Each category is further subdivided into two categories: [[comedy]] and [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] for the comedic; [[tragedy]] and [[satire]] (or ironic) for the tragic. Though he is dismissive of Frazer, Frye uses the seasons in his archetypal schema. Each season is aligned with a literary genre: comedy with spring, romance with summer, tragedy with autumn, and satire with winter.

Comedy is aligned with spring because the genre of comedy is characterized by the birth of the hero, revival and [[resurrection]]. Also, spring symbolizes the defeat of winter and darkness. Romance and summer are paired together because summer is the culmination of life in the seasonal calendar, and the romance genre culminates with some sort of triumph, usually a marriage. Autumn is the dying stage of the seasonal calendar, which parallels the tragedy genre because it is, above all, known for the "fall" or demise of the protagonist. Satire is [[Metonymy|metonymized]] with winter on the grounds that satire is a "dark" genre; satire is a disillusioned and mocking form of the three other genres. It is noted for its darkness, dissolution, the return of chaos, and the defeat of the heroic figure.

Summer – Romance. The birth of the hero.
Autumn – Tragedy. Movement towards the death or defeat of the hero.
Winter – Irony/Satire. The hero is absent. 
Spring – Comedy. The rebirth of the hero.

The context of a genre determines how a symbol or image is to be interpreted. Frye outlines five different spheres in his schema: human, animal, vegetation, mineral, and water. The comedic human world is representative of wish-fulfillment and being community centred. In contrast, the tragic human world is of isolation, tyranny, and the fallen hero. Animals in the comedic genres are docile and pastoral (e.g. sheep), while animals are predatory and hunters in the tragic (e.g. wolves). For the realm of vegetation, the comedic is, again, pastoral but also represented by gardens, parks, roses and lotuses. As for the tragic, vegetation is of a wild forest, or as being barren. Cities, a temple, or precious stones represent the comedic mineral realm. The tragic mineral realm is noted for being a [[desert]], [[ruins]], or "of sinister geometrical images" (Frye 1456). Lastly, the water realm is represented by rivers in the comedic. With the tragic, the seas, and especially [[floods]], signify the water sphere.

Frye admits that his schema in "The Archetypes of Literature" is simplistic, but makes room for exceptions by noting that there are neutral archetypes. The example he cites are islands such as [[Circe]]'s or [[Prospero]]'s which cannot be categorized under the tragic or comedic.

==Other contributors==
Maud Bodkin wrote ''Archetypal Patterns in Poetry'' in 1934, applying the ideas of Jung to poetry, and examining archetypes such as the ancient mariner and rebirth, heaven and hell, images of the devil, the hero and God. 
Bodkin book.

In his 1949 book ''Hero with a Thousand Faces'', [[Joseph Campbell]] pioneered the idea of the ‘monomyth' (though the term was borrowed from James Joyce), a universal pattern in heroic tales across different cultures and genres. His deep examination of the eight step hero's journey (and the common variations that exist) had a huge impact on the Abstract Expressionists of the 1950s, and continues to inspire creative artists today.

==Theory critiques==
It has been argued that Frye's version of archetypal criticism strictly categorizes works based on their genres, which determines how an archetype is to be interpreted in a text. According to this argument the dilemma Frye's archetypal criticism faces with more [[contemporary literature]], and that of [[post-modernism]] in general, is that genres and categories are no longer distinctly separate and that the very concept of genres has become blurred, thus problematizing Frye's schema. For instance [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]]'s ''[[Waiting For Godot]]'' is considered a [[tragicomedy]], a play with elements of tragedy and satire, with the implication that interpreting textual elements in the play becomes difficult as  the two opposing seasons and conventions that Frye associated with genres are pitted against each other. But in fact arguments about generic blends such as tragicomedy go back to the [[Renaissance]], and Frye always conceived of genres as fluid. Frye thought literary forms were part of a great circle and were capable of shading into other generic forms. (He contemplated including a diagram of his wheel in ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'' but thought better of it.)Myth and archetype deals with origin of literary.

== Examples of archetypes in literature ==
* [[Femme fatale|Femme Fatale]]: A female character type who brings upon catastrophic and disastrous events. [[Adam and Eve|Eve]] from the story of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] or [[Pandora]] from Greek mythology are two such figures.
* The Journey: A narrative archetype where the protagonist must overcome a series of obstacles before reaching his or her goal. The quintessential journey archetype in Western culture is arguably [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]''.

Archetypal symbols vary more than archetype narratives or character types. The best archetypal pattern is any symbol with deep roots in a culture's mythology, such as the [[forbidden fruit]] in Genesis or even the poison apple in [[Snow White]]. These are examples of symbols that resonate with archetypal critics.

Archetypes reveal shared roles among universal societies. This archetype may create a shared imaginary which is defined by many stereotypes that have not separated themselves from the traditional, biological, religious and mythical framework.

{{Tort law}}
'''Assumption of risk''' is a [[defense (legal)|defense]] in the [[law]] of [[tort]]s, which bars or reduces a [[plaintiff]]'s right to recovery against a negligent [[tortfeasor]] if the [[defendant]] can demonstrate that the plaintiff voluntarily and knowingly assumed the risks at issue inherent to the dangerous activity in which he was participating at the time of his or her injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vargo|first1=John F.|title=Comparative Fault: A Need for Reform of Indiana Tort Law|journal=Indiana Law Review|date=1978|volume=11|page=832|url=https://journals.iupui.edu/index.php/inlawrev/article/viewFile/2310/2192|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What is usually meant by assumption of risk is more precisely termed ''primary'' or "express" assumption of risk. It occurs when the plaintiff has either expressly or implicitly relieved the defendant of the [[duty]] to mitigate or relieve the risk causing the injury from which the cause of action arises. It operates as a complete bar to liability on the theory that upon assumption of the risk, there is no longer a [[duty of care]] running from the defendant to the plaintiff; without a duty owed by the defendant, there can be no negligence on his part.&lt;ref&gt;''Knight v. Jewett'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C4/3C4t296.htm 3 Cal. 4th 296], 314-315 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, primary assumption of risk is not a blanket exemption from liability for the operators of a dangerous activity.  The ''specific'' risk causing the injury must have been known to, and appreciated by, the plaintiff in order for primary assumption of risk to apply.  Also, assumption of risk does not absolve a defendant of liability for reckless conduct.&lt;ref&gt;''Cheong v. Antablin'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C4/16C4t1063.htm 16 Cal. 4th 1067] (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;  

This defense is commonly asserted in cases of injuries occurring during risky recreational activities, such as skiing, paragliding, and scuba diving, but actually extends to all dangerous activities.  Thus, for example, it was held that a visitor to the [[Burning Man]] festival assumed the risk of getting [[burn]]ed.&lt;ref&gt;''Beninati v. Black Rock City, LLC'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/CA4/175CA4t650.htm 175 Cal. App. 4th 650] (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Secondary'' assumption of risk is a rather different doctrine akin in some respects to [[comparative negligence]]. The difference was explained by the Supreme Court of California as follows: 

{{cquote|In cases involving 'primary assumption of risk'—where, by virtue of the nature of the activity and the parties' relationship to the activity, the defendant owes no legal duty to protect the plaintiff from the particular risk of harm that caused the injury—the doctrine continues to operate as a complete bar to the plaintiff's recovery. In cases involving 'secondary assumption of risk'—where the defendant does owe a duty of care to the plaintiff, but the plaintiff proceeds to encounter a known risk imposed by the defendant's breach of duty—the doctrine is merged into the comparative fault scheme, and the trier of fact, in apportioning the loss resulting from the injury, may consider the relative responsibility of the parties.&lt;ref&gt;''Knight'', 3 Cal. 4th at 314-315.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Beet vascular necrosis''' and '''rot''' is a soft rot disease caused by the bacterium '''''Pectobacterium carotovorum'' subsp. ''betavasculorum''''', which has also been known as ''Pectobacterium betavasculorum'' and ''Erwinia carotovora'' subsp. ''betavasculorum''.&lt;ref name=Compendium2 /&gt; It was classified in the [[genus]] ''Erwinia'' until genetic evidence suggested that it belongs to its own group;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dye|first=DW|title=A taxonomic study of the genus Erwinia. II. The "carotovora" group|journal=New Zealand Journal of Science|year=1969|volume=12|pages=81–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the name Erwinia is still in use. As such, the disease is sometimes called Erwinia rot today. It is a very destructive disease that has been reported across the United States as well as in Egypt. Symptoms include [[wilting]] and black streaks on the leaves and [[Petiole (botany)|petioles]]. It is usually not fatal to the plant, but in severe cases the beets will become hollowed and unmarketable. The bacteria is a [[generalist species]] which rots beets and other plants by secreting digestive enzymes that break down the [[cell wall]] and [[parenchyma]] tissues.&lt;ref name=Ecology/&gt; The bacteria thrive in warm and wet conditions, but cannot survive long in fallow soil.&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt;&lt;ref name=DescriptionEtiology /&gt; However, it is able to persist for long periods of time in the [[rhizosphere]] of weeds and non-host crops.&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ch11Handbook /&gt; While it is difficult to eradicate, there are cultural practices that can be used to control the spread of the disease, such as avoiding injury to the plants and reducing or eliminating application of nitrogen fertilizer.

== Hosts ==

Fodder beets, [[sugar beets]] and fodder-sugar crosses are all susceptible to infection by ''Pectobacterium carotovorum'' subsp. ''betavasculorum''.&lt;ref name=Compendium2&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=E.D |editor1-last=Whitney |title=Compendium of Beet Diseases and Insects |edition=2nd |year=1986 |publisher=American Phytopathological Society |location=St. Paul, MN }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today most beet [[cultivars]] are resistant to the pathogen, however, isolates vary geographically, and some cultivars of beets are only resistant to specific isolates of bacteria. For example, the cultivar USH11 demonstrates resistance to both Montana  and California isolates, whereas Beta 4430 is highly susceptible to the Montana isolates but resistant to the California isolate.&lt;ref name=Zidack&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zidack|first=Nina|author2=Barry Jacobsen|title=First Report and Virulence Evaluation of Erwinia caratovora subs. Betavasculorum on Sugarbeet in Montana|journal=Plant Health Progress|year=2001|url=http://www.plantmanagementnetwork.org/pub/php/research/sugarbeet/|accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other cultivars resistant to California isolates of ''Pectobacterium caratovorum'' subsp. ''betavasculorum'' include Beta 4776R, Beta 4430R and Beta 4035R, but HH50 has been found to be susceptible.&lt;ref name=Zidack /&gt;

Breeding for resistance to other diseases such as [[beet yellows virus]] without also selecting for vascular necrosis resistance can leave cultivars susceptible to the pathogen. For example, the use of USH9A and H9B in California’s San Joaquin valley is thought to have led to an epiphytotic (severe) outbreak of disease in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=WhitneyLewellen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitney|first=E.D.|author2=R.T. Lewellen |title=Bacterial Vascular Necrosis and Rot of Sugar Beet: Effects on Cultivars and Quality|journal=Phytopathology |year=1977|volume=67|issue=10|pages=912–916|doi=10.1094/phyto-67-912}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was likely because of the limited gene pool used when selecting strongly for resistance to beet yellows virus. Further information on resistant cultivars can be found in the section [[#Management|Management]].

In addition to beets, ''Pectobacterium carotovara'' subsp. ''betavasculorum'' can also infect tomato, potato, carrots, sweet potato, radish, sunflower, artichokes, squash, cucumber and chrysanthemum.&lt;ref name=Compendium2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ch11Handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=Egypt /&gt;  Other [[subspecies]] of ''Pectobacterium carotovora'' can also be [[pathogenic]] to beets. ''Erwinia carotovara'' subsp. ''atroseptica'' is a bacterial soft rot pathogen that is responsible for the disease Blackleg of Potato (''Solanum tuberosum''), and variants of this bacterium can cause root rot in sugarbeets,.&lt;ref name=DeBoer&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Boer|first=Solke H.|title=Blackleg of Potato|journal=The Plant Health Instructor|year=2004|url=http://www.plantmanagementnetwork.org/pub/php/research/sugarbeet/|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=deMendonca&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Mendonca|first=Margarida|author2=M.E. Stanghellini |title=Endemic and Soilborne Nature of Erwinia Carotovora var. atroseptica, a pathogen of Mature Sugarbeets|journal=Ecology and Epidemiology |year=1979|volume=69|issue=10|pages=1093–1099|doi=10.1094/phyto-69-1096}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This subspecies also has a wide host-range. ''Erwinia carotovora'' var. ''atroseptica'' has been detected in the rhizosphere of native vegetation and on weed species such as ''Lupinus blumerii'' and ''Amaranthus palmeri'' (pigweed).&lt;ref name=deMendonca /&gt;  It is thought that the source of inoculums survives on these non-host plants in areas in which it is endemic as well as in the rhizosphere of other crops such as wheat and corn&lt;ref name=deMendonca /&gt;

== Symptoms ==

[[File:Pectobacterium Table Beet Stem.jpg|thumb|right|Table beet stem infected with ''Pectobacterium carotovorum'' subsp. ''betavasculorum''. Note entry through a wound.]]

Symptoms can be found on both beet roots and foliage, although foliar symptoms are not always present. If present, foliar symptoms include dark streaking along petioles and viscous froth deposits on the crown which are a by-product of bacterial metabolism.&lt;ref name=Strasbaugh&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strausbaugh|first=Carl A.|author2=Anne M. Gillen|title=Bacterial and yeast associated with sugar beet root rot at harvest in the Intermountain West|journal=Plant Disease|year=2008|volume=92|issue=3|pages=357–363|doi=10.1094/pdis-92-3-0357}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Petioles can also become necrotic and demonstrate vascular necrosis. When roots become severely affected, wilting also occurs.&lt;ref name=Compendium2/&gt;  Below ground symptoms include both soft and dry root rot. Affected vascular bundles in roots become necrotic and brown, and tissue adjacent to necrosis becomes pink upon air contact.&lt;ref name=Compendium2/&gt;  The plants that do not die completely may have rotted-out, cavernous roots.

Various pathogens can cause root rot in beets; however the black streaking on petioles and necrotic vascular bundles in roots and adjacent pink tissue help to distinguish this disease from others such as Fusarium Yellows. Additionally, sampling from the rhizosphere of infected plants and serological tests can confirm the presence of ''Erwinia caratovora'' subs.&lt;ref name=deMendonca /&gt;

==Disease cycle==

''Pectobacterium carotovorum'' subsp. ''betavasculorum'' is a [[gram negative]], rod bacteria with peritichous [[flagella]].&lt;ref name=Compendium&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=R.M. |editor1-last=Haverson |title=Compendium of Beet Diseases and Pests |edition=2nd |year=2009 |publisher=American Phytopathological Society |location=St. Paul, MN |pages=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; For it to enter sugar beet, and thus cause infection, it is essential that there is an injury to the leaves, petioles or crown.&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ch11Handbook&gt;{{cite web|title=Sugar Beet Production Guide, Chapter 11: Disease Management, pg 138-139|url=http://www.ianrpubs.unl.edu/epublic/live/ec156/build/ec156-11.pdf|publisher=University of Nebraska – Lincoln Extension, 2013|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infection will often start at the crown and then move down into the root, and can occur at any point in the growing season if environmental conditions are favorable.&lt;ref name=DescriptionEtiology&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomson|first=S.V.|title=Beet Vascular Necrosis and Rot of Sugarbeet: General Description and Etiology|journal=Phytopathology|year=1977|volume=67|issue=10|pages=1183–1189|url=http://www.apsnet.org/publications/phytopathology/backissues/Documents/1977Articles/Phyto67n10_1183.pdf|accessdate=17 October 2013|doi=10.1094/phyto-67-1183|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Once the bacteria enters the plant, it will invade the [[vascular tissue]] and cause symptoms by producing plant cell wall degrading enzymes, like pectinases, polygalactronases, and celluases.&lt;ref name=Molecular&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=H.-S.|title=Pectobacterium carotovorum Elicits Plant Cell Death with DspE/F but the P. carotovorum DspE Does Not Suppress Callose or Induce Expression of Plant Genes Early in Plant–Microbe Interactions|journal=Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions|year=2011|volume=24|issue=7|pages=773–786|doi=10.1094/mpmi-06-10-0143|pmid=21469936|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in discolored or necrotic vascular tissue in the root, and the tissue bordering the vascular bundles will turn reddish upon contact with air.&lt;ref name=DescriptionEtiology /&gt; Following the infection of the vascular tissue, the bacteria reproduce as long as food resources are available, and the root begins to rot.&lt;ref name=DescriptionEtiology /&gt; There is significant variability in the type of rot – it can range from a dry rot to soft and [[wet rot]] – because of the multitude of additional microorganisms that may colonize the damaged tissue&lt;ref name=DescriptionEtiology /&gt;

Upon death of the sugar beet, or harvest of the field, the pathogen appears to survive in select living plant tissue like beet roots,&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt; or volunteer beets.&lt;ref name=Ch11Handbook /&gt; However, it does not appear to survive in sugar beet seeds,&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt;&lt;ref name=DescriptionEtiology /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ch11Handbook /&gt; or live in the soil after harvest.&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt;&lt;ref name=DescriptionEtiology /&gt; It is also possible for the pathogen to infect injured carrots, potato, sweet potato, tomato, radish, sunflower, artichokes, squash, cucumber and chrysanthemums;&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ch11Handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=Egypt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saleh|first=O.I. |author2=Huang, P.-Y. |author3=J.-S. Huang|title=Bacterial Vascular Necrosis and Root Rot Disease of Sugar Beet in Egypt|journal=Journal of Phytopathology|year=1996|volume=144|issue=5|pages=225–230–1189|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0434.1996.tb01520.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, since those are often planted in the same season as sugar beets, they are not likely to be overwintering hosts.

== Environment ==

Injury to the leaves, petioles or crown is mandatory for the [[pathogen]] to gain entry to the host tissue.&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ch11Handbook /&gt;  Accordingly, [[hail]] damage is correlated with a higher degree of disease outbreak.&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt; Young plants (less than eight weeks old) are also considered to be more prone to infection&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ch11Handbook /&gt;

Temperature and availability of moisture are key factors in determining the rate of disease development. Warm temperatures, 25-30&amp;nbsp;°C, promote rapid disease development.,&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ch11Handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=PNDH /&gt; and can result in acute symptoms.&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt; Symptoms are also reported to appear at temperatures as low as 18&amp;nbsp;°C, but disease development is slowed;&lt;ref name=DescriptionEtiology /&gt; below that temperature, infections do not develop.&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt; Excessive water also promotes disease development by providing a more optimal environment for the pathogen,&lt;ref name=PNDH /&gt; and has been shown to be a key factor in augmenting disease outbreak in fields with sprinkler irrigation&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt;

===Agricultural===

The degree of [[nitrogen fertilization]] is highly correlated to robust disease development: it has been shown that sugar beets supplied with excessive or adequate nitrogen are more diseased than sugarbeets with sub-optimal nitrogen levels.&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ch11Handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=PNDH /&gt; This is a paradox for farmers because, while increased nitrogen fertilization does increase sugar yield in non-infected sugarbeets, it also increases the severity of the disease if infection takes place. Thus, depending on the severity of infection, yield may go down with increased fertilizer use.&lt;ref name=Spacing&amp;N /&gt;

The spacing between plants also impacts the degree of infection: greater in-row spacing results in more diseased roots.&lt;ref name=Spacing&amp;N /&gt; This may be due to the fact that greater spacing promotes faster growth, and hence greater probability of cracks in the crown,&lt;ref name=Ch11Handbook /&gt; or because of the increased amount of nitrogen available per plant.&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt;

Since the pathogen has multiple hosts, it is important for farmers to be wary of other plants in the surrounding area. It is possible for the pathogen to survive in weedy hosts, and can infect injured carrots, potato, sweet potato, tomato, radish, squash, and cucumber.&lt;ref name=Ch11Handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=Egypt /&gt;&lt;ref name=PNDH /&gt; Hence, the presence of these plants may increase the supply of inoculum.

===Laboratory===

If the pathogen is cultured in a lab, it can grow on Miller and Schroth media, can use sucrose to make reducing sugars, and can use either lactose, methyl alpha-glucoside, inulin or raffinose to make acids.&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt; It is also capable of surviving in culture medium sodium levels of up to 7–9%,&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt; and in temperatures  as high as 39&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=PotatovSB&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stanghellini|first=M.E.|title=Serological and Physiological Differences of Erwinia carotovora between Potato and Sugar Beet|journal=Phytopathology|year=1977|volume=67|issue=10|pages=1178–1182|url=https://www.apsnet.org/publications/phytopathology/backissues/Documents/1977Articles/Phyto67n10_1178.PDFf|accessdate=17 October 2013|doi=10.1094/phyto-67-1178|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==

Since the bacteria cannot survive in seeds,&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ch11Handbook /&gt; the best way to prevent the disease is to ensure that [[vegetatively propagated]] plant material are clean of infection, such that the bacterium does not enter the soil. However, if the bacteria is already present, there are some methods that can be used to lessen the infection.

===Cultural practices===

Because the bacteria readily enter the plant through wounds, management practices that decrease injury to the plants are important to control the spread of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gallian|first=John J.|title=Management of Sugarbeet Root Rots|url=http://www.cals.uidaho.edu/edcomm/pdf/PNW/PNW0538.pdf|publisher=Pacific Northwest Extension|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultivation is not recommended, as the machinery can become contaminated and physically spread the bacteria around the soil. Accidental leaf tearing or root scarring can also occur depending on the size of the crop, allowing the bacteria to enter more individual plants. If [[hilling]] the beets, great care must be taken to avoid getting soil into the crown,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UC Pest Management Guidelines|url=http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/r735101111.html|publisher=University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the pathogen is soil-borne and this could expose the plant to more bacteria, thus increasing the risk of infection.

While most bacteria are motile and can swim, they cannot move very far due to their small size. However, they can be carried along by water, and a significant movement of ''Pectobacterium'' can be attributed to being carried downstream from irrigation and rainwater.&lt;ref name=Ecology&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perombelon|first=Michel CM|author2=Kelman, Arthur|title=Ecology of the soft rot erwinias|journal=Annual Review of Phytopathology|year=1980|volume=18|issue=1|pages=361–387|doi=10.1146/annurev.py.18.090180.002045}}&lt;/ref&gt; To control the spread of the disease, limiting irrigation is another strategy. The bacteria also flourishes in wet conditions, so limiting excess water can control both the spread and severity of the disease.

Increased in-row spacing also causes more severe disease. In an infected field, yield decreased linearly when spacing was greater than 15&amp;nbsp;cm (6&amp;nbsp;in),&lt;ref name=Spacing&amp;N&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomson|first=S V|author2=Hills, F. J.|author3=Whitney, E. D.|author4=Schroth, M. N.|title=Sugar and root yield of sugar beets as affected by bacterial vascular necrosis and rot, nitrogen fertilization, and plant spacing|journal=Phytopathology|year=1981|volume=71|issue=6|pages=605–608|url=http://www.apsnet.org/publications/phytopathology/backissues/Documents/1981Articles/Phyto71n06_605.pdf|accessdate=17 October 2013|doi=10.1094/phyto-71-605}}&lt;/ref&gt; so a spacing of 6 inches or less is recommended.

The bacteria can also utilize nitrogen fertilizer to accelerate their growth, thus limiting or eliminating the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied will lessen the disease severity.&lt;ref name=PNDH&gt;{{cite web|title=Sugar Beet (Beta vulgaris)-Bacterial Vascular Necrosis and Rot {Erwinia Root Rot}|url=http://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/sugar-beet-beta-vulgaris-bacterial-vascular-necrosis-and-rot-erwinia-root-rot|publisher=pacific northwest plant disease management handbook|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when fertilizer was applied to an infected field the infection rate per root increased from 11% (with no added nitrogen) to 36% (with 336&amp;nbsp;kg nitrogen/hectare), and sugar yields decreased.&lt;ref name=Spacing&amp;N /&gt;

===Resistance===

The bacteria can survive in the rhizosphere of other crops such as tomato, carrots, sweet potato, radish, and squash&lt;ref name=Compendium2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Compendium /&gt; as well as weed plants like lupin and pigweed,&lt;ref name=deMendonca /&gt; so it is very hard to get rid of it completely.&lt;ref name=Ecology/&gt; When it is known that the bacterium is present in the soil, planting resistant varieties can be the best defense against the disease. Many available beet cultivars are resistant to ''Pectobacterium carotovorum'' subsp. ''betavasculorum'', and some examples are provided in the corresponding table. A comprehensive list is maintained by the USDA on the Germplasm Resources Information Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Germplasm Resources Information Network|url=http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/desc.pl?49076|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even though some genes associated with root defense response have been identified, the specific mechanism of resistance is unknown, and it is currently being researched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smigocki|first=A C|title=Molecular Approaches To Pest And Pathogen Resistance in Sugar Beet|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/research/projects/projects.htm?ACCN_NO=419874&amp;fy=2012|publisher=united states department of agriculture agricultural research service|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological control===

Some [[bacteriophage]]s, viruses that infect bacteria, have been used as effective controls of bacterial diseases in laboratory experiments. This relatively new technology is a promising control method that is currently being researched. Bacteriophages are extremely host-specific, which makes them environmentally sound as they will not destroy other, beneficial soil [[microorganisms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duffy|first=B|title=Biological control of bacterial diseases in field crops|journal=Symposium on Biological Control of Bacterial Plant Diseases|year=2006|pages=93–98|url=http://pub.jki.bund.de/index.php/MittBBA/article/viewFile/709/644..#page=93|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some bacteriophages identified as effective controls of ''Pectobacterium carotovorum'' subsp. ''betavasculorum'' are the strains ΦEcc2 ΦEcc3 ΦEcc9 ΦEcc14. When mixed with a fertilizer and applied to inoculated calla lily bulbs in a greenhouse, they reduced diseased tissue by 40 to 70%.&lt;ref name=phages&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ravensdale|first=M |author2=T.

''carotovorum'', a different bacterial species closely related to the one that causes beet vascular necrosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lim|first=J.A.|author2=Jee S|author3=Lee DH|author4=Roh E|author5=Jung K|author6=Oh C|author7=Heu S.|title=Biocontrol of Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum using bacteriophage PP1.|journal=Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology|year=2013|volume=23|issue=8|pages=1147–1153|doi=10.4014/jmb.1304.04001|pmid=23727798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is more difficult to apply bacteriophages in a field setting, it is not impossible, and laboratory and greenhouse trials are showing bacteriophages to potentially be a very effective control mechanism. However, there are a few obstacles to surmount before field trials can begin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frampton|first=Rebekah A.|author2=Andrew R. Pitman|author3=Peter C. Fineran|title=Advances in Bacteriophage-Mediated Control of Plant Pathogens|journal=International Journal of Microbiology|year=2012|doi=10.1155/2012/326452|pmid=22934116|pmc=3426239|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijmicro/2012/326452/|volume=2012|pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large problem is that they are damaged by UV light, so applying the phage mixture during the evening will help promote its viability. Also, providing the phages with susceptible non-pathogenic bacteria to replicate with can ensure there is adequate persistence until the bacteriophages can spread to the targeted bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Jeffrey B |author2=Gary E.

The disease was first identified in the western states of, California, Washington, Texas, Arizona and Idaho in the 1970s and initially led to substantial yield losses in those areas.&lt;ref name=Spacing&amp;N /&gt; ''Erwinia caratovara'' subsp ''betavascularum'' was not discovered in Montana until 1998.  When it first appeared, beet vascular necrosis caused individual farm yield loss ranging from 5–70% in Montana's Bighorn Valley.&lt;ref name=Zidack /&gt;  Today, yield losses from the disease are generally infrequent and patchy as most producers plant resistant varieties. Infection rate is generally low if resistant cultivars are chosen; however, warmer and wetter conditions can lead to higher than normal instance of disease&lt;ref name=Zidack /&gt;

If infection does occur, bacterial root rots can not only cause economic losses in the field, but also can in storage and processing as well.&lt;ref name=Strasbaugh /&gt;  In processing plants, rotten roots complicate slicing and the bacterially-produced slime can clog filters. This is especially problematic with late-infected beets which are generally harvested and processed along with healthy beets.

'''Bhagavān''' (Sanskrit: {{lang|sa|भगवान्}}, {{IAST|Bhagavān}}) is an epithet for [[deity]], particularly for [[Krishna]] and other [[avatar]]s of [[Vishnu]] in [[Vaishnavism]], as well as for [[Shiva]] in the [[Shaivism]] tradition of [[Hinduism]],&lt;ref name=james&gt;James Lochtefeld (2000), "Bhagavan", The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}, page 94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=friha/&gt; and is used by [[Jains]] to refer to the [[Tirthankara]]s, more particularly [[Mahavira]] and is used by [[Buddhists]] to refer to the [[Buddha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buswell|first1=Robert E.|last2=Lopez|first2=Donald S.|title=The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism|date=2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[north India]], ''Bhagavān'' also represents the concept of abstract God to Hindus who are religious but do not worship a specific deity.&lt;ref name=james/&gt;

The term ''Bhagavān'' does  appear in [[Vedas]], in early or middle [[Upanishad]]s. The oldest Sanskrit texts use the term [[Brahman]] to represent an abstract Supreme Soul, Absolute Reality, while using names of deities like Krishna, Vishnu, Shiva to represent gods and goddesses. The term [[Ishvara]] appears in later Vedas and middle Upanishads where it is used to discuss spiritual concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Monier Williams, Sanskrit-English dictionary, [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/mwquery/ Search for Izvara], University of Cologne, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Ishvara", The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}, page 306&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''Bhagavān'' is found in later era literature, such as the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' and the ''[[Purana]]''s.&lt;ref name=friha&gt;Friedhelm Hardy (1990), The World's Religions: The Religions of Asia, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415058155}}, pages 79-83&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bhakti]] school literature, the term is typically used for any deity to whom prayers are offered; for example, [[Rama]], [[Ganesha]], [[Kartikeya]], Krishna, Shiva or Vishnu. Often the deity is the devotee's one and only Bhagavan.&lt;ref name=friha/&gt; Bhagavan is male in Bhakti traditions, and the female equivalent of Bhagavān is [[Bhagavati|Bhagavatī]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedhelm Hardy (1990), The World's Religions: The Religions of Asia, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415058155}}, page 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Caldwell (1998), Bhagavati, in Devi: Goddesses of India (Editors: John Stratton Hawley, Donna Marie Wulff), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814912}}, pages 195-198&lt;/ref&gt; To some Hindus the word Bhagavan is an abstract, genderless God concept.

In Buddhism's [[Pali Canon|Pali scriptures]], the term is used with [[Gautama Buddha]], referring to him as ''Bhagavān Buddha'' (translated with the phrase 'Lord Buddha' or 'The Blessed One') and ''Bhagavān Shakyamuni''.&lt;ref&gt;The latter term preferred by Bhikkhu Bodhi in his English translations of the Pali Canon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ju-Hyung Rhi (1994), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3250056 From Bodhisattva to Buddha: The Beginning of Iconic Representation in Buddhist Art], Artibus Asiae, Vol. 54, No. 3/4, pages 207-225&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Bhagavān'' is also found in other [[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana|Tantra]] Buddhist texts.&lt;ref name=johncampbell/&gt;&lt;ref name=peterharvey/&gt;

Bhagavān is generally translated as ''idol''. In modern usage, ''Bhagavān'' is synonymous with ''Ishvara'', ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|Devatā]]'', ''[[Hari]]'' or ''[[Prabhu]]'', in some schools of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=apte/&gt; Bhagavan is alternatively spelled as ''Bhagvān'', ''Bhagwan'' or ''Bhagawan''. The word is, in some sects, used as an honorific title for a spiritual leader considered fully enlightened by the sect. The word is also a proper noun and used as a first name for boys.

==Etymology and meaning==
''Bhagavān'' literally means "fortunate, blessed" (from the noun ''{{IAST|[[bhaga]]}}'', meaning "fortune, wealth", cognate to Slavic ''{{lang|sla-Latn|bog}}'' "[[Bog (disambiguation)|god]]", Polish ''bogaty'' Serbo-Croatian ''bogat'', Russian ''{{lang|ru|богатый}} (bogatyj)'' "wealthy"), and hence "illustrious, divine, venerable, holy", etc.&lt;ref name="MD"&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/romadict.pl?query=bhagavat&amp;display=simple&amp;table=macdonell Macdonell Sanskrit-English dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' defines ''Bhagavān'' as follows,
{{quote|
&lt;nowiki&gt;
उत्पत्तिं प्रलयं चैव भूतानामागतिं गतिम् |&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
वेत्तिं विद्यामविद्यां च स वाच्यो भगवानिति ||&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He who understands the creation and dissolution, the appearance and disappearance of beings, the wisdom and ignorance, should be called ''Bhagavān''.
|Vishnu Purana, VI.5.78 &lt;ref&gt;[[Alain Daniélou]], The Myths and Gods of India, Princeton/Bollingen Paperbacks, {{ISBN|978-0892813544}}, page 36&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The same text defines [[Bhaga]] and provides the etymological roots as follows as translated by Wilson,&lt;ref name=hhwilson/&gt;
{{quote|
Knowledge is of two kinds, that which is derived from scripture, and that which is derived from reflection. Brahma that is the word is composed of scripture; Brahma that is supreme is produced of reflection. Ignorance is utter darkness, in which knowledge, obtained through any sense (as that of hearing), shines like a lamp; but the knowledge that is derived from reflection breaks upon the obscurity like the sun. (...) That which is imperceptible, undecaying, inconceivable, unborn, inexhaustible, indescribable; which has neither form, nor hands, nor feet; which is almighty, omnipresent, eternal; the cause of all things, and without cause; permeating all, itself unpenetrated, and from which all things proceed; that is the object which the wise behold, that is Brahma, that is the supreme state, that is the subject of contemplation to those who desire liberation, that is the thing spoken of by the Vedas, the infinitely subtile, supreme condition of '''Vishnu'''.

That essence of the supreme is defined by the term Bhagavat. The word Bhagavat is the denomination of that primeval and eternal god: and he who fully understands the meaning of that expression, is possessed of holy wisdom, the sum and substance of the Vedas. The word Bhagavat is a convenient form to be used in the adoration of that supreme being, to whom no term is applicable; and therefore Bhagavat expresses that supreme spirit, which is individual, almighty, and the cause of causes of all things. The letter '''Bh''' implies the cherisher and supporter of the universe. By '''ga''' is understood the leader, impeller, or creator. The disyllable '''Bhaga''' indicates the six properties, dominion, might, glory, splendour, wisdom, and dispassion. The purport of the letter '''va''' is that elemental spirit in which all beings exist, and which exists in all beings. And thus this great word '''Bhagavan''' is the name of Vásudeva, who is one with the supreme Brahma, and of no one else. This word therefore, which is the general denomination of an adorable object, is not used in reference to the supreme in a general, but a special signification. When applied to any other (thing or person) it is used in its customary or general import. In the latter case it may purport one who knows the origin and end and revolutions of beings, and what is wisdom, what ignorance. In the former it denotes wisdom, energy, power, dominion, might, glory, without end, and without defect.
|Vishnu Purana, VI.5 &lt;ref name=hhwilson&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/vp/vp160.htm The Vishnu Purana] HH Wilson (Translator)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bhagavan is related to the root ''Bhaj'' (भज्, "to revere, adore"), and implies someone "glorious, illustrious, revered, venerable, divine, holy (an epithet applied to gods, holy or respectable personages)".&lt;ref name=apte&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=V.S.Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|page=118|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The root ''Bhaj'' also means "share with, partake of, aportion".&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=bhaj&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 bhaj], Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=francixc&gt;Francis  Clooney and Tony Stewart, in S Mittal and GR Thursby (Editors): The Hindu World, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415215277}}, pages 163-178&lt;/ref&gt; Clooney and Stewart state that this root, in Vaishnava traditions, implies Bhagavan as one perfect creator that a devotee seeks to partake from, share his place with, by living in god, in the way of god, the loving participation between the two being its own reward.&lt;ref name=francixc/&gt;

[[Buddha]] is referred to as Bhagavan in ancient and medieval Theravada, Mahayana and Tantra Buddhist texts, where it connotes, "Lord, Blessed One, Fortunate One".&lt;ref name=peterharvey&gt;Peter Harvey, Buddhism, Bloomsbury Academic, {{ISBN|978-0826453501}}, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D Keown (2008), A Dictionary of Buddhism, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0192800626}}, page 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alexwayman/&gt;

==Hinduism==

===Literature===
The Vedic texts neither mention nor provide a basis to explain the origin of the ''Bhagavān'' concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World’s Religions|publisher=Routledge|page=611|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HAg3AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA612&amp;dq=bhagavan+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-TCJVNawLoufuQTUj4E4&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=bhagavan%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Upanishads

The root of ''Bhagavan'', ''Bhaga'' is mentioned in the ''[[Mundaka Upanishad]]'', but it does not mean or imply ''Bhagavan'':

:शौनको ह वै महाशालोऽङ्गिरसं विधिवदुपसन्नः पप्रच्छ ।
:कस्मिन्नु '''भगवो''' विज्ञाते सर्वमिदं विज्ञातं भवतीति ॥ ३ ॥

:Shaunaka asked: Can knowledge of the world's reality be so complete that all the many things we see are understood in it?
:Can something so complete, excellent be found that knowing it, one knows everything?
:– ''Mundaka Upanishad'' I.1.3 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy|author=R.D.Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|page=45|url= https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Constructive_Survey_of_Upanishadic_Phi.html?id=fk8pAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ananda Wood (1996), Interpreting the Upanishads, pages 31-32&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Mundaka Upanishad'' then answers this question in two parts over verses 1.1.4 through 3.2.11&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Muller]], The Upanishads, Part 2, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads02ml#page/26/mode/2up Mundaka Upanishad], Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; - lower knowledge and higher knowledge. The lower knowledge includes Vedas, phonetics, grammar, etymology, meter, astronomy and ceremony rituals. The higher knowledge, the Upanishad asserts, is Self-knowledge and realizing its oneness with Brahman - the one which cannot be seen, nor seized, which has no origin, no qualities, no hips, nor ears, no hands, nor feet, one that is the eternal, all-pervading, infinitesimal, imperishable. The word Bhagavan does not appear in the ''Mundaka Upanishad'' and other early or middle Upanishads.&lt;ref name=friha/&gt;

Later and medieval era Upanishads mention ''Bhagavān''. For example, the very first verse of the ''Kali-Saṇṭāraṇa Upaniṣhad'' includes it, as follows,&lt;ref name=knaiyar/&gt;

{{quote|
द्वापरान्ते नारदो ब्रह्माणं जगाम कथं '''भगवन्''' गां पर्यटन् कलिं सन्तरेयमिति

At the start of the Dvapara [Yuga] [[Narada]] went to Brahma and asked, "O Lord, how shall I, roaming over the earth, be able to overcome the effects of Kali [Yuga]?"
|''[[Kali-Saṇṭāraṇa Upaniṣad]]'', 1.1 &lt;ref name=knaiyar&gt;Sanskrit: [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/कलि-सण्टारण_उपनिषद् कलि-सण्टारण उपनिषद्] Wikisource;&lt;br&gt;English Translation: KN Aiyar, Thirty Minor Upanishads, Madras (1914), Reprinted in 1980 as {{ISBN|978-0935548006}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kali-Saṇṭāraṇa, a minor Upanishad, then proceeds to disclose, among other things, two Bhagavan names in the [[Hare Krishna mantra]] in verse 2,&lt;ref&gt;Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare Hare&lt;br&gt;Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare&lt;/ref&gt; which is sung by [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON)]] devotees.&lt;ref name=knaiyar/&gt;

;Purana

In ''Bhagavata Dharma'' it denotes Narayana Vasudeva's four vyuha formations. [[Ishvara]] or God is called Bhagavan and the person consecrated to Bhagavan is called a [[Bhagavata]]. The [[Bhagavata Purana]] (I.iii.28) identifies [[Krishna]] as [[Narayana]], [[Vāsudeva]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Hari]] – ''Bhagavan'' present in human form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Body of God|author=Dennis Hudson|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=578, 33, 34|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IMCxbOezDi4C&amp;pg=PA578&amp;dq=Bhagavan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1uaHVLHAG9Xd8AWMkoCoBg&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAjgo#v=onepage&amp;q=Bhagavan&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bhagavan'' is the complete revelation of the Divine; [[Brahman]], the impersonal Absolute, is unqualified and therefore, never expressed; [[Paramatman]] is Bhagavan in relation to [[Prakṛti]] and the [[Jiva]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sword and the Flute-Kali and Krsna|author=David R.Kinsley|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=69|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=qKE93CHnRwgC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=Bhagavan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=neqHVJ3-MsGm8AWR2YLQDg&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBjgy#v=onepage&amp;q=Bhagavan&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; And, the Yoga of Devotion implies that if a ''Bhagavata'', the devotee of ''Bhagavan'', seeks and longs for ''Bhagavan'', then ''Bhagavan'' too seeks his devotee in equal measure, for there can be no Yoga of knowledge without a human seeker of the knowledge, the supreme subject of knowledge and the divine use by the individual of the universal faculties of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Synthesis of Yoga|author=Sri Aurobindo|publisher=Lotus Press|page=32|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ex6cSqqBSwC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=Bhagavan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8-yHVJaGC5fg8AXIhYCIDA&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwCDg8#v=onepage&amp;q=Bhagavan&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Bhagavad Gita

The term Bhagavan appears extensively in the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', as Krishna counsels Arjuna.&lt;ref name=friha/&gt; For example,

{{quote|
श्री'''भगवानु'''वाच&lt;nowiki&gt; । कुतस्त्वा कश्मलमिदं विषमे समुपस्थितम् । अनार्यजुष्टमस्वर्ग्यमकीर्तिकरमर्जुन ॥ २-२॥&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Shri Bhagavan said, "from where had this weakness arisen, at this inconvenient time?&lt;br&gt;It is not noble, neither will it lead you to heaven, nor will it earn you valor, O Arjuna.
|[[Bhagavad Gita]], 2.2 &lt;ref&gt;GK Marballi (2013), Journey Through The Bhagavad Gita, {{ISBN|978-1304558480}}, page 26&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Vaishnavism===
{{Vaishnavism}}
The ''Bhāgavat'' traditions of [[Hinduism]] invoke Bhagavan in ''Narayan Upakheyam'' and in Bhagavad Gita of [[Bhishma Parva]] of the [[Mahabharata]]. The devotion to Lord Vishnu (identified as Vasudeva in Mahabharata) is described as ten incarnations of Vishnu. It introduced the ''Chatur – vyuha'' concept and laid emphasis on the worship of five Vrisini-warriors, reached the peak of its popularity during the Gupta Period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Optional Indian History – Ancient India|publisher=Upkar Prakashan|page=65|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_SbiUXtBzAsC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=bhagavat+as+religion&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JiiIVPjbKoGjugSbjYLoBQ&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=bhagavat%20as%20religion&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Significance===
In [[Hinduism]], the word, ''Bhagavān'', indicates the Supreme Being or Absolute Truth conceived as a [[Personal God]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krishna.com/node/118 Who is Krishna?] "God the person, or Bhagavan"&lt;/ref&gt; This ''personal'' feature indicated by the word ''Bhagavān'' differentiates its usage from other similar terms&lt;ref&gt;[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/1/2/11/en1 Bhag-P 1.2.11] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235140/http://srimadbhagavatam.com/1/2/11/en1 |date=26 September 2007 }} "Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this the non-dual "Brahman", "Paramatmān " or "Bhagavān"&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Brahman]], the "Supreme Spirit" or "spirit", and thus, in this usage, ''Bhagavan'' is analogous to the [[Christianity|Christian]] conception of [[God the Father]]. In ''Vaisnavism'', a devotee of ''Bhagvān'' Krishna is called a ''[[Bhagavata|Bhāgavata]]''.

The ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' (1.2.11) states the definition of ''Bhagavān'' to mean the supreme most being: &lt;blockquote&gt;The Learned Know the Absolute Truth call this non-dual substance ''[[Brahman]]'', ''[[Paramatma]]'' or ''Bhagavan''.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;{{IAST|vadanti tat tattva-vidas}}/ {{IAST|tattvam yaj jnanam advayam}}/ {{IAST|brahmeti paramatmeti}}/ {{IAST|bhagavan iti sabdyate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; ''Bhagavān'' used as a title of [[veneration]] is often directly used as "Lord", as in ''"Bhagavān [[Rama]]"'', ''"Bhagavān [[Krishna]]"'', ''"Bhagavān [[Shiva]]"'', etc. In [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Mahavira]] and other [[Tirthankara]]s, [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] and [[bodhisattva]]s are also venerated with this title. The feminine of ''Bhagavat'' is '''''Bhagawatī''''' and is an epithet of [[Durga]] and other [[Goddesses#Hinduism|goddesses]]. This title is also used by a number of contemporary spiritual teachers in [[India]] who claim to be Bhagavan or have realized impersonal Brahman.

''[[Bhakti]]'' (devotion to God) consists in actions performed dedicated to the [[Paramatman]], the individuated existence which has free-will and who is the final cause of the world; the [[Vedic]] [[Rishi]]s describe the goals originated from God as ''Bhagavān'', the [[Ananda]] aspect of God where God has manifested His personality is called ''Bhagavān'' when consciousness (pure self-awareness) aligns with those goals to cause the unified existence and commencement of works follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic Creationism|author=Ashish Dalela|publisher=iUniverse|page=337|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=qLe-aZfl7YEC&amp;pg=PA333&amp;dq=bhagavan+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-TCJVNawLoufuQTUj4E4&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=bhagavan%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Bhagavā in Buddhist texts

Some Buddhist texts, such as the Pali ''suttas'', use the word ''"Bhagavā"'' for [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], meaning as 'the fortunate one'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Buddhist Philosophy|author=David J. Kalupahana|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|page=111|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SlDArya3YvcC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=bhagava++buddhism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Oh-IVOjIK8W8uATMpIHABQ&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=bhagava%20%20buddhism&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''"Bhagavā"'' has been used in Pali [[Anussati]] or recollections as one of the terms that describes the "[[Tathāgata]]" as one full of good qualities, as ''arahant'', ''sammā-sambuddho'' and ''sugato'' (Dīgha Nikāya II.93).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|publisher=Routledge|page=94|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NFpcAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=bhagava++buddhism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Oh-IVOjIK8W8uATMpIHABQ&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bhagava%20%20buddhism&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Buddha Anussati, ''Bhagavan'' is defined the following way:

:''{{IAST|Iti pi so '''Bhagavā''' Arahaṃ Sammā-sambuddho Vijjā-caraṇa sampanno Sugato Lokavidū Anuttaro purisa-damma-sārathi Satthā deva-manusānaṃ Buddho '''Bhagavā'''ti}}''

:Thus is Buddha, deserving homage, perfectly awakened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, well gone to [[Nirvana|Nibbana]], knower of the worlds, incomparable leader (lit. charioteer) of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, awakened one and Blessed One.

;Bhagavān in Buddhist texts

Several Tibetan Buddhist tantra texts use the word Bhagavān. For example, the Pradipoddyotana manuscript of [[Guhyasamāja tantra]]-Samdhivyakarana uses the word ''Bhagavān'', which Alex Wayman translates as "Lord".&lt;ref name=alexwayman&gt;Alex Wayman (1974), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1397800 Two Traditions of India: Truth and Silence] Philosophy East and West, Vol. 24, No. 4 (Oct., 1974), pages 389-403, for the original verse see footnote 13 on page 402, for Wayman's translation see page 391&lt;/ref&gt; The text, elsewhere refers to ''Bhagavan Sarvatathagatakayavakcittadipatih'', which John Campbell translates as "Lord, Master of the Vajras of Body, Speech, and Mind of all Buddhas."&lt;ref&gt;John Campbell (2009), [http://gradworks.umi.com/33/74/3374090.html Vajra hermeneutics: A study of Vajrayana scholasticism in the "Pradipoddyotana"], PhD Thesis accepted by Columbia University (Advisor: Robert Thurman), page 210&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, it states,&lt;ref name=johncampbell&gt;John Campbell (2009), [http://gradworks.umi.com/33/74/3374090.html Vajra hermeneutics: A study of Vajrayana scholasticism in the "Pradipoddyotana"], PhD Thesis accepted by Columbia University (Advisor: Robert Thurman), page 355&lt;br&gt;Christian K.

[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]], a sutra of [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] Buddhism, for example, uses the word ''Bhagavān'' over three hundred times, which is either left untranslated by scholars, or translated as "Lord or Blessed One".&lt;ref&gt;'''English Translation''': Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki, [http://huntingtonarchive.osu.edu/resources/downloads/sutras/08technicalMayayana/Lankavatara%20Sutra.doc.pdf Mahayana Lankavatara Sutra] Ohio State University;&lt;br&gt;'''Sanskrit''': [http://lirs.ru/do/lanka_skt/Lankavatara-Sanskrit-Vaidya_edition.pdf Lankavatara Sutra] Archived original at a Buddhist Library in Russia&lt;/ref&gt; The devotional meditational text ''Sukhavati Vyuhopadesa'' by [[Vasubandhu]] uses the term ''Bhagavān'' in its invocations.&lt;ref&gt;Minoru Kiyota (2009), Mahāyāna Buddhist Meditation: Theory and Practice, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807600}}, pages 274-275&lt;/ref&gt;

===Significance===
The term ''Bhagavān'' is found in liturgical practices of [[Theravada]] Buddhism, where it is used as an epithet that means the "Blessed One". Examples of such usage is found in Sri Lanka's ''Bodhi Puja'' (or ''Atavisi Buddha Puja'', Worship of the Twenty Eight Buddhas).&lt;ref&gt;Frank Reynolds and Jason A. Carbine (2000), The Life of Buddhism, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520223370}}, pages 179-187&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inscriptions ==
[[File:Heliodorus-Pillar2.jpg|thumb|260px|Heliodorus ''Khamba'' (pillar) in the Indian state of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. Installed about 100 BCE, the pillar's Brahmi-script inscription states that Heliodorus is a ''Bhagvatena'' (devotee) of Vishnu.&lt;ref&gt;PP Behera, [http://www.orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/jun2004/englishpdf/pillar.pdf The Pillars of Homage to Lord Jagannatha] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609215607/http://www.orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/jun2004/englishpdf/pillar.pdf |date=9 June 2015 }} Orissa Review, June 2004, page 65&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Greek===
A word derived from ''Bhagavan'' is documented epigraphically from around 100 BCE, such as in the inscriptions of the [[Heliodorus pillar]]; in which Heliodorus, an [[Indo-Greek]] ambassador from [[Taxila]] to the court of a [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]] king, addresses himself as a Bhagavata ("Heliodorena bhagavatena", Archaeological Survey of India, Annual Report (1908-1909)):&lt;ref&gt;John Irvin (1973-1975), Aśokan Pillars: A Reassessment of the Evidence, The Burlington Magazine. v. 115, pages 706-720; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/877843 v. 116, pages 712-727]; v. 117, pages 631-643; v. 118, pages 734-753; {{oclc|83369960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This [[Garuda]]-standard of Vasudeva ([[Vishnu]]), the God of Gods was erected here by the [[Bhagavata|Bhagavatena]] (devotee) Heliodoros, the son of Dion, a man of [[Taxila]], sent by the Great Greek ([[Yona]]) King [[Antialcidas]], as ambassador to King Kasiputra Bhagabhadra, the Savior son of the princess from [[Benares]], in the fourteenth year of his reign."&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Original inscription:&lt;br&gt;Devadevasa Va [sude]vasa Garudadhvajo ayam&lt;br&gt;karito i[a] Heliodorena bhaga-&lt;br&gt;vatena Diyasa putrena Takhasilakena&lt;br&gt;Yonadatena agatena maharajasa&lt;br&gt;Amtalikitasa upa[m]ta samkasam-rano&lt;br&gt;Kasiput[r]asa [Bh]agabhadrasa tratarasa&lt;br&gt;vasena [chatu]dasena rajena vadhamanasa"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Sākamunisa bhagavato'' is recorded in the [[kharoshthi]] dedication of a vase placed in a Buddhist [[stupa]] by the Greek [[meridarch]] (civil governor of a province) named [[Theodorus (meridarch)|Theodorus]]:&lt;ref&gt;''The Greeks in Bactria and India'', [[W.W. Tarn]], Cambridge University Press, page 391&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BunaB''' was the name of a line of purposely useless [[novelty item|novelty products]], promoted as if they were useful via carefully written [[marketing]] hype. They were created by American radio host [[Al Crowder]] (1904-1981). Beginning in the 1950s BunaBs were purportedly produced by the firm of Orville K. Snav and Associates and distributed from its headquarters in Snav Towers, [[Mason City, Iowa]]. The company's chief product was the Improved No. 7 BunaB, an assembly of two {{convert|1.75|in|cm|adj=on}} insulated wires, red and blue, held together with neatly applied yellow electrical tape at the ends. BunaBs have over time been viewed as examples of primitive [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref name=peterson1&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=John Charles|title=The True-Life Adventures of Captain Wa Wah|year=2009|publisher=Katydid|url=http://www.captainwawah.com/?p=bunab|accessdate=26 October 2012|chapter=25 - The Wizard of Lime Creek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1951 Al Crowder was a music store employee and radio host at KSMN in Mason City.&lt;ref name=collison1&gt;{{cite news|last=Collison|first=Jim|title=Behind the BunaB: Product Research|publisher=Globe-Gazette|date=October 6, 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A cryptic gift of an object resembling a water jug from Crowder's father-in-law to Crowder's son inspired Crowder to write to the manufacturer, the [[Playtex|International Latex Corporation]], to ask what the object was. The response, received from E.C. Jakoswiak, Assistant to the President, stated that the bladder was a component of a World War II inflatable attack boat. Inspired by the apparently useless object and by the response, Crowder created the Improved BunaB #7, the first of the line. The BunaB

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...will meet, or exceed specifications set up by the industry for accuracy, durability and simplicity of operation. No moving parts insures constant stability... With a minimum of practice, results equaling the conventional instrument may be expected."&lt;ref name=peterson1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The instructions continued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"After prolonged use the BunaB may indicate a variation of one or two percent when checked against a new BunaB. In that case, the old one should be discarded immediately. Satisfaction in positive results will readily offset the slight cost of replacement."&lt;ref name=peterson1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Those who ordered the BunaB #7 received, in addition to their device, a registration card that, when returned to Snav Towers, automatically made the recipient an "Assistant to the President." Shortly afterwards a personal letter from Crowder would arrive, discussing in lengthy detail the difficulties that attended Snav's business empire and personal life. Crowder's use of the Snav name dated to a time in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], when he would send a daily (but empty) envelope to a local radio station that was soliciting letters from listeners.&lt;ref name=peterson1/&gt;

Crowder was "Chief Assistant to the President" from 1951 to his death in 1981. After he died, his wife Louise carried on as "Dame Minerva P. Snav" and managed the correspondence with the approximately 50,000 Assistants to the President and Key Personnel in the Field from the Hall of Science (an upstairs bedroom, said to cover "approximately 9000 square inches") at Snav Towers (the Crowder residence).&lt;ref name=peterson1/&gt;

==BunaB product line==
Snav produced a number of other BunaB products.

* '''BunaB #2''', also known as '''Zudirk'''. A board game with unplayable rules. In fact, the rules clearly stated that they were unplayable.
* '''BunaB #3''', the "Man's Between Shave Lotion," an apparently empty plastic bottle, the contents to be reconstituted by the addition of water.
* '''BunaB #4''', a small dial with an adhesive pad that, when attached to a surface, could be moved between "OFF" and "ON."
* '''BunaB #5''', a record to be played while watching television. It was entirely blank. Side 1 was noted to be particularly suitable for "drama, mystery, adventure and afternoon serials" while Side 2 was best for "panel shows, interviews, news, weather and sports." The record could be played at all [[Gramophone record|standard speeds]], including [[LP record|33-1/3]], 45, 78 and the [[Edison Disc Record|Edison 80 rpm]] standards with satisfactory results.&lt;ref name=playboy1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asbell|first=Bernard|title=The Little World of Orville K. Snav|journal=Playboy|date=April 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''BunaB #6''', remarkably similar to the Improved #7 BunaB to the extent of being identical.
* '''BunaB #7''', the company's signature product. About 40,000 BunaB #7s were produced.&lt;ref name=dickson1&gt;{{cite book|last=Dickson|first=Paul|title=Family Words: The Dictionary for People Who Don't Know a Frone from a Brinkle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RRLWjLs3lCgC&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;ots=gUebjT5y-C&amp;dq=bunab%20crowder&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q=bunab%20crowder&amp;f=false|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=978-0934333375|pages=24-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BunaB #7 is noted for its durability, ease of use and resistance to obsolescence.

While not a part of the BunaB line, Snav also produced the Post Meridian Morning (PMM) Shield. This black half-disc could be attached to the left side of a clock dial to obscure the morning hours.&lt;ref name=dickson1/&gt; Snav also marketed the "Exigency Conversion Apparatus" (ECA), a plastic bag containing labels "MEN" and "WOMEN," allowing instant conversion of any room to a restroom. The C-K Key, made of Snav-Metal, opened all models of [[chastity belt]].&lt;ref name=peterson1/&gt; Delinquent accounts were referred to a Snav subsidiary, the Octopus Collection Agency.&lt;ref name=playboy1/&gt;

==Media coverage==
Crowder appeared four times on ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'' to discuss the BunaB #7, introducing the BunaB #5 on the show in the fall of 1957. In April 1958 Crowder was the subject of a ''[[Playboy]]'' profile entitled ''"The Little World of Orville K. Snav."''&lt;ref name=playboy1/&gt; In the ''[[Bullwinkle J. Moose|Bullwinkle]]'' cartoon series, Bullwinkle read poetry from a music stand holding the "BunaB Anthem", first aired in September 1961. [[Jay Ward]], the producer of ''Bullwinkle'', awarded Snav a "Certificate of Exceptional Adequacy".&lt;ref name=peterson1/&gt;&lt;ref name=dickson1/&gt;&lt;ref name=collison2&gt;{{cite news|last=Collison|first=Jim|title=Politics, Pests stall Snav Crusade|newspaper=Globe-Gazette|date=October 6, 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; "

==Notable BunaB owners==
Television host [[Dave Garroway]] gave away BunaB #7s to test recipients' sense of humor. The BunaB he gave to [[Jimmy Carter]] was returned. [[H.R. Haldeman]] bought one for [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;Dickson, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; There is no record of whether Nixon found it funny. All of the [[Mercury Seven|Mercury 7]] astronauts had BunaBs.&lt;ref name=dickson1/&gt; Other "Assistants to the President" included [[Groucho Marx]], [[Hugh Downs]], [[Jerry Lewis]], [[Helen Hayes]], [[Barry Goldwater]] (who termed it "Absolutely irreplaceable. Use it constantly"),&lt;ref name=playboy1/&gt; [[Cary Grant]], [[Myrna Loy]] ("Absolutely indespensible!")&lt;ref name=playboy1/&gt; and [[Hugh Hefner]].&lt;ref name=peterson1/&gt;

==As conceptual art==
The BunaB line of products has been cited as an early form of [[conceptual art]], as described in the 2001 ''Dictionary of the Avant-Gardes''. BunaBs #3 and #5 are in particular cited as examples of ''praecisio'',&lt;ref name=huth1&gt;{{cite book|author=Huth, Geof|title=A Dictionary of the Avant-Gardes|year=2001|isbn=978-0415937641|pages=25-27|edition=2nd|authorlink=Al Crowder|editor=Kostelanetz, Ric|accessdate=26 October 2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NZX85xdr6boC&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;ots=VeVdaeBKf8&amp;dq=snav%20bunab&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q=snav%20bunab&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined as the act of making a point through silence.&lt;ref name=kibbins1&gt;{{cite book|last=Kibbins|first=Gary|title=Grammar and Not-Grammar|publisher=YYZ Artists|page=187|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comfort''' (or being ''comfortable'') is a sense of physical or psychological [[pleasure|ease]], often characterized as a lack of [[suffering|hardship]]. Persons who are lacking in comfort are '''uncomfortable''', or experiencing '''discomfort'''. A degree of psychological comfort can be achieved by recreating experiences that are associated with pleasant [[memory|memories]], such as engaging in familiar activities,&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Daniel Miller, ''The Comfort of Things'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; maintaining the presence of [[comfort object|familiar objects]],&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; and consumption of [[comfort food]]s. Comfort is a particular concern in [[health care]], as providing comfort to the sick and injured is one goal of healthcare, and can facilitate recovery.&lt;ref name="Kolcaba"&gt;Katharine Kolcaba, ''Comfort Theory and Practice: A Vision for Holistic Health Care and Research'' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Persons who are surrounded with things that provide psychological comfort may be described as being "in their [[comfort zone]]". Because of the personal nature of positive associations, psychological comfort is highly subjective.&lt;ref name="Kolcaba"/&gt;

The use of "comfort" as a verb generally implies that the subject is in a state of [[pain]], [[suffering]] or affliction, and requires alleviation from that state. Where the term is used to describe the support given to someone who has experienced a tragedy, the word is synonymous with [[consolation]] or [[wikt:solace|solace]]. However, comfort is used much more broadly, as one can provide physical comfort to someone who is not in a position to be uncomfortable. For example, a person might sit in a chair without discomfort, but still find the addition of a pillow to the chair to increase their feeling of comfort. Something that provides this type of comfort, which does not seek to relieve hardship, can also be referred to as being "comfy". Like certain other terms describing positive feelings or abstractions (hope, charity, chastity), comfort may also be used as a [[personal name]].

==Concepts==
[[File:Rama comforts Sita.jpg|thumb|Rama comforts Sita]]
There are various psychological studies about the feeling of comfort, and they have resulted in a few conclusions. The idea of comfort varies among each person; however, there are a few universal themes of comfort that apply to everyone. Most of these universal themes falls under the physical comfort such as contact comfort, comfort food, and thermal comfort.

=== Contact comfort ===
Contact comfort is the satisfaction with someone's touch, like a mother's embrace. This is essential to a child's development.

==== Harry Harlow study ====

One of the most famous developmental psychological studies is [[Harry Harlow]]'s development experiment with monkeys. He separated baby monkeys at birth and raised them with surrogate mothers. There were two types of surrogate mothers, a metal wire one and a one covered with cloth, and each had a nozzle that represented breast feeding. The surrogate mother covered in cloth represented comfort. At the end of the experiment, the psychologist saw that the monkeys would choose the cloth surrogate over the wire surrogate. They concluded that having basics needs is essential, but there is the need of closeness and affection.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

This experiment justified that importance of comfort and warmth for child development. All the monkeys that grew up from the experiment expressed a behavior of aggression and atypical sexual behaviors.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/harlow.htm|title = Psychology History|website = muskingum.edu|access-date = 2016-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comfort food ===
[[Comfort food]]s are foods intentionally consumed to move the eater into a pleasurable state. This could be credited to food preferences and childhood experiences (like a mother's cooking).

==== Physiological responses ====
Comfort food are usually chosen because of previous experiences of happiness linked with it. For example, chocolate is held as a popular comfort food as it is follows the pleasurable sweetness and the positive association with gifts/rewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Barthel|first = Diane|date = August 1989|title = Modernism and Marketing: The Chocolate Box Revisited|url = http://tcs.sagepub.com/content/6/3/429.short|journal = Theory, Culture, &amp; Society|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The time of day also play a role in consuming comfort foods. Most people tend to eat simply because "it's lunch time" and only 20% of the time is due to actual hunger &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = TUOMISTO|first = T|last2 = TUOMISTO|first2 = MT|last3 = HETHERINGTON|first3 = M|last4 = LAPPALAINEN|first4 = R|date = 1998-04-01|title = Reasons for Initiation and Cessation of Eating in Obese Men and Women and the Affective Consequences of Eating in Everyday Situations|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666397901422|journal = Appetite|volume = 30|issue = 2|pages = 211–222|doi = 10.1006/appe.1997.0142}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Popular_comfort_foods.png|thumb|288x288px|Popular Comfort Foods]]

==== Food preferences ====
Food preferences splits into two categories, snack-related and meal-related.  If a child was exposed to many snacks growing up, he/she would focus on more snack-related comfort foods later on in life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Food preference ranges through male/female, and younger/older&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Wansink|first = Brian|last2 = Cheney|first2 = Matthew M.|last3 = Chan|first3 = Nina|date = 2003-09-01|title = Exploring comfort food preferences across age and gender|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031938403002038|journal = Physiology &amp; Behavior|volume = 79|issue = 4–5|pages = 739–747|doi = 10.1016/S0031-9384(03)00203-8|pmid=12954417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thermal comfort ===
[[File:Comfort_level_x_temperature_Chart.jpg|thumb|382x382px|Comfort level average on the temperature]]
[[Thermal comfort]] is a satisfaction of the ambient air temperature and humidity. Psychologists devised a study to determine the most comfortable temperature. The study had people answering a survey as the temperature changed around them. From the surveys, psychologist found many people had no opinion of a range of temperature.This was labeled temperature neutrality, which is the rate as the person [[metabolism]] is shifting the same rate as the surrounding temperature. The average comfortable temperature is 30 degrees Celsius. Temperatures too hot (35&amp;nbsp;°C and above) and temperatures too low (12&amp;nbsp;°C and below) are considered uncomfortable to many people.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Gagge|first = A. P.|last2 = Stolwijk|first2 = J. A. J.|last3 = Hardy|first3 = J. D.|date = 1967-06-01|title = Comfort and thermal sensations and associated physiological responses at various ambient temperatures|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0013935167900023|journal = Environmental Research|volume = 1|issue = 1|pages = 1–20|doi = 10.1016/0013-9351(67)90002-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Thermal neutrality ====
Thermal Neutrality ([[Thermal neutral zone|Thermal Neutral Zone]]) is the temperature range where it is neither comfortable or uncomfortable. The human body's metabolism is burning calories at the same rate as the temperature around. This would be around 24&amp;nbsp;°C (room temperature), and people have no opinion about the temperature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thermal Neutrality is often also used in animal raising.For example, Farmers maintain the neutral temperature for cattle to prevent [[Cold stress|Cold Stress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://articles.extension.org/pages/44454/explain-the-concepts-of-thermoneutral-zone-lower-critical-temperature-and-upper-critical-temperature|title = Explain the concepts of thermoneutral zone, lower critical temperature, and upper critical temperature, and how they relate to metabolic rate - eXtension|website = articles.extension.org|access-date = 2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lamashtu plaque 9167.jpg|thumb|Bronze protection plaque from the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian era]] showing the demon [[Lamashtu]]]]
The ancient [[Mesopotamia]]ns believed that magic was the only viable defense against [[demon]]s, [[ghost]]s, and evil sorcerers.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farber|first=Walter|date=1995|title=Witchcraft, Magic, and Divination in Ancient Mesopotamia|url=http://wsrp.usc.edu/information/REL499_2011/Witchcraft,%20Magic,%20and%20Divination%20in%20Ancient%20Mesopotamia.pdf|journal=Civilizations of the Ancient Near East|volume=3|location=New York City, New York|publisher=Charles Schribner’s Sons, MacMillan Library Reference USA, Simon &amp; Schuster MacMillan|pages=1891-1908|isbn=978-0-68-419279-6|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; To defend themselves against the spirits of those they had wronged, they would leave offerings known as ''kispu'' in the person's tomb in hope to appease them.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; If that did not work, they also sometimes took a figurine of the deceased and buried it in the ground, demanding for the gods to eradicate the spirit, or force it to leave the person alone.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt;

The ancient Mesopotamians also used magic to protect themselves from evil sorcerers who might place curses on them.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; They had no distinction between "light magic" and "black magic" and a person defending him or herself from witchcraft would use exactly the same techniques as the person trying to curse someone.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; The only major difference was the fact that curses were enacted in secret;&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; whereas a defense against sorcery was conducted in the open, in front of an audience if possible.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; One ritual to punish a sorcerer was known as [[Maqlû]], or "The Burning".&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; The person afflicted by the witchcraft would create an effigy of the sorcerer and put it on trial at night.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; Then, once the nature of the sorcerer’s crimes had been determined, the person would burn the effigy and thereby break the sorcerer’s power over him or her.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt;

The ancient Mesopotamians also performed magical rituals to purify themselves of sins committed unknowingly.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; One such ritual was known as the [[Šurpu]], or "Burning",&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; in which the caster of the spell would transfer the guilt for all his or her misdeeds onto various objects such as a strip of dates, an onion, and a tuft of wool.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; He or she would then burn the objects and thereby purify him or herself of all sins that he or she might have unknowingly committed.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; A whole genre of love spells existed.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; Such spells, which usually invoked the aid of the goddess [[Ishtar]], were believed to cause a person to fall in love with another person, restore love which had faded, or cause a male sexual partner to be able to sustain an erection when he had previously been unable.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; Other spells were used to reconcile a man with his patron deity or to reconcile a wife with a husband who had been neglecting her.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt;

The ancient Mesopotamians had no distinction between "rational science" and magic.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abusch"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abusch|first=Tzvi|title=Mesopotamian Witchcraft: Towards a History and Understanding of Babylonian Witchcraft Beliefs and Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Mesopotamian_Witchcraft.html?id=Slhv-0ewLHwC|location=Leiden, The netherlands|publisher=Brill|year=2002|isbn=9789004123878|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Michael|date=1995|title=Israel's Divine Healer|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Israel_s_Divine_Healer.html?id=KCzmNKnLqMkC|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=9780310200291|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a person became ill, doctors would proscribe both magical formulas to be recited as well as medicinal treatments.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abusch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; Most magical rituals were intended to be performed by an ''[[Asipu|āšipu]]'', an expert in the magical arts.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abusch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; The profession was generally passed down from father to son&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; and was held in extremely high regard and often served as advisors to kings and great leaders.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; An āšipu probably served not only as a magician, but also as a physician, a priest, a scribe, and a scholar.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; He would have likely owned a large library of clay tablets containing important religious texts and hymns.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt;

The Sumerian god [[Enki]], who was later syncretized with the [[East Semitic]] god Ea, was closely associated with magic and incantations;&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; he was the patron god of the ''bārȗ'' and the ''ašipū'' and was widely regarded as the ultimate source of all arcane knowledge.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; The ancient Mesopotamians also believed in [[omen]]s, which could come when solicited or unsolicited.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; Regardless of how they came, omens were always taken with the utmost seriousness.&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt; The Mesopotamians also invented [[astrology]].&lt;ref name="Farber1995"/&gt;

==Ancient Egypt==

[[File:Wedjat (Udjat) Eye of Horus pendant.jpg|thumb|Ancient Egyptian [[Eye of Horus]] amulet]]
Magic was an integral part of ancient Egyptian religion and culture.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brier|first1=Bob|last2=Hobbs|first2=Hoyt|date=2009|title=Ancient Egypt: Everyday Life in the Land of the Nile|location=New York City, New York|publisher=Sterling|isbn=978-1-4549-0907-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|66}} The ancient Egyptians would often wear magical amulets, known as ''meket'', for protection.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|66}} The most common material for such amulets was a kind of ceramic known as [[faience]], but amulets were also made of stone, metal, bone, and wood.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|66}} Amulets depicted specific symbols.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|67}} One of the most common protective symbols was the [[Eye of Horus]], which represented the new eye given to [[Horus]] by the god [[Thoth]] as a replacement for his old eye, which had been destroyed during a battle with Horus’s uncle Seth.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|67}} The most popular amulet was the scarab beetle, the emblem of the god [[Khepri]].&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|67}} Pregnant women would wear amulets depicting Tauret, the goddess of childbirth, to protect against miscarriage.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|44}} The god [[Bes]], who had the head of a lion and the body of a dwarf, was believed to be the protector of children.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|44}} After giving birth, a mother would remove her Tauret amulet and put on a new amulet representing Bes.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|44}}
 
Like the Mesopotamians, the ancient Egyptians had no distinction between magic and medicine.&lt;ref name="Mark2017"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mark|first=Joshua|date=2017|title=Magic in Ancient Egypt|website=ancient.eu|publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia|url=http://www.ancient.eu/article/1019/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptians believed that diseases stemmed from supernatural origins&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt; and ancient Egyptian doctors would prescribe both magical and practical remedies to their patients.&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt; Doctors would interrogate their patients to find out what ailments the person was suffering from. The symptoms of the disease determined which deity the doctor needed to invoke in order to cure it. 
Doctors were extremely expensive,&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt; so, for most everyday purposes, the average Egyptian would have relied on individuals who were not professional doctors, but who possessed some form of medical training or knowledge.&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt; Among these individuals were folk healers and seers, who could set broken bones, aid mothers in giving birth, proscribe herbal remedies for common ailments, and interpret dreams.&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt; If a doctor or seer was unavailable, then everyday people would simply cast their spells on their own without assistance.&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt; Although most Egyptians were illiterate, it was likely commonplace for individuals to memorize spells and incantations for later use.&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt;

[[File:Opening of the mouth ceremony.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Illustration from ''[[The Book of the Dead]] of [[Hunefer]]'' showing the [[Opening of the mouth ceremony|Opening of the Mouth ceremony]] being performed before the tomb]]

The main principle behind Egyptian magic seems to have been the notion that, if a person said something with enough conviction, the statement would automatically become true.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|54}} The interior walls of the pyramid of Unas, the final pharaoh of the Egyptian Fifth Dynasty, are covered in hundreds of magical spells and inscriptions, running from floor to ceiling in vertical columns.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|54}} These inscriptions are known as the "[[Pyramid Texts]]"&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|54}} and they contain spells needed by the pharaoh in order to survive in the [[Egyptian afterlife|Afterlife]].&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|54}} The Pyramid Texts were strictly for royalty only;&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56}} the spells were kept secret from commoners and were written only inside royal tombs.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56}} During the chaos and unrest of the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt|First Intermediate Period]], however, tomb robbers broke into the pyramids and saw the magical inscriptions.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56}} Commoners began learning the spells and, by the beginning of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], commoners began inscribing similar writings on the sides of their own coffins, hoping that doing so would ensure their own survival in the Afterlife.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56}} These writings are known as the "[[Coffin Texts]]". &lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56}}

Eventually, the Coffin Texts became so extensive that they no longer fit on the outside of a coffin.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56}} They began to be instead recorded on scrolls of papyrus, which would then be placed inside the coffin with the deceased’s own corpse.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56}} The writings on these scrolls are now known as ''[[The Book of the Dead]]''.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56}} There were hundreds of different versions of ''The Book of the Dead'', all of them containing different spells.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56}} Egyptologists have identified more than four hundred different spells belonging to ''The Book of the Dead'' collectively.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56}} Egyptologists have codified and classified these spells, assigning them specific numbers based on their content and purpose.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56}}

[[File:Louvre 122006 018 d.jpg|thumb|''[[Ushabti|Shabti]]'' belonging to [[Ramesses IV|Pharaoh Rameses IV]] of the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Egyptian Twentieth Dynasty]], currently held in the [[Louvre]] in Paris]]

As ''The Book of the Dead'' became more popular, a whole industry of scribes arose for the sole purpose of copying manuscripts so that customers would be able to buy copies of the spells to be buried with them in their tombs.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56-57}} The quality of manuscripts was highly variable.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56-57}} Some editions were ninety feet long and contained beautiful, color illustrations to illuminate the text;&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56-57}} others were short with no illustrations whatsoever.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56-57}} The scrolls were copied before they were bought, meaning that the name of the owner was unknown.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56-57}} As such, the scribes would leave the places for the person’s name blank and fill in the person's name after the scroll was purchased.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56-57}} Sometimes scribes would accidentally misread or miscopy what they were writing.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56-57}} Sometimes the spells would be abbreviated in order to avoid running out of space.&lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56-57}} Such mistakes could render the texts unintelligible. &lt;ref name="BriarHobbs"/&gt;{{rp|56-57}}

After a person died, his or her corpse would be mummified and wrapped in linen bandages in order to ensure that the deceased's body would survive for as long as possible&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt; because the Egyptians believed that a person's soul could only survive in the Afterlife for as long as his or her physical body survived here on earth.&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt; The last ceremony before a person's body was sealed away inside the tomb was known as the "[[Opening of the mouth ceremony|Opening of the Mouth]]".&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt; In this ritual, the priests would touch various magical instruments to various parts of the deceased's body, thereby giving the deceased the ability to see, hear, taste, and smell in the Afterlife.&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt;

Before dead person was buried, his or her mummified corpse would be stuffed full of magic amulets and protective charms in order to ensure that he or she would be safe in the next world.&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt; The family would also place important grave goods inside the person’s tomb in order to ensure that he or she had everything he or she would need in the next life.&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt; Among these grave goods were small figurines made of faience or wood known as ''[[Ushabti|shabti]]''. The shabti were intended as slaves for the deceased.&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt; The ancient Egyptians believed that physical labor was just as necessary in the Afterlife as it was in the present one.&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt; As such, they believed that the deceased could cast a spell to animate these figurines so that he or she would be able to order them to perform tasks and chores in the Afterlife so that the deceased him or herself would not be forced to perform any labor.&lt;ref name="Mark2017"/&gt;

[[File:Hécate - Mallarmé.png|thumb|[[Hecate]], the ancient Greek goddess of magic.]]

Ancient Greek scholarship of the 20th century, almost certainly influenced by Christianising preconceptions of the meanings of magic and religion, and the wish to establish Greek culture as the foundation of Western rationality, developed a theory of ancient Greek magic as primitive and insignificant, and thereby essentially separate from [[Homeric]], communal ("''polis''") religion. Since the last decade of the century, however, recognising the ubiquity and respectability of acts such as ''katadesmoi'' ("[[Curse tablet|binding spells]]"), described as magic by modern and ancient observers alike, scholars have been compelled to abandon this viewpoint.&lt;ref name="Kindt"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kindt|first1=Julia|title=Rethinking Greek Religion|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521110920}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|90–95}} The Greek word ''mageuo'' ("practise magic") itself derives from the word ''[[Magi|Magos]]'', originally simply the Greek name for a [[Iran#Classical antiquity|Persian tribe]] known for practising religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Copenhaver|first1=Brian P.|title=Magic in Western Culture: From Antiquity to the Enlightenment|date=2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9781107070523|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-civic "[[mystery cults]]" have been similarly re-evaluated:&lt;ref name="Kindt"/&gt;{{rp|97–98}}

{{quote|the choices which lay outside the range of cults did not just add additional options to the civic menu, but ... sometimes incorporated critiques of the civic cults and Panhellenic myths or were genuine alternatives to them.|Simon Price, ''Religions of the Ancient Greeks'' (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Price|first1=Simon|title=Religions of the Ancient Greeks|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0521388678|page=115|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'' [[Curse tablet|Katadesmoi'' (Latin: '' defixiones)]]''), curses inscribed on wax or lead tablets and buried underground, were frequently executed by all strata of Greek society, sometimes to protect the entire ''polis''.&lt;ref name="Kindt"/&gt;{{rp|95–96}} Communal curses carried out in public declined after the Greek classical period, but private curses remained common throughout antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hinnells|first1=John|title=The Penguin Handbook of Ancient Religions|date=2009|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=0141956666|page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were distinguished as magical by their individualistic, instrumental and sinister qualities.&lt;ref name="Kindt"/&gt;{{rp|96}} These qualities, and their perceived deviation from inherently mutable cultural constructs of normality, most clearly delineate ancient magic from the religious rituals of which they form a part.&lt;ref name="Kindt"/&gt;{{rp|102–103}}

A large number of magical [[Papyrus|papyri]], in [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]], and [[Demotic Egyptian|Demotic]], have been recovered and translated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Betz|first1=Hans Dieter|title=The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation, Including the Demotic Spells|date=1986|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226044440|pages=xii-xlv}}&lt;/ref&gt; They contain early instances of:

==Middle Ages==

{{Further information|Medieval European magic}}
Ars Magica or magic is a major component and supporting contribution to the belief and practice of spiritual, and in many cases, physical healing throughout the Middle Ages. Emanating from many modern interpretations lies a trail of misconceptions about magic, one of the largest revolving around wickedness or the existence of nefarious beings who practice it. These misinterpretations stem from numerous acts or rituals that have been performed throughout antiquity, and due to their exoticism from the commoner's perspective, the rituals invoked uneasiness and an even stronger sense of dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flint|first1=Valerie I.J.|title=The Rise of Magic in Early Medieval Europe|date=1990|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=0691031657|pages=4, 12, 406|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated813"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kieckhefer|first1=Richard|title=The Specific Rationality of Medieval Magic|journal=The American Historical Review|date=June 1994|volume=99|issue=3|pages=813–818|doi=10.2307/2167771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One societal force in the Middle Ages more powerful than the singular commoner, the Christian Church, rejected magic as a whole because it was viewed as a means of tampering with the natural world in a supernatural manner associated with the [[Bible|biblical]] verses of Deuteronomy 18:9-12. Despite the many negative connotations which surround the term magic, there exist many elements that are seen in a divine or holy light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindberg|first1=David C.|title=The Beginnings of Western Science: The European Scientific Tradition in Philosophical, Religious, and Institutional Context, 600 B.C. to A.D. 1450|date=2007|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226482057|page=20|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various yet sparse healers of the Middle Ages were among the few, if not the only, proponents of a positive impression of magic. One of the most famous healers of this time was [[Hildegard of Bingen|Saint Hildegard of Bingen]]. Her healing abilities were so sought after that many individuals, healthy and ill alike, would travel great distances to be blessed by her.&lt;ref name="Sweet"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sweet|first1=Victoria|title=Hildegard of Bingen and the Greening of Medieval Medicine|journal=Bulletin of the History of Medicine|date=1999|volume=73|issue=3|pages=381–403|doi=10.1353/bhm.1999.0140|pmid=10500336|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/bulletin_of_the_history_of_medicine/v073/73.3sweet.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern historians of medicine along with the people of the Middle Ages both possess no straightforward answer as to where her abilities derived from; however, many of these historians argue or speculate that they are related to mental visions of which recorded documents, such as her three volumes of visionary theology, depict. The volumes include: [[Scivias]], ("Know the Ways"), [[Hildegard of Bingen#Liber Vitae Meritorum|Liber Vitae Meritorum]], ("Book of Life's Merits"), and [[Liber Divinorum Operum]] ("Book of Divine Works").&lt;ref name="Sweet"/&gt;

Diversified instruments or rituals used in medieval magic include, but are not limited to: various amulets, talismans, potions, as well as specific chants, dances, prayers. Along with these rituals are the adversely imbued notions of demonic participation which influence of them. The idea that magic was devised, taught, and worked by demons would have seemed reasonable to anyone who read the Greek magical papyri or the [[Sepher Ha-Razim|Sefer-ha-Razim]] and found that healing magic appeared alongside rituals for killing people, gaining wealth, or personal advantage, and coercing women into sexual submission.&lt;ref name="autogenerated813"/&gt; Archaeology is contributing to a fuller understanding of ritual practices performed in the home, on the body and in monastic and church settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilchrist|first1=Roberta|title=Magic for the Dead?

The [[Islam]]ic reaction towards magic did not condemn magic in general and distinguished between magic which can heal sickness and [[Demonic possession#Islam|possession]], and sorcery. Magic is therefore a ''special gift from [[God in Islam|God]]'', while the latter is achieved through help of [[Jinn]] and [[Devil (Islam)|devils]]. [[Ibn al-Nadim]] hold, [[Exorcist]]s gain their power by their obedience to God, while sorcerers please the devils by acts of disobidience and sacrifices and they in return do him a favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=El-Zein|first1=Amira|title=Islam, Arabs, and the Intelligent World of the Jinn|date=2009|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=Syracuse, New York|isbn=9780815650706|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ibn Arabi]] [[Al-Ḥajjāj ibn Yusuf al-Shubarbuli]] was due to his piety able to walk on water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lebling|first1=Robert|title=Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and Genies from Arabia to Zanzibar|date=2010|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857730633|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the [[Quran]], regarding Islamic legends of [[Solomon in Islam|Solomon]], magic was taught by devils to the humans. Solomon took the [[Testament of Solomon|writings]] of the sorcerer away and hid them under his throne. After his death, [[Iblis]], unable to get close to Solomons court, told the people, they will find a treasure under the throne and thus lead them to sorcery. Another account hold, sorcery came with the [[Fallen angel#Islam|fallen angels]] [[Harut and Marut]] to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nasr|first1=Seyyed Hossein|last2=Dagli|first2=Caner K.|last3=Dakake|first3=Maria Massi|last4=Lumbard|first4=Joesph E.B.|last5=Rustom|first5=Mohammed|title=The Study Quran; A New Translation and Commentary|date=2015|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=9780062227621|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance==

{{Further information|Renaissance magic}}
[[Renaissance]] [[humanism]] saw a resurgence in [[hermeticism]] and [[Neo-Platonic]] varieties of [[ceremonial magic]]. The Renaissance, on the other hand, saw the rise of [[science]], in such forms as the dethronement of the [[Ptolemaic theory]] of the universe, the distinction of astronomy from astrology, and of chemistry from alchemy.&lt;ref name="Kiekhefer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kieckhefer|first1=Richard|title=Forbidden Rites: A Necromancer's Manual of the Fifteenth Century|date=2002|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, Pennsylvania|isbn=0271017511|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

There was great uncertainty in distinguishing practices of superstition, occultism, and perfectly sound scholarly knowledge or pious ritual. The intellectual and spiritual tensions erupted in the Early Modern [[witch-hunt|witch craze]], further reinforced by the turmoil of the [[Protestant Reformation]], especially in Germany, England, and [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name="Kiekhefer"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

==Modernity==

Sorcery is a legal concept in [[Papua New Guinea]] law, which differentiates between legal good magic, such as healing and fertility, and illegal black magic, held responsible for unexplained deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Cannibal cult members arrested in PNG|url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10817610|newspaper = New Zealand Herald|date = 2012-07-05|access-date = 2015-11-28|issn = 1170-0777|language = en-NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4191">A '''critical précis''' is an [[expository writing|expository]] style of writing, analogous in structure to an [[essay]] but which contains a summary of another piece of text. In essence, the entire content summarizes all the main ideas, arguments and [[abstraction]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seiferth|first=Michael S.|title=Writing the Precis|url=http://lonestar.texas.net/~mseifert/precis1302.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020220124429/http://lonestar.texas.net/~mseifert/precis1302.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 February 2002|work=Texas.net|publisher=English 1302 - Palo Alto College|accessdate=6 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; within the text into a shorter passage a fraction of its original length, in order to provide insight into the original author's [[thesis]]. The writer of the précis is careful to avoid copying any direct wording from the original text in order to avoid [[academic plagiarism]], except in short passage quotations where necessary.

The précis is a common assignment in the [[humanities]] and [[liberal arts]] streams in [[higher education]]. Typical lengths are less than 500 to 1500 words.

The majority of higher education students find the précis to be a useful analytical format and tool{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Its use also extends to [[interdisciplinary]] formats, and is sometimes also identified as a '''rhetorical précis'''.

==Structure==
;Introduction
::Cites the main text of work being analyzed, similar to a typical essay [[lead paragraph]]
;Body
::Explanation of key ideas, concepts and phrases, demonstrating the implied significance and purpose of the text using direct examples of how the author supports the thesis, often relating or contrasting to the reader's assumptions (this is not a creative interpretation)
;Conclusion
::Summarizes the main idea and importance of the original author's thesis, and the author's connections to the intended audience

The précis is written from an impartial [[Third-person narrative|third-person point of view]], although personal analysis of a text can also be considered précis format. The analysis of ideas is usually in chronological order.

===Example keywords===
The opening paragraph follows a certain structure:
''...''the author'''...
::asserts, argues, believes, claims, conveys the thought, declares, demonstrates, elucidates, expounds the idea, finds, identifies the fact, illustrates, implies, points out, posits, proposes, reports, reveals, states, suggests...'''that'''...
:::followed by a clause explaining the thesis. This clause is typically similar in scope to the concluding sentence of the final paragraph.

These words exemplify the use of ''rhetorically accurate verbs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lanzbom|first=Leon|title=On English and Writing: Critical Thinking|url=http://www.lanzbom.org/criticalthinking.htm|publisher=Word Rogues|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{redirect|Damaged}}
'''Damage''' is any [[Change (philosophy)|change]] in a thing, often a physical object, that degrades it away from its initial state. It can broadly be defined as "changes introduced into a system that adversely affect its current or future performance".&lt;ref name="Farrar"&gt;Farrar, C.R., Sohn, H., Park, G., "[https://books.google.com/books?id=6ET9AP6PRogC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=%22damage+can+be+defined+as+%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidq76hhOnRAhXL7YMKHbrDDWE4ChDoAQghMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22damage%20can%20be%20defined%20as%20%22&amp;f=false Converting Large Sensor Array Data into Structural Health Information]", in Andrew Smyth, Raimondo Betti, ''The 4th International Workshop on Structural Control'' (2005), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Damage "does not necessarily imply total loss of system functionality, but rather that the system is no longer operating in its optimal manner".&lt;ref name="Farrar"/&gt; Damage to physical objects is "the progressive physical process by which they break",&lt;ref name="Lemaitre"&gt;Jean Lemaitre, ''A Course on Damage Mechanics'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1.}}  and includes [[stress (mechanics)|mechanical stress]] that weakens a structure, even if this is not visible.&lt;ref name="Lemaitre"/&gt;{{rp|ix.}}

==Physical damage==
[[File:Hurricane Ike Bridge City TX Shell gas station.jpg|thumb|right|Damage to a gas station in Texas caused by a hurricane.]]
[[File:Groene savooiekool schade van kooluil (Mamestra brassicae damage).jpg|thumb|right|Damage to cabbage leaves caused by insects.]]
All physical damage begins on the [[atom]]ic level, with the shifting or breaking of [[atomic bond]]s, and the rate at which damage to any physical thing occurs is therefore largely dependent on the elasticity of such bonds in the material being subjected to stress. Damage can occur where atomic bonds are not completely broken, but are shifted to create unstable pockets of concentration and diffusion of the material, which are more susceptible to later breakage.&lt;ref name="Lemaitre"/&gt;{{rp|1.}} The effect of outside forces on a material depends on the relative [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] or [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] of the material; if a material tends towards elasticity, then changes to its consistency are reversible, and it can bounce back from potential damage. However, if the material tends towards plasticity, then such changes are permanent, and each such change increases the possibility of a crack or fault appearing in the material.&lt;ref name="Lemaitre"/&gt;{{rp|2–3.}}

Although all damage at the atomic level manifests as broken atomic bonds, the manifestation of damage at the macroscopic level depends on the material, and can include [[Fracture|cracks]] and [[Deformation (mechanics)|deformation]], as well as structural weakening that is not visible.&lt;ref name="Lemaitre"/&gt;{{rp|4.}}

===Damage to objects===
Damage to structures and other objects can take a number of forms, such as [[fire damage]] caused by the effects of burning, [[water damage]] done by [[water]] to materials not resistant to its effects, and [[radiation damage]] due to [[ionizing radiation]]. Some kinds of damage are specific to vehicles and mechanical or electronic systems, such as [[foreign object damage]] caused by the presence of any foreign substance, debris, or article; [[hydrogen damage]] due to interactions between metals and hydrogen; and [[damage mechanics]], which includes damage to materials due to cyclic mechanical loads. When an object has been damaged, it may be possible to [[repair]] the object, thereby restoring it to its original condition, or to a new condition that allows it to function despite the damage.

===Damage to living organisms===
Damage to a living organism may be referred to as an [[injury]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/woundsandinjuries.html |title=Wounds and Injuries: MedlinePlus |publisher=Nlm.nih.gov |accessdate=2015-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kinds of damage experienced by living things range from microscopic [[direct DNA damage]] and [[cell damage]] in a biological cell, to damage to larger systems such as [[nerve damage]], [[brain damage]], and [[articular cartilage damage]]. Damage to the body on a larger scale is often referred to as [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]]. [[Ageing]] is accompanied by a loss of ability to recover quickly from various kinds of biological damage. Damage is one of two factors proposed to influence biological ageing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Mitochondrial Theory of Aging and Other Aging Theories | publisher = 1Vigor | url = http://www.1vigor.com/science/mitochondrial-theory/ | accessdate = 4 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (the other being programmed factors follow a biological timetable). Damage-related factors include internal and environmental assaults to living organisms that induce cumulative damage at various levels.&lt;ref name="KunlinJin2010"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= |title=Modern Biological Theories of Aging.|year=2010 |last1=Jin|first1=Kunlin|volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=72–74 |pmid=21132086|pmc=2995895 |journal=Aging Dis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other concepts of damage==
Damage that occurs as an [[unintended consequence]] of an effort to cause intentional damage elsewhere, such as with a military operation, is called [[collateral damage]],&lt;ref name=USAF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/usaf/afpam14-210/part20.htm#page180 |title=USAF Intelligence Targeting Guide&amp;nbsp;— AIR FORCE PAMPHLET 14- 210 Intelligence |accessdate=6 October 2007 |date=1 February 1998 |page= 180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/collateral%20damage |title=collateral damage |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while damage specifically done to public or private property is called [[property damage]]. By extension, damage is also used to describe a degradation in the value of intangible things such as [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Steve Duck, Julia T. Wood, ''Confronting Relationship Challenges'' (1995), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[self-image]],&lt;ref&gt;David Read Johnson, Renee Emunah, ''Current Approaches in Drama Therapy'' (2009), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; [[reputation]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Moberly, ''Safeguarding Intangible Assets'' (2014), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Social capital|goodwill]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Sidney Rogers, ''Good Will, Trade-marks and Unfair Trading'' (1914), p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hazel Carty, ''An Analysis of the Economic Torts'' (2010), p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics of damage===
The propensity for damage to occur to physical objects and systems, as well as to intangible characteristics, is built into the prices of goods and services that depend on the supply of these things, particularly as a component of [[insurance]] costs.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Ghesquiere, ''Sovereign Natural Disaster Insurance for Developing Countries: A Paradigm Shift in Catastrophe Risk Financing'', The World Bank (2007), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[law]], [[Damages (law)|damages]] are the award, typically of [[money]], to be paid to a person as compensation for loss or injury (i.e., economic or physical damage).&lt;ref&gt;International principle: [http://www.trans-lex.org/946000 Trans-Lex.org], Garner, p.416&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional damage===
Institutional damage is broadly defined as [[unintended consequence]]s to an individual resulting from interaction with an institution which has responsibility for his or her care. The individual might be a [[hospital]] patient, a child in a school, or a prison [[Convict|inmate]]. Some forms of institutional damage, such as [[medical error]]s and [[hospital-acquired infection]] are relatively easily measured; others, such as long-term damage to development and [[mental health]] are significantly harder to measure. There is controversy as to whether such damage can be measured and if it actually occurs.

It is not a widely used term, however, but it is a legal concept of considerable importance, because it is extremely common, particularly in countries where [[human rights]] of prisoners and other people under institutional care are not respected or guaranteed by [[law]].

[[Constitutional law]], [[civil law (common law)]] and [[criminal law]] codices have many provisions to protect individuals against injuries caused by institutions to which they are unwillingly committed. The extent and the respect to these laws vary widely among countries and communities. These controversies relate to the old [[government]] versus [[individual]] debate which has permeated philosophy and political science since [[Ancient Greece]].

====Damage to institutions====
The same expression is also used in the opposite sense, i.e., as damage caused to institutions, as opposed to damage caused to individuals. For example, [[State of emergency|political exception]] situations, such as the suspension of [[political rights]] for a time, are said to damage [[democracy|democratic]] institutions. Other examples are [[vandalism]] of public buildings, extremely large [[epidemics]] that disrupt normal functioning of society's institutions, such as in the case of [[AIDS]] in [[Africa]]; external military intervention, such as in the invasion of [[Iraq]] by the USA and [[Allies|allied nations]]; and even (paradoxically), external aid to countries which are rich in natural resources but have a poor [[Economic system|economy]] and/or [[Political corruption|corrupt]] government (the so-called "[[resource curse]]")

The two concepts, damage caused by institutions and damage caused to institutions, are related in many situations. In widespread political trials ("[[witch hunting]]") in democratic countries, such as in the famous [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] in the 1940s, damage was said to occur in both directions, i.e., not only the lives, families and professional activities of a number of individuals were wrecked by the public exposure, but also the political institutions of individual rights and freedom in the United States were also similarly damaged by the Committee's activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6943">'''Egosurfing''' (also '''Googling yourself''', '''vanity searching''', '''egosearching''', '''egogoogling''', '''autogoogling''', '''self-googling''') is the practice of searching for one's own name, or pseudonym on a popular [[search engine]] in order to review the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=All Geek to Me |work=Ur magazine |publisher=Rogers |accessdate=2008-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, an '''egosurfer''' is one who surfs the [[Internet]] for his or her own name to see what information appears. It has become increasingly popular with the rise of internet search engines, as well as free [[blog]]ging and web-hosting services. Though [[Google]] is the search engine most commonly mentioned when referring to egosurfing, other widely known search engines include [[Yahoo]] and [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]].

The term was coined by [[Sean Carton]] in 1995 and first appeared in print as an entry in [[Gareth Branwyn]]'s March 1995 Jargon Watch column in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citizenscholar.com/news/archives/45|title=Citizen Scholar Inc. — the design studio of Randy J. Hunt|work=citizenscholar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streettech.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=index&amp;catid=&amp;topic=10&amp;allstories=1 Street Tech :: hardware beyond the hype] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102175642/http://streettech.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=index&amp;catid=&amp;topic=10&amp;allstories=1 |date=2010-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/buzzword/entries/egosurfing.html|title=Definition of egosurfing, BuzzWord from Macmillan Dictionary|work=macmillandictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.03/jargon_watch.html|title=3.03: Jargon Watch|work=wired.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egosurfing is employed by many people for a variety of reasons. According to a study by the Pew Internet &amp; American life project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/Media-Mentions/2007/Do-You-Use-Google-For-Vanity-Searching-Youre-Not-Alone.aspx|title=TechCrunch|author=Sarah Perez|first=|date=|work=TechCrunch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=y|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 47% of American adult internet users have undertaken a vanity search in Google or another search engine. Some egosurf purely for  entertainment, such as finding celebrities with the same name. However, many people egosurf as a means of [[online reputation management]]. Egosurfing can be used to find [[data spill]]s, released information that is undesirable to have in the public eye. By searching one's own name in an online search engine, one can take on the perspective of a stranger attempting to find out personal information. Some egosurf in order to conceal personal images or information from potential employers, clients, [[identity thieves]], and the like. Similarly, some use egosurfing to maintain a positive public image and to achieve self-promotion.

Many [[social networking]] sites, such as [[Facebook]], allow users to make their profiles "searchable," meaning that their profile will appear in the appropriate search results. As a result, those seeking to maintain their privacy often egosurf in order to ensure that their profile does not appear in search engine results. As more people create online personas, many feel the need to more cautiously monitor their digital footprint, including information that they have not chosen to share online, such as telephone numbers and public records.&lt;ref name="technewsworld.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/Pew-Study-Self-Googling-on-the-Rise-60810.html|title=Pew Study: Self-Googling on the Rise|work=technewsworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although personal information available online can be difficult to remove, in 2009 Google introduced a feature allowing users to create a small box listing personal information such as name, occupation, and location that appears on the first page of results when their name is searched. The box links to a full profile page, similar to one seen on Facebook. This Google profile can be linked to other social networking sites, such as one's blog, company website or [[Twitter]] feed. The more information that one includes on their Google profile, the higher one's informational box will rank in the results, thus essentially encouraging one to post personal information online and continue egosurfing.&lt;ref name="technewsworld.com"/&gt;

In [[econometrics]], '''endogeneity''' broadly refers to situations in which an [[explanatory variable]] is [[correlation|correlated]] with the [[errors and residuals|error term]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wooldridge |first=Jeffrey M. |title=Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach |location=Australia |publisher=South-Western |year=2009 |edition=Fourth |pages=88 |isbn=978-0-324-66054-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between [[wiktionary:endogenous|endogenous]] and [[wiktionary:exogenous|exogenous]] variables originated in [[simultaneous equations model]]s, where one separates [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] whose values are determined by the [[Economic model|model]] from variables which are predetermined;&lt;ref&gt;For example, in a simple [[supply and demand]] model, when predicting the quantity demanded in equilibrium, the price is endogenous because producers change their price in response to demand and consumers change their demand in response to price. In this case, the price variable is said to have '''total endogeneity''' once the demand and supply curves are known. In contrast, a change in [[consumer]] tastes or [[preference]]s would be an [[exogenous]] change on the [[demand curve]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jan |last=Kmenta |authorlink=Jan Kmenta |title=Elements of Econometrics |location=New York |publisher=MacMillan |edition=Second |year=1986 |isbn=0-02-365070-2 |pages=652–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ignoring [[simultaneity]] in the estimation leads to biased estimates as it violates the exogeneity assumption of the [[Gauss–Markov theorem]]. The problem of endogeneity, is, unfortunately, oftentimes ignored by researchers conducting non-experimental research and doing so precludes making policy recommendations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Antonakis|first=John|last2=Bendahan|first2=Samuel|last3=Jacquart|first3=Philippe|last4=Lalive|first4=Rafael|date=December 2010|title=On making causal claims: A review and recommendations|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.leaqua.2010.10.010|journal=The Leadership Quarterly|volume=21|issue=6|pages=1086–1120|doi=10.1016/j.leaqua.2010.10.010|issn=1048-9843}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Instrumental variable]] techniques are commonly used to address this problem.

Besides simultaneity, correlation between explanatory variables and the error term can arise when an unobserved or [[Omitted-variable bias|omitted variable]] is [[confounding]] both independent and dependent variables, or when dependent variables are [[Errors-in-variables models|measured with error]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Johnston |authorlink=John Johnston (econometrician) |title=Econometric Methods |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |edition=Second |year=1972 |isbn=0-07-032679-7 |pages=267–291 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exogeneity versus endogeneity ==

In a [[stochastic model]], the notion of the ''usual exogeneity'', ''sequential exogeneity'', ''strong/strict exogeneity'' can be defined. '''Exogeneity''' is articulated in such a way that a variable or variables is exogenous for parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Even if a variable is exogenous for parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, it might be endogenous for parameter &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

When the explanatory variables are not stochastic, then they are strong exogenous for all the parameters.

&lt;!-- The following paragraph is not very good --&gt;
If the [[independent variable]] is [[correlation|correlated]] with the [[error term]] in a [[Regression analysis|regression]] model then the estimate of the regression coefficient in an [[ordinary least squares]] (OLS) regression is [[Bias of an estimator|biased]]; however if the correlation is not contemporaneous, then the coefficient estimate may still be [[Consistent estimator|consistent]]. There are many methods of correcting the bias, including [[instrumental variable]] regression and [[Heckman correction|Heckman selection correction]].

=== Static models ===
The following are some common sources of endogeneity.

==== Omitted variable ====
{{further|Omitted-variable bias}}
In this case, the endogeneity comes from an uncontrolled [[confounding variable]]. A variable is correlated with both an independent variable in the model, and with the error term. (Equivalently, the omitted variable both affects the independent variable and separately affects the dependent variable.) Assume that the "true" model to be estimated is,
: &lt;math&gt; y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i + \gamma z_i + u_i&lt;/math&gt;
but we omit &lt;math&gt;z_i&lt;/math&gt; (perhaps because we don't have a measure for it) when we run our regression. &lt;math&gt;z_i&lt;/math&gt; will get absorbed by the error term and we will actually estimate,
: &lt;math&gt; y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i + \varepsilon_i&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_i=\gamma z_i + u_i&lt;/math&gt;)

If the correlation of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is not 0 and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; separately affects &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; (meaning &lt;math&gt;\gamma \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;), then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is correlated with the error term &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

Here, ''x'' and 1 are not exogenous for ''&amp;alpha;'' and ''&amp;beta;'', since, given ''x'' and 1, the distribution of ''y'' depends not only on ''&amp;alpha;'' and ''&amp;beta;'',  but also on ''z'' and gamma.

==== Measurement error ====

Suppose that we do not get a perfect measure of one of our independent variables. Imagine that instead of observing &lt;math&gt;x^{*}_{i}&lt;/math&gt; we observe &lt;math&gt;x_i=x^{*}_{i}+ \nu_i&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\nu_i&lt;/math&gt; is the measurement "noise". In this case, a model given by
: &lt;math&gt; y_i = \alpha+\beta x^{*}_{i} + \varepsilon_i &lt;/math&gt;
is written in terms of observables and error terms as
: &lt;math&gt; y_i = \alpha+\beta(x_i-\nu_i) + \varepsilon_i &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; y_i = \alpha+\beta x_i +(\varepsilon_i - \beta\nu_i) &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; y_i = \alpha+\beta x_i +u_i &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (where &lt;math&gt;u_i=\varepsilon_i - \beta\nu_i&lt;/math&gt;)
Since both &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; depend on &lt;math&gt;\nu_i&lt;/math&gt;, they are correlated, so the OLS estimation of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; will be biased downward. Measurement error in the dependent variable, however, does not cause endogeneity (though it does increase the variance of the error term).

==== Simultaneity ====
Suppose that two variables are codetermined, with each affecting the other. Suppose that there are two "structural" equations,
:&lt;math&gt;y_i = \beta_1 x_i + \gamma_1 z_i + u_i &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_i = \beta_2 x_i + \gamma_2 y_i + v_i&lt;/math&gt;
Estimating either equation by itself results in endogeneity. In the case of the first structural equation, &lt;math&gt;E(z_i u_i) \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;. Solving for &lt;math&gt;z_i&lt;/math&gt; we get (assuming that &lt;math&gt;1-\gamma_1 \gamma_2 \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt;),
:&lt;math&gt;z_i = \frac{\beta_2 + \gamma_2 \beta_1}{1-\gamma_1 \gamma_2}x_i+\frac{1}{1-\gamma_1 \gamma_2}v_i+\frac{\gamma_2}{1-\gamma_1 \gamma_2}u_i&lt;/math&gt;
Assuming that &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; are uncorrelated with &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt;, we have that,
:&lt;math&gt;E(z_i u_i) = \frac{\gamma_2}{1-\gamma_1 \gamma_2}E(u_i u_i) \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, attempts at estimating either structural equation will be hampered by endogeneity.

=== Dynamic models ===
The endogeneity problem is particularly relevant in the context of [[time series]] analysis of [[causal]] processes. It is common for some factors within a causal system to be dependent for their value in period ''t'' on the values of other factors in the causal system in period ''t''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1. Suppose that the level of pest infestation is independent of all other factors within a given period, but is influenced by the level of rainfall and fertilizer in the preceding period. In this instance it would be correct to say that infestation is [[exogenous]] within the period, but [[endogenous]] over time.

Let the model be ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''z'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''u''. If the variable ''x'' is sequential exogenous for parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and y does not cause x in [[Granger causality|Granger]] sense, then the variable ''x'' is strong/strict exogenous for the parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Simultaneity ====
&lt;!--Expand section with a dynamic simultaneity example --&gt;
Generally speaking, simultaneity occurs in the dynamic model just like in the example of static simultaneity above.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7376">'''Fairtrade Fortnight''' is an annual promotional campaign which happens once every year, organized and funded by the [[Fairtrade Foundation]] to increase awareness of Fairtrade products. It makes use of volunteers who support the goals of Fairtrade but who may also be committed to the more general concepts of fair trade, ethical trading or concerned by development issues. The concept was pioneered by the [[Fairtrade Foundation]] in the [[United Kingdom]], initially held in 1997 in Scotland and directed by [[Barnaby Miln]].

The inaugural national launch was on 12 February 1997&lt;ref&gt;Herald, 13 February 1997, Retailing by Simon Bain&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Evening News, 14 February 1997, Shop around for fair trade by John Vidal&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Augustine United Church]] on [[Edinburgh]]'s George IV Bridge by Lady [[Marion Fraser]], chairman of the charity [[Christian Aid]]. She broke a bar of Fairtrade chocolate to launch the event. It turned out to be a highly successful campaign to get every supermarket throughout Scotland&lt;ref&gt;Life and Work magazine, March 1997, Pester power puts fairness into focus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Episcopalian, April 1997, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian Aid News, April/June 1997, Pester power rules! page 12&lt;/ref&gt; to stock Fairtrade products. Barnaby Miln sent supporters of Christian Aid Scotland, [[SCIAF]], [[Traidcraft]], [[Oxfam]] and the [[World Development Movement]] a list of 85 supermarkets in Scotland's cities and larger towns, and encouraged during the Fortnight to go and ask for Fairtrade products.

'''Fairtrade Fortnight''' spread to the rest of the United Kingdom the following year; today, Fairtrade Fortnights are celebrated in several countries, most notably [[Ireland]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. Awareness raising and promotion of [[Fairtrade labelling|Fairtrade certified products]] to the public are the main objectives of the Fortnight.

Usually events held during the fortnight include:
* Fetes
* Fairs
* [[Fairtrade]] food and drink tastings,
* Fashion shows
* Community, school, college and university events

These events are often supported by local authorities and governments, Fairtrade Steering Groups, dozens of [[charities]] and [[Alternative trading organization|ATOs]], all seeking to ensure that the local populace purchase fair and ethically traded goods. Local schools and colleges where Fairtrade is a frequently discussed topic can also play significant roles during Fairtrade Fortnight.

Events are highlighted and recorded on various nations' Fairtrade licensing bodies' websites (e.g. the [[Fairtrade Foundation]] in the UK or [[Fairtrade Canada]]). Most media outlets are keen to support a fast-growing trend in which previously disadvantaged third world producers have a fairer market to sell their wares and develop their economic capabilities.

'''In 2018 Fairtrade Fortnight is celebrated from 28 February to 11 March.'''

==Criticism of Fairtrade==
{{Main|Fair trade debate}}

Critics in the [[Fair trade debate]] claim that some volunteers can have an incorrect view of Fairtrade, because the information is concealed from them,&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, P. (2012),  “Ethical Objections to Fairtrade”, Journal of Business Ethics (2012) 105:357–373 DOI 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm, Accessed 2 February 2012; Mohan, S. (2010). Fair Trade Without the Froth - a dispassionate economic analysis of 'Fair Trade'. London: Institute of Economic Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular that the evidence that little or none of the extra amount paid by consumers always reaches the producers,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Griffiths, P., ‘Ethical objections to Fairtrade’ Journal of Business Ethics July 2011(DOI) 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 www.springerlink.com Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm; Valkila, J., Haaparanta, P., &amp; Niemi, N.

Nicholls, A. and C. Opal (2005), Fair Trade: Market-Driven Ethical Consumption, London: Sage.;
Sellers, F. S. (2005), ‘Gift-wrapped guilt?’, Washington Post, 18 December.;
&lt;/ref&gt; and an alleged lack of evidence that Fairtrade has a positive impact on Third World producers.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Griffiths, P., ‘Ethical objections to Fairtrade’ Journal of Business Ethics July 2011(DOI) 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 www.springerlink.com Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm; Mohan, S. (2010). Fair Trade Without the Froth - a dispassionate economic analysis of 'Fair Trade'. London: Institute of Economic Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt; This argument is now largely obsolete as FLO-CERT, the Fairtrade Foundation and other nations' representative organisations and overseas development agencies continue to publish commodity reports and market analyses clearly indicating the benefits of the Fairtrade certification scheme over standard free market trade.

Using volunteers who allegedly do not understand the facts has in the past been criticised by Messrs. Davies and Crane&lt;ref&gt;Davies, I.A. and A Crane, ‘Andrew Crane Ethical Decision Making in Fair Trade Companies’, Journal of Business Ethics 45: 79–92, 2003. P84&lt;/ref&gt; in their report that The Day Chocolate Company, "made considerable use of unpaid volunteer workers for routine tasks, many of whom seemed to be under the (false) impression that they were helping out a charity. Not only might one question the sometimes quite excessive use of unpaid labour in a for-profit organisation, but the management team at Day appeared to have no intention of correcting the obvious misapprehensions of the volunteers. However, this did not appear to be acknowledged as a potential ethical problem at Day."

Fairtrade International and The Fairtrade Foundation produce a significant volume of information and resources for volunteers and interested people who wish to learn more about all aspects of the Fairtrade framework, in addition to more in-depth commodity reports and market analyses across all commodity sectors where it licenses products.

In engineering, '''hardware architecture''' refers to the identification of a system's physical components and their interrelationships. This description, often called a '''hardware design model''', allows hardware designers to understand how their components fit into a system architecture and provides to software component designers important information needed for software development and integration. Clear definition of a hardware architecture allows the various traditional engineering disciplines (e.g., electrical and mechanical engineering) to work more effectively together to develop and manufacture new machines, devices and components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rai, L.  |author2=Kang, S.J. |title=Rule-based modular software and hardware architecture for multi-shaped robots using real-time dynamic behavior identification and selection |journal=Knowledge-Based Systems |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=273–283 |year=2008|doi=10.1016/j.knosys.2007.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hardware'' is also an expression used within the computer engineering industry to explicitly distinguish the ([[electronic computer]]) hardware from the ''software'' that runs on it.  But ''hardware,'' within the [[automation]] and [[software engineering]] disciplines, need not simply be a computer of some sort.  A modern automobile runs vastly more ''software'' than the Apollo spacecraft. Also, modern aircraft cannot function without running tens of millions of computer instructions embedded and distributed throughout the aircraft and resident in both standard computer hardware and in specialized hardward components such as IC wired logic gates, analog and hybrid devices, and other digital components. The need to effectively model how separate physical components combine to form complex systems is important over a wide range of applications, including computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), cell phones, surgical instrumentation, satellites, and submarines.

Hardware architecture is the representation of an engineered (or ''to be engineered'') electronic or electromechanical hardware system, and the process and discipline for effectively implementing the [[design]](s) for such a system.  It is generally part of a larger integrated system encompassing [[information]], [[software]], and device [[prototyping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frampton, K.D., Martin, S.E. &amp; Minor, K. |title=The scaling of acoustic streaming for application in micro-fluidic devices |journal=Applied Acoustics |volume=64 |issue=7 |pages=681–692 |year=2003|doi=10.1016/S0003-682X(03)00005-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a ''representation'' because it is used to convey information about the related [[wiktionary:element|elements]] comprising a hardware system, the relationships among those elements, and the [[wiktionary:rule|rules]] governing those relationships.

[[File:Schnittbild drehnatrieb 01.jpg|thumb|left|Electric multi-turn actuator with controls.]]

It is a ''process'' because a sequence of steps is prescribed to produce or change the architecture, and/or a design from that architecture, of a hardware system within a set of constraints.

It is a ''discipline'' because a body of knowledge is used to inform practitioners as to the most effective way to design the system within a set of constraints.

A hardware architecture is primarily concerned with the internal electrical (and, more rarely, the [[Electromechanics|mechanical]]) [[Electrical connector|interface]]s among the system's [[software componentry|components]] or [[system|subsystem]]s, and the [[computer bus|interface]]  between the system and its external environment, especially the devices operated by or the electronic displays viewed by a [[User (computing)|user]].  (This latter, special interface, is known as the [[computer human interface]], ''AKA'' human computer interface, or [[Human-computer interaction|HCI]]; formerly called the man-machine interface.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brunelli, C., Garzia, F. &amp; Nurmi, J. |title=A coarse-grain reconfigurable architecture for multimedia applications featuring subword computation capabilities |journal=Journal of Real-Time Image Processing |volume=3 |issue=1–2 |pages=21–32 |year=2008|doi=10.1007/s11554-008-0071-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integrated circuit (IC) designers are driving current technologies into innovative approaches for new products.

Prior to the advent of digital computers, the electronics and other engineering disciplines used the terms system and hardware as they are still commonly used today.  However, with the arrival of digital computers on the scene and the development of software engineering as a separate discipline, it was often necessary to distinguish among engineered ''hardware'' artifacts, ''software'' artifacts, and the combined artifacts.  

A [[Computer program|programmable]] hardware artifact, or machine, that lacks its computer program is impotent; even as a software artifact, or program, is equally impotent unless it can be used to alter the sequential states of a suitable (hardware) machine.  However, a hardware machine and its programming can be designed to perform an almost illimitable number of abstract and physical tasks.  Within the computer and software engineering disciplines (and, often, other engineering disciplines, such as communications), then, the terms hardware, software, and system came to distinguish between the hardware that runs a [[computer program]], the software, and the hardware device complete with its program.

The ''hardware'' engineer or architect deals (more or less) exclusively with the hardware device; the ''software'' engineer or architect deals (more or less) exclusively with the program; and the ''systems'' engineer or [[systems architect]] is responsible for seeing that the programming is capable of properly running within the hardware device, and that the system composed of the two entities is capable of properly interacting with its external environment, especially the user, and performing its intended function.

A hardware architecture, then, is an abstract representation of an electronic or an electromechanical device capable of running a fixed or changeable program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Assif, D., Himel, R. &amp; Grajower, Y. |title=A new electromechanical device to measure the accuracy of interocclusal records |journal=Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry |volume=59 |issue=6 |pages=672–676 |year=1988|pmid=3165452 |doi=10.1016/0022-3913(88)90380-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zimmermann, M., Volden, T., Kirstein, K.-U., Hafizovic, S., Lichtenberg, J., Brand, O. &amp; Hierlemann, A. |title=A CMOS-based integrated-system architecture for a static cantilever array |journal=Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical |volume=131 |issue=1 |pages=254–264 |year=2008|doi=10.1016/j.snb.2007.11.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A hardware architecture generally includes some form of analog, digital, or hybrid electronic computer, along with electronic and mechanical sensors and actuators. Hardware design may be viewed as a 'partitioning [[Scheme (mathematics)|scheme]],' or [[algorithm]], which considers all of the system's present and foreseeable requirements and arranges the necessary hardware components into a workable set of cleanly [[wikt:bounded|bounded]] [[subsystem]]s with no more parts than are required.  That is, it is a partitioning scheme that is exclusive, inclusive, and [[Collectively exhaustive events|exhaustive]].  A major purpose of the partitioning is to arrange the elements in the hardware subsystems so that there is a minimum of electrical connections and electronic communications needed among them.  In both software and hardware, a good subsystem tends to be seen as a meaningful "[[object (computer science)|object]]."  Moreover, a clear allocation of user requirements to the architecture (hardware and software) provides an effective basis for [[Verification and Validation|validation tests]] of the user's requirements in the as-built system.

Since a state of war has been existing between [[Israel]] and [[Syria]] several independent peace initiatives had taken place. Some of them were symbolic, other included more direct steps to get Israelis and Syrians together. Most of them were led by Israeli citizens and by Syrians living abroad.

==Notable Independent Israel-Syria Peace Initiatives==
* '''Alon Liel''', former [[Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel|Israel Foreign Ministry]] director general [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2001/4/Dr%20Alon%20Liel], held unofficial talks with Syrian mediaries under the Swiss government's patronage over 2004-2007. He had also initiated a peace movement that published a petition by hundreds of [[Golan Heights]] residents to open peace talks with Syria. [http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3431770,00.html].

In [[economics]], an '''indifference curve''' connects points on a graph representing different quantities of two goods, points between which a consumer is ''indifferent''.  That is, the consumer has no [[Preference (economics)|preference]] for one combination or bundle of goods over a different combination on the same curve. One can also refer to each point on the indifference curve as rendering the same level of [[utility]] (satisfaction) for the consumer. In other words, an indifference curve is the [[Locus (mathematics)|locus]] of various points showing different combinations of two goods providing equal utility to the consumer. Utility is then a device to represent [[preference]]s rather than something from which preferences come.&lt;ref name="Geanakoplis (1987), p. 117"&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Geanakoplos |year=1987 |chapter=Arrow-Debreu model of general equilibrium |title=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |volume=1 |pages=116–124 [p. 117] |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main use of indifference curves is in the [[Mathematical problem|representation]] of potentially observable [[demand]] patterns for individual consumers over commodity bundles.&lt;ref name="Böhm and Haller (1987), p. 785"&gt;{{cite book |first=Volker |last=Böhm |first2=Hans |last2=Haller |year=1987 |chapter=Demand theory |title=The [[New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]] |volume=1 |pages=785–792 [p. 785] |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are infinitely many indifference curves: one passes through each combination. A collection of (selected) indifference curves, illustrated graphically, is referred to as an '''indifference map'''.

== History ==
The theory of indifference curves was developed by [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]], who explained in his 1881 book the mathematics needed for their drawing;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupid?key=olbp34052 | isbn= | author=Francis Ysidro Edgeworth | title=Mathematical Psychics: An Essay on the Application of Mathematics to the Moral Sciences | location=London | publisher=C. Kegan Paul and Co. | year=1881 }}&lt;/ref&gt; later on, [[Vilfredo Pareto]] was the first author to actually draw these curves, in his 1906&lt;!---the article said 1906, however, the book reference pointed to a 1919 book; maybe it is a later edition---&gt; book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/manualedieconomi00pareuoft | author=Vilfredo Pareto | title=Manuale di Economia Politica &amp;mdash; con una Introduzione alla Scienza Sociale |trans-title=Manual of Political Economy | location=Milano | publisher=Societa Editrice Libraria | series=Piccola Biblioteca Scientifica | volume=13 | edition= | month= | year=1919 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.policonomics.com/indifference-curves/&lt;/ref&gt; The theory can be derived from [[William Stanley Jevons]]' [[ordinal utility]] theory, which posits that individuals can always rank any consumption bundles by order of preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policonomics.com/william-stanley-jevons/|title=William Stanley Jevons - Policonomics|author=|date=|website=www.policonomics.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Map and properties of indifference curves ==
[[Image:Indifference curve example.png|thumb|240px|right|An example of how indifference curves are obtained as the [[level curves]] of a utility function]]
A graph of indifference curves for several utility levels of an individual consumer is called an '''indifference map'''. Points yielding different utility levels are each associated with distinct indifference curves and these indifference curves on the indifference map are like contour lines on a topographical graph. Each point on the curve represents the same elevation. If you move "off" an indifference curve traveling in a northeast direction (assuming positive marginal utility for the goods) you are essentially climbing a mound of utility. The higher you go the greater the level of utility. The non-satiation requirement means that you will never reach the "top," or a "[[bliss point (economics)|bliss point]]," a consumption bundle that is preferred to all others.

Indifference curves are typically{{vague|reason=Give a few citations of authors who share these requirements; give some notes and citations on authors with deviating requirements.|date=December 2015}} represented{{clarify|reason=Should probably be 'required'.|date=December 2015}} to be:
# Defined only in the non-negative [[Cartesian coordinate system|quadrant]] of commodity quantities (i.e. the possibility of having negative quantities of any good is ignored).
# Negatively sloped. That is, as quantity consumed of one good (X) increases, total satisfaction would increase{{clarify|reason=The article ((Marginal_utility#Quantified marginal utility)) shows an image where increase of a good will eventually (rightmost 3 red and blue points) lead to a decrease of utility. This appears to be inconsistent with a negative-slope requirement for an indifference curve.|date=December 2015}} if not offset by a decrease in the quantity consumed of the other good (Y). Equivalently, [[Economic satiation|satiation]], such that more of either good (or both) is equally preferred to no increase, is excluded.{{clarify|reason=Fig.3 below (on perfect complements) appears to violate this requirement.|date=December 2015}} (If utility ''U = f(x, y)'', ''U'', in the third dimension, does not have a [[Maxima and minima#Functions of more than one variable|local maximum]] for any ''x'' and ''y'' values.){{clarify|reason=Is this another requirement, or is it supposed to be equivalent  to 'negatively sloped'? I can't see that equivalence would hold.|date=December 2015}}  The negative slope of the indifference curve reflects the assumption of the monotonicity of consumer's preferences, which generates monotonically increasing utility functions, and the assumption of non-satiation (marginal utility for all goods is always positive); an upward sloping indifference curve would imply that a consumer is indifferent between a bundle A and another bundle B because they lie on the same indifference curve, even in the case in which the quantity of both goods in bundle B is higher. Because of monotonicity of preferences and non-satiation, a bundle with more of both goods must be preferred to one with less of both, thus the first bundle must yield a higher utility, and lie on a different indifference curve at a higher utility level. The negative slope of the indifference curve implies that the [[marginal rate of substitution]] is always positive;
# [[Total order|Complete]], such that all points on an indifference curve are ranked equally preferred and ranked either more or less preferred than every other point not on the curve. So, with (2), no two curves can intersect (otherwise non-satiation would be violated).
# [[Transitive relation#Examples|Transitive]] with respect to points on distinct indifference curves. That is, if each point on ''I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is (strictly) preferred to each point on ''I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', and each point on ''I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' is preferred to each point on ''I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', each point on ''I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' is preferred to each point on ''I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''. A negative slope and transitivity exclude indifference curves crossing, since straight lines from the origin on both sides of where they crossed would give opposite and intransitive preference rankings.
# (Strictly) [[convex function|convex]]. With (2), [[convex preferences]]{{clarify|reason=The target article also gives examples of non-convex preferences. It appears that this property isn't always requirement.|date=December 2015}} imply that the indifference curves cannot be concave to the origin, i.e. they will either be straight lines or bulge toward the origin of the indifference curve. If the latter is the case, then as a consumer decreases consumption of one good in successive units, successively larger doses of the [[composite good|other good]] are required to keep satisfaction unchanged.

== Assumptions of consumer preference theory ==
*Preferences are '''complete'''. The consumer has ranked all available alternative combinations of commodities in terms of the satisfaction they provide him.
:Assume that there are two consumption bundles ''A'' and ''B'' each containing two commodities ''x'' and ''y''. A consumer can unambiguously determine that one and only one of the following is the case:
:*''A'' is preferred to ''B'', formally written as ''A'' &lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; ''B''&lt;ref name="Binger"&gt;{{cite book |last=Binger |last2=Hoffman |year=1998 |title=Microeconomics with Calculus |edition=2nd |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Reading |isbn=0-321-01225-9 |pages=109–117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*''B'' is preferred to ''A'', formally written as ''B'' &lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; ''A''&lt;ref name="Binger"/&gt;
:*''A'' is indifferent to ''B'', formally written as ''A'' &lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; ''B''&lt;ref name="Binger"/&gt;
:This axiom precludes the possibility that the consumer cannot decide,&lt;ref name="Perloff 2008. p. 62"&gt;{{cite book |last=Perloff |first=Jeffrey M. |authorlink=Jeffrey M. Perloff|year=2008 |title=Microeconomics: Theory &amp; Applications with Calculus |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-321-27794-7 |page=62 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It assumes that a consumer is able to make this comparison with respect to every conceivable bundle of goods.&lt;ref name="Binger"/&gt;
*Preferences are '''reflexive'''
:This means that if ''A'' and ''B'' are identical in all respects the consumer will recognize this fact and be indifferent in comparing ''A'' and ''B''
:*''A'' = ''B'' ⇒ ''A'' &lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; ''B''&lt;ref name="Binger"/&gt;
*Preferences are '''transitive'''{{refn|The transitivity of weak preferences is sufficient for most indifference-curve analyses: If ''A'' is weakly preferred to ''B'', meaning that the consumer likes ''A'' ''at least as much'' as ''B'', and ''B'' is weakly preferred to ''C'', then ''A'' is weakly preferred to ''C''.&lt;ref name="Perloff 2008. p. 62"/&gt;|group=nb}}
:*If ''A'' &lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; ''B'' and ''B'' &lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; ''C'', then ''A'' &lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; ''C''.&lt;ref name="Binger"/&gt;
:*Also if ''A'' &lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; ''B'' and ''B'' &lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; ''C'', then ''A'' &lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; ''C''.&lt;ref name="Binger"/&gt;
:This is a consistency assumption.
*Preferences are '''continuous'''
:*If ''A'' is preferred to ''B'' and ''C'' is sufficiently close to ''B'' then ''A'' is preferred to ''C''.
:*''A'' &lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; ''B'' and ''C'' → ''B'' ⇒ ''A'' &lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; ''C''.
:"Continuous" means infinitely divisible - just like there are infinitely many numbers between 1 and 2 all bundles are infinitely divisible. This assumption makes indifference curves continuous.
*Preferences exhibit '''strong monotonicity'''
:*If ''A'' has more of both ''x'' and ''y'' than ''B'', then ''A'' is preferred to ''B''.
:This assumption is commonly called the "more is better" assumption.
:An alternative version of this assumption requires that if ''A'' and ''B'' have the same quantity of one good, but ''A'' has more of the other, then ''A'' is preferred to ''B''.
It also implies that the commodities are '''good''' rather than '''bad'''. Examples of '''bad''' commodities can be disease, pollution etc. because we always desire less of such things.
*Indifference curves exhibit '''diminishing marginal rates of substitution'''
:*The marginal rate of substitution tells how much 'y' a person is willing to sacrifice to get one more unit of 'x'.{{clarify|reason=After having explained 'marginal rate of substitution', explain when they are called 'diminishing.|date=December 2015}}
:*This assumption assures that indifference curves are smooth and convex to the origin.
:*This assumption also set the stage for using techniques of constrained optimization because the shape of the curve assures that the first derivative is negative and the second is positive.
:*Another name for this assumption is the '''substitution assumption'''.  It is the most critical assumption of consumer theory: Consumers are willing to give up or trade-off some of one good to get more of another. The fundamental assertion is that there is a maximum amount that "a consumer will give up, of one commodity, to get one unit of another good, in that amount which will leave the consumer indifferent between the new and old situations"&lt;ref name="Silberberg"&gt;{{cite book |last=Silberberg |last2=Suen |year=2000 |title=The Structure of Economics: A Mathematical Analysis |edition=3rd |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=Boston |isbn=0-07-118136-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The negative slope of  the indifference curves represents the willingness of the consumer to make a trade off.&lt;ref name="Silberberg"/&gt;
&lt;!-- If reflexivity is needed, it seems rather odd to assume also irreflexivity. And the definition of negative transitivity seems not to be correct.
*There are also many sub-assumptions:{{clarify|reason=Why are they called so? Are they inferior? Do they follow from the above assumptions? Are they debated in the literature?|date=December 2015}}
:*Irreflexivity - for no ''x'' is ''x'' &lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; ''x''
:*Negative transitivity - if not ''x'' &lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; ''y'', then for any third commodity{{clarify|reason=Should be 'bundle'?|date=December 2015}} ''z'', either not ''x'' &lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; ''z'', or not ''z'' &lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; ''y'', or neither of them.
--&gt;

=== Application ===
[[File:Indifference curves showing budget line.svg|thumb|right|To maximise utility, a household should consume at (Qx, Qy). Assuming it does, a full demand schedule can be deduced as the price of one good fluctuates.]]

[[Consumer theory]] uses indifference curves and budget constraints to generate [[Supply and demand|consumer demand curves]]. For a single consumer, this is a relatively simple process. First, let one good be an example market e.g., carrots, and let the other be a composite of all other goods. Budget constraints give a straight line on the indifference map showing all the possible distributions between the two goods; the point of maximum utility is then the point at which an indifference curve is tangent to the budget line (illustrated). This follows from common sense: if the market values a good more than the household, the household will sell it; if the market values a good less than the household, the household will buy it. The process then continues until the market's and household's marginal rates of substitution are equal.&lt;ref name="Lipsey 1975. pp. 182-186"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Positive Economics |edition=Fourth |first=Richard G. |last=Lipsey |year=1975 |publisher=[[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]] | isbn=0-297-76899-9 |pages=182–186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, if the price of carrots were to change, and the price of all other goods were to remain constant, the gradient of the budget line would also change, leading to a different point of tangency and a different quantity demanded. These price / quantity combinations can then be used to deduce a full demand curve.&lt;ref name="Lipsey 1975. pp. 182-186"/&gt; A line connecting all points of tangency between the indifference curve and the [[budget constraint]] is called the [[expansion path]].&lt;ref name="Salvatore"&gt;{{cite book |last=Salvatore |first=Dominick |year=1989 |title=Schaum's Outline of Theory and Problems of Managerial Economics |location= |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=0-07-054513-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples of indifference curves ===
&lt;gallery class="center"&gt;
File:Simple-indifference-curves.svg|Figure 1: An example of an indifference map with three indifference curves represented
File:Indifference-curves-perfect-substitutes.svg|Figure 2: Three indifference curves where Goods ''X'' and ''Y'' are perfect substitutes. The gray line perpendicular to all curves indicates the curves are mutually parallel.
File:Indifference-curves-perfect-complements.svg|Figure 3: Indifference curves for perfect complements ''X'' and ''Y''. The elbows of the curves are [[collinear]].
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In Figure 1, the consumer would rather be on ''I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' than ''I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', and would rather be on ''I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' than ''I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', but does not care where he/she is on a given indifference curve. The slope of an indifference curve (in absolute value), known by economists as the [[marginal rate of substitution]], shows the rate at which consumers are willing to give up one good in exchange for more of the other good. For ''most'' goods the marginal rate of substitution is not constant so their indifference curves are curved. The curves are convex to the origin, describing  the negative [[substitution effect]]. As price rises for a fixed money income, the consumer seeks the less expensive substitute at a lower indifference curve. The substitution effect is reinforced through the [[income effect]] of lower real income (Beattie-LaFrance). An example of a utility function that generates indifference curves of this kind is the Cobb–Douglas function &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle U\left(x,y\right)=x^\alpha y^{1-\alpha }, 0 \leq \alpha \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;. The negative slope of the indifference curve incorporates the willingness of the consumer to make trade offs.&lt;ref name="Silberberg"/&gt;

If two goods are [[substitute good|perfect substitutes]] then the indifference curves will have a constant slope since the consumer would be willing to switch between at a fixed ratio. The marginal rate of substitution between perfect substitutes is likewise constant. An example of a utility function that is associated with indifference curves like these would be &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle U\left(x,y\right)=\alpha x + \beta y&lt;/math&gt;.

If two goods are [[complement good|perfect complements]] then the indifference curves will be L-shaped. Examples of perfect complements include left shoes compared to right shoes: the consumer is no better off having several right shoes if she has only one left shoe - additional right shoes have zero marginal utility without more left shoes, so bundles of goods differing only in the number of right shoes they include - however many - are equally preferred. The marginal rate of substitution is either zero or infinite. An example of the type of utility function that has an indifference map like that above is the Leontief function: &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle U\left(x,y\right)= \min \{ \alpha x, \beta y \}&lt;/math&gt;.

The different shapes of the curves imply different responses to a change in price as shown from demand analysis in [[consumer theory]]. The results will only be stated here. A price-budget-line change that kept a consumer in  equilibrium on the same indifference curve:
:in Fig. 1 would reduce quantity demanded of a good smoothly as price rose relatively for that good.
:in Fig. 2 would have either no effect on quantity demanded of either good (at one end of the budget constraint) or would change quantity demanded from one end of the budget constraint to the other.
:in Fig. 3 would have no effect on equilibrium quantities demanded, since the budget line would rotate around the corner of the indifference curve.{{refn|Indifference curves can be used to derive the individual demand curve. However, the assumptions of consumer preference theory do not guarantee that the demand curve will have a negative slope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Binger |last2=Hoffman |year=1998 |title=Microeconomics with Calculus |edition=2nd |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Reading |isbn=0-321-01225-9 |pages=141–143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}}

== Preference relations and utility ==
Choice theory formally represents consumers by a '''preference relation''', and use this representation to derive indifference curves showing combinations of equal preference to the consumer.

=== Preference relations ===
Let
:&lt;math&gt;A\;&lt;/math&gt; be a set of mutually exclusive alternatives among which a consumer can choose.
:&lt;math&gt;a\;&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b\;&lt;/math&gt; be generic elements of &lt;math&gt;A\;&lt;/math&gt;.
In the language of the example above, the set &lt;math&gt;A\;&lt;/math&gt; is made of combinations of apples and bananas. The symbol &lt;math&gt;a\;&lt;/math&gt; is one such combination, such as 1 apple and 4 bananas and &lt;math&gt;b\;&lt;/math&gt; is another combination such as 2 apples and 2 bananas.

A preference relation, denoted &lt;math&gt;\succeq&lt;/math&gt;, is a [[binary relation]] define on the set &lt;math&gt;A\;&lt;/math&gt;.

The statement
:&lt;math&gt;a\succeq b\;&lt;/math&gt;
is described as '&lt;math&gt;a\;&lt;/math&gt; is weakly preferred to &lt;math&gt;b\;&lt;/math&gt;.' That is, &lt;math&gt;a\;&lt;/math&gt; is at least as good as &lt;math&gt;b\;&lt;/math&gt; (in preference satisfaction).

The statement
:&lt;math&gt;a\sim b\;&lt;/math&gt;
is described as '&lt;math&gt;a\;&lt;/math&gt; is weakly preferred to &lt;math&gt;b\;&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;b\;&lt;/math&gt; is weakly preferred to &lt;math&gt;a\;&lt;/math&gt;.' That is, one is ''indifferent'' to the choice of &lt;math&gt;a\;&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;b\;&lt;/math&gt;, meaning not that they are unwanted but that they are equally good in satisfying preferences.

The statement
:&lt;math&gt;a\succ b\;&lt;/math&gt;
is described as '&lt;math&gt;a\;&lt;/math&gt; is weakly preferred to &lt;math&gt;b\;&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;b\;&lt;/math&gt; is not weakly preferred to &lt;math&gt;a\;&lt;/math&gt;.' One says that '&lt;math&gt;a\;&lt;/math&gt; is strictly preferred to &lt;math&gt;b\;&lt;/math&gt;.'

The preference relation &lt;math&gt;\succeq&lt;/math&gt; is '''complete''' if all pairs &lt;math&gt;a,b\;&lt;/math&gt; can be ranked. The relation is a [[transitive relation]] if whenever &lt;math&gt;a\succeq b\;&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b\succeq c,\;&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;a\succeq c\;&lt;/math&gt;.

For any element &lt;math&gt;a \in A\;&lt;/math&gt;, the corresponding indifference curve, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_a&lt;/math&gt; is made up of all elements of &lt;math&gt;A\;&lt;/math&gt; which are indifferent to &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.  Formally,

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_a=\{b \in A:b \sim a\}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Formal link to utility theory ===

In the example above, an element &lt;math&gt;a\;&lt;/math&gt; of the set &lt;math&gt;A\;&lt;/math&gt; is made of two numbers: The number of apples, call it &lt;math&gt;x,\;&lt;/math&gt; and the number of bananas, call it &lt;math&gt;y.\;&lt;/math&gt;

In [[utility]] theory, the [[utility function]] of an [[agent (economics)|agent]] is a function that ranks ''all'' pairs of consumption bundles by order of preference (''completeness'') such that any set of three or more bundles forms a [[transitive relation]]. This means that for each bundle &lt;math&gt;\left(x,y\right)&lt;/math&gt; there is a unique relation, &lt;math&gt;U\left(x,y\right)&lt;/math&gt;, representing the [[utility]] (satisfaction) relation associated with &lt;math&gt;\left(x,y\right)&lt;/math&gt;. The relation &lt;math&gt;\left(x,y\right)\to U\left(x,y\right)&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[utility function]]. The [[Range (mathematics)|range]] of the function is a set of [[real numbers]]. The actual values of the function have no importance. Only the ranking of those values has content for the theory. More precisely, if &lt;math&gt;U(x,y)\geq U(x',y')&lt;/math&gt;, then the bundle &lt;math&gt;\left(x,y\right)&lt;/math&gt; is described as at least as good as the bundle &lt;math&gt;\left(x',y'\right)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;U\left(x,y\right)&gt;U\left(x',y'\right)&lt;/math&gt;, the bundle &lt;math&gt;\left(x,y\right)&lt;/math&gt; is described as strictly preferred to the bundle &lt;math&gt;\left(x',y'\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Consider a particular bundle &lt;math&gt;\left(x_0,y_0\right)&lt;/math&gt; and take the [[total derivative]] of &lt;math&gt;U\left(x,y\right)&lt;/math&gt; about this point:

:&lt;math&gt;dU\left(x_0,y_0\right)=U_1\left(x_0,y_0\right)dx+U_2\left(x_0,y_0\right)dy &lt;/math&gt; 

or, without loss of generality,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dU\left(x_0,y_0\right)}{dx}= U_1(x_0,y_0).1+ U_2(x_0,y_0)\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; '''(Eq. 1)'''

where &lt;math&gt;U_1\left(x,y\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the partial derivative of &lt;math&gt;U\left(x,y\right)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to its first argument, evaluated at &lt;math&gt;\left(x,y\right)&lt;/math&gt;. (Likewise for &lt;math&gt;U_2\left(x,y\right).&lt;/math&gt;)

The indifference curve through &lt;math&gt;\left(x_0,y_0\right)&lt;/math&gt; must deliver at each bundle on the curve the same utility level as bundle &lt;math&gt;\left(x_0,y_0\right)&lt;/math&gt;. That is, when preferences are represented by a utility function, the indifference curves are the [[level curve]]s of the utility function. Therefore, if one is to change the quantity of &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;dx\,&lt;/math&gt;, without moving off the indifference curve, one must also change the quantity of &lt;math&gt;y\,&lt;/math&gt; by an amount &lt;math&gt;dy\,&lt;/math&gt; such that, in the end, there is no change in ''U'':
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dU\left(x_0,y_0\right)}{dx}= 0&lt;/math&gt;, or, substituting ''0'' into ''(Eq. 1)'' above to solve for ''dy/dx'':
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dU\left(x_0,y_0\right)}{dx} = 0\Leftrightarrow\frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac{U_1(x_0,y_0)}{U_2(x_0,y_0)}&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, the ratio of marginal utilities gives the absolute value of the [[slope]] of the indifference curve at point &lt;math&gt;\left(x_0,y_0\right)&lt;/math&gt;. This ratio is called the [[marginal rate of substitution]] between &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y\,&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Examples ===

==== Linear utility ====

If the utility function is of the form &lt;math&gt;U\left(x,y\right)=\alpha x+\beta y&lt;/math&gt; then the marginal utility of &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;U_1\left(x,y\right)=\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and the marginal utility of &lt;math&gt;y\,&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;U_2\left(x,y\right)=\beta&lt;/math&gt;. The slope of the indifference curve is, therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dy}=-\frac{\beta}{\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;
Observe that the slope does not depend on &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y\,&lt;/math&gt;: the indifference curves are straight lines.

==== Cobb–Douglas utility ====

If the utility function is of the form &lt;math&gt;U\left(x,y\right)=x^\alpha y^{1-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; the marginal utility of &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;U_1\left(x,y\right)=\alpha \left(x/y\right)^{\alpha-1}&lt;/math&gt; and the marginal utility of &lt;math&gt;y\,&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;U_2\left(x,y\right)=(1-\alpha) \left(x/y\right)^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;.Where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;. The [[slope]] of the indifference curve, and therefore the negative of the [[marginal rate of substitution]], is then
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dy}=-\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}\left(\frac{x}{y}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

==== CES utility ====

A general CES ([[Constant Elasticity of Substitution]]) form is
:&lt;math&gt;U(x,y)=\left(\alpha x^\rho +(1-\alpha)y^\rho\right)^{1/\rho}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in(0,1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho\leq 1&lt;/math&gt;. (The [[Cobb–Douglas]] is a special case of the CES utility, with &lt;math&gt;\rho\rightarrow 0\,&lt;/math&gt;.) The marginal utilities are given by
:&lt;math&gt;U_1(x,y)=\alpha \left(\alpha x^\rho +(1-\alpha)y^\rho\right)^{\left(1/\rho\right)-1} x^{\rho-1}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;U_2(x,y)=(1-\alpha)\left(\alpha x^\rho +(1-\alpha)y^\rho\right)^{\left(1/\rho\right)-1} y^{\rho-1}.&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, along an indifference curve,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dy}=-\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)^{1-\rho}.&lt;/math&gt;
These examples might be useful for [[model (economics)|modelling]] individual or aggregate demand.

==== Biology ====
As used in [[biology]], the indifference curve is a model for how animals 'decide' whether to perform a particular behavior, based on changes in two variables which can increase in intensity, one along the x-axis and the other along the y-axis.  For example, the x-axis may measure the quantity of food available while the y-axis measures the risk involved in obtaining it.  The indifference curve is drawn to predict the animal's behavior at various levels of risk and food availability.

== Critics &amp; discussion ==
Indifference curve inherit the [[Utility#Discussion and criticism|critics on the utility]].

[[Herbert Hovenkamp]] (1991)&lt;ref name="Hovenkamp"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hovenkamp |first=Herbert |date=1991 |title=Legal Policy and the Endowment Effect |journal=The Journal of Legal Studies |volume=20 |issue=2 |page=225 |doi=10.1086/467886}}&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that the presence of an [[endowment effect]] has significant implications for [[law]] and [[economics]], particularly in regard to [[welfare economics]]. He argues that the presence of an endowment effect indicates that a person has no [[indifference curve]] (see however Hanemann, 1991&lt;ref name="Hanemann"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hanemann |first=W. Michael |date=1991 |title=Willingness To Pay and Willingness To Accept: How Much Can They Differ?

On March 17, 1808, [[Napoleon I]] created three decrees&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.be/books?id=S4RCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA248 Pasinomie, XIV, p. 247]&lt;/ref&gt; in a failed attempt to bring equality and to integrate the Jews into French society after the Jewish Emancipation of 1790-1791. The '''Infamous Decree''', the third of the three, had adverse effects. Although the decrees´ aim was to further emancipate the Jews into equal citizenship, it restricted Jewish money lending (Catholics were not permitted to commit acts of usury, or the charging of interest as profit  on loans), it annulled all debts owed to Jews by non Jewish debtors and limited the residency of new Jewish peoples in France by   restricting all business activities while allowing work in agriculture and regular craftsmanship. The combination of these decrees severely weakened the financial position of once dominant rural French money lending Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
[[Napoleon Bonaparte]] initially won allegiance of Jews when in 1797 he emancipated Jews in Ancona, Italy. He officially chose two High Priests of the Jewish Nation and seven councillors to the High Priests. He allegedly encouraged Jews to reclaim [[Jerusalem]] in 1799 with the help of his army in a letter to a rabbi in [[Jerusalem]], but the letter is suspected by many to be a forgery. He in no way acted against the Jews until the early 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzfuchs, Simon. Napoleon, the Jews and the Sanhedrin. Boston: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; when he passed a series of three decrees, one of which became known as the Infamous Decree. Some, such as author Franz Kobler, attribute [[Napoleon]]’s change in attitude to [[Napoleon]]’s new attachment to France and his newfound desire to protect the interests of the French people. When he was the hero of the Jews, he still was an "ardent patriot" of his home island of [[Corsica]].&lt;ref&gt;Kobler, Franz. Napoleon and the Jews. New York,: Schocken Books, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, quite early in the Nineteenth Century, Jewish moneylenders were accused of [[usury]], in [[Alsace]], as well as of abusing other rights, which were given to them in their emancipation in 1791 under [[Louis XVI]]. Napoleon sided with popular French opinion. Though he desired equality for the Jews, he called them "the most despicable of men" and proclaimed he did not want their number to increase in an 1808 letter to his brother Jerome.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzfuchs, Simon. Napoleon, the Jews and the Sanhedrin. Boston: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Napoleon]] issued an imperial decree in 1806 that suspended payment of debts owed to Jewish moneylenders for one year to warn against usury to the supposedly degenerate Jewish population and called a conference with Jewish leaders. The group he conferred with was dubbed the Great [[Sanhedrin]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzfuchs, Simon. Napoleon, the Jews, and the Sanhedrin. Boston: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; and met in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;Kobler, Franz. Napoleon and the Jews. New York: Schocken Books, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the first meeting of the Great [[Sanhedrin]] on February 4, 1807 was ceremonial and solemn, the group was largely ineffective as nothing was done during the month they met to ameliorate the conditions on the Jews that would be imposed by the coming decrees. During the eight sessions, the Great [[Sanhedrin]] was forced to condone intermarriage between Frenchmen and Jews in order that the Jewish people might be absorbed into France,&lt;ref&gt;Jaher, Frederic Cople. The Jews and the Nation: Revolution, Emancipation, State Formantion, and the Liberal Paradigm in America and France. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; since Jews were considered substandard citizens&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzfuchs, Simon. Napoleon, the Jews and the Sanhedrin. Boston: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; and needed to be either absorbed or expelled. The group also had to support other actions to assimilate the Jews by removing their Jewish ties, such as approving military service to attach young Jewish men to France rather than to their religion and ethnic background. Such measures were a prelude to the passing of the three decrees on March 17, 1808.&lt;ref&gt;Jaher, Frederic Cople. The Jews and the Nation: Revolution, Emancipation, State Formation, and the Liberal Paradigm in America and France. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actual decree==
After [[Napoleon]]’s emancipation of the Jews he "wanted to mandate what some proponents of emancipation had hoped would happen, namely the total assimilation, or biological fusion of Jews with the rest of the French people."&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; To mandate the assimilation of Jews into French society, three decrees were issued on March 17, 1808.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "first two decrees restored order to the informal Jewish communities that had survived the revolution by establishing a hierarchical, centralized organization, under the aegis of the ministry of religions."&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The first two decrees set up the [[Consistory (Judaism)|consistories]] which were designed to enforce the decrees. Some of the members also were a part of the Great [[Sanhedrin]] which met in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;Jaher, Frederic Cople. The Jews and the Nation: Revolution, Emancipation, State Formation, and the Liberal Paradigm in America and France. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Consistory (Judaism)|consistories]] consisted of a grand rabbi, possibly another rabbi and three lay members who were residents of the town. The consistories acted to enforce [[Sanhedrin]] rules through the use of education; they also worked as informants to the government which was monitoring Jewish activity.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; There was one consistory for every town that contained 2,000 or more Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Berkovitz, Jay R. Rites and Passages: The Beginnings of Modern Jewish Culture in France. Philadelphia: University of Philadelphia Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Infamous Decree, also known as the "third decree," presumed all Jews guilty of chicanery (the use of trickery to achieve a political, financial or legal purpose) unless proven innocent, and restricted Jewish commerce and money lending for a period of 10 years."&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  This decree was put into place to end Jewish money lending. It annulled all debts owed to Jews by married women, minors, and soldiers and voided any loan that had interest rates exceeding 10 percent. This was an attempt by Napoleon to get rid of alleged [[usury]] by Jewish businessmen and to turn these former businessmen into craftsman and farmers to promote supposed equality between the Jews and non-Jews in France.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; To encourage Jews to move into this niche, the Jews were restricted in changing residency to certain parts of France unless they "acquired rural property and devoted themselves to agriculture without entering into any commercial or business transactions."&lt;ref&gt;The Jew in the Modern World: A Documentary History, edited by Paul Mendes-Flohr and Jehuda Reinharz. New York: Oxford University Press Inc., 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; To keep tabs on businesses that had survived the new restrictions, the decree mandated that all business require a patent or license that had to be renewed yearly.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did the decree hurt the Jews economically but it changed their military rights.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, Shulamit S. Jewish Emancipation in a German City: Cologne, 1798-1871. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final restriction of the Jews was an attempt to strengthen their bond with the government and the country. The decree made it so that the Jewish conscripts (required enlistees of military) couldn’t find replacements for themselves when drafted like other Frenchmen were allowed to do.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, Shulamit S. Jewish Emancipation in a German City: Cologne, 1798-1871. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of the first three decrees, another and final decree was implemented on July 20, 1808. This final decree declared that all Jews acquire a fixed family name to help the government and consistories supervise the Jews movements. They were restricted in their choice of names and weren’t allowed to pick names from the Hebrew Bible or any town names.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, Shulamit S. Jewish Emancipation in a German City: Cologne, 1798-1871. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three decrees were set up to expire after 10 years and would only be continued if renewed after that period. In 1818 [[Louis XVIII]] opted to not renew the decree and thus it ended. [[Louis XVIII]] was thereafter known as the "liberator of Jews."&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, Shulamit S. Jewish Emancipation in a German City: Cologne, 1798-1871. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==After effects==
After the decrees were not renewed after 10 years, Jews migrated into three main areas: Paris, Alsace and Lorraine. Indications of cultural and economical change can be seen in these areas. Although these changes were devastating to the economy of the Jews, they greatly increased the population and the distribution of the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Jews continued to live as lower class citizens. They were peddlers, clothes dealers, cattle merchants and small-scale commercial agents. The decree made business in the French Jewry more difficult. They could not have gone into farming or artistry because other bans took away their ability to own any land or belong to guilds. The Jews could not use their commercial skills because without the ability to own land, the Jewish businessmen could not experience any kind of expansion. But as time went by, more and more Jews began to go into artistry.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In Bordeaux, for example, 34 Jews worked as artisans and professionals. 66 Jews owned houses in the city and 39 were proprietors of rural land. Percentages of artisans in the city of [[Paris]] and [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] increased also. These different economical changes were accompanied by the union of Jewish youth in the public school system.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were many concerns with Jewish youth and the public school system. There was discrimination and talk of conversions. Only 10 percent of Jewish children attended public school in Alsace. One government Jewish official said, "Our schools are Catholic schools rather than public schools. Prayers according to the Roman religion are recited upon entering and leaving, the catechism of the same religion is taught there and the textbook used are of that same religion." &lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1810, a few Jews went to local schools and moved to [[Lycée]], but many Jewish parents neglected their children’s education to prepare them into business. Jews gradually moved into public schools, and some even hired private tutors. Some parents home schooled their daughters to teach them music, dance and embroidery.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emancipation led to the redistribution of the Jewish population in France. Jews migrated to the cities and to communes where there had not previously been a Jewish population.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; French Jews went to [[Paris]], by 1809 there were more than 2900 Jews there. The total Jewish population grew to more than 46,000 in Alsace.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International Futures (IFs)''' is a global [[integrated assessment modelling|integrated assessment model]] designed to help in thinking strategically and systematically about key global systems (economic, demographic, education, health, environment, technology, domestic governance, infrastructure, agriculture, energy and environment) housed at the Frederick S. Pardee Center for International Futures. Initially created by [[Barry B. Hughes]] of the [[Josef Korbel School of International Studies]] at the [[University of Denver]] in [[Colorado]],&lt;ref&gt;Documentation can be found at http://www.ifs.du.edu regarding the history of IFs, specifically http://www.ifs.du.edu/ifs/IfsWebSite/IFs%20History.htm gives an overview of the different generations of IFs development.  See this for a TEDx talk about the model:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at47WLuA8Ks&lt;/ref&gt; the model is free for public use in both its online and downloadable forms.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Hughes,and  Evan Hillebrand  Paradigm Publishing, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Pardee Center for International Futures has partnered with many organizations to produce forecasts and data analysis.  IFs has been utilized in the [[National Intelligence Council|National Intelligence Council's]] ''Global Trends 2020'', ''Global Trends 2025'', and ''Global Trends 2030'' report.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.foia.cia.gov/2020/2020.pdf ''Mapping the Future: Report of the National Intelligence Council's 2020 Report'']  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916051336/http://www.foia.cia.gov/2020/2020.pdf |date=2012-09-16 }} and [http://www.aicpa.org/research/cpahorizons2025/globalforces/downloadabledocuments/globaltrends.pdf ''Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813062044/http://www.aicpa.org/research/cpahorizons2025/globalforces/downloadabledocuments/globaltrends.pdf |date=2012-08-13 }} and [http://www.dni.gov/index.php/carousel-items/778-global-trends-2030-alternative-worlds-available-for-download ''Global Trends 2030:  Alternative Worlds''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215110105/http://www.dni.gov/index.php/carousel-items/778-global-trends-2030-alternative-worlds-available-for-download |date=2012-12-15 }} [[Director of National Intelligence]]&lt;/ref&gt; The International Futures model has also contributed to the United Nations ''[[Human Development Report]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/global/hdr2011/papers/HDRP_2011_08.pdf ''Forecasting the Impacts of Environmental Constraints on Human Development'']&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Global Environment Outlook|Global Environmental Outlook]]''.

IFs is hosted free for public use by [[Google Public Data Explorer]], the [[Atlantic Council]], and the [[Institute for Security Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;For hosts of the web-based version of the model, see International Futures on [http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=n4ff2muj8bh2a_ Google Public Data Explorer], The Atlantic Council and the [http://www.acus.org/program/strategic-foresight-initiative Strategic Foresight Initiative] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115045307/http://www.acus.org/program/strategic-foresight-initiative |date=2012-11-15 }}, and the Institute for Security Studies, as a part of the [http://www.issafrica.org/futures African Futures Project].  Additionally, the web version of the model is found on the [http://www.ifs.du.edu/ifs/Ifs.aspx International Futures] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Model structure ==
The model incorporates  dynamically linked  sub-models.  They include:  population, economic, agricultural, educational, energy, socio-political, international political, environmental, health, infrastructure and  technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifs.du.edu/introduction/elements.aspx Elements of International Futures], a structural explanation of the IFs model with block diagram.&lt;/ref&gt;  IFs is a unique modeling tool because it endogenizes the impact of such a wide range of global systems for 183 countries.

The help system that accompanies the software&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifs.du.edu/ifs Index&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; provides an extensive overview of the model structure and computer code used to write the model.  IFs has three main functions, all connected to its conceptual treatment of integrated assessment forecasts: data analysis, scenario analysis, and display.&lt;ref&gt;An extended introductory video is found here:  http://vimeo.com/11090851&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data analysis ==
[[File:Crosssect.jpg|thumb|right|Example of cross-sectional analysis of [[total fertility rate]] and [[GDP]] per capita at [[purchasing power parity]]]]
The data analysis section of IFs represents a collection of over 2,000 data series from all major international data gatherers.  It is constantly updated with new data series.  This data forms the foundation of the model structure.  Users can analyze historic data cross-sectionally, longitudinally or on a [[world map]].  Using [[cross-sectional analysis]], users can  select a [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] and plot this against up to 5 [[independent variables]].  It is then possible to animate the map to see how the cross-sectional relationship changes across the 40+ years of data in the [[database]].  Longitudinally, users can plot the relationship between a [[dependent variable]] and time, from 1960 (for most data series) through the most recent data year available.  A world map allows users to display data from any of these series using [[GIS]] options.

== Scenario analysis ==
[[File:IFsWorldPopulationHistoryForecastII.jpg|thumb|right| Forecast of world population for four [[UNEP]] scenarios from 1960&amp;ndash;2100]]

The software allows users to access and change the [[parameters]] and [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] that are used in the model. The [[scenario analysis|Scenario Analysis]] display lets users create their own global scenario or load a pre-run global scenario in their field of interest.  For example, to analyze the effects of a policy intervention on different sub-models and variables within the model, make the changes to the appropriate variable and then analyze the results in comparison to the base-case.  Many pre-run scenarios come packaged with the model, including work that has been completed for the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.unep.org/geo/GEO4/report/GEO-4_Report_Full_en.pdf ''Global Environmental Outlook 4''] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090707225845/http://www.unep.org/geo/geo4/report/GEO-4_Report_Full_en.pdf |date=2009-07-07 }} that IFs made a contribution to&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Intelligence Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foia.cia.gov/2020/2020.pdf ''Mapping the Future: Report of the National Intelligence Council's 2020 Report'']  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916051336/http://www.foia.cia.gov/2020/2020.pdf |date=2012-09-16 }} and [http://www.aicpa.org/research/cpahorizons2025/globalforces/downloadabledocuments/globaltrends.pdf ''Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813062044/http://www.aicpa.org/research/cpahorizons2025/globalforces/downloadabledocuments/globaltrends.pdf |date=2012-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Display ==
[[File:Mortalitydisplay.jpg|thumb|right|Example of mortality display for Belgium in 2025]]
This portion of the software allows users to display the forecast results of their scenario analyses for different provinces, countries and groups across different issue areas.  Some of the specialized displays include: population, educational attainment, mortality rate, [[World Values Survey]], [[Gini coefficient]], the [[Millennium Development Goals]], [[social accounting matrix]], advanced sustainability analysis, and [[World Bank]] financial flows.

== Pardee Center for International Futures ==

The  project received a gift from [[Frederick S. Pardee]], formerly of [[RAND]], to construct the '''Pardee Center for International Futures''' at the [[University of Denver]].&lt;ref&gt;at {{cite web |url=http://www.ifs.du.edu/pardee/index.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902033255/http://www.ifs.du.edu/pardee/index.aspx |archivedate=2012-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is responsible for the further institutionalization of the software, training sessions, and the continued work on the ''Patterns of Potential Human Progress'' (PPHP) volumes.  The first PPHP volume discusses reduction in global poverty; the second, global education; the third, health care systems; the fourth, global infrastructure; the fifth, domestic governance.&lt;ref&gt;These can be downloaded either in final or draft form on their website "http://www.ifs.du.edu/documents/index.aspx"&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal [[Poverty and Public Policy]] reviewed the first PPHP volume, and concluded the following:

:For all their fine effort in data assembly and analysis, Hughes et al. intended that their first volume’s main contribution should be one not of prediction, but of promoting thought about poverty policy. Their attractively presented and lucid volume succeeds in this endeavor; it very usefully fulfills its promise to the student and policymaker.&lt;ref&gt;Soltys, Dennis (2010) “Review of Reducing Global Poverty: Patterns of Potential Human Progress, Vol. 1," Poverty &amp; Public Policy: Vol. 2: Iss. 2, Article 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== African Futures Project ==

The African Futures Project is a collaboration between the [[Institute for Security Studies]] and the Pardee Center for International Futures to promote long term strategic planning for African development.  This collaboration has led to the publication of various African Futures Project Policy Briefs,&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.issafrica.org/futures/publications.php Publications Section] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006215455/http://www.issafrica.org/futures/publications.php |date=2013-10-06 }} of the African Futures website for introductory videos and to read the policy briefs in full.&lt;/ref&gt; monographs on long-term African Development and a website where the IFs model can be used specifically for exploring African development.&lt;ref&gt;See the African Futures Project at: {{cite web |url=http://www.iss.co.za/futures/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403153619/http://www.iss.co.za/futures/ |archivedate=2013-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle of '''Irreducibility''', in [[philosophy]], has the sense that a complete account of an [[entity]] will not be possible at lower levels of [[explanation]] and which has novel properties beyond prediction and explanation. Another way to state this is that [[Occam's razor]] requires the elimination of only those entities that are unnecessary, not as many entities as could conceivably be eliminated. [[Lev Vygotsky]] provides the following illustration of the idea, in his ''Thought and Language'':

:"Two essentially different modes of analysis are possible in the study of [[psychology|psychological]] structures. It seems to us that one of them is responsible for all the failures that have beset former investigators of the old problem, which we are about to tackle in our turn, and that the other is the only correct way to approach it.

:The first method analyzes complex psychological wholes into "[[wiktionary:element|elements]]". It may be compared to the [[chemical analysis]] of water into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]], neither of which possesses the properties of the whole and each of which possesses properties not present in the whole. The student applying this method in looking for an explanation of some property of water &amp;mdash; why it extinguishes fire, for example &amp;mdash; will find to his surprise that hydrogen burns and oxygen sustains fire ....

:In our opinion the right course to follow is to use the other type of analysis, which may be called "analysis into units". By "unit", we mean a product of analysis which, unlike elements, retains all the basic properties of the whole, and which cannot be further divided without losing them. Not the chemical composition of water, but its molecules and their behaviour, are the key to the understanding of the properties of water ..."

In other words: to conserve the properties under investigation, it is necessary to remain within a certain level of complexity. Irreducibility is most often deployed in defence of the reality of human [[subjectivity]] and/or [[free will]], against those who treat such things as [[folk psychology]], such as [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]].

In “Life's Irreducible Structure”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/scientists/polanyi/Polanyi_Life_Structures.pdf|title=Life's Irreducible Structure|last=Polanyi|first=Michael|date=1968|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Michael Polanyi|Micheal Polanyi]] argues that higher-order sciences such as biology and other chemical processes can not be explained by the fundamentalist perspective.  Indeed, machines and the humans that make them fall into "boundary conditions" that produce phenomena that itself can not be reduced further. He writes &lt;blockquote&gt;The lowest level is the production of a voice; the second, the utterance of words; the third, the joining of words that make sentences; the fourth, the working of sentences into a style; the fifth, and the highest, the composition of the text. The principles of each level operate under the control of the next-higher level. The voice you produce is shaped into words by a vocabulary; a given vocabulary is shaped into sentences in accordance with a grammar; and the sentences are fitted into a style, which in turn is made to convey the ideas of the composition. Thus each level is subject to dual control: (i) control in accordance with the laws that apply to its elements in themselves, and (ii) control in accordance with the laws of the powers that control the comprehensive entity formed by these elements&lt;/blockquote&gt;It is worth noting that Reductionism has not been ruled out as an explanation of these tipping-point, emergent behaviors.

'''LGBT rights organizations''' are [[civil rights organization|civil rights]], [[healthcare and the LGBT community|health]], and [[community organization]]s created and existing to further the [[civil rights|civil]] and [[human rights]] and [[public health|health]] of [[sexual minorities]] and to improve the [[LGBT community]].

LGBT organizations may range from more moderate, liberal, organizations such as [[Stonewall (UK)]], to more outspoken organizations such as [[OutRage!]] in the U.K. and [[Bash Back!]] in the U.S., to the conservative, [[Log Cabin Republicans]], in the U.S..

==History of LGBT Rights Organizations==

{{Empty section|date=April 2017}}

==Early history==
The first LGBT rights organizations began to emerge in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Early LGBT rights organizations were primarily research-oriented psychiatric organizations that took a sympathetic, rather than corrective approach to homosexuality. such as the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]] (Wissenschaftlich-humanitäres Komitee, WhK), which was founded in 1897 by [[Magnus Hirschfeld]], an outspoken advocate for LGBT and women's rights in Germany.&lt;ref name="morris-article"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morris|first1=Bonnie|title=History of Lesbian, Gay, &amp; Bisexual Social Movements|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/history.aspx|website=American Psychological Association|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twentieth century==
===Early 20th Century===
Early LGBT organizations in the [[United States]] were, like earlier German organizations, primarily centered around the rights of gay men. [[The Society for Human Rights]] was founded in 1924 in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] by Henry Gerber, who was inspired by Hirschfeld's work in Germany and produced the first gay-rights-oriented publication in the US, ''[[Friendship and Freedom]]''.  The first national gay rights organization, the [[Mattachine Society]], was formed in 1951,&lt;ref name="amerigan-orgs-timeline"&gt;{{cite web|title=The American Gay Rights Movement|url=https://www.infoplease.com/us/gender-issues/american-gay-rights-movement-timeline|website=infoplease|publisher=Sandbox Networks, Inc.|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created by [[Harry Hay]].

The first lesbian rights organization in the US was founded in 1955. The [[Daughters of Bilitis]] was founded in [[San Francisco]], [[California]] by activist couple [[Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon]].&lt;ref name="amerigan-orgs-timeline" /&gt; In 1966, National Transsexual Counseling Unit was formed in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1966 The National Transgender Counseling Unit...|url=https://www.sutori.com/item/1966-the-national-transsexual-counseling-unit-the-worlds-first-transgender-orga|website=LGBTQ Timeline in the US|publisher=Sutori|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Stonewall===
In the wake of the [[Stonewall riots]], LGBT organizations began to flourish around the United States, including politically active organizations. The [[Alice B. Toklas LGBT Democratic Club]] was founded in 1971 by Martin &amp; Lyon, as well as activists Beth Elliot and Ben Foster. In 1976, [[Harvey Milk]] founded a splinter organization known as the [[Harvey Milk Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Democratic Club|San Francisco Gay Democratic Club]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10394">In philosophical discourse, '''lexis''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]]: λέξις "word") is a complete group of words in a language, vocabulary, the total set of all words in a language, and all words that have meaning or a function in grammar.

== Lexis according to Plato ==

According to [[Plato]], lexis is the manner of speaking. Plato said that lexis can be divided into [[mimesis]] (imitation properly speaking) and [[diegesis]] (simple narrative). Gerard Genette states: "Plato's theoretical division, opposing the two pure and heterogeneous modes of narrative and imitation, within poetic diction, elicits and establishes a practical classification of genres, which includes the two distinct modes...and a mixed mode, for example the Iliad".&lt;ref&gt;"Boundaries of a Narrative," ''New Literary History'', Vol. 8, No. 1, Readers and Spectators: Some Views and Reviews (Autumn, 1976), pp. 1–13. JSTOR. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the ''[[Iliad]]'', a Greek epic written by Homer, the mixed mode is very prevalent. According to [[Gerald Prince]], diegesis in the ''Iliad'' is the fictional storytelling associated with the fictional world and the enacting/re-telling of the story. Mimesis in the'' Iliad'' is the imitation of everyday, yet fantastical life in the ancient Greek world. Diegesis and mimesis combined represent the fullest extent of lexis; both forms of speech, narrating and re-enacting.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Prince. ''A Dictionary of Narratolog''y. 2003. University of Nebraska Press&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In conclusion, lexis is the larger overview of literature. Within lexis the two areas of differentiation of mimesis (imitation) are diegesis (narrative) and the "direct representation of the actors speaking to the public."&lt;ref&gt;Gennette 2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lexis according to Aristotle ==

According to Jose M. Gonzalez, "Aristotle instructs us to view of his psychology, as mediating the rhetorical task and entrusted with turning the orator's subject matter into such opinion of the listeners and gain their pistis."&lt;ref&gt;Jose M. Gonzalez, "Phantasia and Aristotle." JSTOR&lt;/ref&gt; Pistis is the Greek word for faith and is one of the rhetorical modes of persuasion.
 
Gonzalez also points out that, "By invoking phantasia, lexis against the background Aristotle instructs us to view of his psychology, as mediating the rhetorical task and entrusted with turning the orator's subject matter into such opinion of the listeners and gain their pistis." [[Phantasia (philosophy)|Phantasia]] is a Greek word meaning the process by which all images are presented to us. Aristotle defines phantasia as "our desire for the mind to mediate anything not actually present to the senses with a mental image." &lt;ref&gt;Jana Noel. "Interpreting Aristotle's Phantasia and Claiming its Role Within Phronesis". 1997.[http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/eps/PES-Yearbook/97_docs/noel.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle instructs the reader to use his or her imagination to create the fantastic, unordinary images, all the while using narrative and re-enactment to create a play either written or produced.

== Elements of rhetorical diction according to Aristotle ==

Although Aristotle at times seems to demean the art of diction or 'voice,' saying that it is not an "elevated subject of inquiry," he does go into quite a bit of detail on its importance and its proper use in rhetorical speech.  Often calling it "style," he defines good style as follows: that it must be clear and avoid extremes of baseness and loftiness.  Aristotle makes the cases for the importance of diction by saying that, "it is not enough to know what we ought to say; we must also say it as we ought.".&lt;ref&gt;''The Rhetoric and the Poetics of Aristotle''. Trans. W. Rhys Roberts. Ed.  [[Donald McQuade|Donald, McQuade]]. New York: The Modern Library, 1984, p. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; In an oratorical speech, one must consider not only the facts, but also how to put the facts into words and which words and, also, the "proper method of delivery." &lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle goes on to say that only the facts in an argument should be important but that since the listeners can be swayed by diction, it must also be considered.

At the time when Aristotle wrote his treatise on Rhetoric, orators had not paid much attention to voice.  They thought it was a subject only of concern to actors and poets. In ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|The Rhetoric]]'', Aristotles says, "proper method of delivery…affects the success of a speech greatly; but hitherto the subject has been neglected." &lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle defined voice as controlling one's voice, using rate, volume and pitch, to convey the appropriate emotions.  The manner of voice in which an idea or speech is conveyed affects not only the emotions of the audience but, also, their ability to understand this concept.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Although Aristotle gives this mention and explanation of voice, he does not go into specifics about how to produce appropriate voice or how to convey specific tones with one's voice.  This may or may not be due to his mild disdain for the topic as a whole. Modern scholars have explored voice more extensively. According to Taylor Stoehr, "voice is the pervasive reflection in written or spoken language, of an author's character, the marks by which we recognize his utterance as his.".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor Stoehr. "Tone and Voice."  ''College English'' Nov. 1968:  JSTOR. Pius XII Library, St. Louis, MO.  28 April 2008. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/374450]. p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;  However, just as in Aristotle's time set of specific rules or guidelines has yet been laid out for the production or interpretation of voice.  Due to the vast array of elements involved in the production of voice this task would be nearly, if not entirely, impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Stoehr 150&lt;/ref&gt;       

'''Language'''

As mentioned before, Aristotle thought the language of a speech should avoid being too lofty or too crude.  The speaker must use the ordinary language of everyday life.  However, because people best remember what is out of the ordinary, the speaker must use some language that gives the speech an air of importance.

The elevation of the language must correlate to the elevation of the subject or, in poetry, the character that is speaking.  In poetry, language and linguistic devices that convey a sense of importance are more appropriate, and should be used more often because the events of poetry are more removed from ordinary life.  They are less appropriate in rhetorical speech because the topics relate more directly to ordinary things and the people who are listening to the speech.  Most of all, the speaker must "give the impression of speaking naturally and not artificially." &lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; When one seems to speak with ease, the audience is more easily persuaded that the facts he is communicating are truthful. 

Also, a speaker must avoid using very many "strange words, compound words, and invented words.".&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle considered this kind of language an excessive departure from the way people normally speak.  However, one acceptable departure from plain language is the use of [[metaphor]] because metaphors are used by all people in everyday conversation.

== Two forms of lexis ==

According to Aristotle, lexis, meaning the delivery of words, is the least important area of speech when in comparison to invention, arrangement and style.  However, lexis is still closely looked at and broken down into two forms.  The two types of lexis in rhetoric include: ''lexis graphike'' and ''lexis agonistike'' &lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Sonkowsky, ”An Aspect of Delivery in Ancient Rhetorical Theory.” p. 259 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/view/283710?seq=4&amp;Search=yes&amp;term=agonistike&amp;term=graphike&amp;term=lexis&amp;list=hide&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dlexis%2Bgraphike%2Band%2Blexis%2Bagonistike%26dc%3DAll%2BDisciplines&amp;item=1&amp;ttl=1&amp;returnArticleService=showArticle&amp;cookieSet=1]&lt;/ref&gt; The separate terms that describe the two forms of lexis, graphike and agonistike, have been conformed by several Latin terms.  Although the words directly relate to the type of lexis, the theories of Aristotle and Plato do not compare.

''Lexis graphike'' comes from the term ''zographia'', meaning realistic painting, and graphe, meaning writing. Plato believes that writing and painting are one of the same.   His theory proves that both do not have the capability to defend themselves through an argument, question and answer, which conveys that these forms can not prove truth. Although for Aristotle, ''lexis graphik''e is the most accurate delivery of language, which leads to his theory that proves that writing does not need to be questioned because it is already exact.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, 264&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Lexis agonistike'' however is from the term ''skiagraphia'', meaning a rough sketch or outline of painting.  Aristotle once again opposes Plato by believing that ''lexis agonistike'' does not need questions asked, but only answers.  The answer refers to the use of invention given to the actor because the writing portion is only outlined.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, 265&lt;/ref&gt;

To further understand the separate types of lexis, each type can be broken down by how the writing is prepared and delivered.  ''Lexis graphike'' is the most precise style of rhetoric and strongly appeals to intelligence.  The delivery of ''lexis graphike'' is designed for a careful reading from either the book or paper as opposed to a performance that leaves room for improvisation.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; This type of lexis is a simple, straight forward recitation rather than an elaborate presentation.  ''Lexis graphike'' is most accurately written and depends the least upon the person who is delivering the speech.  ''Lexis agonistike'' contradicts ''lexis graphike'' because it is typically carelessly written and meant for a full performance.  The lack of attention given to the written words allows the performer to improvise. This gives the presentation a style that reflects the entertainer rather the writer.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Loss of rights due to criminal conviction''' refers to the practice in some countries of reducing the rights of individuals who have been convicted of a criminal offence.  The restrictions are in addition to other penalties such as incarceration or fines.  In addition to restrictions imposed directly upon conviction, there can also be [[Collateral consequences of criminal conviction|collateral civil consequences]] resulting from a criminal conviction, but which are not imposed directly by the courts as a result of the conviction.

==Canada==

In Canada, criminal law is a federal matter, set out in the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]].  Restrictions can be placed on certain activities following a conviction involving: (1) the use of weapons in the commission of a criminal offence;  (2) driving a vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drugs; (3) electoral corruption.

===Weapon prohibitions===
When a person is convicted of an offence in which the person used a weapon, or threatened to use a weapon, the sentencing court has the power to prohibit the person from possessing a weapon for a certain period of time.  In the case of certain offences, the prohibition on possession is mandatory.&lt;ref name = "CC109"&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-109.html ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 109.]&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, the court has discretion whether to impose a prohibition on possession.&lt;ref name = "CC110"&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-110.html ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 110.]&lt;/ref&gt;

For first offences, the court can set the prohibition period as any time up to ten years.&lt;ref name = "CC109"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "CC110"/&gt;  For subsequent offences, the convicted person is prohibited from possessing a weapon for life.&lt;ref name = "CC109"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "CC110"/&gt;  However, even for first offences, the court  can impose a lifetime prohibition if the convicted person used a weapon against the convicted person's intimate partner, the convicted person's children, or any person living with the convicted person.&lt;ref name = "CC110"/&gt;  As well, there is a lifetime prohibition on possessing [[Gun laws in Canada#Classification of firearms|prohibited firearms or weapons]] (such as fully automatic firearms), and [[Gun laws in Canada#Classification of firearms|restricted firearms]] (such as handguns).&lt;ref name = "CC109"/&gt;

===Driving prohibitions===
The ''Criminal Code'' contains several offences related to driving a motor vehicle, including driving while impaired or with a blood alcohol count greater than eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood (".08"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-253.html#docCont ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 253.]&lt;/ref&gt; impaired or .08 driving causing bodily harm or death,&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-255.html#docCont ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 255.]&lt;/ref&gt; dangerous driving (including dangerous driving causing bodily harm or death),&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-249.html ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 249.]&lt;/ref&gt; and street racing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-249.2.html ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c c-46, s 249.2]&lt;/ref&gt;  A person convicted of one of these offences can be subject to a prohibition on driving a motor vehicle for a certain period of time.

For convictions for impaired driving or driving over .08, the court must impose a mandatory driving prohibition of at least one year and not more than three years for a first offence.  The length of the mandatory driving prohibitions increase with second and subsequent offences.  If the convicted person participates in an interlock program, the length of the prohibition may be reduced, but must be at least three months.  Similar mandatory prohibition orders are imposed for offences involving a motor vehicle which cause bodily harm or death and for street racing.&lt;ref name = "CC259"&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-60.html#docCont ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 259.]&lt;/ref&gt;

For offences other than impaired driving/.08 or street racing, or not involving bodily harm or death, the sentencing court has discretion to impose driving prohibitions.&lt;ref name = "CC259"/&gt;

In addition to the driving prohibitions under the ''Criminal Code'', there may be [[Collateral consequences of criminal conviction|collateral civil consequences]].  For example, driver licences are issued under provincial law.  All provinces will cancel the driver licence of a person convicted of certain driving offences under the ''Criminal Code''.

===Electoral corruption===
 
The ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' guarantees that all Canadian citizens have the [[Section 3 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|right to vote in federal and provincial elections]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-15.html ''Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'', s 3.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Supreme Court of Canada has held that even if a Canadian citizen has committed a criminal offence and is incarcerated, they retain the constitutional right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2010/index.do ''Sauvé v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer)'', [2002&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 3 SCR 519, 2002 SCC 68.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 2015 federal election, more than 22,000 inmates in federal correctional institutes were eligible to vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-election-2015-prisoners-voting-1.3202010 CBC News, August 25, 2015:  "More than 22,000 federal inmates eligible to vote."]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
There is one exception to this general principle.  The Supreme Court has held that if a person is convicted of corrupt electoral practices, they can be evicted from the legislature, barred from being nominated for election for a set period, and denied the right to vote for a set period.  These restrictions are acceptable because they are a sanction aimed at the very offence committed by the individual, rather than being a general disenfranchisement.  The restrictions are aimed at healing the corrupted electoral process, which itself is a constitutional value, and therefore can be justified for limited periods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1413/index.do ''Harvey v. New Brunswick (Attorney General)'', [1996&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 2 SCR 876.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==

Within the United Kingdom, criminal law is primarily a matter of the [[Countries of the UK|four constituent countries]].  After a conviction, an offender can, in some cases, lose:
*the ability to keep or obtain a [[UK driving licence|licence to drive a motor vehicle]] (particularly after a conviction for causing death by [[Death by dangerous driving|dangerous]] or [[impaired driving]])
*the ability to work with children (particularly after a conviction that requires the offender to [[Sex offender registry#United Kingdom|register as a sex offender]])
*the ability (if a non-citizen) to live in the United Kingdom (even if, before being convicted, he or she had the ability to vote in general elections under [[indefinite leave to remain]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-9-grounds-for-refusal Immigration Rules Part 9:  Grounds for Refusal.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*while imprisoned, [[Felony disenfranchisement#United Kingdom|the right to vote]].

==United States==

In the United States, loss of rights due to criminal conviction can take several forms, including  [[felony disenfranchisement in the United States|voting disenfranchisement]], exclusion from [[jury duty]], and loss of the [[Right to keep and bear arms#United States|right to possess firearms]]

===Disenfranchisement===
{{main|Felony disenfranchisement}}

Every state with the exception of [[Maine]] and [[Vermont]] prohibits felons from voting while in prison.&lt;ref name="SP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Felony Disenfranchisement Laws in the United States|publisher=The Sentencing Project|date=September 2008|url=http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/fd_bs_fdlawsinusMarch2010.pdf|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nine other states disenfranchise felons for various lengths of time following the completion of their probation or parole. However, the severity of each state's disenfranchisement varies. 1 in 43 adults were disenfranchised as of 2006.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Disenfranchisement of Ex-Felons|last = Hull|first = Elizabeth|publisher = Temple University Press|year = 2009|isbn = 1439904413|location = |page = 83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of disenfranchisement gained awareness in 2000 after the "excruciatingly close" [[United States presidential election, 2000|presidential election]], wherein 2% of the voting-age population was prohibited from participating.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In that election, George W. Bush won Florida by 537 votes, however 31% of black Floridians were denied the vote due to disenfranchisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Florida's legacy of voter disenfranchisement - World Socialist Web Site|url = https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2001/04/flor-a09.html|website = www.wsws.org|accessdate = 2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that African American voters are typically Democratic voters, it was argued at the time that their exclusion "decisively" changed the outcome of the election.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In ''Reynolds v. Sims'', the Court ruled that the right to vote is a "fundamental right," establishing a strict scrutiny test. Further, the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees "equal protection of the laws" to all persons. However, Section 2 of this Amendment allows states to remove voting privileges from anyone who has participated in "rebellion or other crime."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A 1972 Supreme Court ruling found that this article applied to disenfranchisement of ex-felons. The Civic Participation and Rehabilitation Act, allowing for ex-felons to vote, has been introduced at the beginning of every legislative session since 1994, but has never made it to the floor of Congress.

Two states, [[Kentucky]] and [[Florida]] (Gov. [[Rick Scott]] reverted to the old policy in 2010 that had been changed by Gov. [[Charlie Crist]]), continue to impose a lifelong denial of the right to vote to all citizens with a felony record, in the absence of a restoration of civil rights by the [[Governor]] or, where allowed, [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]].&lt;ref name="SP"/&gt;  Florida law is somewhat unusual, in that the individual must be pardoned by the Governor and a majority of the publicly elected State Cabinet (with the Governor's vote being the tiebreaker, if necessary).

===Felon jury exclusion===
The lifetime exclusion of felons from jury service is the majority rule in the United States, used in 31 states and in federal courts. The result is that over 6% of the adult population is excluded, including about 30% of black men.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Exclusion of Felons from Jury Service|ssrn=420840|author=Kalt, Brian C.|publisher=American University Law Review|volume=53|date=October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Felon jury exclusion is less visible than felony disenfranchisement, and few socio-legal scholars have challenged the statutes that withhold a convicted felon's opportunity to sit on a jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A jury of none: an essay on the last acceptable form of civic banishment|publisher=Dialectical Anthropology|issn=0304-4092|date=March 20, 2010|author=Binnall, James Michael|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/t2532u57l15h134p/}}&lt;/ref&gt; While constitutional challenges to felon jury exclusion almost always originate from interested litigants, some scholars contend that "it is the interests of the excluded felons that are most directly implicated."

Yet attacks on these blanket prohibitions levied by excluded felon jurors have failed consistently. The [[United States Supreme Court]] does not recognize the right to sit on a jury as fundamental.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=17+Va.+J.+Soc.+Pol%27y+%26+L.+1&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=9f8b750e1dfdc27bb7a0a2dcadfab296|title=Sixteen Million Angry Men|author=Binnall James M.|publisher=Virginia Journal of Social Policy &amp; the Law|date=Fall 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been pointed out that, although lawmakers assert that felon jury exclusion measures protect the integrity of the adjudicative process, as felons "lack the requisite probity" to serve on a jury and are "inherently biased," many of the states subscribing to this practice allow felons to practice law.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/3/7/6/7/1/p376711_index.html|author=Binnall, James|title=The Lawyer and the Juror: Critically Examining the Rationales for Felon Jury Exclusion|date=May 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; But that is a double-standard only if it is presumed that those who judge the arguments of both sides in a case are allowed to be as biased as those arguing for each side.

===Loss of right to possess firearms===
Since 1968,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-82/pdf/STATUTE-82-Pg1213-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; felons are regarded by the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], and most US states, as being "prohibited persons" under US law ({{uscsub|18|922|g}}). It is a [[Classes of offenses under United States federal law|class C felony]] punishable by up to 10 years in prison under this subsection "to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce." This has been litigated before the Supreme Court. However, the Court upheld the regulation. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10909">[[Image:Leon Croizat-ru.jpg|thumb|200px|Léon Croizat (1964)]]
'''Leon Camille Marius Croizat''' (July 16, 1894 – November 30, 1982) was a [[France|French]]-[[Italy|Italian]] scholar and botanist who developed an [[orthogenesis|orthogenetic]] synthesis of evolution of biological form over space, in time, which he named [[Panbiogeography]].

==Life==
Croizat was born in [[Turin|Torino]], [[Italy]] to [[Vittorio Croizat]] (aka Victor Croizat) and Maria (Marie) Chaley, who had emigrated to Turin from Chambéry, France.&lt;ref name=Llor/&gt; In spite of his great aptitude for the natural sciences, Leon studied and received a degree in Law from the University of Turin.

Croizat and his family (wife Lucia and two children) emgirated to the United States in 1924; an avid artist, Leon worked selling his artwork for several years, but could not succeed economically as a working artist after the stock market crash of 1929. During the 1930s, Croizat found a job identifying plants as part of a topographic inventory performed in the public parks of New York City. During his visits to the Bronx Botanical Gardens, he became acquainted with Dr. E. D. Merrill. When Merrill was appointed director of the [[Arnold Arboretum]] of [[Harvard University]] in 1936, he hired Leon as a technical assistant (in 1937.)&lt;ref name=Llor/&gt;

Croizat became a prolific student and publisher, studying important aspects of the distribution and evolution of biological species. It was during this time that he began to formulate a novel current of thought in evolutionary theory, opposed in some respects to [[Darwinism]], on the evolution and dispersal of biota over space, through time.

[[Image:Croizat Orinoco.jpg|thumb|upright|Croizat during the 1950-1951 Franco-Venezuelan Expedition to the sources of the Orinoco River]]
In 1947, Croizat moved to [[Venezuela]] after receiving an invitation from botanist [[Henri François Pittier|Henri Pittier]]. Croizat then obtained a position in the Faculty of the Department of Agronomy at the [[Central University of Venezuela]]. In 1951 he was promoted and was awarded the title of Professor of Botany and Ecology at the [[University of the Andes, Venezuela]]. Between 1951 and 1952 he participated in the Franco-Venezuelan expedition to discover the sources of the [[Orinoco]] river. Croizat served with the expedition as a botanist with professor [[José Cruxent|Jose Maria Cruxent]].

During his time in Venezuela Croizat divorced his first wife. Croizat was later remarried to his second wife Catalina  Krishaber, a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] immigrant. In 1953 Croizat gave up all official academic positions to work full-time researching biology. Croizat and his wife Catalina lived in [[Caracas]] until 1976. In 1976 they took over as first directors of the [http://www.sciencebuff.org/research/current-research-activities/john-grehan/evolutionary-biography/jardin-botanico-xerofito/ “Jardin Botanico Xerofito”] in [[Santa Ana de Coro|Coro]], a city approximately 400 kilometers West of Caracas. Jardin Botanico Xerofito was a botanical garden which they founded together. Croizat and Catalina worked for six years to establish Jardin Botanico Xerofito.

Croizat died at Coro on November 30, 1982 of a heart attack. During his life, Croizat has published around 300 scientific papers and seven books, amounting to more than 15,000 printed pages. He was honoured by Venezuela with the Henri Pittier Order of Merit in Conservation, and by the government of Italy with the Order of Merit. Croizat is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of lizard, ''[[Mabuya|Mabuya croizati]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

[[Image:biogeographic tracks.jpg|thumb|upright|Panbiogeographic tracks of the [[ratite]] birds, the southern beech ''[[Nothofagus]]'', and the New Zealand frog ''[[Leiopelma]]'']]
[[Panbiogeography]] is a discipline based on the analysis of patterns of distribution of organisms. The method analyzes biogeographic distributions through the drawing of tracks, and derives information from the form and orientation of those tracks. A track is a line connecting collection localities or disjunct areas of a particular [[taxon]]. Several individual tracks for unrelated groups of organisms form a generalized ('standard') track, where the individual components are relict fragments of an ancestral, more widespread biota fragmented by geological and/or climatic changes. A node arises from the intersection of two or more generalized tracks &lt;ref name=Craw1999&gt;Craw RC, Grehan JR, Heads MJ (1999). ''Panbiogeography: Tracking the History of Life''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[graph theory]] a track is equated to a [[minimum spanning tree]] connecting all localities by the shortest path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Page RDM|year=1987|title=Graphs and generalized tracks: quantifying Croizat's panbiogeography|url=|journal=Systematic Zoology|volume=36|issue=|pages=1–17|doi=10.2307/2413304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To explain disjunct distributions, Croizat proposed the existence of broadly distributed ancestors that established its range during a period of mobilism, followed by a form-making process over a broad front. Disjunctions are explained as extinctions in the previously continuous range. [[Orthogenesis]] is a term used by Croizat, in his words "... in a pure mechanistic sense",&lt;ref&gt;Croizat L (1964). ''Space, Time, Form: The Biological Synthesis''. Caracas: Published by the author. p. 676.&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to the fact that a variation in form is limited and constrained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Colacino C|year=1997|title=Leon Croizat's biogeography and macroevolution, or ... 'out of nothing, nothing comes'|url=http://www.sciencebuff.org/ftp_only/colacino1997.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Philippine Scientist|volume=34|issue=|pages=73–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croizat considered organism evolution as a function of time, space and form. Of these three essential factors, space is the one with which biogeography is primarily concerned. However space necessarily interplays with time and form, therefore the three factors are as one of biogeographic concern. Put another way, when evolution is considered to be guided by developmental constraints or by phylogenetic constraints, it is orthogenetic.&lt;ref name="Gray1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gray|first1=Russell|title=Oppositions in panbiogeography: can the conflicts between selection,  constraint, ecology, and history be resolved?|journal=New Zealand Journal of Zoology|date=1989|volume=16|pages=787–806|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03014223.1989.10422935|doi=10.1080/03014223.1989.10422935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although authors belonging to the dispersalist{{clarify|date=April 2017}} establishment have dismissed Croizat's contributions, others have considered Croizat as one of the most original thinkers of modern comparative biology, whose contributions provided the foundation of a new synthesis between earth and life sciences. Panbiogeography became established as a productive research programme in historical biogeography &lt;ref name=Craw1999/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24603">'''Manic Pixie Dream Girl''' ('''MPDG''') is a [[stock character]] type in [[films]]. Film critic [[Nathan Rabin]], who coined the term after observing [[Kirsten Dunst]]'s character in ''[[Elizabethtown (film)|Elizabethtown]]'' (2005), said that the MPDG "exists solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive [[Screenwriter|writer]]-[[Film director|directors]] to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures."&lt;ref name="rabin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/my-year-of-flops-case-file-1-elizabethtown-the-bat,15577/ |title=My Year Of Flops, Case File 1: ''Elizabethtown'': The Bataan Death March of Whimsy |last=Rabin |first=Nathan |authorlink=Nathan Rabin |date=January 25, 2007 |website=[[The A.V. Club]] |accessdate=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; MPDGs are said to help their men without pursuing their own happiness, and such characters never grow up; thus, their men never grow up.&lt;ref name="welker"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Welker |first=Holly |date=February 12, 2010 |title=Forever Your Girl |journal=[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]] |issue=46 |pages=26–30 |url=https://bitchmedia.org/article/forever-your-girl |accessdate=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manic Pixie Dream Girl has been compared to another stock character, the [[Magical Negro]], a [[black people|black]] character who seems to exist only to provide spiritual or mystical help to the [[White savior narrative in film|white savior protagonist]]. In both cases, the stock character has no discernible inner life, and usually only exists to provide the protagonist some important life lessons.&lt;ref name="avclub"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bowman |first1=Donna |last2=Gillette |first2=Amelie |last3=Hyden |first3=Steven |last4=Murray |first4=Noel |last5=Pierce |first5=Leonard |last6=Rabin |first6=Nathan |date=August 4, 2008 |title=Wild things: 16 films featuring Manic Pixie Dream Girls |website=[[The A.V.

==Examples==
MPDGs are usually [[static characters]] who have [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] personality quirks and are unabashedly girlish. They invariably serve as the [[romantic interest]] for a (most often brooding or depressed) male [[protagonist]]. Examples of an MPDG are described below:
*An example is [[Natalie Portman]]'s character in the movie ''[[Garden State (film)|Garden State]]'' (2004), written and directed by [[Zach Braff]].&lt;ref name="rabin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="welker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/2008/08/07/manic_pixie/ |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111008063922/http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/2008/08/07/manic_pixie/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 8, 2011 |title=The Natalie Portman problem |last=Berman |first=Judy |date=August 7, 2008 |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |accessdate=January 5, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of ''Garden State'', [[Roger Ebert]] also described this kind of rather unbelievable "movie creature" as "completely available" and "absolutely desirable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Garden State |first=Roger |last=Ebert |authorlink=Roger Ebert |website=Rogerebert.com |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/garden-state-2004 |date=August 6, 2004 |accessdate=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' points to [[Katharine Hepburn]]'s character in ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' (1938) as one of the earliest examples of the archetype.&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; 
*The'' [[Filmspotting]]'' podcast created a list of Top Five Manic Pixie Dream Girls; Nathan Rabin appeared as a guest and created his own, separate list of MPDGs.&lt;ref name="filmspotting"/&gt;

===Counterexamples===
*The titular character of ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1977) is often called a MPDG but is arguably not one, as she has her own goals independent of the male lead.{{r|kelly20130109}}
*[[Kate Winslet]]'s character Clementine in ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'' (2004) acknowledges the trope of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl and rejects the type, in a remark to [[Jim Carrey]]'s Joel: "Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive. But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's lookin' for my own peace of mind; don't assign me yours.”&lt;ref name="filmspotting"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmspotting.net/reviews/624-fs-326-127-hours-top-5-manic-pixie-dream-girls.html |title=Top Five Manic Pixie Dream Girls |website=Filmspotting |date=November 19, 2010 |accessdate=June 26, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617034840/http://www.filmspotting.net/reviews/624-fs-326-127-hours-top-5-manic-pixie-dream-girls.html |archivedate=June 17, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Although [[Zooey Deschanel]]'s Summer in ''[[500 Days of Summer]]'' (2009) is often identified as a MPDG, the movie can be seen as a deconstruction of the trope because it shows the dangers of idealising women as things, rather than respecting them as real people with their own complex outlooks. Director [[Marc Webb]] stated, "Yes, Summer has elements of the manic pixie dream girl&amp;nbsp;– she is an immature view of a woman. She's Tom's view of a woman. He doesn't see her complexity and the consequence for him is heartbreak. In Tom's eyes, Summer is perfection, but perfection has no depth.

*Eve, the lead character of [[Stuart Murdoch (musician)|Stuart Murdoch]]'s [[musical film]], ''[[God Help the Girl (film)|God Help the Girl]]'' (2014), has also been noted as a subversion of the trope, with actress [[Emily Browning]] approaching the character as "the anti-manic pixie dream girl" and describing her as having "her own inner life" and being "incredibly self-absorbed; [...] Olly wants her to be his muse and she's like, 'No, I'm not having that.

==Criticism and debate==
In an interview with Vulture, the entertainment section of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', about her film ''[[Ruby Sparks]]'', actress and screenwriter [[Zoe Kazan]] criticized the term as reductive, [[diminutive]], and [[misogynistic]]. She disagreed that Hepburn's character in ''Bringing Up Baby'' is a MPDG: "I think that to lump together all individual, original quirky women under that rubric is to erase all difference."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/07/zoe-kazan-ruby-sparks-interview.html |title=Zoe Kazan on Writing ''Ruby Sparks'' and Why You Should Never Call Her a 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' |first=Patti |last=Greco |publisher=Vulture |date=July 23, 2012 |accessdate=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a December 2012 video, [[AllMovie]] critic Cammila Collar embraced the term as an effective description of one-dimensional female characters who only seek the happiness of the male protagonist, and who do not deal with any complex issues of their own. The pejorative use of the term, then, is mainly directed at writers who do not give these female characters more to do than bolster the spirits of their male partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMsrwfbyxMo |title=Semantic Breakdown: The Manic Pixie Dream Bitch |work=[[YouTube]] |date=December 14, 2012 |accessdate=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''{{'}}s Aisha Harris posited that "critiques of the MPDG may have become more common than the archetype itself", suggesting that filmmakers had been forced to become "self-aware about such characters" in the years since Rabin's coining of the phrase and that the trope had largely disappeared from film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Harris |first=Aisha |title=Is the Manic Pixie Dream Girl Dead? |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/12/05/manic_pixie_prostitute_video_is_the_latest_critique_of_the_manic_pixie_dream.html |website=Slate |publisher=The Slate Group |date=December 5, 2012 |accessdate=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, Kat Stoeffel, for ''[[New York (magazine)|The Cut]]'', argued that the term itself had become sexist, citing her opinion that "it was levied, criminally at [[Diane Keaton]] in ''[[Annie Hall]]'' and [[Zooey Deschanel]], the actual person. ''How could a real person's defining trait be a lack of interior life?"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stoeffel |first=Kat |title=The 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' Has Died |url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2013/07/manic-pixie-dream-girl-has-died.html |website=The Cut |publisher=New York Media LLC. |accessdate=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

Similar sentiments were elucidated by Monika Bartyzel for ''[[The Week]]'' in April 2013, who wrote "this once-useful piece of critical shorthand has devolved into laziness and sexism". Bartyzel argues that "[The term] 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' was useful when it commented on the superficiality of female characterizations in male dominated journeys, but it has since devolved into a pejorative way to deride unique women in fiction and reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bartyzel |first=Monika |title=Girls on Film: Why it's time to retire the term 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' |url=http://theweek.com/article/index/243265/girls-on-film-why-its-time-to-retire-the-term-manic-pixie-dream-girl |website=The Week |publisher=The Week Publications, Inc. |date=April 26, 2013 |accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retraction of the term==
In July 2014, for ''Salon'', Rabin prompted a retraction of the term "Manic Pixie Dream Girl". He argued that in "giving an idea a fuzzy definition", he inadvertently gave the phrase power it was not intended to have. The trope's popularity, Rabin suggested, led to discussions of a more precise definition, a reduction of the critic's all-encompassing classification of MPDG. While he coined the term to expose the sexist implications in modern culture, the "phrase was increasingly accused of being sexist itself". Backlash occurred when many well-loved female characters were placed under this trope. In response, Rabin suggested that nuanced characters cannot be classified in such a restricted nature, and thus he apologized to pop culture for "creating this unstoppable monster".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2014/07/15/im_sorry_for_coining_the_phrase_manic_pixie_dream_girl/ |date=July 15, 2014 |title=I'm sorry for coining the phrase "Manic Pixie Dream Girl": In 2007, I invented the term in a review. Then I watched in queasy disbelief as it seemed to take over pop culture |first=Nathan |last=Rabin |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |accessdate=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manic Pixie Dream Boy==
Recently there has been discussion of a male version of this trope, the Manic Pixie Dream Boy or Manic Pixie Dream Guy. Augustus Waters from the film version of ''[[The Fault in Our Stars (film)|The Fault in Our Stars]]'' (2014) was given this title in a 2014 [[Vulture.com|''Vulture'']] article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Patches |first=Matt |title=He's Perfect, He's Awful: The Case Against The Fault in Our Stars' Gus Waters |url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/06/case-against-fault-in-our-stars-gus-waters-manic-pixie-dream-guy.html |website=Vulture |publisher=''New York Magazine''|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Matt Patches stated, "he's a bad boy, he's a sweetheart, he's a dumb jock, he's a nerd, he's a philosopher, he's a poet, he's a victim, he's a survivor, he's everything everyone wants in their lives, and he's a fallacious notion of what we can ''actually'' have in our lives."

The Manic Pixie Dream Boy trope has also been pointed out in sitcoms such as ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'' and ''[[30 Rock]]''. The female protagonists of these shows are married to men ([[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]]'s [[Ben Wyatt (Parks and Recreation)|Ben Wyatt]] and [[James Marsden]]'s Criss Chros, respectively), who, according to a 2012 ''[[Grantland]]'' article, "patiently [tamp] down her stubbornness and temper while appreciating her quirks, helping her to become her best possible self".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lambert |first=Molly |title=1D Internet Fantasies: Liz Lemon, One Direction, and the Rise of the Manic Pixie Dream Guy |url=http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/1d-internet-fantasies-liz-lemon-one-direction-and-the-rise-of-the-manic-pixie-dream-guy/ |publisher=Grantland |accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character Jesse, played by [[Skylar Astin]], in the film ''[[Pitch Perfect]]'' (2012) embodies the Manic Pixie Dream Boy trope. His role in the film appears to be to coax the very serious character Beca, played by [[Anna Kendrick]], out of her gloom and embrace life to the fullest. He has no backstory of his own, and no major goals of his own in the context of the film. According to an article on Ohio State's Entertainment News site.

{{Quote|Jesse, the male protagonist, never fails to break my heart. His character is seemingly flawless: he is sweet, charming, funny, boyishly handsome, and talented, but in a self-deprecating way. The character radiates youthful appeal in a way that makes me want to sit close to him and watch John Hughes movies with him. He takes on the selfless task of cracking open the stony girl protagonist by showing her ''The Breakfast Club'' and becomes a victim—Jesse is unusual. Jesse is a background story-less charisma machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://osu.uloop.com/news/view.php/60295/Boys-and-Girls-in-Current-Film-A-Glimps/ |title=Boys and Girls in Current Film: A Glimpse into 'Manic Pixies' |first=Lacey |last=Ross |date=December 25, 2012 |publisher=[[Uloop]] |accessdate=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Algorithm-defined fantasy girl===

Another version of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl is the algorithm-defined fantasy girl. The difference is that the latter is not human, but a robot or artificial intelligence of some sort. The function is the same one: to fulfill the desires of the male character and to help him in his journey without having any desires or journey of her own. Some examples are: Joi in ''[[Blade Runner 2049]]'' and Samantha in [[Spike Jonze]]'s ''[[Her (film)|Her]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/11/16455282/blade-runner-2049-analysis-ana-de-armas-fantasy-girl|title=Blade Runner 2049 continues questionable trend of the ‘algorithm-defined fantasy girl’|first=Julia|last=Alexander|date=11 October 2017|website=Polygon|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/15/ex-machina-sexy-female-robots-scifi-film-obsession&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Equity (law)}}
'''Maxims of equity''' are [[legal maxim]]s that serve as a set of general [[principles of law|principles]] or rules which are said to govern the way in which [[Equity (law)|equity]] operates. They tend to illustrate the qualities of [[Equity (law)|equity]], in contrast to the [[common law]], as a more flexible, responsive approach to the needs of the individual, inclined to take into account the [[Party (law)|parties’]] conduct and worthiness. They were developed by the English [[Court of Chancery]] and other courts that administer [[Equity (law)|equity]] jurisdiction, including the [[English trusts law|law of trusts]]. Although the most fundamental and time honored of the maxims, listed on this page, are often referred to on their own as the 'maxims of equity' or 'the equitable maxims', it cannot be said that there is a definitive list of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Trusts and Equity|first1=Richard|last1= Edwards|first2= Nigel|last2= Stockwell|year= 2005|publisher=Pearson Education|edition=7|pages=34|isbn=1-4058-1227-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk/assets/hip/gb/uploads/M02_EDWA3458_10_SE_C02.pdf. - The maxims of equity&lt;/ref&gt; Like other kinds of [[legal maxim]]s or [[principles of law|principles]], they were originally, and sometimes still are, expressed in Latin.

==Role of maxims==
Maxims of equity are not a rigid set of rules, but are, rather, general principles which can be deviated from in specific cases.&lt;ref&gt;See J Martin, ''Hanbury and Martin's Modern Equity'' (19th edn Sweet and Maxwell 2012) 1-024&lt;/ref&gt; Snell's ''Equity'', an English treatise, takes the view that the "Maxims do not cover the whole ground, and moreover they overlap, one maxim contains by implication what belongs to another. Indeed it would not be difficult to reduce all under two: '[[#Equity will not suffer a wrong to be without a remedy|Equity will not suffer a wrong to be without a remedy]]' and '[[#Equity acts in personam   or persons|Equity acts on the person]]'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Snell's Principles of Equity|edition  =  25 |last1=Snell|first1=Edmund Henry Turner|last2= Megarry|first2=R.E.|last3=Baker|first3= P.V. |year= 1960|publisher= Sweet &amp; Maxwell|location= London|ol=21567635M |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of maxims==
===Equity sees that as done what ought to be done===
Sometimes phrased as "equity regards as done what should have been done", this maxim means that when individuals are required, by their agreements or by law, to perform some act of legal significance, equity will regard that act as having been done as it ought to have been done, even before it has actually happened. This makes possible the legal phenomenon of [[equitable conversion]].

The consequences of this maxim, and of equitable conversion, are significant in their bearing on the [[risk of loss]] in transactions. When parties enter a contract for a sale of [[Realty|real property]], the buyer is deemed to have obtained an equitable right that becomes a legal right only after the deal is completed.

Due to his [[equitable interest]] in the outcome of the transaction, the buyer who suffers a breach may be entitled to the [[equitable remedy]] of [[specific performance]] (although not always, see below).  If he is successful in seeking a remedy at law, he is entitled to the value of the property at the time of breach regardless of whether it has appreciated or depreciated.

The fact that the buyer may be forced to suffer a depreciation in the value of the property means that he bears the risk of loss if, for example, the improvements on the property he bought burn down while he is still in [[escrow]].

Problems may sometimes arise because, through some lapse or omission, insurance coverage is not in force at the time a claim is made. If the policyholder has clearly been at fault in this connection, because, for example, he has not paid premiums when he should have, then it will normally be quite reasonable for an insurer to decline to meet the claim. However, it gets more difficult if the policyholder is no more at fault than the insurer. The fair solution in the circumstances may be arrived at by applying the principle that equity regards that as done that ought to be done. In other words, what would the position have been if what should have been done had been done?

Thus, we know in one case, premiums on a [[life insurance]] policy were overdue. The insurer's letter to the policyholder warning him of this fact was never received by the policyholder, who died shortly after the policy consequently lapsed. It was clear that if the notice had been received by the policyholder, he or his wife would have taken steps to ensure the policy continued in force, because the policyholder was terminally ill at the time and the coverage provided by the policy was something his wife was plainly going to require in the foreseeable future. Since the policyholder would have been fully entitled to pay the outstanding premium at that stage, regardless of his physical condition, the insurer (with some persuasion from the Bureau) agreed that the matter should be dealt with as if the policyholder had done so. In other words, his widow was entitled to the sum assured less the outstanding premium. In other similar cases, however, it has not been possible to follow the same principle because there has not been sufficiently clear evidence that the policy would have been renewed.

Another illustration of the application of this equitable principle was in connection with [[motor vehicle insurance]]. A policyholder was provided with coverage on the basis that she was entitled to a "no claims" discount from her previous insurer. Confirmation to this effect from the previous insurer was required. When that was not forthcoming, her coverage was cancelled by the brokers who had issued the initial coverage note. This was done without reference to the insurer concerned whose normal practice in such circumstances would have been to maintain coverage and to require payment of the full premium until proof of the no claims discount was forthcoming. Such proof was eventually obtained by the policyholder, but only after she had been involved in an accident after the cancellation by the brokers of the policy. Here again, the fair outcome was to look at what would have happened if the insurer's normal practice had been followed. In such circumstances, the policyholder would plainly have still had a policy at the time of the accident. The insurer itself had not acted incorrectly at any stage. However, in the circumstances, it was equitable for it to meet the claim.

===Equity will not suffer a wrong to be without a remedy===
When seeking an equitable relief, the one that has been wronged has the stronger hand. The stronger hand is the one that has the capacity to ask for a [[legal remedy]] (judicial relief). In equity, this form of remedy is usually one of [[specific performance]] or an [[injunction]] (injunctive relief). These are superior remedies to those administered at common law such as [[damages]]. The [[Latin]] [[legal maxim]] is ''ubi jus ibi remedium'' ("where there is a wrong, there must be a remedy"), sometimes cited as '''''ubi jus ibi remediam'''''.

The maxim is necessarily subordinate to positive principles and cannot be applied either to subvert established rules of law or to give the courts a [[jurisdiction]] hitherto unknown, and it is only in a general not in a literal sense that the maxim has force.

[[Case law]] dealing with the principle of this maxim at law include ''[[Ashby v White]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ashby v White]]'' (1703) 92 ER 126&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents]]'', {{ussc|403|388|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of this principle at law was key in the decision of ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', {{ussc|5|137|1803|Cranch|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein it was necessary to establish that [[William Marbury|Marbury]] had a right to his commission in the first place in order for [[John Marshall|Chief Justice Marshall]] to make his more wide-ranging decision.

===Equity delights in equality/Equality is equity (''Aequalitus est quasi equitas'')===


Where two persons have an equal right, the property will be divided equally. 

This maxim flows from the fundamental notion of equality or impartiality due to the conception of Equity and is the source of many equitable doctrines. The maxim is of very wide application. The rule of ordinary law may give one party an advantage over the other. But, the court of equity where it can, put the litigating parties on a footing of equality. Equity proceeds in the principle that a right or liability should as far as possible, be equalized among all interested.
In the Simple Word's then Two parties have equal Rights in any of property so the same was distributed equal as per their concerned Law.

===One who seeks equity must do equity===
To receive [[equitable relief]], the petitioning party must be willing to complete all of its own obligations as well. The applicant to a court of equity is just as much subject to the power of that court as the defendant. This maxim may also overlap with the [[#One who comes into equity must come with clean hands|clean hands maxim]] (see below).

===Equity aids the vigilant not the indolent===
''Vigilantibus non dormientibus aequitas subvenit''.

A person who has been wronged must act relatively swiftly to preserve their rights. Otherwise, they are guilty of [[Laches (equity)|laches]], an untoward delay in litigation with the presumed intent of denying claims.  This differs from a [[statute of limitations]], in that a delay is particularized to individual situations, rather than a general prescribed legal amount of time.  In addition, even where a limitation period has not yet run, laches may still occur.  The equitable rule of laches and acquiescence was first introduced in ''[[Chief Young Dede v. African Association Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chief Young Dede v. African Association Ltd]]'' (1910) 1 N.L.R 130 at 133&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatives:
*Delay defeats equity
*Equity aids the vigilant, not those who sleep on their rights

===Equity imputes an intent to fulfill an obligation===
Generally speaking, near performance of a general [[obligation]] will be treated as sufficient unless the law requires perfect performance, such as in the exercise of an option. Text writers give an example of a [[debtor]] leaving a [[legacy (property law)|legacy]] to his [[creditor]] equal to or greater than his obligation. Equity regards such a [[gift]] as performance of the obligation so the creditor cannot claim both the legacy and payment of the [[debt]].
  
Where a claimant is under an obligation to do one thing but does another, his action may be treated as close enough approximation of the required act. A claimant who has undertaken an obligation, will, through his later conduct be interpreted as fulfilment of that obligation.

===Equity acts ''in personam'' (i.e. on persons rather than on objects)===
In England, there was a distinction drawn between the jurisdiction of the law courts and that of the chancery court. Courts of law had jurisdiction over [[in rem|property]] as well as [[in personam|persons]] and their coercive power arose out of their ability to adjust ownership rights. Courts of equity had power over [[in personam|persons]]. Their coercive power arose from the ability, on authority of the crown, to hold a violator in [[Contempt of court|contempt]], and take away his or her freedom (or money) until he or she purged himself or herself of his or her contumacious behavior. This distinction helped preserve a separation of powers between the two courts.

Nevertheless, courts of equity also developed a doctrine that an applicant must assert a "property interest". This was a limitation on their own power to issue relief. This does not mean that the courts of equity had taken jurisdiction over property. Rather, it means that they came to require that the applicant assert a right of some significant substance as opposed to a claim for relief based on an injury to mere emotional or dignitary interests.

===Equity abhors a forfeiture===
Today, a mortgagor refers to his interest in the property as his "equity". The origin of the concept, however, was actually a mirror-image of the current practice.

At [[common law]], a [[mortgage]] was a [[conveyancing|conveyance]] of the [[property]], with a [[condition subsequent]], that if the grantor paid the secured indebtedness to the grantee on or before a date certain (the "law" day) then the conveyance would be void, otherwise to remain in full force and effect. As was inevitable, debtors would be unable to pay on the law day, and if they tendered the debt after the time had passed, the creditor owed no duty to give the land back. So then the debtor would run to the court of equity, plead that there was an unconscionable forfeiture about to occur, and beg the court to grant an equitable decree requiring the lender to surrender the property upon payment of the [[secured debt]] with interest to date. And the equity courts granted these petitions quite regularly and often without regard for the amount of time that had lapsed since the law day had passed. The lender could interpose a defense of [[laches (equity)|laches]], saying that so much time had gone by (and so much improvement and betterment had taken place) that it would be inequitable to require undoing the finality of the mortgage conveyance. Other defenses, including [[equitable estoppel]], were used to bar redemption as well.

This unsettling system had a negative impact on the willingness of lenders to accept real estate as collateral security for loans. Since a lender could not re-sell the property until it had been in uncontested possession for years, or unless it could show changed circumstances, the value of real estate collateral was significantly impaired. Impaired, that is, until lawyers concocted the bill of foreclosure, whereby a mortgagee could request a decree that unless the mortgagor paid the debt by a date certain (and after the law date set in the mortgage), the mortgagor would thereafter be barred and foreclosed of all right, [[Title (property)|title]] and [[equity of redemption]] in and to the mortgaged premises.

To complete the circle, one needs to understand that when a mortgagor fails to pay an installment when due, and the mortgagee accelerates the mortgage, requiring immediate repayment of the entire mortgage indebtedness, the mortgagor does not have a right to pay the past-due installment(s) and have the mortgage reinstated. In ''[[Graf v. Hope Building Corp.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Graf v. Hope Building Corp.]]'', 254 NY 1 (1930)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[New York Court of Appeals]] observed that in such a case, there was no forfeiture, only the operation of a clause fair on its face, to which the mortgagor had freely assented. In the latter 20th Century, New York's lower courts eroded the ''Graf'' doctrine to such a degree that it appears that it is no longer the law, and that a court of conscience has the power to mandate that a default be excused if it is equitable to do so. Of course, now that the pendulum is swinging in the opposite direction, we can expect courts to explain where the limits on the newly expanded equity of redemption lie...and it is probably not a coincidence that the cases that have eroded ''[[Graf v. Hope Building Corp.]]'' have been accompanied by the rise of [[arbitration]] as a means for enforcing mortgages.&lt;ref&gt;See Osborne, ''Real Estate Finance Law'' (West, 1979), Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equity does not require an idle gesture===
Also: Equity will not compel a court to do a vain and useless thing. It would be an idle gesture for the court to grant [[reformation of a contract]] and then to deny to the prevailing party an opportunity to perform it as modified.

===He who comes into equity must come with clean hands===
It is often stated that one who comes into equity must come with [[Unclean hands|clean hands]] (or alternatively, equity will not permit a party to profit by his own wrong). In other words, if you ask for help about the actions of someone else but have acted wrongly, then you do not have clean hands and you may not receive the help you seek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII| |court=UKHL |year=1993 |num=3 |litigants=Tinsley v Milligan |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if you desire your tenant to vacate, you must have not violated the tenant's rights.

However, the requirement of clean hands does not mean that a "bad person" cannot obtain the aid of equity. "Equity does not demand that its suitors shall have led blameless lives."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Loughran v. Loughran]]'', {{ussc|292|216|1934|pin=229}}, ([[Louis Brandeis|Brandeis, J.]])&lt;/ref&gt; The defense of unclean hands only applies if there is a nexus between the applicant's wrongful act and the rights he wishes to enforce.

In ''[[D &amp; C Builders Ltd v Rees]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[D &amp; C Builders Ltd v Rees]] |year=1965 |court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=3 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a small building firm did some work on the house of a couple named Rees. The bill came to £732, of which the Rees had already paid £250. When the builders asked for the balance of £482, the Rees announced that the work was defective, and they were only prepared to pay £300.&lt;ref&gt; Mrs Rees: "My husband will pay you £300. It is all you'll get. It is to be in satisfaction".&lt;/ref&gt;  As the builders were in serious financial difficulties (as the Rees knew), they reluctantly accepted the £300 "in completion of the account". The decision to accept the money would not normally be binding in contract law, and afterwards the builders sued the Rees for the outstanding amount. The Rees claimed that the court should apply the doctrine of [[equitable estoppel|promissory estoppel]],&lt;ref&gt;Promissory estoppel was established by Denning J in ''[[Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd]]'' [1947] [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 130.&lt;/ref&gt; which can make promises binding even when unsupported by consideration. However, [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]] refused to apply the doctrine, on the grounds that the Rees had taken unfair advantage of the builders' financial difficulties, and therefore had not come "with clean hands".

===Equity delights to do justice and not by halves===
When a court of equity is presented with a good claim to equitable relief, and it is clear that the plaintiff ''also'' sustained monetary damages, the court of equity has jurisdiction to render legal relief, e.g., monetary damages. Hence equity does not stop at granting equitable relief, but goes on to render a full and complete collection of remedies.

===Equity will take jurisdiction to avoid a multiplicity of suits===
Thus, "where a court of equity has all the parties before it, it will adjudicate upon all of the rights of the parties connected with the subject matter of the action, so as to avoid a multiplicity of suits."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Burnworth v. Hughes]]'', {{West|P|670|2|917|Kan.|1983|922}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the basis for the procedures of [[interpleader]], [[class action]], and the more rarely used [[Bill of Peace]].

===Equity follows the law===
This maxim, also expressed as ''Aequitas sequitur legem'', means more fully that "equity will not allow a remedy that is contrary to law."

The [[Court of Chancery]] never claimed to override the courts of common law. [[Joseph Story|Story]] states "where a rule, either of the common or the statute law is direct, and governs the case with all its circumstances, or the particular point, a court of equity is as much bound by it as a court of law, and can as little justify a departure from it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Story|first1=Joseph|last2=Randell|first2=Alfred Edward
|title=Story on Equity''|edition= third English|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|year= 1920 |page= 34}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Edmund Henry Turner Snell]],  “It is only when there is some important circumstance disregarded by the common law rules that equity interferes.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Snell's Principles of Equity|edition  =  20 |last1=Snell|first1=Edmund Henry Turner|last2= |first2= |last3=|first3=|year=1929 |publisher= Sweet &amp; Maxwell|location= London
|ol= |page=24}} quoted in Williams, James (1932). [https://books.google.com/books?id=0Yc6AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA166 ''The Statute of Frauds''], p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Cardozo|Cardozo]] wrote in his dissent in ''[[Graf v. Hope Building Corporation]]'', 254 N.Y 1 at 9 (1930), "Equity works as a supplement for law and does not supersede the prevailing law."

[[Frederic William Maitland|Maitland]] says, “We ought not to think of common law and equity as of two rival systems."&lt;ref&gt;Maitland, Frederic William (1932). [https://books.google.com/books?id=CTk9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA19 ''Equity; Also the Forms of Action at Common Law: Two Courses of Lectures''], p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; "Equity [[Matthew 5:17|had come not to destroy the law, but to fulfil it]]. [[Matthew 5:18|Every jot and every title]] of law was to be obeyed, but when all this had been done yet something might be needful, something that equity would require."&lt;ref&gt;Maitland (1932), p. 17. {{full|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of law and equity was the same but due to historical reasons they chose a different path.  Equity respected every word of law and every right at law but where the law was defective, in those cases, equity provides equitable right and remedies.

In the Province of Ontario, Canada, instead of equity following the law, the law follows equity – as per the Ontario Courts of Justice Act:

(2) ''Where a rule of equity conflicts with a rule of the common law, the rule of equity prevails.'' R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, s. 96 (2); 1993, c. 27, Sched.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90c43#BK132|title=Law Document English View|date=2014-07-24|newspaper=Ontario.ca|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equity will not assist a volunteer ===
A volunteer is defined in equity as one who has not offered [[consideration]] for a benefit they have received or expect to receive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Australian Law Dictionary 2nd ed|last=Mann|first=Trischa|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780195518511|location=Australia|pages=756}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if a person A expects from past conversations and friendship to receive property under any will of person B, but person B dies before writing this into their will, person A, having not made any contribution to person B, will not be able to seek equity's aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|12|1990|litigants=Corin v Patton |parallelcite=(1990) 169 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 540 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This maxim is very important in restitution. [[Restitution]] developed as a series of writs called special [[assumpsit]], which were later additions in the courts of law, and were more flexible tools of recovery, based on equity. Restitution could provide means of recovery when people bestowed benefits on one another (such as giving money or providing services) according to contracts that would have been legally unenforceable.

However, pursuant to the equitable maxim, restitution does not allow a volunteer or "officious intermeddler" to recover. 

Those successfully pleading benefit from an [[estoppel]] (promise relied on to their detriment) will not be considered volunteers for the purpose of this maxim.

===Where equities are equal, the law will prevail===
Equity will provide no specific remedies where the parties' causes are to be seen to be equal, or where neither has been wronged.

The significance of this maxim is that applicants to the [[chancellor]]s often did so because of the formal [[pleading]] of the law courts, and the lack of flexibility they offered to litigants. Law courts and legislature, as lawmakers, through the limits of the substantive law they had created, thus inculcated a certain status quo that affected private conduct, and private ordering of disputes. Equity could alter that status quo, ignoring the clearly imposed limits of legal relief, or legal defences. But courts applying equity are reluctant to do so. This maxim reflects this. If the law firmly denied a [[cause of action]] or suggested equities between the parties were as a matter of policy equal, equity would provide no relief; if the law did provide relief, then the applicant would be obligated to bring a legal, rather than equitable action. This maxim overlaps with the previously mentioned "[[#Equity follows the law|equity follows the law]]."

===Between equal equities the first in order of time shall prevail===
This maxim operates where there are two or more competing equitable interests; when two equities are equal the original interest (i.e., the first in time) will succeed.

===Equity will not complete an imperfect gift===
If a donor has made an imperfect [[gift]], i.e. lacking the formalities required at [[common law]], equity will not assist the intended [[donee]]. This maxim is a subset of [[#Equity will not aid a volunteer|equity will not assist a volunteer]] .

Note the exception in ''[[Strong v Bird]]'' (1874) LR 18 Eq 315. If the donor appoints the intended donee as executor of his/her will, and the donor subsequently dies, equity will perfect the imperfect gift.

===Equity will not allow a statute to be used as a cloak for fraud===
Equity prevents a party from relying upon an absence of a [[statutory]] formality if to do so would be [[unconscionable]] and unfair. This can occur in [[secret trust]]s, [[constructive trust]]s etc.

===Equity will not allow a trust to fail for want of a trustee===
If there is no [[trustee]], whoever has legal [[title (property)|title]] to the [[trust (law)|trust]] [[property]] will be considered the trustee. Otherwise, a court may appoint a trustee.  In Ireland, the trustee may be any administrator of a [[charitable organization|charity]] to which the trust is related.

===Equity regards the beneficiary as the true owner===
Due to limits in old [[Common Law]], no remedy was had for beneficiaries if, for example, a [[trustee]] ran off with the trust [[property]]. To remedy this and protect intended recipients of trust property, Equity regarded the beneficiary as the true (eventual) owners of the [[trust (law)|trust]] property.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10695">In [[linguistics]], '''meaning''' is the information or concepts that a sender intends to convey, or does convey, in communication with a receiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=meaning|website=Dictionary.com Unabridged|publisher=Random House, Inc.|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/meaning|accessdate=December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.njit.edu/~lipuma/352comproc/comproc.htm|title=Communication Process|author=Nick Sanchez|publisher=New Jersey Institute of Technology|accessdate=January 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The sources of ambiguity ==
{{+rs|date=March 2016}}
Ambiguity means confusion about what is conveyed, since the current context may lead to different interpretations of meaning. Many words in many languages have [[polysemy|multiple definitions]]. Ambiguity is an effect of a rupture of the [[Law of identity|rule of identity]] in the context of the exchange of information. Particularly the ''sender'' may be physically absent, and the contexts explicitly divergent, such as will be the case when the receptor is a reader and the ''sender'' was a writer.

=== Pragmatics ===
{{main|Pragmatics}}

Pragmatics is the study of how context affects meaning.  The two primary forms of context important to pragmatics are [[linguistic context]] and situation context.

Linguistic context is how meaning is understood without relying on intent and assumptions.  In applied pragmatics, for example, meaning is formed through sensory experiences, even though sensory stimulus cannot be easily articulated in language or signs.  Pragmatics, then, reveals that meaning is both something affected by and affecting the world.  Meaning is something contextual with respect to language and the world, and is also something active toward other meanings and the world. Linguistic context becomes important when looking at particular linguistic problems such as that of pronouns.

Situation context refers to every non-linguistic factor that affects the meaning of a phrase. An example of situation context can be seen in the phrase "it's cold in here", which can either be a simple statement of fact or a request to turn up the heat, depending on, among other things, whether or not it is believed to be in the listener's power to affect the temperature.

=== Semantic meaning ===
{{main|Semantics}}

The relationship between words and their referents is called semantic.&lt;ref&gt;https://tr.scribd.com/document/137895627/%D0%92-%D0%9D-%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2-%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0&lt;/ref&gt; Semantics is the study of how meaning is conveyed through [[sign (semiotics)|sign]]s and [[language]]. Understanding how [[facial expressions]], [[body language]], and [[intonation (linguistics)|tone]] affect meaning, and how words, phrases, sentences, and punctuation relate to meaning are examples. Various subgroups of semantics are studied within the fields of linguistics, logic and [[Semantics (computer science)|computing]]. For example, [[Formal semantics (linguistics)|linguistic semantics]] includes the history of how words have been used in the past; [[Formal semantics (logic)|logical semantics]] includes how people mean and refer in terms of likely intent and assumptions.

During the 19th century, [[John Stuart Mill]] defined semantic meaning with the words "denotation" and "connotation".&lt;ref name="JSM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/#LanLog |title=John Stuart Mill |author=Fred Wilson |date=Jan 3, 2002 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford |accessdate=October 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A denotation is the literal or primary meaning of a word. Connotations are ideas or feelings that a word invokes for a person in addition to its literal or primary meaning.

The original use of "meaning" as understood early in the 20th century occurred through [[Lady Welby]], after her daughter translated the term "semantics" from French.

=== Conceptual meaning ===
{{main|Concept}}

Languages allow information to be conveyed even when the specific words used are not known by the reader or listener. People connect words with meaning and use words to refer to concepts. A person's intentions affect what is meant. ''Meaning'' (in English) as ''intent'' harkens back to the Anglo-Saxons and is associated today still, with the German verb ''[[wikt:meinen|meinen]]'' as to think or intend.

== Semiotics ==
{{main|Semiotics}}

[[Ferdinand de Saussure]], in founding semiology, his original subset of the semiotics, started describing language in terms of ''Signs'', dividing those ''signs'' in turn into ''signifieds'' and ''signifiers''.  The signifier is the [[perception|perceptive]] side of a sign, thus the [[Hearing|sound]] form in case of oral language.  The signified is the signification ([[semantics|semantic]]) side, the mental construction or image associated with the sound, by either a speaker and hearer. A sign, then, is essentially a relationship between signified and signifier.

Signs are essentially [[conventional]], as any foreign language student is well aware: there is no reason that ''bat'' couldn't mean "body of water" or even "that bust of Napoleon over there". Since the choice of signifiers is ultimately arbitrary, the meaning cannot somehow be ''in'' the signifier. Saussure instead defers meaning to the sign itself: meaning is ultimately the same thing as the sign, and ''meaning'' means that relationship is between signified and signifier. All meaning is both within us and communal, thus [[culture|cultural]]. Signs "mean" by reference to our internal lexicon and grammar, and despite there being a matter of convention, so the communal part, signs also, because of the individual's uniqueness, can mean something only to the individual (what ''red'' means to one person may not be what ''red'' means to another, either in absolute value, or by including what's suggested by the context). However, while meanings carried by one given set of signifiers may vary to some extent from individual to individual, only those meanings that stay within a boundary are seen by other speakers of the language to belong to the language: if one were to refer to smells as red, most other speakers would assume the person is talking nonsense (although statements like this are common among people who experience [[synesthesia]], or in poetry).

In [[philosophy]], '''moral responsibility''' is the status of [[morality|morally]] [[desert (philosophy)|deserving]] [[praise]], [[blame]], [[reward (psychology)|reward]], or [[punishment]] for an act or omission performed or neglected in accordance with one's [[moral obligation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Klein |first= Martha |authorlink= Martha Klein |editor-first= Ted |editor-last= Honderich |editor-link = Ted Honderich | encyclopedia = Oxford Companion to Philosophy | title = responsibility | url = http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199264797.001.0001/acref-9780199264797-e-2205 | year = 2005 | quote = The term 'moral responsibility' covers (i) the having of a moral obligation and (ii) the fulfilment of the criteria for deserving blame or praise (punishment or reward) for a morally significant act or omission.}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
Deciding what (if anything) counts as "morally obligatory" is a principal concern of [[ethics]].

Philosophers refer to people who have moral responsibility for an action as [[moral agents]]. Agents have the capability to reflect upon their situation, to form [[intention]]s about how they will act, and then to carry out that action. The notion of [[free will]] has become an important issue in the debate on whether individuals are ever morally responsible for their actions and, if so, in what sense. [[Incompatibilist]]s regard determinism as at odds with free will, whereas [[compatibilist]]s think the two can coexist.
 
Moral responsibility does not necessarily equate to [[legal liability |legal responsibility]]. A person is legally responsible for an event when a legal system is liable to penalise that person for that event. Although it may often be the case that when a person is morally responsible for an act, they are also legally responsible for it, the two states do not always coincide.{{Citation needed|date= September 2011}}

==Philosophical stance==
[[File:DeterminismXFreeWill.svg|thumb|220px|Various philosophical positions exist, disagreeing over [[determinism]] and free will]]
Depending on how a philosopher conceives of [[free will]], they will have different views on moral responsibility.&lt;ref name=Cave&gt;{{cite book |title=Responsibility in Law and Morality |author=Peter Cave |page =4 |quote=A common argument in the philosophical literature is that the essence of responsibility is to be found in what it means to be a human agent and to have free will...There is disagreement amongst philosophers about what freedom means, about whether human beings are free in the relevant sense, and about the relevance of freedom to responsibility... Nevertheless,...our responsibility practices have developed, and thrive, independently of ‘the truth’ about human freedom.|isbn=1841133213 |year=2002 |publisher=Hart Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incompatibilism===
{{main article|Incompatibilism}}

====Metaphysical libertarianism====
{{main article|Libertarianism (metaphysics)}}
[[Metaphysical libertarian]]s think actions are not always causally determined, allowing for the possibility of free will and thus moral responsibility. All libertarians are also incompatibilists; they think that if causal determinism were true of human action; people would not have free will. Accordingly, libertarians subscribe to the principle of alternate possibilities, which posits that moral responsibility requires that people could have acted differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Woolfolk, Robert L.|first=Doris, John M., and Brianna, John M.|contribution=Identification, Situational Constraint, and Social Cognition: Studies in the Attribution of Moral Responsibility|title=Experimental Philosophy|editors=Knobe, Joshua, and Nichols, Shaun|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-532326-9|pages=61–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phenomenological considerations are sometimes invoked by incompatibilists to defend a libertarian position. In daily life, we feel as though choosing otherwise is a viable option. Although this feeling doesn't firmly establish the existence of free will, some incompatibilists claim the phenomenological feeling of alternate possibilities is a prerequisite for free will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nahmias, Eddy, |first=Morris, Stephen G., Nadelhoffer, Thomas N., and Turner, Jason|contribution=Is Incompatibilism Intuitive?|title=Experimental Philosophy|editors=Knobe, Joshua, and Nichols, Shaun|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-532326-9|pages=81–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] suggested that people sometimes avoid incrimination and responsibility by hiding behind determinism: "...we are always ready to take refuge in a belief in determinism if this freedom weighs upon us or if we need an excuse".&lt;ref name="Sartre2"&gt;Sartre, J.P. (1943)''Being and Nothingness'', reprint 1993. New York: Washington Square Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar view has it that individual moral culpability lies in individual character. That is, a person with the character of a murderer has no choice other than to murder, but can still be punished because it is right to punish those of bad character. How one's character was determined is irrelevant from this perspective. Robert Cummins, for example, argues that people should not be judged for their individual actions, but rather for how those actions "reflect on their character". If character (however defined) is the dominant causal factor in determining one's choices, and one's choices are morally wrong, then one should be held accountable for those choices, regardless of genes and other such factors.&lt;ref&gt;Vuoso, G. (1987) "Background Responsibility and Excuse," ''Yale Law Journal'', 96, pp. 1680–81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cummins, R. "Culpability" and Mental Disorder", p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

In law, there is a known exception to the assumption that moral culpability lies in either individual character or freely willed acts. The [[insanity defense]]—or its corollary, [[diminished responsibility]] (a sort of appeal to the [[fallacy of the single cause]])—can be used to argue that the guilty deed was not the product of a guilty mind.&lt;ref name = "Goldstein"&gt;Goldstein, A. M., Morse, S. J. &amp; Shapiro, D. L. 2003 "Evaluation of criminal responsibility". In ''Forensic psychology.'' vol. 11 (ed. A. M. Goldstein), pp. 381–406. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, the legal systems of most Western societies assume that the person is in some way not at fault, because his actions were a consequence of abnormal brain function (implying brain function is a deterministic causal agent of mind and motive).

=====The argument from luck=====

The argument from luck is a criticism against the libertarian conception of moral responsibility. It suggests that any given action, and even a person's character, is the result of various forces outside that person's control. It may not be reasonable, then, to hold that person solely morally responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-luck/|title=Moral Luck|date=January 26, 2004|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Nagel]] suggests that four different types of luck (including genetic influences and other external factors) end up influencing the way that a person's actions are evaluated morally. For instance, a person driving drunk may make it home without incident, and yet this action of ''drunk driving'' might seem more morally objectionable if someone happens to jaywalk along his path (getting hit by the car).&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, Thomas. 1976, "Moral Luck", Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society Supplementary vol. 50: 137–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

This argument can be traced back to [[David Hume]]. If physical indeterminism is true, then those events that are not determined are scientifically described as probabilistic or random. It is therefore argued that it is doubtful that one can praise or blame someone for performing an action generated randomly by his nervous system (without there being any non-physical agency responsible for the observed probabilistic outcome).&lt;ref name="Hume"&gt;Hume, D. (1740). ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' (1967 edition). [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford. {{ISBN|0-87220-230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hard determinism====
{{main article|Hard determinism}}
[[Hard determinist]]s (not to be confused with [[Fatalist]]s) often use [[liberty]] in practical moral considerations, rather than a notion of a free will. Indeed, faced with the possibility that determinism requires a completely different moral system, some proponents say "So much the worse for free will!".&lt;ref name="Ben1"&gt;Benditt, Theodore (1998) ''Philosophy Then and Now'' with eds. Arnold and Graham. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 1998. {{ISBN|1-55786-742-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clarence Darrow]], the famous defense attorney, pleaded the innocence of his clients, [[Leopold and Loeb]], by invoking such a notion of hard determinism.&lt;ref name="Darrow"&gt;Darrow, Clarence, 1924, "The Plea of Clarence Darrow, in Defense of Richard Loeb and Nathan Leopold, Jr., On Trial for Murder" page reference is to the reprint in Philosophical Explorations: Freedom, God, and Goodness, S. Cahn (ed.), New York: Prometheus Books, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; During his summation, he declared:

{{quote|What has this boy to do with it? He was not his own father; he was not his own mother; he was not his own grandparents. All of this was handed to him. He did not surround himself with governesses and wealth. He did not make himself. And yet he is to be compelled to pay.&lt;ref name="Darrow"/&gt;}}

[[Paul the Apostle]], in his [[Epistle to the Romans]] addresses the question of moral responsibility as follows: "Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?"&lt;ref&gt;St. Paul, "Epistle to the Romans", 9:21, ''King James Bible'' Tennessee:The Gideons International&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, individuals can still be dishonoured for their acts even though those acts were ultimately completely determined by God.

Joshua Greene and Jonathan Cohen, researchers in the emerging field of [[neuroethics]], argue, on the basis of such cases, that our current notion of moral responsibility is founded on libertarian (and [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]]) intuitions.&lt;ref name="Greene"&gt;Greene, J. Cohen, J. (2004). "For the law, neuroscience changes nothing and everything". ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B'', 359, 1775–1785.&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that [[cognitive neuroscience]] research (e.g. [[neuroscience of free will]]) is undermining these intuitions by showing that the brain is responsible for our actions, not only in cases of florid [[psychosis]], but also in less obvious situations. For example, damage to the [[frontal lobe]] reduces the ability to weigh uncertain risks and make prudent decisions, and therefore leads to an increased likelihood that someone will commit a violent crime.&lt;ref name = "Brower"&gt;Brower M.C. and Price B.H. (2001). "Neuropsychiatry of frontal lobe dysfunction in violent and criminal behaviour: a critical review". ''Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry'', 71: 720–726.&lt;/ref&gt; This is true not only of patients with damage to the frontal lobe due to accident or stroke, but also of adolescents, who show reduced frontal lobe activity compared to adults,&lt;ref name = "SteinScott"&gt;Steinberg, L., Scott, E. S. (2003). "Less guilty by reason of adolescence: developmental immaturity, diminished responsibility, and the juvenile death penalty".''American Psychologist'' 58, 1009–1018.&lt;/ref&gt; and even of children who are chronically neglected or mistreated.&lt;ref name = "TAPANK"&gt;Teicher, M. H., Anderson, S. L., Polcari, A., Anderson, C. M., Navalta, C. P., and Kim, D. M. (2003). "The neurobiological consequences of early stress and childhood maltreatment". ''Neuroscience and Behavioral Reviews'', 27: 33–44.&lt;/ref&gt; In each case, the guilty party can, they argue, be said to have less responsibility for his actions.&lt;ref name="Greene"/&gt; Greene and Cohen predict that, as such examples become more common and well known, jurors’ interpretations of free will and moral responsibility will move away from the intuitive libertarian notion that currently underpins them.

[[File:Prision del Condado de Mantras.JPG|thumb|right|180px|David Eagleman explains that nature and nurture cause all criminal behavior. He likewise believes that science demands that change and improvement, rather than guilt, must become the focus of the legal justice system.&lt;ref name=Eagleman&gt;[http://philosophybites.com/2011/05/david-eagleman-on-morality-and-the-brain.html David Eagleman, Philosophy Bites Podcast, "David Eagleman on Morality and the Brain"]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Greene and Cohen also argue that the legal system does not require this libertarian interpretation. Rather, they suggest that only retributive notions of [[justice]], in which the goal of the legal system is to punish people for misdeeds, require the libertarian intuition. Many forms of [[Ethical realism|ethically realistic]] and [[Consequentialism|consequentialist]] approaches to justice, which are aimed at promoting future welfare rather than retribution, can survive even a hard determinist interpretation of free will. Accordingly, the legal system and notions of justice can thus be maintained even in the face of emerging neuroscientific evidence undermining libertarian intuitions of free will.

Neuroscientist [[David Eagleman]] maintains similar ideas. Eagleman says that the legal justice system ought to become more forward looking. He says it is wrong to ask questions of narrow culpability, rather than focusing on what is important: what needs to change in a criminal's behavior and brain. Eagleman is not saying that no one is responsible for their crimes, but rather that the "sentencing phase" should correspond with modern neuroscientific evidence. To Eagleman, it is damaging to entertain the illusion that a person can make a single decision that is somehow, suddenly, independent of their physiology and history. He describes what scientists have learned from brain damaged patients, and offers the case of a school teacher who exhibited escalating [[pedophile|pedophilic]] tendencies on two occasions—each time as results of growing tumors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2943-brain-tumour-causes-uncontrollable-paedophilia.htmlNewScientist.com, "Brain tumour causes uncontrollable paedophilia"]&lt;/ref&gt; Eagleman also warns that less attractive people and minorities tend to get longer sentencing—all of which he sees as symptoms that more science is needed in the legal system.&lt;ref name=Eagleman/&gt;

====Hard incompatibilism====
[[Derk Pereboom (philosopher)|Derk Pereboom]] defends a skeptical position about free will he calls [[hard incompatibilism]]. In his view, we cannot have free will if our actions are causally determined by factors beyond our control, or if our actions are indeterministic events—if they happen by chance. Pereboom conceives of free will as the control in action required for moral responsibility in the sense involving deserved blame and praise, punishment and reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pereboom|first1=Derk|title=Living without Free Will|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he acknowledges that libertarian agent causation, the capacity of agents as substances to cause actions without being causally determined by factors beyond their control, is still a possibility, he regards it as unlikely against the backdrop of the most defensible physical theories. Without libertarian agent causation, Pereboom thinks the free will required for moral responsibility in the desert-involving sense is not in the offing.&lt;ref name="Pereboom 2005 228–247"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pereboom|first=Derk|title="Defending Hard Incompatibilism". In "Free Will and Moral Responsibility." |year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing, Inc.|location=Malden, MA|isbn=1-4051-3810-6|pages=228–247}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also contends that by contrast with the backward-looking, desert-involving sense of moral responsibility, forward-looking senses are compatible with causal determination. For instance, causally determined agents who act badly might justifiably be blamed with the aim of forming faulty character, reconciling impaired relationships, and protecting others from harm they are apt to cause.&lt;ref&gt;Pereboom, Derk (2014), 'Free Will, Agency, and Meaning in Life', Oxford: Oxford University Press, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pereboom proposes that a viable criminal jurisprudence is compatible with the denial of deserved blame and punishment. His view rules out retributivist justifications for punishment, but it allows for incapacitation of dangerous criminals on the analogy with quarantine of carriers of dangerous diseases. Isolation of carriers of the Ebola virus can be justified on the ground of the right to defend against threat, a justification that does not reference desert. Pereboom contends that the analogy holds for incapacitation of dangerous criminals. He also argues that the less serious the threat, the more moderate the justifiable method of incapacitation; for certain crimes only monitoring may be needed. In addition, just as we should do what we can, within reasonable bounds, to cure the carriers of the Ebola virus we quarantine, so we should aim to rehabilitate and reintegrate the criminals we incapacitate. Pereboom also proposes that given hard incompatibilism, punishment justified as general deterrence may be legitimate when the penalties don't involve undermining an agent's capacity to live a meaningful, flourishing life, since justifying such moderate penalties need not invoke desert.&lt;ref&gt;Pereboom, Derk (2001), ''Living without Free Will'', Chapter 7; Pereboom, Derk (2014), ''Free Will, Agency, and Meaning in Life'', Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compatibilism===
{{main article|Compatibilism}}
[[File:Handcuffs-20060604.jpg|thumb|right|Some forms of compatibilism suggest the term ''free will'' should only be used to mean something more like liberty.]]

Compatibilists contend that even if determinism were true, it would still be possible for us to have free will. The Hindu text ''[[Bhagavad Gita|The Bhagavad Gita]]'' offers one very early compatibilist account. Facing the prospect of going to battle against kinsmen to whom he has bonds, Arjuna despairs. Krishna attempts to assuage Arjuna's anxieties. He argues that forces of nature come together to produce actions, and it is only vanity that causes us to regard ourselves as the agent in charge of these actions. However, Krishna adds this caveat: "... [But] the Man who knows the relation between the forces of Nature and actions, witnesses how some forces of Nature work upon other forces of Nature, and becomes [not] their slave..." When we are ignorant of the relationship between forces of Nature, we become passive victims of nomological facts. Krishna's admonition is intended to get Arjuna to perform his duty (i.e., fight in the battle), but he is also claiming that being a successful moral agent requires being mindful of the wider circumstances in which one finds oneself.&lt;ref name="The Bhagavad Gita"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Bhagavad Gita|year=1962|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paramahansa Yogananda also said, "Freedom means the power to act by soul guidance, not by the compulsions of desires and habits. Obeying the ego leads to bondage; obeying the soul brings liberation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Inspirational Thought for Each Day|year=1977|publisher=Self-Realization Fellowship|location=California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Western tradition, Baruch Spinoza echoes the ''Bhagavad Gita{{'}}''s point about agents and natural forces, writing "men think themselves free because they are conscious of their volitions and their appetite, and do not think, even in their dreams, of the causes by which they are disposed to wanting and willing, because they are ignorant [of those causes]."&lt;ref name="Pereboom 2005 228–247"/&gt; Krishna is hostile to the influence of passions on our rational faculties, speaking up instead for the value of heeding the dictates of one's own nature: "Even a wise man acts under the impulse of his nature. Of what use is restraint?"&lt;ref name="The Bhagavad Gita"/&gt; Spinoza similarly identifies the taming of one's passions as a way to extricate oneself from merely being passive in the face of external forces and a way toward following our own natures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Baruch Spinoza|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other views===
[[Daniel Dennett]] asks why anyone would care about whether someone had the property of responsibility and speculates that the idea of moral responsibility may be "a purely metaphysical hankering".&lt;ref name="DD1"&gt;Dennett, D., (1984) ''Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting''. Bradford Books. {{ISBN|0-262-54042-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mauro suggests that a sense of personal responsibility does not operate or evolve universally among humankind. He argues that it was absent in the successful civilization of the [[Iroquois]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, research in [[experimental philosophy]] has explored whether people's untutored intuitions about determinism and moral responsibility are compatibilist or incompatibilist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Eddy |last=Nahmias|author2=Stephen Morris |author3=Thomas Nadelhoffer |author4=Jason Turner  |title=Is Incompatibilism Intuitive? |journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=28–52 |doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2006.tb00603.x|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some experimental work has included cross-cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;Hagop Sarkissian, Amita Chatterjee, Felipe De Brigard, Joshua Knobe, Shaun Nichols, Smita Sirker (forthcoming).[http://faculty.baruch.cuny.edu/hsarkissian/Is%20Belief%20in%20Free%20Will%20a%20Universal_final.pdf "Is belief in free will a cultural universal?"] Mind &amp; Language&lt;/ref&gt; However, the debate about whether people naturally have compatibilist or incompatibilist intuitions has not come out overwhelmingly in favor of one view or the other, finding evidence for both views. For instance, when people are presented with abstract cases that ask if a person could be morally responsible for an immoral act when they could not have done otherwise, people tend to say no, or give ''incompatibilist'' answers. When presented with a specific immoral act that a specific person committed, people tend to say that that person is morally responsible for their actions, even if they were determined (that is, people also give ''compatibilist'' answers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Shaun|last=Nichols |authorlink=Shaun Nichols |author2=[[Joshua Knobe]]  |title=Moral Responsibility and Determinism: The Cognitive Science of Folk Intuitions |journal=[[Noûs]] |volume=41 |issue=4|pages=663–685 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00666.x |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neuroscience of free will investigates various experiments that might shed light on free will.

==Collective==
{{Main article|Collective responsibility}}
When people attribute moral responsibility, they usually attribute it to individual moral agents.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/677842 |title=Creating the Responsible Consumer: Moralistic Governance Regimes and Consumer Subjectivity |year=2014 |last1=Giesler |first1=Markus|last2=Veresiu |first2=Ela |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=41 |issue=October |pages=849–867}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Joel Feinberg, among others, has argued that corporations and other groups of people can have what is called ‘collective moral responsibility’ for a state of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Risser, David T. 2006. 'Collective Moral Responsibility'. [http://www.iep.utm.edu/c/collecti.htm ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''] (Accessed 8 Sept 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when [[South Africa]] had an [[apartheid]] regime, the country's government might have been said to have had collective moral responsibility for the violation of the rights of non-European South Africans.

==Lack of sense of responsibility of psychopaths==
One of the attributes defined for [[psychopathy]] is "failure to accept responsibility for own actions".&lt;ref name=factorstructure&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harpur, T. J., Hare, R. D., &amp; Hakstian, A. R.|title=Two-factor conceptualization of psychopathy: Construct validity and assessment implications.|journal=Psychological Assessment|volume=1|issue=1|pages=6–17|year=1989|doi=10.1037/1040-3590.1.1.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artificial systems ==

The emergence of [[Outline of automation|automation, robotics and related technologies]] prompted the question, 'Can an artificial system be morally responsible?'&lt;ref name="Allen2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=Colin|last2=Varner|first2=Gary|last3=Zinser|first3=Jason|title=Prolegomena to any future artificial moral agent|journal=Journal of Experimental &amp; Theoretical Artificial Intelligence|date=2000|volume=12|issue=3|pages=251–261|doi=10.1080/09528130050111428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=Colin|last2=Smit|first2=Iva|last3=Wallach|first3=Wendell|title=Artificial Morality: Top-down, Bottom-up and Hybrid Approaches|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=September 2005|volume=7|issue=3|pages=149–155|doi=10.1007/s10676-006-0004-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sparrow|first1=Robert|title=Killer Robots|journal=Journal of Applied Philosophy|date=2007|volume=24|issue=1|pages=62–77|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5930.2007.00346.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question has a closely related variant, 'When (if ever) does moral responsibility transfer from its human creator(s) to the system?'.&lt;ref name="Grodzinsky2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grodzinsky|first1=Frances S.|last2=Miller|first2=Keith W.|last3=Wolf|first3=Marty J.|title=The ethics of designing artificial agents|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=21 Jun 2008|volume=10|issue=2-3|pages=115–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuflik1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuflik|first1=Arthur|title=Computers in control: Rational transfer of authority or irresponsible abdication of autonomy?|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=1999|volume=1|issue=3|pages=173–184|doi=10.1023/A:1010087500508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The questions ''arguably'' adjoin with but are distinct from [[machine ethics]], which is concerned with the moral behavior of artificial systems.  Whether an artificial system's behavior qualifies it to be morally responsible has been a key focus of debate.

=== Arguments that artificial systems cannot be morally responsible ===

Batya Friedman and Peter Kahn Jr posited that [[intentionality]] is a necessary condition for moral responsibility, and that computer systems as conceivable in 1992 in material and structure could not have intentionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=Batya|last2=Kahn, Jr.|first2=Peter H.|title=Human Agency and Responsible Computing: Implications for Computer System Design|journal=Journal of Systems and Software|date=January 1992|volume=17|issue=1|pages=7–14|doi=10.1016/0164-1212(92)90075-u}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur Kuflik asserted that humans must bear the ultimate moral responsibility for a computer's decisions, as it is humans who design the computers and write their programs. He further proposed that humans can never relinquish oversight of computers.&lt;ref name="Kuflik1999" /&gt;

Frances Grodzinsky et al. considered artificial systems that could be modelled as [[finite state machines]].  They posited that if the machine had a fixed state transition table, then it could not be morally responsible. If the machine could modify its table, then the machine's designer still retained some moral responsibility.&lt;ref name="Grodzinsky2008" /&gt;

Patrick Hew argued that for an artificial system to be morally responsible, its rules for behaviour and the mechanisms for supplying those rules must not be supplied entirely by external humans.  He further argued that such systems are a substantial departure from technologies and theory as extant in 2014.  An artificial system based on those technologies will carry zero responsibility for its behaviour.  Moral responsibility is apportioned to the humans that created and programmed the system.&lt;ref name="Hew2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hew|first1=Patrick Chisan|title=Artificial moral agents are infeasible with foreseeable technologies|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=13 May 2014|volume=16|issue=3|pages=197–206|doi=10.1007/s10676-014-9345-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(A more extensive review of arguments may be found in.&lt;ref name="Hew2014"/&gt;)

=== Arguments that artificial systems can be morally responsible ===

Colin Allen et al. proposed that an artificial system may be morally responsible if its behaviours are functionally indistinguishable from a moral person, coining the idea of a 'Moral Turing Test'.&lt;ref name="Allen2000"/&gt; They subsequently disavowed the Moral Turing Test in recognition of controversies surrounding the [[Turing Test]].&lt;ref name="Allen2005" /&gt;

Andreas Matthias described a 'responsibility gap' where to hold humans responsible for a machine would be an injustice, but to hold the machine responsible would challenge 'traditional' ways of ascription.  He proposed three cases where the machine's behaviour ought to be attributed to the machine and not its designers or operators.  First, he argued that modern machines are inherently unpredictable (to some degree), but perform tasks that need to be performed yet cannot be handled by simpler means.  Second, that there are increasing 'layers of obscurity' between manufacturers and system, as hand coded programs are replaced with more sophisticated means.  Third, in systems that have rules of operation that can be changed during the operation of the machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matthias|first1=Andreas|title=The responsibility gap: Ascribing responsibility for the actions of learning automata|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=2004|volume=6|issue=3|pages=175–183|doi=10.1007/s10676-004-3422-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Nabawiya Mohamed Musa Badawia, the inspiring [[Zagazig]]i fallahi woman that had strong nationalism and feminism ideas as a young-woman, she stood for the rights of her nation and fellow [[Egyptians|Egyptian women]].

In 1923, she and two of her fellow activists, Cesa Nabarawi and Nabawiya Moussa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nabawiyya Musa was one of the first and last women to complete the education exam and be accepted into the Saniyya School under [[Colonialism|colonial rule]] because of their [who?] fear of women becoming too powerful ina society led by men. In her childhood her brother helped her learn to read and write at home; while she taught herself Math principles. By the time she turned thirteen she was keen on continuing her school education but her family refused, thus defying the established social norms of the time she stole her mother's stamp and sold her gold bracelet to apply for school and went on with her studies secretly against her family's wishes.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

She finished her High School education in 1907 to become the first girl ever to finish high school in Egypt. In 1908 she finished her degree in education and went on to be a prominent educator for the middle-class and an advocate for [[Feminism|women’s rights]].&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; It was not until after 1922 that more women were let into the newly established Egyptian University and by this time Nabawiyya Musa was a key lecturer and leader among her colleagues.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Nabawiyya musa is famous because she was the first Egyption woman to go to high school.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt;

==Career==
Nabawiyya Musa was an avid writer and educator who gave lectures around Egypt advocating for the education of women. She believed strongly that educated women would only improve the state by being able to be independent, bring in money for the household as middle-class women and/or raise their children to be independent so they could grow up to be assets to society.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arab"/&gt; She believed strongly that the lack of hierarchy in the peasant and [[Social class|lower classes]] was actually a good model of how women can be an asset to work and [[Equal opportunity|equal opportunities]] with men. She also believed that the differences between men and women were nothing but a social construct and could easily be broken with time. Through giving women and education she sought to end [[Rape|sexual violence]] against women. She believed that by giving women an equal status in the workforce and in education would make them less vulnerable and less prone to sexual violence.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arab"/&gt;

==The Feminist Movement==
Nabawiyya Musa was an integral part in the [[feminist movement]] in Egypt. She stood out because many of her views echoed very strong [[Egyptian Nationalism]] as well as equal opportunities for women. Along with highlighting the education of women, she was also a leading [[role model]] in breaking down the social constructs of women. She and her partners in the feminist movement believed that a radical call for unveiling of women was not needed in the beginning of the movement because Egypt was not ready to accept it. However, after attending a conference in Rome in 1923, she along with [[Huda Shaarawi]] and [[Ceza Nabarawi]] came back to Egypt unveiled as a proclamation to Egyptian society.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt;

==Death==
Musa died on April 30, 1951.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt;

In [[physics]], a '''one-loop Feynman diagram''' is a [[connected component (graph theory)|connected]] [[Feynman diagram]] with only one [[cycle (graph theory)|cycle]] ([[unicyclic graph|unicyclic]]). Such a diagram can be obtained from a connected [[Feynman_diagram|tree diagram]] by taking two external lines of the same type and joining them together into an edge.

Diagrams with loops (in graph theory, these kinds of loops are called [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]], while the word [[loop (graph theory)|loop]] is an edge connecting a vertex with itself) correspond to the quantum corrections to the classical field theory. Because one-loop diagrams only contain one cycle, they express the next-to-classical contributions called the ''[[Semiclassical physics|semiclassical]] contributions''.

One-loop diagrams are usually computed as the [[integral]] over one independent momentum that can "run in the cycle". The [[Casimir effect]], [[Hawking radiation]] and [[Lamb shift]] are examples of phenomena whose existence can be implied using one-loop Feynman diagrams, especially the well-known "triangle diagram":

::[[Image:Triangle diagram.svg]]

The evaluation of one-loop Feynman diagrams usually leads to divergent expressions, which are either due to:

* zero-mass particles in the cycle of the diagram ([[infrared divergence]]) or 
* insufficient falloff of the integrand for high momenta ([[ultraviolet divergence]]).

Infrared divergences are usually dealt with by assigning the zero mass particles a small mass ''λ'', evaluating the corresponding expression and then taking the limit &lt;math&gt;\lambda \to 0&lt;/math&gt;.  Ultraviolet divergences are dealt with by [[renormalization]].

==Effective Action==

The one-loop corrections lead to the following [[effective action]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma[\phi]=S[\phi]+\frac{1}{2} \mathop{\mathrm{Tr}}{\left[\log {S^{(2)}[\phi]}\right]+\dots}&lt;/math&gt;

== History ==
The [[Ottoman Empire]] (1299&amp;ndash;1923), the predecessor of modern [[Turkey]] was one of the 17 signatories of the [[Metre Convention]] in 1875. For 58 years both the international and the traditional units were in use, but after the proclamation of the Turkish Republic, the traditional units became obsolete. In 1931 by Act No. 1782, international units became compulsory and the traditional units were banned from use starting 1 January 1933.&lt;ref&gt;''Türkiye’nin 75 yılı'', Tempo yayınları, İstanbul, 1998, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

== Time ==
The traditional calendar of the Ottoman Empire was, like in most [[Muslim]] countries, the [[Islamic calendar]]. Its era begins from the [[Hegira|Hijra]] in 622 CE and each year is calculated using the 12 Arabian lunar months, approximately eleven days shorter than a Gregorian solar year. In 1839, however, a second calendar was put in use for official matters. The new calendar, which was called the [[Rumi calendar|Rumi]] also began by 622, but with an annual duration equal to a solar year after 1840. In modern Turkey, the [[Gregorian calendar]] was adopted as the legal calendar, beginning by the end of 1925. The Islamic calendar is still used when discussing dates in an Islamic context.

[[File:Portrait-of-Henry-Danvers-Earl-of-Danby.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Danvers, 1st Earl of Danby|Henry Danvers, Earl of Danby]], was outlawed in 1597 by a coroner's court for the murder of Henry Long. He went to France and joined the French army; two years later he was pardoned by Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] and returned to England.]]

In [[legal history|historical legal systems]], an '''outlaw''' is declared as outside the protection of the [[law]]. In pre-modern societies, the criminal is withdrawn all legal protection, so that anyone is legally empowered to [[persecute]] or kill them. Outlawry was thus one of the harshest penalties in the legal system. In [[early Germanic law]], the [[death penalty]] is conspicuously absent, and outlawing is the most extreme punishment, presumably amounting to a death sentence in practice. The concept is known from [[Roman law]], as the status of ''[[homo sacer]]'', and persisted throughout the [[Middle Ages]].

In the [[common law]] of England, a "Writ of Outlawry" made the pronouncement ''[[Caput lupinum]]'' ("Let his be a wolf's head", literally "May he bear a wolfish head") with respect to its subject, using "head" [[Synecdoche|to refer to the entire]] person (cf. "per capita") and equating that person with a wolf ([[warg]]) in the eyes of the law: not only was the subject deprived of all legal rights of the law being outside the "law", but others could kill him on sight as if he were a wolf or other wild animal.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Women were declared "waived" rather than outlawed but it was effectively the same punishment.&lt;ref name=NAstaff-2012&gt;{{cite web|author=National Archives staff |date=26 January 2012 |title=The outlaw in medieval and early modern England|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/records/research-guides/outlawry.htm |publisher= British [[National Archives]]|accessdate=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal history==

===Ancient Rome===
Among other forms of [[exile]], [[Roman law]] included the penalty of ''interdicere aquae et ignis'' ("to forbid water and fire"). People so penalized were required to leave Roman territory and forfeit their property. If they returned, they were effectively outlaws; providing them the use of fire or water was illegal, and they could be killed at will without legal penalty.{{sfn|Berger|p=507}}

''Interdicere aquae et ignis'' was traditionally imposed by the [[tribune of the plebs]], and is attested to have been in use during the [[First Punic War]] of the third century BC by [[Cato the Elder]].{{sfn|Kelly|2006|p=28}} It was later also applied by many other officials, such as the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], magistrates,{{sfn|Berger|p=507}} and [[Julius Caesar]] as a [[general]] and provincial governor during the [[Gallic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, Julius. ''De Bello Gallico'', book VI, section XLIV.&lt;/ref&gt; It fell out of use during the [[Principate|early Empire]].{{sfn|Berger|p=507}}

===England===
[[File:Robin Hood Memorial.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A statue of [[Robin Hood]], a heroic outlaw in English folklore]]
{{see also|Outlawries Bill}}
In [[English law|English]] [[common law]], an outlaw was{{when?|date=July 2018}} a person who had defied the laws of the realm, by such acts as ignoring a [[summons]] to court, or fleeing instead of appearing to plead when charged with a [[crime]].&lt;ref name=NAstaff-2012/&gt;

====Criminal====
The term ''outlawry ''referred to the formal procedure of declaring someone an outlaw, i.e. putting him outside the sphere of legal protection.&lt;ref name=NAstaff-2012/&gt; In the [[common law]] of England, a judgment of (criminal) outlawry was one of the harshest penalties in the legal system, since the outlaw could not use the legal system for protection, e.g. from [[mob justice]].  To be declared an outlaw was to suffer a form of [[civil death|civil]] or [[social death|social]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zygmunt |last=Bauman |year=n.d. |title=Modernity and Holocaust |page={{page needed|date=July 2012}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; death.  The outlaw was debarred from all civilized society. No one was allowed to give him food, shelter, or any other sort of support – to do so was to commit the crime of [[aiding and abetting]], and to be in danger of the ban oneself. A more recent concept of "[[Wanted poster#Dead or alive|wanted dead or alive]]" is similar, but implies that a trial is desired (namely if the wanted person is returned alive), whereas outlawry precludes a trial.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

An outlaw might be killed with impunity; and it was not only lawful but meritorious to kill a thief fleeing from justice — to do so was not [[Murder in English law|murder]]. A man who slew a thief was expected to declare the fact without delay, otherwise the dead man’s kindred might [[Compurgation|clear his name by their oath]] and require the slayer to pay weregild as for a true man.{{sfn|Pollock|Maitland|1968|p=53}}

By the rules of common law, a criminal outlaw did not need to be guilty of the crime for which he was an outlaw.  If a man was accused of a treason or [[felony]] but failed to appear in court to defend himself, he was deemed to be convicted of the said offence.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'' (30th ed., 1938) page 71&lt;/ref&gt; If he was accused of a [[misdemeanour]], then he was guilty of a serious contempt of court which was itself a capital crime.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In the context of [[criminal law]], outlawry faded out, not so much by legal changes as by the greater population density of the country, which made it harder for wanted fugitives to evade capture; and by the adoption of international [[extradition]] pacts.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} It was obsolete by the time the offence was abolished in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;''Archbold'' (30th ed., 1938) page 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Archbold'' (31st ed., 1943) page 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1938, section 12&lt;/ref&gt;. Outlawry was, however, a living practice as of 1855: in 1841, a William John Bankes, formerly a MP on several times 1810...1835, was outlawed by due process of law for absenting himself from trial for indecent exposure, and died in 1855 in Venice as an outlaw.

====Civil====
There was also a doctrine of civil outlawry.  Civil outlawry did not carry the sentence of capital punishment.  It was however imposed on defendants who fled or evaded justice when sued for civil actions like debts or torts.  The punishments for civil outlawry were nevertheless harsh, including confiscation of chattels (movable property) left behind by the outlaw.&lt;ref&gt;William Blackstone (1753), ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'', Book 3, Chapter XIX "Of Process"&lt;/ref&gt;

In the civil context, outlawry became obsolescent in [[civil procedure]] by reforms that no longer required summoned [[defendant]]s to appear and plead.  Still, the possibility of being declared an outlaw for derelictions of [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] duty continued to exist in English law until 1879 and, in [[Scots law]] until the late 1940s.  Since then, failure to find the defendant and serve process is usually interpreted in favour of the plaintiff, and harsh penalties for mere nonappearance (merely presumed flight to escape justice) no longer apply.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}&lt;!--For the whole paragraph--&gt;

[[File:Eric the Red.png|thumb|left|[[Erik the Red]] was outlawed by the Icelandic [[Althing]] for three years (so in about 982 he went [[viking]] and explored Greenland).]]
[[File:Ned kelly 1874.jpg|thumb|[[Ned Kelly]], with other members of his gang, were outlawed by the [[Parliament of Victoria|Parliament]] of the [[Australia]]n state of [[Victoria State|Victoria]] on 1 November 1878]]
Outlawry also existed in other ancient legal codes, such as the ancient [[Norsemen|Norse]] and [[Icelandic Commonwealth|Icelandic legal code]].

In early modern times, the term [[Vogelfrei]] and its cognates came to be used in Germany, the Low Countries and Scandinavia, referring to a person stripped of his civil rights being "free" for the taking like a bird.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt–Wiegand, Ruth (1998). "Vogelfrei". Handwörterbuch der Deutschen Rechtsgeschichte [Dictionary of the History of German Law]. 5: Straftheorie [Penal theory]. Berlin: Schmidt. pp. 930–932. {{ISBN|3-503-00015-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Germany and Slavic countries in 15th–19th centuries groups of outlaws composed from former prisoners, soldiers etc. became an important social phenomenon. They lived from robbery and their activity was often supported by local inhabitants from lower classes (as a form of a social people resistance against oppressive political and economic systems). The best known are [[Juraj Jánošík]] and [[Jakub Surovec]] in Slovakia, [[Oleksa Dovbush]] in Ukraine, [[Rózsa Sándor]] in Hungary, [[Schinderhannes]] and [[Hans Kohlhase]] in Germany etc.

The concept of outlawry was reintroduced to British law by several Australian colonial governments in the late 19th century to deal with the menace of [[bushranging]]. The [[Felons Apprehension Act (1865)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/sessionalview/sessional/act/1865-2a.pdf | author=New South Wales government website | title = Text of the Felons Apprehension Act (1865) |accessdate= 4 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[New South Wales]] provided that a judge could, upon proof of sufficiently notorious conduct, issue a special [[bench warrant]] requiring a person to submit themselves to police custody before a given date, or be declared an outlaw. An outlawed person could be apprehended "alive or dead" by any of the Queen's subjects, "whether a constable or not", and without "being accountable for using of any deadly weapon in aid of such apprehension." Similar provisions were passed in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.anzlhsejournal.auckland.ac.nz/pdfs_2005/Eburn.pdf | author = ANZLH E-Journal | title=
Outlawry in Colonial Australia: The Felons Apprehension Acts 1865-1899  |accessdate= 4 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the provisions of the New South Wales Felons Apprehension Act were not exercised after the end of the bushranging era, they remained on the statute book until 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.anzlhsejournal.auckland.ac.nz/pdfs_2005/Eburn.pdf | author = ANZLH E-Journal | title =
Outlawry in Colonial Australia: The Felons Apprehension Acts 1865-1899  |accessdate= 4 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Third Reich]] made extensive use of outlawry in the persecution of Jews or other persons deemed undesirable to the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shirer, William L. |year=2011|title=The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany|pages=233, 439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As political weapon==
[[File:Eastlake - Napoleon on the Bellerophon.jpg|thumb|[[Napoleon Bonaparte]] on [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|HMS ''Bellerophon'']] after his surrender to the British in 1815.]]
There have been many instances in military and/or political conflicts throughout History whereby one side declares the other as being "illegal", notorious cases being the use of [[Proscription]] in Republican Rome's civil wars.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}&lt;!--For the whole paragraph--&gt; In later times there was the notable case of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] whom the [[Congress of Vienna]], on 13 March 1815, [[s:Declaration at the Congress of Vienna|declared he had "deprived himself of the protection of the law"]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.lib.brown.edu/napoleon/time7.html Timeline: The Congress of Vienna, the Hundred Days, and Napoleon's Exile on St Helena], Center of Digital Initiatives, [[Brown University]] Library&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, the government of the [[First Spanish Republic]], unable to reduce the [[cantonalism|Cantonalist]] rebellion centered in [[Cartagena, Spain]], declared the Cartagena fleet  to be "[[piracy|piratic]]", which allowed any nation to prey on it.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Taking the opposite road, some outlaws became political leaders, such as [[Ethiopia]]'s Kassa Hailu who became Emperor [[Tewodros II of Ethiopia]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Popular usage==

{{further|Social bandits}}
Though the judgment of outlawry is now obsolete (even though it inspired the ''pro forma'' [[Outlawries Bill]] which is still to this day introduced in the [[British House of Commons]] during the [[State Opening of Parliament]]), romanticised outlaws became [[stock character]]s in several fictional settings.  This was particularly so in the United States, where outlaws were popular subjects of newspaper coverage and stories in the 19th century, and 20th century fiction and [[Western movie]]s.  Thus, "outlaw" is still commonly used to mean those violating the law&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary at 1255 (4th ed. 1951), citing ''Oliveros v. Henderson'', 116 S.C. 77, 106 S.E. 855, 859.&lt;/ref&gt; or, by extension, those living that lifestyle, whether actual criminals evading the law or those merely opposed to "law-and-order" notions of conformity and authority (such as the "[[outlaw country]]" music movement in the 1970s).

'''Law''' (''[[law|article link]]'') is the set of rules and principles (laws) by which a society is governed, through enforcement by governmental authorities.  Law is also the field which concerns the creation and administration of laws, and includes any and all [[Legal systems of the world|legal systems]].

== Nature of law ==
Law can be described as all of the following:

* [[Academic discipline]] &amp;ndash; body of knowledge given to - or received by - a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialise in.
** one of the [[humanities]] &amp;ndash; academic discipline that study the human condition, using methods that are primarily analytical, critical, or speculative, as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of the natural sciences.
* [[Fields of science|Field of science]]  &amp;ndash; widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature.  Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published.  There are many sociology-related scientific journals.
** [[Social science]]  &amp;ndash; field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society.
* [[System]] &amp;ndash; set of elements (often called 'components' instead) and relationships which are different from relationships of the set or its elements to other elements or sets.
** part of the [[legal system]] &amp;ndash; legal scholarship and practice shapes how law is interpreted and applied in societies

==Legal systems==
* [[List of national legal systems]]
* [[Common law]]
* [[Civil law (legal system)]]
* [[Religious law]]
** [[Bahá'í laws]]
** [[Biblical law]], in [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]]
** [[Canon law]], in Christianity
*** [[Canons of the Apostles]]
*** [[Canon law of the Anglican Communion]]
*** [[Canon law of the Catholic Church]]
****[[Canon (canon law)]] - a certain rule or norm of conduct or belief prescribed by the Catholic Church. The word "canon" comes from the Greek kanon, which in its original usage denoted a straight rod that was later the instrument used by architects and artificers as a measuring stick for making straight lines. 
****[[Custom (canon law)]] - the repeated and constant performance of certain acts for a defined period of time, which, with the approval of the competent legislator, thereby acquire the force of law. A custom is an unwritten law introduced by the continuous acts of the faithful with the consent of the legitimate legislator. 
****[[Decree (canon law)]] - an order or law made by a superior authority for the direction of others. 
****[[Dispensation (canon law)]] - the exemption from the immediate obligation of law in certain cases. Its object is to modify the hardship often arising from the rigorous application of general laws to particular cases, and its essence is to preserve the law by suspending its operation in such cases. 
****[[Interpretation (canon law)]] - canonists provide and obey rules for the interpretation and acceptation of words, in order that legislation is correctly understood and the extent of its obligation is determined. 
****[[Obrogation]] -  the enacting of a contrary law that is a revocation of a previous law. It may also be the partial cancellation or amendment of a law, decree, or legal regulation by the imposition of a newer one. 
****[[Promulgation (canon law)]] - the publication of a law by which it is made known publicly, and is required by canon law for the law to obtain legal effect.

'''Peer victimization''' is the experience among children of being a target of the [[aggressive]] behavior of other children, who are not siblings and not necessarily age-mates.&lt;ref name=twenty&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawker | first1 = David S.J. | last2 = Boulton | first2 = Michael J. | title = Twenty years' research on peer victimization and psychosocial maladjustment: a meta-analytic review of cross-sectional studies | journal = [[Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry]] | volume = 41 | issue = 4 | pages = 441–455 | doi = 10.1111/1469-7610.00629 | date = May 2000 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background/overview==
Mass interest in the issue of peer victimization arose during the 1990s due to media coverage of student [[suicide]]s, peer beatings, and [[school shootings]], notably [[Columbine High School massacre|the tragedy]] in [[Columbine, Colorado]].&lt;ref name=S&amp;T&amp;B&amp;D&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seeley | first1 = Ken | last2 = Tombari | first2 = Martin L. | last3 = Bennett | first3 = Laurie J. | last4 = Dunkle | first4 = Jason B. | title = Peer victimization in schools: a set of quantitative and qualitative studies of the connections among peer victimization, school engagement, truancy, school achievement, and other outcomes | journal = National Center for School Engagement | volume = 1 | pages = 13–46 | id = NCJ 234135 | date = July 2009 | url = https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=256074 | ref = harv }} [http://schoolengagement.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/PeerVictimizationinSchoolsAsetofQualitativeandQuantitativeStudies1.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; This led to an explosion of research attempting to assess [[bullying|bully]]-victim relationships and related players, what leads victims to experience negative outcomes and how widespread this problem was. Studies of peer victimization have also been conducted in the context of research investigating childhood relationships in general and how they are associated with school adjustment and achievement.

Research has proven the problematic nature of peer victimization, identifying many negative outcomes such as low [[self-esteem]], low school engagement, school avoidance, lower school achievement, [[learned helplessness]], and [[depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name="S&amp;T&amp;B&amp;D"/&gt; Peer victimization is especially prevalent and damaging in [[middle school]], as during this time children are defining themselves by creating [[self-schema]]s and establishing self-esteem, both which will impact their future adult life; for this reason, most of the research on peer victimization focuses on this age group. They are also more vulnerable to peer rejection because needs for belonging and intimacy may be especially strong during early adolescence, when children are working to solidify their peer groups.&lt;ref name =G&amp;M&gt;{{citation | last1 = Gottman | first1 = John M. | last2 = Mettetal | first2 = Gwendolyn | contribution = Speculations about social and affective development: friendship and acquaintanceship through adolescence | editor-last1 = Gottman | editor-first1 = John M. | editor-last2 = Parker | editor-first2 = Jeffrey G. | title = Conversations of friends: speculations on affective development | pages = 192–237 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location =  New York, New York | year = 1987 | isbn = 9780521263214 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} Retrieved from www.csa.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;{{cite book | last = Sullivan | first = Harry Stack | title = The interpersonal theory of psychiatry | publisher = Norton | location = New York | year = 2013 | origyear = 1953 | isbn = 9781136439292 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of victimization research adopts a [[social psychology]] perspective, investigating how different types of peer victimization affect the individual and the different negative outcomes that occur. Some experimenters are adopting the term social victimization in order to acknowledge that victimization can take both verbal and nonverbal forms or be direct or indirect. They mostly focus on the types of victimization that can occur from multiple sources in a particular environment. [[Personality psychology|Personality psychologists]] look at individual differences and effects in victims. They may also study individuals in a social context, determining which are more likely to be victimized, such as those who are socially withdrawn.

With the development of technology and the widespread access it gives to children and teenagers, peer victimization has become more prevalent through the Internet and cell phones than in years past.&lt;ref name=S&amp;O&amp;S&amp;C&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schneider | first1 = Shari Kessel | last2 = O'Donnell | first2 = Lydia | last3 = Stueve | first3 = Ann | last4 = Coulter | first4 = Robert W.S. | title = Cyberbullying, school bullying, and psychological distress: a regional census of high school students | journal = [[American Journal of Public Health]] | volume = 102 | issue = 1 | pages = 171–177 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.2011.300308 | pmc = 3490574 | date = January 2012 | ref = harv | pmid=22095343}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of victimization called [[cyberbullying]] has a potential for a much wider audience than traditional face-to-face victimization.&lt;ref name="S&amp;O&amp;S&amp;C"/&gt; It is also easier to hide from parents and teachers. Studies have found that because this form of victimization is done through the anonymity of the Internet or text messaging, bullies feel more comfortable being crueler to the victim.&lt;ref name=C&amp;C&amp;L&amp;M&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chesney | first1 = Thomas | last2 = Coyne | first2 = Iain | last3 = Logan | first3 = Brian | last4 = Madden | first4 = Neil | title = Griefing in virtual worlds: causes, casualties and coping strategies | journal = [[Information Systems Journal]] | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 525–548 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2575.2009.00330.x | date = November 2009 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without face-to-face communication, social standards become less important and behavior becomes less inhibited.&lt;ref name="C&amp;C&amp;L&amp;M"/&gt;

==Major theoretical approaches==

===Operational definitions===
Originally, researchers focused on overt forms of [[victimization]], which were categorized as either physical or verbal.&lt;ref name=Storch&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Storch | first1 = Eric A. | last2 = Masia-Warner | first2 = Carrie | last3 = Crisp | first3 = Heather | last4 = Klein | first4 = Rachel G. | title = Peer victimization and social anxiety in adolescence: a prospective study | journal = Aggressive Behavior | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 437–452 | doi = 10.1002/ab.20093 | date = October 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ab.10047 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, researchers such as [[Nicki R. Crick]] argued for the existence of a more covert form of victimization which she observed primarily among females that she called [[Relational aggression|relational victimization]], during which a child’s social relationships and social standing are attacked via methods such as peer exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Crick | first = Nicki R. (director) | title = Relational and overt aggression, peer victimization, social information processing, and gender | location = Nashville | publisher = Vanderbilt University | date = February 24, 2011 }} Lecture conducted from Vanderbilt University, Nashville.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, victimization is largely operationally defined as either covert/relational victimization or overt/physical victimization, in which a child is threatened with or dealt corporeal damage.&lt;ref name=C&amp;M&amp;D&amp;Y&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cole | first1 = David A. | last2 = Maxwell | first2 = Melissa A. | last3 = Dukewich | first3 = Tammy L. | last4 = Yosick | first4 = Rachel | title = Targeted peer victimization and the construction of positive and negative self-cognitions: connections to depressive symptoms in children | journal = Journal of Clinical Child &amp; Adolescent Psychology | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 421–435 | doi = 10.1080/15374411003691776 | pmid = 20419582 | date = April 2010 | ref = harv | pmc = 4300522 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research approaches and theories===
The study of peer victimization draws from two major strands of research as identified by Seely, Tombari, Bennett &amp; Dunkle (2009) &lt;ref name="S&amp;T&amp;B&amp;D"/&gt; called the "[[bullying]] strand" and the "peer relationship strand." The victimization aspect of the "bullying strand" focuses on what leads victims to disengage from school and suffer from damaging negative outcomes while others adjust. The peer relationship strand is more quantitatively oriented, studying fundamental factors related to peer victimization and the negative outcomes, paying special attention to what factors mediate the relationship between them. Interest in peer victimization in psychological research has been fairly recent, and therefore it appears that most researchers have drawn from other areas of study and contemporary applied theories to the context of peer victimization.

The areas of the bullying strand that specifically pertain to peer victimization are studies of victimization prevalence, victims’ home environment, and effects of victimization in schools . Researchers started by determining the prevalence of peer victimization believing this would allow for the comparison of the problem over time, populations and after interventions.&lt;ref name="S&amp;T&amp;B&amp;D"/&gt;&lt;ref name=S&amp;O&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solberg | first1 = Mona E. | last2 = Olweus | first2 = Dan | title = Prevalence estimation of school bullying with the Olweus Bully/Victim questionnaire | journal = Aggressive Behavior | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 239–268 | doi = 10.1002/ab.10047 | date = June 2003 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prevalence research has been conducted in many different countries, cultures and classroom contexts. Studies utilize a variety of different methods such as self-report questionnaires, peer nominations, and teacher nominations have been used.&lt;ref name=C&amp;M&amp;D&amp;Y /&gt; Unfortunately, results show that in many contexts, the percentage of children that are victimized have fallen in a range between 5-90%&lt;ref name=R&amp;G&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roland | first1 = Erling | last2 = Galloway | first2 = David | title = Professional cultures in schools with high and low rates of bullying | journal = School Effectiveness and School Improvement: An International Journal of Research, Policy and Practice | volume = 15 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 241–260 | doi = 10.1080/09243450512331383202 | date = September 2004 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=E&amp;A&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Espelage | first1 = Dorothy L. | last2 = Asidao | first2 = Christine S. | title = Conversations with middle school students about bullying and victimization: Should we be concerned? | journal = [[Journal of Aggression, Maltreatment &amp; Trauma|Journal of Emotional Abuse]] | volume = 2 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 49–62 | doi = 10.1300/J135v02n02_04 | date = March 2001 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying strand research also focuses on the type of families that those who are victimized come from and what types of parenting styles they experienced&lt;ref name="S&amp;T&amp;B&amp;D"/&gt; Finally, a limited number of studies today focus on impacts of being bullied in a school setting and how it relates to achievement, truancy, and drop-out.&lt;ref name="S&amp;T&amp;B&amp;D"/&gt;

Studies examining peer victimization have also been conducted in the context of a body of research interested in peer relationships and how they affect educational performance and adjustment; this is identified as the "peer relationship strand." In the 1970s and 1980s, Steven Asher identified one form of a relationship—peer victimization—as a predictor of educational maladjustment. Later, a new perspective formed that considered peer victimization as a type of relationship existing on a continuum of relationship roles from healthy relations to detrimental ones instead of focusing on specific bully-victim relationships. Experimenters have also been interested in how early victimization effects individuals over time, focusing on school-related outcomes. Studies have largely worked to identify underlying factors that mediate negative outcomes.

To account for difference in the severity of negative outcomes as a result of peer victimization, researchers have utilized theories of implicit peer relationships. In order to understand the social world, individuals create implicit theories about their social interactions&lt;ref name =D&amp;L&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dweck | first1 = Carol S. | last2 = Leggett | first2 = Ellen L. | title = A social-cognitive approach to motivation and personality | journal = [[Psychological Review]] | volume = 95 | issue = 2 | pages = 256–273 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.95.2.256 | date = April 1988 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.583.9142 }} [https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e-reserves/regenstein/timp/232-2965.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=M&amp;D&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Molden | first1 = Daniel C. | last2 = Dweck | first2 = Carol S. | title = Finding "meaning" in psychology: a lay theories approach to self-regulation, social perception, and social development | journal = [[American Psychologist]] | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 192–203 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.61.3.192 | pmid = 16594836 | date = April 2006 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.319.5686 }} [https://psychology.stanford.edu/sites/all/files/Finding%20%22meaning%22%20in%20Psychology.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; A major determinant of how a person handles social evaluation is the degree to which they ascribe entity theories of personality, believing it their attributes are stable and unalterable or incremental theories of personality, viewing attributes as pliable able to be augmented&lt;ref name=D&amp;H&amp;C&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dweck | first1 = Carol S. | last2 = Hong | first2 = Ying yi | last3 = Chiu | first3 = Chi yue | title = Implicit theories: Individual differences in the likelihood and meaning of dispositional inference | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 19 | issue = 5 | pages = 644–656 | doi = 10.1177/0146167293195015 | date = October 1993 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who adopt entity theories of personality often pursue performance oriented goals, seeking to accrue positive and avoid negative evaluations of their competence. Since they view their attributes as constant, it is vital that they are desirable in order for them to maintain a positive self-image. People who hold incremental theories of personality endeavor towards mastery-oriented goals, focusing on learning and cultivating competence since as they believe their attributes are malleable. Accordingly, they should feel less threatened by others’ evaluations of their competence. When thinking about self-evaluation, implicit theories should affect the degree to which children base their self appraisals on peer judgements, determining whether negative social interactions undermine their well-being.

In regards to behavioral reactions to victimization, research has identified two categories of characteristic responses.&lt;ref name=Schwartz&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schwartz | first1 = David | last2 = McFadyen-Ketchum | first2 = Steven A. | last3 = Dodge | first3 = Kenneth A. | last4 = Pettit | first4 = Greg S. | last5 = Bates | first5 = John E. | title = Peer group victimization as a predictor of children's behavior problems at home and in school | journal = [[Development and Psychopathology]] | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 87–99 | pmid = 9524809 | date = March 1998 | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=43521&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S095457949800131X | ref = harv | doi=10.1017/s095457949800131x}}&lt;/ref&gt; One contains externalizing behaviors such as aggression, disruptive, antisocial, and acting out behaviors (Achenbach, 1966). Another constitutes internalizing behaviors like inhibited, anxious, or heightened withdrawal.&lt;ref name=A&amp;E&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Achenbach | first1 = Thomas M. | last2 = Edelbrock | first2 = Craig S. | title = The classification of child psychopathology: A review and analysis of empirical efforts | journal = [[Psychological Bulletin]] | volume = 85 | issue = 6 | pages = 1275–1301 | pmid = 366649 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.85.6.1275 | date = November 1978 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawker and Boulton (2001) have used the [[rank theory of depression]] to explain the relationship between forms of victimization and types of maladjustment.&lt;ref name=H&amp;B&gt;{{citation | last1 = Hawker | first1 = David S.J. | last2 = Boulton | first2 = Michael J. | contribution =  Subtypes of peer harassment and their correlates: A social dominance perspective | editor-last1 = Juvonen | editor-first1 = Jaana | editor-last2 = Graham | editor-first2 = Sandra | title = Peer harassment in school: the plight of the vulnerable and victimized | pages = 378–397 | publisher = Guilford Press | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9781572306271 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the rank theory, internalizing problems such as depression are linked to a sense of powerlessness and of not belonging. Those who are physically victimized suffer from low resource-holding potential, which works in part to delineate social power in peer groups, while relational victimization directly affects children’s sense of belonging instead. In addition, according to [[social rank theory]], jeopardization of one’s feeling of belonging stemming from relational victimization should play a greater part in perpetuating depression than that of resource-holding potential as in physical victimization. Therefore, depression should correlate more strongly with relational victimization as opposed to physical victimization.

Currently, researchers have become interested in the direction of the relationship between peer victimization and psychosocial adjustment.&lt;ref name=Storch /&gt; Many believe that the relation acts in a single direction: either peer victimization leads to maladjustment, or the relationship is reversed&lt;ref name=Bond&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bond | first1 = Lyndal | last2 = Carlin | first2 = John B. | last3 = Thomas | first3 = Lyndal | last4 = Rubin | first4 = Kerryn | last5 = Patton | first5 = George | title = Does bullying cause emotional problems?

==Empirical findings==
A study by Cole, Maxwell, Dukewich &amp; Yosick examined how physical and relational Targeted Peer Victimization (TPV) victimization were related and measured their effects on different types of positive and negative cognitions. It was hypothesized that the link between peer victimization and depression was mediated by the creation of negative self-schemas.&lt;ref name=C&amp;M&amp;D&amp;Y /&gt; The study found gender differences in victimization, as Relational TPV was more common for girls and physical TPV was more common for boys. Also, children who were severely victimized exhibited less positive self-cognitions and more negative self-cognitions as well as more depressive symptoms. Yet when they controlled for the effects of relational TPV, the effects of physical TPV disappeared; it appears that relational TPV is more strongly associated with these outcomes and an investigation of physical TPV alone would not yield the same associations. Positive and negative self-cognitions were found to mediate the effect of relational victimization to symptoms of depression.

Another study by Sinclair (2011) examined the relationship between physical and relational peer victimization with negative and positive self-cognitions as well. It was found that both types of victimization led to increases in negative self-cognitions and decreases in positive self-cognitions, though the effects were more pronounced when a child experienced relational victimization.&lt;ref name=Sinclair&gt;{{cite thesis |degree= M.Sc. |last= Sinclair |first= Keneisha Rachelle |date= March 2011 |title= Impact of physical and relational victimization on self-cognitions in children and adolescents |publisher= [[Vanderbilt University]] | url = http://etd.library.vanderbilt.edu/available/etd-03222011-154741/ | oclc = 710983846 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While girls were found experienced more relational victimization than boys did and boys experienced more physical victimization than girls did, the negative effects of victimization on self-cognitions was stronger in boys. This may be due to one of their findings that boys are less likely to seek adult social support than girls are. A study conducted by Schmidt and Bagwell used surveys to gauge the reactions of victimization and their self evaluated friendships. The study found that girls benefited significantly from having stronger, reliable peer friendships in coping with victimization, while boys did not.&lt;ref name=S&amp;D&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidt | first1 = Michelle B. | last2 = Bagwell | first2 = Catherine L. | title = The protective role of friendhsips in overtly and relationally victimized boys and girls | journal = Merrill-Palmer Quarterly | volume = 53 | issue = 3 | pages = 439–460 | date = July 2007 | jstor = 23096128 | ref = harv | doi=10.1353/mpq.2007.0021}} [http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/mpq/vol53/iss3/7/ Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Snyder and colleagues studied 266 Kindergarten and first grade children in cases of observed victimization at school.

Research seems to show that there is drastic difference in the way both genders (at least in children) respond to victimization from peers. Current studies on children indicate that regardless of observational method (researcher direct observation or survey results given to the children) there is a marked effect of victimization, especially from peers. The magnitude of the effect on their behavior and mental health is heavily correlated with the situation of the victimization and the child’s social environment at the time.

Schwartz et al. (1998) investigated the role of victimization in the development of children’s behavior problems, focusing on both internalizing and externalizing problems. They hypothesized that higher levels of victimization would lead to increased level of behavioral problems.&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt; Child behavior was reported by teachers and parents, measured using the [[Child Behavior Checklist]], and peer victimization was measured using peer nomination. Indeed, they found that peer victimization in middle childhood was associated with behavioral maladjustment on both a concurrent and prospective basis. Additionally, externalizing behaviors were more strongly associated with victimization than were internalizing behaviors.

Seals &amp; Young (2003) investigated relationships between bullying and victimization with gender, grade level, ethnicity, self-esteem, and depression. Results showed that victims reported lower levels of self-esteem than did bullies and nonbullies/nonvictims. Additionally, victims had the highest depression scores as compared to bullies and nonbullies/nonvictims.&lt;ref name=S&amp;Y&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seals | first1 = Dorothy | last2 = Young | first2 = Jerry | title = Bullying and victimization: prevalence and relationship to gender, grade level, ethnicity, self-esteem, and depression | journal = [[Adolescence (magazine)|Adolescence]] | volume = 38 | issue = 152 | pages = 735–747 | pmid = 15053498 | date = Winter 2003 | url = https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-114740934/bullying-and-victimization-prevalence-and-relationship | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research progress has also been made into recent mediums of victimization and bullying, notably online victimization. A study conducted by Mitchell ''et al.'' in 2007 collected data from over 2000 adolescents through telephone interviews. The most surprising finding was that those who reported being subject to online victimization in the past year are 96% likely to also report being subject to physical (offline) victimization.&lt;ref name=Mitchell&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mitchell | first1 = Kimberly J. | last2 = Ybarra | first2 = Michele | last3 = Finkelhor | first3 = David | title = The relative importance of online victimization in understanding depression, delinquency, and substance use | journal = [[Child Maltreatment (journal)|Child Maltreatment]] | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 314–324 | doi = 10.1177/1077559507305996 | pmid = 17954938 | date = November 2007 | ref = harv }} [http://www.unh.edu/ccrc/pdf/CV132.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Another study conducted with over 3000 youth in the 5th, 8th and 11th grades using surveys concluded that Internet victimization shares common causal pathways with physical and verbal victimization.&lt;ref name=W&amp;G&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = Kirk R. | last2 = Guerra | first2 = Nancy G. | title = Prevalence and predictors of internet bullying | journal = [[Journal of Adolescent Health]] | volume = 41 | issue = 6 | pages = S14–S21 | doi = 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2007.08.018 | pmid = 18047941 | date = December 2007 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
An interest in aspects of bullying sprouted in the 1990s due to media coverage of student suicides, peer beatings, and school shootings.&lt;ref name="S&amp;T&amp;B&amp;D"/&gt; Yet such negative outcomes are rare.

One of the most well-known cases concerning the effects of peer victimization is the [[Columbine High School massacre]] of 1999 in [[Columbine, Colorado|Columbine]], [[Colorado]], [[United States]]. The perpetrators of this incident, [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]], murdered 12 students and 1 teacher and also injured 21 other students before committing suicide. After the tragedy, details emerged showing that Harris and Klebold had been bullied for years by classmates, with little to no intervention by school officials. Though such events are not frequent, they do alarming damage.

There has been a recent surge in the number of incidents regarding [[Gay bashing|peer victimization and homosexuality]]. Specifically, the news has recently highlighted many cases of [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) students who have committed suicide in response to peer victimization. One such incident is the case of 18-year-old [[Suicide of Tyler Clementi|Tyler Clementi]], a Rutgers University student who was secretly videotaped by his roommate, [[Dharun Ravi]], having sexual intercourse with another man. Ravi and another hallmate also streamed the video of the sexual encounter online. After finding out about this, Clementi jumped off of the [[George Washington Bridge]] to his death. Reports claim that Clementi had filed a complaint about his roommate having previously violating his privacy in the same manner, but no action had been taken to replace Clementi’s roommate.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Research demonstrates that lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) students are highly likely to be victimized.&lt;ref name=D&amp;P&amp;H&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = D'Augelli | first1 = Anthony R. | last2 = Pilkington | first2 = Neil W. | last3 = Hershberger | first3 = Scott L. | title = Incidence and mental health impact of sexual orientation victimization of lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths in high school | journal = [[School Psychology Quarterly]] | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 148–167 | doi = 10.1521/scpq.17.2.148.20854 | date = Summer 2002 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over half of LGB participants were verbally abused when they were in high school, and 11% were physically assaulted in a study by D’Augelli et al. (2002). Negative outcomes such as mental health problems and poor school performance have been associated with high incidences of victimization of LGB students.&lt;ref name=H&amp;D&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hershberger | first1 = Scott L. | last2 = D'Augelli | first2 = Anthony R. | title = The impact of victimization on the mental health and suicidality of lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths | journal = Developmental Psychology, Special Issue: Sexual Orientation and Human Development | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 65–74 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.31.1.65 | date = January 1995 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=M&amp;B&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Murdock | first1 = Tamera B. | last2 = Bolch | first2 = Megan B. | title = Risk and protective factors for poor school adjustment in lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) high school youth: Variable and person-centered analyses | journal = [[Psychology in the Schools]] | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 159–172 | doi = 10.1002/pits.20054 | date = February 2005 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently research in this area seems to be progressing from the investigation of the extent and effects of LGB victimization to the specific factors associated with victimization and negative outcomes.

A study by Goodenow et al. (2006) was one of the first to examine which school-related factors were associated with lower rates of victimization and suicidality in this population. School related factors included the presence of LGB support groups and staff support as well as other school characteristics like student-to-teacher ratio.&lt;ref name=Goodenow&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Goodenow | first1 = Carol | last2 = Szalacha | first2 = Laura | last3 = Westheimer | first3 = Kim | title = School support groups, other school factors, and the safety of sexual minority adolescents | journal = [[Psychology in the Schools]] | volume = 43 | issue = 5 | pages = 573–589 | doi = 10.1002/pits.20173 | date = May 2006 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that LGB support groups were associated with both low victimization and suicidality among LGB students. Results indicated that the existence of LGB support groups may have led to a decrease in suicidality through decreasing incidence of peer victimization as the association between LGB support groups and suicidality disappeared when victimization was controlled for. Yet as this study examined correlations, causality cannot be assumed. Student courts were associated with less victimization, and antibullying policies were associated with less suicidality, even when the effects of victimization and perceived support were taken into account. Lower levels of victimization and suicidality of LGB students was also associated with large school size and urban locale. These school-related factors have traditionally been associated with a generally safer school environment, yet it seems that factors that increase safety for the general population may not increase safety for LGB students.

A study by Kosciw et al. (2009) investigated how school related factors, community factors (such as adult education and income level), and locational factors (on a national level) were associated with victimization of LGB students.&lt;ref name=Kosciw&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kosciw | first1 = Joseph G. | last2 = Greytak | first2 = Emily A. | last3 = Diaz | first3 = Elizabeth M. | title = Who, what, where, when, and why: demographic and ecological factors contributing to hostile school climate for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth | journal = Journal of Youth and Adolescence | volume = 38 | issue = 7 | pages = 976–988 | doi = 10.1007/s10964-009-9412-1 | date = August 2009 | ref = harv | pmid=19636740}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results showed that community factors were the most significantly related to victimization and many regional-level as well as school-related factors were not found to be significant once these factors were taken into account. Increased reports of victimization due to gender expression were found in communities with higher poverty levels compared to affluent communities. Youth from communities with higher as opposed to lower proportions of adults with college degrees also reported less victimization. In accordance with the Goodenow study, It was also found that youth from urban communities were less likely to be victimized than those from rural communities.

==Applications==
The results of these studies show a strong need for intervention programs, specifically in-school programs. Though most schools punish bullying through disciplinary action, the frequency of bullying and victimization remains high. Thus, newer, more effective strategies must be implemented. Such programs should not only focus on punishing the bully, but should also focus on the victim. Victims should be taught to use healthier coping strategies instead of internalizing and externalizing their feelings. One intervention program focuses on bullying prevention in positive behavior support (BP-PBS). BP-PBS is designed to, in a series of steps, teach students how to treat each other respectfully, as well as teach ways to minimize social reinforcement of bullying behaviors in order to improve the school atmosphere.

Ross and Horner (2009) investigated the effectiveness of this program across three elementary schools in Oregon by focusing on 6 students.&lt;ref name=R&amp;H&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ross | first1 = Scott W. | last2 = Horner | first2 = Robert H. | editor-last1 = Higbee Action | editor-first1 = Thomas | title = Bully prevention in positive behavior support | journal = [[Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis]] | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 747–759 | doi = 10.1901/jaba.2009.42-747 | date = Winter 2009 | ref = harv | pmid=20514181 | pmc=2791686}} Also see: [https://www.pbis.org/common/cms/files/pbisresources/bullyprevention_ES.pdf handbook.]&lt;/ref&gt; They collected baseline data for the frequency of bullying as well as victim and bystander responses and then implemented the program across these school for approximately 8–12 weeks. Results showed that the frequency of bullying behaviors was significantly reduced among these students and that there was also a significant increase in more appropriate responses from victims and bystanders. Thus, interventions like BP-PBS may be effective in alleviating the problem of bullying and victimization in schools. To really test this, such programs should be put into effect nationally. Effective counseling are also a necessary component of dealing with peer victimization in schools. The most important step to successful counseling is identifying the children who are being victimized. While physical victimization can be easily noticed, for example by the presence of bruises and scratches, relational victimization is harder to detect. It is difficult to realize what children are being ostracized or ridiculed, especially if the student doesn’t vocalize this treatment. Disciplining relational victimization is also a difficult task. Whereas physical victimization is usually punished with a school suspension, for example, it would seem ridiculous to respond to relational victimization with the same punishment. Because of such discrepancies, it is important to create and implement effective strategies for dealing with relational victimization.

==Trivia==
In a study evaluating the effectiveness of this program, Bauer, Lozano, &amp; Rivara (2007) found that the Olweus program had "mixed positive effects"; specifically, there was a 28% decrease in relational victimization and a 37% decrease in physical victimization.&lt;ref name=B&amp;L&amp;R&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bauer | first1 = Nerissa S. | last2 = Lozano | first2 = Paula | last3 = Rivara | first3 = Frederick P. | title = The effectiveness of the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program in public middle schools: a controlled trial | journal = [[Journal of Adolescent Health]] | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 266–274 | doi = 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2006.10.005 | pmid = 17321428 | date = December 2007 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Policy Debate}}
'''Policy debate''' is a form of [[debate#competitive debate|debate competition]]&lt;!-- took away the clarify me because the link now explains better --&gt; in which teams of two advocate for and against a resolution that typically calls for policy change by the United States federal government. It is also referred to as '''cross-examination debate''' (sometimes shortened to '''Cross-X''', '''CX''', '''Cross-ex''', or '''C-X''') because of the 3-minute questioning period following each [[constructive speech]]. Affirmative teams generally present a ''plan'' as a proposal for implementation of the resolution.

High school policy debate is sponsored by various organizations including the [[National Speech and Debate Association]], [[National Association of Urban Debate Leagues]], [[Catholic Forensic League]], [[Stoa USA]], and the [[National Christian Forensics and Communications Association]], as well as many other regional speech organizations. Collegiate policy debates are generally competed under the guidelines of [[National Debate Tournament]] (NDT) and the [[Cross Examination Debate Association]] (CEDA), which have been joined at the collegiate level. A one-person policy format is sanctioned by the [[National Forensic Association]] (NFA) on the collegiate level as well.

==History==
Academic debate had its origins in intracollegiate debating societies, in which students would engage in (often public) debates against their classmates. [[Wake Forest University]]'s debate program claims to have its origins in student literary societies founded on campus in the mid-1830s, which first presented joint "orations" in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abbreviated Timeline: Wake Debate|url=http://groups.wfu.edu/debate/HistoryPages/AbbreviatedTimeline.html|publisher=Wake Forest University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many debating societies that were founded at least as early as the mid-nineteenth century are still active today, though they have generally shifted their focus to intercollegiate competitive debate. In addition to Wake Forest, the debate society at [[Northwestern University]] dates to 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debate.northwestern.edu |title=Debate Society, School of Communication, Northwestern University |publisher=Debate.northwestern.edu |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boston College]]'s Fulton Debating Society, which was founded in 1868, continues to stage an annual public "Fulton Prize Debate" between teams of its own students after the intercollegiate debate season has ended. Other universities continue similar traditions.

Intercollegiate debates have been held since at least as early as the 1890s. Historical records indicate that debates between teams from [[Wake Forest University]] and Trinity College (later [[Duke University]]) occurred beginning in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Century of Intercollegiate Debate|url=http://groups.wfu.edu/debate/HistoryPages/Intercollegiatedebate.html|publisher=Wake Forest University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a debate between students from Boston College and [[Georgetown University]] occurred on May 1, 1895, in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Donovan|first=Charles F.|title=Debate at Boston College: People, Places, Traditions|date=November 1991|publisher=Boston College, Office of the University Historian|url=http://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/schools/cas_sites/communication/pdf/Donovan-Debate-history.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Whitman College]] debated [[Washington State University]], [[Willamette University]], and the [[University of Idaho]] in the late 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cat.sckans.edu/frederick_debate/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051201083247/http://cat.sckans.edu/frederick_debate/history.htm |archivedate=2005-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Southwestern claims that the first debate held on its campus was between Southwestern and Fairmount College (which eventually became [[Wichita State University]]) but that debate could not have occurred prior to 1895, the year Fairmount College began classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webs.wichita.edu/?u=aboutwsu&amp;p=/wsu_history_long/ |title=ABOUT WSU - Wichita State University |publisher=Webs.wichita.edu |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1970s, structured rules for lengths of speeches developed. Each side (affirmative and negative) was afforded two opening "constructive" speeches, and two closing [[Rebuttal speech|"rebuttal" speeches]], for a total of eight speeches per debate. Each speaker was cross-examined by an opponent for a period following his or her constructive speech. Traditionally rebuttals were half the length of constructives, but when a style of faster delivery speed became more standard in the late 1980s this time structure became problematic. Wake Forest University introduced reformed speech times in both its college (9‑6 instead of 10‑5) and high school (8‑5 instead of 8‑4) tournaments, which spread rapidly to become the new [[de facto]] standards.

In 2014, debaters Ameena Ruffin and Korey Johnson made history by being the first black women to win the Cross Examination Debate Association tournament, which is the largest college debate tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Meet The First Black Women to Win a National Debate Conference|url = http://www.essence.com/2014/08/04/meet-first-black-women-win-national-debate-conference|website = Essence.com|access-date = 2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and delivery==

===Speed===
{{main|Spreading (debate)}}

Policy debaters' speed of delivery will vary from league to league and tournament to tournament. In many tournaments, debaters will speak very quickly in order to read as much evidence and make as many arguments as possible within the time-constrained speech. Speed reading or spreading is normal at the majority of national circuit policy debate tournaments.

Some feel that the rapid-fire delivery makes debate harder to understand for the lay person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kang|first=Jay|title=High School Debate at 350 WPM|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2012/01/ff_debateteam/|publisher=Wired|accessdate=27 March 2012|date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rapid delivery is encouraged by those who believe that increased quantity and diversity of argumentation makes debates more educational. Others, citing scientific studies, claim that learning to speak faster also increases short- and long-term memory{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}. A slower style is preferred by those who want debates to be understandable to lay people and those who claim that the pedagogical purpose of the activity is to train rhetorical skills. This is often a argument made by those who oppose in-round spreading - that the use of incomprehensible speeds makes debate less appealing to lay people. Many further claim that the increased speed encourages debaters to make several poor arguments, as opposed to a few high-quality ones. Most debaters will vary their rate of delivery depending upon the judge's preferences.

===Flowing===
{{Main|Flow (policy debate)}}
Debaters utilize a specialized form of note taking, called ''flowing'', to keep track of the arguments presented during a debate. Conventionally, debater's flowing is divided into separate ''flows'' for each different argument in the debate round ([[kritik]]s, [[Disadvantage|disads]], [[Topicality (policy debate)|topicalities]], case, etc.). There are multiple methods of flowing but the most common style incorporates columns of arguments made in a given speech which allows the debater to match the next speaker's responses up with the original arguments. Certain shorthands for commonly used words are used to keep up with the rapid rate of delivery. The abbreviations or stand-in symbols vary between debaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheshire|first=David|title=25 Tips for Taking a Better Flowsheet|journal=Rostrum|year=2000|url=http://debate.uvm.edu/NFL/rostrumlib/CheshierNov00.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:laptopflowing.jpg|thumb|200px|Judges at the 2007 [[NDT]] using a combination of laptops, quills, and [[papyrus]]]] --&gt;Flowing on a laptop has become more and more popular among high school and college debaters, despite the reservations of certain schools, tournaments, and judges. Some debaters use a basic computer spreadsheet; others use specialized flowing templates, which includes embedded shortcut keys for the most common formatting needs.

==Theory==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009|}}

Although there are many accepted standards in policy debate, there is no written formulation of rules. Sometimes debaters will in fact debate about how policy debate should work. These arguments are known as "theory arguments", and they are most often brought up when one team believes the actions of the other team are unfair and therefore warrant a loss. In more recent years, however, theory arguments have not been nearly as present in the Novice level as before.

===Burdens of the affirmative===

When the Affirmative team presents a plan, they take upon themselves the Burden of Proof to prove that their plan should be adopted. They must prove that their plan is an example of the resolution, and they must prove that the plan is a good idea. The Affirmative traditionally must uphold this burden using evidence from published sources, to avoid ridiculous cases.

====Stock issues====
{{Main|Stock issues}}
One traditional way to judge policy debate states that the affirmative team must win certain issues, called the '''stock issues'''. They are generally interpreted to be as follows:
* '''Disadvantages'''
How many negative disadvantages will the plan have? Will its disadvantages outweigh its advantages?
* '''Solvency'''
Will the plan solve the harms and can it even happen in the real world? How much of an impact will the plan have?
* '''Harms'''
What is the problem in the status quo to justify implementation of the plan? Is the plan important enough to even warrant consideration or make a difference?
* '''Inherency'''
Is the affirmative's plan happening already, and if not, why?
* '''[[Topicality (policy debate)|Topicality]]'''
Is the plan an example of the resolution? Does the affirmative team's proposed policy comply with the wording of the resolution?

The "stock issues" are also commonly described as Significance, Harms, Inherency, Topicality, and Solvency. The "stock issues" are then taught collectively as "The S.H.I.T.S." . Stock issues are taught extensively to novice debaters, but typically become less relevant as debaters move into more complex and less traditional arguments. Stock issues are strongly associated with traditional policy debate, and are typically stressed in advanced debates only if the judge is known to have traditionalist preferences. In some places (notably the West Coast), there is the additional stock issue of disadvantages; or a 'bad thing' that may occur as a result of passing the plan.

==Advantages and disadvantages==

Most affirmative teams today generally frame their case around advantages, which are good effects of their plan. The negative team will often present disadvantages which contend that the affirmative plan causes undesirable consequences. In an attempt to make sure that their advantages/disadvantages outweigh those of the other team, debaters often present extreme scenarios such as the [[Human extinction|extinction of the human race]] or a [[Nuclear warfare|global nuclear war]].

===Negation theory===
Negation Theory contends that the [[negative (policy debate)|negative]] need only negate the [[affirmative (policy debate)|affirmative]] instead of having to negate the [[resolution (policy debate)|resolution]]. The acceptance of negation theory allows negative teams to run arguments such as topical counter plans that may affirm the resolution but still negate the affirmative's specific plan.

===Negative strategy===
After the affirmative presents its case, the negative can attack the case with many different arguments, which include:
* Topicality: The Negative will attempt to argue that the Affirmative team does not fall under the rubric of the resolution and should be rejected immediately regardless of the merits or advantages of the plan. This is a type of "meta-debate" argument, as both sides then spend time defining various words or phrases in the resolution, laying down standards for why their definition(s) or interpretation(s) is superior. Most yearly topics have at least one or two commonly run Affirmative cases that are only arguably topical, so Topicality is often justified as a check or deterrent on and against such plans, which usually have quite strategic components. If run correctly, they are the strongest arguments against case.
* [[Disadvantage]]s: The negative can claim that there are disadvantages, or adverse effects of the plan, which outweigh any advantages claimed. In order to outweigh any positive effects of the affirmative case, impacts must be arguably "larger" than those of the opposing team. The negative must say what is good now, and how the affirmative's plan causes the impact of their disadvantage.
* [[Counterplan]]s: The negative can present a counter solution to the affirmative case's problem which does not have to affirm the resolution (The negative does not have to be topical in making a counterplan). This is generally accompanied by on-case arguments that the affirmative's plan does not solve, as well as disadvantages that link to the affirmative case but not the counterplan. Counterplans narrow down the on-case arguments to: advantages the counterplan can not borrow, the inherency, and the solvency. Upon the negative running a counterplan, most debates boil down to the solvency of the affirmative case, and the disadvantages. Counterplans must be competitive with the plan. This means that the counterplan must either be mutually exclusive with the affirmative (for example, one cannot both increase oil production (a hypothetical plan) and decrease oil production (a hypothetical counterplan) or be undesirable in conjunction with the plan (the negative must win that the inclusion of the plan would cause some form of harm that the counterplan alone would avoid).
* [[Kritik]]s: The negative can claim that the affirmative is guilty of a certain mindset or assumption that should be grounds for rejection or a different mutually exclusive alternative to the Affirmatives plan. Kritiks are sometimes a reason to reject the entire affirmative advocacy without evaluating its policy; other times, kritiks can be evaluated within the same framework for evaluation as the affirmative case. Examples of some areas of literature for kritiks include [[biopower]], [[racism]], [[statism|centralized government]], and [[anthropocentrism]]. Kritiks arose in the early 1990s, with the first kritiks based in [[deconstructionist]] philosophy about the intrinsic ambiguity of language and were championed by debaters Shane Stafford and Bill Shanahan. Kritiks today have evolved to sometimes include the affirmative advocacy within their alternatives. These kritiks argue that the ontological or epistemological assumptions behind the affirmative are flawed and ought to be rejected, but the plan itself is fine. For example, an affirmative could argue that it would be good to reduce our nuclear stockpile to avoid global proliferation out of fear of rogue states acquiring nuclear weapons. The negative could respond with an aff-inclusive kritik that argues that it would be good to reduce our nuclear stockpile because nuclear weapons are unethical, but that we ought not conceptualize other states as fundamentally dangerous.
* Theory: Sometimes the subject matter of the affirmative's case will create an uneven playing field from the beginning. In these cases, the negative can resort to making objections as to the procedure or content of the affirmative case. These objections often are "theoretical" in that they try to make objections based upon what bad can/has come to debate from the infraction.

==Evidence==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Debateimage.jpg|thumb|Tubs of evidence{{pufc|Debateimage.jpg|date=24 January 2013}}]] --&gt;
{{Main|Evidence (policy debate)}}
Evidence in debates is organized into units called ''cards'' (because such evidence was originally printed on note cards, though the practice has long been out of favor). Cards are designed to condense an author's argument so that debaters have an easy way to access the information. A card is composed of three parts: the tag, the cite, and the body. The ''tag'' is the debater's summary of the argument presented in the body. A tag is usually only one or two sentences. The ''cite'' contains all relevant citation information (that is, the author, date of publication, journal, title, etc.). Although every card should contain a complete citation, only the author's name and date of publication are typically spoken aloud in a speech. Some teams will also read the author's qualifications if they wish to emphasize this information. The ''body'' is a fragment of the author's original text. The length of a body can vary greatly—cards can be as short as a few sentences and as long as two or more pages. Most cards are between one and five paragraphs in length. The body of a card is often underlined or highlighted in order to eliminate unnecessary or redundant sentences when the card is read in a round. In a round, the tag is read first, followed by the cite and the body.

As pieces of evidence accumulate use, multiple colors of highlighting and different thicknesses of underlining often occur, sometimes making it difficult to determine which portion of the evidence was read. If debaters stop before finishing the underlined or highlighted portion of a card, it is considered good form to "mark" the card to show where one stopped reading. To otherwise misrepresent how much of a card was read—either by stopping early or by skipping underlined or highlighted sections—is known as "cross-reading" or "clipping" which is generally considered cheating. Although many judges overtly condemn the practice on their paradigms, it is hard to enforce, especially if judges permit debaters to be excessively unclear. Opponents will generally stand behind a debater whom they believe to be cross-reading or clipping, as if waiting to take a card (see below), and silently read along with them in an attempt to get their opponent to stop or the judge to notice.

As cards are read in round, it is common for an opponent to collect and examine even while a speech is still going on. This practice originated in part because cards are read at a rate faster than conversational speed but also because the un-underlined portions of cards are not read in round. Taking the cards during the speech allows the opponent to question the author's qualifications, the original context of the evidence, etc. in [[cross-examination]]. It is generally accepted whichever team is using preparation time has priority to read evidence read previously during a round by both teams. As a result, large amounts of evidence may change hands after the use of preparation time but before a speech. Most judges will not deduct from a team's preparation time for time spent finding evidence which the other team has misplaced.

After a round, judges often "call for cards" to examine evidence whose merit was contested during the round or whose weight was emphasized during rebuttals so that they can read the evidence for themselves. Although widespread, this practice is explicitly banned at some tournaments, most notably [[National Catholic Forensic League]] nationals, and some judges refuse to call for cards because they believe the practice constitutes "doing work for debaters that should have been done during round". Judges may also call for evidence for the purpose of obtaining its citation information so that they can produce the evidence for their own school. Opponents and spectators are also generally allowed to collect citations in this manner, and some tournaments send scouts to rounds to facilitate the collection of cites for every team at the tournament, information which is sometimes published online.

==Judging==

A judge refers to the individual responsible for determining the winner and loser of a policy debate round as well as assessing the relative merit of the participant speakers.  Judges must resolve the complex issues presented in short time while, ideally, avoiding inserting their own personal beliefs that might cloud impartiality. 

Some circuits see ''lay'' or inexperienced judges recruited from the community as an important "part of the game." Debaters in these circuits must be able to adapt from presentations to individuals with no debate experience at all, to judges who have themselves been debaters. This use of lay judges significantly impacts delivery and argumentation as the rapid-fire style and complex debate-theory [[argument]]s are frequently incomprehensible to lay judges. For this reason, other circuits restrict policy debate judging to qualified judges, generally ex-debaters. The use of lay judges, and its impact in speed, presentation and argumentation is a source of great controversy in the US high school debate community.

===Speaker points===
The judge is charged not only with selecting a winner, but also must allot points to each competitor. Known as "speaker points" or simply "speaks", its goal is to provide a numerical evaluation of the debaters' speaking skills. Speaker point schemes vary throughout local state and regional organizations particularly at the high school level. However, the method accepted by most national organizations such as the National Forensic League, Tournament of Champions, National Catholic Forensic League, Cross-Examination Debate Association, and National Debate Tournament, use values ranging from 1 to 30. In practice, within these organizations the standard variation is 26‑29, where 26's are given to extremely poor speakers, where a perfect score is considered incredibly rare and warranted only by an outstanding performance. Most tournaments accept halfpoint gradiations, for example 28.5s. Generally, speaker points are seen as secondary in importance to wins and losses, yet often correlate with a team's win/loss rate. In other words, the judge usually awards the winning team cumulatively higher speaker points than the losing team. If the judge does not, the decision is considered a "low-point win". Low-point wins simply mean that the team with better argumentation spoke worse, but are often rare, because judges will vote for teams that speak better, and award better speaker points to victorious teams.

In some smaller jurisdictions, the judge ranks the speakers 1‑4 instead of awarding them speaker points. Either speaker-point calculation may be used to break ties among teams with like records. Some areas also use speaker rankings in addition to speaker points in order to differentiate between speakers awarded the same number of points.

At a majority of tournaments, debaters also receive "speaker awards", which are awarded to the debaters who received the greatest number of speaker points. Many tournaments also drop the highest and lowest score received by each debater, in order to ensure that the speaker award calculations are fair and consistent, despite the preferences of different judges. The amount of speaker awards given out varies based on the number of debaters competing at any given tournament. For instance, a small local tournament might only award trophies or plaques to the top three debaters, whereas a widely attended "national circuit" tournament might give out awards to the top ten or fifteen speakers.

===Paradigms===
Experienced debate judges (who were generally debaters in high school and/or college) generally carry a mindset that favors certain arguments and styles over others. Depending on what mindset, or paradigm, the judge uses, the debate can be drastically different. Because there is no one view of debate agreed upon by everyone, many debaters question a judge about their paradigm and/or their feelings on specific arguments before the round.

Not every judge fits perfectly into one paradigm or another. A judge may say that they are "tabula rasa" or tab for short, or willing to listen to anything, but draw the line at arguments they consider to be offensive (such as arguments in favor of racism). Or, a judge might be a "policymaker", but still look at the debate in an offense/defense framework like a games-playing judge.

Examples of paradigms include:
* '''Stock issues:''' In order for the affirmative team to win, their plan must retain all of the [[stock issues]], which are Harms, Inherency, Solvency, Topicality, and Significance. For the negative to win, they only need to prove that the affirmative fails to meet one of the stock issues. These judges are more likely to dislike newer arguments such as kritiks and some theoretical points.
* '''Policymaker:''' At the end of the round, the judge compares the affirmative plan with either the negative counterplan or the status quo. Whichever one is a better policy option is the winner. The better policy option is determined by comparing the advantages and disadvantages of each.
* '''''[[Tabula rasa]]''''': From the [[Latin]] for "blank slate", the judge attempts to come into the round with no predispositions. These judges typically expect debaters to "debate it out", which includes telling the judge what paradigm they should view the round in.
* '''Games player:''' Views debate as a game. Judges who use this paradigm tend to be concerned with whether or not each team has a fair chance at winning the debate. They usually view the debate flow as a gameboard, and look at arguments according to an offence/defense structure.
* '''Speaking skills/communications:''' This type of judge is concerned with good presentation and persuasion skills. They tend to vote for teams that are more articulate, and present arguments in the most appealing way. These judges usually disapprove of speed.
* '''Hypothesis tester:''' In order for the affirmative to win, they convince the judge to support the resolution. Conversely, the negative must convince the judge to negate the resolution.
* '''Kritikal:''' Judges who prefer kritik debates and look to who most effectively breaks free from educationally harmful mindset such as [[patriarchy]], [[racism]], or [[orientalism]].

==Competition==
{{Main|Policy debate competitions}}

===Tournaments===
Most high school debaters debate in local tournaments in their city, state or nearby states. Thousands of tournaments are held each year at high schools throughout the US.

A small subset of high school debaters, mostly from elite public and private schools, travel around the country to tournaments in what is called the 'national circuit.' The championship of the national circuit is usually considered to be the [[Tournament of Champions (debate)|Tournament of Champions]], also called the T.O.C, at the [[University of Kentucky]], which requires formal qualification in the form of two or more bids to the tournament. Bids are achieved by reaching a certain level of elimination rounds (for example, quarter-finals) at select, highly competitive, and carefully chosen tournaments across the country based upon the quality of debaters they attract and the diversity of locations from across the United States they represent.

===Urban debate===
[[Urban debate league]]s give students in urban school districts an opportunity to participate in policy debate. There are currently urban debate leagues in 24 of the largest cities in the United States. In total, more than 500 high schools participate in the league and more than 40,000 students have competed in urban debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Urban Debate QuickFacts |url=http://urbandebate.org/quickfacts.shtml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411183813/http://www.urbandebate.org/quickfacts.shtml |archivedate=April 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Championships===

====High school====

There is some dispute over what constitutes the "national championship" in the United States per se, but two tournaments generally compete for the title:
The [[Tournament of Champions (debate)|Tournament of Champions]] held at the [[University of Kentucky]], and the National Speech and Debate tournament sponsored by the [[National Forensic League]] (now known as the National Speech &amp; Debate Association). For the highest level of competition, the Tournament of Champions is generally considered to be the more prestigious title to hold.
* Other national championships include:
** The Grand National Tournament of the [[National Catholic Forensic League]].
** The National Championship of the [[National Association of Urban Debate Leagues]] (NAUDL).
** The National Debate Coaches' Association Championship (NDCA)
** The [[National Christian Forensics and Communications Association]] (NCFCA)
** The National Invitational Tournament of Champions (NITOC) of [[Stoa USA]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoausa.org/nitoc-2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106224157/http://www.stoausa.org/nitoc-2011|date=November 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** The National Speech and Debate Association National Tournament (NSDA).

====TFA debate====
In Texas, some debate occurs on the [[Texas Forensic Association]] (TFA) level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Forensics Association|url=http://www.tfa.org|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This organization includes mostly the progressive judging paradigms and favors many off topic arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Debate Shack|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ak/kritiklemur|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TFA is geared towards the larger schools/programs who tend to be in the suburban areas in the major cities in the eastern part of the state.  The other type of debate is UIL. UIL is open to all public schools throughout Texas.

TFA State policy debate tends to favor a multitude of off-case arguments and teams that favor a progressive style; while UIL State tends to be more policy focused.

====College====
There is no single unified national championship in college debate; though the [[National Debate Tournament]] (NDT), the [[Cross Examination Debate Association]] (CEDA) and the [[American Debate Association]] (ADA) all host national tournaments. The NDT committee issues a ranking report of the top 16 teams in the country ("first round bids") for automatic advancement to the NDT in early February. The report roughly determines a regular season champion called the 'Copeland Award' for the team rated the highest over the course of the year through early February.

===Institutes and camps===
{{Main|Debate camp}}
While once attended by only highly competitive policy debaters, many high school students now attend debate institutes, which are typically held at colleges in the summer. Most institutes range from about two to seven weeks.

Many institutes divide students into work groups, or "labs", based on skill level and experience. Many even offer specialized "advanced" or "scholars" workshops, to which acceptance is highly limited.

==Resolutions==
A '''resolution''' or '''topic''' is a statement which the [[affirmative (policy debate)|affirmative team]] affirms and the [[negative (policy debate)|negative team]] negates. Resolutions are selected annually by affiliated schools. Most resolutions from the 1920s to 2005 have begun "Resolved: that The United States federal government should" although some variations from this structure have been apparent both before the NDT-CEDA merger and with the 2006–2007 college policy debate topic, which limited the affirmative agent to the [[United States Supreme Court]].

At the college level, a number of topics are proposed and interested parties write "topic papers" discussing the pros and cons of that individual topic. Each school then gets one vote on the topic. The single topic area voted on then has a number of proposed topic wordings, one is chosen, and it is debated by affiliated students nationally for the entire season (standard academic school year).

At the high-school level, "topic papers" are also prepared but the voting procedure is different. These papers are then presented to a topic selection committee which rewords each topic and eventually narrows down the number of topics to five topics. Then the five resolutions are put to a two-tiered voting system. State forensic associations, the National Forensic League, and the National Catholic Forensic League all vote on the five topics, narrowing it down to two. Then the two topics are again put to a vote, and one topic is selected.
* The 2010-2011 high school resolution was:

Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially reduce its military and/or police presence in one or more of the following: South Korea, Japan, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Iraq, Turkey.
* The 2011–2012 high school resolution was:

Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its exploration and/or development of space beyond the Mesosphere.
* The 2012–2013 high school resolution was:

Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its transportation infrastructure investment in the United States.
* The 2013–2014 high school resolution was:

Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its economic engagement toward Cuba, Mexico or Venezuela.
* The 2014–2015 high school resolution was:

Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its non-military exploration and/or development of the Earth's oceans.
* The 2015–2016 high school resolution was:

Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially curtail its domestic surveillance.
* The 2016–2017 high school resolution was:
Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its economic and/or diplomatic engagement with the People's Republic of China.
* The 2017–2018 high school resolution is:
Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its funding and/or regulation of primary and/or secondary education in the United States.
* The 2018-2019 high school resolution is:
Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially reduce its restrictions on legal immigration to the United States.

In addition to speeches, policy debates may allow for a certain amount of preparation time, or "[[prep time]]," during a debate round. NFL rules call for 5&amp;nbsp;minutes of total prep time that can be used, although in practice high school debate tournaments usually give 8&amp;nbsp;minutes of prep time. College debates typically have 10&amp;nbsp;minutes of preparation time. The preparation time is used at each team's preference; they can use different amounts of preparation time before any of their speeches, or even none at all. Prep time can be allocated strategically to intimidate or inconvenience the other team:  for instance, normally a 1AR requires substantial prep time, so a well-executed "stand up 1AR," delivered after no prep time intimidates the negative team and takes away from time that the 2NR may have used to prepare the parts of his/her speech which do not rely on what the 1AR says.

'''Protection International''' (PI) is an international [[non-profit organisation]] dedicated to the protection of [[human rights defenders]] (HRDs). Its stated mission is to enhance the security and the protection of "threatened civil society actors with non-violent means, especially those who fight for their legitimate rights and for the rights of others as they are guaranteed by the [[international humanitarian law]] and the human rights conventions".&lt;ref name="pimandate"&gt;{{Cite book|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Protection International Mandate|publisher=Protection International|year=2009|page=1|doi=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protection International began its activities in 1998 as the former European Office of [[Peace Brigades International]] (PBI-BEO) and is headquartered in Brussels. Working on the principle that "human rights defenders are one of the main actors fighting against impunity in the name of justice",&lt;ref name="aboutpi"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.protectioninternational.org/spip.php?rubrique57&amp;lang=en |title=About Protection International | publisher=Protection International |accessdate=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; PI runs field projects in several countries ([[the Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Uganda]], [[Nepal]], [[Thailand]], [[Colombia]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]]) and conflict-stricken zones such as the [[East Africa|East]] and [[Horn of Africa]] in collaboration with local partner organisations.

It provides human rights defenders (i.e. [[trade unionists]], [[journalists]], [[LGBTI|lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals]] defenders, members of anti-corruption organizations, etc.) with training, knowledge and tools, such as the Protection Manual for Human Rights Defenders ",&lt;ref name="ProtectionManual"&gt;Marie Caraj, Luis Enrique Eguren {{Cite web|url=http://www.protectionline.org/IMG/pdf/manualenglish-3rdedition-2.pdf |title=New Protection Manual for Human Rights Defenders |year=2009 |publisher=Protection International |accessdate=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to develop protection measures into their work and enable them "to defend all human rights".&lt;ref name="pimandate"/&gt; Protection International also aims at mobilising the national and international community (parliaments, governments, the [[United Nations]], the media and [[public opinion]]).

==History==
Protection International is the former [[European Union]] office of [[Peace Brigades International]] (PBI-BEO). In October 2007, PBI-BEO officially became Protection International, after a separation with the PBI organisation carried out by common consent. Nevertheless, current activities run by Protection International are the logical result of defenders protection initiatives which began more than a decade ago.

In 1998, it organised a hearing in the Plenary of the [[European Parliament]] where human rights defenders from [[Colombia]] and [[Guatemala]] witnessed. Since then, PI supports the development and implementation of "new tactics and tools for the protection of [[Human rights defender|HRDs]] by improving their own security strategies, thus also enabling them to improve their protection of others"&lt;ref name="piglobalprogramme"&gt;{{Cite book|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Global Protection Programme for Human Rights Defenders|publisher=Protection International|year=2008|page=1|doi=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;(victim groups, witnesses, [[Internally Displaced People]] communities, women's HRD's, [[LGBTI]], among others).

From 1999 to 2002, PI organised public seminars on International Observation Strategies for [[INGO]]s and other stakeholders throughout Europe. At the same time, training activities on security and protection of HRD's were held in more than twenty countries (among others, [[Mexico]], [[Guatemala]], [[Colombia]], [[Brazil]], [[Peru]], [[Honduras]], [[Bolivia]], [[the Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]], [[Ingushetia]], [[Serbia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[India]] and [[Thailand]]).

From 2004 onwards, the organisation launched short and long-term activities in [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and [[Latin America]]. Notably, it opened in 2006 a first [[#Protection Desks]] in [[Nepal]], which is a permanent local structure whose objective is to diagnose human rights related threats, train local human rights defenders organisations and monitor their activities. Since then, [[#Protection Desks]] have been opened in Colombia, Guatemala, [[Uganda]] and the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].

While developing its presence in sensitive areas, PI began working in 2003 with members of Parliaments in various European countries on the adoption of resolutions and motions on the protection of defenders. As a result, PI assisted the Belgian Parliament and Senate in designing and adopting in July 2003, a global reach resolution which asked the Belgian Government to "request its diplomatic missions to observe carefully and systematically the situation of human rights defenders in the countries where they're working.""&lt;ref name="PiResolutionBel"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.senate.be/www/?MIval=/publications/viewPubDoc&amp;TID=50331712&amp;LANG=nl |title=Proposition de résolution concernant la protection des défenseurs des droits humains (déposée par M. Philippe Mahoux) |date=3 July 2003 |publisher=Parlement de Belgique |accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref_label|A|a|none}}. In 2004, the [[Bundestag]] adopted a similar resolution &lt;ref name="PiResolutionAll"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dipbt.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/15/020/1502078.pdf|title=Entschliessung des Deutschen Bundestages : Schutz von bedrohten Menschenrechtsverteidigern |year=December 2003 |publisher=Bundestag |accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Spain followed in 2007 by voting its own legislation.&lt;ref name="PiResolutionEs"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.congreso.es/public_oficiales/L8/CONG/DS/PL/PL_263.PDF|title= Proposicion no de Ley sobre la Protección de Defensores y Defensoras de los Derechos Humanos |date=11 May 2007 |publisher=Congreso de Los Diputados |pages=14–22|accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PiResolutionEs2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://intranet.congreso.es/public_oficiales/L8/CONG/BOCG/D/D_577.PDF#page=5|title= Proposicion no de Ley sobre la Protección de Defensores y Defensoras de los Derechos Humanos |date=28 June 2007 |publisher=Congreso de Los Diputados |pages=5|accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last few years, Protection International developed itself quite rapidly. From August 2008 to December 2009, it delivered trainings about security and protection measures for nearly 1500 HRD in its working countries. Moreover, it provides on a daily basis advice to 600 HRDs and their organisations through its permanent Protection Desks and liaise with international institutions such as the [[ACHPR|African Commission on Human and People's Rights]] (ACHPR) and the [[Special Rapporteur (UN)|UN Special Rapporteur]] on the situation of human rights defenders in order to design and implement new protection mechanisms.

In 2009, PI also issued its first [http://www.protectioninternational.org/IMG/pdf/PI_Annual_Report_web.pdf annual report] which represents "years of experience in field protection".&lt;ref name="PiReport"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.protectioninternational.org/IMG/pdf/PI_Annual_Report_web.pdf|title=Protection International Annual Report 2008 |year=2008 |publisher=Protection International |accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
Broadly speaking, Protection International's objective is "to contribute to ensuring fulfilment of national and international obligations{{Ref_label|B|b|none}} for the protection of human rights defenders – people who, individually or together with others, take action to promote or protect human rights". Concretely it focuses itself on two goals :

* To promote wider knowledge, improved decision-making and increase the effective use of field protection strategies for and by the main stakeholders in protection.{{Ref_label|B|b|none}}
* To directly support the work of all stakeholders in the effective use of field protection.

In every activities, Protection Line follows international standards in international human rights law and especially the [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/defenders/docs/declaration/declaration.pdf UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders](1998), The [http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/16332-re01.en08.pdf EU Guidelines on HRD] and the UN Guiding Principles for [[IDPs]] ([[Francis Deng|Deng]]'s principles).&lt;ref name="Deng 1998"&gt;{{Cite book| first=Francis | last=Deng| coauthors=| contribution=The guiding principles on internal displacement| title=E/CN.4/1998/53/Add.l, February 11. New York, NY: United Nations| editor-first=| editor-last=| coeditors=| publisher=United Nations| place=New York| pages=| date=| year=| id= | contribution-url=http://www.reliefweb.int/ocha_ol/pub/idp_gp/idp.html| format=| accessdate=2010-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it put the emphasis on the improvement of human rights defenders abilities regarding the handling of security, protection and psychosocial training, both for themselves and the beneficiaries of their work, PI's Global Protection programme also focuses itself on political action and advocacy, in order that the national and international authorities and other key actors involved in protection issues enforce their obligations in terms of human rights defenders protection.

==Protection International's Work==
According to the Annual Report 2008 foreword, Protection International's role is not "to replace governments"&lt;ref name="PiReport" /&gt; in their responsibilities to protect human right's defenders but well to "advise defenders on improving their security by following tried-and-tested procedures" and to complement the work done by other [[NGOs]] and international institutions in this field. Therefore, PI covers a wide range of activities :
* '''Protection Capacity Building and Training''' through analysing the risks faced by HRDs in various contexts, managing their security and transferring knowledge and tools
* '''Protection research''' : publication of manuals and informations to develop best practices
* '''Advocacy''' : dissemination of information among key actors in human rights issues {{Ref_label|B|b|none}}, organization of debates and involvement of media, parliaments and trade unions, acting as an alarm to local authorities when they tend to forget their international obligations and commitments on HRDs protection
* '''Video Advocacy''' : production of testimonies and portraits of HRDS, showing their working environments, work experience (threats and challenges faced, achievements reached)
* '''Setting-up of Protection Desks''' that will be used as local centres in collaboration with partner networks and organisations.
* '''Managing [http://www.protectionline.org www.protectionline.org]''', a project website providing informations, documents, publications, press releases and promoting urgent actions for the protection of HRD.

===Protection Desks===
In the last years, Protection International turned its attention to the setting and development of an original and long-term concept : the Protection Desk (PDs). PDs are permanent structures that provide human rights defenders with the know-how and necessary tools to prioritize security and protection issues in their working plans (i.e. : in a newspaper or a trade union) and to develop their own security plan based on the trainings given by PI's trainers on the field. PDs are developed with other human rights organizations active in the targeted country and local partner organizations. The first Protection Desk opened in Nepal in 2006 and worked with "NGO's working in conflict regions with ethnic minorities, victims and community committees and on security-sensitivie topics like human trafficking".&lt;ref name="PiHistory"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.protectioninternational.org/spip.php?rubrique59&amp;lang=en|title=Protection International History |accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Protection International grew substantially and opened new PD's in Uganda, Colombia, Guatemala and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Moreover, the organization is in the preparation of the setting up of a new Protection Desk in Thaïland which should be active in various countries of the region, from Pakistan to Indonesia.&lt;ref name="inreport"&gt;{{Cite book|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Interim Narrative Report|publisher=Protection International|year=2010|page=1|doi=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===

==== Democratic Republic of the Congo ====

In 2004, Protection International led an observatory mission in DRC and organised two seminars on the EU Guidelines on HRDs.&lt;ref name="PiHistory"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.protectioninternational.org/spip.php?rubrique59&amp;lang=en |title=Protection International History|year=2009|publisher=Protection International |accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EUGuidelines"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/16332-re01.en08.pdf |title=European Union Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders |year=2008|publisher=Council of the European Union |accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2006 until 2007, it went on with the training of defenders: among the beneficiaries, there were 185 organisations of civil society coming from 13 conflict regions. Along this, Protection International developed regular advocacy activities for an improved protection of HRDs, mainly aimed at European embassies, the [[MONUC]] and also national and local stakeholders, especially those involved in the reform of the Congolese Judiciary.

In July 2006, PI organised a conference with 30 Congolese HRDs, Michael Matthiessen, [[Javier Solana]]'s personal representative for human rights and the [[ACHPR]]'s Special Rapporteur, Reine Alapini.&lt;ref name="Arimpunité"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.achpr.org/english/activity_reports/21%20Activity%20Report.pdf |title=TWENTY-FIRST ACTIVITY REPORT OF THE AFRICAN COMMISSION ON HUMAN AND PEOPLES’ RIGHTS Twenty-first Activity Report of the African Commission on Human and People's Rights|year=2007|publisher=African Union |page=11 |accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; En 2006, PI produced "Les armes de l'impunité" ("The Weapons of Impunity"), a documentary that recounts the assassination of Pascal Kabungulu, a Congolese human rights defender, who worked for the "Ligue des Droits de l'Homme dans la Région des Grands Lacs" (The Human Rights League of the Great Lakes) and the Protestant NGO "Héritiers de la Justice" (Heirs of Justice), and denounces the systematic intimidation or physic violence against the defenders who documented the abuses committed during the [[Second Congo War]].&lt;ref name="Arimpunité"/&gt;

In May 2009, Protection International requested a re-trial of the Maheshe Case.&lt;ref name="MahesheReport"&gt;{{Cite book| first=Sophie | last=Roudil| coauthors=| title=Rapport d’observation du procès d’appel "Maheshe" devant la cour militaire du Sud-Kivu (R.D.

According to Protection International, the trial "which took place in front of the Military Jurisdictions of Bukavu both at first instance and at appeal, respected neither the norms of a fair and equitable trial nor led to the manifestation of truth. In spite of this, three civilians were sentenced to death in May 2008".&lt;ref name="PRMaheshe"&gt;{{cite document |title=Executive Summary : Press Conference on the Maheshe Case in Bukavu |publisher=Protection International |date=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization recounts the whole observation of the appeal trial in a [http://www.protectionline.org/IMG/pdf/Maheshe_Rapport_2nd_edition-2.pdf comprehensive report] entitled "Rapport d’observation du procès d’appel «Maheshe» devant la cour militaire du Sud-Kivu (R.D. Congo) et suivi des recours". The work and the call for re-examination and re-trial of Protection International was deemed by the Belgian journalist Colette Braeckman, specialist of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]], "all the more relevant as Didace Namujimbo, another journalist from Bukavu who also worked for the Monuc -which didn't take any civil action for both of its contributors- was assassinated in similar circumstances in 2008"&lt;ref name="braeckman" /&gt;

In August 2009, after the assassination of Bruno Koko Chirambiza, journalist at the Bukavu private station Radio Star Protection International, along with four other NGO's (Action des chrétiens pour l'abolition de la torture, Fédération de l'action des chrétiens pour l'abolition de la torture, Frontline et Diakonie), asked the Congolese authorities to put an end to impunity, claiming that "the situation of journalists and human rights defenders in the DRC is more and more worrying".

'''Self-replication''' is any behavior of a [[dynamical system]] that yields construction of an identical copy of itself. [[Cell (biology)|Biological cell]]s, given suitable environments, reproduce by [[cell division]]. During cell division, [[DNA]] is replicated and can be transmitted to offspring during [[reproduction]]. [[virus (biology)|Biological viruses]] can [[Viral replication|replicate]], but only by commandeering the reproductive machinery of cells through a process of infection. Harmful [[prion]] proteins can replicate by converting normal proteins into rogue forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8435320.stm |title='Lifeless' prion proteins are 'capable of evolution' |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-01-01 |accessdate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Computer virus]]es reproduce using the hardware and software already present on computers. Self-replication in [[robotics]] has been an area of research and a subject of interest in [[science fiction]]. Any self-replicating mechanism which does not make a perfect copy (Mutation&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Mutation|date=2018-11-08|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mutation&amp;oldid=867900912|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;) will experience [[genetic variation]] and will create variants of itself. These variants will be subject to [[natural selection]], since some will be better at surviving in their current environment than others and will out-breed them.

==Overview==

===Theory===
{{See also|Von Neumann universal constructor}}

Early research by [[John von Neumann]]&lt;ref name=Hixon_vonNeumann&gt;{{cite book|last=von Neumann|first=John|title=The Hixon Symposium|year=1948|location=Pasadena, California|pages=1–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; established that replicators have several parts:

*A coded representation of the replicator
*A mechanism to copy the coded representation
*A mechanism for effecting construction within the host environment of the replicator

Exceptions to this pattern may be possible, although none have yet been achieved.  For example, scientists have come close to  constructing [https://arstechnica.com/science/2011/04/investigations-into-the-ancient-rna-world/ RNA that can be copied] in an "environment" that is a solution of RNA monomers and transcriptase.  In this case, the body is the genome, and the specialized copy mechanisms are external.  The requirement for an outside copy mechanism has not yet been overcome, and such systems are more accurately characterized as "assisted replication" than "self-replication".

However, the simplest possible case is that only a genome exists.  Without some specification of the self-reproducing steps, a genome-only system is probably better characterized as something like a [[crystal]].

===Classes of self-replication===
Recent research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/5.1.htm | date = 2004 | accessdate = 29 June 2013 | last = Freitas | first = Robert | last2 = Merkle | first2 = Ralph | title = Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines - General Taxonomy of Replicators}}&lt;/ref&gt; has begun to categorize replicators, often based on the amount of support they require.

*Natural replicators have all or most of their design from nonhuman sources. Such systems include natural life forms.
*[[Autotroph]]ic replicators can reproduce themselves "in the wild".  They mine their own materials. It is conjectured that non-biological autotrophic replicators could be designed by humans, and could easily accept specifications for human products.
*Self-reproductive systems are conjectured systems which would produce copies of themselves from industrial feedstocks such as metal bar and wire.
*Self-assembling systems assemble copies of themselves from finished, delivered parts. Simple examples of such systems have been demonstrated at the macro scale.

The design space for machine replicators is very broad. A comprehensive study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/5.1.9.htm | date = 2004 | accessdate = 29 June 2013 | last1 = Freitas | first1 = Robert | last2 = Merkle | first2 = Ralph | title = Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines - Freitas-Merkle Map of the Kinematic Replicator Design Space (2003–2004)}}&lt;/ref&gt; to date by [[Robert Freitas]] and [[Ralph Merkle]] has identified 137 design dimensions grouped into a dozen separate categories, including: (1) Replication Control, (2) Replication Information, (3) Replication Substrate, (4) Replicator Structure, (5) Passive Parts, (6) Active Subunits, (7) Replicator Energetics, (8) Replicator Kinematics, (9) Replication Process, (10) Replicator Performance, (11) Product Structure, and (12) Evolvability.

===A self-replicating computer program===
{{Main article|Quine (computing)}}

In [[computer science]] a [[Quine (computing)|quine]] is a self-reproducing computer program that, when executed, outputs its own code. For example, a quine in the [[Python (programming language)|Python programming language]] is:

:&lt;code&gt;a='a=%r;print a%%a';print a%a&lt;/code&gt;

A more trivial approach is to write a program that will make a copy of any stream of data that it is directed to, and then direct it at itself. In this case the program is treated as both executable code, and as data to be manipulated. This approach is common in most self-replicating systems, including biological life, and is simpler as it does not require the program to contain a complete description of itself.

In many programming languages an empty program is legal, and executes without producing errors or other output. The output is thus the same as the source code, so the program is trivially self-reproducing.

===Self-replicating tiling===
{{See also|Self-similarity}}

In [[geometry]] a self-replicating tiling is a tiling pattern in which several [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] tiles may be joined together to form a larger tile that is similar to the original.  This is an aspect of the field of study known as [[tessellation]].  The "sphinx" [[hexiamond]] is the only known self-replicating [[pentagon]].&lt;ref&gt;For an image that does not show how this replicates, see: Eric W. Weisstein. "Sphinx." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Sphinx.html http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Sphinx.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, four such [[concave polygon|concave]] pentagons can be joined together to make one with twice the dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;For further illustrations, see [http://www.geoaustralia.com/italian/Sphinx/Guide.html Teaching TILINGS / TESSELLATIONS with Geo Sphinx]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solomon W. Golomb]] coined the term [[rep-tiles]] for self-replicating tilings.

In 2012, [[Lee Sallows]] identified rep-tiles as a special instance of a [[self-tiling tile set]] or setiset. A setiset of order ''n'' is a set of ''n'' shapes that can be assembled in ''n'' different ways so as to form larger replicas of themselves. Setisets in which every shape is distinct are called 'perfect'.  A rep-''n'' rep-tile is just a setiset composed of ''n'' identical pieces.

===Applications===
It is a long-term goal of some engineering sciences to achieve a [[clanking replicator]], a material device that can self-replicate.  The usual reason is to achieve a low cost per item while retaining the utility of a manufactured good.  Many authorities say that in the limit, the cost of self-replicating items should approach the cost-per-weight of wood or other biological substances, because self-replication avoids the costs of [[labour (economics)|labor]], [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[distribution (business)|distribution]] in conventional [[factory|manufactured goods]].

A fully novel artificial replicator is a reasonable near-term goal.
A [[NASA]] study recently placed the complexity of a [[clanking replicator]] at approximately that of [[Intel]]'s [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] 4 CPU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/883Toth-Fejel.pdf |title=Modeling Kinematic Cellular Automata Final Report |publisher= |date=April 30, 2004 |accessdate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, the technology is achievable with a relatively small engineering group in a reasonable commercial time-scale at a reasonable cost.

Given the currently keen interest in biotechnology and the high levels of funding in that field, attempts to exploit the replicative ability of existing cells are timely, and may easily lead to significant insights and advances.

A variation of self replication is of practical relevance in [[compiler]] construction, where a similar [[bootstrapping]] problem occurs as in natural self replication. A compiler ([[phenotype]]) can be applied on the compiler's own [[source code]] ([[genotype]]) producing the compiler itself. During compiler development, a modified ([[Mutation|mutated]]) source is used to create the next generation of the compiler. This process differs from natural self-replication in that the process is directed by an engineer, not by the subject itself.

==Mechanical self-replication==
{{Main article|self-replicating machine}}

An activity in the field of robots is the self-replication of machines. Since all robots (at least in modern times) have a fair number of the same features, a self-replicating robot (or possibly a hive of robots) would need to do the following:

*Obtain construction materials
*Manufacture new parts including its smallest parts and thinking apparatus
*Provide a consistent power source
*Program the new members
*error correct any mistakes in the offspring

On a [[Nanotechnology|nano]] scale, [[Assembler (nanotechnology)|assemblers]] might also be designed to self-replicate under their own power. This, in turn, has given rise to the "[[grey goo]]" version of [[Armageddon]], as featured in such science fiction novels as ''[[Bloom (novel)|Bloom]]'', ''[[Prey (novel)|Prey]]'', and ''[[Recursion (novel)|Recursion]]''.

The [[Foresight Institute]] has published guidelines for researchers in mechanical self-replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foresight.org/guidelines/ |title=Molecular Nanotechnology Guidelines |publisher=Foresight.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guidelines recommend that researchers use several specific techniques for preventing mechanical replicators from getting out of control, such as using a [[broadcast architecture]].

For a detailed article on mechanical reproduction as it relates to the industrial age see [[mass production]].

==Fields==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2017}}
Research has occurred in the following areas:

* [[Biology]] studies natural replication and replicators, and their interaction.  These can be an important guide to avoid design difficulties in self-replicating machinery.
* In [[Chemistry]] self-replication studies are typically about how a specific set of molecules can act together to replicate each other within the set &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Moulin, Giuseppone |title=Dynamic Combinatorial Self-Replicating Systems|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F128_2011_198|year=2011|publisher=Springer|DOI=10.1007/128_2011_198}}&lt;/ref&gt; (often part of [[Systems chemistry]] field).
* [[Meme]]tics studies ideas and how they propagate in human culture.  Memes require only small amounts of material, and therefore have theoretical similarities to [[virus]]es and are often described as [[virus|viral]].
* [[Nanotechnology]] or more precisely, [[molecular nanotechnology]] is concerned with making [[Nanotechnology|nano]] scale [[assembler (nanotechnology)|assemblers]].  Without self-replication, capital and assembly costs of molecular machines become impossibly large.
* Space resources: NASA has sponsored a number of design studies to develop self-replicating mechanisms to mine space resources.  Most of these designs include computer-controlled machinery that copies itself.
* [[Computer security]]: Many computer security problems are caused by self-reproducing computer programs that infect computers — [[computer worm]]s and [[computer virus]]es.
* In [[parallel computing]], it takes a long time to manually load a new program on every node of a large [[computer cluster]] or [[distributed computing]] system. Automatically loading new programs using [[mobile agent]]s can save the system administrator a lot of time and give users their results much quicker, as long as they don't get out of control.

==In industry==

===Space exploration and manufacturing===
The goal of self-replication in space systems is to exploit large amounts of matter with a low launch mass.  For example, an [[autotroph]]ic self-replicating machine could cover a moon or planet with solar cells, and beam the power to the Earth using microwaves.  Once in place, the same machinery that built itself could also produce raw materials or manufactured objects, including transportation systems to ship the products. [[Von Neumann Probe|Another model]] of self-replicating machine would copy itself through the galaxy and universe, sending information back.

In general, since these systems are autotrophic, they are the most difficult and complex known replicators.  They are also thought to be the most hazardous, because they do not require any inputs from human beings in order to reproduce.

A classic theoretical study of replicators in space is the 1980 [[NASA]] study of autotrophic clanking replicators, edited by [[Robert Freitas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Advanced Automation for Space Missions]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the design study was concerned with a simple, flexible chemical system for processing lunar [[regolith]], and the differences between the ratio of elements needed by the replicator, and the ratios available in regolith.  The limiting element was [[Chlorine]], an essential element to process regolith for [[Aluminium]].  Chlorine is very rare in lunar regolith, and a substantially faster rate of reproduction could be assured by importing modest amounts.

The reference design specified small computer-controlled electric carts running on rails.  Each cart could have a simple hand or a small bull-dozer shovel, forming a basic [[robot]].

Power would be provided by a "canopy" of [[solar cell]]s supported on pillars.  The other machinery could run under the canopy.

A "[[casting]] [[robot]]" would use a robotic arm with a few sculpting tools to make [[plaster]] [[molding (process)|mold]]s.  Plaster molds are easy to make, and make precise parts with good surface finishes.  The robot would then cast most of the parts either from non-conductive molten rock ([[basalt]]) or purified metals.  An [[electricity|electric]] [[oven]] melted the materials.

A speculative, more complex "chip factory" was specified to produce the computer and electronic systems, but the designers also said that it might prove practical to ship the chips from Earth as if they were "vitamins".

===Molecular manufacturing===
{{Main article|molecular nanotechnology#Replicating nanorobots}}

[[Nanotechnology|Nanotechnologists]] in particular believe that their work will likely fail to reach a state of maturity until human beings design a self-replicating [[assembler (nanotechnology)|assembler]] of [[nanometer]] dimensions [http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/4.11.3.htm].

These systems are substantially simpler than autotrophic systems, because they are provided with purified feedstocks and energy.  They do not have to reproduce them. This distinction is at the root of some of the controversy about whether [[molecular manufacturing]] is possible or not.  Many authorities who find it impossible are clearly citing sources for complex autotrophic self-replicating systems.  Many of the authorities who find it possible are clearly citing sources for much simpler self-assembling systems, which have been demonstrated.  In the meantime, a [[Lego]]-built autonomous robot able to follow a pre-set track and assemble an exact copy of itself, starting from four externally provided components, was demonstrated experimentally in 2003 [http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.23.4.htm].

Merely exploiting the replicative abilities of existing cells is insufficient, because of limitations in the process of [[protein biosynthesis]] (also see the listing for [[RNA]]).
What is required is the rational design of an entirely novel replicator with a much wider range of synthesis capabilities.

In 2011, New York University scientists have developed artificial structures that can self-replicate, a process that has the potential to yield new types of materials.  They have demonstrated that it is possible to replicate not just molecules like cellular DNA or RNA, but discrete structures that could in principle assume many different shapes, have many different functional features, and be associated with many different types of chemical species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature10500 | last1 = Wang | first1 = Tong | last2 = Sha | first2 = Ruojie | last3 = Dreyfus | first3 = Rémi | last4 = Leunissen | first4 = Mirjam E. | last5 = Maass | first5 = Corinna | last6 = Pine | first6 = David J. | last7 = Chaikin | first7 = Paul M. | last8 = Seeman | first8 = Nadrian C. | year = 2011 | title = Self-replication of information-bearing nanoscale patterns | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v478/n7368/full/nature10500.html| journal = Nature | volume = 478 | issue = 7368 | pages = 225–228 | pmid=21993758 | pmc=3192504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111012132651.htm | title = Self-replication process holds promise for production of new materials. | date = 17 October 2011 | publisher = Science Daily | accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''TWERPS''''' ('''''The World's Easiest Role-Playing System''''') is a minimalist [[role-playing game]] (RPG) originally created by Reindeer Games (whose sole product was the ''TWERPS'' line) and distributed by [[Lou Zocchi|Gamescience]]. Presented as a parody of the complicated RPG systems which were prevalent at the time while still being a playable game in its own right, its simple structure and humorous nature gave it unexpected popularity. ''TWERPS'' was originally created, written and illustrated (in a distinctive cartoony style) by [[Jeff Dee|"Jeff &amp; 'Manda Dee"]], Jeff Dee being a noted game illustrator and co-writer of ''[[Villains and Vigilantes]]''.

==Publication history==
''TWERPS'' was designed by [[Jeff Dee]] and 'Manda Dee, and published by Reindeer Games in 1987 as a digest-sized 8-page pamphlet, with four cardstock sheets.&lt;ref name="HW"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schick |first=Lawrence|authorlink=Lawrence Schick|title=Heroic Worlds: A History and Guide to Role-Playing Games|publisher=Prometheus Books |year=1991|isbn=0-87975-653-5|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''TWERPS'' is a humorous universal system of minimalist rules; ''"TWERPS"'' stands for "The World's Easiest Role-Playing System".&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt; Characters have only one ability, Strength.&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt; Rules sections cover Strength, Combat, and "How to Do Everything."&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt; The game includes a sample character sheet, a combat hex sheet, cardstock miniatures, and an introductory micro-mini-scenario.&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt;

The actual rules of the game are indeed extremely simple. Characters are defined by a single attribute, "Strength", which is used for determining all traditional role-playing elements, such as whether or not the character successfully hits in combat, how fast they can move and how much damage they can take before dying. A de facto skill system exists in the form of "character classes" which give numerical bonuses to certain activities if their role called for it (for instance, a pilot having a +1 modifier on their roll to fly an aircraft).

== First Edition ''TWERPS'' titles ==
Originally each installment of the ''TWERPS'' system was sold in a small plastic bag containing an 8-page leaflet, a sheet of cardstock counters to be cut apart, little cardstock hex-maps and a tiny [[Ten-sided dice|ten-sided die]], each being a down-sized imitation of elements often found in larger, more elaborate games. The initial run of titles was printed at low cost with black ink on various colored papers to distinguish the various titles (the main rules were on pink paper, the kung-fu rules were on yellow, and so on).

*''TWERPS Basic Rules'': the core system, including the sample adventure "Watery Depths".
*''Fly By Knights'': a fantasy setting, describing very succinctly the world of Arkosa where characters ride various breeds of aerial mounts, stalk the fearsome Meganocerous and vie for knighthood.
*''Magic'': a rules expansion outlining a surprisingly detailed (for TWERPS anyway) magic system and spell-list.
*''Space Cadets'': guidelines for a space opera setting, in the form of various types of character classes, SF weaponry and psychic powers. Basic rules for vehicles were included.
*''Kung Fu Dragons'': a list of various martial arts which characters could train in and a system of colored belts to reward them. One of the cardstock extras was a tiny [[Gamemaster's screen|Game-master's screen]].

==Second Edition ''TWERPS'' titles==
As the game grew in popularity, the supplements were re-printed in expanded form with more pages and multi-color printing. New supplements covering new genres and specific objects of parody were also added. These expansions and later supplements were mainly written by Norman F. Morin Jr., Brian Rayburn, Jon Hancock and Niels Erickson rather than Jeff &amp; 'Manda Dee. The tone of these second edition titles was noticeably one of more overt humor and silliness, peppering the text with [[pun]]s (and even calling on fans to mail in suggested puns of their own for future supplements).

*All of the First Edition titles described above were reprinted in expanded full-color form.
*''Rocket Rangers'': the companion to ''Space Cadets'', this volume offered systems for spaceship design and combat and several sample ships. Unlike other 2nd edition titles, ''Rocket Rangers'' was mainly written by Jeff &amp; 'Manda Dee.
*''Twerps Twek'': a direct parody of [[Star Trek]], requiring ''Space Cadets'' and ''Rocket Rangers'' to use.
*''Robo-Punks'': rules for running [[Cyberpunk]] adventures, including brief systems for cybernetic implants and net-running.
*''Superdudes'': a list of super-powers for running [[superhero]] adventures.
*''Metaphysical Ninja Maniac Chainsaw Vitamin Junkies'': guidelines for running [[post-apocalyptic]] scenarios in the spirit of films like ''[[Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior|The Road Warrior]]'' (with a heavy addition of gonzo wackiness), including rules for vehicle damage and mutations.
*''Twisted Tales of Terror'': the horror supplement, with guidelines for creating monsters or playing monsters as [[player-character]]s.
*''M.E.C.H.I.-Tech'': a system for the design and battles between giant robots, with many direct riffs on the popular [[Battletech]] games.
*''The T.W.E.R.P.S. Files'': a direct parody of ''[[The X Files]]''.
*''How to Do Everything Better'': a general rules expansion, offering more character classes, more superpowers and more equipment. Also included were rules for allowing ''TWERPS'' characters to gain dimension-travelling powers.

The case examines how the rescued survivors, who kill and eat one person in order to survive, should be treated by the law.]]

"'''The Case of the Speluncean Explorers'''" is an article by legal philosopher [[Lon L. Fuller]] first published in the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' in 1949. Largely taking the form of a fictional judgment, it presents a [[jurisprudence|legal philosophy]] puzzle to the reader and five possible solutions in the form of [[judicial opinion]]s that are attributed to judges sitting on the fictional "Supreme Court of Newgarth" in the year 4300.{{efn|Fuller addressed his decision to date his scenario in the [[fifth millennium]] in the article's postscript, writing that "the reader puzzled by the choice of date may wish to be reminded that the centuries which separate us from the year 4300 are roughly equal to those that have passed since the [[Fifth-century Athens|Age of Pericles]] [i.e. the fifth century]".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=645}} }}

The case involves five explorers who are caved in following a landslide. They learn via intermittent radio contact that, without food, they are likely to starve to death before they can be rescued. They decide to engage in [[cannibalism]], and select one of their number to be killed and eaten so that the others may survive. They decide who should be killed by throwing a pair of dice.  After the four survivors are rescued, they are charged and found guilty of the [[murder]] of the fifth explorer. If their appeal to the Supreme Court of Newgarth fails, they face a mandatory [[capital punishment|death sentence]]. Although the wording of the statute is clear and unambiguous, there is intense public pressure for the men to avoid facing the death penalty.

The article offers five possible judicial responses. Each differs in its reasoning and on whether the survivors should be found guilty of breaching the law.  Two judges affirm the convictions, emphasising the importance of the [[separation of powers]] and [[Plain meaning rule|literal approach]] to [[statutory interpretation]]. Two other judges overturn the convictions; one focuses on "common sense" and the popular will while the other uses arguments drawn from the [[natural law]] tradition, emphasizing the [[purposive approach]]. A fifth judge, who is unable to reach a conclusion, recuses himself.  As the Court's decision is a tie, the original convictions are upheld and the men are sentenced to death.

Fuller's account has been described as "a classic in [[jurisprudence]]"{{sfn|D'Amato|1980|p=467}} and "a microcosm of [the 20th] century's debates" in legal philosophy.{{sfn|Eskridge Jr.|1993|p=467}}  It allows for contrasts to be drawn between different legal philosophies, with the main two being [[natural law]] and [[legal positivism]].  In the 50 years following the article's publication, a further 25 hypothetical judgments were written by various authors whose perspectives include [[natural law]] theory, [[consequentialism]], plain meaning [[positivism]] or [[textualism]], purposivism, historical contextualism, realism, pragmatism, [[critical legal studies]], [[feminism]], [[critical race theory]], [[process theory]] and minimalism.{{sfn|Roederer|2003|p=388}}

==Synopsis==
===Facts===
The facts of the case are recounted in the first judicial opinion, which is given by Chief Justice Truepenny.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=1851}}

Five cave explorers became trapped inside a cave following a landslide.  They have limited food supplies and no sources of nutrition inside the cave. Above ground, substantial resources are spent to rescue them, with 10 workmen killed in subsequent landslides near the blocked entrance. Radio contact is eventually established with the cavers on the 20th day of the cave-in, and the cavers learn that another 10 days would be required in order to free them. They then consult with medical experts, who inform them that they are unlikely to survive to the rescue given the likelihood of starvation.

[[File:Two red dice 01.svg|thumb|180px|left|In "the Case of the Speluncean Explorers", the person to be eaten was chosen by throwing a pair of dice. This method had also been suggested for choosing the victim in the similar real-life case of ''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]''.]]

One of the cavers, Roger Whetmore, then asks on the cavers' behalf if the cavers could survive 10 days longer "if they consumed the flesh of one of their number". The medical experts reluctantly confirm this to be the case. Whetmore then asks if they should [[sortition|draw lots]] to select a person to be killed and eaten. No one outside the cave is willing to answer this question. Radio contact is subsequently lost.

Once the cave-in is cleared, it is discovered that only four cavers have survived; Roger Whetmore had been killed and eaten by the others. The survivors state that Whetmore had originally come up with the ideas of cannibalism and choosing the victim through random chance, offering a pair of [[dice]] in his possession.

Before the dice are cast, Whetmore allegedly expresses a wish to withdraw from the arrangement, preferring to wait another week "before embracing an expedient so frightful and odious". The others refuse to accept his change of mind, and cast the dice on his behalf. The survivors claim that Whetmore conceded that the dice were thrown fairly. He is subsequently killed and eaten.

Following their rescue and recovery, the survivors are charged with the murder of Whetmore. The relevant statute provides that "Whoever shall willfully take the life of another shall be punished by death", offering no exceptions which would be relevant to the case.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=1853}} The jury seek a [[special verdict]], so that they can make limited findings of fact without having to return a verdict on whether it constitutes murder. The cavers are ultimately convicted of murder.

The [[Mandatory sentencing|mandatory sentence]] for murder in Newgarth is [[death by hanging]]. Both the trial judge and members of the jury petition the Chief Executive to [[Commutation of sentence|commute the sentence]] of the surviving spelunkers from the death penalty to six months' imprisonment. The Chief Executive refuses to act while the Supreme Court of Newgarth considers the appeal.

|+Summary of Fuller's five judicial opinions 
! Judge !! Key points !! Decision
|-
| Chief Justice Truepenny || 
* Statute is unambiguous and must be applied by judiciary notwithstanding personal views

Affirms convictions but recommends clemency
|-

* Defendants were in a "state of nature" so Newgarth's normal laws did not apply to them; the laws of nature would allow them to agree to sacrifice one's life to save the other four
* If the laws of Newgarth do apply, then a purposive approach must be taken to the statute. Judges can find an exception to the law by implication, as the Courts had earlier done with [[self-defense]].
** Principal purpose of the criminal law – deterrence – would not be served by convicting the defendants.

* Criticises Foster J's approach
** The natural law under the posited "state of nature" prioritises freedom of contract above the right to life

===Opinion of Chief Justice Truepenny===
The first opinion is largely [[Exposition (narrative)|expository]]; it is used to recount the facts of the case.  The Chief Justice states that the statute is unambiguous, with no applicable legal defences, so it must be applied by the court.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=619}}  He adds that granting mercy is a decision for the executive branch of government to make, rather than the judiciary.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=620}} However, the Chief Justice suggests that the judges of the court should add their names to the petition of the trial judge and jury requesting the Chief Executive to show mercy to the defendants. This would allow justice to be achieved "without impairing either the letter or spirit of our statutes and without offering any encouragement for the disregard of law".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=620}}

===Opinion of Justice Foster===
{{Quote|text=I believe something more is on trial in this case than the fate of these unfortunate explorers; that is the law of our Commonwealth. If this Court declares that under our law these men have committed a crime, then our law is itself convicted in the tribunal of common sense, no matter what happens to the individuals involved in this petition of error. For us to assert that the law we uphold and expound compels us to a conclusion we are ashamed of, and from which we can only escape by appealing to a dispensation resting within the personal whim of the Executive, seems to me to amount to an admission that the law of this Commonwealth no longer pretends to incorporate justice.|sign=Justice Foster{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=620}}}}

The second opinion takes a different approach to the Chief Justice's.  In determining that the convictions should be overturned, Justice Foster makes two main points.  Firstly, the defendants were in a "[[state of nature]]" at the time of the killing, so the laws of nature applied to them. The laws of nature allowed to agree to sacrifice one person for the survival of the rest.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=620}} Secondly, assuming the laws of Newgarth did apply, a {{cfy|text=[[functional approach]]|date=March 2016}} should be used in applying the statute.  As its main purpose is deterrence, the judge concluded that, just as with a case of self-defence, the purpose of the statute would not be served by upholding the convictions.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=624}}

The judge counters potential objections of [[judicial activism]] by suggesting that although judges must obey the will of legislators, they must do so intelligently. He draws analogies to servants who need to "read between the lines" of their masters' instructions; strict literal compliance may not always be the actual intention.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=625}}  Thus the "correction of obvious legislative errors or oversights is not to supplant the legislative will, but to make that will effective."{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=626}}

===Opinion of Justice Tatting===
In the third opinion, Justice Tatting is emotionally "torn between sympathy for [the defendants] and a feeling of abhorrence and disgust at the monstrous act they committed".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=626}} He ultimately finds himself unable to decide the case.

Justice Tatting disagrees strongly with Justice Foster's rationales in overturning the convictions. He criticizes the "state of nature" concept and is not satisfied with Justice Foster's formulation placing the law of contract above the law against murder.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=627–628}} He also notes the difficulty of applying the [[purposive approach]] to the criminal statute which has multiple purposes, including retribution and rehabilitation.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=628–629}} He distinguishes the self-defence exception that was created by past judges on the basis that it is not a "willful" killing, so it does not contradict the wording of the statute.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=629}} He finds that the self-defence exception could not be applied to the present case as it would raise "a quagmire of hidden difficulties".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=630}} 

The judge cites the case of  ''Commonwealth v Valjean'',{{efn|This reference invokes [[Jean Valjean]], the protagonist in Victor Hugo's 1862 novel ''[[Les Misérables]]''. In the novel, Valjean is imprisoned after stealing bread to feed his sister's starving children.{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=70–71}} }} in which starvation was held not to justify the theft of a loaf of bread, let alone homicide. These combined objections lead Justice Tatting to reject Justice Foster's reasoning as "intellectually unsound and approaching mere rationalization."{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=631}}

Despite rejecting Justice Foster's reasoning, Justice Tatting cannot bring himself to reach the alternative view, that the defendants' convictions should be upheld. He states that "almost every consideration that bears on the decision of the case
is counterbalanced by an opposing consideration leading in the opposite direction."{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=631}} Concluding with a criticism of the prosecutor for deciding to bring the prosecution in the first place, the judge makes the "unprecedented" decision of withdrawing from the case.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=631}}

===Opinion of Justice Keen===
The fourth opinion begins by excluding [[executive clemency]] and the morality of the defendants' actions as relevant factors to the court's deliberations.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=632}} Rather, the question before the court is purely one of applying the legislation of Newgarth and determining whether the defendants wilfully took the life of Whetmore. He criticizes the other judges for failing to distinguish the legal from the moral aspects of the case.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=632}} While he shares their preference that the defendants be spared from death, he respects the obligations of his office to put his "personal predilections" of what constitutes justice out of mind when interpreting and applying the law.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=632}}

Justice Keen objects vehemently to Justice Foster's purposive approach allowing the plain words of the law to be ignored.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=637}}{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=67}} He emphasizes that laws may have many possible purposes, with difficulties arising in divining the actual "purpose" of a piece of legislation.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=633}}

Justice Keen recalls that earlier instances of judicial activism in Newgarth had ultimately led to [[civil war]], which established the supremacy of the legislature over the judiciary.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=633}} He concludes by criticizing the courts' creation of the self-defence excuse, stating that waiting for the legislature to enact such revisions would have led to a stronger legal system.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=637}}

===Opinion of Justice Handy===
In contrast to the other judges, Justice Handy prefers to use a "pragmatic, common-sense approach", rather than abstract legal theories, to resolve the case.{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=69}} He criticizes his colleagues' "obscuring curtain of legalisms" when the case simply requires the application of "practical wisdom" of "human realities".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=637}} He emphasizes the need for the courts to maintain public confidence, which requires them to follow the 90% majority in favour of applying a token punishment or releasing the defendants altogether.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=640}}{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=69}} He is prepared to use Justice Foster's purposive approach doctrine as the legal rationale.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=640}}{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=69}}

Justice Handy notes that apart from the ambivalent Justice Tatting, the other judges share the majority public opinion.  The judges voting to uphold the convictions simply differ from Justices Foster and Handy on whose role it is to spare the defendants from the death penalty.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=642}}

*The ''[[William Brown (ship)|William Brown]]'' was a ship whose sinking led to several passengers being forced out of an overcrowded lifeboat to save the remaining passengers. It led to the case of ''United States v. Holmes'', in which crewman Alexander Holmes was charged with [[murder]] and convicted of [[manslaughter]] for his actions.

{{Libertarianism sidebar}}
'''''The God of the Machine''''' is a book written by [[Isabel Paterson]] and published in 1943 in the [[United States]]. At the time of its release, it was considered a cornerstone to the philosophy of [[individualism]]. Her biographer, [[Stephen D. Cox]], in 2004 described Paterson as the "earliest progenitor of [[libertarianism]] as we know it today".

==Background==
Isabel Paterson wrote a regular column for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', where she first articulated many of her beliefs, which reached their final form in ''The God of the Machine''. She also foreshadowed those ideas, especially free trade, in her historical novels during the 1920s and 1930s.

Paterson opposed most parts of the economic program, known as the [[New Deal]], which US president [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and the [[United States Congress|Congress]] put into effect during the 1930s, and she advocated less governmental involvement in social and [[finance|fiscal]] matters. She also led a group of younger friends (many of whom were other employees of the ''Herald Tribune'') who shared her views. One member of that group was the young [[Ayn Rand]].

Paterson and Rand promoted each other's books, and they conducted an extensive exchange of letters, touching on religion and philosophy. That correspondence ended with a personal quarrel in 1948. Rand, an [[atheist]], was critical of the attempts of Paterson, a [[Deism|deist]], to link [[capitalism]] with religion, things that Rand considered incompatible.

'''Third Party Non-violent Intervention''' (sometimes called '''TPNI''') refers to the practice of intervening from the outside in violent conflicts with the aim of reducing violence and allowing "space" for [[conflict resolution]]. Two common forms of intervention are as an intermediary in a negotiating capacity or, physically, by interposing one's body between two factions.

TPNI work is sometimes categorized into four main areas:
# Interpositioning
# Observation and Documentation
# Protective Accompaniment
# Modeling [[Nonviolence|nonviolent]] behavior in a conflict situation

Examples of groups that espouse this practice are [[Christian Peacemaker Teams]], [[International Solidarity Movement]], [[Muslim Peacemaker Teams]], [[Meta Peace Team]],  [[Peace Brigades International]] and [[Nonviolent Peaceforce]].

'''Thomas Luckmann''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ʌ|k|m|ən}}; October 14, 1927 – May 10, 2016) was an American-Austrian sociologist of [[Germans|German]] and [[Slovenes|Slovene]] origin who taught mainly in [[Germany]]. His contributions were central to studies in sociology of communication, [[sociology of knowledge]], [[sociology of religion]], and the [[philosophy of science]].

== Biography ==

He was born in [[Jesenice, Jesenice|Jesenice]], then part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. His father was an [[Austria]]n industrialist, while his mother was from a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] family from [[Ljubljana]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Novotny|first=L|date=2016|title=Social and communicative construction of reality - the memory of Thomas Luckmann|url=|journal=Sociologický Casopis|language=Czech|volume=52|pages=581–589|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his mother's side, he was the cousin of the Slovene poet [[Božo Vodušek]].

During [[World War II]], in 1943, he and his mother moved to [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1944 he was drafted for the army,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Endreß|first=Martin|date=2016|title=Thomas Luckmann (October 14, 1927–May 10, 2016)|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10746-016-9416-2|journal=Human Studies|language=en|volume=39|issue=4|pages=487–491|doi=10.1007/s10746-016-9416-2|issn=0163-8548|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; joining the [[Luftwaffe]] where he served as a [[Luftwaffenhelfer]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Luckmann: ''„Teilweise zufällig, teilweise, weil es doch Spaß macht“.'' In: Monika Wohlrab-Sahr (Hrsg.): ''Kultusoziologie: Paradigmen – Methoden – Fragestellungen''. VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften, Wiesbaden 2010, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 he became a [[prisoner of war]], and escaping after three months. He then settled in Vienna.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Luckmann studied [[philosophy]] and [[linguistics]] at the [[University of Vienna]] and [[University of Innsbruck|Innsbruck]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1950 he married Benita Petkevic, with whom he moved to the United States, where he studied at [[The New School]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The couple had three daughters.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

He worked as a professor of [[Sociology]] at the [[University of Konstanz]] in [[Germany]] from 1970 to his retirement,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adam|first=F|last2=Čas|first2=B|date=2004|title=Utemeljitev za imenovanje dr.

He died at the age of 88 on May 10, 2016, at his home in Austria.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Work  ==

Luckmann was a follower of the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologically]] oriented school of [[sociology]], established by the Austrian-American scholar [[Alfred Schütz]]. He contributed to the foundation of phenomenological sociology, the sociology of religion in modern societies, and the sociology of knowledge and communication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In his works, he developed the theory of [[social constructionism]], which argues that all knowledge, including the most basic common sense knowledge of everyday reality, is derived from and maintained by social interactions. Together with [[Peter L. Berger]], he wrote the book ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]'' in 1966. The book was an important part of the move in sociology, and partiuclarly the sociology of religion, away from the view of religion and religious values as central to [[Social order|the social order]], arguing that social order is socially constructed by individuals and/or groups of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/767737455|title=Encyclopedia of global religion|date=2012|publisher=SAGE Publications|others=Juergensmeyer, Mark., Roof, Wade Clark.|isbn=9781452266565|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|oclc=767737455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 he continued the work of Alfred Schütz, drawing on Schütz's notes and unfinished manuscripts to complete ''[[Structures of the Life-World]]'', published (posthumously for Schütz) in 1982.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Together with [[Richard Grathoff]] and Walter M. Sprondel, Luckmann founded the [[Social Science Archive Konstanz]] (also known as the Alfred Schütz Memorial Archives).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Luckmann was a member of the [[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] and held honorary doctorates from the Universities of [[University of Linköping|Linköping]], [[University of Ljubljana|Ljubljana]], [[University of Trier|Trier]] and [[University of Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 1998 he was awarded an [[List of Honorary Doctors of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology|honorary doctorate from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntnu.edu/phd/honorary-doctors|title=Honorary Doctors|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ntnu.edu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 Luckmann became an honorary member of the Slovenian Sociological Association.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The [[German Sociological Association]] awarded him a prize for his outstanding lifetime contribution to sociology at its 2002 Congress, and Luckmann became an honorary member in 2016.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9923">'''Undoing''' is a [[defense mechanism]] in which a person tries to cancel out or remove an unhealthy, destructive or otherwise threatening thought or action by engaging in contrary behavior. For example, after thinking about being violent with someone, one would then be overly nice or accommodating to them. It is one of several defense mechanisms proposed by the founder of [[psychoanalysis]] [[Sigmund Freud]] during his career, many of which were later developed further by his daughter [[Anna Freud]]. The German term "''Ungeschehenmachen''" was first used to describe this defense mechanism. When translated, it literally means ''"making un-happen"'', which is essentially the core of "undoing". Undoing refers to the phenomenon whereby a person tries to alter the past in some way to avoid or feign disappearance of an adversity or mishap.&lt;ref&gt;Laplanche, J. and Pontalis, J-B. (1973), ''The language of psycho-analysis'' (D. Nicholson-Smith, Trans). New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud's development of the concept==
Freud first described the practice of undoing in his 1909 "Notes upon a Case of Obsessional Neurosis".  Here he recounted how his patient (the "Rat Man") first removed a stone from the road in case his lady's carriage should overturn upon it, and thereafter 'felt ''obliged'' to go back and replace the stone in its original position in the middle of the road'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Studies II'' (London 1991) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;  Freud argued that his 'undoing this deed of love by replacing the stone where...her carriage might come to grief against it...was determined by a motive contrary to that which produced the first part'&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Studies'' p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; by hate, not love.

It was two decades later in 1926 that he formalised the ego defense as' ''undoing what has been done''....it is, as it were, negative magic, and endeavours, by means of motor symbolism, to ''blow away'' not merely the ''consequences'' of some event (or experience or impression) but the event itself'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (Middlesex 1987) p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;  Freud then went on to use '"undoing" what has been done...[as] good enough grounds for re-introducing the old concept of ''defence'', which can cover all these processes that have the same purpose—namely the protection of the ego against instinctual demands'&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Psychopathology'' p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;—one of the major technical advances of his later years.

==In psychoanalysis after Freud==
The first psychoanalytic half-century saw several writers exploring the concept of undoing in Freud's wake.  [[Anna Freud]] listed it among the ego mechanisms; [[Ernest Jones]] and [[Ella Freeman Sharpe]] both wrote articles linking it with 'actions and attitudes aimed at the undoing of imaginative destructions.  Strivings for reparation may...be the main motive'.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Otto Fenichel]] devoted a substantial section of his "mechanism of defense" to summarizing past work in his encyclopedic ''Theory of Neurosis'': he was especially interested in how 'the undoing sometimes does not consist in a compulsion to do the opposite of what has been done previously but in a compulsion to repeat the very same act...with the opposite unconscious meaning'.&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, ''Theory'' pp. 153–4&lt;/ref&gt;

The second half of the twentieth century saw little new theoretical or creative work around the concept.  [[Jean Laplanche]] and [[Jean-Bertrand Pontalis|J. B. Pontalis]] laid stress on how 'Undoing in the pathological sense is directed at the act's very reality, and the aim is to suppress it absolutely, as though time were reversed'.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Laplanche and J. B. Pontalis, ''The Language of Psychoanalysis'' (London 1988) p. 478&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Freud encyclopedia'' highlighted how 'Acts of expiation can be seen as forms of ''undoing''{{'}};&lt;ref&gt;Edward Erwin, ''The Freud encyclopedia'' (2002) p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Eman Vaillant]] placed undoing among the neurotic defenses in his hierarchy of [[defense mechanisms]].

Melanie Klein in her early work had written of undoing in terms of a kind of magical reparation: 'a tendency to ''undo harm'' and put objects to right magically'.&lt;ref&gt;Melanie Klein, ''Developments in Psycho-Analysis'' (London 1989) p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, however, she would use it in terms of a kind of ego disintegration—'a process of undoing, or what she called "a falling into bits"'&lt;ref&gt;Meira Likierman, ''Melanie Klein: Her Work in Context'' (2002) p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;—and it was in this latter, rather different sense of the term that later Kleinians would tend to use it: 'an invitation to dissolution and undoing...leaving the mental field open for enactment and horror'.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Sohn, in H. S. Klein/J. Symington eds., ''Imprisoned Pain and its transformation'' (London 2000) p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

==Automaticity==
There is a proposal that speaks specifically about the [[automaticity]] of this counter factual thinking. This theory, as stipulated by Medvec, Madey and Gilovich (1995) states that Undoing can occur as an automatic response to a situation. Their findings involved Olympic Silver Medalists who were less happy about their achievement than the bronze medalists, even though it is known that Silver medalists have a higher honor. To the individuals, the Silver Medal represented how close they were to winning which is worse than being awarded bronze, which signified how close they were to not having a placement at all. This suggests that the [[counterfactual thinking]] was a sort of implicit way of control and was not actually deliberately employed as a mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;Medvec, V.H., Madey, S. F. and Gilouich, T. (1995). When less is more: Counterfactual thinking and satisfaction among Olympic Medalists, ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'' '''69''', 603–610&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further uses==
Undoing can be used to 'explain away' habits or behaviors that are not in line with an individual's personality. For example, in the case of a person who is well organised in the workplace, yet always forgets to pay bills on time at home, Freudian psychologists could argue that his tardiness with bills is an undoing of his desire to be orderly, or vice versa. Freud has been criticized regarding examples such as this because his theory is so complicated that most problems can be explained by another part of the theory.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

For some people undoing can be used to reduce [[cognitive dissonance]], the uncomfortable feeling created when an attitude and an action, or two attitudes are in conflict with one another.

In [[criminal profiling]] the term refers to a pattern of behavior by which an offender tries to undo their crime symbolically, e.g. by painting the face of a person killed by the perpetrator, covering up and decorating the corpse with flowers, personal belongings and jewelry, or folding the hands, imitating a laying-out.

==Effects of positive emotions==

Happiness, joy, love, excitement are all positive emotions and there is no arguing that these emotions contribute in large to how we act, how we think, and what we do. In contrast there are also negative feelings such as sadness that can lead us to act in certain ways that may not necessarily be good. Studies have been performed that have shown that positive emotions can be used to "correct" or "undo" the effects of negative emotions. [[Barbara Fredrickson]] and Robert Levenson have come up with the undoing hypothesis. In essence what the hypothesis states is that people might hold in the effects of their positive emotions to counterbalance the effects of their negative emotions.&lt;ref name="Fredrickson"&gt;Fredrickson, B. L., Mancuso, R. A., Branigan, C. and Tugade, M. M. (2000). The undoing effect of positive emotions. ''Motivation and Emotion'' '''24''', 237–258.&lt;/ref&gt;
Overall positive emotions help lower the potentially health-damaging cardiovascular reactivity that lingers following negative emotions. This effect may be especially important for those most at risk for developing coronary heart disease.&lt;ref name="Fredrickson"/&gt;

==Effects of negative emotions==

Negative emotions, including anger and fear, can be seen as the evolution of human adaptation to survival in life-threatening situations. For example, anger shows the sign of attack, fear shows the sign of escape. These emotional reactions interconnect with our mind and body. These negative emotions are influenced by the physiological support mechanisms, such as the physical energy, that relies on the body to mobilize at an optimal level for individual action to react. In the attack or flee situation, it produces heightened cardiovascular re-activity that redistributes blood flow to relevant skeletal muscles. However, in extreme cases, negative emotions will cause damage to people's health in their cardiovascular re-activity.&lt;ref name="Fredrickson"/&gt;

== Classification ==
Undoing is tentatively classified at the "Mental inhibitions (compromise formation) level" in [[DSM-IV-TR]]'s proposed Defensive Functioning Scale (under Appendix B, "Criteria Sets and Axes Provided for Further Study.")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|edition=4th ed., text revision|page=808|publisher=American Psychiatric Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2173">'''Unspoken rules''' are [[Social behavior|behavioral]] constraints imposed in organizations or societies that are not voiced or written down.  They usually exist in unspoken and unwritten format because they form a part of the [[logical argument]] or course of action implied by [[tacit assumptions]].  Examples involving unspoken rules include unwritten and unofficial organizational hierarchies, [[organizational culture]], and acceptable behavioral [[social norm|norms]] governing interactions between organizational members.

For example, the [[Captain (nautical)|captain]] of a ship is always expected to be the last to evacuate it in a disaster. Or, as Vince Waldron wrote, "A pet, once named, instantly becomes an inseparable member of the family."&lt;ref&gt;Vince Waldron, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BCTj8iffkKAC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;dq= The Official Dick Van Dyke Show Book]'', Hal Leonard, 2001, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment and discrimination==
In the workplace, some unspoken rules can have a significant impact on one’s job satisfaction, advancement opportunities, and career trajectory.

In sports, Scottish football club, [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] until 1989 had an unwritten rule of not signing any player who was openly Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/jul/10/maurice-mo-johnston-rangers-celtic|title=Why Mo Johnston still stirs emotions across Glasgow|first=Ewan|last=Murray|date=10 July 2009|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club]] also historically had an unwritten rule that cricketers could only play for them if they were born within the historical county boundaries of [[Yorkshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090719172208/www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/new-yorkshire-ready-to-restore-forgotten-glories-676410.html|title='New' Yorkshire ready to restore forgotten glories - Cricket, Sport - The Independent|date=19 July 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''This article is on the Woman's Peace Party, a forerunner of the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]].''

The '''Woman's Peace Party''' ('''WPP''') was an American [[Pacifism|pacifist]] and [[First-wave feminism|feminist]] organization formally established in January 1915 in response to [[World War I]]. The organization is remembered as the first American peace organization to make use of [[direct action]] tactics such as public demonstration. The Woman's Peace Party became the American section of an international organization known as the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace later in 1915, a group which later changed its name to the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]].

==American pacifist forerunners==


Prior to the establishment of the Woman's Peace Party, the three leading American pacifist organizations of national stature were essentially [[conservatism|conservative]] enterprises, viewing the peace movement's mission as one of extending stability, order, and the expansion of venerable American institutions.&lt;ref name="Marchand182"&gt;C. Roland Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918.'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1972; pg. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Peace Society]] (BBC), established in 1828, was the oldest of the previously existing pacifist organizations and suffered from what one historian has called "over seven decades of accumulated [[Victorian America|Victorianism]].&lt;ref name="Marchand5"&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Typified by the detached conservative nobility of corporate attorney [[Elihu Root]], the APS was dedicated to demonstrating the incompatibility between war and [[Christianity]] and throughout its existence had remained small, impoverished, and ineffectual.&lt;ref name="Marchand5" /&gt; By the time of World War I, it had been reduced in status to that of a veritable subsidiary of the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]].

The Carnegie Endowment was launched by [[industrialist]] [[Andrew Carnegie]] in 1910 with a $10 million endowment.&lt;ref name="Marchand101"&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pg. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; The Endowment became effectively a university publishing house for the peace movement, concentrating on academic research and the printed word rather than oratory.&lt;ref name="Marchand102"&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pg. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third of the primary American peace organizations of the first decade of the 20th Century was the [[World Peace Foundation]] (WPF), a group established in 1909 by millionaire Boston publisher [[Edwin Ginn]] as "Edwin Ginn's International School for Peace."&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pp. 100-101.&lt;/ref&gt; This organization was launched with a $1 million endowment and carried on publishing activities, changing its name to the WPF in 1911.&lt;ref name="Marchand101" /&gt; As with the Carnegie Foundation, the WPF limited its activities largely to research and publication, attempting to influence political decision-makers with ideas rather than to stir the fires of popular sentiment.

Much like the [[trust (monopoly)|trustified]] world of big business of the day, the peace movement was characterized by [[interlocking directorate]]s of the various organizations, with a very few men and no women wielding decisive influence over the movement by virtue of the power of the pocketbook.&lt;ref name="Marchand102" /&gt; The American peace movement was, in short, part of the [[political establishment]], with dinner meetings of the New York Peace Society likened by one contemporary to "a banquet of the [[Chamber of Commerce]]."&lt;ref&gt;The words are those of Frederick Lynch, 1911, cited in Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pg. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the establishment of a permanent organization did not follow for more than four months, the roots of the Woman's Peace Party lay in a protest march of 1500 women in [[New York City]] on August 29, 1914.&lt;ref name="Marchand182" /&gt; This "Woman's Peace Parade" was organized less than a month after the outbreak of hostilities in World War I and featured a silent procession down [[Fifth Avenue]] behind a white banner bearing a dove in front of somber crowds lining the streets.&lt;ref name=Marchand182 /&gt;

The chair of the Woman's Peace Parade committee was [[Fanny Garrison Villard]], a 70-year-old veteran of the peace movement.&lt;ref name="Marchand189"&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pg. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Her son, [[Oswald Garrison Villard]], later recalled the scene:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"There were no bands; there was dead silence and the crowds watched the parade in the spirit of the marchers, with sympathy and approval. The President had also approved, for the organizers, in complete sympathy with his public statements of the early days of the conflict, had courteously asked him for his consent. He was especially pleased by the decision of the paraders to carry no flags except the peace flag and to have no set speeches at the conclusion of the parade, but brief informal addresses were made to all who would listed....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
"The silence, the dignity, the black dresses of the marchers — those who did not have black dresses wore black arm bands — the solemnity of the crowds, all of these produced a profound effect on the beholders."&lt;ref&gt;Oswald Garrison Villard, ''Fighting Years: A Memoir.'' New York: Harcourt, Brace and Co., 1939; pg. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Woman's Peace Parade marked a change of methods of the peace movement. Older American peace organizations limited themselves to working behind the scenes, attempting to influence policy through regular political channels.&lt;ref name=Marchand183&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pg. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; The Peace Parade, on the other hand, made use of [[direct action]], attempting to build popular support for peace through public demonstration in the same way that [[trade union|labor organizations]] had historically fought for policies and settlements which were important to them.&lt;ref name="Marchand183" /&gt; With this tactical shift, the Woman's Peace Parade and the organization which emerged from it, the Woman's Peace Party, effectively marked the beginning of the modern peace movement.&lt;ref name="Alonso1993"&gt;{{cite book|author= Harriet Hyman Alonso |title=Peace As a Women's Issue: A History of the U.S. Movement for World Peace and Women's Rights|year=1993|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-0269-9 |chapter= Partial Chronology of the Metropolitan New York Branch of WILPF |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=FZJxg8gQThoC&amp;pg=PA279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the march, Fanny Garrison Villard sought to transform the temporary organization constructed to coordinate the march into a permanent group. Villard called upon one of her old rivals in the women's movement, [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], President of the [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]] to help in this regard.&lt;ref name="Marchand189" /&gt; Catt, a former associate of [[Susan B. Anthony]], was fixated upon the struggle for women's right to vote and did not see the peace march as a likely vehicle for a change of public sentiment or national policy.&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pp. 189-190.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, Catt was won over to the idea that the American suffrage movement stood to gain in support and stature if women could gain a prominent role in the noble struggle for an end to the European bloodbath.&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pg. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of December 1914, Catt was finally persuaded to give full effort for the launch of a national women's peace organization.&lt;ref name="Marchand193"&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pg. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote to [[settlement house|settlement worker]] [[Jane Addams]] of [[Hull House]] in Chicago, attempting to bring her into the forthcoming organization as its leader.&lt;ref name="Marchand193" /&gt; Addams had long believed in a close interrelationship between international peace, domestic humanitarian reform, and women's right to vote and was won over to the idea of a national women's peace movement.&lt;ref name="Marchand193" /&gt; The stage was set for a formal launch of the new organization — a group to be called the Woman's Peace Party.

==Foundation convention==

The Woman's Peace Party was established at an organizational convention held in [[Washington, DC]] on January 9–10, 1915.&lt;ref name="Survey150123"&gt;"A Woman's Peace Party Full Fledged for Action," ''The Survey,'' vol. 33, no. 17 (January 23, 1915), pp. 433-434.&lt;/ref&gt; The gathering was attended by more than 100 delegates representing women's organizations from around the United States.&lt;ref name="Survey150123" /&gt;

Jane Addams was elected President of the new organization by the convention and given the power to select a Secretary and Treasurer for the group, which was to be headquartered in Addams' home city of [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name="Survey150123" /&gt; Membership in the new organization was open to all groups willing to repurpose themselves also as a "peace circle" and to any woman paying a $1 annual membership fee.&lt;ref name="Survey150123" /&gt; Officers ultimately included [[Lucia Ames Mead]] as National Secretary, [[Harriet P. Thomas]] as Executive Secretary, [[Sophonisba Breckinridge|Sophonisba P. Breckinridge]] as Treasurer, and [[Elizabeth Glendower Evans]] as National Organizer.&lt;ref name="Barr"&gt;Eleanor Barr, [http://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/DG026-050/dg043wilpf/Part%20I-WPPhistory.htm "Woman's Peace Party, 1915-20 Finding Aid: Historical Introduction,"] Women's International League for Peace and Freedom Collection DG043, Swarthmore College Library, Swarthmore, PA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention approved a platform calling for the immediate convocation of "a convention of [[neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] nations in the interest of an early peace," the limitation of armaments, organized opposition to [[militarism]] (or [[military intervention]])&lt;ref&gt;https://www.americamagazine.org/arts-culture/2017/04/06/examining-american-peace-movement-prior-world-war-i&lt;/ref&gt; in America, democratization of foreign policy, removal of the economic motivation for war, and the expansion of the [[woman suffrage|electoral franchise for women]].&lt;ref name="Survey150123" /&gt; The right of women to vote was seen by the female participants in the organization as part-and-parcel of the cause for peace, based on the presumption that women were inclined by nature to be oriented towards the nurturing of human life.&lt;ref name=Marchand186&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pg. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding convention also approved a supplemental "Program for Constructive Peace" which demanded that the American government to call a conference of neutral nations and declared that, failing that, "the party itself will call an unofficial conference of pacifists from the world over" to determine a course of action.&lt;ref name="Survey150123" /&gt; To ensure that the current war was not merely a prelude for another, the program called for a peace based upon no transfers of territory without the will of the involved people, no [[indemnity|indemnities]] to be assessed outside those in accordance with international law, and no treaties between nations to be established without ratification of representatives of the people.&lt;ref name="Survey150123" /&gt;

Activities concluded with a mass meeting held in the ballroom of the New Willard Hotel on Sunday, January 10, which was filled to capacity.&lt;ref name="Survey150123" /&gt; An additional overflow meeting was held in another room but still some 500 interested people had to be turned away for lack of space.&lt;ref name="Survey150123" /&gt; Speeches were delivered to this gathering by Jane Addams, and [[feminism|feminist]] activists [[Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence]] of England, [[Rosika Schwimmer]] of Hungary, among others.&lt;ref name="Survey150123" /&gt;

==1915 International Congress of Women==

[[File:Noordam-delegates-1915.jpg|thumb|right|Delegates to the April 1915 Women's International Congress for Peace and Freedom aboard the ''MS Noordam'' with their blue and white "PEACE" banner]]
The ongoing war in Europe forced the cancellation of the scheduled biennial convention of the [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]], which had been slated for [[Berlin]] in 1915.&lt;ref name=Garrison88&gt;Dee Garrison, ''Mary Heaton Vorse: The Life of an American Insurgent.'' Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1989; pg. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The cancellation of the German gathering provided an opportunity for the women's peace movement to hold an international gathering of their own, and a call was issued for a convention to be held in the neutral [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="Garrison88" /&gt; Jane Addams, President of the Woman's Peace Party and arguably the most respected and influential woman in America was invited to preside over the conclave.&lt;ref name="Garrison88" /&gt;

In April 1915, 47 women, including many members of the Woman's Peace Party along with representatives of other organizations, boarded the Dutch cruise ship the ''MS Noordam'' for the dangerous journey to [[The Hague]].&lt;ref name="Alonso66"&gt;Harriet Hyman Alonso, ''Peace as a Women's Issue: A History of the US Movement for World Peace and Women's Rights.'' Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1993; pg. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Among those making the trip through mine-strewn waters were social worker [[Grace Abbott]], [[epidemiologist]] [[Alice Hamilton]], radical trade unionist [[Leonora O'Reilly]], and academic and future [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Emily Balch]].&lt;ref name="Garrison88" /&gt;

The trip was not without controversy, despite America's formally neutral status, with former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] declaring the women's mission "silly and base"" and calling the women cowards who sought peace "without regard to righteousness."&lt;ref name="Garrison88" /&gt; The American women were not dissuaded, sailing into danger with a homemade blue and white banner that bore the single word, "PEACE."&lt;ref name="Garrison88" /&gt;

The ''Noordam'' was held up for four days in the [[English Channel]] by the [[Royal Navy]] but was ultimately allowed to proceed to The Hague, which it arrived barely in time for the start of the three-day congress on the evening of April 28, 1915.&lt;ref name="Garrison91"&gt;Garrison, ''Mary Heaton Vorse,'' pg. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the decision of some combatant nations, such as Great Britain, to deny its citizens passports which would have allowed them to participate in the Congress, the gathering still proved to be a massive event, bringing together 1,136 delegates and more than 2,000 visitors.&lt;ref name="Garrison91" /&gt;

The congress drafted a series of resolutions detailing plans for a just peace, calling for general [[disarmament]] and the removal of the profit motive through nationalizing the production of armaments, and asserting the benefits of [[free trade]] and [[freedom of navigation]] on the high seas.&lt;ref name="Garrison92"&gt;Garrison, ''Mary Heaton Vorse,'' pg. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; A resolution calling for continuous [[mediation]] of disputes by a conference of neutral nations was passed, but ultimately failed to come to fruition.&lt;ref name=Garrison92 /&gt; A delegation headed by Addams was dispatched to the capitals of the belligerent powers but it, too, proved ineffectual.&lt;ref name="Garrison92" /&gt;

Before adjourning, the congress established a new international organization called the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace.&lt;ref name="Barr" /&gt; The Woman's Peace Party came to regard itself as the American section of this organization.

==Name change==

In 1921 the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace formally changed its name to the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom.
