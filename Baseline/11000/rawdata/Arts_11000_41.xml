==Overview==
Scholar [[F. O. Matthiessen]] originated the phrase "American Renaissance" in his 1941 book ''American Renaissance: Art and Expression in the Age of Emerson and Whitman''. The thematic center of the American Renaissance was what Matthiessen called the "devotion" of all five of his writers to "the possibilities of democracy". He presented the American Renaissance texts as "literature for our democracy” and challenged the nation to repossess them.&lt;ref&gt;Lauter, Paul. [https://books.google.com/books?id=HGSf-VpoGIsC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=American+renaissance+%22possibilities+of+democracy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_3P5TPrRLciSswa24LC-Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=American%20renaissance%20%22possibilities%20of%20democracy%22&amp;f=false ''A Companion to American Literature and Culture'']. Chichester; Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2010: 68 {{ISBN|0-631-20892-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often considered a movement centered in New England, the American Renaissance was inspired in part by a new focus on [[humanism]] as a way to move from [[Calvinism]].&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Daniel Walker. ''What Hath God Wrought? The Transformation of America, 1815–1848''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2007: 615. {{ISBN|978-0-19-507894-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Literary nationalists at this time were calling for a movement that would develop a unique American literary style to distinguish American literature from British literature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Walter Channing in a November 1815 issue of the ''[[North American Review]]'' called for the people to form "a literature of our own", which was later echoed by other literary critics.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Following this call, there was a wave of literary nationalism in America for much of the 1820s that saw writers such as [[Washington Irving]], [[William Cullen Bryant]], and [[James Fenimore Cooper]] become the identity of writers worthy of American literature.  From this wave of literary nationalism the American Renaissance can be seen as being born.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Criticisms ==
There are many criticisms associated with the American Renaissance, and some critics question if it ever actually took place. One of the most prominent criticisms is that authors during this period are seen as simply taking styles and ideas from past movements and culture and reforming them into new, contemporary works.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Beneath the American Renaissance|last = Reynolds|first = David|publisher = Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.|year = 1988|isbn = 9780394544489|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics say that authors fail to address major political issues during this period, such as slavery, even as they had large influence on the writing of the time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  There is also criticism that women authors and women's issues were generally left out of discussion and publication.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The notion of an American Renaissance has been criticized for overemphasizing a small number of white male writers and artifacts of high culture.&lt;ref&gt;Buell, Lawrence. [https://books.google.com/books?id=nPgRcKfZebwC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=%22american+renaissance%22+%22white+male+writers%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=y_TWTOLSGpHDswa3y9iDCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22american%20renaissance%22%20%22white%20male%20writers%22&amp;f=false ''Emerson'']. Cambridge and London: Harvard University Press, 2003: 145.&lt;/ref&gt; William E. Cain noted the "extreme white male formation" of Matthiessen's list of authors and stated that by "devoting hundreds of pages of analysis and celebration to five white male authors, Matthiessen unwittingly prefigured in his book what later readers would dispute and labor to correct."&lt;ref&gt;Cain, William E. [https://books.google.com/books?id=G1TowJSnxrgC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=%22american+renaissance%22+%22male+authors%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XffWTOTkGY7Eswah18SICA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22american%20renaissance%22%20%22male%20authors%22&amp;f=false ''F.O. Matthiessen and the Politics of Criticism'']. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1988: 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics argue that literature written by women during this period was not as popular as first thought, and that it took a distant second place in popularity to works written by men.  Matthiessen and other scholars are even known to exclude women and minority authors, especially African Americans.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Norton Anthology of American Literature|last = Baym|publisher = W.W. Norton &amp; Company|year = |isbn = 0393918858|location = New York|pages = 445–463|chapter = American Literature 1820-1865|last2 = Levine}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics also argue that there is no separate style or genre, such as sentimental-domestic fiction, distinguished by gender.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  However, other critics point out that the most read authors of the time were women, such as [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] and [[Fanny Fern]] &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://dcc.newberry.org/collections/the-american-renaissance-in-context|title = The American Renaissance in Context|date = 2014|access-date = November 10, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = Howe|first = Lawrence|last2 = Layson|first2 = Hana}}&lt;/ref&gt; and criticize Matthiessen for not including women in the original canon.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The demographic exclusivity of the American Renaissance began eroding among scholars toward the end of the twentieth century. They have included [[Emily Dickinson]] in the canon; she started writing poetry in the late 1850s. [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]’s ''[[Uncle Tom’s Cabin]]'' (1852) rose to a prominent reputation in the late 1970s. African-American literature, including [[slave narratives]] by such masters as [[Frederick Douglass]], and early novels by [[William Wells Brown]], has gained increasing recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrett, Gene Andrew. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jii8XeIKtA0C&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=%22american+renaissance%22+%22white+male+authors%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MPbWTPrINM7ysgbPs7DVCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22american%20renaissance%22%20%22white%20male%20authors%22&amp;f=false ''A Companion to African American Literature'']. Chichester, U.K.; Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2010: 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable authors==
Most often associated with the American Renaissance movement are 
[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s ''[[Representative Men]]'' and ''[[Self-Reliance]]'', 
[[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' and ''[[The House of Seven Gables]]'',
[[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'',
[[Henry David Thoreau]]'s ''[[Walden]]'', and
[[Walt Whitman]]'s'' [[Leaves of Grass]]''.  Most of the main writers associated with the American Renaissance were actually rather unknown during this time and had small followings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Other authors were later added to this list and found to have contributed to this movement.  These include:
[[Edgar Allan Poe]],
[[Harriet Beecher Stowe]],
[[Emily Dickinson]],
[[Frederick Douglass]],
[[William Wells Brown]],
[[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], and
[[John Greenleaf Whittier]] among others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Antisemitism may be manifested in many ways, ranging from expressions of hatred of or discrimination against individual Jews to organized [[pogrom]]s by mobs, state police, or even military attacks on entire Jewish communities. Although the term did not come into common usage until the 19th century, it is now also applied to historic anti-Jewish incidents. Notable instances of [[Persecution of Jews|persecution]] include the [[Rhineland massacres]] preceding the [[First Crusade]] in 1096, the [[Edict of Expulsion]] from England in 1290, the [[History of the Jews in Spain#Massacres and mass conversions of 1391|massacres of Spanish Jews]] in 1391, the persecutions of the [[Spanish Inquisition]], the [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion from Spain]] in 1492, the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising#Jews|Cossack massacres in Ukraine]] from 1648 to 1657, various [[anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire]] between 1821 and 1906, the 1894–1906 [[Dreyfus affair]] in France, [[the Holocaust]] in [[Nazi Germany|German-occupied Europe]] during [[World War II]], [[antisemitism in the Soviet Union|Soviet anti-Jewish policies]], and Arab and Muslim involvement in the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries]].

The root word ''[[Wikt:Semite|Semite]]'' gives the [[misnomer|false impression]] that antisemitism is directed against all [[Semitic people]], ''e.g.'', including [[Arabs]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]. The compound word ''antisemite'' was popularized in Germany in 1879{{sfn|Bein|1990|p=595}} as a scientific-sounding term for ''Judenhass'' ("Jew-hatred"),{{sfn|Chanes|2004|p=150}}{{sfn|Rattansi|2007|p=4–5}}{{sfn|Roth|2003|p=30}}{{sfn|Johnston|1983|p=27}}&lt;ref name=laqueur1&gt;{{harvp|Laqueur|2006}}.

[[File:Statuten der Antisemiten-Liga.jpg|thumb|1879 statute of the Antisemitic League]]

The origin of "antisemitic" terminologies is found in the responses of [[Moritz Steinschneider]] to the views of [[Ernest Renan]]. As [[Alex Bein]] writes: "The compound anti-Semitism appears to have been used first by Steinschneider, who challenged Renan on account of his 'anti-Semitic prejudices' [i.e., his derogation of the "Semites" as a [[Race (human categorization)|race]]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cQOn0y8ENg4C&amp;pg=PA594 |last=Bein |first=Alex |author-link=Alex Bein |title=The Jewish Question: Biography of a World Problem |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |year=1990 |page=594 |isbn=0-8386-3252-1 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avner Falk]] similarly writes: 'The German word ''antisemitisch'' was first used in 1860 by the Austrian Jewish scholar Moritz Steinschneider (1816–1907) in the phrase ''antisemitische Vorurteile'' (antisemitic prejudices). Steinschneider used this phrase to characterise the French philosopher Ernest Renan's false ideas about how "[[Semitic people#Ethnicity and race|Semitic races]]" were inferior to "[[Aryan race]]s"'.&lt;ref name="'The ''antisemitisch'' 18 60 (1816-1907) ''antisemitische Vorurteile'' (antisemitic prejudices).

[[Pseudoscience|Pseudoscientific]] theories concerning race, civilization, and "progress" had become quite widespread in Europe in the second half of the 19th century, especially as [[Prussia]]n nationalistic historian [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] did much to promote this form of racism. He coined the phrase "the Jews are our misfortune" which would later be widely used by [[Nazism|Nazis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Poliakov |first=Léon |author-link=Léon Poliakov |title=The History of Anti-Semitism, Vol. 3: From Voltaire to Wagner |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2003 |page=404 |isbn=978-0-8122-1865-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Avner Falk, Treitschke uses the term "Semitic" almost synonymously with "Jewish", in contrast to Renan's use of it to refer to a whole range of peoples,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Falk |first=Avner |year=2008 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWL4ja2BbnEC&amp;pg=PA21 |title=Anti-Semitism: A History and Psychoanalysis of Contemporary Hatred |location=Westport, Conn. |publisher=Praeger |page=21 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; based generally on linguistic criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brustein |first=William I. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hc3HabBQsdsC&amp;pg=PA118 |title=Roots of Hate: Anti-Semitism in Europe before the Holocaust |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |page=118 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jonathan M. Hess, the term was originally used by its authors to "stress the radical difference between their own 'antisemitism' and earlier forms of antagonism toward Jews and Judaism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jonathan M. |last=Hess |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/18229 |title=Johann David Michaelis and the Colonial Imaginary: Orientalism and the Emergence of Racial Antisemitism in Eighteenth-Century Germany |journal=Jewish Social Studies |volume=6 |number=2 |date=Winter 2000 |pages=56–101 |doi=10.1353/jss.2000.0003 |quote=When the term "antisemitism" was first introduced in Germany in the late 1870s, those who used it did so in order to stress the radical difference between their own "antisemitism" and earlier forms of antagonism toward Jews and Judaism. |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bookcover-1880-Marr-German uber Juden.jpg|thumb|Cover page of Marr's ''The Way to Victory of Germanicism over Judaism'', 1880 edition]]

In 1879 German journalist [[Wilhelm Marr]] published a pamphlet, ''Der Sieg des Judenthums über das Germanenthum. Vom nicht confessionellen Standpunkt aus betrachtet'' (''The Victory of the Jewish Spirit over the Germanic Spirit. Observed from a non-religious perspective'') in which he used the word ''Semitismus'' interchangeably with the word ''Judentum'' to denote both "Jewry" (the Jews as a collective) and "jewishness" (the quality of being Jewish, or the Jewish spirit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jaspal |first=Rusi |year=2014 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qS_jBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT38 |title=Antisemitism and Anti-Zionism: Representation, Cognition and Everyday Talk |location=Farnham, Surrey |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |chapter=Antisemitism: Conceptual Issues |access-date=27 October 2018}} Jaspal erroneously gives the date of publication as 1873.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Marr|Marr, Wilhelm]].

Rudolph Costenoble. 1879, 8th edition/printing. Archive.org. Marr uses the word "Semitismus" (Semitism) on pages 7, 11, 14, 30, 32, and 46; for example, one finds in the conclusion the following passage: "Ja, ich bin überzeutgt, ich habe ausgesprochen, was Millionen Juden im Stillen denken: Dem Semitismus gehört die Weltherrschaft!" (Yes, I am convinced that I have articulated what millions of Jews are quietly thinking: World domination belongs to Semitism!) (p. 46).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Marr |first=Wilhem |author-link=Wilhelm Marr |url=http://www.kevinmacdonald.net/Marr-Text-English.pdf |title=The Victory of Judaism over Germanism: Viewed from a Nonreligious Point of View |translator-first=Gerhard |translator-last=Rohringer |year=1879 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This use of ''[[Wikt:Semitismus|Semitismus]]'' was followed by a coining of "[[Wikt:Antisemitismus|Antisemitismus]]" which was used to indicate opposition to the Jews as a people{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} and opposition to the Jewish spirit, which Marr interpreted as infiltrating German culture. His next pamphlet, ''Der Weg zum Siege des Germanenthums über das Judenthum'' (''The Way to Victory of the Germanic Spirit over the Jewish Spirit'', 1880), presents a development of Marr's ideas further and may present the first published use of the German word '' Antisemitismus'', "antisemitism".

The pamphlet became very popular, and in the same year he founded the ''Antisemiten-Liga'' (League of Antisemites),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wilhelm Marr |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/wilhelm-marr |website=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; apparently named to follow the "Anti-Kanzler-Liga" (Anti-Chancellor League).&lt;ref name="MZ1987"/&gt; The league was the first German organization committed specifically to combating the alleged threat to Germany and German culture posed by the Jews and their influence, and advocating their [[population transfer|forced removal]] from the country.

So far as can be ascertained, the word was first widely printed in 1881, when Marr published ''Zwanglose Antisemitische Hefte'', and [[Wilhelm Scherer]] used the term ''Antisemiten'' in the January issue of ''[[Neue Freie Presse]]''.

The [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] reports, "In February 1881, a correspondent of the ''[[Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums]]'' speaks of 'Anti-Semitism' as a designation which recently came into use ("Allg. Zeit. d. Jud." 1881, p.&amp;nbsp;138). On 19 July 1882, the editor says, 'This quite recent Anti-Semitism is hardly three years old.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Jewish Encyclopedia |title=Anti-Semitism |first=Gotthard |last=Deutsch |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1603-anti-semitism  |publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls |page=641 (A) |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The related term "[[Philo-Semitism|philosemitism]]" was coined around 1885.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Usage===
From the outset the term anti-Semitism bore special racial connotations and meant specifically prejudice against [[Jews]].&lt;ref name="MWdef" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JustJews" /&gt; The term is confusing, for in modern usage 'Semitic' designates a language group, not a race. In this sense, the term is a misnomer, since there are many speakers of [[Semitic languages]] (e.g. [[Arabs]], [[Ethiopian Semitic languages|Ethiopians]], and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]) who are not the objects of anti-Semitic prejudices, while there are many Jews who do not speak [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], a Semitic language. Though 'antisemitism' has been used to describe [[prejudice]] against people who speak other Semitic languages,  the validity of such usage has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Benjamin |last=Isaac |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eem1AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA442 |title=The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2004 |page=442 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=David Matas |last=Matas |first=David |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYR7SqcMe9gC&amp;pg=PA34 |title=Aftershock: Anti-Zionism and Antisemitism |publisher=Dundurn Press |year=2005 |page=34 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lewis|1999|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term may be spelled with or without a hyphen (antisemitism or anti-Semitism). Some scholars favor the unhyphenated form because, "If you use the hyphenated form, you consider the words 'Semitism', 'Semite', 'Semitic' as meaningful" whereas "in antisemitic parlance, 'Semites' really stands for Jews, just that."&lt;ref name="Almog"&gt;{{cite web |last=Almog |first=Shmuel |url=https://astro.temple.edu/~hfreiden/Antisemitism/whatis.htm |title=What's in a Hyphen? |access-date=27 October 2018}}, SICSA Report: Newsletter of the [[Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism]] (Summer 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Power of Myth |url=https://www.facinghistory.org/campus/reslib.nsf/99ca830bb4f483948525717f005abfc7/2820f36c177cc758852571860065e8c2/$FILE/complete_antisemitism.pdf |website=Facing History |access-date=27 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305002701/http://www2.facinghistory.org/Campus/reslib.nsf/99ca830bb4f483948525717f005abfc7/2820f36c177cc758852571860065e8c2/%24FILE/complete_antisemitism.pdf |archive-date=5 March 2009 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bauer"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bauer |first1=Yehuda |title=Problems of Contemporary Antisemitism |url=http://humwww.ucsc.edu/jewishstudies/docs/YBauerLecture.pdf |access-date=27 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307094003/http://humwww.ucsc.edu/jewishstudies/docs/YBauerLecture.pdf |archive-date=7 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bauer2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bauer |first=Yehuda |title=A History of the Holocaust |publisher=Franklin Watts |year=1982 |page=52 |isbn=0-531-05641-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Emil Fackenheim]] supported the unhyphenated spelling, in order to "[dispel] the notion that there is an entity 'Semitism' which 'anti-Semitism' opposes."&lt;ref name=Fackenheim&gt;{{harvp|Prager|Telushkin|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VK0llzUqQ2YC&amp;pg=PA199 199]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others endorsing an unhyphenated term for the same reason include Padraic O'Hare, professor of Religious and Theological Studies and Director of the Center for the Study of Jewish-Christian-Muslim Relations at [[Merrimack College]]; [[Yehuda Bauer]], professor of [[Holocaust studies]] at the Avraham Harman Institute of Contemporary Jewry at [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]; and [[James Carroll (author)|James Carroll]], historian and novelist. According to Carroll, who first cites O'Hare and Bauer on "the existence of something called 'Semitism'", "the hyphenated word thus reflects the bipolarity that is at the heart of the problem of antisemitism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=James |author-link=James Carroll (author) |title=Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews |publisher=Mariner |location=New York |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n7EUdvSQs70C&amp;pg=PT421 |isbn=978-0618219087 |pages=628–629 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objections to the usage of the term, such as the obsolete nature of the term Semitic as a racial term, have been raised since at least the 1930s.&lt;ref name="MZ1987"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zimmermann |first=Moshe |title=Wilhelm Marr: The Patriarch of Anti-Semitism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tYW013SjKM4C&amp;pg=PA112 |year=1987 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-536495-8 |page=112 |access-date=27 October 2018 |quote=The term "anti-Semitism" was unsuitable from the beginning for the real essence of Jew-hatred, which remained anchored, more or less, in the Christian tradition even when it moved via the natural sciences, into racism. It is doubtful whether the term which was first publicizes in an institutional context (the Anti-Semitic League) would have appeared at all if the "Anti-Chancellor League," which fought Bismarck's policy, had not been in existence since 1875. The founders of the new Organization adopted the elements of "anti" and "league," and searched for the proper term: Marr exchanged the term "Jew" for "Semite" which he already favored. It is possible that the shortened form "Sem" is used with such frequency and ease by Marr (and in his writings) due to its literary advantage and because it reminded Marr of Sem Biedermann, his Jewish employer from the Vienna period.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sevenster1975"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sevenster |first=Jan Nicolaas |title=The Roots of Pagan Anti-Semitism in the Ancient World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLE3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |access-date=27 October 2018 |year=1975 |publisher=Brill Archive |isbn=978-90-04-04193-6 |pages=1–2 |quote=It has long been realised that there are objections to the term anti-Semitism and therefore an endeavour has been made to find a word which better interprets the meaning intended. Already in 1936 Bolkestein, for example, wrote an article on ''Het "antisemietisme" in de oudheid'' (Anti-Semitism in the ancient world) in which the word was placed between quotation marks and a preference was expressed for the term hatred of the Jews… Nowadays the term anti-Judaism is often preferred. It certainly expresses better than anti-Semitism the fact that it concerns the attitude to the Jews and avoids any suggestion of racial distinction, which was not or hardly, a factor of any significance in ancient times. For this reason Leipoldt preferred to speak of anti-Judaism when writing his ''Antisemitsmus in der alien Welt'' (l933). Bonsirven also preferred this word to Anti-Semitism, "mot moderne qui implique une théorie des races".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definition===
Though the general definition of antisemitism is hostility or prejudice against Jews, and, according to [[Olaf Blaschke]], has become an "umbrella term for negative stereotypes about Jews",&lt;ref name="pogromsriots"&gt;{{cite book |first=Sonja |last=Weinberg |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0HDeEPouQm0C&amp;pg=PA18 |title=Pogroms and Riots: German Press Responses to Anti-Jewish Violence in Germany and Russia (1881–1882) |publisher=Peter Lang |year=2010 |access-date=27 October 2018 |isbn=9783631602140}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}} a number of authorities have developed more formal definitions.

Holocaust scholar and [[City University of New York]] professor [[Helen Fein]] defines it as "a persisting latent structure of hostile beliefs towards Jews as a collective manifested in individuals as attitudes, and in culture as myth, ideology, folklore and imagery, and in actions—social or legal discrimination, political mobilization against the Jews, and collective or state violence—which results in and/or is designed to distance, displace, or destroy Jews as Jews."

Elaborating on Fein's definition, Dietz Bering of the [[University of Cologne]] writes that, to antisemites, "Jews are not only partially but totally bad by nature, that is, their bad traits are incorrigible. Because of this bad nature: (1) Jews have to be seen not as individuals but as a collective. (2) Jews remain essentially alien in the surrounding societies. (3) Jews bring disaster on their 'host societies' or on the whole world, they are doing it secretly, therefore the anti-Semites feel obliged to unmask the conspiratorial, bad Jewish character."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Falk|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zL_0WOiZj0oC&amp;pg=PA5 5]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Sonja Weinberg, as distinct from economic and religious [[anti-Judaism]], antisemitism in its modern form shows conceptual innovation, a resort to 'science' to defend itself, new functional forms and organisational differences. It was anti-liberal, racialist and nationalist. It promoted the myth that [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|Jews conspired to 'judaise' the world]]; it served to consolidate social identity; it channeled dissatisfactions among victims of the capitalist system; and it was used as a conservative cultural code to fight emancipation and liberalism.&lt;ref name="pogromsriots" /&gt;{{rp|18–19}}

[[File:Antisemiticroths.jpg|thumb|Caricature by C.Léandre (France, 1898) showing [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] with the world in his hands]]
[[Bernard Lewis]] defines antisemitism as a special case of prejudice, hatred, or persecution directed against people who are in some way different from the rest. According to Lewis, antisemitism is marked by two distinct features: Jews are judged according to a standard different from that applied to others, and they are accused of "cosmic evil." Thus, "it is perfectly possible to hate and even to persecute Jews without necessarily being anti-Semitic" unless this hatred or persecution displays one of the two features specific to antisemitism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[[Bernard Lewis|Lewis, Bernard]]. [http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/21832.html "The New Anti-Semitism"], ''The American Scholar'', Volume 75 No. 1, Winter 2006, pp. 25–36. The paper is based on a lecture delivered at [[Brandeis University]] on 24 March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a number of efforts by international and governmental bodies to define antisemitism formally. The [[United States Department of State]] states that "while there is no universally accepted definition, there is a generally clear understanding of what the term encompasses." For the purposes of its 2005 Report on Global Anti-Semitism, the term was considered to mean "hatred toward Jews—individually and as a group—that can be attributed to the Jewish religion and/or ethnicity."&lt;ref name=USDS&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/40258.htm "Report on Global Anti-Semitism"], [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], 5 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and [[Xenophobia]] (now [[Fundamental Rights Agency]]), then an agency of the [[European Union]], developed a more detailed [[EUMC Working Definition of Antisemitism|working definition]], which states: "Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities." It also adds that "such manifestations could also target the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity," but that "criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic." It provides contemporary examples of ways in which antisemitism may manifest itself, including: promoting the harming of Jews in the name of an ideology or religion; promoting negative stereotypes of Jews; holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of an individual Jewish person or group; [[Holocaust denial|denying the Holocaust]] or accusing Jews or Israel of exaggerating it; and accusing Jews of [[dual loyalty]] or a greater allegiance to Israel than their own country. It also lists ways in which attacking Israel could be antisemitic, and states that denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor, can be a manifestation of antisemitism—as can applying double standards by requiring of Israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation, or holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of the State of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1879, [[Wilhelm Marr]] founded the ''Antisemiten-Liga'' (Anti-Semitic League).&lt;ref&gt;Richard S.

For example, [[Karl Lueger]], the popular mayor of [[fin de siècle]] [[Vienna]], skillfully exploited antisemitism as a way of channeling public discontent to his political advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Geehr. ''Karl Lueger, Mayor of Fin-de-Siècle Vienna'', Wayne State University Press, Detroit, 1989. {{ISBN|0-8143-2055-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 1910 obituary of Lueger, ''The New York Times'' notes that Lueger was "Chairman of the Christian Social Union of the Parliament and of the Anti-Semitic Union of the Diet of Lower Austria.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1910/03/11/archives/dr-karl-lueger-dead-antisemitic-leader-and-mayor-of-vienna-was-66.html Dr. Karl Lueger Dead; Anti-Semitic Leader and Mayor of Vienna Was 66 Years Old.] ''The New York Times'', 11 March 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895 [[A. C. Cuza]] organized the ''Alliance Anti-semitique Universelle'' in Bucharest. In the period before [[World War II]], when animosity towards Jews was far more commonplace, it was not uncommon for a person, an organization, or a political party to self-identify as an antisemite or antisemitic.

The early [[Zionism|Zionist]] pioneer [[Leon Pinsker]], a professional physician, preferred the clinical-sounding term ''Judeophobia'' to antisemitism, which he regarded as a misnomer. The word ''Judeophobia'' first appeared in his pamphlet "[[Auto-Emancipation]]", published anonymously in German in September 1882, where it was described as an irrational fear or hatred of Jews. According to Pinsker, this irrational fear was an inherited predisposition.&lt;ref name="Bartlett2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Steven J.|title=The Pathology of Man: A Study of Human Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U5KQ0Yi76GMC&amp;pg=PA30|accessdate=2 June 2015|year=2005|publisher=Charles C Thomas Publisher|isbn=9780398075576|pages=30–}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|Judeophobia is a form of demonopathy, with the distinction that the Jewish ghost has become known to the whole race of mankind, not merely to certain races....

In the aftermath of the [[Kristallnacht]] pogrom in 1938, German propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] announced: "The German people is anti-Semitic. It has no desire to have its rights restricted or to be provoked in the future by parasites of the Jewish race."&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Telegraph'', 12 November 1938.

After the 1945 [[End of World War II in Europe|victory of the Allies over Nazi Germany]], and particularly after the full extent of the [[The Holocaust|Nazi genocide against the Jews]] became known, the term "anti-Semitism" acquired [[pejorative]] connotations. This marked a full circle shift in usage, from an era just decades earlier when "Jew" was used as a pejorative term.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Rader Marcus. ''United States Jewry, 1776–1985.''

==Manifestations==
[[File:Medieval manuscript-Jews identified by rouelle are being burned at stake.jpg|thumb|Jews (identified by the mandatory [[Jewish badge]] and [[Jewish hat]]) being burned.]]
Antisemitism manifests itself in a variety of ways. [[René König]] mentions social antisemitism, economic antisemitism, religious antisemitism, and political antisemitism as examples. König points out that these different forms demonstrate that the "origins of anti-Semitic prejudices are rooted in different historical periods." König asserts that differences in the chronology of different antisemitic prejudices and the irregular distribution of such prejudices over different segments of the population create "serious difficulties in the definition of the different kinds of anti-Semitism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Materialien zur Kriminalsoziologie |first=René |last= König |publisher=VS Verlag |year=2004 |page=231 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=N9oL2cljv8QC&amp;pg=PA231|isbn=978-3-8100-3306-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These difficulties may contribute to the existence of different taxonomies that have been developed to categorize the forms of antisemitism. The forms identified are substantially the same; it is primarily the number of forms and their definitions that differ. [[Bernard Lazare]] identifies three forms of antisemitism: [[Christianity and antisemitism|Christian antisemitism]], economic antisemitism, and ethnologic antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anti-Semitism: Its History and Causes |first=Bernard |last=Lazare |publisher=Cosimo, Inc. |year=2006 |page=224|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VP81v2Y24HUC&amp;pg=PA224|isbn=978-1-59605-601-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*political and economic antisemitism, giving as examples [[Cicero]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles Lindbergh]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Religious antisemitism|theological or religious antisemitism]], sometimes known as [[anti-Judaism]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*nationalistic antisemitism, citing [[Voltaire]] and other [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers, who attacked Jews for supposedly having certain characteristics, such as greed and arrogance, and for observing customs such as [[kashrut]] and [[Shabbat]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*and [[racial antisemitism]], with its extreme form resulting in [[the Holocaust]] by the [[Nazi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis Harap separates "economic antisemitism" and merges "political" and "nationalistic" antisemitism into "ideological antisemitism". Harap also adds a category of "social antisemitism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Creative awakening: the Jewish presence in twentieth-century American literature, 1900-1940s |first=Louis |last=Harap |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1987 |page=24|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mAPvam-n_DYC&amp;pg=PA24|isbn=978-0-313-25386-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* religious (Jew as Christ-killer),
* economic (Jew as banker, usurer, money-obsessed),
* social (Jew as social inferior, "pushy," vulgar, therefore excluded from personal contact),
* racist (Jews as an inferior "race"),
* ideological (Jews regarded as subversive or revolutionary),
* cultural (Jews regarded as undermining the moral and structural fiber of civilization).

[[Gustavo Perednik]] has argued that what he terms "Judeophobia" has a number of unique traits which set it apart from other forms of racism, including permanence, depth, obsessiveness, irrationality, endurance, ubiquity, and danger.&lt;ref&gt;Gustavo Perednik, [http://www.zionism-israel.com/his/judeophobia.htm Judeophobia –  Anti-Semitism, Jew-Hate and anti-"Zionism"]&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote in his book ''The Judeophobia'' that "The Jews were accused by the nationalists of being the creators of Communism; by the Communists of ruling Capitalism. If they live in non-Jewish countries, they are accused of double-loyalties; if they live in the Jewish country, of being racists. When they spend their money, they are reproached for being ostentatious; when they don't spend their money, of being avaricious. They are called rootless cosmopolitans or hardened chauvinists. If they assimilate, they are accused of being fifth-columnists, if they don't, of shutting themselves away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Perednik |first=Gustavo |title=La Judeofobia: Cómo y Cuándo Nace, Dónde y Por Qué Pervive |url=https://books.google.com/?id=c3IiAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Los+judíos+fueron+acusados+por+los+nacionalistas+de+ser+generadores+del+comunismo;+por+los+comunistas+de+regir+el+capitalismo.+Si+viven+en+países+no+judíos,+son+acusados+de+dobles+lealtades;+si+viven+en+el+país+judío,+de+ser+racistas.+Cuando+gastan+su+dinero,+se+les+reprocha+ser+ostentosos;+cuando+no+lo+gastan,+ser+avaros.+Son+tildados+de+cosmopolitas+sin+raíces+o+de+chauvinistas+empedernidos.+Si+se+asimilan+al+medio,+se+les+acusa+de+quintacolumnistas,+si+no,+de+recluirse+en+sí+mismos.&amp;dq=Los+judíos+fueron+acusados+por+los+nacionalistas+de+ser+generadores+del+comunismo;+por+los+comunistas+de+regir+el+capitalismo.+Si+viven+en+países+no+judíos,+son+acusados+de+dobles+lealtades;+si+viven+en+el+país+judío,+de+ser+racistas.+Cuando+gastan+su+dinero,+se+les+reprocha+ser+ostentosos;+cuando+no+lo+gastan,+ser+avaros.+Son+tildados+de+cosmopolitas+sin+raíces+o+de+chauvinistas+empedernidos.+Si+se+asimilan+al+medio,+se+les+acusa+de+quintacolumnistas,+si+no,+de+recluirse+en+sí+mismos.|publisher=Flor del Viento |year=2001 |page=26 |isbn=978-8489644588 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Perednik |first=Gustavo Daniel |title=España descarrilada: terror islamista en Madrid y el despertar de Occidente |publisher=Inédita Editores |year=2004 |isbn=978-8496364042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvard University|Harvard]] professor [[Ruth Wisse]] has argued that antisemitism is a political ideology that authoritarians use to consolidate power by unifying disparate groups. One example she gives is the [[Criticism of the United Nations#Allegations of anti-Zionism and antisemitism|alleged antisemitism within the United Nations]], which, in this view, functioned during the [[Cold War]] as a coalition-building technique between Soviet and Arab states, but now serves the same purpose among states opposed to the type of human-rights ideology for which the UN was created. She also cites as an example the formation of the [[Arab League]].&lt;ref name="Wisse" /&gt;

===Cultural antisemitism===

Louis Harap defines cultural antisemitism as "that species of anti-Semitism that charges the Jews with corrupting a given culture and attempting to supplant or succeeding in supplanting the preferred culture with a uniform, crude, "Jewish" culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Creative awakening: the Jewish presence in twentieth-century American literature |first=Louis |last=Harap |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1987 |page=76 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mAPvam-n_DYC&amp;pg=PA76 |isbn=978-0-313-25386-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Eric Kandel]] characterizes cultural antisemitism as being based on the idea of "Jewishness" as a "religious or cultural tradition that is acquired through learning, through distinctive traditions and education." According to Kandel, this form of antisemitism views Jews as possessing "unattractive psychological and social characteristics that are acquired through acculturation."&lt;ref name=Kandel30&gt;{{cite book |title=In search of memory: the emergence of a new science of mind |first=Eric R. |last=Kandel |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |year=2007 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PFnRwWXzypgC&amp;pg=PA30 |isbn=978-0-393-32937-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niewyk and Nicosia characterize cultural antisemitism as focusing on and condemning "the Jews' aloofness from the societies in which they live."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust |first1=Donald L. |last1=Niewyk|first2=Francis R. |last2=Nicosia |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2003|page=215|url=https://books.google.com/?id=z-6vKBHggVwC&amp;pg=PA215|isbn=978-0-231-11201-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An important feature of cultural antisemitism is that it considers the negative attributes of Judaism to be redeemable by education or by religious conversion.&lt;ref name=Kandel3031&gt;{{cite book |title=In search of memory: the emergence of a new science of mind |first=Eric R. |last=Kandel |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |year=2007 |pages=30–31 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PFnRwWXzypgC&amp;pg=PA30|isbn=978-0-393-32937-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious antisemitism===
{{See also|Anti-Judaism|Christianity and antisemitism|Islam and antisemitism}}
[[File:Execution of Mariana de Carabajal.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Execution of [[Francisca Nuñez de Carabajal|Mariana de Carabajal]] (converted Jew), accused of a relapse into Judaism, [[Mexico City]], 1601]]
[[Religious antisemitism]], also known as anti-Judaism, is antipathy towards Jews because of their perceived religious beliefs. In theory, antisemitism and attacks against individual Jews would stop if Jews stopped practicing Judaism or changed their public faith, especially by [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to the official or right religion. However, in some cases discrimination continues after conversion, as in the case of Christianized ''[[Marranos]]'' or Iberian Jews in the late 15th century and 16th century who were suspected of secretly practising Judaism or Jewish customs.&lt;ref name="Flannery1985"/&gt;

Although the origins of antisemitism are rooted in the Judeo-Christian conflict, other forms of antisemitism have developed in modern times. Frederick Schweitzer asserts that, "most scholars ignore the Christian foundation on which the modern antisemitic edifice rests and invoke political antisemitism, cultural antisemitism, racism or racial antisemitism, economic antisemitism and the like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A concise history of American antisemitism |first=Robert |last=Michael |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2005|page=vii |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5G3feplFBYUC&amp;pg=PR7|isbn=978-0-7425-4313-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Nichols draws a distinction between religious antisemitism and modern antisemitism based on racial or ethnic grounds: "The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion [...] a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon [[baptism]]." From the perspective of racial antisemitism, however, "the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism.[...] From the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews[...] Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear."

Some Christians such as the Catholic priest [[Ernest Jouin]], who published the first French translation of the ''Protocols'', combined religious and racial anti-Semitism, as in his statement that "From the triple viewpoint of race, of nationality, and of religion, the Jew has become the enemy of humanity."&lt;ref name="Michael"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=R. |title=A History of Catholic Antisemitism: The Dark Side of the Church |date=2008 |publisher=Springer |page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; The virulent anti-Semitism of [[Édouard Drumont]], one of the most widely read Catholic writers in France during the Dreyfus Affair, likewise combined religious and racial anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Arnal |first1=Oscar L. |title=Ambivalent Alliance: The Catholic Church and the Action Française, 1899-1939 |date=1985 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rubenstein |first1=Richard L. |title=Approaches to Auschwitz: The Holocaust and Its Legacy |date=2003 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brustein |first1=William |title=Roots of Hate: Anti-Semitism in Europe Before the Holocaust |date=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic antisemitism===
The underlying premise of [[economic antisemitism]] is that Jews perform harmful economic activities or that economic activities become harmful when they are performed by Jews.&lt;ref name=MeyerBrenner220&gt;{{cite book |title=German-Jewish History in Modern Times: Integration in dispute, 1871–1918 |publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1998 |page=220 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HFFoSglsovoC&amp;pg=PA220|isbn=978-0-231-07476-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linking Jews and money underpins the most damaging and lasting [[Antisemitic canard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jews &amp; Money – The story of a stereotype|url=http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/jewsandmoney/default.asp|accessdate=18 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228220753/http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/jewsandmoney/default.asp|archivedate=28 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antisemites claim that Jews control the world finances, a theory promoted in the fraudulent [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]], and later repeated by [[Henry Ford]] and his [[The Dearborn Independent|Dearborn Independent]]. In the modern era, such myths continue to be spread in books such as ''[[The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews]]'' published by the [[Nation of Islam]], and on the internet.
[[Derek Penslar]] writes that there are two components to the financial [[Antisemitic canard|canards]]:&lt;ref&gt;Penslar, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
:a) Jews are savages that "are temperamentally incapable of performing honest labor"
:b) Jews are "leaders of a financial cabal seeking world domination"

[[Abraham Foxman]] describes six facets of the financial canards:
#All Jews are wealthy&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;
#Jews are stingy and greedy&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;
#Powerful Jews control the business world&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;
#Jewish religion emphasizes profit and materialism&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;
#It is okay for Jews to cheat non-Jews&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;
#Jews use their power to benefit "their own kind"&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerald Krefetz]] summarizes the myth as "[Jews] control the banks, the money supply, the economy, and businesses—of the community, of the country, of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Krefetz, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Krefetz gives, as illustrations, many slurs and proverbs (in several different languages) which suggest that Jews are stingy, or greedy, or miserly, or aggressive bargainers.&lt;ref&gt;Krefetz, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; During the nineteenth century, Jews were described as "scurrilous, stupid, and tight-fisted", but after the [[Jewish Emancipation]] and the rise of Jews to the middle- or upper-class in Europe were portrayed as "clever, devious, and manipulative financiers out to dominate [world finances]".&lt;ref&gt;Krefetz, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Léon Poliakov]] asserts that economic antisemitism is not a distinct form of antisemitism, but merely a manifestation of theologic antisemitism (because, without the theological causes of the economic antisemitism, there would be no economic antisemitism). In opposition to this view, Derek Penslar contends that in the modern era, the economic antisemitism is "distinct and nearly constant" but theological antisemitism is "often subdued".&lt;ref&gt;Penslar, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

An academic study by Francesco D'Acunto, Marcel Prokopczuk, and Michael Weber showed that people who live in areas of Germany that contain the most brutal history of anti-Semitic persecution are more likely to be distrustful of finance in general. Therefore, they tended to invest less money in the stock market and make poor financial decisions. The study concluded "that the persecution of minorities reduces not only the long-term wealth of the persecuted, but of the persecutors as well."&lt;ref&gt;D’Acunto, Francesco, et al.

===Racial antisemitism===

Racial antisemitism is prejudice against [[Jew]]s as a racial/ethnic group, rather than [[Judaism]] as a religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1603&amp;letter=A&amp;search=Anti-semitism "Anti-Semitism"], [[Jewish Encyclopedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial antisemitism is the idea that the Jews are a distinct and inferior race compared to their host nations. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, it gained mainstream acceptance as part of the [[eugenics]] movement, which categorized non-Europeans as inferior. It more specifically claimed that Northern Europeans, or "Aryans", were superior. Racial antisemites saw the Jews as part of a Semitic race and emphasized their non-European origins and culture. They saw Jews as beyond redemption even if they converted to the majority religion.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Racial antisemitism replaced the hatred of Judaism with the hatred of Jews as a group. In the context of the [[Industrial Revolution]], following the [[Jewish Emancipation]], Jews rapidly urbanized and experienced a period of greater social mobility. With the decreasing role of religion in public life tempering religious antisemitism, a combination of growing [[nationalism]], the rise of [[eugenics]], and resentment at the socio-economic success of the Jews led to the newer, and more virulent, racist antisemitism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

According to William Nichols, religious antisemitism may be distinguished from modern antisemitism based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] or [[ethnicity|ethnic]] grounds. "The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion... a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon baptism." However, with racial antisemitism, "Now the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism.... From the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews... Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear."&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, William: ''Christian Antisemitism, A History of Hate'' (1993) p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, a number of laws enabling emancipation of the Jews were enacted in Western European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Webster (2001)''Petain's Crime''.

[[William I. Brustein|William Brustein]] defines political antisemitism as hostility toward Jews based on the belief that Jews seek national and/or world power." Yisrael Gutman characterizes political antisemitism as tending to "lay responsibility on the Jews for defeats and political economic crises" while seeking to "exploit opposition and resistance to Jewish influence as elements in political party platforms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Genocide, critical issues of the Holocaust: a companion to the film, Genocide |publisher=Behrman House, Inc |year=1983 |page=100 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DcdiVs9lwvcC&amp;pg=PA100|isbn=978-0-940646-04-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|New antisemitism}}
Starting in the 1990s, some scholars have advanced the concept of [[new antisemitism]], coming simultaneously from the [[Left-wing politics|left]], the [[Right-wing politics|right]], and [[Islamism|radical Islam]], which tends to focus on opposition to the creation of a Jewish homeland in the [[State of Israel]],&lt;ref name="New-AS-List"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and they argue that the language of [[anti-Zionism]] and [[criticism of Israel]] are used to attack Jews more broadly. In this view, the proponents of the new concept believe that [[criticism of Israel|criticisms of Israel]] and [[Zionism]] are often disproportionate in degree and unique in kind, and they attribute this to antisemitism. Jewish scholar [[Gustavo Perednik]] posited in 2004 that anti-Zionism in itself represents a form of discrimination against Jews, in that it singles out Jewish national aspirations as an illegitimate and racist endeavor, and "proposes actions that would result in the death of millions of Jews".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031205153139/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article?id=2791 "Antiglobalism's Jewish Problem"] in Rosenbaum, Ron (ed). ''Those who forget the past: The Question of Anti-Semitism'', Random House 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;272.&lt;/ref&gt; It is asserted that the new antisemitism deploys traditional antisemitic motifs, including older motifs such as the [[blood libel]].&lt;ref name="New-AS-List"/&gt;

Critics of the concept view it as trivializing the meaning of antisemitism, and as exploiting antisemitism in order to silence debate and to deflect attention from legitimate [[criticism of Israel|criticism of the State of Israel]], and, by associating anti-Zionism with antisemitism, misused to taint anyone opposed to Israeli actions and policies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Klug|Klug, Brian]].

Many authors see the roots of modern antisemitism in both pagan antiquity and early Christianity. Jerome Chanes identifies six stages in the historical development of antisemitism:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chanes|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Pre-Christian anti-Judaism in ancient Greece and Rome which was primarily ethnic in nature
#Christian antisemitism in antiquity and the Middle Ages which was religious in nature and has extended into modern times
#Traditional Muslim antisemitism which was—at least, in its classical form—nuanced in that Jews were a protected class
#Political, social and economic antisemitism of Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment Europe which laid the groundwork for racial antisemitism
#Racial antisemitism that arose in the 19th century and culminated in Nazism in the 20th century
#Contemporary antisemitism which has been labeled by some as the [[New Antisemitism]]

Chanes suggests that these six stages could be merged into three categories: "ancient antisemitism, which was primarily ethnic in nature; [[Christian antisemitism]], which was religious; and the racial antisemitism of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."&lt;ref name=Chanes5&gt;{{harvp|Chanes|2004|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient world===

The first clear examples of anti-Jewish sentiment can be traced to the 3rd century BCE to [[Alexandria]],&lt;ref name="Flannery1985"/&gt; the home to the largest Jewish diaspora community in the world at the time and where the [[Septuagint]], a Greek translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]], was produced. [[Manetho]], an Egyptian priest and historian of that era, wrote scathingly of the Jews. His themes are repeated in the works of [[Chaeremon of Alexandria|Chaeremon]], [[Lysimachus]], [[Poseidonius]], [[Apollonius Molon]], and in [[Apion]] and [[Tacitus]].&lt;ref name=Flannery&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agatharchides of Cnidus]] ridiculed the practices of the Jews and the "absurdity of [[Torah|their Law]]", making a mocking reference to how [[Ptolemy Lagus]] was able to invade [[Jerusalem]] in 320 BCE because its inhabitants were observing the ''[[Shabbat]]''.&lt;ref name=Flannery /&gt; One of the earliest anti-Jewish [[edict]]s, promulgated by [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] in about 170–167 BCE, sparked a revolt of the [[Maccabees]] in [[Judea]].&lt;ref name="gruen"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |authorlink=Erich S.

In view of Manetho's anti-Jewish writings, antisemitism may have originated in Egypt and been spread by "the [[Greeks|Greek]] retelling of [[Ancient Egypt]]ian prejudices".&lt;ref name="Schäfer"&gt;Schäfer, Peter. ''Judeophobia'', Harvard University Press, 1997, p. 208.[[Peter Schaefer (author)|Peter Schäfer]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Jewish philosopher [[Philo of Alexandria]] describes an attack on Jews in Alexandria in 38 CE in which thousands of Jews died.&lt;ref name=Barclay&gt;Barclay, John M G, 1999.

''Philo's Flaccus: the First Pogrom'', Philo of Alexandria Commentary Series, Brill. [[Pieter Willem van der Horst]]&lt;/ref&gt; Tcherikover argues that the reason for hatred of Jews in the Hellenistic period was their separateness in the Greek cities, the ''[[polis|poleis]]''.&lt;ref name=tcherikover&gt;Tcherikover, Victor, ''Hellenistic Civilization and the Jews'', New York: Atheneum, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Bohak has argued, however, that early animosity against the Jews cannot be regarded as being anti-Judaic or antisemitic unless it arose from attitudes that were held against the Jews alone, and that many Greeks showed animosity toward any group they regarded as barbarians.&lt;ref name=Bohak&gt;Bohak, Gideon. "The Ibis and the Jewish Question: Ancient 'Antisemitism' in Historical Context" in Menachem Mor et al., ''Jews and Gentiles in the Holy Land in the Days of the Second Temple, the Mishna and the Talmud'', Yad Ben-Zvi Press, 2003, pp. 27–43 {{ISBN|9652172057}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Statements exhibiting prejudice against Jews and their religion can be found in the works of many [[pagan]] [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3265911|author=Daniels J.L.|title=Anti-Semitism in the Hellenistic-Roman Period|journal=Journal of Biblical Literature|volume=98 |issue=1|year=1979|pages=45–65|doi=10.2307/3265911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Flannery writes that it was the Jews' refusal to accept Greek religious and social standards that marked them out. Hecataetus of Abdera, a Greek historian of the early third century BCE, wrote that Moses "in remembrance of the exile of his people, instituted for them a misanthropic and inhospitable way of life." [[Manetho]], an Egyptian historian, wrote that the Jews were expelled Egyptian [[Leprosy|lepers]] who had been taught by [[Moses]] "not to adore the gods." Edward Flannery describes antisemitism in ancient times as essentially "cultural, taking the shape of a national xenophobia played out in political settings."&lt;ref name="Flannery1985"/&gt;

There are examples of [[Hellenistic]] rulers desecrating the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] and banning Jewish religious practices, such as [[circumcision]], Shabbat observance, study of Jewish religious books, etc. Examples may also be found in anti-Jewish riots in [[Alexandria]] in the 3rd century BCE.

The Jewish diaspora on the [[Nile River|Nile]] island [[Elephantine]], which was founded by mercenaries, experienced the destruction of its temple in 410 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Colpe, Carsten (Berlin). "Anti-Semitism." Brill's New Pauly. Antiquity volumes edited by: Hubert Cancik and Helmuth Schneider. Brill, 2008. Brill Online. 28 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Relationships between the Jewish people and the occupying [[Roman Empire]] were at times antagonistic and resulted in [[Jewish-Roman wars|several rebellions]]. According to [[Suetonius]], the emperor [[Tiberius]] expelled from Rome Jews who had gone to live there. The 18th-century English historian [[Edward Gibbon]] identified a more tolerant period in Roman-Jewish relations beginning in about 160 CE.&lt;ref name="Flannery1985"/&gt; However, when Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire, the state's attitude towards the Jews [[History of antisemitism#Late Roman Empire|gradually worsened]].

[[James Carroll (novelist)|James Carroll]] asserted: "Jews accounted for 10% of the total population of the [[Roman Empire]]. By that ratio, if other factors such as [[pogrom]]s and [[forced conversion|conversion]]s had not intervened, there would be 200 million Jews in the world today, instead of something like 13 million."&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, James.

During the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe there was persecution against Jews in many places, with [[blood libel]]s, expulsions, [[forced conversion]]s and [[massacre]]s. A main justification of prejudice against Jews in Europe was religious.

During the mid-to-late 17th century the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was devastated by several conflicts, in which the Commonwealth lost over a third of its population (over 3 million people), and Jewish losses were counted in the hundreds of thousands.

The precise number of dead may never be known, but the decrease of the Jewish population during that period is estimated at 100,000 to 200,000, which also includes emigration, deaths from diseases and [[Slavery (Ottoman Empire)|captivity in the Ottoman Empire]], called ''jasyr''.&lt;ref&gt;"Bogdan Chmelnitzki leads Cossack uprising against Polish rule; 100,000 Jews are killed and hundreds of Jewish communities are destroyed."

European immigrants to the United States brought antisemitism to the country as early as the 17th century. [[Peter Stuyvesant]], the Dutch governor of [[New Amsterdam]], implemented plans to prevent Jews from settling in the city. During the Colonial Era, the American government limited the political and economic rights of Jews. It was not until the [[American Revolutionary War]] that Jews gained legal rights, including the right to vote. However, even at their peak, the restrictions on Jews in the United States were never as stringent as they had been in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|first=Ed. by Paul S.|title=The Oxford companion to United States history|year=2006|publisher=Oxford Univ.

In the [[Zaydi|Zaydi imamate]] of [[Yemen]], Jews were also singled out for discrimination in the 17th century, which culminated in the general expulsion of all Jews from places in Yemen to the arid coastal plain of [[Tihamah]] and which became known as the [[Mawza Exile]].&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim'' (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem 1989, pp. 714–716 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enlightenment===
In 1744, [[Frederick II of Prussia]] limited the number of Jews allowed to live in [[Breslau]] to only ten so-called "protected" Jewish families and encouraged a similar practice in other [[Prussia]]n cities. In 1750 he issued the ''Revidiertes General Privilegium und Reglement vor die Judenschaft'': the "protected" Jews had an alternative to "either abstain from marriage or leave [[Berlin]]" (quoting [[Simon Dubnow]]). In the same year, Archduchess of Austria [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] ordered Jews out of [[Bohemia]] but soon reversed her position, on the condition that Jews pay for their readmission every ten years. This [[extortion]] was known as ''malke-geld'' (queen's money). In 1752 she introduced the law limiting each Jewish family to one son. In 1782, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] abolished most of these persecution practices in his ''[[Toleranzpatent]]'', on the condition that [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] were eliminated from public records and that judicial autonomy was annulled. [[Moses Mendelssohn]] wrote that "Such a tolerance... is even more dangerous play in tolerance than open persecution."

===Voltaire===
According to Arnold Ages, [[Voltaire]]'s "Lettres philosophiques, Dictionnaire philosophique, and Candide, to name but a few of his better known works, are saturated with comments on Jews and Judaism and the vast majority are negative".&lt;ref&gt;Ages Arnold. "Tainted Greatness: The Case of Voltaire's Anti-Semitism: The Testimony of the Correspondence." Neohelicon 21.2 (Sept. 1994): 361.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul H. Meyer adds: "There is no question but that Voltaire, particularly in his latter years, nursed a violent hatred of the Jews and it is equally certain that his animosity...did have a considerable impact on public opinion in France."&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Paul H. "The Attitude of the Enlightenment Toward the Jew." Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century, 26 (1963): 1177.&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty of the 118 articles in Voltaire's ''[[Dictionnaire Philosophique]]'' concerned Jews and described them in consistently negative ways.&lt;ref&gt;[[Léon Poliakov|Poliakov, L.]] ''The History of Anti-Semitism: From Voltaire to Wagner''.

===Louis de Bonald and the Catholic Counter-Revolution===
The [[counter-revolutionary]] Catholic royalist [[Louis de Bonald]] stands out among the earliest figures to explicitly call for the reversal of Jewish emancipation in the wake of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Battini1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Socialism of Fools: Capitalism and Modern Anti-Semitism|last=Battini|first=Michele|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=2–7 and 30–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Katz |first1=Jacob |title=From Prejudice to Destruction: Anti-Semitism, 1700-1933 |date=1980 |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=112–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonald's attacks on the Jews are likely to have influenced [[Napoléon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]'s decision to limit the civil rights of Alsatian Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Socialism of Fools: Capitalism and Modern Anti-Semitism|last=Battini|first=Michele|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Garṭner |first1=Aryeh |last2=Gartner |first2=Lloyd P. |title=History of the Jews in Modern Times |date=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Joskowicz |first1=Ari |title=The Modernity of Others: Jewish Anti-Catholicism in Germany and France |date=2013 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=Robert |last2=Rosen |first2=Philip |title=Dictionary of Antisemitism from the Earliest Times to the Present |date=2007 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonald's article ''Sur les juifs'' (1806) was one of the most venomous screeds of its era and furnished a paradigm which combined anti-liberalism, a defense of a rural society, traditional Christian antisemitism, and the identification of Jews with bankers and finance capital, which would in turn influence many subsequent right-wing reactionaries such as [[Roger Gougenot des Mousseaux]], [[Charles Maurras]], and [[Édouard Drumont]], nationalists such as [[Maurice Barrès]] and [[Paolo Orano]], and anti-Semitic socialists such as [[Alphonse Toussenel]].&lt;ref name="Battini1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sanos |first1=Sandrine |title=The Aesthetics of Hate: Far-Right Intellectuals, Antisemitism, and Gender in 1930s France |date=2012 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Laqueur |first1=Walter |last2=Baumel |first2=Judith Tydor |title=The Holocaust Encyclopedia |date=2001 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonald furthermore declared that the Jews were an "alien" people, a "state within a state", and should be forced to wear a distinctive mark to more easily identify and discriminate against them.&lt;ref name="Battini1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Michael1" /&gt;

Under the French Second Empire, the popular counter-revolutionary Catholic journalist [[Louis Veuillot]] propagated Bonald's arguments against the Jewish "financial aristocracy" along with vicious attacks against the Talmud and the Jews as a "deicidal people" driven by hatred to "enslave" Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graetz |first1=Michael |title=The Jews in Nineteenth-century France: From the French Revolution to the Alliance Israélite Universelle |date=1996 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michael1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=Robert |title=A History of Catholic Antisemitism: The Dark Side of the Church |date=2008 |publisher=Springer |pages=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1882 and 1886 alone, French priests published twenty antisemitic books blaming France's ills on the Jews and urging the government to consign them back to the ghettos, expel them, or hang them from the gallows.&lt;ref name="Michael1" /&gt; Gougenot des Mousseaux's ''Le Juif, le judaïsme et la judaïsation des peuples chrétiens'' (1869) has been called a "Bible of modern antisemitism" and was translated into German by Nazi ideologue [[Alfred Rosenberg]].&lt;ref name="Michael1" /&gt;

===Imperial Russia===
Thousands of Jews were slaughtered by Cossack [[Haidamaka|Haidamaks]] in the 1768 [[massacre of Uman]] in the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]. In 1772, the empress of Russia [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] forced the Jews into the [[Pale of Settlement]] &amp;ndash; which was located primarily in present-day Poland, Ukraine and Belarus &amp;ndash; and to stay in their [[shtetls]] and forbade them from returning to the towns that they occupied before the [[partition of Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Poland.html The Virtual Jewish History Tour By Rebecca Weiner].

Policy towards Jews was liberalised somewhat under [[Czar Alexander II]] ({{reign|1855|1881}}).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson, ''A History of the Jews'', Harper Perennial, 1986, p 359&lt;/ref&gt; However, his assassination in 1881 served as a pretext for further repression such as the [[May Laws]] of 1882. [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]], nicknamed the "black czar" and tutor to the [[czarevitch]], later crowned [[Czar Nicholas II]], declared that "One third of the Jews must die, one third must emigrate, and one third be converted to Christianity".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Van der Kiste]],''The Romanovs 1818–1959'', Sutton, 1998, p 104&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic antisemitism in the 19th century===
Historian [[Martin Gilbert]] writes that it was in the 19th century that the position of Jews worsened in [[Muslim]] countries. [[Benny Morris]] writes that one symbol of Jewish degradation was the phenomenon of stone-throwing at Jews by Muslim children. Morris quotes a 19th-century traveler: "I have seen a little fellow of six years old, with a troop of fat toddlers of only three and four, teaching [them] to throw stones at a Jew, and one little urchin would, with the greatest coolness, waddle up to the man and literally spit upon his Jewish [[gaberdine]]. To all this the Jew is obliged to submit; it would be more than his life was worth to offer to strike a Mahommedan."&lt;ref name=Morris10&gt;[[Benny Morris|Morris, Benny]]. ''Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881–2001''. Vintage Books, 2001, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the 19th century, [[J. J. Benjamin]] wrote about the life of [[Persian Jews]], describing conditions and beliefs that went back to the 16th century: "…they are obliged to live in a separate part of town… Under the pretext of their being unclean, they are treated with the greatest severity and should they enter a street, inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirt…."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bernard |last=Lewis |title=The Jews of Islam |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |year=1984 |pages=181–183|isbn=978-0-691-00807-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jerusalem at least, conditions for some Jews improved. [[Moses Montefiore]], on his seventh visit in 1875, noted that fine new buildings had sprung up and; 'surely we're approaching the time to witness God's hallowed promise unto Zion.' Muslim and Christian Arabs participated in [[Purim]] and [[Passover]]; Arabs called the [[Sephardi]]s 'Jews, sons of Arabs'; the [[Ulema]] and the Rabbis offered joint prayers for rain in time of drought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Sebag Montefiore]], ''Jerusalem'', Phoenix, 2011, pp. 429-432&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the Dreyfus trial in France, 'Muslim comments usually favoured the persecuted Jew against his Christian persecutors'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Lewis]], ''What Went Wrong?'', Phoenix, 2002, p 172&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secular or racial antisemitism===
[[Image:Wagner Das Judenthum in der Musik 1869.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Title page of the second edition of ''Das Judenthum in der Musik'', published in 1869]]
In 1850 the German composer [[Richard Wagner]] – who has been called "the inventor of modern antisemitism"&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt; – published ''[[Das Judenthum in der Musik]]'' (roughly "Jewishness in Music"&lt;ref name=bismarck&gt;[[Jonathan Steinberg|Steinberg, Jonathan]] (2011) ''Bismarck: A Life'' New York: Oxford, pp.388–90. {{ISBN|978-0-19-997539-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;) under a [[pseudonym]] in the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]''. The essay began as an attack on Jewish composers, particularly Wagner's contemporaries, and rivals, [[Felix Mendelssohn]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], but expanded to accuse Jews of being a harmful and alien element in [[Culture of Germany|German culture]], who corrupted morals and were, in fact, parasites incapable of creating truly "German" art. The crux was the manipulation and control by the Jews of the money economy:&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to the present constitution of this world, the Jew in truth is already more than emancipated: he rules, and will rule, so long as Money remains the power before which all our doings and our dealings lose their force.&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although originally published anonymously, when the essay was republished 19 years later, in 1869, the concept of the corrupting Jew had become so widely held that Wagner's name was affixed to it.&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt;
 
Antisemitism can also be found in many of the [[Grimms' Fairy Tales]] by [[Jacob Grimm|Jacob]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm]], published from 1812 to 1857. It is mainly characterized by Jews being the [[villain]] of a story, such as in "The Good Bargain" ("''Der gute Handel"'') and "The Jew Among Thorns" (''"Der Jude im Dorn"'').

The middle 19th century saw continued official harassment of the Jews, especially in Eastern Europe under Czarist influence. For example, in 1846, 80 Jews approached the governor in Warsaw to retain the right to wear their traditional dress, but were immediately rebuffed by having their hair and beards forcefully cut, at their own expense.&lt;ref name=BDE&gt;{{cite bklyn|title=The Despot of Russia...|image=50249029|date=22 December 1846|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, even such influential figures as Walt Whitman tolerated bigotry toward the Jews. During his time as editor of the Brooklyn Eagle (1846–1848), the newspaper published historical sketches casting Jews in a bad light.&lt;ref name=BDE-Whitman&gt;{{cite bklyn|title=Anecdotes of Jews, and their peculiar traits|image=50243090|page=2|date=8 January 1847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dreyfus Affair]] was an infamous antisemitic event of the late 19th century and early 20th century. [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a Jewish artillery [[wikt:captain|captain]] in the [[French Army]], was accused in 1894 of passing secrets to the Germans. As a result of these charges, Dreyfus was convicted and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] on [[Devil's Island]]. The actual spy, Marie Charles Esterhazy, was acquitted. The event caused great uproar among the French, with the public choosing sides on the issue of whether Dreyfus was actually guilty or not. [[Émile Zola]] accused the army of corrupting the French justice system. However, general consensus held that Dreyfus was guilty: 80% of the press in France condemned him. This attitude among the majority of the French population reveals the underlying antisemitism of the time period.&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, Michael. (2005) Nineteenth Century Europe. New York: Palgrave MacMillan {{ISBN|0333652460}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Stoecker]] (1835–1909), the [[Lutheran]] court chaplain to [[Kaiser Wilhelm I]], founded in 1878 an antisemitic, [[Liberalism|anti-liberal]] political party called the [[Christian Social Party (Germany)|Christian Social Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Harold M.

Some scholars view [[Karl Marx|Karl Marx's]] essay ''[[On The Jewish Question]]'' as antisemitic, and argue that he often used antisemitic epithets in his published and private writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|2004|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobs2005"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Marx, Karl (1818–1883) |title=Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution |last=Jacobs |first=Jack |editor=Levy, Richard S. |year=2005 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara, CA |isbn=978-1-85109-439-4 |pages=446–447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis1999"&gt;{{harvp|Lewis|1999|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scholars argue that Marx equated Judaism with capitalism in his essay, helping to spread that idea.

Wheen says that "Those critics, who see this as a foretaste of 'Mein Kampf', overlook one, essential point: in spite of the clumsy phraseology and crude stereotyping, the essay was actually written as a defense of the Jews. It was a retort to Bruno Bauer, who had argued that Jews should not be granted full civic rights and freedoms unless they were baptised as Christians".&lt;ref&gt;Wheen, F., Karl Marx, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; According to McLellan, Marx used the word ''Judentum'' colloquially, as meaning ''commerce'', arguing that Germans must be emancipated from the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] not Judaism or Jews in particular. McLellan concludes that readers should interpret the essay's second half as "an extended pun at Bauer's expense".&lt;ref&gt;McLellan 1980, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1900 and 1924, approximately 1.75 million Jews migrated to America, the bulk from Eastern Europe. Before 1900 American Jews had always amounted to less than 1% of America's total population, but by 1930 Jews formed about 3.5%. This increase, combined with the [[upward social mobility]] of some Jews, contributed to a resurgence of antisemitism. In the first half of the 20th century, in the US, Jews were discriminated against in employment, access to residential and resort areas, membership in clubs and organizations, and in tightened quotas on Jewish enrolment and teaching positions in colleges and universities. The lynching of [[Leo Frank]] by a mob of prominent citizens in [[Marietta, Georgia]] in 1915 turned the spotlight on antisemitism in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chanes|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ju7U83nRDt8C&amp;pg=PA72 72]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was also used to build support for the renewal of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] which had been inactive since 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levy|2005|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tdn6FFZklkcC&amp;pg=PA243 vol. 1, p.&amp;nbsp;72]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, the [[Menahem Mendel Beilis|Beilis Trial]] in Russia represented incidents of [[blood libel|blood-libel]] in Europe. Christians used allegations of Jews killing Christians as a justification for the killing of Jews.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Antisemitism in America reached its peak during the [[interwar period]]. The pioneer automobile manufacturer [[Henry Ford]] propagated antisemitic ideas in his newspaper ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]'' (published by Ford from 1919 to 1927). The radio speeches of [[Father Coughlin]] in the late 1930s attacked [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] and promoted the notion of a Jewish financial conspiracy. Some prominent politicians shared such views: [[Louis T. McFadden]], Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Banking and Currency]], blamed Jews for Roosevelt's decision to abandon the [[gold standard]], and claimed that "in the United States today, the Gentiles have the slips of paper while the Jews have the lawful money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arad |first=Gulie Ne'eman |title=America, Its Jews, and the Rise of Nazism |year=2000 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Indianapolis |isbn=978-0-253-33809-9 |page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1940s the [[aviator]] [[Charles Lindbergh]] and many prominent Americans led The [[America First Committee]] in opposing any involvement in the war against [[Fascism]]. During his July 1936 visit to [[Nazi Germany]], a few weeks before the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], Lindbergh wrote letters saying that there was "more intelligent leadership in Germany than is generally recognized". The [[German American Bund]] held parades in New York City during the late 1930s, where members wore [[Nazi]] uniforms and raised flags featuring [[swastika]]s alongside American flags.

In Germany, [[Nazism]] led [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]], who [[Machtergreifung|came to power]] on 30 January 1933 shortly afterwards instituted repressive legislation which denied the Jews basic civil rights.{{sfn|Majer|2014|p=60}}&lt;ref&gt;see also [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]] (7 April 1933)&lt;/ref&gt; 
In September 1935, the [[Nuremberg Laws]] prohibited sexual relations and marriages between "Aryans" and Jews as ''[[Rassenschande]]'' ("race disgrace") and stripped all German Jews, even quarter- and [[half-Jew]]s, of their citizenship, (their official title became "subjects of the state").{{sfn|Majer|2014|pp=113, 116, 118}} It instituted a pogrom on the night of 9–10 November 1938, dubbed ''[[Kristallnacht]]'', in which Jews were killed, their property destroyed and their synagogues torched.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw (2008) ''Fateful Choices'': 441-44&lt;/ref&gt; Antisemitic laws, agitation and propaganda were extended to [[German-occupied Europe]] in the wake of conquest, often building on local antisemitic traditions.

After [[Operation Barbarossa|the beginning]] of the war between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in 1941 a campaign of mass murder, conducted by the [[Einsatzgruppen]], culminated from 1942 to 1945 in systematic [[genocide]]: [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="saul1"&gt;[[Saul Friedländer]] (2008): ''The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews''.

Antisemitism was commonly used as an instrument for settling personal conflicts in the [[Soviet Union]], starting with the conflict between [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]] and continuing through numerous conspiracy-theories spread by official propaganda. [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|Antisemitism in the USSR]] reached new heights after 1948 during the campaign against the "[[rootless cosmopolitan]]" (euphemism for "Jew") in which numerous Yiddish-language poets, writers, painters and sculptors were killed or arrested.&lt;ref name="jcws"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Konstantin Azadovskii and Boris Egorov| title=From Anti-Westernism to Anti-Semitism| journal=Journal of Cold War Studies| year=2002| volume=4:1| issue=Winter| pages=66–80| url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~hpcws/egorov.htm#REF31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Myth"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of the Jewish Race| author1=Raphael| author2=Jennifer Patai| year=1989| page=178| publisher=Wayne State University Press| isbn=978-0-8143-1948-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated in the so-called [[Doctors' Plot]] (1952–1953).

In Eastern Europe the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the instability of the new states has brought the rise of nationalist movements and the accusation against Jews for the economic crisis, taking over the local economy and bribing the government alongside with traditional and religious motives for antisemitism such as [[blood libel]]s. Most of the antisemitic incidents are against Jewish cemeteries and building (community centers and synagogues).

It has also been suggested that parts of antisemitism arose from a perception of Jewish people as greedy (as often used in [[Stereotypes of Jews#Greed|stereotypes of Jews]]), and this perception has probably evolved in Europe during Medieval times where a large portion of [[Moneylender|money lending]] was operated by Jews.&lt;ref name=Laqueur2006&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?&amp;id=IaloAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=154 Page 154] in: {{cite book|title=The Changing Face of Anti-Semitism: From Ancient Times to the Present Day|author=Walter Laqueur|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780199774739}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors contributing to this situation included that Jews were restricted from other professions,&lt;ref name=Laqueur2006/&gt; while the [[Christian Church]] declared for their followers that money lending constituted immoral "[[usury]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hawthorne's secret: an un-told tale|jstor=41398742|journal=The Georgia Review|volume=38|issue=3|pages=664–666|author=Philip Young|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Libya====
{{Further|History of the Jews in Libya}}
[[Libya]] had once one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world, dating back to 300 BCE. Despite the repression of Jews in the late 1930, as a result of the pro-Nazi Fascist Italian regime, Jews were third of the population of [[Tripoli|Libya]] till 1941. In 1942 the Nazi German troops occupied the Jewish quarter of Benghazi, plundering shops and deporting more than 2,000 Jews across the desert. Sent to work in labor camps, more than one-fifth of this group of Jews perished. A series of pogroms started in November 1945, while more than 140 Jews were killed in [[Tripoli]] and most synagogues in the city looted.&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;Harris, 2001, pp. 149–150.&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon Libya's independence in 1951, most of the Jewish community emigrated from Libya. After the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, another series of pogroms forced all but about 100 Jews to flee. When [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] came to power in 1969, all remaining Jewish property was confiscated and all debts to Jews cancelled.

==== Morocco ====
{{Further|History of the Jews in Morocco}}

[[Jew]]ish communities, in [[Islam]]ic times often living in [[ghetto]]s known as ''[[mellah]]'', have existed in [[Morocco]] for at least 2,000 years. Intermittent large scale massacres (such as that of [[1033 Fez massacre|6,000 Jews in Fez]] in 1033, over 100,000 Jews in Fez and [[Marrakesh]] in 1146 and again in Marrakesh in 1232)&lt;ref name=Morris10/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morocco"&gt;For the events of Fez see Cohen, 1995, pp 180–182. On Marrekesh, see the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' of 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; were accompanied by systematic discrimination through the years.
In 1875, 20 Jews were killed by a mob in [[Demnat]], Morocco; elsewhere in Morocco, Jews were attacked and killed in the streets in broad daylight.&lt;ref name=Gilbert179&gt;[[Martin Gilbert|Gilbert, Martin]]. ''Dearest Auntie Fori. The Story of the Jewish People''. HarperCollins, 2002, pp. 179–182.&lt;/ref&gt;
While the pro-Nazi [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime during [[World War II]] passed discriminatory laws against Jews, [[Mohammed V of Morocco|King Muhammad]] prevented deportation of Jews to death camps (although Jews with French, as opposed to Moroccan, citizenship, being directly subject to Vichy law, were still deported.)
In 1948, approximately 265,000 Jews lived in Morocco. Between 5,000 and 8,000 live there now.
In June 1948, soon after [[Israel]] was established and in the midst of the first Arab-Israeli war, riots against Jews broke out in [[Oujda]] and [[Djerada]], killing 44 Jews. In 1948-9, 18,000 Jews left the country for Israel. After this, Jewish emigration continued (to Israel and elsewhere), but slowed to a few thousand a year. Through the early fifties, [[Zionism|Zionist]] organizations encouraged emigration, particularly in the poorer south of the country, seeing Moroccan Jews as valuable contributors to the Jewish State:
In 1955, Morocco attained independence and emigration to Israel has increased further until 1956 then it was prohibited until 1963, then resumed.[http://rickgold.home.mindspring.com/Emigration/emigration13.htm] By 1967, only 60,000 Jews remained in Morocco.
The [[Six-Day War]] in 1967 led to increased Arab-Jewish tensions worldwide, including Morocco. By 1971, the Jewish population was down to 35,000; however, most of this wave of emigration went to [[Europe]] and [[North America]] rather than [[Israel]].

==== South Africa ====
{{Further|History of the Jews in South Africa}}

Antisemitism has been present in history of [[South Africa]] since Europeans first set foot ashore on the [[Cape Peninsula]]. In the years 1652–1795 Jews were not allowed to settle at the Cape. An 1868 Act would sanction religious discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Milton | first =Shain | title =The roots of antisemitism in South Africa | publisher =Wiwatersrand University Press | year =1994 | location =Johannesburg | pages =9–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antisemitism reached its apotheosis in the years leading up to [[World War II]]. Inspired by the rise of [[national socialism]] in [[Germany]] the [[Ossewabrandwag]] (OB) – whose membership accounted for almost 25% of the 1940 [[Afrikaner]] population – and the National Party faction ''New Order'' would champion a more programmatic solution to the 'Jewish problem'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/south-africa/23.htm|title=South Africa - The Impact of World War II|website=countrystudies.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tunisia ====
{{Further|History of the Jews in Tunisia}}

Jews have lived in Tunisia for at least 2,300 years. In the 13th century, Jews were expelled from their homes in [[Kairouan]] and were ultimately restricted to ghettos, known as ''hara''. Forced to wear distinctive clothing, several Jews earned high positions in the Tunisian government. Several prominent international traders were Tunisian Jews. From 1855 to 1864, [[Muhammad Bey]] relaxed dhimmi laws, but reinstated them in the face of anti-Jewish riots that continued at least until 1869.
Tunisia, as the only Middle Eastern country under direct [[Nazism|Nazi]] control during World War II, was also the site of racist antisemitic measures activities such as the yellow star, prison camps, deportations, and other persecution.
In 1948, approximately 105,000 Jews lived in [[Tunisia]]. Only about 1,500 remain there today. Following Tunisia's independence from France in 1956, a number of anti-Jewish policies led to emigration, of which half went to Israel and the other half to France. After attacks in 1967, Jewish emigration both to Israel and [[France]] accelerated.

For example, in February 2012, when Egyptian cleric Wagdi Ghanaim entered Tunisia, he was welcomed by Islamists who chanted "Death to the Jews" as a sign of their support. The following month, during protests in Tunis, a Salafi sheikh told young Tunisians to gather and learn to kill Jews.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the past, The Tunisian government has made efforts to block Jews from entering high positions, and some moderate members have tried to cover up the more extremist anti-Semitic efforts by appointing Jews to governmental positions, however, it is known that Muslim clerics believe that if the Muslim Brotherhood leads the regime, that will enhance their hatred towards Jews.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In response to the prevalent anti-Semitism, the Tunisian government has publicly protected the dwindling population and its marks of Jewish culture, for example, synagogues, and advised them to settle in Djerba, a French tourist attraction.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/13/world/tunisian-synagogue-blast-called-accident.html|title=Tunisian Synagogue Blast Called Accident|last=Jr.|first=Donald G.

[[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], former president of Iran, has frequently been accused of denying the Holocaust.

In July, the winner of Iran's first annual International [[Wall Street]] Downfall Cartoon Festival, jointly sponsored by the semi-state-run Iranian media outlet [[Fars News]], was an antisemitic cartoon depicting Jews praying before the [[New York Stock Exchange]], which is made to look like the [[Western Wall]]. Other cartoons in the contest were antisemitic as well. The national director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham Foxman, condemned the cartoon, stating that "Here's the anti-Semitic notion of Jews and their love for money, the canard that Jews 'control' Wall Street, and a cynical perversion of the Western Wall, the holiest site in Judaism," and "Once again Iran takes the prize for promoting antisemitism."&lt;ref name="The Algemeiner"&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-Semitic Cartoon Wins Iranian Festival Prize|url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/07/11/anti-semitic-cartoon-wins-iranian-festival-prize/|accessdate=11 July 2012|newspaper=The Algemeiner|date=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Jewish Chronicle"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rocker|first=Simon|title=Iran gives antisemitic cartoon top prize|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/world-news/69827/iran-gives-antisemitic-cartoon-top-prize|accessdate=11 July 2012|newspaper=The Jewish Chronicle|date=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ADL&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-Semitic Cartoon Declared Winner Of Iranian 'Wall Street Downfall' Festival|url=http://altwire.utne.com/zine/israel-palestine_new/antisemitic-cartoon-declared-winner-of-i/5547314632322f6f30586535547a61726a6e747545413d3d|website=The Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his treatise on Malay identity, "The Malay Dilemma," which was published in 1970, former Malaysian Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]] wrote: "The Jews are not only hooked-nosed... but understand money instinctively.... Jewish stinginess and financial wizardry gained them the economic control of Europe and provoked antisemitism which waxed and waned throughout Europe through the ages."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rabbi-abraham-cooper/malaysia-anti-semitism_b_903767.html In Malaysia, When in Doubt, Blame the Jews] by Rabbi Abraham Cooper, ''[[Huffington Post]]'', 22 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Malay-language [[Utusan Malaysia]] daily stated in an editorial that Malaysians "cannot allow anyone, especially the Jews, to interfere secretly in this country's business... When the drums are pounded hard in the name of human rights, the pro-Jewish people will have their best opportunity to interfere in any Islamic country," the newspaper said. "We might not realize that the enthusiasm to support actions such as demonstrations will cause us to help foreign groups succeed in their mission of controlling this country."

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1987-004-09A, Amin al Husseini und Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|[[Haj Amin al-Husseini]] is a central figure of [[Palestinian nationalism]] in Mandatory Palestine. He took refuge and collaborated with Nazi Germany during World War II. He met [[Adolf Hitler]] in December 1941. Scholarly opinion is divided on the Mufti's antisemitsm, with many scholars viewing him as a staunch antisemite&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sachar|1961|p=231}},&lt;/ref&gt; while some deny the appropriateness of the term, or argue that he became antisemitic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laurens|2002|pp=467,469–470}};'In terms of his initial formation, Haj Amin was far from being an antisemite. He had learnt French at the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]] institute in Jerusalem and [[Albert Antébi]] had been one of his mentors. In the interwar period, he had fought Zionism as a political and religious leader. He was then of the opinion that the aim of Zionism was to expel the Arabs of Palestine and take over the [[Haram al-Sharif]] in order to build the [[Third Temple]]. Gradually (''progressivement'') he was persuaded that world Judaism supported Zionists in an secretive manner and exercised a major influence over decision-making in Great Britain and the United States. For some time (during WW2) he was certain (based on real facts) that the Zionists were seeking to assassinate him. … It is evident that he gradually came to identify his battle in Palestine with that of Germany against world Judaism. The reading of all those passages in his memoirs devoted to his European sojourn reveal an assimilation of the content of european antisemitism, with their two great themes of the identification of Judaism with financial capitalism (Anglo-Saxons), and of the [[Stab-in-the-back myth|legend of the stab in the back]] (the Jews as responsible for the two world wars). On the other hand, a racist vision of world history is totally absent from his general worldview. … Taken together, his writings after 1945 do not show him as having an attitude of [[negationism|holocaust denial]], whilst Arab politicians of the first rank, in the period of Eichmann's trial, had begun to adopt (precisely) this kind of discourse.'&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In March 2011, the Israeli government issued a paper claiming that "Anti-Israel and anti-Semitic messages are heard regularly in the government and private media and in the mosques and are taught in school books," to the extent that they are "an integral part of the fabric of life inside the PA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gov't aggressively goes after Palestinian incitement |author= |url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Govt-aggressively-goes-after-Palestinian-incitement |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, Israeli Strategic Affairs Ministry director-general Yossi Kuperwasser stated that Palestinian incitement to antisemitism is "going on all the time" and that it is "worrying and disturbing." At an institutional level, he said the PA has been promoting three key messages to the Palestinian people that constitute incitement: "that the Palestinians would eventually be the sole sovereign on all the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea; that Jews, especially those who live in Israel, were not really human beings but rather 'the scum of mankind'; and that all tools were legitimate in the struggle against Israel and the Jews."&lt;ref name="kuperwasser"&gt;{{cite news |title='Palestinian incitement continuing unabated'|author= |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Palestinian-incitement-continuing-unabated |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=13 August 2012 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, the [[Hamas]]' spokesman in Doha said on live television that [[Blood libel|Jews use blood to make matzos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/384542/top-hamas-offical-jews-use-blood-matzos-molly-wharton Top Hamas Official: Jews Use Blood for Matzos]."

According to a 2004 report from the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], antisemitism had increased significantly in Europe since 2000, with significant increases in verbal attacks against Jews and vandalism such as graffiti, fire bombings of Jewish schools, desecration of synagogues and cemeteries. Germany, France, Britain, and Russia are the countries with the highest rate of antisemitic incidents in Europe.&lt;ref name = "mgjmsp" /&gt; The Netherlands and Sweden have also consistently had high rates of antisemitic attacks since 2000.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The 2005 U.S. State Department Report on Global Antisemitism.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim that recent European antisemitic violence can actually be seen as a spillover from the long running [[Arab–Israeli conflict|Arab-Israeli conflict]] since the majority of the perpetrators are from the [[Islam in Europe|large Muslim immigrant communities in European cities]]. However, compared to France, the United Kingdom and much of the rest of Europe, in Germany Arab and pro-Palestinian groups are involved in only a small percentage of antisemitic incidents.&lt;ref name = "mgjmsp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/ Stephen Roth Institute, Tel Aviv University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817134910/http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/ |date=17 August 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism'', most of the more extreme attacks on Jewish sites and physical attacks on Jews in Europe come from militant Islamic and Muslim groups, and most Jews tend to be assaulted in countries where groups of young Muslim immigrants reside.&lt;ref name=roth&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2004/general-analysis.htm GENERAL ANALYSIS 2004], The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism, Tel Aviv University.

On 1 January 2006, Britain's chief [[rabbi]], Lord [[Jonathan Sacks]], warned that what he called a "tsunami of antisemitism" was spreading globally. In an interview with [[BBC Radio 4]], Sacks said: "A number of my rabbinical colleagues throughout Europe have been assaulted and attacked on the streets. We've had synagogues desecrated. We've had Jewish schools burnt to the ground—not here but in France. People are attempting to silence and even ban Jewish societies on campuses on the grounds that Jews must support the state of Israel, therefore they should be banned, which is quite extraordinary because... British Jews see themselves as British citizens. So it's that kind of feeling that you don't know what's going to happen next that's making... some European Jewish communities uncomfortable."&lt;ref name=Gillan&gt;Gillan, Audrey.

Following an escalation in antisemitism in 2012, which included the [[Toulouse and Montauban shootings|deadly shooting of three children]] at a Jewish school in France, the [[European Jewish Congress]] demanded in July a more proactive response. EJC President Moshe Kantor explained, "We call on authorities to take a more proactive approach so there would be no reason for statements of regret and denunciation. All these smaller attacks remind me of smaller tremors before a massive earthquake. The Jewish community cannot afford to be subject to an earthquake and the authorities cannot say that the writing was not on the wall." He added that European countries should take legislative efforts to ban any form of [[incitement]], as well as to equip the authorities with the necessary tools to confront any attempt to expand [[terrorist]] and violent activities against Jewish communities in Europe.&lt;ref name=EJP&gt;{{cite news|last=Shamee|first=Maureen|title='Proactive' response needed to escalation of anti-Semitic attacks across Europe, says European Jewish Congress|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/news/uk/59964|accessdate=13 July 2012|newspaper=European Jewish Press|date=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Mohammed Merah [[Toulouse and Montauban shootings|opened fire at a Jewish school]] in Toulouse, killing a teacher and three children. An 8-year-old girl was shot in the head at point blank range. President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] said that it was "obvious" it was an antisemitic attack&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=School Shooting Gun Same As Other Attacks|url=http://news.sky.com/home/world-news/article/16191704|newspaper=Sky News|date=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that, "I want to say to all the leaders of the Jewish community, how close we feel to them. All of France is by their side." The Israeli Prime Minister condemned the "despicable anti-Semitic" murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Netanyahu: Murder in French Jewish school a 'despicable anti-Semitic' attack|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/netanyahu-murder-in-french-jewish-school-a-despicable-anti-semitic-attack-1.419570|publisher=Haaretz|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Toulouse shooting: Same gun and motorbike used in Jewish and soldier attacks|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/9152469/France-school-shooting-Four-dead-at-Ozar-Hatorah-school-in-Toulouse.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a 32-hour siege and standoff with the police outside his house, and a French raid, Merah jumped off a balcony and was shot in the head and killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McNicoll|first=Tracy|title=Mohamed Merah Dies in French Standoff’s Gory End|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/03/22/mohamed-merah-dies-in-french-standoff-s-gory-end.html|accessdate=15 February 2014|newspaper=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merah told police during the standoff that he intended to keep on attacking, and he loved death the way the police loved life.

4 months later, in July 2012, a French Jewish teenager wearing a "distinctive religious symbol" was the victim of a violent antisemitic attack on a train travelling between Toulouse and Lyon. The teen was first verbally harassed and later beaten up by two assailants. [[Richard Prasquier]] from the French Jewish umbrella group, [[Conseil Représentatif des Institutions juives de France|CRIF]], called the attack "another development in the worrying trend of anti-Semitism in our country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Toulouse yeshiva student beaten up in anti-Semitic attack Read more: Toulouse yeshiva student beaten up in anti-Semitic attack|newspaper=[[Times of Israel]]|date=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another incident in July 2012 dealt with the vandalism of the synagogue of [[Noisy-le-Grand]] of the [[Seine-Saint-Denis]] district in [[Paris]]. The synagogue was vandalized three times in a ten-day period. Prayer books and shawls were thrown on the floor, windows were shattered, drawers were ransacked, and walls, tables, clocks, and floors were vandalized. The authorities were alerted of the incidents by the Bureau National de Vigilance Contre L'Antisémtisme (BNVCA), a French antisemitism watchdog group, which called for more measures to be taken to prevent future hate crimes. BNVCA President Sammy Ghozlan stated that, "Despite the measures taken, things persist, and I think that we need additional legislation, because the Jewish community is annoyed."&lt;ref name=Algemeiner1&gt;{{cite news|title=French Synagogue Vandalized For Third Time in Ten Days|url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/07/12/french-synagogue-vandalized-for-third-time-in-ten-days/|accessdate=13 July 2012|newspaper=Algemeiner|date=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, [[Abraham Cooper]], the dean of the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]], met French Interior Minister [[Manuel Valls]] and reported that antisemitic attacks against French Jews increased by 40% since [[Toulouse and Montauban shootings|Merah's shooting spree]] in [[Toulouse]]. Cooper pressed Valls to take extra measures to secure the safety of French Jews, as well as to discuss strategies to foil an increasing trend of lone-wolf terrorists on the Internet.&lt;ref name="IHA"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=5606 | title=Anti-Semitic attacks in France surge by 40% since March | publisher=Israel Hayom | website=Reuters; Israel Hayom | date=29 August 2012 | accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, two women were assaulted in Germany, sprayed with tear gas, and were shown a "[[Nazi salute|Hitler salute]]," apparently because of a [[Star of David]] necklace that they wore.&lt;ref name="Frauen im"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nordbayern.de/region/fuerth/frauen-im-freizeitbad-beleidigt-und-mit-reizgas-bespruht-1.2227517 | title=Frauen im Freizeitbad beleidigt und mit Reizgas besprüht | publisher=Nordbayern | date=3 August 2012 | accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late August 2012, [[Berlin]] police investigated an attack on a 53-year-old rabbi and his 6-year-old daughter, allegedly by four Arab teens, after which the rabbi needed treatment for head wounds at a hospital. The police classified the attack as a hate crime. ''Jüdische Allgemeine'' reported that the rabbi was wearing a [[kippah]] and was approached by one of the teens, who asked the rabbi if he was Jewish. The teen then attacked the rabbi while yelling antisemitic comments, and threatened to kill the rabbi's daughter. Berlin's mayor condemned the attack, saying that "Berlin is an international city in which intolerance, xenophobia and anti-Semitism are not being tolerated. Police will undertake all efforts to find and arrest the perpetrators."&lt;ref name="VoNG"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vosizneias.com/112634/2012/08/29/germany-berlin-rabbi-and-his-six-year-old-daughter-become-victims-of-a-hate-crime/ | title=Germany – Berlin Rabbi And His Six-Year-Old Daughter Become Victims Of A Hate Crime | publisher=Vos Iz Neias | date=29 August 2012 | accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, various historians, including Dr. Julius H. Schoeps, a prominent German-Jewish historian and a member of the German Interior Ministry's commission to combat antisemitism, charged the majority of [[Bundestag]] deputies with failing to understand antisemitism and the imperativeness of periodic legislative reports on German antisemitism. Schoeps cited various antisemitic statements by German parliament members as well. The report in question determined that 15% of Germans are antisemitic while over 20% espouse "latent anti-Semitism," but the report has been criticized for downplaying the sharpness of antisemitism in Germany, as well as for failing to examine anti-Israel media coverage in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=289609 | title=Historian slams Germany for ignoring anti-semitism | publisher=The Jerusalem Post | date=28 October 2012 | accessdate=29 October 2012 |author=Weinthal, Benjamin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greece====
{{Main|Antisemitism in Greece}}

Antisemitism in Greece manifests itself in religious, political and media discourse. The recent [[Greek government-debt crisis]] has facilitated the rise of far right groups in Greece, most notably the formerly obscure [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn]].
Jews have lived in Greece since antiquity, but the largest community of around 20,000 [[Sephardic Jews]] settled in [[Thessalonica]] after an invitation from the [[Ottoman Sultan]] in the 15th century. After Thessalonica was annexed to Greece in 1913, the Greek government recognized Jews as Greek citizens with full rights and attributed Judaism the status of a recognized and protected religion. Currently in Greece, Jewish communities representing the 5,000 Greek Jews are legal entities under public law. 
According to the [[Anti-Defamation League|ADL]] (Anti-Defamation League) report of 2015, the "ADL Global 100", a report of the status of antisemitism in 100 countries around the world, 69% of the adult population in Greece harbor antisemitic attitudes and 85% think that "Jews have too much power in the business world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ADL Global 100: Greece|url=http://global100.adl.org/#country/greece/2014|website=ADL Global 100|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2015, a survey about the Greeks' perceptions of the holocaust was published. Its findings showed that less than 60 percent of the respondents think that holocaust teaching should be included in the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=van Versendaal|first1=Harry|title=Victimhood culture spawns Greek anti-Semitism, study finds|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/168389/article/ekathimerini/community/victimhood-culture-spawns-greek-anti-semitism-study-finds|accessdate=31 August 2015|work=ekathimerini|date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hungary====

[[File:Jobbik-NewHungarianGuard-May2013.jpg|thumb|150px|Members of the New Hungarian Guard stand at a Jobbik rally against a gathering of the [[World Jewish Congress]] in Budapest, 4 May 2013]]
In the 21st century, antisemitism in Hungary has evolved and received an institutional framework, while verbal and physical aggression against Jews has escalated, creating a great difference between its earlier manifestations in the 1990s and recent developments. One of the major representatives of this institutionalized antisemitic ideology is the popular Hungarian party [[Jobbik]], which received 17 percent of the vote in the April 2010 national election. The far-right subculture, which ranges from nationalist shops to radical-nationalist and neo-Nazi festivals and events, plays a major role in the institutionalization of Hungarian antisemitism in the 21st century. The contemporary antisemitic rhetoric has been updated and expanded, but is still based on the old antisemitic notions. The traditional accusations and motifs include such phrases as Jewish occupation, international Jewish conspiracy, Jewish responsibility for the [[Treaty of Trianon]], Judeo-Bolshevism, as well as blood libels against Jews. Nevertheless, the past few years have seen the reemergence of the blood libel and an increase in Holocaust relativization and denial, while the monetary crisis has revived references to the "Jewish banker class".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/article/anti-semitism-in-hungary/|title=Anti-Semitism in Hungary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Italy====
{{Main|Antisemitism in 21st-century Italy}}

The ongoing political conflict between Israel and Palestine has played an important role in the development and expression of [[antisemitism in the 21st century]], and in Italy as well. The [[Second Intifada]], which began in late September 2000, has set in motion unexpected mechanisms, whereby traditional anti-Jewish prejudices were mixed with politically based stereotypes.&lt;ref name=EUMC&gt;{{cite web|title=Manifestations of anti-Semitism in the European Union|url=http://www.erinnern.at/bundeslaender/oesterreich/e_bibliothek/antisemitismus-1/431_anti-semitism_in_the_european_union.pdf|publisher=EUMC|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this belief system, Israeli Jews were charged with full responsibility for the fate of the peace process and with the conflict presented as embodying the struggle between good (the Palestinians) and evil (the Israeli Jews).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antisemitism Summary overview of the situation in the European Union 2001–2011|url=http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/2215-FRA-2012-Antisemitism-update-2011_EN.pdf|publisher=FRA|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
{{Further|History of the Jews in the Netherlands}}
The [[Netherlands]] has the second highest incidence of antisemitic incidents in the European Union. However, it is difficult to obtain exact figures because the specific groups against whom attacks are made are not specifically identified in police reports, and analyses of police data for antisemitism therefore relies on key-word searches, e.g. "Jew" or "Israel". According to Centre for Information and Documentation on Israel (CIDI), a pro-Israel lobby group in the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Over CIDI (Dutch)|url=http://www.cidi.nl/over-cidi/|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the number of antisemitic incidents reported in the whole of the Netherlands was 108 in 2008, 93 in 2009, and 124 in 2010. Some two thirds of this are acts of aggression. There are approximately 52 000 [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Nieuwe CIDI Monitor antisemitisme" (Dutch)|url=http://www.niw.nl/nieuwe-cidi-monitor-antisemitisme/|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the NRC Handelsblad newspaper, the number of antisemitic incidents in [[Amsterdam]] was 14 in 2008 and 30 in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Berkhout, Karel.

Retrieved on 1 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Raphaël Evers, an [[Orthodox judaism|orthodox]] rabbi in [[Amsterdam]], told the [[Norway|Norwegian]] newspaper [[Aftenposten]] that Jews can no longer be safe in the city anymore due to the risk of violent assaults. "We Jews no longer feel at home here in the Netherlands. Many people talk about moving to Israel," he said.&lt;ref name="aftenposten.no"&gt;[http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/uriks/article3584266.ece Hets av jøder er økende i Europa – Aftenposten] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411225535/http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/uriks/article3584266.ece |date=11 April 2012 }}. Aftenposten.no. Retrieved 2 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Anne Frank Foundation]], antisemitism in the Netherlands in 2011 was roughly at the same level as in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nieuwe rapportage – anne frank|url=http://m.annefrank.org/key/aWQ9MTUwMjQmbGM9bmw=|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actual antisemitic incidents increased from 19 in 2010 to 30 in 2011. Verbal antisemitic incidents dropped slightly from 1173 in 2010 to 1098 in 2011. This accounts for 75%–80% of all verbal racist incidents in the Netherlands. Antisemitism is more prevalent in the age group 23–27 years, which is a younger group than that of racist incidents in general.

====Norway====
{{Main|Antisemitism in Norway}}
In 2010, the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] after one year of research, revealed that antisemitism was common among some 8th, 9th, and 10th graders in Oslo's schools. Teachers at schools with large numbers of [[Muslim]]s revealed that Muslim students often "praise or admire Adolf Hitler for his killing of [[Jew]]s", that "Jew-hate is legitimate within vast groups of Muslim students" and that "Muslims laugh or command [teachers] to stop when trying to educate about the [[Holocaust]]". Additionally, "while some students might protest when some express support for [[terrorism]], none object when students express hate of Jews", saying that it says in "the [[Quran]] that you shall kill Jews, all true Muslims hate Jews". Most of these students were said to be born and raised in Norway. One [[Jew]]ish father also stated that his child had been taken by a Muslim mob after school (though the child managed to escape), reportedly "to be taken out to the forest and [[lynching|hung]] because he was a Jew".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www1.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/205057|work=NRK Lørdagsrevyen|title=Jødiske blir hetset|date=13 March 2010|access-date=5 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419230618/http://www1.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/205057|archive-date=19 April 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What about Norwegian anti-Semitism?|url=http://theforeigner.no/pages/columns/what-about-norwegian-anti-semitism/|accessdate=15 February 2014|newspaper=The Foreigner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norwegian Education Minister Kristin Halvorsen referred to the antisemitism reported in this study as being "completely unacceptable." The head of a local Islamic council joined Jewish leaders and Halvorsen in denouncing such antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-semitism report shocks officials|url=http://www.newsinenglish.no/2010/03/16/anti-semitism-report-shocks-officials/|accessdate=15 February 2014|newspaper=News in English – News and Views from Norway|date=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, the [[Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe]] issued a report regarding antisemitism in Norway, criticizing Norway for an increase in antisemitism in the country and blaming Norwegian officials for failing to address antisemitism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/10/26/report-criticizes-norway-for-rise-in-anti-semitism/ | title=Report Criticizes Norway for Rise in Anti-Semitism | publisher=The Algemeiner | date=26 October 2012 | accessdate=28 October 2012 | author=Pontz, Zach}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early 2000s, levels of antisemitism in Russia have been low, and steadily decreasing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://regnum.ru/news/society/1895352.html В Москве представлен отчет об антисемитизме в 2014 году] Москва, 13 Февраля 2015, 21:46 — REGNUM&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=feor&gt;[http://ria.ru/interview/20141107/1032029411.html Президент ФЕОР: Россия — "остров спокойствия" на фоне Западной Европы] 11:0007.11.2014 (обновлено: 11:42 07.11.2014)&lt;/ref&gt; President of the [[Russian Jewish Congress]] attributes this in part to the vanished state sponsorship of antisemitism.

Still, since the mid-2000s incorporation of antisemitic discourse into the platforms and speeches of nationalist political movements in Russia has been reported by [[human rights]] monitors in Russia as well as in the press.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} A number of prominent modern Russian politicians are known for their  antisemitic views.

After Germany and Austria, Sweden has the highest rate of antisemitic incidents in Europe, though the Netherlands has reported a higher rate of antisemitism in some years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A government study in 2006 estimated that 15% of Swedes agree with the statement: "The Jews have too much influence in the world today".&lt;ref name="GovStudy"&gt;Henrik Bachner and Jonas Ring.{{cite web|url=http://intolerans.levandehistoria.se/article/article_docs/antisemitism_english.pdf |title=Antisemitic images and attitudes in Sweden |accessdate=21 February 2007 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221140257/http://intolerans.levandehistoria.se/article/article_docs/antisemitism_english.pdf |archivedate=21 February 2007 |df=dmy }} . levandehistoria.se&lt;/ref&gt; 5% of the total adult population and 39% of adult Muslims "harbour systematic antisemitic views".&lt;ref name="GovStudy"/&gt; The former prime minister [[Göran Persson]] described these results as "surprising and terrifying". However, the rabbi of Stockholm's Orthodox Jewish community, Meir Horden, said that "It's not true to say that the Swedes are anti-Semitic.

In 2009, a synagogue that served the Jewish community in Malmö was set ablaze. Jewish cemeteries were repeatedly desecrated, worshippers were abused while returning home from prayer, and masked men mockingly chanted "Hitler" in the streets. As a result of security concerns, Malmö's synagogue has guards and rocket-proof glass in the windows, and the Jewish kindergarten can only be reached through thick steel security doors.&lt;ref name="Malmo Jews leaving Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/sweden/7278532/Jews-leave-Swedish-city-after-sharp-rise-in-anti-Semitic-hate-crimes.html | title=Jews leave Swedish city after sharp rise in anti-Semitic hate crimes | work=The Telegraph | date=21 February 2012 | accessdate=24 July 2012 | author=Meo, Nick | location=Malmo, Sweden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 an [[Institute for Jewish Policy Research]] survey found that the levels of anti-Semitism in Great Britain were among the lowest in the world, with 2.4% expressing multiple anti-Semitic attitudes, and about 70% having a favourable opinion of Jews. However, only 17% had a favourable opinion of Israel, with 33% holding an unfavourable view.&lt;ref name=bbc-20170913&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41241353 |title=Over a quarter of British people 'hold anti-Semitic attitudes', study finds |last=May |first=Callum |work=BBC News |date=13 September 2017 |accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jpr-201709&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.jpr.org.uk/documents/JPR.2017.Antisemitism_in_contemporary_Great_Britain.pdf |title=Antisemitism in contemporary Great Britain |author=L.

In 2017, a report by the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA) found that the previous year, 2016, had been the worst on record for antisemitic hate crime in the UK.&lt;ref name="Campaign Against Antisemitism"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://antisemitism.uk/crime|title=National Antisemitic Crime Audit|publisher=Campaign Against Antisemitism|date=1 May 2016|access-date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, 2015 had been the worst year on record, and 2014 was the worst year on record before that. The report found that in 2016, antisemitic crime rose by 15% compared to 2015, or 45% compared to 2014. It also found that 1 in 10 antisemitic crimes was violent. Despite rising levels of antisemitic crime, the report said there had been a decrease in the [[Criminal charge|charging]] of antisemitic crime. In the report's foreword, the CAA's Chairman wrote: "Britain has the political will to fight antisemitism and strong laws with which to do it, but those responsible for tackling the rapidly growing racist targeting of British Jews are failing to enforce the law. There is a very real danger of Jewish citizens emigrating, as has happened elsewhere in Europe unless there is radical change."&lt;ref name="Campaign Against Antisemitism"/&gt;

Every year since 2015, the CAA has commissioned polling by [[YouGov]] concerning the attitude of the British public toward British Jews. In 2017, their polling found that 36% of British adults believed at least one of the antisemitic statements pollsters had shown them to be true, a reduction from 39% in 2016 and 45% in 2015. Additionally, the polling revealed widespread fear amongst British Jews, with almost 1 in 3 saying that they had considered emigrating in the last two years due to antisemitism, and 37% saying that they concealed their Judaism in public. The report gave various indications as to the cause of the fears, with British Jews identifying Islamist antisemitism, far-left antisemitism and far-right antisemitism as their main concerns, in that order. 78% of British Jews saying that they had witnessed antisemitism disguised as a political comment about Israel, 76% thoughts that political developments were contributing antisemitism, and 52% felt that the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] was not doing enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://antisemitism.uk/barometer/|title=Antisemitism Barometer|publisher=Campaign Against Antisemitism|date=11 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205173252/https://antisemitism.uk/barometer/|archive-date=5 February 2017|access-date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://antisemitism.uk/barometer-full-report|title=Annual Antisemitic Barometer 2015 Full Report|type=PDF|publisher=Campaign Against Antisemitism|access-date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a group of British [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]] set up an inquiry into antisemitism, which published its findings in 2006. Its report stated that "until recently, the prevailing opinion both within the Jewish community and beyond [had been] that antisemitism had receded to the point that it existed only on the margins of society." It found a reversal of this progress since 2000. The inquiry was reconstituted following a surge in antisemitic incidents in Britain during the summer of 2014, and the new inquiry published its report in 2015, making recommendations for reducing antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/129862/key-recommendations-include-call-police-and-council-involvement|title=Key recommendations include call for police and council involvement|website=www.thejc.com|access-date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although antisemitism in Canada is less prevalent than in many other countries, there have been recent incidents. For example, a 2004 study identified 24 incidents of antisemitism between 14 March and 14 July 2004 in Newfoundland, Montreal, Quebec City, Ottawa, the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), and some smaller Ontario communities. The incidents included vandalism and other attacks on four synagogues, six cemeteries, four schools, and a number of businesses and private residences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-prutschi-f04.htm|title=Anti-Semitism in Canada  - Manuel Prutschi|website=www.jcpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, the [[U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] examined antisemitism on college campuses. It reported that "incidents of threatened bodily injury, physical intimidation or property damage are now rare", but antisemitism still occurs on many campuses and is a "serious problem." The Commission recommended that the [[U.S. Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]] protect college students from antisemitism through vigorous enforcement of ''Title VI'' of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and further recommended that [[United States Congress|Congress]] clarify that Title VI applies to discrimination against Jewish students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eusccr.com/Ending%20Campus%20Ant-Semitism1.htm Ending Campus Anti-Semitism].

On 19 September 2006, [[Yale University]] founded the [[Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Anti-Semitism]] (YIISA), the first North American university-based center for study of the subject, as part of its Institution for Social and Policy Studies. Director [[Charles A.

After carrying out a routine review, the faculty review committee said that the initiative had not met its research and teaching standards. [[Donald Green]], then head of Yale's Institution for Social and Policy Studies, the body under whose aegis the antisemitism initiative was run, said that it had not had many papers published in the relevant leading journals or attracted many students.

A 2007 survey by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) concluded that 15% of Americans hold antisemitic views, which was in-line with the average of the previous ten years, but a decline from the 29% of the early sixties. The survey concluded that education was a strong predictor, "with most educated Americans being remarkably free of prejudicial views." The belief that Jews have too much power was considered a common antisemitic view by the ADL. Other views indicating antisemitism, according to the survey, include the view that Jews are more loyal to Israel than America, and that they are responsible for the death of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]]. The survey found that antisemitic Americans are likely to be intolerant generally, e.g. regarding immigration and free-speech. The 2007 survey also found that 29% of foreign-born [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanics]] and 32% of [[African American|African-Americans]] hold strong antisemitic beliefs, three times more than the 10% for whites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/poll_2007/ ADL Survey: American Attitudes Towards Jews in America].

In August 2012, the [[California state assembly]] approved a [[non-binding resolution]] that "encourages university leaders to combat a wide array of anti-Jewish and anti-Israel actions," although the resolution "is purely symbolic and does not carry policy implications."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/calif-resolution-denouncing-anti-semitism-on-college-campuses-targets-anti-israel-protests/2012/08/29/17a0188a-f1b2-11e1-b74c-84ed55e0300b_story.html|title=Calif. resolution denouncing anti-Semitism on college campuses targets anti-Israel protests|website=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, ''[[Politico|Politico Magazine]]'' published an article purporting to show links between U.S. President [[Donald Trump]], Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] and the Jewish outreach organization [[Chabad-Lubavitch]]. The article was widely condemned, with the head of the Anti-Defamation League [[Jonathan Greenblatt]] saying that it "evokes age-old myths about Jews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zalman|first1=Jonathan|title=Politico’s Dubious Chabad Story Receives Widespread Criticism|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/229930/politicos-dubious-chabad-story-receives-widespread-criticism|accessdate=10 April 2017|publisher=Tablet Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Politico goes full ‘Elders of Zion,’ silenced by the college mob &amp; other comments|url=https://nypost.com/2017/04/10/politico-goes-full-elders-of-zion-silenced-by-the-college-mob-other-comments/|accessdate=10 April 2017|publisher=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, Jonathan Greenblatt, national director and CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, stated in an interview, “While anti-Semitic attitudes have remained consistent at 14%... anti-Semitic incidents have been on the rise. In 2016 we saw a 34% increase over the prior year in acts of harassment, vandalism, or violence directed at Jewish individuals and institutions. During the first three quarters of 2017, there was a 67% increase over the same period in 2016. We’ve seen double the number of incidents in K-12 schools, and almost a 60% increase on college campuses." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://reformjudaism.org/blog/2017/11/27/we-cant-just-rely-old-tactics|title=We Can't Just Rely on the Old Tactics|website=ReformJudaism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art competitions at the 1936 Games were similar to the 1928 and 1932 Games, with medals being awarded in multiple subcategories for each of the five artistic categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Olympic Art Competition 1936 Berlin |work=Olympic Games Museum |author=Wagner, Juergen |url=http://olympic-museum.de/art/1936.htm |accessdate=2008-03-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080501132445/http://www.olympic-museum.de/art/1936.htm| archivedate= 1 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The judges declined to award any medals for three subcategories, and no gold medals for another three subcategories.

Art competitions were part of the Olympic program from 1912 to 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=In Search of the Lost Champions of the Olympic Art Contests |last=Kramer |first=Bernhard |journal=Journal of Olympic History |volume=12 |issue=2 |date=May 2004 |pages=29–34 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv12n2/johv12n2m.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-03-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080410082301/http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv12n2/johv12n2m.pdf| archivedate= 10 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At a meeting of the [[International Olympic Committee]] in 1949, it was decided to hold art ''exhibitions'' instead, as it was judged illogical to permit professionals to compete in the art competitions but only amateurs were permitted to compete in sporting events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Report on Art Exhibitions |last=Bolanaki |first=A. |journal=Bulletin du Comité International Olympique |issue=27 |date=June 1951 |page=34 |publisher=International Olympic Committee |location=Lausanne |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1951/BDCE27/BDCE27l.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-03-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080410082302/http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1951/BDCE27/BDCE27l.pdf| archivedate= 10 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1952, a non-competitive art and cultural festival has been associated with each Games.

and was constructed in concrete, steel, zinc and copper sheet.&lt;ref&gt;''Lancashire Evening Telegraph''. (2002-06-14).

Newsquest Media Group. Retrieved 2008-06-05.&lt;/ref&gt; The harnessing of [[wave energy]], and the sculpting of the concrete and metals, is said to produce a unique interpretation of Blackpool's natural and man-made environments. 

The instrument is played by the sea at high tide through eight pipes attached to the [[sea wall]]. These are connected under the [[promenade]] to 18 organ pipes within the sculpture. The swell of seawater at high tide pushes air up the sea-wall pipes and causes the organ pipes to sound. The best time to hear the ''High Tide Organ'' is two to three hours before or after high tide. On very calm days the organ is silent for part of its cycle. The pitches of the pipes are based on the [[harmonic]] series in [[B-flat major|B flat]].

The ''High Tide Organ'' is one of a small group of musical instruments that operate without further human intervention, among which the [[aeolian harp]] and the [[wind chime]] are the most notable.

{{Italic title}}
'''''Capital, Volume II: The Process of Circulation of Capital''''' is the second of three volumes of ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy]]''. It was prepared by [[Friedrich Engels]] from notes left by [[Karl Marx]] and published in 1885.

==Contents==
Volume II is divided into three parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Capital Vol2.|isbn=0-7178-0483-6|last=Engels|first=Friedrich|publisher=International Publishers Co, Inc.|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The Metamorphoses of Capital and Their Circuits
# The Turnover of Capital
# The [[reproduction (economics)|Reproduction]] and Circulation of the Aggregate Social Capital

In this book, the main ideas behind the marketplace are to be found: how value and surplus-value are realized. Its dramatis personae, not so much the worker and the industrialist (as in Volume I), but rather the money owner (and money lender), the wholesale merchant, the trader and the entrepreneur or 'functioning capitalist.' Moreover, workers appear in Volume II, essentially as buyers of consumer goods and, therefore, as sellers of the commodity [[labour power]], rather than producers of value and [[surplus-value]] (although, this latter quality, established in Volume I, remains the solid foundation on which the whole of the unfolding analysis is based).

Marx wrote in a letter sent to Engels on 30 April 1868: 'In Book 1. . . we content ourselves with the assumption that if in the self-expansion process £100 becomes £110, the latter will find ''already in existence in the market'' the elements into which it will change once more. But now we investigate the conditions under which these elements are found at hand, namely the social intertwining of the different capitals, of the component parts of capital and of revenue (= s).' This intertwining, conceived as a movement of commodities and of money, enabled Marx to work out at least the essential elements, if not the definitive form of a coherent theory of the trade cycle, based upon the inevitability of periodic disequilibrium between supply and demand under the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] (Mandel, 1978, Intro to Vol. II of ''Capital'').

Part 3 is the point of departure for the topic of [[capital accumulation]], which was given its Marxist treatment later in detail by, among others, [[Rosa Luxemburg]].

The term "'''capitalist realism'''" has been used, particularly in [[Germany]], to describe commodity-based art, from [[Pop Art]] in the 1950s and 1960s to the commodity art of the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, p.53&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it has been used to describe the ideological-aesthetic aspect of contemporary [[corporate capitalism]] in the West. When used in this way, it is a play on the term "[[socialist realism]]".

==In art==
Although attested earlier,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. by [[Abraham Polonsky]] of [[Edward Dmytryk|Edward Dmytryk's]] ''[[The Caine Mutiny (film)|The Caine Mutiny]]'': William Pechter and Abraham Polonsky, 'Abraham Polonsky and "Force of Evil"', ''Film Quarterly'', 15.3 [Special Issue on Hollywood] (Spring, 1962), 47-54 (p. 53); https://www.jstor.org/stable/1210628.&lt;/ref&gt; the phrase "capitalist realism" was first used in the title of the 1963 [[art exhibition]] in [[Düsseldorf, Germany|Düsseldorf]], ''Demonstration for Capitalist Realism'', which featured the work of [[Gerhard Richter]], [[Sigmar Polke]], [[Wolf Vostell]], and [[:de:Konrad Fischer (Maler)|Konrad Lueg]].&lt;ref&gt;Honour, Hugh. ''A World History of Art'', Laurence King Publishing, p847. {{ISBN|1-85669-451-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The exhibition's participants focused upon depictions of Germany's growing consumer culture and media-saturated society with strategies, in part, influenced by those of their American Pop&lt;ref name="Living With Pop: A Reproduction of Capitalist Realism' at Artists Space"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://observer.com/2014/07/living-with-pop-a-reproduction-of-capitalist-realism-at-artists-space/ | title=Living With Pop: A Reproduction of Capitalist Realism' at Artists Space | publisher=The New York Observer | date=23 July 2014 | accessdate=20 November 2014 | author=Pollack,  Maika | quote=It was a reaction to Pop from a postwar Germany divided between East and West.}}&lt;/ref&gt; counterparts. The recent rise in [[Pop art|Pop Art]] in German culture was coupled by a fascination with America, which served as a stimulation for the piece. They were inspired primarily by the iconography depicted in newspapers and magazines.

==Sigmar Polke==
{{main|Sigmar Polke}}

Capitalist realism is a German art movement co-founded in 1963 by artist [[Sigmar Polke]].&lt;ref name="German artist Sigmar Polke, creator of 'Higher Beings Command,' dies at 69"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/12/AR2010061203694.html | title=German artist Sigmar Polke, creator of 'Higher Beings Command,' dies at 69 | publisher=The Washington Post | date=13 June 2010 | accessdate=17 November 2014 | author=Schudel, Matt | quote=In the 1960s, Mr. Polke was at the vanguard of a German artistic movement called capitalist realism, along with fellow painter Gerhard Richter -- who later expressed reservations about his colleague's work, saying "he refuses to accept any borders, any limits."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polke embraced the advertising and publicity commonly found in the popular press in renderings of everyday consumer items. Often ironic and with critical overtones of society and politics the Capitalist Realism movement is considered more explicitly political than conventional Pop Art.&lt;ref&gt;Crow, Thomas.

==Michael Schudson==
{{main|Michael Schudson}}

In the mid-1980s, [[Michael Schudson]] used the term "capitalist realism" to describe mainstream practices in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, p.55&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter seven of Schudson's ''Advertising: The Uneasy Persuasion'' compares the messages and appeals of advertising to those found in the Socialist Realism of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schudson, 'Advertising as Capitalist Realism', in ''Advertising, The Uneasy Persuasion: Its Dubious Impact on American Society'' (New York: Basic Books, 1984), pp. 209-33 (repr. in ''
Advertising &amp; Society Review'', vol. 1, issue 1 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; In his account, the realism of advertising promotes a way of life based on private consumption, rather than social, public achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Harry; MacRury, Isin; Botterill, Jackie. ''The Dynamics of Advertising'', Routledge, 2000, p99. {{ISBN|90-5823-085-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mark Fisher==
{{main|Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?}}

The term next appeared in 2009 with the publication of Mark Fisher's book ''[[Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?]]''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mark Fisher, ''Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?'' (Winchester, UK; Washington [D.C.]: Zero, 2009); {{ISBN|978-1-84694-317-1}} (pbk.); 1846943175 (pbk.).&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher argues that the term "capitalist realism" best describes the current global political situation, which lacks visible alternatives to the capitalist system which became dominant following the fall of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His argument is a response to, and critique of, [[neo-liberalism]] and new forms of government which apply the logic of [[capitalism]] and the market to all aspects of governance.

His ideology refers to a perceived "widespread sense that not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system, but also that it is now impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative to it". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?|last=Fisher|first=Mark|publisher=Zero Books|year=2010|isbn=|location=Winchester, UK|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a philosophical concept, capitalist realism is influenced by the [[Althusserian]] conception of ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?|last=Fisher|first=Mark|publisher=Zero Books|year=2009|isbn=978-1846943171|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher proposes that within a capitalist framework there is no space to conceive of alternative forms of social structures, adding that younger generations are not even concerned with recognizing alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Capitalist Realism. Is There No Alternative?|last=Fisher|first=Mark|publisher=O Books|year=2009|isbn=9781846943171|location=|pages=8|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He proposes that the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2008 financial crisis]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; compounded this position. Rather than catalyzing a desire to seek alternatives for the existing model, the crisis reinforced the notion that modifications must be made within the existing system. The crash confirmed within the populace the necessity of capitalism rather than shake it loose from its foundations.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Capitalist realism as I understand it cannot be confined to art or to the quasi-propagandistic way in which advertising functions. It is more like a pervasive atmosphere, conditioning not only the production of culture but also the regulation of work and education, and acting as a kind of invisible barrier constraining thought and action.''&lt;ref&gt;Mark Fisher, ''Capitalist Realism: Is there no Alternative?'' (Winchester, UK; Washington [D.C.]: Zero, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fisher argues that capitalist realism has propagated a 'business [[ontology]]' which concludes that everything should be run as a business including education and healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Fisher, ''Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?'' (Winchester, UK; Washington [D.C.]: Zero, 2009, pg15).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the publication of Fisher's work, the term has been picked up by other literary critics.&lt;ref&gt;Prominently Mark Fisher and Jeremy Gilbert, 'Capitalist Realism and Neoliberal Hegemony: A Dialogue', ''New Formations'', 80--81 (2013), 89--101 DOI:10.3898/NEWF.80/81.05.2013; ''Reading Capitalist Realism'', ed. by Alison Shonkwiler and Leigh Claire La Berge (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Death of the [[Reprobate]]''''' (33.4 x 19.6 cm) is an oil on panel painting by a follower of [[Hieronymus Bosch]] which depicts the deathbed struggle for the human soul between an angel and a demon. The style is somewhat similar to his ''[[Death of the Miser]]''. It is held in a private collection in [[New York City]], United States.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abcgallery.com/B/bosch/bosch31.html |title=Hieronymus Bosch: Death of the Reprobate |date=9 August 2015 |accessdate=9 August 2015 |work=ABC Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is likely a copy of detail from a larger hell panel. It dates from the second half of the 16th century.

'''''Enclosed Field with Peasant''''' is an [[oil painting]] by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artist [[Vincent van Gogh]], painted in October 1889. It is currently part of the permanent collection at the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]].

==Description==
The painting's hurried lines accentuate a vibrant, moving field. The whole painting seems to pulsate with life, even though only one human is shown. It is the most topographically accurate of four views of a wheat field at the base of the [[Alpilles]]. Van Gogh intended this piece to be a pendant with the painting ''The Reaper''. Van Gogh's iconic style and layering embrace the canvas, making the viewer's eye travel all around the painting. ''Enclosed Field with Peasant'' is a great example of Van Gogh's late work, where his dynamic brush strokes take control of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vincent van Gogh's life - The Later Years|url=http://www.vangoghgallery.com/misc/later.html|publisher=Van Gogh Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical information==
{{main|Saint-Paul Asylum, Saint-Rémy (Van Gogh series)}}
''Enclosed Field with Peasant'' was created during one of the most tumultuous parts of Van Gogh's life, after he voluntarily committed himself to an [[History of psychiatric institutions|asylum]] in [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence|Saint-Rémy]]. He was recuperating from a [[nervous breakdown]] he suffered on [[Christmas Eve]] in 1888, during a visit with fellow [[postimpressionist]] [[Paul Gauguin]].

===Acquisition===
''Enclosed Field with Peasant'' was inherited by van Gogh's brother, [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo van Gogh]] after his brother's death. He gave the painting to his wife, Johanna van Gogh-Bonger as a gift. In May 1905, it was sold to Paul Cassirer, and then to Robert von Mendelssohn. It was inherited by his wife, Giulietta von Mendelssohn, upon his death, and upon her death, was passed to her children, Elenora and [[Francesco von Mendelssohn]]. It was given on consignment to J.K. Thannhauser in New York, from where it was sold to [[Caroline Marmon Fesler]]. Fesler gave the painting to the John Herron Art Institute, now known as the Indianapolis Museum of Art, in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Landscape at Saint-Remy (Enclosed Field with Peasant)|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/landscape-saint-r%C3%A9my-enclosed-field-peasant-gogh-vincent-van|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16279">[[File:Royal Standard of the Netherlands.svg|thumb|260px|Royal Standard of the Netherlands.]]

The '''flags of the Dutch royal family''' are a set of flags used to identify a member of the royal family. The current system of flags for the Dutch monarch, princes, and princesses was introduced in 1908.

== Background ==
The current system of personal flags for the monarch and other members of the royal family was introduced in 1908. In 1907, minor modifications were introduced to the Dutch coat of arms; likewise, a new flag for the Dutch monarch was introduced the following year. These flags are designed by the High Council of Nobility (who are also responsible for heraldry of the royal family) and are granted by royal decree. Like their coats of arms, these flags are usually shared among siblings.

The flags follow a similar pattern and, although not [[banner of arms|banners of arms]], are heavily influenced by heraldry. Flags of those born into the royal family feature a Nassau-blue cross on an orange field, while the colours are reversed for those who marry into the family. Males have near-square flags while those of females are swallowtailed. Elements of an individual's family coat of arms are also incorporated into the flags.

== Use ==
The flags are used to mark the presence of an individual in certain buildings, when on vehicles (e.g. a car or ship), or in an army unit. The flag of the monarch is flown above [[Huis ten Bosch Palace]] in [[The Hague]] (the king's private residence) and above [[Noordeinde Palace]] in The Hague (the king's official residence) when the monarch is in the Netherlands, but not necessarily when he is actually resident. Besides these two residences, the royal standard is flown above other palaces, castles or estates where and when the King is actually staying.

The flags are never flown at half-mast; during a period of mourning, a black [[pennon]] is affixed to the flagpole flying the flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal flags|url=https://www.royal-house.nl/topics/flags/personal-flags|website=www.royal-house.nl|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Royal standard ==
The '''royal flag''' ({{lang-nl|koninklijke vlag}}), or the '''royal standard''' of the [[Netherlands]], is the official flag of the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch monarch]]. This flag is a non-personal distinctive flag and is not changed from reign to reign. The current flag, introduced in 1908, is a square [[orange (colour)|orange]] flag, divided in four quarters by a nassau-blue [[cross]]. These colours refer to the principality of [[Principality of Orange|Orange]] (in [[France]]) and the principality of [[Duchy of Nassau|Nassau]] (in [[Germany]]) from which the present royal family originates. 

In the centre of the flag is the lesser [[Coat of arms of the Netherlands|coat of arms of the Kingdom]] (which originates as a composite of features taken from the arms of the [[house of Nassau]] and the [[Dutch Republic Lion|arms of the Dutch republic]]) surmounted by a [[Crown (headgear)|royal crown]] and surrounded by the insignia of the Grand Cross of the [[Military William Order]]. Each quarter shows a bugle-horn which originates in arms of the principality of Orange.

Image:Arms of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.svg| [[Coat of arms of the Netherlands|Netherlands]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Upon the accession of King [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|Willem-Alexander]] in 2013, the monarch's flag was slightly modified: Instead of a rosette, a bow is placed in the ribbon of the Military William Order. Furthermore, the tassels on the horns now both hang down. The adjustments were applied on 30 April 2013 immediately after Willem-Alexander taking office.

==Princes==
The flag of a Dutch prince is rectangular in shape and of proportions 5:6. Flags of princes born into the royal family consist of a Nassau-blue cross on an orange field. 

Instead of the hunting horn of Orange in the upper right and the lower left quarters found in the monarch's flag, these are replaced with figures obtained from the coat of arms of the family of the prince's parent who married into the royal family. 

Unlike the monarch's flag, the coat of arms of the kingdom is not surrounded by the insignia of the Great Cross of the Military Order of Guillaume, but is placed within an orange circle which replaces the center of the cross.

'''Katherine Milhous''' (1894–1977) was an [[American people |American]] artist, illustrator, and writer. She is known best as the author and illustrator of ''[[The Egg Tree]]'', which won the 1951 [[Caldecott Medal]] for U.S. picture book illustration. Born into a [[Quaker]] family active in the [[printing]] industry in Philadelphia, Milhous is also known for her graphic designs for the [[Works Progress Administration]](WPA). Her work has been exhibited at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] and at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]].

==Life==
Katherine Milhous was born November 27, 1894, to Osborn and Katherine Daly Milhous of Philadelphia, Quakers who made their living as printers. When she was young they moved  to [[Pitman, New Jersey]], a small camp-meeting town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Our Town | work = Pittman, NJ | url = http://members.tripod.com/~passinthru_2/pitman.htm| accessdate = 2012-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to Philadelphia to attend the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] and the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|Pennsylvania Museum School of Industrial Art]].&lt;ref name=WDL1&gt;{{cite web|title=Poster of an Amish Family, Pennsylvania|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/9569/|work=Work Projects Administration Poster Collection|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milhous helped support her schooling by illustrating magazines. In 1934, while at the Academy of Fine Arts, she won the Cresson Traveling Fellowship, which allowed her to study overseas. She then returned to Philadelphia where, for forty years, she shared a studio with friend and fellow-artist Frances Lichten.&lt;ref name=freelibrary&gt;{{cite web | title = Katherine Milhous and Frances Lichten Papers| work = Free Library of Philadelphia | url = http://libwww.freelibrary.org/ead/view.cfm?name=Milhous | accessdate = 2012-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1935 to 1940 Milhous was a supervisor for the Philadelphia [[Federal Art Project]] (FAP), a branch of the [[Works Progress Administration]].&lt;ref name=WDL1/&gt; Among her duties was the creation of posters promoting Pennsylvania. She incorporated familiar [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] designs into her posters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Purchase Posters | work = Kate Milhous | url =http://postersforthepeople.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=kate+milhous&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 |accessdate = 2012-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alice Dalgliesh]], head of the Children's Book division of [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Charles Scribner's &amp; Sons]], saw Milhous' posters during an exhibition in an FAP gallery, and hired her as a staff designer. Milhous co-wrote and illustrated several books with Dalgliesh, who was also an award-winning children's writer. She also illustrated for others, as well as writing and illustrating her own books.&lt;ref name=freelibrary/&gt;

Milhous was a member of the [[AIGA|American Institute of Graphic Arts]]. She died in Philadelphia on December 5, 1977. Her papers are held in the University of Minnesota [[University of Minnesota Libraries#Library buildings and collections | Children's Literature Research Collection]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Katherine Milhous Collection | work = University of Minnesota| url = 
http://special.lib.umn.edu/findaid/xml/CLRC-58.xml| accessdate = 2012-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Free Library of Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name=freelibrary/&gt;

==Critical reception==
Milhous' books were generally well received by reviewers, both for their writing and their illustrations. ''Appalonia's Valentine'' was called "distinguished… original and beautiful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Books for Young People | work = The Saturday Review | url = 
http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1954feb13-00052| accessdate = 2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On ''Patrick and the Golden Slippers'', about Philadelphia's Mummers' Parade, the same magazine wrote "This is a picture book of enduring value to young Americans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Autumn Color | work = The Saturday Review | url = http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1951oct20-00038 | accessdate = 2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her Caldecott Medal-winning ''The Egg Tree'', "Her use of bright [[tempera]] paints brought to life the bold borders and vibrant pages of the book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Biography of Katherine Milhous| work = by Miranda Orso | url = http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Milhous__Katherine.html | accessdate = 2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Killing Jesus: A History''''' is a 2013 book by [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] and [[Martin Dugard (author)|Martin Dugard]] about the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|life]] and [[crucifixion of Jesus]], referred to in the book as [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]]. It is the follow-up to ''[[Killing Kennedy]]'' and ''[[Killing Lincoln]]''. ''Killing Jesus'' was released September 24, 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/killing-jesus-bill-oreilly/1114668114?ean=9780805098549 |title=Killing Jesus: A History |author=Bill O'Reilly |isbn=9780805098549|publisher=[[Barnes &amp; Noble]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; through [[Henry Holt and Company]]. The book was a commercial success, debuting at #1 on ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[The New York Times Non-Fiction Best Sellers of 2013|bestseller list]] and remaining on the list for 52 weeks. Popular reviews of the book were mixed, with both Christian and non-Christian reviewers faulting the book for its tedious writing and its claims of historical objectivity. Scholars and historians have extensively criticized the book for its inaccurate, politically-motivated portrayal of Jesus as a "[[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] Son of God", its uncritical approach to [[primary source]]s, its omission of some of Jesus' teachings, and its oversimplified, sensationalist portrayal of history. Like both its predecessors, the book was adapted into a [[Killing Jesus (miniseries)|television miniseries with the same name]] for [[National Geographic Channel]].

==Writing and research==
According to ''[[The Washington Times]]'', while writing ''Killing Jesus'', O'Reilly and Dugard found that sources were far less plentiful than for the previous books in their ''Killing...'' series.&lt;ref name="Vernon2013"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vernon |first1=Wes |title=BOOK REVIEW: 'Killing Jesus' |url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/25/book-review-killing-jesus/ |accessdate=8 June 2018 |work=The Washington Times |publisher=The Washington Times, LLC |date=25 September 2013 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; They stated that the Internet was "a treasure",&lt;ref name="Vernon2013"/&gt; but complained that the information on various websites was "contradictory",&lt;ref name="Vernon2013"/&gt; that "hearsay was often quoted as truth",&lt;ref name="Vernon2013"/&gt; and that information from one website was frequently shown to be unreliable when checked against information from more reliable sources.&lt;ref name="Vernon2013"/&gt; Bill O'Reilly stated that he believes the book was [[divine inspiration|inspired]] by the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book begins with "A Note to Readers" by Bill O'Reilly, which promises, "...this is not a religious book. We do not address Jesus the Messiah, only as a man who galvanized a remote area of the Roman Empire and made very powerful enemies while preaching a philosophy of peace and love." After a lengthy quotation from the conservative journalist [[Vermont C. Royster]], the introduction concludes: "But the incredible story behind the lethal struggle between good and evil has not been fully told. Until now." The first chapter begins with a [[novel]]istic description of the [[Massacre of the Innocents]] from {{bibleverse|Matthew|2:16–2:18|9}}. The remaining portion of the chapter focusses on [[Herod the Great]], the king of Judaea, the politics of his reign, the visit of the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]], and the birth of Jesus. A lengthy footnote at the end of the chapter defends the historical accuracy of the [[canonical gospels]] and their traditional attributions to [[Matthew the Apostle]], [[John Mark]], [[Luke the Evangelist]], and [[John the Apostle]].

The second chapter describes the life of the Roman general and dictator [[Julius Caesar]], his conquests, his seduction by the Egyptian [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic queen]] [[Cleopatra]], and [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|his eventual assassination]]. Chapter Three summarizes the aftermath of Caesar's murder, the [[Battle of Philippi]], the [[Second Triumvirate]], the [[Octavian]]'s defeat of [[Mark Antony]] and Cleopatra in the [[Battle of Actium]], and Octavian's ascension to the title of ''[[Roman emperor|emperor]]''. The fourth chapter returns to the life of Jesus, describing his worried parents looking for him after he has gone missing during a trip to [[Jerusalem]] for the [[Passover]]. It describes some of the politics of [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman Judaea]], heavily emphasizing the idea that the Jews were victims of Roman totalitarian oppression. Chapter Five describes the [[finding in the Temple]] from {{bibleverse|Luke|2:41-52|9}}, the architecture of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], [[Nazareth]], and the government and political background of [[Galilee]].

[[File:Detail of three disciples on the far left side of the table in Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Detail of three disciples on the far left side of the table in [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|Last Supper]]'', who are shown in a [[black and white]] photograph on page 219 of ''Killing Jesus'']]

Chapter Six describes the preaching of [[John the Baptist]], the arrival of [[Pontius Pilate]] in Judaea, the [[baptism of Jesus]], and John the Baptist's arrest. Chapter Seven describes the alleged debaucheries of the Roman emperor [[Tiberius]] at [[Capri]], described by the Roman historian [[Seutonius]], accepting all of them as historical. Chapter Eight narrates the [[Cleansing of the Temple]] from {{bibleverse|John|2:13-16|9}}, Jesus's meeting with [[Nicodemus]] from {{bibleverse|John|3:1–21|9}}, and the beginning of his ministry. Chapter Nine details the calling of the apostles, the [[Sermon on the Mount]], and the [[anointing of Jesus]] from {{bibleverse||Luke|7:36-50|9}}. Following [[Sacred tradition|Catholic tradition]] rather than the gospels, the authors identify the unnamed "sinful woman" in this passage as [[Mary Magdalene]]. The chapter concludes with the [[Beheading of St John the Baptist|beheading of John the Baptist]]. Chapter Ten entails Jesus's conflicts with the [[Pharisees]] and [[Sadducees]] and concludes with a characterization of [[Judas Iscariot]].

Chapter Eleven describes Pontius Pilate's governance of Judaea and Chapter Twelve [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem|Jesus's entry to Jerusalem]]. In Chapter Thirteen, Jesus cleanses the Temple again and [[Cursing the fig tree|curses the fig tree]]. In Chapter Fourteen, he [[Jesus at the home of Martha and Mary|goes to the house of Mary and Martha]], proclaims the [[Golden Rule]], tells the Pharisees to "[[Render unto Caesar]]", weeps over Jerusalem, and predicts his own death. Chapter Fifteen has the betrayal of Judas and Chapter Sixteen has the [[Last Supper]], the [[Agony in the Garden]], and the [[arrest of Jesus]]. Chapters Seventeen through Nineteen describe Jesus's [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|trial]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], and [[Burial of Jesus|burial]]. Chapter Twenty-One has the account of the [[women at the tomb]]. The "Afterward" describes [[Sources for the historicity of Jesus#Non-Christian sources|non-Christian mentions of Jesus]], the [[Apostles#Deaths|fates of the Apostles according to Catholic tradition]], as well as what happened to Tiberius, [[Caligula]], [[Caiaphas]], [[Herod Antipas]], Jerusalem, and the [[History of early Christianity|early Christian movement]].

==Publication and sales==
Upon its publication, ''Killing Jesus'' debuted at #1 on ''[[The New York Times]]'' bestseller list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2013-10-13/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html|title=Hardcover : Non-Fiction Best Sellers List|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was on the list for 52 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/|title=Best Sellers List|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Killing Jesus'' surpassed the sales of the book ''[[Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth]]'' by [[Reza Aslan]], a professor of creative writing, which had been published only a few months before.&lt;ref name="Ehrmanlecture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehrman2016"/&gt; Of its sales success, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote, "The most popular titles in the Washington area have a distinctly biblical glow: for the second week in a row, ''Killing Jesus'' by Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard is No. 1. This is the third in their spectacularly successful assassination series, following ''Killing Kennedy'' and ''Killing Lincoln''."&lt;ref name="Charles2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Charles |first=Ron |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2013/10/13/an-answer-to-publishers-prayers/ |title=An answer to publishers’ prayers |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=13 October 2013|accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting the concurrent popularity of other religion-related books, the article concludes, "Publishers have long known that religion sells. Even in Washington."&lt;ref name="Charles2013"/&gt;

In its fall books preview, ''[[USA Today]]'' called it "a suspenseful thriller."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/interactive/2764697/ |title=Fall preview: This season's 30 coolest books |website=USA Today |accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of the book by Erik Wemble in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' remarked that ''Killing Jesus'' and its predecessors "may not advance the scholarship on their respective topics, but who'll take issue with millions of Americans getting a quick-read tutorial on history via O’Reilly?"&lt;ref name="Wemble2013"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wemble |first1=Erik |title=Bill O’Reilly and ‘Killing Jesus’: So it is! |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2013/11/11/bill-oreilly-and-killing-jesus-so-it-is/?noredirect=on |accessdate=9 June 2018 |work=The Washington Post |publisher=Nash Holdings, LLC |date=11 November 2013 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Wemble complained that the book's writing was full of annoying verbal [[tic]]s.&lt;ref name="Wemble2013"/&gt; In particular, Wemble criticizes O'Reilly's constant countdown of how much time the person he is writing about has left to live&lt;ref name="Wemble2013"/&gt; and his use of the phrase "so it is..." at the beginnings of sentences.&lt;ref name="Wemble2013"/&gt; Wemble calls the phrase a "a four-word clump of throat-clearing mumbo-jumbo"&lt;ref name="Wemble2013"/&gt; and states that another reviewer counted roughly sixteen or so occurrences of it in ''Killing Jesus''.&lt;ref name="Wemble2013"/&gt; Wemble speculates that O'Reilly may have intended this phrase as "a retroactive cliché, a little riff that would sound impressive in a book about antiquity."&lt;ref name="Wemble2013"/&gt;

In the book, O'Reilly and Dugard state that they are only including events that can be proven as historical fact,&lt;ref name="Wilensky-Lanford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Delzell2013"/&gt; a claim which has drawn criticism from both critics of Christianity and evangelical Christians.&lt;ref name="Wilensky-Lanford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Delzell2013"/&gt; A 2013 review by Dan Delzell for ''[[The Christian Post]]'' criticizes this statement for implying that not everything in the gospels can be proven as historical fact.&lt;ref name="Delzell2013"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Delzell |first1=Dan |date=1 October 2013|title=Bill O'Reilly's 'Killing Jesus' Spiritualizes the Historical Christ |url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/bill-oreillys-killing-jesus-spiritualizes-the-historical-christ-105658/ |website=The Christian Post |publisher=Christian Media Corp. |accessdate=9 June 2018 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the reviewer insists that everything in the gospel accounts is demonstrably factual and that O'Reilly's selective omission of stories found in the gospels from his book is tantamount to "cut[ting] Christ in half."&lt;ref name="Delzell2013"/&gt; A review by Tim Chaffey from [[Answers in Genesis]] criticizes the book for deliberately omitting several of [[Miracles of Jesus|Jesus's miracles]] and glossing over others.&lt;ref name="Chaffey"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chaffey |first1=Tim |date=20 November 2013|title=''Killing Jesus: A History'' by Bill O’Reilly and Martin Dugard |url=https://answersingenesis.org/reviews/books/killing-jesus-a-history-by-bill-oreilly-and-martin-dugard/ |website=''answersingenesis.com'' |publisher=Answers in Genesis |accessdate=9 June 2018 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same review criticized the book for its "graphic description of sexual activity"&lt;ref name="Chaffey"/&gt; and for portraying [[Mary Magdalene]] as a repentant prostitute, an idea that is not based on the Bible.&lt;ref name="Chaffey"/&gt;

In an article for ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', [[Robert M. Price]], an atheist theologian and self-identified fan of Bill O'Reilly, labels ''Killing Jesus'' a work of complete fiction comparable to ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'',&lt;ref name="Price"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Price |first1=Robert M. |date=4 September 2014|title=Bill O’Reilly's "Killing Jesus" is fiction: Fact-checking the Fox News' anchor's "history" of Jesus's death: A conservative theology professor unearths mistruth after mistruth in "Killing Jesus" and calls a pinhead a pinhead|url=https://www.salon.com/2014/09/04/bill_oreillys_killing_jesus_is_fiction_fact_checking_the_fox_news_anchors_history_of_jesuss_death/ |website=Salon  |accessdate=9 June 2018 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and states, "There is no sign whatsoever that the authors of "Killing Jesus" have even begun to do their homework here. In the end notes, true, we find a number of book recommendations, but it is revealing that virtually every one of the New Testament and Jesus books mentioned are the work of evangelical/fundametalist spin doctors dedicated to defending the proposition that the gospels are entirely accurate, miracles and all."&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt; A 2015 review of both the book and the television miniseries based on it by Brook Wilensky-Lanford in ''The Guardian'' criticizes O'Reilly for accepting Jesus's alleged miracles as potentially historical&lt;ref name="Wilensky-Lanford"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wilensky-Lanford |first1=Brook |title=Killing Jesus: Bill O'Reilly's film is touted as history.

[[File:DoréMaryMagdaleneRepentant.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Illustration of [[Mary Magdalene]] as a repentant prostitute by the nineteenth-century French engraver [[Gustave Doré]], which appears on page 146 of ''Killing Jesus''. [[Candida Moss]] criticizes the book for accepting this portrayal of Mary Magdalene, which is not supported by the Bible or other early Christian writings.&lt;ref name="Moss"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Moss |first1=Candida |title=The Gospel According to Bill O’Reilly Jesus was killed because of taxes—that’s more or less the message of Bill O’s new book.

[[Candida Moss]], a professor of New Testament and early Christianity at the [[University of Notre Dame]], criticizes the book for its many historical inaccuracies in two articles written in September and October 2013 for ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' and [[CNN]] respectively.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moss2013"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Moss |first1=Candida |title=Five things Bill O'Reilly flubs in ''Killing Jesus'' |url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/10/04/five-things-bill-oreilly-gets-wrong-in-killing-jesus/ |accessdate=8 June 2018 |work=CNN Belief Blog |publisher=Cable News Network |date=4 October 2013 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moss states that, although O'Reilly and Dugard do attempt to separate between fact and fiction, they do so inconsistently and accordingly to their previously held beliefs.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; In her ''Daily Beast'' article, she states: "...without a method, ''Killing Jesus'' has all the critical rigor of your local church's [[Nativity play]]."&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; She notes that O'Reilly and Dugard accept late, unsubstantiated legends about the fates of the apostles after the period covered by the New Testament as historical fact.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; They also uncritically accept the legend formalized in the fifth century by [[Pope Gregory I]] about Mary Magdalene having previously been a prostitute, which is not supported by the New Testament or any early Christian writings,&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; but ignore the statement actually recorded in the gospels that Mary Magdalene was one of the people funding Jesus's ministry.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; They include statements from John the Baptist accusing tax collectors of overcharging people,&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; but omit all reference to Jesus's repeated injunctions to "support the poor, orphans, and widows"&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; as well as to the saying, "whoever has two coats must share with anyone who has none; and whoever has food must do likewise" ({{bibleverse|Luke|3:11|9}}).&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;

[[File:Rubens tribute money.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''[[The Tribute Money (Rubens)|The Tribute Money]]'' (1612–1614) by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]. One of many recurring criticisms of the book is its portrayal of the [[Pharisees]] as what [[Candida Moss]] calls "self-righteous bloviators", a view which is no longer supported by mainstream scholars.&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Watts2013"/&gt;]]

In her CNN article, Moss cites the example of how they omit the line "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do", which {{bibleverse||Luke|23:34|9}} attributes to Jesus [[Sayings of Jesus on the cross|as he was being crucified]], because, as O'Reilly later said in a [[CBS]] interview, it is impossible to speak audibly while a person is being crucified.&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; She then points out that they chose ''not'' to omit the line "It is finished", also attributed to Jesus while he was on the cross, in {{bibleverse||John|19:30|9}}.&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; Moss suggests that perhaps "there [is just] something about the word 'forgiveness' that sticks in [their throats]".&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; She also criticizes them for taking everything written by Roman historians like [[Suetonius]] and [[Josephus]] completely at face value, as though these writers were totally unbiased.&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; She also particularly criticizes O'Reilly and Dugard's portrayal of the Pharisees as "self-righteous bloviators",&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; stating that modern Biblical scholars no longer view them this way,&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; and that this portrayal is, ironically, based more on the stereotype of Roman Catholics promoted by [[Protestants]] during the [[Reformation]] and [[Early Modern Period]] than on actual ancient texts.&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt;

Moss states that ''Killing Jesus'''s description of the apostle [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] converting to "Christianity" is [[Anachronism|anachronistic]]&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; because, at the time, Christianity was still a Jewish sect and the word "Christian" was not even coined until near the end of the first century.&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; Instead, she says "the first generation of Jesus' followers lived and died as Jews."&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; Moss also notes O'Reilly and Dugard's unusual interpretations of various passages,&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; such as {{bibleverse||Luke|3:17|9}}, which O'Reilly and Dugard apparently interpret to mean that [[John the Baptist]] told the Pharisees that they will either "burn ''or'' be condemned to Hell."&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; She concludes: "Apart from the methodological problems, the entire book is written in the style of a novel, not a history book. We hear the thoughts of Herod as he orders the execution of the male children of Bethlehem, for instance. It's entertaining, but it's historical fan fiction, not history."&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt;

In an article from November 2013, Joel L. Watts, author of ''Mimetic Criticism and the Gospel of Mark'', calls ''Killing Jesus'' nothing more than "an attempt at agenda-driven drivel produced for the lowest common denominator."&lt;ref name="Watts2013"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Watts |first1=Joel L. |date=25 November 2013|title=Review of Killing Jesus: A History |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/joel-l-watts/review-of-killing-jesus_b_3984134.html |work=HuffPost |accessdate=9 June 2018 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He adds, "I wish I had my day back."&lt;ref name="Watts2013"/&gt; In addition to raising many of the same accuracy concerns as Moss, Watts also criticizes the book for imputing post-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas of [[individualism]] to ancient Galileean Jews&lt;ref name="Watts2013"/&gt; and for referring to the [[Sadducees]] (who believed that the [[Torah]] was the only authoritative scripture and opposed the more progressive theology promoted by the Pharisees) as "liberals".&lt;ref name="Watts2013"/&gt; He also criticizes a statement that the canon of the [[Hebrew Bible]] had been established "500 years" before Jesus, when, in reality, many of the books in the Hebrew Bible were not written until after that point&lt;ref name="Watts2013"/&gt; and the canon of the Hebrew Bible was still debated long after Jesus's death.&lt;ref name="Watts2013"/&gt; Watts accuses the authors of being arrogant and dismissive of the opinions of actual experts.&lt;ref name="Watts2013"/&gt; He determines that "they destroy context and literary construction to, and I can only assume this based on the evidence of reading the book, hide the actual message of the Gospels."&lt;ref name="Watts2013"/&gt;

[[File:Tea Party - Pennsylvania Avenue.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Numerous scholars have criticized ''Killing Jesus'' for its anachronistic portrayal of Jesus as an advocate of "smaller government and lower taxes" similar to the supporters of the United States [[Tea Party movement]] (''protest pictured''), rather than the first-century Galilean Jew he really was.&lt;ref name="Ehrmanlecture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehrman2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Watts2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;]]

A December 2013 review in ''[[The Guardian]]'' by Selina O'Grady, author of ''And Man Created God: Kings, Cults, and Conquests at the Time of Jesus'', remarks that, "Everyone creates God in their own image, so it's not surprising that [[Fox News|Fox television]]'s aggressively conservative down-home-let's-hear-it-for-the-ordinary-guy talk show host should have created a [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] son of God. Jesus, the little guy, is an enemy of the big corrupt tax-oppressing [[Roman empire]], which is itself just a version of [[Washington, D. C.|Washington]], only even more venal and sexually depraved. This Jesus is a tax-liberating rebel who incurs the wrath of the Jewish and Roman powers by threatening their joint fleecing of the people. As a member of the populist right, he is not, of course, in favour of redistribution: Bill O'Reilly's Jesus does not tell the rich to give away their money to the poor."&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Grady|first=Selina|title=Killing Jesus: A History by Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard – review: The right-wing talk show host gives us salacious gossip, gory details and a Tea Party Son of God|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/18/killing-jesus-bill-oreilly-review|accessdate=17 April 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same review criticizes ''Killing Jesus'' for its "bodice-ripping treatment of history",&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; stating that the book oversimplifies, sensationalizes, and misrepresents the historical events it purports to describe.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; According to O'Grady, ''Killing Jesus'' presents the Romans, Jewish elites, and Pharisees as categorically "bad" and "ordinary Jews" as "good", without any background or nuance.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; O'Grady also criticizes O'Reilly and Dugard for relying almost entirely on the gospels&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; and ignoring the centuries' worth of books written by Biblical scholars about the historical Jesus.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

During a Q&amp;A session following a 2014 lecture at [[Dickinson College]] on "Jesus and the Historian", [[Bart D. Ehrman]], James A. Gray Distinguished Professor of [[religious studies]] at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], laughed at his own mention of ''Killing Jesus'', commenting "Bill O'Reilly! ''There's'' a source you trust about the historical Jesus. Hah! Aye yai yai."&lt;ref name="Ehrmanlecture"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ehrman |first1=Bart D. |author-link=Bart D.

Ehrman |accessdate=8 June 2018 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2016 book ''Jesus Before the Gospels'', Ehrman was less overtly hostile, merely commenting that O'Reilly is "obviously... not a New Testament scholar."&lt;ref name="Ehrman2016"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ehrman |first1=Bart D. |title=Jesus Before the Gospels: How the Earliest Christians Remembered, Changed, and Invented their Stories of the Savior |date=2016 |publisher=HarperOne |location=New York City, New York |isbn=978-0-06-228520-1 |page=22 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both the lecture and the book, Ehrman implicitly criticizes O'Reilly's portrayal of the historical Jesus as an advocate of "smaller government and lower taxes."&lt;ref name="Ehrmanlecture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehrman2016"/&gt; In the book, though, he adds, "It is easy to see how this view of Jesus might resonate with a wide swath of our population today."&lt;ref name="Ehrman2016"/&gt;

[[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]] picked up the television adaptation of ''Killing Jesus'', just as it had for ''[[Killing Lincoln]]'' and ''[[Killing Kennedy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nat Geo Adapting Bill O’Reilly’s 'Killing Jesus'|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/nat-geo-adapting-bill-o-430662|first=Michael|last=O'Connell|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=March 25, 2014|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, it was announced ''Killing Jesus'' was being adapted into a four-hour miniseries, and [[Walon Green]] has been tapped to write and executive produce the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2014/03/national-geographics-killing-jesus-to-expand-to-4-hours-walon-green-to-write-701056/|title=National Geographic’s ‘Killing Jesus’ To Expand To 4 Hours, Walon Green To Write| first=Nellie| last=Andreeva| website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=March 17, 2014|accessdate=December 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also returning as executive producers are [[Ridley Scott]], [[David W.

In August 2014, [[Christopher Menaul]] was attached to direct the miniseries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2014/08/christopher-menaul-to-direct-killing-jesus-mini-for-nat-geo-ridley-scott-815800/|title=Christopher Menaul To Direct 'Killing Jesus' For Nat Geo &amp; Ridley Scott|author=The Deadline Team|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=August 7, 2014|accessdate=December 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On its premiere airing, the film was watched by 3.7 million viewers, averaging a 1.0 rating among adults in the 25-54 demographic. The viewership surpassed the record previously held by ''[[Killing Kennedy (film)|Killing Kennedy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/killing-jesus-nabs-nat-geo-785319 | title='Killing Jesus' Nabs Nat Geo Ratings Record With 3.7 Million Viewers | last=O'Connell | first=Michael | work=The Hollywood Reporter | date=March 30, 2015 | accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maglio2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thewrap.com/killing-jesus-national-geogaphic-channel-tv-ratings-killing-kennedy/ | title='Killing Jesus' Slays Nat Geo Record With 3.7 Million Viewers | last=Maglio | first=Tony | publisher=[[TheWrap]] | date=March 30, 2015 | accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review on ''[[Yahoo TV]]'' by Ken Tucker said of the film, "Rendered without much embellishment and acted with firmly controlled vigor, ''[[Killing Jesus (film)|Killing Jesus]]'', a TV adaptation of the bestselling book by Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard, is a fine retelling of the story of Jesus Christ as a historical figure.

A review by Neil Genzlinger in ''[[The New York Times]]'', however, panned the film,&lt;ref name="Genzlinger"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Genzlinger |first1=Neil |title=Review: 'Killing Jesus,' Biblical Tale Retold, Softer on Its Politics |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/27/arts/television/review-killing-jesus-biblical-tale-retold-softer-on-its-politics.html |accessdate=9 June 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=26 March 2015 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; declaring, "It's a costume pageant devoid both of the reverence that has made some previous film versions work and of the intrigue that might provide a secular ''[[Game of Thrones]]''-like appeal. More effort went into the jewelry and headwear than into the storytelling."&lt;ref name="Genzlinger"/&gt; The same review compared the miniseries unfavorably with the book, stating, "The book tried to put Jesus' story in the broader context of the politics and practices of the day, but here the account is largely pared down to the biblical rendition, with Jesus casting out a demon, preventing the stoning of a woman accused of adultery and delivering the touchstone teachings that all Christians know by heart."&lt;ref name="Genzlinger"/&gt;

'''''Knocking Our Own Ting''''' is a pamphlet-length [[satire]] written by [[Evan X Hyde]] discussing the [[Battle of St. George's Caye]], a naval battle off the coast of [[Belize]] occurring in 1798.&lt;ref name="XCommunication"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hyde|first=Evan X|date=1995|title=X Communication: Selected Writings|location=Belize City|publisher=Angelus Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nunez"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nunez|first1=Abdulmajeed|title=History of the Muslims in Belize|date=2010|publisher=AuthorHouse|location=Bloomington, Indiana|isbn=1452018529|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; This battle has been celebrated since 1898 on September 10 as St. George's Caye Day. In the 1950s, Belizeans were beginning to question their identity and beliefs as a people, and one of the first things questioned was the "myth" of St. George's Caye. Did white master and black slave fight as equals? Or were blacks subordinates?

== Arguments ==
Hyde, already exposed to [[Black Power]] theory, argues that the Battle of St. George's Caye tends to divide Belizeans more than unify them. The combatants in the battle- white slavemasters and black slaves- are ancestors and forefathers of the various shades of [[Belizean Kriol people|Belizean Creole people]] and their Spanish (Mexican) opponents are forefathers of the [[Mestizo]]s. The glorifying of the slaves' efforts only further alienates Mestizo people from the development of Belize.

For Hyde, the 10th really celebrates the successful division of the Belizean people. He also questions how, after disciplining the runaway slaves from the slave revolt of 1773 harshly, the British decided to use them in fighting the hated Spanish, who had already succeeded in removing the Baymen from the settlement previously. Hyde also questions the relevancy of a holiday for Creole in a multi-racial, multi-ethnic society. He concludes that the Battle is better off celebrated for the achievements of the blacks, rather than any national pride attached to it, as long as Belize remained a colony of Great Britain (Belize became independent in 1981).

== Publishing ==
Benex Press issued the first edition of ''Knocking'' in 1969. It then went out of print until the publication of ''X-Communication'' by Angelus Press in 1995.

[[File:Prud-hon_Mme-georges-anthony-HD.jpg|thumb|300px]]
'''''Madame Georges Anthony and Her Two Sons''''' is a 1796 oil on canvas group portrait by [[Pierre-Paul Prud'hon]], now in the [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]], which acquired it in 1892. 

Two years earlier he had fled Paris to escape the [[Thermidorian Reaction]] following Robespierre's fall. He took refuge in a family home at [[Rigny]] near [[Gray, Haute-Saône|Gray]] occupied by the postmaster Georges Anthony, his wife Louise (née Demandre) and their children. As a thank-you for their hospitality, Prud'hon painted this work and a portrait of Georges beside a horse ([[musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon]]), both completed in 1796, the year he left their home. During the restoration of the musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon in 2016 the paintings were briefly reunited in Lyon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2515">The '''Mahat chapel of Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II''' is an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian funerary chapel (Egyptian: ''mahat'') built by king [[Mentuhotep II]] (reigned c. 2046 BC – 1995 BC) at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]]. The remains of the well preserved chapel were found in 2014.&lt;ref name="luxormag"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://luxortimesmagazine.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/exclusive-full-story-mahat-chapel-of.html|title=Exclusive Full story: Mahat chapel of Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II discovered in Abydos by Egyptian archaeologists|website=luxortimesmagazine.blogspot.co.uk|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chapel was discovered on the 23rd April 2014, after noting a ground [[subsidence]] in front of a house in Abydos, because of illegal excavations. The Tourism and Antiquities Police was able to find the illegal diggers and the [[Ministry of State of Antiquities|Ministry of Antiquities]] was sending several archeologists for investigating the remains.&lt;ref name=luxormag/&gt;

The remains of the chapel are very close to the enclosure of the temple of Temple of [[Seti I]]. About 20 meter north of the funerary chapel there are the remains of a similar one, belonging to the [[New Kingdom]] king [[Ramesses I]]. The excavations have so far unearthed a chamber 2.6 wide and about 4.2 m below modern floor lever. The walls are built of fine limestone and decorated with reliefs.

The '''Monster of Ravenna''' was an apocryphal late [[Renaissance]]-era [[monstrous birth]] whose appearance in early 1512 near the city of [[Ravenna]] was widely reported in contemporary European pamphlets and diaries. Images of its grotesque features were symbolically interpreted by opponents of both the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]], although a more common explanation at the time held that the beast was an [[omen]] regarding the outcome of the [[Battle of Ravenna (1512)|Battle of Ravenna]]. Modern medical consensus identifies the monster as a child with some variety of severe [[congenital disorder]].

== History ==
The earliest account of the monster's existence comes from the diarist Sebastiano di Branca Tedallini, who recorded on March 8 that news of a strange infant's birth had reached [[Pope Julius II]] in Rome. According to his account, the child was said to have been born of a nun and a friar, and was marked by a horned head, the letters YXV on its chest, and with one leg hairy and cloven-hoofed while the other leg's midsection grew a human eye.{{sfn|Niccoli|1990|p=35}} On March 11, the apothecary [[Luca Landucci]] documented how word of this incident had reached Florence; having apparently received a drawing of the monster, Landucci described it to possess features such as a single horn, the wings of a bat, hermaphroditic genitalia, an eye on its right knee and a clawed left foot like an eagle's.{{sfn|Niccoli|1990|p=36}}{{sfn|Daston|Park|1998|p=177}}{{sfn|Leroi|2003|loc=intro}} The tale was subsequently immortalized by further chroniclers of the era, including Johannes Multivallis, Jacques Rueff, [[Conrad Lycosthenes]], [[Caspar Hedio]], [[Pierre Boaistuau]], [[Fortunio Liceti]], and [[Ambroise Paré]].{{sfn|Huet|2004|p=131}} Landucci's physical description appears to have been considered authoritative, as later chroniclers, particularly Boaistuau, largely reproduced his account word-for-word.{{sfn|Hampton|2004|pp=179-180}}{{efn|Boaistuau's account includes the description of the eye on the knee and the clawed foot, but he has combined the two into a single leg. The text is otherwise nearly identical to Landucci.}}

It was common practice for malformed infants, especially those with a low chance of survival in medieval Europe, to be abandoned and left to die by starvation;{{sfn|Niccoli|1990|p=33}} this was swiftly carried out in Ravenna on the order of the Pope.{{sfn|Leroi|2003|loc=intro}}

Even after its reported death, however, news of the monstrous birth continued to sweep Europe, often in stories greatly embellished by the storyteller. In a popular poem given by Marcello Palonio relatively soon after its birth, the monster is oddly implied to possess two heads.{{sfn|Niccoli|1990|pp=40-41}}{{sfn|Ashton|1890|pp=173-174}} With more time, the appearance of the Ravenna monster rapidly evolved, changing its number of legs from two to one and eventually syncretizing with the morality figure of [[:de:Frau Welt|Frau Welt]].{{sfn|Leroi|2003|loc=intro}}{{sfn|Niccoli|1990|pp=37-44}} [[Giovanni Battista Bissoni]] was contracted to design the illustrations to the second edition of Fortunio Liceti's account, with the Monster of Ravenna centrally displayed on the frontispiece; by this point, the creature was well-established as possessing a single clawed foot.{{sfn|Cheng|2012|p=212}}

A major element in the popularity of the "monster" was its appearance alongside similar signs and portents; the occurrence of other [[preternatural]] events was a key factor in convincing Landucci  that this was not an isolated incident.{{sfn|Daston|Park|1998|p=178}} In 1514, with the example of Ravenna still fresh in public memory, a so-called "Monster of [[Bologna]]" was reported. This child was born with two faces, three eyes, and a woman's vulva on its forehead. It lived long enough to be baptized as "Maria" but died four days later.{{sfn|Bowd|1999|p=41}}{{sfn|Niccoli|1990|pp=52-53}}

== Interpretation == 
{{Quote|text=The horn [indicates] pride; the wings, mental frivolity and inconstancy; the lack of arms, a lack of good works; the raptor's foot, rapaciousness, usury, and every sort of avarice; the eye on the knee, a mental orientation solely toward earthly things; the double sex, sodomy. And on account of these vices, Italy is shattered by the sufferings of war, which the [[Louis XII of France|King of France]] has not accomplished by his own power, but only as the scourge of God. |author=Johannes Multivallis |source=Eusebii Caesariensis episcopi chronicon, 1512{{sfn|Daston|Park|1998|pp=181-182}} }}

Contemporary accounts sought to explain the "monster" and its unusual features in religious terms. The version proposed by Multivallis was fairly typical of the age; the recent [[Battle of Ravenna (1512)|Battle of Ravenna]] was a common theme in most texts produced very soon after the initial incident, being mentioned in both Landucci's report{{sfn|Daston|Park|1998|p=177}} and that of Ambroise Paré, who tersely listed the Monster of Ravenna as an "Example of the Wrath of God" upon Pope Julius II and the people of Italy.{{sfn|Paré|1982|p=6}} Others focused on the specific vice of sexual immorality, as [[Pietro Martire d'Anghiera]] recorded the belief that the monster was born the illegitimate child of a married mother.{{sfn|Niccoli|1990|p=47}}

During the Protestant Reformation, monstrous births and similar incidents were cited with political aim, most notably in the example of [[Monstrous birth#Luther's mooncalf|Luther's mooncalf]]. In the fifth volume of the anti-Lutheran ''Centvrien'' by Johann Nas, [[Martin Luther]] is himself identified with the Monster of Ravenna.{{sfn|Spinks|2009|p=343}} On the Protestant side, early woodcuts were produced which depicted the child as having been born in a Florentine convent, the offspring of a nun and the Pope himself. This was followed by the more established narrative that the birth presaged the invasion of Louis XII as an agent of God's displeasure with Catholic power.{{sfn|Schutte|1985|p=92}}

The Monster of Ravenna is referenced briefly in [[Mateo Alemán]]'s novel ''[[Guzmán de Alfarache]]'', which was published at the turn of the seventeenth century. Following protracted criticism of his own father for being sexually and religiously immoral, Guzmán invokes the grotesque imagery of the Monster as a being which transcends the societal norms of sex.{{sfn|Cruz|2010|pp=11-12}}

== Speculation on origins ==
Analyzing the later account of Ambroise Paré, Walton et al. proposed a tentative diagnosis of [[sirenomelia]] with related factors;{{efn|This is based on Paré's assertion that the child had only one leg, per the later accounts of the Monster's appearance.}} additionally, they highlight possible indicators of [[hydrocephalus]] causing a bulging [[anterior fontanelle]], radial [[hypoplasia]] with [[pterygium]] to give the impression of wings, and [[caudal regression]], the latter of which may have been caused by [[diabetes mellitus]] in the mother.{{sfn|Walton|Fineman|Walton|1993|p=12}} The "horned" forehead can alternatively be viewed as an instance of [[cyclopia]].{{sfn|Martínez‐Frías|1994|p=362}} Finally, it is plausible that some of the more striking features were caused by [[Roberts syndrome]], which could have affected the development of the limbs and genitals.{{sfn|Leroi|2003|loc=intro}}

The '''Newark Earthworks''' in [[Newark, Ohio|Newark]] and [[Heath, Ohio]], consist of three sections of preserved [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]]: the Great Circle Earthworks, the Octagon Earthworks, and the Wright Earthworks. This complex, built by the [[Hopewell culture]] between 100 CE and 500 CE, contains the largest earthen [[enclosure (archaeology)|enclosure]]s in the world, being about 3,000 acres in extent. Today, the preserved site covers {{convert|206|acres}}, and is operated as a state park by the [[Ohio Historical Society|Ohio History Connection]].  A designated [[National Historic Landmark]], in 2006, the Newark Earthworks was also designated as the "official prehistoric monument of the State of Ohio."&lt;ref name="Ohio"/&gt;

This is part of the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks, one of 14 sites nominated in January 2008 by the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]] for potential submission by the [[United States|US]] to the [[UNESCO World Heritage List]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.octagonmoonrise.org/World%20Heritage%20Designation.html |title=Newark Earthworks Day |publisher=Octagonmoonrise.org |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Built by the pre-European contact [[Hopewell culture]] between 100 CE and 500 CE,&lt;ref&gt; Woodward, Susan L. and Jerry N. McDonald, Indian Mounds of the Ohio Valley: A Guide to Adena and Hopewell Sites,  The McDonald &amp; Woodward Publishing Company, Blacksburg, Virginia,  1986  p.16-23&lt;/ref&gt; the earthworks were used as places of ceremony, social gathering, trade, worship, and honoring the dead.&lt;ref name=nrhp/&gt;&lt;ref name=OhioHistory&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ohiohistory.org/visit/museum-and-site-locator/newark-earthworks|title=History|website=Ohio History Connection|date=2016|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the primary purpose of the Octagon earthwork itself was believed to have been scientific. The Newark Earthwork site is the largest surviving Hopewell earthwork complex in North America. The culture built many [[Mound builder (people)|earthen mounds]].  Over decades, they built the single largest [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] enclosure complex in the [[Ohio River Valley]].  The earthworks cover several square miles.&lt;ref name=OhioHistory/&gt; Scholars have demonstrated that the Octagon Earthworks comprise a lunar [[observatory]] for tracking the moon's orbit during its 18.6-year cycle.&lt;ref name="Maag"/&gt;

== Great Circle Earthworks ==
[[File:A Mound in the Great Circle Earthworks, Heath.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A mound in the Great Circle Earthworks]]
[[File:End of a ditch at the Great Circle in Newark.jpg|right|thumb|One end of the Great Circle Earthworks, part of the Newark Earthworks.]]
The {{convert|1054|ft|m|sing=on}} wide Newark Great Circle is one of the largest circular earthwork in the [[Americas]], at least in construction effort. A {{convert|5|ft|m|sing=on}} deep moat is encompassed by walls that are {{convert|8|ft|m}} high; at the entrance, the dimensions are even more grand.&lt;ref name=OhioHistory/&gt; 

Researchers have used [[Geodesy|archaeogeodesy]] and [[archaeoastronomy]] to analyze the placements, alignments, dimensions, and site-to-site interrelationships of the earthworks.  This research has revealed that the [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] [[culture]]s in the area had advanced scientific understanding as the basis of their complex construction.

Today, the Great Circle Earthworks are preserved in a public park in [[Heath, Ohio|Heath]].

==Octagon Earthworks==
Fifty acres total, the Octagon Earthworks consists of an Observatory Mound, Observatory Circle, and the interconnected Octagon span nearly {{convert|3000|ft|m}} in length. It has eight {{convert|550|ft|m|sing=on}}-long walls, from {{convert|5|ft|m}} to {{convert|6|ft|m}} high. The Octagon Earthworks are joined by parallel walls to a circular embankment enclosing {{convert|20|acres}}.&lt;ref name=OhioHistory/&gt;

In 1982 researchers from [[Earlham College]] in [[Richmond, Indiana]] concluded that the complex was a lunar observatory, designed to track motions of the moon, including the northernmost point of the 18.6-year cycle of the lunar orbit. When viewed from the observatory mound the moon rises at that time within one-half of a degree of the octagon's exact center. The earthwork is twice as precise as the complex at [[Stonehenge]] (assuming Stonehenge is an observatory, which is a disputed theory).&lt;ref name="Maag"&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Maag |title=Ohio Indian Mounds: Hallowed Ground and a Nice Par 3 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/28/national/28mounds.html |work=New York Times |date=2005-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Newark Works Squier and Davis Plate XXV.jpg|thumb|left|150px|19th-century plan of the Works]]
From 1892 to 1908, the state of [[Ohio]] used the Octagon Earthworks as a [[militia]] [[Military camp|encampment]]. Immediately after this, the Newark Board of Trade owned the property, until 1918. In 1910, they leased the property to Mound Builders Country Club (MBCC), which developed the site as a golf course. As a result of a [[Licking County, Ohio|Licking County]] Common Pleas Court case, a trustee was named to manage the property from 1918 to 1933.&lt;ref name="Maag"/&gt;

In 1997 the [[Ohio Historical Society|Ohio Historical Society (now the Ohio History Connection)]] signed a lease until 2078 with the country club. MBCC maintains, secures, and provides some public access to the land. Some citizens believe the country club is an inappropriate use of the sacred site.&lt;ref name=OhioVisit&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ohiohistory.org/visit/museum-and-site-locator/newark-earthworks|title=Visit|website=Ohio History Connection|date=2016|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been increasing public interest in the earthworks. Activists have pressed for more public access to the site to witness the moonrise, which observance was planned in the design and construction by the original native builders.&lt;ref name="Maag"/&gt;

==Wright Earthworks==
The Wright Earthworks consist of a fragment of a geometrically near-perfect square enclosure and part of one wall that originally formed a set of parallel embankments, which travelled from the enclosure to a large oval yard. The Newark square's sides formerly ranged from about {{convert|940|ft|m}} to {{convert|940|ft|m}} in length, enclosing a total area of about {{convert|20|acres}}.&lt;ref name=OhioHistory/&gt; Farming and construction, associated with building the [[Ohio Canal]] and the streets and houses of the city of Newark, destroyed much of the square enclosure and its associated mounds. The remaining segment of one wall of the square is less than {{convert|200|ft|m}} long.&lt;ref name="Ohio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2753 |title=Wright Earthworks – Ohio History Central – A product of the Ohio Historical Society |publisher=Ohio History Central |date=2006-11-14 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wright Earthworks are named in honor of Mrs. Frances Rees Wright, who donated the site to the Ohio Historical Society in 1934.&lt;ref name="Ohio" /&gt;

The '''history of photography in Japan''' begins in the 19th century and has continued to be a prominent art form into the present era.

==19th-century photography==

===Importation of Photography===
[[File:Shimazu by ichiki.jpg|thumb|240px|Ichiki's [[daguerreotype]] of [[Shimazu Nariakira]], the earliest surviving Japanese photograph]]
In 1848 (Edo era), a camera for daguerréotype was imported by a Dutch ship to Japan (Nagasaki, 長崎).  It is said that this was the first camera in Japan.  During Edo era, the import and the export had been prohibited (''sakoku'', 鎖国) by the Edo Government (''Edobakufu'', 江戸幕府), except that only Dutch ships had been permitted to export and import various goods at Nagasaki Port.  Therefore, the first camera was introduced at Nagasaki.  This camera was imported by Ueno Toshinojō (1790–1851, 上野俊之丞) and in 1849 passed to [[Shimazu Nariakira]] (1809–1858, 島津斉彬), who later would become a feudal lord (''[[daimyō]],'' 大名) of [[Satsuma Domain]] (薩摩藩, now ''Kagoshima-ken'').

In Satsuma Domain, detailed study with respect to photography had been done, but it took almost ten years from the acquisition of the first camera to taking the first photograph.  In 1857, SHIMAZU Nariakira's photograph was taken by [[Ichiki Shirō]] (1828–1903, 市来四郎) and UJUKU Hikoemon (宇宿彦右衛門) (daguerréotype).  This is said to be the first photograph taken by Japanese and still exist and can be seen at ''Shōko Shūseikan'' (尚古集成館, Kagoshima-city, Japan).

[[File:Ueno Hikoma.jpg|thumb|Self-portrait of Ueno Hikoma, c. 1870s]]
In 1854, [[Convention of Kanagawa]] (日米和親条約, ''Nichi-Bei Washin Jōyaku'', "America-Japan Treaty of Amity and Friendship") was concluded between U.S. and Japan, [[Anglo-Japanese Friendship Treaty]] (日英和親条約, ''Nichi-Ei Washin Jōyaku'') was concluded between Britain and Japan, and [[Treaty of Shimoda]] (日露和親条約, ''Nichi-Ro Washin Jōyaku'') was concluded between Russia and Japan.  The treaties opened the Japanese ports of Shimoda (in Shizuoka Prefecture), Hakodate (in Hokkaido Prefecture) and Nagasaki to the trade.  In 1858, [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States – Japan)]] (日米修好通商条約).was concluded between U.S. and Japan and opened the port of Kanagawa, but soon the port of Yokohama (横浜), which is close to Kanagawa, opened for the trade with foreign countries in exchange to the port of Kanagawa.  The trade based on these treties began in 1858 at Yokohama, Nagasaki and Hakodate.  This is called ''Kaikoku'' (開国, to open the nation for foreign countries and trades) in Japanese language.  Thanks to ''Kaikoku'', more and more cameras and other photography-related equipment and materials had been imported to Japan.  Further some foreign photographers, such as [[Felix Beato]] came to Japan and took many photographs of Japan.

In 1862, [[Ueno Hikoma]] (1838–1904, 上野彦馬) opened his photo studio in Nagasaki and [[Shimooka Renjo]] (1823–1914, 下岡蓮杖) opened his photo studio in Noge (野毛, soon later included within Yokohama), in the same year, but independently. The open of these two photo studios for portraits indicated the new era of Japanese photography.

===Professional Photographers in Meiji Era===

After the opening of Ueno Studio and Shimooka Studio, around the turning point between Edo Era and Meiji Era (1868), several new photo studios were opened, such as that of [[Kuichi Uchida]] (1844–1875, 内田九一) in 1865 in Osaka and in 1866 moved to Yokohama, that of Yohei Hori (or HORI Masumi, 1826–1880, 堀与兵衛 (堀真澄)) in 1865 in Kyoto, that of Kōkichi Kizu (1830–1895, 木津幸吉) in 1866 in Hakodate, that of [[Rihei Tomishige]] (1837–1922, 冨重利平) in Yanagawa, Chikugo in 1866 and that of [[Yokoyama Matsusaburō]] (1838–1884, 横山松三郎).

[[File:Meiji Emperor.jpg|thumb|Portrait of the Meiji Emperor (御真影) by Uchida Kuichi, 1873. Albumen silver print]]
Among these photographers (Shishin-shi, 写真師), Uchida Kuichi is most famous for his photographs of Meiji Emperor (明治天皇) in 1872 and 1873, which photographs have been called Goshin'ei (御真影) and were used as public portraits of Meiji Emperor.  "真(shin)" means "true" and "影(ei)" means "(photographic) image" or "portrait" and "御(go)" means honorific prefix for "真影".  In Meiji Era, only very limited persons, such as prime ministers, could meet Meiji Emperor in person and most Japanese people in Meiji Era had no chance to see Meiji Emperor.  But Meiji Emperor's image was necessary for him to govern Japan and Japanese nations.  Therefore, Meiji Government prepared "御真影" and used "御真影" for Emperor's governance and Meiji Government's governance.

As other photographers, Kakoku Shima (1827–1870島霞谷) and [[Ryū Shima]] (1823–1899,  島隆) should be mentioned. They were a husband and a wife and began taking photography together around 1863 or 1864, and Ryū Shima was called the first woman professional photographer.

Further, around the 1860s and 1900, Yokohama-shashin (Yokohama Photo, Photographs selling or distributing in Yokohama, 横浜写真) was very popular.  Yokohama-shashin was a photograph of Japanese scenery, Japanese people (especially Japanese women) and Japanese cultures and a very widely used souvenir especially for foreign people.  Among photographers for Yokohama-shashin, [[Felix Beato]] and [[Kusakabe Kimbei]] (1841–1934, 日下部金兵衛) were very famous.
[[File:Country Children Kusakabe Kimbei.jpg|thumb|Country Children. Hand-coloured albumen silver print, by Kusakabe Kimbei]]

Because of Kaikoku, many foreign people came to Japan.  Further, after Meiji Ishin (Meiji Government was established in 1868), many Japanese were able to travel within Japan without breaking laws and began to travel within Japan.  Yokohama was a suitable place to visit both for foreign people and Japanese people, and Yokohama-shashin attracted such travellers very much.

Two main characteristics of Yokohama-shashin were;
#a well-decorated album-style photographs, and
#hand-colored photographs.

But towards the end of the 19th century, picture post cards, which were much cheaper than Yokohama-shashin, became very popular and were widely used in Japan, and many amateur photographers were emerging, who liked to take pictures by themselves than to buy expensive Yokohama-shashin.  These were the major reasons for Yokohama-shashin to decline.

In the 1880s, photographers in a new generation and new types began their activities.  [[Reiji Esaki]] (1845–1910, 江崎礼二), who took photographs of experimental torpedo explosion in Sumida river in 1883, and [[Kazuma Ogawa]] (1860–1929, 小川一眞), who not only took photographs but also was the managers of a printing factory, were particularly famous among them.

In the 1860s and 1870s, many photographs of Hokkaidō were taken, which photographs are called Hokkaidō Kaitaku Shashin (Photographs of Developments in Hokkaidō, 北海道開拓写真).  In the 1860s and 1870s, Hokkaidō was under the development by the Japanese Government.  The Government in Tokyo needed detailed reports of the development in writing, and they thought reports with photographs should be better and the Government requested some photographers to take photographs of the development in Hokkaidō.  Such photographers included [[Tamoto Kenzō]] (1832–1912, 田本研造), Kōkichi Ida (1846–1911, 井田侾吉), Raimund von Stillfried-Ratenicz (1839–1911), [[Seiichi Takebayashi]] (1842–1908, 武林盛一) and [[Sakuma Hanzō]] (1844–1897, 佐久間範造).

===Emerging Amateur Photographers===
Around the middle of the 1880s, photographers (写真師) began to use gelatin dry plates very widely.  Before the spread of gelatin dry plates, the wet collodion process (湿式コロジオン法) was ordinary process for photography in Japan and to use this process was very difficult in technical points and also it costs a considerable sum of money.  It means almost no amateur photographers can exist without gelatin dry plates.

Two famous examples of earliest amateur photographers in Japan were as follows;
*[[Kamei Koreaki]] (1861–1896, 亀井茲明), who was a count and studied aesthetics in England and Germany, took photographs of the Sino-Japanese War (日清戦争) in 1895.
*[[Kashima Seibei|Kajima Seibei]] (1866–1924, 鹿島清兵衛) took many photographs in the 1890s, such as a life-size portrait of Manzaburō Umewaka (NO (能) actor) and a big-size photograph of Mt. Fuji.

Wide spread of gelatin dry plates and small-sized cameras led to the era of prominent amateur photographers in the 20th century in Japan.

Avant-garde photography including surrealism and pictorialism photography had almost disappeared behind photojournalism after WWII because photography other than photojournalism which supported Japanese government and Japanese military powers was completely oppressed by the Japanese government during WWII. It took several years before avant-garde photography came back to the stage of the history of Japanese photography.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2589">'''Raffig Tullou''' (born Raphaël Tullou), alias '''Neven Lewarc’h''' (6 January 1909 in [[Mordelles]] – 16 January 1990 in [[Saint-Herblain]]) was a [[Brittany|Breton]] [[sculpture|sculptor]] and [[set design]]er. His works included modern [[Celtic art|Celto]]-Breton furnishing art, [[wood carving]]s, [[stone carving]]s, and restoration of historical buildings.

==Life==
Tullou came to prominence as a member of the Breton artistic movement [[Seiz Breur]], and attempted to adapt his style to merge classical and Breton regional traditions. 

Like other members of the group, he was also involved in Breton nationalist politics. Following the split in the [[Breton Autonomist Party]], in 1934, Tullou, Gestalen, Francis Bayer du Kern, Goulven Mazéas and [[Morvan Marchal]] created the Breton Federalist Movement, which sought Breton federal autonomy within France. This was set up because of the creation of the extremist [[Breton National Party]], which had pro-Nazi sympathies. Nevertheless, during [[World War II]], he reported for [[L'Heure Bretonne]], the newspaper of the BNP.

In 1944, he became the last [[Secretary General]] of [[Seiz Breur]], following the resignation of [[René-Yves Creston]]. 

===Neo-druidism===
In the 1930s Tullou turned his attention towards [[Druidism|druidic]] studies. In 1936, he, Morvan Marchal, and Francis Bayer du Kern founded [[Kredenn Geltiek Hollvedel]] (Worldwide Celtic Beliefs), also known as ''Kevanvod Tud Donn'' and ''Dêua Ana''. In addition, he also founded a journal about druidic studies and philosophy called [[Kad (journal)|Kad]] (combat). During [[World War II]], the journal changed its name to become ''Nemeton'' (sanctuary). Today, it is known as ''Ialon-Kad-Nemeton''.

===Post-War===
In 1954, he founded Koun Breizh (Remember Bretons), to promote Breton artistic heritage and Breton administrative organizations. Through the movement he sought to commemorate Breton national heroes, and was responsible for the statue of [[Nominoë]], the first independent [[Duke of Brittany]], at [[Bains-sur-Oust]]. He also designed the commemorative plaque for the 18th century  Breton rebel [[Marquis de Pontcallec]] in the Place du Bouffay, in [[Nantes]].

In 1966, he created Skoed (The Shield) to be the official newspaper of Koun Breizh.

'''S.M.S''' (Shit Must Stop) is a collection of artist's portfolios that are conceived by [[William Copley (artist)|William Copley]] and [[Dimitri Petrov]] as they speak about the long relationships with the artists. The collection has been published biweekly from February to December 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S.M.S Homepage|url=http://sms.sensatejournal.com/|website=S.M.S|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each issue is composed of diverse art pieces, created by individual artist that were important at that period. The portfolios has a wide range of different aspects such as [[dada]], [[surrealism]], and [[pop art]] that includes photography, sound, drawings and writings.

This project has been inspired by the [[Fluxus|Fluxus movement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boivent|first1=Marie|title=La revue d’artiste – Enjeux et spécificités d’une pratique artistique|date=2015|edition=Incertain Sens|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which encouraged diverse artists to come together as a form of a protest against galleries, not agreeing to them having the authority to determine the value of art. So by bringing artist together without any establishments, which by means, without being judged and determined, played equally in their specific art areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SMS|url=http://www.colophon.com/SMS|website=Colophon|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each portfolio within the issue, is a dossier about the subject of personal impressions, and the way to establish their relationship between artist’s impulse and impersonal meanings of practical reproduction. After merging them with the daily life, "Shit must Stop" shows the artist how to come to terms with forces that often drive them into the seclusion of the studio.

== Publication ==

=== Shit Must Stop N°1 ===

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S.M.S Artist's Book|url=http://cdm.reed.edu/cdm4/artbooks/sms.php|website=Reed Digital Collection|accessdate=5 May 2016}}{{dead link|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The First edition of Shit Must Stop contains 11 different portfolios from important artists, ([[Irving Petlin]], [[Su Braden]], [[James Lee Byars]], [[Christo]], [[Walter De Maria|Walter de Maria]], [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[Kaspar Koening]], [[Julien Levy]], [[Sol Mednick]], [[Nancy Reitkopf]], [[La Monte Young]] &amp; [[Marian Zazeela]]). The artists scaled their project into similar format, in this edition, into a small size packet. In this case, Christo who works with large environmental collaborations, scaled down his works in order to create a small sized two dimensinal diorama. Julian Levy also contributed a list of prescriptions for faux medications, capsules for artists he determined in need of treatment. Both of these allow for the artist's voice to shine through, while still maintaining the integrity of William Copley's project. This issue reads more like a journal than the following issue that seems more interactive.

=== Shit Must Stop N°2 ===
This Second issue is more experimental with [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Nicolas Calas]], [[Bruce Conner]], Marcia Herscovitz, [[Alain Jacquet]], [[Ray Johnson]], [[Lee Lozano]], [[Meret Oppenheim]], Bernard Pfreim, [[George Reavey|George Reavevy]], [[Clovis Trouille]].

The cover, designed by Marcel Duchamp, is a white folder with a playable record album attached to the front. Printed on the record itself is ESQUIVONS LES ECCHYMOSES DES ESQUIMAUX AUX MOTS EXQUIS, which roughly translates to “dodge the Eskimo bruises with exquisite words,” but functions as a sort of French tongue twister. Duchamp seems to be playfully addressing the restrictions inherent in more traditional portfolio design in order to redefine this practice. The record has aesthetic appeal, but it similarly has far greater use value than the first issue’s front cover, which was a reproduction of a painting. Another particularly provocative work in Shit Must Stop N°2 is Bruce Connor’s Legal Tender. Connor mimics the design of American currency with his stack of eighteen “dollar bills,” which seem more reminiscent of Monopoly money than American legal tender. This element allows for the whole issue to feel like a game, as if you could trade Connor’s money for something more valuable.

=== Shit Must Stop N°3 ===
Third publication is conceived by 12 artists ([[John Battan]], [[Aftograf]], [[Enrico Baj]], [[Billy Copley]], [[Dick Higgins]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Roland Penrose]], [[Man Ray]], [[H C Westermann|H.C Westermann]], [[Hannah Weiner]], [[Terry Riley]].

It contains the widest variety of objects. It features two Terry Riley cassettes, four pieces of mail from H.C. Westermann seemingly addressed to the reader, and even an original Man Ray readymade. Terry Riley, who is famously known for his innovative avant-garde musical compositions, contributed two beautifully packaged cassettes, which feel like gifts in their own right. H.C. Westermann, who is known for his playful line drawings, mailed four drawings to William Copley, who reproduced them to an exact degree in this issue. In the sealed envelopes are four proposals, with Westermann’s own notes included. Opening these letters feels as though we are receiving mail from Westermann ourselves, which seems to have been Copley’s intention by including in the issue exactly what he received from Westermann.

=== Shit Must Stop N°4 ===
Artist ([[Robert C. Stanley|Robert Stanley]], [[Arman]], Paul Bergtold, [[John Cage]], [[Hollis Frampton]], [[On Kawara]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Lil Picard]], Domenico Rotella, [[Robert Watts]], Princess Winifred, [[La Monte Young]], [[Marian Zazeela]])

Each piece is laden with a conceptual mythology that can be thoroughly investigated or just taken at face value, which seems a great leap from the playful nature of the first few issues. A particularly interesting work from Shit Must Stop N°4 is Lil Picard’s burned bowtie. Each bowtie was hand burned, thus each number in the edition is slightly varied. The maroon and white polka dotted tie first appears as a joyful addition, but the burned edges seem a quite poignant dissenting argument. Other interesting works are Rotella’s prison poems, which were clandestinely written on scraps of paper during a five-month prison sentence in Rome, Italy. The tactile nature of the poems as works of art in their own right seems important for the overall impact of the piece, which elegantly replicates a minute part of Rotella’s prison experience.

=== Shit Must Stop N°5 ===
Participated artists are, Congo, [[William Anthony (artist)|William Anthony]], Wall Batterton, [[William Copley (artist)|William Copley]], [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]], [[Neil Jenney|Neil Jenny]], [[Angus MacLise]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[Mel Ramos]], Robert Rohm, [[William Schwendler|William Schwedler]], [[Diane Wakoski]], [[Lawrence Weiner]]

Unlike the previous issues, this one doesn’t appear to be projecting a specific sensibility upon the reader, thus making it seem more disparate than the others. This seems to be best exemplified by Yoko Ono’s contribution, entitled Mend Piece for John, which instructs, “Take your favourite cup. Break it in many pieces with a hammer. Repair it with this glue and this poem.” Included is a cardboard box containing a ribbon, plastic bag, instructions, a poem, and a tube of glue. Although Ono created this piece years before the Beatles disbanded, it seems almost precognitive of the years to come. Another similarly disparate piece from this issue is the front cover, which was painted by Congo, the chimpanzee, for a study of the creative potential of apes. It has been noted that Congo was the only chimpanzee who appeared to make aesthetic decisions about his painting, and thus could be featured alongside these other artists for the issue. Like Ono’s piece, Congo’s painting seems eerily foreboding with its large red and black smears of paint.

=== Shit Must Stop N°6 ===
The last issue produced makes a valorous attempt at preserving the initial integrity of the project that includes, [[Richard Artschwager]], [[Ed Bereal]], [[Diter Rot]], [[Betty Dodson]], Ronoldo Ferri, [[John Giorno]], Toby Mussman, Adrian Nutbeem, [[Claes Oldenburg]], Mischa Petrov, Jean Reavey, [[Bernar Venet]].

[[Richard Artschwager]]’s cover design is a simple image of a black shape reproduced on each surface of the cover, both inside and out, with reproductions of the exact coffee stains he accidentally made when producing the original. By approving of this accident, and reproducing it for the cover, Artschwager, and [[William Copley (artist)|Copley]] seem to be making an argument about the place of beauty and mistake in the contemporary art world. The rest of the pieces in this final issue seem to be playful and mischievous manifestations of this same idea, with Adrian Nutbeem’s unsolvable crossword as well as Claes Oldenburg’s Unattended Lunches. The issue also comes with an apology, which reads, “The publishers of the Letter Edged in Black Press, Inc. regretfully announce that this is the last issue of Shit Must Stop that will appear. We have appreciated your support and hope you will remember our effort with appreciation.” The vague nature of the card supports the mischievous nature of this issue’s contents, while still maintaining the sincerity of the project.

The '''Sacred Cod''' is a four-foot eleven-inch carved-wood [[effigy]] of an [[Atlantic cod]]fish, "painted to the life", hanging in the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives|House of Represen{{shy}}ta{{shy}}tives]] chamber of Boston's [[Massachusetts State House|Massachu{{shy}}setts State House]]{{mdashb}}"a memorial of the importance of the [[cod fisheries|Cod-Fishery]] to the welfare of this Commonwealth"

The Sacred Cod has gone through as many as three incarnations over three centuries: the first
(if it really existed{{mdashb}}the authoritative source calling it a "prehistoric creature of tradition")
was lost in a 1747 fire; the second disappeared during the [[American Revolution]]; and the third is the one seen in the House today.

''Sacred Cod'' is not a formal name but a nickname which appeared in 1895, soon after the carving was termed "the sacred emblem" by a House committee appointed "to investigate the significance of the emblem [which] has kept its place under all administrations, and has looked upon outgoing and incoming legislative assemblies, for more than one hundred years".{{ran|C|p=3-4,12}}  Soon ''sacred cod'' was being used in reference to actual codfish as well, in recognition of the creature's role in building Massachu{{shy}}setts' prosperity and influence since early colonial times.

In 1933 the Sacred Cod was briefly "Cod-napped" by editors of the ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]'', prompting police to [[wikt:drag#English-search water|drag]] the [[Charles River]] and search an airplane landing in [[New Jersey]]. 
In 1968 it was taken briefly again, this time by students at the [[University of Massachusetts Boston|University of Massachu{{shy}}setts Boston]].

Codfishing was the first industry practiced by Europeans in Massachu{{shy}}setts, and it is said that the colony's first export was a cargo of fish.{{ran|C|p=23}}
Thus the codfish has been an important [[New England]] symbol for centuries, its image appearing on many early coins, stamps, corporate and government seals, and insignia such as the early crest of the ''[[Salem Gazette]]''.
In 1743 a prominent [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] businessman built a mansion in which "the end of every

{{paragraph break}}
Humble the subject and homely the design; yet this painted image bears on its finny front a majesty greater than the dignity that art can lend to graven gold or chiselled marble.
The sphere it fills is vaster than that through which its prototype careered with all the myriad tribes of the great deep.
The lessons that may be learned of it are nobler than any to be drawn from what is beautiful; for this sedate and solitary fish is instinct with memories and proph{{shy}}ecy, like an oracle. It swims symbolic in that wider sea whose confines are the limits set to the activities of human thought. It typifies to the citizens of the Common{{shy}}wealth and of the world the founding of a State. It commem{{shy}}o{{shy}}rates Democracy. It celebrates the rise of free institutions. It emphasizes progress. It epitomizes Massachu{{shy}}setts.
&lt;!--[[[par break]]]To the sober student of the world's past this his{{shy}}toric codfish is fraught with ripe signif{{shy}}i{{shy}}cance. A few details as to the origin and vicissi{{shy}}tudes of this material emblem may shed some light on its serious purpose and high mission.

What is now called the Sacred Cod has hung for three centuries{{mdashb}}though with inter{{shy}}rupt{{shy}}ions, and in at least two (and possibly three) successive incarnations{{mdashb}}in the chamber of the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives|Massachu{{shy}}setts House of Represen{{shy}}ta{{shy}}tives]] (or its prede{{shy}}ces{{shy}}sor, the House of Assembly of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Province of Massachu{{shy}}setts Bay]]).

===First Cod===

Of the Cod's first incarnation, the Committee on History of the Emblem of the Codfish (appointed by the House in 1895) wrote:
{{quote|There is a dim tradition that in the primitive House of Assembly of the Province there hung a codfish which was the gift of [[Samuel Sewall|Judge Samuel Sewall]] [a judge at the [[Salem witch trials]] who] died in 1729.&lt;!--one source says Sewell died Jan 1 1730 -- a calendar reform issue here?--&gt; [But his] published [[wikt:remains#English-writings|remains]] make no mention of this tradi{{shy}}tional fish, and it is difficult to imagine that a man of his loquacious verbosity would have omitted to chronicle his munificence.{{ran|C|p=17}}
}}
Assuming it existed and whatever its origin, when the State House burned in 1747 "this prehis{{shy}}toric creature of tradi{{shy}}tion{{nbsp}}... doubtless went up in a whirl of smoke which still clouds its history to the peering vision of the antiquarian."{{hsp}}{{ran|C|p=17}}

===Second Cod===

A second Cod appeared sometime between 1748 (when the State House was rebuilt) and 1773 (when [[Thomas Crafts, Jr.]] billed the Province of Massachu{{shy}}setts Bay, "To painting Codfish, 15 shillings").
But within a few years, the Committee wrote, the second Cod
{{quote|&lt;!--At some indeterminate time subsequent to the painting of the codfish by Thomas Crafts, Jr., it--&gt;disap{{shy}}peared from the State House and was doubtless destroyed, for the closest histor{{shy}}i{{shy}}cal research fails to shed any light upon the time, manner or cause of its disap{{shy}}pear{{shy}}ance, or to disclose any refer{{shy}}ence to it whatever. Mayhap some burly British trooper, quart{{shy}}ered in the improvised barracks of the old State House [during the [[Siege of Boston]]], took umbrage at the spick and span elegance of the newly painted emblem of colonial inde{{shy}}pend{{shy}}ence and thrift. Such a one may have torn down the cherished symbol from the wall whence it had offered aid and comfort to the rebel patriots, with its assur{{shy}}ance of the material wealth accessible to the embry{{shy}}onic State, and, in spirit of vandalism so preva{{shy}}lent at that age, used it to replenish his evening camp fire.&lt;!-- Whatever may have been its fate in that epoch of political upheaval, no record was left to tell the tale.--&gt;{{ran|C|p=17{{hyphen}}18}}
}}
The Committee found "good reason to believe that this missing fish{{nbsp}}...&lt;!--, or [less likely] its successor, which has come down to us, --&gt; was carved by one John Welch, a Boston patriot".{{efn|
{{ran|C|p=18{{hyphen}}19}}
The Committee discussed at length whether the Cod sculpted by Welch was the second in the series, or the third: "There seems good reason to believe that this missing fish, or its successor, which has come down to us, was carved by one John Welch, a Boston patriot. Welch was born Aug.{{nbsp}}11, 1711. He was a well-known citizen, and lived on Green Lane in West Boston. In 1756 he was a captain in the [[Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company]]. He, [like John Rowe], was one of the signers of the famous petition or memorial, charging the officers of the Crown with appropriating to their own use money belonging to the Province. The descendants of John Welch have always insisted that he carved the State House codfish of today. His great-great-grandson, Capt. Francis Welch, is now living in Brook{{shy}}line, at the age of eight-six, and he has recently stated that the truth of this assertion has always been recognized among the family tradi{{shy}}tions. It has been handed down from father to son uncontradicted for at least three generations. Captain Welch's father repeatedly told him that he heard the story from the lips of his grandfather, and never expressed the least doubt in regard to it.
{{paragraph break}}
"Conceding the authenticity of this tradition, a question remains as to which of the two codfishes was the handiwork of John Welch. Welch died Feb.{{nbsp}}9, 1789; so that, if he carved the fish now in the State House, he must have been in his seventy-fourth year. This seems unlikely, whereas he might easily have wrought the codfish Thomas Crafts painted; and it is quite probable that, in the growing vagueness of domestic tradi{{shy}}tion, the identity of the two may have been con{{shy}}founded.  In that chaotic revolu{{shy}}tion{{shy}}ary period which left us no record of the loss or destruction of the object of Thomas Crafts' artistic attention, the Welch family may easily have lost trace of it, and have taken it for granted that the older emblem is the actual symbol of today."
}}

===Third Cod===

The third Cod was installed in 1784, after Represen{{shy}}ta{{shy}}tive [[John Rowe (merchant)|John Rowe]]{{mdashb}}namesake of [[Rowes Wharf]] and "a leading spirit in the stirring scenes that led up to the famous 'Boston Tea Party{{'"}}{{hsp}}{{ran|C|p=16}}{{mdashb}}asked leave "to hang up the represen{{shy}}ta{{shy}}tion of a Cod Fish in the room where the House sit, as a memorial of the import{{shy}}ance of the Cod-Fishery to the welfare of this Common{{shy}}wealth, as had been usual form{{shy}}erly{{nbsp}}... And so the emblem was suspended" in the old State House once again, and this Cod (which Rowe may have under{{shy}}writ{{shy}}ten person{{shy}}ally) is the one extant today.{{ran|C|p=20}}

In 1798 it was moved to the Representatives chamber in the [[Massachusetts State House|new State House]],{{ran|C|p=12{{hyphen}}13}}
where it originally hung over the Speaker's desk. In the 1850s it was moved to the rear of the chamber.{{efn
|{{ran|C|p=20}}
The Committee elaborated: "In 1867, for a brief space, the fish was missing from its accustomed haunt; but it soon returned, brighter than before, in a new coat of submarine motley. Again, in 1874, while the chamber was being renovated, the codfish was taken down to be repainted; and at the time [the House's 'vener{{shy}}able door{{shy}}keeper'] Captain Tucker measured it, finding its length to be four feet and eleven inches. He also noted that it was carved from a solid piece of wood. Since that time, a period of twenty-one years, the sacred emblem has not been profaned by mortal touch."

On January{{nbsp}}2, 1895{{mdashb}}the House's last day of business before relocating to a new chamber in the same building{{mdash}}
{{quote|[t]he question of taking with it the "represen{{shy}}ta{{shy}}tion of a codfish," which for more than a hundred years had never missed a "roll call," was brought up for consideration. It was, however, deemed wise to investigate the significance of the emblem before its removal{{nbsp}}...}}
Accordingly, after "nearly two months of painstaking research and investigation" the three-member Committee on History of the Emblem of the Codfish submitted its report, and after debating "at length" the House ordered "immediate removal of the ancient 'represen{{shy}}ta{{shy}}tion of a codfish' from its present position in the chamber recently vacated by the House, and to cause it to be sus{{shy}}pended{{nbsp}}...&lt;!-- in a suitable place over the Speaker's chair [[[[omitted because a subsequent order modified the Cod's destination]]]]--&gt; in this cham{{shy}}ber{{nbsp}}..."{{hsp}}{{ran|C|p=4}}

The Sacred Cod was wrapped in an American flag, placed on a bier, and{{mdashb}}escorted by the Sergeant-at-Arms{{mdashb}}borne by House messen{{shy}}gers to the new House chamber, where the assembled Represen{{shy}}ta{{shy}}tives rose in applause.{{ran|C|p=7}} 
After repainting by [[Walter M. Brackett]], it was hung where it remains today:
"&lt;!--opposite the Speaker's chair --&gt;between the two sets of central columns, and under the names '[[John Lothrop Motley|Motley]],' and '[[Francis Parkman|Parkman]]',"{{hsp}}{{ran|C|p=20}}

editors of the ''Lampoon'', to distract their ''Crimson'' competitors from interfering with the planned "Cod-napping", first "&lt;!--The first gun of the day was fired when ''Lampoon'' editors --&gt;laid siege to the ''Crimson'' building at 5:15 o'clock in the morning and commenced a futile search for the morning's papers which they intended to stamp 'Compliments of the Lampoon.'

In [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], meanwhile, an arranged fracas between ''Lampoon'' and ''Crimson'' men was staged for the benefit of invited journalists.{{r|"Canny Crimson"}} After sundry other hijinx, &lt;!--"Shortly after 4 o'clock, --&gt;"Boyd was taken from Wellesley to Boston, where he and his cap{{shy}}tors{{nbsp}}...&lt;!--, together with Creighton Churchill{{nbsp}}'36, and W.K.{{nbsp}}Wyant, Jr.{{nbsp}}'35,--&gt; were entertained at tea by friends of the kidnaped editor."{{hsp}}{{r|"Canny Crimson"}}&lt;!--{{paragraph break}}Meanwhile the treasurer of the Lampoon, anxious to supply the papers with stories for their morning editions, arranged with radio station WBZ in Boston to have Boyd speak over the air in the evening. Upon his refusal to do this in spite of threats, R.J. Walsh{{nbsp}}'34, Ibis of the Lampoon, undertook to impersonate Boyd, and succeeded in hoaxing the managers of the radio station into allowing him to broadcast.
{{paragraph break}}At 9.30 o'clock, Boyd reached the ''Crimson'' by telephone to reveal his whereabouts and to say that his erstwhile captors would not interfere with his return. Half an hour later he was met by representatives of the ''Crimson'', and returned to Cambridge.--&gt;

Late on April 27, having deduced that the ''Lampoon'' was behind the Cod theft, ''Crimson'' editors issued an ultimatum: either the ''Lampoon'' hand the Cod over by midnight (allowing the ''Crimson'' to take credit for its return), or its deeds would be exposed.
On the morning of April 28, ''The New York Times'' reported that the ''Crimson'' had accused the ''Lampoon'' of taking the Cod.{{refn|name=NYT2|{{cite news |title=Sacred Cod Theft Laid to ''Lampoon''{{mdashb}}Prank Angers Officials{{mdashb}}They Warn That Miscreant Will Be Persecuted{{mdashb}}Return Promised in Call Twitting Curley|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB071FFB3F5C16738DDDA10A94DC405B838FF1D3&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Sacred%20Cod%20theft%20laid%20to%20%27Lampoon%27&amp;st=cse|date=April 28, 1933 |work= The New York Times|p=19

In 1937 Representative [[John B.

'''Spider Jerusalem''' is a fictional character and the [[protagonist]] of the [[comic book]] ''[[Transmetropolitan]]'', created by writer [[Warren Ellis]] and artist [[Darick Robertson]], introduced under the now-defunct [[Helix (comics)|Helix]] imprint of [[DC Comics]] before being moved to the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] imprint.  

He is a sarcastic, [[drug]]-addicted, [[profanity|foul-mouthed]], troubled, bitter, but brilliant [[Gonzo journalism|gonzo journalist]] with a deep-seated hatred of authority, political corruption, and dogs. Spider is almost always drawn wearing a set of [[stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] sunglasses with one lens red and the other green, and he is most often compared to the real-life figure [[Hunter S. Thompson]].

[[IGN]] named him 45th of the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes.
==Background==

Spider is a renegade [[Gonzo journalism|gonzo journalist]] forced to return to [[The City (Transmetropolitan)|The City]] after having exhausted a substantial advance from a publisher without completing the books required by contract. After five years of effective retirement as a long-haired hermit in a compound in the mountains, he returns to [[The City (Transmetropolitan)|The City]] to complete the books, takes up work for an urban newspaper to support his writing, and finds himself battling political corruption at the highest level.

One of Spider's most apparent character traits is his heavy drug use, which he makes no attempt to conceal. In addition to being a chain smoker and heavy drinker, Spider uses an extensive and bewildering variety of drugs ranging from mild [[stimulant]]s, [[Nootropic|intellect enhancers]], and [[Psychedelic drug|mood-altering drug]]s to cocaine, heroin and rare, exotic, futuristic drugs. As is common in his society, Spider is resistant or immune to many forms of drug addiction, as well as lung cancer. Spider is well known for his foul language, especially when combining the word "fuck" with other words to make new and amusing insults. Spider is easily angered, his displays of temper ranging from mild verbal outbursts to violent physical assault. However, despite his temper and contempt for the City as a whole, Spider is often seen to treat innocents (particularly children) with kindness and care.  

Spider's past is not well known, though characters like Mitchell Royce and Spider himself have referred to past memorable incidents such as the ''enfant terrible'' (a French child assassin from the Anglo/Franco war) and the Prague telephone incident (in which Spider caused six politicians to commit suicide using just a phone). There are also hints at his childhood, which seems to have been extremely turbulent - somewhere between a victim of [[urban blight]] and a [[child soldier]] - and his early ambitions—"I wanted to be a [[sniper]] when I grew up. Didn't everyone?" - as well as his parents' growing madness.

He claims to have worked as a prostitute at some point in the past, and as a stripper at 8 years old. He grew up on the City's docks with drunken parents as an only child. His father drove a city bus and his mother was a housewife who cooked lizards for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. He returned to the docks as an adult to see that everyone was gone and the docks were abandoned and vowed to never forget his childhood there.

==Philosophy==
Spider is a firm believer in the [[truth]] and delivering it to his readers in the most direct and blunt manner possible, often capitalising it as "The Truth" in his writing for emphasis. This is most notable in one story, when Spider's editor recounts the tale of how Spider submitted an article on the election of the [[Richard Nixon]]-analogue "[[List of Transmetropolitan characters#Presidents|The Beast]]", which consisted of the word "fuck" repeated eight thousand times (see ''Transmetropolitan #1''). His approach to journalism has been encapsulated by Spider as "The truth...no matter what," and his appraisal of others rises if they feel the same way.

The primary focus of conflict within Spider's psyche, over the course of the series, is a combination of concern for his delivery of 'The Truth' and [[misanthropy]] towards his public. Spider hates and struggles against authority figures who oppress others, but he is also bitter toward the uninvolved public who give the authority its power. Likewise, he struggles to convince the public to listen to The Truth, but is disgusted by those who blindly accept what he reports. In addition, Spider's talents earn him unwanted fame and adoration, which clouds his ability to "get at The Truth", often resulting in him experiencing writer's block and depression. His editor, [[Mitchell Royce]], opines that Spider needs to be hated in order to function as a writer and journalist.

Despite his absolute disdain for those around him, Spider is quite loyal to those few who he considers friends and is equally quick to hurt those who would betray him. Indeed, much of Spider's motivation in the second half of the series was dedicated to bringing the President to justice for ordering the murder of [[List of Transmetropolitan characters#Allies|Vita Severn]], whom Spider had befriended.

Although he opposed The Beast, Spider is not loyal to any political party or organization, and his initial support of [[List of Transmetropolitan characters#Presidents|The Smiler]] was tinged with contempt at his [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] attitude and false [[altruism]]. He is also an avowed, often virulent [[atheism|atheist]] who opposes all organized religion, which he sees as little more than unworthy authority figures that exploit their members.

==Weapons==
He proudly claims to be "always armed", and is shown with several firearms, at least one of which, called "The Upper Hand", can blow up a vehicle. He has also possessed a rocket launcher, which he used to blow up a bar at the base of his mountain home. He was accidentally given a [[bandolier]] of grenades at a party, which he took as a sign that "There is a God".

Spider's weapon of choice for most of the series is a "bowel disruptor," which causes instant and painful loss of [[fecal incontinence|bowel control]], with settings that allow him to vary the level of pain and discomfort, ranging from simple loose, watery [[diarrhea]] to complete [[rectal prolapse]]. Most of the time the victim has a bowel movement so dramatic and agonizing that it induces [[unconsciousness]]. At least three times it is revealed through dialogue that the gun can be set to 'Fatal Intestinal [[Maelstrom]]'. Spider prefers this weapon because, despite being illegal, it is (usually) non-lethal and its effects are untraceable. His assistants, [[Channon Yarrow|Channon]] and [[Yelena Rossini|Yelena]], have also been armed with bowel disruptors during ''The Cure'' arc. 

On a few occasions, he has been known to carry lethal [[firearm]]s, though according to Spider, he only carries such weapons in emergency cases. He has, in at least one case, used a handgun to kill two would-be assassins (a third was beaten to death). In issue #38, he is revealed to be a competent gunfighter, having learned his skills in "places you never want to go." It is also revealed in issue #38 that he has killed sixteen people, all but one in self-defence; he never specifies how or why (although it could be inferred that he means Vita Severn, as Spider feels responsible for her death).

Regardless of whether or not he is armed, Spider is shown to be a surprisingly capable, though not invincible, fighter. He frequently lashes out violently at those who threaten or aggravate him, and his ferocity often allows him to defeat opponents who are well-trained or much more imposing physically. He is also not averse to brutalizing people in order to get crucial information (as is shown in his Year Five assault on [[List of Transmetropolitan characters#Other antagonists|Fred Christ]]). Like [[Channon Yarrow|Channon]], he had also gained experience in firearms while in school, though unlike Channon, he and his classmates had had to ''make'' their own arms—to prevent the teachers having an unfair advantage. He often uses improvised weapons to gain the upper hand - for example, putting his cigarette out in the eye of a guard or beating Fred Christ with a broken chair leg, which he dubbed "The Chair Leg of Truth".

==Appearance==
Initially, Spider is shown with a huge amount of muddy brown, shaggy hair and a long unkempt beard, claiming he has hair in places that his once and future editor/friend Mitchell Royce doesn't even know he owns.  On his return to the City, nearly all his hair is removed by a malfunctioning cleaning unit in his first apartment's bathroom. For the rest of the series, he is portrayed as virtually hairless, the exception being his eyebrows and a small amount of pubic hair. Spider is a small, slight figure with a long nose and slightly crooked teeth. His body is covered with black [[tattoo]]s, combining geometric tribal designs and other more [[Western world|Western]] images (his right buttock is marked "kiss here"), including a small spider on his upper forehead. He is also said to have a tattoo on his penis, though this is never shown.

Although he prefers not to wear clothes much of the time, when in public his primary mode of dress is typically a "black linen suit, urban weight, generous cut" (jacket and pants, no shirt under the jacket) with a pair of heavy black leather boots, although during the winter he is sometimes seen wearing a black [[sweater|jumper]] under his jacket; also, on the rare occasions when modesty is required of him he will wear knee-length [[boxer shorts]]. He also wears a pair of 'live-shades', [[sunglasses]] with [[Hidden camera|built-in still-photography]] capabilities; the right lens is green and rectangular, whilst the left one is red and circular (the AI that created them was on drugs at the time). The first pair he owns have gold rims around the lenses, while the ones he obtains during the second part of the ''Dirge'' arc have no rims. This appearance, and the comic's futuristic setting, has made Spider Jerusalem a cult (albeit fictional) character among [[Rivethead|rivet heads]], in a similar manner to [[Tank Girl]].

==Influences==
Spider Jerusalem is reminiscent of previous "[[Muckraker|muck-raking]]" or "[[Gonzo journalism|Gonzo]]" journalists such as [[H. L. Mencken]] and [[Hunter S. Thompson]]. 

Hunter S. Thompson is perhaps the most obvious inspiration for the character of Spider Jerusalem, and the fictional reporter's fondness for weaponry and spectacular [[Recreational drug use|consumption]] of drugs both indicate a resemblance toward the American gonzo journalist. (In Transmetropolitan #13, page 5, a book by Thompson is clearly visible amongst the objects strewn across the table in Spider's apartment. A book entitled "FEAR AND LOATHING" is also visible in Issue #1, Page 1, Panel 3, in the lower left-hand corner of the panel.)

Visually, Spider Jerusalem is based on Darick Robertson's friend Andre Ricciardi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Robertson|first=Darick|interviewer=Jaime Kiffel|title=An Interview with Darick Robertson|url=http://www.lollipop.com/article.php3?content=issue59/darickrobertson.html|access-date=8 July 2015|quote=K: I read that your friends sometimes appear as the models for characters in Transmetropolitan. For instance, your friend André Ricciardi was the model for Spider... R: André is still a close friend. When it came time to do Spider, he was so much like Spider in his own right... Spider ended up being older and kind of growing into his own character by himself, but André is definitely the basis for it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Planetary''==
One of Ellis' other titles, ''[[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]]'', features a character in its seventh issue named Jack Carter, who is a thinly-veiled pastiche of [[John Constantine]], being essentially identical in appearance, role, abilities and diction. The issue is essentially a retrospective commentary on the genre of grim, British-penned comics of the anti-[[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcherite]] 1980s milieu, of which the Carter character is positioned as the apotheosis. Having faked his own death, Carter reappears in a dramatically altered form with a shaved head and long black coat which he later opens to reveal a bare chest featuring identical tattoos to Spider Jerusalem. Lacking only the spider tattoo on the head and the trademark shades, this former Constantine-cipher has become the spitting image of Jerusalem and departs with the words: "The Eighties are long over. Time to Move on. Time to be someone else."

==Reception==

[[File:Frans Hals 013.jpg|thumb|''The Banquet of the Officers of the St George Militia Company in 1627'']]
'''''The Banquet of the Officers of the St George Militia Company in 1627''''' refers to a [[schutterstuk]] painted by [[Frans Hals]] for the St. George (or St. Joris) civic guard of [[Haarlem]], and today is considered one of the main attractions of the [[Frans Hals Museum]] there.

In this group, each man wears a sash belonging to the color of the "rot", in this painting all three are represented with their flag-bearers wearing the colours Orange, white or blue. These officers were selected by the council of Haarlem to serve for three years, and this group had just finished their tenure and celebrated their end of service with a portrait. The man with the orange sash holding a glass of wine sitting at the table on the left and looking at Captain [[Michiel de Wael]] with an empty glass, is Colonel [[Aart Jansz Druyvesteyn]], who heads the table.

The men featured are from left to right Lieutenant [[Cornelis Boudewijns]] (standing above Colonel Aernout Druyvesteyn), Captain [[Nicolaes Verbeek]], Flag bearer [[Boudewijn van Offenberg]], Lieutenant [[Jacob Pietersz Olycan]], Captain Michiel de Wael, and above him, standing, is Flag bearer [[Dirck Dicx]] looking down at Jacob Olycan. Just behind him in the background is the servant [[Arent Jacobsz Koets]], and below him, seated, is Lieutenant [[Frederik Coning]]. Behind the servant in the far right, is the flag bearer [[Jacob Cornelisz Schout]] who towers above the dwarf in the lower right, Captain [[Nicolaes le Febure]].

==St. Jorisdoelen==
[[File:Grote Houtstraat 142 Haarlem RM 19243.jpg|thumb|View of one of the halls of the St. Jorisdoelen]]
The painting previously hung with others in the old "St. Jorisdoelen" complex, known today as the [[Proveniershuis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://monumentenregister.cultureelerfgoed.nl/php/main.php?cAction=search&amp;cOffset=1&amp;cLimit=25&amp;oOrder=ASC&amp;cSubmit=1&amp;sCompMonNr=19243 report] on [[Rijksmonument]] number 19243&lt;/ref&gt;  The paintings by Hals and others hung in the main hall of the complex in the [[Grote Houtstraat]]. Today a [[hofje]] with the main hall used as a restaurant, the main buildings were used for years as an inn, where the schutterstukken were tourist attractions. Today all of the schutterstukken that once hung here have been transferred to the Frans Hals Museum.

The artist intended to show the compassion of General George Washington in this painting, as he wrote in the catalogue for his exhibited works at [[Yale University]] in 1835:{{quote|
The magnanimous kindness displayed by Washington, on this occasion, offers a sublime example of true heroism, and well deserves to be imitated by all military men.

==Description==
In the center of the painting, American General George Washington is focusing his attention on the needs of the mortally wounded Hessian Colonel [[Johann Gottlieb Rall]]. Rall is being helped by American Major [[William Stephens Smith]], [[aide-de-camp]] to General [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]]. Washington orders Smith to "call our best surgeons to his assistance, and let us save his life if possible."&lt;ref name=trumbull/&gt; During the battle, Rall had been shot twice and needed to be carried into his headquarters, where he died that night.{{sfnp|Fischer|2006|pages=248, 255}}  Behind Washington, on horseback, are his aides, Colonel [[Robert H.

==Critical reception==
Trumbull did not use the prelude to the capture, namely the [[George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River|crossing of the Delaware River]], as a subject. Artists did not paint that until 1819 by [[Thomas Sully]] and then notably by [[Emanuel Leutze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Staiti|first1=Paul|title=Of Arms and Artists: The American Revolution through Painters' Eyes|date=2016|page=221|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lhgLDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT221|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|isbn=978-1-63286-465-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trumbull's work drew criticism from historian and painter [[William Dunlap]] after he viewed it in the Trumbull Gallery at Yale in 1834:&lt;ref name=yale/&gt; {{quote|All that is good in this picture was painted in 1789 and shortly after.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5355">"'''The Haunted Palace'''" is a [[poetry|poem]] by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. The 48-line poem was first released in the April 1839 issue of [[Nathan C. Brooks|Nathan Brooks']] ''[[American Museum (Brooks magazine)|American Museum]]'' magazine. It was eventually incorporated into "[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]" as a song written by Roderick Usher.

==Analysis==
The poem serves as an [[allegory]] about a king "in the olden time long ago" who is afraid of evil forces that threaten him and his palace, foreshadowing impending doom. As part of "The Fall of the House of Usher", Poe said, "I mean to imply a mind haunted by phantoms — a disordered brain" &lt;ref&gt;Meyers, Jeffrey. ''Edgar Allan Poe: His Life and Legacy''. Cooper Square Press, 2001. p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; referring to Roderick Usher.

The poem takes a marked change in tone towards the second to last stanza. After discussing the wit and wisdom of the king, and song and beauty in the kingdom:

:''But evil things, in robes of sorrow,''
:''Assailed the monarch's high estate.''

The house and family are destroyed and, apparently, become phantoms.

The beginning of the poem compares the structure with a human head. For example, the windows are eyes, its door representing a mouth. The exterior represents physical features while the interior represents the mind engaged in imaginative thought.&lt;ref&gt;Wilbur, Richard. "The House of Poe," collected in ''Poe: A Collection of Critical Essays'', edited by Robert Regan. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1967: 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
In 1845, [[Thomas Dunn English]] claimed Poe had tried to sell "The Haunted Palace" to [[John L. O'Sullivan]] of the ''[[The United States Magazine and Democratic Review|Democratic Review]]'' but was rejected because he "found it impossible to comprehend it".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Dwight &amp; David K. Jackson. ''The Poe Log: A Documentary Life of Edgar Allan Poe, 1809–1849''. Boston: G. K. Hall &amp; Co., 1987: 587. {{ISBN|0-7838-1401-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear if this is true. The poem was published in the April 1839 issue of the ''Baltimore Museum''.&lt;ref name=Sova104&gt;Sova, Dawn B. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z''. Checkmark Books, 2001: 104. {{ISBN|0-8160-4161-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[Rufus Wilmot Griswold]], a known rival of Poe's, claimed that Poe had [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] the poem from [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s "Beleaguered City". Poe denied that charge and suggested that Longfellow had, in fact, plagiarized from him.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, Sidney P. ''Poe's Literary Battles: The Critic in the Context of his Literary Milieu''. Southern Illinois University Press, 1969: 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, "The Haunted Palace" was one of the poems highlighted in Griswold's ''[[The Poets and Poetry of America]]'', one of the first [[anthology|anthologies]] of American poetry in 1842.&lt;ref name=Sova104/&gt; When the poem was reprinted by the ''New World'' in 1845, Charles Eames introduced it as exquisite. "We can hardly call to mind in the whole compass of American Poetry, a picture of more intense and glowing Ideality."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Dwight and David K. Jackson. ''The Poe Log: A Documentary Life of Edgar Allan Poe 1809–1849''. Boston: G. K. Hall, 1987: 498. {{ISBN|0-8161-8734-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
In 1904, French composer [[Florent Schmitt]] wrote an [[etude]], ''Le palais hante'', derived from "The Haunted Palace".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americansymphony.org/dialogues_extensions/99_2000season/1999_10_15/schmitt.cfm AmericanSymphony.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, the poem provided the title for a [[Roger Corman]] film of the [[The Haunted Palace|same name]]. The actual plot of Corman's film ''The Haunted Palace'' comes almost entirely from ''[[The Case of Charles Dexter Ward]]'', a novel by [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. By 1963, Corman had produced several highly lucrative films based on Poe's work, but Lovecraft  was not at that time a well-known author; according to Corman on the DVD making-of featurette, the studio forced him to name this movie after one of Poe's poems (and included a Poe epigraph in the credits) so that audiences would believe it to be another film based on Poe's writings.

In 1987, Bulgarian rock band [[Shturcite]] released a song, "Omagiosaniyat zamuk". The song's lyrics are a translation of ''The Haunted Palace'' into Bulgarian but, in 1990, when the track was released on the compilation ''The Crickets'', the track title was back-translated into English as "The Haunted Castle".

In 2009, Lithuanian contemporary classical music composer Giedrius Alkauskas wrote an [[Art song]] for a bass singer and a piano, based on the translation of "The Haunted Palace" into Lithuanian made by Aleksys Churginas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bernardinai.lt/straipsnis/2011-04-26-giedrius-alkauskas-i-sapnu-ir-burtu-lauka/61863 (in Lithuanian, [[Bernardinai.lt]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GawyXCCIfm4.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Paper Chase''''' is an American [[drama (film and television)|drama]] television series based on a [[The Paper Chase (novel)|1970 novel]] by [[John Jay Osborn, Jr.]], as well as a [[The Paper Chase (film)|1973 film adaptation]]. It follows the lives of law student James T. Hart and his classmates at an unnamed law school, modeled on [[Harvard Law School]] but filmed on the [[University of Southern California]] campus (featuring its Bovard Administration Building, [[Doheny Library]] and Von KleinSmid Center) and in Stages 2 and 4 at [[20th Century Fox]] Studios in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077058/locations ''The Paper Chase'' (1978-1986): Filming Locations, Internet Movie Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot overview==

===Season 1===
James T. Hart is a law student from rural [[Minnesota]] who enters the intensely competitive environment of a prestigious law school specifically to study with Professor Charles W. Kingsfield, the world's leading authority on [[contract law]]. Kingsfield inspires both awe and fear in his students in his unremitting determination to prepare them for the practice of law.

To cope with the heavy workload, Hart joins a study group organized by Franklin Ford III. Ford is under immense pressure to succeed. His family has produced an unbroken string of outstanding lawyers going back generations, culminating in his demanding father, the senior partner in a very prestigious Wall Street law firm. The study group includes smooth woman-chaser Thomas Craig Anderson, slob Willis Bell, idealistic activist Elizabeth Logan, and struggling Jonathan Brooks, who is married to Asheley. Brooks drops out after he voluntarily confesses to cheating.

Hart works part-time at Ernie's Tavern to help pay his way through school. In the pilot, a waitress ([[Marilu Henner]]) shows him the ropes.

There was a four-year hiatus between the end of the first season and the start of the second.

===Season 2===
Hart survives the first year with flying colors and joins the staff of ''Law Review'' (an honor reserved for the top students), under the leadership of Gerald Golden. He becomes romantically involved with first-year law student Connie Lehman, only to lose her when she wins a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] and goes to [[Oxford University]]. Later, he repeatedly clashes with ''Law Review'' rival Rita Harriman, though he admits to Ford that he is perversely attracted to her.

===Season 3===
Hart is now the president of ''Law Review''. The new students include Ford's younger brother Tom and former housewife Rose Samuels. The Ford brothers have to come to terms with their [[sibling rivalry]]. Rose deals with a surprise divorce and being so much older than her classmates.

===Season 4===
This season consists of only six episodes, including a two-part finale. In the two-hour finale, Hart has to decide between taking a federal court clerkship or a position in a private firm after graduation. His decision is further complicated when he is invited to apply for a newly vacant faculty position at the school, an option opposed by Kingsfield, who believes he lacks the necessary experience. Hart, the top student in the graduating class, gives the [[commencement speech]], bringing the series to a close.

==Production==
===Development===
The [[CBS]] [[television]] [[television network|network]] aired the series in the [[1978 in television|1978]]–1979 season. [[John Houseman]] reprised his [[Film|movie]] role, and [[James Stephens (actor)|James Stephens]] played Hart. It was cancelled after one year; [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] subsequently [[rerun|rebroadcast]] all of the episodes. In [[1983 in television|1983]], pay-[[cable television|cable]] network [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] brought back the show with both Houseman and Stephens, as well as some other members of the original television cast. At the end of the fourth season, Hart finally graduates from law school.

===Theme music===
In the first year, the theme song was "The First Years", written by [[Norman Gimbel]] and [[Charles Fox (composer)|Charles Fox]], and performed by [[Seals and Crofts]]. In the pilot, the opening used an instrumental version, and the ending used a different vocal version. Starting in the second year, a [[Classical music|classical]] instrumental piece replaced it.

===Opening narrative===
In the first year, the program opens with Professor Kingsfield, in class, saying, "The study of law is something new and unfamiliar to most of you—unlike any other schooling you have ever known before."  After the theme song, he continues: "You teach yourselves the law but I train your minds.  You come in here with a skull full of mush, and, if you survive, you leave thinking like a lawyer."

[[File:Robert Gibb - The Thin Red Line.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Robert Gibb]], ''The Thin Red Line'', 1881, [[National War Museum]], Edinburgh]]

[[File:Battle of Balaclava (map 1).png|thumb|First stage of the [[Battle of Balaklava]]. Ryzhov's cavalry attacked over the [[Causeway Heights]] (with its line of redoubts marked "1" to "6") at approximately 09:15, and were met by the [[Sutherland Highlanders]] at the hill north of [[Kadikoi]] (marked "B").]]

'''''The Thin Red Line''''' is an 1881 oil-on-canvas painting by [[Robert Gibb]] depicting the [[93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot]] at the [[Battle of Balaclava]] on 25 October 1854, during the [[Crimean War]]. In an incident which became known as "[[The Thin Red Line (Battle of Balaclava)|The Thin Red Line]]", a two-deep line of around 500 red-coated Scottish infantry from the [[Highland Brigade (United Kingdom)|Highland Brigade]] – with support from around 1,000 Royal Marines and Turkish infantry along with six guns of field artillery – stood firm against a force of around 2,500 Russian cavalrymen. The incident was a small one, in the context of the battle and the war as a whole, but became the focus for celebrating the stoicism and steadfastness of the British Army after Gibb's painting was exhibited.

==Background==
The Russians were moving to attack the British base of operations at the port of [[Balaklava|Balaclava]]. After the Russians captured defensive redoubts on the Causeway Heights to the north of Balakava from around 6am on 25 October, about 2,500 Russian cavalry commanded by Lieutenant General [[Ivan Ivanovich Ryzhov]] were sent to probe forwards at around 9 am. The small force of British and Turkish infantry was the last line of defence before Balaklava, but was sheltering from Russian artillery fire behind a hill north of [[Kadikoi]], about {{convert|1|mi}} north of Balaclava.

The infantry moved to defend the top of the hill, and around 400 of the cavalry, possibly four squadrons of the [[12th Ingermanland Hussars]], were ordered to charge them. The Turkish infantry fired one ineffective long-distance volley and retreated, but the British infantry remained in place. Their commander Sir [[Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde|Colin Campbell]] decided against forming his six companies of Highlanders into [[infantry square|square]], the usual defensive tactic, or even a more robust formation of four ranks: instead, the vulnerable line of infantry fixed bayonets and fired several volleys with their [[Minié rifle]]s. The body of cavalry split into two, swerved aside, and withdrew.

The war correspondent of ''The Times'', [[William Howard Russell|William H. Russell]], observed the scene, later describing the Russian cavalry as charging at a "thin red streak tipped with a line of steel", which later became known as "the thin red line".

Thinking that an unsupported line of infantry could not hold back a cavalry charge, General Ryzhov assumed there was a stronger force out of sight behind the line of Highlanders, and the remainder of its cavalry held its position. Within a few minutes, the Russians were forced to retreat after the [[Charge of the Heavy Brigade]]. The Highlanders remained in their defensive position until the battle concluded a few hours later, after the disastrous [[Charge of the Light Brigade]].

==Painting==
The painting was inspired by Gibb's reading of [[Alexander Kinglake]]'s book ''The Invasion of the Crimea''. It shows the blue-coated Russian cavalry within a few yards of the red-coated British infantry, much closer than was actually the case in the battle: in reality, the cavalry came no closer than {{convert|100|-|200|yds}}.   Gibbs obtained a Highlander's uniform to ensure the accuracy of his depiction, from the [[feather bonnet]]s to the kilts and sporrans (including the large badger head sporran worn by the bearded sergeant at the right end of the line). The painting was one of three by Gibb on Crimean War themes, the others depicting incidents from the [[Battle of Alma]] (''Alma: Advance of the 42nd Highlanders'', 1889) and the [[Battle of Inkerman]] (''Saving the Colours; the Guards at Inkerman'', 1895).

The painting was first exhibited in Edinburgh, at the [[Royal Scottish Academy]]. The painting was on loan from owners [[Diageo]] to the Scottish [[National War Museum]] in [[Edinburgh Castle]] from 2000 until 2016, when it was donated to the national collection.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/b1943bae-acc2-11e6-9cb3-bb8207902122&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Young Friends Society of African Diasporan Institutions''' (YFS) exists to support, serve and promote [[African diaspora|African Diasporan]] cultural, historical, economic, educational, and community-based institutions through fundraising, event planning, educational and social programming. YFS also serves as a vehicle to promote networking opportunities and leadership development among its members to further strengthen the communities where these institutions are located. YFS is composed of individuals in their twenties, thirties and forties.&lt;ref name="The Young Friends Society of African Diasporan Institutions"&gt;[http://www.youngfriendssociety.org Official website of The Young Friends Society of African Diasporan Institutions]&lt;/ref&gt;

==African diasporan institutions==
African Diasporan Institutions are cultural, historic, educational, and economic institutions and organizations that are located in cities around the world that have large populations of people African descent. These institutions include but are not limited to museums, historical societies, theatre companies, dance companies, libraries and archives and performing arts groups.

==YFS history==
YFS began as an auxiliary group at the [[African American Museum in Philadelphia|African American Museum of Philadelphia]] (AAMP). While working as the educational coordinator at AAMP, [[Shantrelle P. Lewis]] witnessed a lack of young adult visitors. Following in the tradition of other arts and cultural organizations, Lewis developed a plan to attract a younger demographic that could inject a new energy into the museum.  YFS held its inaugural event, Soul Simpatico, in October 2005, and within a year it had brought in 100 new members to AAMP.

As the organization grew, it became apparent that similar institutions in Philadelphia needed innovative ways to engage young adults looking for alternatives to the conventional nightlife scene of clubs and bars. In January 2007, YFS incorporated as a Pennsylvania non-profit organization and secured 501(c)3 status by June of the same year. Over the next two years, YFS partnered with various cultural organizations in Philadelphia, grew its membership base and held several successful events. YFS also started chapters in New Orleans and New York City, with plans to expand domestically and internationally.

==Vision of YFS==

1) Institution Building: YFS will help to ensure the survival and growth of important institutions. Through the development of a young core of members, supporters and sponsors, YFS will assist in sustaining African Diasporan Institutions for future generations. Each YFS chapter will invite up to 7 institutions in its geographic area to become a partner institution. These institutions will receive direct support and benefits as a partner institution of the Young Friends Society.

2) Cross-cultural association: Over the next decade, YFS will establish chapters in major cities around the [[African Diaspora]]. This will serve as a link between the various people and cultures that exist within the African World. It serves to educate people about the similarities and variations of people of African descent. Chapters will be established in the [[United States|U.S.]], [[Caribbean]], [[South America]], [[Europe]] and the Continent of [[Africa]].

3) Individual Support: YFS serves as a major catalyst for leadership development and interaction amongst like-minded individuals who are passionate about achieving their own unique potential and developing a global society. Unlike other networking forums that tend to serve individuals from a narrow demographic, YFS will bridge positive young people from diverse socio-economic, political, cultural, intellectual and religious backgrounds to support culture. In the process, it will also provide support for its members and their respective endeavors.

'''''Three Flags''''' is a 1958 painting by American artist [[Jasper Johns]].

The work comprises three canvases [[Encaustic painting|painted with hot wax]]. The three canvases form a tiered arrangement, with each canvas approximately 25% smaller than the one below, thereby creating a three-dimensional work. Each canvas is painted to resemble [[Flag of the United States#Historical progression of designs|the version of the United States flag]] that was in use at the time the work was painted, with 48 white stars in a blue canton on a field of thirteen alternating red and white stripes. Each flag is rendered with the approximately correct colors and proportions, as defined by [[Title 4 of the United States Code]].

In a sense, the perspective is reversed, with the smaller paintings projecting out towards the viewer. Only the topmost smallest painting is fully visible; the two behind are only partially visible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorkartworld.com/commentary/JasperJohnsThreeFlags.html NewYorkArtWorld.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was acquired by the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] in [[New York City]] for $1 million in 1980, to celebrate its 50th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;http://whitney.org/Collection/JasperJohns/8032&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lKV4ZNgdFAIC&amp;pg=PA203 American Culture in The 1950s], Martin Halliwell, p.203-205&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tucking''' is a technique whereby an individual hides the [[wikt:Thesaurus:male crotch bulge|crotch bulge]] of the penis and testicles so that they are not conspicuous through clothing.

The practice is most commonly employed by [[transgender women]] in order to [[Methods of passing as female|pass as female]], as well as [[cisgender]] men that do [[Drag queen|drag]]. There are fertility-related side-effects to tucking, such as a reduced sperm count.&lt;ref&gt;Ducheny, Kelly M., and Randall D. Ehrbar. "Family creation options for transgender and gender nonconforming people." Psychology of Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity 3.2 (2016): 173&lt;/ref&gt; Some types of clothing, such as gaffs and bloxers are purposefully designed to inadvertently conceal the male crotch bulge.

== Methods ==
One method of tucking involves pulling the penis backwards in between the legs while simultaneously pushing the testicles up into the [[inguinal canal]].&lt;ref&gt;Pyne, Jake. "Unsuitable bodies: Trans people and cisnormativity in shelter services." Canadian Social Work Review/Revue canadienne de service social 28.1 (2011): 129-137&lt;/ref&gt; In order to secure this position in place, some trans women may use especially tight undergarments and a leotard that has a strap.&lt;ref&gt;Filippo, Maria San. "Female Trouble: Representing Transwomen in The Danish Girl and The New Girlfriend." Journal of Bisexuality 16.3 (2016): 403-407.&lt;/ref&gt; Another practice is the flattening or binding by using tape to fasten the genitalia along the perineum and if possible in between the buttocks. There are also improvised or home-made contrivances whereby an elastic waistband is cut off from an existing garment and then a pouch placed along the middle to then be pulled up.&lt;ref&gt;Conard, L. A. E. "Supporting and caring for transgender and gender nonconforming youth in the urology practice." Journal of Pediatric Urology (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Man|male]] [[cross-dresser]]s and pre- and non-op transgender women use purpose-made [[Panties|panty]]-like [[clothing|garment]]s, often called '''gaffs''', that serve to hide the genitalia and provide a feminine flat and smooth [[Groin|crotch]] area.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://library.transgenderzone.com/?page_id=114 Penis - methods of concealment and obtaining a 'flat-look' for pre-op  male-to-female transgender people]," Samantha Johnson, Transgender Zone&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other ==
The practice of tucking is also observed among cisgender men for reasons other than appearing female, done in different manners.&lt;ref&gt;Willson, Jacki, and Nicola McCartney. "A look at ‘fishy drag’and androgynous fashion: Exploring the border spaces beyond gender-normative deviance for the straight, cisgendered woman." Critical Studies in Fashion &amp; Beauty 8.1 (2017): 99-122&lt;/ref&gt; Some men do it because they feel embarrassment, while others do it to hide an erection&lt;ref&gt;http://www.health24.com/Medical/Erectile-dysfunction/News/New-erection-hiding-underwear-unveiled-20141112&lt;/ref&gt;, to desexualize themselves out of a sense of prudishness or [[phallophobia]]&lt;ref&gt;Shawver, Lois. "Sexual Modesty, the Etiquette of Disregard, and the Question of Gays and Lesbians in the Military." Out in force: Sexual orientation and the military (1996): 226&lt;/ref&gt; or because the bulge is prominent at an inappropriate moment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bustle.com/articles/88760-10-weird-things-about-having-an-erection-according-to-guys-because-you-can-wiggle-it&lt;/ref&gt; Methods of tucking include placing the penis behind the waistband sometimes colloquially referred to as ''uptuck''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefrisky.com/2015-07-15/get-the-boner-prone-man-in-your-life-bloxers-never-be-embarrassed-again/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://uproxx.com/webculture/waistband-boner-trick-uptuck/&lt;/ref&gt; while some men may wear purposefully designed compressing underwear.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/sex/news/a36443/boner-blocking-boxers/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefrisky.com/2015-07-15/get-the-boner-prone-man-in-your-life-bloxers-never-be-embarrassed-again/&lt;/ref&gt; Variations of tucking may be used by macrophallic men when they perceive their crotch bulge to have an obscene appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Lever, Janet, David A. Frederick, and Letitia Anne Peplau. "Does size matter? Men's and women's views on penis size across the lifespan." Psychology of Men &amp; Masculinity 7.3 (2006): 129&lt;/ref&gt; There are some types of [[boxer shorts]] and [[boxer briefs]] that are designed to conceal the male crotch bulge, such as bloxers.&lt;ref&gt;Blanco, F. "revealing myself: a phenomenological approach to my underwear choices through the years." Critical Studies in Men's Fashion 1.2 (2014): 117-131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/bloxer-boxers-boners_us_55a51189e4b0a47ac15d5548&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Women in Music''''' was an [[United States|American]] newsletter founded in July 1935 by its publisher and editor, [[Frédérique Petrides]], then the conductor of the [[Orchestrette Classique]] &amp;ndash; an orchestra based in New York made-up of all women musicians. The publication ran until December 1940. The thirty-seven [[Extant literature|extant issues]] were reprinted in the 1991 book by Jan Bell Groh, ''Evening the Score: Women in Music and the Legacy of Frédérique Petrides''. The newsletter title ''Women in Music'' was coined in 1935 by Petrides's husband, journalist, [[West Side Orchestral Concerts#Publicist and manager, Peter Petrides|Peter Petrides]] to encapsulate the gist of its contents.&lt;ref&gt;Groh (1991), p.&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Frédérique Petrides Papers''&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
''Women in Music'' was founded in the summer of 1935 for the purpose of enlightening the public with little-known historical facts and current developments pertaining to women conductors, composers, instrumentalists, singers and women-led orchestras. Its scope was not limited to contemporary musicians &amp;ndash; it chronicled the activities of women musicians from [[Ancient Egypt]]ian times to the then present.

The publication was sent free-of-charge to newspaper and magazine editors, libraries, music schools, institutions, and individuals in New York and elsewhere. The publication had a circulation of over 2,500.&lt;ref&gt;LePage (1983), pp.&amp;nbsp;203&amp;ndash;204&lt;/ref&gt;

Major print media, including music journals, general magazines, and newspapers have cited ''Women in Music'' as a prime source for opinions, facts, and quotes. Some of the newspapers include ''[[The New York Times]]; [[The New York Sun]]; [[New York World-Telegram]]; [[New York Daily News]]; [[New York Post]]; [[The Baltimore Sun]]; [[Chicago Tribune]]; [[The San Diego Union-Tribune|San Diego Union]]; [[Los Angeles Times]]; [[Press-Telegram]]; [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', and publications that drew articles from ''[[Everybody's Weekly]]'' syndication.&lt;ref&gt;Groh (1991), p.&amp;nbsp;121&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The ''Women in Music'' newsletters are the primary source for research done by musicologists on women in music." &amp;mdash; Adrienne Fried Block, PhD (1921–2009), musicologist and choral director&lt;ref&gt;[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/author/fried-block Musicologist and choral director Adrienne Block, PhD], ''{{linktext|née}}'' Fried (1921–2009) (1992); Petrides family letters and papers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
