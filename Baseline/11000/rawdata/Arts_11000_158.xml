The cinema releases of 1935 were highly representative of the [[Classical Hollywood cinema#The golden age|early Golden Age]] period of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]. This period was punctuated by performances from [[Judy Garland]], [[Clark Gable]] and [[Shirley Temple]]. A significant number of productions also originated in the UK film industry. It was also a period notable in Soviet Russia for the increasing amount of state control exercised over their film industry.

==Events==
* February 23 - [[Gene Autry]] stars as himself as the Singing Cowboy in the serial ''[[The Phantom Empire]]''.  He would later be voted the number one [[Western (genre)|Western]] star from 1937 to 1942.
* February 27 - Seven-year-old [[Shirley Temple]] wins the first special [[Academy Juvenile Award]].
* March - The [[Bantu Educational Kinema Experiment]] is started in order to educate the [[Bantu peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Notcutt, L. A. |author2=Latham, G. C. |title=The African and the Cinema: An Account of the Work of the Bantu Educational Cinema Experiment during the Period March 1935 to May 1937|location=London|publisher=Edinburgh House Press|year=1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* May - Formation of [[Republic Pictures]] following merger of smaller companies including [[Monogram Pictures]], [[Mascot Pictures]], [[Liberty Pictures]] and [[Majestic Pictures]].
* May 31 - [[Fox Film]] and [[Twentieth Century Pictures]] merge to form [[20th Century Fox]].
* August 15 - [[Will Rogers]] who the previous year was voted the [[Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll|Top Money Making Star]] dies in a plane crash.
* August 25 - [[William Boyd (actor)|William Boyd]] appears in his first of 66 films as [[Hopalong Cassidy]] in ''[[Hop-Along Cassidy]]''.

* November 30 - The [[List of British films of 1935|British]]-made film ''[[Scrooge (1935 film)|Scrooge]]'', the first all-talking film version of [[Charles Dickens]]' novel ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', opens in the U.S. after its U.K. release on November 26. [[Seymour Hicks]] plays [[Ebenezer Scrooge]], a role he has played onstage hundreds of times. The film is criticized by some for not showing all of the ghosts physically, and quickly fades into obscurity. Widespread interest does not surface until the film is shown on [[television]] in the 1980s, in very shabby-looking prints. It is eventually restored on [[DVD]].

[[File:Dreikoenigsaltar Verkundigung.jpg|thumb|450px|''Annunciation'', 48.25 x 67.5in, [[Wallraf-Richartz-Museum]], Cologne]]

'''''Annunciation''''' (or '''''The Virgin Mary''''') is a [[panel painting]] by the German artist [[Stefan Lochner]], the panels were probably conceived as outer wing for a lost altarpiece. It shows the virgin, rather conventionally receiving the voice of the [[holy spirit]], who hovers above her in the form of a dove. A vase behind her holds a [[lily]]. Her white clothes and the flower represent her virginity.&lt;ref&gt;Wellesz, 7&lt;/ref&gt; It seems influenced by similar panels found in [[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]''.

'''''Boating on the River Epte''''' (also known as '''''The Canoe on the Epte''''') is an 1890 [[oil painting]] by [[France|French]] [[impressionist]] artist [[Claude Monet]]. It is currently housed at the [[São Paulo Museum of Art]].

Between 1887 and 1890 Monet concerned himself with portraying scenes from the River [[Epte]], which bathed this property at [[Giverny]]. The sisters [[Suzanne Hoschedé|Suzanne]] and [[Blanche Hoschedé Monet|Blanche Hoschedé]] posed for this series of pictures, their late father being banker [[Ernest Hoschedé]], a patron of the arts and collector of [[Monet]], and their mother, [[Alice Hoschedé|Alice]], who became Monet’s second wife. This series began with ''La Barque Rose'' (private collection) and also worthy of mention are canvases ''La Barque à Giverny'' ([[Musée d'Orsay]], [[Paris]]) and ''En Barque'' ([[National Museum of Western Art]], [[Tokyo]]). The [[São Paulo Museum of Art]] picture, which also has a preparatory study, was mentioned by the artist himself on a letter to critic and friend Geffroy, dated June 22, 1890: “I am again vexed by things that are impossible to do: water with undulating vegetation on the bottom”.&lt;ref name="LOBELLO"&gt;Lobello, 2008, pp. 256-257.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact one of the more singular characteristics of ''The Canoe on the Epte'' in the Monet context is the proximity of the water, which assumes at the lower part of the composition an almost tactile reality, as if the painter for once did not want to depict the luminous reflections of its surface, but its depth. Although it belongs to a series, the masp work is in this particular a unique case. [[Monet]] here announces materiality, and it is necessary to remember that this new visual dimension of water will only be obtained again over thirty years later in his paintings of the 1918-1924 period. His friendship with photographer Nadar and his genuine interest in photography explain the framing of the composition as well as the out-of-focus effect produced by the movement of the boat on the water to be seen in the Hoschedé sisters. In addition, a possible source of the [[São Paulo Museum of Art]] composition, as has been detected, is the [[Suzuki Harunobu|Harunobu]] engraving, titled ''Woman Collecting Lotus Flowers''.&lt;ref name="LOBELLO" /&gt;

'''Calvert Richard Jones''' (4 December 1804 &amp;ndash; 7 November 1877), was a [[Wales|Welsh]] mathematician and painter, best known for his seascapes.

==Life and work==
Jones belonged to a wealthy [[Swansea]] family. He was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and  [[Oriel College, Oxford]], and was rector of [[Loughor]]. A friend of both [[John Dillwyn Llewelyn]] and [[Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot]], and thus moved in the same circles as [[Henry Fox Talbot]]. Jones is credited with having taken the first photograph in Wales, a [[daguerrotype]] of [[Margam Castle]], in 1841, but he did not take up photography as a regular occupation. During the 1840s and 1850s, however, he took many photographs of the Swansea area, and travelled with his camera in France and Italy. He also developed his own technique for taking [[Panoramic photography|panoramic photographs]] by overlapping images.

In 1847 he inherited the Heathfield estate in Swansea, which he developed, naming Mansel Street (which still stands) after his brother. In 1853, he went to live in [[Brussels]], later returning to Britain and settling in [[Bath, England]]. He died in Bath, but was buried in Swansea, at St Mary's Church; the grave was destroyed during World War II.

The '''Centennial Honors for the Arts''',(Gawad Sentenaryo para sa Sining) is an award given by the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]] and the Philippine Centennial Commission to honor the outstanding Filipino who have contributed in building the nation though Arts and Culture in the last 100 years and it coincide with the 100 years of Philippine Independence.  The awardees were chosen among the hundreds of nominees in different art fields like painting, sculpture, literature, theater, dance, film, architecture, and other arts. In the interest of painting a more complete picture of the development of Filipino culture, the CCP also decided to honor outstanding art patrons, cultural administrators, critics, and researchers. No distinctions were drawn between the fine arts, traditional folk art and popular art.  The CCP also decided not to include the [[Philippine National Artist]]s for they already received the country's highest honors for the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pelikulaatbp.blogspot.com/2012/07/cultural-heroes-ccps-centennial-honors.htmll|title=CULTURAL HEROES: THE CCP'S CENTENNIAL HONORS FOR THE ARTS (Inquirer Sunday Magazine, January 17, 1999) |accessdate=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection==
Selection of who will be part of the accolade  took a painstaking six-month process of research, study and debate for the selection committee composed of scholars, critics, curators, and artists.  All 65 selection committee members were all experts in their respective fields.  The initial screening came up with nearly 300 names, which were later boiled down to the final 100. This award is primarily to identify people whose contributions helped shape the nation, although they must have achieved some level of excellence in order to be as influential and trend-setting as they were.

==Awarding Ceremony==
The [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]] gave out the Centennial Honors for the Arts on February 2, 1999.  Honorees received a gold medallion designed by Roberto Feleo in the shape of a palm leaf, which can also be seen as a comet, symbolizing their trailblazing efforts

'''''Chew Chew Baby''''' is a Harveytoon banned short in the [[Noveltoons|Noveltoon]] series made by [[Famous Studios]] for release in 1958. It was directed by [[Isadore Sparber]] from a story by [[Irving Spector]]. [[Jackson Beck]] and [[Jack Mercer]] provide uncredited voices. [[Cannibalism]] is the theme of this film, in which seven characters are attacked (six get swallowed) by a [[pygmy]] after he tracks a tourist to [[Cincinnati]].

This cartoon was syndicated to television several years after it was released to theaters. It appeared on children's programs until protests about its violence induced station managers to keep it off the air. It has since achieved [[cult classic]] status.

This film shows a strong [[Tex Avery]] influence, and copies Avery's [[blood transfusion]] gag from ''[[Crazy Mixed Up Pup]]''.

{{confuse|origami}}

'''Chinese knotting''' ({{zh|c=中国结|p=Zhōngguó jié}}) is a decorative handicraft art that began as a form of [[Chinese folk art]] in the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279 CE) in [[China]].  The technique was later popularized in the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]) and spread to Japan and Korea.  The art is also referred to as "Chinese traditional decorative knots".&lt;ref name="Chang"&gt;Zonglin Chang and Xukui Li, ''Aspect of Chinese culture'', 2006.  中国文化导读. 清华大学出版社 publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; In other cultures, it is known as "decorative knots".

Chinese knots are usually [[lanyard]] type arrangements where two cords enter from the top of the knot and two cords leave from the bottom. The knots are usually double-layered and [[symmetrical]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chineseknotting.org/ www.chineseknotting.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:Chinese knot.JPG|thumb|A Chinese knot]]

[[Archaeological]] studies indicate that the art of tying knots dates back to [[prehistoric]] times. Recent discoveries include 100,000-year-old [[bone needle]]s used for [[sewing]] and [[Bodkin needle|bodkin]]s, which were used to untie [[knot]]s. However, due to the delicate nature of the medium, few examples of prehistoric Chinese knotting exist today. Some of the earliest evidence of knotting have been preserved on bronze vessels of the [[Warring States period]] (481&amp;ndash;221 BCE), [[Buddhist]] carvings of the [[Northern Dynasties]] period (317&amp;ndash;581) and on silk paintings during the [[Western Han]] period (206 BCE&amp;ndash;6 CE).

Further references to knotting have also been found in literature, poetry and the private letters of some of the most famous rulers of [[China]]. In the 18th century, one novel that talked extensively about the art was ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Lydia.  [2003] (2003).  Chinese Knotting: Creative Designs that are Easy and Fun. Tuttle Publishing.  {{ISBN|0-8048-3399-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of knot tying continued to steadily evolve over the course of thousands of years with the development of more sophisticated techniques and increasingly intricate woven patterns. During the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644&amp;ndash;1911) knotting finally broke from its pure [[folklore]] status, becoming an acceptable art form in Chinese society and reached the pinnacle of its success. Knotting continued to flourish up until about the end of imperial China and the founding of the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Republic of China]] in 1911 when China began its [[modernization]] period.&lt;ref name="Chang" /&gt; From 1912 to the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]] in 1976, the art of Chinese knotting was almost lost.&lt;ref name="Chang" /&gt;

==Regional==
===China===

Historically knotwork is divided into cords and knots. In the [[dynasties in Chinese history|dynastic periods]], a certain number of craftsmen were stationed in the court and outside the court to produce cords and knots in order to meet the increasing demand for them at various places of the court. Cord, knot and [[tassel]]s were made separated and combined later.

Around the times of Chinese new year festival, you still can see Chinese knot decorations hanging on walls, doors of homes and as shop decorations to add some festival feel. Usually, these decorations are in red color, which traditional Chinese regards it as a color of "luck".

===Japan===
With greater emphasis on the [[kumihimo|braids]] that are used to create the knots, Japanese knotting (also known as ''hanamusubi'') tends to focus on individual knots.

===Korea===
In [[Korea]], decorative knotwork is known as ''maedeup'' (매듭), often called ''Korean knotwork'' or ''Korean knots''. The origins of Maedeup date back to the Three Kingdoms of Korea in the first century CE. Maedeup articles were first used at religious ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Rensburg"&gt;J. Van Rensburg, Elsabe, Knot Another!, Bangkok: Bleho Media, 2009. {{Listed Invalid ISBN|6119020403}} {{page needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by Chinese knotwork, a wall painting found in [[Anak]], [[Hwanghae Province]], now in [[North Korea]], dated 357 CE, indicates that the work was flourishing in [[silk]] at that time. Decorative cording was used on silk dresses, to ornament swords, to hang personal items from belts for the aristocracy, in rituals, where it continues now in contemporary wedding ceremonies. Korean knotwork is differentiated from [[Korean embroidery]]. Maedeup is still a commonly practiced traditional art, especially amongst the older generations. 

The most basic knot in Maedeup is called the ''Dorae'' or ''double connection knot''. The Dorae knot is used at the start and end of most knot projects. There are approximately 33 basic Korean knots which vary according to the region they come from.&lt;ref name="Rensburg"/&gt; 
The Bong Sool tassel is noteworthy as the most representative work familiar to Westerners, and often purchased as souvenirs for [[macramé]]-style wall-hangings.

Lydia Chen lists eleven basic types of Chinese decorative knotwork in her first book. More complex knots are then constructed from repeating or combining basic knots. They are: 

{|class="wikitable"
! width=25% | Name
! width=25% | Alternate names
|-
|Cloverleaf knot || Four-flower knot, dragonfly knot, ginger knot (Korean)
|-
|Round brocade knot || Six-flower knot
|-
|[[Chinese button knot]] || Knife Lanyard knot, Bosun Whistle knot
|-
|Double connection knot || [[Matthew Walker knot]]
|-
|Double coin knot || [[Carrick Bend]], Josephine knot
|-
|Sauvastika knot || Agemaki (Japanese)

|Plafond knot 天花板結|| Spectacle/glasses knot (Korean), caisson ceiling knot
|-
|Pan Chang knot 盤長結|| Coil knot, temple knot, [[Endless knot]], Chrysanthemum knot (Korean), 2x2 mystic knot
|-
|Good luck knot ||
|}

One major characteristic of decorative knotwork is that all the knots are tied using one piece of [[yarn|thread]], which is usually about one meter in length. However, finished knots look identical from both the front and back. They can come in a variety of colors such as; gold, green, blue or black, though the most commonly used color is [[red]]. This is because it symbolizes good luck and prosperity. 

There are many different shapes of Chinese knots, the most common being [[Butterfly|butterflies]], flowers, birds, [[Chinese dragon|dragons]], [[fish]], and even [[shoes]]. Culturally they were expected to ward off evil spirits similar to [[bagua (concept)|bagua mirrors]] or act as good-luck charms for [[Chinese marriage]]s.

[[File:AmbientLED.png|thumb|300px|right|Color rendering index shown as Color Accuracy.]]
A '''color rendering index''' ('''CRI''') is a quantitative measure of the ability of a [[light source]] to reveal the [[color]]s of various objects faithfully in comparison with an ideal or natural light source. Light sources with a high CRI are desirable in color-critical applications such as [[neonatal]] care and art restoration. It is defined by the [[International Commission on Illumination]] (CIE) as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Color rendering''': Effect of an illuminant on the color appearance of objects by conscious or subconscious comparison with their color appearance under a reference illuminant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/17-4-89.html|title=CIE 17.4-1987 International Lighting Vocabulary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The CRI of a light source does not indicate the apparent color of the light source; that information is given by the [[correlated color temperature]] (CCT). The CRI is determined by the light source's [[spectrum]]. An [[incandescent lamp]] has a continuous spectrum, a [[fluorescent lamp]] has a discrete line spectrum; the incandescent lamp has the higher CRI.

The value often quoted as "CRI" on commercially available lighting products is properly called the CIE R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; value, "CRI" being a general term and CIE R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; being the international standard color rendering index.

Numerically, the highest possible CIE R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; value is 100 and would only be given to a source identical to standardized daylight or a [[black body]] (incandescent lamps are effectively black bodies), dropping to negative values for some light sources. [[Low-pressure sodium light]]ing has negative CRI; fluorescent lights range from about 50 for the basic types, up to about 98 for the best multi-phosphor type. Typical LEDs have about 80+ CRI, while some manufacturers claim that their LEDs have achieved up to 98 CRI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ledengin.com/files/products/LZC/LZC-00GW00.pdf|title=LZC-00GW00 Data Sheet|last=|first=|date=March 16, 2015|website=ledengin.com|publisher=LED ENGIN|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CIE R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'s ability to predict color appearance has been criticized in favor of measures based on [[color appearance model]]s, such as [[CIECAM02]] and for [[daylight]] simulators, the CIE [[Metamerism Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=János|last1=Schanda|first2=Norbert|last2=Sándor|journal=Lighting Research and Technology|volume=38|issue=3|title=Visual colour rendering based on colour difference evaluations |year=2005|pages=225–239|doi=10.1191/1365782806lrt168oa}}.

&lt;/ref&gt; A newer version of the CRI, R96, has been developed, but it has not replaced the better-known R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; general color rendering index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schanda|first1=Janos|title=Colorimetry: Understanding the CIE System|date=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780470175620|pages=212–213|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uZadszSGe9MC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=r96+%22color+rendering%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBkoPl-LjRAhVpyVQKHQM2AFkQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=r96%20%22color%20rendering%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Researchers use daylight as the benchmark to which to compare color rendering of electric lights.  In 1948, daylight was described as the ideal source of illumination for good color rendering because "it (daylight) displays (1) a great variety of colours, (2) makes it easy to distinguish slight shades of colour, and (3) the colours of objects around us obviously look natural."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=P. J. Bouma|year=1948|title=''Physical aspects of colour; an introduction to the scientific study of colour stimuli and colour sensations''|publisher=(Eindhoven: Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken (Philips Industries) Technical and Scientific Literature Dept.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the middle of the 20th century, color scientists took an interest in assessing the ability of [[artificial light]]s to accurately reproduce colors. European researchers attempted to describe illuminants by measuring the [[spectral power distribution]] (SPD) in "representative" spectral bands, whereas their North American counterparts studied the [[colorimetric]] effect of the illuminants on reference objects.&lt;ref&gt;American approach is expounded in {{harvtxt|Nickerson|1960}}, and the European approach in {{harvtxt|Barnes|1957}}, and {{harvtxt|Crawford|1959}}. See {{harvtxt|Schanda|Sándor|2003}} for a historical overview.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Commission on Illumination|CIE]] assembled a committee to study the matter and accepted the proposal to use the latter approach, which has the virtue of not needing [[spectrophotometry]], with a set of [[Munsell color system|Munsell]] samples. Eight samples of varying hue would be alternately lit with two illuminants, and the color appearance compared. Since no color appearance model existed at the time, it was decided to base the evaluation on color differences in a suitable color space, [[CIE 1964 color space|CIEUVW]]. In 1931, the CIE adopted the first formal system of colorimetry, which is based on the trichromatic nature of the [[human visual system]].&lt;ref name="Color rendering: Beyond pride and prejudice - Rea - 2010 - Color Research &amp;amp; Application - Wiley Online Library" &gt;Rea, M.S., and Freyssinier, J.P.

Deng, and R. Wolsey. 2004. NLPIP Lighting Answers: Light Sources and Color. Troy, NY: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; National Lighting Product Information Program.

To deal with the problem of having to compare light sources of different correlated color temperatures (CCT), the CIE settled on using a reference [[black body]] with the same color temperature for lamps with a CCT of under 5000&amp;nbsp;K, or a phase of CIE [[standard illuminant]] D (daylight) otherwise. This presented a continuous range of color temperatures to choose a reference from. Any chromaticity difference between the source and reference illuminants were to be abridged with a von Kries-type [[chromatic adaptation transform]].

==Test method==

The CRI is calculated by comparing the color rendering of the test source to that of a "perfect" source, which is a black body radiator for sources with correlated color temperatures under 5000&amp;nbsp;K, and a phase of daylight otherwise (e.g., [[CIE Standard Illuminant D65|D65]]). [[Chromatic adaptation]] should be performed so that like quantities are compared.  The ''Test Method'' (also called ''Test Sample Method'' or ''Test Color Method'') needs only [[colorimetric]], rather than [[spectrophotometric]], information.&lt;ref name="CIE1995"&gt;{{citation

# Using the [[CIE 1931 color space#CIE standard observer|2° standard observer]], find the [[chromaticity]] co-ordinates of the test source in the [[CIE 1960 color space]].&lt;ref&gt;Note that when CRI was designed in 1965, the most perceptually uniform chromaticity space was the [[CIE 1960 color space|CIE 1960 UCS]], the [[CIELUV|CIE 1976 UCS]] not yet having been invented.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Determine the [[correlated color temperature]] (CCT) of the test source by finding the closest point to the [[Planckian locus]] on the (''u'',''v'') chromaticity diagram.
# If the test source has a CCT&lt;5000&amp;nbsp;K, use a black body for reference, otherwise use CIE [[standard illuminant]] D. Both sources should have the same CCT.
# Ensure that the chromaticity distance (DC) of the test source to the Planckian locus is under 5.4×10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; in the CIE 1960 UCS. This ensures the meaningfulness of the result, as the CRI is only defined for light sources that are approximately white.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|CIE|1995}}, [http://resodance.com/ali/CRI_prob.html Section 5.3: Tolerance for reference illuminant]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;DC={\Delta}_{uv}=\sqrt{(u_r-u_t)^2+(v_r-v_t)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Today's fluorescent "[[full-spectrum light]]s" boast CRIs approaching 100; e.g, [http://www.truesun.com/philips_TL950.php Philips TL950] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012085113/http://www.truesun.com/philips_TL950.php |date=2007-10-12 }} or {{patent|EP|1184893}}. {{harvtxt|Thornton|1972}} compares older products; {{harvtxt|Guo|Houser|2004}} compares newer ones.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It appeared that &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt; could be negative (&lt;math&gt;\Delta E_i&lt;/math&gt; ≥ 22), and this was indeed calculated for some lamp test colors, especially TCS9 (strong red).&lt;/ref&gt;
# Find the general CRI (R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) by calculating the [[arithmetic mean]] of the special CRIs.

Note that the last three steps are equivalent to finding the mean [[color difference]], &lt;math&gt;\Delta \bar{E}_{UVW}&lt;/math&gt; and using that to calculate &lt;math&gt;R_a&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;R_a=100-4.6 \Delta \bar{E}_{UVW}&lt;/math&gt;

===Chromatic adaptation===
[[File:CIE CRI TCS under FL4.svg|thumb|Chromatic adaptation of TCSs lit by CIE FL4 (short, black vectors, to indicate before and after) to a black body of 2940 K (cyan circles).]]

{{harvtxt|CIE|1995}} uses this von Kries chromatic transform equation to find the [[corresponding color]] (''u''&lt;sub&gt;''c'',''i''&lt;/sub&gt;,''v''&lt;sub&gt;''c'',''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) for each sample. The mixed subscripts (''t'',''i'') refer to the [[inner product]] of the test illuminant spectrum and the spectral reflexivity of sample ''i'':

&lt;math&gt;u_{c,i}=\frac{10.872+0.404 (c_r/c_t) c_{t,i} - 4 (d_r/d_t) d_{t,i}}{16.518+1.481 (c_r/c_t) c_{t,i} - (d_r/d_t) d_{t,i}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v_{c,i}=\frac{5.520}{16.518+1.481 (c_r/c_t) c_{t,i} - (d_r/d_t) d_{t,i}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c=\left(4.0-u-10.0v \right)/v&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;d=\left(1.708v-1.481u+0.404\right)/v&lt;/math&gt;

where subscripts ''r'' and ''t'' refer to reference and test light sources, respectively.

As specified in {{harvtxt|CIE|1995}}, the original test color samples (TCS) are taken from an early edition of the [[Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test|Munsell]] Atlas. The first eight samples, a subset of the eighteen proposed in {{harvtxt|Nickerson|1960}}, are relatively low saturated colors and are evenly distributed over the complete range of hues.&lt;ref&gt;See the CIE 1960 UCS diagram towards the end of the [[#Example|Example]] section.&lt;/ref&gt; These eight samples are employed to calculate the general color rendering index &lt;math&gt;R_a&lt;/math&gt;. The last six samples provide supplementary information about the color rendering properties of the light source; the first four for high saturation, and the last two as representatives of well-known objects. The reflectance spectra of these samples may be found in {{harvtxt|CIE|2004}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://photometry.kriss.re.kr/wiki/img_auth.php/4/47/CIE_TCS.csv TCS spectra in CSV form] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211042805/http://photometry.kriss.re.kr/wiki/img_auth.php/4/47/CIE_TCS.csv |date=2009-02-11 }}, Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science.&lt;/ref&gt; and their approximate Munsell notations are listed aside.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cis.rit.edu/mcsl/online/munsell.php Munsell Renotation Data], ''Munsell Color Science Laboratory'', [[Rochester Institute of Technology]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==R96&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; method==
[[File:CIE CRI TCS chromaticities.svg|300px|right]]

In the CIE's 1991 Quadrennial Meeting, Technical Committee 1-33 (Color Rendering) was assembled to work on updating the color rendering method, as a result of which the R96&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; method was developed. The committee was dissolved in 1999, releasing {{harvtxt|CIE|1999}}, but no firm recommendations, partly due to disagreements between researchers and manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;"Authors’ response to SA Fotios and
JA Lynes" in {{harvtxt|Schanda|Sándor|2005}}: ''The main message of our investigations is an answer to the lamp industry, who still use the colour rendering index and the lamp efficacy as parameters for optimizing their lamp spectra, and have turned down the work of CIE TC 1-33 by stating that there are not enough visual experiments showing the shortcomings of the CIE colour rendering calculation method.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The R96&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; method has a few distinguishing features:&lt;ref&gt;See "Past research to improve the CRI" in {{harvtxt|Bodrogi|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[#New test color samples|A new set of test color samples]]
* Six reference illuminants: D65, D50, black bodies of 4200 K, 3450 K, 2950 K, and 2700 K.
* A new chromatic adaptation transform: CIECAT94.
* Color difference evaluation in CIELAB.
* Adaptation of all colors to [[CIE Standard Illuminant D65|D65]] (since CIELAB is well-tested under D65).

It is conventional to use the original method; R96&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; should be explicitly mentioned if used.

As discussed in {{harvtxt|Schanda|Sándor|2005}}, {{harvtxt|CIE|1999}} recommends the use of a [[ColorChecker]] chart owing to the obsolescence of the original samples, of which only [[Metamerism (color)|metameric]] matches remain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xrite.com/product_overview.aspx?ID=820&amp;Action=Library X-Rite ColorChecker Chart].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the eight ColorChart samples, two skin tone samples are defined (TCS09&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and TCS10&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;). Accordingly, the updated general CRI is averaged over ten samples, not eight as before. Nevertheless, {{harvtxt|Hung|2002}} has determined that the patches in {{harvtxt|CIE|1995}} give better correlations for any color difference than the ColorChecker chart, whose samples are not equally distributed in a uniform color space.

The CRI can also be theoretically derived from the SPD of the illuminant and samples since physical copies of the original color samples are difficult to find. In this method, care should be taken to use a sampling resolution fine enough to capture spikes in the SPD. The SPDs of the standard test colors are tabulated in 5&amp;nbsp;nm increments {{harvtxt|CIE|2004}}, so it is suggested to use interpolation up to the resolution of the illuminant's spectrophotometry.

Starting with the SPD, let us verify that the CRI of reference illuminant F4 is 51. The first step is to determine the [[tristimulus value]]s using the 1931 standard observer. Calculation of the [[inner product]] of the SPD with the standard observer's color matching functions (CMFs) yields (''X'',''Y'',''Z'')=(109.2,100.0,38.9) (after normalizing for Y=100). From this follow the ''xy'' chromaticity values:

[[Image:CIE 1960 UCS, FL4.svg|thumb|right|200px|The tight isotherms are from 2935K–2945K. FL4 marked with a cross.]]

&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{109.2}{109.2+100.0+38.9}=0.4402&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y=\frac{100}{109.2+100.0+38.9}=0.4031&lt;/math&gt;

The next step is to convert these chromaticities to the [[CIE 1960 color space|CIE 1960 UCS]] in order to be able to determine the CCT:

&lt;math&gt;u=\frac{4 \times 0.4402}{-2 \times 0.4402 + 12 \times 0.4031 + 3}=0.2531&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v=\frac{6 \times 0.4031}{-2 \times 0.4402 + 12 \times 0.4031 + 3}=0.3477&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:CIE illuminant F4 and a blackbody of 2938K.svg|thumb|200px|Relative SPD of FL4 and a black body of equal CCT. Not normalized.]]

Examining the CIE 1960 UCS reveals this point to be closest to 2938&amp;nbsp;K on the Planckian locus, which has a co-ordinate of (0.2528, 0.3484). The distance of the test point to the locus is under the limit (5.4×10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;), so we can continue the procedure, assured of a meaningful result:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} DC&amp;=\sqrt{ (0.2531-0.2528)^2+(0.3477-0.3484)^2 } \\
&amp; =8.12 \times 10^{-4} &lt; 5.4 \times 10^{-3} \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

We can verify the CCT by using [[Color temperature#Approximation|McCamy's approximation algorithm]] to estimate the CCT from the ''xy'' chromaticities:

&lt;math&gt;CCT_{est.} = -449 n^3 + 3525 n^2 - 6823.3 n + 5520.33&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n=\frac{x-0.3320}{y-0.1858}&lt;/math&gt;.

Substituting &lt;math&gt;(x,y)=(0.4402,0.4031)&lt;/math&gt; yields ''n''=0.4979 and CCT&lt;sub&gt;est.&lt;/sub&gt; = 2941&amp;nbsp;K, which is close enough. ([[Color temperature#Robertson's method|Robertson's method]] can be used for greater precision, but we will be content with 2940&amp;nbsp;K in order to replicate published results.) Since 2940&amp;nbsp;&lt; 5000, we select a Planckian radiator of 2940&amp;nbsp;K as the reference illuminant.

The next step is to determine the values of the test color samples under each illuminant in the [[CIE 1964 color space|CIEUVW color space]]. This is done by integrating the product of the CMF with the SPDs of the illuminant and the sample, then converting from CIEXYZ to CIEUVW (with the u,v coordinates of the reference illuminant as white point):

From this we can calculate the color difference between the chromatically adapted samples (labeled "CAT") and those illuminated by the reference. (The Euclidean metric is used to calculate the color difference in CIEUVW.) The special CRI is simply &lt;math&gt;R_i=100-4.6 \Delta E_{UVW}&lt;/math&gt;.

Finally, the general color rendering index is the mean of the special CRIs: 51.

[[File:CIE CRI TCS under FL4.svg|thumb|600px|center|The cyan circles indicate the TCS under the ''reference'' illuminant. The short, black, vectors indicate the TCS under the ''test'' illuminant, before and after chromatic adaptation transformation (CAT). (The vectors are short because the white points are close.) The post-CAT end of the vector lies NW, mirroring the chromaticity vector between the reference and test illuminants.
&lt;br /&gt;
The special CRIs are reflected in the length of the dotted lines linking the chromaticities of the samples under the reference and chromatically adapted test illuminants, respectively. Short distances, as in the case of TCS3, result in a high special CRI (87.9), whereas long distances, as in the case of TCS8, result in a low special CRI (10.4). In simpler terms, TCS3 reproduces better under FL4 than does TCS8 (relative to a black body).]]

A reference source, such as blackbody radiation, is defined as having a CRI of 100. This is why [[incandescent lamp]]s have that rating, as they are, in effect, almost blackbody radiators. The best possible faithfulness to a reference is specified by a CRI of one hundred, while the very poorest is specified by a CRI below zero. A high CRI by itself does not imply a good rendition of color, because the reference itself may have an imbalanced SPD if it has an extreme color temperature.

== Criticism ==

Ohno and others have criticized CRI for not always correlating well with subjective color rendering quality in practice, particularly for light sources with spiky emission spectra such as fluorescent lamps or white [[Light-emitting diode|LED]]s. Another problem is that the CRI is discontinuous at 5000&amp;nbsp;K,&lt;ref&gt;"Authors’ response to SA Fotios and JA Lynes" in {{harvtxt|Schanda|Sándor|2005}}: ''It is quite obvious that just at 5000&amp;nbsp;K, where the reference illuminant has to be changed, the present system shows discontinuity.'&lt;/ref&gt; because the chromaticity of the reference moves from the [[Planckian locus]] to the [[Standard illuminant#Illuminant series D|CIE daylight locus]]. {{harvtxt|Davis|Ohno|2006}} identify several other issues, which they address in their [[Color Quality Scale]] (CQS):

* The color space in which the color distance is calculated (CIEUVW) is obsolete and nonuniform. Use [[CIELAB]] or [[CIELUV]] instead.
* The chromatic adaptation transform used ([[Von Kries transform]]) is inadequate. Use [[CIECAM02#Chromatic adaptation|CMCCAT2000]] or [[CIECAM02|CIECAT02]] instead.
* Calculating the arithmetic mean of the errors diminishes the contribution of any single large deviation. Two light sources with similar CRI may perform significantly differently if one has a particularly low special CRI in a spectral band that is important for the application. Use the [[root mean square deviation]] instead.
* The metric is not perceptual; all errors are equally weighted, whereas humans favor certain errors over others. A color can be more saturated or less saturated without a change in the numerical value of ∆''E''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, while in general a saturated color is experienced as being more attractive.
* A negative CRI is difficult to interpret. Normalize the scale from 0 to 100 using the formula &lt;math&gt;R_{out}=10 \ln \left[\exp(R_{in}/10)+1\right]&lt;/math&gt;
* The CRI cannot be calculated for light sources that do not have a CCT (non-white light).
* Eight samples are not enough since manufacturers can optimize the emission spectra of their lamps to reproduce them faithfully, but otherwise perform poorly. Use more samples (they suggest fifteen for CQS).
* The samples are not saturated enough to pose difficulty for reproduction.
* CRI merely measures the faithfulness of any illuminant to an ideal source with the same CCT, but the ideal source itself may not render colors well if it has an extreme color temperature, due to a lack of energy at either short or long wavelengths (i.e., it may be excessively blue or red). Weight the result by the ratio of the [[gamut]] area of the polygon formed by the fifteen samples in CIELAB for 6500&amp;nbsp;K to the gamut area for the test source. 6500&amp;nbsp;K is chosen for reference since it has a relatively even distribution of energy over the visible spectrum and hence high gamut area. This normalizes the multiplication factor.

Rea and Freyssinier have developed another index, the Gamut Area Index (GAI), in an attempt to improve over the flaws found in the CRI.&lt;ref&gt;Rea, M.S. and Freysinnier-Nova, JP. "Color rendering: A tale of two metrics," Color Research and Application, 33(3), 192-202 (2008). {{doi|10.1002/col.20399}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have shown that the GAI is better than the CRI at predicting color discrimination on standardized Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Tests and that GAI is predictive of color saturation.&lt;ref name="Color rendering: Beyond pride and prejudice - Rea - 2010 - Color Research &amp;amp; Application - Wiley Online Library" /&gt; Proponents of using GAI claim that, when used in conjunction with CRI, this method of evaluating color rendering is preferred by test subjects over light sources that have high values of only one measure. Researchers recommend a lower and an upper limit to GAI. Use of LED technology has called for a new way to evaluate color rendering because of the unique spectrum of light created by these technologies. Preliminary tests have shown that the combination of GAI and CRI used together is a preferred method for evaluating color rendering.&lt;ref&gt;Alliance for Solid-State Illumination Systems and Technologies.

{{harvtxt|Pousset|Obein|Razet|2010}} developed a psychophysical experiment in order to evaluate light quality of LED lightings. It is based on colored samples used in the "Color Quality Scale". Predictions of the CQS and results from visual measurements were compared.

{{harvtxt|CIE|2007}} "reviews the applicability of the CIE color rendering index to white LED light sources based on the results of visual experiments." Chaired by Davis, CIE TC 1-69(C) is currently investigating "new methods for assessing the color rendition properties of white-light sources used for illumination, including solid-state light sources, with the goal of recommending new assessment procedures [...] by March, 2010."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cie.co.at/div1/ActReps/D1ActivityReport08.pdf CIE Activity Report.

For a comprehensive review of alternative color rendering indexes see {{harvtxt|Guo|Houser|2004}}.

{{harvtxt|Smet|2011}} reviewed several alternative quality metrics and compared their performance based on visual data obtained in nine psychophysical experiments. It was found that a geometric mean of the GAI index and the CIE Ra correlated best with naturalness (r=0.85), while a color quality metric based on memory colors (MCRI&lt;ref&gt;Smet KAG, Ryckaert WR, Pointer MR, Deconinck G, Hanselaer P. Colour Appearance Rating of Familiar Real Objects. Colour Research and Application 2011;36(3):192–200.&lt;/ref&gt;) correlated best for preference (r=0.88). The differences in performance of these metrics with the other tested metrics (CIE Ra; CRI-CAM02UCS; CQS; RCRI; GAI; geomean (GAI, CIE Ra); CSA; Judd Flattery; Thornton CPI; MCRI) were found to be statistically significant with p&lt;0.0001.&lt;ref&gt;Smet KAG, Ryckaert WR, Pointer MR, Deconinck G, Hanselaer P.

== Film and video high-CRI LED lighting incompatibility ==

Problems have been encountered attempting to use LED lighting on film and video sets. The color spectra of LED lighting primary colors does not match the expected color wavelength bandpasses of film emulsions and digital sensors. As a result, color rendition can be completely unpredictable in optical prints, transfers to digital media from film (DI's), and video camera recordings. This phenomenon with respect to motion picture film has been documented in an LED lighting evaluation series of tests produced by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] scientific staff.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

 | title = Solid State Lighting Report
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To that end, various other metrics such as the TLCI (television lighting consistency index) have been developed to replace the human observer with a camera observer.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 | url = https://tech.ebu.ch/tlci-2012

A '''cultural subsidy''' is a payment from the government to specific cultural industries to ensure that some public policy purpose in culture (e.g. [[multiculturalism]], [[bilingualism]], minority and languages, and preservation of traditional dance, music, food, art or other practices) are preserved and maintained in society. Cultural subsidies work similarly to other forms of [[subsidies]] such as industrial and consumer subsidies and have similar goals of expansionary economic results and increased utility for their targeted recipients.

'''Implementation:''' Cultural subsidies are distributed in the form of grants and payment from the government to various institutions, groups or citizens who are seen to meaningfully contribute to their society's culture. Some of the most familiar efforts are: free museum entrances for children and seniors, public art instalments, government funding for afterschool art-based programs and government grants to culturally focused non-profits.

A common emphasis for cultural subsidies is the provision of resources for underserved communities or groups, whose cultural background and heritage may be at risk without additional financial support, or who traditionally lack access to mainstream cultural events and participation. For example, the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] states that 40% of their activities support high-poverty neighbourhoods, 36% of their grants are awarded to organisations that serve those with disabilities, in institutions and veterans, while 33% of their grants are awarded to serve low-income audiences.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/NEA_Quick_Facts_v.2.pdf|title=The National Endowment for the Arts|last=|first=|date=26 April 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural Subsidy Implementation in the US'''

The National Council for the Arts was established by US [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Lyndon B. Johnson]] through the National Arts and Cultural Development Act of 1964 and is the US federal program which provides cultural subsidies. Its purpose is to review and recommend applications for grants, funding guidelines and leadership initiatives in the US. to the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts. There are eighteen Presidentially appointed members of the council, with six additional members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] serving two-year, non-voting terms. Members are selected for their extensive knowledge, expertise and interest in the arts as well as outstanding backgrounds in service or recognition within the arts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The annual budget for the National Council for the Arts is set by Congress and currently receives .004% of the total, or 149.8 million USD. 40% of their grant budget is directly received by states via regional arts agencies who distribute the funds, with stipulations that every state and regional partnership allocates a portion of funding for underserved communities. Direct awards to organisations and individuals who apply through the National Endowment for the Arts make up the remaining 60% of their annual budget.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Intended Economic Effects'''

Like other subsidies, cultural subsidies are utilized with the intent to expand economic growth and utility within a specific area. The functionality of cultural subsidies can be seen through typical [[Supply and demand|supply and demand graphs]] like those pictured below.

As prices for arts and culture related items, events and classes increase, the demand for them decreases. On the other hand, as prices increase, the supply also increases as more artists and cultural entities seek gains. Where the two forces of supply and demand meet is the equilibrium point (e&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://artspolicies.org/2011/06/17/modelling-the-economic-impacts-of-cultural-policies/|title=Artspolicies.org|last=|first=|date=26 April 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cultural Sector No Subsidy.png|border|Cultural Sector No Subsidy]]

When cultural subsidies are applied from the demand-side that means they focus on growing the demand from consumers for art and culture related products. This most often is reflected in free or discounted ticket sales for art and culture events and purchases for pieces of art that consumers would otherwise not be able to buy due to budget constraints. The ultimate goal in utilising demand-side cultural subsidies is to increase the demand for art at every price level it is offered. Below, we can see the result is an outward shift of the demand curve to the right, and an increase in both the equilibrium supply ''and'' demand (e&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The difference from P&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to P&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the amount which is compensated by the subsidy, and the total area of from P&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and Q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the cultural sector's revenue. Demand-side subsidies are typically viewed as an effective way to increase both the output of the cultural sector and increase incomes for the providers within it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Cultural Sector Demand Impact.png|border|Cultural Sector Demand Impact]]

Governments can also approach cultural subsidies from the supply-side in an effort to increase the economic power of those who supply cultural products. This allows cultural providers the opportunity to produce and supply more than they would be able to without subsidised assistance. Instead of raising both the price and quantity of cultural products, as the demand-side subsidies do, supply-side subsidies lower price while increasing quantity, as show in the model below. Supply shifts downward, to the right and the new equilibrium moves from e&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Total revenue shifts from the blue rectangle to the red rectangle, which demonstrates an expansion of cultural sector output (Q&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to Q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), but not necessarily an increase in economic growth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Cultural Sector Supply Impact.png|border|Cultural Sector Supply Impact]]

'''Issues facing cultural subsidies'''

As with other sectors reliant on subsidies, the cultural sector is constantly subject to the budget decisions made by the government. In the US, government subsidies for arts and culture have steadily been declining as spending emphasis shifts elsewhere. Cultural providers are forced to turn to state and private philanthropic groups and individuals for greater and greater percentages of their funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cultureforward.org/news/CPAC-Media-Releases/As-threats-to-federal-arts-funding-persist-new-study-demonstrates-vital-role-of-government-funding-to-local-arts-and-culture-nonprofits|title=cultureforward.org|last=|first=|date=26 April 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the current US administration of [[Donald Trump|President Donald Trump]], there have been proposals to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts, the US grant-making organisation responsible for cultural subsidy provision. The main argument behind this comes from the [[Taxation in the United States|private taxation]] of citizens to fund the program. Policymakers in favour of reduced taxes often view cultural subsidies as a non-necessary expense, and one which should be privately, versus publicly funded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/142925/americans-hostile-state-funded-art|title=newrepublic.com|last=|first=|date=26 April 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinions on the importance of cultural subsidies vary widely by each nation, as well as the levels of investment in cultural products by consumers and cultural professions by suppliers. In Australia, there is a current over-supply in the cultural sector which has been supported through supply-side subsidies from the government. This issue, paired with a drastic increase in the number of cultural professionals in the early 2000s, has been blamed for steadily declining salaries for cultural suppliers. Advocates for reform are stressing the importance of demand-side policies in the country as an alternative way to increase artist salary and most importantly, increase demand for the large supply of cultural products available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://culture360.asef.org/magazine/policies-boosting-arts-demand|title=culture360.asef.org|last=|first=|date=26 April 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Deadly Voyage''''' is a 1996 &lt;!--US-UK--&gt; television film directed by [[John Mackenzie (film director)|John Mackenzie]] and written by [[Stuart Urban]]. Produced by Union Pictures and John Goldschmidt's Viva Films for joint distribution to [[BBC Films]] and [[HBO]]. It was first film made by [[HBO Pictures|HBO NYC Productions]] under HBO Pictures banner when HBO Showcase was reconstructed. It tells the true story of [[Kingsley Ofosu]], the sole survivor of a group of nine African [[stowaway]]s discovered aboard the cargo ship ''MC Ruby'' in 1992 and subsequently murdered by that ship's crew. 

==Plot==
Aboard the cargo ship ''MC Ruby'', docked in New York City, six stowaways burst from one of the containers being unloaded.  They flee from the ship, but are apprehended by dock workers and the [[New York Police Department|New York police]]. The ''MC Ruby''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] crew watches the detention with some amusement, but the ship's captain and his [[first mate]], Ion Plesin, are displeased, aware that the [[illegal immigrant]]s will cost the shipping company hundreds of thousands of [[US dollar|dollars]] in fines.  In response, company representative Andreas Vlachos arrives to oversee future operations and warn that the crew will be liable for any more such fines.

Later, the ''MC Ruby'' is docked in [[Ghana]], where dock worker [[Kingsley Ofosu]] plans to some day stow away aboard a cargo ship to pursue a better life for himself and his pregnant wife in the United States. Upon winning a [[lottery]], he decides that the time is right, as he can use the money to get on his feet upon his arrival. Ofosu, his brother and six other men slip aboard the ''MC Ruby'' and hide in its cargo holds. With the ship behind schedule, Plesin has only one hour to conduct a stowaway search prior to departure.  The hasty endeavour fails to turn up Ofosu's group and the ship sails, bound for France, prior to sailing on to New York.

Ofosu's group encounters another stowaway, who had boarded the ship in [[Cameroon]]. The men jovially discuss the vocations they intend to pursue in the United States. Later, their water container breaks, forcing them to leave the cargo area to forage for water. They leave evidence of their presence, which the crew discovers. To prevent Vlachos from learning that the stowaway search had failed, the captain has Plesin assemble a small team to conduct a secret search.

The search finds the stowaways and Plesin discusses the predicament with the captain. Given the illegal immigrant fines, they cannot bring the stowaways into port. However, they also cannot alter course to drop the men off somewhere, as Vlachos would then find out about them. Plesin and his small search team hide the Africans in the ship's anchor hold without food or water.  When they object, they find Plesin unsympathetic to their desire to escape poverty.  He points out that if the stowaways' presence becomes known, he and his men will be fired, and any other jobs they can find in Ukraine will pay even less than the meager wages earned by Ofosu on the docks in Ghana.  Yuri, one of Plesin's men, takes pity and secretly delivers them a little water, but he is powerless to do more. As the stowaways suffer, Ofosu laments that he has led the group to their deaths.

The captain acquiesces to Plesin's plan to kill the stowaways. Plesin's team takes the men from the hold in small groups. The team brings each group to another area, murders the men, and throws their bodies overboard. Yuri tries to stop the massacre, but the others overpower and subdue him. Ofosu and his brother are the last two to be brought out, but they surmise what is about to occur and make a run for it, heading in different directions.  As they do, Plesin's team shoots Ofosu's brother, catches him and throws him overboard as Ofosu watches. Ofosu flees to the main cargo hold to hide and is able to elude further searches for him. While in the cargo hold, Ofosu stashes a picture of himself and his wife inside one of the cocoa sacks.

Plesin's men are concerned about their inability to locate the final stowaway, but they reason that all Western countries despise [[Black people|black]] immigrants and thus no one will be motivated to take action against them. They also expect to be able to secure him upon reaching port when he tries to exit the ship. However, once the ship docks, Ofosu is able to escape to shore and make it to the police before Plesin's men can catch him.

The next day, French authorities board the ''MC Ruby'' to investigate Ofosu's story. Plesin first denies that there had been any stowaway, but the authorities search the ship's hold and find Ofosu's picture in the cocoa sack. Plesin's final play is to acknowledge the killings but to suggest that he and his men had done France a favour by preventing undesirable blacks from entering the country illegally. The police are unimpressed by this rationale and immediately arrest Plesin and his men, along with the captain.

The film ends with Ofosu on the phone with his wife, hearing the cries of his newborn son, whom he pledges to name after his brother. An epilogue notes that the captain and first mate were convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Three other crew members were also convicted and received 20-year sentences, while one crew member was acquitted. Kingsley Ofosu was living in France and hoping to have his wife and child join him.

==Cast==
*[[Omar Epps]] as [[Kingsley Ofosu]]
*[[Joss Ackland]] as the ship's captain
*[[Sean Pertwee]] as Ion Plesin
*[[David Suchet]] as Andreas Vlachos
(US) [[Peace Corps]] volunteers in Ghana were recruited as extras to play the ship's crew members, although many of these scenes do not appear in the final production.

==Production==
When the trial of the crew members made international headlines, multiple film companies approached Ofosu to purchase the rights to his story. He eventually struck a deal with Union Pictures and Viva Films.  The Union Pictures/Viva Films production was to be distributed to and financed by HBO and the BBC.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |last=Davies |first=Nick |date=3 December 2007 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/03/immigration.uk |title=The cruellest voyage |work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The screenplay for ''Deadly Voyage'' was written by [[Stuart Urban]], who used interviews with Ofosu as his primary source material. Urban was also originally slated to direct, but when he took ill, [[John Mackenzie (film director)|John Mackenzie]] was brought in to replace him.  The movie was filmed in England and in [[Ghana]].&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news |date=12 October 1996 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4704975/I-cry-when-I-see-this-film.html |title=I cry when I see this film |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producer John Goldschmidt noted that the Ghana portion of the shoot was particularly challenging, with weather that was extremely hot and humid and multiple crew members coming down with [[malaria]] or [[dysentery]].  There were also many logistical problems, as Ghana lacked an infrastructure conducive to executing [[principal photography]] for a major motion picture.  Goldschmidt said that the original plan had been to film in South Africa, since that country was more "geared up for this sort of thing", being a location often used for major films set in Africa.  However, the decision was made to film in Ghana for the sake of authenticity, and despite the difficulties, Goldschmidt felt that that genuineness shone through in the finished work.&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt;

[[Omar Epps]], the film's star, spoke a bit more positively about his experience in Ghana.  He said that he was able to spend a good deal of time with Ofosu in preparing for the role.  Epps also said that he had learned to speak a little bit of [[Twi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=French |first=Howard W. |date=14 January 1996 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/14/arts/television-into-africa-to-tell-an-unlikely-tale-of-survival.html?pagewanted=all |title=Television: into Afric to tell an unlikely tale of survival |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Ofosu expressed doubt that he had received fair compensation from Union Pictures for the film.  He said that he had received US$67,500, but that that sum had been based on an estimate of the film's total production costs, of which he was to receive 1.5%.  Ofosu claimed he'd never been given an accounting of the final production costs to determine if he was owed more.  He also said that he was to receive 10% of the movie's net profits and, but that he had never seen any payment along those lines.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt; Union Pictures (which had gone bankrupt by that time) co-producer Bradley Adams pointed the finger at HBO and the BBC, saying that he also had never seen any accounting of profits or total budget figures from the two companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Adams |first=Bradley |date=6 December 2007 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/dec/06/bbc.mainsection |title=Letters: What happened after Deadly Voyage |work=[[The Guardian]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Newspaper reviews of ''Deadly Voyage'' were largely positive.  Noting that its depictions of [[man's inhumanity to man]] were somewhat distressing to watch, the ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]'' labelled it an "effective film".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jicha |first=Tom |date=9 June 1996 |title=Hate, death stalk refugees in ship's hold |publisher=''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Daytona Beach News-Journal]]'' called it a "well-crafted drama" made all the more disturbing by the fact that observering Ofosu's true story was much like watching a fictional thriller film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Callea |first= Donna |date=15 June 1996 |title=Deadly Voyage, a chilling film |work=[[The Daytona Beach News-Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Kansas City Star]]'' branded it a "tough, provocative [[docudrama]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Duffy|first= Mike |date=15 June 1996 |title=Deadly Voyage is gritty drama |publisher=[[Kansas City Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'', however, was more critical, offering that the film was "not a great movie" and declaring that most of its characters were "little more than stick figures".  Nonetheless, the paper did see the movie as "nightmarishly harrowing", calling it a "searing descent into human cruelty", and praising the performances of Epps and Pertwee as the film's primary protagonist and antagonist respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Connor |first=John J. |date=14 June 1996 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/14/arts/tv-weekend-9-african-stowaways-and-a-homicidal-crew.html?pagewanted=1 |title=TV Weeknd; 9 African Stowaways And a Homicidal Crew |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dhokra''' ({{lang-or|ଡୋକରା}}, {{lang-bn|ডোকরা}}) (also spelt Dokra) is non&amp;ndash;ferrous metal casting using the [[lost-wax casting]] technique. This sort of metal casting has been used in [[India]] for over 4,000 years and is still used. One of the earliest known lost wax artefacts is the dancing girl of [[Mohenjo-daro]].&lt;ref name=missouri&gt;{{cite web|url =http://anthromuseum.missouri.edu/minigalleries/lostwax/intro.shtml |title = Metal Working in India - Lost Wax Casting |accessdate = 2009-02-08|last = Della Cava  |first = Chiara |work = |publisher = Museum of Anthropology, University of Missouri-Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The product of dhokra artisans are in great demand in domestic and foreign markets because of primitive simplicity, enchanting folk motifs and forceful form. Dhokra horses, elephants, peacocks, owls, religious images, measuring bowls, and lamp caskets etc., are highly appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.infobanc.com/dokra.htm|title =Dokra|accessdate =2009-02-08|last =|first =|work =|publisher =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090130100223/http://infobanc.com/dokra.htm|archivedate =2009-01-30|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lost wax technique for casting of copper based alloys has also been found in [[China]], [[Egypt]], [[Malaysia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Central America]], and other places.

==The process==
There are two main processes of lost wax casting: solid casting and hollow casting. While the former is predominant in the [[South India|south of India]] the latter is more common in Central and [[East India|Eastern India]]. Solid casting does not use a clay [[core (manufacturing)|core]] but instead a solid piece of wax to create the mould; hollow casting is the more traditional method and uses the clay core.&lt;ref name=missouri/&gt;

The first task in the lost wax hollow casting process consists of developing a clay core which is roughly the shape of the final cast image. Next, the clay core is covered by a layer of wax composed of pure [[beeswax]], [[resin]] from the tree ''Damara orientalis'', and [[List of vegetable oils#Nut oils|nut oil]]. The wax is then shaped and carved in all its finer details of design and decorations. It is then covered with layers of clay, which takes the negative form of the wax on the inside, thus becoming a mould for the metal that will be poured inside it. Drain ducts are left for the wax, which melts away when the clay is cooked. The wax is then replaced by the molten metal, often using brass scrap as basic raw material. The liquid metal poured in hardens between the core and the inner surface of the mould. The metal fills the mould and takes the same shape as the wax. The outer layer of clay is then chipped off and the metal icon is polished and finished as desired.&lt;ref name=missouri/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.india9.com/i9show/Dhokra-Craft-52343.htm |title = Dhokra craft |accessdate = 2009-03-12|last =   |first =    |work = |publisher =india9.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The name==
Dhokra Damar tribes are the traditional [[metalsmith]]s of [[West Bengal]] and [[Odisha]]. Their technique of lost wax casting is named after their tribe, hence Dhokra metal casting. The tribe extends from [[Jharkhand]] to West Bengal and [[Odisha|Orissa]]; members are distant cousins of the [[Chhattisgarh]] Dhokras. A few hundred years ago, the Dhokras of Central and Eastern India traveled south as far as [[Kerala]] and north as far as [[Rajasthan]] and hence are now found [[List of regions of India|all over India]]. Dhokra, or Dokra, craft from around [[Santiniketan]], West Bengal, is popular. Recently [[Adilabad]] [[Dokra]] from [[Telangana]] got Geographical Indicator tag in 2018.

==Dhokra,The Art &amp; Jewellery==
When mixed in the right proportion, this art form gives an antique look and augments well with various contemporary styles. A little different from its distant cousins of the east, it embodies a more primitive simplicity.

Some &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tribesindia.com/dhokra-art/ Dokra ornaments]&lt;/ref&gt; are crafted by Bhottada section of the famous Gond tribes of Orissa, well known for their costumes and embellishment styles. Originally, seeds of different wild fruits in the forest were used as beads with cotton thread in their necklace and earrings which over the years have been substituted by beads made from brass by the heating and beating process. By and large, Bhottada women of affluent families having a special status in their community used this jewellery. In recent times, it symbolises a more utilitarian approach in a traditional framework.

'''Digital Live Art''' &lt;ref name="DLA"&gt;Sheridan, J.G. (2006). "Digital Live Art: Mediating Wittingness in Playful Arenas". PhD Thesis. University of Lancaster: Lancaster.&lt;/ref&gt; is the intersection of [[Live Art (art form)]], [[Computing]] and [[Human Computer Interaction]] (HCI). It is used to describe live performance which is computer mediated  - an orchestrated, temporal witnessed event occurring for any length of time and in any place using technological means. Digital Live Art borrows the methods, tools and theories from HCI to help inform and analyze the design and evaluation of Digital Live Art experiences.

== Theory ==
Central to the understanding of Digital Live Art is the concept of performance [[framing (social sciences)]]. First identified by [[Gregory Bateson]],&lt;ref&gt;Bateson, G. (1955). A Theory of Play and Fantasy. Psychiatric research reports, 2, 39-51.&lt;/ref&gt; the performance frame is described as a cognitive context where all the rules of behavior, symbols, and their interpretations are bound within a particular activity within its own structure. The concept has since been used extensively in ethnography by [[Erving Goffman]] in his discussions of face to face encounters in the everyday, in discourse structures;&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, D. Framing in Conversational Structures. Cambridge University Press,
Cambridge, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; in theatrical and ritual events;&lt;ref&gt;Schechner, R. The Future of Ritual, Writings on Culture and Performance.
Routledge, New York, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turner, V. From Ritual to Theatre: The Human Seriousness of Play. PAJ Publications, New York, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; sporting events and festivals;&lt;ref&gt;MacAloon, J. editor. Rite, Drama, Festival, Spectacle. Institute for the Study of Human Issues, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; and trance phenomena &lt;ref&gt;d’Aquili, E., Laughlin, C. D., and McMannus, J. editors. The Spectrum of Ritual jacks .
Columbia University Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; (see:&lt;ref&gt;Rush, M. Security art. Journal of Performance and Art - PAJ, 26(1):113–115, January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Goffman’s work uses the concept of performance frame to broadly mean a constructed context within the limits of which individual human agency and social interaction takes place. For example, a theatrical frame,&lt;ref name="Goffman"&gt;E. Goffman. Frame Analysis: An Essay on the Organization of Experience. Harper and Row, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; pp.&amp;nbsp;124–155) involves the construction of a higher-level frame on top of a ‘primary framework’, i.e., the reality in which the fantasy takes place. In this example, actors assume a character, audiences suspend disbelief and events have their meaning transformed (e.g., compare the use of a mobile phone in public with its use in a theatre). Additionally, framings are temporal, meaning that they have specific beginning and endings. While many theorists argue that all social interaction may be seen from a dramaturgical perspective, meaning all everyday social interaction becomes performance in some sense,&lt;ref name="Goffman"/&gt; Digital Live Art theorists often deliberately align their work with [[Richard Schechner]],&lt;ref&gt;R. Schechner. Performance Theory. Routledge, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; narrowing their analysis to cover more stabilized ‘established’ forms of performance so that performance framing is defined as an activity done within the intended frame ‘by an individual or group’ who have some established knowledge about the frame, and are ‘in the presence of and for another individual or group’.&lt;ref&gt;Benford, S., Crabtree, A., Reeves, S., Flintham, M., Drozd, A., Sheridan, J.G., Dix, A. The frame of the game: Blurring the boundary between fiction and reality in mobile experiences. In Proceedings of SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI), April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Performance framings then, are intentional, temporal and for an audience.

== Method and Tools ==
The goal of interaction in Digital Live Art goes beyond that of traditional HCI methods and theory which focus on usability, functionality and efficiency. HCI and [[CSCW]] models often focus on workplace activities and their tasks, artefacts and goals. This research often leads to a better understanding of how to increase efficiency in the workplace by providing more efficient and usable interfaces. For example, one could conduct [[usability testing]] or [[task analysis]] of how a DJ uses his DJ decks and one could then use this information to design a more efficient system.

However, traditional HCI models tell us little about how the performer-audience relationship develops as a result of users wittingness to interact with the system. The intention with Digital Live Art is not to make more "usable" systems but rather to allow for "participatory transitions"&lt;ref name="DLA"/&gt; - transitions between "witting and unwitting",&lt;ref name="DLA"/&gt; between observation and participation, between participation and performance. Since the goal with Digital Live Art systems is to "mediate wittingness"&lt;ref name="DLA"/&gt; rather than task-focused interaction, the application of many HCI models, frameworks and methods become insufficient for analyzing and evaluating Digital Live Art.

=== Performance Triad Model ===
Sheridan first introduced the '''Performance Triad Model''' &lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, J.G., Dix, A., Lock, S. and Bayliss, A. (2004) Understanding Interaction in Ubiquitous Guerrilla Performances in Playful Arenas. S. In Fincher, P. Markopolous, D. Moore, &amp; R. Ruddle (Eds.): In People and Computers XVIII-Design for Life: 18th British HCI Group Annual Conference, pp. 3-17, Springer-Verlag, 6–10 September, Leeds, UK. {{ISBN|1-85233-900-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; for analyzing "tripartite interaction" - interaction between observers, participants and performers. In the Performance Triad Model, tripartite interaction where technology binds tripartite interaction to context and environment. Reeves et al.&lt;ref&gt;S. Reeves, S. Benford, C. O’Malley, and M. Fraser. Designing the spectator experience. In Proceedings of SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI), April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; draws a distinction between a performer and a spectator and how their transitioning relationship as mediated by the interface.

=== Formal Method ===
Dix and Sheridan&lt;ref&gt;Dix, A., Sheridan, J.G., Reeves, S., Benford, S. and O'Malley, C. (2005) Formalising Performative Interaction. In Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Design, Specification and Verification of Interactive Systems (DSVIS), pp. 15-25, Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 13–15 July, Newcastle, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced a [[formal method]] for analyzing "performative interaction"&lt;ref name="DLA"/&gt; in Digital Live Art. This formal method provides a mathematical technique for deconstructing interaction between witting and unwitting bystanders and observers, participants in the performance and the performers themselves. The work attempts to formalise some of the basic attributes of performative interaction against a background of sociological analysis in order to better understand how computer interfaces may support performance. This work shows how this generic formalisation can be used in the deconstruction, analysis and understanding of performative action and more broadly in live performance.

'''Folklore studies''', also known as '''folkloristics''', and occasionally '''tradition studies''' or '''folk life studies''' in Britain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=England, National Folklore Survey|journal=Folklore|volume=127|issue=3|pages=257–269|doi=10.1080/0015587X.2016.1198178|year = 2016|last1 = Widdowson|first1 = J. D. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the formal academic discipline devoted to the study of [[folklore]]. This term, along with its synonyms,&lt;ref group=note&gt;According to Alan Dundes, this term was first introduced in an address by [[Charles Leland]] in 1889. He spoke in German to the Hungarian Folklore Society and referenced "Die Folkloristik". {{harv|Dundes|2005|page=386}} In contemporary scholarship, the word ''Folkloristics'' is favored by Alan Dundes, and used in the title of his publication {{harv|Dundes|1978}}. The term ''Folklore Studies'' is defined and used by [[Simon Bronner]], see {{harv|Bronner|1986|page=xi}}.&lt;/ref&gt; gained currency in the 1950s to distinguish the academic study of traditional culture from the [[cultural artifact|folklore artifacts]] themselves. It became established as a field across both Europe and North America, coordinating with ''Volkskunde'' (German), ''folkermimne'' (Norwegian), and ''folkminnen'' (Swedish), among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Brunvald|1996|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The importance of folklore and folklore studies was recognized globally 1982 in the [[UNESCO]] document "Recommendation on the Safeguarding of Traditional Culture and Folklore".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13141&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=UNESCO Recommendation 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  UNESCO again in 2003 published a [[Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage]]. Parallel to these global statements, the American Folklife Preservation Act (P.L. 94-201),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/folklife/public_law.html | title=Public Law 94-201 (The Creation of the American Folklife Center, Library of Congress)}}&lt;/ref&gt; passed by the [[United States Congress]] in conjunction with the Bicentennial Celebration in 1976, included a definition of folklore, also called [[folklife]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...[Folklife] means the traditional expressive culture shared within the various groups in the United States: familial, ethnic, occupational, religious, regional; expressive culture includes a wide range of creative and symbolic forms such as custom, belief, technical skill, language, literature, art, architecture, music, play, dance, drama, ritual, pageantry, handicraft; these expressions are mainly learned orally, by imitation, or in performance, and are generally maintained without benefit of formal instruction or institutional direction." &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This law was added to the panoply of other legislation designed to protect the natural and cultural heritage of the United States. It gives voice to a growing understanding that the cultural diversity of the United States is a national strength and a resource worthy of protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hufford|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To fully understand the term ''folklore studies'', it is necessary to clarify its component parts: the terms '''folk''' and '''lore'''. Originally the word ''folk'' applied only to rural, frequently poor, frequently illiterate peasants. A more contemporary definition of ''folk'' is a social group which includes two or more persons with common traits, who express their shared identity through distinctive traditions. "Folk is a flexible concept which can refer to a nation as in [[Folklore of the United States|American folklore]] or to a [[Family folklore|single family.]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{harv |Dundes|1969|page=13|footnote=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expanded social definition of ''folk'' supports a wider view of the material considered to be ''folklore artifacts''. These now include "things people make with words (verbal lore), things they make with their hands (material lore), and things they make with their actions (customary lore)".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Wilson|2006|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The folklorist studies the [[traditional]] artifacts of a group. They study the groups, within which these customs, traditions and beliefs are transmitted.

'''Transmission''' of these artifacts is a vital part of the folklore process. Without communicating these beliefs and customs within the group over space and time, they would become cultural shards relegated to cultural archaeologists. These [[Cultural artifacts|folk artifacts]] continue to be passed along informally within the group, as a rule anonymously and always in multiple variants. For the folk group is not individualistic, it is community-based and nurtures its lore in community. This is in direct contrast to [[high culture]], where any single work of a named artist is protected by copyright law.

The folklorist strives to understand the '''significance''' of these beliefs, customs and objects for the group. For "folklore ''means'' something -- to the tale teller, to the song singer, to the fiddler, and to the audience or addressees".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dundes|2007a|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cultural units&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dundes|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;  would not be passed along unless they had some continued relevance within the group. That meaning can however shift and morph. So [[Halloween]] of the 21st century is not the All Hallows' Eve of the Middle Ages, and even gives rise to its own set of  [[Poisoned candy myths|urban legends]] independent of the historical celebration. The cleansing rituals of Orthodox Judaism were originally good public health in a land with little water; now these customs signify identification as an Orthodox Jew.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Georges|1995|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With an increasingly theoretical sophistication of the social sciences, it has become evident that folklore is a naturally occurring and necessary component of any social group, it is indeed all around us.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not have to be old or antiquated. It continues to be created, transmitted and in any group can be used to differentiate between "us" and "them". All cultures have their own unique folklore, and each culture has to develop and refine the techniques and methods of folklore studies most effective in identifying and researching their own. As an academic discipline, folklore studies straddles the space between the Social Sciences and the Humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hufford|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not always the case. The study of folklore originated in Europe in the first half of the 19th century with a focus on the oral folklore of the rural peasant populations. The "[[Kinder- und Hausmärchen]]" of the [[Brothers Grimm]] (first published 1812) is the best known but by no means only collection of verbal folklore of the European peasantry. This interest in stories, sayings and songs, i.e. verbal lore, continued throughout the 19th century and aligned the fledgling discipline of folklore studies with Literature and Mythology. By the turn into the 20th century, European folklorists remained focused on the oral folklore of the homogeneous peasant populations in their regions, while the American folklorists, led by [[Franz Boas]], chose to consider [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures in their research, and included the totality of their customs and beliefs as folklore. This distinction aligned American folklore studies with cultural anthropology and ethnology, using the same techniques of data collection in their field research. This divided alliance of folklore studies between the humanities and the social sciences offers a wealth of theoretical vantage points and research tools to the field of folklore studies as a whole, even as it continues to be a point of discussion within the field itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Zumwalt|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Public folklore]] is a relatively new offshoot of folklore studies; it started after the Second World War and modeled itself on the seminal work of [[Alan Lomax]] and [[Ben Botkin]] in the 1930s which emphasized [[applied folklore]]. Public sector folklorists work to document, preserve and present the beliefs and customs of diverse cultural groups in their region. These positions are often affiliated with museums, libraries, arts organizations, public schools, historical societies, etc. The most renowned of these is the [[American Folklife Center]] at the Smithsonian, together with its [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]] held every summer in Washington, DC. Public folklore differentiates itself from the academic folklore supported by universities, in which collection, research and analysis are primary goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hufford|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The terms '''folklore studies''' and '''folklore''' belong to a large and confusing word family. We have already used the synonym pairs '''Folkloristics / Folklife Studies''' and '''folklore / folklife''', all of them in current usage within the field. ''Folklore'' was the original term used in this discipline. Its synonym, ''folklife'', came into circulation in the second half of the 20th century, at a time when some researchers felt that the term ''folklore'' was too closely tied exclusively to oral lore. The new term ''folklife'', along with its synonym ''folk culture'', is meant to categorically include all aspects of a culture, not just the oral traditions. [[Folk process]] is used to describe the refinement and creative change of artifacts by community members within the folk tradition that defines the folk process.&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;{{cite book | title=Story/telling | publisher=Univ. Queensland Press | author1=Levy, Bronwen Ann|author2=Murphy, Ffion  | year=1991 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=5Rhqzx0oPOgC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=%22folk+process%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22folk%20process%22&amp;f=false | page=43| isbn=9780702232022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Professionals within this field, regardless of the other words they use, consider themselves to be '''folklorists'''.

Other terms which might be confused with folklore are [[popular culture]] and [[Vernacular culture]], both of which vary from folklore in distinctive ways. '''Pop culture''' tends to be in demand for a limited time; it is generally mass-produced and communicated using mass media. Individually, these tend to be labeled [[fads]], and disappear as quickly as they appear. The term '''vernacular culture''' differs from folklore in its overriding emphasis on a specific locality or region. For example, [[vernacular architecture]] denotes the standard building form of a region, using the materials available and designed to address functional needs of the local economy. ''Folk architecture'' is a subset of this, in which the construction is not done by a professional architect or builder, but by an individual putting up a needed structure in the local style. In a broader sense, all folklore is vernacular, i.e. tied to a region, whereas not everything vernacular is necessarily folklore.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also further cognates used in connection with folklore studies. '''Folklorism''' refers to "material or stylistic elements of folklore [presented] in a context which is foreign to the original tradition." This definition, offered by the folklorist Hermann Bausinger, does not discount the validity of meaning expressed in these "second hand" traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Smidchens|1999|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Walt Disney films and products belong in this category of folklorism; the fairy tales, originally told around a winter fire, have become animated film characters, stuffed animals and bed linens. Their meaning, however far removed from the original story telling tradition, does not detract from the importance and meaning they have for their young audience. '''[[Fakelore]]''' refers to artifacts which might be termed ''pseudo-folklore''; these are manufactured items claiming to be traditional. The folklorist [[Richard Dorson]] coined this word, clarifying it in his book "Folklore and Fakelore".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorson|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current thinking within the discipline is that this term places undue emphasis on the origination of the artifact as a sign of authenticity of the tradition. The adjective '''folkloric''' is used to designate materials having the character of folklore or tradition, at the same time making no claim to authenticity.

==Methodology==
There are several goals of active folklore research. The first objective is to identity tradition bearers within a social group and to collect their lore, preferably in situ. Once collected, these data need to be documented and preserved to enable further access and study. The documented lore is then available to be analyzed and interpreted by folklorists and other cultural historians, and can become the basis for studies of either individual customs or comparative studies. There are multiple venues, be they museums, journals or folk festivals to present the research results. The final step in this methodology involves advocating for these groups in their distinctiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Wilson|2006|pages=81–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific tools needed by folklorists to do their research are manifold. 
* The researchers must be comfortable in '''fieldwork'''; going out to meet their informants where they live, work, and perform. 
* They need to access '''archives''' housing a vast array of unpublished folklore collections. 
* They will want work with '''folk museums''', to both view the collections, and present their own findings. 
* '''Bibliographies''' maintained by libraries and on line contain an important trove of articles from around the world. 
* The use of '''indexes''' allow them to view and use the categorization of artifacts which have already been established. 
* All work by a folklorist must be appropriately '''annotated''' in order to provide identifiable sources of the work. 
* For all folklorists '''terminology''' becomes a skill to master as they rub elbows not only with related academic fields but also with the colloquial understanding (what exactly is a fairy tale?). This shared vocabulary, with varying and sometimes divergent shades of meaning, needs to be used thoughtfully and consistently. 
* The use of '''printed sources''' to locate and identify further variants of a folk tradition is a necessary adjunct to the field research. 
* Because the transmission of folk artifacts preceded and ignored the establishment of national and political boundaries, it is important to cultivate '''international connections''' to folklorists in neighboring countries and around the world to compare both the artifacts researched and the methodology used. 
* A knowledge of the '''history of folklore studies''' is called for to identify the direction and more importantly the biases which the field has taken in the past, enabling us to temper the current analysis with more impartiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorson|1972|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;In a more dramatic and less technical approach, Henry Glassie describes the tools of the folklore trade: "[Folklorists were the] hunters and gatherers of academe…still rooting about in reality, hunting down and gathering up facts that we brought back alive. In those days [the 1960s] … we were delighted to be allowed to enter the university, set up camp, and practice our humble, archaic trade. They had let us in and we honored the established disciplines around us by stealing all we could. While the more advanced people around us slept, we slid in the shadows past their fires, rifled their baggage, stole their books, learned their language, and came to be able to ape their culture in a way that we at least found convincing. In our excitement we did not stop to ponder whether their theories sorted well with our traditional preoccupations. We learned the schemes of those we perceived to be higher in the academic hierarchy than ourselves, then applied those schemes to our own topics. We felt mature.{{harv|Glassie|1983|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The folklorist also rubs shoulders with researchers, tools and inquiries of neighboring fields:  literature, anthropology, cultural history, linguistics, geography, musicology, sociology, psychology. This is just a partial list of the fields of study related to folklore studies, all of which are united by a common interest in subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bauman|Paredes|1972|page=xx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===From antiquities to lore===
It is well-documented that the term "folklore" was coined in 1846 by the Englishman [[William Thoms]]. He fabricated it for use in an article published in the August 22, 1846 issue of [[The Athenaeum (British magazine)|''The Athenaeum'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Georges|1995|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thoms consciously replaced the contemporary terminology of   "popular antiquities" or "popular literature" with this new word. Folklore was to  emphasize the study of a specific subset of the population: the rural, mostly illiterate peasantry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his published call for help in documenting antiquities, Thoms was echoing scholars from across the European continent to collect artifacts of older, mostly oral cultural traditions still flourishing among the rural populace. In Germany the [[Brothers Grimm]] had first published their "[[Kinder- und Hausmärchen]]" in 1812. They continued throughout their lives to collect [[Volkskunde|German folk tales]] to include in their collection. In [[Danish folklore#History|Scandinavia]], intellectuals were also searching for their authentic [[Teutons|Teutonic roots]] and had labeled their studies ''Folkeminde'' (Danish) or ''Folkermimne'' (Norwegian).&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout Europe and America, other early collectors of folklore were at work. [[Thomas Crofton Croker]] published fairy tales from southern Ireland and, together with his wife, documented [[keening]] and other Irish funereal customs. [[Elias Lönnrot]] is best known for his collection of epic Finnish poems published under the title [[Kalevala]]. [[John Fanning Watson]] in the United States published the "Annals of Philadelphia".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/annalsofphiladel01wats | title=Annals of Philadelphia and Pennsylvania, in the olden time; being a collection of memoirs, anecdotes, and incidents of the city and its inhabitants, and of the earliest settlements of the inland part of Pennsylvania, from the days of the founders ... Embellished with engravings| publisher=[Philadelphia] The author| date=1850-1860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With increasing industrialization, urbanization, and the rise in literacy throughout Europe in the 19th century, folklorists were concerned that the oral knowledge and beliefs, the [[Oral traditions|lore]] of the rural folk would be lost. It  was posited that the stories, beliefs and customs were surviving fragments of a cultural mythology of the region, pre-dating Christianity and rooted in pagan peoples and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This thinking goes in lockstep with the rise of [[nationalism]] across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Georges|1995|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some British folklorists,{{which|date=August 2018}} rather than lamenting or attempting to preserve rural or pre-industrial cultures, saw their work as a means of furthering industrialization, scientific rationalism, and [[disenchantment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Josephson-Storm|2017|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the need to collect these vestiges of rural traditions became more compelling, the need to formalize this new field of cultural studies became apparent. The British ''[[Folklore Society]]'' was established in 1878 and the ''[[American Folklore Society]]'' was established a decade later. These were just two of a plethora of academic societies founded in the latter half of the 19th century by educated members of the emerging middle class.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bronner|1986|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; For literate, urban intellectuals and students of folklore the '''folk''' was someone else and the '''past''' was recognized as being something truly different.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Georges|1995|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folklore became a measure of the [[Social progress|progress of society]], how far we had moved forward into the industrial present and indeed removed ourselves from a past marked by poverty, illiteracy and superstition. The task of both the professional folklorist and the amateur at the turn of the 20th  century was to collect and classify cultural artifacts from the pre-industrial rural areas, parallel to the drive in the life sciences to do the same for the natural world.&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859.&lt;/ref&gt; "Folk was a clear label to set materials apart from modern life…material specimens, which were meant to be classified in the natural history of civilization. Tales, originally dynamic and fluid, were given stability and concreteness by means of the printed page."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bronner|1986|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Viewed as fragments from a pre-literate culture, these stories and objects were collected without context to be displayed and studied in museums and anthologies, just as bones and potsherds were gathered for the life sciences. [[Kaarle Krohn]] and [[Antti Aarne]] were active collectors of folk poetry in Finland. The Scotsman [[Andrew Lang]] is known for his 25 volumes of [[fairy tales|Andrew Lang's Fairy Books]] from around the world. [[Francis James Child]] was an American academic who collected English and Scottish popular ballads and their American variants, published as the [[Child Ballads]]. In the United States, both [[Mark Twain]] and [[Washington Irving]] drew on folklore to write their stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bronner|1986|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bronner|1986|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; One [[Samuel Clemens]] was also a charter member of the American Folklore Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dundes|2005|page=402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aarne–Thompson and the historic-geographic method===
By the beginning of the 20th century these collections had grown to include artifacts from around the world and across several centuries. A system to organize and categorize them became necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv| Georges|1995|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antti Aarne published a first classification system for folktales in 1910. It was later expanded into the [[Aarne–Thompson classification system]] by [[Stith Thompson]] and remains the standard classification system for European folktales and other types of oral literature. As the number of classified artifacts grew, similarities were noted in items which had been collected from very different geographic regions, ethnic groups and epochs.

In an effort to understand and explain the similarities found in tales from different locations, the Finnish folklorists Julius and Kaarle Krohne developed the [[Julius Krohn#Scientific work|Historical-Geographical method]], also called the Finnish method.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Wolf-Knuts|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using multiple variants of a tale, this investigative method attempted to work backwards in time and location to compile the original version from what they considered the incomplete fragments still in existence. This was the search for the "Urform,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which by definition was more complete and more "authentic" then the newer, more scattered versions. The historic-geographic method has been succinctly described as a "quantitative mining of the resulting archive, and extraction of distribution patterns in time and space". It is based on the assumption that every text artifact is a variant of the original text. As a proponent of this method, [[Walter Anderson (folklorist)|Walter Anderson]] proposed additionally a '''Law of Self-Correction''', i.e. a feedback mechanism which would keep the variants closer to the original form.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorst|2016|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Anderson is best known for his monograph ''[[King John and the Bishop|Kaiser und Abt]]'' (Folklore Fellows' Communications 42, Helsinki 1923) on folktales of type AT 922.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during the first decades of the 20th century that Folklore Studies in Europe and America began to diverge. The Europeans continued with their emphasis on oral traditions of the pre-literate peasant, and remained connected to literary scholarship within the universities. By this definition, folklore was completely based in the European cultural sphere; any social group that did not originate in Europe was to be studied by [[Ethnology|ethnologists]] and [[cultural anthropologists]]. In this light, some twenty-first century scholars have interpreted European folkloristics as an instrument of [[internal colonialism]], in parallel with the imperialistic dimensions of early 20th century cultural anthropology and [[Orientalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Josephson-Storm|2017|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike contemporary anthropology, however, many early European folklorists were themselves members of the prioritized groups that folkloristics was intended to study; for instance, Andrew Lang and [[James George Frazer]] were both themselves Scotsmen and studied rural folktales from towns near where they grew up.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Josephson-Storm|2017|pages=128–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to this, American folklorists, under the influence of the German-American [[Franz Boas]] and [[Ruth Benedict]], sought to incorporate other cultural groups living in their region into the study of folklore. This included not only customs brought over by northern European immigrants, but also African Americans, [[Acadians]] of eastern Canada, [[Cajuns]] of Louisiana, [[Hispanics]] of the American southwest, and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. Not only were these distinct cultural groups all living in the same regions, but their proximity to each other caused their traditions and customs to intermingle. The lore of these distinct social groups, all of them Americans, was considered the bailiwick of American folklorists, and aligned American folklore studies more with ethnology than with literary studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Zumwalt|1988|pages=16–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Depression and the Federal Writers' Project===
Then came the 1930s and the worldwide [[Great Depression]]. In the United States the [[Federal Writers' Project]] was established as part of the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]]. Its goal was to offer paid employment to thousands of unemployed writers by engaging them in various cultural projects around the country. These white collar workers were sent out as field workers to collect the oral folklore of their regions, including stories, songs, idioms and dialects. The most famous of these collections is the [[Slave Narrative Collection]]. The folklore collected under the auspices of the Federal Writers Project during these years continues to offer a goldmine of primary source materials for folklorists and other cultural historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|pages=10, 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As chairman of the Federal Writers' Project between 1938 and 1942, [[Benjamin A. Botkin]] supervised the work of these folklore field workers. Both Botkin and [[John Lomax]] were particularly influential during this time in expanding folklore collection techniques to include more detailing of the interview context.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a significant move away from viewing the collected artifacts as isolated fragments, broken remnants of an incomplete pre-historic whole. Using these new interviewing techniques, the collected lore became embedded in and imbued with meaning within the framework of its contemporary practice. The emphasis moved from the lore to the folk, i.e. the groups and the people who gave this lore meaning within contemporary daily living.

===German Folklore in the Third Reich ===
In Europe during these same decades, folklore studies were drifting in a different direction. Throughout the 19th century folklore had been naively tied to romantic ideals of the soul of the people, in which folk tales and folksongs recounted the lives and exploits of ethnic folk heroes. Folklore chronicled the mythical origins of different peoples across Europe and established the beginnings of national pride (read: [[nationalism]]). By the first decade of the 20th century there were scholarly societies as well as individual folklore positions within universities, academies and museums, however the study of German Volkskunde had yet to be defined as an academic discipline. 

In the 1920s this originally innocent movement was usurped by nationalistic political forces in several European countries, first and foremost in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorson|1972|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bendix|1998|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this decade that an unfortunate congruence with national socialist ideology was seen to take place; the vocabulary of German Volkskunde, words such as Volk (folk), Rasse (race), Stamm (tribe) and Erbe (heritage) mapped neatly into the political dogmas of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi]] party. The expressed goal of the National Socialists was to re-establish the purity of the Germanic, i.e. Nordic, tribes in Europe. The German philosopher [[Ernst Bloch]] was one of the main apologists for this ideology.&lt;ref group=note&gt;In his study ''Erbschaft dieser Zeit'' (1935) (translation ''Heritage of Our Times'', Polity, 1991) Ernst Bloch examined how the more mythological way of scholarly thought of the 19th century was revived by the National Socialists.&lt;/ref&gt; “Nazi ideology presented racial purity as the means to heal the wounds of the suffering German state following World War I. Hitler painted the ethnic heterogeneity of Germany as a major reason for the country’s economic and political weakness, and he promised to restore a German realm based on a cleansed, and hence strong, German people. Racial or ethnic purity” was the goal of the Nazis, intent on forging a [[Greater Germanic Reich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bendix|1997|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the decades immediately following the Second World War, departments of Folklore were being established in multiple German universities. However an analysis of just what part folklore studies played in justifying and supporting the criminal abuses during the Third Reich did not begin until 20 years after World War II in West Germany. The scholarship, in particular the works of Hermann Bausinger and Wolfgang Emmerich in the 1960s, pointed out that the vocabulary current in Volkskunde was ideally suited for the kind of ideology that the National Socialists had built up.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Lixfeld|Dow|1994|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then another 20 years before convening the 1986 Munich conference on Folklore and National Socialism. This continues to be a difficult and painful discussion within the German folklore community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Lixfeld|Dow|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After World War II===
Following World War II, the discussion continued about whether to align folklore studies with literature or ethnology. Within this discussion, many voices were actively trying to identify the optimal approach to take in the analysis of folklore artifacts. One major change had already been initiated by Franz Boas. Culture was no longer viewed in evolutionary terms; each culture has its own integrity and completeness, and was not progressing either toward wholeness or toward fragmentation. Individual artifacts must have meaning within the culture and for individuals themselves in order to assume [[Cultural relativism|cultural relevance]] and assure continued transmission. Because the European folklore movement had been primarily oriented toward oral traditions, a new term, [[folklife]], was introduced to represent the full range of traditional culture. This included [[music]], [[dance]], [[storytelling]], [[crafts]], [[costume]], [[foodways]] and more.

Folklore became more than just stuff, it became a verb. Folklore was the event of doing within a given context, for a specific audience, using artifacts as necessary props in the communication of traditions between individuals and within groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bauman|1972|page=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1970s, these new areas of folklore studies became articulated in [[performance studies]], where traditional behaviors are evaluated and understood within the context of their performance. It is the meaning within the social group that becomes the focus for these folklorists, foremost among them [[Richard Bauman]]n&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Baumann|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Kirshenblatt-Gimblett|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enclosing any performance is a framework which signals that the following is something outside of ordinary communication. For example, [[Joke#Telling jokes|"So, have you heard the one…"]] automatically flags the following as a joke. A performance can take place either within a cultural group, re-iterating and re-enforcing the customs and beliefs of the group. Or it can be performance for an outside group, in which the first goal is to set the performers apart from the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Baumann|1971|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This analysis then goes beyond the artifact itself, be it dance, music or story-telling. It goes beyond the performers and their message. As part of performance studies, the audience becomes part of the performance. If any folklore performance strays too far from audience expectations, it will likely be brought back by means of a negative feedback loop at the next iteration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorst|2016|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both performer and audience are acting within the "Twin Laws" of [[Folk process|folklore transmission]], in which novelty and innovation is balanced by the conservative forces of the familiar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Toelken|1996|pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even further, the presence of a [[Participant observation#Impact of researcher involvement|folklore observer]] at a performance of any kind will influence the performance itself in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. Because folklore is firstly an act of communication between parties, it is incomplete without inclusion of the reception in its analysis. The understanding of folklore performance as communication leads directly into [[Linguistics#Anthropology|modern linguistic theory]] and [[communication studies]]. Words both reflect and shape our worldview. Oral traditions, particularly in their stability over generations and even centuries, provide significant insight into the ways in which insiders of a culture see, understand, and express their responses to the world around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Toelken|1996|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;In his chapter "Folklore and Cultural Worldview", Toelken provides an illuminating comparison of the worldview of European Americans with Navajos. In the use of language, the two cultural groups express widely differing understandings of their spatial and temporal place in the universe.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three major approaches to folklore interpretation were developed during the second half of the 20th century. [[Structuralism#Structuralism in anthropology|Structuralism]] in folklore studies attempts to define the structures underlying oral and customary folklore.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For example, a [[joke]] uses words within a specific and well-defined narrative structure to make people laugh. A [[fable]] uses anthropomorphized animals and natural features to illustrate a moral lesson, frequently concluding with a moral. These are just a few of the many formulaic structures used in oral traditions.&lt;/ref&gt; Once classified, it was easy for structural folklorists to lose sight of the overarching issue: what are the characteristics which keep a form constant and relevant over multiple generations? [[Structural functionalism|Functionalism]] in folklore studies also came to the fore following World War II; as spokesman, [[William Bascom]] formulated the [[William Bascom#Four functions of folklore|4 functions of folklore]]. This approach takes a more top-down approach to understand how a specific form fits into and expresses meaning within the culture as a whole.&lt;ref group=note&gt;An example of this are the [[Joke#Joke cycles|joke cycles]] that spontaneously appear in response to a national or world tragedy or disaster.&lt;/ref&gt; A third method of folklore analysis, popular in the late 20th century, is the [[Psychoanalytic theory|Psychoanalytic]] Interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|page=187ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; championed by [[Alan Dundes]]. His monographs, including a study of homoerotic subtext in American football&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dundes|1978|title=Into the Endzone for a Touchdown}}&lt;/ref&gt; and anal-erotic elements in German folklore,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dundes|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; were not always appreciated and involved Dundes in several major folklore studies [[Alan Dundes#Controversy|controversies]] during his career. True to each of these approaches, and any others one might want to employ (political, women's issues, material culture, urban contexts, non-verbal text, ad infinitum), whichever perspective is chosen will spotlight some features and leave other characteristics in the shadows.

With the passage in 1976 of the American Folklife Preservation Act, folklore studies in the United States came of age. This legislation follows in the footsteps of other legislation designed to safeguard more tangible aspects of our [[Cultural Heritage|national heritage]] worthy of protection. This law also marks a shift in our national awareness; it gives voice to the national understanding that diversity within the country is a unifying feature, not something that separates us.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://folkways.si.edu/mission-history/smithsonian | title=Mission and History}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We no longer view cultural difference as a problem to be solved, but as a tremendous opportunity. In the diversity of American folklife we find a marketplace teeming with the exchange of traditional forms and cultural ideas, a rich resource for Americans".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hufford|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; This diversity is celebrated annually at the [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]] and many other [[List of folk festivals|folklife fests]] around the country.

==Leaning into the 21st century== 
With the advent of the [[digital age]], the question once again foregrounds itself concerning the relevance of [[folklore]] in this new century. Yet the profession grows and articles and books on folklore topics proliferate. That said, the traditional role of the folklorist is indeed changing.

===Globalization===
America is known as a land of immigrants; with the exception of the first [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian nations]], everyone originally came from somewhere else. Americans are proud of their [[cultural diversity]]. For folklorists, this country represents a trove of cultures rubbing elbows with each other, mixing and matching into exciting combinations as new generations come up. It is in the study of their folklife that we begin to understand the cultural patterns underlying the different ethnic groups. Language and customs provide a window into their view of reality. "The study of varying worldviews among ethnic and national groups in America remains one of the most important unfinished tasks for folklorists and anthropologists."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv| Toelken|1996|page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;See also Dundes (2005), pg. 387. [Folklore studies is] "a discipline which has been ahead of its time in recognizing the importance of folklore in promoting ethnic pride and in providing invaluable data for the discovery of native cognitive categories and patterns of worldview and values."&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to a widespread concern, we are not seeing a loss of diversity and increasing [[cultural homogenization]] across the land.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The newness of this discussion can be seen in the references for [[Cultural homogenization]]; all sources listed have been published in 21st century.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, critics of this theory point out that as different cultures mix, the cultural landscape becomes multifaceted with the intermingling of customs. People become aware of other cultures and pick and choose different items to adopt from each other. One noteworthy example of this is the [[Hanukkah bush|Jewish Christmas Tree]], a point of some contention among American Jews.

[[Public folklore|Public sector folklore]] was introduced into the [[American Folklore Society]] in the early 1970s. These public folklorists work in museums and cultural agencies to identify and document the diverse folk cultures and folk artists in their region. Beyond this, they provide performance venues for the artists, with the twin objectives of entertainment and education about different ethnic groups. Given the [[List of folk festivals|number of folk festivals]] held around the world, it becomes clear that the cultural multiplicity of a region is presented with pride and excitement. Public folklorists are increasingly being involved in economic and community development projects to elucidate and clarify differing world views of the social groups impacted by the projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hufford|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet usage===
With the advent of the internet, the transmission of individual folklore artifacts to a worldwide audience is done in a flash. We are no longer dependent upon individual performers to find us with their song and dance; now they just broadcast across the net. An example of this is [[Joke#Electronic joking|electronic joking]], which has become as common as oral joking and can reach a much larger audience with just a button click. The folk group is no longer exclusively defined by physical presence and locality, it also exists in the connectivity of cyberspace. With this, diffusion of folklore is skewed away from a live performance toward a multiplicity of new venues and social groupings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Mason|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; These new transmission modes apply not only to oral folklore. Traditional skills and handicrafts can be videotaped and uploaded to [[YouTube]], enabling any interested individual anywhere in the world access to this record of specific traditional skills.&lt;ref group=note&gt;One example is found on the YouTube channel for Primitive Technology. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA&lt;/ref&gt; No longer anchored in time and space, both the social group and the channels of folklore transmission have expanded across the globe.

===Computerized databases and big data===
Once folklore artifacts have been recorded on the World Wide Web, they can be collected in large electronic databases and even moved into collections of [[big data]]. This compels folklorists to find new ways to collect and [[data curation|curate]] these data.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dundes |2005|page=401}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with these new challenges, electronic data collections provide the opportunity to ask different questions, and combine with other academic fields to explore new aspects of traditional culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorst|2016|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Computational humor]] is just one new field that has taken up the traditional oral forms of jokes and anecdotes for study, holding its first dedicated conference in 1996. This takes us beyond gathering and categorizing large joke collections. Scholars are using computers firstly to recognize jokes in context,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sacks|1974|pages=337–353}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further to attempt to create jokes using [[artificial intelligence]].

===Binary thinking of the computer age===
As we move forward in the digital age, the [[binary opposition|binary thinking]] of the 20th century [[Structuralism|structuralists]] remains an important tool in the folklorist's toolbox.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|pages=184–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that binary thinking was invented in recent times along with computers; only that we became aware of both the power and the limitations of the "either/or" construction. In folklore studies, the multiple binaries underlying much of the theoretical thinking have been identified – {dynamicism : conservatism}, {anecdote : myth}, {process : structure}, {performance : tradition}, {improvisation : repetition}, {variation : traditionalism},  {repetition : innovation};&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorst|2016|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; not to overlook the original binary of the first folklorists: {traditional : modern} or {old : new}. Bauman re-iterates this thought pattern in claiming that at the core of all folklore is the dynamic tension between tradition and variation (or creativity).&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bauman|2008|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noyes&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Noyes|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses similar vocabulary to define [folk] group as "the ongoing play and tension between, on the one hand, the fluid networks of relationship we constantly both produce and negotiate in everyday life and, on the other, the imagined communities we also create and enact but that serve as forces of stabilizing allegiance."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorst|2016|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This thinking only becomes problematic in light of the theoretical work done on [[binary opposition]], which exposes the values intrinsic to any binary pair. Typically, one of the two opposites assumes a role of dominance over the other. The categorization of binary oppositions is "often value-laden and ethnocentric", imbuing them with illusory order and superficial meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Goody|1977|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linear and non-linear concepts of time===
Another baseline of western thought has also been thrown into disarray in the recent past. In western culture, we live in a time of [[progress (history)|progress]], moving forward from one moment to the next. The goal is to become better and better, culminating in perfection. In this model time is linear, with direct causality in the progression. "You reap what you sow", "A stitch in time saves nine", "Alpha and omega", the Christian concept of an [[afterlife]] all exemplify a cultural understanding of time as linear and progressive. In folklore studies, going backwards in time was also a valid avenue of exploration. The goal of the early folklorists of the [[Folkloristics#Aarne–Thompson and the historic-geographic method|historic-geographic school]] was to reconstruct from fragments of folk tales the Urtext of the original mythic (pre-Christian) world view. When and where was an artifact documented? Those were the important questions posed by early folklorists in their collections. Armed with these data points, a grid pattern of [[Spacetime|time-space]] coordinates for artifacts could be plotted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Toelken|1996|pages=271–274}}, {{harv|Dorst|2016|pages=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Awareness has grown that different cultures have different concepts of time (and space). In his study "The American Indian Mind in a Linear World", Donald Fixico describes an alternate concept of time. "Indian thinking" involves "'seeing' things from a perspective emphasizing that circles and cycles are central to world and that all things are related within the Universe." He then suggests that "the concept of time for Indian people has been such a continuum that time becomes less relevant and the rotation of life or seasons of the year are stressed as important."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rouse|2012|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;This blanket interpretation has been questioned by some as too simplistic in its sweeping application to all Native American tribes. See {{harv|Rouse|2012|page=14ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more specific example, the folklorist [[Barre Toelken]] describes the Navajo as living in circular times, which is echoed and re-enforced in their sense of space, the traditional circular or multi-sided [[hogan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Toelken|1996|pages=275ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacking the European mechanistic devices of marking time (clocks, watches, calendars), they depended on the cycles of nature: sunrise to sunset, winter to summer. Their stories and histories are not marked by decades and centuries, but remain close in, as they circle around the constant rhythms of the natural world.

Within the last decades our time scale has expanded from unimaginably small ([[nanoseconds]]) to unimaginably large ([[deep time]]). In comparison, our working concept of time as {past : present : future} looks almost quaint. How do we map "tradition" into this multiplicity of time scales? Folklore studies has already acknowledged this in the study of traditions which are either done in an annual cycle of circular time (ex. Christmas, May Day), or in a life cycle of linear time (ex. baptisms, weddings, funerals). This needs to be expanded to other traditions of oral lore. For folk narrative is NOT a linear chain of isolated tellings, going from one single performance on our time-space grid to the next single performance. Instead it fits better into a non-linear system, where one performer varies the story from one telling to the next, and the performer's understudy starts to tell the story, also varying each performance in response to multiple factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorst|2016|pages=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cybernetics===
[[Cybernetics]] was first developed in the 20th century; it investigates the functions and processes of systems. The goal in cybernetics is to identify and understand a system's closed signaling loop, in which an action by the system generates a change in the environment, which in turn triggers feedback to the system and initiates a new action. The field has expanded from a focus on mechanistic and biological systems to an expanded recognition that these theoretical constructs can also be applied to many cultural and societal systems, including folklore.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorst|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once divorced from a model of tradition that works solely on a linear time scale (i.e. moving from one folklore performance to the next), we begin to ask different questions about how these folklore artifacts maintain themselves over generations and centuries.

The oral tradition of [[jokes]] as an example is found across all cultures, and is documented as early as 1600 B.C.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The earliest recorded joke is on an Egyptian papyrus dated at 1600 B.C. See [[:Joke#Printed jokes and the solitary laugh]].&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the subject matter varies widely to reflect its cultural context, the form of the joke remains remarkably consistent. According to the theories of cybernetics and its secondary field of [[autopoiesis]], this can be attributed to a closed loop auto-correction built into the system maintenance of oral folklore. Auto-correction in oral folklore was first articulated by the folklorist [[Walter Anderson (folklorist)|Walter Anderson]] in his monograph on the [[King John and the Bishop|King and the Abbot]] published 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Anderson|1923}}&lt;/ref&gt; To explain the stability of the narrative, Anderson posited a “double redundancy”, in which the performer has heard the story from multiple other performers, and has himself performed it multiple times. This provides a feedback loop between repetitions at both levels to retain the essential elements of the tale, while at the same time allowing for the incorporation of new elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorst|2016|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another characteristic of cybernetics and autopoiesis is self-generation within a system. Once again looking to jokes, we find new jokes generated in response to events on a continuing basis. The folklorist Bill Ellis accessed internet humor message boards to observe in real time the creation of topical jokes following the 9/11 terrorist attack in the United States. "Previous folklore research has been limited to collecting and documenting successful jokes, and only after they had emerged and come to folklorists' attention. Now, an Internet-enhanced collection creates a time machine, as it were, where we can observe what happens in the period before the risible moment, when attempts at humour are unsuccessful.", that is before they have successfully mapped into the traditional joke format.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Ellis|2002|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Second-order cybernetics]] states that the system observer affects the systemic interplay; this interplay has long been recognized as problematic by folklorists. The act of observing and noting any folklore performance raises without exception the performance from an unconscious habitual acting within a group, to and for themselves, to a performance for an outsider. "Naturally the researcher's presence changes things, in the way that any new entrant to a social setting changes things. When people of different backgrounds, agendas, and resources interact, there are social risks, and where representation and publication are taking place, these risks are exacerbated..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.afsnet.org/default.asp?page=HumanSubjects | title=AFS Position Statement on Research with Human Subjects - American Folklore Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;For a further discussion of this, see also {{harv|Schmidt-Lauber|2012|page=362ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gilan mausoleum''' ({{lang-az|'''Gilan türbəsi'''}}) is a monument located on the slope of a hill in Ordubad district of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in the territory of Kharabagilan habitation. The mausoleum was discovered accidentally by the local population in 1979.&lt;ref name="naxcivanxeberleri"/&gt; The top tower of the tomb is destroyed, but the tomb is in satisfactory condition.

==Architectural features==
The plan of the tomb is octagonal internally, and rectangular externally. Inside of the monument there is a low pavement that does not fit with the envoirment of the interior. The tomb of the Gilan mausoleum differs from the octagonal tombs of medieval architecture that are spread in Azerbaijan and neighboring countries.{{sfn|National Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan|2008|с=142,143}} Center of cover of the Gilan mausoleum is supported by mushroom-shaped - expanding upward column in center of the interior. The column is also octagonal in the plan.

General composition of Gilan mausoleum is in a style with the  XII century mausoleums of Central Azerbaijan, especially the Red Dome mausoleum. The Gilan mausoleum was built of layers of broken rock fragments from surrounding rocks. Unlike its interior, exterior of the monument is neatly built. In the interior the ceiling and floors are completely, as well as spaces between stones of the wall and central support are plastered with white solution. Dark gray stone cuttings and roughness creates natural decorative order. Expression of the interior of the tomb is based on the pure volume structure of the shapes.&lt;ref&gt;Salamzadə Ə.V., Məmmədzadə K.M., Azərbaycan memarlığının Naxçıvan məktəbi abidələri. Baku, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside, on the upper layer of tomb a cubicle body was raised. The top tower was completely built of brick and decorated with geometric ornaments made from bricks. The corner of the body were covered with cylindrical brick columns.{{sfn|National Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan|2008|с=142,143}} The bottom part of one of these columns remains. In decoration of the monument, blue glazed bricks were used as well.

==Research== 
There is no evidence of the time of the mausoleum construction. However, according to the architectural features mentioned above, it is possible to predict the period of the tomb of Gilan for architectural patterns and geometric patterns. The architectural style of the Gilan mausoleum is in same line with the architectural style of the churches built in the XII century in Central Azerbaijan. Gilan mausoleum can be dated back to the XII century as a result of absence of inscription.&lt;ref name="naxcivanxeberleri"&gt;{{cite web|title= Gilan türbəsi|url= http://naxcivanxeberleri.com/gilan-turbəsi/|publisher= kataloq.gomap.az|language= az|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Imparja Television''' (IMP) is an Australian television station servicing remote eastern and central Australia, that began broadcasting on 2 January 1988. It is based in [[Alice Springs]], where it has a studio and satellite uplink facility. Notably, it is controlled by [[Australian Aboriginals]] through ownership by [[Imparja Television Pty Ltd]], and is widely regarded as a symbol of Aboriginal Australia. Most viewers receive Imparja via [[free to view]] satellite transmission, whilst a smaller proportion receive it via analogue terrestrial transmission.

''Imparja'' is an [[Arrernte language|Arrernte]] word meaning [[footprints]]. The word is used to represent that Imparja Television aims to service Arrente people wherever they may live, from [[Mutitjulu]] to [[Kings Canyon (Northern Territory)|King's Canyon]] to [[Alice Springs]] to [[Tennant Creek]] and beyond. They describe their range as a footprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| publisher = Powerhouse Museum
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Imparja Television was identified on-air and in print as '''Nine Imparja''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release
  | title = New Current Affairs Program
  | publisher = Imparja Television
  | date = 27 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; following its dropping of Network Ten affiliation. In 2009, the station again identifies as simply "Imparja" and "IMP", although the Nine Network's nine dots seen in the logo still remain.

==History==

===Origins===
The then [[Australian Broadcasting Authority|Australian Broadcasting Tribunal]] was asked by the Federal Minister for Communications in October 1984 to inquire into the allocation of commercial television licences for a number of remote areas. Licences were granted in 1985 to the [[Golden West Network]], which broadcast to Western Australia, and [[Southern Cross Central|QSTV]] in north-eastern Australia.&lt;ref name="company"&gt;{{cite web

 |df=dmy-all 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 hearings for the allocation of the licence began, and the [[Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association]] (CAAMA), which began providing Central Australian radio programs in local languages in 1980, formed [[Imparja Television Pty Ltd]] as a company.&lt;ref name="company" /&gt; Soon after, the [[Government of the Northern Territory]] announced support to underpin the viability of the Central Zone Remote Television Service (RCTS) by offering to purchase an estimated $2&amp;nbsp;million package of services from the successful applicant. The [[Government of South Australia]] undertook a similar promise, offering loans of $1&amp;nbsp;million to Imparja if they were successful.&lt;ref name="company" /&gt; An extraordinary saga of political, legal and commercial intrigue then ensued during the protracted [[Australian Broadcasting Tribunal]] (ABT) hearing process, pitching Federal, State and Territory Governments against one another with loan promises being substantially watered down or withdrawn as it became apparent the CAAMA application may prevail. Windfall funding from the Australian Bicentennial Authority and the Aboriginal Development Commission ultimately underpinned the feasibility of the CAAMA bid and they were successfully allocated the licence. However subsequent Federal Administrative Tribunal court proceedings brought about by the unsuccessful applicant, Darwin based Territory Television Ltd., attempting to overturn the ABT's decision delayed construction commencement of the new service until May 1987.&lt;ref name="Bell 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Wendy|title=A Remote Possibility: The Battle for Imparja Television|date=May 2008|publisher=IAD Press|location=Alice Springs|isbn=978-1-86465-097-6|chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By October 1987 the new station had begun to build rebroadcast sites and new studios and a main transmitter based in [[Alice Springs]] were completed.&lt;ref name="Bell 2008"/&gt; Imparja's first test program, ''[[Test Cricket|Australia versus Sri Lanka Test Cricket]]'', was telecast on 2 January 1988 in [[Alice Springs]].&lt;ref name="company" /&gt; Two weeks later, on 15 January 1988, the station was officially inaugurated at Imparja Television's head office in Alice Springs by Minister for Communications [[Ralph Willis]] and [[Warren Snowdon]], the Australian federal [[member of parliament#Australia|member of parliament]] for the [[Division of Lingiari]] in [[Northern Territory]].&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Imparja became the first Aboriginal member of the [[FreeTV Australia|Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations]] and the now-defunct Regional Television Association, both dominant organisations at the time.&lt;ref name="company" /&gt;

Imparja was chaired by [[Freda Glynn]] for its first 10 years and, for a time, she was the only female chair of a television network in the world. Freda was one of the first three founders of [[CAAMA]] – the others being [[John Macumba]] and [[Philip Batty]].

Imparja had an initial population reach of 62,000 people, which by 1993 had grown to 125,000.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; Imparja was available through retransmission sites at [[Ceduna]], [[Coober Pedy]], [[Leigh Creek]] and [[Woomera, South Australia|Woomera]] in South Australia, and [[Alice Springs]], [[Tennant Creek]], [[Katherine]] and [[Bathurst Island (Northern Territory)|Bathurst Island]] in the [[Northern Territory]], as well as on the [[Optus Aurora]] [[satellite television|satellite]] platform.

Imparja initially carried programming from all three major Australian commercial television networks, but following aggregation of market area with [[Southern Cross Central|QSTV]], it affiliated with the [[Nine Network]] and [[Network Ten]]. Imparja also screened some [[ABC Television (Australia)|ABC Television]] and [[SBS Television]] indigenous programs, all in addition to original programs commissioned by the station.

===1990s===
In 1990, ''Imparja Local News'' was launched as a fifteen-minute insert of local news into the national bulletin. The station also covered the [[Northern Territory general election, 1990|Northern Territory general election]] live from its Alice Springs studios. This followed the lead taken in 1989 when the station began to produce weather reports for parts of the [[Northern Territory]], South Australia and [[New South Wales]], presented by [[Lavinia Hampton]].&lt;ref name="company" /&gt;

By 1993, Imparja's viewing audience had doubled to approximately 125,000 Australians. This in turn led to the increased allocation of government funding in 1994 to produce ''Yamba's Playtime'', which was the station's first in-house televisual production. [[Yamba's Playtime]] features the station's official mascot, "Yamba". Also in 1994, the Imparja board of directors established the Imparja Business Development Sub Committee, to monitor and provide strategic recommendations for areas of growth for the company.

In 1995, Imparja received the [[Telstra]] Indigenous Business Award for Business of the Year.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; Also in 1995, Imparja's satellite transmission moved from the [[Optus fleet of satellites#A-Class|Aussat A-Class satellites]] to the [[Optus fleet of satellites#Optus B1|Optus B1]] satellite, and the station's licence was renewed.

Two new in-house productions were launched in 1996. The first being the ''BRACS Program'', which was almost fully produced by [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] communities, and ''Corroboree Rock'', an Aboriginal music program.

Imparja's parent company, [[Imparja Pty Ltd]], converted to a [[proprietary company]] in 1997, whilst in the late 1990s, Imparja moved to digital satellite technology on the [[Optus Aurora]] platform. This meant that Imparja's satellite transmission moved from the [[Optus fleet of satellites#Optus B1|Optus B1]] satellite to the [[Optus fleet of satellites#Optus C1|Optus C1]] satellite.

===2000s===
By 2001 the station's coverage area had grown to include over 430,000 people.&lt;ref name="company" /&gt; Around this time 'Imparja Info Channel' ('Channel 31') was launched, providing additional programming, news, and community information to remote Aboriginal communities. The Aboriginal programming on this channel later became known as [[Indigenous Community Television]] (ICTV). In 2007, the whole channel was replaced by [[National Indigenous Television]] (NITV).

Imparja faced criticism by a number of community groups in 2004, following the station's decision to introduce advertising for alcohol for the first time. The network pledged to donate 30% of the total income received from [[alcohol advertising]] towards alcohol and substance abuse programs in communities.

In 2005, ''Imparja National News'', which primarily covered the news in [[Alice Springs]] in addition to other national and international news stories, was axed. The move was taken in anticipation of the Remote Eastern &amp; Central Australia TV1 licence area being merged with that of [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. Regulations imposed by the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] relating to minimum levels of local news coverage led to 2006 reinstatement of ''Imparja National News''. The news service began broadcasting again from the middle of February 2006, with [[Ryan Liddle]] as presenter.&lt;ref name="alcohol"&gt;{{cite web

In the mid-2000s, it was widely expected that the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] would merge the "[[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]" and "Remote Eastern and Central Australia" commercial television licence areas. This would have most likely seen Imparja Television become a [[Network Ten]] affiliate in Darwin. However, this did not eventuate. Instead [[PBL Media]] and [[Southern Cross Broadcasting]], the two existing Darwin Commercial licence holders were invited to bid individually or together. Their successful joint bid used a company called [[Darwin Digital Television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release
  | title = New digital commercial television service for Darwin
  | publisher = [[Australian Communications and Media Authority|ACMA]]
  | date = 18 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 February 2008, Imparja Television updated its logo removing the emblem, which had been present on the logo for two decades. The logo change coincided with Imparja dropping [[Network Ten]] affiliation, becoming a sole [[Nine Network]] affiliate, in addition to axing ''Imparja National News'', and also adding Nine Network's dots to its new logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="affiliation" /&gt;

===2010s===
On 19 May 2010, the ACMA (Australian Communications and Media Authority) approved a licence for a new remote area digital-only TV channel, a joint venture by Imparja Pty Ltd and Southern Cross Central.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_312142 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=18 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019212642/http://acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc%3DPC_312142 |archivedate=19 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched on 30 June 2010 as "[[Central Digital Television|Ten Central (CDT)]]". It had two feeds, Ten Central North (QLD/NT) and Ten Central South (NSW/SA/Vic/Tas).

In December 2010, Imparja Television began broadcasting on terrestrial digital TV and the new [[Viewer Access Satellite Television|VAST]] satellite service. This expansion included the establishment of two feeds for these platforms, Imparja North (Qld/NT) and Imparja South (NSW/SA/Vic/Tas). As of 2010, their programming is exactly the same.

Imparja Pty Ltd also began to launch digital channels [[9Go!|GO!]] and [[9Gem|GEM]].

As of the moment, Imparja continues to stream the HD feed of [[9Gem]], which was rebranded as a standard definition channel in Nine Network-only on 26 November 2015 in its metropolitan and Darwin stations, along with [[9Life]] and the relaunch of [[9HD]]. There are currently no plans at this stage for Imparja to launch an HD simulcast or introduce 9Life to its viewers. It will continue with its existing lineup of three broadcast channels.

==Programming==

Imparja Television is a sole [[Nine Network]] affiliate. The station previously broadcast both Nine and Ten programming, however it stopped broadcasting [[Network Ten]] programming on 3 February 2008.&lt;ref name="affiliation"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imparja Television has also aired  original programs produced by local Aboriginal community members, such as [[Bush Mechanics]] and the children's program ''[[Yamba's Playtime]]''. Imparja also airs programming relating to local [[Australian rules football]] and community sports, as well as news updates and religious ''thought for the day'' programs. Imparja Television also regularly broadcasts films created by the [[Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association]], which is a shareholder of its parent company.

Imparja's programming schedule is currently based on the Nine Network schedule for Brisbane (based on [[Australian Eastern Standard Time|Eastern Standard Time]]). Prior to February 2008, scheduling was generally based on [[Australian Central Standard Time|Central Standard Time]], reflecting its Alice Springs-based heritage. As a result, programs are now broadcast half an hour earlier than they previously would have been under the previous arrangement.

===News and current affairs===
Imparja does not currently produce its own evening regional news bulletin. In 2008, Imparja replaced ''[[Imparja National News]]'' – a 30-minute, weeknightly program combining local and national/international news – with local news updates, plus a 30-minute local news magazine program, ''Footprints'' (which later ceased production in 2009). The news updates were presented by Emma Groves from 2014 until July 2016. This brings Imparja's daily news service roughly into line with its competitor in the Remote Eastern and Central Australia licence area, [[QQQ|Southern Cross Central (QQQ)]].

The 6:00&amp;nbsp;pm ([[Australian Eastern Standard Time|AEST]]) time slot is filled by a simulcast of ''[[Nine News Queensland]]''. Imparja cites its geographic distribution, with a majority of the remote licence area's viewers now located in Queensland, as a "key factor" in selecting the Queensland bulletin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Imparja began airing the Darwin edition of [[Nine News#Darwin|Nine News]] live at 6:30&amp;nbsp;pm (AEST) on weekdays, immediately following the Brisbane edition, in place of ''[[A Current Affair (Australian TV series)|A Current Affair]]'' – thereby restoring a [[Northern Territory]]-based bulletin to the station.

===Sport===
Imparja airs most sports coverage from the Nine Network, including [[rugby league]], [[cricket]], golf and tennis. The station also broadcast [[motorsport]] and [[Australian rules football]] coverage until 2008.

==Availability==
Imparja Television broadcasts throughout most of the Northern Territory, and also to some remote parts of [[Queensland]], [[New South Wales]], South Australia, [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], [[Tasmania]] and [[Norfolk Island]]. It is generally available by satellite on the [[Viewer Access Satellite Television|VAST]] or [[Optus Aurora]] platforms, though in some locations it is broadcast terrestrially. Imparja Television has the largest geographic range of any commercial television network in Australia. Imparja is also received on the [[TT-Line (Australia)|Spirit of Tasmania]] Bass Strait Ferries.

Imparja Television was previously available in [[New Zealand]] until March 2008 when the New Zealand government pressured the Australian government to remove the service from the satellite footprint that includes New Zealand.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

The total population serviced by Imparja Television is over 700,000 people, boasting the largest footprint in the southern hemisphere.

Imparja is also available in Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea through the HiTRON subscription television service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hitron.com.pg/mmds_2006.html HiTRON Limited – Papua New Guinea :: MMDS TV] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615202949/http://www.hitron.com.pg/mmds_2006.html |date=15 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logos==
Imparja Television's first logo was developed from a painting produced by an [[Arrernte people|Arrernte]] artist and traditional owner. The logo symbolised the [[MacDonnell Ranges]], the [[Todd River]] and the [[Yeperenye caterpillar]].&lt;ref name="aboutlogo"&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7474">'''Information art''' (also '''data art''' or '''informatism''') is an emerging field of [[electronic art]] that synthesizes [[computer science]], [[information technology]], and more classical forms of art, including [[performance art]], [[visual art]], [[new media art]] and [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward A. Shanken]] has argued that little scholarship has explored the relationship between technology and [[conceptual art]]. He also claimed that there was an art-historical impetus to artificially distinguish information art from conceptual art. [[Edward A. Shanken]], 'Art in the Information Age: Technology and Conceptual Art,' in [[Michael Corris]] (ed.), Conceptual Art: Theory, Myth and Practice Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Information Art often includes [[interaction]] with [[computer]]s that generate artistic content based on the processing of large amounts of data.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Charlie Gere]] ''Art, Time and Technology: Histories of the Disappearing Body'' (Berg, 2005). {{ISBN|978-1-84520-135-7}} This text concerns artistic and theoretical responses to the increasing speed of technological development and operation, especially in terms of  draws on the ideas of [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Bernard Stiegler]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and [[André Leroi-Gourhan]], and looks at the work of [[Samuel Morse]], [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Kasimir Malevich]], among others.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[Image:Info1970.jpg|thumb|150px|Kynaston McShine's "Information"]]
Informatism follows on the 1970 exhibition organized by [[Kynaston McShine]] called  "Information", held at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City - a show  that formally established [[conceptual art]] as a leading tendency in the United States. Conceptual art had emerged simultaneously in dozens of international locations around 1966.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Lucy R. Lippard]], ''Six Years: the Dematerialization of the Art Object From 1966 to 1972'' (1973. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time arose the activities of [[Experiments in Art and Technology]] known as E.A.T.&lt;ref&gt;E.A.T. followed from the event Nine Evenings: Theatre and Engineering, organised by [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Billy Klüver]] at the Armoury Building, New York City, 13–22 October 1966 to promote the collaboration between artists and engineers. They also organised the Pepsi Pavilion at the World's Fair, [[Osaka]], in 1970. For a detailed discussion of the project see Bijvoet, Art as Inquiry, ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic practice ==
Information art [[data]] can be manifested using [[photograph]]s, [[census]] data, micropayments, personal profiles and expressions, [[video]] clips, [[search engine]] results, [[digital painting]], network signals, and [[prose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McKeough, Tim|title=Frame That Spam!

'''Insular illumination''' refers to the production of [[illuminated manuscripts]] in the monasteries of Ireland and Great Britain between the 6th and 9th centuries, as well as in monasteries under their influence on continental Europe. It is characterised by decoration strongly influenced by metalwork, the constant use of [[Interlace (art)|interlacing]], and the importance assigned to calligraphy. The most celebrated books of this sort are largely [[gospel book]]s. Around sixty manuscripts are known from this period.

==History==
The [[Insular art|insular artistic style]] began after the conversion of Ireland by [[St Patrick]] in the 4th and 5th centuries AD. The new religious institutions of [[Celtic Christianity]], mostly organised around monasteries, ordered the creation of numerous works of art, liturgical objects and [[vestment]]s, and also manuscripts. Two types of manuscripts dominated: small format gospels to be used by preachers and missionaries or in private worship (e.g. the [[Book of Dimma]] and the [[Book of Mulling]]), and large works, reserved for the liturgical services of the monasteries (such as the [[Book of Kells]]).&lt;ref name="Meehan"&gt;Bernard Meehan, ''Le Livre de Kells'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 1995, {{ISBN|2878110900}}, p. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish monks took part in the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|conversion of Scotland and the north of Great Britain]]], establishing numerous monasteries, such as [[Iona Abbey]], founded by [[Columba]] in Scotland in 563 and [[Lindisfarne]], founded by [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|Aidan]] in [[Northumbria]] in 635. The Irish missionaries brought their art to Britain along with their religion. Over the course of the 6th and 7th centuries, especially after the [[Gregorian mission]], the south of Britain came under the direct influence of continental Christianity, mainly Italian. Some Italian and Byzantine manuscripts came to the island as a result, influencing the development of insular illumination as well.&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, p.96–107&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, the major centres of production were concentrated first in Northumbria, then in southern England and Kent over the 7th and 8th centuries. The monasteries in these places benefited from more conditions which were more prosperous than those in Ireland as well as from the protection and patronage of the Anglo-Saxon kings. The ''[[Scriptorium|scriptoria]]'' of Lindisfarne and Iona were the most prolific at the end of the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, p.25-26&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 7th century, several Irish missionaries led by [[Columbanus]] travelled to the continent and contributed to the creation of several monasteries in France, Switzerland and Northern Italy. Columbanus' disciple, [[Saint Gall]], took part in the foundation of an [[Abbey of Saint Gall|abbey in Switzerland]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|St Kilian of Würzburg|fr|3=Kilian de Wurtzbourg}} was active in southern Germany. All these establishments helped to spread the insular calligraphy and decorative techniques to manuscripts produced on the continent in this period.&lt;ref name="Meehan"/&gt; Often referred to as "{{Interlanguage link multi|Franco-Saxon|fr|3=École franco-saxonne}}", the manuscripts made in northern France in the [[Carolingian]] period also show a direct insular influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bookline-03.valenciennes.fr/bib/decouverte/expositions/expovirtuelle/ecolefrsax.asp|title=L'école franco-insulaire|website=Le scriptorium de l'abbaye de Saint-Amand - Bibliothèque de Valencienne|access-date=23 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821035942/http://bookline-03.valenciennes.fr/bib/decouverte/expositions/expovirtuelle/ecolefrsax.asp|archivedate=21 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Despite the great diversity of origins of manuscripts of the insular style, several common characteristics can be identified.

===Treatment of the parchment===
The treatment of the parchment creates a [[suede]]-like appearance, which makes it very receptive to ink and colour. This treatment was applied to both veal-skin and sheep. It enables both calligraphy and ornamentation.&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, p.14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of ornamental motifs===
The [[Interlace (art)|interlace]] is the best-known motif of insular art. This decoration,  however, is not limited to Celtic art of Insular illumination. It is also seen in some Egyptian papyrus, Byzantine and Italian works and some Anglo-Saxon works of art, like those found in the tomb at [[Sutton Hoo]]. But the use of this pattern in insular manuscripts is almost systematic from the middle of the 7th century onwards. It can fill out the space around other types of illumination, as well as [[initial]]s, frames, margins, and [[carpet page]]s. Different types of interlace can be identified: simple, double, or triple.&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, p.13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Rectilinear motifs include diamonds, chequerboard patterns, clefs and [[Meander (art)|Greek frets]]. Round motifs include circles, spirals, and winding helixes.&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zoomorphic]] motifs generally extend into the interlace: their heads are located at an end and occasionally the rear of the animal reappears at the other end of the interlace. In the earlier manuscripts, their character remains very schematic and it is difficult to identify specific species of animal. From the Lindisfarne Gospels onwards, some kinds of animal begin to appear with more realism, especially dogs and predators, which recall the art of the hunt appreciated by the Anglo-Saxon elite.&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, p.16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Initials ===
The [[Cathach of St. Columba]] (beginning of 7th century) is the oldest extant manuscript with [[initial]]s decorated in the characteristic style of insular illumination: the first letter is incorporated into the text and is followed by other letters whose size decreases until they reach the size of the main text.The initials themselves are decorated with curves, spirals, points and even animal heads. This type of decoration is found in [[Celtic art]] from the [[la Tène]] period onwards and marks the true beginning of the distinction between insular and late antique manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

File:BookDurrowInitMark86r.jpg|Beginning of the [[Gospel of Mark]] in the [[Book of Durrow]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Miniatures===
The earliest insular designs are generally images of the cross, sometimes included in a carpet page. The first representations of individuals in insular manuscripts probably only occur as a result of the influence of works acquired from the continent. Specialists have been able to distinguish several details of these earliest miniatures which are shared with ancient manuscripts of the ''[[Diatessaron]]'' from Persia, which might have come to the British Isles as a result of [[pilgrimage]] to the Near East. Representations of humans are very schematic, with individuals on foot, usually the Evangelists are represented without wings or [[Halo (religious iconography)|nimbus]]. Sometimes their representation is limited to their symbols (lion, cow, eagle, man) depicted in a heraldic manner.&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, p.19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Ithaca Kitty was inspired by a gray [[tabby cat]] named Caesar [[Grimalkin]] in [[Ithaca, New York]]. The cat's owners, William Hazlitt Smith and Celia Smith, had the cat photographed and had Celia's sister-in-law, Charity Smith, paint a likeness of the cat onto a three-piece pattern designed by Celia. Although Grimalkin was a [[polydactyl cat]] with seven toes on each front paw, the Smiths felt that five toes appeared more normal and patented the "toy animal figure" in October 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design was sold by the Smiths for one cent a yard to [[Arnold Print Works]], which then sold the printed pattern as "The Tabby Cat" on half a yard of [[muslin]] for ten cents each in late 1892. Nearly 200,000 were sold that first holiday season. The toy was very successful nationwide, making appearances at the [[1893 Chicago World's Fair]] and in the windows of [[Wanamaker's]] department store in [[Philadelphia]]. The toy's success led to other stuffed animals, including kittens, dogs, and bunnies. The Ithaca Kitty was especially known for its lifelike appearance and was allegedly used by farmers to scare away birds and by the [[Central Park]] police station to scare mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''''Kenan &amp; Kel''''' is an American [[teen]] [[sitcom]] created by [[Kim Bass]] for [[Nickelodeon]]. It starred ''[[All That]]'' cast members [[Kenan Thompson]] and [[Kel Mitchell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A 'Honeymooners' For Kids|author=Hinman, Catherine|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1996-08-17/lifestyle/9608150907_1_kenan-and-kel-kenan-thompson-kel-mitchell|date=August 17, 1996|work=The Orlando Sentinel|accessdate=2011-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 62 episodes and a [[Two Heads Are Better Than None|made-for-TV movie]] were produced over four seasons from 1996 to 2000. The first two seasons were filmed at [[Nickelodeon Studios]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], and the remaining two were filmed at the [[Nickelodeon on Sunset|Nick on Sunset]] theater in [[Hollywood]].

''Kenan &amp; Kel'' received critical acclaim, with praise of the performance of the title characters. It won the "Favorite TV Show" award at the 1998 [[Kids Choice Awards]], and Thompson and Mitchell were ranked No. 40 and No. 39, respectively, on VH1's 100 Greatest Kid Stars. Reruns of the show are currently shown on TeenNick, as part of their programming block ''[[NickSplat]],'' as well as MTV2, a sister channel of TeenNick under Viacom.

==Premise==
The show was set in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and centered on the antics of two mischievous teenagers, Kenan Rockmore ([[Kenan Thompson]]) and Kel Kimble ([[Kel Mitchell]]). Kenan is a high school student with a job at a local grocery store, while Kel is his clumsy, [[orange soda]]-loving best friend.

Episodes of the series always open and closed with Kenan and Kel breaking the [[fourth wall]] by interacting with the studio audience, standing in front of a red curtain that is placed in front of the main set while they are still in character. A frequent running gag of the openings is Kel never knowing what the night's episode would be about and Kenan refusing to tell him. The closings would frequently feature Kenan coming up with a new scheme, often asking Kel to get various assorted items and meet him somewhere. Frazzled, Kel would exclaim his catchphrase, "Aww, here it goes!"

Another catchphrase commonly heard throughout the series is "WHYYYYYYY!?!?", usually screamed by Kenan after Kel does something stupid.

The theme song, entitled "Aw, Here It Goes", is performed by rapper [[Coolio]]. He is featured in the opening credits of the show along with Kenan and Kel. The lyrics describe the show and reference other famous duos such as [[Siegfried &amp; Roy]], [[Abbott &amp; Costello]], [[Penn &amp; Teller]], and former [[Los Angeles Lakers]] teammates [[Magic Johnson]] and [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], as well as [[Nancy Drew]] and [[The Hardy Boys]].

==Production==
The series was created by Kim Bass (who also co-created the teen sitcom ''[[Sister, Sister (TV series)|Sister, Sister]]''). It was reminiscent of the classic [[double act|comedic duo]] stylings of [[Laurel and Hardy]], [[Martin and Lewis]] or Abbott and Costello (who were actually mentioned in the theme song), with Kenan being the straight man and Kel his comedic foil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kenen, Kel Get a Show|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-08-13/features/9608130309_1_smashing-pumpkins-nickelodeon-kenan-thompson|date=August 13, 1996|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=2011-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was taped in front of a live-studio audience and ran from August 17, 1996&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B0172OK1RI/|title=Kenan &amp; Kel Season 1|publisher=[[Amazon (company)|Amazon]]|accessdate=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to July 15, 2000&lt;ref name="amazon5"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B00MEYYLI2/|title=Kenan &amp; Kel Season 5|publisher=[[Amazon (company)|Amazon]]|accessdate=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, totaling 62 episodes. One full-length [[TV movie]] was created, entitled ''Two Heads Are Better Than None'', which aired on July 15, 2000, thus ending the series serving as its finale. The Kenan &amp; Kel characters also made a special guest appearance on the ''[[Cousin Skeeter]]'' two-part episode, "Hoo, I'm Wild Wild West".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0549853/|title="Cousin Skeeter" The Hoo, I'm Wild Wild West: Part 1 (TV Episode 1999)|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcast==
Reruns of the series briefly aired on ''[[Nickelodeon Games and Sports for Kids]]'' in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvschedulearchive.com/other/nick-gas/1999-030099.txt&lt;/ref&gt; After the series finished its run, reruns continued to air on Nickelodeon from January 21, 2001 to February 15, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvschedulearchive.com/nickelodeon/2004/020904.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

The series reran on [[TeenNick|The N]] (later known as TeenNick) from October 13, 2007, to August 2, 2009. It then returned to the channel from July 25, 2011, to February 3, 2013, and again from March 4, 2013, to May 31, 2014, as part of its ''[[The '90s Are All That]]'' programming block (later called [[The Splat]] and now called [[NickSplat]]), which continues to air sporadic reruns.

'''''Les Baigneuses''''' (also known as '''''The Bathers'''''), is a large oil painting created at the outset of 1912 by the French artist, theorist and writer [[Albert Gleizes]] (1881–1953). It was exhibited at the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]] in Paris during the spring of 1912; the Salon de la [[Société Normande de Peinture Moderne]], Rouen, summer 1912; and the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]], autumn 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/viewer/exhibit-catalog-salon-de-la-section-dor-15197 Exhibit catalog for Salon de "La Section d'Or", 1912. Walter Pach papers, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution]&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was reproduced in ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', written by Albert Gleizes and [[Jean Metzinger]] the same year: the first and only manifesto on [[Cubism]]. ''Les Baigneuses'', while still 'readable' in the [[Figurative art|figurative]] or [[Representation (arts)|representational]] sense, exemplifies the mobile, dynamic fragmentation of form and multiple perspective characteristic of Cubism at the outset of 1912. Highly sophisticated, both in theory and in practice, this aspect of [[simultaneity]] would soon become identified with the practices of the [[Section d'Or]] group. Gleizes deploys these techniques in "a radical, personal and coherent manner".&lt;ref name="David Cottington"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=o3vSvh8CytIC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=gleizes+baigneuses&amp;hl=en&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=gleizes%20baigneuses&amp;f=false David Cottington, ''Cubism in the Shadow of War: The Avant-Garde and Politics in Paris, 1905-1914'', Yale University Press, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; Purchased in 1937, the painting is exhibited in the permanent collection of the [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mam.paris.fr/en/online-collections#/artwork/180000000000860 Albert Gleizes, ''Les Baigneuses'', Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris], Online collection entry&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1911, Dessin pour les Baigneuses, published in La Revue de France et des pays français, February - March 1912.jpg|thumb|230px|Albert Gleizes, 1911, ''Dessin pour les Baigneuses'', published in ''La Revue de France et des pays français'', February - March 1912]]
''Les Baigneuses'' is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 105 x 171&amp;nbsp;cm (41.3 by 67.3 inches), signed Albert Gleizes and dated 1912, lower left. This work, painted at the outset of 1912, represents a series of naked elegant women at various points in the landscape foreground, their reflections along with the blue of the sky echoing off the water at the lower edge of the canvas. Beyond the bathers can be observed protruding rock-like formations or boulders—with highlights of [[primary color]]—that appear to espouse elements of the foreground. Above these cliffs are found several [[deciduous]] woody plants of the genus [[Populus]]. Though native to many areas of the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the Poplar, with its fastigiate branches tapered towards the top, is especially iconic of the western suburbs of Paris (''la [[banlieue]] ouest'') where Gleizes lived, 24 Avenue Gambetta, [[Courbevoie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/images/detail/armory-show-entry-form-albert-gleizes-painting-la-femme-aux-phlox-14516 Armory Show entry form for Albert Gleizes' painting ''La Femme aux Phlox''], not after 1913. Walt Kuhn family papers, and Armory Show records, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution. Document shows Gleizes' address&lt;/ref&gt; The Gleizes family moved to Avenue Gambetta in 1887.&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/a%26rintro Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953'']&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the 19th century and extending through the early 20th century, Courbevoie witnessed a rapid growth in population, and a surge in the development of crafts, industry and transport (including rail). Such a scene of naked bathers actually occurring would have been highly unlikely in Courbevoie, or anywhere else near the Parisian capital.

===Optimistic reconciliation===
''Les Baigneuses''—as [[Robert Delaunay]]'s 1912 ''City of Paris'', and to some extent [[Jean Metzinger]]'s 1913 ''Meudon Landscape''—juxtaposes sharply contrasting elements. On the one hand the artist includes elements from a society in the process of inexorable industrialization, and on the other, the sereneness of timeless classical nude figures (something rarely painted by Gleizes, as Brooke points out). Yet the relationships between the two are formally resolved. This aspect of simultaneity—the optimistic reconciliation of classical tradition and contemporary life—was of particular interest to Gleizes, as it was to the [[Section d'Or]] group of Cubists (also known as the Passy group, or Puteaux group).&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/albertgleizes1881robb Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 - 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The background forms a semi-urban landscape that possesses both rural and semi-industrial components, consistent with Courbevoie of the 1910s (except perhaps for the rock-like outcrops), a village or town with delicate smokestacks or factory chimneys billowing smoke that blends into the cloudy sky. Evidence that factories were already located on the Seine can be seen in Gleizes' ''Péniches et fumées à Courbevoie'' of 1908.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondationgleizes.fr/fr/gleize/page/albert-gleizes/son-uvre Albert Gleizes, 1908, ''Péniches et fumées à Courbevoie'', Fondation Albert Gleizes, Paris]&lt;/ref&gt; The statuesque nudes themselves are highly stylized, divided into geometrized facets, planes and curves, yet they are graceful, balletic and elegant. The source of light, rather than beaming down from one particular direction, appears to emanate from within the canvas itself, with an intensification in the vicinity of the bathers.

[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1912, Les Baigneuses (The Bathers) vs. Courbevoie, ca.1912, Les Bord de Seine, L'Ile de la Jatte.jpg|thumb|right|450px|Albert Gleizes, 1912, ''Les Baigneuses, The Bathers'', (left) vs. [[Courbevoie]], postcard ca.1912, Les Bord de Seine, L'Ile de la Jatte (right). The [[Île de la Jatte]] (or Île de la Grande Jatte) is an island over which Gleizes would have passed on his way to and from the center of Paris. The island is well known as the setting for [[Georges Seurat]]'s ''[[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte]]'' (1884), and his ''[[Bathers at Asnières]]'', in the background of which smoke emanating from industrial factories of [[Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine|Clichy]] can be observed; just as in Gleizes' ''Baigneuses'']]
Gleizes painted [[:fr:Île de la Jatte|L'île de la Jatte]] many times since 1901 and on at least five occasions between 1907 to 1912:

* 1907–1909, ''L'île de la Grande Jatte ou Bord de parc avec rivière animée de canots'', pastel pierre noire and ink on bistre paper, {{nobr|25 × 41.5 cm}}, private collection
* 1908, ''Péniches et fumées à Courbevoie'', Crayon, ink and gouache on paper, 23 x 32.5&amp;nbsp;cm, Fondation Albert Gleizes (Paris)
* 1908, ''L'île de la Grande Jatte'', fusain and gouache on rose paper, {{nobr|25 × 41.5 cm}}, [[Musée national d'art moderne]] (Paris)
* 1908, ''La Seine près de Courbevoie'', oil on canvas, {{nobr|54 × 65 cm}}, [[:fr:Musée Roybet Fould|Musée Roybet Fould]] (Courbevoie)
* 1908, ''Barque à Courbevoie'', fusain and chalk on paper, 30 x 38&amp;nbsp;cm, art market (Paris)

The subject matter of ''Les Baigneuses'', much as that of his monumental ''[[Harvest Threshing]]'' of the same year, is derived from an unsentimental observation of the world.&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke" /&gt;

Gleizes' interest centered on many things in the years leading up to 1912, one of which was the dynamic qualities of modern urban life. ''Les Baigneuses'', depicts "a harmonious and balanced landscape in which industrial and urban elements are imbricated with the surrounding countryside;" writes Cottington in ''Cubism in the Shadow of War'', "Poussinesque in its organizing geometry and Claudian in its specificity of place, this is the landscape not of Arcadia but of France as Gleizes wished it to be."&lt;ref name="David Cottington" /&gt; Gleizes' formal innovations seen in this work are more closely related to the Salon Cubists ([[Jean Metzinger]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]] and [[Fernand Léger]]) than to those of the Gallery Cubists ([[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]]).

The gestures of the bathers in the 'foreground' and the whirls of chimney-smoke in the 'background' are unified expressively through "a timeless and purportedly natural order." While the subject was "explicit in its reference to latinist classicism" writes Cottington, "and implicit in its rejection of the avant-gardist challenge of the [[Futurism|futurists]] to avoid the pictorial representation of the nude as inescapably ''passé"'', he continues, "the presence of emblems of industrialization, not juxtaposed but integrated with the rhythms of the landscape, marked a definite, if tentative, departure from the concerns he had shared with Le Fauconnier."&lt;ref name="David Cottington" /&gt; Gleizes made use of fragmentation of form, multiple perspective views (i.e., mobile and dynamic, rather than static and from one point-of-view) along with linear and planar structural qualities. Though highly sophisticated in theory, this aspect of [[simultaneity]] would actually become quite commonly employed within the practices of the [[Section d'Or]] group. Gleizes deployed these techniques in ''"a radical, personal and coherent manner"'' (Cottington, 1998).&lt;ref name="David Cottington" /&gt;

==1912==
[[File:Recoveredgleizes.jpg|thumb|left|Albert Gleizes, 1911, ''Le Chemin, Paysage à Meudon, Paysage avec personnage'', oil on canvas, 146.4 x 114.4 cm. Exhibited at Salon des Indépendants, Paris, 1911, Salon des Indépendants, Brussels, 1911, [[Galeries Dalmau]], Barcelona, 1912, Galerie La Boétie, Salon de La Section d'Or, 1912, stolen by Nazi occupiers from the home of collector Alphonse Kann during World War II, returned to its rightful owners in 1997]]
For Gleizes and those of his entourage 1912 signified a climax in the debates centering around [[modernism]] and [[classicism]] – [[Henri Bergson|Bergson]] and [[Nietzsche]] – [[Euclid]] and [[Riemann]] – [[nationalism]] and [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalism]] – [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] and [[four-dimensional space]]. It was precisely during 1912 that Gleizes and Metzinger would write the seminal treatise ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' (Cubism's only manifesto),&lt;ref name="David Cottington" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, ''Du "Cubisme"'', published by Eugène Figuière, Paris, 1912, translated to English and Russian in 1913]&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt "to put a little order into the chaos of everything that had been written in the papers and reviews since 1911", to use the words of Gleizes.&lt;ref name="Brooke, P."&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/gltexts/epic Albert Gleizes, 1925, ''The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form''], published in German, 1928, under the title ''Kubismus'', the French version was published as ''L'Epopée (The Epic)'', in the journal ''Le Rouge et le Noir'', 1929. Translation by Peter Brooke&lt;/ref&gt;

It was both as artists and theorists (in painting and writing) that Gleizes and Metzinger expressed their critical and ideological discourse about the possible meanings and significance of [[Cubism]] and contemporary aesthetics. Indeed, ''Du "Cubisme"'' was much more than an unorthodox or anti-academic explanation of the avant-gardist innovations seen in Cubist paintings.

It was natural that Gleizes and Metzinger, both articulate men, should come not just to theorize on the meaning of Cubism, but to defend the movement against attacks leveled in the wake of the 1911 public exhibitions. The two had exhibited regularly at the important salons ([[Salon d'Automne]] and [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]]) since around 1903 and held divers official positions within them (e.g., hanging committee members). Both were well-versed in philosophy, mathematics and poetry. While Metzinger had participated in discussions at the [[Bateau Lavoir]] (from 1907), both he and Gleizes were largely responsible for the impression made by the Cubists on the general public during both the Salon des Indépendants and Salon d'Automne of 1910 and 1911 respectively. Intellectual and moral support for their endeavors came from members of the [[Section d'Or]] (Groupe de Puteaux).&lt;ref name="Herschel Browning Chipp"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UZ4Gu7a7V9UC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213&amp;dq=%22discern+and+that+which+pre-exists+within+us%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F-vrNN6wHd&amp;sig=ULAMPMqjUeA5We6bwoHDI-Rkfyc&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22discern%20and%20that%20which%20pre-exists%20within%20us%22&amp;f=false Herschel Browning Chipp, with contributions by Peter Howard Selz and Joshua C.

In contrast, Picasso and Braque remained unknown to the general public and made no recorded statements during the crucial pre-War period. Braque's first brief aphoristic statement regarding Cubism was written in 1917 during his gradual return to health following a head-wound during the war. Picasso's first recorded statement on Cubism is dated 1923, at a time when [[Dada]], [[Surrealism]] and [[Abstract art]] had become fashionable.&lt;ref name="Herschel Browning Chipp" /&gt;

By 1912 art had become much more than a dialogue between ''artist'' and ''nature''. "The three dimensions of sensorial volume", Gleizes would write in 1925, "left open the field for the introduction of the time factor".&lt;ref name="Albert Gleizes"&gt;Albert Gleizes, ''"Cubisme", Vers une conscience plastique, Essai de généralisation'', 1925, in Bulletin de l'Effort Moderne, 22–32, February 1926–Feb 1927. Also published in ''La Vie des Lettres et des Arts'', May 1925 (written as part of the Bauhaus book, ''Kubismus''). See too Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes: For and Against the Twentieth Century'', 2001, {{ISBN|0-300-08964-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The diversity of the relations of line to line must be indefinite;" write Gleizes and Metzinger, "on this condition it incorporates quality, the incommensurable sum of the affinities perceived between that which we discern and that which pre-exists within us: on this condition a work of art is able to move us".&lt;ref name="Herschel Browning Chipp" /&gt;

==Cézanne==
[[File:Paul Cézanne 048.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Cézanne]], ''Bathers (Les Grandes Baigneuses)'', 1894–1905, oil on canvas, 127.2 × 196.1 cm. [[National Gallery]], London]]
Cézanne, progressively leading up to 1906, moved away from classic pictorial arrangements, single view perspectives, and outlines that enclosed color. His attempt was to arrive at a "lived perspective" by capturing all the complexities that could be observed with the eye and captured by the senses, where both "sight" and "touch" became one. Cèzanne believed his paintings could capture a moment in time, that once passed it was gone, that art and nature are the same. Cèzanne claimed: "Art is a personal apperception, which I embody in sensations and which I ask the understanding to organize into a painting." The true meaning of painting grew closer as the distance from tradition increased. Just as the Cubists he would inspire, Cèzanne had little interest in the rational naturalistic painting and classical geometrical perspective inherited from the Renaissance. "Nor was he satisfied," writes Merleau-Ponty, "with the attempts of the Impressionists to dissolve this objective order into its original elements of light and atmosphere".[sic]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=odF1-rgcyRsC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=%22Art+is+a+personal+apperception,+which+I+embody+in+sensations%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JQcyvfr0PD&amp;sig=4MeurqRfE5fTl03Rajq6o-z3_3w&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Art%20is%20a%20personal%20apperception%2C%20which%20I%20embody%20in%20sensations%22&amp;f=false Maurice Merleau-Ponty, ''Sense and Non-sense''], Northwestern University Studies in Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy, Northwestern University Press, IL, 1964.

==Staticity and dynamism==
[[File:Paul Cézanne 004.jpg|thumb|left|[[Paul Cézanne]], ''Bathers'', 1874–1875, oil on canvas, 38.1 × 46 cm (15 × 18.1 in), [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York City]]
The preoccupations of Gleizes, to considerable extent beyond those emancipated by Cézanne, was to play with the mobile, dynamic, changing aspects of the same form relative to the position of the painter.&lt;ref name="Albert Gleizes" /&gt;

''Les Baigneuses'', along with other compositions by Gleizes and his fellow Salon Cubists from this period (1911-1912), tend to coordinate a variety of views of the same subject, or a [[Multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicity]] (in the [[Henri Bergson|Bergsonian]] sense) of different angles in one picture. This attempt clearly shows the importance of both the ''time'' element and the ''mobile'' properties in the sequence of events. According to Gleizes, the artist would accommodate either several successive moments in time projected onto a single space, or multiple spaces projected onto the canvas at the same time. These [[kinematic]] compositions that took into account both staticity and dynamism were not just a new description of the external world created by the artist, but also the inner world.&lt;ref name="Albert Gleizes" /&gt;

Paintings of the Renaissance could not entirely convey these aspects of the world since their subjects were immobilized in a depiction based on one unique point of view; but the real world better corresponds to multiplicity of vision (we have two eyes). And here is precisely where an ambiguity or uncertainty arises as regards interpretation. This period was in fact marked by the unification of disparate concepts. Classical perspective and non-Euclidean geometry were not, after all, incompatible with one another. [[File:Albert Gleizes, 1912, Les Baigneuses, oil on canvas, 105 x 171 cm, Paris, Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Albert Gleizes, 1912, ''Les Baigneuses'']]
[[File:Eadweard Muybridge, Plate 187 – Dancing, fancy, no. 12, Miss Larrigan.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Eadweard Muybridge]], 1887, ''Animal Locomotion'', Plate 187, Dancing, fancy, no. 12, Miss Larrigan]]
[[File:Nude woman washing face, animated from Animal locomotion, Vol. IV, Plate 413 by Eadweard Muybridge.gif|thumb|right|130px|[[Eadweard Muybridge]], 1887, ''Animal locomotion''. Plate 413, Woman washing, Collotypes; Motion study photographs]] The former was simply viewed as a special case contained within a more general concept. Reconciliation between the static classical and modern mobile approach was attainable since within the representation of successive states of an event could be found repeated images fixed for all time (as in the overlapping of several static images). Just as the dynamism of a ''motion picture'' results from a succession of still shots, the Cubists stance expounded by Gleizes and Metzinger on theoretical and plastic fronts, consisted of capturing the subject matter or object in a series of 'still shots' (static images) and suturing them together (i.e., several successive moments in time projected onto a single space). Likewise, or alternatively, the artist could depict (multiple spaces projected onto the canvas simultaneously).&lt;ref name="Albert Gleizes" /&gt;

There is a subtle difference or distinction between these two types of simultaneity Gleizes describes that deserve closer attention: inscribed onto the canvas could be either (1) the [[properties]] of two or more [[Event (philosophy)|instantiations]] or [[Event (relativity)|physical occurrence]] happening at the same [[time]] from the point of view of one [[frame of reference]] (the artist fixed in one position), or (2) the artist could inscribe (paint) the properties of one event represented over a succession of time intervals, observed from several frame of reference (or multiple points of view simultaneously expressed onto the canvas), meaning that the observational reference frame is tied to the state of motion of an observer. There are shared variables between the two concepts, involving the flow of time, i.e., temporal in nature, and involving motion (on the part of either the artist or subject), spatial in nature.

This ''cinématique'' nomenclature offered to the spectator several views of an isolated event, of the same subject, or similarly, several different subjects, a series of events, observed from one point of view. No longer was the artist restricted to a principle (or set of principles). The liberation from academicism offered by Cubism, as instigated by [[Cézanne]], resulted from the fact that the artist was no longer restricted to the representation of the subject (or the world) as seen in a photograph. No longer restricted to the imitative description of nature, and despite the complexification of visual stimuli (many views instead of one), the technique of painting became simple and direct.&lt;ref name="Albert Gleizes" /&gt;

In 1912 the photographic motion studies of [[Eadweard Muybridge]] and [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] particularly interested artists of the [[Section d'Or]], including Jean Metzinger, [[Marcel Duchamp]] and Albert Gleizes. A predecessor to cinematography and moving film, [[chronophotography]] involved a series or succession of different images, originally created and used for the scientific study of movement. These chronophotographs included a series of dancers and women washing. Though Gleizes may not have seen these specific photographs he was likely interested in the same idea, as were the [[Futurism|Futurist]]s. The motion picture with its cinematic techniques was developing too at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warholstars.org/abstractexpressionism/artists/duchamp/marcelduchamp.html Katherine Kuh, ''Marcel Duchamp'', interview broadcast on the BBC program 'Monitor', 29 March 1961, published in Katherine Kuh (ed.), ''The Artist's Voice. Talks with Seventeen '', Harper &amp; Row, New York 1962, pp. 81-93]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Co7ipk-yOs0C&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=Muybridge,+cubism&amp;hl=en&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Muybridge%2C%20cubism&amp;f=false Stephen Kern, The Culture of Time and Space, 1880-1918: With a New Preface'', Harvard University Press, Nov 30, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jay, Bill, ''Eadweard Muybridge, The Man Who Invented Moving Pictures'', Little, Brown, and Company, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a ''scientifique'' nomenclature offered to the spectator (the [[relativity of simultaneity]]), that artists themselves, art critics and art historians have not failed to notice. Some have attempted to refute such connections and others have embraced them. Though the name [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] was not yet a household word in 1912, there has been a rapprochement of the concept of multiplicity described above and the concept of relativity in the Einsteinian sense. While, as Einstein writes, the physicist can generally limit herself to one system of coordinates for the description of physical reality, the Cubist (particularly Gleizes and Metzinger) attempted to show the simultaneity of several such views, or, at the very least, they were unwilling to commit themselves to a single coordinate system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1578661 Paul M. Laporte, ''Cubism and Relativity with a Letter of Albert Einstein''], Introduction by Rudolf Arnheim.

==Salon des Indépendants, 1912==
At the 1912 [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]] Albert Gleizes exhibited ''Les Baigneuses'' (no. 1347) — [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''Nu descendant l'escalier'' was listed in the catalogue (n. 1001)&lt;ref&gt;[http://aulivrebleu.unblog.fr/page/2/ Hommage à Marcel Duchamp, Boîte-en-catalogue, 1912-2012, Salon des Indépendants, 1912, n. 1001 of the catalogue, Marcel Duchamp, ''Nu descendant l’escalier'']&lt;/ref&gt; but was supposedly withdrawn — [[Roger de La Fresnaye]] exhibited ''Artillerie'' (no. 1235) — [[Robert Delaunay]] showed his monumental ''Ville de Paris'' (no. 868) — [[Jean Metzinger]] exhibited ''[[La Femme au Cheval|La Femme au Cheval (Woman with a horse)]]'' and ''Le Port'' — [[Fernand Léger]] showed ''La Noce'' — [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], ''Le Chasseur (The Huntsman)'' — and the newcomer [[Juan Gris]] exhibited his ''Portrait of Picasso''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt323.html Salon des Indépendants, 1912, kubisme.info]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joyeux-Prunel"&gt;[http://histoiremesure.revues.org/2333?lang=en Béatrice Joyeux-Prunel, Histoire &amp; Mesure, no. XXII -1 (2007)], Guerre et statistiques, L'art de la mesure, Le Salon d'Automne (1903-1914), l'avant-garde, ses étranger et la nation française (The Art of Measure: The Salon d'Automne Exhibition (1903-1914), the Avant-Garde, its Foreigners and the French Nation), electronic distribution Caim for Éditions de l'EHESS (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

The art critic Olivier-Hourcade writes of this exhibition in 1912 and its relation to the creation of a new French school: 'Metzinger with his ''Port'', Delaunay with ''Paris'', Gleizes with his ''Baigneuses, are close to this real and magnificent result, this victory comes from several centuries: the creation of a school of painting, 'French' and absolutely independent.&lt;ref name="Joyeux-Prunel" /&gt;
[[File:La Section d'Or exhibition, 1925, Galerie Vavin-Raspail, Paris.jpg|thumb|300px|La Section d'Or exhibition, 1925, Galerie Vavin-Raspail, Paris. Gleizes' ''[[Portrait de l’éditeur Eugène Figuière (Gleizes)|Portrait de Eugène Figuière]]'', ''[[La Chasse (painting)|La Chasse (The Hunt)]]'', and ''Les Baigneuses'' are seen towards the center]]
Gleizes, on the other hand, would write the following year (1913) of the movements continual evolution:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The changes it had already undergone since the Indépendants of 1911 could leave people in no doubt as to its nature. Cubism was not a school, distinguished by some superficial variation on a generally accepted norm. It was a total regeneration, indicating the emergence of a wholly new cast of mind. Every season it appeared renewed, growing like a living body. Its enemies could, eventually, have forgiven it if only it had passed away, like a fashion; but they became even more violent when they realised that it was destined to live a life that would be longer than that of those painters who had been the first to assume the responsibility for it.&lt;ref name="Brooke, P." /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Never had a crowd been seen thrown into such a turmoil by works of the spirit, and especially over esemplastic works, paintings, whose nature it is to be silent", writes Albert Gleizes, "Never had the critics been so violent as they were at that time. From which it became clear that these paintings—and I specify the names of the painters who were, alone, the reluctant causes of all this frenzy: Jean Metzinger, Henri Le Fauconnier, Fernand Léger, Robert Delaunay and myself—appeared as a threat to an order that everyone thought had been established forever."&lt;ref name="Brooke, P." /&gt;

The '''''Madonna of the Magnificat''''', {{lang-it|Madonna del Magnificat}}, is a painting of circular or ''[[tondo (art)|tondo]]'' form by the [[Italian Renaissance]] painter [[Sandro Botticelli]]. It is now in the galleries of the [[Uffizi]], in [[Florence]].

The work portrays the Virgin Mary crowned by two angels. She is writing the opening of the ''[[Magnificat]]'' on the right-hand page of a book; on the left page is part of the ''[[Benedictus (Song of Zechariah)|Benedictus]]''. In her left hand she holds a [[pomegranate]].&lt;ref name=susan/&gt; Mary is thought to be a portrait of [[Lucrezia Tornabuoni]], wife of [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero de' Medici]], and the two angels holding the book to be her sons [[Lorenzo il Magnifico|Lorenzo]] and [[Giuliano de' Medici|Giuliano]].
In his book 'The Agony and The Ecstasy', about Michelangelo's life, the writer Irwing Stone, who spent several years living in Florence, Italy, claims that the painting was actually made for Medici family at the time.

==History==
The history of the painting is not known. It was acquired by the Uffizi in 1785 from Ottavio Magherini.&lt;ref name=uffizi2/&gt; It may have come from one of the many monasteries suppressed by the [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Pietro Leopoldo]]. It has been identified with the ''tondo'' in the church of [[San Salvatore al Monte|San Francesco al Monte]] mentioned by [[Vasari]] and Bocchi, but the description does not coincide and this identification is usually rejected. There are several copies of the painting, including one in the [[Louvre]], one in the [[Pierpont Morgan Library]] in New York.&lt;ref name=uffizi/&gt;

The '''National Performing Arts School''' ('''NPAS''') is located in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]].  The school is for students aged from 2 to 22 years old. Courses available include [[drama]], [[singing]] and [[dancing]]. Every two years a show is performed in the [[Olympia Theatre, Dublin|Olympia Theatre]]. The NPAS is run by Jill Doyle and Eamon Farrell (brother of [[Colin Farrell]]). They also run various workshops throughout the year.

== Location ==
NPAS is located in 'The Factory;' Ireland’s most famous rehearsal, recording and performance space. It opened 25 years ago with [[U2]] rehearsing their Rattle and Hum world tour, and has gone from strength to strength since then, with everyone from [[Britney Spears]] to [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], and [[The Abbey Theatre]] to [[Riverdance]] rehearsing there. A little rough round the edges, with a Studio to suit every purpose, The Factory is said to have "an energy like no where you’ve ever been!!" &lt;ref&gt;National Performing Arts School Website: {{cite web |url=http://new.npas.ie/about-me/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128114728/http://new.npas.ie/about-me/ |archivedate=2015-01-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Outdoor literature''' is a [[literature]] genre about or involving the outdoors. Outdoor literature encompasses several different [[literature|subgenre]]s including exploration literature, adventure literature, mountain literature and [[nature writing]]. Another subgenre is the [[guide book]], an early example of which was [[Thomas West (priest)|Thomas West]]'s guide to the [[Lake District]] published in 1778.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas West, (1821) [1778]. ''A Guide to the Lakes in Cumberland, Westmorland, and Lancashire''. Kendal: W. Pennington.&lt;/ref&gt; The genres can include activities such as exploration, survival, [[sailing]], [[hiking]], [[mountaineering]], [[whitewater]] boating, [[geocaching]] or [[kayaking]], or writing about nature and the environment.  [[Travel literature]] is similar to outdoor literature but differs in that it does not always deal with the out-of-doors, but there is a considerable overlap between these genres, in particular with regard to long journeys.

==History==
[[Henry David Thoreau]]'s ''[[Walden]]'' (1854) is an early and influential work. Although not entirely an outdoor work (he lived in a cabin close to civilization) he expressed the ideas of why  people go out into the wilderness to camp, backpack and hike: to get away from the rush of modern society and simplify life. This was a new perspective for the time and thus ''Walden'' has had a lasting influence on most outdoor authors.

{{quote|Thoreau's careful observations and devastating conclusions have rippled into time, becoming stronger as the weaknesses Thoreau noted have become more pronounced […] Events that seem to be completely unrelated to his stay at Walden Pond have been influenced by it, including the national park system, the British labour movement, the creation of India, the civil rights movement, the hippie revolution, the environmental movement, and the wilderness movement. Today, Thoreau's words are quoted with feeling by liberals, socialists, anarchists, libertarians, and conservatives alike.| [[Ken Kifer]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phred.org/~alex/kenkifer/www.kenkifer.com/thoreau/index.htm Analysis and Notes on Walden]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Walden Pond, 2010.jpg|thumb|[[Walden Pond]] ]]
[[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes]]'' (1879), about his travels in [[Cévennes]] (France), is among the first popular books to present hiking and camping as recreational activities, and tells of commissioning one of the first [[sleeping bag]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Travel with a Donkey in the Cevennes'' (1879); Re the first sleeping bag in 1876 [http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/gh5qCU47Ryyc2fOqSjKiLw]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the world of sailing [[Joshua Slocum]]'s ''[[Sailing Alone Around the World]]'' (1900) is a classic of outdoor literature.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Slocum Society: [http://www.joshuaslocumsocietyintl.org].&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1895, Joshua Slocum set sail from [[Boston, Massachusetts]] and in  ''Sailing Alone Around the World'',&lt;ref name=SailingAlone&gt;Slocum (1899), ''Sailing Alone Around the World''&lt;/ref&gt; he described his departure:

{{quote|I had resolved on a voyage around the world, and as the wind on the morning of April 24, 1895 was fair, at noon I weighed anchor, set sail, and filled away from Boston, where the ''Spray'' had been moored snugly all winter. […] A thrilling pulse beat high in me. My step was light on deck in the crisp air. I felt there could be no turning back, and that I was engaging in an adventure the meaning of which I thoroughly understood.}}

More than three years later, on June 27, 1898, he returned to [[Newport, Rhode Island]], having [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] the world, a distance of more than 46,000 miles (74,000&amp;nbsp;km).

The [[National Outdoor Book Award]] was established in 1997 as a [[United States|US]]-based non-profit program which each year honours the best in outdoor writing and publishing.&lt;ref&gt;National Outdoor Book Awards Official site:[http://www.noba-web.org/PastWins.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Paper Heart''''' is a 2009 American [[romantic comedy]] film starring [[Charlyne Yi]] and [[Michael Cera]] as fictionalized versions of themselves based on their rumored relationship, though Yi has said they never dated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/charlyne-yi-admits-relationship-paper-heart-co-star-michael-cera-article-1.398380 New York Daily News]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/07/movies/07paper.html?_r=0 The New York Times review]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/02/movies/02itzk.html The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot for the film is based on Charlyne Yi's original idea of a documentary, which Nick Jasenovec suggested would be accentuated with a fictional storyline.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Last Call with Carson Daly]]'' episode 1036&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' episode 94&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:JakeJohnsonCharlyneYiNickJasenovecByPhilKonstantin.jpg|thumb|left|Jake Johnson, Charlyne Yi, and Nick Jasenovec]]
The film follows Charlyne as she embarks on a quest across America to make a documentary about a subject she does not understand: love. As she and her good friend (and director) Nick search for answers and advice about love, Charlyne talks with friends, strangers, scientists, bikers, romance novelists, and children. They each offer diverse views on modern romance, as well as various answers to the age-old question: does true love really exist?

Shortly after filming begins, Charlyne meets a boy after her own heart: Michael Cera. As their relationship develops on camera, her pursuit to discover the nature of love takes on a fresh new urgency.

'''Paul Zarifopol''' (November 30, 1874 – May 1, 1934) was a [[Romania]]n literary and social critic, essayist, and literary historian. The scion of an aristocratic family, formally trained in both philology and the [[sociology of literature]], he emerged in the 1910s as a rebel, highly distinctive, voice among the Romanian press and book reviewers. He was a confidant and publisher of the Romanian writer [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], building his theories on Caragiale's already trenchant appraisals of Romanian society and culture. Zarifopol defended [[art for art's sake]] even against the [[Marxism]] of his father-in-law, [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]], and the [[Poporanism]] of his friend, [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]]. He was also a noted censurer of [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] trends, of [[philistinism]], and of inauthentic customs, advocating renewal, but not revolution. A skeptic reviewer of [[modernist literature]], he reemerged during the interwar as its dedicated promoter, but his preference for literary entertainment over substance and many of his literary bets were shortly dismissed by other experts of the day.

Zarifopol endures in cultural memory as an eccentric—not just because he tackled and derided the literary establishment, but also because he refused to publish most of his work in book form, or take up employment in academia. Having lost a considerable fortune, he lived withdrawn from the public eye, surviving on his revenues as a literary columnist, mostly for Ibrăileanu's ''[[Viața Românească]]''. Shortly before his death, he set up his own successful magazine, ''[[Revista Fundațiilor Regale]]''. In such venues, Zarifopol defended his cosmopolitan philosophy against other philologists, but also against the emerging neotraditionalists at ''[[Gândirea]]'' journal. Zarifopol viewed modern traditionalism as a fabrication and, with his essays, came out as a non-traditionalist and anti-[[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] conservative thinker.

==Biography==
===Origins and early life===
The future critic was born in [[Iași]] to Paul (Pavel) Zarifopol, or "Zarifopoulo", and his wife Elena (''née'' Culiano). His paternal family had attested [[Greeks in Romania|Greek]],&lt;ref name="izjnote"&gt;"Biographical Note", in Ilinca Zarifopol-Johnston, ''Searching For Cioran'', p. 271. Bloomington: [[Indiana University Press]], 2009.  {{ISBN|978-0-253-35267-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more generically "southern" or [[Balkans|Balkan]],&lt;ref name="evmicle"&gt;{{ro icon}} Elena Vulcănescu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/VULCANESCUsep10.html "Veronica Micle era bunică. Documente și corespondență inedite"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mircea Muthu]], "Discussions. Sur le roman historique balkanique et sud-est européen", in ''Revue Des Études Sud-est Européennes'', Nr. 1/1977, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; roots. Originally horse traders and assignees for [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] settled in [[Moldavia]], they were elevated into the [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|Moldavian boyar nobility]] after 1850.&lt;ref name="izjnote"/&gt;

On his mother's Culiano side, Paul was related to prestigious literary and political figures. One of Elena's brothers&lt;ref name="evmicle"/&gt; was [[Nicolae Culianu]], the boyar, astronomer, and doyen of ''[[Junimea]]'' literary society, great-grandfather of the religious scholar-novelist [[Ioan Petru Culianu]].&lt;ref&gt;Ted Anton, ''Eros, Magic, &amp; the Murder of Professor Culianu'', pp. 31–32, 233. Evanston: [[Northwestern University Press]], 1996.  {{ISBN|0-8101-1396-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His other maternal uncle, who remained closest to Elena, was jurist Ștefan "Nei" Stamatiu-Culianu, also a ''Junimea'' man. A sister of theirs, Maria Nanu, was the wife of landowner Gheorghe Nanu—making Paul Jr a first cousin of poet [[D. Nanu]].&lt;ref name="evmicle"/&gt;

The elder Zarifopol managed the estates of [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Moldavian Prince]] [[Mihail Sturdza]] in [[Cristești, Iași|Cristești]]. It was there that he and Elena met. According to scholar Elena Vulcănescu, it is possible that Paul Jr was not his natural son, but born to Elena from a liaison with General [[Grigore Sturdza]], heir to the Sturdza estate.&lt;ref name="evmicle"/&gt; Zarifopol eventually bought for himself the [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] manor and Sturdza property at [[Filipești|Cârligi]], near [[Roman, Romania|Roman]], then a townhouse in Iași, where he and Stamatiu-Culianu managed Borta Rece tavern.&lt;ref name="evststam"&gt;{{ro icon}} Elena Vulcănescu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/VULCANESCUmar12.htm "La un portret inedit al junimistului Ștefan Stamatiu-Culianu zis Nei"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; His brothers George and Ștefan Zarifopol both had careers in local politics—the former, a Paris-trained agronomist,&lt;ref name="evmicle"/&gt; as a [[Prefect (Romania)|Prefect]], the latter as a delegate to [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber]].&lt;ref name="evststam"/&gt; Paul Sr was the great-uncle of poet [[Dimitrie Anghel]];&lt;ref name="evmicle"/&gt; another of his nephews, Alexandru Zarifopol, was the adoptive father of writer [[Alexandru Paleologu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Tudorel Urian, [http://www.romlit.ro/familia_paleologu_ipoteze_legende_fantezii_ii "Familia Paleologu: ipoteze, legende, fantezii (II)"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 45/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Sr died in 1881,&lt;ref&gt;Săndulescu, p. 408&lt;/ref&gt; leaving Stamatiu in charge of family affairs.&lt;ref name="evststam"/&gt; Their family fortune helped finance both sides of the family, and the Culianu children were all educated abroad.&lt;ref name="evmicle"/&gt; Paul Jr himself graduated from ''Junimea''{{'}}s ''Institutele-Unite'' private high school,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 910&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the literature faculty of [[Iași University]], from 1892 to 1898.&lt;ref name="sasu"&gt;[[Mircea Muthu]], "Zarifopol Paul", in Aurel Sasu (ed.), ''Dicționarul biografic al literaturii române'', Vol. II, pp. 868–869. Pitești: [[Editura Paralela 45]], 2004.  {{ISBN|973-697-758-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his published debut in [[Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol]]'s ''Arhiva'' in 1897, with a review of a historiographical work by [[Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville]].&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodica Florea, "Reviste și scriitori în ultimele două decenii ale secolului al XIX-lea", in [[Șerban Cioculescu]], [[Ovidiu Papadima]], [[Alexandru Piru]] (eds.), ''Istoria literaturii române. III: Epoca marilor clasici'', p. 975. Bucharest: [[Editura Academiei]], 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, he wrote a short story, ''Povestea Moșului'' ("The Tale of the Old Man"). Well-liked by his literary friends [[Gheorghe T. Kirileanu]] and [[Paul Bujor]], it was published in ''Carmen Sylva'' magazine under the pen name of "Z.".&lt;ref&gt;Cristina Bădară, "G. T. Kirileanu în colecțiile Bibliotecii Centrale Universitare Carol I", in ''Revista Bibliotecii Naționale a României'', Nr. 2/2006, pp. 46, 50&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, Zarifopol's professor, [[Alexandru Philippide]], took him on as an assistant and considered him for a likely successor; Zarifopol excused himself, and recommended the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]] intellectual [[Heimann Hariton Tiktin]] for that position. As he noted, Tiktin was more qualified, despite being targeted by a "rather violent antisemitic current".&lt;ref&gt;Lucian Nastasă, ''Antisemitismul universitar în România (1919-1939)'', pp. 47–48. Cluj-Napoca: Editura Institutului pentru Studierea Problemelor Minorităților Naționale, 2011, {{ISBN|978-6-06-927445-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Zarifopol left for [[German Empire|Germany]] to specialize in philology (under [[Hermann Suchier]]),&lt;ref name="ln(10)295"&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; and philosophy, as a student of [[Alois Riehl]]'s [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivist worldview]].&lt;ref&gt;Florian, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; He took a doctorate at the [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|University of Halle]] in 1904, with a dissertation on [[trouvère]] [[Richard de Fournival]].&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;

===Caragiale companion===
On April 25, 1903,&lt;ref name="evmicle"/&gt; at Berlin, Zarifopol married Ștefania (Fany) Dobrogeanu-Gherea, the daughter of [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]]. Zarifopol was an atheist;&lt;ref name="esstein"&gt;[[Eugen Simion]], "Nicolae Steinhardt", in ''Caiete Critice'', Nr. 1–2/2007, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Fany was Jewish, and, like Zarifopol, a religious nonconformist. The couple turned up at the marriage registrar in street clothes and neither held a church wedding nor baptized their children; all this outraged his mother, a strict [[Romanian Orthodox]].&lt;ref name="s407"&gt;Săndulescu, p. 407&lt;/ref&gt; Dobrogeanu-Gherea, a literary critic, and his son [[Alexandru Dobrogeanu-Gherea|Alexandru]] were also [[Marxism|Marxist]] doctrinaires; Alexandru's daughter, also called Fany, was married to [[Ion Luca Caragiale]]'s son [[Luca Caragiale|Luca (Luki)]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 710, 1017&lt;/ref&gt; While visiting his in-laws, Zarifopol met various figures of international socialism, including revolutionist [[Karl Radek]].&lt;ref name="vtstilist"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Vladimir Tismăneanu]], [http://www.lapunkt.ro/2014/07/21/un-stilist-al-ideilor-paul-zarifopol-si-snobismul-mesianic/ "Un stilist al ideilor: Paul Zarifopol și snobismul mesianic"], in ''LaPunkt'', July 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zarifopols had two children: daughter Sonia (born 1904), and son Paul (born 1905).&lt;ref name="s407"/&gt; Selling their Cârligi home in 1906,&lt;ref name="evststam"/&gt; the new family settled in [[Leipzig]], where Paul developed a friendship with Caragiale the elder, who frequently visited from Berlin; with [[Dimitrie Gusti]] and [[Panait Cerna]], he is described by Caragiale biographers as the comedic writer's closest Romanian friends in old age,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 495; Iosifescu, p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; or even, with an affinity in "sneering spirits", as his one true friend.&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship proved decisive in Zarifopol's evolution as a critic, but also left a trace on Caragiale's style: Zarifopol introduced him to the work of [[Anatole France]].&lt;ref&gt;Iosifescu, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; Until Caragiale's death in 1912, he and Zarifopol pursued a steady correspondence. Sometimes involving [[kitsch]] postcards they each collected for their involuntary humor,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ștefan Cazimir]], ''Caragiale față cu kitschul''. Bucharest: [[Cartea Românească]], 1988, p. 103.  {{OCLC|21523836}}&lt;/ref&gt; such exchanges were noted for witticisms and ridicule of traditional writers. They also shed light on Caragiale's intellectual, psychological, and artistic evolution, making Zarifopol a prime reference in that field.&lt;ref&gt;Iosifescu, pp. 322, 326, 327–329, 339, 344, 345, 351, 352, 355, 358&lt;/ref&gt;

Fany and Sonia Zarifopol are kneeling to Zarifopol's left; Paul the younger is front row, held in her arms by pianist [[Maria Cernovodeanu]]]]
From 1908 to 1911, Zarifopol contributed to the [[Munich]]-based ''[[Süddeutsche Monatshefte]]''.&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; Also a correspondent for the Romanian literary press, his writing broke with the older canons of Romanian literary criticism and brought him to the attention of Dobrogeanu-Gherea disciple [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]].&lt;ref name="ln(10)295"/&gt; Co-opted by the latter to write for ''[[Viața Românească]]'', Zarifopol made himself known for sarcastic comments about [[modernist literature]], describing [[Marcel Proust|Proust]], [[André Gide|Gide]], and [[Jean Cocteau|Cocteau]] as difficult "boys and children".&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he persuaded Ibrăileanu to publish there a novel written in collaborations by two of his brothers-in-law, Luki and [[Ionel Gherea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ioana Pârvulescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/n_numele_fiului "În numele fiului"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 10/2001&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the latter, he also supervised the debut of a female novelist, [[Lucia Demetrius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Lucia Demetrius]], [http://www.romlit.ro/memorii "Memorii"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 4/2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, Zarifopol and his family returned to Romania.&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; By then, World War I had broken out, with Romania settled in uneasy neutrality [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|until 1916]]. For much of that interval, Zarifopol was a literary contributor for [[Tudor Arghezi]]'s ''Cronica'', but did not necessarily share the magazine's radical stances, nor its anti-war "[[Germanophilia]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucian Boia]], ''"Germanofilii". Elita intelectuală românească în anii Primului Război Mondial'', p. 103. Bucharest: [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], 2010.  {{ISBN|978-973-50-2635-6}}; Iorga, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Romania in World War I|campaigns of 1916–1917]], Zarifopol and his family remained in Iași; all of southern Romania fell to the Germans. For a while, accepting Ibrăileanu's offer, he returned to his alma mater as a substitute professor, replacing C. Fedeleș (presumed missing in action). Upon Fedeleș's unexpected return, Zarifopol was sacked.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 295–296&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1916, the family took refuge in [[Russian Empire|Russia]], settling for a while in Moscow, but were driven out by the [[October Revolution]].&lt;ref name="evmicle"/&gt;

===Interwar losses and recovery===
Described by historian Lucian Nastasă as a withdrawn, "[[Neurasthenia|neurasthenic]]" and "very impractical" person,&lt;ref name="ln(10)296"&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; Zarifopol was financially ruined in the monetary devaluation that took place after the war.&lt;ref name="evmicle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; He supported himself by turning to regular journalism, but still had trouble making ends meet (though he did not admit to it), and made efforts to keep away from the centers of culture, living mostly in provincial [[Sinaia]].&lt;ref name="ln(10)296"/&gt;

Zarifopol, sometimes using the pen names ''PZ'' and ''Anton Gherman'',&lt;ref&gt;Mihail Straje, ''Dicționar de pseudonime, anonime, anagrame, astronime, criptonime ale scriitorilor și publiciștilor români'', p. 805. Bucharest: [[Editura Minerva]], 1973.  {{OCLC|8994172}}&lt;/ref&gt; returned as one of the main columnists at ''Viața Românească'' and its satellite, ''[[Adevărul Literar și Artistic]]''. Despite his material difficulties, Zarifopol categorically refused Ibrăileanu and [[Petre Andrei]]'s offers to take a professorate at Iași. In early 1920, he complained that the "endless infirmities of my children, my wife, and myself" prevented him from publishing his cultural journalism as an academic volume, which would have qualified him for the office.&lt;ref name="ln(10)296"/&gt; In 1924, Zarifopol informed his protectors that he now had "a holy terror of officialdom", and that he resented Iași for its support for the [[National-Christian Defense League]], a form of "nationalist imbecility and charlatanry". As he noted: "all things considered, I can make a living from journalism alone."&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 375&lt;/ref&gt;

A guest writer at [[Camil Petrescu]]'s ''Săptămâna Intelectuală și Artistică'' in 1924,&lt;ref&gt;Sdrobiș, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1925, at ''[[Cuvântul Liber (1924)|Cuvântul Liber]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu (1926), p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; Zarifopol became more deeply involved in the cultural debates of [[Greater Romania]]. This was the time of his explicit emancipation from Dobrogeanu-Gherea's left-wing [[didacticism]] and from Ibrăileanu's [[Poporanism]]. Didactic and social art, Zarifopol contended, had no real artistic value, and politics were irrelevant in assessing the quality of artistic endeavor. Revising some of his earlier pronouncements on modernism, he now believed in [[art for art's sake]], illustrated by such qualities as "pleasure", "amusement", "life", "drama", "color", "strange sensibilities", or "childish delirium".&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu (1926), pp. 273–276&lt;/ref&gt; His refusal of didactic art aimed higher, showing up in his celebrated essay on [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]]'s ''[[The Kreutzer Sonata|Kreutzer Sonata]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dima, pp. 170–171, 176&lt;/ref&gt; Working from Sinaia, Zarifopol translated and prefaced an anthology of fantasy short stories, published in 1924 as ''Vedenii'' ("Visions"). Part of his essays were published as ''Din registrul ideilor gingașe'' ("A Register of Tender Ideas", 1926), ''Despre stil'' ("On Style", 1928), ''Artiști și idei literare române'' ("Artists and Ideas in Romanian Literature", 1930), and ''Încercări de precizie literară'' ("Essays in Literary Precision", 1931).&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 1025; Grinea Mironescu, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Zarifopol's dissidence was admonished by other ''Viața Românească'' veterans Ibrăileanu and [[Mihai Ralea]]. Ibrăileanu took in some of Zarifopol's criticism, but argued that some of Poporanism's theories were rehabilitated in [[psychologism]] or [[social determinism]], without which "an artwork can never hope to be fully understood".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 141–142&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine's literary columnists even accused Zarifopol of committing a "crime" against taste at ''Adevărul Literar și Artistic'', where Zarifopol was introducing [[Aestheticism|aestheticist]] guidelines, albeit with contributions that remained "interesting and profound".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Zarifopol's derision of traditionalism and [[mysticism]] showed lasting similarities with Ralea's philosophical stances. In 1928, Ralea, Zarifopol, [[D. I. Suchianu]], [[Felix Aderca]] and other literati were lumped together as the "irresponsible malcontents", in a neotraditionalist pamphlet put out by [[Petre Pandrea]] and ''[[Gândirea]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

In his replies, Zarifopol noted that he did not reject mysticism as a cultural phenomenon, only objecting to the "career mysticism" of traditionalist ideologues.&lt;ref&gt;[[Z. Ornea]], ''Anii treizeci. Extrema dreaptă românească'', p. 77. Bucharest: [[Editura Fundației Culturale Române]], 1995.  {{ISBN|973-9155-43-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contested by young and old critics alike, Zarifopol found himself a follower with [[Mihail Sebastian]], who honored him as "a lucid man in a time of visionaries", "a sober teetotaler during a raging drinking bout".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Diana Pîrvan-Jenaru, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Mihail-Sebastian-si-arta-de-a-polemiza*articleID_18475-articles_details.html "Mihail Sebastian și arta de a polemiza"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 393, October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Zarifopol's cultural role, Sebastian wrote, was that of a "policeman", a "reactionary", who would curb the excesses of mysticism, ''[[Trăirism]]'', and nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ioan Stanomir]], [http://www.revista22.ro/bucurestiul-cultural-nr-12008-4231.html "Semne pe un dulap cu cărți"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 931, January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final creative period and death===
Zarifopol eventually moved to [[Bucharest]] in 1928,&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; taking up residence on Strada Spătarului, [[Moșilor]].&lt;ref&gt;Lazu, pp. 82, 328&lt;/ref&gt; Slowly discarding social and literary criticism in favor of philology,&lt;ref name="pcon264"&gt;Constantinescu, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; he worked on a critical edition of Caragiale's works; he put out the first three volumes (1930, 1931, 1932), winning a prize from the [[Romanian Writers' Society]].&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; In March 1929, together with [[Gala Galaction]], [[Nicolae L. Lupu]] and others, he put out the monthly magazine ''Hanul Samariteanului'', which only published a single issue.&lt;ref&gt;Desa ''et al.'', p. 491&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he became a writer for [[Isac Ludo]]'s mainly Jewish review, ''Adam'',&lt;ref&gt;Camelia Crăciun, "Presa culturală evreiască din România în timpul Holocaustului: cazul revistei ''Adam''", in Anca Ciuciu, Camelia Crăciun (eds.), ''Istorie și memorie evreiască. Volum omagial dedicat doamnei Dr. Lya Benjamin'', p. 140. Bucharest: [[Editura Hasefer]], 2011.  {{ISBN|978-973-630-228-2}}. See also Crohmălniceanu, p. 345; Desa ''et al.'', p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; and, in ''Viața Românească'', published his review of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[aesthetics]] (''Kant și estetica'').&lt;ref&gt;Dima, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; His other contributions appeared in various new magazines and newspapers, including ''[[Adevărul]]'' (which in 1927 hosted his humorous memoir of a meeting with Radek),&lt;ref name="vtstilist"/&gt; ''[[Dreptatea]]'', ''[[Kalende]]'', ''[[Lamura (magazine)|Lamura]]'', ''Gazeta Fălticenilor'', and ''Ancheta''.&lt;ref&gt;Desa ''et al.'', pp. 38–39, 330, 433, 557, 571&lt;/ref&gt;

He carried on with his lampoons of traditionalism, publishing, in 1932, an especially mordant portrait of historian [[Vasile Pârvan]], ''Plicticoase fantome'' ("Tedious Apparitions").&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Alexandru George]], [http://www.revistaluceafarul.ro/index.html?id=1228&amp;editie=59 "Cu cât pierdem un mit..."], in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 18/2009&lt;/ref&gt; He was also involved with ''[[Criterion (literary society)|Criterion]]'', a debate club for political and cultural factions, one of the "old men" who were called upon as both arbiters and active participants. He and Ralea were thus present when the debates about Gide, [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Charlie Chaplin]] either degenerated into squabbles or were broken up by the far-right Defense League.&lt;ref name="imcrit"&gt;{{ro icon}} Irina Manea, [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/criterion-o-istorie "Criterion – o istorie"], in ''Historia'', May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Zarifopol was named editor-in-chief of ''[[Revista Fundațiilor Regale]]'',&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="agm8"&gt;Grinea Mironescu, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; the official literary magazine, which was largely conceived by him.&lt;ref name="ovsc171"&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1934, he was involved with ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' in round-table talks that were supposed to revive ''Criterion''.&lt;ref name="imcrit"/&gt; These projects ended abruptly when Zarifopol died of a heart attack on May 1, at 12 AM,&lt;ref name="gc909"&gt;Călinescu, p. 909&lt;/ref&gt; allegedly while visiting his mistress, musicologist Lisette Georgescu.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mihail Sebastian]], ''Journal, 1935-1944''. London: [[Random House]], 2003, p. 59.  {{ISBN|0-7126-8388-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was [[Cremation in Romania|cremated]] on May 3,&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 475&lt;/ref&gt; with Camil Petrescu succeeding him at ''Revista Fundațiilor Regale''.&lt;ref name="ovsc171"/&gt;

His most important work as a literary critic appeared posthumously in 1934; called ''Pentru arta literară'' ("For Literary Art"), it was praised by Sebastian as "a model of precise understanding of values and of their order".&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; In 1935, [[Șerban Cioculescu]] put out a critical edition of the Caragiale–Zarifopol correspondence, while editing new volumes from the Caragiale corpus, which Zarifopol had begun publishing.&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, pp. 239, 269–270, 277. See also Călinescu, p. 1001; Iosifescu, p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
===Generic traits===
Once settled in his role as [[art for art's sake]] advocate, Zarifopol created himself a confrontational niche, earning both respect and bewilderment from his readers. A traditionalist adversary, [[Nicolae Iorga]], recognized Zarifopol as a "refined and daring thinker",&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; while his ''Viața Românească'' partner Ralea called him "charming and irritating".&lt;ref&gt;Ralea, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea identified in him "a freethinker" with "the courage of looking truth in the face", but essentially a "freezing intelligence" of "destructive anarchism", a man "alone within his sarcasm".&lt;ref&gt;Ralea, pp. 162–164&lt;/ref&gt; A more virulent review came from classicist [[George Călinescu]], who proposed that Zarifopol's one original note was "continuous and systematic persiflage, to the point of annoyance". He attributed such traits to Zarifopol's familiarity with "two sophistic races", Greeks and Jews,&lt;ref name="gc909"/&gt; his claim in turn criticized by Ralea&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucian Boia]], ''Capcanele istoriei. Elita intelectuală românească între 1930 și 1950''. Bucharest: [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], 2012, p. 243.  {{ISBN|978-973-50-3533-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and philosopher [[Mircea Florian]]&lt;ref&gt;Florian, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; for its racialist undertones. Florian also discussed the constructive side of Zarifopol's work, arguing that accusations of "bourgeois anarchism" and "iconoclasm" were prejudiced.&lt;ref&gt;Florian, pp. 169, 170&lt;/ref&gt; Another sympathetic reviewer, Andreea Grinea Mironescu, sees Călinescu's pronouncements as "minimizing and petty."&lt;ref name="agm8"/&gt;

[[Eugen Lovinescu]], the modernist literary theorist, shared Zarifopol's overall aesthetic goals, but not his methods: Zarifopol, he writes, was an unlikely follower of [[Titu Maiorescu]]'s non-didactic school of "aesthetic autonomy" and authenticity, which had emerged at ''[[Junimea]]'' in the 1860s, and had also influenced Caragiale.&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu (1943), pp. 289, 291&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, [[Nicolae Bagdasar]] identified in Zarifopol "a vastly cultured critic, of a rare subtlety and fine irony", lamenting that his work "remains scattered in so many magazines".&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolae Bagdasar]], "Estetica", in Nicolae Bagdasar, [[Traian Herseni]], S. S. Bârsănescu (eds.), ''Istoria filosofiei moderne, V. Filosofia românească dela origini până astăzi'', p. 253. Bucharest: Romanian Philosophical Society, 1941&lt;/ref&gt; However, as argued by colleague [[Pompiliu Constantinescu]], this improvidence was a fundamental trait and shortcoming of Zarifopol's literary contribution: his was a "newspaperman's critique" of "spontaneous impression, quick analysis, and incomplete assessment, meaning that he could never embrace a creator in all their complexity."&lt;ref name="pcon264"/&gt; The same was noted by Călinescu, who argues that Zarifopol's "journalistic method" relied on explicit [[Argumentum ad populum|appeals to popularity]] and [[False precision|spurious accuracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 910–911&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovinescu assessed that Zarifopol's criticism "lingers in the paradox", always placing itself "at the antipodes of common sense": denying merit to prestigious figures such as [[Ernest Renan|Renan]] or [[Guy de Maupassant|Maupassant]], but praising [[Ion Minulescu]] as an outstanding novelist. His "practical" verdicts, Lovinescu notes, remain "disoriented", "regrettable".&lt;ref name="el(26)272–3"&gt;Lovinescu (1926), pp. 272–273&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledges Zarifopol's "stylistic rigor", but concludes that his is "an equation in which the unknown is better left unknown",&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu (1926), pp. 276–277&lt;/ref&gt; something "virtually alien to the rhythms of our literary movement."&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu (1943), p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; The same was argued decades later by Lovinescu disciple [[Nicolae Manolescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Grinea Mironescu, pp. 8, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ralea, Zarifopol should be read as a Romanian counterpart of anti-populist "lone travelers", from [[Jules Amédée Barbey d'Aurevilly|Barbey d'Aurevilly]] and [[Edgar Allan Poe]] to [[Hanns Heinz Ewers]], often applauding causes that were "at odds with the establishment".&lt;ref&gt;Ralea, pp. 159–161&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, responding to the established literary canons, Zarifopol fashioned himself an alternative one, comprising Caragiale, Minulescu, Proust and Cocteau, but also [[Joseph Delteil]], [[Henri de Régnier]], [[Adrian Maniu]], [[Păstorel Teodoreanu]],&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu (1926), pp. 275–276. See also Balotă, p. 215; Grinea Mironescu, p. 9; Zalis, pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dragoș Protopopescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 376&lt;/ref&gt; Călinescu believes that Zarifopol was most "intelligent" in his essays on Proust and [[Gustave Flaubert]], where he overcame his usual "journalistic banality".&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 911&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetic ideals===
Zarifopol's rejection of [[neoclassicism]], from [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] to [[Dimitrie Bolintineanu]], but also his friend [[Panait Cerna]], had to do with both its "mechanic" use of poetic imagery and its communication of "bland truths".&lt;ref&gt;Balotă, pp. 215–218, 222–223&lt;/ref&gt; He preferred archaic Moldavian forms, that he found resonating in the poetry of [[Dosoftei]] and [[Vasile Alecsandri]].&lt;ref&gt;Zalis, pp. 7, 8&lt;/ref&gt; Călinescu was especially critical of Zarifopol literal and "negativist" reading of [[Alexandru Vlahuță]]'s ''Din prag'', which ridiculed the poet's presentment of death eternal.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 909–910&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a sustained attack, equated by comparatist [[Nicolae Balotă]] with "a holocaust of poetry",&lt;ref&gt;Balotă, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless impressed Lovinescu. The latter declared himself in agreement with the thesis that ancient models were perishable, and that traditionalist art was implicitly false.&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu (1926), p. 273; (1943), pp. 290–291&lt;/ref&gt; Seen by [[Alexandru Paleologu]] as a more radical anti-classicist than Zarifopol ever was,&lt;ref&gt;Grinea Mironescu, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Lovinescu noted in 1943: "as modernism or synchronism, I have been supporting those same ideas these past twenty years."&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu (1943), p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; Zarifopol's revolt was more contextual, and bound by his own debt to the classics: Ralea sees him as a classical [[Rationalism|rationalist]] in the manner of [[Voltaire]], [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve|Sainte-Beuve]], and [[Anatole France]],&lt;ref&gt;Ralea, pp. 162, 168, 170&lt;/ref&gt; and Călinescu as a "cultured academic, for all his freethinking airs", copying his style from Caragiale and [[Tudor Arghezi]], without "a sense of the sublime".&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 909, 910&lt;/ref&gt; Balotă also finds Zarifopol a "suppressed scholar", "in denial of his formative background".&lt;ref&gt;Balotă, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

Călinescu sees Zarifopol a man of little classical culture, his "obviously German method" being more akin to the [[sociology of literature]].&lt;ref name="gc909"/&gt; Such verdicts were nuanced by another literary historian, [[Alexandru Dima]], who suggests that Zarifopol did have contribution to the scholarly study of [[aesthetics]], one which "imposes itself even against his own wish."&lt;ref&gt;Dima, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Zarifopol's rejection of [[scientism]] and [[historicism]] had deep roots in ''Junimism'' and [[Neo-Kantianism]], but Zarifopol also criticized Kantian [[Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime|assumptions about the sublime]], finding them too indebted to ethical imperatives.&lt;ref&gt;Dima, pp. 171–175; Lovinescu (1943), p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Dima, his attachment to [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] was "at the very least formal".&lt;ref&gt;Dima, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; According to Balotă, his applications of the art for art's sake principle show that, despite his own claims to the contrary, Zarifopol borrowed his [[poetics]] from [[Henri Brémond]], [[Paul Valéry]], and [[Stéphane Mallarmé]].&lt;ref&gt;Balotă, pp. 218–221&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social critic===
Revisiting Zarifopol's moralizing essays in 2007, critic [[Henri Zalis]] found him to be "chaste and meticulous, and in this unmatched."&lt;ref&gt;Zalis, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; ''Din registrul ideilor gingașe'', is, according to Lovinescu, an "interesting intellectual spectacle of deliberate originality".&lt;ref name="el(26)272–3"/&gt; This is one of several essays containing Zarifopol's ''Junimea''-like satire of inauthentic ''mofturi'' ("trifles" or "coquetries", a term echoing Caragiale), including wholesale borrowings of foreign customs that respond to bourgeois tastes.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 909; Lovinescu (1943), pp. 290–292; Ralea, pp. 160–161, 167–171&lt;/ref&gt; The eponymous "tender ideas" were defined by Zarifopol as "those which should be familiar to any man wishing to pass for cultured, and also those that said man must be careful to speak about just so, lest he insult the views of society"; the book was addressed to those skeptics who, rejecting cultural crazes, "still value consistency".&lt;ref name="cmsging"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Cassian Maria Spiridon]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/TATAmar13.htm "Ideile gingașe și actualitatea lor contondentă"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; As Ralea notes, Zarifopol's anti-ideological critique, continuing the work of Caragiale, was specifically deriding philosophers and philosophies that were the height of fashion: mystical, [[Henri Bergson|Bergsonian]], [[Japonism|Japonist]];&lt;ref&gt;Ralea, pp. 161, 167–168, 170–171&lt;/ref&gt; other such hobbyhorses were [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzscheism]]&lt;ref name="cmsging"/&gt; and [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref name="gc909"/&gt;

Călinescu was unimpressed by Zarifopol's "rather belated" satire of bourgeois mores, since "the bourgeois is no longer that ridiculous conservative figure".&lt;ref name="gc909"/&gt; Yet, Zarifopol was not entirely anti-middle class: he believed his type of "cold lucidity" was primarily an in-built antidote to the decay of the "colossal civilization" that was liberal society.&lt;ref&gt;Florian, pp. 170–171; Ralea, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; He issued what Florian calls a "passionate call to order of the bourgeoisie, [which is] still a bearer of cultural values."&lt;ref&gt;Florian, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Himself a conservative, Zarifopol expressed his nostalgia for old-regime [[Differentiation (sociology)|social differentiation]] and [[division of labor]], against "the political type", and for the [[nuclear family]] of [[patriarchy]], against the "neutralization" of fathers in modern society. He criticizes both [[Francophilia]] and [[Germanophilia]], noting that, although competing, they each supported [[deindividuation]]: the former, through [[corporatism]]; the latter, through [[militarism]].&lt;ref name="cmsging"/&gt; While targeting [[philistinism]], ''Din registrul...'' is itself an [[Anti-intellectualism|antiintellectualist]] manifesto. Zarifopol contended that intellectuals were an illusory social class (no economic interest bound together "a lawyer with a novelist"), but still collectively responsible for the failures of a society such as Romania's.&lt;ref&gt;Sdrobiș, pp. 312–313&lt;/ref&gt;

Zarifopol took distance from more radical antiintelectualist stances, communist as well as Christian; but also noted that natural disunity between intellectuals meant that [[communist terrorism]] was itself an intellectuals' affair.&lt;ref name="cmsging"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sdrobiș, pp. 313–314&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''Din registrul...'' an other writings show him as an [[anti-Soviet]] in line with [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], and believed that [[Leninism]] was a somewhat worrisome, but generally puerile, non-philosophy.&lt;ref name="vtstilist"/&gt; Like [[fascism]] and, historically, [[Bonapartism]], it stood for a "simplistic autocratic drive" and "stupefied blindness". Moreover, Zarifopol rejected [[Marxist literary criticism]], with its discourse of [[base and superstructure]], seeing it as the source of modernist kitsch.&lt;ref name="cmsging"/&gt;

In 2014, posthumously reviewing Zarifiopol's anticommunist notes, scholar [[Vladimir Tismăneanu]] described him as a diagnostician of "totalitarian reflexes", displaying "urbanity, civility, moderation and firmness".&lt;ref name="vtstilist"/&gt; Evidence also exists that, beyond this public persona, Zarifopol was more illiberal. Prolonging his [[Antihumanism|antihumanist]] tendencies,&lt;ref&gt;Ralea, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; he expressed in private his reserves for the "deplorable" literature of "the oppressed", including Jews, social climbers, and especially women; according to Nastasă, he was an [[Antifeminism|antifeminist]], and perhaps also a misogynist.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, writer [[Barbu Brezianu]] suggested that Zarifopol was on the "far-right" of Romanian literature, in the "grand conservative party" of [[D. Nanu]], [[Cincinat Pavelescu]], [[Mihail Sadoveanu]], and [[Al. T. Stamatiad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Barbu Brezianu]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/BREZIANUfeb8.html "Curs de literatură politică"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Fany Zarifopol, born in 1876, lived until 1945. Paul Jr spent seventeen years as a political prisoner under the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]],&lt;ref name="s407"/&gt; being released with a general amnesty in 1964.&lt;ref name="vtstilist"/&gt; Officially designating him a "bourgeois idealist",&lt;ref&gt;S. Mureșeanu, "Recenzii. ''Istoria gîndirii sociale și filozofice în România''", in ''Studii. Revistă de Istorie'', Nr. 1/1965, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censorship]] prevented Zarifopol's essays from being either reprinted or quoted before the mid 1960s liberalization. When they were finally returned to circulation, large parts of his work were still being bracketed out.&lt;ref&gt;[[Monica Lovinescu]], ''Unde scurte'', p. 146.

Sonia Zarifopol, who never married,&lt;ref name="s407"/&gt; was a lover of literature and, in the 1930s, a discreet presence at Lovinescu's ''[[Sburătorul]]'' society.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Bianca Burța-Cernat, [http://www.revistaluceafarul.ro/index.html?id=2963&amp;editie=127 "''Sburătorul'': fotografie de grup cu scriitoare uitate"], in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 3/2011&lt;/ref&gt; She kept her father's entire collection of manuscripts and documents, now housed at the [[Museum of Romanian Literature]]. She died in 1981, and her brother three years later; neither had children of their own.&lt;ref name="s407"/&gt; George Zarifopol's son,&lt;ref name="evmicle"/&gt; Constantin Radu "Dinu", was a published novelist.&lt;ref name="raczibloo"&gt;{{ro icon}} Raluca Alexandrescu, Christina Zarifopol-Illias, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Bloomington-Indiana-o-activa-ambasada-romaneasca.-Interviu-cu-Christina-ZARIFOPOL-ILLIAS*articleID_5855-articles_details.html "Bloomington, Indiana: o activă ambasadă românească"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 19, July 2000&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter Ilinca, marginalized at home for her aristocratic descent, emigrated to the United States in 1977. A linguist and comparatist, she taught at [[Indiana University Bloomington]], marrying Anglicist Kenneth R. Johnston.&lt;ref name="izjnote"/&gt; She was joined there by her sister Christina Zarifopol-Illias, who organized the Bloomington Romanian Studies Program.&lt;ref name="raczibloo"/&gt;

The critical reappraisal of Zarifopol, begun by [[Eugen Simion]] in 1956, was taken up in the 1980s by Paleologu and [[Marin Mincu]].&lt;ref&gt;Grinea Mironescu, pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; In underground culture, his memory was cultivated by the essayist [[Nicolae Steinhardt]]. Although a fervent Orthodox, he viewed the non-believers Zarifopol and Ralea as intellectual standards, praising their "quick wit".&lt;ref name="esstein"/&gt; From 1971, [[Al. Săndulescu]] was allowed to publish selections of Zarifopol's literary prose,&lt;ref name="agm8"/&gt; and, in 1987, Zarifopol's correspondence (at [[Editura Minerva]], with samples in ''[[Manuscriptum]]'' magazine).&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 50, 206, 247, 296, 359, 369, 427&lt;/ref&gt; A more thorough recovery came after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], when more complete anthologies first emerged, and Zarifopol monographs were published by [[Alex. Cistelecan]].&lt;ref name="agm8"/&gt; In 1992, his formerly censored critique of socialism was issued by [[Editura Albatros]] as a standalone book, ''Marxism amuzant'' ("Amusing Marxism").&lt;ref name="vtstilist"/&gt; His Bucharest home was not fitted with a memorial plaque—the new owners having reportedly refused to allow it.&lt;ref&gt;Lazu, pp. 163, 237, 328&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Penrith Hoard''' is a dispersed [[hoard]] of 10th century silver [[penannular brooch]]es found at Flusco Pike, Newbiggin Moor, Near [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] in [[Cumbria]], and now in the [[British Museum]] in London. The largest "thistle brooch" was discovered in 1785 and another in 1830, with the bulk of items being recovered in two groups close to each other by archaeologists in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Silver 'thistle' brooch | publisher=[[British Museum]] | url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/s/silver_thistle_brooch.aspx | accessdate=2010-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether all the finds made close to each other were originally deposited at the same time remains uncertain, but it is thought likely that at least the brooches were.  The brooches are thought to have been deposited in about 930.

==Discoveries==
[[File:Brit Mus 17sept 014-crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The "brambled" terminal of the largest brooch in the main picture.]]  
The earliest surviving finds were discovered in what was already called the "Silver Field" on Newbiggin Moor by a small boy in 1785, the name suggesting that earlier finds, now lost, had been made. In 1830 another smaller thistle brooch was found. Although the exact find spot is not known, this brooch is strongly suspected to have also come from the "Silver Field".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lancs.ac.uk/depts/cnwrs/papers%20on%20the%20web/arch%20conf%20synopses%201999.rtf Synopses of papers given at the 26th Annual Archaeology Conference, 6 March 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605231456/http://www.lancs.ac.uk/depts/cnwrs/papers%20on%20the%20web/arch%20conf%20synopses%201999.rtf |date=5 June 2011 }}, University of Lancaster Centre for North-West Regional Studies. Retrieved 6 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The usual reason for a hoard being "disbursed" is that routine farming operations like ploughing can move some items of a single hoard before they are discovered.

Later archaeological investigations in 1989 at the same spot revealed other silver items that confirmed that this was a dispersed hoard and not a solitary loss of one brooch. Two groups of items were found in nearby fields: one consisted of five Viking brooches, with fragments of two more, and the other of more than fifty items comprising coins, [[ingot]]s, jewellery and [[hacksilver]] (jewellery and other silver pieces chopped up) of a very similar date.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=3242725&amp;partid=1&amp;output=Places%2f!!%2fOR%2f!!%2f30930%2f!%2f30930-3-1%2f!%2fExcavated%2fFindspot+Penrith%2f!%2f%2f!!%2f%2f!!!%2f&amp;orig=%2fresearch%2fsearch_the_collection_database%2fadvanced_search.aspx&amp;currentPage=2&amp;numpages=10 British Museum collection database] "ingot/hacksilver", item from the second hoard.&lt;/ref&gt;  The brooches were declared to be "[[treasure trove]]" at an inquest held in Penrith on 23 July 1990, and entered the British Museum in 1991, joined by the other hoard in 2009.

==Context==
The penannular brooch, originally a common utilitarian clothes fastening, normally of [[base metal]], in [[Roman Britain]] developed in the post-Roman period into highly elaborate and decorative marks of status in Ireland and Scotland, made in precious metals and often decorated with gems, and worn by men and women.  When the Vikings began to raid and settle the British Isles, they took to wearing these brooches, but now in plain silver.  The thistle and bossed types represented in the hoard were the most popular styles, both developing out of earlier Celtic styles.

It has been speculated that the hoard, with items strongly suggesting an Irish connection, is connected with the events of 927, a date which matches the style of the finds.  In that year "the kings of Strathclyde and Scotland came south to Penrith to pay homage to [[Athelstan of England|Athelstan]]".  Also in the area with his army was the troublesome [[Norse-Gael]] [[king of Dublin]], [[Gofraid ua Ímair]], or Gothfrith.  Athelstan made the kings, who had apparently been associating with pagan Vikings like Gothrith, renounce idolatry, but "Gothfrith and company had slipped away in order to attack [[Viking York|York]]".&lt;ref&gt;Graham-Campbell, 224&lt;/ref&gt;  After briefly making himself [[king of Northumbria]] there, he was chased out and replaced by Athelstan later in the year, and went back to Ireland.  At some point during these manoevres the hoards may have been deposited.

==Items discovered==
[[File:Brit Mus 13sept10 brooches etc 040.jpg|thumb|left|Penannular brooch with "gripping beasts" connecting the ring to the terminals, and a [[rune|runic]] [[futhark]] scratched on the reverse of the hoop.]]

The large thistle brooch soon passed to the [[Leverian Museum]], a private museum in [[Leicester Square]] in London. In 1787 a print of it was published, claiming that it was the insignia of the [[Knights Templar]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/britain/enlightenment_archaeology/silver_thistle_brooch.aspx British Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213230940/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/britain/enlightenment_archaeology/silver_thistle_brooch.aspx |date=2011-02-13 }} ''Enlightenment: The Birth of Archaeology, Silver 'thistle' brooch''&lt;/ref&gt;  It was bought by the British Museum in 1909 (M&amp;ME 1909,6-24,2).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=65058&amp;partid=1&amp;searchText=Penrith+Hoard&amp;numpages=10&amp;orig=%2fresearch%2fsearch_the_collection_database.aspx&amp;currentPage=6 British Museum collection database] Large silver brooch (M&amp;ME 1909,6-24,2).&lt;/ref&gt;

The brooch discovered in 1830, the largest in the group illustrated, entered the museum in 1904 (M&amp;ME 1904,1102.3). One terminal is missing, and the pin is 52&amp;nbsp;cm long. In 1989 two further incomplete thistle brooches and pieces from three bossed-type brooches were found, which are seen with the 1830 brooch in the group illustration above.  The most complete of the 1989 group (illustrated left) has a [[rune|runic]] [[futhark]] scratched on the reverse of the hoop.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=1615235&amp;partid=1&amp;searchText=Penannular+Penrith&amp;numpages=10&amp;orig=%2fresearch%2fsearch_the_collection_database.aspx&amp;currentPage=1 British Museum collection database] brooch (M&amp;ME 1991,0109.2).&lt;/ref&gt;  The other two have [[interlace (art)|interlace]] around the bosses on the terminals.

It is thought likely that all these brooches were originally deposited together and have been dispersed and damaged by ploughing.

The '''Pink Decade in Malayalam Poetry''' is the term used by some literary critics to describe the period in [[Malayalam literature]] (roughly the late 1940s and early 1950s)  in which a brigade of young  poets inspired by the ideals of [[scientific socialism]] and [[Marxist]] world view were active in  creating ‘[[revolutionary]]’ poetry.

The term Pink Decade is to be taken as a figurative epithet rather than in its literal sense because these poets or their works cannot be confined within the span of a single decade.

Some poets belonging to this period are [[P. Bhaskaran]], [[Vayalar Ramavarma]]. [[Thirunalloor Karunakaran]], [[O N V Kurup]], [[Punaloor Balan]] and [[Puthussery Ramachandran]].

Though these writers initially shared some characteristics in common like a romantic vision of a [[classless society]], a simple style directly addressing the masses and themes picked from the daily life of the common man, they later developed distinct poetic identities of their own.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13021">'''Random International''' is a London-based art collective and collaborative studio, founded in 2005. The group shot to prominence with its interactive ''[[Rain Room]]'' art installation. Random International creates art installations that investigate notions of human consciousness, perception and instinct. Its work, which includes sculpture, performance and large-scale architectural installations, reflects the relationship between man and machine and centres on audience interaction.&lt;ref name="Barbican"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.barbican.org.uk/rain-room-random-international|title=Rain Room, Random International|website=www.barbican.org.uk|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of its exhibition pieces have now become permanent installations, the first of which was the critically acclaimed and popular ''Rain Room'', now permanently housed in [[Sharjah]], [[United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates (UAE)]].

The group was founded in 2005 by German artists Hannes Koch and Florian Ortkrass. Ortkrass graduated from the [[Royal College of Art]] in London in 2005, while Koch graduated in 2004. Its relentless experimentation with digital technologies and reflections of the human form has led it to collaborate with [[Harvard University|Harvard]] roboticists on creating 'point studies' that reduce representation of the human form in motion into 15 light points,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artslant.com/ew/articles/show/43500-random-international-art-technologys-magical-realists|title=Random International: Art &amp; Technology's Magical Realists {{!}} ArtSlant|website=ArtSlant|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as with architects to create large scale public displays that include covering a German train station with LED lights.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Rain Room ==
''Rain Room'', now installed in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, was the first installation of a Random International project in a purpose-built, permanent structure. The work was previously shown at the [[Barbican Centre|Barbican]], London (2012);&lt;ref name="Barbican2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.barbican.org.uk/rain-room-random-international|title=Rain Room, Random International|website=www.barbican.org.uk|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]], New York (2013); Yuz Museum, Shanghai (2015) and [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art|LACMA]], Los Angeles (2015–2017). ''Rain Room'' allows visitors to the installation to walk through a downpour without getting wet.&lt;ref name="Barbican3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.barbican.org.uk/rain-room-random-international|title=Rain Room, Random International|website=www.barbican.org.uk|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/news/uae/leisure/rain-room-brings-fun-intrigue-to-sharjah-1.2215470|title=Rain Room brings fun, intrigue to Sharjah|last=Reporter|first=Faisal Masudi, Staff|date=2018-05-02|work=GulfNews|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motion sensors detect visitors' movements as they navigate through the darkened space, becoming "performers in this intersection of art, technology and nature".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sharjahart.org/sharjah-art-foundation/projects/rain-room|title=projects - Sharjah Art Foundation|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sharjahart.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work has been a celebrated [[Instagram]] theme:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.peninsula.com/en/shanghai/our-city/pencities/content-calendar/everything-or-nothing|title=Everything or Nothing {{!}} The Peninsula Shanghai|website=www.peninsula.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the photo and video sharing platform has been cited as a major source of Random International's popular recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/random-international-public-art|title=Random International Is Creating Viral Public Art for the Instagram Age {{!}} Architectural Digest|work=Architectural Digest|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, billionaire [[Budi Tek]], Yuz Museum's founder,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2018/03/28/lacma-yuz-museum-will-partner-exhibitions-programming/|title=In Historic U.S.-China Partnership, Budi Tek’s Shanghai-Based Yuz Museum Will Partner With LACMA|last=Binlot|first=Ann|date=2018-03-28|website=ARTnews|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; announced he would build a 150 square metre ''Rain Room'' in [[Bali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xy4gjj/rain-room-in-the-rain-forest-billionaire-plans-bali-art-theme-park|title=Rain Room in the Rain Forest: Billionaire Plans Bali Art Theme Park|date=2015-03-13|work=Vice|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was shelved due to Tek's ill-health.

A number of Chinese companies have copied the ''Rain Room'' concept and, in 2016, the Chinese Jiajiale Dream Park opened its $15 million ''Rain Room'' clone called the ''Magic Rain Zone''. One company offers as many as 12 clones of the installation. Koch estimated that as many as 8-10 companies had produced ''Rain Room'' clones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vv5xyb/rent-your-own-rain-rooms-become-big-business-in-china|title=Rent-Your-Own Rain Rooms Become Big Business in China|date=2017-05-16|work=Vice|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Instant Structure for Schacht XII ==
The group's first outdoor installation was ''Tower: Instant Structure for Schacht XII,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.designboom.com/art/random-international-build-towering-shower-at-ruhrtriennale/|title=random international builds towering shower at ruhrtriennale|date=2013-09-03|work=designboom {{!}} architecture &amp; design magazine|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; created  for [[Urbane Künste Ruhr]] for the [[Ruhrtriennale]] 2013. The work cycled 30,000 litres of water per minute from the former coal mines of [[Zollverein Coal Mine Industrial Complex|Zollverin]], a World Heritage site, to create an instantaneous towering structure of water. The mines pump millions of water out each year to maintain the surrounding area's structural integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mgpqpn/random-international-tower-instant-structure-for-schacht-XII|title=Random International Turn 30,000 Liters Of Water Into A Monumental Tower|date=2013-09-05|work=Vice|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self &amp; Other ==
The first permanent installation in the UK for Random International, ''Self &amp; Other,'' is located on the [[South Bank]] arts and cultural area of the [[Albert Embankment]]. It was launched in July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.itsnicethat.com/news/random-international-sculpture-art-270618|title=Random International is unveiling their first UK permanent kinetic sculpture|date=2018-06-27|work=It&amp;#8217;s Nice That|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Swarm Studies ==
A series of works based on LED walls that mimic the flocking behavior of birds, fish, and insects,  Random International's ''Swarm Studies'' have been created ranging from a small version, ''Swarm Study / XI,'' at the Park Hyatt New York’s restaurant Bevy, to the huge ''Swarm Study / IX'', which spans the entire façade of the train station in [[Chemnitz]], Germany—the group's largest installation at the time.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/random-international-public-art|title=Random International Is Creating Viral Public Art for the Instagram Age {{!}} Architectural Digest|work=Architectural Digest|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these studies, 2010's ''Swarm Light'' is in the collection of the Maxine &amp; Stuart Frankel Foundation For Art in Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archello.com/project/swarm-light|title=SWARM LIGHT {{!}} Random International {{!}} Archello|website=Archello|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commissioned by London's [[Victoria and Albert Museum|V&amp;A]], ''Swarm Study / III''  consists of four cubic forms suspended from the ceiling, each made of a grid of illuminated brass rods.

== Everything &amp; Nothing ==
The group's first [[solo exhibition]] in Asia, ''Everything &amp; Nothing'', was on display at Shanghai's Yuz Museum from 20 April – 2 September 2018. The exhibition takes its title from the video installation, ''Everything &amp; Nothing'' (2016), which attempts to question humankind’s place in a technological dynamic by showing a steamroller crushing everything in its path.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/rain-room-sharjah-uae-1275371|title=Random International’s Rain Room Gets Its First Permanent Home—in the Desert {{!}} artnet News|date=2018-04-30|work=artnet News|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Everything &amp; Nothing'' is the collective's first work to be created from video alone, a loop of over 6 hours. The piece was originally commissioned for the ''Wonder Materials'' exhibition at the [[Science and Industry Museum|Manchester Museum of Science and Industry]], where it was displayed in 2016.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.random-international.com/everything-and-nothing-2016/|title=RANDOM INTERNATIONAL|website=RANDOM INTERNATIONAL|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Everything &amp; Nothing'' "documents the simultaneous decay and progress of the industrialised world in an age of relentless transformation." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yuzmshanghai.org/random-international-everything-nothing/|title=Random International: Everything &amp; Nothing - Yuz Museum Shanghai|work=Yuz Museum Shanghai|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collective's newest work at the time of the exhibition was also displayed, ''Turnstiles'' (2018), an analogue piece which consists of a maze of barriers. ''Self &amp; Other'', another exhibit, consists of a reflective wall of mirrors, light and glass which reflect the visitor taking a selfie.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeoutshanghai.com/event/Art-Art_Exhibitions/53866/Everything--Nothing.html|title=Everything &amp; Nothing|last=|first=|date=24 November 2018|website=Time Out Shanghai|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition also saw ''Rain Room'' return to the museum in a revised and larger format, 1,600 square feet (larger, in fact, than the Sharjah installation).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' Shanghai reviewed the exhibition saying, "''Everything &amp; Nothing'' is a meditative video installation about how fucked we are in this age of un-tempered technological advancement. 'Turnstiles' tracks the same story, but instead with a matrix of spinny turnstiles that you can navigate while doing your best to avoid serious injury to the groin area."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The '''Registration Acts'''—the '''Mutant Registration Act''' ('''MRA'''), the '''Keene Act''', the '''Superhuman Registration Act''' ('''SRA''', or '''SHRA'''), the '''Sokovia Accords''' and the '''Vigilante Registration Act''' ('''VRA''')—are fictional [[legislation|legislative bills]] that have been plot points used in various [[comic books]] and [[superhero film]]s which, when passed into law, enforce the [[regulation]] of vigilante vs. criminal activity or the mandatory [[Licensure|registration]] of [[Superhuman|superpowered]] individuals with the [[government]]. The issue that the government might seek to regulate the activities and [[civil rights]] of [[super-heroes|superheroes]], or view them as valuable [[national security]] resource subject to [[conscription]] without notice in times of crisis, has also been explored in other comics, such as those featuring [[DC Comics|DC's]] [[Justice Society of America]] team, series like ''[[Watchmen]]'', ''[[Astro City]],'' and ''[[Powers (comics)|Powers]];'' the films ''[[The Return of Captain Invincible]]'' (1983) and ''[[The Incredibles]]'' (2004); and in [[role-playing games]] ''[[Brave New World (role playing game)|Brave New World]]'' (1999), and ''Dawn of Legends'' for ''[[Savage Worlds]]''.

This plot point is especially rich and extensively explored in the fictional universes of various comic book stories published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The first mention of the broad concept was in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #141 (January 1981). The term "Registration Act" was first used in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #181 (May 1984). As their names suggest, ''Mutant Registration Act'' and ''Superhuman Registration Act'' deal with the registration of mutants and superhumans respectively. The Mutant Registration Act has also been featured in both the original [[X-Men (animated series)|''X-Men'' animated series]] and the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' films]]. Numerous versions of each bill have been proposed at different times and in different jurisdictions in the Marvel Universe. The ''Superhuman Registration Act'' is a major [[plot point]] in Marvel's 2006 [[fictional crossover|crossover]] [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'', which was loosely adapted in the 2016 film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Peter|title=MARVEL ANNOUNCES 'AVENGERS: INFINITY WARS,' 'CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR,' 'BLACK PANTHER' AND SO MUCH MORE|url=http://www.fandango.com/movie-news/marvel-announces-avengers-infinity-wars-captain-america-civil-war-black-panther-and-so-much-more-748527?wssaffid=11841&amp;wssac=123|website=Fandango|publisher=Fandango|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Registration Acts as a concept==

===Publication history===
The idea that super-powered individuals might need to be "registered" by the government was first raised in specific relation to Marvel Comics' [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]]. In ''Uncanny X-Men'' #141, (written by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]) the concept is briefly suggested. In that issue the term "Registration Act" is not used, but one character ([[Moira MacTaggert]]) brings up the notion of "registration". In reference to a politician whom she suspects of [[Anthropocentrism#In fiction|anti]]-mutant [[bigotry]] she says:

:''"Registration today, gas chambers tomorrow"''.

The same issue features mention of the "Mutant Control Act", however it is left unclear exactly what that legislation involves and whether some form of registration is a part of it. However, in ''[[New Mutants]]'' #1, it was implied that involved the operation of [[concentration camp]]s.

The term "Mutant Registration Act" was first fully used in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #181, by writer Chris Claremont. As the MRA (as it became known) was passed into law in the Marvel Universe it became widely used as a [[subplot]], [[plot device]] or background element across Marvel's entire line of titles, especially those featuring mutants (such as ''Uncanny X-Men'', ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' and ''[[New Mutants]]'') during the late 1980s.

In the early 1990s Chris Claremont left the X-titles and the topic of the MRA began to appear much more rarely in stories. It was still occasionally mentioned, though usually in the past tense, suggesting that it was repealed at some point (though this was never clearly shown) or that it simply ceased to be actively enforced.

However, in an interview regarding the ''[[Civil War: X-Men]]'' limited series its writer [[David Hine]] suggested that it is still law in the Marvel Universe, stating that in the series the idea of bringing  "the Mutant Registration Act in line with the SRA" will be discussed.&lt;ref name="discussed."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=6922 |title=&gt; News |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date= |accessdate=2015-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617210327/http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=6922 |archivedate=June 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of an equivalent piece of legislation for non-mutant super-powered individuals—a Superhuman Registration Act—was first raised in comics that were published during the "[[Acts of Vengeance]]" crossover in 1989-1990. The issue was most fully explored in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #335-336 by writer [[Walter Simonson]]. In the course of the story, the issue was apparently resolved with the proposed Act being shelved.

The concept was then revived in 1993 in ''[[Alpha Flight]]'' (vol. 1) #120 (May 1993) by writer [[Simon Furman]]. In that issue a "Superpowers Registration Act" becomes law in Canada and went on to be a major plot point in the remainder of the series. However, later ''Alpha Flight'' series did not make use of the concept.

In 2006 the concept was again revived by writer [[Mark Millar]] as the main plot point in Marvel's 2006 ''Civil War'' crossover. In preparation for that storyline a new version of  the Superhuman Registration Act has been widely mentioned across various Marvel titles, with the issue being most widely discussed and explored in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #529 - 531 (April - June 2006) by writer [[J. Michael Straczynski]].

===Issues, allegories and metaphors===
When the topic of the original Superhuman Registration Act is debated in ''Fantastic Four'' #335-336 the issue is explored in a [[national security]] context, with the utility of such a law being challenged. In the comics the Fantastic Four argue that super-heroes are already a hugely benevolent force for society and such an act would be unnecessary and possibly counter-productive.

When the issue of an SRA was raised again in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #529 - 531 the prospect of a new SRA is explored once more from a security perspective, with reference being made to the fact that super-powered individuals often wield abilities which have massively destructive potential for use, making some mechanism to regulate their activities necessary.

The writer of ''Civil War'', Mark Millar, has stated that that storyline explores the civil rights implications of the SHR as previous stories have done, but also explores the other side of the argument in more depth, in particular how Marvel super-heroes are, absent an SRA, illegal [[vigilante]]s, lacking proper legal authority or oversight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsarama.com/marvelnew/millar/millar_2.html |publisher=Newsarama |title=CIVIL WAR &amp; PEACE OF MIND with MARK MILLAR (Part 2) |date=April 11, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525011227/http://www.newsarama.com/marvelnew/millar/millar_2.html |archivedate=May 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terms of the registration acts===
In a June 2006 interview ''Civil War'' editor [[Tom Brevoort]]  confirmed that registrants to the act were required to reveal their identities to the government (but not the public) and they have to undergo some basic testing or training and satisfy certain (as yet unspecified) standards before they gain legal authorization to continue to use their abilities to fight crime. Government employment is not mandatory, though it is available to those who wish to take it. This has not remained consistent, though, and characters have made reference to all superpowered individuals being forced to register and enlist in [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsarama.com/marvelnew/CivilWar/WarRoom/02/CivilWarRoom2.html |publisher=Newsarama |title=CIVIL WAR ROOM #2 |date=June 15, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060702020756/http://www.newsarama.com/marvelnew/CivilWar/WarRoom/02/CivilWarRoom2.html |archivedate=July 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was revealed in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #535 that unregistered individuals are sent to a prison in the otherdimensional [[Negative Zone]] indefinitely until they agree to register. [[Iron Man]] claims that as this is off [[United States of America|United States]] soil, they have almost no civil rights unless the [[United States Supreme Court]] explicitly rules otherwise—and he knows they won't. This leads [[Spider-Man]] to re-evaluate his support of the act. After the major conflict of ''Civil War'' ends, all the superhero inmates are transferred to real prisons in the state while the facility is transformed into a Maximum Security Prison for high-threat-level villains such as the [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] and [[Lady Deathstrike]].

==Fictional history of the Registration Acts==

===Mutant Control Act===
The first direct mention of a piece of legislation specifically aimed at super-humans in the Marvel Universe comes in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #141 (January 1981) in which the "Mutant Control Act", a law from the future, is mentioned. In the course of the story, the first part of the two-part "[[Days of Future Past]]" storyline, Kate Pryde travels back in time from a dystopian future to the present and possesses the body of her younger self, X-Men member [[Kitty Pryde]]. On revealing herself to Kitty's teammates she recounts to them the series of events which led to her dark future, in the hopes that the X-Men might be able to prevent those events from coming to pass. One of those pivotal events was the passing of a "Mutant Control Act" by the [[Federal government of the United States|government of the United States]]. When the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] found the law unconstitutional the government responded by reactivating their robot [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] program so that they might police the mutant race. The Sentinels interpreted their mandate in such a way that they decided to forcibly take over the government of the country and instituted a harsh regime where mutants were severely persecuted. The reference to the Mutant Control Act is brief, and it is unclear exactly what its provisions would entail, though it would appear that registration forms at least one part of it. In the course of the story the X-Men are successful in preventing one of the pivotal events which Pryde had described to them (the assassination of [[U.S. Senator|Senator]] [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Robert Kelly]]) from occurring, though the story's end is intentionally ambiguous as to whether Pryde's dystopian future was fully avoided. Although no Mutant Control Act has been introduced in the comics, the Mutant Registration Act may be its equivalent and the events of "Days of Future Past" continue to be alluded to in X-Men comics as a possible future.

===1982 British Super Hero Legislation===
During the events of the ''[[Jaspers' Warp]]'' [[story arc]], an insane reality warper, [[Mad Jim Jaspers|Jim Jaspers]], became the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and turned the [[United Kingdom|UK]] into a fascist state. As PM, he enforced "Super Hero Legislation"; using [[Superhuman Restraint Unit|armored agents]] of [[S.T.R.I.K.E.]], the UK division of S.H.I.E.L.D., to hunt down and detain superhumans within the UK. However, the legislation is abandoned after [[Captain Britain]] defeated Jaspers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Alan Moore]] | Penciller = [[Alan Davis]] | Inker = [[Alan Davis]] | Story = The Twisted World (Reprise) | Title = [[The Mighty World Of Marvel]] | Issue = 8 | date=  January 1984 | Publisher = [[Marvel UK]] | }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mutant Control Act===
Registration as a concept is first mentioned in ''Uncanny X-Men #141'' in which Moira MacTaggert suggests that Robert Kelly deems the registration of mutants by the government as necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Uncanny X-Men #141: 21 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

Her suggestion eventually turns out to be accurate, and in the ''Uncanny X-Men #181'' (May 1984) the first mention of a Mutant Control Act is made when Kelly is seen discussing his introduction of the Mutant Affairs Control Act&lt;ref&gt;Uncanny X-Men #181: 21 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; with a senatorial colleague. It is then mentioned in #183 (1984) to have "stirred up the hornets' nest" (12) by Valerie Cooper. By #184 (July 1984) the Act is mentioned as introduced in Congress by Senator Kelly,&lt;ref&gt;Uncanny X-Men #184: 7 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; and in #188 [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] remarks the chance of it to become accepted as law is as high as never before,&lt;ref&gt;Uncanny X-Men #188: 16 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that, unlike the Mutant Control Act in the "Days of Future Past" timeline, it would not be struck down by the Supreme Court.

The passage of the MRA did not have an immediate impact on the plots of any Marvel series, but the legislation continued to be referenced intermittently in various titles. In at least one instance (''X-Factor'' #1; February 1986), the Act is referred to as a "possible new law". In that story, the prospect of the MRA is one of the things which motivate [[Jean Grey]] and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] to form X-Factor.

The legislation becomes a plot point later when government agent [[Val Cooper]] and the mutant terrorist [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] form [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]], a government-sanctioned superhero team (mostly comprising former members of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]) in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #199 (November 1985). Freedom Force went on to make many appearances where they sought to enforce the MRA by arresting unregistered mutants such as members of the X-Men (e.g. ''Uncanny X-Men'' #206, June 1986), X-Factor (e.g. ''X-Factor'' #30; July 1988) and the New Mutants (e.g. ''New Mutants'' #86, February 1990). They also appeared enforcing the MRA in non-X-Men-related titles such as ''Daredevil'' #269 (August 1989).

[[Captain America]] (who at this point is John Walker, the character who would later be known as [[U.S. Agent (comics)|U.S. Agent]]) and [[Battle Star (comics)|Battlestar]] – two other officially sanctioned super-heroes – also briefly enforce the Act by capturing the unregistered mutant [[Lifter (comics)|Meteorite]] for the government in ''Captain America'' (vol. 2) #343 (July 1988).

During this period of active enforcement of the MRA, the only mutants who are shown publicly protesting the Act were those who were not aligned with the X-Men or its affiliated teams. For example, in ''X-Factor'' #33 the [[Alliance of Evil]] demonstrates against the MRA in Manhattan and after fighting X-Factor are arrested by Freedom Force and in ''Captain America'' #368 (March 1990) a mutant group called the [[Resistants]] are shown protesting the Act in Washington D.C. Indeed, far from publicly agitating against the act, one X-team (X-Factor, in its original form) actually pretend in public to be supporters of the MRA who are actively enforcing it, though in actuality they act to subvert it.

With Freedom Force (the characters most involved in the enforcement of the Act) no longer existing (they disband following a disastrous mission in [[Iraq]] in ''X-Factor Annual'' #6, 1991) and Chris Claremont (the writer who developed the MRA as a sub-plot) no longer writing ''X-Men'' stories after 1992, the Mutant Registration Act stopped appearing prominently in Marvel Universe stories.

====Proposition X====
In an attempt to further subjugate the remaining mutant population, [[Simon Trask]] leads the Humanity Now! coalition in support of federal legislation called Proposition X. Proposition X if passed would have force mandatory chemical birth control on all mutants. While marching to San Francisco's city hall in support of Proposition X, Simon Trask and his followers met opposition by [[Hank McCoy]], young mutants and mutant right activist. Hank McCoy's peaceful resistance against Proposition X eventually led to a fight between the opposing sides. In response [[Norman Osborn]] will declare martial law in San Francisco, which causes the riot that will plague the city the next few nights. These events will lead to Cyclops creating a new mutant sanctuary called [[X-Men#Fictional places|Utopia]], where mutants can be free from bigoted legislation.

===1990 Metahuman Registration Act===
A variation on the concept of the Mutant Registration Act the Superhuman Registration Act concept is originally proposed in [[comic books]] published circa the "Acts of Vengeance" storyline, such as ''[[Punisher]]'' (vol. 2) #29 and ''Avengers'' (vol. 1) #313 (both January 1990).

During that period, in ''Fantastic Four'' #335 and 336 (December 1989, January 1990) the Fantastic Four go to [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] where a committee is investigating whether an SRA, similar in its provisions to the already in effect Mutant Registration Act, is required for Superheroes (the MRA only covers individuals who have their powers inherently at birth, not those who acquire their abilities artificially in later life). In his testimony and in evidence he presents to Congress, [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] argues that a Super-human registration Act is unnecessary as Super-humans have been largely effective and trustworthy in their actions and government regulation would only stifle their ability to protect the world. He argues that those individuals who were likely to act irresponsibly with their powers are also likely to be supervillains and thus would not be candidates for registration anyway.

As the topic is debated, he and his teammates are continually attacked by random [[supervillain]]s whom they easily subdue, though it is unclear if this helps or hinders his arguments. In his final point concerning the lack of any workable definition of superhuman Richards demonstrates a device that scans a human for physical and mental capabilities and compares those to the national average, marking 'significant outliers' as "superhuman". The device identifies several regular humans, including some committee members, as "superhuman" according to those criteria. The proposed legislation is abandoned and registration of superhumans in the United States is not recommended by the committee.

===1993 Canadian Super-powers Registration Act===
A similarly titled "Super-powers Registration Act" is passed by the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Canadian government|government]] in ''[[Alpha Flight]]'' #120 (May 1993). Introduced by a minister of the Canadian government named Robert Hagon, the Super-powers Registration Act is part of a complex plot engineered by the [[Master (comics)|Master]], who is using the alias "Joshua Lord".

The terms of the act entail the government employment of all super-powered individuals, including mutants, who are then enlisted in one of the government [[Department H]] "Flight" programs such as "Alpha Flight" and "[[Gamma Flight]]".

Although the Act was shown to be controversial and the first series ended with the disbandment of the Canadian government's superteams (the various "Flights") in ''Alpha Flight'' (vol. 1) #130 (March 1994), the Canadian SRA is never explicitly repealed or overturned within the comics.

Later ''Alpha Flight'' series did not acknowledge the law. As of 2006, rumors began to circulate (encouraged by some Marvel creators such as Mark Millar) that a new ''Alpha Flight'' series of some form is in the planning stages.&lt;ref name="stages."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/index.cgi?column=litg&amp;article=2418 |title=Lying In The Gutters: 1144047600 |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date= |accessdate=2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rumors suggest that the premise of this series would involve American superheroes fleeing the United States to Canada to escape a newly enacted U.S. Superhuman Registration Act. This suggests that registration is no longer mandatory in the Marvel Universe version of Canada. In July 2006 ''Civil War'' editor Tom Brevoort concurred with this sentiment saying "we've seen no evidence of it in ten-plus years of Canadian appearances. So if such legislation did exist, it was evidently repealed at some point."&lt;ref name="point."&gt;{{cite news|url=http://forums.comicbookresources.com/showpost.php?p=2935920&amp;postcount=246|publisher=Comic Book Resources|title=Ask Marvel's Tom Brevoort Questions Here!

Other sources, however, such as [[Michael Avon Oeming]]'s post-''Civil War'' title ''[[Omega Flight]]'', contradict this statement, which several characters mentioning having a Registration Act for years, without the negative effects of the American Superhuman Registration act.&lt;ref name="omegaflight2"&gt;Talisman: We've had a Registration Act here for years...and we've never turned it against ourselves -- against our heroes! {{Comic book reference | writer=[[Michael Avon Oeming]] | artist=Scott Kolins | colorist=Brian Reber | story=The Fantastic Four! | title=[[Omega Flight]] | volume=1 | issue=2 | date=May 2007 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] | page=23 | panel=1-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006 Superhuman Registration Act===
[[File:Superhuman ID card.png|[[Ms. Marvel]]'s SHR card.|right|thumb]]
{{See also|Civil War (comics)}}
Interest in the concept of the act was revived in various Marvel comic books in 2006. In ''New [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] Special: the [[Illuminati (Marvel Comics)|Illuminati]]'' (May 2006), following the events of "[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]" and the sudden dramatic fall in the Mutant population, the U.S. government again considers a Superhuman Registration Act and Iron Man attempts to persuade his Illuminati colleagues to support the SRA, in order to diffuse it. Iron Man predicts that some superhuman or group of superhumans will eventually make a mistake that will cost hundreds of lives (he specifically mentions the [[Young Avengers]] and the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]] as candidates for causing such a catastrophe). After such an event, he went on to predict, the government would inevitably rush to make an example of someone, or everyone, in the superhuman community by passing legislation that would be even more restrictive or persecutory towards them than the proposed SRA. By supporting the Act before it is passed, he suggests, he and his fellow Illuminati might be able to help avert such possible future tragedies and also, by becoming a part of the process, help moderate the legislation so that it would have the minimum possible negative effect on the superhuman community. However, most of the Illuminati members (except for Reed Richards, who had spoken against the similar proposition made 16 years before ''[[#1990 Super-human Registration Act|(see above)]]'') flatly reject Stark's proposal, leading to the disbandment of the group.

In ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #529-531 (April–June 2006), [[Spider-Man]] and Iron Man travel to Washington D.C. to discuss the issue. In those issues Iron Man is shown to be initially opposed to the idea, while Spider-Man is unsure of his opinion. In #531, the first part of Iron Man's prediction are shown to be accurate when a conflict between the [[New Warriors]] and a group of supervillains ends with a massive explosion which kills hundreds of people, including children attending a nearby school. As depicted in the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' crossover and series, the public outcry that follows this event leads the government (with the support of Iron Man and fellow Illuminati member [[Reed Richards]]) to quickly enact the '''Superhuman Registration Act''' (SHRA), 6 U.S.C. S. 558, which required those with naturally occurring superhuman abilities, super abilities acquired through science or magic (including [[extraterrestrials]] and gods), and even non-super powered humans using exotic technology, such as [[Iron Man]], to register as "living weapons of mass destruction." Enactment of the law on the federal level led to various revisions to state criminal codes (such as Chapter 40, Article 120, Section 120 of the New York Penal Code and Section 245(d) of the California Penal Code) in order to allow state and federal coordination in enforcing the law.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Flamini|Flamini, Anthony]] &amp; Byrd, Ronald; ''Civil War Battle Damage Report''; March 2007; Page 1&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a major schism and conflict among the superheroes, with the anti-SHRA side- regarding the Act as a violation of civil liberties- led by Captain America and the pro-SHRA side- seeing the Act as a natural evolution of the superhuman's role in the modern world to regain public trust- led by Iron Man. Eventually, Iron Man's side wins the conflict and the "[[Fifty State Initiative]]" is established.

Other countries followed America's lead and introduced their own Superhuman Registration laws.{{issue|date=May 2013}}

Following the [[Skrull]] [[Secret Invasion|invasion]] and the subsequent fall from grace of Iron Man, [[Norman Osborn]] seizes control of the Initiative and SHIELD, but is prevented from getting his hand on the register (and thus the identities of most of the superhuman community) by Tony Stark when he infects the US government database with a computer virus. There is only one copy of the SHRA database, in Stark's brain, where he deleted it, piece by piece, before Osborn could get his hands on it, destroying the very information that was the focus of "Civil War" in the first place.

At the conclusion of ''Siege'', [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] is named the new head of security of the United States and as a condition of joining, he convinces the government to repeal the Act, allowing superheroes to return to their prior activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Bendis, Brian Michael]]|penciller=[[Coipel, Olivier]]|inker=Morales, Mark|story=The Siege of Asgard - The Fallen|title=[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]|issue=4|date=June 2010|publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MI-13 Registration Act===
First raised in #1 and further detailed in #5 of ''Captain Britain and MI-13'' (2008), the British version of registration was started during the [[Skrull]] [[Secret Invasion|invasion]]: all superheroes in the UK were drafted with immediate effect into [[MI-13 (comics)|the intelligence agency MI-13]]. After the invasion, the terms were stated that MI-13 would monitor and support superheroes and call on them for reasons of national defence, but would allow them semi-autonomy so they would not feel morally compromised.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain Britain and MI-13'' #5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternate universe Registration Acts==

{{See also|Civil War (comics)#Other versions}}

===Ultimate Universe===
Although no Registration Act exists in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] Universe, there are several laws in place that prohibit superhuman activity. Genetic modification of a human being is illegal, and the Superhuman Test Ban Treaty makes it illegal for nations to employ superhumans. This makes the Test Ban Treaty the polar opposite of the SHRA. In ''Ultimate Six'' #1, it was stated that the law on deliberately created superhumans is still unclear, allowing [[Nick Fury]] to hold supervillains indefinitely without any trial and in hidden locations (#5 showed that the [[President of the United States]] was unaware of this, and was furious when he learned of it).

===Exiles #12===
In ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' #12 a parallel world is shown, similar to the "Days of Future Past" timeline, in which the passing of a Mutant Registration Act led to the Sentinels taking over the world and herding mutants, superhumans and eventually even humans into [[concentration camp]]s.

The "[[Age of Apocalypse]]" version of [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], who at that point was a member of the Exiles, stays on this planet in order to raise the infant David Richards (the son of the [[Rachel Summers]] and [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]] of that reality).

===Marvel Knights: 2099===
In an alternate world (Earth-2992) shown in the ''[[Marvel 2099|Marvel Knights: 2099]]'' series of one-shots published in November 2004, a Mutant Registration Act is in effect which mandates that mutants undergo a process which robs them of their abilities.

The ''Marvel Knights: [[Mutant 2099]]'' one-shot explained that after the passage of this act the Avengers, X-Men and Fantastic Four opposed the government's enforcement of it and were eventually defeated in a major battle that was fought in front of the [[Baxter Building]]. This led all the remaining superheroes to go underground.

===The 1992 X-Men animated series===
The first episode of the 1992 ''[[X-Men (animated series)|X-Men]]'' Animated Series (''[[Night of the Sentinels|Night of the Sentinels (part 1)]]''; original airdate: 31 October 1992) mentions that some form of registration is in effect already. In the episode, [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]]'s foster parents worry that they may have to "register her with the Mutant Control Agency" after she manifests her powers for the first time.

But following the attack on Jubilee at a mall, it was revealed that the hidden agenda of [[Henry Peter Gyrich]], the founder of the agency is to deceive the mutants into revealing their identities so the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] could track down and eliminate them due to Gyrich's beliefs that mutants pose a threat to society. After the destruction of their files, following the X-Men's raid on the agency, the President decides to cancel the registration act. The government's persecution of mutants is a consistent theme throughout the fifth season of the series.

===The ''X-Men'' movies===
The events of the first ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' film are precipitated when Senator Robert Kelly introduces a Mutant Registration Act to the Senate. This motivates [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], who sees such legislation as persecutory towards mutants, to kidnap Kelly and replace him with Mystique, who while impersonating Kelly, withdraws his advocacy for the Act.

In the sequel, ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', the Mutant Registration Act is briefly mentioned when [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] speculates that Nightcrawler's attack on the [[White House]] might lead the government to reintroduce the legislation.

===Marvel Cinematic Universe===
In ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', which is loosely based on the "Civil War" comics, the public opinion of the Avengers and all superpowered beings worsens following the climactic battles of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|Marvel's The Avengers]]'', ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' and ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', causing great destruction and casualties to New York, Washington D.C., and Sokovia. The Inhuman Outbreak in ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' makes the bigotry worse. After a catastrophe in [[Lagos State|Lagos]], involving [[Scarlet Witch]] using her powers to divert an explosion from [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]], destroying a building and killing several [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] workers (including some [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakandan]] workers), the United Nations are trying to pass a set of internationally ratified legal documents that provide regulation and frame-working for the military/law enforcement deployment of enhanced individuals, particularly the Avengers, called the '''Sokovia Accords'''. The Accords divide the Avengers, leading [[Captain America]] to come into conflict with [[Iron Man]], who believes that the Avengers need to be held responsible for their actions, especially after he created [[Ultron]] and was responsible for the destruction in Sokovia, while Captain America believes that the Accords will restrict the Avengers' freedom. This leads to them each forming their own sides as they battle over the Accords, as well as [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]] being framed for the bombing at the UN by Colonel [[Helmut Zemo]]. This eventually results in both sides of the conflict fighting at the Leipzig/Halle Airport, with Iron Man, [[War Machine]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] and [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], against Captain America, Winter Soldier, [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], [[Scarlet Witch]], and [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]], with Iron Man and Secretary of State [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus Ross]] locking up Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye, and Ant-Man in the Raft for opposing the Accords while Black Widow goes into exile after she helps Captain America and the Winter Soldier escape. Little did they, Ross, and the United Nations realize that the Accords have been tampered with by Helmut Zemo as part of his own vendetta against the Avengers. At the end of the film, Captain America breaks them all out of the Raft, with Iron Man - who was appalled at how his former comrades were being treated when he assumed the Raft would only be used for actual criminals, not vigilantes - willingly letting the breakout occur without interference from his side while ignoring a call from Ross to help stop the breakout, Black Panther providing the anti-registration heroes (who are now wanted fugitives) with sanctuary in Wakanda after learning that the Accords were manipulated by Helmut Zemo. The Accords were mentioned in the ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' season three episode "[[Emancipation (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Emancipation]]" and have play through the show's fourth season. In ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', Ross still intends to prosecute Captain America and his team for violating the Accords despite being aware of Helmut Zemo's actions and the threat [[Thanos]] poses to Earth, which alienates War Machine, who hangs up on Ross instead of arresting the fugitives as ordered (which, in response, earns himself a court martial and Ross's anger). Ant-Man and Hawkeye avoid prosecution by agreeing to the government's terms and retiring. In ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'', Ant-Man is placed under house arrest as part of his plea deal while [[Hope van Dyne|Wasp]] and her father [[Hank Pym]] are forced into hiding due to their technology being involved in the conflict.

===Avengers Assemble===
In the third season of ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'' titled ''Ultron Revolution'', two registration acts are enacted in response to events in the season, "the New Powers Act" which puts all super powered beings under government jurisdiction and a variation of the Mutant Registration Act known as Inhumans Registration Act which puts all [[Inhumans]] under government control with Registration Disks on their necks. Both the "New Powers Act" and the Inhuman Registration Act, however, are revealed to be just a plot by [[Ultron]] (who was disguised as the Avengers' liaison to the government Truman Marsh) to accomplish his goals against both humans and Inhumans, also revealing that the Registration Disks are mind control devices.

==Non-Marvel equivalents==
In many other super-hero universes the government has intervened to regulate or control the activities of super-heroes. Some examples of this include:

===DC Universe===
In [[DC Comics]]' [[DC Universe]] the [[Justice Society of America]] chose to disband in 1951 rather than appear in front of the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], which demanded that they unmask themselves. This was first shown in a back-up story in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' (vol. 1) #466 ("The Defeat of the Justice Society!"; December 1979) by writer [[Paul Levitz]] and subsequently further explored in the ''[[America vs. The Justice Society]]'' 4 issue limited series (January–April 1985) by writers [[Roy Thomas|Roy]] and [[Dann Thomas]].

There is also a piece of legislation called the "Keene Act" (an apparent reference to ''Watchmen'', see below) in the DC Universe. First mentioned in ''[[Suicide Squad]]'' (vol. 1) #1 (May 1987) in a story written by [[John Ostrander]], the "Act" is referred to as a piece of legislation from 1961 which gives prisons greater leeway in imprisoning superhumans than ordinary prisoners.

It was more fully explored in ''[[Secret Origins]]'' (vol. 3) #14 (May 1987), again written by Ostrander, where it is revealed that the Act was passed in 1961 and it reaffirmed the right (that had been cast into doubt by HUAC in 1951) of superheroes to operate with [[secret identity|secret identities]]. That story also reveals that the later "Ingersoll Amendment" (a reference to lawyer and comics writer [[Bob Ingersoll]]) to the Keene Act, which delineates governmental authority over superhuman activity in times of crisis, was passed into law in 1972.

===''The Return of Captain Invincible''===
In the 1983 comedy film ''[[The Return of Captain Invincible]]'' starring [[Alan Arkin]] and [[Christopher Lee]], Captain Invincible (Arkin) is a super-hero who was forced into retirement in the 1950s following the government's persecution of him.

In a similar scenario as that faced by the Justice Society, Captain Invincible faced a [[McCarthyism|McCarthy-ish]] congressional investigation which accused him of being a [[communism|communist]] (because of his red cape) and charged him for violating U.S. airspace by flying without a proper license.

As the title suggests a crisis forces Captain Invincible out of retirement in the 1980s which leads to him redeeming his reputation.

===''Watchmen''===
In [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]]' 12 issue ''[[Watchmen]]'' series (September 1986 – October 1987), extensive reference is made to a law called the Keene Act.

The series reveals that the actions of superheroes or "costumed vigilantes" in the world of ''Watchmen'' caused a [[NYPD|New York City]] [[police strike]] in 1977, which led to [[riot]]ing (shown in ''Watchmen'' #2; October 1986) and the passing of the Keene Act which outlaws non-government affiliated acts of "costumed adventuring" (mentioned in ''Watchmen'' #4; December 1986).

The passing of the act led to the retirement of most of the US superheroes, the sole exceptions being government-sponsored heroes such as [[Comedian (comics)|The Comedian]] and [[Doctor Manhattan]] (who are used to fight wars, allowing the US to win the [[Vietnam War]]) and [[Rorschach (comics)|Rorschach]], who refuses to abide by the law. The series depicts them coming out of retirement when The Comedian is murdered at the beginning of the comic.

===''City of Heroes''===
Following World War II, in the [[City of Heroes]] universe, the United States intelligence community feared the Soviet bloc would gain an advantage in meta-human assets. To address this issue, the government passed the Might for Right Act. This law proclaimed any U.S. citizen with meta-human powers or paranormal abilities, super-powered individuals and vigilante heroes a valuable national resource subject to draft without notice into the service of the United States government.

The law was later struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court after numerous protests and complaints regarding the law's civil rights abuses.

Currently in effect in the setting is the Citizen Crime Fighting Act, which provides vigilantes who choose to register (whether technically superhuman or not) with police powers. Unlike the Might for Right act or the Marvel act the CCFA does not require heroes to work for the government, although through various "forms" in the game it is shown the government (or at least the one in Paragon City) keeps track of all heroes and any supergroups they may form.

Similar to Marvel's 2006 Act, in the alternate dimension Praetoria all superhumans are required to work under the "Powers Division" of the government.

===''Astro City''===
In writer [[Kurt Busiek]]'s ''[[Astro City]]'' Vol. 2 #6-9 (February - May 1996) the registration of super-humans is mandated by the city's Mayor Stevenson.&lt;ref name="Stevenson."&gt;[http://kbac.orcon.net.nz/astro2-3.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212182400/http://kbac.orcon.net.nz/astro2-3.html |date=February 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In those comic book issues, a super-human [[serial killer]] is thought to be active in the city and the Mayor proposes that registration will help apprehend the killer.

Stevenson brings in federal E.A.G.L.E. agents to enforce the new requirement, which is opposed by many active super-heroes. The prominent hero [[Winged Victory (comics)|Winged Victory]] makes outspoken statements opposing registration and several super-humans flout the law and illegally continue their activities without registration.

In ''Astro City'' #8 the Mayor is revealed as an [[Extraterrestrial life (popular culture)|alien]] infiltrator whose actions are part of a planned extraterrestrial invasion. The mayor's policy discredited,  Astro City's super-human population unite to defeat the invasion in ''Astro City'' #9.

Registration is abandoned at the storyline's conclusion and has not been mentioned again in the series. The issues involved were later collected in the [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] ''Astro City: Confession'' ({{ISBN|1-56389-550-1}}).

===''Brave New World''===
In the ''[[Brave New World (role playing game)|Brave New World]]'' superhero [[role-playing game]] originally released by [[Pinnacle Entertainment Group]] in 1999 the setting of a dystopian alternate timeline includes a [[fascist]] United States government which passed the "Delta Registration Act" after a group of supervillains attempted to assassinate President [[John F. Kennedy]] on November 22, 1963.

In the game the law requires that anybody with super-human abilities must register themselves to the United States Government. Its restrictive provisions include requirements that registrants surrender certain civil rights and notify the police of their whereabouts regularly. The law also mandates that super-powered individuals register within 7 days of first manifesting their abilities, with the penalty for failing to do so being an automatic sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The Act also legislates for the mandatory military [[conscription]] of individual super-powered individuals at any time should their abilities be judged necessary by the government. In the world of the game most other nations have similar laws, though they are far less draconian in their restrictions and enforcement.

===''Powers''===
In [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Michael Avon Oeming]]'s ''[[Powers (comics)|Powers]]'' series, superheroes had to register with the government in order to be able to operate. This was changed following the events of ''Powers'' (vol. 1) #30 (March 2003) in which Super Shock, the world's most trusted superhero, goes on a massive worldwide killing spree. At that point, the US government prohibited super-beings from using their powers and operating as superheroes.

This leads all the world's heroes to retire and attempt to live normal lives, though after ''Powers'' (vol. 2) #6 (November 2004) some begin to re-emerge.

===''The Incredibles''===
In the world depicted in the 2004 [[Pixar]] animated [[feature film]] ''[[The Incredibles]]'', superheroes (known as "supers") are shown in flashbacks as originally having been required to register with the [[National Supers Agency]] (or "NSA"; a joke reference to the real-life [[National Security Agency]]) in order to legally fight the crime that mostly (and at many times constantly) occurred in their home city of Municiberg.

However, following the ''Sansweet v. Incredible'' court case near the start of the movie, after which superheroes were found to be legally liable for the personal injury claims of people injured and the costs to infrastructure and property damaged, as a result of their activities despite the live-saving and law-assisting importance of them, all superheroes were forced into retirement due to the resulting potentially overwhelming legal liabilities they faced and public pressure of those that hated them for causing those injuries and damages. To assist the superheroes in their retirement, the United States government set up a "Superhero Relocation Program" (similar in many ways to the non-fictional [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|Witness Protection Program]]) which granted heroes amnesty from the legal claims provided they permanently retire from hero work and live anonymously.

By the end of the film, the main protagonists have returned to their roles as superheroes (among the very few left as the result of the villainous Syndrome's actions), indicating that the program itself has been nullified.

===''Absolution''===
In the world depicted in ''[[Absolution (comics)|Absolution]]'', Christopher Gage's creator-owned limited series by [[Avatar Press]], super heroes are part of the police force. While the government is aware of their real identities, superheroes are not obligated to reveal their identities to the public.

===''Smallville''===
In the television series ''[[Smallville]]'' The Vigilante Registrations Act (VRA) is proposed legislation that would require vigilantes to register themselves. Led by General [[Deathstroke|Slade Wilson]], the VRA forces registered heroes to unmask and officially work for the government or be branded as terrorists. Despite the efforts of [[Darkseid]] and his minions to encourage anti-hero propaganda, the actions of the [[Justice League (Smallville)|Justice League]], [[Oliver Queen (Smallville)|Oliver Queen]], and the pro-vigilante Senator [[Jonathan and Martha Kent#Television|Martha Kent]]&amp;nbsp;– ironically aided by an assassination attempt arranged against Martha by a clone of [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]], which was based around his personal grudges against her son rather than the VRA&amp;nbsp;– result in the Act being repealed and the heroes being permitted to return to their daily lives.

===''Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice''===
In the film ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'', the character of [[Superman]] becomes controversial due to the destruction he caused in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] during ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]''. The government subsequently decides to have a court hearing that will decide if Superman should be held accountable via a registration act. Superman tries to avoid it, and instead focus trying to locate [[Batman]], who agrees with the government and desires to obtain [[kryptonite]] to use on him if necessary. Superman ultimately attends the hearing, but before a resolution can be made, [[Lex Luthor]] bombs the court.

[[File:Rangoli.jpg|thumb|''[[Rangoli]]'', a popular form of [[Indian art|Indian Sand Paintings]], in [[Singapore]].]]
'''Sandpainting''' is the art of pouring coloured sands, and powdered pigments from minerals or crystals, or pigments from other natural or synthetic sources onto a surface to make a fixed, or unfixed sand painting. Unfixed sand paintings have a long established cultural history in numerous social groupings around the globe, and are often temporary, ritual paintings prepared for religious or healing ceremonies.  It is also referred to as drypainting.

Drypainting is practised by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in the Southwestern United States, by [[Tibet]]an and Buddhist monks, as well as [[Australian Aborigines]], and also by Latin Americans on certain Christian holy days.

==History==

=== Native American sandpainting ===
[[File:Navajo sandpainting.jpg|thumb|Navajo sandpainting, photogravure by [[Edward S. Curtis]], 1907, Library of Congress]]

In the sandpainting of southwestern Native Americans (the most famous of which are the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] (known as the Diné)), the [[Medicine Man]] (or ''Hatałii'') paints loosely upon the ground of a [[hogan]], where the ceremony takes place, or on a [[buckskin (leather)|buckskin]] or cloth tarpaulin, by letting the coloured [[sand]]s flow through his fingers with control and skill. There are 600 to 1,000 different traditional designs for sandpaintings known to the Navajo. They do not view the paintings as static objects, but as spiritual, living beings to be treated with great respect. More than 30 different sandpaintings may be associated with one ceremony.

The colours for the painting are usually accomplished with naturally coloured sand, crushed [[gypsum]] (white), yellow [[ochre]], red [[sandstone]], [[charcoal]] and a mixture of charcoal and gypsum (blue). Brown can be made by mixing red and black; red and white make pink. Other colouring agents include corn meal, flower [[pollen]], or powdered roots and bark.

The paintings are for [[healing]] purposes only. Many of them contain images of ''[[Yeii|Yeibicheii]]'' (the Holy People). While creating the painting, the medicine man will [[chant]], asking the ''yeibicheii'' to come into the painting and help heal the patient.

When the medicine man finishes painting, he checks its accuracy. The order and [[symmetry]] of the painting symbolise the harmony which a patient wishes to reestablish in his or her life. The accuracy of a sandpainting is believed to determine its efficacy as a sacred tool. The patient will be asked to sit on the sandpainting as the medicine man proceeds with the healing chant. It is claimed the sandpainting acts as a portal to attract the spirits and allow them to come and go. Practitioners believe sitting on the sandpainting helps the patient to absorb spiritual power, while in turn the Holy People will absorb the illness and take it away. Afterward, when the sandpainting has served its purpose, it is considered to be toxic, since it has absorbed the illness. For this reason, the painting is destroyed. Because of the sacred nature of the ceremonies, the sandpaintings are begun, finished, used and destroyed within 12 hours.

[[File:Navajo sand painting (00171124).jpg|thumb|left|Navajo sandpainting, photo by [[H.S. Poley]], published c. 1890-1908, Library of Congress]]

The ceremonies involving sandpaintings are usually done in sequences, termed "chants", lasting a certain number of days depending on the ceremony. At least one fresh, new sandpainting is made for each day.

Some Navajo laws and taboos relate to the sandpaintings, and protect their holiness:
* Women of child-bearing age are not supposed to sing the chants associated with the ''yeibicheii''. This is both because the ceremony has a possibility of injuring an unborn child, and because of a taboo preventing menstruating women from attending. (Some cultures considered menstruation and presence of blood to be powerful spiritual events that had to be restrained, as they represented life forces.) Post-menopausal women are more likely to be chanters or diagnosticians.
* Authentic sandpaintings are rarely photographed, so as to not disrupt the flow of the ceremony. For many reasons, medicine men will seldom allow outsiders inside a sacred ceremony. Because so many outsiders are curious about sandpainting, some medicine men may create pieces for exhibition purposes only, using reversed colours and variations. To create an authentic sandpainting solely for viewing would be a [[Sacrilege|profane]] act. The sandpaintings for sale in shops and on the Internet are commercially produced and contain deliberate errors, as the real sandpaintings are considered sacred.
* The earliest credited instance of traditional Navajo sandpaintings (being rendered in coloured sands as opposed to tapestry or other media) being created in a permanent form for sale, have been traced to between 1945 and 1955. The main credit is generally given to a Navajo Hatałii named [[Fred Stevens, Jr. (Grey Squirrel)]], who developed the primary method of "permatizing" for commercial sandpaintings that is still used.&lt;ref name=Parezo&gt;Parezo, Nancy J.

===Indigenous Australian sandpainting===
[[File:Alice Springs4263.jpg|thumb|left|Artwork in Alice Springs]]
[[Indigenous Australian art]] has a history which covers more than 30,000 years, and a wide range of native traditions and styles.  These have been studied in recent decades and their complexity has gained increased international recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Caruna, W.(2003) ''Aboriginal Art'', Thames and Hudson, London, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;  Aboriginal Art covers a wide variety of media, including sandpainting, painting on leaves, wood carving, rock carving, sculpture, and ceremonial clothing, as well as artistic embellishments found on weaponry and also tools.  Art is one of the key rituals of Aboriginal culture.  It was and still is, used to mark territory, record history, and tell stories about "[[Dreaming (spirituality)|The Dreaming]]".



Aboriginal people have taken to transforming their tradition sand paintings into more permanent forms using modern techniques and materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboriginalartdirectory.com/news/feature/ngurrara-the-great-sandy-desert-canvas.php|title=Ngurrara: The Great Sandy Desert Canvas Australian Aboriginal Art Feature at the Aboriginal Art Directory.

[[Geoffrey Bardon]] was an Australian art teacher who was instrumental in creating the [[Aboriginal art of the Western Desert]] movement, and in bringing Australian indigenous art to the attention of the world."... [directed by Bardon, the elders] began to interact with certain issues in 1960s and 70s international painting, especially the extreme schematisation of New York minimalism." In the [[History of Painting]]"Lyrical Abstraction in the late 1960s is characterised by the paintings of [[Dan Christensen]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Peter Young (artist)|Peter Young]] and others, and along with the fluxus movement and postminimalism (a term first coined by Robert Pincus-Witten in the pages of Artforum in 1969)&lt;ref name="sxdvrz"&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, Art and Auction, March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt;  sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting and minimalism by focusing on process, new materials and new ways of expression."

This connection is seen most obviously in the connection between the paintings from the late sixties of [[Peter Young (artist)]] and the paintings that follow in the early seventies produced in the [[Papunya Tula]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?ViewID=1&amp;MnuID=SRCH&amp;GalID=1&amp;SubViewID=1&amp;BioArtistIRN=22094&amp;IRN=36943]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://algusgreenspon.com/wp-content/files_mf/1362697627PY_ARtforum_1971.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201232257/http://algusgreenspon.com/wp-content/files_mf/1362697627PY_ARtforum_1971.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Papunya Tula]], or Papunya Tula Artists Pty Ltd, is an artist cooperative formed in 1972 that is owned and operated by Aboriginal people from the Western Desert of Australia. [[Kaapa Tjampitjinpa]] is one of the early Papunya Tula artists and is known for ''[[Gulgardi]]''. It is notable for being the first work by an Indigenous Australian artist to win a contemporary art award, and the first public recognition of a Papunya painting.&lt;ref name=Parezo/&gt;

=== Tibetan sandpainting ===
{{Main|Sand mandala}}[[File:348Sandbild im Sera Kloster.jpg|thumb|right|Mandala made of sand in the Sera Monastery, Lhasa]]
[[File:MandalaSable2008-05.JPG|Mandala Sable 2008-05 showing the use of [[Chak-pur]]|thumb|left]]
[[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] sand paintings usually composed ''[[mandala]]s''. In Tibetan, it is called ''dul-tson-kyil-khor'' (mandala of coloured powders).
The sand is carefully placed on a large, flat table.  The construction process takes several days, and the mandala is destroyed shortly after its completion.  This is done as a teaching tool and metaphor for the "impermanence" (Pali: ''[[anicca]]'') of all contingent and compounded phenomena (Sanskrit: ''[[Pratītya-samutpāda]]'').

The mandala sand-painting process begins with an opening ceremony, during which the ''[[lama]]s'', or Tibetan priests, consecrate the site and call forth the forces of goodness.  They chant, declare intention, ''[[mudra]]'', ''[[asana]]'', ''[[pranayama]]'', do visualisations, play music, recite ''[[mantra]]s'', etc.
[[File:Mandala zel-tary.jpg|thumb|right|Mandala zel-tary using [[Vajra]] to ceremoniously divide the painting]]
[[File:Tibetan monks, Twentse Welle.JPG|thumb|left|Tibetan monks in a ceremony after having broken their mandala, Twentse Welle]]
On the first day, the lamas begin by drawing an outline of the mandala to be painted on a wooden platform.  The following days see the laying of the coloured sands, which is effected by pouring the sand from traditional metal funnels called '''[[chak-pur]]'''. Each monk holds a ''chak-pur'' in one hand, while running a metal rod on its serrated surface; the vibration causes the sands to flow like liquid.
Formed of traditional prescribed [[iconography]] that includes [[List of geometric shapes|geometric shapes]] and a multitude of ancient spiritual symbols (e.g.: [[Ashtamangala]] and divine attributes of ''[[yidam]]''), [[seed syllables]], [[mantra]], the sand-painted mandala is used as a tool or instrument for innumerable purposes.  A primary purpose is to reconsecrate the earth and its inhabitants.
When the meditation is complete, the sand painting is ceremoniously destroyed using a [[Vajra]] and the sand is then gathered and taken to a body of water for offering.

===Japanese tray pictures===
From the 15th century in Japan, [[Buddhist]] artists in the times of the ''[[shōgun]]s'' practised the craft of ''[[bonseki]]'' by sprinkling dry coloured sand and pebbles onto the surface of plain black lacquered trays.  They used bird feathers as brushes to form the sandy surface into seascapes and landscapes.  These tray pictures were used in religious ceremonies.  Japanese esoteric Buddhism was transmitted from East Central Asia after the 8th century, and thus these Japanese Buddhist sandpaintings may share earlier historical roots with the more intricate brightly coloured Buddhist sand mandalas created by Tibetan Buddhist monks.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Table decking===
During the 17th and 18th centuries, the royal courts of Europe employed "table deckers", who decorated the side tables at royal banquets having adapted the craft of 'bonseki' from the Japanese. The table deckers sprinkled coloured sands, marble dust, sugars, etc. upon the surface of plain white tablecloths to create unfixed pictures of fruit, flowers, birds and rustic scenery. In between each design spaces were left for fruit bowls and sweetmeat dishes so that the diners could refresh themselves in between the main courses of the feast. These ornate pictures were discarded along with the debris of the feast.

As a fine example of the table deckers' craft, [[Woburn Abbey]] in [[Bedfordshire]], England possesses an ornate [[folding screen]] with three panels, decorated with sand pictures protected by glass.  The centre one has five spaces for [[sweetmeat]] pyramid dishes while the two side leaves of the screen have three spaces for fruit trays.  There are four sand pictures in each corner of the side panels of the screen, featuring 18th-century pastoral scenes, while the remaining areas of the screen are decorated with butterflies, doves, fruit, flowers, etc. The screen would be laid upon the surface of a side table.  It doubled as a serving base for elaborate porcelain dishes and glass trays containing fruits, bonbons and sweetmeats, from which the hosts and their guests could help themselves while socialising or stretching their legs between the multiple courses being served on the main table in the dining hall.  This screen may have been the work of the German artisan [[F. Schweikhardt]], who specialised in still-life studies in the style of the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Painting|painter]] [[Jan van Huysum]].

===Georgian sandpainting===
[[File:"The Hermit" - Sand Painting by Benjamin Zobel.jpg|thumb|''A Hermit by a Wayside Shrine'' by Benjamin Zobel (early 19th century)]]
Sandpainting as a craft was inspired by King George III, who was a skilled watchmaker and craftsman in his own right, and took an interest in the skills demonstrated by royal functionaries, known as Table Deckers, who decorated the white table-cloths at royal banquets with ornate centre-pieces decorated by using unfixed coloured sands and sugars as 'paint', and a bird's feather as a 'brush' a craft introduced by a European traveller who had observed the craftsmen at work in Japan.

It was while watching the table deckers at work the King suggested that if the sand pictures being temporarily laid out upon the surface of the tablecloths could be fixed permanently in place rather than being discarded with the remains of the feast, this would save much time and energy employing a multitude of skilled embroiderers toiling over such skilled work. So on one occasion the King bellowed to the craftsmen, "Why don't you fix it!" This set a number of craftsmen including Haas, Schweikhardt and [[Benjamin Zobel]] (Memmingen, Germany, 21 September 1762 - London, England, 24 October 1830), all of German origin, to, independently of each other, successfully develop suitable methods to achieve this goal, and these pictures were commissioned by the royal worthies of the day and became highly prized by the aristocracy. [[Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany|The King's brother]], the Duke of York, commissioned a number of works by Zobel and the others, although the sand artists jealously guarded their method from their competitors.
Zobel depicted "pigs in the manner of Morland"; "Nelson", the favourite dog of the Duke of York; "Tiger after George Stubbs", and an impressive "Vulture and snake."{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
Although many of Zobel's works have survived, few of those by Haas have survived the passage of time, although observers considered his work superior to that of Zobel. This may reflect the differing techniques used by each artist. A diarist observed Zobel's coating the surface of the baseboard with a mixture of [[gum arabic]] and [[white lead]] and sprinkling sand upon the sticky surface using a folded paper [[funnel]] as a brush. He had to work quickly since the adhesive would dry in a few hours. Several of his surviving pictures have unfinished work on the reverse. Haas followed more closely the techniques developed in Japan, but mixing dry powdered gum arabic with the sand, sprinkling the mixture through a sieve and using feathers as brushes to create the pictures upon the baseboard, then fixing them by some method which he kept a secret. Due to the damp conditions in many of the stately homes of the day, his pictures failed to last more than a few years. On one occasion Haas was called away while working on an unfixed sand picture. When he returned he found one of Windsor Castle's cats curled up on the picture, thus damaging it!

Eventually Zobel returned to [[Memmingen]] in Bavaria where he continued to successfully pursue his craft. Some of his work is displayed in Memmingen Town Hall. Haas was forced to give up sand painting, probably due to the ongoing disasters with his pictures. He opened a bakery in Windsor instead, and the icing on his cakes may well have been decorated with pictures in coloured sugar instead of sand.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

With the passing of these Georgian craftsmen and the disposal of the Duke of York's collection the interest and skills evolved in sand picture work declined. The only Royal personage to take further interest in the craft was the late Queen Mary, consort to King George V, who bequeathed her Georgian sand paintings to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], and her collection of [[Isle of Wight]] sand pictures to [[Carisbrooke Castle|Carisbrooke Castle Museum]] on the Isle of Wight.

In the first half of the 20th century Lt. Colonel Rybot was a keen collector of sand paintings, which were the source material of the articles written on the subject in the arts and crafts magazines of the day. Eventually 37 of his collection of sand paintings were the main feature at an auction held at [[Sotheby's]] New Bond Street gallery on 15 June 1956.

===Victorian sand picture souvenirs===

Thousands of sites exist where it is possible to collect natural coloured sands for craftwork, with an enormous range of colours being available around the globe varying with the contents of the mineral charged waters leaching through the sands. But for the tourist the vertical sand cliffs at [[Alum Bay]] on the Isle of Wight form the central portion of a visual geological phenomenon (best viewed after a shower of rain) which encapsulates the impressive chalk spires of [[The Needles]] and [[Tennyson Downs]]. Although tourists are no longer encouraged to obtain their own sand from the cliffs, numerous companies on the Island sell sand for the purpose of Sandpainting.

After her marriage to Prince Albert and having chosen [[Osborne House]] near [[Cowes]] to be her new family retreat, [[Queen Victoria]] was the prime mover in the gentrification of this former backwater, local artisans benefitted from the influx of wealthy visitors, and a number of craftsmen sold their fixed sand pictures and unfixed sand jars featuring views of the Island as unique keepsakes of the Isle of Wight.

Some of these sand pictures were small and crude and left unsigned, but Edwin and John Dore of Arreton produced some fine work in the 1840s. The pictures were of postcard size and the subject matter local views such as Carisbrooke Castle, and other touristy subjects. Edwin always signed his quaint pictures in a fine hand with a mapping pen and Indian ink, one of his most successful mass-produced subjects being 'Collecting birds eggs on Needles Cliffs'. John Dore used a card embellished with a printed border of lace design on which to execute his sand pictures although the quality of his work was inferior to that of his brother.

Few of the Island sand artists filled in the sky, giving that detail a light colourwash as a finishing touch, sometimes leaving doors and windows free of sand which would be blocked in with Indian ink. In the 1860s and 1870s J. Symons of Cowes kept up the good work, producing local views much larger than postcard size, mounted in glazed oak or maple frames and signed with the artist's signature on the reverse.
The father and son team the Neates of Newport sold their works from a stall outside Carisbrooke Castle gates where visitors were offered sand pictures and sand jars priced from 1/- to 2/6 each and the son grew his fingernails abnormally long in order to distribute the sand on his pictures.
During the 1930s and 1940s R.J.Snow of Lake came nearest to producing sand pictures in the manner of the Georgian craftsmen, but postcard size, although he did produce some fine commissioned work, particularly a view of Oddicombe in Devon, in which the sea and sky were also 'painted' in sand, but after the war years the quality of the postcard sand pictures deteriorated with the mass-produced article with little taste or skill being offered for sale for a few shillings.

===Sand bottles===

[[File:Sand Bottle - Andrew Clemens, 1879.jpg|thumb|right|Sand bottle by Andrew Clemens, 1879]]

In the 1860s to 1890s, [[Andrew Clemens]] a [[deaf mute]] born in Dubuque, Iowa, USA became famous for his craft of creating unfixed pictures using multicoloured sands compressed inside glass bottles or ornate chemist jars. The sand was collected from the bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River. The subjects of his sand bottles included ornately decorated sentimental verses, sailing ships, plants, animals and portraits. 

He exhibited his work at the St. Louis trade fair and having spent hours creating a picture in a bottle would demonstrate to an incredulous audience that the picture inside was unfixed by destroying the bottle with a hammer. Clemens' sand bottles have become museum pieces and highly prized antiques which have since sold at auction for thousands of US dollars.

===Sand carpets===
[[File:Zandtapijt in Drentse keuken.jpg|thumb|Sandpainting on the tiled floor (on the wall are handpainted decorated tiles)]]
[[File:Plaza-centro.jpg|thumb|"Carpet" of land in the Town Hall Square in La Orotava [[Tenerife]] in celebration of Corpus Christi.]]
In the province of [[Drenthe]] in the Netherlands in the late 19th, early 20th centuries it was custom to use a stiff broom to sweep patterns in white sand to form simple decorations on the tiled floors of the houses, mostly for special occasions or celebrations. The next day it was swept up.
This custom was also practised in Northern Belgium by the Dutch speaking communities while in
Hekelgem, 1973 was the centenary year of the craft of "Old Zandtapijt". The hotels and cafes would employ artisans to strew ornate sand pictures in unfixed coloured sands on the tiled floors of their premises to encourage passing tourists to halt and enjoy local hospitality on their way towards Brussels. Roger de Boeck, born in 1930, was a well-respected exponent of this craft, who used glue to fix his sand pictures to a suitable base selling them to visitors to his atelier. In addition to biblical scenes, his finest works included a portrait of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]] 1953, and [[John F. Kennedy|US president John Kennedy]], in the early 60s. This craft continues, and a booklet to celebrate the centenary was published on 1 February 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[[:nl:Hekelgemse zandschilderkunst]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern culture==
[[File:Asynchronous Syntropy.jpg|thumb|left|"Asynchronous [[Syntropy]]" painting using coloured sand as seen at The Museum of Arts and Design "Swept Away" exhibit May 2012]]
In modern days, sandpainting is most often practised during [[Day of the Dead|Dia de los Muertos]] (Day of the Dead) in Mexico and the United States. Streets are decorated with sand paintings that are later swept away, symbolising the fleeting nature of life. Of note are the sandpaintings done during the [[Seattle]] [[Festál#Mexico: Día de Muertos|Dia De Muertos Festival]], but the most exciting development has been the Performance Art of Sand Animation which has created a new wave of younger artists and also revived interest in all types of sand painting.

A number of [[contemporary art]]ists use sand in ways that depart from specific cultural traditions exploring techniques by raking sand, pouring it, carving it, creating unique designs. The works are [[ephemeral]] and are primarily shared through documentation or part of a live performance.

===Present-day sand painting techniques===
[[File:Sand Painting of Mrs. Thatcher the 'Iron Lady' incorporating magnetised iron filings in the composition.jpg|thumb|upright|Brian Pike's 1985 portrait of [[Margaret Thatcher]] incorporates magnetised iron filings in the composition]]

Most artists use naturally occurring oxidised and mineral-charged coloured sands, adding powdered charcoal to widen the palette and in some instances idiosyncratic materials such as iron filings or discarded stonemasons' dust from ecclesiastical sites. Other artists use industrial tinted [[quartz]] sands with a capacity to resist [[intemperie]] action and a new generation of strong adhesives.  The work is protected with a coat of spray varnish. No protective glass frame is needed with the sands and the adhesives since the paintings have proved to resist the effect of direct sunlight without any yellowing of the varnish

'''''Sappho and Alcaeus''''' is an 1881 oil painting by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]].  It is held by the [[Walters Art Museum]] in Baltimore.

The painting measures {{convert|66|x|122|cm}}.  It depicts a concert in the late 7th century BC, with the poet [[Alcaeus of Mytilene]] playing the [[kithara]].  In the audience is fellow [[Lesbos|Lesbian]] poet [[Sappho]], accompanied by several of her female friends.  Sappho is paying close attention to the performance, resting her arm on a cushion which bears a [[laurel wreath]], presumably intended for the performer. The painting illustrates a passage by the poet [[Hermesianax]], recorded by [[Athenaeus]] in his ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'' ("The Philosophers' Banquet"), book 13, page 598.

The location, with tiers of white marble seating, is based on the [[Theatre of Dionysus]] in Athens, but Alma-Tadema has replaced the original inscribed names of Athenians with the names of Sappho's friends.  In the background, the Aegean Sea can be seen through some trees.

The painting was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1881, and depicted in [[William Powell Frith]]'s ''[[A Private View at the Royal Academy, 1881]]'', to the far right, being inspected by[[John Everett Millais]].   It was highly praised by critics: ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'' described it as "marbellous".  It was acquired by [[William Thompson Walters]] of Baltimore, and on his death in 1894 it was inherited by his son [[Henry Walters]], who left it to the Walters Art Museum on his own death in 1931.

{{Sikhism sidebar}}
'''Sikh music''' or '''Shabad kirtan''' is [[Kirtan]]-style singing of [[hymns]] or [[Shabad (hymn)|Shabad]] from the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the central text of [[Sikhism]].

It began in the late 16th century as the [[musical expression]] of mystical poetry, accompanied by a musical instrument ''rabab'', by [[Bhai Mardana]] an early follower of [[Guru Nanak]] –the founder of [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref name=shacklemandairxxiii&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christopher Shackle|author2=Arvind Mandair|title=Teachings of the Sikh Gurus: Selections from the Sikh Scriptures |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftdcvmviy_8C |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-45108-9 |pages=xxiii-xxiv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Nanak, all the [[Sikh]] gurus sang in the then-prevalent classical and folk music styles, accompanied by stringed and percussion instruments. The style was where the text was of prime significance and the music played a supporting, albeit important, role. The Gurus specified the [[Raga|raag]] for each hymn in the Sikh sacred scripture, the [[Guru Granth Sahib]].&lt;ref name=shacklemandairxxiii/&gt;

Significant efforts have been under way since the 1970s to revive the rich Sikh music tradition initiated and developed by the Sikh Gurus.{{dubious|date=April 2018}} Various terms used to refer to this tradition include ''Shabad keertan parampara'', ''Gurbani sangeet parampara'' and ''Gurmat sangeet''.

==Practice==
Devotional and communal singing in Sikhism is called ''[[Kirtan]]''.&lt;ref name="JacobsenMyrvold2012p112"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair|title=Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vdhLAQAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-4411-0231-7 |pages=24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically performed at [[Gurdwaras]] (Sikh temples) but can be done publicly 'on the move' as ''[[Nagar Kirtan]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=H. S.|title=The Encyclopedia of Sikhism|date=2005|publisher=Hemkunt Publishers|isbn=8170103010|page=150|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein Sikh scriptures and legends are recited in a song, set to a certain ''[[raga|Raga]]'' and ''[[Tala (music)|Taal]]'' and accompanied with music using the ''[[Sargam_(music)|Sargram]]'' notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mandair|first1=Arvind-Pal|title=Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=9781441117083|page=214|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shabad Kirtan'' refers to the musical recitation of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the primary scripture in the Sikhism tradition which is also arranged according to ''[[raga]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Knut A. Jacobsen|author2=Kristina Myrvold|title=Sikhs Across Borders: Transnational Practices of European Sikhs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HtrWKPWBEXEC |year=2012|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4411-7087-3 |page=113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Shabad Kirtan'' can be listened to silently or sung along with the gathered congregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anand|first1=Balwant|title=Guru Nanak His Life was his Message: a Biography|date=1983|publisher=Guru Nanak Foundation|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JacobsenMyrvold2012p112"/&gt;

''Kirtan'' in Sikh history has been the musical analog of ''Kathas'' recitation, both preferably performed by ''ragi jatha'', or professional trained performers.&lt;ref name="JacobsenMyrvold2012p112"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Knut A.

== Sikh musical instruments ==
The Gurus themselves created numourous musical instruments including the [[Dilruba]], the [[Sarangi]], the [[Esraj]] and a modification of the [[Pakhawaj]] creating an early form of the [[Tabla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sikh sacred music|date=1967|publisher=Sikh Sacred Music Society|page=63|location=Oxon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Narayan|first1=Badri|title=Culture and Emotional Economy of Migration|date=2017|publisher=Routledge|page=75|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt; Till the 1980s most of these instruments had become almost extinct but the renewed interests and the revival of the Shabad Kirtan and other music of the Sikh history brought them back to popularity.{{dubious|date=April 2018}}

== Sikh musicians ==
Three types of Sikh musicians that are rababis, ragis, and dhad.

== Ragas==
{{Main article|Ragas in the Guru Granth Sahib}}
Ragas have a direct relationship to human moods and the following are the connections between [[Raga]]s and feeling:{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

A raga is a complex structure of musical melody used in Indian classical music. It is a set of rules of how to build a melody which can ignite a certain mood[1] in the reciter and listeners. The Sikh holy scripture, Guru Granth Sahib, is composed in and divided by 60 ragas. Each raga is a chapter or section in the Guru Granth Sahib starting with Asaa raag, and all the hymns produced in Asaa raag are found in this section ordered chronologically by the Guru or other Bhagat that have written hymns in that raga. There are many websites on the internet giving wrong information about raags. 

Following is the list of all sixty Raags under which Gurbani is written, in order of appearance.

Raags are used in Sikh music simply to create a mood, and are not restricted to particular times. A mood can be created by the music of the raag regardless of the time of day. There are a total of 60 raags or melodies within the Guru Granth Sahib. Each melody sets a particular mood for the hymn, adding a deeper dimension to it. The Guru Granth Sahib is incorrectly thought by many to have just 31 raags or melodies. Raag data kindly provided by Prof. Surinder Singh from Raj Academy (UK). 




1. Raag Aasaa (ਆਸਾ) – Aasaa has strong emotions of inspiration and courage. This Raag gives the listener the determination and ambition to put aside any excuses and to proceed with the necessary action to achieve the aim. It generates feelings of passion and zeal to succeed and the energy generated from these feelings enables the listener to find the strength from within to achieve success, even when the achievement seems difficult. The determined mood of this Raag ensures that failure is not an option and motivates the listener to be inspired. 

2. Raag Gujari (ਗੂਜਰੀ) – If there is a perfect simile for Raag Gujari, it would be that of a person isolated in the desert, who has their hands cupped, holding water. However, it is only when the water begins to slowly seep through their joined hands that the person comes to realise the real value and importance of the water. Similarly Raag Gujari leads the listener to realise and become aware of passing time and in this way comes to value the precious nature of time itself. The revelation brings the listener to an awareness and admission of their own death and mortality, making them utilize their remaining ‘life time’ more wisely. 

3. Raag Gauri Deepaki (ਗਉੜੀ ਦੀਪਕੀ) – In the Guru Granth Sahib, there is one shabad (hymn) under the title Raag Gauri Deepaki. In this shabad, Sohila is a lorrie (lullaby), which is narrating a kind of bedtime story. This Raag generates feelings of warmth and security, just like a mother singing a lullaby to her child. Lullabies were traditionally used not only as a way of comforting a child, but also as a means in which mothers shared their past experiences and knowledge. Similarly this Raag enlightens the listener through knowledge and experience and brings them to the realization that to gain the truth, you must first realize that you are in darkness. This enlightened state gives the listener a feeling of certainty, fearlessness and a new hope for the future. 

4. Raag Dhanasari (ਧਨਾਸਰੀ) – Dhanasari is a sense of being completely carefree. This sensation arises from a feeling of contentment and ‘richness’ from the things we have in our lives and gives the listener a positive and optimistic attitude towards the future. 

5. Raag Gauri Purbi (ਗਉੜੀ ਪੂਰਬੀ) – Gauri Purbi contains strong emotions of experience along with feelings of preparation, in order to go further and to achieve more. Although there are confident feelings in this Raag, there is a sense of uncertainty as there is a heartfelt request for help to achieve the desired goal. The sentiments of this Raag are well considered assessments of the circumstances, without excess confidence or extreme helplessness. 

6. Raag Siri Raag (ਸਿਰੀ ਰਾਗੁ) – The basis of this Raag is steeped in the traditions of mainstream Indian Classical music. Siri Raag is serious and thought provoking in its nature and creates an atmosphere where the listener is led to heed the advice given therein. The listener (the mind) is made aware of the truth of the message and with this ‘education’ is given the strength to face the future with both humility and the ‘gained’ knowledge. 

7. Raag Majh (ਮਾਝ) – Raag Majh was composed by the Fifth Sikh Guru (Shri Guru Arjun Dev ji). The Raag’s origins are based in Punjabi Folk Music and its essence was inspired by the Majha regions traditions of ‘Ausian’; the game of waiting and yearning for the return of a loved one. The feelings evoked by this Raag have often been compared to that of a mother waiting for her child to return after a long period of separation. She has an anticipation and hope for the child’s return, although at the same moment she is painfully aware of the uncertainty of their return home. This Raag brings to life the emotion of extreme love and this is highlighted by the sorrow and anguish of separation. 

8. Raag Gauri Guarairi (ਗਉੜੀ ਗੁਆਰੇਰੀ) – Gauri Guarairi contains a mixture of calmness and control in feeling, however the emotional message of the Raag is open and truthful in its approach. The emotions are conveyed in a direct and disciplined way. The balanced and focused character of this Raag is evident in its structure, in that its scale is restricted to ‘madh saptak’ (middle scale). 

9. Raag Gauri (ਗਉੜੀ) – Gauri creates a mood where the listener is encouraged to strive harder in order to achieve an objective. However, the encouragement given by the Raag does not allow the ego to increase. This therefore creates the atmosphere where the listener is encouraged, but still prevented from becoming arrogant and self-important. 

10. Raag Gauri Dakhani (ਗਉੜੀ ਦਖਣੀ) – Gauri Dakhani has a similar nature to Gauri; however, the South Indian style of this Raag, including the taal (rhythm) highlights the strict and disciplined aspect of Gauri. 

11. Raag Gauri Chayti (ਗਉੜੀ ਚੇਤੀ) – Gauri Chayti generates a deliberate sensation of fear by creating a conscious reminder of what may occur if we loose the things we take for granted. It awakens feelings of panic and regret, by exposing the listener to the possible outcome of what might happen should this warning not be heeded. 

12. Raag Gauri Bairagan (ਗਉੜੀ ਬੈਰਾਗਣਿ) – As the title suggests Gauri ‘Bairagan’ is a Raag of bairaag (sadness of separation). The listener is left with an intense feeling of sorrow and emptiness. However, the balance of Raag Gauri ensures that this sense of loss and sadness motivates the listener to try to discover exactly what is missing. Gauri Bairagan therefore evokes feelings of sadness, which become a lesson, as opposed to creating a sense of depression. 

13. Raag Gauri Purbi Deepaki (ਗਉੜੀ ਪੂਰਬੀ ਦੀਪਕੀ) – The tone of this Raag is that of self-assessment with a positive attitude of improvement. It creates an atmosphere of constantly progressing with confidence and experience, as well as instilling a positive belief of enduring achievement. 

14. Raag Gauri Majh (ਗਉੜੀ ਮਾਝ) – Gauri Majh is a well-planned emotional ‘act’, which reaches out to fulfil a yearning created by the Raag. This yearning is similar to that of Raag Majh’s regret, hope and anticipation, however in this instance it is created deliberately in order to sway the listener to react to the longing. 

15. Raag Gauri Malva (ਗੌੜੀ ਮਾਲਵਾ) – Gauri Malva is based on Punjabi Folk music and is influenced by the ‘Malva’ region of Punjab and the Malvaee hospitality. The nature of this Raag can be compared to the thoughtful, very serious, yet caring advice given by a true friend. The Raag persuades the listener with such truth and friendliness, that it is impossible to disagree, even if the listener does not like the advice being given. 

16. Raag Gauri Mala (ਗਉੜੀ ਮਾਲਾ) – The essence of Gauri Mala is a combination of good, pure, true and positive thoughts added together one by one. There is a feeling of having worked hard and an increased energy, which encourages more devotion towards the truth. 

17. Raag Gauri Sorath (ਗਉੜੀ ਸੋਰਠਿ) – Gauri Sorath has a definite feeling of attraction and appeal, which woos the listener’s attention to the subject matter or target. However, the feelings of being enticed and lured are balanced with a sense of duty and realisation, of needing to obey the warning given. 

18. Raag Aasaa Kafi (ਆਸਾ ਕਾਫੀ) – Aasaa Kafi has a carefree and self-assured nature. It is confident in its outlook and does not hold onto any false hopes. The feelings of boundless energy, along with the confidence gained by previous experiences, create an inspirational atmosphere for the listener. 

19. Raag Asavari (ਆਸਾਵਰੀ) – Asavari has an atmosphere of real energy and enthusiasm, which encourages the listener to complete the necessary tasks. However, the mood of this Raag is genuine and there is therefore no pretence of showing off its hardworking nature. 

20. Raag Aasaa Asavari (ਆਸਾ ਆਸਾਵਰੀ) – Aasaa Asavari provides a sense of assurance to achieve your desired goal with courage, love and confidence. It is a precise direction toward achieving a set outcome, with confidence and positivity fuelled with a burst of energy. The nature of this raag is to produce a strong sense of capability in the listener, converting energy into passion with the motivation to repeat this positivity. The strength of this raag churns out the best of a personality providing the individual with the necessary knowledge to bring thoughts into action. 

21. Raag Devgandhari (ਦੇਵਗੰਧਾਰੀ) – Devgandhari conveys the feeling of satisfaction that comes from making an achievement. These emotions make the listener feel empowered to do more and diminish any feelings of laziness. This state of satisfaction is that of extreme happiness and contentment, and leaves the listener with the feeling of being in paradise. 

22. Raag Bihagara (ਬਿਹਾਗੜਾ) – The mood of Bihagara is that of extreme sadness and pain, which gives rise to the need to find peace and understanding. The heightened emotional state of sadness is only harnessed by the craving for truth and meaning. 

23. Raag Vadhans (ਵਡਹੰਸੁ) – Vadhans is based on Punjabi Folk music and is set in the traditions of ‘Ghoreea’, ‘Suhag’ and ‘Alohnian’. The feelings instilled by this Raag can be compared to those of a bride on the day of her wedding; she is happy and sad. Although she is going to her groom, who fills her with hope and joy, she is also sad to be leaving her family. 

24. Raag Vadhans Dakhani (ਵਡਹੰਸੁ ਦਖਣੀ) – The mood of this Raag is very similar to Raag Vadhans, however due to its South Indian style of expression, it is more disciplined in its nature. 

25. Raag Sorath (ਸੋਰਠਿ) – Sorath conveys the feeling of having such a strong belief in something that you want to keep repeating the experience. In fact this feeling of certainty is so strong that you become the belief and live that belief. The atmosphere of Sorath is so powerful, that eventually even the most unresponsive listener will be attracted. 

26. Raag Jaitsiri (ਜੈਤਸਰੀ) – Jaitsiri conveys the heartfelt emotion of not being able to live without someone. Its mood is preoccupied with feelings of dependence and an overwhelming sense of desperately reaching out to be with that person. 

27. Raag Todi (ਟੋਡੀ) – Todi consists of both wisdom and humbleness. It is through these sentiments that the Raag takes a simple approach to explain things that we may be aware of, but fail to ponder upon. The Raag draws the attention of the listener to contemplate these things and gives an explanation with such conviction, that we are compelled to agree. 

28. Raag Bairari (ਬੈਰਾੜੀ) – Bairari stimulates the feeling of improving and continuing with a task, which has already been accomplished. It is an unmoving belief that what has been achieved is true and positive, which leads to a hunger and desire to progress to the next stage. Although there is immense confidence in the achievement, there is no conceit or vanity in the accomplishment. 

29. Raag Tilang (ਤਿਲੰਗ) – Tilang is full of the feeling of having tried hard to impress, but the feeling that the effort made has not been appreciated. However, the atmosphere is not of anger or upset, but of brooding, as the person you are trying to impress is very dear to you. 

30. Raag Tilang Kafi (ਤਿਲੰਗ ਕਾਫੀ) – As with Tilang, this Raag contains the feeling that your effort has been unappreciated, when trying to impress someone. However, in contrast to Raag Tilang, the individual is unperturbed by this feeling. This differentiating aspect arises from the deep love for the person concerned, which prevents the individual from becoming annoyed at the apparent lack of approval. 

31. Raag Suhi (ਸੂਹੀ) – Suhi is an expression of such devotion that the listener experiences feelings of extreme closeness and undying love. The listener is bathed in that love and genuinely comes to know what it means to adore. 

32. Raag Suhi Kafi (ਸੂਹੀ ਕਾਫੀ) – Suhi Kafi expresses feelings of deep love and security, like that of a child and a parent. A young child feels secure and safe, when surrounded in their parents love. The love felt is so strong that there are no worries and the individual gains a certain confidence from being so secure. 

33. Raag Suhi Lalit (ਸੂਹੀ ਲਲਿਤ) – Suhi Lalit contains feelings of emotional resolve. However, there is also a volatile characteristic in that although there is love in these emotions, there is a willingness to step over the line to attain the goal. 

34. Raag Bilaval (ਬਿਲਾਵਲ) – Bilaval conveys the emotions of great happiness that come from having attained a goal or achieved an aim. It is an overwhelming feeling of fulfilment, satisfaction and joy, that is experienced when the accomplishments is very important and dear to you. The happiness felt is like laughing out loud, there is no planning or any ulterior motive; it’s just a natural expression of heartfelt happiness arising from a sense of achievement. 

35. Raag Bilaval Dakhani (ਬਿਲਾਵਲ ਦਖਣੀ) – This Raag is full of energy, which is shown by the fast rhythm and singing of the South Indian style of expression. The feelings of Bilaval Dakhani are of confidence and happiness, which arises from having achieved the unachievable. 

36. Raag Gond (ਗੋਂਡ) – Gond is an expression of triumph, however these feelings are balanced and in perspective ensuring that there is also an aspect of humility. Therefore, although there is a sense of knowing and understanding the achievement, there is not a feeling of becoming obsessed or getting lost in the achievement itself. 

37. Raag Bilaval Gond (ਬਿਲਾਵਲ ਗੋਂਡ) – Bilaval Gond consists of emotions of courage and conviction. The atmosphere created by the Raag is that of abstract happiness, however it is still disciplined enough to not be out of control. This Raag expresses its emotions poignantly, with insight and has a thoughtful strategy. It expresses feelings of confidence and happiness, but without any pride. 

38. Raag Ramkali (ਰਾਮਕਲੀ) – The emotions in Ramkali are like those of a wise teacher disciplining their student. The student is aware of the pain of learning, but is still conscious of the fact that ultimately it is for the best. In this way Ramkali conveys the change from all that we are familiar with, to something we are certain will be better. 

39. Raag Ramkali Dakhani (ਰਾਮਕਲੀ ਦਖਣੀ) – The emotions created by Ramkali Dakhani are those of change from old to new and there is a surety that this alteration is advantageous. These feelings are highlighted and emphasised by the South Indian rhythm and style of expression. 

40. Raag Nat Narayan (ਨਟ ਨਾਰਾਇਨ) – Nat Narayan consists of feelings of hastiness and impatience, however simultaneously there is stability and control. Although there is control in the Raag, there is still the impression that it is unbalanced and prone to topple at any time. 

41. Raag Nat (ਨਟ) – Nat creates the impression of being wild and uncontrollable and appears extreme in its feeling. It conveys the feeling of being out of control and on the edge, however it returns from the brink, by reestablishing control and stability, and hence creating a sense of relief. This Raag uses its expertise in this way to create feelings of suspense. 

42. Raag Mali Gaura (ਮਾਲੀ ਗਉੜਾ) – Mali Gaura conveys the confidence of an expert, whose knowledge is self-evident in both their outlook and actions. This knowledge is learned through experience and therefore creates an air of ‘coolness’. However, this sense of ‘coolness’ is an aspect of true happiness because you have learned how to manage things with expertise and skill. 

43. Raag Maru (ਮਾਰੂ) – Maru was traditionally sung on the battlefield in preparation for war. This Raag has an aggressive nature, which creates an inner strength and power to express and emphasise the truth, regardless of the consequences. Maru’s nature conveys the fearlessness and strength that ensures the truth is spoken, no matter what the cost. 

44. Raag Maru Kafi (ਮਾਰੂ ਕਾਫੀ) – Although Maru Kafi is forceful and blunt in its nature, it still expresses its emotions in a sweet and attractive way. This Raag is uncompromising in its nature, yet it retains the ability and charm to win the listener over with its relaxed and self-assured approach. As the listener, it makes you feel willing to listen even though the sentiments are harsh and direct. 

45. Raag Maru Dakhani (ਮਾਰੂ ਦਖਣੀ) – Maru Dakhani expresses feelings of truth and reality in an uncompromising and outspoken way, which is emphasised by the South Indian style of expression and taal. 

46. Raag Tukhari (ਤੁਖਾਰੀ) – Tukhari conveys the soul’s strong ambition to highlight the greatness of The Creator to the mind. This goal is of paramount importance to the soul and it will therefore, not give up even if stubborn mind is unresponsive. This Raag illustrates the soul’s focus on its goal, by conveying its message to the mind directly and then adopting a softer approach. The feelings of this Raag are dominated by the soul’s burning desire to convince the mind to follow its plan of enlightenment and hence becoming one with Akaal (God). 

47. Raag Kedara (ਕੇਦਾਰਾ) – Kedara expresses and makes the mind aware of the true character and nature of the soul. It conveys the emotions of honesty, integrity and truthfulness in a practical and caring way. This approach highlights the soul’s character and is memorable, so that the mind is made aware, without arousing cynicism. 

48. Raag Bhairao (ਭੇਰੳ) – Bhairao embodies the soul’s faith and heartfelt devotion towards The Creator. It is a kind of fanaticism, where there is a feeling of not being aware or caring about anything else. The emotions conveyed are those of contentment and of being absorbed in a steadfast belief or faith. In this Raag, the soul is relaying the happiness that the mind could potentially experience if it joined in with this devotion 

49. Raag Basant (ਬਸੰਤੁ) – Basant denotes the changing of the season and the newness of spring. This Raag encourages the mind to brush away its selfishness, just like spring-cleaning removes all the cobwebs and creates a fresh start. There are feelings of hope and expectation of a new beginning and the start of a new cycle. However, these emotions are not dependent on the physical change of the season, but are an encouragement of an internal effort to change. 

50. Raag Basant Hindol (ਬਸੰਤੁ ਹਿੰਡੋਲ) – Basant Hindol conveys the freshness and happiness of a new start and expresses the type of contentment, which comes from working hard to make a change. This Raag is full of hope and creates a sense of being at ease and being satisfied because a new chapter is beginning. 

51. Raag Sarang (ਸਾਰੰਗ) – Sarangs character is soothing and has the ability to extinguish the minds smouldering selfishness and negative nature. The emotions of Sarang quench the minds burning desires, by expressing and highlighting the soul’s pure and true thoughts. This is a positive and fulfilling change. 

52. Raag Malhar (ਮਲਾਰ) – Malhar is a communication of feelings from the soul, to show the mind how to become cool and refreshed. The mind is always burning with the desire to reach its goals quickly and without effort, however the emotions conveyed in this Raag are able to bring composure and fulfilment to the mind. It is able to bring the mind into this calmness, bringing a sense of satisfaction and contentment. 

53. Raag Kaanara (ਕਾਨੜਾ) – Kaanara invokes feelings of being overcome by a personality, which is so impressive that its character is difficult to stop thinking about.

54. Raag Kalian (ਕਲਿਆਨ) – Kalian has a forceful, yet flexible nature. It conveys a desire for something and a resolve to attain it, by whatever means possible. Although determined in its desire, Kalian sometimes uses an accommodating approach and at other times has an aggressive approach, in order to reach its goal. This Raag has a determined, forceful, yet persuasive character, through which it fulfils its desire. 

55. Raag Kalian Bhopali (ਕਲਿਆਨ ਭੋਪਾਲੀ) – Kalian Bhopali’s nature is direct and insistent. Just as in Kaliyaan, this Raag conveys the feeling of determination to fulfil its desires. However, in contrast it is not flexible in its approach, as the desired goal is tackled head-on and in a regimented fashion. There is no hesitation and it is only focused on its goal. 

56. Raag Parbhati Bibhas (ਪ੍ਰਭਾਤੀ ਬਿਭਾਸ) – Parbhati Bibhas expresses the feelings of compromise between the mind and the soul; a common understanding between the selfishness of the mind and the devotion of the soul evolves. The atmosphere created is like the calmness and serenity of daybreak, along with a sense of preparation for the day to unfold. The ‘partaal’ rhythm represents the change in the method, which is induced by compromise, however it also highlights the balance of concentration. 

57. Raag Parbhati (ਪ੍ਰਭਾਤੀ) – The emotions conveyed in Parbhati are those of extreme devotion; there is an intense confidence and love for the entity it is devoted to. This affection arises from knowledge, common sense and a detailed study. There is therefore an understanding and a considered will to devote itself to that entity. 

58. Raag Parbhati Dakhani (ਪ੍ਰਭਾਤੀ ਦਖਣੀ) – The nature of Parbhati Dakhani is very similar to that of Parbhati, except that the feelings of devotion are more disciplined. This discipline arises from the South Indian style of expression of this Raag. 

59. Raag Bibhas Parbhati (ਬਿਭਾਸ ਪ੍ਰਭਾਤੀ) – Bibhas Parbhati has a self-assured character and has a sense of certainty, which arises from the knowledge gained through awareness. It conveys the wisdom achieved from learning, which inspires contentment. However, this wisdom is not arrogant, but is gentle in its persuasion because there is not a need to ‘show-off’ this knowledge, but a desire to share it, so the recipient is able to learn. 

60. Raag Jaijavanti (ਜੈਜਾਵੰਤੀ) – Jaijavanti expresses the feeling of happiness and satisfaction of achievement, however it simultaneously conveys the sadness of losing. An apt simile for this Raag is that of a king winning a battle, however he is then told that his son has perished on the battlefield. This Raag conveys a sense of having to put your duty first, no matter what your inner feelings may be. The duality of the emotions of joy and sorrow help to keep you stable and prevent you reveling in your own achievement. 

In addition to raag names, there exists an indication in the titles of hymns called ''ghar''. The precise meaning of ''ghar'' is not fully understood, although recent research proposes it refers to raag variants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaur|first1=Inderjit|title=The meaning of ghar in shabad headings of Guru Granth Sahib|date=December 6, 2008|access-date=December 13, 2017|url=http://www.sikhmusicheritage.org/ghar2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Films ==
{{main|List of films featuring eclipses}}
There is a body of films featuring [[solar eclipse]]s. Compared to other astronomical events featured in films, such as [[full moon]]s and [[asteroid]] strikes, solar eclipses are less commonly seen. When they have featured in films, they often drive the plot and have a portentous presence.&lt;ref name="hickman"&gt;{{cite news | last=Hickman | first=Matt | url=https://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/blogs/movies-solar-eclipses-starring-role | title=9 movies starring solar eclipses | work=MNN | publisher=[[Mother Nature Network]] | date=August 8, 2017 | accessdate=September 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NPR]]'s Glen Weldon said that films use eclipses "to signal to audiences that the normal rules have temporarily lifted, and things are about to get weird." The first film to feature a solar eclipse was the 1907 silent film ''[[The Eclipse, or the Courtship of the Sun and Moon]]'', which featured a solar eclipse as a fantastical consummation between the sun and the moon.&lt;ref name="weldon"&gt;{{cite news | last=Weldon | first=Glen | url=https://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2017/08/17/543962064/in-movies-a-solar-eclipse-means-change-is-coming | title=In Movies, A Solar Eclipse Means Change Is Coming | work=npr.org | publisher=[[NPR]] | date=August 17, 2017 | accessdate=September 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eclipses have been seen as bad omens throughout history and filmmakers leverage that belief "as visual cues or key plot points", according to ''[[The Oregonian]]''{{'}}s Amy Wang.&lt;ref name="wang"&gt;{{cite news | last=Wang | first=Amy | url=http://www.oregonlive.com/eclipse/2017/08/15_movies_where_eclipses_play.html | title=15 movies that include eclipses (not always accurately) | work=[[The Oregonian]] | date=August 6, 2017 | accessdate=September 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most accurate depiction of a solar eclipse in film is seen in the 1961 religious epic film ''[[Barabbas (1961 film)|Barabbas]]'', which included film of an actual solar eclipse during a crucifixion scene.&lt;ref name="white"&gt;{{cite news | last=White | first=Amy | url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/8/18/16158544/solar-eclipses-science-fiction | title=Solar eclipses have been a science fiction theme for thousands of years | work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] | date=August 18, 2017 | accessdate=September 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:'Spoliarium' by Juan Luna.jpg|thumbnail|right|''Spoliarium'' as displayed in the National Museum of the Philippines]]

The '''''Spoliarium''''' (often misspelled ''Spolarium'') is a painting by [[Filipino people|Filipino]] painter [[Juan Luna]]. The painting was submitted by Luna to the ''Exposición Nacional de Bellas Artes'' in 1884 in [[Madrid]], where it garnered the first gold medal (out of three).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boe.es/datos/pdfs/BOE//1884/164/A00694-00694.pdf Gaceta de Madrid, no. 164, 12/06/1884, p. 694]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, it was sold to the ''Diputación Provincial de Barcelona'' for 20,000 [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]]. It currently hangs in the main gallery at the ground floor of the [[National Museum of Fine Arts (Manila)|National Museum of Fine Arts]] in [[Manila]], and is the first work of art that greets visitors upon entry into the museum. The picture recreates a despoiling scene in a [[Circus (building)|Roman circus]] where dead [[gladiator]]s are stripped of weapons and garments.

Luna, working on [[canvas]], spent eight months completing the painting which depicts dying gladiators. Filipino historian [[Ambeth Ocampo]] writes, "...the fact remains that when Luna and Félix Resurrección Hidalgo won the top awards in the Madrid Exposition of 1884, they proved to the world that ''indios'' could, despite their supposed barbarian race, paint better than the Spaniards who colonized them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Ocampo | first =Ambeth R. | title =Rizal Without the Overcoat | publisher =Anvil Publishing | year = 2000 |}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Jose Rizal and the Spoliarium ==
At a gathering of Filipino expatriates in Madrid, [[Jose Rizal]] enthusiastically toasted the triumphs his two compatriots had achieved, the other being [[Félix Resurrección Hidalgo|Félix Hidalgo]] who won a silver medal, calling it "fresh proof of racial equality".&lt;ref name=guerrero1974&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guerrero|first1=Leon |title=The First Filipino: A Biography of José Rizal |date=1974 |publisher=National Historical Commission |location=Manila |page=112 |edition=5th |url=http://www.xeniaeditrice.it/firstfilipinoocrpdf.pdf |accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Luna's ''Spoliarium'' with its bloody carcasses  of slave gladiators being dragged away from the arena where they had entertained their Roman oppressors with their lives... stripped to satisfy the lewd contempt of their Roman persecutors with their honor...."{{sfn|Guerrero|1974|p=114}} Rizal was footnoted  in his speech that the ''Spoliarium'', "embodied the essence of our social, moral and political life: humanity in severe ordeal, humanity unredeemed, reason and idealism in open struggle with prejudice, fanaticism and injustice."{{sfn|Guerrero|1974|p=114}}

Rizal was inspired to carve a mark of his own to give glory to his country by writing his 'Spoliarium' since early that year 1884 "he had been toying with the idea of a book" for he has seen and described the painting as "the tumult of the crowd, the shouts of slaves, the metallic clatter of dead men's armor, the sobs of orphans, the murmured prayers...." Rizal's book would be called ''[[Noli me tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]]'', "the Latin echo of the Spoliarium".{{sfn|Guerrero|1974|p=119-120, 122}}

== In popular culture ==
[[Ryan Cayabyab]] composed the opera ''Spoliarium'', which chronicles the creation of the eponymous painting and Juan Luna's trial for the murder of his wife. Soprano Fides Cuyugan-Asensio wrote the [[libretto]]. A recorded version was released for commercial distribution in 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9697">{{1r|date=February 2016}}{{2p|date=February 2016}}'''The Steven Spielberg Jewish Film Archive''' is dedicated to the preservation and research of Jewish documentary films. The [[archive]] is jointly administered by the Abraham Harman Institute of Contemporary Jewry at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and the [[Central Zionist Archives]] of the [[World Zionist Organization]] (WZO).&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.jfa.huji.ac.il/ Archive website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The archive was established in the late 1960s by Professor Moshe Davis and other historians of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. The archive was originally called the Avraham Rad Jewish Film Archive for a number of years. In 1973, the WZO designated the archive as the official depository for its films. Since 1988, the archive has been named after the Jewish-American filmmaker [[Steven Spielberg]], whose foundation partially finances archive activities. In 1996, the archive moved to its present premises at the university's faculty of humanities on [[Mount Scopus]].

==The Collection==

The archive holds approximately 16,000 titles: about 4,500 films, over 9,000 videos on various formats and roughly 600 DVDs are cataloged. The collection deals with a variety of Jewish subjects: Jewish history, the establishment of the State of Israel, immigration, Jewish communities in the Diaspora and the relationships between them and Israelis. The films come from diverse sources: primarily the WZO and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem but also other public bodies, such as the [[Jewish National Fund]] and private sources that either donate or deposit their films – mainly documentary filmmakers and their families. In addition, the archive possesses a number of collections deposited by various kibbutzim. The Steven Spielberg Archive holds the copyright for the films produced by its founding institutions – i.e., the WZO and the Hebrew University – and is authorized to sell user rights to broadcasting and production companies and all other interested parties. The films are kept in temperature controlled vaults, facilitating their preservation, as much as possible, in optimal conditions. Movies can be watched on 16&amp;nbsp;mm and 35&amp;nbsp;mm viewing tables, and on video players in [[U-Matic]], [[Betacam]], [[VHS]], [[DVCAM]], [[Mini DV]], [[Super VHS]] and [[Betamax]].

==Films==

Viewers will receive a tangible and extensive picture of the development of the Jewish nation and the State of Israel during the 20th century until the present. The varied and rich collection contains several definitive moments in the history of the State and the Jewish people in the Diaspora: for example the "First Film of Palestine" depicts life during Ottoman rule in 1911; the film "Five Cities" in which five central Jewish communities were filmed in Poland, provides a concrete and chilling testament to the vibrant Jewish life existing there a few months before the Holocaust; the film "The Day Came" which describes the establishment of the State on 14 May 1948, includes the famous scene of the Declaration of Independence by [[David Ben-Gurion]]; there is also film of the [[Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations|Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations]], [[Chaim Herzog]], furiously tearing up the General Assembly resolution equating Zionism with racism.

Viewers can also see the establishment of different communities, both before and after the establishment of the State. [[Hadassah]] Organization presents the nascent medical profession in Israel. Films produced by the Hebrew University throughout the years, show not only the development of the University but also the changing face of Jerusalem. The film "Edge of the West" brings images of the Jews of Morocco, including poignant scenes of residents of an entire small Jewish village leaving on their way to Israel. In addition, influential Jewish figures, such as Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Chaim Weizmann]], among others, can be seen. The archive holds original copies of the [[Eichmann]] Trial, given by the American company that filmed the trial. The Israel State Archives granted the archive the right to distribute this material, after the original video reels were transferred to digital cassettes.

==Prominent projects==
* '''Preservation and restoration: ''' film reels and different video formats are held in optimal temperature and humidity controlled film vaults, thus facilitating their preservation. The films undergo periodic inspection to confirm that they have not been afflicted with any damaging chemical problems, such as [[vinegar syndrome]]. The archive has a number of damaged films, some of them unique copies, requiring restoration and reconstruction and from time to time – according to need and budget – they undergo restoration, thus saving the information contained in them for future generations.
* '''Digitization, accessibility and virtual cinema:''' to make films in the collection more accessible, the archive has acted as follows. Selected and important film reels have been digitized, transferred to DVD or uploaded to the Internet. During the last decade, the archive has developed its virtual cinema portal, containing about five hundred films for which it holds copyright. The films have been digitized and uploaded to an Internet site that operates currently as a channel on [[YouTube]]. Films can be viewed without charge. Basic information about the films is also given (year of production, duration of the film, general abstract and other technical details). The films are divided into a number of categories: Jewish communities, [[Holocaust]] and [[World War II]], Pre-state and various facets of life in the [[State of Israel]] (Art, Health, Birth and Security, Cities and Rural Settlement). Funds for the project were generously donated by the American Friends of the Hebrew University in honor of [[Jack Valenti]], former chairman of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]. Movies can be found relatively easily by searching the archive's online catalog: by title, producer or keywords. Films in the virtual cinema can be viewed directly from the catalog by clicking on the links.
* '''Film research – Matis Library: ''' The David Matis Collection contains press clippings, photographs and various documents on the production of Jewish and Israeli films over the years and of Jewish and Israeli filmmakers. It includes other print and photograph collections that have accumulated. Recently this collection was scanned and uploaded to the online, web-based database, Artlid.
* '''Production of showcase films''': The Spielberg Archive is obliged to produce films using material in its holdings.
* '''Witnesses from the Eichmann Trial''' presents a number of testimonies from the trial of the Nazi criminal;
* '''Jerusalem of Light''' was produced to mark the 40th anniversary of the re-unification of Jerusalem, contains segments from different motion pictures filmed during the 20th century and shows the development of Jerusalem from different angles;
* '''The White City''' produced in honor of [[Tel Aviv]]'s 90th anniversary, presents images from the first decades of its existence.

'''[[Edward Elgar]]'s Third Symphony''' [[Opus number|Op.]] 88 (posth.) was incomplete at the time of his death in 1934. Elgar left 130 pages of sketches which the British composer [[Anthony Payne]] worked on for many years, producing a complete symphony in 1997, officially known as "Edward Elgar: the sketches for Symphony No 3 elaborated by Anthony Payne" or in brief "Elgar/Payne Symphony No 3". The first public performance was at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] on 15 February 1998, by the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[Andrew Davis (conductor)|Andrew Davis]].&lt;ref name=Naxos&gt;notes to Naxos recording 8.554719&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After the death of his wife in 1920, Elgar retreated into semi-retirement, producing no large-scale works. His friend and champion [[George Bernard Shaw]] held that the [[BBC]] should commission a new Elgar symphony, and with the aid of [[Landon Ronald]] he persuaded the BBC to do so. Elgar worked on the new piece during the last year of his life, jotting down many short snatches of a few bars as well as some pages in full score.&lt;ref name=NMC&gt;notes to NMC recording D053&lt;/ref&gt;

Realising that he would not complete the score, the dying Elgar did not destroy the sketches, and made contradictory remarks about the unfinished work. He told his friend, the violinist [[William Henry Reed|W. H. "Billy" Reed]], "Don’t let anyone tinker with it", but to his doctor he said, "If I can’t complete the Third Symphony, somebody will complete it – or write a better one."&lt;ref name=NMC/&gt; Elgar and Reed had often played through various sketches for the symphony on violin and piano, and Reed knew more than anyone about Elgar's intentions. Reed reproduced more than forty pages of the most important sketches in his book ''Elgar as I Knew Him'' in 1936, probably to illustrate what he believed to be the impossibility of weaving them into a coherent whole.&lt;ref name=NMC&gt;notes to NMC recording D053&lt;/ref&gt; But their publication meant that seventy years later they would come into the [[public domain]] and the Elgar family would be powerless to prevent anyone "tinkering" with them.&lt;ref name=NMC/&gt;

In 1974, a [[BBC Radio 3]] producer, Dr Roger Fiske, devised a programme about the Symphony, and orchestrated some of the sketches, completed Elgar's unfinished scoring and composed some other passages. Elgar's daughter gave her approval and [[Adrian Boult|Sir Adrian Boult]] agreed to conduct the music. 
The score was sent for copying to Maurice Johnstone, a former BBC head of music. Johnstone felt strongly that the broadcast would amount to "tinkering" with the score and he successfully persuaded Boult to withdraw from the project on ethical grounds and the programme was subsequently dropped. A similar proposed feature for BBC television in 1979 also came to nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;March et al., p.481&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthony Payne]] had become interested in the sketches in 1972, and in 1993 the BBC invited him to work on them for a workshop performance. In the event the performance did not take place, because of objections from the Elgar family. Payne nevertheless continued to work on the sketches, completing the Scherzo, the Adagio and the first movement of the work. The Elgar family decided to commission Payne to make an authorised version.&lt;ref name=NMC/&gt;

Payne later wrote, "It was during this process that I became more consciously aware of the overall sweep of the symphony. It was different in its sheer breadth of emotion from any of his other symphonic works: there was the raw vigour and magic lyricism of the opening movement, the use of a lighter manner in the second which went far beyond his established symphonic practice, and the searing intensity of the Adagio, tragic in its import, while the finale revealed a world of chivalric action and drama." &lt;ref name=NMC/&gt;

His greatest difficulty was in completing the finale, as Elgar had left few clues about its structure and none about how it would end. Payne wrote the whole of the development section and the coda, deciding to end the work quietly, following the model of "The Wagon Passes" in Elgar’s late work the ''[[Nursery Suite]]''. "The finale's main subject actually suggests this kind of treatment, and it would lead the music away into some new visionary world, spanning the years between the composer's death and my attempted realisation of his sketches. I trusted my intuition and went ahead and wrote".&lt;ref name=NMC/&gt;

In the UK, performances were given in 1998 and 1999 in most of the major cities, including [[Glasgow]] (24 September), [[Birmingham]] (25 September), [[Bristol]] (10 October/27 January), [[Liverpool]] (24 October), [[Manchester]] (17 December) and [[Cambridge]] (29 January). International performances were programmed as far afield as [[Brussels]], [[Ljubljana]], [[St Petersburg]], Hong Kong and [[Winnipeg]]. The United States premiere took place on 20 November 1998 with the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] conducted by [[Andrew Davis (conductor)|Andrew Davis]], followed by performances by the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] with Davis and the [[National Symphony Orchestra (United States)|National Symphony Orchestra]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] with [[Leonard Slatkin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boosey.com/pages/cr/news/further_info.asp?NewsID=40&amp;LangID=  Boosey &amp; Hawkes website ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The symphony was described by the philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] as "a brilliant and heartfelt recuperation of musical ideas and one that has helped to revitalise our musical culture".&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The Symphony, in four movements, takes about 55 minutes in performance.

* [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Allegro]] [[molto]] [[maestoso]]
:The symphony opens in a sweeping sequence of parallel open fifths and octaves (the first seventeen bars of which Elgar left in full score) building to a march rhythm. By contrast the second subject is "sublimely wistful".&lt;ref name=Gramophone&gt;''[[The Gramophone]]'', March 1998&lt;/ref&gt; There is an exposition repeat indicated by Elgar, and a calm new theme for strings introduces the development section, which later has a lively theme for the horns. A march section in B flat minor follows. After the recapitulation, the coda brings together the main themes and the movement ends with a majestic C major conclusion based on the opening theme. The movement, taking about sixteen minutes in performance, though on a large scale, is shorter than the equivalent movements of Elgar's first and second symphonies.&lt;ref name=Gramophone&gt;''[[The Gramophone]]'', March 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LSO&gt;notes to LSO Live recording LSO00072&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Scherzo]]: [[allegretto]]
:The scherzo is in great contrast to those of the first two symphonies, both of which are fast and forceful. It is, however, the movement of which the sketches provided the clearest indications of Elgar's intentions, and the gentle wistfulness is in a recognisable ''[[Wand of Youth]]'' style. A light dance-tune with a prominent part for the tambourine recurs like a rondo. There are two contrasting episodes, the second of which features an A major theme in pastoral vein.&lt;ref name=Gramophone&gt;''[[The Gramophone]]'', March 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LSO/&gt;

* [[Tempo#Basic_tempo_markings|Adagio]] solenne
:Elgar wrote that the opening bars of the slow movement would "open some vast bronze doors into something strangely unfamiliar". The first main theme is elegiac, the D major second subject offering gentler contrast. The recapitulation emphasises the brooding first theme, and the movement ends with a single solo viola note, marked ''fine''; "this is the end", Elgar said of this phrase.&lt;ref name=Gramophone&gt;''[[The Gramophone]]'', March 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LSO/&gt;

* Allegro
:The opening of the finale returns to the heroic tone of the start of the symphony with a rousing fanfare (scored by Elgar). It is the movement of which the least original Elgar material exists, and Payne was obliged to contribute a quantity of original music. The martial opening theme has a subsidiary theme in Elgar's ''nobilmente'' vein. The climax of the movement is a large-scale crescendo-decrescendo modelled by Payne on "The Wagon Passes" in the ''[[Nursery Suite]]''. The hushed ending dies away in a long [[Dynamics (music)|pianissimo]] note from the [[tamtam|tam tam]].&lt;ref name=Gramophone/&gt;&lt;ref name=LSO/&gt;

==Recordings==
The first recording was made for the [[NMC Recordings|NMC]] label by the BBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by [[Andrew Davis (conductor)|Andrew Davis]], in October 1997, four months before the first public performance. Subsequent recordings have been made by:

* [[Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra]], [[Paul Daniel]] (2000, [[Naxos Records|Naxos]])
* [[London Symphony Orchestra]], [[Colin Davis|Sir Colin Davis]] (2001, LSO Live)
* [[BBC National Orchestra of Wales]], [[Richard Hickox]] (2007, [[Chandos Records|Chandos)]]

==Trivia==
* On 20 September 1996 a shorter version of ''Symphony No. 4 "Heroes"'' was used by [[Twyla Tharp]]'s troupe in a ballet entitled "Heroes".
** "As I have been involved with the world of dance for many years I naturally mentioned the "Heroes" Symphony to the American Choreographer Twyla Tharp. Straight away she wanted "Heroes" for her new dance company, and soon after, we met with David. He immediately shared Twyla's enthusiasm and I found myself writing a symphonic score shortly to become a ballet." – Philip Glass, 1996 (from the ''"Heroes" Symphony'' liner notes).
* In 2006 ''Symphony No. 4 "Heroes"'' was used as the soundtrack for [[Marc Jacobs]] Fall / Winter 2006 fashion show.
* In 2007 "V2 Schneider" was used in the soundtrack for the [[Lanvin (clothing)|Lanvin]] Fall / Winter 2007 fashion show. 
* Also in 2007 the [[Alexander McQueen (brand)|Alexander McQueen]] Fall / Winter 2007 Menswear fashion show used a [[Mashup (music)|mashup]] of David Bowie's original 1977 version of "Heroes" with Philip Glass' 1996 version of "Heroes".
* On 24 March 2003 [[Aphex Twin]] released the compilation album ''[[26 Mixes for Cash]]'', which contained a further [[remix]] of Philip Glass' orchestral version of David Bowie's "Heroes", from ''Symphony No. 4 "Heroes"'', mixed with samples of Bowie's singing from the original 1977 Bowie single [["Heroes" (David Bowie song)|"Heroes"]].

'''''The Hungry Lion Throws Itself on the Antelope''''' (''Le lion ayant faim se jette sur l'antilope'') is a large [[oil painting|oil-on-canvas]] painting created by [[Henri Rousseau]] in 1905.  Following ''Scouts Attacked by a Tiger'' the previous year, ''The Hungry Lion'' was the second jungle painting to mark Rousseau's return to this genre after a 10-year hiatus caused by the generally negative reception to his 1891 painting ''[[Tiger in a Tropical Storm]]''.
  
''The Hungry Lion'' features a jungle scene of thick green foliage lit by a deep red setting sun.  In the foreground, a lion bites deeply into the neck of an antelope.  Other animals are visible in the dense undergrowth: a panther watches from the right, an owl stares out of the background holding a bloody strand of meat in its beak in the centre, with a second bird to its left, and dark ape-like shape with gimlet eye lurks to the left.  Rousseau based the central pair of animals on a [[diorama]] of [[taxidermy|stuffed animals]] at the Paris [[Muséum national d'histoire naturelle]], entitled ''Senegal Lion Devouring an Antelope''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/rousseau/inspiration/ Henri Rousseau: Jungles in Paris] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506212032/http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/rousseau/inspiration/ |date=2009-05-06 }}, Tate Gallery, 3 November 2005 - 5 February 2006. Retrieved 2 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2005/nov/01/1 Stumble in the jungle], Adrian Searle, ''The Guardian'', 1 November 2005. Retrieved 2 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
Rousseau's first jungle painting, ''Tiger in a Tropical Storm'', was rejected by the [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]] for their official [[Paris Salon]], but he was able to show it at the 1891 [[Salon des Indépendants]].  Despite his increasing reputation, Rousseau continued to exhibit his works at the annual Salon des Indépendants, but ''The Hungry Lion'' was first shown at a third show, the [[Salon d'Automne]], in 1905, alongside works by [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]] and [[André Derain|Derain]].  Rousseau wrote a longer subtitle or caption to accompany his painting:
 
{|
|-
||"Le lion, ayant faim, se jette sur l'antilope, la dévore. La panthère attend avec anxiété le moment où, elle aussi, pourra en avoir sa part. Des oiseaux carnivores ont déchiqueté chacun un morceau de chair de dessus le pauvre animal versant un pleur! Soleil couchant."
||"The lion, being hungry, throws itself on the antelope, [and] devours it.  The panther anxiously awaits the moment when it too can claim its share.  Birds of prey have each torn a piece of flesh from the top of the poor animal which sheds a tear.  The sun sets."
|}
 
The magazine ''[[L'Illustration]]'' printed a copy of the work in its edition of 4 November 1905, with works by Matisse, Derain, [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]] and [[Édouard Vuillard|Vuillard]].
 
The [[avante garde]] works on display at the 1905 Salon d'Automne were decried by art critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] as, "[[Donatello]] chez les fauves" (Donatello among the wild beasts),&lt;ref name="Gil Blas, 17 October 1905"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7522165g/f5.image Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon d'Automne'', Gil Blas, 17 October 1905.

Despite their apparent simplicity, Rousseau's jungle paintings were built up meticulously in layers, using a large number of green shades to capture the lush exuberance of the jungle.  Rousseau's work continued to be derided by the critics up to and after his death in 1910, but he won a following among his contemporaries: [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]] were all admirers of his work.
 
''The Hungry Lion'' is now held by the [[Fondation Beyeler]] and is exhibited at their gallery at [[Riehen]], near [[Basel]], in [[Switzerland]]. Previously. in 1905, it had been exhibited in the [[Salon des Independants]], in [[Paris]].

'''''The Tragedy of Lucretia''''' is a [[tempera]] and oil painting on a wood ''[[cassone]]'' or ''spalliera'' panel by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] master [[Sandro Botticelli]], painted between 1496 and 1504. Known less formally as the '''Botticelli Lucretia''', it is housed in the [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]] of [[Boston]], Massachusetts, having been owned by [[Isabella Stewart Gardner]] in her lifetime.

[[File:Lucretia detail.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Right-hand scene. While her husband is away, the virtuous Lucretia is raped by Sextus Tarquinius, the king's son. After summoning her husband and others she reveals all and stabs herself. Here she has just done so and is dead.]]

==The picture of Lucretia's tragedy==
The picture is a syncretion of scenes from different legendary themes in different time periods that Botticelli considered related. The topic is revolt against tyranny, a popular one in the volatile Italian republics. The main scene is given center foreground. It is the beginning of the revolution that created the [[Roman republic]]. The legend is that [[Lucretia]], a noblewoman, was raped by the son of the last king of Rome, [[Sextus Tarquinius]]. As a result, [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] took an oath to expel the [[Tarquinii]] from Rome and never to allow anyone else to reign. In the centre of the picture Lucretia's corpse is on public display as a heroine. Brutus stands over her exhorting the populace to revolt and recruiting a revolutionary army of young men. There is much sword-waving. The dagger with which Lucretia killed herself is in evidence protruding from her breast. The statue at the top of the column behind Brutus in the foreground is [[David]] and [[Goliath]]'s head,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Recreating Ancient History: Episodes from the Greek and Roman Past in the Arts and Literature of the Early Modern Period |editor-first=K.

David and Goliath were a symbol of revolt against tyranny in the [[Republic of Florence]]. Lucretia had called for vengeance, but Brutus had called for the ouster of monarchy, and the purpose of the assembly was to implement it.

The legendary funeral oration takes place in the [[Forum Romanum]], but Botticelli makes no effort to represent that well-known place. The setting is a small town, which can be seen trailing into the countryside in the background; some speculate it may have been [[Collatia]], but that place was hardly the scene of a national revolution. None of the buildings are classical Roman and even the triumphal arch in the background commemorating the triumph of the republic is unlike any other. Hilliard T. Goldfarb, author of ''The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum: A Companion Guide and History'', instead suggests that it is a dramatic stage scene in which the players gesticulate theatrically, and also about Botticelli's intent to convey "a clear political message."&lt;ref name=goldfarb68-70&gt;{{cite book |title=The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum |first=Hilliard T. |last=Goldfarb |location=Boston, New Haven |publisher=Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Yale University Press |year=1995 |pages=68–70 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qpTugkmwWLQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q |isbn=0-300-06341-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; One does not. however, hire one of the greatest artists of the time to adorn the inside of a wedding chest or the back of a chair, even in a mansion, with clear political messages; presumably, the panel was meant for public display of some sort. Botticelli ten years later was to die in obscure and unappreciated poverty; nevertheless, he was recognized even then as a great master.

The scene on the right porch is the death of Lucretia. The frieze over the porch depicts [[Horatius Cocles]], a warrior who defended Rome against the intervention of [[Lars Porsenna]] and the ousted last king of Rome, [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]]. The scene on the left porch is the threatening of Lucretia by Sextus to extort her compliance. He rips away her cloak, offering to plunge his sword into her. The frieze over it depicts [[Judith]] and [[Holofernes]], a tyrant decapitated by her after offers of seduction in the Old Testament.

The use of architecture in this picture is parallel to that of [[Filippino Lippi]], a pupil of Sandro's, the son of Sandro's teacher.

[[File:Kolaczkrolewski.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''The Troelfth Cake''. French original. Black and white engraving]]
[[File:Kolacz krolewski painting.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''The Troelfth Cake'', German version, in color]]
'''''The Troelfth Cake''''' (also '''''The Twelfth Cake''''', '''''The Royal Cake''''', '''''The Cake of Kings''''', from the {{lang-fr|Le gâteau des rois}}, {{lang-pl|Kołacz królewski}}, ''Placek królewski'') is a 1773 [[France|French]] [[allegory]] and [[satire]] on the [[First Partition of Poland]].&lt;ref name="wom"/&gt; It is likely that the original title in English was intended to say "The Twelfth Cake", alluding to the division of a [[King Cake]] (also called a Twelfth Cake), but this became corrupted in later reprints.&lt;ref name=wom/&gt; There are at least four variants of the composition, which is most common as an [[engraving]], but also as at least one color [[painting]]; the original was likely drawn by [[Jean-Michel Moreau|Jean-Michel Moreau le Jeune]] and engraved by [[Nicolas Noël Le Mire]] (although another source calls them merely the authors of the most famous variant).&lt;ref name=wom/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gratet-Duplessisestampes1881"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kole/&gt; Authors of other variants included the German artist [[Johannes Esaias Nilson]].&lt;ref name="artinfo"/&gt;

''The Troelfth Cake'' shows the rulers of the three countries that participated in the partition tearing a map of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] apart. The outer figures demanding their share are [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II of Russia]] and [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II of Prussia]]. Catherine is glaring at her former lover, the Polish king [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]], and (in some variants  of the engraving) Frederick is pointing to [[Danzig]] (Gdańsk) with a sword (although Prussia acquired the territories around it, Gdańsk still remained with the Commonwealth). The inner figure on the right is the Habsburg Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]. On his left is the beleaguered [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]], who (in some variants of the engraving) is experiencing difficulty keeping his crown on his head, and in another, has already lost it. Above the scene is [[Pheme]] (with manifestos from the partitioning powers in the German variant).&lt;ref name=wom/&gt;

The composition gained notoriety in contemporary Europe;&lt;ref name="Kowecki1997"/&gt; its distribution was banned in several European countries, including France.&lt;ref name=artinfo/&gt;&lt;ref name=wprost/&gt; This ban, and associated penalties, meant that many variants of this work have been anonymous.&lt;ref name=artinfo/&gt;

The image was highly influential on numerous other satirical works of its time.&lt;ref name="kole"/&gt;

The changes between the French original and the German version, both portrayed here, were done to reduce the sexual content of the satire (the look between the lovers, the [[phallic]] sword).&lt;ref name=wom/&gt;
