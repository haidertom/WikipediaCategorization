'''Acceptance test–driven development''' ('''ATDD''') is a [[Software development|development]] methodology based on communication between the business customers, the developers, and the testers.&lt;ref name="Pugh11"&gt;{{cite book | first = Ken | last = Pugh |  year = 2011 | title = Lean-Agile Acceptance Test-Driven Development: Better Software Through Collaboration | publisher = Addison-Wesley | isbn = 978-0321714084}}&lt;/ref&gt; ATDD encompasses many of the same practices as [[specification by example]] (SBE),&lt;ref&gt;Adzic, Gojko. (2009) ''Bridging the Communication Gap: Specification by Example and Agile Acceptance Testing'', Neuri Limited,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adzic|first=Gojko|authorlink=Gojko Adzic|title=Specification by example: How successful teams deliver the right software|publisher=Manning|year=2011|isbn=978-0-321-27865-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[behavior-driven development]] (BDD),&lt;ref&gt;Chelimsky, David, Dave Astels, Zach Dennis, Aslak Hellesøy, Bryan Helmkamp, and Dan North. ''The RSpec Book: Behaviour Driven Development with RSpec, Cucumber, and Friends.'' The Pragmatic Bookshelf.&lt;/ref&gt; example-driven development (EDD),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.exampler.com/ | title = Example Driven Design| accessdate = 2013-04-15}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and support-driven development also called story test–driven development (SDD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://industriallogic.com/papers/storytest.pdf | title = Story Test-Driven Development | accessdate = 2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; All these processes aid developers and testers in understanding the customer's needs prior to implementation and allow customers to be able to converse in their own domain language.

ATDD is closely related to [[test-driven development]] (TDD).&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Kent. Test Driven Development: By Example. Addison-Wesley Professional, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  It differs by the emphasis on developer-tester-business customer collaboration.   ATDD encompasses [[acceptance testing]], but highlights writing acceptance tests before developers begin coding.

== Overview ==

Acceptance tests are from the user's point of view – the external view of the system.&lt;ref name="Pugh11" /&gt; They examine externally visible effects, such as specifying the correct output of a system given a particular input.  Acceptance tests can verify how the state of something changes, such as an order that goes from "paid" to "shipped".  They also can check the interactions with interfaces of other systems, such as shared databases or web services.  In general, they are implementation independent, although automation of them may not be.&lt;ref&gt;Melnik, Grigori, and Frank Maurer. {{cite web | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/34w2q2561k471175/ | title = Multiple Perspectives on Executable Acceptance Test-Driven Development | accessdate = 2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koskela, Lasse. (2007) Test Driven: TDD and Acceptance TDD for Java Developers. Manning Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Creation ===

Acceptance tests are created when the requirements are analyzed and prior to coding.&lt;ref name="Pugh11" /&gt;  They can be developed collaboratively by requirement requester (product owner, business analyst, customer representative, etc.), developer, and tester.  Developers implement the system using the acceptance tests.  Failing tests provide quick feedback that the requirements are not being met.  The tests are specified in business domain terms.  The terms then form a ubiquitous language that is shared between the customers, developers, and testers.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Eric. (2003) ''Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software''. Addison-Wesley Professional.&lt;/ref&gt; Tests and requirements are interrelated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weinberg|first=Gerald|last2=Gause|first2=Donald|authorlink=Gerald_Weinberg|title=Exploring Requirements: Quality Before Design|publisher=Dorset House|year=1989|isbn= 0-932633-13-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A requirement that lacks a test may not be implemented properly.  A test that does not refer to a requirement is an unneeded test.  An acceptance test that is developed after implementation begins represents a new requirement.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Robert C., and Grigori Melnik.{{cite web | url = http://www.gmelnik.com/papers/IEEE_Software_Moebius_GMelnik_RMartin.pdf | title = Tests and Requirements, Requirements and Tests: A Möbius Strip | accessdate = 2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Testing strategy ===

Acceptance tests are a part of an overall testing strategy. They are the customer tests that demonstrate the business intent of a system. Component tests are technical acceptance tests developed by an architect that specify the behavior of large modules.  Unit tests are created by the developer to drive easy-to-maintain code.&lt;ref&gt;[Test-driven_development]&lt;/ref&gt; They are often derived from acceptance tests and unit tests.  Cross-functional testing includes usability testing,&lt;ref&gt;Meszaros, Gerard, and Janice Aston. (2006) "Adding Usability Testing to an Agile Project."Agile Conference&lt;/ref&gt; exploratory testing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Exploratory Testing Explained | url = http://www.satisfice.com/articles/et-article.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; and property testing (scaling and security).&lt;ref&gt;Meszaros, Gerard.(2007) ''xUnit Test Patterns: Refactoring Test Code''. Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acceptance criteria and tests ==

Acceptance criteria are a description of what would be checked by a test. Given a requirement such as “As a user, I want to check out a book from the library”, an acceptance criterion might be “Verify the book is marked as checked out."  An acceptance test for this requirement gives the details so that the test can be run with the same effect each time.

=== Test format ===

Acceptance tests usually follow this form:&lt;ref name="Pugh11" /&gt;

'''Given (setup)'''

: A specified state of a system

'''When (trigger)'''

: An action or event occurs

'''Then (verification)'''

: The state of the system has changed or an output has been produced

Also, it is possible to add Statements that start with '''AND''' in any of the sections below (Given, When, Then).

For the example requirement, the steps could be listed as:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="cucumber"&gt;
Given Book that has not been checked out
And User who is registered on the system
When User checks out a book
Then Book is marked as checked out
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Complete test ===

The previous steps do not include any specific example data, so that is added to complete the test:

'''Given:'''

: Book that has not been checked out

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Books
|
|-
| Title || Checked out
|-
| Great book || No
|}

: User who is registered on the system

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Users
|-
| Name || Sam
|}

'''When:'''

: User checks out a book

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Checkout action
|-
| User || Sam || Checks out || Great book
|}

'''Then:'''

: Book is marked as checked out

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Books
|-
| Title || Checked out || User
|-
| Great book || Yes || Sam
|}

=== Test examination ===

Examination of the test with specific data usually leads to many questions. For the sample, these might be:

* What if the book is already checked out?
* What if the book does not exist?
* What if the user is not registered on the system?
* Is there a date that the book is due to be checked-in?
* How many books can a user check out?

These questions help illuminate missing or ambiguous requirements.  Additional details such as a due-date can be added to the expected result.  Other acceptance tests can check that conditions such as attempting to check out a book that is already checked out produces the expected error.

=== Another test example ===

Suppose the business customer wanted a business rule that a user could only check out one book at a time.  The following test would demonstrate that:

'''Scenario:'''
Check that checkout business rule is enforced

'''Given:'''

: Book that has been checked out

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Books
|-
| Title || Checked out || User
|-
| Great book || Yes || Sam
|-
| Another great book || No
|}

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Users
|-
| Name
|-
| Sam
|}

'''When:'''

: User checks out another book

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Checkout action
|-
| User || Sam || Checks out || Another great book
|}

'''Then:'''

: Error occurs

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Error occurred
|-
| Description
|-
| Violation of checkout business rule
|}

=== Project acceptance tests ===

In addition to acceptance tests for requirements, acceptance tests can be used on a project as a whole.&lt;ref name="Pugh11" /&gt; For example, if this requirement was part of a library book checkout project, there could be acceptance tests for the whole project. These are often termed [[SMART criteria|SMART objectives]]. An example test is "When the new library system is in production, the users will be able to check books in and out three times as fast as they do today".

'''Allan Ng Poh Meng''' was born in Singapore in 1941. He was the Deputy Chairman of [[United Overseas Bank]] ("UOB"), one of the three leading banks in Singapore, for five years after having served UOB for 18 years with total dedication and integrity.  He resigned as UOB's Deputy chairman in December 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Deputy Chairman To Leave United Overseas Bank / Singaporean bank to lose deputy chairman Ng | author = CHRIS SHERWELL | date = 30 July 1985 | publisher = [[Financial Times]] London | page = 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; to pursue other business interests.

In 1985, Allan Ng served as the Chairman of the [[Singapore Association of Banks]], a member of the Board of Trustees of the [[Institute of Southeast Asian Studies]], and a member of the Crime Prevention Council in Singapore.

Also in 1985, he was appointed a member of the Singapore Government Economic Committee, headed by the then Minister of Trade and Industry, Mr. Lee Hsien Loong, and was also Chairman of the Banking and Finance Sub-Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = A committee of businessmen and bankers has been set up by the Singapore government to oversee the next 10 years of economic development | date = 16 April 1985 | publisher = Textline Multiple Source Collection (1980–1994)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Allan Ng teamed up with Tan Sri [[Khoo Teck Puat]], a former banker and hotelier, to acquire a 29.9% interest in EXCO International, a UK financial services group, and a 13.5% interest in Standard Chartered Bank Plc ("StanChart").  He was appointed a director and Chairman of the Executive Committee of EXCO International and an alternate director of [[Standard Chartered Bank]].  This Standard Chartered stake was subsequently sold to Singapore's [[Temasek Holdings]] in 2004 following Tan Sri Khoo's death.

Also in 1986, he was Chairman of First City Holdings Group Limited ("First City"), a 50/50 joint venture between Allan Ng and Tan Sri Khoo, which acquired a 23% interest in Sealion Hotels Limited ("Sealion"), owner of the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Singapore.   First City's wholly owned subsidiary, First City Investment Pte Ltd ("FCI"), accepted an offer to acquire an additional 1 million shares in Sealion at 60 cents per share from Tsang &amp; Ong Stockbrokers when the shares of Sealion were still suspended.  This additional purchase of 1 million shares by FCI was publicly announced and disclosed to the [[Stock Exchange of Singapore]].

In 1988, Allan Ng was charged with [[insider trading]] for causing FCI on 8 October 1986 to purchase 1 million shares in Sealion, (later renamed as First Capital Corporation Limited) while having prior knowledge that Sealion had requested the [[Stock Exchange of Singapore]] to lift the suspension of trading of its shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Allan Ng Faces Trial For Insider Trading | author = ROGER MATTHEWS | date = 11 January 1988 | publisher = Financial Times London | page = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allan Ng pleaded guilty following a trial in 1989 that lasted 77 days and many days of cross-examination by [[Glenn Knight]], the Deputy Public Prosecutor, making it the longest trial in Singapore at that time.  In May 1989, Singapore abolished the right to appeal to the UK Privy Council except for criminal cases involving the death penalty or in civil cases where the parties had agreed to such a right of appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://countrystudies.us/singapore/43.htm | title = Major Governmental Bodies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 September 1989, he was convicted and sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment by the district court judge for violating the Securities Industry Act.  The imprisonment term was suspended pending appeal.

In 1991, he was successful in his appeal to the High Court, which set aside the sentence of imprisonment and instead imposed a fine of S$50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = High Court fines Allan Ng S$50,000 but quashes jail term | date = 6 February 1991 | publisher = Business Times Singapore | page = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court Judge, M. Karthigesu, accepted Allan Ng's counsel, Mr Michael Sherrard QC's submission that a custodial sentence was inappropriate, unnecessary and excessive because of the very unusual circumstances of this case.  Judge Karthigesu also accepted the submission that this case was "very unlike the more usual case of insider dealing where dishonest financial plunder was the object".  He highlighted that there was no evidence that Allan Ng or FCI were out to make a "killing" as there was "no attempt made by Allan Ng to sell the 1 million shares in the first week after the lifting of suspension when the price went up to about 77 cents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = In the High Court of The Republic of Singapore between Allan Ng Poh Meng (Apellant) and Public Prosecutor (Respondent) – Oral Judgment of M. Karthigesu J dated 5 February 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Allan Ng and his family emigrated to Vancouver, Canada following their successful application for permanent residence.  The Canadian Immigration and the Justice Ministry held that the conviction in Singapore did not render Allan Ng an "inadmissible person" under the Canadian Immigration Act and hence granted him and his family permanent residence status.

In early 1994, Mr. [[Robert Kuok]], Chairman of the [[Kerry Group]] (a conglomerate which owned the Shangri-La hotels, properties, media, and palm oil plantations, etc.) invited Allan Ng to join the Kerry Group.  He was appointed Chairman of Kerry Properties, a major public listed company in Hong Kong, and also Vice-Chairman of Kerry Holdings Limited.

In 1999, he left the Kerry Group to start his own investment firm, Newmark Capital Corporation Limited ("Newmark Capital").  Newmark Capital's investments included an 11% stake in CyberCity Holdings ("CyberCity"), which developed the Shenzhen CyberCity Business Park as well as a business park in Beijing (a joint venture with Tsinghua University) in 2000.  Newmark Capital was the second largest shareholder in CyberCity after Dr. Simon Jiang, founder and largest shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Allan Ng buys big CyberCity stake | author = Quak Hiang Whai | date = 7 April 2000 | publisher = Business Times Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other substantial shareholders in CyberCity included Singapore's Temasek Holdings, Ascendas Pte Ltd (a wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore's Jurong Town Corporation) and Fraser &amp; Neave Ltd ("F&amp;N").  Newmark Capital and Dr. Simon Jiang's stakes in CyberCity were subsequently acquired by Ascendas Pte Ltd, which together with F&amp;N, now control CyberCity through Fraser Property (China) Limited.

Currently, Allan Ng is the Chairman of Newmark Capital whose principal business activities include investments in real estate, private equity, hedge funds and stakes in pre-IPO companies and public-listed companies in Hong Kong and China.

'''Andris Ozols''' (born on January 30, 1968, in [[Riga]], [[Latvia]]) is the director of [[Investment and Development Agency of Latvia]] (LIAA), a [[Investment promotion agency|government agency]] responsible for promoting [[Foreign direct investment|investments]] and business development in [[Latvia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liaa.gov.lv/eng/home/about_us/about_us/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615003907/http://www.liaa.gov.lv/eng/home/about_us/about_us |archivedate=2012-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ozols was appointed director of LIAA in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.db.lv/citas-zinas/latvijas-investiciju-un-attistibas-agenturu-stures-andris-ozols-117526&lt;/ref&gt; He also currently serves as deputy chairman of the board of the [[Liepāja Special Economic Zone]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liepaja-sez.lv/lv/liepajas-osta/ostas-parvalde/&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozols has become notorious as director of LIAA, due to the owner of company [[Aerodium Latvia]] Ivars Beitāns, who publicly accused Ozols of extorting a bribe from Aerodium in order for LIAA to award the contract for preparing [[Expo 2010 pavilions#Latvia|Latvia pavillion]] in [[World Expo 2010]]. Ozols maintained a counterclaim that Aerodium instead wished to bribe Ozols in order for LIAA not to pursue in court a claim for misappropriation of EU funding in another company of Beitāns -- "Gaisa sporta sertifikācijas centrs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.diena.lv/raksts/pasaule/krievija/papildinata-aerodium-ozols-prasija-8-no-liguma-summas-liaa-vaditajs-kukuli-neprasiju-737061|title="Aerodium": Ozols prasīja 8% no līguma summas; LIAA vadītājs: kukuli neprasīju}}&lt;/ref&gt;. LIAA did afterwards sue "Gaisa sporta sertifikācijas centrs" for misappropriation of EU funds in Latvian courts, but lost the claim in all instances of the courts, the last instance declaring final verdict in October 17, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.la.lv/valsts-iestade-zaude-2-miljonu-eiro-prasiba-pret-veja-tunelu-razotajiem|title=Valsts iestāde zaudē 2 miljonu eiro prasībā pret vēja tuneļu ražotājiem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of his professional career, Ozols has served as a board member at [[Riga International Airport]] and Latvia's [http://www.csdd.lv/ Road Traffic Safety Directorate].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apollo.lv/zinas/lidostas-padomes-priekssedetajs-bus-liaa-direktors-ozols/348328&lt;/ref&gt; From 1993-1997 he lived in Germany, where he worked in the transport and logistics industry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ebaltics.com/forum2008/Speakers/Ozols.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  

Ozols studied physics and mathematics at the [[University of Latvia]] and holds a degree in business management from the [[School of Business Administration Turība]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.delfi.lv/news/national/politics/latvijas-investiciju-un-attistibas-agenturu-vadis-andris-ozols.d?id=9638562&lt;/ref&gt; He is fluent in Latvian, English, Russian, and German.

Ozols is married to [[Dana Reizniece-Ozola]], a deputy in the Latvian [[Saeima]] (Parliament)&lt;ref&gt;http://titania.saeima.lv/personal/deputati/saeima11_depweb_public.nsf/depArchive.html?ReadForm&amp;unid=4680B802244E3FB8C22579100046C58B&amp;url=./0/4680B802244E3FB8C22579100046C58B?OpenDocument&amp;lang=EN&lt;/ref&gt; and champion chess player who holds the title of [[Woman Grandmaster]].&lt;ref&gt;http://chess-results.com/tnr57855.aspx?art=9&amp;lan=1&amp;turdet=YES&amp;flag=30&amp;snr=75&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1782">'''Ansaldi''' was an Italian automobile manufacturer founded in Milan in 1904 by [[Michele Ansaldi]] an engineer, designer, and industrialist. The only car they produced was sold as the [[Fiat Brevetti|F.I.A.T. Brevetti]] after the company was taken over in 1905.

In 1904 the Ansaldi automobile company in Milan manufactured a small car with a [[Fiat]] 10/12 HP engine. It featured the world's first 'pre-formed' chassis, plus a [[drive shaft]] and [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential unit]] with bevelled gears and [[universal joint]]s.

In 1905 Fiat bought Ansaldi and launched the car as the Fiat-Ansaldi 10-12 HP. In 1906 it was renamed the Fiat Societa-Brevetti, and 1,600 were produced by 1912 with the Fiat Brevetti 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finecars.cc/en/detail/car/195897/index.html Anamera, Profile of 1907 Fiat Brevetti Landualet]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Finecars"&gt;[http://www.finecars.cc/en/detail/car/195897/index.html 1907 Fiat Brevetti Landualet]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Auvergne Mary Doherty''', M.A., B.A. (3 October 1896 – 3 January 1961) was an Australian businesswoman, working in her family's cattle business. She was one of the first nine women called to the Bar in England; Doherty was the first Western Australian woman called to the English Bar; she did not go on to practise law in England or Western Australia. Instead, Doherty took over her father's business when he died in 1935.

==Life==
Auvergne Doherty was born in Perth, Western Australia, the second daughter of Denis and Georgina Doherty.  Auvergne was raised abroad, attending Convent schools in Belgium and England, one of which included the Convent of Holy Child Jesus in Cavendish Square, London.  In 1916, Auvergne passed the Responsions exams for Oxford University; she graduated and matriculated on 30 October 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford University Archives; Obituary for Miss Auvergne Doherty, ''The Times'' (London, England), Thursday 19 January 1961, p. 17, Issue 54983&lt;/ref&gt; Auvergne was among the first of nine women called to the Bar in England in 1922, following the enactment of the [[Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919]]; she was the first Western Australian called to the English Bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://womenandthelegalprofession.wordpress.com/2015/08/19/the-first-women-cohort/|title=The First Women Cohort Called to the Bar, 1922|date=19 August 2015|website=''Wordpress.com''|access-date=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.middletemple.org.uk/Shared%20Documents/MTAR/MTAR%20-1910-1944.pdf Middle Temple Archives, Register of Admissions]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite gaining admission to [[Middle Temple]], Auvergne did not go on to practise law.

Before returning to Western Australia in 1930, with her father [[Denis Doherty]] and sister, Dorothy, Auvergne held a secretarial role at the [[British Drama League]].  When her father died in 1935, Auvergne took over his cattle business with Mr Michael Durack, in the Northern Territory.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Durack, Sons in the Saddle (Bantam, New Edition, 1985, p.426)&lt;/ref&gt; Four years before the company was wound up in 1950, Auvergne resigned as the company director.  Auvergne died on 3 January 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Western Australia Death Certificate: Auvergne Doherty; ''The Times'' (London, England), Thursday 19 January 1961, p. 17, Issue 54983&lt;/ref&gt;  She is buried at [[Karrakatta Cemetery]], Western Australia, in the Roman Catholic portion next to her father.&lt;ref&gt;Western Australia Death Certificate: Auvergne Doherty&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

Auvergne Doherty was educated abroad at Convent schools in Belgium and London, attending the Convent of Holy Child Jesus, 11 Cavendish Square, London.  After the Convent of H.C.J., Auvergne attended [[Oxford University]] (1916–1919). On 30 October 1920, Auvergne returned to Oxford to matriculate and graduate;&lt;ref&gt; _____, "Oxford–Saturday. Degrees for Women". Yorkshire Post, 1 November 1920. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; from Michaelmas term 1920, women who had previously passed examinations, which would have qualified a man for a degree, were able to return to matriculate and graduate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/about/oxford-people/women-at-oxford|title=Women at Oxford|publisher=University of Oxford|access-date=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of MA was awarded on 28 June 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford University Archives&lt;/ref&gt;

==Call to the Bar==

Auvergne Doherty applied for admission to [[Middle Temple]] on 5 January 1920.  Just over two years later, she was 'screened' for Call on 24 October 1922 and formally called to the Bar on 17 November 1922.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.middletemple.org.uk/Shared%20Documents/MTAR/MTAR%20-1910-1944.pdf Middle Temple Archives; Middle Temple Archives, Register of Admissions]&lt;/ref&gt;

Auvergne Doherty was among the first cohort of women called to the Bar, along with Theodora Llewellyn-Davis, [[Helena Normanton]], Monica Geikie Cobb, Ethel Bright Ashford, Elsie Wheeler, Beatrice Davy, [[Sybil Campbell]] and Dr [[Ivy Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://womenandthelegalprofession.wordpress.com/2015/08/19/the-first-women-cohort/|title=The First Women Cohort Called to the Bar, 1922|date=19 August 2015|website=''Wordpress.com''|access-date=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ivy Williams]] was the first woman to be called to the Bar in 1922. [[Helena Normanton]] was the first woman law student and first woman barrister to practice in 1922. [[Carrie Morrison]] became the first women solicitor.

Auvergne Doherty was the first woman from Western Australia to be called to the English Bar. Doherty was not the first Australian woman to enter the legal profession; this title went to [[Flos Greig]], who was admitted in August 1905. The next Western Australian woman called to the Bar was Alice Mary Cummins, in 1930. It was not until 1975 that the first woman, Valerie French, signed the Bar Roll and practised as a barrister in Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womenaustralia.info/leaders/biogs/WLE0624b.htm|title=Law – Theme – The Encyclopedia of Women and Leadership in Twentieth-Century Australia|first=The University of|last=Melbourne|website=WomenAustralia.info|access-date=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Western Australia, when one signs on to only practice as a Barrister, you sign the Bar Roll. That means that women did practice before this date but not specifically as barristers.

Auvergne Doherty did not pursue a career in law. Instead, it is noted that she became a secretary for the [[British Drama League]] before returning to Perth in 1930 when she took over her father's business.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary for Miss Auvergne Doherty, ''The Times'' (London, England), Thursday 19 January 1961&lt;/ref&gt;

On Auvergne's gravestone BLL, 1922 is written.  Her call and admission were widely reported in British and Australian newspapers at the time but she is not considered Perth's first woman lawyer. The omission of Doherty as one of the 'firsts' could be because she did not practise law either in England or Western Australia and her story is not well-known.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, G. (1994) 'Just Dears: Western Australia’s First Women Lawyers’ in Brief,  Volume 21 No. 4 pages 13–17; Byrne, G. (1994) ‘Just Dears: Western Australia’s First Women Lawyers’ in Brief, Volume 21 No. 4 pages 13–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States National Academy of Sciences' Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy''' (STEP) is a board of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]].

The mandate of the Board is to integrate understanding of scientific, technological, and economic elements in the formulation of national policies affecting the economic well-being of the United States. The program’s focus is on the dynamics of the macroeconomic and microeconomic variables, their relationship to the industrial structure of the economy, effect on high-technology manufacturing and service sectors, and influence on U.S. scientific and technological advancement through examination of trade, human resources, fiscal, research and development, intellectual property and other policies. Policymakers responsible for these areas in the executive branch and Congress are the audience for the STEP Board’s work in the form of consensus reports, conferences, and workshops. The current Executive Director is Stephen A. Merrill, Ph.D. and the Board Chair is Paul Joskow, president of the Sloan Foundation.

== History and evolution ==

===Establishment===
The Academies began to address issues of U.S. competitiveness and innovation in the late 1970s and early 1980s through a series of industry studies by the NAE and broad policy studies by the [[Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy]] (COSEPUP).

A leading NAS economist, [[Dale Jorgenson]], and NAE industrialists [[Ralph Landau]] and [[George Hatsopoulos]] were concerned that this work, and national innovation policy more broadly, did not sufficiently reflect the contributions economics could make to understanding of trends and policy prescriptions to improve outcomes. They proposed to the National Research Council (NRC) Governing Board of Directors of the NAS to create a new standing committee as a forum for dialogue among economists, technologists, and industrial managers to those ends. The Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy (STEP) was established in 1991, originally as an independent board with funding from the NRC and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. Subsequently, it was combined with COSEPUP and Government-University-Industry Research Roundtable (GUIRR) in the Policy Division, at which time the Academy and Institute presidents were made ex-officio members to make the three units more similar in structure.

===Composition===
In composing the first slate of members, the Academies added a fourth category of expertise and experience – finance and investment – and took care to ensure that among the members were people with high-level public policy experience. Over the past 16 years the membership has included leading industrialists (Rube Mettler, Don Peterson, Bill Spencer), three Nobel Laureates (Mike Spence, Joe Stiglitz, and Jim Heckman) among many leading microeconomists, prominent venture capitalists (Burton McMurtry, Kathy Behrens, and [[David Morgenthaler]]), scientists and engineers from the Academies (George Whitesides and Vint Cerf), former policymakers (James Lynn, Mary Good, and Alan Wolff), and people whose careers have bridged the corporate and nonprofit sectors (Edward Penhoet) or industry and elective politics (Amo Houghton, Jr.). In STEP’s first decade the majority of industrialists represented heavy manufacturing and information technology. In recent years there has been an effort to recruit more senior managers from life science-based industries and services.

===Policy environment and focus===
Not coincidentally, concern about Japanese competition and fear of a progressive decline in the U.S. manufacturing base was peaking at the time STEP was created. Indeed, the perception that Japan enjoyed a broad and enduring competitive advantage from a substantially lower cost of capital was a motivating factor in establishing the Board and became the subject of its first conference and report. In the late 1990s, of course, pessimism gave way to extreme confidence in the economy, lasting until the [[dot-com collapse]]. The contemporary policy environment is again one of concern if not alarm about U.S. economic performance, although vis-à-vis different sources of competition.

In this fluctuating environment, STEP’s focus has not shifted away from the U.S. position in the global economy. Investing for Productivity and Prosperity was followed by a series of projects examining development of international technical standards and testing certification, technology policy as a source of trade friction among the industrialized countries, tax policy affecting the location of foreign direct investment and R&amp;D performance, evaluation of U.S. and foreign government interventions in support of commercial technology development, and the effects of foreign government conditions on aerospace sales and investment. A major focus since the late 1990s has been on the reasons for the improved competitiveness of many U.S. industries and the resurgence in productivity growth, the extent to which these are accurately measured and reflected in the national economic accounts, and how they can be sustained.

Nevertheless, the STEP portfolio has become more diversified, with projects on the economics of [[K-12 education]] reform, impact of technology on jobs and wages, supply of IT workers, quality of innovation-related statistics, functioning of the patent system, impact of intellectual property on research, shifts in the federal research portfolio by field, financing of entrepreneurship, prizes as a tool of innovation policy, and aeronautics R&amp;D at [[NASA]]. This diversification has been a key to STEP’s success and endurance, but the board is mindful that global competition and its effects on Americans’ employment and welfare remain the principal driver of its agenda. When, as now, public and political concern is ascendant, other institutions and others in the Academy are quickly drawn into this policy arena to compete for many of the same sources of financial support. Within the past 3 or 4 years alone nominally similar programs have been launched at the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], [[Brookings Institution]], [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]], [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], and [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] and spun off from the [[Progressive Policy Institute]].

Since nearly all of STEP’s work is [[microeconomic]], other ways to parse STEP’s portfolio are by industrial sector and by microeconomic policy. On the first dimension, STEP has focused intensively on semiconductors, software, computing (and its component technologies), and biotechnology and given considerable attention also to aviation, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, telecommunications, metal fabrication, and finance. At the same time, STEP has done significant although by no means exhaustive work on the following microeconomic policies – tax, trade, standards, K-12 and graduate education, workforce training, intellectual property, economic statistics, and, of course, direct and indirect research and development support.

Areas that have received little attention to date are agriculture, energy and power, and environmental regulation. Although these are the domains of other standing NRC units that, of course, does not preclude STEP from undertaking projects in those areas tailored to its strengths nor does it preclude collaborations. Discussions have in fact occurred with each of those units (BANR, BEES, and BEST) and led to formal collaborative proposals, but unfortunately those proposals have not attracted sponsors.

== Accomplishments ==

===Dialogue===
Encouraging cross-disciplinary, cross-sector dialogue on issues of competitiveness and innovation was a major theme of the NRC discussions leading to the creation of STEP. The Board itself has sustained this dialogue across many changes in membership notably including the departure recently of the last original member, Dale Jorgenson. Meetings are well attended and members frequently remark on the high caliber of discussion and learning across disciplines and sectors.

STEP has extended this form of dialogue to the many ad hoc committees under its oversight. Normally, STEP study committees include 2 or 3 STEP members – a testament to the fact that many (perhaps most) projects are conceived in board discussions and members become committed to helping carry them through to fruition. In addition, an effort is made to ensure that study committee rosters recommended to the Division Chair and the President include a mix of expertise and experience similar to that on the board itself – industrial technologists, economists, financial executives, academic scientists, and former policymakers

STEP has also contributed to dialogue within the NRC. Staff are frequently asked to suggest committee members and other resources for studies in other units. Formal collaborations have involved the Science, Technology, and Law Committee, Committee on National Statistics, Computer Science and Telecommunications Board, Board on Higher Education and the Workforce, Board on Testing and Assessment, National Cancer Policy Board, and Board on Health Care Services (of the National Academies).

===Contributions to research===
STEP has benefited from and exploited the microeconomic field of technology and productivity analysis that is the fairly recent legacy of Griliches, Jorgenson, Solow, Mansfield, and others as well as the work of international trade economists. But the fact is that in many of the specific policy areas of STEP work – intellectual property, standards, program evaluation, etc. – there is a serious deficit of empirical research. Rather than rely on anecdote and judgment, the Board has when possible taken the step – unusual for the Academy – of supporting small-scale original research projects, often surveys. This was done in studies of the patent system, Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, Advanced Technology Program (ATP), and biomedical researchers’ experience with intellectual property. In all of these cases, the research results strongly influenced study committees’ findings and recommendations. That, in turn, has encouraged more research. In the case of the patent study, the Board in 2002 issued an RFP, received 80-odd proposals, and selected 9 projects for full or co-funding. This undoubtedly contributed to the subsequent flowering of empirical research on intellectual property systems and policies.

More typical of the Academy, STEP work has helped shape the agendas of investigators and research sponsors. A prime example is the 2001 workshop, Using Human Resource Data to Track Innovation, whose premise was that studying the qualifications, career paths, and activities of industrial scientists, engineers, and other professionals could reveal a great deal about innovation processes, especially those beyond the R&amp;D stage. The workshop has shaped the subsequent work of Paula Stephan, who was commissioned to write the principal paper for the meeting, and led directly to a series of NSF workshops, other research initiatives, and efforts to improve the utility of data from the NSF surveys of PhD-holders. A community of investigators is exploring ways to match publication and patent data with NSF human resource data. Stephan attributes all of this activity directly to the seminal STEP workshop.

== Domestic policy impact ==
STEP reports have had a demonstrable impact on public policy discussions and outcomes. Examples include:

''A Patent System for the 21st Century'' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Richard C. and Mark B. Myers. (2004). A Patent System for the 21st Century. Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2004 a STEP committee chaired by Yale President Richard Levin and former Xerox CTO Mark Myers issued a final report of a broad study of how well the U.S. patent system is fulfilling its purpose of encouraging research, innovation, and the dissemination of knowledge and how it is adapting to rapid technological and economic changes. It found that while the system has shown admirable flexibility in accommodating new technologies, there is reason to be concerned about the quality of issued patents, the resources available to the US Patent and Trademark Office to keep up with the pace of technological change and volume of applications, features of U.S. law that inhibit the dissemination of information contained in patents and that raise the cost and uncertainty of litigation over patent validity and infringement, access to patented research technologies for basic non-commercial research, and redundancies and inconsistencies among national patent systems that raise the cost of global intellectual property protection.&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. and Mark B. Myers. (2004). A Patent System for the 21st Century. Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press&lt;/ref&gt; With dedicated dissemination funds provided by the NRC, a private foundation, and several companies and law firms, a very extensive outreach effort, involving public meetings across the country, was undertaken. The committee co-chairs were lead-off witnesses in Senate and House patent reform hearings in the spring of 2005 and again in 2007. Five of the report’s seven recommendations are core provisions of legislation introduced by the committee chairs in the 109th Congress and expected to be re-introduced in the 110th.

* ''Trends in Federal Support of Research and Graduate Education'' (2001). Using data collected by NSF annually from federal agencies but rarely analyzed, this report documented in detail significant shifts in the allocation of public research spending and graduate student support in the 1990s and related these to state, foundation, and industry funding patterns. It found a substantial real decline in federal investment in most of the physical sciences and engineering fields and corresponding declines in the number of federally supported graduate students in those fields.&lt;ref&gt;The National Research Council of The National Academies. Committee on Trends in Federal Spending on Scientific and Engineering Research. (2001). Trends in Federal Support of Research and Graduate Education. Washington, D. C. The National Academies Press&lt;/ref&gt; The report was cited by the Senate Appropriations Committee, OSTP Director Jack Marburger, then NSF Director Rita Colwell, and the Semiconductor Industry Association. It contributed to the recommendations of the President’s committee of Advisers on Science and Technology (PCAST), Council on Competitiveness, and COSEPUP Augustine panel, the President’s 2007 budget, and bipartisan congressional majorities for significant increases in the federal funding of physical science and engineering research.
* ''The Advanced Technology Program: Assessing Outcomes'' (2001). This report represented a comprehensive review of the operations of the Advanced Technology Program (ATP), administered by the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to accelerate development of high-risk technologies with promising economic benefits through cost-shared funding. The study committee concluded that the program has shown considerable success attributable in part to appropriate selection criteria, rigorous peer review of technical feasibility and commercial potential, and careful evaluation of outcomes. The report was the subject of a hearing before the House Science Committee and was cited by the Senate Appropriations Committee in justifying an increase in ATP’s funding. STEP’s evaluation is undoubtedly a factor in ATP’s survival despite repeated administration proposals and House of Representative votes to terminate the program. NIST recently issued a solicitation for new ATP proposals.

===International reputation===
In part through the Board’s outreach efforts and in part because of interest abroad in the contributions of federal and state government policy to U.S. economic performance, there is a growing international audience for STEP’s work, evidenced by the high volume of visits to the website and invitations for presentations to international organizations (e.g., various committees of the OECD, parts of the European Commission, World Intellectual Property Organization, and European Patent Office), and national government officials and international academic gatherings too numerous to list. Originally confined to the industrial countries this interest has extended to the governments of and academics in the emerging economies – China, India, Brazil, Vietnam, and the former Soviet republics.

STEP has received project support from the [[OECD]], [[European Commission]], [[Industry Canada]], and Embassy of the United Kingdom. A formal collaboration with two of the German economic research institutes yielded two reports, and in 1995 STEP was asked to host an international conference on technology and jobs preparatory to the G-7 Summit meeting.

Congress is a principal consumer of STEP work, and the Board has conducted or is conducting three congressionally mandated projects. A fourth mandate – the ongoing evaluation of 5 agencies’ SBIR programs – followed STEP work on SBIR but has been carried out under separate oversight. Discussion is underway with members of Congress of a major study of the role of intangible assets (R&amp;D, intellectual property, software, worker training, and organizational competence) in economic growth. Nevertheless, what will appear in final legislation or bill report language is always highly uncertain; and agency compliance with congressional study mandates is not assured. STEP has twice negotiated language with congressional sponsors for studies that were eventually included in enacted legislation and developed proposals to the executive agencies directed to contract with the Academies, but the mandates were not executed.

== History&lt;ref&gt;"From Neresine to Milan. Memories of the Italian Entrepreneur Fulvio Bracco" edited by Bracco Foundation, year 2012&lt;/ref&gt;==
The company founded by Elio Bracco was established in 1927 in Milan with the name Società Italiana Prodotti E Merck, to produce, package and sell the chemical products of the German company [[Merck Group#History|E. Merck]]. It had just five employees.
In 1934 Fulvio Bracco, Elio’s son, officially joined the company which, the same year, began marketing Cebion, an innovative product based on vitamin C, recently discovered by Hungarian professor Szent-Györgyi. In 1962 Bracco researchers created the first contrast agent based on their original [[research]]: iodamide, a product with very high tolerability.
On 17 March 1977 Diana Bracco, Fulvio’s daughter, was appointed Bracco General Manager.

In 1981 the company launched Iopamidol in Italy and Germany, a product with outstanding tolerability, whose stability allowed it to be stored in phials for unlimited periods of time. In the second half of the 1980s, Bracco Spa became the leading international producer of non-ionic contrast agents. It also won a positive response and important results for other formulations, including the anti-tuberculosis drug pyrazinamide, of which Bracco is the leading world producer, which is included in the WHO list of essential [[pharmaceuticals]].

In 1990, Bracco began a ten-year period of important growth. At international level, acquisitions and [[joint ventures]] enhanced the Group structure. In 1990 the Bracco Eisai [[joint venture]] was set up in Japan. In 1994 Bracco acquired Squibb Diagnostic, a company in the Bristol Myers Squibb group in the United States, which is still Bracco Imaging’s largest market today.
1995 saw the integration of the three research centres in [[Milan]], [[Geneva]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]]: [[Milan]] focuses on the [[research]] and development of contrast agents for [[radiology]] and [[magnetic resonance imaging|magnetic resonance]], Bracco Research Geneva on ultrasound and Bracco Research USA Princeton on magnetic resonance and [[nuclear medicine]].

1999 was a milestone year for the company: the Bracco family and the [[Merck Group]] reached an agreement under which Bracco bought Merck’s 50% stake in the Group’s diagnostic and pharmaceuticals operations.
In 2001, the Bracco Group acquired ACIST Medical Systems, a US company based in [[Eden Prairie, MN|Eden Prairie, Minnesota]], a suburb of [[Minneapolis]], active in advanced contrast-agent management and injection systems.
Meanwhile, the Group’s international growth continued, with more offices opening around the world. Since 2002 Bracco has had a direct presence in China with Bracco Sine Pharmaceutical Corp. Ltd. in Shanghai. In 2008 it acquired E-Z-EM, a leading company in the [[radiology]] sector. In 2010 Bracco entered [[Estonia]], [[Scandinavia]] and [[South Korea]]. In 2011 Bracco Imaging acquired Swiss Medical Care (now Bracco Injeneering) and the Nycomed production plants in Singen (Germany). In 2012 it completed the acquisitions of Justesa in [[Argentina]], Mexico and [[Brazil]].

Huntingdon Life Sciences has been the target [[Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty]] since 1999, a campaign run by British and American animal-rights activists, who seek to close the company down for its treatment of, and experimentation upon, live animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shac.net Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty website], accessed 23 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign has included acts of intimidation and violence, including against Cass, who sustained head injuries when he was attacked outside his home on 22 February 2001 by three people armed with pickaxe handles and CS gas. A neighbour who tried to help him was sprayed with the gas. Detective Chief Inspector Tom Hobbs of Cambridgeshire police told reporters:"It's only by sheer luck that we are not beginning a murder inquiry."&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.envirolink.org/pipermail/ar-news/Week-of-Mon-20031013/008215.html "The Animals Of Hatred"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629082805/http://lists.envirolink.org/pipermail/ar-news/Week-of-Mon-20031013/008215.html |date=2006-06-29 }}; accessed 23 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; David Blenkinsop, who had previously engaged in actions using the name of the [[Animal Liberation Front]], was jailed for three years for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1494924.stm "Jail for lab boss attacker"], BBC News; accessed 23 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PICT0111.JPG|thumb|[[direct current|DC]] [[plasma physics|plasma]] (violet) enhances the growth of carbon nanotubes in laboratory-scale PECVD apparatus]]

'''Chemical vapor deposition''' ('''CVD''') is a deposition method used to produce high quality, high-performance, solid materials, typically under [[Vacuum deposition|vacuum]]. The process is often used in the [[semiconductor industry]] to produce [[thin film]]s.

In typical CVD, the [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]] (substrate) is exposed to one or more [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] [[wikt:precursor|precursors]], which [[chemical reaction|react]] and/or [[chemical decomposition|decompose]] on the substrate surface to produce the desired deposit. Frequently, volatile [[by-product]]s are also produced, which are removed by gas flow through the reaction chamber.

[[Microfabrication]] processes widely use CVD to deposit materials in various forms, including: [[Single crystal|monocrystalline]], [[polycrystalline]], [[amorphous]], and [[Epitaxy|epitaxial]]. These materials include: [[silicon]] ([[Silicon dioxide|dioxide]], [[silicon carbide|carbide]], [[silicon nitride|nitride]], [[silicon oxynitride|oxynitride]]), carbon ([[carbon (fiber)|fiber]], [[carbon nanofibers|nanofibers]], [[carbon nanotube|nanotubes]], [[Synthetic diamond|diamond]] and [[graphene]]), [[fluorocarbon]]s, [[Electrical filament|filaments]], [[tungsten]], [[titanium nitride]] and various [[high-k dielectric]]s.

== Types ==
[[File:ThermalCVD.PNG|thumb|Hot-wall thermal CVD (batch operation type)]]
[[File:PlasmaCVD.PNG|thumb|Plasma assisted CVD]]

CVD is practiced in a variety of formats. These processes generally differ in the means by which chemical reactions are initiated.
* Classified by operating conditions:
** ''Atmospheric pressure CVD'' (APCVD) – CVD at atmospheric pressure.
** ''Low-pressure CVD'' (LPCVD) – CVD at sub-atmospheric pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crystec.com/klllpcvde.htm|title=Low Pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition – Technology and Equipment|publisher=Crystec Technology Trading GmbH}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduced pressures tend to reduce unwanted gas-phase reactions and improve film uniformity across the wafer.
** ''Ultrahigh vacuum CVD'' (UHVCVD) – CVD at very low pressure, typically below 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] (~10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; [[torr]]). Note that in other fields, a lower division between high and [[ultra-high vacuum]] is common, often 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; Pa.

Most modern CVD is either LPCVD or UHVCVD.
* Classified by physical characteristics of vapor:
** ''Aerosol assisted CVD'' (AACVD) – CVD in which the precursors are transported to the substrate by means of a liquid/gas aerosol, which can be generated ultrasonically. This technique is suitable for use with non-volatile precursors.
** ''Direct liquid injection CVD'' (DLICVD) – CVD in which the precursors are in liquid form (liquid or solid dissolved in a convenient solvent). Liquid solutions are injected in a vaporization chamber towards injectors (typically car injectors). The precursor vapors are then transported to the substrate as in classical CVD. This technique is suitable for use on liquid or solid precursors. High growth rates can be reached using this technique.
* Classified by type of substrate heating:
** Hot wall CVD – CVD in which the chamber is heated by an external power source and the substrate is heated by radiation from the heated chamber walls.
** Cold wall CVD – CVD in which only the substrate is directly heated either by induction or by passing current through the substrate itself or a heater in contact with the substrate. The chamber walls are at room temperature.
* Plasma methods (see also [[Plasma processing]]):
** ''Microwave plasma-assisted CVD'' (MPCVD)
** ''[[Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition|Plasma-Enhanced CVD]]'' (PECVD) – CVD that utilizes [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] to enhance chemical reaction rates of the precursors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.crystec.com/tridepe.htm|title=Crystec Technology Trading GmbH, Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition – Technology and Equipment}}&lt;/ref&gt; PECVD processing allows deposition at lower temperatures, which is often critical in the manufacture of semiconductors. The lower temperatures also allow for the deposition of organic coatings, such as plasma polymers, that have been used for nanoparticle surface functionalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tavares|first=Jason|author2=Swanson, E.J. |author3=Coulombe, S. |title=Plasma Synthesis of Coated Metal Nanoparticles with Surface Properties Tailored for Dispersion|journal=Plasma Processes and Polymers|year=2008|volume=5|issue=8|page=759|doi=10.1002/ppap.200800074}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** ''Remote plasma-enhanced CVD'' (RPECVD) – Similar to PECVD except that the wafer substrate is not directly in the plasma discharge region. Removing the wafer from the plasma region allows processing temperatures down to room temperature.
* ''Atomic-layer CVD'' ([[ALCVD]]) – Deposits successive layers of different substances to produce layered, [[crystal]]line films. See [[Atomic layer epitaxy]].
* ''[[Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition]]'' (CCVD) – Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition or flame pyrolysis is an open-atmosphere, flame-based technique for depositing high-quality thin films and nanomaterials.
* ''Hot filament CVD'' (HFCVD) – also known as catalytic CVD (Cat-CVD) or more commonly, initiated CVD (iCVD), this process uses a hot filament to chemically decompose the source gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first=R.E.I. | last=Schropp |author2=B. Stannowski |author3=A.M. Brockhoff |author4=P.A.T.T. van Veenendaal |author5=J.K.

* ''[[Hybrid Physical-Chemical Vapor Deposition]]'' (HPCVD) – This process involves both chemical decomposition of precursor gas and [[vaporization]] of a solid source.
* ''[[Metalorganic chemical vapor deposition]]'' (MOCVD) – This CVD process is based on [[metalorganic]] precursors.
* ''Rapid thermal CVD'' (RTCVD) – This CVD process uses heating lamps or other methods to rapidly heat the wafer substrate. Heating only the substrate rather than the gas or chamber walls helps reduce unwanted gas-phase reactions that can lead to [[particle (ecology)|particle]] formation.
* ''Vapor-phase epitaxy'' (VPE)
* ''Photo-initiated CVD'' (PICVD) – This process uses UV light to stimulate chemical reactions. It is similar to plasma processing, given that plasmas are strong emitters of UV radiation. Under certain conditions, PICVD can be operated at or near atmospheric pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dorval Dion|first=C.A.|author2=Tavares, J.R.|title=Photo-Initiated Chemical Vapour Deposition as a Scalable Particle Functionalization Technology (A Practical Review)|journal=Powder Technology|volume=239|pages=484–491|year=2013|doi=10.1016/j.powtec.2013.02.024|url=https://zenodo.org/record/968600}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Laser Chemical vapor deposition]] (LCVD)'' - This CVD process uses lasers to heat spots or lines on a substrate in semiconductor applications. In MEMS and in fiber production the lasers are used rapidly to break down the precursor gas-process temperature can exceed 2000oC-to build up a solid structure in much the same way as laser sintering based 3-D printers build up solids from powders.

== Uses ==
CVD is commonly used to deposit conformal films and augment substrate surfaces in ways  that more traditional surface modification techniques are not capable of. CVD is extremely useful in the process of [[atomic layer deposition]] at depositing extremely thin layers of material. A variety of applications for such films exist.  [[Gallium arsenide]] is used in some [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs) and  photovoltaic devices. Amorphous polysilicon is used in photovoltaic devices.  Certain [[carbide]]s and [[nitride]]s confer wear-resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Wahl, Georg ''et al.'' (2000) "Thin Films" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a26_681}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polymerization by CVD, perhaps the most versatile of all applications, allows for super-thin coatings which possess some very desirable qualities, such as lubricity, hydrophobicity and weather-resistance to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gleason|first=Karen|author2=Ayse Asatekin |author3=Miles C.

==Commercially important materials prepared by CVD==

=== Polysilicon ===
[[Polycrystalline silicon]] is deposited from [[trichlorosilane]] (SiHCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or [[silane]] (SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), using the following reactions:&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{ Ullmann | author = Simmler, W. | title = Silicon Compounds, Inorganic | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a24_001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:SiHCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Si + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  HCl
:SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → Si + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

This reaction is usually performed in LPCVD systems, with either pure silane feedstock, or a solution of silane with 70–80% [[nitrogen]]. Temperatures between 600 and 650&amp;nbsp;°C and pressures between 25 and 150 Pa yield a growth rate between 10 and 20 [[nanometre|nm]] per minute. An alternative process uses a [[hydrogen]]-based solution. The hydrogen reduces the growth rate, but the temperature is raised to 850 or even 1050&amp;nbsp;°C to compensate. Polysilicon may be grown directly with doping, if gases such as [[phosphine]], [[arsine]] or [[diborane]] are added to the CVD chamber. Diborane increases the growth rate, but arsine and phosphine decrease it.

=== Silicon dioxide ===
Silicon dioxide (usually called simply "oxide" in the semiconductor industry) may be deposited by several different processes. Common source gases include [[silane]] and [[oxygen]], [[dichlorosilane]] (SiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[nitrous oxide]]&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Third World Congress of Chemical Engineering, Tokyo, p. 290 (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), or [[tetraethylorthosilicate]] (TEOS; Si(OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The reactions are as follows:&lt;ref name="cao:2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cao|first1=Guozhong|last2=Wang|first2=Ying|title=Nanostructures and Nanomaterials -- Synthesis, Properties and Applications|date=2011|publisher=World Scientific Publishing|isbn=978-981-4322-50-8|page=248|doi=10.1142/7885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:SiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 HCl

:Si(OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + byproducts

The choice of source gas depends on the thermal stability of the substrate; for instance, [[aluminium]] is sensitive to high temperature. Silane deposits between 300 and 500&amp;nbsp;°C, dichlorosilane at around 900&amp;nbsp;°C, and TEOS between 650 and 750&amp;nbsp;°C, resulting in a layer of ''low- temperature oxide'' (LTO). However, silane produces a lower-quality oxide than the other methods (lower [[dielectric strength]], for instance), and it deposits non[[conformal film|conformally]]. Any of these reactions may be used in LPCVD, but the silane reaction is also done in APCVD. CVD oxide invariably has lower quality than [[thermal oxidation|thermal oxide]], but thermal oxidation can only be used in the earliest stages of IC manufacturing.

Oxide may also be grown with impurities ([[alloy]]ing or "[[doping (semiconductor)|doping]]"). This may have two purposes. During further process steps that occur at high temperature, the impurities may [[atomic diffusion|diffuse]] from the oxide into adjacent layers (most notably silicon) and dope them. Oxides containing 5–15% impurities by mass are often used for this purpose. In addition, silicon dioxide alloyed with [[phosphorus pentoxide]] ("P-glass") can be used to smooth out uneven surfaces. P-glass softens and reflows at temperatures above 1000&amp;nbsp;°C. This process requires a phosphorus concentration of at least 6%, but concentrations above 8% can corrode aluminium. Phosphorus is deposited from phosphine gas and oxygen:

:4 PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

[[Glass]]es containing both boron and phosphorus (borophosphosilicate glass, BPSG) undergo viscous flow at lower temperatures; around 850&amp;nbsp;°C is achievable with glasses containing around 5 weight % of both constituents, but stability in air can be difficult to achieve. Phosphorus oxide in high concentrations interacts with ambient moisture to produce phosphoric acid. Crystals of BPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can also precipitate from the flowing glass on cooling; these crystals are not readily etched in the standard reactive plasmas used to pattern oxides, and will result in circuit defects in integrated circuit manufacturing.

Besides these intentional impurities, CVD oxide may contain byproducts of the deposition. TEOS produces a relatively pure oxide, whereas silane introduces hydrogen impurities, and dichlorosilane introduces [[chlorine]].

Lower temperature deposition of silicon dioxide and doped glasses from TEOS using ozone rather than oxygen has also been explored (350 to 500&amp;nbsp;°C). Ozone glasses have excellent conformality but tend to be hygroscopic – that is, they absorb water from the air due to the incorporation of silanol (Si-OH) in the glass. Infrared spectroscopy and mechanical strain as a function of temperature are valuable diagnostic tools for diagnosing such problems.

==== Silicon nitride ====
Silicon nitride is often used as an insulator and chemical barrier in manufacturing ICs. The following two reactions deposit silicon nitride from the gas phase:

:3 SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 12 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:3 SiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 HCl + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Silicon nitride deposited by LPCVD contains up to 8% hydrogen. It also experiences strong tensile [[stress (physics)|stress]], which may crack films thicker than 200&amp;nbsp;nm. However, it has higher [[resistivity]] and dielectric strength than most insulators commonly available in microfabrication (10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; [[ohm|Ω]]·cm and 10 M[[volt|V]]/cm, respectively).

Another two reactions may be used in plasma to deposit SiNH:

:2 SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 SiNH + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → SiNH + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

These films have much less tensile stress, but worse electrical properties (resistivity 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; Ω·cm, and dielectric strength 1 to 5 MV/cm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page = 384| title = Semiconductor devices: physics and technology|author = Sze, S.M. | publisher = Wiley-India| year = 2008|isbn =978-81-265-1681-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metals ===
CVD for [[tungsten]] is achieved from [[tungsten hexafluoride]] (WF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), which may be deposited in two ways:

:WF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; → W + 3 F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:WF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → W + 6 HF

Other metals, notably aluminium and [[copper]], can be deposited by CVD. {{As of|2010}}, commercially cost-effective CVD for copper did not exist, although volatile sources exist, such as Cu([[hexafluoroacetylacetone|hfac]])&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Copper is typically deposited by [[electroplating]]. Aluminum can be deposited from [[triisobutylaluminium]] (TIBAL) and related [[organoaluminium compound]]s.

CVD for [[molybdenum]], [[tantalum]], [[titanium]], nickel is widely used.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} These metals can form useful [[silicide]]s when deposited onto silicon. Mo, Ta and Ti are deposited by LPCVD, from their pentachlorides. Nickel, molybdenum, and tungsten can be deposited at low temperatures from their carbonyl precursors. In general, for an arbitrary metal ''M'', the chloride deposition reaction is as follows:

:2 MCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 M + 10 HCl

whereas the carbonyl decomposition reaction can happen spontaneously under thermal treatment or acoustic cavitation and is as follows:

:M(CO)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; → M + n CO

the decomposition of metal carbonyls is often violently precipitated by moisture or air, where oxygen reacts with the metal precursor to form metal or metal oxide along with carbon dioxide.

[[Niobium(V) oxide]] layers can be produced by the thermal decomposition of [[niobium(V) ethoxide]] with the loss of [[diethyl ether]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi =  10.1149/1.2059247 | title =  Electrochromic Properties of Niobium Oxide Thin Films Prepared by Chemical Vapor Deposition | year =  1994 | last1 =  Maruyama | first1 =  Toshiro | journal =  Journal of the Electrochemical Society | volume =  141 | issue =  10 | pages =  2868}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | title = Atomic Layer Deposition of High Permittivity Oxides: Film Growth and In Situ Studies |  author = Rahtu, Antti | publisher = University of Helsinki | url = http://hdl.handle.net/10138/21065 | year = 2002 | isbn = 952-10-0646-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the equation:

:2 Nb(OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; → Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;

=== Graphene ===
Many variations of CVD can be utilized to synthesize graphene. Although many advancements have been made, the processes listed below are not commercially viable yet.
* Carbon source
The most popular carbon source used to produce graphene is methane gas. Less popular choices include petroleum asphalt, notable for being inexpensive but more difficult to work with.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Synthesis of three-dimensional graphene from petroleum asphalt by chemical vapor deposition|journal = Materials Letters|date = 2014-05-01|pages = 285–288|volume = 122|doi = 10.1016/j.matlet.2014.02.077|first = Zhuchen|last = Liu|first2 = Zhiqiang|last2 = Tu|first3 = Yongfeng|last3 = Li|first4 = Fan|last4 = Yang|first5 = Shuang|last5 = Han|first6 = Wang|last6 = Yang|first7 = Liqiang|last7 = Zhang|first8 = Gang|last8 = Wang|first9 = Chunming|last9 = Xu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use of catalyst
The use of catalyst is viable in changing the physical process of graphene production. Notable examples include iron nanoparticles, nickel foam, and gallium vapor. These catalysts can either be used in situ during graphene buildup,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Novel synthesis route to graphene using iron nanoparticles|journal = Journal of Materials Research|date = 2014|pages = 1522–1527|volume = 29|issue = 14|doi = 10.1557/jmr.2014.165|first = Rajen B.|last = Patel|first2 = Chi|last2 = Yu|first3 = Tsengming|last3 = Chou|first4 = Zafar|last4 = Iqbal|bibcode = 2014JMatR..29.1522P}}&lt;/ref&gt; or situated at some distance away at the deposition area.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Direct synthesis of large area graphene on insulating substrate by gallium vapor-assisted chemical vapor deposition|journal = Applied Physics Letters|date = 2015|pages = 093112|volume = 106|issue = 9|doi = 10.1063/1.4914114|first = Katsuhisa|last = Murakami|first2 = Shunsuke|last2 = Tanaka|first3 = Ayaka|last3 = Hirukawa|first4 = Takaki|last4 = Hiyama|first5 = Tomoya|last5 = Kuwajima|first6 = Emi|last6 = Kano|first7 = Masaki|last7 = Takeguchi|first8 = Jun-ichi|last8 = Fujita|bibcode = 2015ApPhL.106i3112M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some catalysts require another step to remove them from the sample material.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The direct growth of high-quality, large single-crystalline domains of graphene on a dielectric substrate is of vital importance for applications in electronics and optoelectronics. Combining the advantages of both catalytic CVD and the ultra-flat dielectric substrate, gaseous catalyst-assisted CVD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Silane-catalysed fast growth of large single-crystalline graphene on hexagonal boron nitride |journal=Nature Communications  |volume=6  |year=2015|page=6499|doi=10.1038/ncomms7499 |pmid=25757864  |pmc=4382696  |last1=Tang |first1=Shujie |last2=Wang |first2=Haomin|last3=Wang |first3=Huishan |arxiv=1503.02806|bibcode=2015NatCo...6E6499T}}&lt;/ref&gt; paves the way for synthesizing high-quality graphene for device applications while avoiding the transfer process.
* Physical conditions
Physical conditions such as surrounding pressure, temperature, carrier gas, and chamber material play a big role in production of graphene.

Most systems use LPCVD with pressures ranging from 1 to 1500 Pa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = CVD synthesis of nitrogen-doped graphene using urea|journal = Science China Physics, Mechanics &amp; Astronomy|date = 2015-09-05|pages = 1–6|volume = 58|issue = 10|doi = 10.1007/s11433-015-5717-0|first = CanKun|last = Zhang|first2 = WeiYi|last2 = Lin|first3 = ZhiJuan|last3 = Zhao|first4 = PingPing|last4 = Zhuang|first5 = LinJie|last5 = Zhan|first6 = YingHui|last6 = Zhou|first7 = WeiWei|last7 = Cai|bibcode = 2015SCPMA..58.7801Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Synthesis of CVD-graphene on rapidly heated copper foils|url = http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=c3nr06434d|journal = Nanoscale|volume = 6|issue = 9|pages = 4728–34|doi = 10.1039/c3nr06434d|pmid = 24658264|first = Sang-Min|last = Kim|first2 = Jae-Hyun|last2 = Kim|first3 = Kwang-Seop|last3 = Kim|first4 = Yun|last4 = Hwangbo|first5 = Jong-Hyuk|last5 = Yoon|first6 = Eun-Kyu|last6 = Lee|first7 = Jaechul|last7 = Ryu|first8 = Hak-Joo|last8 = Lee|first9 = Seungmin|last9 = Cho|bibcode = 2014Nanos...6.4728K|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some still use APCVD.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Low pressures are used more commonly as they help prevent unwanted reactions and produce more uniform thickness of deposition on the substrate.

On the other hand, temperatures used range from 800–1050&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; High temperatures translate to an increase of the rate of reaction. Caution has to be exercised as high temperatures do pose higher danger levels in addition to greater energy costs.
* Carrier gas
Hydrogen gas and inert gases such as argon are flowed into the system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These gases act as a carrier, enhancing surface reaction and improving reaction rate, thereby increasing deposition of graphene onto the substrate.
* Chamber material
Standard quartz tubing and chambers are used in CVD of graphene.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Quartz is chosen because it has a very high melting point and is chemically inert. In other words, quartz does not interfere with any physical or chemical reactions regardless of the conditions.
* Methods of analysis of results
Raman spectroscopy, X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are used to examine and characterize the graphene samples.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Raman spectroscopy is used to characterize and identify the graphene particles; X-ray spectroscopy is used to characterize chemical states; TEM is used to provide fine details regarding the internal composition of graphene; SEM is used to examine the surface and topography.

Sometimes, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used to measure local properties such as friction and magnetism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Cold wall CVD technique can be used to study the underlying surface science involved in graphene nucleation and growth as it allows unprecedented control of process parameters like gas flow rates, temperature and pressure as demonstrated in a recent study. The study was carried out in a home-built vertical cold wall system utilizing resistive heating by passing direct current through the substrate. It provided conclusive insight into a typical surface-mediated nucleation and growth mechanism involved in two-dimensional materials grown using catalytic CVD under conditions sought out in the semiconductor industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Das|first1=Shantanu|last2=Drucker|first2=Jeff|title=Nucleation and growth of single layer graphene on electrodeposited Cu by cold wall chemical vapor deposition|journal=Nanotechnology|volume=28|issue=10|pages=105601|doi=10.1088/1361-6528/aa593b|pmid=28084218|bibcode=2017Nanot..28j5601D|year=2017|url=https://zenodo.org/record/895408/files/article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Das|first1=Shantanu|last2=Drucker|first2=Jeff|title=Pre-coalescence scaling of graphene island sizes|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|date=28 May 2018|volume=123|issue=20|pages=205306|doi=10.1063/1.5021341|bibcode=2018JAP...123t5306D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphene nanoribbon===
In spite of graphene's exciting electronic and thermal properties, it is unsuitable as a transistor for future digital devices, due to the absence of a bandgap between the conduction and valence bands. This makes it impossible to switch between on and off states with respect to electron flow. Scaling things down, graphene nanoribbons of less than 10 nm in width do exhibit electronic bandgaps and are therefore potential candidates for digital devices. Precise control over their dimensions, and hence electronic properties, however, represents a challenging goal, and the ribbons typically possess rough edges that are detrimental to their performance.

=== Diamond ===

{{See also|Synthetic diamond#Chemical vapor deposition}}
CVD can be used to produce a [[synthetic diamond]] by creating the circumstances necessary for carbon atoms in a gas to settle on a substrate in crystalline form. CVD of diamonds has received much attention in the materials sciences because it allows many new applications that had previously been considered too expensive. CVD diamond growth typically occurs under low pressure (1–27 [[pascal (unit)|kPa]]; 0.145–3.926 [[pounds per square inch|psi]]; 7.5–203 [[Torr]])  and involves feeding varying amounts of gases into a chamber, energizing them and providing conditions for diamond growth on the substrate. The gases always include a carbon source, and typically include hydrogen as well, though the amounts used vary greatly depending on the type of diamond being grown. Energy sources include [[hot filament]], [[microwave]] power, and [[Electric arc|arc discharges]], among others. The energy source is intended to generate a plasma in which the gases are broken down and more complex chemistries occur. The actual chemical process for diamond growth is still under study and is complicated by the very wide variety of diamond growth processes used.

Using CVD, films of diamond can be grown over large areas of substrate with control over the properties of the diamond produced. In the past, when high pressure high temperature (HPHT) techniques were used to produce a diamond, the result was typically very small free standing diamonds of varying sizes. With CVD diamond growth areas of greater than fifteen centimeters (six inches) diameter have been achieved and much larger areas are likely to be successfully coated with diamond in the future. Improving this process is key to enabling several important applications.

The growth of diamond directly on a substrate allows the addition of many of diamond's important qualities to other materials. Since diamond has the highest [[thermal conductivity]] of any bulk material, layering diamond onto high heat producing electronics (such as optics and transistors) allows the diamond to be used as a heat sink.&lt;ref name="poly1"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0925-9635(94)90108-2|title=Diamond protective coatings for optical components|year=1994|last1=Costello|first1=M|last2=Tossell|first2=D|last3=Reece|first3=D|last4=Brierley|first4=C|last5=Savage|first5=J|journal=Diamond and Related Materials|volume=3|issue=8|pages=1137–1141|bibcode = 1994DRM.....3.1137C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heat2"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.diamond.2005.05.008|title=Comparative study of thermally conductive fillers in underfill for the electronic components|year=2005|last1=Sun Lee|first1=Woong|last2=Yu|first2=Jin|journal=Diamond and Related Materials|volume=14|issue=10|pages=1647–1653|bibcode = 2005DRM....14.1647S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond films are being grown on valve rings, cutting tools, and other objects that benefit from diamond's hardness and exceedingly low wear rate. In each case the diamond growth must be carefully done to achieve the necessary adhesion onto the substrate.  Diamond's very high scratch resistance and thermal conductivity, combined with a lower [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] than [[Pyrex]] glass, a [[coefficient of friction]] close to that of Teflon ([[polytetrafluoroethylene]]) and strong [[lipophilicity]] would make it a nearly ideal non-stick coating for cookware if large substrate areas could be coated economically.

CVD growth allows one to control the properties of the diamond produced. In the area of diamond growth, the word "diamond" is used as a description of any material primarily made up of [[Orbital hybridisation#sp3|sp3-bonded]] carbon, and there are many different types of diamond included in this. By regulating the processing parameters—especially the gases introduced, but also including the pressure the system is operated under, the temperature of the diamond, and the method of generating plasma—many different materials that can be considered diamond can be made. Single crystal diamond can be made containing various [[dopant]]s.&lt;ref name="single"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.diamond.2003.10.017|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223368741|title=Single crystal diamond for electronic applications|year=2004|last1=Isberg|first1=J|journal=Diamond and Related Materials|volume=13|issue=2|pages=320–324|bibcode = 2004DRM....13..320I }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Synthetic diamond#Crystallinity|Polycrystalline diamond]] consisting of grain sizes from several [[nanometer]]s to several [[micrometre|micrometers]] can be grown.&lt;ref name="poly1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="poly2"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0925-9635(01)00385-5|title=Ultrananocrystalline diamond thin films for MEMS and moving mechanical assembly devices|year=2001|last1=Krauss|first1=A|journal=Diamond and Related Materials|volume=10|issue=11|pages=1952–1961|bibcode = 2001DRM....10.1952K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some polycrystalline diamond grains are surrounded by thin, non-diamond carbon, while others are not. These different factors affect the diamond's hardness, smoothness, conductivity, optical properties and more.

==Chalcogenides==
Commercially, [[mercury cadmium telluride]] is of continuing interest for detection of infrared radiation.  Consisting of an [[alloy]] of CdTe and HgTe, this material can be prepared from the dimethyl derivatives of the respective elements.

A '''chief visionary officer''' ('''CVO''') is an executive function in a [[company (law)|company]] like [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] or [[Chief operating officer|COO]]. The title is sometimes used to formalize a high-level advisory position and other times used to define a higher ranking position than that held by the CEO. In some cases, the CVO is added to the CEO title (for CEO/CVO status), much in the same way that people with multiple university degrees list them after their names. 

The CVO is expected to have a broad and comprehensive knowledge of all matters related to the business of the organization, as well as the vision required to steer its course into the future. The person in charge must have the core-competencies of every executive, and the visionary ideas to move the company forward, defining corporate strategies and working plans. The role has expanded to include formalizing the company’s strategic-planning processes, forging new working relationships and synergies across the organization, and establishing greater transparency and accountability for those people carrying out the company’s strategy.

Companies add CVOs (or consider doing so), sometimes interchangeable with CSO - Chief Strategy Officer, to their management teams for several reasons. Changes to the business landscape — complex organizational structures, rapid globalization, new regulations, the struggle to innovate — make it more difficult for CEOs to be on top of everything, even in areas as important as strategy execution and vision direction. Strategy development has become a continuous process, and successful execution depends on rapid and effective decision making. Further, as Harvard Business School professor Joseph L. Bower has noted, iron-fisted control of execution often eludes the top team’s grasp, as line executives seek to define strategy on their own terms. (See Bower and Clark G. Gilbert’s “How Managers’ Everyday Decisions Create—or Destroy—Your Company’s Strategy,” February 2007.)

Einar Stefferud, co-founder and CVO of First Virtual Holdings in 1994, is usually recognized as the first CVO. Another early CVO was Tim Roberts of [[Broadband Investment Group]]. Roberts said{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} he invented the title to recognize the visionary attributes needed to integrate a complex business with many diverse aspects. Roberts chose the title to define his role in the organization, and didn't intend the designation to proliferate across the corporate world in the way that it has.

'''ContractorUK''' is a news and community website for [[independent contractors]] in the UK. It has been online since 1999, since the early days of [[IR35]] and the initial inflation of the [[dot-com bubble]].

== Overview ==
The website claims that it is home to the UK's IT contracting community, with over 420,000 visits per month. It provides independent editorial on contracting as well as calculators, market rates, and contract jobs.

== Tax and legislation issues ==
ContractorUK reports on a wide range of issues that face contractors. This includes changes made by [[HM Revenue and Customs|HMRC]] as well as the introduction of new and changes to existing tax legislation. 
It has covered the most pressing issues in the contracting industry such as [[IR35]], EBTs and [[BN66]]. It has also reported on the [[United Kingdom budget|Budget]], [[Autumn Statement]] and the Finance Bill, and how they will affect contractors. This includes the new legislation which will restrict tax relief for [[travel and subsistence]] for workers engaged through an employment intermediary, such as an umbrella company or a personal service company.
ContractorUK has covered news on the Personal Service Companies Committee,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.uk/personal-service-companies&lt;/ref&gt; including a speech made by [[Baroness Noakes]] in the [[House of Lords]] in which she referenced ContractorUK.

== Campaigns ==
The ContractorUK Forum provides space in the forums, for the No To Retro Tax (NTRT)&lt;ref&gt;http://notoretrotax.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; campaign group, who aim to overturn the retrospective tax legislation introduced in Section 58 of the UK [[Finance Act 2008]].

== Forum ==
The site has a [[internet forum|forum]], with over 2 million posts, to discuss matters related to contracting (including umbrella companies, recruitment agencies, contracts, tax etc.), as well as areas for general chat. Here contractors are able to receive unbiased advice from other contractors.

'''Creative consultant''' is a credit that has - particularly in the past - been given to [[screenwriters]] who have [[script doctor|consulted]] on a movie [[screenplay]]. Those given this credit in the television field work closely with an [[executive producer]] and [[head writer]]/[[showrunner]]. They are involved in the writing process (proposing and editing story outlines/scripts). Sometimes they are given the credit of ''executive consultant'', ''story consultant'' or ''script consultant''.

"Creative consultant" is not listed by the [[Writers Guild of America]] as one of its [[WGA screenwriting credit system|standard credits]] to be given to writers in television and film. The WGA discourages the use of credits not included on their list and requires that a waiver be obtained in order to credit someone as a creative consultant in television or film.&lt;ref name='tcpg'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wga.org/uploadedFiles/writers_resources/credits/tcpg10.pdf | title = Television Credits and Procedures Guide | accessdate = 19 June 2013 | author = Writers Guild of America, West | authorlink = Writers Guild of America, West | date = 2010 | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Mankiewicz]]'s credit as Creative Consultant for the 1978 film ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' appeared after the writers' credits, leading to a dispute which Mankiewicz ultimately won. In 1993, the [[Film producer|producers]] of ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]'' were fined by the WGA for giving writer [[Steve Oedekerk]] a creative consultant credit.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2455">'''Direct therapeutic exposure''' ('''DTE''') is a [[behavior therapy]] technique pioneered by Patrick A. Boudewyns, where [[stressor]]s are vividly and safely confronted to help combat [[veteran]]s, and patients suffering from [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), [[panic disorder]], or [[phobia]]s. [[Exposure therapy]] has supporting evidence with both simple and complex traumas.&lt;ref&gt;Baschnagel, J.S., Coffey, S.F., and  Rash, C.J. (2006).  The Treatment of Co-Occurring PTSD and Substance Use Disorders Using Trauma-Focused Exposure Therapy. IJBCT 2(4), 498-508. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; A similar therapy is [[Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing]] (EMDR).  First known publication in book form is ''Flooding and Implosive Therapy: Direct Therapeutic Exposure in Clinical Practice'' by Patrick A. Boudewyns, Robert H. Shipley.  1983. {{ISBN|0-306-41155-5}}.

It is not uncommon to combine DTE treatment with other therapies.

==Use==

Direct exposure has been used with a variety of populations including agoraphobia&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Porter, Carole Porcari, Ellen I. Koc, Courtney Fons and C.

'''Electronic services delivery''' or '''ESD''' refers to providing government services through the [[Internet]] or other electronic means. It is related to [[e-services]] and [[e-government]].

==Defining e-service==
E-service (or eservice) is a highly generic term usually referring to ‘The provision of services via the Internet (the prefix 'e' standing for ‘electronic’, as it does in many other usages), thus e-Service may also include e-Commerce, although it may also include non-commercial services (online), which is usually provided by the government.’ (Alexei Pavlichev &amp; G. David Garson, 2004: 169-170; Muhammad Rais &amp; Nazariah, 2003: 59, 70-71).

‘An umbrella term for services available on the Internet, e-Service include e-Commerce transaction services for handling online orders, application hosting by application service providers (ASPs) and any processing capability that is obtainable on the Web.’ (Computer Desktop Encyclopedia, 2009)

E-Service or 'electronic service' constitutes the online services available on the Internet, whereby a valid transaction of buying and selling (procurement) is possible, as opposed to the traditional websites, whereby only descriptive information are available, and no online transaction is made possible.' (Jeong, 2007).

{{Finance sidebar}}

[[File:City of London skyline from London City Hall - Sept 2015 - Crop Aligned.jpg|thumb|The [[City of London]] (the "Square Mile") is one of the oldest financial centres.  London is ranked as one of the largest International Financial Centres ("IFC") in the world.]]

A '''financial centre''' is a broad term the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] define as encompassing:{{efn|name="imf"|The IMF definition, and examples, from June 2000.&lt;ref name="IMFJune2000"/&gt;}} International Financial Centres (IFCs), such as [[New York City]], [[London]], and [[Tokyo]]; Regional Financial Centres (RFCs), such as [[Boston]], [[Frankfurt]], and [[Sydney]]; and [[Offshore Financial Centre]]s (OFCs), such as [[The Cayman Islands]], [[Dublin]], and [[Singapore]].{{efn|"Offshore" does not refer to the location of the OFC (i.e. many FSF–IMF OFCs, such as Luxembourg and Hong Kong, are located "onshore"), but to the fact that the largest users of the OFC are nonresident (i.e. the users are located "offshore").}}

IFCs, and many RFCs, are full–service financial centres with direct access to large capital pools from banks, insurance companies, investment funds, and listed capital markets, and are major [[Global city|global cities]].  OFCs, and also some RFCs, tend to specialise in tax-driven services, such as corporate tax planning [[BEPS]] tools, tax–neutral vehicles,{{efn|name=tax|''Tax–neutral'' is a term that OFCs use to describe legal structures where the OFC does not levy any taxes, duties or VAT on fund flows into, during, or exiting (e.g. no withholding taxes) the vehicle.  Major examples being the Irish [[Qualifying investor alternative investment fund (QIAIF)]], and the Cayman Islands SPC.}} and [[shadow banking]]/[[securitization]], and can include smaller locations (e.g. Luxembourg), or city-states (e.g. Singapore). The IMF notes an overlap between RFCs and OFCs (e.g. Hong Kong and Singapore are OFCs and RFCs). Since 2010, academics consider OFCs synonymous with [[tax havens]].{{efn|This is since circa 2010, after the post 2000 [[IMF]]–[[OECD]]–[[Financial Action Task Force|FATF]] initiatives on common standards, regulatory compliance, and banking transparency, which had significantly weakened the regulatory attraction of OFCs over IFCs and RFCs.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="missing profits"/&gt;}}

==Definitions==

===FSF–IMF approach===

In April 2000, the [[Financial Stability Forum]] ("FSF"),{{efn|The FSF is a group consisting of major national financial authorities such as finance ministries, central bankers, and international financial bodies}} concerned about OFCs on global financial stability produced a report listing 42 OFCs.&lt;ref name="FSF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_0004b.pdf?page_moved=1|title=Report from the Working Group on Offshore Centres|publisher=[[Financial Stability Forum]]|date=5 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2000, the IMF published a working paper on OFCs, but which also proposed a taxonomy on classifying the various types of global financial centres, which they listed as follows (with the description and examples they noted as typical of each category, also noted):&lt;ref name="IMFJune2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/np/mae/oshore/2000/eng/back.htm|title=Offshore Financial Centers: IMF Background Paper|publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|date=23 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ordered list|type=lower-roman

| International Financial Centre ("IFC").  Described by the IMF as being large international full–service centres with advanced settlement and payments systems, supporting large domestic economies, with deep and liquid markets where both the sources and uses of funds are diverse, and where legal and regulatory frameworks are adequate to safeguard the integrity of principal–agent relationships and supervisory functions. IFCs generally borrow short–term from non–residents and lend long–term to non–residents. In terms of assets, London is the largest and most established such centre, followed by New York, the difference being that the proportion of international to domestic business is much greater in the former. Examples cited by the IMF were: London, New York and Tokyo;

| Regional Financial Center ("RFC"). The IMF noted that RFCs, like IFCs, have developed financial markets and infrastructure and intermediate funds in and out of their region, but in contrast to IFCs, have relatively small domestic economies.  Examples cited by the IMF were: Hong Kong, Singapore, and Luxembourg;

| Offshore Financial Centre ("OFC"). The IMF noted that OFCs are usually smaller, and provide more specialist services, however, OFCs still ranged from centres that provide specialist and skilled activities, attractive to major financial institutions, and more lightly regulated centres that provide services that are almost entirely tax driven, and have very limited resources to support financial intermediation. The IMF listed 46 OFCs in 2000, the largest of which was Ireland, the Caribbean (includes the Cayman Islands, and the British Virgin Islands), Hong Kong, Singapore and Luxembourg.

}}

The IMF noted that the three categories were not mutually exclusive and that various locations could fall under the definition of an OFC and an RFC, in particular (e.g. Singapore and Hong Kong were cited).&lt;ref name="IMFJune2000"/&gt;  

===Rationale for OFCs===
{{see also|Offshore financial centre}}

The IMF noted that OFCs could be set up for ''legitimate purposes'' (listing various reasons), but also for what the IMF called ''dubious purposes'', citing tax evasion and money–laundering.  In 2007, the IMF produced the following definition of an OFC: ''a country or jurisdiction that provides financial services to nonresidents on a scale that is incommensurate with the size and the financing of its domestic economy''.&lt;ref name="imf"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2007/wp0787.pdf|title=Concept of Offshore Financial Centers: In Search of an Operational Definition|author=Ahmed Zoromé|publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|quote=IMF Working Paper 07/87|date=1 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FSF annual reports on global shadow banking use the IMF definition to track the OFCs with the largest financial centres relative to their domestic economies.&lt;ref name="FSF1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P050318-1.pdf|title=Global Shadow Banking and Monitoring Report: 2017|date=5 March 2018|quote=Jurisdictions with the largest financial systems relative to GDP (Exhibit 2–3) tend to have relatively larger OFI [or Shadow Banking] sectors: Luxembourg (at 92% of total financial assets), the Cayman Islands (85%), Ireland (76%) and the Netherlands (58%)|page=30|publisher=[[Financial Stability Forum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Uncovering Offshore Financial Centers Figure 3 Network of ownership flows between countries.jpg|thumb|[[Conduit and Sink OFCs]]: Mapping the links between financial centres]] 

Progress from 2000 onwards from [[IMF]]–[[OECD]]–[[Financial Action Task Force|FATF]] initiatives on common standards, regulatory compliance, and banking transparency, has reduced the regulatory attraction of OFCs over IFCs and RFCs. Since 2010, academics considered the services of OFCs to be synonymous with [[tax havens]], and use the term OFC and tax haven interchangeably (e.g. the academic [[Tax haven#Tax haven lists|lists of tax havens]] include all the FSF–IMF OFCs).&lt;ref name="h1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.ie/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1716&amp;context=articles|title=Treasure Islands|page=103-125|author=[[James R. Hines Jr.]]|journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]]|volume=4|issue=24|date=2010|quote=Tax havens are also known as “offshore financial centers” or “international financial centers”,  phrases that may carry slightly different connotations but nevertheless are used almost interchangeably with “tax havens}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="missing profits"&gt;{{cite journal| url= https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/course/zucman11.pdf|title=THE MISSING WEALTH OF NATIONS: ARE EUROPE AND THE U.S. NET DEBTORS OR NET CREDITORS?|author=[[Gabriel Zucman]]|journal=[[The Quarterly Journal of Economics]]|volume=128|issue=3|page=1321-1364|date=August 2013|quote=Tax havens are low–tax jurisdictions that offer businesses and individuals opportunities for tax avoidance” (Hines, 2008). In this paper, I will use the expression “tax haven” and “offshore financial center” interchangeably (the list of tax havens considered by Dharmapala and Hines (2009) is identical to the list of offshore financial centers considered by the Financial Stability Forum (IMF, 2000), barring minor exceptions)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, a study by the [[University of Amsterdam]]'s CORPNET group, broke down the definition of an OFC into two subgroups, [[Conduit and Sink OFCs]]:&lt;ref name="xx"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Javier Garcia-Bernardo|author2=Jan Fichtner|author3=Frank W. Takes|author4=Eelke M. Heemskerk | url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-06322-9 | volume=7 | issue=6246 | title=Uncovering Offshore Financial Centers: Conduits and Sinks in the Global Corporate Ownership Network | journal=[[Scientific Reports]], [[Nature Publishing Group]] | date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*  24 Sink OFCs: jurisdictions in which a disproportionate amount of value disappears from the economic system (e.g. the traditional [[tax havens]]).
*  5 Conduit OFCs: jurisdictions through which a disproportionate amount of value moves toward Sink OFCs (e.g. the corporate–focused [[tax haven]]s)&lt;br&gt;(Conduits are: Netherlands, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Singapore and Ireland)

Sink OFCs rely on Conduit OFCs to re–route funds from high–tax locations using [[base erosion and profit shifting]] ("BEPS") tax planning tools, which are encoded, and accepted, in the Conduit OFC's extensive networks of global bilateral [[tax treaties]].  Because Sink OFCs are more closely associated with traditional tax havens, they tend to have more limited treaty networks and access to global higher–tax locations.

==Rankings==

Prior to the 1960s, there is little data available to rank financial centres.&lt;ref name="Cassis 2006" /&gt;{{rp|1}} In recent years many rankings have been developed and published. Two of the most relevant are the ''Global Financial Centres Index'' and the ''Xinhua–Dow Jones International Financial Centres Development Index''.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite web|author1=Yoshio Okubo, Vice Chairman, Japan Securities Dealers Association|title=Comparison of Global Financial Center|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/about/pifs/symposia/japan/2014-japan/2014-japan-us-concept-papers.html|website=Harvard Law School, Program on International Financial Systems, Japan–U.S. Symposium|accessdate=30 May 2015|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global Financial Centres Index (2007–ongoing)===
{{Main|Global Financial Centres Index}}

[[File:13-08-09-peak-by-RalfR-01.jpg|thumb|The [[Central, Hong Kong|Central District]] of [[Hong Kong]], one of the main financial centres in Asia, seen from [[Victoria Peak|the Peak]].]]

The Global Financial Centres Index ("GFCI") is compiled semi–annually by the London–based British think tank [[Z/Yen]] in conjunction with the [[Shenzen]]–based think tank  [[China Development Institute]].&lt;ref name="GFCI 21"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Global Financial Centres Index 21 |date=March 2017 |accessdate=12 August 2017 |url=http://www.zyen.com/research/gfci.html |publisher=Z/Yen Group |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913172801/http://www.zyen.com/research/gfci.html |archivedate=13 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; New York City led as of September 2018, although the list has demonstrated volatility in the rankings.&lt;ref name=GFCI24/&gt;

===Major IMF OFCs===
{{see also|Conduit and Sink OFCs}}

These centres appear in all FSF–IMF lists of OFCs and, bar the Caribbean OFCs of the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands, and Bermuda, represent all the major OFCs.  Some also appear as RFCs in various lists, particularly Hong Kong, and Singapore.  They also appear on most [[tax haven#Tax haven lists|lists of major tax havens]], and on lists of the largest [[Conduit and Sink OFCs]] in the world.

* '''Amsterdam'''. Amsterdam is well known for the size of its pension fund market. It is also a centre for banking and trading activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The financial and business sector in the Amsterdam metropolitan area.|url=http://www.iamsterdam.com/~/media/PDF/FD%20Brochure.pdf|publisher=Amsterdam Business|accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amsterdam was a prominent financial centre in Europe [[Economic history of the Netherlands (1500–1815)#Merchant capitalism|in the 17th and 18th centuries]] and several of the innovations developed there were transported to London.&lt;ref name=Roberts2008 /&gt;{{rp|24}}  In June 2017, a study publilshed in ''[[Nature (magazine)|Nature]]'' ranked the Netherlands as the world's largest [[Conduit and Sink OFCs|Conduit OFC]], a term use to describe the re-routing of fund flows to tax havens.&lt;ref name="xx"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guar"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/25/netherlands-and-uk-are-biggest-channels-for-corporate-tax-avoidance|title=Netherlands and UK are biggest channels for corporate tax avoidance|publisher=The Guardian|date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2017/07/the-netherlands-is-worlds-biggest-conduit-to-offshore-tax-havens-research/ | title=The Netherlands is world’s biggest conduit to offshore tax havens: research|publisher=Dutch News NL| date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Dublin'''. Dublin (via its [[International Financial Services Centre]], "IFSC"), is a specialised financial services centre with a focus on fund administration and fund domiciling, as well as  [[base erosion and profit shifting]] ("BEPS") tax tools.

Many of the funds domiciled in Luxembourg are managed in London.&lt;ref name=EGOV2016/&gt;{{rp|5–6}} Luxembourg is the leading private banking centre in the [[Eurozone]] and the largest [[captive insurance|captive]] reinsurance centre in Europe. 143 banks from 28 different countries are established in Luxembourg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Number of banks per country of origin|url=http://www.cssf.lu/en/supervision/banks/statistics/monthly-statistics/number-of-banks-per-country-of-origin/|publisher=Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier|accessdate=25 May 2015|date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country is also the third largest [[renminbi]] centre in the world by numbers, in certain activities such as deposits, loans, bond listing and investment funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investmenteurope.net/investment-europe/news/2348962/luxembourg-third-largest-rmb-centre-worldwide|title=Luxembourg third largest RMB centre worldwide|date=9 July 2014|publisher=Investment Europe|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the largest Chinese banks have their European hub in Luxembourg ([[ICBC]], [[Bank of China]], [[China Construction Bank]]).

===Major IMF RFCs===

In some lists, RFCs such as Paris, Frankfurt, Chicago, and Shanghai appear as IFCs, however, they do not appear in all lists.  They are certainly major RFCs.

* '''Chicago'''. The [[Illinois]] city has the "world’s largest [exchange-traded] derivatives market" since the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] and the [[Chicago Board of Trade]] merged in 2007, under the [[CME Group]].&lt;ref name=twsJanO46&gt;{{cite news

* '''Dubai'''. The second largest emirate in the [[United Arab Emirates]] is a growing centre for finance in the [[Middle East]], including for [[Islamic finance]]. Its emergence as a financial centre is relatively recent, although commercial banking activity in the UAE became established in the second half of the 20th century (the first commercial bank in Dubai was [[British Bank of the Middle East]] in 1946, and the first domestic commercial bank was the [[National Bank of Dubai]] established in 1963).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dubai as an international financial centre|url=http://www.cassknowledge.com/sites/default/files/article-attachments/Dubai-international-financial-centre_0.pdf|publisher=Cass Business School|accessdate=2 June 2015|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Frankfurt'''. Frankfurt attracts many foreign banks which maintain offices in the city. It is the seat of [[Deutsche Börse]], one of the leading stock exchanges and derivatives markets operators, and the [[European Central Bank]], which sets the monetary policy for the single European currency, the [[euro]]; in addition, in 2014 the European Central Bank took over [[Single Supervisory Mechanism|responsibility for banking supervision]] for the 18 countries which form the [[Eurozone]].

Trading of equities, derivatives and fixed income securities are linked through the Madrid-based electronic Spanish Stock Market Interconnection System (SIBE), handling more than 90% of all financial transactions. Madrid ranks fourth in European equities market capitalisation, and Madrid's Stock Exchange is second in terms of number of listed companies, just behind New York Stock Exchange (NYSE plus NASDAQ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/business/economic-research-and-information/research-publications/Documents/research-2011/The%20value%20of%20europes%20international%20financial%20centres%20to%20the%20EU%20economy.pdf|title=Value of EU's Financial Centres|author=Europe Economics|publisher=City of London Corporation and TheCityUK|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a financial centre, Madrid has extensive links with Latin America and acts as a gateway for many Latin American financial firms to access the EU banking and financial markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The value of Europe’s international financial centres to the EU economy|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/business/economic-research-and-information/research-publications/Pages/value-europes-international-financial-centres-to-eu.aspx|date=6 July 2011|accessdate=23 May 2015|publisher=City of London and TheCityUK|author=Europe Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6–7}}

* '''Seoul'''. [[South Korea]]'s capital has developed significantly as a financial centre since the [[late-2000s recession]]. In 2009, Seoul ranked 53rd among global financial centres; by 2012, Seoul had risen to number 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreasociety.org/corporate/seouls_rise_as_a_global_financial_center.html|title=Seoul’s Rise as a Global Financial Center|date=21 September 2012|publisher=The Korea Society|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seoul has continued to build office space with the completion of the [[International Financial Center Seoul]] in 2013.

Sydney competes quite closely with other Asia Pacific hubs, however it concentrates a greater portion of Australian-based business in terms of clients and services. Sydney is home to two of Australia's four largest banks, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac Banking Corporation, both headquartered in the Sydney CBD.

In the sixteenth century, the overall economic supremacy of the Italian city-states gradually came to an end, and the centre of financial activities in Europe shifted to the [[Low Countries]], first to [[Bruges]], and later to [[Antwerp]] and [[Amsterdam]]. They also became important centres of financial innovation.

During [[Dutch Golden Age|their Golden Age]], the Dutch were responsible for three major institutional innovations in economic, financial and business history of the world:

The birth of the VOC is often considered to be the official beginning of corporate-led globalization with the rise of modern corporations (multinational corporations in particular) as a highly significant socio-politico-economic force that affect human lives in every corner of the world today. As the first company to be [[Listing (finance)|listed]] on an official [[stock exchange]]), the VOC was the first company to issue [[stock]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] to the general public. With its pioneering features, the VOC is generally considered a major institutional breakthrough and the model for modern [[corporation]]s (large-scale [[business enterprise]]s in particular). It was the first precursor to modern [[multinational corporation]]s.
* The establishment of the [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]] (or [[:nl:Beurs van Hendrick de Keyser|Beurs van Hendrick de Keyser]] in Dutch), the world's first official [[stock exchange]],{{efn|The concept of the [[exchange (organized market)|bourse]] (or the [[exchange (organized market)|exchange]]) was 'invented' in the medieval [[Low Countries]], most notably in predominantly Dutch-speaking cities like [[Bruges]] and [[Antwerp]], before the birth of formal stock exchanges in the 17th century. From Flemish cities the term 'beurs' spread to other European states where it was corrupted into 'bourse', 'borsa', 'bolsa', 'börse', etc. In Britain, too, the term 'bourse' was used between 1550 and 1775, eventually giving way to the term 'royal exchange'. Until the early 1600s, a bourse was not exactly a [[stock exchange]] in its modern sense. With the founding of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) in 1602 and the rise of Dutch capital markets in the early 17th century, the 'old' bourse (a place to trade [[Commodity market|commodities]], [[government bond|government]] and [[municipal bond]]s) found a new purpose – a formal exchange that specialize in creating and sustaining [[secondary market]]s in the [[Security (finance)|securities]] (such as [[corporate bond|bond]]s and [[share (finance)|share]]s of [[stock]]) issued by corporations – or a stock exchange as we know it today.&lt;ref&gt;Neal, Larry (2005).

Curott: "Business ventures with multiple shareholders became popular with ''commenda'' contracts in medieval Italy (Greif, 2006, p. 286), and Malmendier (2009) provides evidence that shareholder companies date back to ancient Rome. Yet the title of the world's first stock market deservedly goes to that of seventeenth-century Amsterdam, where an active secondary market in company shares emerged. The two major companies were the [[Dutch East India Company]] and the [[Dutch West India Company]], founded in 1602 and 1621. Other companies existed, but they were not as large and constituted a small portion of the stock market (Israel [1989] 1991, 109–112; Dehing and 't Hart 1997, 54; dela Vega [1688] 1996, 173)."&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch were the firsts to use a fully fledged capital market (including the [[bond market]] and stock market) to finance public companies (such as the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] and [[Dutch West India Company|WIC]]). This was a precedent for the global [[securities market]] in its modern form. In the early 1600s the VOC established an [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange|exchange in Amsterdam]] where VOC stock and bonds could be traded in a [[secondary market]]. The establishment of the [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]] ([[:nl:Beurs van Hendrick de Keyser|Beurs van Hendrick de Keyser]]) by the VOC, has long been recognized as the origin of modern-day stock exchanges&lt;ref&gt;Neal, Larry (2005). “Venture Shares of the Dutch East India Company,”, in ''The Origins of Value: The Financial Innovations that Created Modern Capital Markets'', Goetzmann &amp; Rouwenhorst (eds.), Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 165–175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petram, Lodewijk: ''The World's First Stock Exchange: How the Amsterdam Market for Dutch East India Company Shares Became a Modern Securities Market, 1602–1700''.

(Paris: Editions de l'Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, 420 p., 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Adam Smith]] devotes many pages to explaining how the bank guilder works (Smith 1776: 446-455). The model of the Wisselbank as a [[state bank]] was adapted throughout Europe, including the [[Bank of Sweden]] (1668) and the [[Bank of England]] (1694).

In many respects, the 17th-century Dutch financial innovations helped shape the foundations of modern-day financial system of the world,&lt;ref&gt;[[John Steele Gordon|Gordon, John Steele]]: ''[[The Great Game: The Emergence of Wall Street as a World Power: 1653–2000|The Great Game: The Emergence of Wall Street as a World Power, 1653–2000]]''. (Scribner Book Company, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0684832876}}). As [[John Steele Gordon]] (1999) noted, "Although many of the basic concepts had first appeared in Italy during the Renaissance, the Dutch, especially the citizens of the city of Amsterdam, were the real innovators. They transformed banking, stock exchanges, credit, insurance, and limited-liability corporations into a coherent financial and commercial system."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goetzmann, William N.; Rouwenhorst, K. Geert (2008). ''The History of Financial Innovation'', in ''Carbon Finance, Environmental Market Solutions to Climate Change''. (Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, chapter 1, pp. 18–43). As Goetzmann &amp; Rouwenhorst (2008) noted, "The 17th and 18th centuries in the Netherlands were a remarkable time for finance. Many of the financial products or instruments that we see today emerged during a relatively short period. In particular, merchants and bankers developed what we would today call [[securitization]]. [[Mutual fund]]s and various other forms of structured finance that still exist today emerged in the 17th and 18th centuries in Holland."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/2010/10/the-keynes-conundrum |title=The Keynes Conundrum by David P.

By the early 1800s, [[London]] officially replaced Amsterdam as the world's leading financial centre. In his book ''Capitals of Capital'' (2010), Youssef Cassis argues that the decline and fall of Amsterdam, as the world's foremost financial capital, was one of the dramatic events in history of [[global finance]].&lt;ref&gt;Cassis, Youssef (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Asia]], Tokyo emerged as a major financial centre in the 1980s as the Japanese economy became one of the largest in the world.&lt;ref name=Cassis2005 /&gt;{{rp|1}} Hong Kong and Singapore developed soon after leveraging their links with London and Britain.&lt;ref name=Wojcik2011 /&gt;{{rp|10–11}}&lt;ref name=Independent20170821/&gt; In the 21st century, other centres have grown including Toronto, Sydney, Seoul and Shanghai. Dubai has become a  centre for finance in the [[Middle East]], including for [[Islamic finance]]. The rapid rise of [[India]] has enabled Mumbai to become an emerging financial centre.  Linked to the rise of these new IFCs, has seen the rise of "partner OFCs" (offshore tax-havens to which funds are routed), such as Taiwan (a major [[Conduit and Sink OFCs|Sink OFC]] for Asia, and 7th largest global Sink OFC), Mauritius (a major [[Conduit and Sink OFCs|Sink OFC]] for S.E Asia, especially India, and Africa, and the 9th largest global Sink OFC).

The private nationwide financial system in China was first developed by the [[Shanxi merchants]], with the creation of so-called "draft banks". The first draft bank [[Rishengchang]] was created in 1823 in [[Pingyao]]. Some large draft banks had branches in Russia, Mongolia and Japan to facilitate the international trade. Throughout the nineteenth century, the central Shanxi region became the de facto financial centres of Qing China.  With the fall of Qing Dynasty, the financial centers gradually shifted to [[Shanghai]], mainly due to its geographical location at the estuary of the Yangtze river, and the control of customs in China. After the establishment of People's Republic of China, the financial centres in China today are [[Hong Kong]], [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]] and [[Shenzhen]].

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
{{nihongo|'''''Genba'''''|現場||also [[Romanization of Japanese|romanized]] as '''''gemba'''''}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term meaning "the actual place". Japanese [[detective]]s call the [[crime scene]] ''genba,'' and Japanese TV reporters may refer to themselves as reporting from ''genba.'' In business, ''genba'' refers to the place where value is created; in manufacturing the ''genba'' is the factory floor. It can be any "site" such as a construction site, sales floor or where the service provider interacts directly with the customer.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book |last=Imai |first=Masaaki |title=Gemba kaizen: a commonsense low-cost approach to management |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location=New York |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-07-031446-7 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[lean manufacturing]], the idea of ''genba'' is that the problems are visible, and the best improvement ideas will come from going to the ''genba.'' The ''gemba'' walk, much like [[Management By Walking Around]] (MBWA), is an activity that takes management to the front lines to look for waste and opportunities to practice ''genba [[kaizen]],'' or practical shop floor improvement.

In [[quality management]], ''genba'' means the [[Industrial engineering|manufacturing]] floor and the idea is that if a problem occurs, the engineers must go there to understand the full impact of the problem, gathering data from all sources. Unlike [[focus group]]s and surveys, ''genba'' visits are not scripted or bound by what one wants to ask.

Glenn Mazur&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mazur|first1=Glenn|title="QFD and the Voice of the Customer," Quality Function Deployment: A Process for Translating Customers' Needs into a Better Product and Profit|journal=GOAL/QPC 1989 Research Committee Research Report|date=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced this term into [[Quality function deployment|Quality Function Deployment]] (QFD, a quality system for new products where manufacturing has not begun) to mean the customer's place of business or [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].  The idea is that to be customer-driven, one must go to the customer's ''genba'' to understand his problems and opportunities, using all one's senses to gather and process data.

==Gemba Walk==
Gemba walks denote the action of going to see the actual process, understand the work, ask questions, and learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Womack |first=Jim |title=Gemba Walks |publisher=Lean Enterprise Institute, Inc. |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-934109-15-1 |page= 348}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lean.org/BookStore/ProductDetails.cfm?SelectedProductId=320|title=LEI - Lean Product Catalog - Lean Enterprise Publications|work=lean.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as one fundamental part of [[Lean management]] philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajm.sagepub.com/content/27/4/352.extract|title=Book Review: gemba Walks, by Jim Womack|work=sagepub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Taiichi Ohno,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Toyota Production System: Beyond Large-Scale Production |publisher=Productivity Press |year=1988 |author=Ohno, T., Bodek, N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; an executive at Toyota, led the development of the concept of the Gemba Walk. The Gemba Walk is an opportunity for staff to stand back from their day-to-day tasks to walk the floor of their workplace to identify wasteful activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | authors=Andrew Castle, Rachel Harvey | year =2009  | title = Lean information management: the use of observational data in health care | publisher=International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management, Vol. 58 Iss: 3, pp.280 - 299 | ISSN=1741-0401}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gemba Walk is designed to allow leaders to identify existing safety hazards, observe machinery and equipment conditions, ask about the practiced standards, gain knowledge about the work status and build relationships with employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getkaizened.com/blog/lean-tools-spotlights-gemba-walk-4/|title=Lean Tools Spotlights: GEMBA WALK|work=Get Kaizened Official Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of Gemba Walk is to understand the value stream and its problems rather than review results or make superficial comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lean.org/womack/DisplayObject.cfm?o=1869|title=Getting Over Gemba-phobia|work=lean.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Gembutsu|Genchi Genbutsu]] or "Go, Look, See", Gemba Walk is one of the 5 [[Lean Six Sigma|Lean]] guiding principles that should be practiced by Lean leaders on a daily basis.
The ''gemba'' walk, is an activity that takes management to the front lines to look for waste and opportunities to practice ''gemba [[kaizen]],'' or practical shopfloor improvement. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Application==
The practice of regularly going to the Lean workplace to see the actual practices is known as gemba walking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Mann, D. | year =2009  | title = The missing link: Lean leadership|publisher=Frontiers of Health Services Management, 26(1), 15-26 | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/203892154?accountid=25283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Executives should expect to spend 45 to 60 minutes every week or two gemba walking with a Lean teacher, or [[Sensei]], for six months to a year. Thereafter, they should regularly gemba walk on their own. Gemba walks are crucial to maintaining the disciplined adherence to Lean process designs, part of the Lean support role permeating all leadership positions. Gemba walks form the connective tissue that maintains the gains from Lean and the muscle that drives further improvement.

Executives should read about Lean tools and principles and attend a Lean event annually. However, the principal Lean education for executives comes via structured gemba walking with a sensei-coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mann |first=David W. |title=Creating a lean culture; tools to sustain lean conversions. |publisher=Productivity Press |year=2005 |isbn= 1563273225 |page= 211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similarities==

The term "going to the gemba" or, more appropriately, the Japanese term "genchi gembutsu" is also perceived to be comparable to [[management by walking around]]. The method bears much resemblance to the [[time and motion]] studies of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]], or even the more recent [[contextual inquiry]] and [[Contextual design]] methods, which are based in context-specific learning of work practices, in order to produce design-relevant process and product insights.

'''Jean-Paul Gut''', born on 1 July 1961, was executive director of marketing, strategy and international development at EADS. In 2007, he founded a consulting company, Coolmore International, based in London.

==Biography==
===Studies===
Jean Paul Gut graduated from the [[Institut d’Etudes Politiques de Paris]] with a master's degree in Economy.

==Matra==
Jean-Paul Gut’s career began in 1983 as Export Vice President for [[Matra]] Défense, part of the Matra Group.&lt;ref&gt;http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=8154790&amp;ticker=MMB:FP&amp;previousCapId=878300&amp;previousTitle=Lagardere%20SCA&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1988, he became the Export Marketing and Sales Executive Director. In 1990, he served as Executive Vice President of International Operations for Matra Défense Espace. Three years later, 1993, he advanced to the position of Senior Executive Vice President, in charge of international operations for the [[Lagardère Group]]. In 1996, he became the Senior Executive Vice President for Matra BAE Dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=8154790&amp;ticker=MMB:FP&amp;previousCapId=878300&amp;previousTitle=Lagardere%20SCA&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1998, Jean-Paul Gut joined the Board of Management of the Lagardère Group as Managing Director, in charge of international operations and State of the Art Technology Sector. He also became as a member of the executive management of EADS Company South Africa (Pty) Ltd. On May 11, 2005, Jean-Paul Gut served as the Director of [[Dassault]] Aviation SA, and as Executive Director of European Aeronautic Defence &amp; Space Co. N.V.&lt;ref&gt;http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=8154790&amp;ticker=MMB:FP&amp;previousCapId=878300&amp;previousTitle=Lagardere%20SCArdere%20SCA&lt;/ref&gt;

==EADS==
When EADS was created in 2000, he became a member of the board and member of the executive committee. In 2005, he was promoted to the position of executive director of EADS, and director of EADS International. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.finfacts.com/irelandbusinessnews/publish/printer_10002372.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
In June 2006, when Jean-Louis Gergorin left EADS, he was assigned to be in charge of the company’s global strategy, thus becoming executive director of marketing and strategy, overseeing all international operations. A year later, in June 2007, he officially resigned from EADS. His severance pay is 2.8 million euros, the equivalent of a 24-month salary for 24 years worked at the company.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arabianbusiness.com/gut-ache-at-eads-as-jean-paul-quits-143624.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/2007/06/11/airbus-eads-gut-face-markets-cx_ll_0611autofacescan02.html&lt;/ref&gt; Right before he left EADS, he struck a 16 billion euro deal with Qatar Airways for the sale of 80 A350.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lefigaro.fr/temp/2007/05/31/04010-20070531ARTFIG90095-l_airbus_a_perennise_par_qatar_airways.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consulting Company==
Jean-Paul Gut created his own consulting company in London, catering to French and European companies looking to expand internationally, and connecting foreign investors with European corporations working on large-scale development projects. One of his main clients is Airbus, thus he remains an influential person within the company.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intelligenceonline.com/networks-organizations/2007/12/13/lagardere-group-extends-its-reach,35774693-GRA&lt;/ref&gt;
Jean-Paul Gut, founder of the ARMAT GROUP&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jean-paul-gut.com/armat-group-2/&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008, is especially focusing on private equity, real estate and asset backed finance. Armat Group is designing innovative investment solutions with a difference that comes from its entrepreneurial background and its very international vision.
Some of the latest transactions arranged by Jean-Paul Gut and ARMAT Groupe for more details.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.armatgroup.com/an-asset-back-financing-transaction-in-real-estate-in-the-united-kingdom/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.armatgroup.com/a-private-equity-transaction-in-the-eyewear-manufacturing-business-in-china/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://le-daily.com/jean-paul-gut-mise-sur-la-start-up-harness/&lt;/ref&gt;

==The EADS case==
In June 2008, Jean-Paul Gut was indicted of insider trading when he was EADS’ executive director of marketing and strategy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/18/AR2008061803173.html&lt;/ref&gt; The EADS case, which goes back to early 2006, arose after it was revealed that hundreds of EADS employees had sold their shares a few weeks before Airbus announced delivery delays of the A380, which caused Airbus to plummet in the stock market, losing 26% of its share price in one day.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.industryweek.com/regulations/eads-group-leaders-are-not-cheats-says-ceo&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Jean-Paul Gut had sold 175,000 shares for a 1,773,250 euros capital gain. Jean-Paul Gut denied the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/economy/2007-06-11-582133944_x.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 17, 2009, the AMF (French financial authorities) firmly rejected all accusations of wrongdoings made towards Jean-Paul Gut and the other EADS executives implied in the EADS case.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelocal.de/20131203/daimler-faces-eads-insider-trading-trial&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laser converting''' or '''laser digital converting''' is a [[Manufacturing|production]] technology that enables device manufacturers to produce features that otherwise would be problematic or even impossible to [[Die preparation|die-cut]], without the need for [[Machine tool|tooling]].

In contrast to traditional mechanical converting, laser digital converting utilizes the features of [[laser]]s and advance [[software]] technology to convert parts in extremely high accuracy. In production environment, the laser digital converting is the economics of scale when the production run is short, as there is virtually no 'up-front' cost associated with machine tools making and storage. Also, the turnaround time is minimal as it only involves software interpretation on the imported engineering diagram of the part.

'''Mobile Imaging and Printing Consortium''' is a non-profit industry association formed to promote the usage of mobile devices with [[digital camera]]s, particularly [[camera phone]]s, and the printing of photographs taken with them. The association intends to do this by standardization of the software and hardware used to communicate between mobile devices with cameras and printing devices through collaboration and the implementation of guidelines. It sees direct printing, without the usage of a computer, as highly desirable. The association was founded in 2004 [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], [[Seiko Epson|Epson]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]]. New members include [[Brother Industries]], [[Eastman Kodak]], [[Fujifilm]], [[Konica Minolta]], [[Lexmark]], [[Motorola]], [[NEC]], [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]], [[Nokia]], and MCCI Corporation..

'''''Muro-Ami''''' (''Reef Hunters'') is a  1999 [[Cinema of the Philippines|Filipino film]] that depicts one of the worst forms of [[child labor]] in the illegal fishing system. The film follows the story of Fredo, a ruthless captain of 150 [[muro-ami]] divers, who employ illegal fishing practices, such as pounding and crushing corals to scare fish, driving them towards the nets. With a high quota to meet, Fredo forces the divers, who consist mostly of children, to accomplish at least eight dives a day to meet their goal before the millennium. Tired and harassed after the burdensome task being given to them, the children have to make do in subhuman conditions in the Muro Ami boat, ''The Aurora''. They sleep in rat-infested bunks and are fed only twice a day. Life above the water in the boat is much worse than the suffering the children encounter beneath the sea. For every dive, a child's life is perilously in danger.

On January 22, 2008, [[filmmaker]] Nick Deocampo, [[Executive director|Director]] of the [[Movie Workers Welfare Foundation]] (Mowelfund) announced the holding of a Ricardo Lee Film Festival from February 4 to 10, 2008 – the World Arts Festival under Mayor Tito Sarion, in [[Daet]] city, [[Camarines Norte]]. Lee's scripts became Philippine [[Film|cinema]] [[classics]] of Philippine cinema, which made the 2nd golden age of 1980 Filipino [[movies]]. 5 [[films]] will be shown in the festival: [[Gina Alajar]]'s "[[Salome]]," "[[Anak]]," "Muro Ami," "Gumapang Ka sa Lusak", and "Memories of Old Manila".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=106550 Abs-Cbn Interactive, Ricky Lee to be honored in Daet arts festival]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Fredo ([[Cesar Montano]]) is a fisherman who has endured more than his share of hardship in life; his wife and child both perished in a boating accident, and today Fredo approaches each trip to the sea with the angry determination of a man out for revenge. Fredo commands a crew of young people from poor families as he takes his rattletrap ship into the ocean in search of fish that live along the reefs, snaring catch with an illegal netting system. Not all of Fredo's youthful sailors are willing to put up with his abusive arrogance, however, and even his father Dado ([[Pen Medina]]) and close friend Botong ([[Jhong Hilario]]) have grown weary of Fredo's tirades. Fredo's body is beginning to betray him as well, and as he and his crew damage the sea's reef beds in search of fish, no one is certain how much longer he will be able to continue.

Maestro Fredo, a tyrant captain, fixates to claim the treasures of the sea—no matter what, in whatever diabolical technique for as long as he profits. He employs dozens of men, mostly children, in his dangerous expeditions. Conditions aboard the ships are oppressive. Children are often overworked and his crew is furious with the way they are living. He blames the sea for claiming the lives of his family and he exacts revenge by plundering its depths.

==Contribution to Regional Mexican music==

Shortly after arriving in Los Angeles in the late 90’s, Nir Seroussi was introduced to a music genre he never knew existed: [[Regional Mexican]].

In the early 2000s, Seroussi’s worked as songwriter, A&amp;R and marketing executive with Regional Mexican superstars Intocable and [[A.B. Quintanilla III]] , brother of the late singer [[Selena]]. During this period, A.B. Quintanilla’s group Los [[Kumbia Kings]] released multi-platinum selling albums "[[All Mixed Up: Los Remixes]]" (Platinum) , "[[Kumbia Kings discography|IV]]" (2X Platinum) , "La Historia" (2X Platinum), "Fuego" (4X Platinum)  and "[[Los Remixes 2.0|Los Remixes Vol. 2.0]]" (Platinum), while [[Intocable]] released "Sueños" (2X Platinum), "[[Kumbia Kings discography|La Historia]]" (2X Platinum), "[[Nuestro Destino Estaba Escrito]]" (2X Platinum), "[[intimamente|Íntimamente]]" (Platinum)  and "Diez" (2X Platinum).

In 2007, Seroussi spearheaded the unprecedented comeback campaign of [[Mexico]]’s living legend [[Vicente Fernandez]] . The album "[[Para Siempre]]" became the year’s best-selling Latin album (5x Platinum) and was followed by Vicente’s most successful U.S. tour in four decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aKAOa7WLRrYC&amp;pg=PT15&amp;lpg=PT15&amp;dq=vicente+fern%C3%A1ndez+%E2%80%9CPara+Siempre%E2%80%9D++best-selling+Latin|title="Latin Standouts". Billboard. January 29, 2009.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a trip to Sonora in 2008, Mexico he discovered a group called Los Pikadientes  ("The Toothpicks") from the small town of Caborca. Seroussi signed [[Los Pikadientes de Caborca|Los Pikadientes]] on the spot and their first single "La Cumbia Del Rio" was a No. 1 hit in the U.S .&lt;ref&gt;"Mexican Bands Hear Success Calling". The New York Times. April 3, 2009 https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/05/arts/music/05kun.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=2&lt;/ref&gt; The group’s [[Grammy]] -nominated debut album was certified Platinum + Gold.

In 2010, Seroussi signed 20-year-old Gerardo Ortiz,&lt;ref&gt;"Gerardo Ortiz Sweeps Billboard Mexican Music Awards". Billboard. October 21, 2011. http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/465586/gerardo-ortiz-sweeps-billboard-mexican-music-awards&lt;/ref&gt; a young singer-songwriter from Pasadena, California who has become the most successful Regional Mexican artist of the decade. With six number-one albums, Ortiz is the sole record holder for most crowning albums from any artist since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/6582790/gerardo-ortiz-record-breaking-no-1-top-latin-albums|title="Gerardo Ortiz Scores Record-Breaking No. 1 on Top Latin Albums".

'''Sawtooth Software, Inc.''' is a [[computer software]] company based in [[Provo, Utah]], United States.  The company provides survey software tools, and specializes in [[conjoint analysis]].

According to the [[American Marketing Association]], Sawtooth Software was ranked fourth in 2005 among software used in [[market research]] (after [[SPSS]], [[Microsoft Excel]], and [[SAS System]]).&lt;ref&gt;Marketing News, February 1, 2005, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In the late 1960s, Rich Johnson, who was then an employee of Market Facts, Inc., developed a technique they called "Tradeoff Analysis".  It consisted of questioning respondents about various concepts composed of multiple attributes and comparing the responses to the different concepts.  In 1971, Paul Green published an article "Conjoint Measurement for Quantifying Judgmental Data".&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Market Research, 8:355-63, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  When Johnson became aware of Green's research, he identified his technique as a variety of conjoint analysis.

In the mid 70's, Johnson co-founded the John Morton Company in part to apply computer technology to Tradeoff Analysis.  Johnson purchased an Apple II and began to program interviews for use on client projects.  Each project was programmed custom for the client.  During this time Johnson was fascinated by the ability of the computer to facilitate collection of respondent data.

In 1982 Johnson left the John Morton Company and founded Sawtooth Software to pursue creating generalized software for use in marketing research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sawtoothsoftware.com/download/techpap/histaca.pdf History of ACA, Richard M Johnson, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==

Sawtooth Software has created products for traditional conjoint analysis, as well as discrete choice analysis and other forms of conjoint.  In addition are non-conjoint products involving interviewing, perceptual mapping, and cluster analysis.

Conjoint Techniques:
* Adaptive Conjoint Analysis (ACA)
* Adaptive Choice Based Conjoint (ACBC)
* Choice Based Conjoint (CBC)
* Conjoint Value Analysis (CVA)
* Maximum Difference Scaling (MaxDiff)
* Menu-Based Choice (MBC)

Analysis Techniques:
* Hierarchical Bayes (HB)
* Latent Class (LC)
* Logit
* Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
* Convergent Cluster &amp; Ensemble Analysis (CCEA)
* Composite Product Mapping (CPM) (retired)

General Interviewing Packages
* Lighthouse Studio
* Discover
* Ci3 (retired)

==Relationships==

Sawtooth Software maintains relationships with academics and market research organizations such as the [[American Marketing Association]] and [[ESOMAR]].  Researchers developing new interviewing techniques such as Maximum Difference (Best Worst) have used Sawtooth Software to assist in constructing their projects.

In addition to producing products, Sawtooth Software has also hosted a research conference every 18 months in the United States since 1987.  The conference is not a sales event, and speakers with contrary opinions or competing products attend and present.

'''''Steve Harvey's Funderdome''''' is an American business [[Reality show|reality competition]] show that premiered June 11, 2017 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and produced by [[MGM Television]]. In a format similar to ''[[Shark Tank]]'', the show features two contestants who pitch products to a studio audience which votes on who will get [[seed funding]] for their project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-steve-harvey-working-hard-20161117-story.html|title=How Steve Harvey became the new 'hardest working man in show business'|last=Braxton|first=Greg|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=November 25, 2016|accessdate=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=French/&gt;

== Format ==
Each show features three competitions between two inventors (or teams of inventors) competing for the same amount of seed funding—$10,000, $20,000, $50,000, or $100,000. One inventor gives a pitch, followed by a short question-and-answer period with Harvey; the process then repeats for the other inventor. After this, the audience votes on which product they would like to see funded.

Before the winner is revealed, both competitors are offered the opportunity to "cash out." Both inventors (or one chosen member from a team) stand next to a button. A series of amounts—which may increase or decrease—are shown on a screen, along with a timer; to cash out at a particular value, a contestant must hit the button before the timer runs out. Most cash out offers are between 5 and 25 percent of the desired amount (e.g., $5,000–$25,000 for inventors seeking $100,000). In some cases, Harvey has revealed the percentages of the vote before giving the inventors the chance to cash out.

There are three possible outcomes for each competition:
* Neither inventor cashes out: The vote winner gets the full amount, while the loser gets nothing.
* Vote loser cashes out: The vote winner gets the full amount, while the loser gets the cash-out amount.
* Vote winner cashes out: The vote winner gets the cash-out amount, while the loser gets nothing.

== International versions ==
Shortly before the show's debut, MGM Worldwide Television Distribution announced that [[TF1]] acquired the rights to the [[France|French]] version of the show.&lt;ref name=French&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/national-geographic-nike-documentary-1202458440/|title=TV News Roundup: MGM TV Sells Steve Harvey’s ‘Funderdome’ Format Rights to French Distributor|last=Rubin|first=Rebecca|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=June 8, 2017|accessdate=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Piracy ==
On June 5, 2017, a message from a believed to be [[cybercriminal]] stated that eight episodes of this series were already online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/06/hackers-steve-harveys-funderdome-dark-overlord-abc-1202107395/|title=Hackers Post ABC’s Steve Harvey Summer Series Online|last=Hipes|first=Patrick|publisher=deadline.com|date=June 5, 2017|accessdate=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar group had earlier [[Internet leak|leaked]] episodes of ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]''. However, ABC had no public comment about the [[copyright infringement|piracy]] of the show, which was not expected to affect the show's viewership because the target audience was considered unlikely to use piracy websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Spangler |first1=Todd |title=ABC Won’t Change TV Premiere Plans for Series Stolen and Leaked to Piracy Site |url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/disney-abc-hack-piracy-steve-harveys-funderdome-1202454092/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety.com]] |accessdate=2017-07-16 |date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, he was the host in the New Zealand incarnation of the hit TV series ''[[The Apprentice New Zealand|The Apprentice]]''. His commercial property empire was hit hard in the [[global financial crisis]] and he was declared bankrupt in 2011, owing more than $200 million. He has been discharged of bankruptcy as of 24 October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Terry Serepisos not bankrupt, will give evidence|url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/10658986/Terry-Serepisos-not-bankrupt-will-give-evidence|newspaper = Stuff.co.nz|date = 24 October 2014|access-date = 2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in the village of Paleros Akarnania, [[Greece]], Terry Serepisos and his family emigrated to [[New Zealand]] when he was two years old. Serepisos attended [[Rongotai College]] with [[New Zealand national football team|All Whites]] legend [[Wynton Rufer]].&lt;ref name="quote"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/football/3546326/Phoenix-boss-our-saviour |title=Phoenix boss 'our saviour' |work=stuff.co.nz |year=2011 |quote='They say I'm the saviour of football in this country. Well, they're right.'  |accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
Serepisos made his name in property development, having previously been involved in the Italian [[menswear]] and Nightclub business'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/3352356/Terry-Serepisos-The-Apprentices-boss|title=Terry Serepisos - The Apprentice's boss|website=Stuff}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Century City group managed a portfolio of properties in the greater Wellington area including commercial buildings, high-end inner city apartments, retail spaces and residential homes.

He has invested in, and developed, a number of  Wellington landmark sites. These include the former Bank of New Zealand (Manners Street), Maison Cabriole (Tory Street), National Bank Building ([[Courtenay Place, Wellington|Courtenay Place]]), Prudential Building ([[Lambton Quay]]), Century City Tower (former World Trade Centre, Victoria Street), Lone Star Building (Tory Street), Century City Carpark Building (Tory Street), and IBM Building (The Esplanade, [[Petone]]).

==Sport==

===Wellington Phoenix===
On 19 March 2007 it was announced that New Zealand Football would be entering a new Wellington-based team into the [[A-League]] and that Serepisos would be providing the one million dollars ([[New Zealand dollar|NZD]]) start-up capital and be the club's sole owner. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928050148/http://www.infonews.co.nz/news.cfm?l=86&amp;t=0&amp;id=407] In the first season of the club, Serepisos played a key role in getting [[England national football team|English]] footballer [[David Beckham]] and his [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] team to play an exhibition game against the Wellington club. In 2007 Serepisos was the recipient of the Mercure Wellington Sports Personality of the Year award for his contribution to sport in Wellington in the year that had passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/5673778/Timeline-of-Serepisos-and-the-Phoenix |title=Terry Serepisos Phoenix Timeline|work=stuff.co.nz |year=2011 |quote=Serepisos was the recipient of the Mercure Wellington Sports Personality of the Year award for his contribution to sport in Wellington. |accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many New Zealand football fans believe that it was Serepisos' actions that helped get the [[New Zealand national football team]] into the [[2010 World Cup]]. Serepisos has been open to agree with the argument ''"They say I'm the saviour of football in this country. Well, they're right."''&lt;ref name="quote"/&gt;

On 23 September 2011, it was announced that Serepisos had relinquished ownership of the club after ongoing personal financial difficulties. Subsequently a new consortium of 7 Wellington businessman headed by Rob Morrison took control of the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/2009InsideFFA/default.aspx?s=insideffa_newsfeatures_newsitem_new&amp;id=41074 | title=Phoenix secure new owners | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926153519/http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/2009InsideFFA/default.aspx?s=insideffa_newsfeatures_newsitem_new&amp;id=41074 | archivedate=26 September 2011 | date=23 September 2011 | author=FFA | publisher=Football Federation Australia | accessdate=6 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Serepisos was declared [[bankrupt]] the following Monday.&lt;ref name="bank"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10754427 |title=Terry Serepisos declared bankrupt  |work=nzherald.co.nz |quote=Wellington businessman and former Phoenix football owner Terry Serepisos has been declared bankrupt in the High Court at Wellington after his last-minute bid for more time to pay debts was rejected. |accessdate=26 September 2011 |date=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Serepisos featured in the 13-week first series of ''[[The Apprentice New Zealand]]'' as the master to the would-be apprentices. The show aired in New Zealand on [[TV One (New Zealand)|TV One]]. Thomas Ben won and was awarded a $200,000 employment deal working with Serepisos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/the-apprentice-nz/ta-ent-apprentice-nz-index-group-3329141 |title=The Apprentice NZ &amp;#124; Television New Zealand|work=tvnz.co.nz |year=2011 |accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv/3686159/Apprentice-winner-praises-boss |title=Apprentice winner praises boss |work=stuff.co.nz |year=2011 |accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"The labor problem"''' is the [[economics]] term widely used toward the turn of the twentieth century with various applications.&lt;ref&gt;"the labor problem." Roberts, Harold Selig.  1994. Roberts' Dictionary of Industrial Relations. p. 406&lt;/ref&gt; It has been defined in many ways, such as "the problem of improving the conditions of employment of the wage-earning classes."&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Thomas Sewall. 1908. Labor Problems: A Text Book. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  It encompasses the difficulties faced by wage-earners and employers who began to cut wages for various reasons including increased technology, desire for lower costs or to stay in business. The wage-earning classes responded with strikes, by unionizing and by committing acts of outright violence. It was a nationwide problem that spanned nearly all industries and helped contribute to modern business conditions still seen today. Possible causes include the failure to account for the negative [[externality]] of reproduction in the face of finite natural resources which results in over-supply of labor and falling living standards for wage-laborers, depersonalization by machines and poor working conditions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Time frame==
A popular debate about the labor problem is the time that it encompasses. Some characterize it back as far as the 1860s, which is when many [[trade union | unions]] and groups began to form. However there wasn’t a problem present at this time with the formation of these unions. Also, the first strike was a result of the problem between wage earners and union officials, not employers and unions or employers and wage-earners, which was the main conflict of this time.&lt;ref name=movement&gt;“The Labor Movement: A Violent Period in American History.” ILWU Local 19, n.d. Web. 5 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the problem was within unions and not between unions and employers, the Labor Problem had not yet become an issue. Many also attribute the end of the problem to the end of the 1920s. This has some merit but is also open to interpretation. Reforms began to pass to correct many of the problems but reforms continued to pass well into the 1930s, 40s and 50s. The [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1896–1954) | Civil Rights Movement]] took over in [[United States of America | America]], which brought about even further legislation. Many attribute the end of the labor problem to the late 1920s because it marks a significant drop in strikes and violence and an increase in passed legislation aimed at correcting the labor issues.

==Causes==
At the turn of the century machines were beginning to take a stronger footing in the economy, which drove costs down. Always trying to maximize profits, employers saw fit to lower wages for two main reasons. Machines were making the production process cheaper meaning wages took up a bigger percentage of costs, and when times were particularly tough, it made sense to cut wages to stay in business.&lt;ref&gt;Barbash, Jack. “"The Legal Foundations of Capitalism" and the Labor Problem.”  Journal of Economic Issues 10. 4 (1976), pp. 799-810. Online.&lt;/ref&gt; This depersonalization of the production process meant that people essentially became expendable. People were not eliminated completely but there was a significant job loss. This led to lower wages in the [[long run]] because [[fixed costs]] decreased (with increased technology) so employers saw fit to cut wage expenses for this now partially expendable labor force. Although the problem spanned many industries, they were not all concerned with the same problems. For example, the steel industry was mainly concerned with being phased out due to technological advances while other industries, namely textiles, had problems with [[child labor]] and working conditions. The variety of problems and concerns led to legislation being passed, which covered different areas and led to greater reform.

==Notable events==
Riots broke out in [[Baltimore]] in 1877 due to the negligence of union officials. It began as a railroad strike but eventually formed riots that lasted four days and killed fifty people.&lt;ref name=movement/&gt; The first strike due to depersonalization by machines was the [[Homestead Strike]] in 1892 on the [[Carnegie Steel Company]] by the [[Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers]] (AA).&lt;ref&gt;Field 1893, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; This ultimately resulted in the attempted assassination of [[Henry Clay Frick]], Chairman of The Carnegie Steel Company, and a crushing blow in the attempt to unionize steel workers. Another example is the [[Pullman Strike]] in 1894, where almost 4,000 workers who were members of the [[American Railway Union]] (ARU) went on a strike without permission of the union to protest wage cuts by the [[Pullman Company]].&lt;ref&gt;"Pullman Strike." Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia. Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. 27 Dec. 2013. Web. 28 Dec. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; One extreme example occurred when train engineers and laborer stopped a train before it reached the station in [[New York City]], stranding men, women and children alike in the heat.&lt;ref&gt;Field 1893, pp. 61-68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
Legislation like the [[Wagner Act]] (1935) and the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] (1938) were passed which forced employers to participate in collective bargaining and presented a minimum wage respectively.&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;"Timeline of labor issues and events." Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia. Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. 18 Dec. 2013. Web. 10 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Child Labor laws have also been reformed, limiting the age at which children can begin work and what type of work they can perform. The [[Department of Labor]] was established in 1913.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt; While some pieces of legislation like the aforementioned [[Wagner Act]] and [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] weren’t passed until the 1930s, their roots trace back to this Labor Problem at the turn of the century when demand for reform was growing in popularity. Many aspects of modern business like an established 40-hour work week, overtime pay, [[collective bargaining]] and safer working conditions among numerous other reforms can all trace their roots back to this time period and the legislation passed to correct it.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32180">{{For|transformation in [[development economics]]|economic transformation}}

'''Transformation in economics''' refers to a long-term change in dominant economic activity in terms of prevailing relative engagement or employment of able individuals.

Human economic systems undergo a number of deviations and departures from the "normal" state, trend or development. Among them are Disturbance (short-term disruption, temporary disorder), Perturbation (persistent or repeated divergence, predicament, decline or crisis), Deformation (damage, regime change, loss of self-sustainability, distortion), Transformation (long-term change, restructuring, conversion, new “normal”) and Renewal (rebirth, transmutation, corso-ricorso, renaissance, new beginning).

Transformation is a [[Unidirectional network|unidirectional]] and irreversible change in dominant human economic activity ([[Economic sectors|economic sector]]). Such change is driven by slower or faster continuous improvement in sector productivity growth rate. Productivity growth itself is fueled by advances in technology, inflow of useful innovations, accumulated practical knowledge and experience, levels of education, viability of institutions, quality of decision making and organized human effort. Individual sector transformations are the outcomes of human [[socio-economic]] evolution.

Human economic activity has so far undergone at least four fundamental transformations:

#From nomadic hunting and gathering (H/G) to localized agriculture
#From localized agriculture (A) to internationalized industry
#From international industry (I) to global services
#From global services (S) to public sector (including government, welfare and unemployment, GWU)

This evolution naturally proceeds from securing necessary food, through producing useful things, to providing helpful services, both private and public (See H/G→A→I→S→GWU sequence in Fig. 1).  Accelerating productivity growth rates speed up the transformations, from millennia, through centuries, to decades of the recent era. It is this acceleration which makes transformation relevant economic category of today, more fundamental in its impact than any recession, crisis or depression. The evolution of four forms of capital (Indicated in Fig. 1) accompanies all economic transformations.

Transformation is quite different from accompanying cyclical recessions and crises, despite the similarity of manifested phenomena (unemployment, technology shifts, socio-political discontent, bankruptcies, etc.). However, the tools and interventions used to combat crisis are clearly ineffective for coping with non-cyclical transformations. The problem is whether we face a mere crisis or a fundamental transformation (globalization→relocalization).

== Four key forms of capital ==
[[File:Fig1. Nested hypercycles of the transformations through the parallel evolution of four forms of capital.PNG|thumb|Fig. 1. Nested hypercycles of the transformations through the parallel evolution of four forms of capital|287x287px]]

Fig. 1 refers to the four transformations through the parallel (and overlapping) evolution of four forms of capital: Natural→Built→Human→Social. These evolved forms of capital present a minimal complex of sustainability and self-sustainability of pre-human and human systems.

'''[[Natural capital|Natural capital (N)]]'''. The nature-produced, renewed and reproduced “resources” of land, water, air, raw materials, biomass and organisms. Natural capital is subject to both renewable and non-renewable depletion, degradation, cultivation, recycling and reuse.

'''Built capital (B)'''. The man-made physical assets of infrastructures, technologies, buildings and means of transportation. This is the manufactured “hardware” of nations. This national hardware must be continually maintained, renewed and modernized to assure its continued productivity, efficiency and effectiveness.

'''[[Human capital|Human capital (H)]]'''. The continued investment in people’s skills, knowledge, education, health &amp; nutrition, abilities, motivation and effort. This is the “software” and “brainware” of a nation; most important form of capital for developing nations.

'''[[Social capital|Social capital (S)]]'''. The enabling infrastructure of institutions, civic communities, cultural and national cohesion, collective and family values, trust, traditions, respect and the sense of belonging. This is the voluntary, spontaneous “social order” which cannot be engineered, but its self-production (autopoiesis) can be nurtured, supported and cultivated.

== Parallelism of crises and transformations ==
The triggers that induce the catharsis of a crisis often coincide with and are undistinguishable from the triggers launching qualitative transformations of the economy, business and society at large. While crises are cyclical recessions or slowdowns within the same paradigm, transformation represents a paradigmatic change in the way of doing business: moving towards new standards and quality, in a unique and non-recursive way.  Most developed and mature economies of the world (USA, Japan, Western Europe) are undergoing long-term transformation towards a “new normal” of doing business, state governance and ways of life. Cyclical crisis is a parallel, accompanying phenomenon, subject to different causes, special rules and separate dynamics.

[[Milan Zeleny]] cautions that confounding crisis and transformation as one phenomenon brings forth the confusion, inconsistency and guessing.&lt;ref name="Crisis"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://iospress.metapress.com/content/d54282m4176x844n/ | title=Machine/organism dichotomy and free-market economics: Crisis or transformation? | publisher=IOS Press | author=Zeleny, Milan | journal=Human Systems Management |date=November 2010 | volume=29 | issue=4/2010 | pages=P191–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many changes in the market system are cyclical, there are also evolutionary changes which are unidirectional and qualitatively transformational. The transformations of the US economy from agricultural to industrial, or from industrial to services, were not crises, although there were cyclical crises along the way. Transformational “losses” cannot be recovered or regained by definition. Not understanding that is at the core of wasteful spending of rigidly hopeless governmental interventions. Barry Bosworth of the [[Brookings Institution]] confirms:  “The assumption has always been that the U.S. economy will gain back what was lost in a recession. Academics are coming to the realization that this time is different and that those losses appear permanent and cannot be regained.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-03-06/u-dot-s-dot-potential-gdp-revised-downward-as-recession-damage-lingers | title=The GDP in 2017 Is Not Looking Good | publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek | date=March 2014 | author=Brendan Greeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In transformations there are no “losses”, only changes and transitions to a new economic order.

== Underlying pattern of recessions ==
[[File:Percent Job Losses After WWII Recessions.jpg|thumb|Fig. 2. Comparison of major US recessions over past 30 years|452x452px]]

When comparing major US recessions since 1980, as in Fig. 2, it is clear that they have been getting deeper and longer in terms of the recovery of initial employment level. Only the first is classical V shape, there are several W, U and finally L shapes. There clearly is an underlying causal phenomenon which is getting stronger and more persistent over time. Such underlying causation is of interest, as it may signal the prelude and gathering of forces of another emerging transformation.

Looking back, even [[Great Depression in the United States|the Great Depression]] of the 1930s was not just a crisis, but a long-term transformation from the pre-war industrial economy to the post-war service economy in the U.S. However, in the early 1980s, the service sector had started slowing down its employment absorption and growth potential, ultimately leading to the jobless economy of 2011. No such comparisons with the 1930s are useful: one can compare recessions but not transformations. Industrial economy of 1930s and the post-service economy of 2000s are two different “animals” in two different contexts. It is still not clear what kind of transformation is emerging and eventually replaces the service and public sector economy.

The unrecognized confluence of crisis and transformation, and the inability to separate them, lies at the core of old tools ([[Keynesian economics|keynesianism]], [[monetarism]]) not working properly. The tools for adapting successfully to paradigmatic transformation have not been developed.  An example of a paradigmatic transformation would be the shift from geocentric to heliocentric view of our world.  Within both views there can be any number of crises, cyclical failures of old and searches for new theories and practices. But there was only one transformation, from geocentric to heliocentric, and there was nothing cyclical about it. It was resisted with all the might of the mighty: remember Galilei and Bruno. While crises are cyclical corrections and adjustments, transformations are evolutionary shifts or even revolutions (industrial, computer) towards new and different levels of existence.

The most important indicator is the arena of employment, especially in the US, providing clues to transformational qualities of the current global crisis phenomena. Persistent rates of unemployment, combined with falling workforce participation rate indicate that also this crisis is intertwined with underlying transformation and so it displays atypical dynamics and unusual persistence, presenting new challenges to conventional economic thought, business practices and government interventional “toolbox”. Sector evolution and dynamics is the key to explaining these phenomena.

== Sector dynamics ==
[[Economic sectors]] evolve (in terms of employment levels), albeit through fluctuations, in one general direction (along so called S-curve): they emerge, expand, plateau, contract and exit—just like any self-organizing system or living organism. We are naturally interested in the percentage of total workforce employed in a given sector. The dynamics of this percentage provides clues to where and when are the new jobs generated and old ones abandoned.

Sector’s percentage share of employment evolves in dependency on sector’s productivity growth rate.  Agriculture has emerged and virtually disappeared as a source of net employment. Today, only ½ percent or so of total workforce is employed in US agriculture – the most productive sector of the economy. Manufacturing had emerged, peaked and contracted. Services have emerged and started contracting – all due to incessant, unavoidable and desirable productivity growth rates.

The [[Manufacturing in the United States|U.S. absolute manufacturing output]] has more than tripled over the past 60 years. Because of the productivity growth rates, these goods were produced by ever decreasing number of people. While in 1980-2012 total economic output per hour worked increased 85 percent, in manufacturing output per hour skyrocketed by 189 percent. The number of employees in manufacturing was about a third of total workforce in 1953, about a fifth in 1980, and about a tenth (12 million) in 2012. This decline is now accelerating because of the high-tech automation and robotization. This is why President Obama´s policy of “industrial renaissance” and “high-tech manufacturing jobs” is economically flawed and politically without promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Industrial renaissance in the US: miracle or mirage?|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/13352#.UuhCTBAo6M8|publisher=Spiked Magazine|author=Phil Mullan|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A public sector of employment has been emerging: government, welfare and unemployment, based on tax-financed consumption rather than added value production, sheltered from market forces, producing public services. (Observe that the unemployed are temporary “employees” of the government, as long as they receive payments.) Creating employment in GWU sector is achievable at the expense of productive sectors, i.e. only at the risk of major debt accumulation, in a non-lasting way and with low added value. Sustaining employment growth in such a sector is severely limited by the growing debt financing.

== The Four Basic Sectors ==
The Four Basic Sectors refers to the current stage of [[industrial sector|sector]] evolution, in the sequence of four undergone transformations, namely [[agriculture]], [[industry]], [[Service (business)|services]] and GWU ([[government]], [[welfare]] and [[unemployment]])

The US economy has become one of the most mature (with Japan and Western Europe) in terms of its sector evolution.&lt;ref name="M. Zeleny 1"&gt;{{cite book | title=Human Systems Management: Integrating Knowledge, Management &amp; Systems | publisher=World Scientific | last=Zeleny | first=Milan | year=2005 | pages=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;    It has entered the stage – perhaps as the first economy ever – of declining employment share in both the service and government sectors.

[[Productivity]] growth rates are now{{when|date=February 2018}} accelerating in the US services and its employment creation and absorption potential are declining rapidly. Accelerating productivity growth rates are dictated by global competition and human striving for better [[standards of living]] – they cannot be stopped at will.  In the US there are only three subsectors where net jobs are still being created: [[education in the US|education]], [[health care in the US|health care]], and government. The first two are subject to market forces and will undergo accelerating productivity growth rates and declining employment levels in the near future{{when|date=February 2018}}. The third one, GWU, is sheltered from competition, cannot expand its share substantially because it depends on taxation from other sectors; its [[employment growth]] is [[unsustainable]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Slowly, the US economy has shifted towards sectors with lower added value, leading to lower real incomes and increasing indebtness. This is a systemic condition which no amount of regulation and [[Keynesian]]/monetarist stimuli can effectively address.  Even desirable piercing of speculative, employment and debt bubbles has ceased to be politically correct. Even 100% taxation of all incomes would not alleviate US debt.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

So, the US is at the transforming cusp and hundreds of years of sector evolution comes to a halt.  There are only four essential activities humans can do economically: 1. [[food production|Produce food]], 2. Manufacture goods, 3. Provide services (private and public), and 4. Do nothing. This is why the idea of “[[basic income]]”, independent of employment, is being considered e.g. in Switzerland.

US economy has exploited (from employment share viewpoint) all three productive sectors. There is no new sector lurking in the offing: qualitative transformation is taking place. Less developed economies still have time left, some still have to industrialize and some still have the services to expand. But the US economy is now the harbinger of the things to come, the role model for others to follow or reject, but hardly ignore. For the first time in history, this one economy has reached the end of the old model (or paradigm) and is groping to find the new ways of organizing its business, economy and society.&lt;ref name="M. Zeleny 2"&gt;{{cite book | title=Human Systems Management: Integrating Knowledge, Management &amp; Systems | publisher=World Scientific | last=Zeleny | first=Milan | year=2005 | pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In search of the better name, the [[Bloomberg Businessweek]] Editor argued as follows:

{{quote|"You’d expect a better name to have emerged by now. It took remarkable ingenuity to unleash the forces that paralyzed markets, overturned governments, and ruined countless lives, not to mention causing an historic decline in global gross domestic product. For creativity to fail in the summing up is just one more insult. Of course, it’s hard to name what you can’t comprehend." |Editor´s Letter|[[Businessweek]] , September 12, 2013}}

Meanwhile, New Transformation has already well advanced.

In Fig. 3a, observe that the US economy has matured in terms of its sector evolution. It has entered the stage – as the first economy ever – of declining employment in the service and GWU sectors.

As Fig. 3a documents, the US economy has exhausted (from employment viewpoint) all three productive sectors and has reached for the 17% in GWU. In Fig. 3b we separate the last workforce bar from Fig. 3a, in order to see the impact of productivity growth today.

All four sectors are subject to accelerated productivity growth rates in the near future. The only expanding space of the workforce is the grey region “?” in Fig. 3b, essentially reflecting the decline in workforce participation rate. This grey area is also the space of the new transformation: that’s where those who left unemployment registers are starting new ventures and enterprises, and participating in regional economies.

This new “transformation” is different from all preceding sector transformations: it does not usher in a new sector but completes the secular cycle of localization→globalization→re-localization. A new economic paradigm is emerging, with a new structure, behavior, institutions and values. A more precise label would be Economic Metamorphosis. [[Metamorphosis]] is the outcome of a series of transformations, not dissimilar to a caterpillar-to-butterfly change of form, through the construction→destruction→reconstruction autopoietic self-production cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Mystery_of_Metamorphosis.html?id=2G7VWWKRMa4C | title=The Mystery of Metamorphosis: A Scientific Detective Story | publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing | date=April 2011 | last=Ryan | first=Frank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when the recession ends, the metamorphosis of economic form shall continue, accelerate and expand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shale: the ‘IT bubble’ of the 21st century?|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/13363#.UuhZvxAo6M8|publisher=Spiked Magazine|author=Phil Mullan|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Less and less we shall be able to tell the difference. Pressures for increased productivity growth rates, declining employment and workforce participation, as well as budget cuts shall grow unabated. Due to massive automation, sector GDP can grow even under the conditions of declining employment. More than that: increasing the minimum wage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minimum Wage, Wage and Hour Division, Department of Labor|url=http://www.dol.gov/whd/minimumwage.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; historically rather neutral with respect to employment, will now be readily replacing low-level jobs with ever cheaper and more abundant automation - along with millions of jobs being lost due to the still uninformed and aimless political process. Obscuring the difference between cyclical crisis and the ongoing transformation (metamorphosis) is not without consequences: when true diagnosis is not attempted, and people do not know what is happening with their economy and why, all forms of contagious social unrest follow worldwide.

== Okun's law ==
[[File:Fig. 4. Labor participation.png|thumb|Fig. 4. Labor participation|228x228px]]
In economics, [[Okun's law]] (named after [[Arthur Melvin Okun]]), is an empirically observed relationship relating unemployment to losses in a country's production. This correlation "law" states that a 2% decline in output (GDP) will be accompanied by a 1% rise in unemployment. It has been dubbed as “[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-09-26/macroeconomic-mystery-u-dot-s-dot-unemployment-subverts-okuns-law Macroeconomic Mystery]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Macroeconomic Mystery | journal=Business Week |date=30 September – 6 October 2013 | pages=P24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After holding for the past 40 years, it faltered during current “recovery”. Unemployment shot up faster than predicted, but then it fell more quickly than indicated by slow U.S. growth in 2009-2013. Output grew 2% but unemployment is 7.6% instead of 8.8% expected by this “law”.

The notion of transformation explains this artificial mystery. First, unemployment shot up faster because there are no major sectors absorbing and replacing the loss of jobs. Second, unemployment also falls faster because, due to the long duration of the crisis, the workforce participation rate keeps shrinking (In 2007, 66% were working or seeking job, in 2013 only 63.2%), as can be seen in Fig. 4. In other words, people leaving the workforce are not counted among the unemployed. For example, in summer 2013, on average only 148,000 new jobs per month were created, yet unemployment rate dropped steeply to 7.3%, at the cost of 312,000 people dropping out of the work force. The number of unemployed (i.e. actively seeking jobs) is different from the number of people without work – another sign of fundamental transformation and not just a “crisis”.

The correlation between growth and employment is very tenuous during ongoing transformation. Based on productivity growth rates, GDP could accelerate and yet jobs drop precipitously, due to automation, robotization, digitization and self-service of the transformation era. Also, correlations in economics are always dangerous because they do not prove or establish causal relationships.

== Self-service, disintermediation and customization ==
The new transformational paradigm could be defined by the ongoing self-organization of the market economy itself: its rates of self-service, [[disintermediation]] and [[mass customization]] are increasing and becoming most effective on local and regional levels. Because there is no new productive sector to emerge, the economy seeks to reinstate its new balance through these new modes of doing business. Producers and providers are outsourcing their production and services to customers and to technology. Outsourcing to customers is a natural and necessary self-organizing process, including disintermediation, customer integration and mass customization, all driven by the global productivity at the cusp of transformation.

Due to its productivity growth rates, each sector must emerge, grow, persist, stagnate, decline and dissipate in terms of its employment generating capacity. The high-productivity growth sectors are emerging and dissipating first, the low-productivity growth sectors (like services) are completing their life cycles only now. Different productivity growth rates in different sectors are accompanied by virtually uniform growth rates in wages and salaries across all sectors, as required by free market forces.

As a consequence, the goods of high productivity growth sectors (food, manufactured goods) are getting cheaper and the products of low productivity growth sectors (health care, education, insurance) are getting more expensive. In many developing nations this may still be the other way around (due to the prevailing stage of sector evolution): food and manufactured goods more expensive, while services still relatively cheap, as captured in the Figure 5:
[[File:Fig. 5. Uniform wage growth vs. differential productivity rates.PNG|thumb|Fig. 5. Uniform wage growth vs. differential productivity rates|372x372px]]

Rational economics agents tend towards substituting relatively cheaper and capital intensive manufactured goods for relatively more expensive and labor-intensive services. Consumers will use goods instead of services wherever economical and possible. By observing the emergence of automated teller machines instead of bank tellers, self-service gas stations instead of full-service stations, self-driving instead of chauffeurs, do-it-yourself pregnancy kits rather than hospital testing services, self-handled optical scanners rather than cashiers, and cloud computing instead of central mainframes, mature economies are entering the era of self-service, disintermediation and mass customization.

Modern production is primarily based on the processing of information, not on the hauling of goods, humans and machinery over large distances.  One can more effectively “haul the information,” to produce goods and provide services locally. Information and knowledge travel effortlessly through electronic superhighways, through telecommunications and social networks over the internet.

== Relocalization ==
{{See also|Localism (politics)}}
Because there is no new productive sector to emerge, the market system seeks to reinstate its new balance through new modes of doing business. [[Deglobalization]] is taking place, supply chains are turning into demand chains, large economies are focusing on their internal markets, outsourcing is followed by “backsourcing”, returning activities back to the countries and locations of their origin. The original slogan of “Think globally, act locally,” is being re-interpreted as exploiting global information and knowledge in local action, under local conditions and contexts.

While [[globalization]] refers to a restructuring of the initially distributed and localized world economy into spatially reorganized processes of production and consumption across national economies and political states on a global scale, in deglobalization, people move towards relocalization: the global experience and knowledge becoming embodied in local communities. So, the corso-ricorso of socio-economic transformation is properly captured by a triad Localization → Globalization → Relocalization.

The trend of [[deglobalization]] is turning much more significant during these years. The growth of worldwide GDP is now exceeding the overall growth of trade for the first time; foreign investment (Cross Border Capital Flows) is only 60% of their pre-crisis levels and has plunged to some 40 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Financial globalization: Retreat or reset?|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/global_capital_markets/financial_globalization|publisher=McKinsey Global Institute|date=March 2013|author1=Susan Lund |author2=Toos Daruvala |author3=Richard Dobbs }}&lt;/ref&gt;  World capital flows include loans and deposits, foreign investments, bonds and equities – all down in their cross-border segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6754e5da-76e6-11e3-a253-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2rDTwZEyH | title=Rapid fall in capital flows poses growth risk | publisher=The Financial Times |author1=Ralph Atkins |author2=Keith Fray |date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that the rate of globalization has reversed its momentum. Globalizers are still worried about 2014 being the year of irreversible decline. Improvement in the internal growth of U.S.A., EU, and Japan does not carry into external trade – these economies are starting to function as zero-sum.

The income inequality and long-term unemployment lead to re-localized experiments with ''[[Guaranteed Minimum Income]]'' (to be traced to [[Thomas Paine]]) for all citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Paine|url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/tpaine3.html|publisher=Social Security Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.academia.edu/2698139/Two_arguments_for_Basic_Income_Thomas_Paine_1737-1809_and_Thomas_Spence_1750-1814_ | title=Two arguments for Basic Income | last=Marangos | first=John | journal=History of Economic Ideas |date=January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Switzerland this guarantee would be $33,000 per year, regardless of working or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Swiss Join the Fight Against Inequality|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-16/inequality-fight-swiss-will-vote-on-minimum-income|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|author=Stephan Faris|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the name Generation Basic Income it is now subject to [[Swiss referendums, 2013|Swiss referendum]]. Unemployment then frees people to pursue their own creative talents.

With this transformation, an entirely new vocabulary is emerging in economics: in addition to deglobalization and relocalization, we also encounter glocalization (adjustment of products to local culture) and local community restoration (regional self-government and direct democracy). With relocalization, an entire new cycle of societal corso-ricorso is brought forth. Local services, local production and local agriculture, based on distributed energy generation, additive manufacturing and [[vertical farming]], are enhancing individual, community and regional autonomy through self-service, disintermediation and mass customization. Both requisite technologies and appropriate business models necessary for relocalization are already in place, forming a vital part of our daily business and life experience. New transformation is well on its way.

'''Uriel Lynn''' ({{lang-he|אוריאל לין}}, born 2 April 1935) is an [[Israel]]i lawyer, former civil servant and politician. Currently president of the Federation of the Israeli Chambers of Commerce and the Tel Aviv and Central Israel Chamber of Commerce, he served as a member of the [[Knesset]] for [[Likud]] between 1984 and 1992.

==Biography==
Lynn was born '''Uriel Asulin''' in [[Jerusalem]] during the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate era]]. His father, Yehonatan Asulin was from [[Morocco]], while his mother, Margalit Hazan, was born in Palestine. His grandfather, rabbi Ben-Zion Mordechai Hazan, was one of the founders of the [[Porat Yosef Yeshiva]] in [[Jerusalem]], and officially handed over the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of Jerusalem to the Jordanians during the Israeli surrender there in the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]]. Lynn attended the Nautical School in [[Haifa]]. He served in the [[7th Armored Brigade (Israel)|7th Armored Brigade]] of the [[Israel Defense Forces]], and fought as a reservist in the [[Suez Crisis]], [[Six-Day War]], and [[Yom Kippur War]]. and afterwards studied law at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and [[University of California, Berkeley]],&lt;ref name=P&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mk_eng.asp?mk_individual_id_t=484 Uriel Lynn: Particulars] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; earning an LLM from both universities. He was certified as a lawyer devoting two years in litigation of cases related to traffic accidents and from 1965 until 1970 worked as secretary and legal advisor at the ATA textile company.&lt;ref name=PA&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mk_eng.asp?mk_individual_id_t=484 Uriel Lynn: Public activities] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1969 and 1971 he worked as deputy general manager at Isranyl, a textile factory, which later on was transformed to Jerusalem Jersey Textile where he continued working as managing director between 1972 and 1979.&lt;ref name=PA/&gt;

In 1973 Lynn joined the [[Liberal Party (Israel)|Liberal Party]], which was part of the [[Likud]] alliance. He was placed 56th on the Likud list for the [[Israeli legislative election, 1977|1977 Knesset elections]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.idi.org.il/media/513522/%D7%9B%D7%A0%D7%A1%D7%AA%209-%20%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%93.pdf Likud list (1977)] Israel Democracy Institute&lt;/ref&gt; but failed to win a seat. In 1978, following Likud's election victory, Lynn became a civil servant after being appointed Director of the North American Investment Authority. In 1982 he became Director General of the [[Ministry of National Infrastructures, Energy and Water Resources|Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure]].&lt;ref name=PA/&gt;

In [[Israeli legislative election, 1984|1984]] Lynn was elected to the Knesset on the Likud list. He was appointed chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and of the Subcommittee for Road Safety, and also chaired the Parliamentary Inquiry Committee for Traffic Accidents.&lt;ref name=KA&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mk_eng.asp?mk_individual_id_t=484 Uriel Lynn: Knesset activities] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt;

He was re-elected in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1988|1988 elections]] after being placed 23rd on the Likud list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.idi.org.il/media/512130/%D7%9B%D7%A0%D7%A1%D7%AA%2012-%20%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%93.pdf Likud list (1988)] Israel Democracy Institute&lt;/ref&gt; In his second term in the Knesset he chaired the Constitution, Law and Justice Committee till 1992.&lt;ref name=KA/&gt;

In 1992 he decided not to run again as candidate to the Israeli Knesset, and established again his own law firm,&lt;ref name=PA/&gt; specializing in arbitration and  government.

At the end of 2002 he was elected President of the Tel Aviv &amp; Central Israel Chamber of Commerce and of the Federation of Israeli Chambers of Commerce. He also became a member of the board of the [[Eurochambres]] and was elected a member of the council of the World Chambers Federation (WCF), a worldwide organization of National Chambers of Commerce.

{{nihongo|'''''Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise'''''|ワイリー&amp;ライトのRockBoard ザッツ*パラダイス}} is a spin-off [[video game]] title in the original ''[[Mega Man (original series)|Mega Man]]'' series from [[Capcom]]. It is a [[business simulation game]] that is similar to [[board game]] [[Monopoly (game)|''Monopoly'']], in which players and the computer [[artificial intelligence|AI]] take turns going around a set of connected squares, buying up [[property]], and charging other participants [[renting|rent]] when they land on those spaces.

''Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard'' was released on January 15, 1993 for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] only in [[Japan]], though an unreleased English translation and a [[Game Boy]] version may have been in development. Critical reception for the game from Western gaming websites has been decidedly poor.

==Gameplay==
''Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise'' is a [[business simulation game]] in which the player chooses among several characters in the [[Mega Man (original series)|original ''Mega Man'' series]] and competes with other players or the computer AI in purchasing spaces of [[property]]. The characters include [[Roll (Mega Man)|Roll]], [[Dr. Light (Mega Man)|Dr. Light]], [[Doctor Wily|Dr. Wily]], [[Dr. Cossack]], and [[Kalinka Cossack|Kalinka]].&lt;ref name="bigref"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Rockman Big Reference Book | publisher=[[Capcom]] | date=Spring 1993 | title=''Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That’s Paradise'' | language=Japanese | pages=78–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fletcher"&gt;{{cite web | author=Fletcher, JC | date=November 29, 2007 | title=Virtually Overlooked: ''Wily &amp; Right no Rockboard: That's Paradise'' | url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/11/29/virtually-overlooked-wily-and-right-no-rockboard-thats-paradise/ | publisher=[[Joystiq]] | accessdate=February 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each participant is given a turn, moving a certain number of spaces on the board. If they land on a property square, they are given the option to buy it with a certain about of Zenny (the game's currency).&lt;ref name="fletcher"/&gt; They can then charge other characters [[Renting|rent]] when they land on that building. However, other characters can also buy part of the same square, allowing each owner to charge a smaller amount of rent. Some squares contain cards that cause various effects on the board such as raising property prices or the development level of a building.&lt;ref name="bigref"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fletcher"/&gt; The game's winning conditions can vary depending on the set rules. The winner may be the character with the most owned spaces, the most remaining Zenny, or the most developments.&lt;ref name="fletcher"/&gt;

==Development==
''Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise'' was developed by [[Capcom]] during a time when the ''Mega Man'' franchise was at its height of its popularity.&lt;ref name="gamespot"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Nutt, Christian  |author2=Speer, Justin  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=The History of ''Mega Man'' | url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/6076983/p-26.html | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate=June 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Series artist [[Keiji Inafune]] had very little involvement in the development of ''Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise'', simply designing the cover art and the new character [[List of Mega Man characters#Reggae|Reggae]].&lt;ref name="r20"/&gt; When developing the game, the team wanted to include as many bosses from previous titles in the series as possible.&lt;ref name="club"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Club Capcom | publisher=[[Capcom]] | date=Spring 1993 | title=''Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That’s Paradise'': A Development Team Inside Story | language=Japanese | page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they ultimately decided to leave room for an original character that fans could associate with the new game. When discussing a bird character labeled {{nihongo|''fukou no tori''|フコウノトリ||lit. "bird of misfortune"}}, one of the team members misread it as {{nihongo|''kounotori''|コウノトリ||lit. "[[Oriental stork]]"}}, resulting in Reggae's resemblance to the species.&lt;ref name="club"/&gt;

The January 1993 issue of the [[Mexico|Mexican]] magazine ''[[Club Nintendo]]'' featured ''Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard'' as part of a preview article for the 1993 [[Consumer Electronics Show]]. Titling the game as "Mega Board", the article even had a screenshot featuring [[English language|English]] text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Club Nintendo]] | publisher=[[Nintendo]] | page=23 | title=''Mega Board'' | author=Ham, Richard | language=Spanish | date=January 1993 | volume=2 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unreleased [[Game Boy]] version was apparently in the works by the Japanese company Dual, which listed the game on the credits page of its official website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | script-title=ja:開発業歴 |trans-title=Development History | url=http://www.dual-inc.co.jp/kaihatu.html  | publisher=Dual | language=Japanese | accessdate=January 30, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070726100055/http://www.dual-inc.co.jp/kaihatu.html |archivedate = July 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hitoshi Sakimoto]] was responsible for the audio in this version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Hitoshi Sakimoto - Official English Website (Discography) | url=http://sakimoto.cocoebiz.com/discography/index.shtml | publisher=[[Hitoshi Sakimoto]] | accessdate=January 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{Globalize/USA|section|date=November 2018}}
Critical reception for ''Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise'' outside Japan has been poor. [[GameSpot]] contributors Christian Nutt and Justin Speer found the relatively obscure game to be of no particular interest to anyone other than ''Mega Man'' fans.&lt;ref name="gamespot"/&gt; Jeremy Parish of [[1UP.com]] summated, "An oddity of the Famicom era, this import title was a simple "[[The Game of Life|''Game of Life'']]"-style board game with a ''Mega Man'' motif -- novel, but hardly essential."&lt;ref name="1up"&gt;{{cite web | author=Parish, Jeremy | date=May 10, 2007 | title=The ''Mega Man'' Series Roundup | url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&amp;cId=3159344 | publisher=[[1UP.com]] | accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GamesRadar]] editor Brett Elston called it a "probably better-off-lost excursion into Mega-mediocrity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Elston, Brett | date=June 30, 2008 | title=The ultimate ''Mega Man'' retrospective | url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/the-ultimate-mega-man-retrospective/a-2008062794557758069/p-3 | publisher=[[GamesRadar]] | accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all views of the game have been negative. JC Fletcher of [[Joystiq]] expressed desire for the game's release on the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service. He opined that it is "actually nowhere near as terrible as a ''Mega Man'' board game ''should'' be" and that its various effects and winning conditions grant it a much faster pace than [[Monopoly (game)|''Monopoly'']].&lt;ref name="fletcher"/&gt;

'''Workmanship''' is a human attribute relating to knowledge and skill at performing a task. The type of work may include the creation of [[handcrafts]], [[art]], [[writing]], [[machinery]] and other products.  Workmanship is also a [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] imparted to a product.

==Workmanship in society==
Workmanship is considered to have been a valued human attribute even in prehistoric times.  In the opinion of the economist and sociologist [[Thorstein Veblen]], the sense of workmanship is probably the single most important attribute governing the material well being of a people, with only the parental instinct coming a close second.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Veblen|1914|loc= Chpt 1: Introduction |quote = "Chief among those instinctive dispositions that conduce directly to the material well-being of the race, and therefore to its biological success, is perhaps the instinctive bias here spoken of as the sense of workmanship." }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have however been periods in history where workmanship was looked down on; for example in [[Classical Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]], where it had become associated with slavery. This was not always the case - back in the [[Archaic Greece|archaic period]], Greeks had valued workmanship, celebrating it in [[Homeric hymns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sennett|209|loc= pp. 22-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the western world, a return to a more positive attitude towards work emerged with the rise of Christianity.&lt;ref name="Rasmussen 2008 loc= Chpt 2: Work Curse or Blessing"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rasmussen|2008|loc= Chpt 2: Work Curse or Blessing }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, Veblen considers that the social value of workmanship reached its peak with the "Era of handicraft". The era began as workmanship flourished with the relative peace and security of property rights that Europe had achieved by the [[Late middle ages]]. The era ended as machine driven processes began to displace the need for workmanship after the [[Industrial revolution]].  Workmanship was such a central concept during the handicraft era, that according to Veblen, even key theological questions about God's intentions for humanity were re-framed from "What has God ordained?"  to "What has God wrought?".&lt;ref name="Veblen 1914 loc= Chpt 6: The era of handicraft"&gt;{{Harvnb|Veblen|1914|loc= Chpt 6: The era of handicraft }}&lt;/ref&gt;    The high value placed on workmanship could sometimes be an oppressive force for certain individuals - for example, one explanation for the origin of the English phrase [[sent to Coventry]] is that it was born from the practice where London [[guild]] members expelled due to poor workmanship were forced to move to Coventry, which used to be a guild free town.  But workmanship was still widely appreciated by the [[common people]] themselves.&lt;ref name="Veblen 1914 loc= Chpt 6: The era of handicraft"/&gt; For example,  when workers accustomed to practicing high standards of workmanship were first recruited to work on production lines in factories, it would be common for them to walk out, as the new roles were relatively monotonous, giving them little scope to use their skills.  After [[Henry Ford]] introduced the first [[Assembly line]] in 1913, he could need to recruit about ten men to find one willing to stay in the job. Over time, and with Ford offering high rates of pay,  the aversion of labor to the new ways of working was reduced.&lt;ref name = "soulCraft"&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

Workmanship began to receive considerable attention from scholars once its place in society came under threat by the rise of industrialization. The [[Arts and Crafts movement]] arose in the late 19th and early 20th century, as workmanship began to be displaced by developments like greater emphases on process, machine work, and the separation of design and planning skills from the actual execution of work.  Scholars involved in founding the movement, like [[William Morris]], [[John Ruskin]] and [[Charles Eliot Norton]], argued that the opportunity to engage in workmanship used to be a great source of fulfillment for the working class.&lt;ref name="Veblen 1914 loc= Chpt 6: The era of handicraft"/&gt;   From a historical perspective however, the arts and crafts movement has been seen as a palliative, which unintentionally reduced resistance to the displacement of workmanship.&lt;ref name = "soulCraft"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson Lear 1994 loc= Chpt 2: The figure of the artisan: arts and crafts ideology"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jackson Lear|1994|loc= Chpt 2: The figure of the artisan: arts and crafts ideology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a book written on the nature of workmanship, [[David Pye (furniture)|David Pye]] writes that the displacement of workmanship has continued into the late 20th century. He writes that since World War II especially, there has been "an enormous intensification of interest in design", at the expense of workmanship. The trend started in the 19th century has continued, with Industrial processes increasingly designed to minimize the skill needed for workers to produce quality products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pye|1968|loc= Chpt 1: Design proposes: Workmanship disposes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 21st century scholars such as [[Matthew Crawford]] have argued that office and other white collar work is now being displaced by similar technological developments to  the ones that caused large numbers of manual workers to be made redundant from the late 19th to early 20th century. Even when the jobs remain, the cognitive aspects of the jobs taken away from the workers, due to knowledge being centralized.  He calls for a revaluing of workmanship, saying that certain manual roles like mechanics, plumbers and carpenters have been resistant to further automation, and are among the most likely to continue offering the worker the chance for independent thought.&lt;ref name = "soulCraft"/&gt; Writers like [[Alain de Botton]] and [[Jane McGonigal]] have argued that the world of work needs to be reformed to make it more fulfilling and less stressful. In particular, workers need to be able to make a deeply felt imaginative connection between their own efforts and the end product.  McGonigal argues that computer games can be a source of ideas for doing this; she says the primary reason for [[World of Warcraft]] being so popular is the sense of "blissful productivity" that its players enjoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Botton|2010| }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McGonigal|2011|loc= Chpt 3: More satisfying work}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workmanship and craftsmanship===
[[File:Rubens - Vulcano forjando los rayos de Júpiter.jpg|thumb| [[Peter Paul Rubens|Ruben's]] 1536  rendition of [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], the  Roman counterpart of [[Hephaestus]], the Greek God of Craftsmen.]]    
Workmanship and Craftsmanship are sometimes considered synonyms, but many draw a distinction between the two terms, or at least consider craftsmanship to mean "workmanship of the better sort".&lt;ref name="Pye 1968 loc= Chpt 2: The workmanship of risk and the workmanship of certainty"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pye|1968|loc= Chpt 2: The workmanship of risk and the workmanship of certainty }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those who do consider  workmanship and craftsmanship to be different, the word "workmanlike" is sometimes even used as a pejorative, to suggest for example that while an author might understand the basics of their craft, they lack flair. David Pye has written that no one can definitively state where workmanship ends and craftsmanship begins.&lt;ref name="Pye 1968 loc= Chpt 2: The workmanship of risk and the workmanship of certainty"/&gt;

{{cquote|Sing clear-voiced Muse, of Hephaestus famed for skill. With bright-eyed Athena he taught me glorious crafts throughout the world - men who before used to dwell in caves in the mountains like wild beasts. But now that they have learned craftsmanship through Hephaestus famous for his art they live a peaceful life in own houses the whole year round.}}
- an extract from a Homeric hymn celebrating craftsmanship.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Sennett (2009) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages, smiths and especially armor smiths developed unique symbols of workmanship&lt;ref&gt;Ffoulkes, John. The Armourer and His Craft: From the XIth to the XVIth Century. Dover, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish the quality of their work. These became some of the most unusual signs of workmanship, comparable to the ''mon'' family crests of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Matsuya Piece-Goods Store. Japanese Design Motifs: 4,260 Illustrations of Japanese Crests. Dover, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workmanship and aversion to labor===
It has often been held in older economic writings that people are always adverse to labor and can only be motivated to work by threats or tangible rewards such as money. While Christianity has generally been positive about workmanship, certain Bible passages such as Genesis 3:17 ("...Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life.") have contributed to the view that labor is a necessary evil, part of the punishment for [[original sin]],&lt;ref name="Rasmussen 2008 loc= Chpt 2: Work Curse or Blessing"/&gt; but work existed before original sin and the [[fall of man]] in Genesis 2:15 ("Yahweh God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.") The view that work is a punishment takes Genesis 3:17 out of context. God's curse wasn't work, but that work would inherently be harder. Veblen and others agree with this view, saying that work can be inherently joyful and satisfying in its own right. Veblen acknowledges that humans have an innate tendency towards idleness, but asserts that they also have a countervailing tendency to value work for its own sake, as is demonstrated by the vast amount of work that is undertaken without obvious external pressure. As evidence for the widely shared instinct towards workmanship, Veblen also notes the near universal tendency for humans to approve of others' good work. Psychologist Pernille Rasmussen has written that the tendency to value work can become so strong that it stops being a positive source of motivation, contributing instead to some people losing balance and becoming workaholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Electronics manufacturing==
The reliability of electronic devices is greatly affected by the quality of the workmanship. Therefore, the [[electronics manufacturing]] industry has developed several [[voluntary consensus standards]] to provide guidance on how products should be designed, built, inspected, and tested.&lt;ref&gt;L-3 Communications, [http://www.l-3com.com/csw/docs/wsm/ws-000.doc WS-000: Workmanship Standards Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Counseling System (WCS)''', otherwise called the '''Religious Counseling Standard''', is a classification model developed for use mostly in religious counseling. It is a model commonly used for counseling in [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[South America]] and it works on three assumptions:

# That someone is concerned or confused about someone or there is an issue that needs to be resolved, usually urgently.
# That the issue involved is such that it cannot be resolved through the person's own efforts.
# That the inability to resolve the issue without outside assistance necessitates a recourse to a "higher being" who possesses superior wisdom. This higher being is expected to function through earthly agents.

This process involves the engagement of people with [[supernatural]] gifts such as [[prophet]]s (in whatever [[religion]]) and  faith-based counselors to help resolve the problem. The core of the model is that the person with the problem commits his or her case into the hands of the agent of a [[supernatural being]] who is expected to proffer solutions to the problem.

Owing to the involvement of some supernatural being, the issues that can be resolved are unlimited, which makes categorization difficult. Categorization is based, therefore, on the personalities involved in the resolution process, rather than on the problems that need to be solved.

==Classifications==
Under the WCS system, counseling is carried out in three categories:
*Love/Personal relationships
*Business relationships
*Other relationships
  
If someone needs counseling in the area of [[personal relationship]], he or she could seek help from the agents regarding a spouse, boyfriend/girlfriend or [[Engagement|fiancée]]. He or she could ask such questions as "Is my husband faithful?" "Is this person the right person for me to marry?" and "If I marry this person, will the [[marriage]] last?" The online edition requires that you fill out a form. Information you need to supply includes your first name, the full name of the person you need information about, his or her mother's name and your question. When you send in your request, it is sent to at least two counselors. The agency using the WCS service will quickly prepare a composite report (from the two responses) which is sent back to you. The service comes at a fee since the WCS model has a [[copyright]] tied to it. An average response, which is usually more comprehensive than a typical on-line request, can take up to three hours before the reply is available. The response in a typical WCS service may have between 75 and 93 per cent accuracy in its [[prediction]]s regarding the issue to be resolved.

Similar processes apply to the "business" and "other"  categories. For business classification, the question might be something like "I want to embark on this type of [[business]]. Will I succeed?" "Somebody wants to be my partner. Can this person be trusted?" "I want to obtain a [[loan]] from the bank. Will the loan bring profits?" "Will repayment of the loan be difficult?"  The "other relationships" category takes care of areas not covered by personal and business relationships.
