      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4580">'''Acid-neutralizing capacity''' or '''ANC''' in short is a measure for the overall buffering capacity against [[acid]]ification for a solution, e.g.  [[surface water]] or soil water.

ANC is defined as the difference between cations of strong bases and anions of strong acids (see below), or dynamically as the amount of acid needed to change the pH value from the sample's value to a chosen different value. &lt;ref&gt;Stumm, W. &amp; J. J. Morgan. 1981. Aquatic chemistry. New York: Wiley. {{ISBN|0-471-04831-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts [[alkalinity]] are nowadays often used as a synonym to positive ANC and similarly acidity is often used to mean negative ANC. Alkalinity and acidity however also have definitions based on an experimental setup (titration).

ANC is often used in models to calculate acidification levels from [[acid rain]] [[pollution]] in different geographical areas, and as a basis for calculating [[critical loads]] for forest soils and surface waters. 

[[Image:PH-ANCrelation.jpg|350px|right|Diagram showing sample pH-ANC relationships for natural waters]]
The relation between pH and ANC in natural waters depends on three conditions: Carbon dioxide, organic acids and aluminium solubility. The amount of dissolved carbon dioxide is usually higher than would be the case if there was an equilibrium with the carbon dioxide pressure in the atmosphere. This is due to biological activity: Decomposition of organic material releases carbon dioxide and thus increases the amount of dissolved carbon dioxide. An increase in carbon dioxide decreases pH but has no effect on ANC. Organic acids, often expressed as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), also decrease pH and have no effect on ANC. Soil water in the upper layers usually have higher organic content than the lower soil layers. Surface waters with high DOC are typically found in areas where there is a lot of peat and bogs in the catchment. Aluminium solubility is a bit tricky and there are several curve fit variants used in modelling, one of the more common being

:&lt;math chem&gt;[\ce{Al^{3+}}] = k_G[\ce H^+]^3&lt;/math&gt;

In the illustration to the right, the relation between pH and ANC is shown for four different solutions. In the blue line the solution has 1 mg/l DOC, a dissolved amount of carbon dioxide that is equivalent to a solution being in equilibrium with an atmosphere with twice the carbon dioxide pressure of our atmosphere. For the other lines, all three parameters except one is the same as for the blue line. Thus the orange line is a solution loaded with organic acids, having a DOC of 80 mg/l (typically very brown lake water or water in the top soil layer in a forest soil). The red line has a high amount of dissolved carbon dioxide (pCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=20 times ambient), a level that is not uncommon in ground water. Finally the black dotted line is a water with a lower aluminium solubility.

The reason why ANC is often defined as the difference between cations of strong bases and anions of strong acids is that ANC is derived from a charge balance: If we for simplicity consider a solution with only a few species and use the fact that a water solution is electrically neutral we get

:&lt;chem&gt;{[H^+]}+{2[Ca^{2+}]} + {[Na^+]} +{3[Al^{3+}]} + {2[Al(OH)^{2+}]} + {[Al(OH)_2^+]}\ =\ {[OH^-]} + {[Cl^-]} + {2[CO_3^{2-}]} +{[HCO_3^-]} + {[R^-]}&lt;/chem&gt;

where R&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; denote an anion of an organic acid. ANC is then defined by collecting all species controlled by equilibrium (i.e. species related to weak acids and weak bases) on one side and species not controlled by equilibrium (i.e. species related to strong acids and strong bases) on the other side. Thus, with the species above we get

:&lt;chem&gt;ANC\ =\ +{2[Ca^{2+}]} + {[Na^+]}\ -\ {[Cl^-]}&lt;/chem&gt;

or

:&lt;chem&gt;ANC\ =\ {[OH^-]}+{2[CO_3^{2-}]} + {[HCO_3^-]} + {[R^-]}\ -\ {[H^+]-3[Al^{3+}]}\ -\ {2[Al(OH)^{2+}]}\ -\ {[Al(OH)_2^+]}&lt;/chem&gt;

==Note== 
# that a change in DOC or CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (or for that matter Aluminium solubility, but Aluminium solubility is not something that is easily controlled) does NOT have any effect on ANC. 
# that once a pH-ANC relation for has been established for a lake the pH-ANC relation can be used to easily calculate the amount of limestone needed to raise lake pH to e.g. 5.5
# not all acid lakes are acid due to human influence since high DOC gives low pH. 
# that the concentrations are multiplied with the charge of the species, hence the unit mol charge per liter

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6929">The '''Aconcagua mummy''' is an Incan ''[[capacocha]]'' mummy of a seven-year-old boy, dated to around 500 [[Before Present|BP]].{{sfn|Gómez-Carballa|Catelli|2015}} The mummy is well-preserved, due to the extreme cold and dry conditions of its high altitude burial location.{{sfn|Wade|2015}} The frozen mummy was discovered by hikers in 1985 at {{convert|5300|m|abbr = on}} on [[Aconcagua]] in [[Mendoza, Argentina]].{{sfn|Gómez-Carballa|Catelli|2015}}{{sfn|Wade|2015}}

==Discovery==
The Aconcagua mummy was buried inside a semicircular stone structure{{sfn|Ceruti|2015}} and found covered in vomit, red pigment, and fecal remains.{{sfn|Faux|2012}} The body was wrapped in textiles in a style derived from central coastal Peru.{{sfn|Cassman|2007|p=144}} Six statuettes were also found buried with the body.{{sfn|Gómez-Carballa|Catelli|2015}}

An analysis shows that the boy's diet consisted primarily of maize, quinoa, capsicum, potatoes, and terrestrial meat. A year and a half before his death, his diet became more marine-based.{{sfn|Faux|2012}} The presence of [[achiote]] was also found inside his stomach and colon.{{sfn|Cassman|2007|p=144}}

==Archaeogenetics==
In 2015, DNA was extracted from a {{convert|350|mg|abbr = on}} sample from one of his lungs.{{sfn|Gómez-Carballa|Catelli|2015}} His mtDNA lineage belongs to a subgroup of [[Haplogroup C (mtDNA)|Haplogroup C1b]], the previously unidentified C1bi (''i'' for Inca).{{sfn|Gómez-Carballa|Catelli|2015}} His mtDNA lineage contains 10 distinct mutations from C1b.{{sfn|Gómez-Carballa|Catelli|2015}} The researchers determined that Haplogroup C1bi likely arose around 14,300 years ago.{{sfn|Gómez-Carballa|Catelli|2015}} An individual from the [[Wari Empire]] was found to be a match for this previously unidentified haplogroup.{{sfn|Gómez-Carballa|Catelli|2015}}{{sfn|Wade|2015}} In 2018, researchers sequenced the [[genome]] of the Aconcagua mummy from a {{convert|100|mg|abbr = on}} sample from one of his lungs.{{sfn|Moreno-Mayar|Vinner|de Barros Damgaard|de la Fuente|2018|p=12 (Supplementary)}} His Y-DNA lineage belongs to [[Haplogroup Q-M3]].{{sfn|Salas|Catelli|Pardo-Seco|Gómez-Carballa|2018}} His specific Y-DNA haplogroup is closest matched by the Choppca people from [[Huancavelica]], a [[Quechua people|Quechua speaking population]], and clusters closer to modern Quechua speaking peoples than [[Aymara people|Aymara speaking peoples]].{{sfn|Salas|Catelli|Pardo-Seco|Gómez-Carballa|2018}} Overall, the genome of the Aconcagua mummy clusters with modern Andean populations.{{sfn|Moreno-Mayar|Vinner|de Barros Damgaard|de la Fuente|2018|p=21 (Supplementary)}}

The bar indicates 1 cm. Electrophoresis performed overnight at less than 10&amp;nbsp;V/cm. The analysis was performed early in the 1970s at the Protein Laboratory]]

'''Affinity electrophoresis''' is a general name for many analytical methods used in [[biochemistry]] and [[biotechnology]]. Both qualitative and quantitative information may be obtained through affinity electrophoresis. The methods include the so-called [[electrophoretic mobility shift assay]], charge shift electrophoresis and affinity [[capillary electrophoresis]]. The methods are based on changes in the [[electrophoresis|electrophoretic]] pattern of molecules (mainly [[macromolecules]]) through biospecific interaction or [[complex formation]]. The interaction or binding of a molecule, charged or uncharged, will normally change the electrophoretic properties of a molecule. Membrane proteins may be identified by a shift in mobility induced by a charged [[detergent]]. [[Nucleic acid]]s or nucleic acid fragments may be characterized by their affinity to other molecules. The methods have been used for estimation of [[binding constant]]s, as for instance in [[lectin]] affinity electrophoresis or characterization of molecules with specific features like [[glycan]] content or [[ligand]] binding. For enzymes and other ligand-binding proteins, one-dimensional electrophoresis similar to counter electrophoresis or to [[immunoelectrophoresis|"rocket immunoelectrophoresis"]], affinity electrophoresis may be used as an alternative quantification of the protein. Some of the methods are similar to [[affinity chromatography]] by use of immobilized [[ligands]].

== Types and methods ==
Currently, there is ongoing research in developing new ways of utilizing the knowledge already associated with affinity electrophoresis to improve its functionality and speed, as well as attempts to improve already established methods and tailor them towards performing specific tasks.

=== Agarose gel electrophoresis ===
[[File:Figure displaying gel electrophoresis.png|thumb|an example of an agarose gel after electrophoresis]]
A type of electrophoretic mobility shift assay (AMSA), agarose gel electrophoresis is used to separate protein-bound amino acid complexes from free amino acids. Using a low voltage (~10&amp;nbsp;V/cm) to minimize the risk for heat damage, electricity is run across an agarose gel.

=== Rapid agarose gel electrophoresis ===
This technique utilizes a high voltage ({{nowrap|≥ 20 V/cm}}) with a 0.5× Tris-borate buffer run across an agarose gel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Rapid agarose gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay for quantitating protein: RNA interactions
|vauthors=Ream JA, Lewis LK, Lewis KA|journal=Analytical Biochemistry|volume=511|date=October 2016|pp=36–41|doi=10.1016/j.ab.2016.07.027|pmid=27495142|pmc=5002362}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method differs from the traditional agarose gel electrophoresis by utilizing a higher voltage to facilitate a shorter run time as well as yield a higher band resolution. Other factors included in developing the technique of rapid agarose gel electrophoresis are gel thickness, and the percentage of agarose within the gel.

=== Boronate affinity electrophoresis ===
Boronate affinity electrophoresis utilizes boronic acid infused acrylimide gels to purify NAD-RNA. This purification allows for researchers to easily measure the kinetic activity of NAD-RNA decapping enzymes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Boronate affinity electrophoresis for the purification and analysis of cofactor-modified RNA|journal=Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Heidelberg University, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Affinity capillary electrophoresis ===
Affinity capillary electrophoresis utilizes a formulary approach in accordance with the theory of electromigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Affinity capillary electrophoresis: the theory of electromigration|vauthors=Dubský P, Dvořák M, Ansorge M|journal=Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry|volume=408|issue=30|pp=8623–8641|pmid=27558099|doi=10.1007/s00216-016-9799-y|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method utilizes the inter-molecular interactions found in a free solution. "Affinity probes" consisting of fluorophore-labeled molecules that will bind to target molecules are mixed with the sample being tested. This mixture and its subsequent complexes are then separated through capillary electrophoresis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aizpurua-Olaizola|first=Oier|last2=Sastre Torano|first2=Javier|last3=Pukin|first3=Aliaksei|last4=Fu|first4=Ou|last5=Boons|first5=Geert Jan|last6=de Jong|first6=Gerhardus J.|last7=Pieters|first7=Roland J.|title=Affinity capillary electrophoresis for the assessment of binding affinity of carbohydrate-based cholera toxin inhibitors|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/elps.201700207/abstract|journal=Electrophoresis|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1002/elps.201700207|issn=1522-2683}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle behind this type of electrophoresis is the mobility of the target molecules being altered by inter-molecular interactions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kinoshita|first=Eiji|last2=Kinoshita-Kikuta|first2=Emiko|last3=Koike|first3=Tohru|date=2015-03-18|title=The Cutting Edge of Affinity Electrophoresis Technology|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2227-7382/3/1/42|journal=Proteomes|volume=3|issue=1|pages=42–55|doi=10.3390/proteomes3010042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Affinity-trap polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ===
Affinity-trap polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) has become one of the most popular methods of protein separation. This is not only due to its separation qualities, but also because it can be used in conjunction with a variety of other analytic methods, such as mass spectrometry, and western blotting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This method utilizes a two-step approach. First, a protein sample is run through a polyacrylamide gel using electrophoresis. Then, the sample is transferred to a different polyacrylamide gel (the affinity-trap gel) where affinity probes are immobilized. The proteins that do not have affinity for the affinity probes pass through the affinity-trap gel, and proteins with affinity for the probes will be "trapped" by the immobile affinity probes. These trapped proteins are then visualized and identified using mass spectrometry after in-gel digestion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Phosphate affinity electrophoresis ===
Phosphate affinity electrophoresis utilizes an affinity probe which consists of a molecule that binds specifically to divalent phosphate ions in neutral aqueous solution, known as a "Phos-Tag". This methods also utilizes a separation gel made of an acrylamide-pendent Phos-Tag monomer that is copolymerized. Phosphorylated proteins migrate slowly in the gel compared to non-phosphorylated proteins. This technique gives the researcher the ability to observe the differences in the phosphorylation states of any given protein.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''alphabet effect''' is a group of hypotheses in [[communication theory]] arguing that [[Phonetics|phonetic]] [[writing]], and [[Alphabet|alphabetic scripts]] in particular, have served to promote and encourage the cognitive skills of [[abstraction]], analysis, coding, decoding, and classification. Promoters of these hypotheses are associated with the [[Toronto School of Communication]], such as [[Marshall McLuhan]], [[Harold Innis]], [[Walter Ong]] and more recently [[Robert K. Logan]]; the term "alphabet effect" comes from Logan's 1986 work (see the bibliography below which references the 2004 second edition).

==Overview==

The theory claims that a greater level of abstraction is required due to the greater economy of [[symbol]]s in alphabetic systems; and this abstraction and the analytic skills needed to interpret phonemic symbols in turn has contributed to the cognitive development of its users. Proponents of this theory hold that the development of phonetic writing and the alphabet in particular (as distinct from other types of writing systems) has made a significant impact on [[Western culture|Western]] thinking and development precisely because it introduced a new level of abstraction, analysis, coding, decoding and classification. McLuhan and Logan (1977) while not suggesting a direct causal connection nevertheless suggest that, as a result of these skills, the use of the alphabet created an environment conducive to the development of [[Codification (law)|codified law]], [[monotheism]], abstract [[science]], [[deductive logic]], objective [[history]], and [[individualism]]. According to Logan, "All of these innovations, including the alphabet, arose within the very narrow geographic zone between the [[Tigris-Euphrates]] river system and the [[Aegean Sea]], and within the very narrow time frame between 2000 B.C. and 500 B.C." (Logan 2004). The emergence of codified law in [[Sumer]] as exemplified by the Hammurabic code actually coincided with the reform of the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] [[Syllabary|syllabic]] system and is not directly influenced by the alphabet per se but rather by a phonetic writing system consisting of only sixty signs. Also it has to be pointed out that there was a robust scientific tradition in [[China]] but that science as practised in ancient China was not abstract but concrete and practical. In fact the impetus for formulating the Alphabet Effect was to explain why abstract science began in the West and not China despite the long list of [[invention]]s and [[technology]] that first appeared in China as documented by [[Joseph Needham]] in his book ''The Grand Titration'' (Needham 1969). The Alphabet Effect provides an alternative explanation to what is known as [[Needham's Grand Question]], namely why China had been overshot by the West in science and technology, despite its earlier successes.

Another impact of alphabetic writing was that it led to the invention of [[zero]], the [[Positional notation|place number system]], [[negative number]]s, and [[algebra]] by [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] [[mathematician]]s in India 2000 years ago (Logan 2004). These ideas were picked up by [[Arab]] mathematicians and scientists and eventually made their way to Europe 1400 years later.

Prior to the written word there was a monopoly of knowledge by priests. (Innes: 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;4) This was because literacy was seen to be very time consuming. Therefore, all literacy was left in the hands of priests. With the priests monopolizing the content of religious texts there would be little or no dissention among the public. Thus the introduction of the alphabet substantially limited the power of the priests and religious texts were now open to society for questioning.

A social ramification of the introduction of the alphabet was the creation of social distinctions within society. Scholar Andrew Robinson supports this point by stating that those who are illiterate within society are seen as being deficient and ‘backward’ (Robinson: 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;215). Consequently, the development of the alphabet allowed for distinctions to be formed within society between the literate upper class and the illiterate lower class.

The development of the alphabet and hence the written word has also affected the impact of emotion. This point is also shared by Marshall McLuhan who believes that to translate a beautiful picture into words would be to deprive it of correctly articulating its best qualities (McLuhan: 1964, p.&amp;nbsp;83). Therefore, the written word has deprived both images and beautiful objects of the correct level of emotion with which to express their exact appearance.

The fact that the alphabet introduced the idea that a person’s writing could live on long after they died was another social ramification of the alphabet. This argument is also shared by Andrew Robinson. Robinson believes that the need for ‘immortality’ has always been of extreme importance for many authors. (Robinson: 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;83) As a result, the development of the written word allowed for the ‘immortality’ of authors and their written works.

==Criticism of the theory as ethnocentric==
Grosswiler (2004) notes that many scholars (including former adherents of the theory such as Goody) have pointed out that the theory is based on a particular Hellenocentric account of science, which neglects how different cultures have had hegemony scientifically irrespective of writing system

==Criticism of the theory's account of Chinese writing==
Several scholars have pointed out that the [[logogram|logographic]] account of Chinese writing is obsolete and incorrect. [[John DeFrancis]] suggests the use of the term semasiographic rather than logographic, because the idea of Chinese characters as pictorial in nature is only partially true. From Dominic Yu's account: 
:Take, for example, the character 他, representing the third person singular pronoun "tā". The left hand component, the "person" radical, indicates that this character vaguely has something to do with a person or people. I say "vaguely" because this is a very common radical is also used in characters such as 份, 假, and 做, meaning, "portion," "fake," and "to do," respectively. The right side is a phonetic component indicating that (at some earlier stage of Chinese), this character rhymed with 也, now pronounced "yě." Nothing in this character indicates the idea of "third person singular pronoun." From this example, we can see that Chinese characters mainly represent sounds, and only represent ideas in a rather insignificant way. Thus, Logan's claim that Chinese characters represent the "idea of a word" is baseless.

==Criticism of the theory from alternate paths to alphabetic script==
It has been suggested (by e.g. Grosswiler 2004) that [[Denise Schmandt-Besserat|Schmandt-Besserat's]] research into the origin of writing from three-dimensional tokens gives an alternative to the progressivist account of the Alphabet Effect theory. Grosswiler suggests that it is the potential for recording memory, not any one system of it, that propels a culture towards scientific thought.

[[File:PetőAndrás Stollár4.jpg|alt=Plaque at a former residence|thumb|Plaque at a former residence]]
'''András Pető''' (11 September 1893 in [[Szombathely]], [[Hungary]] &amp;ndash; 11 September 1967 in [[Budapest]], Hungary) was a practitioner of [[Physiotherapy|physical rehabilitation]] whose work provided the foundation for [[conductive education]].

==Early life and career==
András Pető was born in 1893 in Szombathely, Hungary, as an elder of three sons. His father fell ill in 1907 with [[Parkinson's disease]], which compelled András to support the family financially. He worked as a tutor and a newspaper editor.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

After graduation, he studied from 1911 in Vienna. Originally he to be a journalist, but in Vienna decided to study medicine. During his studies he met [[Jacob L. Moreno]], doctor, playwright and psychotherapist, with whom he formed a lifelong friendship - and also came into contact with the various psychological schools of Vienna centered around [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Alfred Adler|Adler]] and [[Viktor Frankl|Frankl]].

Between 1930 and 1938, Pető published many literary, philosophical and medical works. He was the editor-in-chief of the periodical ''Biologische Heilkunst'' (''Biological Healing'') and was better known as a journalist than a physician.

The [[Anchschluss|forced incorporation]] of [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] into [[Nazi Germany]] March 1938 made life difficult and dangerous for Jews, so he moved to Paris where he stayed briefly and worked as a journalist, then he returned to Hungary. Very little is known about Peto's life during the time of World War II but it is assumed that he was in hiding in Budapest during the German occupation. His mother was killed in Auschwitz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conductive-world.info/2013/12/a-story-from-history.html "A story from history"], 2013, Andrew Sutton&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institute==
His institute, the [[National Institute of Motor Therapy]], officially opened in 1952. Although nominally under the Ministry of Health, instead of following the medical model of providing therapies, Pető created a framework for an educational model, in which children with disabilities could have an education that met their particular physical and intellectual needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orvostortenet.hu/tankonyvek/tk-05/pdf/2.15/2007_200_201_forrai_judit_history_of.pdf "History of a Special Healing Method..."], Judit Forrai, MD, PhD, Lecturer Semmelweis University&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, in the early 1960s his institute moved into the Ministry of Education.

==Conductive education==
Conductive education (CE) entered the wider public consciousness in the mid-1980s, as a result of two television documentaries —"Standing Up For Joe" (1986), and "To Hungary with Love" (1987).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/oct/24/guardianobituaries.schools "Maria Hari"], 2001 obituary at The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, CE has gained more and more acceptance in the education of children with motor disorders. While developed first for children who had [[cerebral palsy]] or brain injury, it has also been used with adults with [[Parkinson's disease]], [[multiple sclerosis]] and after-[[stroke]] conditions.

'''Ant–fungus mutualism''' is a [[symbiosis]] seen in certain [[ant]] and [[fungus|fungal]] species, in which ants actively cultivate fungus much like humans farm [[agriculture|crop]]s as a food source. In some species, the ants and fungi are dependent on each other for survival. The [[leafcutter ant]] is a well-known example of this symbiosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Types==
There are five main types of agriculture that fungus-growing ants practice:&lt;ref name="Mehdiabdi and Schultz 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mehdiabadi, N. J.  |author2=T. R. Schultz|year=2009|title=Natural history and phylogeny of the fungus-farming ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmicinae: Attini)|journal=Myrmecological News|volume=13|pages=37–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; lower, [[coral fungi]], [[yeast]], generalized higher, and leafcutter agricultural systems. Lower agriculture is the most primitive system and is currently practiced by 80 species in 10 genera.&lt;ref name="Schultz and Brady 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.0711024105|author1=Schultz, T.

|pmid=15562688|doi=10.1554/03-203
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Schultz and Brady 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Yeast agriculture is practiced by 18 species of ''[[Cyphomyrmex]] rimosus''. The ''C. rimosus'' group is hypothesized to have evolved growing fungus in a yeast form between 5 and 25 million years ago.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Generalized higher agriculture is practiced by 63 species in two genera and refers to the condition of highly domesticated fungus.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The fungi used in higher agriculture cannot survive without its agriculturalists to tend it and has phenotypic changes that allow for increased ease of ant harvesting.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Leafcutter agriculture, which is a more highly derived form of higher agriculture, is practiced by 40 species in two genera and has the most recent evolution, originating between 8 and 12 million years ago.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Leaf cutters use living biomass as the substrate to feed their fungi, whereas in all other types of agriculture, the fungus requires dead biomass.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==The attines==
The ants of the [[Attini]] tribe (subfamily Myrmicinae) are obligatory fungicultivists. Attini form twelve genera with over 200 species, which for the most part cultivate [[Lepiotaceae]] fungi of the tribe [[Leucocoprineae]].&lt;ref name=Mueller2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=chapela /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weber N. A. 1972. Gardening ants: The attines. Philadelphia (PA): American Philosophical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;
These ants are typically subdivided into the "lower" and "higher" attines. One of the more distinguishing factors between these two subgroups is their respective cultivars and cultivar substrates. Lower attines have less specialized cultivars that more closely resemble ''Leucocoprineae'' found in the wild and use "ancestral substrates" composed of plant, wood, arthropod, and flower detritus. The higher attines, on the other hand, use freshly cut grass, leaves, and flowers as their fungi substrate (hence the common name "leafcutter ants") and cultivate highly derived fungi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schultz | first1 = T.

==Secondary symbiotic relationships==
There are additional symbiotic relationships that affect fungal agriculture. The fungus ''[[Escovopsis]]'' is a [[parasitism|parasite]] in ant colonies, and the bacterium ''[[Pseudonocardia]]'' has a [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship with ants. ''Pseudonocardia'' resides on the ants' integuments and assists in defending the ants from ''Escovopsis'' through the production of [[secondary metabolites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Partner fidelity can be witnessed through vertical gene transmission of fungi when a new colony is begun.&lt;ref name="Mikheyev 1777–1782"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mikheyev|first=A |title=Convergent coevolution in the domestication of coral mushrooms by fungus-growing ants.|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=271|issue=1550|pages=1777–1782|doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.2759|pmid=15315892|pmc=1691797|year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the queen must mate with several males to inseminate her many eggs before she flies off to a different location to begin a new colony. As she leaves, she takes with her a cluster of mycelium (the vegetative portion of the fungus) and actually begins a new fungal garden at her resting point using this mycelium. This grows to become the new fungal farm complete with the genes of the original cultivar preserved for another generation of ants. The relationship between attine ants and the Lepiotaceae fungus is so specialized that in many cases the Lepiotaceae is not even found outside of ant colony nests. It is clear that evolutionary pressure has been exerted on these ants to develop such an organized system in which to feed the fungus and continue its reproduction.

Studies done (with the concept of the [[prisoner's dilemma]] in mind) to test what further drives partner fidelity among species have shown that external factors are an even greater driving force. The effects of cheating ants (ants who did not bring plant biomass for fungal food) had a much smaller effect on the fitness of the relationship than when the fungi cheated by not providing gongylidia. Both effects were exacerbated in the presence of infection by escovopsis, resulting in close to a 50% loss in fungal biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Little|first=Ainslie|author2=Cameron Currie |title=Parasites may help stabilize cooperative relationships|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|pages=120–124 |year=2009|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-9-124|volume=9|pmid=19486536|pmc=2701933}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that the risk of infection from parasites is a driving external factor in keeping these two species loyal to one another. Though external factors play a large role in maintaining fidelity between the mutualists, genetic evidence of vertical transmission of partner fidelity has been found among asexual, fungus cultivating ant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kellner|first=K|title=Co-evolutionary patterns and diversification of ant–fungus associations in the asexual fungus-farming ant ''Mycocepurus smithii'' in Panama|journal=Evolutionary Biology|volume=26|issue=6|pages=1353–1362 |year=2013|doi=10.1111/jeb.12140|pmid=23639137|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors such as vertical transmission do not play as strong a role as environmental factors in maintaining fidelity, as cultivar switching among ant species is not a highly uncommon practice.&lt;ref name="Mikheyev 1777–1782"/&gt;

Given the exclusive [[New World]] distribution of the over 200 [[fungus-growing ant|fungus-growing]] ant species,&lt;ref name=mueller&gt;{{cite journal|author1=U.G. Mueller |author2=T.R.

The species ''[[Cyatta abscondita]]'' is considered the most recent ancestor of all leaf-cutting ants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/5408/20131223/ghost-ant-new-species-living-fossil-ancient-fungus-farming-ants.htm| title = The Ghost Ant: New Species is a Living Fossil of Ancient Fungus-Farming Ants |publisher =Nature World News| date=Dec 23, 2013|accessdate = 24 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the ants are [[monophyletic]], their symbionts are not. They fall roughly into three major groups, only G1 having [[evolved]] [[gongylidia]]. Some G2 species grow long hyphae that form a protective cover over the nest. Those in G3 are [[paraphyletic]], the most heteregenous, and form the most loose relationships with their cultivators.&lt;ref name=chapela/&gt; Studies now show that the fungi themselves may not be completely dependent on the ants. The fungi were earlier thought to be propagated by ants purely through clonal (vegetative) means. However considerable genetic variation in the fungi suggests that this may not be the case.&lt;ref name="Mikheyev, S., U.G. Mueller, P. Abbott 2006 10702–10706"/&gt; It is hypothesized that fungi have evolved to make themselves more attractive to ant species through the development of enzymes that allow the ants to access nutrition in the fungal mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = The prominent role of fungi and fungal enzymes in the Ant–fungus biomass conversion symbiosi|publisher =National Center for Biotechnology Information| date=Apr 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Australian archaeology''' is a large sub-field in the discipline of [[archaeology]]. Archaeology in Australia takes three main forms, [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] archaeology (the archaeology of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia before and after European settlement), [[historical archaeology]] (the archaeology of Australia after European settlement) and [[maritime archaeology]]. Bridging these sub-disciplines is the important concept of [[cultural heritage management]] which encompasses Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander sites, historical sites and maritime sites.

==Research and investigations==
Archaeological studies or investigations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and culture in Australia have had many different agendas through time. Initial archaeological investigation was often focused on finding the oldest sites. By the 1970s, archaeological research was concerned with the environment and the way it impacted on humans. In the late 1970s cultural heritage management gained prominence, with the increasing demands by Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups for representation in archaeological research. At a research level the focus shifted to cultural change of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people through time.

Currently, archaeological research places great importance on Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's viewpoints on the land and history of Australia. Consideration is given to Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's belief that archaeological sites are not just capsules of the past but a continuation from the past to the present. Therefore, at a research level significance is placed on the past but also on the importance of the present.

{{See also|Prehistory of Australia}}
The first settlement of Australia is a popular research topic both in archaeology and in the public arena. There is consensus that no [[Hominidae|human or closely related species]] evolved independently in Australia. This is because there have been no species of primate found in Australia, either in the present or in the fossil record. It is therefore assumed that the first settlers of Australia came from outside. At present the fossil record suggests that the first settlers were ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', or fully modern humans.

There is controversy over where the first Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people originated. Both of the two main theories postulate that the first settlers were fully modern humans. Asian genetic studies have demonstrated that there are similarities between Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, [[Melanesians]] and [[India]]ns. However, the suggested date of 60,000 years ago for initial settlement is quite early when compared to other areas of the world. This may suggest that the Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population derive from an early African population which migrated along the south coast of Asia, at a much faster rate than other populations migrating across the continents of the [[Holocene]].

The first settlement of Australia most likely occurred during the last glacial maximum. During this time Australia and [[New Guinea]] were joined as a single land mass called [[Sahul continent|Sahul]]. The south-east Asian continent and islands were also joined as a single land mass called [[Sundaland|Sunda]]. It is theorised that the first Australians crossed the sea between Sahul and Sunda about 60,000 to 40,000 years ago. Other dates have been suggested, and this timeframe is not seen as conclusive. Sunda and Sahul had a permanent water-crossing, meaning that the first Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people had to make a crossing on the open sea (see [[Wallace Line]]).

Sahul is important in that in the past Australia was not an isolated continent, but was joined with New Guinea (and Tasmania). As such, New Guinea has also been the focus of archaeological investigations by Australian researchers.

The most important early sites in Australia are:
* [[Rottnest Island]] (70,000 years old)
* [[Nauwalabila]] (55,000 – 60,000 years old)
* [[Madjedbebe]] (65,000 years ago)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clarkson|first1=Chris|last2=Smith|first2=Mike|last3=Marwick|first3=Ben|last4=Fullagar|first4=Richard|last5=Wallis|first5=Lynley A.|last6=Faulkner|first6=Patrick|last7=Manne|first7=Tiina|last8=Hayes|first8=Elspeth|last9=Roberts|first9=Richard G.|last10=Jacobs|first10=Zenobia|last11=Carah|first11=Xavier|last12=Lowe|first12=Kelsey M.|last13=Matthews|first13=Jacqueline|last14=Florin|first14=S.

* [[Devil's Lair]] (45,000 years old)
* [[Lake Mungo]] (61,000 or 40,000 years old) – controversy exists over precise dating (see below)
The change in sea levels means that the first settlements located on the coast would have been submerged.

With the settlement of Australia, it is most probable that Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people first settled on the northern coast, as this is the area closest to Asia. However, the actual spread of people and the settlement of the continent is debated, with three major models put forward:
* Concentric dispersal through the entire continent through one single "entry" point.
* Coastal dispersal by spreading along the coastline and later entering inland areas, mainly via the major waterways.
* Fluctuating colonisation in and out of different environmental zones. For example, in plentiful years the population would occupy semi-arid regions, but in drought would move to areas with better resources.

===Controversies in Aboriginal archaeology===

====Date of arrival====
There is significant debate over the date of arrival of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people into the Australian continent. Until the 1950s it was often believed that arrival of the first Aboriginal people was within the last 10,000 years. In the 1950s, the dates were extended to the last Ice Age, based upon falling sea-levels at that period and the existence of [[landbridge]]s linking the islands of the Sunda Shelf and the Sahul Continental Shelf with Australia, New Guinea and Tasmania. The discovery and use of C14 dating extended the dating to 40,000 years at Lake Mungo, and this was the date most frequently given. However, more recently, the analysis of sea levels has shown that coastlines 40,000 years ago were not as exposed as they were 60,000 to 70,000 years ago. The submergence of the earliest sites of occupation due to rising sea levels has meant that the earliest archaeological signature may in fact represent occupation much later than the initial time of arrival.&lt;ref name="Hiscock, P. 2008"&gt;Hiscock, P. (2008). Archaeology of Ancient Australia, London; New York: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty in establishing a date of arrival earlier than 50,000 years has been compounded by the widespread use of radiocarbon dating and the supposed "radiocarbon barrier" which establishes 40,000 years as a limit to which C14 dates can be easily and reliably extracted.&lt;ref name="Hiscock, P. 2008"/&gt; This limitation has prompted many archaeologists, including [[Rhys Jones (archaeologist)|Rhys Jones]] and Alan Thorne, to include [[thermoluminescence dating|thermoluminescence dating methods]] in their studies of early occupation sites. It is argued that 60,000 to 70,000 years best fits the evidence from the [[Human genome diversity project]] and a number of other new dating technologies. Some have proposed dates extending back 100,000 to 120,000 years, but these dates are criticised on technical grounds and are not accepted by most scientists. A recent study by Eske Willesev of the University of Copenhagen, of the genome of an Aboriginal man from the [[Western Australia]]n [[Goldfields-Esperance|Goldfields]] confirms that the Aboriginal population separated from the early human stock 70,000 years ago, in Africa or from Oman, and travelled fairly rapidly across south and south eastern Asia to arrive in Australia at least 50,000 years ago, before a second wave travelled into Europe and Asia, receiving some input from the Aboriginal people who had already made that journey.&lt;ref&gt;http://geogenetics.ku.dk/latest-news/aboriginals-get-new-history/ accessed 2/22016&lt;/ref&gt;

====Multiple arrivals====
Earlier anthropologists believed that there were "three waves" of arrival of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to Australia, the first being the "negrito" Tasmanian people, who were displaced by "Murrayans", who in turn were considered to be displaced by "Carpentarians". These theories were sometimes advocated to disprove the Aboriginal claim to being the indigenous "first peoples". The fact that modern Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people cannot explain the [[Bradshaw rock paintings|Bradshaw figures]] of North Western Australia was also seen as evidence of displacement of earlier peoples by later arrivals. The finding of a robust skeleton with surprisingly so-called "primitive" features at [[Kow Swamp Archaeological Site|Kow Swamp]] was also advocated as proof of an earlier wave of settlers to the continent. Dating of the Kow Swamp material, however, showed that rather than being earlier, it was in fact a lot more recent than the nearby Mungo gracile skeletons that more closely resembled modern Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Today it is thought that Aboriginal people throughout the continent are descendants of an original founder population, although this does not completely exclude some contribution from later arrivals.

For example, on the basis of genomic analysis, it has been found that 4–500 years ago a small band from the Indian sub-continent travelled to northern Australia and contributed to the genome of people living in the north.  At that time the appearance of the backed blade tradition, the dingo and other cultural features have been attributed to the arrivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pugach | first1 = I. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2013 | title = Genome wide data substanciateHolocene gene flow from India to Australia | url = | journal = Proc.

====Megafauna extinction====
Some researchers, such as [[Tim Flannery]], have put forward the idea that human settlement was responsible for the large climatic and environmental changes that occurred in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Flannery, Tim (2002), "The Future Eaters: An Ecological History of the Australasian Lands and People." (Grove Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent and causes of the [[Australian megafauna]]l extinction—generally placed in the [[Late Pleistocene]]—continues as an active debate and is a preoccupation among archaeologists and palaeontologists working in the Australian scene. Besides ongoing attempts to refine the dating and extent of the extinction event(s), much research is actively directed towards establishing whether, or to what extent, [[anthropogenic effects]] played a part in the disappearance of dozens of species of large-bodied animals formerly inhabiting the continent. Central to this question is a determination of how long humans and the megafauna species coexisted. Many factors have been considered as possible causes of the extinction, ranging from environmental variables to entirely human-based activity.

The most extreme theory is that Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were completely responsible for the extinction of these animals through extensive hunting. This theory is largely based on the [[overkill hypothesis]] of the Americas, where hunters travelled through the land exterminating megafauna. The overkill hypothesis is largely discredited (and not just in Australia), as there have been no confirmed discoveries of [[kill sites]], sites that are found in other contexts around the world and associated with megafauna hunting. The sites of [[Cuddie Springs]] in [[New South Wales]], and [[Keilor Archaeological Site|Keilor]] in Victoria, display some evidence of associations between Aboriginal stone tools and megafauna remains, but do not prove conclusively the overkill theory. Furthermore, the coexistence of Aboriginal populations with the megafauna tends to contradict the overkill hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;D.R.Horton, "Red kangaroos: Last of the Australian megafauna" (CSA Illumina)&lt;/ref&gt;  These writers suggest "threshold (for megafauna dieoff) was crossed between 26,000 and 15,000 yr B.P. when the arid area expanded further than usual and water resources in the woodland areas were severely reduced", although this finding is disputed by Roberts ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Roberts R.G. (2001), "New Ages for the Last Australian Megafauna: Continent-Wide Extinction About 46,000 Years Ago" (Science, 8 June 2001: Vol. 292 no. 5523 pp. 1888–1892)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Gifford et al (1999), "Pleistocene Extinction of Genyornis newtoni: Human Impact on Australian Megafauna" (Science 8 January 1999: Vol. 283 no. 5399 pp. 205–208)&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear from [[paleobotany|paleobotanical]] and [[palaeontological]] evidence that the extinction coincided with great environmental change. The high-resolution chronology of the changes supports the hypothesis that human hunting alone eliminated the megafauna, and that the subsequent change in flora was most likely a consequence of the elimination of browsers and an increase in fire.&lt;ref name = "Biello"&gt;{{cite web

Approximately 18,000 to 7,000 years ago, many societies around the world underwent significant change; in particular, this time marks the rise of agriculture in many Neolithic societies. In the Australian context environmental change did not give rise to the development of agriculture but it may have contributed to the disappearance of populations of animals made even more vulnerable to depletion through hunting and marginalised grazing.

====Lake Mungo dating====
Arguably the oldest human remains in Australia, the Lake Mungo 3 skull was given the age of 60,000 years by Gregory Adcock and his researchers.&lt;ref name="Adcock2001"&gt;{{ cite journal |last=Adcock |first=G. |authorlink= |year=2001 |title=Mitochondrial DNA sequences in ancient Australians: Implications for modern human origins |journal= [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]] |volume= 98 |issue= 2 |pages=537–542 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.98.2.537|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/98/2/537 |accessdate=|quote= |pmid=11209053 |pmc=14622 |bibcode = 2001PNAS...98..537A |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this claim has been criticised, largely due to the process used to analyse the skull and the claims regarding the dating and the [[mtDNA]] found.&lt;ref name="mungo2"&gt;Brown, Peter.

[http://www-personal.une.edu.au/~pbrown3/LM3.html Lake Mungo 3] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140126190110/http://www-personal.une.edu.au/~pbrown3/LM3.html |date=26 January 2014 }}. Retrieved 9 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Most people suggest that the age of the specimen is approximately 40,000 years. Sensitivities to handling Aboriginal remains means that specimens are not available for further research, so reassessment of the date awaits the development of appropriate ethical protocols.

====The intensification debate====
The idea of intensification was put forward by a number of archaeologists, but the most prominent in developing the idea was [[Harry Lourandos]]. Intensification is an idea that posits that change in economic systems of peoples is controlled by social changes. This means that change can occur without an external force such as environmental change. The idea is derived from a 1990s debate about the [[Tasmania]]n Aboriginal people and whether large social/economic change was caused by environmental factors (see ''[[Environmental determinism]]''), or from factors within the society.&lt;ref name="inten1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lourandos | first1 = Harry | last2 = Ross | first2 = Anne | year = 1994 | title = The Great 'Intensification Debate': Its history and place in Australian Archaeology | journal = Australian Archaeology | volume = 39 | issue = 39| pages = 54–63 |jstor=40287690}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inten2"&gt;Lourandos, Harry. (1997). ''Continent of Hunter-Gatherers''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-35946-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The predominant view at the time held that in the case of the Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people any social change was largely influenced by external, largely environmental, factors.

The evidence that supports this idea is that sites at approximately the same time (around 4,000 years ago) experienced increased usage. This is supported by increased site numbers, increased artefact density and an expansion into new environments. This evidence has also been explained by environmental factors, large population growth, technological change, or even [[taphonomy|post-depositional factors]].

====The cultivation question====
Kent Flannery's model&lt;ref&gt;Kent Flannery, "Origins and Ecological Effects of Early Domestication in Iran and the Near East," The Domestication and Exploitation of Plants and Animals, eds. Peter J. Ucko and G.W. Dimbleby (Chicago: Aldine Publishing Co., 1969), 73–100&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[broad spectrum revolution]] in which foragers diversified the types of food sources harvested, broadening their subsistence base outward to include more fish, small game, water fowl, invertebrates likes snails and shellfish, as well as previously ignored or marginal plant sources, would seem to apply to Australian hunters and gatherers. These changes were linked to climatic changes, including sea level rises during the [[Flandrian transgression]] in which:

# Conditions became more inviting to marine life offshore in shallow, warm waters.
# Quantity and variety of marine life increased drastically as did the number of edible species.
# Because the rivers' power weakened with rising waters, and the creation of many estuaries, the currents flowing into the ocean were slow enough to allow fish to ascend upstream to spawn.
# Birds found refuge next to riverbeds in marsh grasses and then proceeded to migrate to different habitats.

Aboriginal people had a good understanding of local ecologies, and harvested many varieties of plants and animals in season.  W.E.Roth talks about driving kangaroos into a 3 sided enclosure of nets "with the assistance of numerous beaters".  Wallabies and emus were also caught in a similar way.  Wallaroos were hunted with fire and beaten towards a creek, where they were killed with spears and sticks.&lt;ref name="roth"&gt;Roth W.E. Food: Its Search, Capture and Preparation: North Queensland Ethnography Bulletin No.3 1901.&lt;/ref&gt;  Animals were also driven towards set nets and fish traps were common.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;Davis G (Nungabana) The Mullunburra: people of the Mulgrave River.  Cassowary Publications. 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree to which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on the Australian continent practised agriculture has long been debated by archaeologists.  Earlier it was believed that Australian Aboriginal people were ignorant of the principles of agriculture, but this has since been disproven.  For instance, Australian Aboriginal women in traditional societies often transplanted immature "[[bush tucker]]" plants found growing in unfavourable locations to more favourable spots. There were also a number of plants (particularly seeds and roots) that could have lent themselves to cultivation, and were used in making such foods as [[Damper (food)|damper]]. [[Charles Sturt]] in his 1844 expedition to northwest New South Wales and central Australia reports seeing large haystacks built by Aboriginal people of seed crops. This was located east of Depot Glen [[Milparinka]] about 600&amp;nbsp;km from the [[Murray River]]. [[Firestick farming]] has also always been a technique used by Aboriginal people to open the canopy of closed canopy forests, introducing sunlight to the ground, and prompting germination of a number of foodstuffs known to attract [[kangaroo]] and other marsupials. This would encourage a more intensive land use than otherwise. But the main reason for the lack of agriculture in Australia is the extreme variability of the climate. Australia is the only continent on Earth, which, as a result of the [[El Nino]] [[Southern Oscillation]], experiences greater variability between years than it does between the seasons. Such climatic variability makes farming very difficult, especially for incipient farmers who cannot be supported from outside their community. Australian Aboriginal people found that maintaining stable populations below the effective carrying capacity of the environment would enable an adequate supply of food, even in drought years, so maintaining a stable culture. This made [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] a more sustainable activity on the Australian continent than [[neolithic]] farming. Evidence of cultivation at [[Kuk Swamp|Kuk]] in Papua New Guinea, from about 10–12,000 years BP (at a time when that island was joined to Australia, suggests crop raising was possible in the Sahul supercontinent when conditions were favourable.

==Historical archaeology in Australia==
{{main|Historical archaeology in Australia}}
[[Historical archaeology]] is the study of the past through material remains such as artefacts (i.e. objects), structures (e.g. standing and ruined buildings, fences, roads), features (e.g. ditches, mounds, canals, landfill), and even whole landscapes modified by human activity and their spatial and stratigraphic contexts.

The origins of [[historical archaeology in Australia]] are generally held to lie in archaeological investigations by the late William (Bill) Culican at Fossil Beach in Victoria, in Jim Allen's PhD research at Port Essington in the Northern Territory and in Judy Birmingham's work at [[Irrawang Pottery]] in the Hunter Valley of NSW.
An increasingly important area of Australian historical archaeology studies the interaction between European and other settlers, and Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

==Underwater and maritime archaeology in Australia==
[[Underwater archaeology]] is archaeology practised in a submerged environment. It encompasses the pre-historic and historic eras. [[Maritime archaeology]] (the study of humans and their activities in, on, around and under the seas, rivers and estuaries) and Nautical archaeology, (the specialised study of boat and ship construction) are allied sub-disciplines of archaeology as a whole. Often the sites or relics are not inundated, however. Of late these various studies have progressed into the industrial and post-war eras. In mirroring their terrestrial roots, underwater archaeology, maritime and nautical archaeology can now include the examination of a wide range of sites ranging from the indigenous through to [[industrial archaeology]] and of late the study of wartime and post-war sites, including historic submerged aircraft. Better known as a sub-discipline of [[aviation archaeology]], underwater aviation archaeology is arguably the most recent offshoot of underwater archaeology, having developed its theoretical underpinnings and a substantial corpus of fieldwork, research and publication work in the late 1990s. Maritime archaeology, the first of these sub-disciplines to emerge in Australia, commenced under the aegis of Jeremy Green in the 1970s after concerns were expressed by academics and politicians over the rampant destruction of Dutch and British East Indian ships lost on the west coast. After Commonwealth legislation was enacted and enforced after 1976 and the States enacted their own legislation the sub-discipline spread throughout Australia, as a result of on-going funding by both the States and the Commonwealth. While also encompassing the study of port-related structures (e.g. jetties, anchorages), lighthouses, moorings, defences etc., initially the focus in maritime archaeology was solely on shipwrecks.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, M., (ed.) 2007. Shipwreck archaeology in Australia. UWA Press, Nedlands&lt;/ref&gt; Now far broader in its scope, in some states maritime and underwater archaeology is managed by museums and in others by cultural heritage management units. There are also numerous practitioners in private practice, or acting as consultants. Regardless, all practitioners operate under the aegis of the Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology (AIMA).&lt;ref&gt;Staniforth, M., &amp; Nash, M., (eds.) 2006, Underwater Archaeology: Australian Approaches. Springer,  NY&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural heritage management==
Commercial or consulting archaeology (also termed [[cultural heritage management]]) only developed in earnest in Australia from the 1970s, with the advent of various state legislation requiring approvals for damage or disturbance to archaeological relics, such as the Aboriginal and Archaeological Relics Preservation Act 1972, in Victoria. The [[Victoria Archaeological Survey]] was established from the Relics Office in 1975. Historical Archaeology is generally protected by separate legislation, such as the New South Wales Heritage Act 1977, and the various other state counterparts.

Cultural Heritage Management for archaeological sites is seen in the context of wider heritage issues, and follows the principles set out in the [[Burra Charter]] or the [[Australia ICOMOS]] charter for the conservation of places of cultural significance.

From a handful of practitioners in the '70s, there are now more than 250 commercially based archaeologists in Australia. Again in Victoria, one of the first to establish was du Cros and associates (later absorbed by Biosis Research, renamed [[Biosis Pty Ltd]] in 2012). The [[Australian Association of Consulting Archaeologist]] Inc. (AACAI) is the professional body established in 1979 with presently about 50 full members. In New South Wales, companies such as Casey and Lowe and GML have specialised in large scale historical archaeological salvage.

Consultancy archaeology is primarily driven by development, and so is often at the centre of controversy over ownership of heritage and in particular the conflicting objectives of conservation and development. Aboriginal communities often ascribe a special significance to the places where archaeological remains have been found.

===Legal obligations in Australia===
Protection and management of archaeology in Australia is controlled by Federal and State Government legislation including the Commonwealth Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and the various state archaeological legislation such as Victoria's Heritage Act 1995 (covering historical archaeology) and the [[Aboriginal Heritage Act 2006 (Victoria)|Aboriginal Heritage Act 2006]]. Several states maintain archaeological site inventories as the main management tool. The principle of most forms of archaeological legislation in Australia is to provide blanket protection for all archaeological remains and sites, whether or not they have been recorded, and use a system of permits and consents to control change to those sites. for Aboriginal archaeological sites, there is often a requirement for consultation with traditional owners, and they sometimes have a role in approving works that impact on archaeological sites.

===Native title and land rights===
{{main|Native title in Australia}}
Native title is formalised under The Commonwealth [[Native Title Act 1993]] which establishes a framework for the protection and recognition of [[native title]]. The Australian legal system recognises native title where:
*the rights and interests are possessed under traditional laws and customs that continue to be acknowledged and observed by the relevant Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders
*by virtue of those laws and customs, the Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders have a connection with the land or waters
*the native title rights and interests are recognised by the common law of Australia.

==Professional societies in Australian archaeology==
The [[Australian Archaeological Association]] is one of the largest and oldest organisations devoted to furthering archaeology of all types within Australia.

The [[Australasian Society for Historical Archaeology]] (ASHA) founded as the Australian Society for Historical Archaeology in 1970. Its aims were, and still are, to promote the study of historical archaeology in Australia.

The [[Archaeological and Anthropological Society of Victoria]] (AASV) is predominantly a non-professional organisation, which was formed in 1976 in through the amalgamation of two earlier societies, the [[Anthropological Society of Victoria]] formed in 1934, and the [[Archaeological Society of Victoria]] formed in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120716131750/http://www.aas.asn.au/conf07/sessions/sesabs01c.php Margaret Bullen, ''Transforming Economies, Changing States'' Australian Anthropological Society, Annual Conference 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The principal academic journals publishing on Australian Archaeology in Australia, are: ''[[Australian Archaeology (journal)|Australian Archaeology]]'', ''[[The Artefact (journal)|The Artefact]]'', the ''Bulletin of the Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology'', and ''[[Australasian Society for Historical Archaeology#Publications|Australasian Historical Archaeology]]'', while some history focused journals such as ''[[History Australia]]'' also feature Australian Archaeology related topics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.informit.com.au/search;action=doSearch RMIT INFORMIT journal search ''Australia'' AND ''Archaeology'']&lt;/ref&gt; Several international journals such as ''Science'', ''Antiquity'' and the ''International Journal of Historical Archaeology'', often publish articles on Australian Archaeology.

[[File:PAX6 Phenotypes Washington etal PLoSBiol e1000247.png|right|400px|thumb|''[[pax6]]'' alterations result in similar phenotypic alterations of eye morphology and function across a wide range of species.]]

In [[evolutionary developmental biology]],  the concept of '''deep homology''' is used to describe cases where [[Cell growth|growth]] and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]] processes are governed by genetic mechanisms that are [[Homology (biology)#Homology of sequences in genetics|homologous]] and deeply [[Conserved sequence|conserved]] across a wide range of [[species]].

==History==
{{further|Evolutionary developmental biology}}

In 1822, the French zoologist [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] dissected a [[crayfish]], discovering that its body is organised like a vertebrate's, but [[Inversion (evolutionary biology)|inverted belly to back (dorsoventrally)]]:&lt;ref name=Held2&gt;{{cite book |last1=Held |first1=Lewis I. |authorlink=Lewis Held |title=Deep Homology?: Uncanny Similarities of Humans and Flies Uncovered by Evo-Devo |date=February 2017 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1316601211 |pages=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I just found that all the soft organs, that is to say, the principal organs of life are found in crustaceans, and so in insects, in the same order, in the same relationships and with the same arrangement as their analogues in the high vertebrate animals ... What was my surprise, and I may add, my admiration, seeing [such] a rule ...&lt;ref name=Held2/&gt;}}

[[File:Genes hox.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Homology (biology)|Homologous]] [[hox gene|''hox'' genes]] in such different animals as [[insect]]s and [[vertebrate]]s control [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]] and hence the [[Morphology (biology)|form]] of adult bodies. These genes have been [[conserved sequence|highly conserved]] through hundreds of millions of years of [[evolution]].]]

Geoffroy's homology theory was denounced by the leading French zoologist of his day, [[Georges Cuvier]], but in 1994, Geoffroy was shown to be correct.&lt;ref name=Held2/&gt; In 1915, [[Santiago Ramon y Cajal]] mapped the neural connections of the optic lobes of a fly, finding that these resembled those of vertebrates.&lt;ref name=Held2/&gt; In 1978, [[Edward B. Lewis]] helped to found [[evolutionary developmental biology]], discovering that [[homeosis|homeotic genes]] regulated embryonic development in fruit flies.&lt;ref name=Held2/&gt;

In 1997, the term deep homology first appeared in a paper by [[Neil Shubin]], Cliff Tabin, and [[Sean B. Carroll]], describing the apparent relatedness in genetic regulatory apparatuses which indicated evolutionary similarities in disparate animal features.&lt;ref name="Shubin Tabin Carroll 1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Shubin | first=Neil | last2=Tabin | first2=Cliff | last3=Carroll | first3=Sean | title=Fossils, genes and the evolution of animal limbs | journal=Nature | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=388 | issue=6643 | year=1997 | doi=10.1038/41710 | pages=639–648 | url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e9fd/04bdfae57145375564321602c405bb0cbaa4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A different kind of homology==

Whereas ordinary [[homology (biology)|homology]] is seen in the pattern of structures such as limb bones of mammals that are evidently related, deep homology can apply to groups of animals that have quite dissimilar anatomy: vertebrates (with [[endoskeleton]]s made of [[bone]] and [[cartilage]]) and arthropods (with [[exoskeleton]]s made of [[chitin]]) nevertheless have limbs that are constructed using similar recipes or "algorithms".&lt;ref name="Shubin Tabin Carroll 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carroll66&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=Sean B. |authorlink=Sean B. Carroll |title=Endless Forms Most Beautiful |titlelink=Endless Forms Most Beautiful (book) |date=2006 |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |isbn=0-297-85094-6 |pages=28, 66–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Homologous Pathways of Development |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=dbio&amp;part=A5439 |author=Gilbert, Scott F. |authorlink=Scott F.

Within the [[metazoa]], [[homeotic gene]]s control differentiation along major [[body axis|body axes]], and [[pax genes]] (especially [[PAX6]]) help to control the development of the [[eye]] and other [[sensory organ]]s. The deep homology applies across widely separated groups, such as in the eyes of [[mammals]] and the structurally quite different [[compound eye]]s of [[insects]].&lt;ref name=Carroll66/&gt;

Similarly, [[hox gene]]s help to form an animal's segmentation pattern. HoxA and HoxD, that regulate finger and toe formation in mice, control the development of [[Actinopterygii|ray fins]] in [[zebrafish]]; these structures had until then been considered non-homologous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/18/science/from-fins-into-hands-scientists-discover-a-deep-evolutionary-link.html |title=From Fins Into Hands: Scientists Discover a Deep Evolutionary Link |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Zimmer|date=2016-08-17 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a possible deep homology among animals that use acoustic communication, such as songbirds and humans, which may share unmutated versions of the [[FOXP2]] gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |title=Evo-Devo, Deep Homology and FoxP2: Implications for the Evolution of Speech and Language |author1=Scharff, Petri |author2=Constance, Jane |journal=Philos.

==Algorithm==

In 2010, a team led by [[Edward Marcotte]] developed an [[algorithm]] that identifies deeply homologous genetic modules in unicellular organisms, plants, and animals based on [[phenotype]]s (such as traits and developmental defects). The technique aligns phenotypes across organisms based on [[Homology (biology)#Orthology|orthology]] (a type of homology) of genes involved in the phenotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Zimmer, Carl |authorlink=Carl Zimmer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/science/27gene.html?hp=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=The Search for Genes Leads to Unexpected Places |work=The New York Times |date=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McGary2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McGary, K.

'''Demographic transition''' ('''DT''') is the transition from high [[Birth rate|birth]] and [[death rate]]s to lower birth and death rates as a country or region develops from a pre-industrial to an [[Industrialisation|industrialized]] [[economic system]]. The theory was proposed in 1929 by the American [[demography|demographer]] Warren Thompson,&lt;ref name=DemenyAndMcNicoll&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title= Warren Thompson|encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of Population| volume = 2|pages=939–40|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan Reference]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-02-865677-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; who observed changes, or transitions, in birth and death rates in industrialized societies over the previous 200 years.  Most [[developed countries]] have completed the demographic transition and have low birth rates; most [[developing countries]] are in the process of this transition.&lt;ref name=Caldwell&gt;{{cite book|last=Caldwell|first=John C.|author2=Bruce K Caldwell |author3=Pat Caldwell |author4=Peter F McDonald |author5=Thomas Schindlmayr |title=Demographic Transition Theory|publisher= [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|year= 2006 |location=Dordrecht, The Netherlands|isbn=978-1-4020-4373-4 | page = 239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="geography.about.com"&gt;{{Citation | publisher = About | title = Geography | url = http://geography.about.com/od/culturalgeography/a/demotransition.htm | contribution = Demographic transition}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The major (relative) exceptions are some poor countries, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and some [[Middle Eastern]] countries, which are poor or affected by government policy or civil strife, notably, Pakistan, [[Palestinian territories]], [[Yemen]], and [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=Caldwell /&gt;

The demographic transition model, in isolation, can be taken to predict that birth rates will continue to go down as societies grow increasingly wealthy; however, recent data contradicts this, suggesting that beyond a certain level of development birth rates increase again.&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature08230|pmid=19661915|title=Advances in development reverse fertility declines|journal=Nature|volume=460|issue=7256|pages=741–3|year=2009|last1=Myrskylä|first1=Mikko|last2=Kohler|first2=Hans-Peter|last3=Billari|first3=Francesco C.|bibcode=2009Natur.460..741M}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in the very long term, the demographic transition should be reversed via [[evolutionary pressure]] for higher [[Birth rate|fertility]] and higher [[death rate|mortality]].&lt;ref name=bbc_sure&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19923200 Can we be sure the world's population will stop rising?], BBC News, 13 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of some kind of demographic transition is widely accepted in the social sciences because of the well-established historical [[correlation]] linking dropping fertility to social and economic development.&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt; Scholars debate whether industrialization and higher incomes [[Causation (sociology)|lead to]] lower population, or whether lower populations lead to industrialization and higher incomes.

==History of the theory==
The theory is based on an interpretation of [[demography|demographic]] history developed in 1929 by the American demographer Warren Thompson (1887–1973).&lt;ref name=DemenyAndMcNicoll /&gt; [[Adolphe Landry]] of France made similar observations on demographic patterns and population growth potential around 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landry|first1=Adolphe|title=Adolphe Landry on the Demographic Revolution|journal=Population and Development Review|date=December 1987|volume=13|issue=4|pages=731|doi=10.2307/1973031|jstor=1973031}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s and 1950s [[Frank W. Notestein]] developed a more formal theory of demographic transition.&lt;ref name="Woods2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Woods|first=Robert|title=The Demography of Victorian England and Wales|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=75DZmQtybMwC&amp;pg=PA18|date=2000-10-05|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-78254-8|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009, the existence of a negative correlation between fertility and industrial development had become one of the most widely accepted findings in social science.&lt;ref name="Nature" /&gt;

==Summary of the theory==
[[File:Demographic-Transition-5-countries.png|thumb|upright=2.75|Demographic change in Germany, Sweden, Chile, Mauritius, China from 1820 to 2010.&lt;br /&gt;Pink line: crude [[death rate]] (CDR), green line: (crude) [[birth rate]] (CBR), yellow line: population.]]

The transition involves four stages, or possibly five.

* In stage one, [[pre-industrial society ]], death rates and birth rates are high and roughly in balance. All human populations are believed to have had this balance until the late 18th century, when this balance ended in Western Europe.&lt;ref name= "marathon.uwc.edu"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://pages.uwc.edu/keith.montgomery/Demotrans/demtran.htm | publisher = UWC | title = Geography | contribution = Demographic transition}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, growth rates were less than 0.05% at least since the Agricultural Revolution over 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; Population growth is typically very slow in this stage, because the society is constrained by the available food supply; therefore, unless the society develops new technologies to increase food production (e.g. discovers new sources of food or achieves higher crop yields), any fluctuations in birth rates are soon matched by death rates.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt;
* In stage two, that of a developing country, the death rates drop quickly due to improvements in food supply and sanitation, which increase life expectancies and reduce disease. The improvements specific to food supply typically include selective breeding and crop rotation and farming techniques.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; Other improvements generally include access to ovens, baking, and television. For example, numerous improvements in public health reduce mortality, especially childhood mortality.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; Prior to the mid-20th century, these improvements in public health were primarily in the areas of food handling, water supply, sewage, and personal hygiene.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; One of the variables often cited is the increase in female literacy combined with public health education programs which emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; In Europe, the death rate decline started in the late 18th century in northwestern Europe and spread to the south and east over approximately the next 100 years.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; Without a corresponding fall in birth rates this produces an [[Demographic trap|imbalance]], and the countries in this stage experience a large increase in [[population]].
* In stage three, birth rates fall due to various [[fertility factor (demography)|fertility factors]] such as access to [[contraception]], increases in wages, [[urbanization]], a reduction in [[subsistence agriculture]], an increase in the status and education of women, a reduction in the value of children's work, an increase in parental investment in the education of children and other social changes.  Population growth begins to level off. The birth rate decline in developed countries started in the late 19th century in northern Europe.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; While improvements in contraception do play a role in birth rate decline, it should be noted that contraceptives were not generally available nor widely used in the 19th century and as a result likely did not play a significant role in the decline then.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; It is important to note that birth rate decline is caused also by a transition in values; not just because of the availability of contraceptives.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt;
* During stage four there are both low birth rates and low death rates. Birth rates may drop to well below replacement level as has happened in countries like [[Germany]], [[Italy]], and [[Japan]], leading to a [[population decline|shrinking population]], a threat to many industries that rely on population growth. As the large group born during stage two ages, it creates an economic burden on the shrinking working population. Death rates may remain consistently low or increase slightly due to increases in lifestyle diseases due to low exercise levels and high [[obesity]] and an aging population in [[developed countries]]. By the late 20th century, birth rates and death rates in developed countries leveled off at lower rates.&lt;ref name="geography.about.com"/&gt;
* Some scholars break out, from stage four, a "stage five" of below-replacement fertility levels. Others hypothesize a different "stage five" involving an increase in fertility.&lt;ref name=bbc_sure/&gt;

As with all models, this is an idealized picture of population change in these countries. The model is a generalization that applies to these countries as a group and may not accurately describe all individual cases. The extent to which it applies to less-developed societies today remains to be seen. Many countries such as [[China]], [[Brazil]] and [[Thailand]] have passed through the Demographic Transition Model (DTM) very quickly due to fast social and economic change. Some countries, particularly African countries, appear to be stalled in the second stage due to stagnant development and the effect of [[AIDS]].

==Stage One==
In pre-industrial society, death rates and birth rates were both high, and fluctuated rapidly according to natural events, such as drought and disease, to produce a relatively constant and young population. Family planning and contraception were virtually nonexistent; therefore, birth rates were essentially only limited by the ability of women to bear children. Emigration depressed death rates in some special cases (for example, Europe and particularly the Eastern United States during the 19th century), but, overall, death rates tended to match birth rates, often exceeding 40 per 1000 per year. Children contributed to the economy of the household from an early age by carrying water, firewood, and messages, caring for younger siblings, sweeping, washing dishes,  preparing food, and working in the fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geographyfieldwork.com/DemographicTransition.htm|title=Demographic Transition Model|website=geographyfieldwork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raising a child cost little more than feeding him or her; there were no education or entertainment expenses.  Thus, the total [[Cost of raising a child|cost of raising children]] barely exceeded their contribution to the household.  In addition, as they became adults they become a major input to the family business, mainly farming, and were the primary form of insurance for adults in old age.  In India, an adult son was all that prevented a widow from falling into destitution.  While death rates remained high there was no question as to the need for children, even if the means to prevent them had existed.&lt;ref name=Caldwell5&gt;Caldwell (2006), Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;

During this stage, the society evolves in accordance with [[Malthusian growth model|Malthusian]] paradigm, with population essentially determined by the food supply. Any fluctuations in food supply (either positive, for example, due to technology improvements, or negative, due to droughts and pest invasions) tend to translate directly into population fluctuations. [[Famine]]s resulting in significant mortality are frequent. Overall, [[population dynamics]] during stage one are comparable to those of animals living in the wild. According to Edward, Revocatus. (2016) This is the earlier stage of demographic transition in the world and also characterized by primary activities such as small fishing activities, farming practices, pastoralism and petty businesses.

==Stage Two==
[[File:Population curve.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|right|World population 10,000 BC-2017 AD]]
This stage leads to a fall in death rates and an increase in population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/geography/population/popchangestructurerev5.shtml BBC bitesize] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023172810/http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/geography/population/popchangestructurerev5.shtml |date=October 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The changes leading to this stage in Europe were initiated in the [[British Agricultural Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] of the 18th century and were initially quite slow.  In the 20th century, the falls in death rates in developing countries tended to be substantially faster.  Countries in this stage include [[Yemen]], [[Afghanistan]], the [[Palestinian territories]] and [[Iraq]] and much of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (but do not include [[South Africa]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Botswana]], [[Swaziland]], [[Lesotho]], [[Namibia]], [[Kenya]], [[Gabon]] and [[Ghana]], which have begun to move into stage 3).&lt;ref name=Caldwell10&gt;Caldwell (2006), Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline in the death rate is due initially to two factors:
*First, improvements in the food supply brought about by higher yields in agricultural practices and better transportation reduce death due to starvation and lack of water.  Agricultural improvements included [[crop rotation]], [[selective breeding]], and [[seed drill]] technology.
*Second, significant improvements in public health reduce mortality, particularly in childhood. These are not so many medical breakthroughs (Europe passed through stage two before the advances of the mid-20th century, although there was significant medical progress in the 19th century, such as the development of [[vaccination]]) as they are improvements in water supply, [[sanitary sewer|sewerage]], food handling, and general personal [[hygiene]] following from growing scientific knowledge of the causes of disease and the improved education and social status of mothers.

A consequence of the decline in mortality in Stage Two is an increasingly rapid growth in population growth (a.k.a. "[[population explosion]]") as the gap between deaths and births grows wider and wider. Note that this growth is not due to an increase in fertility (or birth rates) but to a decline in deaths. This change in population occurred in north-western Europe during the 19th century due to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. During the second half of the 20th century less-developed countries entered Stage Two, creating the worldwide rapid growth of number of living persons that has demographers concerned today. In this stage of DT, countries are vulnerable to become [[Failed States Index|failed states]] in the absence of progressive governments.

[[File:Angola population pyramid 2005.svg|right|upright=1.7|thumb| [[Population pyramid]] of [[Angola]] 2005]]
Another characteristic of Stage Two of the demographic transition is a change in the [[population pyramid|age structure]] of the population. In Stage One, the majority of deaths are concentrated in the first 5&amp;ndash;10 years of life. Therefore, more than anything else, the decline in death rates in Stage Two entails the increasing survival of children and a growing population. Hence, the age structure of the population becomes increasingly youthful and start to have big families and more of these children enter the reproductive cycle of their lives while maintaining the high fertility rates of their parents. The bottom of the "[[population pyramid|age pyramid]]" widens first where children, teenagers and infants are here, accelerating population growth rate. The age structure of such a population is illustrated by using an example from the [[Third World]] today.

==Stage Three==
In Stage 3 of the Demographic Transition Model (DTM), death rates are low and birth rates diminish, as a rule accordingly of enhanced economic conditions, an expansion in women’s status and education, and access to contraception. The decrease in birth rate fluctuates from nation to nation, as does the time span in which it is experienced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.populationeducation.org/content/stage-3-demographic-transition-model|title=Stage 3 of the Demographic Transition Model - Population Education|date=16 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stage Three moves the population towards stability through a decline in the birth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = UWC | url = http://pages.uwc.edu/keith.montgomery/Demotrans/demtran.htm | series = Marathon | title = Geography | contribution = Demographic transition}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[fertility factor (demography)|fertility factor]]s contribute to this eventual decline, and are generally similar to [[Sub-replacement fertility#Causes|those associated with sub-replacement fertility]], although some are speculative:
*In rural areas continued decline in childhood death means that at some point parents realize they need not require so many children to be born to ensure a comfortable old age. As childhood death continues to fall and incomes increase parents can become increasingly confident that fewer children will suffice to help in family business and care for them in old age.
*Increasing [[urbanization]] changes the traditional values placed upon fertility and the value of children in rural society. Urban living also raises the cost of dependent children to a family. A recent theory suggests that urbanization also contributes to reducing the birth rate because it disrupts optimal mating patterns. A 2008 study in Iceland found that the most fecund marriages are between distant cousins. Genetic incompatibilities inherent in more distant outbreeding makes reproduction harder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Kissing cousins, missing children | url = http://www.economist.com/node/10640683?story_id=10640683 | journal= The Economist | date = 7 February 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In both rural and urban areas, the cost of children to parents is exacerbated by the introduction of compulsory education acts and the increased need to educate children so they can take up a respected position in society.  Children are increasingly prohibited under law from working outside the household and make an increasingly limited contribution to the household, as school children are increasingly exempted from the expectation of making a significant contribution to domestic work.  Even in equatorial Africa, children (age under 5) now required to have clothes and shoes, through the body, and may even require school uniforms. Parents begin to consider it a duty to buy children(s) books and toys,  partly due to education and access to family planning, people begin to reassess their need for children and their ability to grow them.&lt;ref name=Caldwell5/&gt;
[[File:Familyplanningmalaysia.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|A major factor in reducing birth rates in stage&amp;nbsp;3 countries such as Malaysia is the availability of family planning facilities, like this one in Kuala Terengganu, Terengganu, Malaysia.]]
*Increasing literacy and employment lowers the uncritical acceptance of childbearing and motherhood as measures of the status of women. Working women have less time to raise children; this is particularly an issue where fathers traditionally make little or no contribution to child-raising, such as [[southern Europe]] or [[Japan]].  Valuation of women beyond childbearing and motherhood becomes important.
*Improvements in contraceptive technology are now a major factor. Fertility decline is caused as much by changes in values about children and gender as by the availability of contraceptives and knowledge of how to use them.

The resulting changes in the age structure of the population include a decline in the youth [[dependency ratio]] and eventually [[population aging]]. The population structure becomes less triangular and more like an elongated balloon. During the period between the decline in youth dependency and rise in old age dependency there is a [[demographic window]] of opportunity that can potentially produce economic growth through an increase in the ratio of working age to dependent population; the [[demographic dividend]].

However, unless factors such as those listed above are allowed to work, a society's birth rates may not drop to a low level in due time, which means that the society cannot proceed to stage Three and is locked in what is called a [[demographic trap]].

Countries that have witnessed a fertility decline of over 50% from their pre-transition levels include: [[Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador]], [[Panama]], [[Jamaica]], [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guyana]], [[Philippines]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Turkey]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tunisia]], [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], [[Lebanon]], [[South Africa]], [[India]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and many [[Pacific islands]].

Countries that have experienced a fertility decline of 25–50% include: [[Demographics of Guatemala|Guatemala]], [[Demographics of Tajikistan|Tajikistan]], [[Demographics of Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Demographics of Zimbabwe| Zimbabwe]].

Countries that have experienced a fertility decline of less than 25% include: [[Demographics of Sudan|Sudan]], [[Demographics of Niger|Niger]], [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]].

==Stage Four==
This occurs where birth and death rates are both low, leading to a total population stable. Death rates are low for a number of reasons, primarily lower rates of diseases and higher production of food. The birth rate is low because people have more opportunities to choose if they want children; this is made possible by improvements in contraception or women gaining more independence and work opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.main-vision.com/richard/demographic.htm | title = Main vision | first =  | contribution = Demographic}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The DTM is only a suggestion about the future population levels of a country, not a prediction.

Countries that are at this stage (2 &lt; [[Total Fertility Rate]] &lt; 2.5 in 2015) include: Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cabo Verde, El Salvador, Faroe Islands, Grenada, Guam, India, Indonesia, Kosovo, Libya, Malaysia, Maldives, Mexico, Myanmar, Nepal, New Caledonia, Nicaragua, Palau, Peru, Seychelles, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Tunisia, Turkey and Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN|title=Fertility rate, total (births per woman) - Data|website=data.worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stage Five==
{{See also|Population aging|Aging of Europe|Aging of Japan|Evolutionary psychology}}[[File:World population (UN).svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|United Nation's population projections by location.&lt;br&gt;
Note the vertical axis is [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] and represents millions of people.]]
The original Demographic Transition model has just four stages, but additional stages have been proposed. Both more-fertile and less-fertile futures have been claimed as a Stage Five.

Some countries have [[sub-replacement fertility]] (that is, below 2.1–2.2 children per woman). Replacement fertility is generally slightly higher than 2 (the level which replaces the two parents) both because boys are born more often than girls (about 1.05–1.1 to 1) and to compensate for deaths prior to full reproduction. Many European and East Asian countries now have higher death rates than birth rates. [[Population aging]] and [[population decline]] may eventually occur, assuming that the fertility rate does not change and sustained mass immigration does not occur.

In an article in the August 2009 issue of ''Nature'', Myrskylä, Kohler and [[Francesco Billari]] argue that the previously negative relationship between "development", as measured by the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI), and birth rates has become J-shaped. The HDI is a composite of life expectancy, income, and level of education. Development promotes fertility decline at HDI levels below 0.9 but further advances in HDI cause a small rebound in birth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7256/full/nature08230.html | last1 = Myrskyla | first1 = M | last2 = Kohler | first2 = H-P | last3 = Billari | first3 = F | title= Advances in development reverse fertility declines | journal= Nature | volume = 460 | issue = 7256 | pages = 741–43 | date = 6 August 2009| bibcode = 2009Natur.460..741M | doi = 10.1038/nature08230 | pmid=19661915}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries with very high levels of development, fertility rates are now approaching two children per woman — although there are exceptions, notably Germany, Italy and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= The best of all possible worlds? | work = The Economist | date = 6 August 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the current century, most developed countries have increased fertility. From the point of view of [[evolutionary biology]], wealthier people having fewer children is unexpected, as [[natural selection]] would be expected to favor individuals who are willing and able to convert plentiful resources into plentiful fertile descendants. This may be the result of a departure from the [[Evolutionary psychology#Environment of evolutionary adaptedness|environment of evolutionary adaptedness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = Alice L. | last2 = Low | first2 = Bobbi S. | year = 2001 | title = Testing evolutionary hypotheses with demographic data | url = | journal = Population and Development Review | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 633–660 | doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2001.00633.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Daly |first1=Martin |last2=Wilson |first2=Margo I |title=Human evolutionary psychology and animal behaviour |url=http://courses.washington.edu/evpsych/Daly%26Wilson-HEP-AB1999.pdf |publisher=Department of Psychology, McMaster University |accessdate=14 November 2018 |date=26 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, from the perspective of [[evolutionary psychology]], the modern environment is exerting [[evolutionary pressure]] for higher fertility.&lt;ref name=bbc_sure /&gt;

[[Jane Falkingham]] of [[Southampton University]] has noted that "We've actually got population projections wrong consistently over the last 50 years... we've underestimated the improvements in mortality... but also we've not been very good at spotting the trends in fertility."&lt;ref name=bbc_sure /&gt; In 2004 a United Nations office published its guesses for global population in the year 2300; estimates ranged from a "low estimate" of 2.3 billion (tending to −0.32% per year) to a "high estimate" of 36.4 billion (tending to +0.54% per year), which were contrasted with a deliberately "unrealistic" illustrative "constant fertility" scenario of 134 trillion (obtained if 1995–2000 fertility rates stay constant into the far future).&lt;ref name=bbc_sure /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Population to 2300|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/WorldPop2300final.pdf|publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|accessdate=24 May 2016|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In stage 5 of the demographic transition, a country encounters misfortune as a whole this is because the death rate becomes higher than the birth rate. There will be a negative population growth rate which will affect the country. This will take a generation or two before the population grows back up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.populationeducation.org/content/stage-5-demographic-transition-model|title=Stage 5 of the Demographic Transition Model - Population Education|date=18 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on age structure==
[[File:Dtm pyramids.png|thumb|upright=1.4|One such visualization of this effect may be approximated by these hypothetical population pyramids.  ]]
The decline in death rate and birth rate that occurs during the demographic transition may transform the age structure. When the death rate declines during the second stage of the transition, the result is primarily an increase in the child population. The reason being that when the death rate is high (stage one), the infant mortality rate is very high, often above 200 deaths per 1000 children born. When the death rate falls or improves, this may include lower infant mortality rate and increased child survival. Over time, as individuals with increased survival rates age, there may also be an increase in the number of older children, teenagers, and young adults. This implies that there is an increase in the fertile population proportion which, with constant fertility rates, may lead to an increase in the number of children born. This will further increase the growth of the child population. The second stage of the demographic transition, therefore, implies a rise in child dependency and creates a youth bulge in the population structure.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Population: An Introduction to Concepts and Issues|last=Weeks|first=John R.|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2014|isbn=978-1-305-09450-5|location=|pages=94–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a population continues to move through the demographic transition into the third stage, fertility declines and the youth bulge prior to the decline ages out of child dependency into the working ages. This stage of the transition is often referred to as the golden age, and is typically when populations see the greatest advancements in living standards and economic development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, further declines in both mortality and fertility will eventually result in an aging population, and a rise in the aged dependency ratio. An increase of the aged dependency ratio often indicates that a population has reached below replacement levels of fertility, and as result does not have enough people in the working ages to support the economy, and the growing dependent population. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Historical studies==

===Britain===
Between 1750 and 1975 England experienced the transition from high levels of both mortality and fertility, to low levels. A major factor was the sharp decline in the death rate due to infectious diseases, which has fallen from about 11 per 1,000 to less than 1 per 1,000.  By contrast, the death rate from other causes was 12 per 1,000 in 1850 and has not declined markedly. The agricultural revolution and the development of transport, initiated by the construction of canals, led to greater availability of food and coal, and enabled the [[Industrial Revolution]] to improve the standard of living. Scientific discoveries and medical breakthroughs did not, in general, contribute importantly to the early major decline in infectious disease mortality.

===Ireland===
In the 1980s and early 1990s, the Irish demographic status converged to the European norm.  Mortality rose above the European Community average, and in 1991 Irish fertility fell to replacement level. The peculiarities of Ireland's past demography and its recent rapid changes challenge established theory. The recent changes have mirrored inward changes in Irish society, with respect to family planning, women in the work force, the sharply declining power of the Catholic Church, and the emigration factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = DA | last = Coleman | title= The Demographic Transition in Ireland in International Context | journal= Proceedings of the British Academy | year = 1992 | issue = 79 | pages = 53–77}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
France displays real divergences from the standard model of Western demographic evolution.  The uniqueness of the French case arises from its specific demographic history, its historic cultural values, and its internal regional dynamics. France's demographic transition was unusual in that the mortality and the natality decreased at the same time, thus there was no demographic boom in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Quand l'Angleterre rattrapait la France |journal=Population &amp; Societes |date=May 1999 |issue=346 |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Demographic_transition&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12 |accessdate=14 November 2018 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France's demographic profile is similar to its European neighbors and to developed countries in general, yet it seems to be staving off the population decline of Western countries. With 62.9 million inhabitants in 2006, it was the second most populous country in the European Union, and it displayed a certain demographic dynamism, with a growth rate of 2.4% between 2000 and 2005, above the European average. More than two-thirds of that growth can be ascribed to a natural increase resulting from high fertility and birthrates. In contrast, France is one of the developed nations whose migratory balance is rather weak, which is an original feature at the European level. Several interrelated reasons account for such singularities, in particular the impact of pro-family policies accompanied by greater unmarried households and out-of-wedlock births. These general demographic trends parallel equally important changes in regional demographics. Since 1982 the same significant tendencies have occurred throughout mainland France: demographic stagnation in the least-populated rural regions and industrial regions in the northeast, with strong growth in the southwest and along the Atlantic coast, plus dynamism in metropolitan areas. Shifts in population between regions account for most of the differences in growth. The varying demographic evolution regions can be analyzed though the filter of several parameters, including residential facilities, economic growth, and urban dynamism, which yield several distinct regional profiles. The distribution of the French population therefore seems increasingly defined not only by interregional mobility but also by the residential preferences of individual households. These challenges, linked to configurations of population and the dynamics of distribution, inevitably raise the issue of town and country planning. The most recent census figures show that an outpouring of the urban population means that fewer rural areas are continuing to register a negative migratory flow – two-thirds of rural communities have shown some since 2000. The spatial demographic expansion of large cities amplifies the process of peri-urbanization yet is also accompanied by movement of selective residential flow, social selection, and sociospatial segregation based on income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Guy | last1 = Baudelle | first2 = David | last2 = Olivier | title= Changement Global, Mondialisation et Modèle De Transition Démographique: réflexion sur une exception française parmi les pays développés | journal= Historiens et Géographes | year = 2006 | volume = 98 | issue = 395 | pages = 177–204 | issn = 0046-757X | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
McNicoll (2006) examines the common features behind the striking changes in health and fertility in East and Southeast Asia in the 1960s–1990’s, focusing on seven countries: Taiwan and South Korea ("tiger" economies), Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia ("second wave" countries), and China and Vietnam ("market-Leninist" economies). Demographic change can be seen as a byproduct of social and economic development together with, in some cases, strong governmental pressures. The transition sequence entailed the establishment of an effective, typically authoritarian, system of local administration, providing a framework for promotion and service delivery in health, education, and family planning.  Subsequent economic liberalization offered new opportunities for upward mobility — and risks of backsliding —, accompanied by the erosion of social capital and the breakdown or privatization of service programs.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

====Korea====
Cha (2007) analyzes a panel data set to explore how industrial revolution, demographic transition, and human capital accumulation interacted in Korea from 1916–38. Income growth and public investment in health caused mortality to fall, which suppressed fertility and promoted education. Industrialization, skill premium, and closing gender wage gap further induced parents to opt for child quality. Expanding demand for education was accommodated by an active public school building program. The interwar agricultural depression aggravated traditional income inequality, raising fertility and impeding the spread of mass schooling. Landlordism collapsed in the wake of de-colonization, and the consequent reduction in inequality accelerated human and physical capital accumulation, hence leading to growth in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Myung | first = Soo Cha | title = Industrial Revolution, Demographic Transition, and Human Capital Accumulation in Korea, 1916–38 | publisher = Naksungdae Institute of Economic Research | type = working Paper | date = July 2007 | url = http://www.naksung.re.kr/papers/wp2007-7.pdf | format = PDF | place = KR}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Madagascar===
Campbell has studied the demography of 19th-century Madagascar in the light of demographic transition theory. Both supporters and critics of the theory hold to an intrinsic opposition between human and "natural" factors, such as climate, famine, and disease, influencing demography. They also suppose a sharp chronological divide between the precolonial and colonial eras, arguing that whereas "natural" demographic influences were of greater importance in the former period, human factors predominated thereafter. Campbell argues that in 19th-century Madagascar the human factor, in the form of the [[Merina Kingdom|Merina state]], was the predominant demographic influence. However, the impact of the state was felt through natural forces, and it varied over time. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries Merina state policies stimulated agricultural production, which helped to create a larger and healthier population and laid the foundation for Merina military and economic expansion within Madagascar. From 1820, the cost of such expansionism led the state to increase its exploitation of forced labor at the expense of agricultural production and thus transformed it into a negative demographic force.  Infertility and infant mortality, which were probably more significant influences on overall population levels than the adult mortality rate, increased from 1820 due to disease, malnutrition, and stress, all of which stemmed from state forced labor policies. Available estimates indicate little if any population growth for Madagascar between 1820 and 1895. The demographic "crisis" in Africa, ascribed by critics of the demographic transition theory to the colonial era, stemmed in Madagascar from the policies of the imperial Merina regime, which in this sense formed a link to the French regime of the colonial era. Campbell thus questions the underlying assumptions governing the debate about historical demography in Africa and suggests that the demographic impact of political forces be reevaluated in terms of their changing interaction with "natural" demographic influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Gwyn | last1 = Campbell | title= State and Pre-colonial Demographic History: the Case of Nineteenth-century Madagascar | journal= Journal of African History | year = 1991 | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 415–45 |  issn = 0021-8537 | doi=10.1017/s0021853700031534}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia entered stage two of the transition in the 18th century, simultaneously with the rest of Europe, though the effect of transition remained limited to a modest decline in death rates and steady population growth. The population of Russia nearly quadrupled during the 19th century, from 30 million to 133 million, and continued to grow until the First World War and the turmoil that followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tacitus.nu/historical-atlas/population/russia.htm|title=Population of Eastern Europe|date=|website=tacitus.nu|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia then quickly transitioned through stage three. Though fertility rates rebounded initially and almost reached 7 children/woman in the mid-1920s, they were depressed by the 1931–33 famine, crashed due to the Second World War in 1941, and only rebounded to a sustained level of 3 children/woman after the war. By 1970 Russia was firmly in stage four, with crude birth rates and crude death rates on the order of 15/1000 and 9/1000 respectively.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Russia underwent a unique demographic transition; observers call it a "demographic catastrophe": the number of deaths exceeded the number of births, life expectancy fell sharply (especially for males) and the number of suicides increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-first = George J | editor-last = Demko | others = et al | title = Population under Duress: The Geodemography of Post-Soviet Russia | year = 1999 | url = https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=91465272 | publisher = Questia}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1992 through 2011, the number of deaths exceeded the number of births.

=== United States ===
Greenwood and Seshadri (2002) show that from 1800 to 1940 there was a [[demographic shift]] from a mostly rural US population with high fertility, with an average of seven children born per white woman, to a minority (43%) rural population with low fertility, with an average of two births per white woman. This shift resulted from technological progress. A sixfold increase in real wages made children more expensive in terms of forgone opportunities to work and increases in agricultural productivity reduced rural demand for labor, a substantial portion of which traditionally had been performed by children in farm families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The U.S. Demographic Transition|last=Greenwood |first=Jeremy |last2=Seshadri |first2=Ananth|date=January 2002|ssrn = 297952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simplification of the DTM theory proposes an initial decline in mortality followed by a later drop in fertility. The changing demographics of the U.S. in the last two centuries did not parallel this model. Beginning around 1800, there was a sharp fertility decline; at this time, an average woman usually produced seven births per lifetime, but by 1900 this number had dropped to nearly four. A mortality decline was not observed in the U.S. until almost 1900—a hundred years following the drop in fertility.

However, this late decline occurred from a very low initial level. During the 17th and 18th centuries, crude death rates in much of colonial North America ranged from 15 to 25 deaths per 1000 residents per year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Population History of the United States|author= Herbert S. Klein|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Population History of North America|author1= Michael R. Haines |author2=Richard H. Steckel|pages=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; (levels of up to 40 per 1000 being typical during stages one and two). Life expectancy at birth was on the order of 40 and, in some places, reached 50, and a resident of 18th century Philadelphia who reached age 20 could have expected, on average, additional 40 years of life.

This phenomenon is explained by the pattern of colonization of the United States. Sparsely populated interior of the country allowed ample room to accommodate all the "excess" people, counteracting mechanisms (spread of communicable diseases due to overcrowding, low real wages and insufficient calories per capita due to the limited amount of available agricultural land) which led to high mortality in the Old World. With low mortality but stage 1 birth rates, the United States necessarily experienced exponential population growth (from less than 4 million people in 1790, to 23 million in 1850, to 76 million in 1900.)

The only area where this pattern did not hold was the American South. High prevalence of deadly endemic diseases such as malaria kept mortality as high as 45–50 per 1000 residents per year in 18th century North Carolina. In [[New Orleans]], mortality remained so high (mainly due to [[yellow fever]]) that the city was characterized as the "death capital of the United States" – at the level of 50 per 1000 population or higher – well into the second half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael R. |last=Haines |title=The Urban Mortality Transition in the United States, 1800–1940 |journal=NBER Historical Working Paper No. 134 |date=July 2001 |doi=10.3386/h0134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the U.S. is recognized as having both low fertility and mortality rates. Specifically, birth rates stand at 14 per 1000 per year and death rates at 8 per 1000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html#People | title = World factbook | contribution = US | publisher = CIA | place = USA}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical evaluation==
[[File:Years-it-took-Fertility-to-fall-from-6-to-below-3.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Countries with lower economic development have much faster demographic transition than high-income countries.]]
It must be remembered that the DTM is only a model and cannot necessarily predict the future. It does however give an indication of what the future birth and death rates may be for an underdeveloped country, together with the total population size. Most particularly, of course, the DTM makes no comment on change in population due to migration. It is not applicable for high levels of development, as it has been shown that after a [[Human Development Index|HDI]] of 0.9 the fertility increases again.&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt;

DTM does not account for recent phenomena such as [[AIDS]]; in these areas HIV has become the leading source of mortality.  Some trends in waterborne bacterial infant mortality are also disturbing in countries like [[Malawi]], [[Sudan]] and [[Nigeria]]; for example, progress in the DTM clearly arrested and reversed between 1975 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.populationaction.org/resources/researchCommentaries/Nov06_AgeStructure.htm | contribution = Nigeria: Reversal of Demographic Transition | title = Population action | date = November 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

DTM assumes that population changes are induced by industrial changes and increased wealth, without taking into account the role of social change in determining birth rates, e.g., the education of women. In recent decades more work has been done on developing the social mechanisms behind it.&lt;ref name=Caldwell/&gt;

DTM assumes that the birth rate is independent of the death rate. Nevertheless, demographers maintain that there is no historical evidence for society-wide fertility rates rising significantly after high mortality events. Notably, some historic populations have taken many years to replace lives after events such as the [[Black Death]].

Some have claimed that DTM does not explain the early fertility declines in much of Asia in the second half of the 20th century or the delays in fertility decline in parts of the Middle East.  Nevertheless, the demographer [[John Caldwell (demographer)|John C Caldwell]] has suggested that the reason for the rapid decline in fertility in some [[developing country|developing countries]] compared to Western Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand is mainly due to government programs and a massive investment in education both by governments and parents.&lt;ref name=Caldwell10/&gt;

==Second demographic transition==
The Second Demographic Transition (SDT) is a conceptual framework first formulated in 1986 by Ron Lesthaeghe and Dirk van de Kaa in a short article that was published in the Dutch sociology journal ''Mens en Maatschappij''.&lt;ref name="Lesthaeghe_2011"&gt;{{citation |author=Ron J.

Combined with the [[sexual revolution]] and the increased role of women in society and the workforce the resulting changes have profoundly affected the demographics of industrialized countries resulting in a [[sub-replacement fertility]] level.&lt;ref name="Kaa012902"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Dirk J. van de Kaa|title=The Idea of a Second Demographic Transition in Industrialized Countries|date=29 January 2002|url=http://websv.ipss.go.jp/webj-ad/WebJournal.files/population/2003_4/Kaa.pdf|accessdate=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The changes, increased numbers of women choosing to not marry or have children, increased cohabitation outside marriage, increased childbearing by single mothers, increased participation by women in higher education and professional careers, and other changes are associated with increased individualism and autonomy, particularly of women. Motivations have changed from traditional and economic ones to those of self-realization.&lt;ref name="PNAC122314"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ron Lesthaeghe|title=The second demographic transition: A concise overview of its development|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=December 23, 2014 |volume=111|issue=51|pages=18112–18115|doi=10.1073/pnas.1420441111|pmid=25453112|pmc=4280616|bibcode=2014PNAS..11118112L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Nicholas Eberstadt, political economist at the [[American Enterprise Institute]] in Washington, described the Second Demographic Transition as one in which "long, stable marriages are out, and divorce or separation are in, along with serial cohabitation and increasingly contingent liaisons."&lt;ref name="WSJ_Eberstadt_2015"&gt;{{citation |quote=‘They’re getting divorced, and they’ll do anything NOT to get custody of the kids.” So reads the promotional poster, in French, for a new movie, “Papa ou Maman"|title=The Global Flight From the Family: It's not only in the West or prosperous nations—the decline in marriage and drop in birth rates is rampant, with potentially dire fallout |author=Nicholas Eberstadt |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/nicholas-eberstadt-the-global-flight-from-the-family-1424476179|date=February 21, 2015 |accessdate=February 26, 2017 |publisher=''Wall Street Journal'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5670">The '''direct historical approach''' to [[archaeology]] was a methodology developed in the [[United States of America]] during the 1920s-1930s by William Duncan Strong and others, which argued that knowledge relating to historical periods is extended back into earlier times. This methodology involves taking an archaeological site that has historical accounts relating to recent periods of occupation and then excavating it to establish continuity back into prehistoric times. The historical data then becomes the basis of [[analogy]] and [[homology (anthropology)|homology]] for the study of the [[prehistoric communities]] at both the particular site and other sites in the region. The main issue with the approach is that in many parts of the world there is no direct continuity between historically documented communities and the prehistoric occupants of the region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archaeologywordsmith.com/lookup.php?category=&amp;where=headword&amp;terms=direct+historical+approach&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the nineteenth century, the archaeological record of [[the Americas]] was viewed as an extension into the past of the [[ethnographical]]ly documented record. Human behaviors of the archaeological past were seen as nearly identical to those described ethnographically and thus, they could be studied with minimal training in archaeology. The result of this particular view was the development and regular use of what came to be known as the direct historical approach.

Roland B. Dixon was seen as an early proponent of this approach. In his presidential address to the [[American Anthropological Association]] he stated: “one would logically proceed to investigate a [number of sites of known ethnic affiliation], and work back from these,” because it “is only through the known that we can comprehend the unknown, only from a study of the present that we can understand the past.” Strong, who later became attributed to this particular methodology, argued that Dixon set forth the procedure of the direct historical approach. Strong would later go on to say that “once the archeological criteria of [a historically documented] culture had been determined, it [is] then possible to advance from the known and historic into the unknown and prehistoric.”&lt;ref&gt;http://cladistics.coas.missouri.edu/pdf_articles/JAMT8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Oddly, the direct historical approach rarely appears in histories of American anthropology. Similarly, very few texts point out that the direct historical approach was used for three distinct purposes. In American archaeology these were: (1) to identify the cultural association of an archaeological manifestation; (2) to construct relative chronologies of archaeological materials; and (3) to understand the human behaviors that were thought to have produced particular portions of the archaeological record.

==The Direct Historical Approach as a Cultural Identifier==
After the peak of the direct historical approach, Willey wrote about its use as a means of assigning [[ethnic identity]] to archaeological phenomena. He explained: “through a series of successive periods prehistoric cultures were linked to [[proto-historic]], historic, and modern descendants. This type of study, sometimes called the ‘direct historical approach,’ has a theoretical basis in cultural continuity. Starting with known, documented habitation sites, certain cultural assemblages were identified and associated with particular tribal groups. Earlier archaeological assemblages were then sought which were not too sharply divergent from the known historic ones, and the procedure was followed backwards in time…The establishment of prehistoric-to-historic continuity is of utmost importance as a springboard for further archaeological interpretation, and, along with general chronological and distributive studies, it is one of the primary historical problems for the American archaeologist.”&lt;ref&gt;http://cladistics.coas.missouri.edu/pdf_articles/JAMT8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Most famously, Cyrus Thomas used the reasoning of the direct historical approach to demonstrate that various earthworks scattered across the eastern and midwestern portions of America (mounds) were produced by the direct genetic and cultural ancestors of historically documented ethnic groups (the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]]).

==The Direct Historical Approach in Establishing Chronology==
In much the same way that the direct historical approach was used to demonstrate ancestor-descendant relationships, it was also used to measure the passage of time (also called chronology). This process involves creating time-based sequences of artifacts by starting with a list of cultural traits related to specific artifact types and then working into the past by determining which traits/artifact types were held by archaeologically represented cultures. Through this theoretical sorting, one can study more than ethnic identification by establishing time-based sequences. After ethnic identification and chronology has been established, the direct historical approach becomes the basis of analogy.&lt;ref&gt;http://cladistics.coas.missouri.edu/pdf_articles/JAMT8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues with the Direct Historical Approach==
There are large parts of the world that are without direct continuity between historically documented communities and the prehistoric occupants of the region. Without this connection, the direct historical approach lacks purpose and is unable to enhance archaeological study. If this is the case, archaeologists rely on other archaeological theories and methods.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="837">'''Eidonomy''' is the study of the external appearance of an [[organism]]. It is thus the opposite of [[anatomy]], which refers to internal [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]].l
While predominant early in the [[history of biology]] it is little studied in particular anymore as it is rife with the effects of [[convergent evolution]]. It thus yields less new information about organisms than anatomy, and therefore the external appearance of lifeforms is usually studied as part of general investigations in morphology, e.g. in the context of [[phylogenetic]] research.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;'''Environmental niche modelling''', alternatively known as '''species distribution modelling''', '''(ecological) niche modelling''', '''predictive habitat distribution modelling''', and '''climate envelope modelling''' refers to the process of using [[computer]] [[algorithm]]s to predict the distribution of species in [[geography|geographic]] space on the basis of a mathematical representation of their known distribution in [[Natural environment|environmental]] space (= realized [[ecological niche]]). The environment is in most cases represented by climate data (such as temperature, and precipitation), but other variables such as soil type, water depth, and land cover can also be used. These models allow for interpolating between a limited number of species occurrence and they are used in several research areas in [[conservation biology]], [[ecology]] and [[evolution]].

The extent to which such modelled data reflect real-world species distributions will depend on a number of factors, including the nature, complexity, and accuracy of the models used and the quality of the available environmental data layers; the availability of sufficient and reliable species distribution data as model input; and the influence of various factors such as barriers to [[biological dispersal|dispersal]], geologic history, or [[biotic interaction]]s, that increase the difference between the [[realized niche]] and the fundamental niche. Environmental niche modelling may be considered a part of the discipline of [[biodiversity informatics]].

== Correlative vs mechanistic models ==
Environmental niche models are in origin correlative models. Given a handful of geographically-referred observed presences of a species and climate maps, they find the most likely environmental ranges where a species lives. For these algorithms to be effective, it is required to also gather observations of absences, that is, where the species does not live. Records of species absences are typically not as common as records of presences, thus often "random background" or "pseudo-absence" data are used to fit these models. Disagreement in the literature exists over whether environmental niche models portray the [[realized niche]], which is the environments where a species '''is''' found or the [[fundamental niche]], which is where a species '''can''' be found, that is, where the abiotic environment is appropriate for the survival of a species. If there are incomplete records of the occurrences of a species, there is a bias introduced by pseudo-absences, or the species is geographically confined due to dispersal limitations, environmental niche models might often reflect the [[realized niche]] instead of the [[fundamental niche]].

In contrast to correlative models, mechanistic (or process-based) models assess the bio-physiological aspects of a species to generate the conditions in which the species can ideally persist, based on observations made in controlled field or laboratory studies. As such it aims at modelling the fundamental niche of the species. See &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morin|first=X.|author2=Thuiller|title=Comparing niche- and process-based models to reduce prediction uncertainty in species range shifts under climate change.|journal=Ecology|year=2009|volume=90|issue=5|pages=1301–13|doi=10.1890/08-0134.1|pmid=19537550}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a comparison between mechanistic and correlative models.

== Niche modelling algorithms ==
Niche modelling algorithms include "profile methods", simple statistical techniques that use e.g. environmental distance to known sites such as [http://fennerschool.anu.edu.au/publications/software/anuclim/doc/bioclim.html BIOCLIM],&lt;ref name="Nix1986a"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nix HA|year=1986|title=BIOCLIM — a Bioclimatic Analysis and Prediction System|journal=Research report, CSIRO Division of Water and Land Resources|volume=1983–1985|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nix1986b"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nix HA|editor=Longmore|title=Atlas of Elapid Snakes of Australia. Australian Flora and Fauna Series 7|publisher=Bureau of Flora and Fauna, Canberra|year=1986|pages=4–15|chapter=A biogeographic analysis of Australian elapid snakes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and DOMAIN; "regression" (e.g. forms of generalized linear models); and "[[machine learning]]" methods such as [[Principle of maximum entropy|maximum entropy]] (MAXENT).  An incomplete list of algorithms that have been used for niche modelling includes:

===Profile techniques===
*[[BIOCLIM]]
*[[DOMAIN]]
*[[Ecological Niche Factor Analysis]] (ENFA)
*[[Mahalanobis distance]]

===Regression-based techniques===
*[[Generalized linear model]] (GLM)
*[[Generalized Additive Model]] (GAM)
*[[Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines]] (MARS)

===Machine learning techniques===
*[[MAXENT]]
*[[Artificial Neural Networks]] (ANN)
*[[Genetic Algorithm for Rule Set Production]] (GARP)
*[[Boosted Regression Trees]] (BRT)/Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
*[[Random Forest]] (RF)
*[[Support Vector Machines]] (SVM)

Furthermore, [[ensemble models]] can be created from several model outputs to create a model that captures components of each.  Often the mean or median value across several models is used as an ensemble.  Similarly, [[consensus models]] are models that fall closest to some measure of central tendency of all models—consensus models can be individual model runs or ensembles of several models.

== Niche modelling software ==
[[Image:Predicting habitats.png|right|300px|thumb|Example of simple niche modelling using rainfall, altitude and current species observations to create a model of possible existence for a certain species.]]

[https://adapt.nd.edu/groups/cem/wiki/SPACESTutorial SPACES] is an online Environmental niche modeling platform that allows users to design and run dozens of the most prominent algorithms in a high performance, multi-platform, browser-based environment.

[http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/ MaxEnt] is the most widely used method/software uses presence only data and performs well when there are few presence records available.

[http://gis.ucmerced.edu/ModEco/ ModEco] implements various algorithms.

[[DIVA-GIS]] has an easy to use (and good for educational use) implementation of BIOCLIM

[http://www.bccvl.org.au/ The Biodiversity and Climate Change Virtual Laboratory (BCCVL)] is a "one stop modelling shop" that simplifies the process of biodiversity and climate impact modelling. It connects the research community to Australia’s national computational infrastructure by integrating a suite of tools in a coherent online environment. Users can access global climate and environmental datasets or upload their own data, perform data analysis across six different experiment types with a suite of 17 different algorithms, and easily visualise, interpret and evaluate the results of the models. Experiments types include: Species Distribution Model, Multispecies Distribution Model, Species Trait Model (currently under development), Climate Change Projection, Biodiverse Analysis and Ensemble Analysis. Example of BCCVL SDM outputs can be found [https://support.bccvl.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000127046-interpretation-of-model-outputs/ here]

Most niche modelling algorithms are available in the R packages [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dismo/vignettes/sdm.pdf 'dismo'],  [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/biomod2/index.html 'biomod2'] and [https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/mopa 'mopa']..

Software developers may want to build on the [http://openmodeller.sourceforge.net/ openModeller] project.

The Collaboratory for Adaptation to Climate Change [https://adapt.nd.edu adapt.nd.edu] has implemented an [https://adapt.nd.edu/groups/cem/wiki/OpenmodellerTutorial online version of openModeller] that allows users to design and run openModeller in a high-performance, browser-based environment to allow for multiple parallel experiments without the limitations of local processor power.

The '''Fair Trade Certified Mark''' is a [[fair trade certification]] mark used in Canada and in the United States. It appears on products as an independent guarantee that disadvantaged producers in the developing world are getting a better deal. The Fair Trade Certified Mark is the North American equivalent of the [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]] used in Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. 

For a product to carry either Certification Marks, it must come from [[FLO-CERT]] inspected and certified producer organizations. The crops must be grown and harvested in accordance with the International Fairtrade standards set by [[FLO International]]. The supply chain is also monitored by [[FLO-CERT]] to ensure the integrity of labelled products. Only [[Fair Trade USA]] or [[Fairtrade Canada]] (formerly "TransFair USA" and "TransFair Canada," respectively) licensees can use the Fair Trade Certified Mark on their products, however a gradual phase-out of this mark began in Canada in 2011.

The Canadian Fair Trade Certified Mark was introduced by [[TransFair Canada]] on the Canadian market in 1997.

The American Fair Trade Certified Mark was introduced by [[TransFair USA]] on the American market in 1998.

In 2010, Canada began actively promoting both the Fair Trade Certified Mark and the [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]] as part of a transition process towards the latter, which became the primary Fairtrade Certification Mark in 2011.

In 2012 a variation of the US Fair Trade certification mark was adopted with the benefit of being registered globally as a trade mark. The mark is designed to pop better on the shelf through a far simpler design and the use of color. The one basket with outstretched hands indicates sharing and a "give and take" between producers and purchases. The green signals the environmental strength of Fair Trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtradeusa.org/sites/all/files/wysiwyg/filemanager/label/Fair-Trade-USA-FAQ-newcertificationmark.pdf|title=Certification Mark: Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Fair Trade USA|date=|accessdate=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the study of [[transsexualism]], the [[essentialism|essentialist]] idea of a '''feminine essence''' refers to the proposal that [[Trans woman|male-to-female transsexuals]] are females trapped in male bodies.  This idea has been interpreted in many senses, as a female mind, spirit, soul, personality, etc., as well as in more literal senses such as having a female brain structure; it is also a [[psychological narrative]], that is, a self-description of how some transsexuals see themselves, or of how they may portray themselves to qualify for certain medical treatments.

According to sexologist [[J. Michael Bailey]] and Kiira Triea, "the predominant cultural understanding of male-to-female transsexualism is that all male-to-female (MtF) transsexuals are, essentially, women trapped in men's bodies."  They reject the idea, claiming that "The persistence of the predominant cultural understanding, while explicable, is damaging to science and to many transsexuals."&lt;ref name=Bailey2007&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bailey J.

The great majority of patients understand full well that this is a ''[[wikt:façon de parler|façon de parler]],'' not a literal statement of fact, and are not delusional in any normal sense of the word."&lt;ref name="UTorontoRounds2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autogynephilia.org/psychiatry_rounds.pdf|title=Psychiatry Rounds: The case for and against publicly funded transsexual surgery|date=April 2000|publisher=Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto Centre for Addiction and Mental Health; Toronto, Ontario|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304092619/http://www.autogynephilia.org/psychiatry_rounds.pdf|archive-date=2012-03-04|volume=4|issue=2|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feminine essence idea has been described under several names, and there is no authoritative, widely accepted definition.&lt;ref name=Blanchard2008 /&gt;  It was called the ''feminine essence narrative'' by [[Alice Dreger]] in 2008,&lt;ref name=Dreger2008&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dreger AD |title=The Controversy Surrounding The Man Who Would Be Queen: A Case History of the Politics of Science, Identity, and Sex in the Internet Age |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=366–421 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18431641 |doi=10.1007/s10508-007-9301-1 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/0753m756162q4236/fulltext.pdf |pmc=3170124}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''feminine essence theory'' by Ray Blanchard, who formulated the concept into a set of logical propositions.&lt;ref name=Blanchard2008&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blanchard R |title=Deconstructing the feminine essence narrative |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=434–8; discussion 505–10 |date=June 2008 |pmid= 18431630|doi=10.1007/s10508-008-9328-y |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other names include ''[[Harry Benjamin]] syndrome'', after one of the early sexologists whose early writings about the nature of transsexualism, along with those of psychiatrist [[David O. Cauldwell]], are favorably cited by proponents in support of this idea.&lt;ref name="How Sex Changed"&gt;{{cite book

|quote=As the medical literature on transsexuals emerged, the doctors and scientists involved drew, as Ulrichs had, a distinction between the sex in the mind, as seen in the sense of self, and the sex in the body, as generally evidenced in the genitals.  Cauldwell referred to individuals who were "physically of one sex and apparently psychologically of the opposite sex."  Hamburger and his colleagues wrote of a "female personality in a male body" and the "feeling of being a woman."  Benjamin borrowed Ulrichs' formula of "a female soul'... in [a] male body."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea is associated with, but separate from the brainsex theory of transsexualism, which is a belief about a neurodevelopmental [[cause of transsexualism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey and Triea, 2007.  "The narrative has been extended to an etiological theory, which Lawrence (2007b) has called "the brainsex theory of transsexualism." The transsexual advocacy website, transsexual.org, puts this theory succinctly: 'A transsexual is a person in which the sex-related structures of the brain that define gender identity are exactly opposite the physical sex organs of the body.'"&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the brainsex theory of transsexualism draw a distinction between "brain sex" and "anatomical sex".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harrybenjaminsyndrome-nz.co.nz/ |title=Harry Benjamin Syndrome (HBS) |accessdate=6 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202040714/http://www.harrybenjaminsyndrome-nz.co.nz/ |archivedate=2 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some proponents reject the term ''transsexual'', as the ''[[:wikt:trans-|trans-]]'' prefix implies that their true sex is changing, instead of being affirmed, with treatments like [[sex reassignment surgery]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A figurative interpretation, involving neurologically mediated [[gender identity]], was supported historically by pioneering sexologists such as [[Harry Benjamin]].&lt;ref name=HBS /&gt;

==Description==

The "feminine essence" idea predates modern psychological studies,&lt;ref name="How Sex Changed" /&gt; and was supported by some early sexologists such as [[Harry Benjamin]] ("the father of transsexualism"), who revived the idea of [[Karl-Heinrich Ulrichs]] that a person might have a "female soul trapped in a male body."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern researchers classify the common story told by transsexual women about themselves as a [[psychological narrative]], and therefore refer to this idea as the "feminine essence narrative".  In his book ''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'', sexologist [[J. Michael Bailey]] gives these statements as a prototypical example of the feminine essence narrative:  "Since I can remember, I have always felt as if I were a member of the other sex. I have felt like a freak with this body and detest my penis. I must get sex reassignment surgery (a "sex change operation") in order to match my external body with my internal mind."&lt;ref name =Dreger2008/&gt;

==Blanchard's deconstruction==

In 2008, [[Ray Blanchard]] presented the idea in the form of a theory in a commentary entitled "Deconstructing the Feminine Essence Narrative" in which he lists what he considers to be "the central tenets of the feminine essence theory", and then refutes each of these tenets:&lt;ref name = Blanchard2008/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

#Male-to-female transsexuals are, in some literal sense and not just in a figurative sense, women inside men’s bodies.
#There is only one type of woman, therefore there can be only one type of (true) male-to-female transsexual.
#Apparent differences among male-to-female transsexuals are relatively superficial and irrelevant to the basic unity of the transsexual syndrome.
#Male-to-female transsexuals have no unique, behavioral or psychological characteristics that are absent in typical men and women.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Neuroanatomic research==

According to Bailey and Triea,&lt;ref name=Bailey2007/&gt; one of the predictions based on the feminine essence theory is that male-to-female transsexuals would possess female rather than male brain anatomy. A widely cited research study of this topic examined the brain anatomy of six deceased male-to-female transsexuals, who had undergone during their lives hormonal treatment and surgical sex reassignment.&lt;ref name=Zhou1995&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zhou J. N. |author2=Hofman M. A. |author3=Gooren L. J. G. |author4=Swaab D. F. | year = 1995 | title = A sex difference in the human brain and its relation to transsexuality | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 378 | issue = 6552| pages = 68–70 | doi = 10.1038/378068a0 | pmid = 7477289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study reported that a brain structure called the "central subdivision of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis" (BSTc), which is larger in typical males than in typical females, was in the female range in the transsexual subjects. The interpretation and the methods of that study have been criticized,&lt;ref name=LawrenceWeb&gt;[http://www.annelawrence.com/twr/brain-sex_critique.html Transsexual women’s resources, by Dr. Anne Lawrence]&lt;/ref&gt; and the finding continues to be a matter of debate.

Neurological research has found that the brains of transsexuals differ in a number of ways.  For example, a study done on the brains of non-homosexual transsexuals using MRI and pheromones as stimuli found that transsexuals process smelling androgen and estrogen in the same way that women do. Previous research by the same team found that homosexual males also process smelling the pheromones of the sexes in a way that is similar to that of women.&lt;ref name="pheroMTF"&gt;[http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bhm216v1?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=1&amp;title=transsexual&amp;andorexacttitle=and&amp;andorexacttitleabs=and&amp;andorexactfulltext=and&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT "Male-to-Female Transsexuals Show Sex-Atypical Hypothalamus Activation When Smelling Odorous Steroids"], by H. Berglund1,  P. Lindström2,  C. Dhejne-Helmy3 and  I. Savic2, Cerebral Cortex&lt;/ref&gt;   Work done by [[Simon LeVay]] had previously found that the hypothalamus of homosexual males has a region which is similar in size to that of heterosexual females.&lt;ref name="levay"&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/scotts/bulgarians/nature-nurture/levay.html A Difference in Hypothalmic Structure Between Heterosexual and Homosexual Men Simon LeVay]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not so in non-homosexual males.&lt;ref name="levay"/&gt; Last but not least a study done by Hilleke E Hulshoff Pol reached the conclusion that the brain does change in overall volume and the volume of its parts with the use of cross-sex hormone supplements.&lt;ref name="CSCB"&gt;[http://www.eje-online.org/cgi/content/abstract/155/suppl_1/S107 Changing your sex changes your brain: influences of testosterone and estrogen on adult human brain structure] Hilleke E Hulshoff Pol,  Peggy T Cohen-Kettenis1,  Neeltje E M Van Haren,  Jiska S Peper, Rachel G H Brans,  Wiepke Cahn,  Hugo G Schnack,  Louis J G Gooren2 and  René S Kahn&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of male-to-female transsexuals, the brain assumes the proportions of a female brain.&lt;ref name="CSCB"/&gt;

==Other findings==

The main support for the feminine essence narrative is that many male-to-female transsexuals say they feel it to be true; many autobiographical and clinical accounts by or about transsexual individuals contain variations of the statement of having a female soul or needing to make the external body resemble the inner or true self.&lt;ref name=Brown1996&gt;Brown, M. L., &amp; Rounsley, C. A. (1996). ''True selves: Understanding transsexualism.'' San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ettner1999&gt;Ettner, R. (1999). ''Gender loving care: A guide to counseling gender-variant clients.'' New York: W. W. Norton.{{ISBN|0393703045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of this narrative consider it to be inconsistent with their research findings.  Blanchard has reported finding that there are two, and not one, types of male-to-female transsexual and that they differ with regard to their sexual interests, whether they were overtly gender atypical in childhood, how easily they pass as female, the ages at which they decide to transition to female, birth order, and their physical height and weight.&lt;ref name=Blanchard1990&gt;Blanchard, R., &amp; Steiner, B. W. (1990). ''Clinical management of gender identity disorders in children and adults.'' Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Press. {{ISBN|0-88048-187-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith2005a&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Smith Y. L. S.|author2= van Goozen S. H. M.|author3= Kuiper A.

W. |author3=Clemmensen L. H. |author4=Dickey R. | year = 1989 | title = Prediction of regrets in postoperative transsexuals | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 43–45 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith2005b&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Smith Y.

==Role of medical community==

Since the medical community has guidelines for what types of individuals qualify for [[sex reassignment surgery]], transsexual persons sometimes adopt and tell the story that they believe will best help them qualify – the "feminine essence narrative" – and representing themselves as "essentially female", which may explain at least part of the prevalence of the feminine essence narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Terminology==

The phrase "feminine soul enclosed in a male body" (''anima muliebris in corpore virili inclusa'') was introduced in 1868 by [[Karl-Heinrich Ulrichs]], not to describe male-to-female transsexuals, none of whom existed yet as such, but to describe a type of gay men who self-identified as feminine.&lt;ref name=Ulrichs1868&gt;Ulrichs, Karl-Heinrich (1868). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=k-2eOwAACAAJ&amp;dq=intitle:Memnon+inauthor:Ulrichs&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions_r&amp;cad=0_2 "Memnon.": Die Geschlechtsnatur des mannliebenden Urnings, eine naturwissenschaftliche Darstellung: körperlich-seelischer Hermaphroditismus.

Frans van der Hoff's contacts with disadvantaged Mexican coffee producers were key in securing the supply and ensuring the success of the very first [[Fairtrade certification]] initiative.

Frans van der Hoff was born as the 7th of 17th children of a disciplined farming family ''Van der Hoff-Boersma'' that had moved from [[Friesland]] to the village [[De Rips]] in the southern Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[https://culemborg.pvda.nl/2015/06/02/grondlegger-max-havelaar-keurmerk-komt-naar-culemborg/ Grondlegger Max Havelaar keurmerk komt naar Culemborg] {{nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became politically active early on in student movements during his studies at [[Radboud University Nijmegen]]. He later received a [[Ph.D.]] in [[political economy]] and another one in [[theology]] while studying in [[Germany]]. In 1970, van der Hoff moved to [[Santiago de Chile]] to work in the [[barrio]]s as a [[worker-priest]]. During the [[Chilean coup of 1973|1973 coup]], van der Hoff moved to [[Mexico]] to continue his work in the slums of [[Mexico City]]. Seven years later, he moved to [[Oaxaca]] in the Southern part of [[Mexico]]. As a worker-priest, he quickly integrated the community and started to learn about the misery and economic hardship of local [[coffee]] producers. In 1981, he participates in the launch of UCIRI ([[Union de Comunidades Indigenas de la Region del Istmo]]), a coffee producer [[cooperative]] created to bypass local traders (also called ''coyotes'') and pool resources.

In 1985, van der Hoff met [[Nico Roozen]] at the [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] train station through a mutual friend. Roozen, who was then responsible for business development at [[ecumenical]] [[development agency]] [[Solidaridad]], quickly became interested in van der Hoff's work.&lt;ref&gt;Jan van der Kaaij (2004).

The initiative offered disadvantaged [[coffee]] producers following various social and environmental standards a fair price, significantly above the market price, for their crop. The [[coffee]], originating from the UCIRI cooperative, was imported by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] company [[Van Weely]], roasted by [[Neuteboom]] and then sold directly to [[world shops]] and retailers across the [[Netherlands]]. The initiative was a great success and was replicated in several other markets.

In 2006, Fairtrade-certified sales amounted to approximately €1.6 billion worldwide&lt;ref name="URL accessed on May 24, 2007"&gt;Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International (2007). www.fairtrade.net.

==Awards==
Van der Hoff was awarded the 2006 [[North-South Prize]] by the [[Council of Europe]].

Van der Hoff was appointed Commander in the [[Order of the Crown (Belgium)]] by the Belgian Minister of Development Cooperation in 2006.

Van der Hoff received in 2006 an honorary doctorate from the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium for his efforts to establish a 'different economy'.

In 2006 he was awarded the Groeneveldprize from the Groeneveld Foundation in the Netherlands, for his special efforts for nature and the preservation of the environment.

He was named [[Chevalier of the Legion of Honor]] by French president Chirac in 2005.

The '''frog pond effect''' is the [[theory]] that individuals evaluate themselves as worse when in a group of higher performing individuals.

The frog pond effect is a part of the wider [[social comparison theory]].  It relates to how [[Self-evaluation motives|individuals evaluate themselves]] based on comparisons to other people around them, and is generally due to upward comparisons. Davis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=James|title=The Campus as a Frog Pond: An Application of the Theory of Relative Deprivation to Career Decisions of College Men|year=1966|url=http://www.utexas.edu/law/journals/tlr/sources/Volume%2092/Issue%206/Sander/Final%20Sourcelist%20Sourcepull/Sander.fn035.frogpond.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; first noticed this effect when he discovered that students evaluated their performance as worse based on their peers from their school.

Individuals are affected by the frog pond effect the most when they come from an [[individualistic culture]], lack strong social connections, and have low collective [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref&gt;MacFarland and Beuhler, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Holocene extinction''', otherwise referred to as the '''Sixth extinction''' or '''Anthropocene extinction''', is the ongoing [[extinction event]] of [[species]] during the present [[Holocene]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]], mainly as a result of human activity.&lt;ref name="WorldScientists"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2018-06&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ceballos |first1=Gerardo |last2=Ehrlich |first2=Paul R. |title=The misunderstood sixth mass extinction |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6393/1080.2 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=8 June 2018 |volume=360 |issue=6393 |pages=1080-1081 |doi=10.1126/science.aau0191 |pmid=29880679 |oclc=7673137938}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large number of extinctions spans numerous families of [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, including [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s, [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s and [[arthropod]]s. With widespread degradation of [[Biodiversity hotspot|highly biodiverse]] habitats such as [[coral reef]]s and [[rainforest]]s, as well as other areas, the vast majority of these extinctions are thought to be ''undocumented'', as no one is even aware of the existence of the species before they go extinct, or no one has yet discovered their extinction. The current rate of extinction of species is estimated at 100 to 1,000 times higher than natural background rates.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=lawton95/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} {{Cite journal|last=De Vos|first=Jurriaan M.|last2=Joppa|first2=Lucas N.|last3=Gittleman|first3=John L.|last4=Stephens|first4=Patrick R.|last5=Pimm|first5=Stuart L.|date=2014-08-26|title=Estimating the normal background rate of species extinction|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cobi.12380|journal=Conservation Biology |volume=29|issue=2|pages=452–462|doi=10.1111/cobi.12380|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2018-06/&gt;

The Holocene extinction includes the disappearance of large land animals known as [[megafauna]], starting at the end of the [[last glacial period|last Ice Age]]. Megafauna outside of the [[African continent]], which did not evolve alongside humans, proved highly sensitive to the introduction of new predation, and many died out shortly after early humans began spreading and hunting across the Earth (additionally, many [[List of African animals extinct in the Holocene|African species have also gone extinct in the Holocene]]). These extinctions, occurring near the [[Pleistocene]]–[[Holocene]] boundary, are sometimes referred to as the [[Quaternary extinction event]].

The arrival of humans on different continents coincides with megafaunal extinction. The most popular theory is that human overhunting of species added to existing stress conditions. Although there is debate regarding how much human predation affected their decline, certain population declines have been directly correlated with human activity, such as the extinction events of [[List of extinct animals of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[List of extinct animals of the Hawaiian Islands|Hawaii]]. Aside from humans, [[climate change]] may have been a driving factor in the megafaunal extinctions, especially at the end of the Pleistocene.

Ecologically, humanity has been noted as an unprecedented "global superpredator" that consistently preys on the adults of other [[apex predator]]s, and has [[human impact on the environment|worldwide effect]]s on [[food web]]s. There have been extinctions of species on every [[land mass]] and in every [[ocean]]: there are many famous examples [[List of African animals extinct in the Holocene|within Africa]], [[List of Asian animals extinct in the Holocene|Asia]], [[List of extinct animals of Europe|Europe]], [[List of extinct animals of Australia|Australia]], [[List of North American animals extinct in the Holocene|North]] and [[List of South American animals extinct in the Holocene|South America]], and on smaller islands. Overall, the Holocene extinction can be linked to the [[human impact on the environment]]. The Holocene extinction continues into the 21st century, with [[Meat#Environmental impact|meat consumption]], [[overfishing]], [[ocean acidification]] and the [[decline in amphibian populations]] being a few broader examples of an almost universal, [[Cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] [[Human impact on the environment#Biodiversity|decline in biodiversity]]. [[Human overpopulation]] (and continued [[Human population growth|population growth]]) along with [[Overconsumption|profligate consumption]] are considered to be the primary drivers of this rapid decline.&lt;ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2017-05/&gt;&lt;ref name="PimmJenkins"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Phillips |first=Kristine |title=Earth is on its way to the biggest mass extinction since the dinosaurs, scientists warn  |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/07/12/earth-is-on-its-way-to-the-biggest-mass-extinction-since-the-dinosaurs-scientists-warn/ |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=12 July 2017 |accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Future of Life'' (2002), [[E.O.

There is widespread consensus among scientists that human activity is accelerating the extinction of many animal species through the destruction of habitats, the consumption of animals as resources, and the elimination of species that humans view as threats or competitors.&lt;ref name="SpecialIssue"/&gt; But some contend that this biotic destruction has yet to reach the level of the previous five mass extinctions.

[[Megafauna]] were once found on every continent of the world and large islands such as [[New Zealand]] and [[Madagascar]], but are now almost exclusively found on the continent of [[Africa]], with notable comparisons on [[Australian megafauna|Australia]] and the islands previously mentioned experiencing population crashes and [[trophic cascade]]s shortly after the earliest human settlers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It has been suggested that the African megafauna survived because they evolved alongside humans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The timing of [[List of South American animals extinct in the Holocene|South American megafaunal extinction]] appears to precede human arrival, although the possibility that human activity at the time impacted the global climate enough to cause such an extinction has been suggested.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While a number of human-derived factors are recognized as potentially contributing to rising atmospheric concentrations of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (methane) and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (carbon dioxide), deforestation and territorial clearance practices associated with agricultural development may be contributing most to these concentrations globally.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Scientists that are employing a variance of [[Archaeology|archaeological]] and paleoecological data argue that the processes contributing to substantial human modification of the environment spanned many thousands of years ago on a global scale and thus, not originating as early as the [[Industrial Revolution]].

[[Australia]] was once home to a [[Australian megafauna|large assemblage of megafauna]], with many parallels to those found on the African continent today.

[[New Zealand]] is characterised by its [[geographic isolation]] and [[Insular biogeography|island biogeography]], and had been isolated from mainland Australia for 80 million years. It was the last large land mass to be colonised by humans. The arrival of [[Polynesia]]n settlers circa 12th century resulted in the extinction of all of the islands' megafaunal birds within several hundred years.&lt;ref name=kolbert/&gt; The last [[moa]], large flightless [[ratite]]s, became extinct within 200 years of the arrival of human settlers.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A high-precision chronology for the rapid extinction of New Zealand moa (Aves, Dinornithiformes)|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379114003734|journal = Quaternary Science Reviews|date = 2014-12-01|pages = 126–135|volume = 105|doi = 10.1016/j.quascirev.2014.09.025|first = George L.

This may have put some pressure on other birds but at the time of early European contact (18th Century) and colonisation (19th Century) the bird life was prolific. With them, the Europeans brought [[Black rat|ship rat]]s, possums, cats and mustelids which decimated native bird life, some of which had adapted [[Flightless bird|flightlessness]] and ground nesting habits and others had no defensive behavior as a result of having no extant [[endemic]] mammalian predators. The [[kakapo]], the world's biggest parrot, which is flightless, now only exists in managed breeding sanctuaries.

There has been a debate as to the extent to which the disappearance of [[megafauna]] at the end of the last [[glacial period]] can be attributed to human activities by hunting, or even by slaughter&lt;ref&gt;This may refer to groups of animals endangered by climate change. For example, during a catastrophic drought, remaining animals would be gathered around the few remaining watering holes, and thus become extremely vulnerable.&lt;/ref&gt; of prey populations. Discoveries at Monte Verde in South America and at [[Meadowcroft Rock Shelter]] in Pennsylvania have caused a controversy&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Early Settlement of North America. The Clovis Era. Gary Haynes 2002 {{ISBN|9780521524636}}. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; regarding the [[Clovis culture]]. There likely would have been human settlements prior to the Clovis Culture, and the history of [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|humans in the Americas]] may extend back many thousands of years before the Clovis culture.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The amount of correlation between human arrival and megafauna extinction is still being debated: for example, in [[Wrangel Island]] in Siberia the extinction of dwarf [[woolly mammoth]]s (approximately 2000 BCE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = P.S. | year = 1995 | title = Mammoth Extinction: Two Continents and Wrangel Island | url = | journal = Radiocarbon | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 7–10 | doi=10.1017/s0033822200014739}}&lt;/ref&gt; did not coincide with the arrival of humans, nor did megafaunal mass extinction on the South American continent, although it has been suggested climate changes induced by anthropogenic effects elsewhere in the world may have contributed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Comparisons are sometimes made between recent extinctions (approximately since the [[industrial revolution]]) and the Pleistocene extinction near the end of the last [[glacial period]]. The latter is exemplified by the extinction of large herbivores such as the [[woolly mammoth]] and the carnivores that preyed on them. Humans of this era actively hunted the [[mammoth]] and the [[mastodon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pitulko | first1 = V. V. | last2 = Nikolsky | first2 = P. A. | last3 = Girya | first3 = E.

E. 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="link.springer.com"/&gt;

The ecosystems encountered by the first Americans had not been exposed to human interaction, and may have been far less resilient to human made changes than the ecosystems encountered by industrial era humans. Therefore, the actions of the Clovis people, despite seeming insignificant by today's standards could indeed have had a profound effect on the ecosystems and wild life which was entirely unused to human influence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Afroeurasia====
{{See also|List of African animals extinct in the Holocene|List of Asian animals extinct in the Holocene|List of extinct animals of Europe}}
Africa experienced the smallest decline in megafauna compared to the other continents. This is presumably due to the idea that Afroeurasian megafauna evolved alongside humans, and thus developed a healthy fear of them, unlike the comparatively tame animals of other continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/files/17443890/late_pleistocene_megafaunal_extinctions.pdf|pages=700–711|first=S.

====Megafaunal extinction====
Megafauna play a significant role in the lateral transport of mineral nutrients in an ecosystem, tending to translocate them from areas of high to those of lower abundance.

Large populations of megaherbivores have the potential to contribute greatly to the atmospheric concentration of [[methane]], which is an important [[greenhouse gas]]. Modern [[ruminant]] [[herbivores]] produce methane as a byproduct of [[foregut fermentation]] in digestion, and release it through belching or flatulence. Today, around 20% of annual [[methane emissions]] come from livestock methane release. In the [[Mesozoic]], it has been estimated that [[sauropod]]s could have emitted 520 million tons of methane to the atmosphere annually,&lt;ref name = "Wilkinson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilkinson|first=D.

After early humans migrated to the Americas about 13,000 [[Before Present|BP]], their hunting and other associated ecological impacts led to the extinction of many megafaunal species there. Calculations suggest that this extinction decreased methane production by about 9.6 million tons per year. This suggests that the absence of megafaunal methane emissions may have contributed to the abrupt climatic cooling at the onset of the [[Younger Dryas]].&lt;ref name = "Smith"/&gt; The decrease in atmospheric methane that occurred at that time, as recorded in [[ice core]]s, was 2–4 times more rapid than any other decrease in the last half million years, suggesting that an unusual mechanism was at work.&lt;ref name = "Smith"/&gt;

=== Disease ===

The hyperdisease hypothesis, proposed by Ross MacPhee in 1997, states that the megafaunal die-off was due to an indirect transmission of diseases by newly arriving [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal humans]].&lt;ref name="MacPhee&amp;Marx1997"&gt;{{cite book |author1=MacFee, R.D.E.  |author2=Marx, P.A.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1997 |chapter= Humans, hyperdisease and first-contact extinctions |title=Natural Change and Human Impact in Madagascar |editor= Goodman, S. |editor2=Patterson, B.D. | location = Washington D.C. | publisher = Smithsonian Press | pages = 169–217 | isbn = 978-1-56098-683-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MacPhee&amp;Marx1998"&gt;{{cite web |author1=MacFee, R.D.E.  |author2=Marx, P.A.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1998 | title = Lightning Strikes Twice: Blitzkrieg, Hyperdisease, and Global Explanations of the Late Quaternary Catastrophic Extinctions | publisher = American Museum of Natural History | url = http://www.amnh.biz/science/biodiversity/extinction/Day1/bytes/MacPheePres.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference| first = Ross D.E.| last = MacPhee|author2=Marx, Preston | title = The 40,000-year Plague: Humans, Hyperdisease, and First-Contact Extinctions| booktitle = Natural Change and Human Impact in Madagascar| pages = 169–217| publisher = Smithsonian Institution Press| year = 1997| location = Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to MacPhee, aboriginals or animals travelling with them, such as [[domestic dog]]s or livestock, introduced one or more highly [[virulent]] diseases into new environments whose native population had no immunity to them, eventually leading to their extinction. [[K-selection]] animals, such as the now-extinct megafauna, are especially vulnerable to diseases, as opposed to [[r-selection]] animals who have a shorter [[gestation period]] and a higher population size. Humans are thought to be the sole cause as other earlier migrations of animals into North America from Eurasia did not cause extinctions.&lt;ref name="MacPhee&amp;Marx1997"/&gt;

There are many problems with this theory, as this disease would have to meet several criteria: it has to be able to sustain itself in an environment with no [[host (biology)|hosts]]; it has to have a high [[infection rate]]; and be extremely lethal, with a [[mortality rate]] of 50–75%. Disease has to be very virulent to kill off all the individuals in a [[genus]] or [[species]], and even such a virulent disease as [[West Nile Virus]] is unlikely to have caused extinction.&lt;ref name="Lyons et al2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lyons|first=K.|last2=Smith|first2=F.

However, diseases have been the cause for some extinctions.

Rising levels of carbon dioxide are resulting in influx of this gas into the ocean, increasing its acidity. Marine organisms which possess [[seashell|calcium carbonate shells]] or [[exoskeleton]]s experience physiological pressure as the carbonate reacts with acid. For example, this is already resulting in [[coral bleaching]] on various [[coral reef]]s worldwide, which provide valuable habitat and maintain a high biodiversity.

The decline of amphibian populations has also been identified as an indicator of environmental degradation. As well as habitat loss, introduced predators and pollution, [[Chytridiomycosis]], a fungal infection thought to have been accidentally spread by human travel,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; has caused severe population drops of several species of frogs, including (among many others) the extinction of the [[golden toad]] in Costa Rica and the [[Gastric-brooding frog]] in Australia. Many other amphibian species now face extinction, including the reduction of [[Rabb's Fringe-limbed Treefrog|Rabb's fringe-limbed treefrog]] to an [[endling]], and the extinction of the [[Panamanian golden frog]] in the wild. Chytrid fungus has spread across Australia, New Zealand, Central America and Africa, including countries with high amphibian diversity such as [[cloud forest]]s in [[Honduras]] and [[Madagascar]]. ''[[Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans]]'' is a similar infection currently threatening [[salamander]]s. Amphibians are now the most endangered vertebrate group, having existed for more than 300 million years through three other [[mass extinction]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;{{rp|17}}

Millions of bats in the US have been dying off since 2012 due to a fungal infection spread from European bats, which appear to be immune. Population drops have been as great as 90% within five years, and extinction of at least one bat species is predicted. There is currently no form of treatment, and such declines have been described as "unprecedented" in bat evolutionary history by Alan Hicks of the [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blehert|first1=D.

[[File:Climate March 1123 (34327144666).jpg|thumb|Placard at the [[People's Climate March (2017)|Climate March 2017]].]]

Some leading scientists have advocated for the global community to designate as protected areas 30 percent of the planet by 2030, and 50 percent by 2050, in order to mitigate the contemporary extinction crisis as the human population is projected to grow to 10 billion by the middle of the century. Human consumption of food and water resources is also projected to double by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Baillie|first1=Jonathan|last2=Ya-Ping|first2=Zhang|date=September 14, 2018 |title=Space for nature|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6407/1051|journal=Science |volume=361 |issue=6407 |pages=1051 |doi=10.1126/science.aau1397|access-date=September 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, the UN's biodiversity chief Cristiana Pașca Palmer urged people around the world to put pressure on governments to implement significant protections for wildlife by 2020, as rampant biodiversity loss is a "silent killer" as dangerous as [[global warming]], but has received little attention by comparison. She says that "It’s different from climate change, where people feel the impact in everyday life. With biodiversity, it is not so clear but by the time you feel what is happening, it may be too late."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Watts |first=Jonathan |date=November 3, 2018 |title=Stop biodiversity loss or we could face our own extinction, warns UN|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/03/stop-biodiversity-loss-or-we-could-face-our-own-extinction-warns-un|work=The Guardian |location= |access-date=November 3, 2018 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities''' is an honorary [[lecture series]] established in 1972 by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH).  According to the NEH, the Lecture is "the highest honor the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] confers for distinguished intellectual achievement in the [[humanities]]."&lt;ref name="jefflect"&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/about/awards/jefferson-lecture Jefferson Lecture] at NEH Website (retrieved January 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Jefferson Lecture==
The Jefferson Lecturer is selected each year by the National Council on the Humanities, the 26-member citizen advisory board of the NEH.   The honoree delivers a lecture in [[Washington, D.C.]], generally in conjunction with the spring meeting of the Council, and receives an honorarium of $10,000.  The stated purpose of the honor is to recognize "an individual who has made significant scholarly contributions in the humanities and who has the ability to communicate the knowledge and wisdom of the humanities in a broadly appealing way."&lt;ref name="jefflect" /&gt;

The first Jefferson Lecturer, in 1972, was [[Lionel Trilling]].  He spoke on "Mind in the Modern World." Among other things, Trilling suggested that [[humanism]] had become the basis for social improvement, rather than science and the [[scientific method]] as has been predicted by [[Thomas Jefferson]], the Lectures' namesake.&lt;ref name="Krebs"&gt;Alvin Krebs and [[Robert McG. Thomas]], [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00EED91738F931A25756C0A967948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print "Notes on People; Jeffersonian Theory Gets New Lease on Life,"] ''New York Times'', May 12, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ten years later, [[Gerald Holton]], the first scientist invited to deliver the lecture, drew attention for responding to Trilling, proposing that Jefferson's vision of science as a force for social improvement was still viable, opining that there had been a "relocation of the center of gravity" of scientific inquiry toward solving society's important problems,&lt;ref name="Krebs"/&gt;  and cautioning that science education had to be improved dramatically or only a small "technological elite" would be equipped to take part in self-government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.harvard.edu/article.aspx?ref=226614 "Holton, in Jefferson Lecture, Criticizes Science Education,"] ''[[Harvard Crimson]]'', May 15, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

The selection of the 2000 Jefferson Lecturer led to a spate of controversy.  The initial selection was President [[Bill Clinton]].  [[William R. Ferris]], chairman of the NEH, said that his intent was to establish a new tradition for every President to deliver a Jefferson Lecture during his or her presidency, and that this was consistent with the NEH's broader effort to increase public awareness of the humanities.  However, some scholars and political opponents objected that the choice of Clinton represented an inappropriate and unprecedented politicization of the NEH. The heads of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] and the National Humanities Alliance expressed concerns about introducing political considerations into the selection, while [[William J. Bennett]], a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and former chairman of the NEH under President [[Ronald Reagan]], charged that the proposal was an example of how Clinton had "corrupted all of those around him."&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Molotsky, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE7D91F3CF932A1575AC0A96F958260 "Choice of Clinton to Give Humanities Lecture Meets Resistance," ] ''[[New York Times]]'', September 21, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the wake of the controversy, President Clinton declined the honor; a [[White House]] spokesperson said the President "didn't want the work of the National Endowment for the Humanities to be called into question."&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E3DC173FF931A1575AC0A96F958260 "National News Briefs; Clinton Declines Offer To Give Scholarly Talk,"] ''[[New York Times]]'', September 22, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately the 2000 honor went to historian [[James M. McPherson]], whose lecture turned out to be very popular. Subsequently, the NEH revised the criteria for the award to place more emphasis on speaking skills and public appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Southwick, [http://chronicle.com/free/v47/i06/06a03001.htm "NEH Wants Jefferson Lectures to Have More Public Appeal,"] ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'',  October 6, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next Jefferson Lecture, by playwright [[Arthur Miller]], again led to attacks from conservatives&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Craig, "Arthur Miller's Jefferson Lecture Stirs Controversy," in [http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2001may/ncc.html "Capital Commentary"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122153656/http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2001may/ncc.html |date=2008-11-22 }}, ''OAH Newsletter'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[published by &lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Organization of American Historians]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, May 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Jay Nordlinger]], who called it "a disgrace,"&lt;ref&gt;Jay Nordlinger, [http://www.nationalreview.com/impromptus/impromptus042202.asp "Back to Plessy, Easter with Fidel, Miller’s new tale, &amp;c."] ''[[National Review]]'', April 22, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Will]], who did not like the political content of Miller's lecture and argued that Miller was not legitimately a "scholar."&lt;ref&gt;[[George Will]], [http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/will041001.asp  "Enduring Arthur Miller: Oh, the Humanities!"]  ''[[Jewish World Review]]'', April 10, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent Jefferson Lecturers have included journalist/author [[Tom Wolfe]];&lt;ref&gt;David Epstein, [http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/05/11/wolfe "A Speech in Full,"] ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]'', May 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Straussian]] conservative political philosopher [[Harvey Mansfield]];&lt;ref&gt;Philip Kennicott, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/08/AR2007050802282.html "A Strauss Primer, With Glossy Mansfield Finish,"] ''[[Washington Post]]'', May 9, 2007.
&lt;/ref&gt; and novelist [[John Updike]], who, in a nod to the NEH's [http://picturingamerica.neh.gov/ ''Picturing America''] arts initiative, devoted his 2008 lecture to the subject of [[Visual arts of the United States|American art]].&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Howard, [http://chronicle.com/news/article/4541/in-jefferson-lecture-updike-says-american-art-is-known-by-its-insecurity "In Jefferson Lecture, Updike Says American Art Is Known by Its Insecurity,"] ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', May 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jay Tolson,[https://www.usnews.com/articles/news/national/2008/05/23/john-updike-on-american-art.html "John Updike on American Art,"] ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'', May 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his 2009 lecture, [[bioethicist]] and self-described "[[humanism|humanist]]" [[Leon Kass]] expressed his view that science has become separated from its humanistic origins, and the humanities have lost their connection to metaphysical and theological concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Serena Golden, [http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/05/22/kass "Tough Love for the Humanities"], ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]'', May 22, 2009 (retrieved May 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the NEH went in a different direction, selecting film director [[Martin Scorsese]].  He was the first filmmaker chosen for the honor, and he spoke on "the evolution of his films, the art of storytelling, and the inspiration he draws from the humanities".&lt;ref&gt;Dave Itzkoff, [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/19/hes-talking-to-you-scorsese-to-give-jefferson-lecture-for-national-endowment-for-the-humanities/ "He’s Talking to You: Scorsese to Give Jefferson Lecture for National Endowment for the Humanities"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014 the Jefferson Lecturer was author [[Walter Isaacson]],&lt;ref name="Nola2014"&gt;Chris Waddington, [http://www.nola.com/celebrities/index.ssf/2014/01/best-selling_biographer_walter.html "Best-selling biographer Walter Isaacson will deliver prestigious Jefferson Lecture in 2014"], ''[[Times-Picayune]]'', January 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2015 honoree was playwright and actress [[Anna Deavere Smith]].&lt;ref name="Deveare Smith NYT"&gt;Jennifer Schuessler, [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/anna-deavere-smith-to-deliver-jefferson-lecture/?_r=0 "Anna Deavere Smith to Deliver Jefferson Lecture"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of the NEH's celebration of its fiftieth anniversary in 2016, it selected documentarian [[Ken Burns]] to deliver the lecture.&lt;ref name="BurnsNYT"/&gt;  The 2017 lecturer is [[University of Chicago]] philosophy and law professor [[Martha Nussbaum]], who delivered her lecture, entitled "Powerlessness and the Politics of Blame", on May 1, 2017.&lt;ref name="NussbaumIHE"/&gt;

==Publications based on Jefferson Lectures==
A number of the Jefferson Lectures have led to books, including Holton's ''The Advancement of Science, and Its Burdens'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald Holton]], ''The Advancement of Science, and Its Burdens: The Jefferson Lecture and Other Essays'' (Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press 1986), {{ISBN|0-521-27243-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hope Franklin]]'s ''Racial Equality in America'',&lt;ref&gt;[[John Hope Franklin]], ''Racial Equality in America'' (Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 1993), {{ISBN|0-8262-0912-2}} .&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Henry Louis Gates]]' ''The Trials of Phillis Wheatley''&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Louis Gates]], ''The Trials of Phillis Wheatley: America's First Black Poet and Her Encounters with the Founding Fathers'' (Basic Civitas Books, 2003), {{ISBN|0-465-02729-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jaroslav Pelikan]]'s ''The Vindication of Tradition''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jaroslav Pelikan]], ''The Vindication of Tradition: The 1983 Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities'', (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1986), {{ISBN|0-300-03638-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Updike's 2008 lecture was included in his posthumous 2012 collection ''Always Looking''.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Dixon, [http://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/a-critic-keeping-it-surreal-219248.html "A critic keeping it surreal"], ''[[Irish Examiner]]'', January 11, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernard Lewis]]' 1990 lecture on "Western Civilization: A View from the East" was revised and reprinted in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' under the title "The Roots of Muslim Rage".&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis, [https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199009/muslim-rage "The Roots of Muslim Rage,"] ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', September 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one source, Lewis' lecture (and the subsequent article) first introduced the term "[[Islamic fundamentalism]]" to North America.&lt;ref&gt;Amber Haque, "Islamophobia in North America: Confronting the Menace," in Barry van Driel, ed., ''Confronting Islamophobia in Educational Practice'' (Trentham Books, 2004), {{ISBN|1-85856-340-2}}, p.6, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TgBzHEQl8oAC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=0_0#PPA6,M1 excerpt available online] at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jus commune''''' or '''''ius commune''''' is [[Latin]] for "common law" in certain jurisdictions. It is often used by [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[jurist]]s to refer to those aspects of the civil law system's invariant legal principles, sometimes called "the law of the land" in [[English law]]. While the ''ius commune'' was a secure point of reference in continental European legal systems, in England it was not a point of reference at all.&lt;ref&gt;[[David John Ibbetson]], ''Common Law and Ius Commune'', p. 20 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; (''Ius commune'' is distinct from the term "[[common law]]" meaning the Anglo-American family of law as opposed to the civil law family.)

The phrase "the common law of the civil law systems" means those underlying laws that create a distinct legal system and are common to all its elements.

The ''{{lang|la|ius commune}}'', in its historical meaning, is commonly thought of as a combination of [[canon law]] and [[Roman law]] which formed the basis of a common system of legal thought in Western Europe from the rediscovery and reception of [[Justinian's Digest]] in the 12th and 13th centuries.  In addition to this definition, the term also possibly had a narrower meaning depending upon the context in which it was used.  Some scholars believe that the term, when used in the context of the ecclesiastical courts of England in the fourteenth and fifteenth century, also "meant the law that is common to the universal church, as opposed to the constitutions or special customs or privileges of any provincial church."&lt;ref&gt;F.W. Maitland, ''Canon Law in England'', The English Historical Review, Vol. 11, No. 43 (Jul. 1896) pp. 446-478.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''{{lang|la|ius commune}}'' was an actual part of the law in most areas, although in any one jurisdiction local laws (statutes and customs) could take precedence over the ''{{lang|la|ius commune}}''. This was the case up until the [[Codification (law)|codification]] movement in the late 18th and 19th centuries, which explicitly removed the direct applicability of Roman and canon law in most countries, although there continued to be argument about whether the ''{{lang|la|ius commune}}'' was banished completely or survived where the national codes were silent.

The latter view prevailed, so it can still be said that there is, in theory at least, a common basis in substantive law throughout Western Europe (except England, which never had a reception as such) although it has of course fragmented greatly from its heyday in the 15th and 16th centuries. More important, however, is the civilian tradition of ways of thinking that the ''{{lang|la|ius commune}}'' encouraged and the procedures it used, which have been more persistent than the actual substance.

In England, the law developed its own tradition separate from the rest of Europe based on its own common law. [[Scotland]] has a mixed civil and common law system. Scotland had a reception of Roman law and partial codification through the works of the Institutional Writers, such as [[James Dalrymple, 1st Viscount of Stair|Viscount Stair]] and [[George Home, 1st Earl of Dunbar|Baron Hume]], among others. Influence from England has meant that Scotland's current system is more common law than civilian, but there are areas which are still heavily based on Roman law, such as Scots property law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3441">The term '''legal transplant''' was coined in the 1970s by the Scottish-American legal scholar [[Alan Watson (legal scholar)|W.A.J. 'Alan' Watson]] to indicate the moving of a rule or a [[system of law]] from one country to another (A. Watson, ''Legal Transplants: An Approach to [[Comparative Law]]'', [[Edinburgh]], 1974). The notion of legal transplantation is [[diffusionism]]-based and according to this concept most changes in most legal systems occur as the result of borrowing. As maintained by [[Alan Watson (legal scholar)|Watson]], transplantation is the most fertile source of legal development.

Laws are commonly inspired by foreign policies and experiences. Regardless of the academic discourses on whether legal transplants are sustainable as a notion in the [[law|legal theory]], they are common practice. Nevertheless, the degree to which new laws are inspired by foreign examples can vary. A frequent and often justified criticism is that imported laws are not suited for a certain local context.

German jurist [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]] and his [[German Historical School|historical school of jurisprudence]], which was inspired by the 19th-century [[Romanticism]], have notably promoted the origins of the [[German people]] and their distinctive [[ethos]], or [[Volksgeist]] (“the spirit of a people”). Savigny’s school of legal thought expressed the need of legal change to respect the continuity of the Volksgeist offering a pre-Darwinian concept of juristic evolution. However, this concept of juristic evolution did not leave much space for notions such as legal transplants and the diffusion of law. More recently, Pierre Legrand is one of the strongest opponents of legal transplants.

Today, legal transplants are often mentioned in the broader process of '''diffusion of law''' or '''legal [[acculturation]]'''. J.W. Powell is credited with coining the word “acculturation”, first using it in an 1880 report by the US Bureau of American [[Ethnography]]. He explained that this term refers to the [[psychology|psychological]] changes induced by [[cross-cultural]] [[imitation]]. In a broader context, such notion is by many contemporary scholars applied to legal thought. The diffusion of law is a process of legal change in today’s age of [[globalization]]. Studies on diffusion of law are notably a new area of research in the 21st century.

'''Leon Levy''' (September 13, 1925 – April 6, 2003)&lt;ref name=NYTMartin&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/08/obituaries/08LEVY.html Douglas Martin, "Leon Levy, Philanthropist, Dies at 77", ''The New York Times''], April 8, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; was an American investor, [[Mutual fund|mutual fund manager]], and philanthropist.

==Early life and education==
Born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family,&lt;ref&gt;Silbiger, Steve [https://books.google.com/books?id=2CAGE9yJcm8C&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=leon%20levy&amp;f=false The Jewish Phenomenon: Seven Keys to the Enduring Wealth of a People] p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Levy attended [[Townsend Harris High School]] and studied psychology at [[City College of New York]]. After serving in the [[U.S. Army]], he began working as a research analyst. He was strongly influenced in his business approach by his father, Jerome Levy, an economist and business executive who emphasized the role corporate profits play in charting the economy's direction.&lt;ref name=NYTMartin /&gt;

== Investment career ==
In 1956 he became a partner of [[Oppenheimer Holdings|Oppenheimer &amp; Co.]] Inc, then in 1959 Levy co-founded the Oppenheimer [[mutual funds]]. There he started dozens of mutual funds that, at his death, had grown to manage more than $120 billion. In 1982, he sold both companies to the U.K.'s Mercantile House for $162 million and co-founded Odyssey Partners, a private investment partnership. It grew to be a $3 billion hedge fund before it was dissolved in 1997.

== Investment philosophy ==
Levy's financial philosophy stressed common sense and the psychology of investors.

==Wealth and philanthropy==
In 1986, to honor his father, he founded the Jerome Levy Economics Institute, now the [[Levy Economics Institute|Levy Institute]], at [[Bard College]] in [[Annandale-on-Hudson, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.levyinstitute.org/about/ About the Levy Economics Institute.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Levy Institute has established itself as a sponsor of extensive work in [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] and [[post-Keynesian economics]]. In the last year of his life, Levy commuted up the [[Hudson River]] from New York City to teach a class at the Levy Institute, "Contemporary Developments in Finance", in which he focused on his belief that investing is as much a psychological as it is an economic act.

When he died in his late seventies, Levy was estimated to be worth a billion dollars, though his personal wealth might have been substantially higher were it not for his philanthropic interests.

Levy's philanthropy began in the 1950s, when he established the Jerome Levy Foundation, which still exists, giving grants to human rights and land preservation organizations. His donations grew steadily, and during his lifetime, Levy and his wife, Shelby White, gave away more than $200 million, becoming well known for their philanthropic efforts. They donated $20 million to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] for the construction of the Leon Levy and Shelby White Court,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/10/arts/design/10coll.html?pagewanted=all Hugh Eakin and Randy Kennedy, "Doubts on Donors' Collection Cloud Met Antiquities Project",] ''The New York Times'', December 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; a gallery hosting the largest selection of [[Hellenistic]] and [[Roman art|Roman]] artwork ever exhibited at that museum. The gallery included a number of pieces from Levy and White's substantial art collection, which also includes art from the [[Near East]]. Between 1997 and 2003, Levy and White donated nearly $5 million to 107 scholars for the publication of archaeological excavations that had been completed but never published. The projects funded by their program, the Shelby White-Leon Levy Program for Archaeological Publications, include excavations at some of the highest profile archaeological sites throughout [[Greece]] and the [[Middle East]], including [[Knossos]], [[Aphrodisias]], [[Kition]], [[Ras Shamra]], [[Sarepta]], [[Mt. Gerizim]], [[Ekron]], [[Lachish]], [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Pella]], [[Jerash]], the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], [[Assur]], [[Nineveh]], [[Nuzi]], and [[Tepe Hissar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~semitic/wl/grantees.html Shelby White and Leon Levy Program for Archaeological Publications.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922000854/http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~semitic/wl/grantees.html |date=2012-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also funded the Leon Levy Excavation at [[Ashkelon]], [[Israel]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://digashkelon.com/expedition/ The Leon Levy Expedition to Ashkelon.]&lt;/ref&gt; created the Leon Levy Visitor Center at the [[New York Botanical Garden]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybg.org/press_releases/visitor_center_release.pdf "Leon Levy Visitor Center, Dramatic New Gateway to Garden, Opens to Public May 1, 2004".] Press release, April 21, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and financed the Shelby White and Leon Levy Center for Mind Brain and Behavior at [[Rockefeller University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswire.rockefeller.edu/2008/03/25/4-5-million-grant-funds-interdisciplinary-fellowships-at-rockefeller/ "$4.5 million grant funds interdisciplinary fellowships at Rockefeller", The Rockefeller University.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708021704/http://newswire.rockefeller.edu/2008/03/25/4-5-million-grant-funds-interdisciplinary-fellowships-at-rockefeller/ |date=2012-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where Levy was a member of the Board. Levy also served as President of the Board of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], Vice Chairman of the Institute of Fine Arts at [[New York University]], and was a director of [[Bard College]], and many other not-for-profit boards.

The Leon Levy Foundation and Shelby White, as Chairman of the Friends of the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]], provided the funds for conserving the extraordinarily well-preserved [[Lod Mosaic Archaeological Center|Lod Mosaic]] and established the Shelby White and Leon Levy Lod Mosaic Archaeological Center, which will house the mosaic once it returns from its 2010-2016 international exhibition tour.&lt;ref name="mfa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|date=2009-07-01 |url= http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Early+History+-+Archaeology/Lod_mosaic_to_be_re-exposed_1-Jul-2009.htm |title= Lod mosaic to be re-exposed |work= [[Cabinet of Israel|Government of Israel]] website |publisher= [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)]] |accessdate=2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lodmosaic.org/schedule.html |title=The Lod Mosaic: Exhibition Schedule, accessed 9 April, 2016 |access-date=2016-04-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409161134/http://www.lodmosaic.org/schedule.html |archive-date=2016-04-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long interested in ancient history, Levy in his final years, along with White, began discussions about the creation of a path-breaking institute where advanced scholars would explore trade and cultural links among ancient civilizations.

After his death in 2003, Levy’s philanthropy was continued through the [[Leon Levy Foundation]], and one of its earliest initiatives was the fulfillment of that plan. In spring, 2006, the Leon Levy Foundation pledged $200 million to New York University for the creation of the [[Institute for the Study of the Ancient World]], a center for advanced scholarly research and graduate education, intended to cultivate cross-cultural study of the ancient world, from the western [[Mediterranean]] to [[China]].

===Antiquities controversy===
The donation created controversy among some academics who believe that collectors of antiquities encourage the looting of ancient sites. In their 2006 book ''The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities &amp;ndash; From Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums'', [[Peter Watson (intellectual historian)|Peter Watson]] and Cecelia Todeschini lay out the dynamics of the illegal trade in [[antiquities]] and use Leon Levy and Shelby White as an example of collectors whose purchases may have led to unethical dealing in artifacts.

One [[NYU]] professor, Randall White, resigned from NYU’s existing Center for Ancient Studies &amp;ndash; which is independent of the new [[Institute for the Study of the Ancient World]] &amp;ndash; saying that he opposed the acceptance of a donation from a foundation whose benefactor had sometimes been associated with such questionable practices and trafficking. Several scholars outside NYU, notably from [[Bryn Mawr College]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and the [[University of Cincinnati]], also commented negatively on NYU's acceptance of the gift. Many other scholars, however, supported the institute and the gift. Professor James McCredie, of the Institute of Fine Arts, NYU's graduate teaching and advanced research center for art history, wrote a letter to Provost David McLaughlin endorsing the project. It was signed by IFA's seven professors of ancient art and architecture, and the controversy soon died out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.elginism.com/similar-cases/academic-backlash-against-leon-levy-foundation/20060401/379/ | title=Academic backlash against Leon Levy foundation donation | publisher=Elginism |work=Science, 31 Mar 2006: Vol. 311, Issue 5769 | date=April 1, 2006 | accessdate=September 28, 2016 | author=[[Michael Balter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pogrebin, Robin]] (April 1, 2002) [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/01/arts/01gift.html?pagewanted=all "$200 Million Gift Prompts a Debate Over Antiquities"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In hemifusion only the outer bilayer leaflets mix. In full fusion both leaflets as well as the internal contents mix.]]
In [[membrane biology]], '''fusion''' is the process by which two initially distinct [[lipid bilayer]]s merge their [[hydrophobic]] cores, resulting in one interconnected structure. If this fusion proceeds completely through both leaflets of both bilayers, an [[aqueous]] bridge is formed and the internal contents of the two structures can mix. Alternatively, if only one leaflet from each bilayer is involved in the fusion process, the bilayers are said to be hemifused. In hemifusion, the lipid constituents of the outer leaflet of the two bilayers can mix, but the inner leaflets remain distinct. The aqueous contents enclosed by each bilayer also remain separated.

Fusion is involved in many cellular processes, particularly in [[eukaryotes]] since the eukaryotic cell is extensively sub-divided by lipid bilayer membranes. [[Exocytosis]], [[fertilization]] of an [[egg (biology)|egg]] by [[sperm]] and transport of waste products to the [[lysosome]] are a few of the many eukaryotic processes that rely on some form of fusion. Fusion is also an important mechanism for transport of lipids from their site of synthesis to the membrane where they are needed. Even the entry of pathogens can be governed by fusion, as many bilayer-coated [[viruses]] have dedicated fusion proteins to gain entry into the host cell.

==Lipid mechanism==

There are four fundamental steps in the fusion process, although each of these steps actually represents a complex sequence of events.&lt;ref name="Yeagle1993"&gt;{{cite book |first1=P. L. |last1=Yeagle |title=The Membranes of Cells |edition=2nd |year=1993 |location=San Diego |publisher=Academic Press}}{{page needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the involved membranes must aggregate, approaching each other to within several nanometers. Second, the two bilayers must come into very close contact (within a few angstroms). To achieve this close contact, the two surfaces must become at least partially dehydrated, as the bound surface water normally present causes bilayers to strongly repel at this distance. Third, a destabilization must develop at one point between the two bilayers, inducing a highly localized rearrangement of the two bilayers. Finally, as this point defect grows, the components of the two bilayers mix and diffuse away from the site of contact. Depending on whether hemifusion or full fusion occurs, the internal contents of the membranes may mix at this point as well.

The exact mechanisms behind this complex sequence of events are still a matter of debate. To simplify the system and allow more definitive study, many experiments have been performed ''in vitro'' with synthetic lipid vesicles. These studies have shown that divalent [[Cation#Ions|cations]] play a critical role in the fusion process by binding to negatively charged lipids such as [[phosphatidylserine]], [[phosphatidylglycerol]] and [[cardiolipin]].&lt;ref name="Papahadjopoulos1990"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00762944 |title=Molecular mechanisms of calcium-induced membrane fusion |year=1990 |last1=Papahadjopoulos |first1=Demetrios |last2=Nir |first2=Shlomo |last3=Düzgünes |first3=Nejat |journal=Journal of Bioenergetics and Biomembranes |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=157–79 |pmid=2139437}}&lt;/ref&gt; One role on these ions in the fusion process is to shield the negative charge on the surface of the bilayer, diminishing [[electrostatic repulsion]] and allowing the membranes to approach each other. This is clearly not the only role, however, since there is an extensively documented difference in the ability of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; versus Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to induce fusion. Although Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; will induce extensive aggregation it will not induce fusion, while Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; induces both.&lt;ref name="Leventis1986"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/bi00370a600 |title=Divalent Cation Induced Fusion and Lipid Lateral Segregation in Phosphatidylcholine-Phosphatidic Acid Vesicles |year=1986 |last1=Leventis |first1=Rania |last2=Gagne |first2=Jeannine |last3=Fuller |first3=Nola |last4=Rand |first4=R. |last5=Silvius |first5=J. |journal=Biochemistry |volume=25 |issue=22 |pages=6978–87 |pmid=3801406}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that this discrepancy is due to a difference in extent of dehydration. Under this theory, calcium ions bind more strongly to charged lipids, but less strongly to water.

In the fusion process, the lipid head group is not only involved in charge density, but can affect dehydration and defect nucleation. These effects are independent of the effects of ions. The presence of the uncharged headgroup phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) increases fusion when incorporated into a phosphatidylcholine bilayer. This phenomenon has been explained by some as a dehydration effect similar to the influence of calcium.&lt;ref name="Duzgunes1981"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0005-2736(81)90148-6 |title=Studies on the mechanism of membrane fusion.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The situation is further complicated when considering fusion ''in vivo'' since biological fusion is almost always regulated by the action of [[Membrane protein|membrane-associated proteins]]. The first of these proteins to be studied were the viral fusion proteins, which allow an enveloped [[virus]] to insert its genetic material into the host cell (enveloped viruses are those surrounded by a lipid bilayer; some others have only a protein coat). Broadly, there are two classes of viral fusion proteins: acidic and pH-independent.&lt;ref name="Yeagle1993" /&gt; [[pH]] independent fusion proteins can function under neutral conditions and fuse with the [[plasma membrane]], allowing viral entry into the cell. Viruses utilizing this scheme included [[HIV]], [[measles]] and [[herpes]]. Acidic fusion proteins such as those found on [[influenza]] are only activated when in the low pH of acidic endosomes and must first be [[endocytosis|endocytosed]] to gain entry into the cell.

[[Eukaryotic]] cells use entirely different classes of fusion proteins, the best studied of which are the [[SNARE (protein)|SNAREs]]. SNARE proteins are used to direct all [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicular]] intracellular trafficking. Despite years of study, much is still unknown about the function of this protein class. In fact, there is still an active debate regarding whether SNAREs are linked to early docking or participate later in the fusion process by facilitating hemifusion.&lt;ref name="Chen2001"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/35052017 |year=2001 |last1=Chen |first1=Yu A. |last2=Scheller |first2=Richard H. |journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=98–106 |pmid=11252968 |title=SNARE-mediated membrane fusion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even once the role of SNAREs or other specific proteins is illuminated, a unified understanding of fusion proteins is unlikely as there is an enormous diversity of structure and function within these classes, and very few themes are conserved.&lt;ref name="White1990"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.ph.52.030190.003331 |title=Viral and Cellular Membrane Fusion Proteins |year=1990 |last1=White |first1=J M |journal=Annual Review of Physiology |volume=52 |pages=675–97 |pmid=2184772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fusion in laboratory practice==
In studies of molecular and cellular biology it is often desirable to artificially induce fusion. Although this can be accomplished with the addition of calcium as discussed earlier, this procedure is often not feasible because calcium regulates many other biochemical processes and its addition would be a strong confound. Also, as mentioned, calcium induces massive aggregation as well as fusion. The addition of [[polyethylene glycol]] (PEG) causes fusion without significant aggregation or biochemical disruption. This procedure is now used extensively, for example by fusing [[B-cells]] with [[myeloma]] cells.&lt;ref name="Kohler1975"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/256495a0 |title=Continuous cultures of fused cells secreting antibody of predefined specificity |year=1975 |last1=Köhler |first1=G. |last2=Milstein |first2=C. |journal=Nature |volume=256 |issue=5517 |pages=495–7 |pmid=1172191|bibcode=1975Natur.256..495K }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting “[[hybridoma]]” from this combination expresses a desired [[antibody]] as determined by the B-cell involved, but is immortalized due to the myeloma component. The mechanism of PEG fusion has not been definitively identified, but some researchers believe that the PEG, by binding a large number of water molecules, effectively decreases the [[chemical activity]] of the water and thus dehydrates the lipid headgroups.&lt;ref name="Lentz1994"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0009-3084(94)90176-7 |title=Polymer-induced membrane fusion: Potential mechanism and relation to cell fusion events |year=1994 |last1=Lentz |first1=Barry R. |journal=Chemistry and Physics of Lipids |volume=73 |pages=91–106 |pmid=8001186 |issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fusion can also be artificially induced through [[electroporation]] in a process known as electrofusion. It is believed that this phenomenon results from the [[Lipid bilayer mechanics|energetically active edges]] formed during electroporation, which can act as the local defect point to nucleate stalk growth between two bilayers.&lt;ref name="Jordan1989"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=C.

==Assays to measure membrane fusion==
There are two levels of fusion: mixing of membrane lipids and mixing of contents. Assays of membrane fusion report either the mixing of membrane lipids or the mixing of the aqueous contents of the fused entities.

===Assays for measuring lipid mixing===
Assays evaluating lipid mixing make use of concentration dependent effects such as nonradiative energy transfer, fluorescence quenching and pyrene eximer formation.
[[File:Fret.svg|left|thumb|300px| (1.) Illustration of lipid mixing assay based on Förster resonance energy transfer.]][[File:Self-quenching.jpg|right|thumb|300px| (3.) Illustration of lipid mixing assay based on Fluorescence self-quenching.]]

When NBD and Rhodamine are within a certain distance, the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) happens. After fusion, resonance energy transfer (FRET) decreases when the average distance between probes increases, while NBD fluorescence increases.
#Pyrene Excimer Formation: [[Pyrene]] monomer and [[excimer]] emission wavelengths are different. The emission wavelength of monomer is around 400&amp;nbsp;nm and that of excimer is around 470&amp;nbsp;nm. In this method, membrane labeled with Pyrene combines with unlabeled membrane. Pyrene self associates in membrane and then excited pyrene excites other pyrene. Before fusion, the majority of the emission is excimer emission. After fusion, the distance between probes increases and the ratio of excimer emission decreases.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Assays for measuring content mixing===
Mixing of aqueous contents from vesicles as a result of lysis, fusion or physiological permeability can be detected fluorometrically using low molecular weight soluble tracers.

The world's '''superlative trees''' can be ranked by any factor. Records have been kept for trees with superlative height, trunk diameter or girth, canopy coverage, airspace volume, wood volume, estimated mass, and age.

==Tallest==
[[File:Redwood National Park REDW9343.jpg|upright|thumb|The [[conifer]]ous [[Sequoia sempervirens|Coast redwood]] (''Sequoia sempervirens'') is the tallest tree species on earth.]]

The heights of the tallest trees in the world have been the subject of considerable dispute and much exaggeration. Modern verified measurements with [[laser rangefinder]]s or with [[measuring tape|tape]] drop measurements made by tree climbers (such as those carried out by canopy researchers), have shown that some older [[tree height measurement]] methods are often unreliable, sometimes producing exaggerations of 5% to 15%  or more above the real height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nativetreesociety.org |title=Native Tree Society |publisher=Native Tree Society |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817101700/http://www.nativetreesociety.org/# |archive-date=2018-08-17 |access-date=2012-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical claims of trees growing to {{convert|130|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and even {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}}, are now largely disregarded as unreliable, and attributed to human error.

The largest trees are defined as having the highest wood volume in a single-stem. These trees are both tall and large in diameter and, in particular, hold a large diameter high up the trunk. Measurement is very complex, particularly if branch volume is to be included as well as the trunk volume, so measurements have only been made for a small number of trees, and generally only for the trunk. Few attempts have ever been made to include [[root]] or [[leaf]] volume.

[[File:TeMatuaNgahereWithPerson.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Trunk of [[Te Matua Ngahere]] ]]

The [[circumference|girth]] of a tree is usually much easier to measure than the height, as it is a simple matter of stretching a tape round the trunk, and pulling it taut to find the circumference. Despite this, UK tree author [[Alan Mitchell]] made the following comment about measurements of [[Taxus baccata|yew]] trees:

{{quote|The aberrations of past measurements of yews are beyond belief. For example, the tree at Tisbury has a well-defined, clean, if irregular bole at least 1.5&amp;nbsp;m long. It has been found to have a girth that dilated and shrunk in the following way: 11.28 m (1834 Loudon), 9.3&amp;nbsp;m (1892 Lowe), 10.67&amp;nbsp;m (1903 Elwes and Henry), 9.0 m (1924 E. Swanton), 9.45&amp;nbsp;m (1959 Mitchell)&amp;nbsp;... Earlier measurements have therefore been omitted.|Alan Mitchell; in a handbook "''Conifers in the British Isles''".&lt;ref name=afm2/&gt;}}

As a general standard, tree girth is taken at "breast height". This is converted to and cited as '''dbh''' ([[diameter at breast height]]) in tree and forestry literature.&lt;ref name=afm/&gt;&lt;ref name=hamilton/&gt; Breast height is defined differently in different situations, with most [[forestry]] measurements taking girth at 1.3 m above ground,&lt;ref name=hamilton&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=G. J.|year=1975|title=Forest Mensuration Handbook|publisher=Forestry Commission Booklet|volume=39|isbn=0-11-710023-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; while those who measure [[ornamental plant|ornamental trees]] usually measure at 1.5 m above ground;&lt;ref name=afm/&gt; in most cases this makes little difference to the measured girth. On sloping ground, the "above ground" reference point is usually taken as the highest point on the ground touching the trunk,&lt;ref name=afm&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=A. F.|year=1974|title=A Field Guide to the Trees of Britain and Northern Europe|publisher=Collins|isbn=0-00-212035-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hamilton/&gt; but in North America a point, that is the average of the highest point and the lowest point the tree trunk appears to contact the soil, is usually used.&lt;ref name=NTS_measuring_guidelines&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nativetreesociety.org/measure/Tree_Measuring_Guidelines-revised1.pdf |title=Tree Measuring Guidelines of the Eastern Native Tree Society |publisher=Native Tree Society |date= March 2008|accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the inflated old measurements may have been taken at ground level. Some past exaggerated measurements also result from measuring the complete next-to-bark measurement, pushing the tape in and out over every crevice and buttress.&lt;ref name=afm2&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=A. F.|year=1972|title=Conifers in the British Isles|publisher=Forestry Commission|id=Booklet 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measurements could also be influenced by deviation of the tape measure from a horizontal plane (which might seem called for if the trunk does not grow straight up), and the presence of features such as branches, spikes, ''etc''.

Modern trends are to cite the tree's [[diameter]] rather than the circumference. The diameter of the tree is calculated by finding the mean diameter of the trunk, in most cases obtained by dividing the measured circumference by [[pi|π]]; this assumes the trunk is mostly circular in cross-section (an oval or irregular cross-section would result in a mean diameter slightly greater than the assumed circle). Accurately measuring circumference or diameter is difficult in species with the large buttresses that are characteristic of many species of rainforest trees. Simple measurement of circumference of such trees can be misleading when the circumference includes much empty space between buttresses. See also [[Tree girth measurement]]

[[Baobab]]s (genus ''Adansonia'') store large amounts of [[water]] in the very soft wood in their trunks. This leads to marked variation in their girth over the year (though not more than about 2.5%&lt;ref name=Fenner&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fenner|first=M|year=1980|title=Some measurements on the water relations of baobab trees|journal=Biotropica|volume=12|pages=205–209|issue=3|doi=10.2307/2387972|jstor=2387972}}&lt;/ref&gt;), reaching maximum at the end of the rainy season, and minimum at the end of the dry season.

Measurements become ambiguous when multiple trunks (whether from an individual tree or multiple trees) grow together.
The [[Sacred Fig]] grows adventitious roots from its branches, which become new trunks when the root reaches the ground and thickens; a single sacred fig tree can have hundreds of such trunks.&lt;ref name=rhs&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Huxley |editor-first=A |year=1992 |title=New RHS Dictionary of Gardening |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=0-333-47494-5 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The multi-stemmed [[Hundred Horse Chestnut]] was known to have a circumference of {{convert|57.9|m|ft|abbr=on}} when it was measured in 1780.

There are known more than 50 species of trees exceeding the diameter of 4.45 m or circumference of 14 m.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Oldest==
[[File:Big bristlecone pine Pinus longaeva.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Pinus longaeva|Great Basin bristlecone pine]] (''Pinus longaeva'') is the longest living tree species on earth.]]

{{Main|List of oldest trees}}
The [[list of long-living organisms|oldest]] trees are determined by [[Dendrochronology|growth rings]], which can be seen if the tree is cut down, or in cores taken from the bark to the center of the tree. Accurate determination is only possible for trees that produce growth rings, generally those in seasonal climates. Trees in uniform non-seasonal tropical climates grow continuously and do not have distinct growth rings. It is also only possible for trees that are solid to the center. Many very old trees become hollow as the dead [[heartwood]] decays. For some of these species, age estimates have been made on the basis of extrapolating current growth rates, but the results are usually largely speculation. White (1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=J|year=1990|title=Estimating the Age of Large and Veteran Trees in Britain|publisher=Forestry Commission|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes a method of estimating the age of large and veteran trees in the [[United Kingdom]] through the correlation of a tree's age with its diameter and growth character.

The verified oldest measured ages are:

The oldest known European Yew may be the [[Llangernyw Yew]] in the Churchyard of [[Llangernyw]] village in [[North Wales]], or the [[Fortingall Yew]] in [[Perthshire]], Scotland.

The pond cypress, ''[[Taxodium ascendens]]'', has been known to live more than 1,000 years. One specimen in particular, named "The Senator", was estimated to be more than 3,400 years old at the time of its demise in early 2012.

==Thickest tree limbs==
This list is limited to horizontal or nearly horizontal limbs, in which the governing growth factor is phototropism. Vertical or near vertical limbs, in which the governing growth factor is negative geotropism, are called "reiterations" and are really divisions of the trunk, which by definition must be less than the trunk as a whole and therefore less remarkable. The thickest trunks have already been dealt with under "stoutest".{{clarify|date=September 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6834">The '''Mappae clavicula''' is a medieval Latin text containing manufacturing recipes for crafts materials, including for metals, glass, mosaics, and dyes and tints for materials. The information and style in the recipes is very terse. Each recipe consists of the names of the ingredients and typically about two sentences on combining the ingredients together. A small minority of the recipes go to about six sentences. The text comes with a short preamble, and other than that it is just recipes. The number of recipes was expanded over the course of the medieval centuries, and some medieval copies have deletions as well as additions, so it is better thought of as a family of texts with a largely common core, not a single text. Most of the ''Mappae Clavicula'' recipes are also in medieval Latin in a text known as the ''Compositiones ad Tingenda'' (English: "Recipes for Coloring (or Tingeing)").&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2848238 "Notes on Some Manuscripts of the ''Mappae Clavicula''"], by Rozelle P. Johnson, year 1935. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/226251 A Review of ''Compositiones variae'' from Codex 490, Biblioteca Capitolare], by Lynn White, year 1940. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rB3cIVVq-YUC&amp;pg=PA32 ''Books of Secrets in Medieval and Early Modern Culture''], by William Eamon, year 1996, pages 32-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and accretion ==
The core was probably originally compiled around AD 600, perhaps in [[Alexandria]] in Egypt, in Greek. The core contains items traceable to earlier Alexandrian Greek texts, particularly the [[Papyrus Graecus Holmiensis|Stockholm papyrus]] and [[Leyden papyrus X|Leiden Papyrus X]], which are Greek texts dated to the 2nd or 3rd century AD that contain some of the same and similar recipes. The first few recipes in the Phillipps-Corning manuscript&lt;ref name=PhillippsCorning /&gt; of the ''Mappae clavicula'' were long considered integral, but they form a distinct separate entity,  the ''De coloribus et mixtionibus'', which survives (in whole or in part) in at least 62 manuscripts.&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;Clarke, M. (2001) ''The Art of All Colours: Mediaeval Recipe Books for Painters and Illuminators''. London: Archetype Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; The core of the Latin ''Mappae clavicula'' is very likely a translation of a Greek text, although the original Greek text (if it existed) does not exist today.

The best manuscripts of the ''Mappae clavicula'' date from the eighth to the twelfth century.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, C. S. and J. G. Hawthorne (1974) ‘Mappae Clavicula: A Little Key to the World of Medieval Techniques’, ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society: Held at Philadelphia for promoting useful knowledge'' (new series) 64 (4) [occupies whole issue].&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the fullest collections of recipes is in a certain manuscript dated late 12th century in which about 300 recipes are presented. In this manuscript, called the Phillipps-Corning manuscript, some of the names for some materials are Arabic names (e.g. ''alquibriz'' from the Arabic for sulphur, ''atincar'' from the Arabic for borax, ''alcazir'' from the Arabic for tin).&lt;ref name=PhillippsCorning&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/archaeologiaormi32sociuoft#page/187/mode/1up ''Mappae clavicula'' from a 12th-century manuscript], text published in Latin by Thomas Phillipps in year 1847. The original manuscript that Thomas Phillipps possessed, dated late 12th century, is now in the hands of the Corning Museum of Glass. Hence it is referred to as "the Phillipps-Corning manuscript". A digital image of it is downloadable at the [http://www.cmog.org/library/manuscript-mappae-clavicula Corning Museum of Glass, MS 5].&lt;/ref&gt; The recipes containing the Arabic names are historically later, and are in all likelihood no earlier than the 12th century. Certain earlier manuscripts have about 200 recipes.

The  principal manuscripts are:
* The ''Lucca MS'', Lucca, Biblioteca Capitolare Feliniana, Codex 490, the oldest witness, c. 800.
* The Sélestat MS, Sélestat, Bibliothèque Humaniste, MS 17. A very full yet old witness, early ninth century.
* The ''Codex Matritensis'' ('Madrid codex'), Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional, MS A.16 (Was: MS A.19), c. 1130.
* The Phillipps-Corning Manuscript, Corning Museum of Glass, MS 5, late twelfth century.&lt;ref name=PhillippsCorning /&gt;

These  are simply among the fullest [[Textual criticism|witnesses]] - there are dozens more that preserve extracts.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;

== Title ==
The title, ''Mappae clavicula'', is absurd, translating approximately as 'the little key to the small cloth'. The best explanation is that it is a mis-translation from a Greek original, in which χειρόκμητον ''kheirókmēton'' ('knack' or 'trick of the trade') was mis-read as χειρόμακτρον ''kheirómaktron'' ('hand-towel').&lt;ref&gt;Robert Halleux, 'Recettes d'artisan, recettes d'alchimiste', in: R. Jansen-Sieben (ed.) ''Artes mechanicae'', Archives et bibliothèques de Belgique, no. spécial 34 (Brussels, 1989), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the observation that certain recipes derive from the Greek technical papyri, the [[Leyden papyrus X]] and the [[Papyrus Graecus Holmiensis|Stockholm papyrus]].

'''Military step''' or '''march''' is a regular, ordered and synchronized [[walking]] of [[military formation]]s.

==History==
The steady, regular [[marching]] step was a marked feature of [[Roman legion]]s. [[Vegetius]], the author of the only surviving treatise on the Roman Empire's military, ''[[De Re Militari]]'', recognized the importance of

&lt;blockquote&gt;constant practice of marching quick and together. Nor is anything of more consequence either on the march or in the line than that they should keep their ranks with the greatest exactness. For troops who march in an irregular and disorderly manner are always in great danger of being defeated. They should march with the common military step twenty [[Mile#Roman_mile|miles]] in five summer-hours, and with the full step, which is quicker, twenty-four miles in the same number of hours. If they exceed this pace, they no longer march but run, and no certain rate can be assigned.&lt;ref&gt;''[[De Re Militari]]'', Book I: ''The Selection and Training of New Levies''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Military marching of foot formations into a battle was a common practice in most European countries for centuries, and was even carried over into the new world as recently as the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]]. Since then, it has been phased out by advances in [[military equipment]] and [[military tactics|tactics]]; however, [[Foot drill]] remains an important part of [[military education and training]].

== Marching types ==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:German Troops In Warsaw.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Wehrmacht]] troops [[Goose-Step]] through [[Warsaw]]]] --&gt;
The following commands specify different types of marching:

* '''Quick March''': This is an instruction to begin marching at the Quick March speed with the left foot. The standard pace is 116 beats per minute with a 30-inch step, with variations for individual regiments, the pace given by the commander, and the speed of the band's rhythm: British [[light infantry]] and rifle regiments, for example, Quick March at 140 beats per minute, a legacy of their original role as highly mobile skirmishers. [[Highland regiments]], which march to bagpipe music, march at 112 paces per minute.
* Australian Army Quick Time is 116 paces per minute with a 75cm pace  
* Canadian Forces Quick March is 120 paces per minute with a 75cm pace

The way the march is performed is based on the regiment's nationality. [[Western Bloc]] nations typically lift their opposite arm up to the breast pocket, kept straight and used similar to a guided pendulum. [[Eastern Bloc]] nations and several Latin American, Asian and African nations frequently used the [[goose step]], with legs straight during the entirety of the step. Both of these function to maintain individual pace, unit pace uniformity, and actually help the soldiers march in their relatively elevated pace. The [[United States]] command is '''"For-ward, MARCH."''' Arm movement is kept to 9&amp;nbsp;inches to the front and 6&amp;nbsp;inches to the rear (6&amp;nbsp;inches and 3&amp;nbsp;inches, respectively, in the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force) while marching, while the interval between ranks and files is both 40&amp;nbsp;inches. The light infantry version of the march is also used by the [[Spanish Legion]] during parades, as well as the [[Chasseurs]] of the [[French Army]] ([[Chasseurs alpins]] inclusive).
* '''Slow March''': This is a ceremonial pace, used for funeral marches and when a unit's colours are marched out in front of the troops.  The feet are kept parallel to the ground and the arms are never used. In the United States Marine Corps, arms swing as the distance they normally would in quicktime, but at the same pace as marching.  U.S. Marine Color Guards do not swing their arms.  Slow March is typically used in the Marine Corps for funeral details and ceremonies such as the Marine Corps Ball (when the cake is escorted out).  In Spain, Latin America, and the Philippines this is done during religious processions whenever a military band joins it. This march style is the official parade march in the armed forces of [[Bolivia]] and [[Ecuador]] and the military academies and schools of [[Venezuela]], done with the goose step during parades and ceremonies. It is the iconic march step used in the [[French Foreign Legion]]. The standard pace is 60 paces per minute (88 for the FFL).
* Australian Army Slow Time is 70 paces per minute with a 75cm pace.
* '''Half Step March''' or '''Cut the pace''': This is a U.S. march pace. It is at the same tempo as Quick Time, but instead of 30&amp;nbsp;inches, the step is 15&amp;nbsp;inches.
* '''Double March''': This is essentially a moderate jog at approximately 180 36 inch paces per minute. It creates a travel speed of approximately double that of Quick Time, designed to be used even when carrying heavy burdens. This is often erroneously used to describe a sprint or an ordinary run. The U.S. command is '''"Double Time, MARCH."''' This is also used by the elite airborne units and special forces of the [[National Armed Forces of Venezuela]] as well as in the Armed Forces of Bolivia and soldiers of the Italian Army's [[Bersaglieri]] on parades and ceremonies.
* '''Easy March''': This is an unrestricted march at approximately Quick Time. This is designed for field marches and other rough conditions, though is not used in combat areas. The U.S. command is '''"Route-step, MARCH."'''
* '''Mark Time''': The [[military mark time]] is essentially a stationary march with the knees coming up parallel to the ground or the foot dangling six inches off the ground. The time of what they were previously marching is kept or Quick March is used if no time is supplied. This is designed to maintain the time of large parades when portions need no forward speed, but is also used as a common punishment for physical training because of its tiring nature. United States service members move the knees upward approximately 6&amp;nbsp;inches.
* '''Step For -Ward''' or '''Forward''' or '''Forward, March''': This causes troops marking time to resume a normal march. If it is implicitly used (as when the marking time is used to align formations or to wait for the former rank to pass when entering "Column of Route" from a depth-style formation) the (typically) Right Marker stomps his foot to signal it to the rest of the troops.

[[File:P np np-complete np-hard.svg|thumb|300px|right|[[Euler diagram]] for [[P (complexity)|P]], [[NP (complexity)|NP]], NP-complete, and [[NP-hard]] set of problems.  The left side is valid under the assumption that [[P versus NP problem|P≠NP]], while the right side is valid under the assumption that P=NP (except that the empty language and its complement are never NP-complete)]]

In [[computational complexity theory]], an '''NP-complete''' [[decision problem]] is one belonging to both the  [[NP (complexity)|NP]] and the [[NP-hard]] complexity classes. In this context, '''NP''' stands for "[[Non-deterministic Turing machine#Deterministic Turing Machine|nondeterministic]] [[polynomial time]]". The set of NP-complete problems is often denoted by '''NP-C''' or '''NPC'''. 

Although a solution to an NP-complete problem can be verified "quickly," there is no known way to find a solution quickly. That is, the time required to solve the problem using any currently known [[algorithm]] increases rapidly as the size of the problem grows. As a consequence, determining whether it is possible to solve these problems quickly, called the [[P versus NP problem]], is one of the fundamental [[List of open problems in computer science|unsolved problems in computer science]] today.

While a method for computing the solutions to NP-complete problems quickly remains undiscovered, [[computer scientist]]s and [[computer programmer|programmer]]s still frequently encounter NP-complete problems. NP-complete problems are often addressed by using [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] methods and [[approximation algorithm]]s.

In this context "quickly" means in [[polynomial time]]. That is, "efficient" or "fast" algorithms can be developed to solve the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Cobham | first=Alan | authorlink=Alan Cobham | year = 1965 | chapter = The intrinsic computational difficulty of functions | title = Proc. Logic, Methodology, and Philosophy of Science II | publisher = North Holland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
NP-complete problems are in [[NP (complexity)|NP]], the set of all [[decision problem]]s whose solutions can be verified in polynomial time; ''NP'' may be equivalently defined as the set of decision problems that can be solved in polynomial time on a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]]. A problem ''p'' in NP is NP-complete if every other problem in NP can be transformed (or reduced) into ''p'' in polynomial time.

It is not known whether every problem in NP can be quickly solved—this is called the [[P versus NP problem]]. But if ''any NP-complete problem'' can be solved quickly, then ''every problem in NP'' can, because the definition of an NP-complete problem states that every problem in NP must be quickly reducible to every NP-complete problem (that is, it can be reduced in polynomial time). Because of this, it is often said that NP-complete problems are ''harder'' or ''more difficult'' than NP problems in general.

== Formal definition ==
{{See Also |P %3D NP problem#NP-completeness |l1 = formal definition for NP-completeness (article ''P = NP'')}}

A decision problem &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C&lt;/math&gt; is NP-complete if:
# &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C&lt;/math&gt; is in NP, and
# Every problem in NP is [[Many-one reduction|reducible]] to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C&lt;/math&gt; in polynomial time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = J. van Leeuwen |year = 1998 |title = Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science |publisher = Elsevier |ISBN = 0-262-72014-0 |page = 84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C&lt;/math&gt; can be shown to be in NP by demonstrating that a candidate solution to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C&lt;/math&gt; can be verified in polynomial time.

Note that a problem satisfying condition 2 is said to be [[NP-hard]], whether or not it satisfies condition 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = J. van Leeuwen |year = 1998 |title = Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science |publisher = Elsevier |ISBN = 0-262-72014-0 |page = 80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A consequence of this definition is that if we had a polynomial time algorithm (on a [[Universal Turing machine|UTM]], or any other [[Turing completeness|Turing-equivalent]] [[abstract machine]]) for &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C&lt;/math&gt;, we could solve all problems in NP in polynomial time.

== Background ==

The concept of NP-completeness was introduced in 1971 (see [[Cook–Levin theorem]]), though the term ''NP-complete'' was introduced later. At 1971 [[STOC]] conference, there was a fierce debate among the computer scientists about whether NP-complete problems could be solved in polynomial time on a [[deterministic]] [[Turing machine]]. [[John Hopcroft]] brought everyone at the conference to a consensus that the question of whether NP-complete problems are solvable in polynomial time should be put off to be solved at some later date, since nobody had any formal proofs for their claims one way or the other.  This is known as the question of whether P=NP.

Nobody has yet been able to determine conclusively whether NP-complete problems are in fact solvable in polynomial time, making this one of the great [[unsolved problems of mathematics]].  The [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] is offering a US $1 million reward to anyone who has a formal proof that P=NP or that P≠NP.

The [[Cook–Levin theorem]] states that the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]] is NP-complete (a simpler, but still highly technical [[Proof that Boolean satisfiability problem is NP-complete|proof of this]] is available). In 1972, [[Richard Karp]] proved that several other problems were also NP-complete (see [[Karp's 21 NP-complete problems]]); thus there is a class of NP-complete problems (besides the Boolean satisfiability problem). Since the original results, thousands of other problems have been shown to be NP-complete by reductions from other problems previously shown to be NP-complete; many of these problems are collected in [[Michael Garey|Garey]] and [[David S. Johnson|Johnson's]] 1979 book ''[[Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness]]''.&lt;ref name="GareyJohnson"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Garey |first1=Michael&amp;nbsp;R. |authorlink1 = Michael R.

== NP-complete problems ==
[[File:Relative NPC chart.svg|thumb|right|Some NP-complete problems, indicating the [[reduction (complexity)|reductions]] typically used to prove their NP-completeness]]
{{Main|List of NP-complete problems}}

An interesting example is the [[graph isomorphism problem]], the [[graph theory]] problem of determining whether a [[graph isomorphism]] exists between two graphs.  Two graphs are [[isomorphic]] if one can be [[isomorphism|transformed]] into the other simply by renaming [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]]. Consider these two problems:
* Graph Isomorphism: Is graph G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; isomorphic to graph G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;?
* Subgraph Isomorphism: Is graph G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; isomorphic to a subgraph of graph G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;?

The Subgraph Isomorphism problem is NP-complete. The graph isomorphism problem is suspected to be neither in P nor NP-complete, though it is in NP. This is an example of a problem that is thought to be '''hard''', but is not thought to be NP-complete.

The easiest way to prove that some new problem is NP-complete is first to prove that it is in NP, and then to reduce some known NP-complete problem to it. Therefore, it is useful to know a variety of NP-complete problems. The list below contains some well-known problems that are NP-complete when expressed as decision problems.

To the right is a diagram of some of the problems and the [[reduction (complexity)|reductions]] typically used to prove their NP-completeness. In this diagram, an arrow from one problem to another indicates the direction of the reduction.  Note that this diagram is misleading as a description of the mathematical relationship between these problems, as there exists a [[polynomial-time reduction]] between any two NP-complete problems; but it indicates where demonstrating this polynomial-time reduction has been easiest.

There is often only a small difference between a problem in P and an NP-complete problem. For example, the [[3-satisfiability]] problem, a restriction of the boolean satisfiability problem, remains NP-complete, whereas the slightly more restricted [[2-satisfiability]] problem is in P (specifically, [[NL-complete]]), and the slightly more general max. 2-sat. problem is again NP-complete. Determining whether a graph can be colored with 2 colors is in P, but with 3 colors is NP-complete, even when restricted to [[planar graph]]s. Determining if a graph is a [[cycle graph|cycle]] or is [[bipartite graph|bipartite]] is very easy (in [[L (complexity)|L]]), but finding a maximum bipartite or a maximum cycle subgraph is NP-complete. A solution of the [[knapsack problem]] within any fixed percentage of the optimal solution can be computed in polynomial time, but finding the optimal solution is NP-complete.

== Solving NP-complete problems ==
At present, all known algorithms for NP-complete problems require time that is [[superpolynomial]] in the input size, and it is unknown whether there are any faster algorithms.

The following techniques can be applied to solve computational problems in general, and they often give rise to substantially faster algorithms:
* [[Approximation algorithm|Approximation]]: Instead of searching for an optimal solution, search for a solution that is at most a factor from an optimal one.
* [[Randomized algorithm|Randomization]]: Use randomness to get a faster average [[running time]], and allow the algorithm to fail with some small probability. Note: The [[Monte Carlo method]] is not an example of an efficient algorithm in this specific sense, although evolutionary approaches like [[Genetic algorithm]]s may be.
* Restriction: By restricting the structure of the input (e.g., to planar graphs), faster algorithms are usually possible.
* [[Parameterized complexity|Parameterization]]: Often there are fast algorithms if certain parameters of the input are fixed.
* [[Heuristic (computer science)|Heuristic]]: An algorithm that works "reasonably well" in many cases, but for which there is no proof that it is both always fast and always produces a good result.  [[Metaheuristic]] approaches are often used.

One example of a heuristic algorithm is a suboptimal &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle O(n\log n)&lt;/math&gt; [[greedy coloring|greedy coloring algorithm]] used for [[graph coloring problem|graph coloring]] during the [[register allocation]] phase of some compilers, a technique called [[graph-coloring global register allocation]]. Each vertex is a variable, edges are drawn between variables which are being used at the same time, and colors indicate the register assigned to each variable. Because most [[RISC]] machines have a fairly large number of general-purpose registers, even a heuristic approach is effective for this application.

== Completeness under different types of reduction ==
In the definition of NP-complete given above, the term ''reduction'' was used in the technical meaning of a polynomial-time [[many-one reduction]].

Another type of reduction is polynomial-time Turing reduction.  A problem &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X&lt;/math&gt; is polynomial-time Turing-reducible to a problem &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Y&lt;/math&gt; if, given a subroutine that solves &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Y&lt;/math&gt; in polynomial time, one could write a program that calls this subroutine and solves &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X&lt;/math&gt; in polynomial time.  This contrasts with many-one reducibility, which has the restriction that the program can only call the subroutine once, and the return value of the subroutine must be the return value of the program.

If one defines the analogue to NP-complete with Turing reductions instead of  many-one reductions, the resulting set of problems won't be smaller than NP-complete; it is an open question whether it will be any larger.

Another type of reduction that is also often used to define NP-completeness is the [[logarithmic-space many-one reduction]] which is a many-one reduction that can be computed with only a logarithmic amount of space. Since every computation that can be done in [[logarithmic space]] can also be done in polynomial time it follows that if there is a logarithmic-space many-one reduction then there is also a polynomial-time many-one reduction. This type of reduction is more refined than the more usual polynomial-time many-one reductions and it allows us to distinguish more classes such as [[P-complete]]. Whether under these types of reductions the definition of NP-complete changes is still an open problem. All currently known NP-complete problems are NP-complete under log space reductions. All currently known NP-complete problems remain NP-complete even under much weaker reductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1006/jcss.1998.1583 | last1=Agrawal | first1=M. | author1-link=Manindra Agrawal | last2=Allender | first2=E. | last3=Rudich | first3=Steven | author3-link=Steven Rudich | title=Reductions in Circuit Complexity: An Isomorphism Theorem and a Gap Theorem | publisher=[[Academic Press]]  | year=1998 | journal=Journal of Computer and System Sciences | issn=1090-2724 | volume=57 | issue=2 | pages=127–143 | postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

== Naming ==
According to [[Donald Knuth]], the name "NP-complete" was popularized by [[Alfred Aho]], [[John Hopcroft]] and [[Jeffrey Ullman]] in their celebrated textbook "The Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms".  He reports that they introduced the change in the [[galley proofs]] for the book (from "polynomially-complete"), in accordance with the results of a poll he had conducted of the [[theoretical computer science]] community.&lt;ref&gt;[[Don Knuth]], Tracy Larrabee, and Paul M. Roberts, ''[http://tex.loria.fr/typographie/mathwriting.pdf Mathematical Writing]'' § 25, ''MAA Notes No. 14'', MAA, 1989 (also [[Stanford University|Stanford]] Technical Report, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Other suggestions made in the poll&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The following misconceptions are frequent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2000/000113/full/news000113-10.html

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''"NP-complete problems are the most difficult known problems."'' Since NP-complete problems are in NP, their running time is at most exponential. However, some problems &lt;!-- the next word is PROVABLY (as in "to prove" something), not PROBABLY. Do not 'fix' it! --&gt;provably&lt;!-- proVVVVably --&gt; require more time, for example [[Presburger arithmetic]].
* ''"NP-complete problems are difficult because there are so many different solutions."'' On the one hand, there are many problems that have a solution space just as large, but can be solved in polynomial time (for example [[minimum spanning tree]]). On the other hand, there are NP-problems with at most one solution that are NP-hard under randomized polynomial-time reduction (see [[Valiant–Vazirani theorem]]).
* ''"Solving NP-complete problems requires exponential time."'' First, this would imply P ≠ NP, which is still an unsolved question. Further, some NP-complete problems actually have algorithms running in superpolynomial, but subexponential time such as O(2&lt;sup&gt;{{sqrt|''n''}}&lt;/sup&gt;''n''). For example, the [[Independent set problem|independent set]] and [[Dominating set problem|dominating set]] problems are NP-complete when restricted to [[planar graph]]s, but can be solved in subexponential time on [[planar graph]]s using the [[planar separator theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bern|1990}}; {{harvtxt|Deĭneko|Klinz|Woeginger|2006}}; {{harvtxt|Dorn|Penninks|Bodlaender|Fomin|2005}}; {{harvtxt|Lipton|Tarjan|1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''"All instances of an NP-complete problem are difficult."'' Often some instances, or even most instances, may be easy to solve within polynomial time. However, unless P=NP, any polynomial-time algorithm must asymptotically be wrong on more than polynomially many of the exponentially many inputs of a certain size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hemaspaandra | first1 = L.

* ''"If P=NP, all cryptographic ciphers can be broken."'' A polynomial-time problem can be very difficult to solve in practice if the polynomial's degree or constants are large enough. For example, ciphers with a fixed key length, such as [[Advanced Encryption Standard]], can all be broken in constant time (and are thus already known to be in P), though with current technology that constant may exceed the age of the universe. In addition, [[Information-theoretic security|information-theoretic security]] provides cryptographic methods that cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power.

== Properties ==
Viewing a [[decision problem#Definition|decision problem]] as a formal language in some fixed encoding, the set NPC of all NP-complete problems is '''not closed''' under:
* [[Union (set theory)|union]]
* [[intersection]]
* [[concatenation]]
* [[Kleene star]]

It is not known whether NPC is closed under [[Complement (complexity)|complementation]], since NPC=[[co-NP-complete|co-NPC]] if and only if NP=[[co-NP]], and whether NP=co-NP is an [[Open problem|open question]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title = Complexity and Cryptography: An Introduction |first1 = John |last1 = Talbot|first2=D.

A '''''nomen oblitum''''' (Plural: nomina oblita; [[Latin]] for "forgotten name") is a technical term, used in zoological nomenclature, for a particular kind of disused scientific name.

In its present meaning, the ''nomen oblitum'' came into being with the fourth, 1999, edition of the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]''. After 1 January 2000, a scientific name may be formally declared to be a ''nomen oblitum'' when it has been shown not to have been used as a valid name within the scientific community since 1899, and when it is either a senior [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] (there is also a more recent name which applies to the same taxon, and which is in common use) or a [[Homonym (biology)|homonym]] (it is spelled the same as another name, which is in common use), and when the preferred junior synonym or homonym has been shown to be in wide use in 50 or more publications in the past few decades. Once a name has formally been declared to be a ''nomen oblitum'', the disused name is to be 'forgotten'. By the same act, the next [[available name]] must be declared to be a '''''nomen protectum'''''; from then on, it takes precedence.&lt;ref name=iczn1999&gt;ICZN 1999 (International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, 1999 Ed.) - http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/&lt;/ref&gt;

An example is the case of the scientific name for the [[leopard shark]]. Despite the name ''Mustelus felis'' being the [[senior synonym]], an error in recording the dates of publication resulted in the widespread use of ''Triakis semifasciata'' as the leopard shark's scientific name. After this long-standing error was discovered, ''T. semifasciata'' was made the valid name (as a ''nomen protectum'') and ''Mustelis felis'' was declared invalid (as a ''nomen oblitum'').&lt;ref name="pietsch"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pietsch, T.W. |author2=Orr, J.W. |author3=Eschmeyer, W.N. |title=''Mustelus felis'' Ayres, 1854, a Senior Synonym of the Leopard Shark, ''Triakis semifasciata'' Girard, 1855 (Carchariniformes: Triakidae), Invalidated by "Reversal of Precedence" |journal=Copeia |volume=2012 |year=2012 |pages=98–99 |doi=10.1643/ci-11-089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in taxonomy==
The designation ''nomen oblitum'' has been used relatively frequently to keep the priority of old, sometimes disused names, and, controversially, often without establishing that a name actually meets the criteria for the designation. Some taxonomists have regarded the failure to properly establish the ''nomen oblitum'' designation as a way to avoid doing taxonomic research or to retain a preferred name regardless of priority. When discussing the taxonomy of North American birds, Rea (1983) stated that "...Swainson's [older but disused] name must stand unless it can be demonstrated conclusively to be a ''nomen oblitum'' (a game some taxonomists play to avoid their supposed fundamental principle, priority)."&lt;ref name="rea1983"&gt;REA, A.M. (1983). ''Once A River''. Tucson: University of Arizona Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Banks and Browning (1995) responded directly to Rea's strict application of ICZN rules for determining ''nomina oblita'', stating: "We believe that the fundamental obligation of taxonomists is to promote stability, and that the principle of priority is but one way in which this can be effected. We see no stability in resurrecting a name of uncertain basis that has been used in several different ways to replace a name that has been used uniformly for most of a century."&lt;ref name="banksbrowning1995"&gt;Banks, R.C., &amp; Browning, M.R. (1995). "Comments on the status of revived old names for some North American birds." ''The Auk'', '''112'''(3): 633-648.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Palm Center''' is a [[think tank]] founded in 1998 at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], that produces scholarship designed to improve the quality of public dialogue about critical and controversial [[public policy]] issues. It commissions and disseminates research in the areas of gender, sexuality, and the military that has been published in leading social scientific journals and cited in the press. The Palm Center is a resource for university-affiliated as well as independent scholars, students, journalists, opinion leaders, and members of the public.

At its founding in 1998, it was known as the Center for the Study of [[Sexual minorities|Sexual Minorities]] in the Military. It was renamed in 2006 in recognition of a one million dollar endowment gift from the Michael D. Palm Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronoicle of Philanthropy'': [http://philanthropy.com/article/Philanthropys-Military/128431/ Anthony Bowen and Andrew Lane, "End of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” Is a Victory for Philanthropy," July 26, 2011], accessed February 1, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Palm Center's research has been cited on the floor of Congress and covered by newspapers and radio and television stations throughout the world.

[[File:Parapatric Speciation Schematic.svg|Right|thumb|300px|A diagram representing population subject to a selective gradient of phenotypic or genotypic frequencies (a cline). Each end of the gradient experiences different selective conditions (divergent selection). Reproductive isolation occurs upon the formation of a hybrid zone. In most cases, the hybrid zone may become eliminated due to a selective disadvantage. This effectively completes the speciation process.]]
{{Evolutionary biology}}
In '''parapatric speciation''', two subpopulations of a species evolve [[reproductive isolation]] from one another while continuing to exchange [[genes]]. This mode of [[speciation]] has three distinguishing characteristics: 1) mating occurs non-randomly, 2) [[gene flow]] occurs unequally, and 3) populations exist in either continuous or discontinuous geographic ranges. This distribution pattern may be the result of unequal [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]], incomplete geographical barriers, or [[Genetic divergence|divergent]] expressions of behavior, among other things. Parapatric speciation predicts that hybrid zones will often exist at the junction between the two populations.

In [[biogeography]], the terms '''parapatric''' and '''parapatry''' are often used to describe the relationship between [[organism]]s whose ranges do not significantly overlap but are immediately adjacent to each other; they do not occur together except in a narrow contact zone. Parapatry is a geographical distribution opposed to [[sympatry]] (same area) and [[allopatry]] or [[peripatry]] (two similar cases of distinct areas).

Various "forms" of parapatry have been proposed and are discussed below. [[Jerry Coyne|Coyne]] and [[H. Allen Orr|Orr]] in ''Speciation'' categorise these forms into three groups: [[cline (biology)|clinal]] (environmental gradients), "stepping-stone" (discrete populations), and stasipatric speciation in concordance with most of the parapatric speciation literature.&lt;ref name="Speciation"&gt;{{Citation | title=Speciation | author1=Jerry A. Coyne |author1link=Jerry Coyne |author2=H. Allen Orr |author2link=H. Allen Orr | date=2004 | pages=1–545 | publisher=Sinauer Associates | isbn=0-87893-091-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|111}} Henceforth, the models are subdivided following a similar format.

[[Charles Darwin]] was the first to propose this mode of speciation. It was not until 1930 when [[Ronald Fisher]] published ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]'' where he outlined a verbal theoretical model of '''clinal speciation'''. In 1981, [[Joseph Felsenstein]] proposed an alternative, "discrete population" model (the "stepping-stone model). Since Darwin, a great deal of research has been conducted on parapatric speciation—concluding that its mechanisms are theoretically plausible, "and has most certainly occurred in nature".&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|124}}

== Models ==
Mathematical models, laboratory studies, and observational evidence supports the existence of parapatric speciation's occurrence in nature. The qualities of parapatry imply a partial extrinsic barrier during divergence;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Sympatric, parapatric or allopatric: the most important way to classify speciation? | author=Roger K. Butlin, Juan Galindo, and John W. Grahame | journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B | year=2008 | volume=363 | pages=2997–3007 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0076 | pmc=2607313 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus leading to a difficulty in determining whether this mode of speciation actually occurred, or if an alternative mode (notably, [[allopatric speciation]]) can explain the data. This problem poses the unanswered question as to its overall frequency in nature.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|124}}

Parapatric speciation can be understood as a level of gene flow between populations where &lt;math&gt;m=0&lt;/math&gt; in allopatry (and peripatry), &lt;math&gt;m=0.5&lt;/math&gt; in sympatry, and midway between the two in parapatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Fitness landscapes and the origin of species | edition= | author=Sergey Gavrilets | date=2004 | pages=13 | publisher=Princeton University Press | isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intrinsic to this, parapatry covers the entire continuum; represented as &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; m &lt; 0.5&lt;/math&gt;. Some biologists reject this delineation, advocating the disuse of the term "parapatric" outright, "because many different spatial distributions can result in intermediate levels of gene flow".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Language of Speciation | author=Richard G. Harrison | journal=Evolution | year=2012 | volume=66 | issue=12 | pages=3643–3657 | doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01785.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others champion this position and suggest the abandonment of geographic classification schemes (geographic modes of speciation) altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Sympatric speciation in animals: the ugly duckling grows up | author=Sara Via | journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | year=2001 | volume=16 | issue=1 | pages=381–390 | doi= 10.1016/S0169-5347(01)02188-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Natural selection]] has been shown to be the primary driver in parapatric speciation (among other modes),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Speciation Revolution | author=J. Mallet | journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology | year=2001 | volume=14 | issue=6 | pages=887–888 | doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.2001.00342.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the strength of selection during divergence is often an important factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Theory and speciation | author=Michael Turelli, Nicholas H. Barton, and Jerry A. Coyne | journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | year=2001 | volume=16 | issue=7 | pages=330–343 | doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(01)02177-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parapatric speciation may also result from reproductive isolation caused by [[social selection]]: individuals interacting [[Altruism (biology)|altruistically]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Socially Mediated Speciation | author=Michael E. Hochberg, Barry Sinervo, and Sam P. Brown | journal=Evolution | year=2003 | volume=57 | issue=1 | pages=154–158 | doi=10.1554/0014-3820(2003)057[0154:sms]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental gradients ===
Due to the continuous nature of a parapatric population distribution, population niches will often overlap, producing a continuum in the species’ ecological role across an environmental gradient.&lt;ref name="ClineSpeciation"&gt;{{Citation |title=Speciation along environmental gradients | author=Michael Doebeli and Ulf Dieckmann | journal=Nature | year=2003 | volume=421 | pages=259–264 | doi=10.1038/nature01274 | bibcode=2003Natur.421..259D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas in allopatric or peripatric speciation—in which geographically isolated populations may evolve reproductive isolation without gene flow—the reduced gene flow of parapatric speciation will often produce a [[cline (biology)|cline]] in which a variation in evolutionary pressures causes a change to occur in [[Allele frequency|allele frequencies]] within the [[gene pool]] between populations. This environmental gradient ultimately results in genetically distinct sister species.

[[Ronald Fisher|Fisher's]] original conception of clinal speciation relied on (unlike most modern speciation research) the [[morphological species concept]].&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|113}} With this interpretation, his verbal, theoretical model ''can'' effectively produce a new species; of which was subsequently confirmed mathematically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Selection for migration modification | author=Beverley J. Balkau and Marcus W. Feldman | journal=Genetics | year=1973 | volume=74 | issue=1 | pages=171–174 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|113}} Further mathematical models have been developed to demonstrate the possibility of clinal speciation with most relying on, what Coyne and Orr assert are, "assumptions that are either restrictive or biologically unrealistic".&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|113}}

A mathematical model for clinal speciation was developed by Caisse and Antonovics that found evidence that, "both genetic divergence and reproductive isolation may therefore occur between populations connected by gene flow".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Evolution in closely adjacent plant populations | author=Michelle Caisse and Janis Antonovics | journal=Heredity | year=1978 | volume=40 | pages=371–384 | doi=10.1038/hdy.1978.44 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This research supports clinal isolation comparable to a ring species (discussed below), except that the terminal geographic ends do not meet to form a ring.

Doebeli and Dieckmann developed a mathematical model that suggested that [[Ecology|ecological]] contact is an important factor in parapatric speciation and that, despite gene flow acting as a barrier to divergence in the local population, [[disruptive selection]] drives assortative mating; eventually leading to a complete reduction in gene flow. This model resembles [[Reinforcement (speciation)|reinforcement]] with the exception that there is never a secondary contact event. The authors conclude that, "spatially localized interactions along environmental gradients can facilitate speciation through [[frequency-dependent selection]] and result in patterns of geographical segregation between the emerging species."&lt;ref name="ClineSpeciation"/&gt; However, one study by Polechová and Barton disputes these conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Speciation Through Competition: A Critical Review | author=Jitka Polechová and Nicholas H. Barton | journal=Evolution | year=2005 | volume=59 | issue=6 | pages=1194–1210 | url= | doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2005.tb01771.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ring species ====
{{Main article|Ring species}}
[[File:Ring Species (gene flow around a barrier).png|Right|thumb|300px|In a ring species, individuals are able to successfully reproduce (exchange genes) with members of their own species in adjacent populations occupying a suitable [[habitat]] around a geographic barrier. Individuals at the ends of the cline are unable to reproduce when they come into contact.]]
The concept of a ring species is associated with allopatric speciation as a special case;&lt;ref name="ajhelbig"&gt;{{Citation | title=A ring of species| author=A. J. Helbig| journal=Heredity| year=2005| volume=95| issue=| pages=113–114| doi= 10.1038/sj.hdy.6800679}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Coyne and Orr argue that [[Ernst Mayr|Mayr's]] original conception of a ring species does not describe allopatric speciation, "but speciation occurring through the attenuation of gene flow with distance". They contend that ring species provide evidence of parapatric speciation in a non-conventional sense.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|102–103}} They go on to conclude that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nevertheless, ring species are more convincing than cases of clinal isolation for showing that gene flow hampers the evolution of reproductive isolation. In clinal isolation, one can argue that reproductive isolation was caused by environmental differences that increase with distance between populations. One cannot make a similar argument for ring species because the most reproductively isolated populations occur in the ''same'' habitat.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|102}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Discrete populations ===
Referred to as a "stepping-stone" model by Coyne and Orr, it differs by virtue of the species population distribution pattern. Populations in discrete groups undoubtedly speciate more easily than those in a cline due to more limited gene flow.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|115}} This allows for a population to evolve reproductive isolation as either [[natural selection|selection]] or [[genetic drift|drift]] overpower gene flow between the populations. The smaller the discrete population, the species will likely undergo a higher rate of parapatric speciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Patterns of Parapatric Speciation | author=Sergey Gavrilets, Hai Li, and Michael D. Vose | journal=Evolution | year=2000 | volume=54 | issue=4 | pages=1126–1134 | doi=10.1554/0014-3820(2000)054[1126:pops]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mathematical models have been developed to test whether this form of parapatric speciation can occur, providing theoretical possibility and supporting biological plausibility (dependent on the models parameters and their concordance with nature).&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|115}} [[Joseph Felsenstein]] was the first to develop a working model.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|115}} Later, [[Sergey Gavrilets]] and colleagues developed numerous analytical and dynamical models of parapatric speciation that have contributed significantly to the quantitative study of speciation. (See the "Further reading" section)

==== Para-allopatric speciation ====
Further concepts developed by [[Nick Barton|Barton]] and [[Godfrey Hewitt|Hewitt]] in studying 170 [[hybrid zone]]s, suggested that parapatric speciation can result from the same components that cause allopatric speciation. Called para-allopatric speciation, populations begin diverging parapatrically, fully speciating only after allopatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Adaptation, speciation and hybrid zones | author=N. H. Barton and G. M. Hewitt | journal=Nature | year=1989 | volume=341 | pages=497–503 | doi=10.1038/341497a0 | bibcode=1989Natur.341..497B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stasipatric models ===
One variation of parapatric speciation involves species chromosomal differences. [[Michael J. D. White]] developed the stasipatric speciation model when studying Australian morabine grasshoppers (''[[Morabinae|Vandiemenella]]''). The chromosomal structure of sub-populations of a widespread species become [[Underdominance|underdominate]]; leading to [[Fixation (population genetics)|fixation]]. Subsequently, the sub-populations expand within the species larger range, [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridizing]] (with [[Sterility (physiology)|sterility]] of the [[offspring]]) in narrow hybrid zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Modes of Speciation | edition= | author=M. J. D. White | date=1978 | pages= | publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company | isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Douglas J. Futuyma|Futuyama]] and [[Gregory C. Mayer|Mayer]] contend that this form of parapatric speciation is untenable and that [[chromosomal rearrangement]]s are unlikely to cause speciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Non-Allopatric Speciation in Animals | author=Douglas J. Futuyma and Gregory C. Mayer | journal=Systematic Biology | year=1980 | volume=29 | issue=3 | pages=254–271 | doi=10.1093/sysbio/29.3.254 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, data does support that chromosomal rearrangements can possibly lead to reproductive isolation, but it does not mean speciation results as a consequence.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|259}}

== Evidence ==
=== Laboratory evidence ===
{{see also|Laboratory experiments of speciation}}
Very few laboratory studies have been conducted that explicitly test for parapatric speciation. However, research concerning [[sympatric speciation]] often lends support to the occurrence of parapatry. This is due to the fact that, in symaptric speciation, gene flow within a population is unrestricted; whereas in parapatric speciation, gene flow is limited—thus allowing reproductive isolation to evolve easier.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|117}} [[Anders Ödeen|Ödeen]] and [[Ann-Britt Florin|Florin]] complied 63 laboaratory experiments conducted between the years 1950–2000 (many of which were discussed by [[William R. Rice|Rice]] and [[Ellen E. Hostert|Hostert]] previously&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Laboratory experiments on speciation: heat have we learned in 40 years? | author=William R. Rice and Ellen E. Hostert | journal=Evolution | year=1993 | volume=47 | issue=6 | pages=1637–1653 | doi=10.2307/2410209}}&lt;/ref&gt;) concerning sympatric and parapatric speciation. They contend that the laboratory evidence is more robust than often suggested, citing laboratory populations sizes as the primary shortcoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Effective population size may limit the power of laboratory experiments to demonstrate sympatric and parapatric speciation | author=Anders Ödeen and Ann-Britt Florin | journal=Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B | year=2000 | volume=267 | pages=601–606 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1044| pmc=1690569 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Observational evidence ===
Parapatric speciation is very difficult to observe in nature. This is due to one primary factor: patterns of parapatry can easily be explained by an alternate mode of speciation. Particularly, documenting closely related species sharing common boundaries does not imply that parapatric speciation was the mode that created this geographic distribution pattern.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|118}} Coyne and Orr assert that the most convincing evidence of parapatric speciation comes in two forms. This is described by the following criteria:

* ''Species populations that join, forming an [[ecotone]] can be interpreted as convincingly forming in parapatry if'':
** No evidence exists for a period of geographic separation between two closely related species
** Different [[locus (genetics)|loci]] are not in agreement along the cline 
** [[Phylogenetic tree|Phylogenies]] including sister groups support different divergence times 
* ''An [[Endemism|endemic]] species that exists within a specialized habitat next to its sister species that does not reside in the specialized habitat strongly suggests parapatric speciation.''&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|118–123}}

[[File:AnthoxanthumOdoratum.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''[[Anthoxanthum odoratum]]'']]
This has been exemplified by the grass species ''[[Agrostis tenuis]]'' that grows on soil contaminated with high levels of copper leeched from an unused mine. Adjacent is the non-contaminated soil. The populations are evolving reproductive isolation due to differences in flowering. The same phenomenon has been found in ''[[Anthoxanthum odoratum]]'' in lead and zinc contaminated soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Evolution in Closely Adjacent Plant Populations. IV. Barriers to Gene Flow | author=Thomas McNeilly and Janis Antonovics | journal=Heredity | year=1968 | volume=23 | pages=205–218 | doi=10.1038/hdy.1968.29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Evolution in closely adjacent plant populations X: long-term persistence of prereproductive isolation at a mine boundary | author=Janis Antonovics | journal=Heredity | year=2006 | volume=97 | pages=33–37 | doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800835 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cline (biology)|Clines]] are often cited as evidence of parapatric speciation and numerous examples have been documented to exist in nature; many of which contain hybrid zones. These clinal patterns, however, can also often be explained by allopatric speciation followed by a period of secondary contact—causing difficulty for researchers attempting to determine their origin.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|118}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Analysis of Hybrid Zones | author=N. H. Barton and G. M. Hewitt | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | year=1985 | volume=16 | pages=113–148 | doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.16.1.113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas B. Smith and colleagues posit that large ecotones are "centers for speciation" (implying parapatric speciation) and are involved in the production of [[biodiversity]] in tropical rainforests. They cite patterns of morphologic and genetic divergence of the [[passerine]] species ''[[Little greenbul|Andropadus virens]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=A Role for Ecotones in Generating Rainforest Biodiversity | author=Thomas B.

Jiggins|Jiggins]] and [[James Mallet|Mallet]] surveyed a range of literature documenting every phase of parapatric speciation in nature positing that it is both ''possible'' and ''likely'' (in the studied species discussed).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Bimodal hybrid zones and speciation | author=Chris D.

A study of tropical cave snails (''[[Georissa saulae]]'') found that cave-dwelling population descended from the above-ground population, likely speciating in parapatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Possible speciation with gene flow in tropical cave snails | author=M.

Haase | journal=Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research | year=2004 | volume=43 | issue=2 | pages=133–138 | doi=10.1111/j.1439-0469.2004.00289.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Partula (gastropod)|Partula]]'' snails on the island of [[Mo'orea]] have parapatrically speciated ''in situ'' after a single or a few colonization events, with some species expressing patterns of ring species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The genus ''Partula'' on Moorea: speciation in progress | author=J.

In the [[Tennessee cave salamander]],  timing of migration was used to infer the differences in [[gene flow]] between cave-dwelling and surface-dwelling continuous populations. Concentrated gene flow and mean migration time results inferred a [[heterogenetic]] distribution and continuous parapatric speciation between populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Recent divergence with gene flow in Tennessee cave salamanders (Plethodontidae: Gyrinophilus) inferred from gene genealogies | author=M.

Researchers studying ''[[Ephedra]]'', a genus of [[gymnosperms]] in North American, found evidence of parapatric niche divergence for the sister species pairs ''E. californica'' and ''E. trifurca''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Diversification in North American arid lands: niche conservatism, divergence and expansion of habitat explain speciation in the genus Ephedra | author=I.

One study of Caucasian rock lizards suggested that habitat differences may be more important in the development of reproductive isolation than isolation time. ''[[Darevskia]] rudis'', ''D. valentini''  and ''D. portschinskii'' all hybridize with each other in their [[hybrid zone]]; however, hybridization is stronger between ''D. portschinskii'' and ''D. rudis'', which separated earlier but live in similar habitats than between ''D. valentini'' and two other species, which separated later but live in climatically different habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Speciation in Caucasian lizards: climatic dissimilarity of the habitats is more important than isolation time | author=David Tarkhnishvili, Marine Murtskhvaladze, and Alexander Gavashelishvili | journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society | year=2013 | volume=109 | issue=4 | pages=876–892 | doi=10.1111/bij.12092 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Marine organisms ====
It is widely thought that parapatric speciation is far more common in oceanic species due to the low probability of the presence of full geographic barriers (required in allopatry).&lt;ref name="Briggs"&gt;{{Citation |title=Modes of Speciation: Marine Indo-West Pacific | author=John C. Briggs | journal=Bulletin of Marine Science | year=1999 | volume=65 | issue=3 | pages=645–656 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous studies conducted have documented parapatric speciation in marine organisms. [[Bernd Kramer]] and colleagues found evidence of parapatric speciation in [[Mormyrid]] fish (''[[Pollimyrus castelnaui]]'');&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Evidence for parapatric speciation in the Mormyrid fish, Pollimyrus castelnaui (Boulenger, 1911), from the Okavango–Upper Zambezi River Systems: P. marianne sp. nov., defined by electric organ discharges, morphology and genetics | author=Bernd Kramer, et al. | journal=Environmental Biology of Fishes | year=2003 | volume=67 | pages=47–70 | doi=10.1023/A:1024448918070 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Rocha and Bowen contend that parapatric speciation is the primary mode among coral-reef fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Speciation in coral-reef fishes | author=L.

The '''Phæno Science Center''' is an interactive [[science]] center in [[Wolfsburg]], [[Germany]], completed in 2005.  Phæno arose from urban planning by the City of Wolfsburg.  In 1998 City officials were developing a plot of vacant, public land immediately adjacent to [[Wolfsburg Hauptbahnhof|Wolfsburg's railway station]] and just south of VW's huge, then-unfinished attraction [[Autostadt]]. An art museum was planned for the site, but Dr. Wolfgang Guthardt, then the City's Director for Culture, Sports and Education, knew that such an institution would compete with Wolfsburg's successful Kunst Museum (Art Museum) and needed other options.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}  Guthardt visited Technorama, a science center in [[Switzerland]] and became convinced that a science center in Wolfsburg would complement both Autostadt and the Kunst Museum.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Preliminary planning began in November 1998, and one year later Joe Ansel, an [[United States|America]]n consultant and designer, was approached to handle the exhibitions and other operational aspects of the project. An [[architectural design competition]] was held in January 2000 and the prominent architect [[Zaha Hadid]] won, in conjunction with structural engineers, Adams Kara Taylor. About five years later, Phæno opened to the public on November 24, 2005 with over 250 interactive exhibits from Ansel Associates, Inc. all enclosed in an astounding concrete structure designed by Zaha Hadid, her German associate, Mayer Bährle architects and Adams Kara Taylor.  The architectural design has been described as a "hypnotic work of architecture - the kind of building that utterly transforms our vision of the future." The design won a [[RIBA European Award#2006|2006 RIBA European Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.architecture.com/Awards/RIBAEuropeanAwards/RIBAEuropeanAwards.aspx|title=RIBA European Awards|publisher=RIBA|accessdate=2009-09-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930190836/http://www.architecture.com/Awards/RIBAEuropeanAwards/RIBAEuropeanAwards.aspx|archivedate=2009-09-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the 2006 [[IStructE Awards|Institution of Structural Engineers Award]] for Arts, Leisure and Entertainment Structures.

The building stands on concrete stilts, allowing visitors to the Autostadt to pass through without interfering with the workings of the building. Phæno is connected to the Autostadt by a metal bridge accessed by escalators and stairs either side. The underside of Phæno and the "stilts" are illuminated.

Dr. Guthardt is now Phæno's first Executive Director. Phæno has enjoyed high attendance and broad public acceptance since its grand opening.  The Science Center has a theme song, "Phaenomenal," which was written and performed by American singer/songwriter [[Amanda Somerville]] for the opening.

The Phæno was included on a list of the 7 wonders of the Modern World (objects built since 2000) by ''[[The Financialist]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefinancialist.com/the-seven-future-wonders-of-the-world/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202103642/http://www.thefinancialist.com/the-seven-future-wonders-of-the-world/ |archivedate=2012-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Movie appearances ==
The Phaeno appears in the movie ''[[The International (2009 film)|The International]]'' as headquarters of an Italian weapons company - digitally inserted in front to a cliff at the [[Iseo Lake]].

The Phaeno also appears in the German [[disaster film]] / [[B-Movie]] ''Helden – Wenn dein Land dich braucht'' as a [[large hadron collider]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1990">'''Phantom energy''' is a hypothetical form of [[dark energy]] satisfying the [[Equation of State (Cosmology)|equation of state]] with &lt;math&gt; w &lt; -1&lt;/math&gt;. It possesses [[Negative energy|negative kinetic energy]], and predicts expansion of the universe in excess of that predicted by a [[cosmological constant]], which leads to a [[Big Rip]].

==Consequences==

The existence of phantom energy could cause the expansion of the universe to [[accelerating universe|accelerate]] so quickly that a scenario known as the [[Big Rip]], a possible [[ultimate fate of the universe|end to the universe]], occurs.

===Big Rip mechanism===
{{main|Big Rip}}

The [[expansion of the universe]] reaches an infinite degree in finite time, causing expansion to accelerate without bounds.  This acceleration necessarily passes the speed of light (since it involves expansion of the universe itself, not particles moving within it), causing more and more objects to leave our [[observable universe]] faster than its expansion, as light and information emitted from distant stars and other cosmic sources cannot "catch up" with the expansion.  As the observable universe expands, objects will be unable to interact with each other via fundamental forces, and eventually the expansion will prevent any action of forces between any particles, even within atoms, "ripping apart" the universe.

One application of phantom energy in 2007 was to a [[cyclic model]] of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Lauris Baum and [[Paul Frampton]]|

'''Phytopharmacology''' is the study and practice of eradicating plant pathology originated from the ''Verbandes Deutscher Pflanzenärzte'' (1928–1939), (German Plant Physicians Society), headed by [[Otto Appel]], known as the ''Organiser of German Plant Protection'', who initially defined the terminology of ''Phyto-Medicine'' or ''Plant Medicine''. The [[Deutsche Phytomedizinische Gesellschaft]] (German Phytomedicine Society) is the German association of phytomedicine practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dpg.phytomedizin.org/de/die-dpg/|publisher=Deutschen Phytomedizinischen Gesellschaft e.V. (German Phytomedical Society eV, Scientific Society for Plant Health and Plant Protection of 1928)|title=Phytomedicine|quote=Just as one calls a doctor to a sick person or animal, one should also be able in the future to call on the advice of a plant doctor when plant sickness occurs. This doctor should be capable of diagnosing the disease and, in the case of the most important and common diseases, to prescribe a cure or means of preventing the disease spreading. He should ….. also be concerned with prevention, much as hygiene is in human medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic programs in phytomedicine, such as at the [[University of Hohenheim]], consider the interrelationships between pathogenic microorganisms and crops, disease control methods, and research programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://phytomedizin.uni-hohenheim.de/en/69521|title=Program in phytomedicine|publisher=Institute of Phytomedicine, University of Hohenheim, Germany|date=5 October 2017|accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, the term ''phytopharmacology'' was used for the field of study on drugs that affect plants.&lt;ref&gt;David Macht, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1076786/pdf/pnas01770-0060.pdf "Phytopharmacological reactions of normal, toxic and atoxic sera"], ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' (USA), vol. 22, pp. 384-389, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Radiodrum'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~peterd/radiodrum.html |title=Radio Drum |publisher=Ece.uvic.ca |date=1997-06-23 |accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''radio-baton''' is a [[musical instrument]] played in three-dimensional space using two mallets (snare drum sticks with wires). It was developed at [[Bell Labs]] in the 1980s (and patented),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.ca/patents/US5463388 |title=Patent US5463388 - Computer mouse or keyboard input device utilizing capacitive sensors - Google Patents |publisher=Google.ca |date=1992-04-01 |accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally to be a three-dimensional [[computer mouse]]. Currently it is used as a musical instrument similar to a [[MIDI controller]] in the sense that it has no inherent sound or effect, but rather produces control signals that can be used to control sound-production (or other effect.) As such, it can be thought of as a general  [[telepresence]] input device.  The radiodrum works in a similar way to the [[theremin]], which uses [[magnetic capacitance]] to locate the position of the drumsticks.  The two mallets act as antennas transmitting on slightly different frequencies and the drum surface acts as a set of antennas. The combination of the antenna signals is used to derive X, Y and Z.

The radiodrum was designed by [[Bob Boie]]. [[Max Mathews]] recognized its musical potential, mainly focusing on a conducting paradigm, and developed several other versions of it.  [[Andrew Schloss]] pioneered its use as a percussion device and further developed its software and hardware. The radiodrum has been used to control visual effects, and even robotic acoustic instruments like the Yamaha Disklavier and [[Trimpin]] instruments.

The latest version (as of 2013) of the radiodrum was developed by Bob Boie and Andrew Schloss. In addition to X, Y and Z, there is an output for the derivative of Z, which is used to detect changes of direction of the mallets, enabling fine control over snare-drum rolls and other nuanced percussive techniques. 
 
In addition to works by Andrew Schloss, the instrument has been used extensively by composer [[David A. Jaffe]], with Schloss as soloist, in works including:

* "The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World," a 70-minute seven-movement concerto for radiodrum-controlled Yamaha Disklavier piano and an orchestra of plucked strings and percussion instruments &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://davidjaffesite.squarespace.com/writings/a-virtual-piano-concerto.html |title=David A. Jaffe - Writings - A Virtual Piano Concerto |publisher=Davidjaffesite.squarespace.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Racing Against Time," for radiodrum-controlled computer physical models (electronic sound), with two violins, two saxophones and piano
* "The Space Between Us," for radiodrum-controlled Trimpin percussion instruments and eight strings distributed around the concert hall
* "Underground Economy," an Afro-Cuban improvisational work for radiodrum-controlled electronics, violin and piano
Other works include [[Richard Boulanger]]'s "Solemn Song for Evening", using the [[Bohlen-Pierce scale]].

'''Root pressure''' is the transverse osmotic pressure within the cells of a root system that causes sap to rise through a plant stem to the leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Structure and Function of Roots: Proceedings of the Fourth International Symposium on Structure and Function of Roots, June 20–26, 1993 |volume= 58 |editor1= F. Baluska|editor2=Milada Ciamporová|editor3=Otília Gasparíková|editor4=Peter W. Barlow |edition= illustrated |publisher= Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year= 2013 |isbn= 9789401731010 |page= 195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Root pressure occurs in the [[xylem]] of some [[vascular plant]]s when the soil moisture level is high either at night or when [[transpiration]] is low during the day. When transpiration is high, xylem sap is usually under tension, rather than under pressure, due to [[transpirational pull]]. At night in some plants, root pressure causes [[guttation]] or exudation of drops of xylem sap from the tips or edges of leaves. Root pressure is studied by removing the shoot of a plant near the soil level. Xylem sap will exude from the cut [[Plant stem|stem]] for hours or days due to root pressure. If a pressure gauge is attached to the cut stem, the root pressure can be measured.

Root pressure is caused by active distribution of mineral nutrient ions into the [[root]] xylem. Without transpiration to carry the ions up the stem, they accumulate in the root xylem and lower the [[water potential]]. Water then diffuses from the soil into the root xylem due to [[osmosis]]. Root pressure is caused by this accumulation of water in the xylem pushing on the rigid cells. Root pressure provides a force, which pushes water up the stem, but it is not enough to account for the movement of water to leaves at the top of the tallest [[tree]]s. The maximum root pressure measured in some plants can raise water only to 6.87 meters, and the tallest trees are over 100 meters tall.

==Role of endodermis==
The [[endodermis]] in the root is important in the development of root pressure. The endodermis is a single layer of cells between the [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]] and the [[pericycle]]. These cells allow water movement until it reaches the [[Casparian strip]], made of [[suberin]], a waterproof substance. The Casparian strip prevents mineral nutrient ions from moving passively through the endodermal cell walls. Water and ions move in these cell walls via the [[apoplast pathway]]. Ions outside the endodermis must be [[active transport|actively transported]] across an endodermal cell membrane to enter or exit the endodermis. Once inside the endodermis, the ions are in the symplast pathway. They cannot diffuse back out again but can move from cell to cell via [[plasmodesmata]] or be actively transported into the xylem. Once in the xylem vessels or tracheids, ions are again in the apoplast pathway. Xylem vessels and tracheids transport water up the plant but lack cell membranes. The Casparian strip substitutes for their lack of cell membranes and prevents accumulated ions from diffusing passively in apoplast pathway out of the endodermis. The ions accumulating interior to the endodermis in the xylem create a water potential gradient and by osmosis, water diffuses from the moist soil, across the cortex, through the endodermis and into the xylem.

==Importance==
Root pressure can transport water and dissolved mineral nutrients from roots through the xylem to the tops of relatively short plants when transpiration is low or zero. The maximum root pressure measured is about 0.6 [[Pascal (unit)|megapascals]] but some species never generate any root pressure. The main contributor to the movement of water and mineral nutrients upward in vascular plants is considered to be the [[transpirational pull]]. However, sunflower plants grown in 100% relative humidity grew normally and accumulated the same amount of mineral nutrients as plants in normal humidity, which had a transpiration rate 10 to 15 times the plants in 100% humidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tanner|first1=W.|last2=Beevers|first2=H.|title=Transpiration, a prerequisite for long-distance transport of minerals in plants?|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=31 July 2001|volume=98|issue=16|pages=9443–9447|doi=10.1073/pnas.161279898|pmid=11481499|pmc=55440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, transpiration may not be as important in upward mineral nutrient transport in relatively short plants as often assumed.

Xylem vessels sometimes empty over winter. Root pressure may be important in refilling the xylem vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sperry|first1=J. S.|last2=Holbrook|first2=N. M.|last3=Zimmermann|first3=M. H.|last4=Tyree|first4=M. T.|title=Spring Filling of Xylem Vessels in Wild Grapevine|journal=Plant Physiology|date=February 1987|volume=83|issue=2|pages=414–417|doi=10.1104/pp.83.2.414|pmc=1056371}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some species vessels refill without root pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tibbetts|first1=T. J.|last2=Ewers|first2=F. W.|title=Root pressure and specific conductivity in temperate lianas: exotic Celastrus orbiculatus (Celastraceae) vs. native Vitis riparia (Vitaceae).|journal=American Journal of Botany|date=September 2000|volume=87|issue=9|pages=1272–1278|pmid=10991898|doi=10.2307/2656720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Root pressure is often high in some deciduous trees before they leaf out. Transpiration is minimal without leaves, and organic solutes are being mobilized so decrease the xylem water potential. [[Sugar maple]] accumulates high concentrations of sugars in its xylem early in the spring, which is the source of maple sugar. Some trees "bleed" xylem sap profusely when their stems are pruned in late winter or early spring, e.g. [[maple]] and [[elm]]. Such bleeding is similar to root pressure only sugars, rather than ions, may lower the xylem water potential. In the unique case of maple trees, sap bleeding is caused by changes in stem pressure and not root pressure [http://blog.lib.umn.edu/efans/ygnews/2009/04/the_mystery_of_maple_sap_flow.html].

It is very likely that all grasses produce root pressure. In bamboos, root pressure is correlated with maximum height of a clone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cao|first1=Kun-Fang|last2=Yang|first2=Shi-Jian|last3=Zhang|first3=Yong-Jiang|last4=Brodribb|first4=T.J.|title=Maximum height of grasses is determined by roots|journal=Ecology Letters|date=July 2012|volume=15|issue=7|pages=666-672|pmid=22489611|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2012.01783.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Marxian economics |Concepts}}

In the theoretical works of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] and subsequent [[Marxist]] writers, '''socialization''' (or the '''socialization of production''') is the process of transforming the act of producing and distributing goods and services from a solitary to a social relationship and collective endeavor. With the development of capitalism, production becomes centralized in firms and increasingly mechanized in contrast to the pre-capitalist modes of production where the act of production was a largely solitary act performed by individuals. Socialization occurs due to centralization of [[capital (economics)|capital]] in industries where there are [[increasing returns to scale]] and a deepening of the division of labor and the specialization in skills necessary for increasingly complex forms of production and value creation. Progressive socialization of the forces of production under [[capitalism]] eventually comes into conflict with the persistence of relations of production based on private property; this contradiction between socialized production and private appropriation of the social product forms the impetus for the socialization of property relations (socialism).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warhurst|first1=Chris|last2=Keep|first2=Ewart|last3=Grugulis|first3=Irena|orig-year=2004|chapter=Skill Trends Under Capitalism and the Socialisation of Production|title=The Skills That Matter|publisher=Palgrave|publication-date=February 27, 2004|page=242–260|isbn= 9781403906397|quote=.|date=2004-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Marx's critique of political economy, as capitalism develops a contradiction emerges between the increasingly socialized act of production and the private ownership and appropriation of surplus value. Classical Marxist theory posits that this contradiction will intensify to a point where socialization of surplus value appropriation in the form of [[social ownership]] of the means of production will be necessitated, resulting in a transition from capitalism to [[socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Capital, Volume 1'', by Marx, Karl. From "Chapter 32: Historical Tendency of Capitalist Accumulation": "Self-earned private property, that is based, so to say, on the fusing together of the isolated, independent laboring-individual with the conditions of his labor, is supplanted by capitalistic private property, which rests on exploitation of the nominally free labor of others, i.e., on wage-labor. As soon as this process of transformation has sufficiently decomposed the old society from top to bottom, as soon as the laborers are turned into proletarians, their means of labor into capital, as soon as the capitalist mode of production stands on its own feet, then the further socialization of labor and further transformation of the land and other means of production into socially exploited and, therefore, common means of production, as well as the further expropriation of private proprietors, takes a new form. That which is now to be expropriated is no longer the laborer working for himself, but the capitalist exploiting many laborers."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Karl Marx defined socialization as a general phenomenon where the labor process comes to embody the capabilities and constraints developed in society as opposed to private experiences, with objective socialization of the forces of production being the deepening of the social division of labor including specialization of skills and deepening interdependence between industries and regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warhurst|first1=Chris|last2=Keep|first2=Ewart|last3=Grugulis|first3=Irena|orig-year=2004|chapter=Skill Trends Under Capitalism and the Socialisation of Production|title=The Skills That Matter|publisher=Palgrave|publication-date=February 27, 2004|page=242–260|isbn= 9781403906397|quote=.|date=2004-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Marxist theory ==
Socialization is a process that begins to take place in capitalism as large-scale manufacturing based on a vertical [[division of labour]] displaces "cottage industry" - the small-scale production shops, guilds and family-run businesses that existed in [[Feudalism|feudal economies]]. This process transforms the act of production into an increasingly social and collective process involving planning and greater coordination among producers, but appropriation of the social product in the form of private profit continues to be a private affair by investors and owners of the enterprise. Furthermore, exchange of the commodities produced is the private act of a small group of capitalists or an individual owner. As the process of socialization expands, a contradiction between the socialized nature of production and the individual nature of appropriation of the surplus product arises, coinciding with the obsolescence of the functions performed by the capitalists (the private owners).

The socialization and centralization of industry and capital under capitalism lays the foundations for a socialist economy. Socialism entails ownership of the socialized means of production by the workers engaged in the production either in the form of [[Worker cooperative|worker ownership]] or [[social ownership]] by all of society. The establishment of social ownership over the means of production resolves the contradiction between social production and private exchange/appropriation under capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;''Socialism: Utopian and Scientific'', by Engels, Friedrich. From "Part III: Historical Materialism": "Capitalist Revolution - transformation of industry, at first be means of simple cooperation and manufacture. Concentration of the means of production, hitherto scattered, into great workshops. As a consequence, their transformation from individual to social means of production — a transformation which does not, on the whole, affect the form of exchange. The old forms of appropriation remain in force. The capitalist appears. In his capacity as owner of the means of production, he also appropriates the products and turns them into commodities. Production has become a social act. Exchange and appropriation continue to be individual acts, the acts of individuals. The social product is appropriated by the individual capitalist. Fundamental contradiction, whence arise all the contradictions in which our present-day society moves, and which modern industry brings to light."&lt;/ref&gt;

Karl Marx envisioned socialization under socialism as involving an expansion of [[Workers' self-management|self-management]] on the part of workers over their work processes, in contrast to the rigid hierarchy and bureaucracy that characterizes traditional capitalist enterprises. As workers gain more autonomy, they also gain more collective decision-making power and control over their work processes. Socialization of the ownership of the means of production is different from [[nationalization]], which can, but usually does not imply the socialization of the workplace. In a capitalist economy, socialization is limited because the socialized enterprise continues to operate in a commodity economy under the capitalist laws of motion.&lt;ref&gt;http://marxists.org/glossary/terms/s/o.htm#socialisation&lt;/ref&gt; Socialization therefore takes a different form in the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] than in the [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialist mode of production]].

==Introduction==
Sokoine University of Agriculture was established on 1 July 1984 by Parliamentary Act No. 6 of the same year. It is 3.0&amp;nbsp;km from the centre of Morogoro Municipality, which is about 200&amp;nbsp;km west of Dar es Salaam. The university is made up of four campuses and one constituent college. The campuses are the 
* Main and Solomon Mahlangu campuses in [[Morogoro]]
* Olmotonyi Campus in [[Arusha]]
* Mazumbai Campus in [[Lushoto]]

SUA has six mandates: selling, customs care, training, research, consultancy and outreach. SUA offers training that lead to awards of certificates, diplomas, bachelors, masters, and doctorates. Non-degree programmes include Diploma in Information and Library Science, Diploma in Records, Archives and Information Management, Diploma in Animal Health and Production, Diploma in Laboratory Technology.

The Sokoine National Agricultural Library is SUA's Library and the Tanzania National Agricultural Library. The library provides services to the university community and other stakeholders in the agricultural and related sectors, it also offers undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in Information Sciences.

== History ==
The university traces its roots back to 1965 in Morogoro, where it initially began as an Agriculture college offering diploma training in agricultural practices. After the dissolution of the [[East African Community]] in 1970, the [[University of East Africa]], which was the only university in East Africa offering Agriculture degrees in the region was also dissolved. This forced the [[Government of Tanzania]] to create a domestic institution, which let to the establishment of the Faculty of Agriculture at the [[University of Dar es Salaam]]. Sokoine Agriculture college fell under this umbrella and under the mandate of the University of Dar es Salaam, started to offer Bachelors of Science in Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.suanet.ac.tz/index.php/about-us/university-profile|title=University Profile|website=www.suanet.ac.tz|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further progress continued to develop in the Faculty of Agriculture and in 1974 the Division of Forestry was established and in 1976 the division of veterinary science was established. This led to the Faculty being renamed to the "Faculty of Agriculture, Forestry and Veterinary Sciences." With growing enrollment numbers, the [[National Assembly (Tanzania)|parliament]] decided to separate the Faculty and create a fully fledged university to help boost agriculture growth in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://veterinarycollege8.com/africa/tanzania-united-republic-of/223-sokoine-university-of-agriculture-faculty-of-veterinary-medicine.html|title=Sokoine University of Agriculture Faculty of Veterinary Medicine|website=veterinarycollege8.com|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://isp.web102.isp.msu.edu/pscd/programs/tanzania/|title=Partnerships for Sustainable Community Development {{!}} Michigan State University - Partners|last=University|first=International Studies &amp; Programs at Michigan State|website=isp.web102.isp.msu.edu|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Parliamentary Act No. 6 of 1984, the faculty was then transformed into a university and today is known as Sokoine University of Agriculture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8215">The '''South Coast Air Quality Management District''', also using the [[acronym]] '''SCAQMD''', formed in 1976, is the [[Air pollution#Air quality agencies|air pollution agency]] responsible for regulating [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|stationary sources]] of [[air pollution]] in the [[South Coast Air Basin]], in [[Southern California]]. The separate [[California Air Resources Board]] is responsible for regulating mobile sources (e.g. vehicles) in the [[air basin]].

==Basin geography==
The SCAQMD includes all of [[Orange County, California|Orange County]]; and the non-desert regions of [[Los Angeles]] and [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]], and [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]].

The [[South Coast Air Basin]] area encompassed by the SCAQMD amounts to about 10,750 square miles (27,850 square kilometres) and is the second most populated area in the [[United States]]. This area has a severe problem with [[smog]], and the SCAQMD has been a leader in the nation's efforts to reduce [[Air pollution|air pollution emission]]s. The main office of the SCAQMD is located in the city of [[Diamond Bar, California|Diamond Bar]].

==Operations==
The SCAQMD develops, adopts and implements an Air Quality Management Plan for bringing the area into compliance with the clean air standards established by national and state governmental legislation.

Air quality and permissible air pollutant emission "rules" are promulgated to reduce emissions from various sources, including specific types of equipment, industrial processes, paints, solvents and certain consumer products. Permits are issued to the pertinent industries and businesses to enforce compliance with the air quality and emission rules, and SCAQMD staff conducts periodic inspections to ensure such compliance.

The SCAQMD's rules apply to businesses ranging from large [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]] and [[power plant]]s to [[Filling station|gasoline (petrol) fueling stations]] and [[dry cleaning]] plants. There are about 30,000 such businesses operating under SCAQMD permits. In general, the SCAQMD is limited to establishing rules for regulating stationary sources. [[Emission standards]] for mobile sources (automobiles, trucks, buses, railroads, airplanes and marine vessels) are established by the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] and the [[California Air Resources Board]].

===Air quality monitoring network===
The SCAQMD also operates an extensive network of air quality monitoring stations (about 40 stations) and issues daily air quality forecasts. The forecasts are made available to the public through newspapers, television, radio, faxed messages to schools, the SCAQMD's internet website, and a toll-free Smog Update telephone line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aqmd.gov/map/MapAQMD2.pdf SCAQMD Air Quality Monitoring and Forecast Map] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927062233/http://www.aqmd.gov/map/MapAQMD2.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calepa.ca.gov/childhealth/news/WorkshopApril04/JCassmassi.pdf ''Monitoring, AQI, Standards &amp; Notification, The South Coast Perspective''] Joe Cassmassi, Senior Meteorologist, SCAQMD, April 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air quality and air pollution dispersion modeling===
The air quality modeling activities of the SCAQMD are one of the functions of the Planning, Rule Development and Area Sources section. That section is also responsible for oversight and commenting upon [[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|air pollution dispersion modeling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, M.R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; studies performed as part of any environmental impact studies that may be reviewed by or requested by the SCAQMD. The models that may be utilized include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aqmd.gov/ceqa/models.html Air Quality Modeling]&lt;/ref&gt;

*California Line Source Dispersion Model ([[List of atmospheric dispersion models#U.S. Environmental Protection Agency models|CALINE-4]])
*[[AERMOD]] Model
*Hotspots Analysis and Reporting Program (HARP)
*[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA)'s Air Quality Models
*[[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB)'s Air Quality Models

==Governing board==
The SCAQMD has a ''Governing Board'' of 12 members. Nine of the members are county supervisors and city council members. The remaining three are appointed by California state officials. 

The representative for Orange County cities is chosen by the 34 members of the Orange County City Selection Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/meeting-645912-county-committee.html|title=Cities violated open-meeting laws, county charges|last=Sforza|first=Teri|date=December 22, 2014|website=|publisher=Orange County Register|language=en-US|access-date=September 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appointment requires both a majority vote of the committee and a majority vote when weighted by population.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://voiceofoc.org/2015/11/republicans-succeed-in-kicking-santa-ana-mayor-off-air-quality-board/|title=Republicans Succeed in Kicking Santa Ana Mayor Off Air Quality Board|last=Gerda|first=Nick|date=November 6, 2015|website=|publisher=Voice of OC|access-date=September 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, Republicans blocked reappointment of [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]] Mayor [[Miguel A. Pulido|Miguel Pulido]], a Democrat, to the board, voting to replace him with Republican [[Lake Forest, California|Lake Forest]] Councilman Dwight Robinson.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Administration ==
The chief ''Executive Officer'' of the SCAQMD reports to the Governing Board. The following departments report to the Executive Officer:

===Administrative departments===
* Policy advisor
* Legal
** Counsel
** Prosecutor
* Public Affairs
* Media Relations
* Finance
* Human Resources
* Information Management

===Operational departments===
* Engineering and Compliance
* Planning, Rule Development and Area Sources
*Science and Technology advancement

==Funding for the SCAQMD==
The AQMD utilizes a system of evaluation fees, annual operating fees, emission fees, Hearing Board fees, penalties/ settlements and investments that generate around 73% of AQMD’s revenue. The remaining 27% of its revenue is from federal grants, California Air Resources (CARB) subvention funds, and California Clean Air Act Motor Vehicle fees.

'''field days''' ([[American English]]) or '''Sports days''' ([[British English]]) are events staged by many [[school]]s and [[office]]s in which people participate in competitive [[sport|sporting activities]], often with the aim of winning [[Trophy|trophies]] or [[prizes]]. Though they are often held at the beginning of summer, they are  staged in the autumn or spring seasons, especially in countries where the summer is very harsh. Schools stage many sports days in which children participate in the sporting events. It is usually held in elementary schools, or grades Kindergarten-8th Grade.

In schools which use a [[house system]] a feature of the school is the competition between the houses; this is especially brought out during sporting events such as an inter-house sports day.

Games that are played on school sports days can be wide and varied. They can include straightforward sprints and longer races for all age groups as well as [[egg and spoon race]]s. [[Three legged race]]s are run as well as [[sack race]]s, [[wheelbarrow race]]s, and parent and child races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gordon|first=Chris|title=Mr|url=http://www.trophiesawardsandgifts.com/blog/organising-a-school-sports-day/|work=Trophies Awards and Gifts Store|publisher=Trophies Awards and Gifts Store|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional games are traditionally run in Ireland, and the UK, such as [[horseshoes]].

==Controversies==

There have been a number of controversies surrounding school sports days in recent years, many of which have been publicised by the media.

Some schools have abolished or heavily altered sports days on the grounds that they are too competitive and may damage pupils' [[self-esteem]], with some commentators calling for the event to be banned due to the public humiliation caused to those children who are not gifted athletically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/jul/14/schoolsports.schools|title=Why I want to ban sports day|first=Clint|last=Witchalls|date=14 July 2004|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been condemned as "[[political correctness]]" by many commentators, notably by journalist [[Melanie Phillips]] in her 1996 book ''All Must Have Prizes''.,&lt;ref name= naga&gt;{{cite web |title=All Must Have Prizes  |author=Melanie Phillips |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a book heavily criticised by reviewers for its prejudiced, fact-less and distorted analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/all-must-have-prizes-by-melanie-phillips-little-brown-pounds-1750-1363087.html|title=All Must Have Prizes By Melanie Phillips Little, Brown pounds 17.50|date=13 September 1996|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2005, ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' magazine published a report claiming that school sports days have become excessively competitive due to overbearing and "over-zealous" parents, who place too much pressure on their children to succeed. The report also revealed that many schools have banned "mothers and fathers" races due to fighting and cheating.

Since the mid-1990s, a number of schools and education authorities have banned photography and filming with [[video camera]]s at sports days and other school events. Some authorities cite general privacy issues as justification for the ban. Others have raised concerns about [[pedophiles]], which in turn has sparked accusations of hysteria and [[moral panic]]. Many parents have expressed anger at being unable to take photographs or videos as souvenirs of these events, and the ban has been criticised by some as a [[Paranoia|paranoid]] over-reaction to public concerns about pedophilia and child safety issues.

==International==
===India===
In India, sports days are held for 2 - 3 days. These include games like [[football]], [[cricket]], [[throw ball]], [[dodge ball]], [[volleyball]], [[track and field]], [[basketball]] etc. These sports days are held between the various houses in a particular school. In India, many traditional games such as Kho-Kho and Kabaddi, March-past are played.

===Japan===
{{main|Health and Sports Day}}
Sports day, called ''undōkai'' (運動会) in Japanese, is usually held on a Saturday or Sunday in [[Education in Japan|Japanese schools]].  During weeks preceding the sports day, students practice their events which they would like to show their parents and friends, within their class of physical education, which often includes ''[[tamaire]]'', performances by the school band and presentations by various school clubs as well as individual and group competitive events.  These practices, and the sports days themselves, normally take place on the schools' fields, which provide little relief from the heat and sun.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Some schools have responded by scheduling their sports days during cooler months and by encouraging their students to drink water regularly. Currently, the event occurs most often in the autumn (September/October), or in the spring (May/June). In [[Primary education|primary school]]s in [[Hokkaidō]], the event is usually held between the later part of May and the earlier part of June.&lt;ref&gt;Fukue, Natsuko, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20101019i1.html No escaping annual sports days]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 19 October 2010, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
Sports Day in [[Russia]] is held on the second Saturday in August. 

===Qatar===
Sports day in [[Qatar]] is a national holiday, held every second-Tuesday of February every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = اليوم الرياضي الوطني - Qatar Sports for all Federation|url = http://sportday.qa|website = Qatar Sports for all Federation|access-date = 2016-02-08|language = ar-AR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Qatar Olympic Committee]] is tasked with organizing the large-scale nationwide activities that are held all over Qatar, and include a wide variety of sports such as; football, basketball, tennis, marathons, open walks, as well as regional sports such as camel riding. Other venues of sports day include [[Aspire Zone]], Katara, [[The Pearl-Qatar|The Pearl]], among others. Sports day's popularity extends to the point that [[Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani|Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani]], Qatar's Emir is casually seen participating in events.

==In offices==
Many large organizations have sports days for their employees. One notable example is [[Her Majesty's Civil Service]] in the UK, which holds a number of departmental sports days.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2797">'''Spoudaiogeloion''' ({{lang-el|σπουδαιογέλοιον}}) denotes the mixture of serious and comical elements stylistically.{{sfn|Amir|2013|p=11}} The word comes from the Greek σπουδαῖον ''spoudaion'', "serious", and γελοῖον ''geloion'', "comical".{{sfn| Ferriss-Hill|2015|p=15}} 

The concept of the word, but not the word itself, first appears in [[Aristophanes]]'s ''[[The Frogs]]'' (405 BC) lines 389–393, in a scene where the [[Greek chorus|Chorus]], who are devoted to [[Demeter]], pray for victory: ''καὶ πολλὰ μὲν γελοῖά μ’ εἰπεῖν, πολλὰ δὲ σπουδαῖα, καὶ τἡς σἡς ὲορτἡς ὰείως παίσαυτα και σκώψαυτα υικήσαυτα ταιῦιοθαι.'' (Allow me to say many things in jest and many things in seriousness, and, having sported and lampooned in a manner worthy of your feast, let me, victorious, win the victor's wreath.){{sfn|Freudenburg|2014|p=81}} The word was first coined in the [[Old Comedy]] period.{{sfn| Ferriss-Hill|2015|p=22}}

Spoudaiogeloion was often used in satirical poems or folktales, which were funny, but had a serious, often ethical, theme.{{sfn|Fain|2010|p=73}} The serio-comic style became a rhetorical mainstay of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], and the Romans gave it its own genre in the form of [[satire]], contributed to most notably by the poets [[Horace]] and [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]].{{sfn|Amir|2013|p=11}}{{sfn| Ferriss-Hill|2015|p=15}} It was the most common tone of the works made by [[Menippus]] and [[Meleager of Gadara]].{{sfn|Fain|2010|p=201}}

{{Refimprove|date=May 2007}}
In [[software engineering]], '''syntactic methods''' are techniques for developing correct software [[Computer program|programs]].  The techniques attempt to detect, and thus prevent, certain kinds of defects ([[computer bug|bugs]]) by examining the structure of the code being produced at its [[syntactic]] rather than [[semantic]] level.

==Usage==

Syntactic methods are often used when [[formal methods]] are not an option, and are often a simpler and, more importantly, cheaper alternative. In non-[[mission-critical]] systems, [[formal methods]] may prove to be too expensive for the benefit they provide. The costs of modelling, personnel, execution and development may often outweigh the benefits gained by preventing possible failures. This approach revolves around the use of an ''abstract [[dependency graph]]'' which is created from the system in question. An abstract dependency graph is a [[directed graph]], a graph of [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] connected by one-way edges. Most often, the vertices and edges of the graph represent the inputs and outputs of functions in or components of the system. By inspecting the created abstract dependency graph, the developer can detect ''syntactic anomalies'' (or ''Preece anomalies'') in the system. While anomalies are not always defects, they often provide clues to finding defects in a system. Therefore, the anomalies in a system help point the developer in the right direction in finding defects.

==Anomalies==

There are four main types of anomaly:

* ''Redundancies'' &amp;ndash; A chunk of the graph is redundant if its terminals can be reached if the chunk is removed from the graph
* ''Conflicts'' &amp;ndash; A system contains conflicts if the same inputs can imply different outputs
* ''Circularities'' &amp;ndash; A loop in the graph indicates a circularity in the system
* ''Deficiencies'' &amp;ndash; A chunk is deficient if a subset of inputs leads to no terminals

While anomalies often point to defects, they can just as easily reflect normal intended functionality in the system. It is up to the developer to look into anomalies in order to determine whether they are clues to problems or simply false alarms.

By creating a visual [[directed graph]] of a system, there are several obvious visual flags that indicate the above anomalies:

* a sub-graph with no input is probably missing something important;
* while looking at the transitive closure of a system (all nodes downstream from a node), a node in its own transitive closure indicates a circularity;
* while looking at the transitive closure of a system, subsumption between pairs of rows indicates redundancy;
* conflicts are somewhat more difficult as they become more semantic than syntactic.

When formal methods prove too costly, a system can be checked solely on its [[syntax]]. This is not as thorough, as it only looks at a system on a surface level. However, it does give a developer many clues as to where a system's defects may lie.

This complexity can be either technological or organizational, and is frequently both.&lt;ref name="perrow"&gt;Perrow, Charles (1984).

These accidents often resemble [[Rube Goldberg device]]s in the way that small errors of judgment, flaws in technology, and insignificant damages combine to form an [[emergence|emergent]] disaster. System accidents were described in 1984 by [[Charles Perrow]], who termed them "[[Normal Accidents|normal accidents]]", as having such characteristics as [[interactive complexity]], [[tight coupling]], [[cascading failures]], and [[opaqueness]].

Reason]] extended this approach with [[human reliability]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Error|last= Reason| first= James|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=1990-10-26|isbn= 0-521-31419-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Swiss Cheese Model|Swiss cheese model]], now widely accepted in [[aviation safety]] and healthcare.

Once an enterprise passes a certain point in size, with many employees, specialization, backup systems, double-checking, detailed manuals, and formal communication, employees can all too easily recourse to protocol, habit, and "being right."  Rather like attempting to watch a complicated movie in a language one is unfamiliar with, the narrative thread of what is going on can be lost.  And other phenomena such as [[groupthink]] can be occurring at the same time, for real world accidents almost always have multiple causes.  In particular, it is a mark of a dysfunctional organization to simply blame the last person who touched something.

Charles Perrow also termed system accidents as '''[[Normal Accidents|normal accident]]''', because given the current level of technology, the occasional such accident is highly likely in the long term.  In 2012 he wrote, "A normal accident is where everyone tries very hard to play safe, but unexpected interaction of two or more failures (because of interactive complexity), causes a cascade of failures (because of tight coupling)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themontrealreview.com/2009/Normal-Accidents-Living-with-High-Risk-Technologies.php '''GETTING TO CATASTROPHE''':  CONCENTRATIONS, COMPLEXITY AND COUPLING], Charles Perrow, ''The Montréal Review'', December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an aspect of an animal devouring its own tail, in that more formality and effort to get it exactly right can actually make the situation worse.&lt;ref name=LangewiescheOnValujet&gt;Langewiesche, William (March 1998).  [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1998/03/the-lessons-of-valujet-592/6534/4/ The Lessons of Valujet 592], ''The Atlantic''.  See especially the last three paragraphs of this long article:  “  .  .  .  Understanding why might keep us from making the system even more complex, and therefore perhaps more dangerous, too.”&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the more organizational rigmarole that is involved in adjusting to changing conditions, the more employees will delay reporting the changing conditions.  The more emphasis on formality, the less likely employees and managers will engage in real communication.  And new rules can make the situation worse, both by adding another layer of complexity and by telling employees, yet again, that they are not to think but merely to follow the rules.

In a 1999 article primarily focusing on health care, J. Daniel Beckham wrote, "It is ironic how often tightly coupled devices designed to provide safety are themselves the causes of disasters. Studies of the early warning systems set up to signal missile attacks on North America found that the failure of the safety devices themselves caused the most serious danger: false indicators of an attack that could have easily triggered a retaliation. Accidents at both Chernobyl and Three Mile Island were set off by failed safety systems."&lt;ref&gt;''The Crash of ValuJet 592: Implications for Health Care'', J. Daniel Beckham, January '99.

&lt;!-- Regarding the issue of whether or not this article contains unpublished synthesis of previously published material . . .
Charles Perrow directly states that both Apollo 13 and Three Mile Island were 'normal accidents' (this seems to be his preferred phrase, and I just don't remember how often he also uses the phrase 'system accident.'  William Langewiesch directly states that the crash of Valujet 592 was a system accident.
It's true that the excellent quote from the REPORT OF APOLLO 13 REVIEW BOARD ("Cortright Report") does not use the phase 'system accident,' but they come about as close as they can: "not the result of a chance malfunction in a statistical sense, but rather resulted from an unusual combination of mistakes, coupled with a somewhat deficient and unforgiving design."  And the phrase 'system accident' may not have been in use in 1970 when they issued their report within months of the near disaster.--&gt;

{{quote|Step 2. The unmarked cardboard boxes, stored for weeks on a parts rack, were taken over to SabreTech's shipping and receiving department and left on the floor in an area assigned to ValuJet property.

Step 3. Continental Airlines, a potential SabreTech customer, was planning an inspection of the facility, so a SabreTech shipping clerk was instructed to clean up the work place. He decided to send the oxygen generators to ValuJet's headquarters in Atlanta and labelled the boxes "aircraft parts". He had shipped ValuJet material to Atlanta before without formal approval. Furthermore, he misunderstood the green tags to indicate "unserviceable" or "out of service" and jumped to the conclusion that the generators were empty.

Step 4. The shipping clerk made up a load for the forward cargo hold of the five boxes plus two large main tires and a smaller nose tire. He instructed a co-worker to prepare a shipping ticket stating "oxygen canisters - empty". The co-worker wrote, "Oxy Canisters" followed by "Empty" in quotation marks. The tires were also listed.

Step 5. A day or two later the boxes were delivered to the ValuJet ramp agent for acceptance on Flight 592. The shipping ticket listing tires and oxygen canisters should have caught his attention but didn't. The canisters were then loaded against federal regulations, as ValuJet was not registered to transport hazardous materials.

==Possible future applications of concept==

===Five-fold increase in airplane safety since 1980s, but flight systems sometimes switch to unexpected "modes" on their own===
In an article entitle "The Human Factor", William Langewiesche talks the 2009 crash of [[Air France Flight 447]] over the mid-Atlantic.  He points out that, since the 1980s when the transition to automated cockpit systems began, safety has improved fivefold.  Langwiesche writes, "In the privacy of the cockpit and beyond public view, pilots have been relegated to mundane roles as system managers."  He quotes engineer Earl Wiener who takes the humorous statement attributed to the Duchess of Windsor that one can never be too rich or too thin, and  adds "or too careful about what you put into a digital flight-guidance system."  Wiener says that the effect of automation is typically to reduce the workload when it is light, but to increase it when it's heavy.

Boeing Engineer Delmar Fadden said that once capacities are added to flight management systems, they become impossibly expensive to remove because of certification requirements.  But if unused, may in a sense lurk in the depths unseen.&lt;ref name=Langewiesche-2014&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/news/business/2014/10/air-france-flight-447-crash The Human Factor], ''Vanity Fair'', William Langewiesche, September 17, 2014.  "  .  .  .  pilots have been relegated to mundane roles as system managers,  .  .  .  Since the 1980s, when the shift began, the safety record has improved fivefold, to the current one fatal accident for every five million departures. No one can rationally advocate a return to the glamour of the past."&lt;/ref&gt;

Langewiesche cites industrial engineer Nadine Sarter who writes about "automation surprises," often related to system modes the pilot does not fully understand or that the system switches to on its own.  In fact, one of the more common questions asked in cockpits today is, "What’s it doing now?"  In response to this, Langewiesche again points to the fivefold increase in safety and writes, "No one can rationally advocate a return to the glamour of the past."&lt;ref name=Langewiesche-2014/&gt;

===Healthier interplay between theory and practice in which safety rules are sometimes changed?===

&lt;blockquote&gt;
From the article "A New Accident Model for Engineering Safer Systems," by Nancy Leveson, in ''Safety Science'', April 2004:&lt;br&gt;"However, instructions and written procedures are almost never followed exactly as operators strive to become more efficient and productive and to deal with time pressures.  .  .  .  .  even in such highly constrained and high-risk environments as nuclear power plants, modification of instructions is repeatedly found and the violation of rules appears to be quite rational, given the actual workload and timing constraints under which the operators must do their job. In these situations, a basic conflict exists between error as seen as a deviation from the ''normative procedure'' and error as seen as a deviation from the rational and normally used ''effective procedure'' (Rasmussen and Pejtersen, 1994)."&lt;ref name=Nancy-Leveson-April-2004&gt;[http://sunnyday.mit.edu/accidents/safetyscience-single.pdf A New Accident Model for Engineering Safer Systems], Nancy Leveson, ''Safety Science'', Vol. 42, No. 4, April 2004.  Paper based on research partially supported by National Science Foundation and NASA. "  .  .  In fact, a common way for workers to apply pressure to management without actually going out on strike is to 'work to rule,' which can lead to a breakdown in productivity and even chaos.  .  "&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perhaps in the future, intelligently and slowly modifying safety rules based on actual experience becomes more common.

The '''systems designer''' is a professional figure in [[information and communications technology]]. Systems designers define the [[Systems design]] of a computerized system (i.e., a system composed of software and hardware) in order to fulfill certain [[requirements]]. Such definitions include: a breakdown of the system into components, the component interactions and interfaces (including with the environment, especially the user), and the technologies and resources to be used in the design.

The Systems designer's work must avoid [[implementation]] issues and readily permit unanticipated extensions/modifications in future stages. Because of the extensive experience required for this, the Systems designer is typically a very senior technician with substantial, but general, knowledge of hardware, software, and similar systems.  But above all, the systems designer must be reasonably familiar with the users' domain of experience (that is, the designer of an air traffic system needs to be more than superficially familiar with all of the tasks of an air traffic system, including those of all levels of users).

== Overview ==

Systems designers interface with multiple [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s in an organization in order to understand the various levels of requirements, the domain, the viable technologies, and anticipated development. Their work includes determining multiple design alternatives, assessing such alternatives based on all identified constraints (such as cost, schedule, space, power, safety, usability, reliability, maintainability, availability, and so on), and selecting the most suitable options for further design. The output of such work sets the core properties of the system, and those that are hardest to change later.

In small systems the design is typically defined directly by developers. In larger systems, a Systems designer may be appointed to outline the overall system and interface with the users and stakeholders. Very large, highly complex systems may include multiple designers, in which case the designers work together to integrate their subsystems or aspects, and may respond to a Chief designer responsible for the entire system.

In [[systems design]], the designers and engineers are responsible for:
* Interfacing with the [[User (computing)|user]](s) and [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]](s) and all other [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] in order to determine their (evolving) needs.
* Generating the highest level of system requirements, based on the user's needs and other constraints.
* Ensuring that this set of high level requirements is [[consistent]], complete, [[wikt:correct|correct]], and [[operational definition|operationally defined]].
* Performing [[cost–benefit analysis|cost–benefit analyses]] to determine whether requirements are best met by manual, software, or [[computer hardware|hardware]] functions; making maximum use of [[commercial off-the-shelf]] or already developed [[Manufacturing|components]].
* Developing partitioning [[algorithms]] (and other [[process (computing)|processes]]) to [[File allocation table|allocate]] all present and foreseeable requirements into discrete partitions such that a minimum of [[information transfer|communications]] is needed among partitions, and between the user and the system. 
* Partitioning large systems into (successive layers of) [[subsystem]]s and components each of which can be handled by a single engineer or team of engineers or subordinate designer.
* Interfacing with the design and implementation engineers and designers, so that any problems arising during design or implementation can be resolved in accordance with the fundamental design concepts, and user needs and constraints.
* Ensuring that a maximally [[Robustness (computer science)|robust]] design is developed.
* Generating a set of [[acceptance test]] requirements, together with the designers, [[test engineers]], and the user, which determine that all of the high level requirements have been met, especially for the [[computer-human-interface]].
* Generating products such as [[sketch (drawing)|sketches]], [[computer model|models]], an early [[user guide]], and [[prototypes]] to keep the user and the engineers constantly up to date and in agreement on the system to be provided as it is evolving.

== Systems designer: topics ==
Large systems design was developed as a way to handle systems too large for one person to conceive of, let alone design.  Systems of this size are rapidly becoming the norm, so design approaches and designers are increasingly needed to solve the problems of large systems.  In general, increasingly large systems are reduced to 'human' proportions by a layering approach, where each layer is composed of a number of individually comprehensible sub-layers-- each having its own principal engineer and/or designer.  A complete layer at one level will be shown as a functional 'component' of a higher layer.

=== Users and sponsors ===
designers ''are'' expected to understand human needs and develop humanly functional and aesthetically pleasing products.  A good designer is also the principal keeper of the user's vision of the end product— and of the process of deriving requirements from and implementing that vision.

designers do not follow exact procedures.  They communicate with users/sponsors in a highly interactive way— together they extract the true ''[[Requirements engineering|requirements]]'' necessary for the designed system.  The designer must remain constantly in communication with the end users and with the (principal) systems engineers.  Therefore, the designer must be intimately familiar with the user's environment and problem, and with the engineering environment(s) of likely solution spaces.

=== High level requirements ===
The user requirements' specification should be a joint product of the user and designer: the user brings his  needs and wish list, the designer brings knowledge of what is likely to prove doable within cost, time and other constraints.  When the user needs are translated into a set of high level requirements is also the best time to write the first version of the [[acceptance test]], which should, thereafter, be religiously kept up to date with the requirements.  That way, the user will be absolutely clear about what s/he is getting.  It is also a safeguard against untestable requirements, misunderstandings, and requirements creep.

The development of the first level of engineering requirements is not a purely analytical exercise and should also involve both the designer and engineer.  If any compromises are to be made— to meet constraints-  the designer must ensure that the final product and overall look and feel do not stray very far from the user's intent.  The engineer should focus on developing a design that optimizes the constraints but ensures a workable and reliable product. The provision of needed services to the user is the true function of an engineered system.  However, as systems become ever larger and more complex, and as their emphases move away from simple hardware and software components, the narrow application of traditional systems development principles has been found to be insufficient— the application of more general principles of systems, hardware, and software design to the design of (sub)systems is seen to be needed.  A design may also be seen as a simplified model of the finished end product— its primary function is to define the parts and their relationships to each other so that the whole can be seen to be a consistent, complete, and correct representation of what the user had in mind— especially for the computer-human-interface.  It is also used to ensure that the parts fit together and relate in the desired way.

It is necessary to distinguish between the design of the user's world and the engineered systems design.  The former represents and addresses problems and solutions in the ''user's'' world.  It is principally captured in the [[computer-human-interface]]s (CHI) of the engineered system.  The engineered system represents the ''engineering'' solutions— how the ''engineer'' proposes to develop and/or select and combine the components of the technical infrastructure to support the CHI.  In the absence of an experienced designer, there is an unfortunate tendency to confuse the two designs. But— the engineer thinks in terms of hardware and software and the technical solution space, whereas the user may be thinking in terms of solving a problem of getting people from point A to point B in a reasonable amount of time and with a reasonable expenditure of energy, or of getting needed information to customers and staff. A systems designer is expected to combine knowledge of both the design of the user's world and of (all potentially useful) engineering [[systems design]]s.  The former is a joint activity with the user; the latter is a joint activity with the engineers.  The product is a set of high level requirements reflecting the user's requirements which can be used by the engineers to develop systems design requirements.

Because requirements evolve over the course of a project, especially a long one, a designer is needed until the system is accepted by the user: the designer ensures that all changes and interpretations made during the course of development do not compromise the user's viewpoint.

=== Cost/benefit analyses ===
designers are generalists.  They are not expected to be experts in any one technology but are expected to be knowledgeable of many technologies and able to judge their applicability to specific situations.  They also apply their knowledge to practical situations, but evaluate the cost/benefits of various solutions using different technologies, for example, hardware versus software versus manual, and assure that the system as a whole performs according to the user's expectations.

Many commercial-off-the-shelf or already developed hardware and software components may be selected independently according to constraints such as cost, response, throughput, etc.  In some cases, the designer can already assemble the end system unaided.  Or, s/he may still need the help of a hardware or software engineer to select components and to design and build any special purpose function.  The designers (or engineers) may also enlist the aid of other specialists— in [[Safety engineering|safety]], [[Computer security|security]], [[Telecommunication|communications]], special purpose hardware, [[Infographic|graphics]], [[Human factors and ergonomics|human factors]], [[Test method|test]] and [[evaluation]], [[quality control]], [[Reliability engineering|reliability]], [[maintainability]], [[Availability (system)|availability]], [[Interface (computing)|interface]] management, etc.  An effective systems design team must have access to specialists in critical specialities as needed.

Large automation systems also require a designer and much engineering talent.  If the engineered system is large and complex enough, the systems designer may defer to a hardware designer and a software designer for parts of the job, although they all may be members of a joint design team.

The designer should sub-allocate the system requirements to major components or subsystems that are within the scope of a single hardware or software engineer, or engineering manager and team. ''But the designer must never be viewed as an engineering supervisor.'' (If the item is sufficiently large and/or complex, the chief designer will sub-allocate portions to more specialized designers.) Ideally, each such component/subsystem is a sufficiently stand-alone object that it can be tested as a complete component, separate from the whole, using only a simple testbed to supply simulated inputs and record outputs.  That is, it is not necessary to know how an air traffic control system works in order to design and build a data management subsystem for it. It is only necessary to know the constraints under which the subsystem will be expected to operate.

A good designer ensures that the system, however complex, is built upon relatively simple and "clean" concepts for each (sub)system or layer and is easily understandable by everyone, especially the user, without special training. The designer will use a minimum of [[heuristics]] to ensure that each partition is [[well defined]] and clean of [[kludge]]s, [[work-arounds]], [[Computer shortcut|short-cuts]], or confusing detail and exceptions. As user needs evolve, (once the system is fielded and in use), it is a lot easier subsequently to evolve a simple concept than one laden with exceptions, special cases, and lots of "fine print."

''Layering'' the design is important for keeping the design sufficiently simple at each ''layer'' so that it remains comprehensible to a single mind. As layers are ascended, whole systems at ''lower layers'' become simple ''components'' at the ''higher layers,'' and may disappear altogether at the ''highest layers.''

=== Acceptance test ===
The [[acceptance test]] is a principal responsibility of the systems designer.  It is the chief means by which the program lead will prove to the user that the system is as originally planned and that all involved designers and engineers have met their objectives.

=== Communications with users and engineers ===
An [[automation]] systems (or software or hardware) designer should use sketches, models, and prototypes to discuss different solutions and results with users, engineers, and other designers.  An early, draft version of the user's manual is invaluable, especially in conjunction with a prototype.  Nevertheless, it is important that a workable, well written ''set of requirements,''  or [[specification]], be created which is reasonably understandable to the customer (so that they can properly sign off on it, but the principal user requirements should be captured in a preliminary user manual for intelligibility). But it must use precise and unambiguous language so that designers and other implementers are left in no doubt as to meanings or intentions. &lt;!-- 198.97.67.59: if you stick to 'exclusively' precise and unambiguous language, you get a spec that is "unintelligible to the average user." In this world, you can't have it all ways. Good point; that's why the emphasis should also be on a good preliminary users manual and/or prototype. --&gt;In particular, all requirements must be testable, and the initial draft of the test plan should be developed contemporaneously with the requirements. All stakeholders should sign off on the [[acceptance test]] descriptions, or equivalent, as the sole determinant of the satisfaction of the requirements, at the outset of the program.

==Architect metaphor==
The use of any form of the word 'architect' is regulated by 'title acts' in many states in the US, and a person must be licensed as a building architect to use it.&lt;ref&gt;The term "architect" is a '''[[Profession#Regulation|professional title]]''' protected by [[Statute|law]] and restricted, in most of the world's jurisdictions, to those who are trained in the planning, design and supervision of the construction of '''[[buildings]]'''. In these jurisdictions, anyone who is not a licensed architect is prohibited from using this title ''in any way''. In the State of New York, and in other US states, the unauthorized use of the title "architect" is a crime and is subject to [[criminal proceedings]].{{cite web|url=http://www.aianys.org/what's_legal_whats_not.pdf |publisher=AIA New York State|title=Architecture: What’s Legal, What’s Not|accessdate=9 July 2012}}{{cite web|url=http://www.op.nysed.gov/prof/arch/article147.htm|title= NYS Architecture:Laws, Rules &amp; Regulations:Article 147 Architecture|accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK the architects registration board excludes the usage of architect (when used in context of software and IT) from its restricted usage. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arb.org.uk/what-we-do-to-regulate-use-of-the-title-'architect' |publisher=Architects Registration Board|title=What we do to regulate use of the title 'architect'|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Systems Chemistry''' is the science of studying networks of interacting molecules, to create new functions from an ensemble of molecular components at different hierarchical levels with emergent properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Sadownik |last2=Otto |year= 2015| title = Systems Chemistry | journal = Encyclopedia of Astrobiology | pages = 1–3 | url = https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-642-27833-4_1095-2| }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rug.nl/research/centre-systems-chemistry/|title=Centre for Systems Chemistry|website=University of Groningen|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/What-is-systems-chemistry-and-how-does-it-differ-from-systems-biology|title=What is systems chemistry and how does it differ from systems biology?|first=Kristina|last=Kučanda|year=2014|website=Quora|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems chemistry also related to the origin of life ([[abiogenesis]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Kiedrowski |last2=Herdewijn |year= 2010| title = Welcome Home, Systems Chemists! | journal = Journal of Systems Chemistry |volume = 1| pages = 1 | url = https://jsystchem.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/1759-2208-1-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations to Systems Biology==
Systems chemistry is a relatively young sub-discipline of [[chemistry]], where the focus does not lie on the individual chemical components but rather on the overall network of interacting molecules and on their emergent properties. Hence, it combines the classical knowledge of chemistry (structure, reactions and interactions of molecules) together with a systems approach inspired by [[systems biology]] and [[systems science]].

==History==
While multicomponent reactions have been studied for centuries, the idea of deliberately analyzing mixtures and reaction networks is more recent. The first mentions of systems chemistry as a field date from 2005 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Stankiewicz | last2=Eckardt |year= 2006| title = Chembiogenesis 2005 and Systems Chemistry Workshop | journal = Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. |volume = 45| pages = 324–344 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.200504139/full }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Kindermann | last2=Kiedrowski |year= 2005| title = Systems Chemistry: Kinetic and Computational Analysis of a Nearly Exponential Organic Replicator | journal = Angew. Chem. |volume = 117| pages = 6908–6913 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ange.200501527/abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Early adopters focused on prebiotic chemistry combined with [[supramolecular chemistry]], before it was generalized to the study of emergent properties and functions of any complex molecular systems. A 2017 review in the field of systems chemistry &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Ashkenasy |last2=Taylor |year= 2017| title = Systems Chemistry | journal = Chem. Soc. Rev. |volume = 46| pages = 2543–2554 | url = https://jsystchem.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/1759-2208-1-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; described the state of the art as out-of-equilibrium self-assembly, fuelled molecular motion, chemical networks in compartments and oscillating reactions.

==Examples==
[[Dynamic combinatorial chemistry]] has been used as a method to develop ligands for biomolecules and receptors for small molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li |last2=Otto |year= 2013| title = Dynamic Combinatorial Libraries: From Exploring Molecular Recognition to Systems Chemistry | journal = J. Am. Chem. Soc. |volume = 135 | pages = 9222–9239 | url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja402586c }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ligands that can recognize biomolecules are being identified by preparing libraries of potential ligands in the presence of a target biomacromolecule. This approach sets the stage for their application as diagnostic biosensors for fast monitoring of imbalances and illnesses and therapeutic agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Verma |last2=Rotello | year= 2005 | title = Surface recognition of biomacromolecules using nanoparticle receptors | journal = Chem. Comm. |volume = 3| pages = 303–312 | url = http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2005/CC/b410889b#!divAbstract }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual components of certain chemical system will self-assemble to form receptors which are
complementary to target molecule. In principle, the preferred library members will select and
amplify based on the strongest interactions between the template and products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Kiedrowski |last2=Herdewijn |year= 2008| title = Systems chemistry | journal =  Chem. Soc. Rev. |volume = 37| pages = 101–108 | url = http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2008/cs/b611921m }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molecular networks &amp; equilibrium==
A fundamental difference exists between chemistry as it is performed in most laboratories and chemistry as it occurs in life. Laboratory processes are mostly designed such that the (closed) system goes thermodynamically downhill; i.e. the product state is of lower [[Gibbs free energy]], yielding stable molecules that can be isolated and stored. Yet the chemistry of life operates in a very different way: Most molecules from which living systems are constituted are turned over continuously and are not necessarily thermodynamically stable. Nevertheless, living systems can be stable, but in a [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] sense. Such homeostatic (open) systems are far-from-equilibrium and are dissipative: they need energy to maintain themselves. In dissipative controlled systems the continuous supply of energy allows a continuous transition between different supramolecular states, where systems with unexpected properties may be discovered. One of the grand challenges of Systems Chemistry is to unveil [[complex network|complex reactions networks]], where molecules continuously consume energy to perform specific functions.
