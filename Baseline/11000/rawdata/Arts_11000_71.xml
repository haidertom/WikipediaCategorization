[[File:Peja.jpg|thumb|298x298px|Main square of the city of [[Peć]]]]

The '''architecture of Peć''', [[Kosovo]], describes a large mixture of architectural structures which are a reflection of the influential foreign rule all across the city. The architecture of the city consists of buildings, structures and constructions which were built with an architectural influence of the [[Byzantine architecture]], [[Serbo-Byzantine architecture]], [[Ottoman architecture]], [[Stalinist architecture]] (former Yugoslavia), and Modern cultures/architectures. Because of this there are many churches, mosques, buildings which are attraction points in the city and were built by the aforementioned influences. The rule of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Serbian Empire|Serbian]] empires and the historical influence of former [[Yugoslavia]] (Communist era) have shaped the architectural landscape of the city to become a conglomerate of cultures.

== Serbo-Byzantine Structures in Peć ==
[[File:Patriarchate of Peć 09 2010 1.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Main church of Patriarchate of Peć]]

=== Patriarchate of Peć ===
The [[Patriarchate of Peć (monastery)|Patriarchate of Peć]] is a Serbian-Orthodox Monastery and serves as the seat of the Serbian archbishopric and patriarchs. It is believed that the Patriarchate was found when Saint Sava around 1235 was still alive and the site became a metoh (land owned and governed by a monastery).

The Patriarchate of Peć consists of four main structures (churches). Its main churches are the Holy Apostles church (1266), the Church of Saint Demetrius (1320), the Church of the Holy Virgin Hodegetria (1330), the church of Saint Nicholas. The decoration of the Church of Saint Demetrius was decorated with frescoes around 1345.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5NyQEh8qFIQC], A Short History of Russia and the Balkan States, Donald Mackenzie Wallace, (The Encyclopædia Britannica Company, ltd., Jan 1, 1999 - 204 pages)&lt;/ref&gt; Paint decoration was used for the exterior walls instead of creating a relief from stone and brick.&lt;ref&gt;Slobodan Maldini, Srpska arhitektura u XX veku (Serbian)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Patriarchate of Peć was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Site list in 2004 as an extension to the [[Dečani Monastery]], these structures can be found under the category of ''[[Medieval Monuments in Kosovo]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/danger/], UNESCO (2006). "List of World Heritage in Danger". Retrieved 24 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 14th century the Church of the Holy Apostles was decorated since small modifications were made to it.

The Serbo-Byzantine architecture has been influenced by the Byzantine architecture and art traditions. Churches built with a Serbo-Byzantine architecture have a rectangular foundation, they have a central main dome with other smaller domes surrounding the main dome. A typical Serbo-Byzantine church has a rectangular foundation, with a major dome in the center with smaller domes around the center one. Usually Serbo-Byzantine monasteries/churches are decorated with frescoes that depict biblical stories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.znanje.org/i/i19/99iv04/99iv0416m/broj3.htm], Srpsko-vizantijski stil - opste osobine (Serbian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slobodan Maldini, Srpska arhitektura u XX veku&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the Patriarchate of Peć has built a high wall in its outskirts and has a military/police post block at its entrance which is guarded by local police or KFOR as a security measure for the Serb minority live in the facilities.

== Ottoman structures in Peć ==
''See also: [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman Architecture]] and [[Bazaar]]''
[[File:Çarshia e gjatë e Pejës.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Bazaar of Peć serves as the main market for Gold shops]]

=== Bazaar of Peć ===
The [[Bazaar]] of Peć is located ({{coord|42.659701|20.292903|type:landmark|display=inline}}) in the center
of the city located near the river between parallel residence zones and is a remnant of the Ottoman rule there. The earliest mention of the Bazaar of Peć according to some sources is around the 14th century. The market historically housed blacksmiths and carpenters but also facilitated the agricultural market.&lt;ref&gt;Instituti per Mbrojtjen e Monumenteve te Kultures:Monumentet kulturo-historike. Peje: Litografia, 2006. (Albanian)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bazaar of Peć or Pazar (Albanian) has mainly an Ottoman architecture on the buildings, which mainly serve as stores today.

The Bazaar of Peć was completely destroyed at least twice, once during the Italian occupation in 1943, and once during the 1999 war in Kosovo. Today the Bazaar of Peć, or locally known as Çarshia e Gjatë, is fully rebuilt (after the 1999 war) and still keeps the Ottoman architecture, and is the main market in the city of Peć, and is one of the many monuments which are under protection by the law.&lt;ref&gt;CHwB-Trashegimia Kulturore pa Kufij:Konservimi i Integruar. Prishtine:2011.(Albanian)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bajrakli Xhami.JPG|thumb|251x251px|Bajrakli Mosque]]

=== Bajrakli Mosque (Çarshi Xhamia) ===
Is the main mosque situated in the center of the Bazaar of Peć({{coord|42.660143|20.293633|type:landmark|display=inline}}). It was built in 1471 by Sultan Fatih Mehmet Hani and is an Ottoman style mosque with the oldest and highest dome in the city. The Bajrakli Xhamia is a single domed mosque which is one of the main three architectural types of mosques in Ottoman architecture. This style dates from the early Ottoman period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EhIjXjCVQyYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+oxford+history+of+islam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FQUSU8HxNqf8ywPe7ILACA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20oxford%20history%20of%20islam&amp;f=false], Sultanates and Gunpowder Empires, Ira M. Lapidus, The Oxford History of Islam, Ed. John L. Esposito, (Oxford University Press, 1999), 371.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bajrakli Xhamia was burned down once during 1943 by Italian forces when the Bazaar of Peć was completely burned down, however it was not destroyed during the 1999 War in Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;Instituti per Mbrojtjen e Monumenteve te Kultures:Monumentet kulturo-historike.

=== The Old Bath (Hammam) ===
{{See also|Turkish bath|l1=Hammam}}
[[File:Old Bath Peja.jpg|thumb|274x274px|The Old Bath seen from outside|left]]
({{coord|42.65877|20.296487|type:landmark|display=inline}})The Hammam is built similarly to [[Turkish bath]]s with Ottoman architecture. It was built under Ottoman rule and belonged to the Dukagjini Sandzak (1462–1485).&lt;ref&gt;CHwB-Trashegimia Kulturore pa Kufij:Konservimi i Integruar. Prishtine:2011.(Albanian)&lt;/ref&gt; The building has an asymmetric “double” bath. According to some sources the bath was reconstructed in 1861 because of unknown reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uSaH1bKAb8QC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=150&amp;f=false] Gail Warrander and Venera Knaus:Kosovo.USA:Bradt Travel Guide, 2008 p.159&lt;/ref&gt;

The bath has "an entrance area wardrobe, separation and insulation chambers, perspmation-massage-bathing area, and water storage and furnace chamber. The Hammam has a quadraregular foundation and the material that was used to build it was stone and bricks produced with an ‘opus mixum’’technique’’. The bath is a Turkish Bath type of bath.&lt;ref&gt;CHwB-Trashegimia Kulturore pa Kufij:Konservimi i Integruar. Prishtine:2011.(Albanian)&lt;/ref&gt;

The bath was damaged during war and was reconstructed after. Today, the hammam serves as an exhibition hall for different art shows and more.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uSaH1bKAb8QC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=150&amp;f=false] Gail Warrander and Venera Knaus:Kosovo.USA:Bradt Travel Guide, 2008 p.159&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baburao Painter''' (1890–1954) was an [[Cinema of India|Indian film]] director.&lt;ref name="Gulzar2003"&gt;{{cite book | author1=[[Gulzar]] | author2=[[Govind Nihalani]] | author3= Saibal Chatterjee | title=Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema: An Enchanting Close-Up of India's Hindi Cinema | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8y8vN9A14nkC&amp;pg=PT549 | accessdate=11 November 2012 | year=2003 | publisher=Popular Prakashan | isbn=978-81-7991-066-5 | page=549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

He was born Baburao Krishnarao Mestry in 1890 in Kolhapur. He taught himself to [[paint]] and derives its name "Painter". (hence the name) and [[sculpt]] in [[academic art]] school style. He and his artist cousin [[Anandrao Painter]] between 1910 and 1916 were the leading painters of stage backdrops in [[Western India]] doing several famous curtains for Sangeet Natak troupes and also for Gujarati [[Parsi theatre]]s. They became avid filmgoers following [[Raja Harishchandra]].

Baburao and his cousin Anandarao bought a movie projector from the [[Mumbai]] [[flea market]] and proceeded to exhibit films, studying the art of movies all the while. Anandarao was busy with assembling a camera for their maiden venture, and his untimely death at this juncture compelled Baburao to go it alone

They turned to cinema first as exhibitors while trying to assemble their own camera. Anandrao however died in 1916 and Painter and his main disciple [[Vishnupant Damle|V.G. Damle]] eventually put together a working camera in 1918.

==Film career==
[[File:Kolhapur Memorial to Baburao Painter 2012 IMG 1601.jpg|thumb|right|A Memorial to Baburao Painter in [[Kolhapur]]]]
Baburao was one of the leading stage painter for  theatres in Western India during the period of 1910 and 1916. He was also a film enthusiast and founded [[Maharashtra Film Company]] in 1919. To enable this Baburao  borrowed money from [[Tanibai Kagolkar]], a long-time admirer. Movie acting, especially tamasha's were looked down upon in conservative societies like Kolhapur so the studio itself was a living quarter for quite a few including leading ladies – Gulab Bai (renamed Kamaladevi) and Anusuya Bai (renamed Sushiladevi). Painter got onboard his old colleagues including Damle and [[S. Fatehlal]] and later on [[V. Shantaram]], trio who later on left him to set up their  own studio called [[Prabhat Film Company]].

Baburao's first feature film was Sairandri (1920), which got heavily censored for its graphic depiction of slaying of Keechak by [[Bhima]]. However the movie itself got positive critics and commercial acclaim spurring Painter on to take on more ambitious projects. He wrote his own screenplays, and led the three-dimensional space rather than stage-painting in the Indian movie. 1921/22, he published the first Indian films and programs designed to even the [[movie poster]]s. Publicity was not alien to Painter's many talents – in 1921–22, he distributed programme booklets complete with photographs and film details.

Baburao was a man of many talents – he wrote his own screenplays and he was also the first Indian filmmaker to adopt the method, [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] had described as 'stenographic' – he sketched the costumes, movements, and characters. He changed the concept of set designing from painted curtains to solid multi-dimensional lived in spaces, he introduced artificial lighting and understood the importance of publicity. As early as 1921–22 he was the first to issue programme booklets, complete with details of the film and photographs. He also painted himself tasteful, eye-catching posters of his films.

A perfectionist, he insisted upon any number of rehearsals. As Zunzarrao Pawar, a [[cast member]], said '` He would take umpteen rehearsals before actual shooting....but he was very slow in film-making. That was why we used to get annoyed with him sometimes.'`

The advent of sound in 1931 did not excite Painter. However, after a few more [[silent film]]s, the Maharashtra Film Company pulled down its shutters with the advent of sound. Baburao was not particularly keen on the talkies for he believed that they would destroy the visual culture so painfully evolved over the years.

He returned to painting and sculpture, his original vocation barring sporadic ventures like remaking Savkari Pash in sound in 1936, Pratibha (1937), one of his few preserved films which is a good illustration of Painter's control over big sets, lighting and crowd scenes and Lokshahir Ramjoshi (1947) on Shantaram's invitation.

The beautiful posters that Baburao painted for his films prompted the advice of not wasting his talent on ''dirty walls'', that an [[art gallery]] was the correct destination! Prophetic words indeed, because later his posters were up at [[J.J. School of Art]], [[Mumbai]] and much admired by the principal, Gladstone Solomon.

==Filmography==

=== Actor ===
* Kalyan Khajina (1924)
* Sinhagad (1923) – Emperor Shivaji

Together, Sinhagad and Kalyan Khajina won a medal at the Wembley Exhibition, London. One newspaper, Daily Express, described the films as ''full of strangely wistful beauty, and acted with extraordinary grace.''

===Art Director===
* Usha (1935/I)
* Usha (1935/II)

===Writer===
* Sairandhri (1920)

===Cinematographer===

* [[Sairandhri (1920 Hindi film)]]: This episode from the Mahabharata dealt with the slaying of Keechak by [[Bhima]] (one of the Pandava princes), and the film was based on the play Keechak Wadh by K.P. Khadilkar. The play itself was banned because of the perceived criticism of Lord Curzon. The intense realism of the killing was horrifying to the audience, and the scenes were deleted.

=== Director ===

* Surekha Haran (1921): This was the debut film of [[V. Shantaram]]
* Bhagwata Bhakta Damaji (1922)
* Damaji (1922)
* Vatsalaharan (1923)
* Sinhagad (1923): Baburao shifted from painted curtains to multi-dimensional sets. Another first – he used artificial lighting to create the effect of fog and of moonlight. The film was based on [[Hari Narayan Apte]]'s novel "Gad Aala Pan Sinha Gela" (गड आला पण सिंह गेला). The protagonist Tanaji was a follower of [[Shivaji]] and died while capturing Kondhana Fort.While filming Sinhagad, Baburao fell off a horse, the injury causing a lifelong speech defect. Sinhagad proved so popular that it attracted the Revenue Department's attention to bring about introduction of Entertainment Tax.
* Sati Padmini (1924)
* Shri Krishna Avatar (1924)
* Shaha la Shah (1925)
* Rana Hamir (1925)
* Maya Bazaar (1925)
* [[Savkari Pash]] (1925): Dealt with money lending and the plight of poor farmers. However the audience long fed on mythological fantasy and historical love was just not prepared for so strong a dose of realism and the film did not do well. Baburao returned to costume dramas. The film failed. Baburao Painter returned to the tried-and-true subject-matter.Painter's artistic masterpiece remains Savkari Pash (1925), dealing with money lending, a problem that blighted the lives of countless illiterate, poor farmers. J.H.Wadia on the two versions of Savkari Pash: ''I faintly remember the silent Savkari Pash...But it was only when I saw the talkie version that I realised what a great creative artist he (Baburao) was. I go into a trance when I recollect the long shot of a dreary hut photographed in low key, highlighted only by the howl of a dog.''&lt;ref name=Filmheritagefoundation&gt;{{cite web|title=Savkari Pash (1925)|url=http://filmheritagefoundation.co.in/savkari-pash-the-indian-shylock-1925-80-mins/|website=filmheritagefoundation.co.in|publisher=Film Heritage Foundation|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Baptism of Christ''''' is a fresco by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Pietro Perugino]] and his workshop,  executed around 1482 and located in the [[Sistine Chapel]], [[Rome]].

==History==
The commission of the work originated in 1480, when Perugino was decorating a chapel in the [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]]. [[Pope Sixtus IV]] was pleased by his work, and decided to commission him also the decoration of the new Chapel he had built in the Vatican Palace. Due to the size of the work, Perugino was later joined by a group of painters from Florence, including [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]] and others.
[[File:Perugino, battesimo di cristo 04.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Detail.]]
Perugino's assistants in the Sistine Chapel included [[Pinturicchio]], [[Andrea d'Assisi]], [[Rocco Zoppo]] or, less likely, [[Lo Spagna]] or [[Bartolomeo della Gatta]], but the attribution of details to them is disputed.

==Description==
The fresco of the ''Baptism of Christ'' is the first on the wall on the right of the altar, and parallels ''[[Moses Leaving to Egypt (Pietro Perugino)|Moses Leaving to Egypt and the Circumcision of Elezier]]'' facing it on the opposite wall, also by Perugino's workshop. The baptism was in fact considered by [[Augustine]] and other early Christian writers as a kind of "spiritual circumcision".

The scene follows a symmetrical pattern, typical of Perugino. In the center is the [[Jordan River]] flowing towards the observer and reaching the feet of Jesus and [[John the Baptist|John]], who is baptizing the former. A dove, symbol of the Holy Spirit, descends from the sky; it is sent by God, represented within a luminous cloud and flanked by flying  seraphims and cherubims. The landscape includes a symbolic view of Rome, recognizable by a triumphal arch, the [[Colosseum]] and the [[Pantheon (Rome)|Pantheon]]. The thin trees are typical of the Umbrian school and of Perugino in particular.

At the sides are two secondary episodes: the Baptist  (left) and Jesus (right) preaching at the crowd. The central scene also features two kneeling angels who are keeping a towel: these are elements inspired by [[early Netherlandish painting|Flemish paintings]], and can be seen in works by [[Hugo van der Goes]] and in the [[Portinari Triptych]]. At the sides, in the foreground, are portraits of contemporary characters, normally rare in Perugino, but in this case spurred by their presence in the works by Ghirlandaio, who was also working in the Sistine Chapel.

The fresco is surmounted by a frieze with the signature &lt;small&gt;OPVS PETRI PERVSINI · CASTRO PLEBIS&lt;/small&gt;.

{{For|the album by Tony MacAlpine|Chromaticity (album)}}

[[File:PlanckianLocus.png|right|thumb|250px|The [[CIE 1931]] xy chromaticity space, also showing the chromaticities of black-body light sources of various temperatures, and lines of constant [[Color temperature#Correlated color temperature|correlated color temperature]]]]

'''Chromaticity''' is an objective specification of the quality of a [[color]] regardless of its [[luminance]]. Chromaticity consists of two [[dimension (mathematics and physics)|independent parameters]], often specified as [[hue]] (h) and [[colorfulness]] (s), where the latter is alternatively called saturation, chroma, intensity,&lt;ref&gt;In modern terminology the word "intensity" may refer to lightness, not to colorfulness.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[excitation purity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Progress in Optics | author = Emil Wolf | publisher = North Holland Pub. Co | year = 1961 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5n7yXmBusL0C&amp;q=chromaticity+hue+purity&amp;dq=chromaticity+hue+purity&amp;pgis=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography | author = Leslie D. Stroebel, Richard D. Zakia | publisher = Focal Press | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-240-51417-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CU7-2ZLGFpYC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=chromaticity+hue+saturation+chroma+colorfulness+purity}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number of parameters follows from [[trichromacy]] of vision of most humans, which is assumed by most models in [[color science]].

==Quantitative description==
In color science, the [[white point]] of an illuminant or of a display is a neutral reference characterized by a chromaticity; all other chromaticities may be defined in relation to this reference using [[polar coordinates]]. The ''hue'' is the angular component, and the ''purity'' is the radial component, normalized{{clarify|date=June 2013|reason=note that the chromaticity space does not have a canonical affine structure, so there are no invariantly defined ratios of lengths even along the same line}} by the maximum radius for that hue.

Purity is roughly equivalent to the term "[[saturation (color theory)|saturation]]" in the [[HSV color space|HSV color model]]. The property "[[hue]]" is as used in general color theory and in specific [[color model]]s such as [[HSV and HSL]] color spaces, though it is more [[Color difference#Tolerance|perceptually uniform]] in color models such as [[Munsell color system|Munsell]], [[CIELAB]] or [[CIECAM02]].

Some [[color space]]s separate the three dimensions of color into one [[luminance (relative)|luminance]] dimension and a pair of chromaticity dimensions. For example, the white point of an [[sRGB]] display is an {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}} chromaticity of (0.3127, 0.3290), where {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} coordinates are used in the xyY space.
{| align=left style="margin-right:1em; border:1px gray solid" width=480px
 | style="font-size:87%; padding:2px" |{{math|(''u′'', ''v′'')}}, the chromaticity in [[CIELUV]], is a fairly [[Color difference#Tolerance|perceptually uniform]] presentation of the chromaticity as (another than in CIE 1931) planar [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] shape. This presentation is a [[projective transformation]] of the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram above.
 | [[Image:CIE 1976 UCS.png|240px]]
 |}
These pairs determine a chromaticity as [[affine coordinates]] on a [[triangle]] in a [[two-dimensional space|2D-space]], which contains all possible chromaticities. These {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are used because of simplicity of expression in [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE 1931]] (see below) and have no inherent advantage. Other [[coordinate system]]s on the same X-Y-Z triangle, or other [[color triangle]]s, can be used.

On the other hand, some color spaces such as [[RGB color space|RGB]] and [[CIE XYZ color space|XYZ]] do not separate out chromaticity, but chromaticity is defined by a [[projectivization|mapping that normalizes out intensity]], and its coordinates, such as {{mvar|r}} and {{mvar|g}} or {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}, can be calculated through the [[division (mathematics)|division]] operation, such as {{math|1=''x'' =}}&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''X''|''X'' + ''Y'' + ''Z''}}, and so on.

The xyY space is a cross between the CIE XYZ and its normalized chromaticity coordinates xyz, such that the luminance Y is preserved and augmented with just the required two chromaticity dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Digital Video and HDTV: Algorithms and Interfaces | author = Charles A.

'''''Cliff Rock - Appledore''''' is an [[oil painting]] by [[United States|American]] artist [[Childe Hassam]], painted in 1903. It is currently part of the permanent collection at the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]].

==Description==
Inspired by the [[France|French]] [[impressionism|impressionists]] of the time, Childe painted vibrant, colorful lines filled with action and movement. The varying brushstrokes and loose handling of the medium, Childe shows his confident free handling. Blue ocean reflects onto the large, sun-bleached rock, while Childe’s open strokes leads the viewer’s eye back into the painting, off into the distance to the shores beyond, which are barely hinted at with lines of cream and green. Through the broken brushstrokes, Childe’s desire for realism shines through with his use of shadows and broken reflection of the water.&lt;ref name= "Cliff"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cliff Rock - Appledore gallery label|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/cliff-rock-appledore-hassam-childe|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|accessdate=12 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical information==
Hassam, like many American painters at the turn of the century, studied in [[Paris, France]] for three years. He adopted the impressionist style as his own, and worked closely with other [[American Impressionists]] such as [[Mary Cassatt]]. Childe is often hailed as a pure example of the American Impressionist movement.&lt;ref name="Cliff" /&gt;

A native New Endlander, Childe heavily favored the [[New England]] area for his work, and spent his time painting much of the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]]. This shore is the shore of Appledore, one of the nine islands that make up the [[Isles of Shoals]], located off the coasts of [[New Hampshire]] and [[Maine]]. Appledore was the location of a small [[artist colony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fredrick Childe Hassam Biography|url=http://www.frederickhassam.org/biography.html|accessdate=12 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition===
''Cliff Rock - Appledore'' was purchased at its inaugural exhibition in 1906 by the John Herron Art Fund.&lt;ref name="Cliff" /&gt;

==History==
Create was co-founded on 7 July 2003 by current Chief Executive Nicky Goulder with the aim of empowering lives through the creative arts. Prior to this, she was Chief Executive of the [[Orchestra of St John's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/alumni/alumni-profiles/nicky-goulder/| title = Lancaster University Alumni: Nicky Goulder | publisher = [[Lancaster University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Nicky won the Clarins Most Dynamisante Woman of the Year Award, which recognises "the action and commitment of inspirational British women who work tirelessly to help underprivileged or sick children across the globe."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.clarins.co.uk/commitment-responsibility-dynamisante-women/nicky_goulder.html| title = Dynamisante Women: Nicky Goulder | publisher = Clarins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015/16, Create ran 989 workshops, delivering 20,249 contact hours to 2,150 disadvantaged and vulnerable children and adults. In 2013, it received a grant of £480,000 from The Queen’s Trust to increase its programme by 280% over the next three years with young carers, young people with disabilities and young offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.queenstrust.org.uk/what-we-do/who-we-support/| title = Who We Support| publisher = The Queen's Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2003, Create has run 6,609 workshops, delivering 228,784 contact hours to over 31,000 people. Projects have been delivered in Berkshire, Birmingham, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Cumbria, Derbyshire, Essex, Glasgow, Hampshire, Hertfordshire, Kent, London, Manchester, Nottinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Suffolk and Surrey.&lt;ref name=impactreport&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://createarts.org.uk/blog/category/impact_report/| title = Impact Report| publisher = Create| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150526050651/http://createarts.org.uk/blog/category/impact_report/| archivedate = 2015-05-26| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Elvis Presley]]''' has inspired artistic and cultural works since he entered the national consciousness. From that point, interest in his personal and public life has never stopped. Some scholars have even studied many aspects of his profound cultural influence.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Koenigsberg, "'I MOVE, THEREFORE I AM:' Elvis Presley, Rock 'n' Roll, and the Liberation
of the American Body," keynote address at the INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELVIS PRESLEY (Monday, May 19, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' historian [[Joel Whitburn]] declared Presley the "#1 act of the Rock era".

The following lists cover various media which include items of historic interest, enduring works of high art, and recent representations in popular culture. Only people and works with Wikipedia articles are included.

For purposes of classification, popular culture music is a separate section from operas and oratorios. Television covers live action series, TV movies, miniseries, and North American animation but not Japanese anime, which appears with manga and graphic novels.

According to several non-music magazines, channels and publications, Presley ranks among the most significant icons, both in America and worldwide:

* In 2005, [[BBC 2]] explored how photography had influenced world events and named the people who had been photographed the most in a 10 episode television series entitled ''The World's Most Photographed''. Other than Presley, no musician merited a separate episode, which comprised four women among a list of political leaders, thinkers, heads of state and actors.
* Also in 2005, ''[[Life (magazine)|LIFE]]'' Magazine highlighted Elvis's advent in 1956, and the rock and roll revolution he ignited and included them in a special issue published in September 2005 and which they named "The 100 events that shook our world: a history of Pictures in the last 100 years".
* In 2006, ''[[The Atlantic]]'' ranked him the 66th most influential American ever. No other individual involved in entertainment, other than [[Walt Disney]], ranked higher. 
* Also in 2006, [[The History Channel]] selected September 9, 1956, the date of the first of his three appearances on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]]'', as one of the “10 Days That Unexpectedly Changed America.”
* In 2008, the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]-launched "Pantheon" programme, which maps cultural production, ranked him the 117th most significant person of any nationality in recorded history. Only the Reverend [[Martin Luther King]], a Nobel Peace prize winner, outranks him among all persons born in the United States of America. 
* In 2010, ''LIFE'' Magazine ranked him #96 in their list of the 100 people who changed the world. Only [[Charles Chaplin]] and [[Louis Armstrong]] ranked higher among entertainers. 
* In 2014, the ''Smithsonian Magazine'' issued a listing of the 100 most significant Americans of all time, which included Presley as well as another six singers and musicians. No rankings were provided.
* Also in 2014, [[Wikipedia]] made a study on the most popular historic figures, insofar as the number of Internet searches, with Presley landing in the #69 position, a rank higher than that of any entertainer from the 20th Century.
* In 2015, ''[[National Geographic]]'' deemed his advent (and that of Rock Music) in 1956 an event of such importance, that it ranked 79th in their list of the 100 most significant events that changed the world since time began. No other entertainer is listed separately.

==Other==

* Elvis died three days before [[Groucho Marx]]; Groucho fans blamed Elvis's death for Groucho's death not getting as much publicity.&lt;ref&gt;''Raised Eyebrows: My Years Inside Groucho's House'', Steve Soliar, 1996, Stoddart Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; Elvis and Groucho were next door neighbors in Beverly Hills, California.

*In a survey taken in 1996,  a sampling of Chinese people were asked to name three famous Westerners. They chose Jesus Christ, Richard Nixon and Elvis Presley. That same year,  a NYT reporter attending a Chinese-US summit, spoke of the time when the Chinese leader Jiang Zemin, then visiting the Philippines,   proceeded to do a duet, in perfect English, of "Love me tender",   his partner being his host, President Fidel Ramos. 

* On its edition of January 21, 1998, [[TV Guide]] named Elvis' 9 minute uninterrupted stand-up session performance, from the start of   "Heartbreak Hotel",  till the end of "Love me tender", which was sung and performed live, in front of a studio audience on June 29,  1968 at the Burbank Studios and later shown on NBC on December 3, 1968, as the greatest rock moment in the history of television,   beating the runner up,   Michael Jackson's performance of the song "Billy Jean"   which Jackson performed in front of a live audience on March 25, 1983 at the Civic Auditorium in Pasadena, CA, the latter while dancing to what became known as "The Moonwalk" and singing to his own pre recorded vocals. This performance was telecast by NBC on May 16, 1986 on the occasion of the 25th Anniversary of Motown.  

* In 2006, Elvis's teddy bear Mabel, made in 1909 by [[Margarete Steiff GmbH|Steiff]], was on display at a Children's Museum near [[Wookey Hole Caves]] when a [[Doberman]] destroyed it. The insurance company had insisted that the teddy bears be protected by guard dogs.

* In December of 2008, Zimbio, now [[Livingly Media]], published its list of the 100 most influntial people in 20thj Century fashion, ranking Elvis at #8, with only David Bowie, amongst those who were musicians, ranking above him at #5.  

* On March 1, 2011, [[István Tarlós]], the  Mayor of Budapest announced that the city would be naming a park   facing its  oldest crossing, the [[Margaret Bridge]] after him,   as well as bestow upon him posthumous citizenship, as a gesture of late recognition and gratitude for his appeal,   in early 1957,   for humanitarian emergency assistance and  which yielded some US$6 million in contributions (US$49.5 million  in adjusted dollars),   whose aim was to lessen   the plight of some 250,000 Hungarian refugees fleeing the double invasion of their country, of 24 and 31 October 1956,   by the then Soviet Union.  Thanks to these funds, distributed by the International Red Cross in Geneva, they eventually settled in Austria and England, for life.  Other recipients of such citizenship honours by the city of Budapest include [[Václav Havel]], [[Edward Teller]], [[Lech Walesa]] and [[Raoul Wallenberg]]  

* In September 2013 [[Flavorwire]] named Elvis's first of three appearances on the Ed Sullivan Show as one of the 25 most memorable moments in TV history. It ranked #12,  with only the Beatles' first appearance on the same show,  8 years later,  outranking it, at #11 amongst those in the musical field.

* In July 2014, the [[BMW]]   Group announced that one of Elvis' two [[BMW 507]], found in California that year and in a dire state after 5 decades of use and misuse would be put on display for a short period at the BMW Museum in Munich, before being entirely restored by its Classic department. The fully restored car, which had been painted red by Presley himself in 1959, was to be given its original white color, then put on display in the newly renovated BMW Zentrum Museum located at their US manufacturing center in Greer, SC. In 2017, it was returned to the Munich Museum, where it is now located for posterity as one of only 252 BMW 507 models ever built.

*In 2017, the Washington DC-based [[Museum of the Bible]] which opened in mid November of that year, showcased his "King James" Bible, which, according to the Vice President of the Museum and as evidenced by his own handwritten notes, proved not just that the Bible had a profound impact on him, but that he was, as well, a prime example of the unparalleled influence of the book. The Museum has received 600,000 visitors since its opening.

* On 12 May 2018, an [[Omega SA|Omega]] watch gifted to Elvis by RCA Records in 1961 to celebrate his sale of 75-million records,   sold at a [[Phillips (auctioneers)|Phillips]] auction in Geneva for $1,812,500.  The watch, retailed by [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]]  hammered for 1.5-million CHF and with buyer’s premium totaled 1,812,318 CHF, or $1,812,500. As of May 12, 2018 it is the highest price ever paid for an Omega watch. Mr.  Petros Protopapas,   Omega's Museum Director, and who attended the auction,    later confirmed the Museum he heads to have been the winning bidder.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14602">A '''demosaicing''' (also '''de-mosaicing''', '''demosaicking''' or '''debayering''') [[algorithm]] is a [[digital image processing|digital image process]] used to reconstruct a full color image from the incomplete color samples output from an [[image sensor]] overlaid with a [[color filter array]] (CFA). It is also known as ''CFA interpolation'' or ''color reconstruction''.

Most modern digital cameras acquire images using a single image sensor overlaid with a CFA, so demosaicing is part of the [[Color image pipeline|processing pipeline]] required to render these images into a viewable format.

Many modern digital cameras can save images in a [[raw image format|raw format]] allowing the user to demosaic them using software, rather than using the camera's built-in [[firmware]].

==Goal==
The aim of a demosaicing algorithm is to reconstruct a full color image (i.e. a full set of color triples) from the spatially undersampled [[Channel (digital image)|color channels]] output from the CFA. The algorithm should have the following traits:

* Avoidance of the introduction of false color artifacts, such as chromatic [[Aliasing|aliases]], [[Bayer filter#Zippering artifact|zippering]] (abrupt unnatural changes of intensity over a number of neighboring pixels) and [[purple fringing]]
* Maximum preservation of the [[image resolution]]
* Low [[Algorithmic efficiency|computational complexity]] for fast processing or efficient in-camera hardware implementation
* Amenability to analysis for accurate [[noise reduction]]

==Color filter array==
{{main|Color filter array}}
[[File:Bayer pattern on sensor.svg|thumb|250px|The Bayer arrangement of color filters on the pixel array of an image sensor. Each two-by-two cell contains two green, one blue, and one red filter.]]

A color filter array is a mosaic of [[color]] filters in front of the image sensor.   Commercially, the most commonly used CFA configuration is the [[Bayer filter]] illustrated here. This has alternating [[red]] (R) and [[green]] (G) filters for odd rows and alternating green (G) and [[blue]] (B) filters for even rows. There are twice as many green filters as red or blue ones, catering to the [[human eye]]'s higher sensitivity to green light.

Since the color subsampling of a CFA by its nature results in [[aliasing]], an [[Anti-aliasing filter#Optical anti-aliasing filter|optical anti-aliasing filter]] is typically placed in the optical path between the image sensor and the lens to reduce the false color artifacts (chromatic aliases) introduced by interpolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|author1=Adrian Davies |author2=Phil Fennessy | title = Digital imaging for photographers
| edition = Fourth
| publisher = Focal Press

| isbn = 0-240-51590-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since each pixel of the sensor is behind a color filter, the output is an array of pixel values, each indicating a raw intensity of one of the three filter colors. Thus, an algorithm is needed to estimate for each pixel the color levels for all color components, rather than a single component.

==Illustration==
To reconstruct a full color image from the data collected by the color filtering array, a form of [[interpolation]] is needed to fill in the blanks. The mathematics here is subject to individual implementation, and is called demosaicing.

In this example, we use [[Adobe Photoshop]]'s bicubic interpolation to simulate the circuitry of a Bayer filter device such as a [[digital camera]].

The image below simulates the output from a Bayer filtered image sensor; each pixel has only a red, green or blue component. The corresponding original image is shown alongside the demosaiced reconstruction at the end of this section.

A digital camera typically has means to reconstruct a whole RGB image using the above information. The resulting image could be something like this:

The reconstructed image is typically accurate in uniform-colored areas, but has a loss of resolution (detail and sharpness) and has edge artifacts (for example, the edges of letters have visible color fringes and some roughness).

==Algorithms==

===Simple interpolation===
These algorithms are examples of [[multivariate interpolation]] on a uniform grid, using relatively straightforward mathematical operations on nearby instances of the same color component. The simplest method is [[nearest-neighbor interpolation]] which simply copies an adjacent pixel of the same color channel.  It is unsuitable for any application where quality matters, but can be useful for generating previews given limited computational resources. Another simple method is [[bilinear interpolation]], whereby the red value of a non-red pixel is computed as the average of the two or four adjacent red pixels, and similarly for blue and green.  More complex methods that interpolate independently within each color plane include [[bicubic interpolation]], [[spline interpolation]], and [[Lanczos resampling]].

Although these methods can obtain good results in homogenous image regions, they are prone to severe demosaicing artifacts in regions with edges and details when used with pure-color CFAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Hybrid color filter array demosaicking for effective artifact suppression | author1=Lanlan Chang | author2=Yap-Peng Tan | url=http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home5/CHAN0069/JEI013003.pdf | pages=2 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229063407/http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home5/CHAN0069/JEI013003.pdf | archivedate=2009-12-29 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, linear interpolation can obtain very good results when combined with a spatio-spectral (panchromatic) CFA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sisl.seas.harvard.edu/files/pub/HirakawaWolfe2007.pdf |title=Spatio-Spectral Color Filter Array Design for Enhanced Image Fidelity |author1=Keigo Hirakawa |author2=Patrick J. Wolfe |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720195627/http://sisl.seas.harvard.edu/files/pub/HirakawaWolfe2007.pdf |archivedate=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
One could exploit simple formation models of images for demosaicing. 
In natural images within the same segment, the ratio of colors should be preserved. 
This fact was exploited in an image sensitive interpolation for demosaicing.

===Pixel correlation within an image===
More sophisticated demosaicing algorithms exploit the spatial and/or spectral correlation of pixels within a color image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hybrid color filter array demosaicking for effective artifact suppression |author1=Lanlan Chang |author2=Yap-Peng Tan |url=http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home5/CHAN0069/JEI013003.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229063407/http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home5/CHAN0069/JEI013003.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spatial correlation is the tendency of pixels to assume similar color values within a small homogeneous region of an image. Spectral correlation is the dependency between the pixel values of different color planes in a small image region.

These algorithms include:

* '''Variable Number of Gradients (VNG)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interpolation using a Threshold-based variable number of gradients |author=Ting Chen |url=http://scien.stanford.edu/pages/labsite/1999/psych221/projects/99/tingchen/main.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422035609/http://scien.stanford.edu/pages/labsite/1999/psych221/projects/99/tingchen/main.htm |archivedate=2012-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; interpolation computes gradients near the pixel of interest and uses the lower gradients (representing smoother and more similar parts of the image) to make an estimate.  It is used in first versions of [[dcraw]], and suffers from color artifacts.
* '''Pixel Grouping (PPG)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pixel Grouping for Color Filter Array Demosaicing |author=Chuan-kai Lin, Portland State University |year=2004 |url=https://sites.google.com/site/chklin/demosaic/}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses assumptions about natural scenery in making estimates. It has fewer color artifacts on natural images than the Variable Number of Gradients method; it was introduced in [[dcraw]] from rel. 8.71 as "Patterned Pixel Grouping".
* '''Adaptive Homogeneity-Directed (AHD)''' somewhat the industry standard. Interpolation selects the direction of interpolation so as to maximize a homogeneity metric, thus typically minimizing color artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Adaptive homogeneity-directed demosaicing algorithm | author=Kiego Hirakawa; [[Thomas W. Parks]] | url=http://nagykrisztian.com/store/hirakawa.pdf | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been implemented in recent versions of dcraw.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/ Decoding raw digital photos in Linux], Dave Coffin.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Aliasing Minimization and Zipper Elimination (AMaZE)''' designed by Emil J. Martinec, slow but with a great performance specially on low noise captures. An implementation of AMaZE  can be found in [[RawTherapee]].

===Video super-resolution/demosaicing===
It has been shown that [[super-resolution]] and demosaicing are two faces of the same problem and it is reasonable to address them in a unified context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://www.duke.edu/%7Esf59/TIP_Demos_Final_Color.pdf | title = Multi-Frame Demosaicing and Super-Resolution of Color Images |author1=Sina Farsiu |author2=Michael Elad |author3=Peyman Milanfar | journal= IEEE Trans. on Image Processing|year=2006|volume=15|issue=1|pages=141–159 | doi = 10.1109/TIP.2005.860336}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that both these problems address the aliasing issue. Therefore, especially in the case of video (multi-frame) reconstruction, a joint super-resolution and demosaicing approach provides the optimal solution.

===Trade-offs===
Some methods may produce better results for natural scenes, and some for printed material, for instance. This reflects the inherent problem of estimating pixels that are not definitively known. Naturally, there is also the ubiquitous trade-off of speed versus quality of estimation.

==Use in computer image processing software==
When one has access to the [[Raw image format|raw image data]] from a digital camera, one can use computer software with a variety of different demosaicing algorithms instead of being limited to the one built into the camera. A few raw development programs, such as [[RawTherapee]], give the user an option to choose which algorithm should be used. Most programs, however, are coded to use one particular method. The differences in rendering the finest detail (and grain texture) that come from the choice of demosaicing algorithm are among the main differences between various raw developers; often photographers will prefer a particular program for aesthetic reasons related to this effect.

The color artifacts due to demosaicing provide important clues for identifying photo forgeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~huangyz/cvpr08_Huang.pdf |title=Demosaicking recognition with applications in digital photo authentication based on a quadratic pixel correlation model |author1=YiZhen Huang |author2=YangJing Long |journal=Proc.

'''Elizabeth Eckford''' (born October 4, 1941) was one of the [[Little Rock Nine]], a group of [[African-American]] students who, in 1957, were the first black students ever to attend classes at [[Little Rock Central High School]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]]. The integration came as a result of ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''. Eckford's public ordeal was captured by press photographers on the morning of September 4, 1957, after she was prevented from entering the school by the Arkansas National Guard. A dramatic snapshot by Johnny Jenkins of the United Press (UP) showed the young girl being followed and threatened by an angry white mob; this and other photos of the day's startling events were circulated around the US and the world by the print press.

The most famous photo of the event was taken by [[Ira Wilmer Counts Jr.|Will Counts]] of the ''Arkansas Democrat''. His image was the unanimous selection for a [[1958 Pulitzer Prize]], but since the story had earned the ''Arkansas Gazette'' two other Pulitzer Prizes already, the Prize was awarded to another photographer for a pleasant photograph of a two-year-old boy in Washington, D.C. A different photo taken by Counts of Alex Wilson, a black reporter for the ''Memphis Tri-State Defender'' being beaten by the angry mob in Little Rock the same day, was chosen as the "News Picture of the Year" for 1957 by the [[National Press Photographers Association]]. This image by Counts prompted President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to send federal troops to Little Rock.

==Background==

On September 4, 1957, Eckford and eight other African American students (known as the [[Little Rock Nine]]) made an unsuccessful attempt to enter [[Little Rock Central High School]], which had been [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]]. An angry mob of about 400 surrounded the school that day, with the complicity of the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]].&lt;ref name= "Margolick p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Margolick|2007|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fifteen-year-old Eckford tried to enter the school, while soldiers of the National Guard, under orders from [[Orval Faubus|Arkansas Governor Faubus]], stepped in her way to prevent her from entering. Eventually, she gave up and tried to flee to a bus stop through the mob of segregationists who surrounded and threatened to [[Lynching|lynch]] her.&lt;ref name= "Margolick p. "/&gt; Once Eckford got to the bus stop, she couldn't stop crying. A reporter, [[Benjamin Fine]], having in mind his own 15-year-old daughter, sat down next to Eckford. He tried to comfort her and told her, "don't let them see you cry." &lt;ref name= "Roberts-Klibanoff p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Klibanoff|2007| p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, she was also protected by a white woman named [[Grace Lorch]] who escorted her onto a city bus.&lt;ref name= "Historyp. "&gt;{{harvnb|History|2012|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Beals p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Beals|2007|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original plan was to have the nine children arrive together, but when the meeting place was changed the night before, the Eckford family's lack of a telephone left Elizabeth uninformed of the change.&lt;ref name= "encyclopediaofarkansasp. "&gt;{{harvnb|encyclopediaofarkansas|2012|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instructions were given by [[Daisy Bates (civil rights activist)|Daisy Bates]], a strong activist for desegregation, for the nine students to wait for her so that they could all walk together to the rear entrance of the school.&lt;ref name= "Williams p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2007|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This last-minute change caused Elizabeth to be the first to take a different route to school, walking up to the front entrance completely alone. Elizabeth Eckford's family were not informed of the meeting, and didn't know that the school board asked the parents to accompany her. Also, Eckford rode a public bus alone to the segregated school. That day, Elizabeth wore a starched black-and-white dress, and she covered her face under black sunglasses. Elizabeth also held her school book in her hand. As she walked toward the school, Elizabeth was surrounded by a crowd of armed guards and a mob of people, and she did not see any black faces. The mob included men, women, and teenagers (white students) who opposed integration. The white teenagers chanted "Two, four, six, eight, we ain't gonna integrate." Elizabeth attempted to go into the school through the mob, but was denied entrance. Eckford ran to a bus bench at the end of the block. Eckford described her experience:

{{quote|I stood looking at the school— it looked so big! Just then the guards let some white students through. The crowd was quiet. I guess they were waiting to see what was going to happen. When I was able to steady my knees, I walked up to the guard who had let the white students in. He didn't move. When I tried to squeeze past him, he raised his bayonet and then the other guards moved in and they raised their bayonets. They glared at me with a mean look and I was very frightened and didn't know what to do. I turned around and the crowd came toward me. They moved closer and closer. Somebody started yelling, "Drag her over this tree! Let's take care of that nigger!"&lt;ref&gt;Kasher, Steven. The Civil Rights Movement: A Photographic History, 1954-68. New York: Abbeville Press, 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For the next two weeks, the Little Rock Nine stayed home to study instead of going to the Little Rock Central High School. President Dwight D. Eisenhower was reluctant to do anything about the mob or the rioting. Eisenhower summoned Orval Faubus, the Governor of Arkansas to intervene and asked for the withdrawal of all troops from the High School after Elizabeth Eckford's experience attempting to enter the school the first time.

On September 23, 1957, the Little Rock Nine approached Central High again, and Elizabeth Eckford along with the other eight students, accompanied by city policemen, were let into the high school through a side door. The reaction from the mob was described as follows:
 
{{quote|The crowd let out a roar of rage. "They've gone in," a man shouted...Once the Little Rock Nine entered the school, they were separated. The mob infiltrated the school, and under threats of death, the nine were taken to the principal's office. One of the nine overheard officials saying "We may have to let the mob have one of those kids, so's we can distract them long enough to get the others out."&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture. "Elizabeth Ann Eckford (1941-)." encyclopediaofarkansas.net. National Park Service: Central High School National Historic Site. Web. 15 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Even though Elizabeth Eckford would one day be known as a member of the Little Rock Nine, at this point in the school day, she was all alone, making her the first African-American student to integrate a white southern high school.&lt;ref name= "Margolick p. "/&gt;

The [[Arkansas National Guard]], under orders from the governor, and an angry mob of about 400 surrounded the school and prevented them from going in. On September 23, 1957, a mob of about 1000 people surrounded the school again as the students attempted to enter. The following day, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] took control of the Arkansas National Guard from the governor and sent soldiers to accompany the students to school for protection. Soldiers were deployed at the school for the entirety of the school year, although they were unable to prevent incidents of violence against the group inside, such as Eckford being thrown down a flight of stairs.&lt;ref name= "Historyp. "/&gt;

All of the city's high schools were closed the following year, so Eckford did not graduate from Central High School. However, she had taken correspondence and night courses garnering enough credits for her high school diploma.&lt;ref name= "encyclopediaofarkansasp. "/&gt; In 1958, Eckford and the rest of the Little Rock Nine were awarded the [[Spingarn Medal]] by the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), as was Ms. Bates.

==Later life==

Eckford was accepted by [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]] in [[Illinois]], but chose to return to Little Rock to be near her family. She later attended [[Central State University]] in [[Wilberforce, Ohio]], where she earned a BA in history. In 2018, Eckford was awarded an honorary doctorate from Knox College.

Eckford served in the [[United States Army]] for five years, first as a pay clerk, and then as an information specialist. She also wrote for the [[Fort McClellan]] ([[Alabama]]) and the [[Fort Benjamin Harrison]] ([[Indiana]]) newspapers. After that, she has worked as a waitress, history teacher, welfare worker, unemployment and employment interviewer, and a military reporter. She is a [[probation officer]] in Little Rock.&lt;ref name= "America.gov p. "&gt;{{harvnb|America.gov|2007|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, she shared the Father Joseph Biltz Award—presented by the [[National Conference for Community and Justice]]—with [[Hazel Massery|Hazel Bryan Massery]], a then-segregationist student at Central High School who appeared in several of the 1957 photographs screaming at the young Elizabeth. During the reconciliation rally of 1997, the two women made speeches together.&lt;ref name= "Masur p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Masur|2011|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But later their friendship broke up, with Eckford reflecting, "[Hazel] wanted me to be cured and be over it and for this not to go on anymore. She wanted me to be less uncomfortable so that she wouldn't feel responsible."&lt;ref name="Margolick p." /&gt; In 1999, President [[Bill Clinton]] presented the nation's highest civilian award, the [[Congressional Gold Medal]], to the members of the Little Rock Nine.

On the morning of January 1, 2003, one of Eckford's two sons, Erin Eckford, age 26, was shot and killed by police in Little Rock.&lt;ref name= "AP p. "&gt;{{harvnb|AP|2003|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]]'' reported that the police officers had unsuccessfully tried to disarm him with a beanbag round after he had fired several shots from his rifle. When Eckford pointed his rifle towards them, the police officers shot him. His mother feared that his death was "[[suicide by police]]". Erin, she said, had suffered from [[mental illness]] but had been off his prescribed medication for several years. The newspaper later reported that prosecutors investigating the fatal shooting had decided that the police officers concerned were justified in shooting Eckford.

==Media portrayals==
In 1993, actress Lisa Marie Russell portrayed Eckford in the [[Disney Channel]] movie ''[[The Ernest Green Story]]''.

'''''Finn's Hotel''''' is a posthumously-published collection of ten short narrative pieces written by Irish author [[James Joyce]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/14/james-joyce-collection-published James Joyce's 'last undiscovered' collection to be published | Books | theguardian.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Written in 1923, the works were not published until 2013 by [[Ithys Press]], who claimed the work to be a precursor to Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.&lt;ref name=ithyspress&gt;[http://ithyspress.wordpress.com/2013/06/14/finns-hotel-by-james-joyce-first-edition-just-published/ "''Finn's Hotel'' by James Joyce"], ''Ithys Press''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
Ithys Press published their fine arts edition of ''Finn's Hotel'' in June 2013.&lt;ref name=ithyspress /&gt; The edition was arranged with a preface by Danis Rose, an introduction by [[Seamus Deane]], featuring eleven illustrations by [[Casey Sorrow]], and design and letterpress printed by Michael Caine.

The publication attracted controversy as some Joyce scholars labeled the works as drafts, not meant for publication.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/01/09/specials/joyce-lost.html A Lost Work by Joyce Fuels Scholarly Debate&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2013/06/ithys-press-to-release-10-lost-james-joyce-works.html Ithys Press to Release 10 Lost James Joyce Works as Finn's Hotel :: Books :: News :: Paste&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbook.com/literature-nerds-freaking-out-about-lost-james-joyce-collection/ Literature Nerds Freaking Out About ‘Lost’ James Joyce Collection | BlackBook&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the spring of 2014, James O'Sullivan wrote an article for Genetic Joyce Studies, “Finn’s Hotel and the Joycean Canon”, which uses computational stylistics to analyze the text of ''Finn's Hotel'' to determine whether the text is merely early drafts or should be part of Joyce's canon.  O'Sullivan concluded that "the fragments within ''Finn’s Hotel'' are most likely drafts for what became ''Finnegans Wake''" and that statistically "the criticisms of Ithys Press are seemingly upheld."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Sullivan|first1=James|title=Using stylometry to weigh in on the Finn’s Hotel debate|url=http://josullivan.org/using-stylometry-to-weigh-in-on-the-finns-hotel-debate/|website=http://josullivan.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fath Ali Shah Qajar Firman in Shikasta Nastaliq script January 1831.jpg|thumb|A [[Fat'h Ali Shah Qajar]] ''firman'' in [[Shikasta Nastaʿlīq]] script, January 1831]]
A '''firman''' ({{lang-fa|{{nq|فرمان}}}} ''farmân''), or '''ferman''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=firman | url=http://www.seslisozluk.com/?word=firman | publisher=Seslisozluk | date=1999–2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the constitutional level, was a royal mandate or decree issued by a sovereign in an [[Islamic state]], namely the [[Ottoman Empire]]. During various periods they were collected and applied as traditional bodies of law. The word firman comes from  Persian {{lang|fa|{{nq|فرمان}}}} meaning "decree" or "order".

On a more practical level, a firman was, and may still be, any written permission granted by the appropriate Islamic official at any level of government. Westerners are perhaps most familiar with the permission to travel in a country, which typically could be purchased beforehand, or the permission to conduct scholarly investigation in the country, such as archaeological excavation. Firmans may or may not be combined with various sorts of passports.

== Origins of firmans in the Ottoman Empire ==
In the Ottoman Empire, the Sultan derived his authority from his role as upholder of the Shar'ia, but the Shar'ia did not cover all aspects of Ottoman social and political life. Therefore, in order to regulate relations and status, duties and dress of aristocracy and subjects, the Sultan created firmans.&lt;ref name=Lapidus&gt;Ira M. Lapidus, ''A History of Islamic Societies'', 2nd ed. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2002, pp. 260-261&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
[[Image:StMaryOfTheMongols20071010 02.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Firmans of [[Mehmed II]] and [[Bayazid II]] – kept at the [[Church of Saint Mary of the Mongols (Istanbul)|Church of Saint Mary of the Mongols]] in [[Istanbul]] – which granted the ownership of the building to the Greek community]]
Firmans were gathered in codes called "''[[Qanun (law)|kanun]]''" (from the [[Greek language|Hellenic]] word ''kanon'' (κανών) meaning ''rule'' or ''rules'', as well as the [[Arabic]] word ''qanun'' ({{lang|ar|قانون}}) also meaning ''rule'' or ''law''). The ''kanun'' were "a form of secular and administrative law considered to be a valid extension of religious law as a result of the ruler's right to exercise legal judgement on behalf of the community."&lt;ref name=Lapidus/&gt;

When issued by the sultan in the Ottoman Empire, firmans' importance was often displayed by the layout of the document; the more blank space at the top of the document, the more important the firman was.

== Examples of Ottoman firmans ==

=== Firman of Sultan Murad (26 October – 23 November 1386) ===
In this firman, Sultan Murad I recognises a decree created by his father Sultan Orhan (ca. 1324-60).  He gives the monks all they owned during his father's reign, ordering that no one can oppress them or claim their land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gr/2/21/218/218dn/e218dn00.html "Firman of Sultan Murad I," Ottoman Documents, Hellenic Ministry of Culture, 11 Mar 2007]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212014219/http://www.culture.gr/2/21/218/218dn/e218dn00.html |date=12 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Firman of Sultan Mehmed IV (1648–1687) ===
In this firman, the monks of [[Mount Athos]] report that the administrative officials charged with the collection of taxes come at a later date than they are supposed to and demand more money than the value assessed. They also make illegal demands for additional food supplies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gr/2/21/218/218dn/e218dn00.html "Firman of Sultan Mehmed IV," Ottoman Documents, Hellenic Ministry of Culture, 11 Mar. 2007]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212014219/http://www.culture.gr/2/21/218/218dn/e218dn00.html |date=12 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other firmans ==

One of the most important firmans governing relations between Muslims and Christians is a document kept at the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] on the [[Sinai Peninsula]] in Egypt. This monastery is [[Greek Orthodox]] and constitutes the autonomous Sinai Orthodox Church. The firman bears the hand print of [[Muhammad]], and requests the Muslims do not destroy the monastery for God-fearing men live there. To this day there is a protected zone around the monastery administered by the Egyptian government, and there are very good relations between the 20 or so monks, mainly from Greece, and the local community there.

Firmans were issued in some Islamic empires and kingdoms in [[India]] such as the [[Mughal Empire]] and the [[State of Hyderabad]].

== Other uses ==
The term "firman" was used by the [[archeologist]]/[[novelist]] [[Barbara Mertz|Elizabeth Peters]] for official permission from the Egyptian Department of Antiquities to carry on an excavation. A similar authority was cited by [[Austen Henry Layard]] for excavations at [[Nimrud]] which he mistakenly believed was [[Nineveh]].&lt;ref&gt;Layard A. H.'' [https://books.google.com/books?as_brr=1&amp;id=llVFb6qLmsgC&amp;dq=greek+pottery&amp;q=Cimmerian#v=onepage&amp;q=firman&amp;f=false Nineveh and Its Remains]'' Vol. II p.3 at Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''French Academy in Rome''' ({{lang-fr|Académie de France à Rome}}) is an Academy located in the [[Villa Medici]], within the [[Villa Borghese gardens|Villa Borghese]], on the [[Pincio]] (Pincian Hill) in [[Rome]], [[Italy]].

==History==
The Academy was founded at the [[Palazzo Capranica]] in 1666 by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] under the direction of [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], [[Charles Le Brun]] and [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]. The Academy was from the 17th to 19th centuries the culmination of study for select French artists who, having won the prestigious [[Prix de Rome]] (Rome Prize), were honored with a 3, 4 or 5-year scholarship (depending on the art discipline they followed) in the Eternal City for the purpose of the study of art and architecture.  Such scholars were and are known as ''pensionnaires de l'Académie'' (Academy pensioners). One recipient of the scholarship in the 17th century was [[Pierre Le Gros the Younger]].

The Academy was housed in the Palazzo Capranica until 1737, and then in the [[Palazzo Mancini]] from 1737 to 1793. In 1803 [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] moved it to the Villa Medici, with the intention of perpetuating an institution once threatened by the [[French Revolution]] and, thus, of retaining for young French artists the opportunity to see and copy the masterpieces of the Antiquity or the Renaissance and send back to Paris their "envois de Rome", the results of  the inspiration they had gained in Rome. These "envois" were annual works, sent to Paris to be judged, and were a compulsory requirement for all the pensionaries.

[[File:Portrait of Merry-Joseph Blondel.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Prix de Rome winner and fellow student [[Merry-Joseph Blondel]] in front of the Villa Medici in 1809, by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]]]
At first, the villa and its gardens were in a sad state and had to be renovated to house the winners of the Prix de Rome. The competition was interrupted during the first World War, and Mussolini confiscated the villa in 1941, forcing the academy of France in Rome to withdraw to [[Nice]] then to [[Fontainebleau]] until 1945. The competition and Prix de Rome were eliminated in 1968 by [[André Malraux]] (the last Grand Prix for architecture came to an end as early as 1967, the events of 1968 preventing its continuation).&lt;ref&gt;Malraux had already once envisioned, unsuccessfully, the suppression of the Prix de Rome competition in 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris and the [[Institut de France]] then lost their guardianship of the Villa Medici to the Ministry of the Culture and the State.&lt;ref&gt;The Institut de France reacted against this as early as 1975, while organizing each year the competition for the Académie des Beaux-Arts's Grand Prix of Architecture that still exists today.&lt;/ref&gt; From that time on, the boarders no longer belonged solely to the traditional disciplines (painting, sculpture, architecture, medal-engraving, precious-stone engraving, musical composition) but also to new or previously neglected artistic fields (art history, archaeology, literature, stagecraft, photography, movies, video, [[Art conservation and restoration|restoration]], [[writing]] and even cookery). These artists-in-residence are known as ''pensionnaires.'' The French word ‘pension’ refers to the room &amp; board these, generally young and promising, artists receive. The artists are no longer recruited by a competition but by application, and their stays vary from six to eighteen months and even, more rarely, two years.

Between 1961 and 1967, the artist [[Balthus]], then at the head of the Academy, carried out a vast restoration campaign of the palace and its gardens, providing them with modern equipment. Balthus participated "hands on" in all the phases of the construction. Where the historic décor had disappeared, Balthus proposed personal alternatives. He invented a décor that was a homage to the past and, at the same time,  radically contemporary: The mysterious melancholic decor he created for Villa Medici has become, in turn, historic and was undergoing an important restoration campaign in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villamedici.it/en/villa-medici/history/from-1803-to-today/|title=Villa medici|website=www.villamedici.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work continued under the direction of director, [[Richard Peduzzi]], and the Villa Medici resumed organizing exhibitions and shows created by its artists in residence.

Under director [[Frédéric Mitterrand]] the Academy opened up its guest rooms to the general public at times when they are not used by pensionnaires or other official guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minorsights.com/2016/07/italy-villa-medici.html|title=Italy: The Villa Medici B&amp;B- the poshest Bed &amp; Breakfast in Rome|website=www.minorsights.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Impression, Sunrise''''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Impression, soleil levant'') is a painting by [[Claude Monet]] first shown at what would become known as the "Exhibition of the Impressionists" in Paris in April, 1874. The painting is credited with inspiring the name of the [[Impressionism|Impressionist movement]]. 

''Impression, Sunrise'' depicts the port of [[Le Havre]], Monet's hometown. It is now displayed at the [[Musée Marmottan Monet]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marmottan.fr/uk/Claude_Monet_-musee-2517 ''Impression, Sunrise'', Musée Marmottan Monet]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Atelier Nadar 35BoulevardDesCapucines 1860 Nadar.jpg|thumbnail|left|The home of photographer [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]], where the 1874 exhibition took place]][[File:Sémaphore et grues sur le port du Havre.jpg|thumbnail|right|Modern view of the port of Le Havre]]
Monet visited his hometown of [[Le Havre]] in the Northwest of France in 1872 and proceeded to create a series of works depicting the port of Le Havre. The six painted canvases depict the port "during dawn, day, dusk, and dark and from varying viewpoints, some from the water itself and others from a hotel room looking down over the port".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brettell|first1=Richard R.|title=Impression : painting quickly in France 1860-1890|date=2000|publisher=Yale Univ. Press [u.a.]|location=New Haven [u.a.]|isbn=0300084463|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Impression, Sunrise'' became the most famous in the series after being debuted in April 1874 in Paris at an exhibition by the group "Painters, Sculptors, Engravers etc. Inc."&lt;ref name="H.N. Abrams"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Paul|title=Impressionism : beneath the surface|date=1994|publisher=H.N. Abrams|location=New York|isbn=0-81092715-2|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among thirty participants, the exhibition was led by [[Monet]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], and [[Alfred Sisley]], and showed over two hundred works that were seen by about 4,000 people, including some rather unsympathetic critics.&lt;ref name="Tomlinson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tomlinson|first1=edited by Janis|title=Readings in nineteenth-century art|date=1995|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=0-13-104142-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 the painting was stolen from the [[Musée Marmottan Monet]] by Philippe Jamin and Youssef Khimoun. It was recovered and returned to the museum in 1990,&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=The World's Greatest Art Heists|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/02/12/art-theft-museums-biz-cx_af_0212artheists.html|accessdate=16 November 2010|magazine=[[Forbes]]|date=12 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and put back on display in 1991.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Travel Advisory - Stolen Paintings Back in Paris Heists|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/28/travel/travel-advisory-stolen-paintings-back-in-paris.html|accessdate=16 November 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=28 April 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Impression'' and Impressionism==
[[File:Exposition1874affiche.jpg|thumbnail|right|Catalogue for the 1874 Impressionist Exhibition ]]
Monet claimed that he titled the painting ''Impression, Sunrise'' due to his hazy painting style in his depiction of the subject: "They asked me for a title for the catalogue, it couldn't really be taken for a view of Le Havre, and I said: 'Put ''Impression''.'"  In addition to this explanation for the title of the work, art historian Paul Smith claims that Monet might have named the painting ''Impression'' to excuse his painting from accusations of being unfinished or lacking descriptive detail, but Monet received these criticisms regardless of the title.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Paul|title=Impressionism : beneath the surface|date=1994|publisher=H.N. Abrams|location=New York|isbn=0-81092715-2|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the title of the painting seemed to be chosen in haste for the catalogue, the term "Impressionism" was not new. It had been used for some time to describe the effect of paintings from the [[Barbizon school]]. Both associated with the school, [[Charles-François Daubigny|Daubigny]] and [[Manet]] had been known to use the term to describe their own works.&lt;ref name="The impressionists"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Michael|title=The impressionists|date=1983|publisher=Chartwell Books|location=Secaucus, N.J.|isbn=0-7148-2230-2|page=124|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In critic [[Louis Leroy]]'s review of the 1874 exhibition, "The Exhibition of the Impressionists" for the newspaper ''[[Le Charivari]]'', he used "Impressionism" to describe the new style of work displayed, which he said was typified by Monet’s painting of the same name.

Before the 1860s and the debut of ''Impression, Sunrise'', the term "impressionism" was originally used to describe the effect of a natural scene on a painter, and the effect of a painting on the viewer. By the 1860s, "impression" was used by transference to describe a painting which relayed such an effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hopkin|first1=John House ; with an essay by David|title=Impressionists by the sea|date=2007|publisher=Royal Academy of Arts|location=London|isbn=978-1-903973-88-2|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, impression came to describe the movement as a whole.

Initially used to describe and deprecate a movement, the term Impressionism "was immediately taken up by all parties" to describe the style,&lt;ref name="The impressionists"/&gt; and Monet’s ''Impression, Sunrise'' considered to encapsulate the start of the movement and its name.

==Subject and interpretation==
[[File:Claude Monet, Impression, soleil levant.jpg|frameless|left]]
''Impression, Sunrise'' depicts the port of Le Havre at sunrise, the two small rowboats in the foreground and the red sun being the focal elements. In the middle ground, more fishing boats are included, while in the background on the left side of the painting are clipper ships with tall masts. Behind them are other misty shapes that "are not trees but smoke stacks of packboats and steamships, while on the right in the distance are other masts and chimneys silhouetted against the sky."&lt;ref name="Tomlinson" /&gt; In order to show these features of industry, Monet eliminated existing houses on the left side of the jetty, leaving the background unobscured.

Following the defeat of France in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–71, the regeneration of France was exemplified in the thriving port of Le Havre.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Art historian Paul Tucker suggests that the contrast of elements like the steamboats and cranes in the background to the fishermen in the foreground represent these political implications: "Monet may have seen this painting of a highly commercial site as an answer to the postwar calls for patriotic action and an art that could lead. For while it is a poem of light and atmosphere, the painting can also be seen as an ode to the power and beauty of a revitalized France."&lt;ref name="Tomlinson" /&gt;

The representation of Le Havre, hometown of Monet and a center of industry and commerce, celebrates the "renewed strength and beauty of the country... Monet’s ultimate utopian statement."  Art demonstrating France’s revitalization, Monet’s depiction of Le Havre’s sunrise mirrors the renewal of France.&lt;ref name="Tomlinson" /&gt;

==Style==
The hazy scene of ''Impression, Sunrise'' strayed from traditional landscape painting and classic, idealized beauty. Paul Smith suggested that with this style, Monet meant to express "other beliefs about artistic quality which might be tied to the ideologies being consolidated by the emergent bourgeoisie from which he came."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Paul|title=Impressionism : beneath the surface|date=1994|publisher=H.N. Abrams|location=New York|isbn=0-81092715-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loose brush strokes meant to suggest the scene rather than to [[Mimesis|mimetically]] represent it demonstrate the emergent Impressionist movement. In the wake of an emergent industrialization in France, this style expressed innovative individuality. Considering this, Smith claims that "Impression, Sunrise was about Monet’s search for spontaneous expression, but was guided by definite and historically specific ideas about what spontaneous expression was."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Colour===
The group of studies made from Monet’s hotel room were made from canvas with a base layer of gray in different tones. The layered effect provides depth in spite of imprecise details, creating a rich and tangible environment that seems like Le Havre, though not an exact likeness. Gordon and Forge discuss boundaries and the use of color in ''Impression, Sunrise'', claiming that
sky and water in ''Impression, Sunrise'' are hardly distinguishable, boundaries between objects are not obvious, and the paint "becomes the place" and effect, the colors of the paint melding together in "its glooming, opalescent oneness, its foggy blankness, its featureless, expectant emptiness that resembles, for the painter, an empty, uninflected canvas." They comment that the accents of blue-gray and orange cutting through the haze "are like last-minute revelations that had to wait, not only for the particular glimmer of orange to burn its way through the fog and find its reflective path onto the water and Monet’s eye but for the canvas itself, pregnant with the foggy space outside, to be ready to receive it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=Robert|last2=Forge|first2=Andrew|title=Monet|date=1983|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|isbn=0-8109-1312-7|edition=3. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Luminance===
[[Image:Claude Monet, Impression, soleil levant, 1872 BW.jpg|thumb|Desaturated version of the painting: the sun is virtually invisible.&lt;ref name=dalto/&gt;]]
Although it may seem that the sun is the brightest spot on the canvas, it is in fact, when measured with a photometer, the same brightness (or [[luminance]]) as the sky.&lt;ref name=dalto&gt;D'Alto, Aaron. [http://www.britannica.com/bps/additionalcontent/18/27926177/The-Monet-Effect "Odyssey"], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', December 2007. Retrieved 17 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Livingstone|Dr. Margaret Livingstone]], a professor of [[Neuroscience|neurobiology]] at [[Harvard University]], said "If you make a black and white copy of ''Impression: Sunrise'', the Sun disappears [almost] entirely."&lt;ref name=dalto/&gt;

Livingstone said that this caused the painting to have a very realistic quality, as the older part of the visual cortex in the brain&amp;nbsp;— shared with the majority of other mammals&amp;nbsp;— registers only luminance and not colour, so that the sun in the painting would be invisible to it, while it is just the newer part of the [[visual cortex]]&amp;nbsp;— only found in humans and other [[primate]]s&amp;nbsp;— which perceives colour.&lt;ref name=dalto/&gt;

==Criticism==
Most critics did not think ''Impression, Sunrise'' was one of the most notable pieces; it was briefly discussed only five times in all the reviews of the exhibition.&lt;ref name="Tomlinson" /&gt; However, the reviews of the exhibition and of Monet's painting both provide insight into the development of the movement and Monet's work and development as an artist.

Philippe Burty for ''La République Française'' wrote about the opening of the show, complementing the ambiance of the space and the paintings working together: "The walls of the rooms, covered in brownish red woolen fabric, are extremely well suited to paintings. The daylight enters the rooms from the sides, as it does in apartments."&lt;ref name="Stuckey"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stuckey|first1=edited by Charles F.|title=Monet : a retrospective|date=1985|publisher=Hugh Lauter Levin Associates|location=New York|isbn=0-88363-385-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this idyllic perspective of the exhibition was not the view of all critics. [[Louis Leroy]], for ''[[Le Charivari]]'', is often quoted in his review on Monet's work. His article "The Impressionist Exhibition" is written as a dialogue from the imaginary perspective of an old-fashioned painter, shocked at the works of Monet and his associates:

"'Ah! This is it, this is it!: he cried in front of n. 98. 'This one is Papa Vincent's favorite! What is this a painting of? Look in the catalogue.' 
'''Impression, Sunrise''.' 
'Impression-- I knew it. I was just saying to myself, if I'm impressed, there must be an impression in there… And what freedom, what ease in the brushwork! Wallpaper in its embryonic state is more labored than this seascape!"&lt;ref name="Stuckey" /&gt;

Leroy's review is a covert backhand at the progressiveness of ''Impression, Sunrise'', and is often attributed with the using the term impressionism for the first time.

[[Jules Castagnary]] for ''[[Le Siècle]]'' wrote that the group of painters could be described by no other word beside the new term ''impressionists'', since they rendered the "sensation evoked by the landscape" rather than the landscape. He claimed that "The very word has entered their language: not landscape, but impression, in the title given in the catalog for M. Monet's Sunrise. From this point of view, they have left reality behind for a realm of pure idealism",  typified by Monet's ''Impression, Sunrise''.&lt;ref name="Stuckey" /&gt;

[[Théodore Duret]] wrote that rendering idealized impressions instead of landscapes is what epitomises Monet's work and the impressionist movement. Considering ''Impression, Sunrise'' and Monet's work following the 1874 exhibition, Duret wrote "it is certainly the peculiar qualities of Claude Monet's paintings which first suggested [the term impressionism]". Claiming that "Monet is the Impressionist painter par excellence", Duret argued that Monet inspired a new way of seeing and painting, that Monet was "no longer painting merely the immobile and permanent aspect of a landscape, but also the fleeting appearances which the accidents of atmosphere present to him, Monet transmits a singularly lively and striking sensation of the observed scene."&lt;ref name="H.N. Abrams"/&gt;

==Monet after ''Impression''==
In an interview with Maurice Guillemot for ''La Revue Illustrée'', Monet reflected on his handling of landscape like the port of Le Havre in consideration of the movement and the 1874 exhibition: "A landscape is only an impression, instantaneous, hence the label they’ve given us-- all because of me, for that matter. I’d submitted something done out of my window at Le Havre, sunlight in the mist with a few masts in the foreground jutting up from the ships below. They wanted a title for the catalog; it couldn’t really pass as a view of Le Havre, so I answered: "Put down ''Impression''." Out of that they got impressionism, and the jokes proliferated...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stuckey|first1=edited by Charles F.|title=Monet : a retrospective|date=1985|publisher=Hugh Lauter Levin Associates|location=New York|isbn=0-88363-385-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:'Garden at Bordighera, Impression of Morning' by Claude Monet, 1884, Hermitage.JPG|thumb|[[Claude Monet]], ''Garden in Bordighera, Impression of Morning'', 1884, [[Hermitage Museum]]]]
Following 1874 and the rise of the Impressionist movement, Monet recalled ''Impression, Sunrise'' by naming other works with similar titles. The subtitles recalled ''Impression, Sunrise'' in style and influence, though their subjects varied. Examples of similarly titles works are ''Effet de brouillard, impression'' in 1879, ''L’Impression'' in 1883, ''Garden at Bordighera, Impression of Morning'' in 1884, ''Marine (impression)'' in 1887, and ''Fumées dans le brouillard, impression'' in 1904. These works then seemed as a continuation of his Le Havre scene, "one of the sequence of canvases in which he was seeking to capture the most fleeting natural effects, as a display of his painterly virtuosity."&lt;ref name="Impressionists by the sea"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hopkin|first1=John House ; with an essay by David|title=Impressionists by the sea|date=2007|publisher=Royal Academy of Arts|location=London|isbn=978-1-903973-88-2|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evoking the name of ''Impression, Sunrise'', but also providing stylistic connections, the later paintings are similarly "quite summary and economical in handling, and depict particularly hazy or misty effects" that is characteristic of Monet’s impressionism in particular.&lt;ref name="Impressionists by the sea"/&gt;

While the movement and the painting initially garnered controversy, Monet’s ''Impression, Sunrise'' gave rise to the name and recognition of the [[Impressionist]] movement, arguably exemplifying more than any other work or artist the [[Impressionist]] movement as a whole in style, subject, and influence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The '''International Child Art Foundation''' is a nonprofit organization founded in 1997. Head office is in Washington, D.C. They enhance academic performance and instill global citizenship by nurturing children's creativity and developing their empathy, which are key attributes of 21st century learners and leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icaf.org/about/ |title=About Us |website=International Child Art Foundation |accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Children's Festival they host on every 4 years and is the world's largest international children's celebration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dc.about.com/od/specialevents/a/WorldChildFest.htm World Childrens Festival in Washington, DC]. About.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Inspired by [[E. Paul Torrance]]'s longitudinal and cross-cultural studies of the "4th Grade Slump", Dr. Ashfaq Ishaq created the ICAF to help children overcome this slump. The ICAF became the first national arts organization for American children and the first international arts organization for the world's children.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Ask the Expert: Q&amp;A with Ashfaq M. Ishaq]]". ''CyberTherapy &amp; Rehabilitation''. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1999 the ICAF has produced the [[Arts Olympiad#World Children's Festival|World Children's Festival]] every four years on The National Mall in Washington, D.C. to honor the Arts Olympiad winners at an event of children's co-learning and co-creation.&lt;ref name=impacts&gt;[http://www.icaf.org/impact/ "Impacts"]. International Child Art Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts Olympiad==
{{Main|Arts Olympiad}}
The ICAF's flagship program is the '''Arts Olympiad.''' This art and sport program for children ages 8 to 12 is the most prestigious and largest in the world. The Arts Olympiad winners represent their cities at the '''World Children's Festival''' at the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref&gt;"[[The 5th Arts Olympiad]]". ''The Visual Art Beat.'' Salzburg, Austria April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The deadline for the 5th Arts Olympiad is May 15, 2014.  The next World Children's Festival will be held in June 2015.

==Peace Through Art Programs==
The '''Peace Through Art Programs '''tap into the creativity of children so they can visualize with the importance of peace and co-existence. Their goal is to reduce the transmission of trauma and hatred from the current generation to the future one. The program develops empathy through art and imparts leadership skills so children can co-create a peaceful future for their communities. The program also aims to repair trust in humanity of children living in conflict zones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icaf.org/pdfs/Lancet-Dec2006-Ishaq%20-%20Childrens-Creativity-to-Foster-Peace.pdf "Development of Children's Creativity to Foster Peace"]. ''The Lancelet.'' Vol. 368, December 2006

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Healing Arts Programs==
The '''Healing Arts Programs''' was started in response to the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Asian tsunami of December 2004]]. The organization wanted to transfer the knowledge and experience gained from the treatment of the child survivors of the 9/11 attacks to help the tsunami child survivors. The''' Tsunami Healing Arts Program''' was extended to the [[U.S. Gulf Coast]] as '''Katrina Healing Arts Program''' after [[Hurricane Katrina|Hur]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;r[[hurricane Katrina|&lt;nowiki/&gt;]][[Hurricane Katrina|icane Katrina.]]The ICAF partnered with the [[World Bank]] Arts Program in 2005 on its "Destruction, Reconstruction and Prevention" program to broaden the understanding of natural disasters in the international development community.&lt;ref&gt;Hardman, Shirley. [http://www.icaf.org/pdfs/Katrina%20Healing%20Arts%20Program%20-%20A%20Schoolteacher's%20Perspective.pdf "Katrina Healing Arts Program: A Schoolteacher’s Perspective"].

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accomplishments==
&lt;ref name=impacts/&gt;
* Approximately 5 million children in 80 countries have produced art under the ICAF programs.
* The ICAF has the distinction of having hosted the first national children's art festival in U.S. history, which took place in Washington D.C. in September 1998.
* The Congressional Arts Caucus has endorsed the Arts Olympiad for "its important national and international implications" while the [[U.S. Olympic Committee]] has granted the ICAF a license to use the "Arts Olympiad" mark.

'''Jonathan Crary''', is an [[art critic]] and [[essayist]], and is Meyer Schapiro Professor of Modern Art and Theory at [[Columbia University in New York]].  His first notable works were ''Techniques of the Observer: On Vision and Modernity in the 19th Century'' (1990), and ''Suspensions of Perception: Attention, Spectacle and Modern Culture'' (2000). He has published critical essays for over 30 [[Exhibition catalogue]]s, mostly on [[contemporary art]].  His style is often classified{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} as observational mixed with scientific, and a dominant theme in his work is the role of the human eye.

==Biography==
Crary attended high school at the [[The Putney School|Putney School]] in Vermont. He graduated from [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]] where he was an art history major. In 1987 he received his Ph.D from Columbia as well. Crary also earned a B.F.A. from the [[San Francisco Art Institute]], where he studied film and photography.

He first taught at the Visual Arts Department at [[University of California, San Diego]]. In 1989 he began teaching at Columbia.

==Writing==
His ''Suspensions of Perception'' focuses on the period from about 1880 to 1905, exploring the second half of the nineteenth century in which a new way of seeing was introduced. Crary describes this shift as an emergence of subjective vision. In addition, Crary discusses how Attention became a “new object within the modernization of [[subjectivity]]...”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crary|first=Jonathan|title=Suspensions of perception : attention, spectacle, and modern culture|year=2001|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts [u.a.]|isbn=0-262-53199-2|edition=1. MIT Press paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crary’s book examines how the perception of various cultures were reconstructed and uncertainties were argued. This new development of vision created [[controversy]] because it implied that seeing was dependent upon one’s subjective thoughts, which were based on what the observer saw. Therefore, this new way of seeing was thought of as unclear, unreliable, and always questioned among a large population of people. ''Suspensions of Perception'' published in 2000 was the winner of the 2001 Lionel Trilling Book Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/arthistory/faculty/Crary.html Meyer Schapiro Professor of Modern Art and Theory and Director of Art Humanities, Jonathan Crary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Crary's ''Techniques of the Observer'' gives a unique study on the origins of modern [[visual culture]]. ''Techniques of the Observer'' was published in 1990 and translated into nine foreign languages.

Crary has also written on present day “art  and culture for publications including [[Art in America]], [[Artforum]], [[October (journal)|October]], [[Assemblage (journal)|Assemblage]], [[Cahiers du cinéma|Cahiers du Cinema]], [[Film Comment]], [[Grey Room]], [[Domus (magazine)|Domus]] and [[Village Voice]].”{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Crary is also a critic and wrote critical essays for more than thirty exhibition catalogs. Crary has contributed to the Film Theory and Criticism anthology. eds Braudy &amp; Cohen 7th edition.

Crary was one of the founders of [http://www.zonebooks.org/ Zone Books] in 1986, which is a press known for publications in “History, art theory, politics, anthropology and philosophy".{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In addition, literature by [[Michel Foucault]], [[Giorgio Agamben]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], and others are included. Crary was co-editor of the 1992 volume ''Incorporations'' (Zone Books). Today Crary continues to be a co-editor of Zone Books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zone Books Homepage|url=http://www.zonebooks.org/index.html|website=Zonebooks.org|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albrecht Dürer - The Triumphal Chariot of Maximilian I (The Great Triumphal Car) (plate 1 of 8).jpg|thumb|right|The left-most of eight prints comprising the ''Large Triumphal Carriage'']]
The '''''Large Triumphal Carriage''''' or '''''Great Triumphal Car''''' (in German, ''Triumphwagen'') is a large 16th-century [[woodcut]] [[Old master print|print]] by [[Albrecht Dürer]], commissioned by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]. The work was originally intended to be the central part of a {{convert|54|m|ft}} long print of a ''[[Triumphal Procession]]'' or ''Triumph of Maximilian'', depicting Maximilian and his court entourage in a procession.

The work is one of three huge prints created for Maximilian, the other being a ''[[Triumphal Arch (woodcut)|Triumphal Arch]]'' (1512–15, 192 woodcut panels, {{convert|3.0|m|ft|0}} high and {{convert|3.7|m|ft}} wide) also designed by [[Albrecht Dürer]], and the ''[[Triumphal Procession]]'' (1516–18, 137 woodcut panels, {{convert|54|m|ft}} long). The monumental projects reflect Maximilian's position as Holy Roman Emperor, and link him to the [[triumphal arch]]es and [[Roman triumph|triumphs]] of [[Ancient Rome]]. Only the ''Triumphal Arch'' was completed before Maximilian's death in 1519, and distributed as Imperial [[propaganda]] as he intended.

The completed ''Large Triumphal Carriage'' is a composite image [[printing|printed]] from 8 separate [[Woodblock printing|wood blocks]] created by [[Willibald Pirckheimer]]. It measures approximately {{convert|0.46|m|ft|1}} high {{convert|2.4|m|ft|0}} long. Two blocks depict a large carriage or chariot in which Maximilian sits alone, holding a sceptre and a palm and wearing the imperial robes and the crown of the Holy Roman Empire and surrounded by the four [[cardinal virtues]] - Iustitia (justice), Fortitudo (fortitude), Prudentia (prudence) and Temperantia (temperance). The emperor sits under the crown held aloft by a [[Victory]], whose feathered wings bear the names of Maximilian's military campaigns: "Gallis" (France), "Ungaris" (Hungary), "Bohemis" (Bohemia), "Elvetiis" (Switzerland), "Germanis" (Germany) and "Venetis" (Venice). The other six plates each show a pair of horses with luxurious harnesses, pulling the carriage along. Many parts of the print are labelled to explain the complex iconography: the wheels are marked "Magnificentia" (magnificence), "Dignitas" (dignity), "Gloria" (glory) and "Honor" (honour); one rein is marked "Nobilitas" (nobility) and the other "Potentia" (power). The driver of the carriage is "Ratio" (reason). Each horse is attended by a female figure carrying a wreath: from rear to front, "Providentia" (providence) and "Moderatio" (moderation), "Alacritas" (quickness) and "Opportunitas" (opportunity), "Velocitas" (speed) and "Firmitudo" (firmness), "Acrimonia" (sharpness/keen-ness/vigor) and "Virilitas" (virility), "Audacia" (audacity) and "Magnanimitas" (magananiminty), and "Experientia" (experience) and "Solertia" (skill). The carriage is also attended by four female figures: "Gravitas" (gravity), "Perserverantia" (perseverance), "Fidentia" (fidelity) and "Securitas" (security). Lettering above explains the iconography, and the front pair of horses are accompanied by a text recording the commission from Maximilian to Pirckheimer dated Innsbruck, 1518.

Dürer's allegorical figures are based on prints of dancing nymphs by [[Andrea Mantegna]].

The work was originally intended to be the central part of the ''Triumph of Maximilian'', a work that was proposed in 1512, when Maximilian made his last visit to Nuremberg, and met Dürer. Dürer's first design drawings of 1512–13 are held by the [[Albertina]] in Vienna, and show a much smaller carriage. A watercolour of a second more elaborate scheme drawn in 1518 by Dürer with suggestions by [[Willibald Pirckheimer]] is also held by the Albertina. In the earlier works, Maximilian is accompanied in the carriage by members of his family, but they were omitted in the final print.

After Maximilian's death in 1519, and the ending of the annual pension of 100 florins paid to Dürer under Maximilian, Dürer published the prints of the completed carriage as a separate work in 1522, with text in German, dedicated to Maximilian and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. This may have been an attempt by Dürer to raise funds by selling the prints, or as a demonstration of his loyalty to encourage the restoration of his stipend. The remaining parts of the ''Triumphal Procession'', mostly designed by [[Hans Burgkmair]] from about 1512, were first published in 1526 on the orders of Archduke Ferdinand.

The original blocks were used to print seven editions of the print. The first edition was published in Nuremberg by Dürer himself, with explanatory text by Pirckheimer in German in 1522, with a second edition in Latin in 1523. A third and fourth edition in German and Latin was published in around 1559, and a fifth edition was published in Venice in 1589 by the German printer [[Jacubus Chinig]]. Examples of the fifth edition are held by the [[British Museum]] and the [[Library of Congress]]. A sixth and seventh edition were printed before 1601, by which time the woodblocks were becoming very worn. The original blocks are also held in the collection of the Albertina.

'''[[Latvia]]n pottery''' (''Latvijas podniecība'' or ''Latvijas keramika''), one of the country's oldest art forms, dates back to the [[Neolithic]]. '''Latgale pottery''' (''Latgales podniecība'') is the best-known subset of Latvian pottery. The eastern region of [[Latgale]] is the most prolific producer of wares.

As a rule, Latvian pottery is characterized by an absence of any painted-on patterns or designs, instead solid colors and gradients are used. Traditionally subdued, earthen hues (greens, browns, etc.) are used; however, artisans can be seen using brighter colors in their unique pieces. Mottled glaze and random artifacts (somewhat reminiscent of the Japanese [[Shino ware|Shino-yaki]]) are characteristic of Latvian pottery.

==Prehistoric period==
[[File:Narva-vessel.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Pottery of the Narva culture]]
[[File:European-middle-neolithic-en.svg|thumb|100px|Neolithic Europe, Pit–Comb Ware culture in purple]]
The Neolithic [[Pit–Comb Ware culture]] ({{sc|aka}} Comb Ceramic culture) that spanned the entire territory of modern-day Latvia derives its name from the pottery characteristic of the time – wares decorated with impressions of a comb-like object. [[Narva culture]] spanning the entire territory of modern-day [[Estonia]] and Latvia, as well as parts of [[Lithuania]] and Western [[Russia]], is a subset of the larger Pit–Comb Ware culture.

Pit–Comb Ware culture is usually thought to have used an early form of what are today known as the [[Uralic languages]], a competing view is that they may have been speakers of a [[Paleo-European languages|Paleo-European language]].&lt;ref&gt;James P. Mallory and Douglas Q. Adams, "Pit-Comb Ware Culture", in ''[[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture]]'',( Fitzroy Dearborn, 1997), pp. 429–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latgale pottery==
Some of the types of wares characteristic to Latgale pottery are ''vāraunieks'' (a pot for cooking), ''medaunieks'' (a pot for [[honey]] storage), ''sloinīks'' (a pot for storing [[fruit preserves]]), ''ķērne'' (a pot for storing [[sour cream]]), ''ļaks'' (a vessel for storage of oil), ''piena pods'' (a pot for storing cow's [[milk]]), ''kazelnieks'' (a pot for [[goat milk]] storage), ''pārosis'' (lit. "over-handle", a vessel for bringing food to the field), ''bļoda'' (bowl), ''krūze'' (a jug or a mug, most often for [[beer]] or milk).&lt;ref&gt;Pujāts, Jānis. Latgales keramika. Rēzekne:Latgales kultūras centra izdevniecība, 2002, pages 20-26&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Latgale pottery wares are not food-related, these include the ''svilpaunieks'' (a bird-shaped whistle toy), ''svečturis'' (candlestick) and decorative plates and possibly other items meeting more contemporary demands, for example, ashtrays.

{{main|The Hard Goodbye}}
[[File:Marvwendy.png|thumb|250px|right|[[Mickey Rourke]] as Marv and [[Jaime King]] as Wendy in a scene from ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'']]

First published as ''Sin City'' in ''[[Dark Horse Presents]]'' issues #51–62 and 5th Anniversary Special (June 1991–June 1992), and reprinted as ''Sin City (The Hard Goodbye)'' in trade paperback form (January 1993), '''''The Hard Goodbye''''' is the first [[comic book]] story that [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] drew and wrote about the desperate denizens of Basin City/"Sin City". The [[protagonist]] is Marv, a chivalrous yet dangerous and possibly [[psychotic]] ex-convict with a penchant for fine coats. Marv meets a mysterious and very beautiful woman at Kadie's bar. The woman seduces Marv much to his surprise and delight, since he doesn't usually attract women due to scars from his many years as a street fighter. Marv wakes up after a one-night stand to discover Goldie, the woman he had just met and had sex with, has been killed in the night. When he hears sirens of the police drawing near (long before anyone but he and the killer could know what had happened) he realizes that he is being framed by someone with a lot of money and influence in Basin City. The thirteen-part serial follows Marv on his single-minded quest to understand why Goldie was killed and bring [[revenge]] upon her murderers.

This story is one of three Sin City stories retold in the movie ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]''. In the film version, [[Mickey Rourke]] plays Marv, [[Jaime King]] plays Goldie and Wendy, [[Carla Gugino]] plays Lucille, [[Elijah Wood]] plays [[Kevin (Sin City)|Kevin]], and [[Rutger Hauer]] plays [[Roark family|Cardinal Roark]].

==''A Dame to Kill For''==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Frank Miller (comics)]] --&gt;

{{main|A Dame to Kill For}}
First published November 1993–May 1994, '''''A Dame to Kill For''''' is the second compilation of the ''[[Sin City]]'' series. It chronicles Dwight's attempts to rescue Ava Lord, his former fiancée, from her husband and servant, who she says are [[Sadism and Masochism|sadistically]] torturing her. Dwight begins to suspect that things aren't what they seem with Ava. [[File:A dame to kill for.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''[[Sin City]]: A Dame To Kill For'', 2nd edition]]

The story begins as [[Dwight McCarthy]], working as a photographer for a grossly overweight man named Agamemnon, saves one of the Old Town prostitutes from one of her customers, whom Dwight was investigating on behalf of his wife; he then drives her back to Old Town. That night, he receives a call from a woman named Ava, asking him to meet her at a seedy bar called Kadie's Club Pecos. Dwight is suspicious of her, as Ava broke his heart four years ago by running off with another richer man, but he agrees to meet her anyway. Marv is also there and greets Dwight. Ava arrives late (as she often used to) and tries to persuade Dwight to take her back, claiming that her life is "a living Hell"; Dwight refuses to listen. Just then, Manute, Ava's husband's valet, arrives and takes Ava away. Dwight goes home, but cannot sleep. He decides to check up on Ava and her new husband, Damien Lord.

He hops a fence and, using his photography equipment, scopes out the estate and, in particular, Ava, who is swimming in the nude. He is discovered and claims that he is simply a [[Voyeurism|Peeping Tom]]. Manute, who seemingly doesn't recognize him from the bar, beats him brutally before throwing him from a car into the street. Dwight calls Agamemnon for a ride home and they stop several times for fast food.

As Dwight arrives home, he finds his [[Ford Mustang]] returned and his door unlocked. In his bedroom is a nude Ava. Following a heated argument, they eventually reconcile and make love. Manute arrives and violently beats naked Dwight. Dwight is knocked out of his upper story apartment window to the street below, where he blacks out momentarily. He awakens to see Manute driving off with Ava.

Determined to rescue her, Dwight arrives at Kadie’s, where Marv is in the middle of a squabble with some out-of-town punks. One of them pulls a gun on Marv, who knocks him flat; the rest quickly scatter. Dwight convinces Marv, over several drinks and whilst watching [[Nancy Callahan|Nancy]] dance, to help him storm Damien's estate. As they approach the mansion, Dwight insists Marv leave the punk's gun, which Marv has procured, in the car. Marv tackles the guards as a distraction and eventually takes on Manute, ripping his right eye out and beating him savagely.

With Manute and the guards occupied, Dwight makes his way to Damien. When he finds him in his office, he beats him to death. As Dwight begins to realize what he has done, Ava appears, and explains how Dwight was all a part of her plan to get Damien murdered so she could inherit his estate. She shoots Dwight six times, including once in the head. Dwight once again falls out of a window and is picked up by Marv. Upon Dwight's insistence, Marv drives him to Old Town, where Dwight has his old flame, Gail, help him. The girls of Old Town perform surgery on Dwight's multiple bullet wounds, then ask him to leave. He convinces Gail and Miho, a deadly assassin he saved three years prior, to let him stay, and they operate further on him.

Two detectives following up on Damien Lord's death, Mort and Bob, talk to Ava. She claims that Dwight was a [[Stalking|stalker]] [[psychopath]] who killed Damien out of jealousy. They believe her story, and Mort starts sleeping with her. They interrogate Agamemnon, who tells how Dwight is an upright man who went clean after being a wild [[alcoholic]] with a short temper in his younger days. When they speak with Dwight's [[landlord|landlady]], she tells about letting Ava in and the resulting loud noises of the fight the night of Damien's murder. Bob doubts Ava considerably now, while Mort, who is still sleeping with her, becomes more on-edge towards his partner. This culminates with Mort killing Bob, then committing suicide. (On an unrelated note, during the scene in which Mort kills Bob, while they are driving in the car you can clearly see Wendy and Marv drive past them, presumably on their way to butcher [[Roark family|Kevin]].)

Meanwhile, Dwight is recovering from his near-fatal wounds and calls Ava to inform her he's coming for her soon. Ava, with her late husband's financial assets, is joining her corporation with the mob boss Wallenquist. Unaffected by Ava's flirting, he warns her not to underestimate him again and tells her to tie up her loose ends with Dwight; he has someone arriving from Phoenix soon to meet her about that.

Dwight (with his new face), accompanied by Gail and Miho, poses as Wallenquist's man from Phoenix. Inside Ava's estate, however, Manute sees past the new face and captures Dwight. Gail and Miho strike from Dwight's car, and Dwight shoots Manute with a hidden .25 he had up his left sleeve. Six bullets fail to kill him, and Manute aims shakily at Dwight as Ava grabs one of Manute's guns, shooting Manute in his shoulder. Manute falls through a window and, upon landing, is stabbed in the arms by Miho, pinning him to the ground. Ava then tries to get Dwight to kill him, telling him that Manute had her under mind control to manipulate her and Damien and that it would be a cruel irony if he killed her now. Dwight finally sees through all the lies and kills Ava.

==''The Babe Wore Red and Other Stories''==

First published November 1994, ''The Babe Wore Red and Other Stories'' is a publication of short stories:
* "And Behind Door Number Three..." (4 pages long)
* "The Customer Is Always Right" (3 pages long)
* "The Babe Wore Red" (23 pages long) It reprints a serial run in ''Previews''.

"And Behind Door Number Three..." is a short story about Gail and Wendy (who's now wearing Marv's necklace) setting a trap for a man they suspect is 'carving up' girls in Old Town.

The enigmatic "Cowboy" is captured by the allure of Wendy and subsequently shot and tied up by Gail. Although the Cowboy is willing to confess to the cops, the girls have other plans and invite Miho to finish the job.

"The Customer Is Always Right" served as the opening sequence for the film ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'', which featured [[Josh Hartnett]] and [[Marley Shelton]]. The sequence served as the original [[proof of concept]] footage that director [[Robert Rodriguez]] filmed to convince Frank Miller to allow him to adapt ''Sin City'' to the silver screen.

The story involves an enigmatic tryst between two nameless characters; "The Customer" and "The Salesman." They meet on the terrace of a high rise building, hinting that although they seem to be acting like strangers, they do indeed have some sort of past. It is unclear what their past involves even as they embrace in a passionate kiss.

A silenced gunshot stabs the night air to reveal that The Salesman has shot The Customer. The reader is led to believe that The Customer had fallen into a serious and difficult situation and, with no other feasible alternative, hired The Salesman to kill her. Later information given by Frank Miller on the commentary of the Recut &amp; Extended DVD Edition states that The Customer had an affair with a member of the mafia, and when she found out tried to break it off with him. The mafia member then swore to her that she would die in the most terrible way possible, and when it is least expected. The Customer, having connections, hires The Salesman (who is referred to as "The Lady-Killer") to kill her. In the comic The Salesman is the Colonel, as Miller has verified in the BLAM! section page 29 of the one-shot issue "Sex &amp; Violence."

"The Babe Wore Red" centers around the character of Dwight and the murder of his friend Fargo. Dwight stumbles upon the hanging corpse of Fargo in his apartment and encounters Mr Shlubb, half of the recurring supporting duo, Douglas Klump and Burt Shlubb (aka Fat Man and Little Boy).

He knocks out Shlubb and finds the titular character hiding in the shower. Under a barrage of sniper shots from Douglas Klump, Dwight and the Babe reach their car and speed off. Although they successfully elude the pair, Dwight refuses to let them off easy, choosing rather to head to The Farm to deal with them. In the meantime, the Babe introduces herself as a hooker named Mary, but Dwight can tell she's lying. He duels with both of them again and due to insistence from Mary decides to shoot them in the leg instead of killing them. He eventually receives a package from Fargo who had shipped it off before his untimely demise. Dwight reads up on the whole situation and realizes that Fargo was simply the scapegoat for illegal drug-related activities and had paid the ultimate price. He also receives a package from Mary. She was not a hooker, rather a nun that had flirted with temptation before ultimately deciding to dedicate her life to God.

The time frame for the story is given as during the time Marv spent on death row in "The Hard Goodbye", as noted when Dwight mentions that he had a friend on death row because of what happened at the Roark family farm.

==''The Big Fat Kill''==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Frank Miller (comics)]] --&gt;

[[File:bfk2.png|Cover to ''Sin City: The Big Fat Kill'' #2. Art by Frank Miller. The characters Dwight and Gail.|thumb]]
{{main|The Big Fat Kill}}

First published in five issues November 1994&amp;ndash;March 1995, '''''The Big Fat Kill''''' opens in Shellie's apartment, where a drunken former fling is furiously rapping on her door, demanding to be let in. Shellie is obviously scared, but is comforted by Dwight who has gotten a new face (see ''A Dame To Kill For''). Dwight tells the barmaid to let the man and his ensuing entourage in, expressing confidence in his ability to 'handle them'. When the man outside threatens to break down her door, Shellie reluctantly opens it while Dwight hides in the bathroom. Dwight deals with the man, who then leaves, heading into [[The Girls of Old Town|Old Town]]. The story deals with the repercussions of Dwight's and the Old Town Girls' actions towards him.

The story is one of three from Sin City related in the film ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]''. In the film, [[Clive Owen]] plays Dwight, [[Brittany Murphy]] plays Shellie, [[Benicio del Toro]] plays Jack, [[Rosario Dawson]] plays Gail, [[Devon Aoki]] plays Miho, [[Alexis Bledel]] plays Becky, and [[Michael Clarke Duncan]] plays Manute.

=="Silent Night"==

"Silent Night" is a one-shot short story that Frank Miller released in November 1995. It is a 26-page story featuring Marv. It has almost no dialogue; only one speech bubble appears in the entire story. The original issue had no functional cover, i.e. the story started on the top page, which had no title, author or publisher information. These were appended at the end of the issue.

Against a backdrop of heavy snow, Marv (a hulking, scarred figure in a trenchcoat) approaches a door in a dark alley. He intimidates the bouncer, Fatman, by simply glaring at him, and is let in. He proceeds down a flight of stairs, and is met by two men with machine pistols and a leather-clad woman, who is apparently their boss. Marv hands her a wad of bills and is shown to a steel door in the far wall. Through a small viewing slit, he can see a terrified little girl crouching in darkness in the room beyond. It is not stated, but is apparent that the child was being sold for sex. Marv draws two pistols and kills the pair of henchmen, then executes the woman, the only time he kills a woman in all of his Sin City appearances. He says to the little girl, "Your momma's been asking after you, Kimberly. Let's get you home." Cuddling the girl gently in his arms, he walks off into the distance, as the snow obscures his receding form.

==''That Yellow Bastard''==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Frank Miller (comics)]] --&gt;
{{main|That Yellow Bastard}}
[[File:Sin City - That Yellow Bastard (front cover).png|thumb|Cover to ''That Yellow Bastard'' #1. Art by Frank Miller. It shows a menacing-looking Detective Hartigan.]]
First published in February 1996&amp;ndash;July 1996, '''''That Yellow Bastard''''' is a six-issue [[comic book]] miniseries, and the sixth in the ''Sin City'' series. It follows the usual black and white noir style artistry of previous ''Sin City'' novels. The first collected edition by [[Dark Horse Comics]] became available in July 1997 ({{ISBN|1-56971-225-5}}).

The story begins more than eight years before any other ''Sin City'' book takes place, with possibly the most noble, and heroic [[protagonist]] in the ''Sin City'' universe, [[policeman]] [[John Hartigan]] (suffering from severe [[Angina pectoris|angina]] problems) on his final mission before his forced retirement. Roark Junior, son of one of the most powerful and [[Political corruption|corrupt]] officials in Basin City, is indulging his penchant for [[Child sexual abuse|raping]] and murdering [[puberty|pre-pubescent]] girls. It is Hartigan's mission to rescue Junior's latest quarry, a thin eleven-year-old named [[Nancy Callahan]]. Hartigan rescues her, but only after severely wounding Junior and sending him into a coma. Hartigan is then framed for kidnapping and raping Nancy, and sent to prison for eight years, until he manages to achieve parole and attempts to locate and protect Nancy from Roark's men.

In the film adaptation, [[Bruce Willis]] stars as Hartigan, [[Jessica Alba]] as Nancy, [[Nick Stahl]] as the Yellow Bastard/Junior, [[Powers Boothe]] as Senator Roark and [[Michael Madsen]] as Hartigan's partner, Bob. There are only a few notable differences in the film version: Mort is replaced by Bob when Hartigan is released from prison, an appearance by [[Carla Gugino]] as Lucille is omitted (but reinstated in the extended version released to DVD), and Senator Roark ([[Powers Boothe]]) has a mustache.

In the DVD commentary, Frank Miller indicated that he was initially motivated to write ''That Yellow Bastard'' after his disappointment with ''[[The Dead Pool]]'', the fifth and final film in the ''[[Dirty Harry (film series)|Dirty Harry]]'' series. Nancy—who prior to this story had no last name—was named "Callahan", a name shared with [[Clint Eastwood]]'s character.

=="Daddy's Little Girl"==

"Daddy's Little Girl" was first published in ''A Decade of Dark Horse'' #1 (July 1996) and reprinted in ''Tales to Offend'' #1 (July 1997), and ''Booze, Broads, and Bullets.''

Johnny is a middle-aged man who seems to be in love with a much younger girl by the name of Amy. Amy insists that they cannot be together and alludes to the solution that he kills her father. Torn by his emotions and manipulated by Amy, he attempts to confront her father first, asking for her hand in marriage. Daddy refuses and Johnny shoots him with a revolver that Amy gave him. Daddy then reveals that the gun was in fact loaded with [[blank (cartridge)|blank]]s and was a plot orchestrated by him and Amy. The two are either lovers with a daddy/daughter [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] based relationship or a father and daughter in an [[incest]]uous relationship. Daddy strangles Johnny for sexual satisfaction, and it implied this was the only way he was able to become aroused.

==''Lost, Lonely, &amp; Lethal''==

First published December 1996, ''Lost, Lonely &amp; Lethal'' contains three stories:
* "Fat Man and Little Boy" (3 pages) – first published in ''San Diego Comic Con Comics'' #4 (July 1996)
* "Blue Eyes" (14 pages)
* "Rats" (7 pages)

"Fat Man and Little Boy" is a short three-page story about Douglas Klump and Burt Shlubb, who also appear in ''That Yellow Bastard'' and ''Family Values''. These characters use a large vocabulary to make it appear that they are more intelligent than they truthfully are. However their wordy speeches are sprinkled with [[malapropism]]s. In this yarn, Shlubb's boots are in horrible shape, and he wishes to steal the shoes off a corpse, wrapped in a rug, that they're supposed to dump in the river.

Klump tells him that they're supposed to leave the body as it is. Shlubb disagrees and pulls the boots off, to discover that there are no feet in them, and a ticking sound rings through their ears. This was apparently a test, and the two buffoons get thrown several yards away as the explosion hits. It seems they failed the test miserably.

"Blue Eyes", the second story, begins as a man named Jim notices someone he assumes is a hitman following him. He runs into Kadie's, where he is confronted by an ex-flame named Delia. Marv is sitting next to them at the bar, and provides some comic relief. The hitman enters the bar, and Jim convinces Delia to leave with him. Marv then steals his drink, reasoning that it would have gone to waste otherwise.

Jim and Delia go back to his place and make love. She then attacks him, and explains that this is her test. She wants to become a [[hitman|hitwoman]], and she must first kill the only man she ever loved. After killing Jim, the Colonel appears - he was the 'hitman' who had been following Jim. He gives her an assignment, and she takes on the name 'Blue Eyes', which is what Jim used to call her.

Blue Eyes is shown to take place at the same time as ''A Dame To Kill For'', as part of the story shows Gail telling Shelley what to tell the police about Dwight.  The story also has brief appearances by many characters, including Miho, Agammemnon and Manute.

"Rats" is the final story, it is about a disturbed war criminal who eats dog food. It was adapted to a 2004 [[fan film]] of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2655362]&lt;/ref&gt;

A sadistic war criminal (and presumed [[Nazi]]) stuffs rats in his oven to eat as he mentally rambles about the [[London Blitz]], his arthritis, and how he killed all the 'rats', which were all people. A vigilante known amongst readers as 'The Janitor' kicks down the door and incapacitates him, before shoving his head into the oven, gassing him to death.

==''Sex &amp; Violence''==

''Sex &amp; Violence'' was first published in March 1997 and only contains two stories, both of which feature Delia:
* "Wrong Turn" (23 pages)
* "Wrong Track" (3 pages)
The two stories take place on the same night, with the second taking place minutes after the first.

"Wrong Turn" is the first story, in which a man named Phil drives aimlessly in the rain, eventually finding Delia unconscious on a dirt road. He picks her up, and she tells him that she must have got struck by lightning. He offers to take her to the hospital, but she refuses. She asks if he is married, and he says that he is not. She takes him to the pits, and they make love. In the middle of it, he confesses that he is, in fact, married.

She starts choking him and calls him by the name of Eddie. She claims he has a trunk-load of stolen jewels he plans to sell in Sacred Oaks, violating an exclusivity agreement with the Wallenquist Organization. He explains that he is a used car salesman named Phil, and she understands. Eddie was supposed to be driving a similar Studebaker, and looked very similar. She sticks the heel of her shoe in his eye socket, killing him. She meets up with the Colonel and Gordo at the entrance to the pits. They check the trunk of Phil's car and find his wife with six bullets in her chest. They throw him in as well and Gordo pushes the car into the pits. Delia explains that she has a train to catch.

"Wrong Track" is the second story, which picks up soon after. Eddie is riding the train. His internal monologue explains that he had a flat tire. Delia hits on him, and they make love near the back of the train.

When they're done, she snaps his neck and throws him off the train. Leaving the rear of the train, the Colonel waits for her. "Delia-- do you plan to make love to each and every one of them?" he asks. Her response is "Only the ones I like."

=="Just Another Saturday Night"==

"Just Another Saturday Night" was first published in ''Sin City #1/2'' (August 1997), a limited mail-in comic available only through a special offer in ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' #73. It was later reprinted in a mass-market edition as ''Just Another Saturday Night'' (October 1998).

It is the story of what Marv was up to on the night [[John Hartigan]] met back up with [[Nancy Callahan|Nancy]] (from ''[[That Yellow Bastard]]''). Marv regains consciousness on a highway overlooking the Projects, surrounded by dead young guys, unable to remember how he got there. He lights one of the dead guys' cigarettes and thinks back; since it is Saturday, he deduces he must have been at Kadie's watching Nancy dance.

Marv was rather depressed after seeing Nancy leave with Hartigan, as he had always had an unrequited crush on her, so the barkeep gives him a bottle to drown his sorrow with. He gets drunk and steps outside, only to find some preppy college kids trying to burn drunks and winos to death. He immediately kills one of them and chases the rest to The Projects, where along the way he destroys a police patrol car and hijacks another vehicle. At the Projects, it is clear that they are being watched, but Marv uses hand signals to identify himself and instruct his former neighbors to attack the kids, and they do so by firing arrows at them and providing Marv with a knife. After questioning the last surviving kid about him being called 'Bernini boy' (it was the name of the brand of coat he was wearing), he slits his throat. This done, he muses, "And one fine coat it ''is''. Somebody must've spent a ''fortune'' on it. I wonder ''who''?" But he cannot seem to remember where he got the coat or gloves.

==''Family Values''==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Frank Miller (comics)]] --&gt;
{{main|Family Values (comics)}}
'''''Family Values''''' was first published in (October 1997) and was the fifth "yarn" in [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[Sin City]]'' series. Unlike the previous four stories, ''Family Values'' was released as a 128-page [[graphic novel]] rather than in serialized issues that would later be collected in a trade paperback volume. The plot concerns Dwight and Miho going on a mission from Gail to dig up information about a recent mob hit at a small diner.

The '''Madrid system''' (officially the '''Madrid system for the international registration of marks''') is the primary international system for facilitating the registration of trademarks in multiple jurisdictions around the world. Its legal basis is the multilateral [[treaty]] ''Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks'' of 1891, as well as the ''Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement'' (1989).

The Madrid system provides a centrally administered system of obtaining a bundle of trademark registrations in separate jurisdictions. Registration through the Madrid system does not create a unified registration, as in the case of the European Union trade mark&lt;ref&gt;Council Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 of 26 February 2009 on the Community trade mark (Official Journal No. L78, 24.3.2009, p.1)&lt;/ref&gt; system; rather, it creates a bundle of national rights through an international registration able to be administered centrally.  Madrid provides a mechanism for obtaining trademark protection in many countries around the world which is more effective than seeking protection separately in each individual country or jurisdiction of interest.

The Madrid Protocol system provides for the international registration of trade marks by way of one application that can cover more than one country. The opportunity of having a single registration to cover a wide range of countries gives advantages, both in terms of portfolio management and cost savings, as opposed to a portfolio of independent national registrations.

Madrid now permits the filing, registration and maintenance of trade mark rights in more than one jurisdiction, provided that the target jurisdiction is a party to the system. The Madrid system is administered by the International Bureau of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. There are 90 countries part of the Madrid System.

== History and development ==
{{one source|section|date=December 2016}}
The Madrid system comprises two treaties; the ''Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks'',&lt;ref group="fn"&gt;The full name of the Madrid Agreement is the "Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks of April 14, 1891 (as revised at [[Brussels]] on December 14, 1900, at [[Washington, DC|Washington]] on June 2, 1911, at [[The Hague]] on November 6, 1925, at [[London]] on June 2, 1934, at [[Nice]] on June 15, 1957, and at [[Stockholm]] on July 14, 1967, and as amended on September 28, 1979)".&lt;/ref&gt; which was concluded in 1891, and entered into force in 1892, and the ''Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement'', which came into operation on 1 April 1996. The Madrid Agreement and Madrid Protocol were adopted at diplomatic conferences held in [[Madrid, Spain]].

The Madrid Agreement was originally intended to provide for an international registration system, but did not achieve this for two significant reasons:

* The lack of international acceptance. Many non-member countries, including the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and [[Central America]]n, [[South America]]n and [[Asia]]n countries, such as [[Japan]], were not adherents, which undermined recognition of the system as a truly "international" regime. Significantly, many of these countries represent the largest numbers of trademark filings and registrations in the world; and
* The mere forwarding by the International Bureau of a uniform application to member countries, rather than the registration of the applicable trademark in the national trademark registers, precludes an actual "registration" system.

Some of the large trading nations like the United States, Japan, and [[Canada]], which have a large number of filings at the national level, did not join the Madrid Agreement due to another perceived flaw in the system:  if the home registration upon which an international registration was based came under 'central attack', the international registration would be cancelled or limited to the same extent that the home registration was cancelled or limited.

During 1966 and 1967, attempts were made to address this issue by establishing a new treaty that would reflect the need of the times rather than the world of the 1890s when the agreement was adopted. This led to the drafting of the Trademark Registration Treaty (TRT) which was adopted in [[Vienna]] in 1973, and entered into effect in 1980, with five contracting states, namely, [[Burkina Faso]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Gabon]], [[Soviet Union]] and [[Togo]]. In the absence of more accessions to the TRT and the low number of registrations since its inception, it was clear that the TRT was unlikely to supplant the Madrid Agreement.

As the realization of the introduction of a multi-jurisdictional (or at least pan-European) European [[Community Trade Mark]] (CTM) approached, the relevancy of the Madrid system came under scrutiny. Pressure increased on [[WIPO]] to maintain its relevance and strengthen the agreement by increasing membership, possibly through amendments. This culminated in the introduction of the Madrid Protocol, pursuant to which a CTM registration could be a 'foundation' or 'home' registration upon which an international registration could then be established. This mechanism is referred to as a "linking provision." The Protocol, after considerable lobbying efforts by WIPO, was signed by many countries, including most of the present members of the Madrid Agreement, and some countries that are members of the European Union, but were not members of the Madrid Agreement.  The Protocol entered into force on December 1, 1995 and became operative on April 1, 1996.

Many countries have needed to modify or consider modifying their trademark laws in order to adhere to the Protocol, in addition to the modifications required by [[GATT]]-[[TRIPS]]/[[World Trade Organization|WTO]].

In Europe, resistance to the Protocol was brought by trademark attorneys who were afraid of losing business because a [[Community Trade Mark]] application could be filed directly through the Madrid Protocol process.&lt;ref name="inta042003"&gt;[http://www.inta.org/Advocacy/Documents/INTAMadridProtocolUSImpact.pdf Report by the International Trademark Association, April 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the proposal bogged down due to a trademark dispute between two businesses who were heavy campaign contributors to certain Congressmen, followed by a repeated reshuffling of the Senate due to elections and a subsequent defection of a Republican senator.&lt;ref name="inta042003"/&gt; The treaty was eventually ratified during the Presidency of [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;WIPO web site, [http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/treaties/en/documents/pdf/madrid_marks.pdf List of Members of the Madrid System]&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan revised its trademark law with the official acceptance of the [[International (Nice) Classification of Goods and Services|Nice Classification]] (an international trademark classification system for products and services), as well as applications covering service using [[service marks]]. The members of the [[European Community]] have amended their laws to conform to the [[European Community Harmonization Directive]]. In recent years trademark laws in several other countries such as [[Malaysia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]] have also been amended to accommodate the changes. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

== Members ==
[[File:Madrid Protocol 2018.svg|thumb|right|400px|Madrid Union members]]

{{one source|section|date=December 2016}}
Adherence to the convention or the protocol includes membership of the "Madrid Union." As of April 2016 there are 97 members. The original treaty has 55 members, all of which are also party to the protocol (when Algeria joined the Madrid Protocol on October 31, 2015, all of the members of the Madrid Agreement were also members of the Madrid Protocol and many of the aspects of the Madrid Agreement ceased to have practical effect).  The term 'Madrid Union' can be used to describe those jurisdictions party to either the Agreement or the Protocol (or both).&lt;ref name="wipo"&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/treaties/en/documents/pdf/madrid_marks.pdf WIPO.int]&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary reason the protocol—which has been in operation since 1996 and has 100 members&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/madrid/en/members/]&lt;/ref&gt; — is more popular than the agreement — which has been in operation for more than 110 years and has 55 members&lt;ref name="wipo" /&gt;—is that the protocol introduced a number of changes to the Madrid system which significantly enhanced its usefulness to trademark owners.

For example, under the protocol it is possible to obtain an international registration based on a pending trade mark application, so that a trade mark owner can effectively apply for international registration concurrently, or immediately after, filing an application in a member jurisdiction. By comparison, the agreement requires that the trade mark owner already holds an existing registration in a member jurisdiction, which may often take many months and sometimes years to obtain in the first place. In addition, the agreement does not provide the option to 'convert' international registrations which have been 'centrally attacked.'

== Advantages ==
{{one source|section|date=December 2016}}
The Madrid system provides a mechanism whereby a trademark owner who has an existing trademark application or registration (known as the 'basic application' or 'basic registration') in a member jurisdiction may obtain an 'international registration' for their trademark from the WIPO.  The trademark owner may then extend the protection afforded to the international registration to one or more member jurisdictions, a process known as 'designation'. A useful feature of the Madrid system is that this protection may generally be extended to additional jurisdictions at any time, such that international trade mark protection can be extended to new jurisdictions which subsequently join Madrid, or to such other jurisdictions as the trade mark owner may choose.

In basic terms, the primary advantage of the Madrid system is that it allows a trademark owner to obtain trademark protection in any or all member states by filing one application in one jurisdiction with one set of fees, and make any changes (e.g. changes of name or address) and renew registration across all applicable jurisdictions through a single administrative process.

== Disadvantages ==
{{one source|section|date=December 2016}}
One disadvantage of the Madrid system is that any refusal, withdrawal or cancellation of the basic application or basic registration within five years of the registration date of the international registration will lead to the refusal, withdrawal or cancellation of the international registration to the same extent. For example, if a basic application covers 'clothing, headgear and footwear,' and 'headgear' is then deleted from the basic application (for whatever reason), 'headgear' will also be deleted from the international application. Therefore, the protection afforded by the international registration in each designated member jurisdiction will extend only to 'clothing and footwear.' If the basic application is rejected as a whole, the international registration would also be totally refused.

The process of attacking the basic application or basic registration for this purpose is generally known as 'central attack.' Under the Madrid Protocol, the effects of a successful central attack can be mitigated by transforming the international registration into a series of applications in each jurisdiction designated by the international registration, a process known as 'transformation.' Although transformation is an expensive option of last resort, the resulting applications will receive the registration date of the international registration as their filing date.

In 1997, less than half of a percent of international registrations were canceled as a result of central attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/madrid/en World Intellectual Property Organization]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost savings which usually result from using the Madrid system may be negated by the requirement to use local agents in the applicable jurisdiction if any problems arise.

== Developments since 2000 ==
{{one source|section|date=December 2016}}
Two significant recent developments in international trademark law were the accession of the [[United States]] and the [[European Union]] to the Madrid Protocol on November 2, 2003, and October 1, 2004, respectively. With the addition of these jurisdictions to the protocol, most major trading jurisdictions have joined the Madrid system.

On 31 July 2015, [[Algeria]] deposited its instrument of accession and will accede to the Madrid Protocol on 31 October 2015. As Algeria was the last member of the Madrid system to adhere to the protocol, the protocol is now effective across the entire Madrid system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/madrid/en/news/2015/news_0016.html Algeria Joins the Madrid Protocol], ''WIPO'', 7 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Massacre in Korea''''' is an [[expressionism|expressionistic]] painting completed on January 18, 1951, by [[Pablo Picasso]]; it criticizes United States intervention in the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref&gt;David Hopkins, ''After Modern Art: 1945-2000'' (Oxford University Press, 2000), p.15. {{ISBN|0-19-284234-X}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-284234-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Picasso A Retrospective,'' [[Museum of Modern Art]], edited by [[William Rubin]], copyright MoMA 1980, p.383&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ingo F. Walther, ''Pablo Picasso, 1881-1973: Genius of the Century'' (Taschen, 2000),  p. 94. {{ISBN|3-8228-5970-2}}, {{ISBN|978-3-8228-5970-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may depict an event such as the [[No Gun Ri Massacre]] in July 1950 when an undetermined number of South Korean refugees were killed by U.S. forces, or the same year, the [[Sinchon Massacre]], an alleged mass killing carried out in the county of [[Sinchon]], [[South Hwanghae Province]], [[North Korea]]. ''Massacre in Korea'' depicts civilians being killed by anti-communist forces. The art critic Kirsten Hoving Keen says that it is "inspired by reports of American atrocities" and considers it one of Picasso's communist works.&lt;ref name="keen"/&gt; 

Picasso's work is influenced by [[Francisco Goya]]'s painting ''[[The Third of May 1808]]'', which shows [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s soldiers executing Spanish civilians under the orders of [[Joachim Murat]].&lt;ref name="keen"&gt;Keen, Kirsten Hoving. "Picasso's Communist Interlude: The Murals of War and Peace". ''The Burlington Magazine'', Vol. 122, No. 928, Special Issue Devoted to Twentieth Century Art, July, 1980. p. 464.&lt;/ref&gt; It stands in the same iconographic tradition of an earlier work modeled after Goya: [[Édouard Manet]]'s series of five paintings depicting [[The Execution of Emperor Maximilian|the execution of Emperor Maximilian]], completed between 1867 and 1869.

[[File:El Tres de Mayo, by Francisco de Goya, from Prado thin black margin.jpg|thumb|left|[[Francisco Goya]], ''The Third of May 1808'', 1814, [[Museo del Prado]]]]
As with Goya's ''The Third of May 1808'', Picasso's painting is marked by a bifurcated composition, divided into two distinct parts. To the left, a group of naked women and children are seen situated at the foot of a mass grave. A number of heavily armed "knights" stand to the right, also naked, but equipped with "gigantic limbs and hard muscles similar to those of prehistoric giants." The firing squad is rigidly poised as in Goya. In Picasso's representation, however, the group is manifestly helter-skelter – as was often apparent in his portrayals of armored soldiers in drawings and lithographs – which may be taken to indicate an attitude of mockery of the idiocy of war.

Their helmets are misshapen, and their weaponry is a mishmash amalgamation of the instruments of aggression from the medieval period to the modern era; not quite guns nor lances, they perhaps most resemble candlesticks. What is more, none of the soldiers have penises. This representational feature is highlighted by the pregnant state of the women on the left side of the panel. Many viewers have interpreted that the soldiers, in their capacity as destroyers of life, have substituted guns for their penises, thereby castrating themselves and depriving the world of the next generation of human life.  Along with ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' and ''[[The Charnel House]]'' (1944–45), this is one of Picasso's works that he composed to depict the politics of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas John Cull, David Holbrook Culbert, David Welch, ''Propaganda and mass persuasion: a historical encyclopedia, 1500 to the present'' (ABC-CLIO, 2003), p.156. {{ISBN|1-57607-820-5}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57607-820-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At {{convert|43|in|m}} by {{convert|82|in|m}}, the work is smaller than his ''Guernica''. However, it bears a conceptual resemblance to that painting as well as an expressive vehemence.&lt;ref name="BB302"&gt;Boeck &amp; Sabartés, p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is exhibited in the [[Musée Picasso]] in Paris.

'''Mokoš''' ({{lang-orv|Мокошь}}) is a [[Slavic goddess]] mentioned in the [[Primary Chronicle]], protector of women's work and women's destiny.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-s36xYcqG1EC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=mokosh+goddess&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xMpdUfj8BYm68ATRgoHICg&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=mokosh%20goddess&amp;f=false Russian folk belief By Linda J. Ivantis]&lt;/ref&gt; She watches over spinning and weaving, shearing of sheep,{{citation needed|reason=the shearing of sheep needs a citation|date=December 2015}} and protects women in childbirth. Mokosh is the [[Mother Goddess|Great Mother]].&lt;ref name=katicic2003&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Radoslav Katičić|Katičić]] |first=Radoslav |title=Die Hauswirtin am Tor: Auf den Spuren der großen Göttin in Fragmenten slawischer und baltischer sakraler Dichtung |year=2003 |publisher=PETER LANG |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=3-631-50896-4 |url=http://www.peterlang.com/detail/buch/35057/5/50896/ |ref=Katičić 2003 |pages=40 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074137/http://www.peterlang.com/detail/buch/35057/5/50896/ |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mokoš was the only female deity whose idol was erected by [[Vladimir the Great]] in his [[Kiev]] sanctuary along with statues of other major gods ([[Perun]], [[Hors]], [[Dažbog]], [[Stribog]], and [[Simargl]]).

==Etymology and origin==
Mokosh probably means [[moisture]]. According to [[Max Vasmer]], her name is derived from the same root as Slavic words  ''mokry'', 'wet', and ''moknut(i)'', 'get wet'. Or to dive deeply into something. She may have originated in the northern  [[Finno-Ugric peoples|Finno-Ugric tribes]] of the [[Vogul]], who still have the divinity ''Moksha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mother Russia: The Feminine Myth in Russian Culture|last=Hubbs|first=Joanna|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=Sep 22, 1993|isbn=0253115787|location=Indiana|pages=20|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Myth==
[[File:Makosh-XIX Lob.png|thumb|150px|Mokosh.{{cn|date=December 2015}} Embroidery pattern ca 19th century.]]
Mokoš was one of the most popular Slavic deities and the great earth [[Mother Goddess]] of [[East Slavs]] and [[Polans (eastern)|Eastern Polans]]. She is a [[Nomad|wanderer]] and a [[Spinning (textiles)|spinner]]. Her consorts are probably both the god of thunder [[Perun]] and his opponent [[Veles (god)|Veles]].

Archeological evidence of Mokosh dates back to the 7th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Harald Haarmann (2008). "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jr8SglurL90C&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=Mokosh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gJOAVKXfMMiZNu-ngTg&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Mokosh&amp;f=false]''". Introducing the Mythological Crescent: Ancient Beliefs and Imagery p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; As late as the 19th century, she was worshipped as a force of fertility and the ruler of death. Worshipers prayed to Mokosh-stones or [[Kurgan stelae|breast-shaped boulders]] that held power over the land and its people.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Monaghan (2010). "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8zHxlL8my-YC&amp;pg=PA516&amp;lpg=PA516&amp;dq=mokosh+in+embroidery&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZUEHYOCHX9&amp;sig=WLqcg1DyrQ9Jx-iKspakhKltSAA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6VxeUZ6zBI-I9QSip4CwAw&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=mokosh%20in%20embroidery&amp;f=false]''". Encyclopedia of Goddesses and Heroines p. 516&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Eastern Europe]], Mokosh is still popular as a powerful life giving force and protector of women. Villages are named after her. She shows up in embroidery, represented as a woman with uplifted hands and flanked by two plow horses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-s36xYcqG1EC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=mokosh+goddess&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xMpdUfj8BYm68ATRgoHICg&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=mokosh%20&amp;f=false Russian folk belief]&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes she is shown with male sexual organs, as the deity in charge of male potency.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fVQz3I4FCWUC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=mokosh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=57j1UejGNpLU8wSx04HYDQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mokosh&amp;f=false Mother Russia: The Feminine Myth in Russian Culture By Joanna Hubbs p. 26]&lt;/ref&gt;

A key myth in [[Slavic mythology]], is the [[Perun#Myth|divine battle]] between the thunder god [[Perun]] and his opponent the god [[Veles (god)|Veles]]. Some authors and the original researchers Ivanov and Toporov believe, the abduction of Mokosh causes the struggle,&lt;ref&gt; although Ivanov and Toporov nowhere quote original sources indicating that fact. Compare: Katičić (2010){{rp|210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ha2hlK0volAC&amp;pg=PA216&amp;dq=Mokosh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gJOAVKXfMMiZNu-ngTg&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Mokosh&amp;f=false Pushkin's Historical Imagination by Svetlana Evdokimova p. 216]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Boris Rybakov]], in his 1987 work ''Paganism of Ancient Rus'',&lt;ref name="Rybakov"&gt;{{cite book | author =Boris Rybakov | title =Язычество Древней Руси (Paganism of Ancient Rus) | year =1987 | editor = | pages = | chapter =Святилища, идолы и игрища | chapterurl =http://historic.ru/books/item/f00/s00/z0000030/st003.shtml | publisher =Nauka | location =Moscow | id = | url =http://historic.ru/books/item/f00/s00/z0000030/ | format = | accessdate = |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mokosh is represented on one of the sides of the [[Zbruch Idol]].

==Christianization==
[[File:Mokosh-1 (SCHLEUSING).jpg|thumb|Warning from the Christian church against worshipping Mokosh]]
During [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']] there were warnings issued against worshipping Mokoš. She was replaced by the cult of the [[Virgin Mary]] and [[Paraskevi of Iconium|St. Paraskevia]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]]'', ''[[Vladimir Toporov]]''. Mokoš./ ''В. В. Иванов, В. Н. Топоров'' - «Мокошь». Мифы народов мира, т. II. М.:Российская энциклопедия, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traces of Mokosh in place names ==
Traces of Mokosh are today well preserved in the various toponyms of Slavic countries. In Slovenia her name has been preserved in a village called Makoše in the vicinity of Ribnica, historically known as Makoša or Makoš, and also in the River Mokoš in the Prekmurje region. In Croatia, near the Rieka lies the village of Mokošica, and near Dubrovnik the village Makoše, and also the suburb areas of Nova and Stara Mokošica. A village near Zagreb is also called Mokos. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, near the village Ravno is located a hill called Mukušina. South of Mostar lies the hill Mukoša.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Češarek|first=Domen|date=2016|title=Mala gora pri Ribnici – mitološko izročilo v prostoru (Mala Gora (Little Mountain) by Ribnica – Cosmic myth in mythical landscape)|url=http://sms.zrc-sazu.si/pdf/19/SMS_19_06_Cesarek.pdf|journal=Studia mythologica Slavica|volume=19|pages=135|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vincent van Gogh in Paris Montmartre.webm|{{largethumb}}|Researcher Nienke Bakker of the [[Van Gogh Museum]] shows how Van Gogh experimented with new painting techniques in Montmartre.]]
The '''''Montmartre paintings''''' are a group of works that [[Vincent van Gogh]] made in 1886 and 1887 of the Paris district of [[Montmartre]] while living there with his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]].  Rather than capture urban settings in Paris, van Gogh preferred pastoral scenes, such as Montmartre and [[Asnières (Van Gogh series)|Asnières]] in the northwest suburbs.  Of the two years in Paris, the work from 1886 often has the dark, somber tones of his early works from the [[Netherlands]] and [[Brussels]].  By the spring of 1887, van Gogh embraced use of color and light and created his own brushstroke techniques based upon [[Impressionism]] and [[Pointillism]].  The works in the series provide examples of his work during that period of time and the progression he made as an artist.

==Background==

===Paris===
In 1886, van Gogh left the Netherlands for Paris and the guidance of his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo van Gogh]] who was an art dealer. While he had been influenced not only by the great [[Dutch masters]] but also to a considerable extent by his cousin-in-law [[Anton Mauve]] a Dutch realist painter and a leading member of the [[Hague School]].&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;{{cite book | title=The World of Van Gogh (1853-1890) | author=Wallace, R | editor= of Time-Life Books | publisher=[[Time-Life Books]] | location=Alexandria, VA, USA | year=1969 | pages=40, 69 | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; coming to Paris meant that he would also have the opportunity to be influenced by [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]], [[Pointillism|Pointillists]], and Japanese art. His circle of friends included [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]].&lt;ref name="Wallace" /&gt;

===Montmartre===
[[Montmartre]], sitting on a [[butte]] overlooking Paris, was known for its bars, cafes, and dance-hall. It was also located on the edge of countryside that afforded Van Gogh the opportunity to work on paintings of rural settings while living in Paris.&lt;ref name=Hamilton&gt;{{cite book | title=Millet to Matisse: Nineteenth- and Twentieth-century French painting from |author1=Hamilton, V |author2=Kelvingrove Museum |author3=Art Gallery  |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher=[[Yale University Press]] with Glasgow Museums | location=New Haven and London | year=2002 | pages=104–105 | isbn=0-902752-65-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h2H6FzdXl84C&amp;pg=PA104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artistic style===
When Van Gogh painted he intended not just to capture the subject, but to express a message or meaning.  It was through his paintings of nature that he was most successful at accomplishing his goal.  It also created a great challenge: how to portray the subject and create a work that would resonate with the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Symbolist movement in the literature of European languages |author1=Balakian, A |author2=Balakian, A.E. | publisher=John Benjamins Publishing | location=Netherlands | year=2008 | pages=446–447 | isbn=978-963-05-3895-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oCj6gVt5qyUC&amp;pg=PA446 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

===Montmartre scenes===
The ''Boulevard de Clichy'' (F292), a street in Montmartre, played an important role in van Gogh's life in Paris. The Café du Tambourin was located there,&lt;ref name=VGM292&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=1813&amp;collection=621&amp;lang=en |title=Boulevard de Clichy, 1887  |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; a restaurant just around the corner from the apartment where he lived with his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]].  There van Gogh met with other artists and displayed some of his works.  He had a relationship with the owner of the establishment, [[Agostina Segatori]], who was also the subject in one of his paintings ''[[Agostina Segatori Sitting in the Café du Tambourin]]''.&lt;ref name="Leaf"&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Table: At the Auberge Ravoux | first1=A | last1=Leaf | first2=F | last2=Lebain | publisher=Artisan | location=New York | year=2001 | page=40 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MBxJtWUz-CoC&amp;pg=PA40 | isbn=1-57965-182-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Located on the boulevard was the studio of [[Fernand Cormon]], where van Gogh received training, as well as the [[Moulin Rouge]] and the homes of several of his friends, who he referred to as "Impressionistes du Petit Boulevard": [[John Peter Russell]], [[Georges-Pierre Seurat]] and [[Paul Signac]].&lt;ref name=VGM292/&gt;  The painting of the Boulevard is Impressionistic in terms of subject and technique.  Van Gogh used short brush strokes to depict the figures of the people and the buildings.  Light is reflected off the road.  Capturing a moment in a street scene was a common theme for Impressionists.&lt;ref name=VGM292INI&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=1813&amp;subpage=1816&amp;collection=621&amp;lang=en#moretotell  |title=Impressionism and Neo-impressionism |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The vantage point for the painting was looking northwest from Place Blanche.  Rue Lepic's entrance is on the right side of the painting. Van Gogh also made a drawing of this site from a greater distance.&lt;ref name=VGM292IMON&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=1813&amp;subpage=1815&amp;collection=621&amp;lang=en#moretotell  |title=Montmartre |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Le Moulin de la Galette''===
{{main|Le Moulin de la Galette (Van Gogh series)}}

Van Gogh created a number of paintings titled ''Le Moulin de la Galette'', which was also called ''Moulin Bloute-Fin''. In van Gogh’s first year in Paris he painted rural areas around Montmartre, such as the butte and its windmills.  The colors are somber and evoke a sense of his anxiety and loneliness.&lt;ref name=Galbally145&gt;{{cite book | title=A remarkable friendship: Vincent van Gogh and John Peter Russell | author=Galbally, A | publisher=Melbourne University Publishing | location=Carlton, Victoria | year=2008 | page=145| isbn=978-0-5228-5376-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXpgapo52p8C&amp;pg=PA145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The landscape and windmills around Montmartre were the source of inspiration for a number of van Gogh's paintings. The [[Moulin de la Galette]], still standing, is located near the apartment he shared with his brother. Built in 1622, it was originally called Blute-Fin and belonged to the Debray family in the 19th century. Van Gogh met artists such as Toulouse-Lautrec, Paul Signac and Paul Gauguin who inspired him to incorporate Impressionism into his artwork resulting in lighter, more colorful paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Frommer's Memorable Walks in Paris | author=Mroue, H | publisher=Wiley Publishing Inc. | location=Hoboken | year=1999 | page=123 | isbn=0-471-77648-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4r9itsvPqyQC&amp;pg=PA123 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Windmills also featured in some of van Gogh's landscape paintings of Montmartre.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Other windmill paintings===
''The Hill of Montmartre with Stone Quarry''(F229) was but one of van Gogh's paintings of the Montmartre countryside.  The apartment where he lived with his brother bordered the countryside and overlooked the city of Paris.  At the time the painting was made, the country landscape was beginning to disappear as a result of the city's expansion.  Soon the fields, pastures and windmills would largely disappear from the Montmartre area.  Van Gogh draws the audience in by use of the diagonal line of fences to the windmill just right of the center of the picture.  This technique also established depth in the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=1748&amp;collection=621&amp;lang=en |title=The Hill of Montmartre with Stone Quarry, 1886 |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vegetable gardens in Montmartre===
Montmatre's vegetable gardens, fenced in blocks for security and to clearly separate the allotted spaces, supplied the Paris markets with spinach, lettuce, cabbage and other vegetables.&lt;ref name=Fell20&gt;{{cite book| author=Fell, D |year=2001 |title=Van Gogh's Gardens | location=United Kingdom |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |page=20 | isbn=0-7432-0233-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QssD77mFRkkC&amp;pg=PA20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vegetable Gardens in Montmartre: La Butte Montmartre'' (F346) depicts the changing landscape of the Montmartre landscape. In the foreground are allotted vegetable gardens with people working in their allotments. Although still somewhat rural, a large apartment building is constructed in the fields.  The three remaining windmills in the area had now become a source of entertainment and respite from working in the city. Le Blute-Fin, also called ''[[Le Moulin de la Galette (Van Gogh series)|Le Moulin de la Galette]]'' was the largest standing mill offering a café and a terraced viewing platform for looking over Paris from behind the mill.  Between the mills are dining establishments and dance halls. He used techniques he picked up from the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] and [[Pointillism|Pointillists]], such as use of short brush strokes or dots of color.  The colors are much brighter than the somber colors he used in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name=VGM346and316&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=2101&amp;collection=621&amp;lang=en%7CVegetable |title=Montmartre: mills and vegetable gardens, 1887  |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-05-11 |postscript=' More information is found in the video on this page, especially the information about ''Vegetable Gardents in Montmartre'' (F316).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vegetable Gardens in Montmartre: La Butte Montmartre'' (F316), the same name as painting F346, was selected by Van Gogh for his first exhibition in 1888 in Paris.  Both paintings reflect how much he had learned since he came to Paris and were made on the same hill.  The summery landscape depicts the vegetable gardens with the city skyline in the distance.  Van Gogh was pleased with his work on this painting, commenting that it "breathed fresh air and joy".&lt;ref name=VGM346and316/&gt;

===View from Vincent's Room===
{{main|View of Paris from Vincent's Room in the Rue Lepic}}

Van Gogh lived with his brother in Montmartre. Located above the city of Paris, the apartment afforded him a beautiful view of the city skyline, which he painted several times.&lt;ref name=VGM231&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=1757&amp;collection=621&amp;lang=en |title=Roofs in Paris, 1886 |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two of the paintings were made in 1887.  The second painting ''View from Vincent's window''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghgallery.com/catalog/Painting/704/View-of-Paris-from-Vincent%27s-Room-in-the-Rue-Lepic.html |title=View of Paris from Vincent's Room in the Rue Lepic (F341a)|year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Paintings |publisher=Van Gogh Gallery |accessdate=2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; was made from a similar vantage point to the titled painting ''View of Paris from Vincent's Room in the Rue Lepic'' of this article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghgallery.com/catalog/Painting/703/View-of-Paris-from-Vincent%27s-Room-in-the-Rue-Lepic.html |title=View of Paris from Vincent's Room in the Rue Lepic (F341)|year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Paintings |publisher=Van Gogh Gallery |accessdate=2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''View of Paris'' (F341) van Gogh demonstrates several [[Neo-impressionist]] techniques.  To bring an intensity to his work, he uses complementary colors of red and green.  He adapted the stippling technique, using tiny dots in areas where needed for detail and brush strokes for the background.&lt;ref name=VGM292INI/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===View of Paris===
''Roofs in Paris'' (F231) was made by van Gogh in 1886, his first year in Paris.  Although acquainted with [[Impressionism]], he had not yet begun to integrate color and light into his work. This painting consists of dull brown and gray.

An '''orphan work''' is a [[copyright]] protected work for which [[rightsholder]]s are positively indeterminate or uncontactable. Sometimes the names of the originators or rightsholders are known, yet it is impossible to contact them because additional details cannot be found.&lt;ref name= Borgman&gt;{{Cite book| last= Borgman| first= Christine L.| title= Scholarship in the digital age: information, infrastructure, and the internet| publisher= MIT Press| year= 2007| page= 108| url= http://Google.com/books?id=ZDDu3CuzDdMC&amp;dq=orphan+works+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn= 978-0-262-02619-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A work can become orphaned through rightsholders being unaware of their [[:wikt:holding#Noun|holding]], or by their demise (e.g. deceased persons or defunct companies) and establishing inheritance has proved impracticable.&lt;ref name=JISC&gt;{{Cite book| title= In from the Cold: An assessment of the scope of 'Orphan Works' and its impact on the delivery of services to the public| publisher= JISC Collections Trust| date= April 2009| page= 9| url= http://sca.JISCinvolve.org/files/2009/06/sca_colltrust_orphan_works_v1-final.pdf| access-date= 2010-05-31| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091118103903/http://sca.jiscinvolve.org/files/2009/06/sca_colltrust_orphan_works_v1-final.pdf#| archive-date= 2009-11-18| dead-url= yes| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, comprehensively diligent research fails to determine any authors, creators or originators for a work. Since 1989, the amount of orphan works has increased dramatically since registration is optional, many works' statuses remain unknown and therefore are in a grey area, therefore cannot be used, since fair use deals with non-orphaned works.

==Extent==
Precise figures of orphan works are not readily available, even though libraries, archives and museums hold a vast number of them. In April 2009, a study estimated that the collections of public sector organisations in the UK hold about 25&amp;nbsp;million orphan works.&lt;ref name=JISC /&gt; Examples of orphan works include photographs that do not note the photographer, such as photos from scientific expeditions and historical images, old folk music recordings, little known novels and other literature.&lt;ref name=Borgman /&gt; [[Software]] which became an orphaned work is usually known as ''[[abandonware]]''. The [[Computerspielemuseum Berlin]] estimates that around 50% of their [[video game]] collection consists of at least partial orphans.&lt;ref name="50percent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiig.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Maier_JIPITEC-2015-120_Games-as-cultural-heritage.pdf |title=Games as Cultural Heritage Copyright Challenges for Preserving (Orphan) Video Games in the EU |accessdate=2016-01-18 |first=Henrike |last=Maier |publisher=[[Humboldt Universität zu Berlin]] |date=2015 |format=PDF |work=JIPITEC |pages=127| quote=''The [[Computerspielemuseum Berlin|Computerspielemuseum]] in Berlin estimates that around 50 % of their collection consists of at least partial orphans.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Source code escrow]] can prevent software orphaning but is seldom applied.

==Impact==
In countries whose laws do not specifically allow for the use of orphan works, orphan works are not available for legal use by filmmakers, archivists, writers, musicians, and broadcasters. Because rightsholders cannot be identified and located to obtain permission, historical and cultural records such as period film footage, photographs, and sound recordings cannot be legally incorporated in contemporary works in such countries (unless the incorporation qualifies as [[fair use]]).&lt;ref name= Netanel&gt;{{Cite book| last= Netanel| first= Neil| title= Copyright’s paradox| publisher= Oxford University Press US| year= 2008| page= 200| url= https://www.google.com/books?id=vo9G-0iZNQIC&amp;dq=orphan+works&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn =978-0-19-513762-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Public libraries]], educational institutions, and [[museums]] that digitise old manuscripts, books, sound recordings, and film may choose to not digitise orphan works or make orphan works available to the public&lt;ref name= Netanel /&gt; for fear that a re-appearing rightsholder may sue them for damages.&lt;ref name= Borgman /&gt;

==Causes==
According to Neil Netanel the increase in orphan works is the result of two factors: (1) that [[copyright term]]s have been lengthened, and (2) that copyright is automatically conferred without registration or renewal.&lt;ref name= Netanel /&gt; Only a fraction of old copyrighted works are available to the public. Netanel argues that rightsholders have "no incentive to maintain a work in circulation" or otherwise make their out-of-print content available unless they can hope to earn more money doing so than by producing new works or engaging in more lucrative activities.&lt;ref name= Netanel /&gt;

==Specifics by country==

=== Canada ===
[[Canada]] has created a supplemental licensing scheme, under Section 77 of its Copyright Act, that allows licenses for the use of published works to be issued by the Copyright Board of Canada on behalf of unlocatable rightsholders, after a prospective licensor has made "reasonable efforts to locate [holders of] copyright".&lt;ref name= Canada1&gt;{{cite web

===European Union===
{{Main|Orphan Works Directive}}
The [[European Commission]] (EC), the civil branch of the [[European Union]] (EU), created a report on Digital Preservation of Orphan Works and Out-of-Print Works in 2007.&lt;ref name=EC&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 with the passing of the [[Fairness in Music Licensing Act]] in the United States the European Commission brought an arbitration against the United States in the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) for violation of the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]]. The WTO sided with the EC in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/1234da.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the US and EC announced a temporary settlement arrangement on 23 June 2003, with the Fairness in Music Licensing Act remaining in effect&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds160_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the US paying to a fund established in the EU for the benefit of rights-holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; As of 7 May 2010, the US continues to file required status reports, with the WTO stating that they are working on a resolution with all parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docsonline.wto.org/GEN_highLightParent.asp?qu=%28%40meta%5FSymbol+WT%FCDS160%FC%2A%29&amp;doc=D%3A%2FDDFDOCUMENTS%2FT%2FWT%2FDS%2F160%2D24A65%2EDOC%2EHTM&amp;curdoc=3&amp;popTitle=WT%2FDS160%2F24%2FAdd%2E65 |title=WT/DS160/24/Add.65 |date=May 7, 2010 |accessdate=May 25, 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 June 2008, European representatives of museums, libraries, archives, audiovisual archives and rightsholders signed a [[Memorandum of Understanding]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/digital_libraries/other_groups/hleg/meetings/index_en.htm |title=Digital Libraries Initiative - High Level Expert Group (HLEG) &amp;#124; Europa - Information Society |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; an orphan works legislation supported by rightsholders. It helps cultural institutions to digitize books, films, and music whose authors are unknown, making them available to the public online.&lt;ref name=EC /&gt; In 2009 the [[Strategic Content Alliance]] and the [[Collections Trust]] published a report&lt;ref name=JISC /&gt; on the scope and impact of orphan works and their effect on the delivery of web services to the public.

In October 2012 the European Union adopted [[Directive 2012/28/EU]] on Orphan Works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/orphan_works/index_en.htm |title=Directive 2012/28/EU |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The directive applies to orphan works that were created in the EU as printed works (books, journals, magazines and newspapers), [[cinematographic]] and audio-visual works, [[Sound recording|phonogram]]s, and works embedded or incorporated in other works or phonograms (e.g. pictures in a book). Under certain conditions, the directive can also apply to unpublished works (such as letters or manuscripts).&lt;ref name="European Commission Memo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Memo - Orphan works - FAQ|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-12-743_en.htm?locale=en|work=europa.eu|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether orphaned [[software]] and [[video game]]s ("[[Abandonware]]") fall under the ''audiovisual works'' definition is a matter debated by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiig.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Maier_JIPITEC-2015-120_Games-as-cultural-heritage.pdf |title=Games as Cultural Heritage Copyright Challenges for Preserving (Orphan) Video Games in the EU |accessdate=2016-01-18 |first=Henrike |last=Maier |publisher=[[Humboldt Universität zu Berlin]] |date=2015 |format=PDF |work=JIPITEC |pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Directive was influenced by a survey of the state of intellectual property law in the [[United Kingdom]] called the ''[[Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property and Growth]]''. [[James Boyle (academic)|James Boyle]], one of the experts consulted for the Review, praised the directive as a start, but offered this criticism of the resulting policy:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepublicdomain.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Is-Copyright-Reform-Possible1.pdf "(When) Is Copyright Reform Possible? Lessons from the Hargreaves Review"] by James Boyle (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In brief, the scheme is heavily institutional, statist, and inflexible. Its provisions can really only be used by educational and cultural heritage institutions, only for non-profit purposes, with lengthy and costly licensing provisions designed to protect the monetary interests of&amp;mdash;almost certainly&amp;mdash;non-existent rights holders. The EU seemed never to grasp the idea that citizens also need to have access to orphan works, for uses that almost certainly present no threat to any living rights holder.}}

=== United Kingdom ===
On 29 October 2014 the [[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)|Intellectual Property Office]] launched an online licensing scheme for orphan works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apply for a licence to use an orphan work |url=https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-licence-to-use-an-orphan-work |website=www.gov.uk |publisher=IPO UK Government |accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/millions-of-orphan-artworks-and-historic-documents-to-be-seen-under-new-copyright-laws-9824266.html "Millions of unseen 'orphan' artworks to be put on show"] by Adam Sherwi], ''[[The Independent]]'', 29 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approaches ==
Through actions of [[tactical media]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://zararah.net/blog/2015/03/15/digital-rights-play-parody/ Zara Rahman: Claiming back digital rights through play and subversion]&lt;/ref&gt; the Peng Collective wants to inspire other activists and civil society organisations to be more courageous in their campaigning methods. "Let's learn from our enemies," one of their members says in an interview. "If you look at the economics of corporations, their state of mind is: 'let's look at every possible gray area of laws and use them.' And NGOs just don't do that."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobilisationlab.org/google-nest-parody-pushes-limits-of-ngo-tactics/ Mobilisation Lab: Google Nest parody pushes limits of NGO tactics]&lt;/ref&gt; They are known for wearing animal masks as sign of biological appropriation whenever they are on stage and to break the law "whenever necessary for the greater good. And yes, the arts can be a greater good."

They got international media attention, when they held a presentation called "Your data, our future" in the Name of [[Google]] at Europe's largest tech conference [[re:publica]] in 2014. All presented products were designed to gather more data from the consumers, claiming that this is in their best interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastcocreate.com/3030418/how-activists-fooled-the-internet-with-these-convincing-new-google-nest-products Fast Company: How Activists Fooled The Internet With These Convincing New Google Nest Products]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2014/05/07/google-nest-spoof-by-german-activists-promises-eerie-data-driven-future/ Forbes Magazine: Google Nest Spoof By German Activists Promises Eerie, Data-Driven Future]&lt;/ref&gt; After Google threatened them to take down their parody website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/google-nest-parody-taken-down-2014-5?IR=T Business Insider: Google Got A Parody Site That Made Fun Of Its Privacy Policies To Take Everything Down]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) supported them legally:

The company wrote a polite note to the collective, expressing their sincere respect for political commentary—but nonetheless demanding that Peng! revise the site and assign the domain name to Google.

EFF responded to Google on Peng's behalf, explaining what should be obvious: the site was pure noncommercial political commentary.

=== Slamshell ===
Invited as fake persona to a conference of the oil company [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], they created an oil spill on stage instead of the expected presentation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/14/shell-berlin-science-slam-video_n_4440676.html Shell's Berlin 'Science Slam' Event Reportedly Disrupted By Anti-Drilling Activists (Huffington Post)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/151440-oil-spill-nigeria-activists-prank-shell-hijack-science-slam-berlin-slamshell.html Premium Times Nigeria: Activists prank Shell, hijack “Science Slam” in Berlin]&lt;/ref&gt; The evening was a public relations event organized by [[Burson Marsteller]] in Berlin, where one member of the Collective could enter the stage because he claimed to have created a car that is cleaning the air.

=== Cooperation with the Yes Men and Pussy Riot ===
In 2015, the group infiltrated the [[Cinema for Peace]] Gala in Berlin with a fake polar bear and [[The Yes Men]] to go on stage and insist that divestment from fossil fuels is helping more against climate change than charity projects. [[Pussy Riot]], who was invited as speaker to the [[Charity (practice)|charity]] gala came to support them, when the organizers of the event tried to silence them with security guards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://taz.de/Cinema-for-Peace-Eklat-naechste-Runde-/!156929/ German article about the event in the newspaper taz]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://apologytonatalieportman.com/ Letter of apology to Natalie Portman for hijacking her stage and the video of the evening]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zero Trollerance ===
In May 2015, they developed a bot script that scans [[Twitter]] for abusive and sexist language. Once detected, plenty of automated Twitter profiles would reply to those tweets with an invitation to a self-help program for trolls to become [[feminist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/social-media/11535405/How-do-you-stop-Twitter-trolls-Unleash-a-robot-swarm-to-troll-them-ba Daily Telegraph Article "How do you stop Twitter trolls? Unleash a robot swarm to troll them back"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intelexit ===
In September 2015, the Peng Collective staged an association named [[Intelexit]] helping anyone working for [[Intelligence agency|secret services]] to quit their jobs and transition to civil life, be it for ethical or psychological reasons. A spokesman of the British secret service [[GCHQ]] responded to the launch of the association, that GCHQ doesn't actually do anything illegal or immoral, and that staff can report any concerns they do have to managers or to GCHQ's own counselors. Furthermore, they responded to the Intelexits critique of their lack of ethical standards that the GCHQ "has several formal lines of accountability and a culture and ethos of high ethical standards among our workforce." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2015/09/campaign-help-surveillance-agents-quit-nsa-gchq/ Wired US article "This New Campaign Wants To Help Surveillance Agents Quit NSA or GCHQ"]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the launch of the campaign, they rallied with an advertising trucks and mobile billboards in front of several secret services workplaces around the world like the German BND, the GCHQ Headquarters in the UK, the US military bases in Germany [[Dagger Complex]] and [[Lucius D.

Intelexit now operates phone booth installations in arts and journalists venues where participants can call up secret service employees such as the [[FBI]], [[NSA]], [[CIA]] and private subcontractors like [[Trovicor]] or [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] in the USA, but also officers from Germany, France, Canada and Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2016/03/15/peng-le-collectif-qui-veut-aider-les-espions-a-raccrocher_4883226_4408996.html Le Monde article about the Call a Spy launch]&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation invites people to set up the call installation all over the world to create an ongoing dialogue between civil society and the intelligence community.

=== Artikel 26 ===
In Schwenke (Halver), Peng! had founded a fictitious CDU local association, which appealed to party leader Angela Merkel to campaign against the export of small arms in the next legislative period. This appeal was also reported in international media. Later the communication guerrilla action was confirmed by Peng!

In the same week, Peng! started an alleged recall of small arms from the manufacturer Heckler &amp; Koch by sending letters to US arms dealers on its behalf. The web pages of Heckler &amp; Koch in the USA and Germany were then provided for several days with the news that they had been the victims of a hacker attack and fake news.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mic.com/articles/176439/anonymous-art-collective-trolls-hundreds-of-heckler-and-kochs-us-gun-vendors-with-bogus-recall-prank#.ocoh91DVr Mic article about the weapon prank]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same week, the group released a video documenting how they awarded a peace prize for the arms industry and how Thyssen Krupp Marine Systems only left shortly before the alleged award ceremony.

As part of this series of actions, Peng! published five legislative proposals for the renewal of the War Weapons Control Act and for the "Rescue of Article 26 GG".

=== Deutschland Geht Klauen ===
With this Campaign PENG called people to snatch goods in supermarkets and to pay unions of the producers in the global south instead. They created an online-system with which it is possible to do so through their website, seemingly an online-shop. You can thus pay eight unions fighting for the rights of the workers while PENG is fighting for the introduction of a law in Germany with which you can take German companies accountable for the violation of human rights abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[https://deutschlandgehtklauen.de/en Deutschlandgehtklauen website]&lt;/ref&gt;

PENG created a photo-booth in which you could create portraits that contain your own face and from someone else by morphing them together. The technology was based on neural networks by OpenAI and megapixels by Adam Harvey.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/PengBerlin/status/1043529657168089088 Tweet from Peng revealing the sources]&lt;/ref&gt; They themselves created a German passport that contained both one member from their team and [[Federica Mogherini]]. They also sent five passports to co-artists in Libya with whom they morphed the faces to let them enter Europa as both real and symbolic gesture of civil disobedience against the border regime.&lt;ref&gt;[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pa9vyb/peng-collective-artists-hack-german-passport article by Motherboard, "German Art Activists Get Passport Using Digitally Altered Photo of Two Women Merged Together" Oct 9 2018, 6:09pm]&lt;/ref&gt;. The photo booth was further shown in Vienna and Munich on art exhibitions.

On the [[Athens Biennale]] 2018 named "ANTI", Peng contributed by installing a call center with six Greek employees payed by German tax money on minimum wage who are calling the [[Financial_regulation | financial regulation institutions]] for six weeks.

[[File:Dutch, 17th century, Black boy with slave collar, Private Collection.jpg|thumb|upright|Black boy with [[slavery|slave collar]], Dutch 17th-century painting.]]

'''Representations of slavery in European art''' date back to ancient times. They show slaves of varied ethnicity, white as well as black.

In Europe, slavery became increasingly associated with blackness from the 17th century onwards. However, slaves before this period were predominantly white. The ''black'' in European art is not the same topic as the ''slave'' in European art: slaves were not always black and blacks not always slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Also note the ambiguity of the term "Turkish slave": a Turkish slave may be a Turk or someone enslaved by a Turk. See [[Turkish Slave]] for yet another layer of confusion about a picture by [[Parmigianino]].&lt;/ref&gt; The article also concentrates on European art rather than Western art in general.

== Slaves in art ==
[[File:Retrato de Juan Pareja, by Diego Velázquez.jpg|thumbnail|upright|''[[Portrait of Juan de Pareja]]'', by Velázquez]]
[[File:Alexandre Dumas (1762-1806).JPG|thumbnail|upright|Thomas Alexandre Dumas]]

From the Renaissance onwards, a substantial number of bound figures, often naked and crouching, illustrate enslavement.&lt;ref&gt;''The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem'', ed Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This imagery had for one of its roots the ancient tradition of [[Roman Triumph]], but its contemporaneous relevance was greatly magnified by the prevalence of slavery within European countries. In particular, [[galley slaves]] were often used by artists as models for muscular nude bodies.

Sometimes the name of an individual who was a slave is known. One instance is  [[Juan de Pareja]] (1606–1670) who was a slave of [[Velázquez]] and was trained as a painter by the artist. Velázquez freed Juan de Pareja in 1650 and the document of manumission survives.&lt;ref&gt;See Carmen Fracchia's article in The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem, ed Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The document which was discovered by [[Jennifer Montagu]] is in the Archivio di Stato in Rome. See ''Burlington Magazine'', volume 125,1983,pages 683-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Juan de Pareja became a successful artist himself.

[[Alexandre Dumas]] of ''The Three Musketeers'' fame, was the son of a slave, [[Thomas-Alexandre Dumas|also known as Alexandre]], who rose to be a general in chief in the French army. His portrait hardly suggests his early life as a slave. He was pawned by his father who was a French nobleman but was lucky enough to be retrieved by the father and brought up in France.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Reiss, ''The Black Count: Glory, Revolution, Betrayal, and the Real Count of Monte Cristo'' (New York: Crown Publishers, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frans Post]] (1612—1680) and [[Albert Eckhout]] (c.1610–1665) were two early Dutch painters to depict slavery. Post painted pictures of slaves working in  idyllic rural landscapes which do little to reflect the harsh realities of their life.&lt;ref&gt;See Ernest van den Boogaart article in ''The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem'', ed Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Eckhout's work is a visual record of the ethnic mix in Dutch Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;See Jean Michel Massing in Studies in ''Imagery II: the World Discovered''. London 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Rebecca Parker Brienen, ''Albert Eckhout'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconographic aspects of slavery==


The trade in black Africans was widespread in Europe long before the [[Triangular Trade]] involving Europe, Africa and the Americas. Numerous portraits of high-class Europeans show them in the company of black figures, often children, whose status may be advertised by the silver [[slavery|slave collar]] being worn. A silver collar is usually worn in conjunction with luxurious clothes and other finery, which allowed the artist to show off his repertoire and the owner of the slave to show off his or her wealth. In fact, in the 17th and 18th centuries, it was the fashion among some wealthy Europeans to have their black household slaves or servants wear silver collars; these were often inscribed with the name of the owner or employer. The slave collar is seen in contemporary paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophies to Abolitionist Emblem| editor1= McGrath, Elizabeth  | editor2= Massing, Jean Michel |location= London |publisher=The Warburg Institute|date= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chains, fetters, manacles, slave collars are the familiar iconographic markers of slavery with the broken chain being particularly useful for ''dis''-enslavement.{{cn|date=May 2014}} 

Slaves were chattel and so it is no surprise to see that they were on occasion branded like cattle in life and in art. Another sign of slavery, less obvious and much less gruesome, was the cropped pony tail or topknot which marked an enslaved Turk in the galleys.&lt;ref&gt;See articles by Elizabeth McGrath and Rick Scorza in ''The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem'', ed Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Often slaves were  prisoners captured in war and  there is an iconographical overlap between the two.  Michelangelo's [[Dying Slave]] was not given this title by him. He instead talked of such figures as prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Echinger-Maurach, ''Studien zu Michelangelos Juliusgrabmal'', 2 vols, Hildesheim,  1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The slave status of Caryatids is similarly open to interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius ''De Architectura'' I.1.4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is not always clear from a picture that a slave or a servant or a free person has been represented. Thus, it is unknown if the portrait of Juan de Pareja were painted by Velázquez while the former was still a slave. In any case, the portrait is not an image of enslavement, even if Juan de Pareja were a slave at the time of painting.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

== Abolitionism ==

[[File:Wedgwood - Anti-Slavery Medallion - Walters 482597.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Anti-Slavery Medallion by Josiah Wedgwood]]

With [[Abolitionism]], the imagery of enslavement was turned to a social and political purpose. An instance of this is the medallion devised for the movement by [[Josiah Wedgwood]] which shows a  pleading grateful black slave. People wore the medallion as a token of their commitment to abolitionism.

An example of an anti-Abolitionist image is that by [[George Cruikshank]], ''New Union Club''. It satirises what supposedly took place at a celebrated dinner organised by Abolitionists.

[[File:London. St. Paul's Cathedral, West Front (3610785549).jpg|thumb|Photograph, c.1865-c.1895, with the original railings by [[Jean Tijou]] still in place]]
A '''statue of Queen Anne''' is installed in the forecourt outside the west front of [[St Paul's Cathedral]], in London, United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Margaret|title=Discovering London Statues and Monuments|date=2002|publisher=Osprey Publishing|pages=145–146|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pVJLa5jgzQ4C&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a Grade II [[listed building]] in 1972.

==Description and history==
The statue is a copy of an 1712 sculpture by [[Francis Bird]] in [[Carrara marble]] which formerly stood at the same location.  [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] was the ruling British monarch when the new St Paul's Cathedral was completed in 1710.  Bird's statue was unveiled at a thanksgiving service for the [[Peace of Utrecht]], held 7 July 1713.   The statue cost £1,130, excluding the marble which was provided by the Queen.  It was surrounded by an elegant metal railing made by [[Jean Tijou]].  The Tijou railings were later removed and replaced by heavier railings to match the others around the cathedral.  The original statue was attacked at least three times, in 1743, 1768, and 1882, with noses and arms damaged, and it was also badly weathered by the 1880s.  Reputedly, the statue was once defaced with the lines "[[Brandy Nan]], Brandy Nan, left in the lurch; Her face to the gin-shop, her back to the church", alluding to the Queen's reputed fondness for strong liquor and the location of a [[gin palace]] near the cathedral.

[[Richard Claude Belt]] was commissioned in 1885 to create a replacement statue from Sicilian marble, supplied by the [[Corporation of London]] at a cost of £1,800.  Belt was imprisoned for obtaining money by false pretences in March 1886, and [[Louis Auguste Malempré]] completed the sculpture.  The building work to install the statue was done by [[Mowlem|Mowlem and Sons]], supervised by the [[city architect]] Sir [[Horace Jones (architect)|Horace Jones]], and the new sculpture was unveiled by [[Reginald Hanson]], the [[Lord Mayor of London]], on 15 December 1886, the year before the [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria]].

The [[Baroque]] sculpture depicts Queen Anne standing, facing down [[Ludgate Hill]] towards [[Ludgate Circus]].  She is robed, wearing the [[Livery collar|collar]] of the [[Order of the Garter]] and a gilded crown, with one hand holding a gilded orb and the other a gilded sceptre.  The figure stands on a [[Portland stone]] pedestal by architect [[Christopher Wren]], decorated with four symbolic figures, one on each corner: to the west, towards Ludgate Hill, are [[Britannia]] with gilded trident (representing England) and a figure representing France (with [[fleur-de-lys]] on the visor of her helmet), holding between them a carved representation of the [[British Royal Coat of Arms]], and to the east, towards St Paul's Cathedral, are figures representing Ireland (with harp) and North America (a Native American, with feathered skirt and headdress, gilded bow, quiver of arrows, and lizard).  The pedestal stands on three steps surrounded by heavy [[cast iron]] railings.

The pedestal bears two inscriptions: on the south side "The Original STATUE / was erected on this spot in the year 1712 / to commemorate the completion of / SAINT PAUL'S CATHEDRAL / FRANCIS BIRD Sculptor." and on the north side: "This Replica / of the Statue of QUEEN ANNE / was erected at the expense of / The CORPORATION of LONDON / In the year 1886 / The Rt. Hon. / SIR [[Reginald Hanson|REGINALD HANSON]] M.A. F.S.A. / [[Lord Mayor of London|Lord Mayor]] / [[William Braham|Wm. Braham]] Esq / Chairman of the City Lands Committee."

After they were removed, the original 8-ton weathered sculpture, and the four similarly weathered 5-ton stone figures from the base, were rediscovered months later abandoned in the yard of a London stonemason.  They were acquired by [[Augustus Hare]] and installed in the grounds of his house at [[Holmhurst St Mary]] near [[Hastings]], with Queen Anne mounted on an elliptical pedestal and the four other seated figures on steps around at the base, similar to the original.  The house was Grade II listed in 1976, and the statue received a separate Grade II* listing at the same time.

'''Stella Kramrisch''' (1896-1993) was a cosmopolitan [[art historian]], who was well known as a specialist in [[Indian art]] and [[Hinduism]]. She researched and taught Indian art history for more than six decades on three continents. After writing her dissertation on the essence of early-buddhist sculpture in India, she was invited to teach at [[Kala Bhavana]] in [[Santiniketan|Shantiniketan]] (1922-24), from where she went on to a teaching post at [[Calcutta University]] (1924-1950). In Europe Kramrisch worked at the [[Courtauld Institute of Art|Courtauld Institute]], London (1937-1940). From 1950, she was professor at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in the Department of South Asia Regional Studies, where she had been recruited by [[W. Norman Brown]], in addition to being a curator at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exploring India's Sacred Art.

==Early life and education in Vienna==
Stella Kramrisch was born on May 29, 1896 in Nikolsburg, now [[Mikulov]], in [[Austria]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/02/obituaries/stella-kramrisch-indian-art-expert-and-professor-97.html "Stella Kramrisch, Indian-Art Expert and Professor, 97"], ''The New York Times'', Retrieved 1 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; She was trained as a ballet dancer growing up in Austria. When Kramrisch was about 10 her parents moved to [[Vienna]]. One day she came across a translation of the [[Bhagavadgita]]: "I was so impressed it took my breath away."&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.philly.com/1986-01-24/entertainment/26055249_1_indian-art-indian-painting-stella-kramrisch/2 A Meeting Of Art, India And Devotion - Page 2 - Philly.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; She had found what she wanted to do in her life. She enrolled at the [[University of Vienna]], studying at the department of art history with Professors [[Max Dvořák]] and [[Josef Strzygowski]]. She focused her studied on Indian art and culture. Thus she learned Sanskrit and read philosophy, literature and anthropology. In 1919, she successfully completed her studies by earning her doctorate.&lt;ref name="Sozanski"&gt;Sozanski, Edward J. [http://articles.philly.com/1993-09-01/entertainment/25988025_1_indian-art-curator-d-harnoncourt "Indian Art Expert S. Kramrisch Dies at 97"], ''Philly.com'', Retrieved 1 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Art historical work in India==
That year she traveled to London in 1919 as part of a university delegation to give three lectures at Oxford. [[Rabindranath Tagore]] heard her speak and invited her to come to India and teach at the [[Visva-Bharati University]] in [[Santiniketan]] in 1922. She was appointed professor of Indian art at the [[University of Calcutta]] in 1924, where she taught until 1950. In 1924 her first monograph "Essence of Indian art"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Grundzüge der Indischen Kunst|last=Kramrisch|first=Stella|publisher=Avalun Verlag|year=1924|location=Hellerau, Dresden|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in German, which was reviewed widely in various journals throughout Europe. In the 1920s Kramrisch kept travelling to Vienna to give lectures. Various articles of her colleagues in Vienna appear as English translations in the Journal of the [[Indian Society of Oriental Art,]] which Kramrisch edited from 1933 onwards together with [[Abanindranath Tagore]]. Her seminal publication "Indian sculpture" (1933) was a profound analysis of Indian sculpture, conceptualized in size and format to function as an actual handbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian Sculpture. The Heritage of India Series.|last=Kramrisch|first=Stella|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1933|isbn=|location=London/New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the British left India in 1947, her husband Laszlo Nemenyi opted to work for the new government of [[Pakistan]] and moved to [[Karachi]]. In 1950 he was found shot dead on a beach. Only after this, she finally moved permanently to the [[United States]]. While in India, she had converted to [[Hinduism]], and begun a collection of South Asian art, later left to the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061003060923/http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/kramrischs.htm Dictionary of Art Historians&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curator of Indian art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art==
Stella Kramrisch was the Professor of South Asian Art at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] for a long period of time. She was also the curator of Indian art at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] from 1954 until 1972, and was a Curator Emeritus until her death.&lt;ref name=Sozanski/&gt; In 1981 she curated ''Manifestations of Shiva'', a large-scale exhibition of Indian art and sculpture at the Museum, which was met with both critical and popular success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/information/45-603-503.html "History: 1980-1990"], Philadelphia Museum of Art, Retrieved 1 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Her books include ''The Hindu Temple'' (1946, still in print in India), "Principles of Indian Art", and the encyclopedic "The Presence of Siva". She was a friend of the ballerina, designer, actress, and collector [[Natacha Rambova]].{{fact|date=June 2018}} [[Barbara Stoler Miller]] and Wayne E. Begley were among her students.{{fact|date=June 2018}} Prof. Kramrisch was succeeded by [[Michael W. Meister]],{{when?|date=June 2018}} who is currently the W. Norman Brown Professor of South Asia Studies and History of Art at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].{{fact|date=June 2018}}

==Death==
Kramrisch died on September 2, 1993 at her home in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Honors==
In 1982 the Indian government awarded Kramrisch with its [[Padma Bhushan]] award.&lt;ref name=Sozanski/&gt; In 1985 she was awarded the prestigious [[Charles Lang Freer Medal]] by the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref name=Sozanski/&gt;

==Legacy==
At the time of her death, Kramrisch left a bequest of 25 works to the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name=Sozanski/&gt; In addition, Kramrisch's curatorial position was officially re-titled as the Stella Kramrisch Curator at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], a position which still exists today.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.philamuseum.org/pma_archives/ead.php?c=IND&amp;p=hn "Historical Note"], Philadelphia Museum of Art, Retrieved 1 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
King was born September 21, 1947, in [[Portland, Maine]]. His father, Donald Edwin King, was a [[merchant navy|merchant seaman]]. Donald was born under the surname Pollock, but as an adult, used the surname King.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media| title= ''[[Finding Your Roots]]''| publisher= PBS| date= September 23, 2014| format= TV documentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.geni.com/people/Donald-King/6000000006574282764|title=Donald Edwin King |work= geni.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= genealogy&gt;[http://www.genealogy.com/famousfolks/stephen-king/d0/i0000002.htm Ancestry of Stephen King] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023205329/http://www.genealogy.com/famousfolks/stephen-king/d0/i0000002.htm |date=October 23, 2006 }} at Genealogy.com. Retrieved August 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; King's mother was Nellie Ruth ([[née]] Pillsbury).&lt;ref name="genealogy" /&gt;

When Stephen King was two years old, his father left the family under the pretense of "going to buy a pack of cigarettes," leaving his mother to raise Stephen and his older brother, David, by herself, sometimes under great financial strain. The family moved to [[De Pere, Wisconsin]], [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], and [[Stratford, Connecticut]]. When King was 11, his family returned to [[Durham, Maine]], where his mother cared for her parents until their deaths. She then became a [[caregiver]] in a local residential facility for the [[mentally challenged]].&lt;ref name=OfficialBio/&gt; King was raised [[Methodist]]&lt;ref name=OfficialFAQ&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.stephenking.com/faq.html#0.5 |title= Frequently Asked Questions| website= StephenKing.com| access-date= October 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but lost his belief in organised religion while in high school. While no longer religious, King chooses to believe in the existence of a God.&lt;ref name= guardian&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/29/stephen-king-religion-dangerous-god-exists |title=Stephen King: 'Religion Is a Dangerous Tool... but I Choose to Believe God Exists' |last=Flood |first=Allison |date=October 29, 2014 |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher= [[Guardian Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, King apparently witnessed one of his friends being struck and killed by a train, though he has no memory of the event. His family told him that after leaving home to play with the boy, King returned, speechless and seemingly in shock. Only later did the family learn of the friend's death. Some commentators have suggested that this event may have psychologically inspired some of King's darker works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Beahm| first= George| title= The Stephen King Story: A Literary Profile| publisher= Andrews and McMeel| year= 1991| isbn= 0836279891}}&lt;/ref&gt; but King makes no mention of it in his memoir ''[[On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft|On Writing]]'' (2000).

King related in detail his primary inspiration for writing horror fiction in his non-fiction ''[[Danse Macabre (book)|Danse Macabre]]'' (1981), in a chapter titled "An Annoying Autobiographical Pause." King compares his uncle's [[dowsing]] for water using the bough of an apple branch with the sudden realization of what he wanted to do for a living. That inspiration occurred while browsing through an attic with his elder brother, when King uncovered a paperback version of an [[H. P. Lovecraft]] collection of short stories he remembers as ''The Lurker in the Shadows'', &lt;!-- "The Lurker in the Shadows" doesn't exist and King may mean "The Lurker at the Threshold", but as he says "Shadows" we qualify it by saying that's what he remembers it as.--&gt; that had belonged to his father. King told Barnes &amp; Noble Studios during a 2009 interview, "I knew that I'd found home when I read that book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic7JnF4vStA&amp;feature=relmfu |title=Stephen King – Meet the Writers (5:45 into the video) |publisher=YouTube |date=November 3, 2009 |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King attended Durham Elementary School and graduated from [[Lisbon Falls High School]], in [[Lisbon Falls, Maine]]. He displayed an early interest in horror as an avid reader of [[EC Comics|EC's horror comics]], including ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comic)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' (he later paid tribute to the comics in his screenplay for ''[[Creepshow]]''). He began writing for fun while still in school, contributing articles to ''Dave's Rag'', the newspaper his brother published with a [[mimeograph machine]], and later began selling to his friends stories based on movies he had seen (though when discovered by his teachers, he was forced to return the profits). The first of his stories to be independently published was "I Was a Teenage Grave Robber"; it was serialized over four issues (three published and one unpublished) of a [[fanzine]], ''Comics Review'', in 1965. That story was published the following year in a revised form as "In a Half-World of Terror" in another fanzine, ''Stories of Suspense'', edited by [[Marv Wolfman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Wood | first=Rocky|title=Stephen King: Uncollected, Unpublished'' | publisher= Cemetery Dance Publications| location=Abingdon, Maryland |year=2006| page=199|isbn= 1-58767-130-1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a teen, King also won a [[Scholastic Art and Writing Awards|Scholastic Art and Writing Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| publisher= Scholastic Inc.| title= America’s Most Creative Teens Named as National 2016 Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards Recipients| url= http://mediaroom.scholastic.com/press-release/america-s-most-creative-teens-named-national-2016-scholastic-art-writing-awards-recipi| date= March 14, 2016 | location= New York City| access-date= January 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1966, King studied at the [[University of Maine]], graduating in 1970 with a [[Bachelor of Arts#United States|Bachelor of Arts]] in English. That year, his daughter Naomi Rachel was born. He wrote a column, ''Steve King's Garbage Truck'', for the student newspaper, ''[[The Maine Campus]]'' and participated in a writing workshop organized by [[Burton Hatlen]].&lt;ref name=bn&gt;{{Cite news|first=Alicia |last=Anstead |title=UM scholar Hatlen, mentor to Stephen King, dies at 71 |url=http://bangornews.com/news/t/city.aspx?articleid=159261&amp;zoneid=17 |newspaper=[[Bangor Daily News]] |date=January 23, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302041533/http://bangornews.com/news/t/city.aspx?articleid=159261&amp;zoneid=176 |archivedate=March 2, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; King held a variety of jobs to pay for his studies, including janitor, gas pump attendant, and worker at an industrial laundry.

==Career==
===Beginnings===
King sold his first professional short story, "The Glass Floor," to ''Startling Mystery Stories'' in 1967.&lt;ref name=OfficialBio/&gt; The [[Raymond H. Fogler Library|Fogler Library]] at the University of Maine now holds many of King's papers.

After leaving the university, King earned a certificate to teach high school but, unable to find a teaching post immediately, initially supplemented his laboring wage by selling short stories to [[List of men's magazines|men's magazines]] such as ''[[Cavalier (magazine)|Cavalier]]''. Many of these early stories have been republished in the collection ''[[Night Shift (book)|Night Shift]]''. The short story ''The Raft'' was published in ''Adam'', a men's magazine. After being arrested for driving over a traffic cone, he was fined $250 and had no money to pay the petty larceny fine. Luckily payment arrived for the short story ''The Raft'', then entitled ''The Float'', and "all I did was cash the check and pay the fine."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=T.E.D.|date=June 1983|title=Cone fever . . .|url=https://archive.org/details/TwilightZoneJune83|journal=Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone Magazine|volume=3|issue=2|pages=6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, King married [[Tabitha King|Tabitha Spruce]], a fellow student at the University of Maine whom he had met at the University's Fogler Library after one of Professor Hatlen's workshops.&lt;ref name="bn"/&gt; That fall, King was hired as a teacher at [[Hampden Academy]] in [[Hampden, Maine]]. He continued to contribute short stories to magazines and worked on ideas for novels.&lt;ref name=OfficialBio/&gt; During that time, King developed a drinking problem which would plague him for more than a decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Tim|title=The Stephen King interview, uncut and unpublished|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/sep/14/stephenking.fiction|work=The Guardian|date= September 14, 2000|accessdate=September 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, King's first novel ''[[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]'' was accepted by publishing house [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]. King had thrown an early draft of the novel into the trash after becoming discouraged with his progress writing about a teenage girl with psychic powers. His wife retrieved the manuscript and encouraged him to finish it.&lt;ref name="UKOnWriting"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = King | first1 = Stephen | title = On Writing: A Memoir | place = London (UK) | publisher = [[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]] | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-340-76996-3 | authorlink1 = Stephen King }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|54}} His advance for ''Carrie'' was $2,500; King's paperback rights later earned $400,000.

King and his family moved to southern [[Maine]] because of his mother's failing health. At this time, he began writing a book titled ''Second Coming'', later titled ''Jerusalem's Lot'', before finally changing the title to ''[[Salem's Lot]]'' (published 1975). In a 1987 issue of ''The Highway Patrolman'' magazine, he stated, "The story seems sort of down home to me. I have a special cold spot in my heart for it!"&lt;ref&gt;Konstantin, Phil. [http://americanindian.net/stephenking.html "An Interview with Stephen King"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412115244/https://americanindian.net/stephenking.html |date=April 12, 2014 }}, americanindian.net. Retrieved January 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after ''Carrie''{{'}}s release in 1974, King's mother died of [[uterine cancer]]. His Aunt Emrine had read the novel to her before she died. King has written of his severe drinking problem at this time, stating that he was drunk delivering the eulogy at his mother's funeral.&lt;ref name="UKOnWriting" /&gt;{{rp|69}}

After his mother's death, King and his family moved to [[Boulder, Colorado]], where King wrote ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]'' (published 1977). The family returned to western Maine in 1975, where King completed his fourth novel, ''[[The Stand]]'' (published 1978). In 1977, the family, with the addition of Owen Phillip (his third and last child), traveled briefly to England, returning to Maine that fall, where King began teaching creative writing at the University of Maine.

In 1985, King wrote his first work for the comic book medium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookdb.com/creator.php?ID=2957 |title=Stephen King at The Comic Book Database |publisher=Comicbookdb.com |accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; writing a few pages of the benefit [[X-Men]] comic book ''[[Heroes for Hope Starring the X-Men]]''. The book, whose profits were donated to assist with [[famine]] relief in Africa, was written by a number of different authors in the comic book field, such as [[Chris Claremont]], [[Stan Lee]], and [[Alan Moore]], as well as authors not primarily associated with that industry, such as [[Harlan Ellison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookdb.com/creator_title.php?ID=1385&amp;cID=2957&amp;pID=1 |title=Heroes for Hope |publisher=Comic Book Database |accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, King published ''[[It (novel)|It]]'' (1986), which was the best-selling hard-cover novel in the United States that year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/05/books/fatherhood-and-it-top-sellers-of-86.html |title='FATHERHOOD' AND 'IT' TOP SELLERS OF '86 |publisher=nytimes.com |accessdate=October 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote the introduction to ''[[Batman]]'' No. 400, an anniversary issue in which he expressed his preference for that character over [[Superman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookdb.com/issue.php?ID=34874 |title=Batman No. 400 |publisher=Comic Book Database |accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 221 |quote = Batman celebrated the 400th issue of his self-titled comic with a blockbuster featuring dozens of famous comic book creators and... with an introduction by novelist Stephen King.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Dark Tower'' books===
{{Main|The Dark Tower (series)}}

In the late 1970s, King began what became a series of interconnected stories about a lone gunslinger, Roland, who pursues the "Man in Black" in an alternate-reality universe that is a cross between [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]] and the American [[Wild West]] as depicted by [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Sergio Leone]] in their [[spaghetti Western]]s. The first of these stories, ''[[The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger]]'', was initially published in five installments by ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]]'' under the editorship of [[Edward L. Ferman]], from 1977 to 1981. ''The Gunslinger'' was continued as an eight-book epic series called ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'', whose books King wrote and published infrequently over four decades.

==={{anchor|Richard Bachman}}Pseudonyms===
{{Main|Richard Bachman}}
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, King published a handful of short novels—''[[Rage (Stephen King novel)|Rage]]'' (1977), ''[[The Long Walk]]'' (1979), ''[[Roadwork]]'' (1981), ''[[The Running Man (novel)|The Running Man]]'' (1982) and ''[[Thinner (novel)|Thinner]]'' (1984)—under the pseudonym '''[[Richard Bachman]]'''. The idea behind this was to test whether he could replicate his success again and to allay his fears that his popularity was an accident. An alternate explanation was that publishing standards at the time allowed only a single book a year.&lt;ref name=kingbachman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenking.com/pages/FAQ/Stephen_King/whybachman.php |title=Stephen King FAQ: "Why did you write books as Richard Bachman?" |author=King, Stephen |accessdate=December 13, 2006 |publisher=StephenKing.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115014750/http://www.stephenking.com/pages/FAQ/Stephen_King/whybachman.php |archivedate=November 15, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He picked up the name from the hard rock band [[Bachman-Turner Overdrive]], of which he is a fan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Steve|last=Newton |url=https://www.straight.com/article-193999/bto-founder-searched-stephen-king |title=Bachman-Turner Overdrive founder searched for Stephen King |website= Straight.com |date=January 13, 2009 |accessdate=September 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Bachman was exposed as King's pseudonym by a persistent Washington, D.C. bookstore clerk, Steve Brown, who noticed similarities between the works and later located publisher's records at the [[Library of Congress]] that named King as the author of one of Bachman's novels.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Steve. [http://www.liljas-library.com/bachman_exposed.php/ 'Richard Bachman Exposed']. Lilja's Library: The World of Stephen King. Retrieved December 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a press release heralding Bachman's "death"—supposedly from "cancer of the pseudonym".&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.simonandschuster.com/9781416548584 'Blaze – Book Summary']. Simon &amp; Schuster. Retrieved January 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; King dedicated his 1989 book ''[[The Dark Half]]'', about a pseudonym turning on a writer, to "the deceased Richard Bachman", and in 1996, when the Stephen King novel ''[[Desperation (novel)|Desperation]]'' was released, the companion novel ''[[The Regulators (novel)|The Regulators]]'' carried the "Bachman" byline.

In 2006, during a press conference in [[London]], King declared that he had discovered another Bachman novel, titled ''[[Blaze (novel)|Blaze]]''. It was published on June 12, 2007. In fact, the original manuscript had been held at King's alma mater, the University of Maine in Orono, for many years and had been covered by numerous King experts. King rewrote the original 1973 manuscript for its publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Stephen King companion: forty years of fear from the master of horror|last=Beahm|first=George|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Griffin|year=2015|isbn=9781466856684|location=New York |pages=118–119|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King has used other pseudonyms. The short story "[[The Fifth Quarter (short story)|The Fifth Quarter]]" was published under the pseudonym '''John Swithen''' (the name of a character in the novel ''[[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]''), that was published in ''[[Cavalier (magazine)|Cavalier]]'' in April 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beahm|first=George|title=Stephen King from A to Z: An Encyclopedia of His Life and Work|year=1998|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|isbn=978-0836269147|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was reprinted in King's collection ''[[Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes]]'' in 1993 under his own name. In the introduction to the Bachman novel ''[[Blaze (novel)|Blaze]]'', King claims, with [[tongue-in-cheek]], that "Bachman" was the person using the Swithen pseudonym.

The "[[children's book]]" ''[[Charlie the Choo-Choo (book)|Charlie the Choo-Choo: From the World of The Dark Tower]]'' was published under the pseudonym '''Beryl Evans''', who was portrayed by actress Allison Davies during a book signing at [[San Diego Comic-Con]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/07/22/charlie-choo-choo-stephen-king-dark-tower-comic-con|title='Charlie the Choo-Choo': 'The Dark Tower' fans seek Stephen King storybook that isn't real|date=July 22, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and illustrated by Ned Dameron.

===Digital era===
[[File:StephenKingGFDL.PNG|thumb|Stephen King at the [[Harvard Book Store]], June 6, 2005]]
In 2000, King published [[Internet|online]] a serialized [[Horror (genre)|horror]] novel, ''[[The Plant]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Computerworld]]|date= January 8, 2001 |page=14 |title=Barnes &amp; Noble Takes Popular Literature Digital|last=Verton |first=Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first the public presumed that King had abandoned the project because sales were unsuccessful, but King later stated that he had simply run out of stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/features/00/11/30/1238204.shtml |title=Stephen King's Net Horror Story |publisher=Slashdot |date=December 4, 2000 |accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unfinished [[epistolary novel]] is still available from King's official site, now free. Also in 2000, he wrote a digital novella, ''[[Riding the Bullet]]'', and has said he sees e-books becoming 50% of the market "probably by 2013 and maybe by 2012". But he also warns: "Here's the thing—people tire of the new toys quickly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Minzesheimer, Bob|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2010-10-20-ebooks14_CV_N.htm |title=More bibliophiles get on the same page with digital readers|work=[[USA Today]]|date= October 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2003, King began writing a column on pop culture appearing in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', usually every third week. The column, called ''The Pop of King'' (a play on the nickname "The King of Pop" commonly attributed to [[Michael Jackson]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=King |first=Stephen |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,472359,00.html |title=The Pop of King: The Tao of Steve |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=February 1, 2007 |accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, King published an [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|apocalyptic novel]], ''[[Cell (novel)|Cell]]''. The book features a sudden force in which every cell phone user turns into a mindless killer. King noted in the book's introduction that he does not use cell phones.

In 2008, King published both a novel, ''[[Duma Key]]'', and a collection, ''[[Just After Sunset]]''. The latter featured 13 short stories, including a novella, ''[[N. (novella)|N.]]'', which was later {{when|date=July 2018}} released as a serialized animated series that could be seen for free, or, for a small fee, could be downloaded in a higher quality; it then was adopted into a limited comic book series.

In 2009, King published ''[[Ur (novella)|Ur]]'', a novella written exclusively for the launch of the second-generation [[Amazon Kindle]] and available only on [[Amazon.com]], and ''[[Throttle (novella)|Throttle]]'', a novella co-written with his son [[Joe Hill (writer)|Joe Hill]] and released  later as an [[audiobook]] titled ''[[Road Rage (audiobook)|Road Rage]]'', which included [[Richard Matheson]]'s short story "[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]". King's novel ''[[Under the Dome (novel)|Under the Dome]]'' was published on November 10 of that year; it is a reworking of an unfinished novel he tried writing twice in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and at 1,074 pages, it is the largest novel he has written since ''[[It (novel)|It]]'' (1986). ''Under the Dome'' debuted at No. 1 in [[The New York Times Bestseller List|''The New York Times'' Bestseller List]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2009-11-29/hardcover-fiction/list.html|title=Best Sellers – The New York Times|date=November 29, 2009|accessdate=March 20, 2011|first=Jennifer|last=Schuessler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 16, 2010, King announced on his Web site that his next book would be a collection of four previously unpublished novellas called ''[[Full Dark, No Stars]]''. In April of that year, King published ''[[Blockade Billy]]'', an original novella issued first by independent small press [[Cemetery Dance Publications]] and later released in mass-market paperback by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]. The following month, [[DC Comics]] premiered ''[[American Vampire]]'', a monthly comic book series written by King with short-story writer [[Scott Snyder]], and illustrated by [[Rafael Albuquerque]], which represents King's first original comics work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vertigo.blog.dccomics.com/2009/10/25/scott-snyder-and-stephen-king-to-write-a-new-horror-comic-book-series-american-vampire/ |last=Mullin |first=Pamela|title=SCOTT SNYDER and STEPHEN KING to write a new horror comic book series, AMERICAN VAMPIRE|publisher=Vertigo.blog.dccomics.com |date=October 25, 2009 |accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/091026-american-vampire.html |title=Stephen King Brings an ''American Vampire'' Tale to Vertigo |first=Vaneta |last=Rogers |date=October 26, 2009 |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028231812/http://www.newsarama.com/comics/091026-american-vampire.html |archivedate=October 28, 2009 |dead-url=no |accessdate=April 1, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Vaneta.

During his Chancellor's Speaker Series talk at [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]] on December 7, 2012, King indicated that he was writing a crime novel about a retired policeman being taunted by a murderer. With a working title ''[[Mr. Mercedes]]'' and inspired by a true event about a woman driving her car into a McDonald's restaurant, it was originally meant to be a short story just a few pages long.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uml.edu/Chancellor/Speaker-Series/Stephen-King-Videos.aspx "A Conversation with Stephen King"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215114727/http://www.uml.edu/Chancellor/Speaker-Series/Stephen-King-Videos.aspx |date=December 15, 2012 }}.

==Collaborations==
===Writings===
King has written two novels with horror novelist [[Peter Straub]]: ''[[The Talisman (King and Straub novel)|The Talisman]]'' (1984) and a sequel, ''[[Black House (novel)|Black House]]'' (2001). King has indicated that he and Straub will likely write the third and concluding book in this series, the tale of Jack Sawyer, but has set no deadline for its completion.

King produced an [[artist's book]] with designer [[Barbara Kruger]], ''[[My Pretty Pony]]'' (1989), published in a limited edition of 250 by the Library Fellows of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]]. [[Alfred A. Knopf]] released it in a general trade edition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=11920 |title=The Collection &amp;#124; Barbara Kruger. My Pretty Pony. 1988 |publisher=MoMA |accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the short story was later included in King's collection ''[[Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes]]'' published in 1993.

''[[The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer: My Life at Rose Red]]'' (2001) was a paperback tie-in for the King-penned miniseries ''[[Rose Red (miniseries)|Rose Red]]'' (2002). Published under anonymous authorship, the book was written by Ridley Pearson. The novel is written in the form of a [[diary]] by Ellen Rimbauer, and annotated by the fictional professor of paranormal activity, Joyce Reardon. The novel also presents a fictional [[afterword]] by Ellen Rimbauer's grandson, Steven. Intended to be a promotional item rather than a stand-alone work, its popularity spawned a 2003 prequel television miniseries to ''Rose Red'', titled ''[[The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer (TV film)|The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer]]''. This spin-off is a rare occasion of another author's being granted permission to write commercial work using characters and story elements invented by King. The novel tie-in idea was repeated on Stephen King's next project, the miniseries ''[[Kingdom Hospital]]''. [[Richard Dooling]], King's collaborator on ''Kingdom Hospital'' and writer of several episodes in the miniseries, published a fictional diary, ''The Journals of Eleanor Druse'', in 2004. Eleanor Druse is a key character in ''Kingdom Hospital'', much as Dr. Joyce Readon and Ellen Rimbauer are key characters in ''Rose Red.''

King also wrote the nonfiction book, ''[[Faithful (book)|Faithful]]'' (2004), with novelist and fellow Red Sox fanatic [[Stewart O'Nan]].

''[[Throttle (novella)|Throttle]]'' (2009), a novella written in collaboration with his son [[Joe Hill (writer)|Joe Hill]], appears in the anthology ''He Is Legend: Celebrating Richard Matheson''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gauntletpress.com/cgi-bin/gauntletpress/perlshop.cgi?ACTION=template&amp;thispage=HeisLegend&amp;ORDER_ID=251390396 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511204109/http://www.gauntletpress.com/cgi-bin/gauntletpress/perlshop.cgi?ACTION=template&amp;thispage=HeisLegend&amp;ORDER_ID=251390396 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 11, 2011 |title=Gauntlet Press website, forthcoming titles |publisher=Gauntletpress.com |accessdate=September 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their second novella collaboration, ''[[In the Tall Grass]]'' (2012), was published in two parts in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/june-july-2012-contents |title=June/July 2012 Contents |work=Esquire |date=May 22, 2012 |accessdate=January 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/august-2012-contents |title=August 2012 Contents |work=Esquire |date=July 3, 2012 |accessdate=January 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later released in [[e-book]] and [[audiobook]] formats, the latter read by [[Stephen Lang (actor)|Stephen Lang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1442359889/|title=In the Tall Grass|first1=Stephen|last1=King|first2=Joe|last2=Hill|first3=Stephen|last3=Lang|date=October 9, 2012|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster Audio|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==

===Writing style===
[[File:Stephen_King - 2011.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Stephen King in 2011]]
King's formula for learning to write well is: "Read and write four to six hours a day. If you cannot find the time for that, you can't expect to become a good writer." He sets out each day with a quota of 2000 words and will not stop writing until it is met. He also has a simple definition for talent in writing: "If you wrote something for which someone sent you a check, if you cashed the check and it didn't bounce, and if you then paid the light bill with the money, I consider you talented."&lt;ref&gt;''Everything You Need to Know About Writing Successfully—in Ten Minutes''&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his accident, King wrote the first draft of the book ''[[Dreamcatcher (novel)|Dreamcatcher]]'' with a notebook and a [[Waterman pens|Waterman]] [[fountain pen]], which he called "the world's finest word processor".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =King | first =Stephen | title =Dreamcatcher | publisher=Scribner | year =2001 | isbn = 0-7432-1138-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked why he writes, King responds: "The answer to that is fairly simple—there was nothing else I was made to do. I was made to write stories and I love to write stories. That's why I do it. I really can't imagine doing anything else and I can't imagine not doing what I do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenking.com/pages/FAQ/Stephen_King/whywriter.php |title=Stephen King's official site |accessdate=May 14, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509175239/http://www.stephenking.com/pages/FAQ/Stephen_King/whywriter.php |archivedate=May 9, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also often asked why he writes such terrifying stories and he answers with another question: "Why do you assume I have a choice?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =King | first =Stephen | title =Night Shift | publisher=Doubleday | year =1976 | location =xii | page =336 | isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; King usually begins the story creation process by imagining a "what if" scenario, such as what would happen if a writer is kidnapped by a sadistic nurse in Colorado.&lt;ref name=JennaBlum6&gt;Jenna Blum, 2013, ''The Modern Scholar'' published by Recorded Books, ''The Author at Work: The Art of Writing Fiction'', Disk 1, Track 11, {{ISBN|978-1-4703-8437-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King often uses authors as characters, or includes mention of [[fictional book]]s in his stories, novellas and novels, such as Paul Sheldon who is the main character in ''[[Misery (novel)|Misery]]'', adult Bill Denbrough in ''[[It (novel)|It]]'', Ben Mears in ''[[Salem's Lot]]'', and Jack Torrance in ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]''. He has extended this to breaking the [[fourth wall]] by including ''himself'' as a character in the [[Dark Tower series|''Dark Tower'' series]] from ''[[Wolves of the Calla]]'' onwards. See also [[List of fictional books in the works of Stephen King]] for a complete list. In September 2009 it was announced he would serve as a writer for ''[[Fangoria]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fangoria.com/home/news/1-latest-news/3978-stephen-king-writes-for-fangoria.html Stephen King writes for FANGORIA!] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925002142/http://www.fangoria.com/home/news/1-latest-news/3978-stephen-king-writes-for-fangoria.html |date=September 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===
King has called [[Richard Matheson]] "the author who influenced me most as a writer."&lt;ref name="io9"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://io9.com/r-i-p-richard-matheson-author-of-i-am-legend-and-many-564036878 | title=R.I.P.

[[Ray Bradbury]] is another influence, with King himself stating "without Ray Bradbury, there is no Stephen King".&lt;ref name="nokingquote"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wga.org/writtenby/writtenbysub.aspx?id=4869 | title=Ray Bradbury: A Lion at 90, 91, 92... | publisher=The Writer's Guild of America | accessdate=June 7, 2012 | author=Stayton, Richard | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506210719/http://www.wga.org/writtenby/writtenbysub.aspx?id=4869 | archivedate=May 6, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

King refers to [[H. P. Lovecraft]] several times in ''[[Danse Macabre (book)|Danse Macabre]]''. "[[Gramma (short story)|Gramma]]", a short story made into a film in the 1980s anthology horror show ''[[The New Twilight Zone]]'', mentions Lovecraft's notorious fictional creation ''[[Necronomicon]]'', also borrowing the names of a number of the fictional monsters mentioned therein. "[[I Know What You Need]]" from the 1976 collection ''[[Night Shift (book)|Night Shift]]'', and ''[['Salem's Lot]]'' also mention the tome. Despite this, in ''On Writing'', King is critical of Lovecraft's dialogue-writing skills, using passages from "[[The Colour Out of Space]]" as particularly poor examples.&lt;ref name="UKOnWriting" /&gt;{{rp|143–4}} There are also several examples of King's referring to [[Lovecraftian]] characters and settings in his work, such as [[Nyarlathotep]] and [[Yog-Sothoth]].

King acknowledges the influence of [[Bram Stoker]], particularly on his novel ''Salem's Lot'', which he envisioned as a retelling of ''[[Dracula]]''.&lt;ref&gt;King, Stephen. [http://www.stephenking.com/library/novel/_salem_s_lot_inspiration.html 'Salem's Lot: Inspiration], stephenking.com. Retrieved March 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Its related short story "Jerusalem's Lot" is reminiscent of Stoker's ''[[The Lair of the White Worm]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} He also gives [[Joseph Payne Brennan]] credit for being one of his inspirations; "Joseph Payne Brennan is one of the most effective writers in the horror genre, and he is certainly one of the writers I have patterned my own career upon; one of the writers whom I studied and with whom I kept school."&lt;ref&gt;Spignesi, Stephen J. (Aug 4, 2010).

King's ''The Shining'' is immersed in [[Gothic literature|gothic]] influences, including "[[The Masque of the Red Death]]" by [[Edgar Allan Poe]] (which was directly influenced by the first gothic novel, [[Horace Walpole]]'s ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'').&lt;ref name="Gothic influence"/&gt; The Overlook Hotel acts as a replacement for the traditional gothic castle, and Jack Torrance is a tragic villain seeking redemption.&lt;ref name="Gothic influence"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30313775 "The Castle of Otranto: The creepy tale that launched gothic fiction"]. BBC. Retrieved October 11, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

King has also referred to author [[Shirley Jackson]]. ''Salem's Lot'' opens with a quotation from Jackson's ''[[The Haunting of Hill House]]'', and a character in ''[[The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla|Wolves of the Calla]]'' references the Jackson book ''[[We Have Always Lived in the Castle]]''. King's book ''[[11/22/63]]'' mentions the Jackson story "The Summer People". King is a fan of [[John D. MacDonald]], and dedicated the novella "Sun Dog" to MacDonald, saying "I miss you, old friend." For his part, MacDonald wrote an admiring preface to ''Night Shift'', and even had his famous character, [[Travis McGee]], reading ''Cujo'' in one of the last McGee novels and ''Pet Sematary'' in the last McGee novel, ''The Lonely Silver Rain.''

In 1987, King's [[Philtrum Press]] published [[Don Robertson (author)|Don Robertson]]'s novel ''The Ideal, Genuine Man''. In his forenote to the novel, King wrote, "Don Robertson was and is one of the three writers who influenced me as a young man who was trying to 'become' a novelist (the other two being Richard Matheson and John D. MacDonald)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Robertson | first = Don | authorlink = Don Robertson (author) | title = The Ideal, Genuine Man | publisher=Philtrum Press | year = 1987 | location = Bangor, ME | pages = viiI | url = | id = | isbn = | nopp = true }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s book ''[[The Door into Summer]]'' is repeatedly mentioned in King's ''[[Wolves of the Calla]]'' (2003), as are several other works. ''Wolves of the Calla'' is the King work in which ''The Dark Tower'' begins to follow a meta-fictional path.

In an interview with King, published in the ''[[USA Weekend]]'' in March 2009, the author stated, "People look on writers that they like as an irreplaceable resource. I do. [[Elmore Leonard]], every day I wake up and—not to be morbid or anything, although morbid is my life to a degree—don't see his obituary in the paper, I think to myself, "Great! He's probably working somewhere. He's gonna produce another book, and I'll have another book to read. Because when he's gone, there's nobody else."&lt;ref&gt;"Exclusive: Stephen King on J.K. Rowling, Stephenie Meyer"&lt;/ref&gt;

King partly dedicated his book ''[[Cell (novel)|Cell]]'' to film director [[George Romero]], and wrote an essay for the Elite DVD version of ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]''.
 
His favorite books are (in order): ''[[The Golden Argosy]]''; ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]''; ''[[The Satanic Verses]]''; ''[[McTeague]]''; ''[[Lord of the Flies]]''; ''[[Bleak House]]''; ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''; ''[[The Raj Quartet]]''; ''[[Light in August]]''; and ''[[Blood Meridian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stephen King's Top Ten List (2007)|url=http://www.toptenbooks.net/authors/Stephen-King}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
Although critical reaction to King's work has been mostly positive, he has occasionally come under fire from academic writers.

Science fiction editors [[John Clute]] and [[Peter Nichols]]&lt;ref&gt;Clute, John and Peter Nichols. ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction''. New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 1993. {{ISBN|0-312-09618-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; offer a largely favorable appraisal of King, noting his "pungent prose, sharp ear for dialogue, disarmingly laid-back, frank style, along with his passionately fierce denunciation of human stupidity and cruelty (especially to children) [all of which rank] him among the more distinguished 'popular' writers."

In his book ''The Philosophy of Horror'' (1990), [[Noël Carroll]] discusses King's work as an exemplar of modern horror fiction. Analyzing both the narrative structure of King's fiction and King's non-fiction ruminations on the art and craft of writing, Carroll writes that for King, "the horror story is always a contest between the normal and the abnormal such that the normal is reinstated and, therefore, affirmed."&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Noël (1990) ''The Philosophy of Horror, or, Paradoxes of the Heart''. NY: Routledge, 0-415-90145-6&lt;/ref&gt;

In his analysis of post–World War II horror fiction, ''The Modern Weird Tale'' (2001), critic [[S. T. Joshi]]&lt;ref&gt;Joshi, S.T, ''The Modern Weird Tale: A Critique of Horror Fiction'', McFarland &amp; Company, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-7864-0986-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; devotes a chapter to King's work. Joshi argues that King's best-known works (his supernatural novels), are his worst, describing them as mostly bloated, illogical, maudlin and prone to ''[[deus ex machina]]'' endings. Despite these criticisms, Joshi argues that since ''[[Gerald's Game]]'' (1993), King has been tempering the worst of his writing faults, producing books that are leaner, more believable and generally better written. Joshi suggests that King's strengths as a writer include the accessible "[[everyman]]" quality of his prose, and his unfailingly insightful observations about the pains and joys of adolescence. Joshi cites two early non-supernatural novels—''[[Rage (Stephen King novel)|Rage]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Running Man (novel)|The Running Man]]'' (1982)—as King's best, suggesting both are riveting and well-constructed [[Suspense (genre)|suspense thriller]]s, with believable characters.

In 1996, King won an [[O. Henry Award]] for his short story "[[The Man in the Black Suit]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.com/anchor/ohenry/winners/past.html#jump_k "Past Winners List"]. The PEN/O. Henry Prize Stories. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his short story collection ''A Century of Great Suspense Stories'', editor [[Jeffery Deaver]] noted that King "singlehandedly made popular fiction grow up. While there were many good best-selling writers before him, King, more than anybody since John D. MacDonald, brought reality to genre novels. He has often remarked that ''[['Salem's Lot]]'' was "''[[Peyton Place (novel)|Peyton Place]]'' meets ''Dracula''. And so it was. The rich characterization, the careful and caring social eye, the interplay of story line and character development announced that writers could take worn themes such as vampirism and make them fresh again. Before King, many popular writers found their efforts to make their books serious blue-penciled by their editors. 'Stuff like that gets in the way of the story,' they were told. Well, it's stuff like that that has made King so popular, and helped free the popular name from the shackles of simple genre writing. He is a master of masters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Century of Great Suspense Stories|editor=Jeffrey Deaver|page=290|publisher=Berkley Hardcover|date=2001|ISBN=0-425-18192-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, King was honored by the [[National Book Award]]s with a lifetime achievement award, the Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. Some in the literary community expressed disapproval of the award: [[Richard E. Snyder]], the former CEO of [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], described King's work as "non-literature" and critic [[Harold Bloom]] denounced the choice:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The decision to give the National Book Foundation's annual award for "distinguished contribution" to Stephen King is extraordinary, another low in the shocking process of [[dumbing down]] our cultural life. I've described King in the past as a writer of [[penny dreadful]]s, but perhaps even that is too kind. He shares nothing with [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. What he is&lt;!--not a mistake--&gt; is an immensely inadequate writer on a sentence-by-sentence, paragraph-by-paragraph, book-by-book basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2003/09/24/dumbing_down_american_readers/ |newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]| title=Dumbing down American readers | first=Harold | last=Bloom | date=September 24, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, others came to King's defense, such as writer [[Orson Scott Card]], who responded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let me assure you that King's work most definitely is literature, because it was written to be published and is read with admiration.

King himself later stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Harold] Bloom never pissed me off because there are critics out there, and he's one of them, who take their ignorance about popular culture as a badge of intellectual prowess. He might be able to say that [[Mark Twain]] is a great writer, but it's impossible for him to say that there's a direct line of descent from, say, [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] to [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]] because he doesn't read guys like Thompson. He just thinks, "I never read him, but I know he's terrible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/stephen-king-the-rolling-stone-interview-20141031 |title=Stephen King: The Rolling Stone Interview |publisher=Hatrack.com |accessdate=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[Roger Ebert]]'s review of the 2004 movie ''[[Secret Window]]'', he stated, "A lot of people were outraged that [King] was honored at the National Book Awards, as if a popular writer could not be taken seriously. But after finding that his book ''On Writing'' had more useful and observant things to say about the craft than any book since Strunk and White's ''[[The Elements of Style]]'', I have gotten over my own snobbery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040312/REVIEWS/403120306/1023 |title=Secret Window |work=Chicago Sun-Times |accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, King's book ''On Writing'' was ranked 21st on ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' list of "The New Classics: The 100 Best Reads from 1983 to 2008".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20207076_20207387_20207349,00.html |title=The New Classics: Books &amp;#124; EW 1000: Books &amp;#124; The EW 1000|work=Entertainment Weekly |date=June 27, 2008 |accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances and adaptations in other media==
{{Main|Media based on Stephen King works}}
King and his wife Tabitha own Zone Radio Corp, a radio station group consisting of [[WZON]]/620 AM,&lt;ref&gt;McCrea, Nick. (August 23, 2001), [http://bangordailynews.com/2011/08/23/news/bangor/author-stephen-king-offers-left-leaning-talk-show/ "Stephen King announces new radio show, hopes it will 'burn some feet'"]. ''Bangor Daily News''&lt;/ref&gt; [[WKIT-FM]]/100.3 &amp; [[WZLO]]/103.1.

King has stated that his favorite book-to-film adaptations are ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]'', ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'', and ''[[The Mist (film)|The Mist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[//www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXRuWx-mkTc&amp;feature=related Matt Lauer interview of King] on ''[[The Today Show]]'', YouTube, February 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

King's first film appearance was in [[George A. Romero|George Romero's]] ''[[Knightriders]]'' as a buffoonish audience member. His first featured role was in ''[[Creepshow]]'', in particular the segment "The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill" (King also having written the original story), where he plays the titular character. He has since made cameos in several adaptations of his works. He appeared in ''[[Pet Sematary (1989 film)|Pet Sematary]]'' as a minister at a funeral, in ''[[Thinner (film)|Thinner]]'' as a pharmacist, in ''[[Rose Red (film)|Rose Red]]'' as a pizza deliveryman, as a news reporter in ''The Storm of the Century'', in ''[[The Stand (TV miniseries)|The Stand]]'' as "Teddy Wieszack," in the ''[[The Shining (TV miniseries)|Shining]]'' miniseries as a band member, in ''[[The Langoliers (TV miniseries)|The Langoliers]]'' as Tom Holby; in ''[[Sleepwalkers (film)|Sleepwalkers]]'' as the cemetery caretaker and ''Golden Years'' as a bus driver. He has also appeared in ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'' and, along with fellow author [[Amy Tan]], on ''[[Insane Clown Poppy|The Simpsons]]'' as himself. In addition to acting, King tried his hand at directing with ''[[Maximum Overdrive]]'', in which he also made a cameo appearance as a man using a malfunctioning ATM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-creepiest-thing-about-stephen-king-his-acting-career/|title=The Cocaine-Fueled Acting Cameos Of Stephen King|website=Cracked.com|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; King had also been approached to appear in the 1985 Romero film ''Day of the Dead'' as a zombie. Although King declined due to scheduling conflicts, a copy of one of his works makes an appearance being held by the foremost zombie "Bub". King would once again work with Romero in 1993 when his work ''The Dark Half'' was filmed and directed by George Romero.

King produced and acted in a television series, ''[[Kingdom Hospital]]'', which is based on the Danish miniseries ''[[Riget]]'' by [[Lars von Trier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2004/tv/reviews/stephen-king-s-kingdom-hospital-1200534769/|title=Review: 'Stephen King's Kingdom Hospital'|last=Lowry|first=Brian|date=2004-02-29|work=Variety|access-date=2017-09-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also co-wrote ''[[The X-Files]]'' season-5 episode "[[The X-Files (season 5)#Episodes|Chinga]]" with the creator of the series [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]].

King made an appearance as a contestant on ''[[List of Jeopardy! tournaments and events#Celebrity Jeopardy!|Celebrity Jeopardy!]]'' in 1995, playing to benefit the [[Bangor Public Library]].

King provided the voice of [[Abraham Lincoln]] in the [[audiobook]] version of ''[[Assassination Vacation]]''.

In 2010, King appeared in a cameo role as a [[Cleaner (crime)|cleaner]] named Bachman (a reference to his pen name ''Richard Bachman'') on the [[FX (TV Channel)|FX]] series ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]''.&lt;ref name="Monsters and Critics"&gt;{{cite web| last = Morrison| first = Sara| title = Stephen King guests on Sons of Anarchy for season three| work = [[Monsters and Critics]]| date = May 7, 2010| url = http://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/news/article_1553860.php/Stephen-King-guests-on-Sons-of-Anarchy-for-season-three-UPDATE| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100826150847/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/news/article_1553860.php/Stephen-King-guests-on-Sons-of-Anarchy-for-season-three-UPDATE| archivedate = August 26, 2010| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|Car_accident_and_thoughts_of_retirement}}Car accident and after effects ==
On June 19, 1999, at about 4:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., King was walking on the shoulder of [[Maine State Route 5]], in [[Lovell, Maine]]. Driver Bryan Edwin Smith, distracted by an unrestrained dog moving in the back of his minivan, struck King, who landed in a depression in the ground about 14 feet (four meters) from the pavement of Route 5.&lt;ref name="UKOnWriting" /&gt;{{rp|206}} According to Oxford County Sheriff deputy Matt Baker, King was hit from behind and some witnesses said the driver was not speeding, reckless, or drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liljas-library.com/accident.html|title=King's accident|publisher=Lijia's Library|accessdate=2014-12-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050307182428/http://www.liljas-library.com/accident.html|archivedate=March 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''On Writing'' King states he was heading north, walking against the traffic. Shortly before the accident took place, a woman in a car also northbound passed King first and then the light blue Dodge van. The van was looping from one side of the road to the other and the woman told her passenger she hoped "that guy in the van doesn't hit him."&lt;ref name="UKOnWriting" /&gt;{{rp|206}}

King was conscious enough to give the deputy phone numbers to contact his family, but was in considerable pain. The author was first transported to Northern Cumberland Hospital in Bridgton and then flown by air ambulance to Central Maine Medical Center (CMMC) in [[Lewiston, Maine|Lewiston]]. His injuries—a collapsed right lung, multiple fractures of his right leg, scalp laceration and a broken hip—kept him at CMMC until July 9. His leg bones were so shattered that doctors initially considered amputating his leg, but stabilized the bones in the leg with an [[external fixator]].&lt;ref&gt;Rogak, Lisa. [https://books.google.com/books?id=c8EIvHkg4EYC&amp;pg=PA204 ''Haunted heart: The Life and Times of Stephen King''] at [[Google Books]]. Retrieved September 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; After five operations in 10 days and [[physical therapy]], King resumed work on ''On Writing'' in July, though his hip was still shattered and he could sit for only about 40 minutes before the pain became unbearable.&lt;ref name="UKOnWriting" /&gt;{{rp|216}}

King's lawyer and two others purchased Smith's van for $1,500, reportedly to prevent it from appearing on [[eBay]]. The van was later crushed at a junkyard, much to King's disappointment, as he fantasized about smashing it up. King later mentioned during an interview with ''[[Fresh Air]]'s'' [[Terry Gross]] that he wanted the vehicle destroyed at a charity event in which individuals would donate money for an opportunity to smash it with a sledgehammer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1124785 "Novelist Stephen King"] ''Fresh Air''; [[NPR]] June 22, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dubner, Stephen J.

During this time, Tabitha King was inspired to redesign his studio. King visited the space while his books and belongings were packed away. What he saw was an image of what his studio would look like if he died, providing a seed for his novel ''[[Lisey's Story]]'' (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zrj5n4oC-Wc |title=Origin of Stephen King's novel, LISEY'S STORY|date= December 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The driver of the vehicle that struck King, Bryan Edwin Smith, was found dead at his Maine home in September 2000 in an apparent suicide.&lt;ref name="ABCSuicide"&gt;{{cite news|title=Driver Who Hit Stephen King Dies|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=115390&amp;page=1|accessdate=April 27, 2018|work=ABC News|date=September 25, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{notinsource|date=November 2018}} Smith had told friends shortly before that he "could not face another winter".&lt;ref name="TelegraphDriverSuicide"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harnden|first1=Tony|title=Driver who hit Stephen King is found dead|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1357044/Driver-who-hit-Stephen-King-is-found-dead.html|accessdate=April 27, 2018|work=The Telegraph|date=September 27, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, King announced he would stop writing, apparently motivated in part by frustration with his injuries, which had made sitting uncomfortable and reduced his stamina. He has since resumed writing, but states on his Web site:

{{Quote|I'm writing but I'm writing at a much slower pace than previously and I think that if I come up with something really, really good, I would be perfectly willing to publish it because that still feels like the final act of the creative process, publishing it so people can read it and you can get feedback and people can talk about it with each other and with you, the writer, but the force of my invention has slowed down a lot over the years and that's as it should be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenking.com/pages/FAQ/Stephen_King/retired.php |work=StephenKing.com |title=The Official FAQ: Is it true that you have retired? |accessdate=March 4, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013010729/http://www.stephenking.com/pages/FAQ/Stephen_King/retired.php |archivedate=October 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Political views and activism==
In April 2008, King spoke out against HB 1423, a bill pending in the [[Massachusetts state legislature]] that would restrict or ban the sale of [[Video game controversies|violent video games]] to anyone under the age of 18. Although King stated that he had no personal interest in video games as a hobby, he criticized the proposed law, which he sees as an attempt by politicians to scapegoat pop culture, and to act as surrogate parents to other people's children, which he asserted is usually "disastrous" and "undemocratic." He also saw the law as inconsistent, as it would forbid a 17-year-old, legally able to see ''[[Hostel: Part II]]'', from buying or renting ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'', which is violent but less graphic.  While conceding that he saw no artistic merit in some violent video games, King also opined that such games reflect the violence that already exists in society, which would not be lessened by such a law, and would be redundant in light of the ratings system that already exists for video games. King argued that such laws allow legislators to ignore the economic divide between the rich and poor, and the easy availability of guns, which he felt were the more legitimate causes of violence.&lt;ref&gt;King, Stephen; "Videogame Lunacy"; "The Pop of King" ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''; April 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding video games, he later stated that he enjoys playing [[light gun shooter]] [[arcade game]]s such as ''[[Time Crisis]]''.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite journal|author=King, Stephen|title=Book Review: The Hunger Games|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20223443,00.html|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 8, 2008|accessdate=February 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A controversy emerged on May 5, 2008, when Noel Sheppard posted a clip of King at a [[Library of Congress]] reading event on the Web site NewsBusters. King, talking to high-school students, had said: "If you can read, you can walk into a job later on. If you don't, then you've got the Army, Iraq, I don't know, something like that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.c-spanarchives.org/library/index.php?main_page=product_video_info&amp;products_id=204835-1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518213220/http://www.c-spanarchives.org/library/index.php?main_page=product_video_info&amp;products_id=204835-1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 18, 2008 |title=Discussion on Writing with Stephen King |publisher=C-spanarchives.org |accessdate=September 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The comment was described by the blog as "another in a long line of liberal media members bashing the military," and likened to [[John Kerry]]'s [[John Kerry#.22You get stuck in Iraq.22 controversy|similar remark]] from 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheppard |first=Noel |url=http://newsbusters.org/blogs/noel-sheppard/2008/05/05/writer-stephen-king-if-you-cant-read-youll-end-army-or-iraq |title=Writer Stephen King: If You Can't Read, You'll End Up in the Army or Iraq|publisher=News Busters|date=May 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  King responded later that day, saying, "That a right-wing-blog would impugn my patriotism because I said children should learn to read, and could get better jobs by doing so, is beneath contempt...I live in a national guard town, and I support our troops, but I don't support either the war or educational policies that limit the options of young men and women to any one career—military or otherwise." King again defended his comment in an interview with the ''[[Bangor Daily News]]'' on May 8, saying, "I'm not going to apologize for promoting that kids get better education in high school, so they have more options. Those that don't agree with what I'm saying, I'm not going to change their minds."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressherald.com/archive/stephen-king-fires-back-after-bloggers-criticism_2008-05-06.html "Stephen King fires back after blogger's criticism"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730160328/http://www.pressherald.com/archive/stephen-king-fires-back-after-bloggers-criticism_2008-05-06.html |date=July 30, 2013 }}. ''[[Portland Press Herald]]''. March 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; King later expressed regret for the remark, saying that he misspoke. He characterized the comment as originating from a "brain cramp", and the reality of no longer living in the world he grew up in, saying that during the Vietnam War, serving in the military was a great career for some, and for others, a sacrifice of two years of one's life. King added that he does believe that each person should be obligated to some type of government service or altruism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://features.aol.com/video/what-stephen-king-wishes-he-never-said?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00001346 "What Stephen King wishes he never said"].

King's website states that he is a supporter of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. During the 2008 presidential election, King voiced his support for Democratic candidate [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/175900,stephen-king-backing-barack-obama.html|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729020314/http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/175900,stephen-king-backing-barack-obama.html|deadurl=yes|title=Earth Times: show/175900,stephen-king-backing-barack-obama.html|date=July 29, 2012|archivedate=July 29, 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  King was quoted as calling conservative commentator [[Glenn Beck]] "Satan's mentally challenged younger brother."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David |last=Von Drehle |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1924495-3,00.html |title=Mad Man: Is Glenn Beck Bad for America?|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=September 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 30, 2012, King published an article in ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' calling for rich Americans, including himself, to pay more taxes, citing it as "a practical necessity and moral imperative that those who have received much should be obligated to pay ... in the same proportion".&lt;ref name=DailyBeast&gt;{{cite web|first=Stephen|last=King|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/04/30/stephen-king-tax-me-for-f-s-sake.html |title=Stephen King: Tax Me, for F@%&amp;'s Sake!|work=The Daily Beast|date=March 21, 2011|accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 25, 2013, King published an essay titled "Guns" via [[Amazon.com]]'s [[Kindle single]] feature, which discusses the [[Gun politics in the United States|gun debate]] in the wake of the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]].  King called for gun owners to support a ban on automatic and semi-automatic weapons, writing, "Autos and semi-autos are weapons of mass destruction...When lunatics want to make war on the unarmed and unprepared, these are the weapons they use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carroll|first=Rory|title=Stephen King risks wrath of NRA by releasing pro-gun control essay|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/25/stephen-king-gun-control-essay-amazon-nra|newspaper=The Guardian|date=January 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=King|first=Stephen|title=Stephen King: why the US must introduce limited gun controls|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/01/stephen-king-pulled-book-gun-controls|newspaper=The Guardian|date=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The essay became the fifth-bestselling non-fiction title for the Kindle.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel, Benjamin (February 14, 2013).

===Maine politics===
King had endorsed [[Shenna Bellows]] in the [[United States Senate election in Maine, 2014|2014 U.S. Senate election]] for the seat held by [[Maine Republican Party|Republican]] [[Susan Collins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=King, Stephen |url=http://bangordailynews.com/2014/05/29/opinion/for-this-lifetime-mainer-bellows-is-the-clear-choice/|title=For this lifetime Mainer, Bellows is the clear choice|newspaper=Bangor Daily News|date=May 30, 2014|accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King is a public critic of [[Paul LePage]], the Republican [[Governor of Maine]], and has referred to LePage as one of the [[Three Stooges]], along with [[Governor of Florida|Florida Governor]] [[Rick Scott]] and [[Governor of Wisconsin|Wisconsin Governor]] [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]].&lt;ref name=stooges /&gt;  He was critical of LePage for incorrectly suggesting in a weekly radio address on March 18, 2015, that King avoided paying Maine income taxes by living out of state for part of the year.

The attention garnered by the LePage criticism has led to efforts to encourage King to run for [[Governor of Maine]] in [[Maine gubernatorial election, 2018|2018]].  [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]] city councilor [[Joe Baldacci]] posted on his Facebook page that he was starting a Draft Stephen King effort, and Democratic State Rep. [[Diane Russell]] launched a petition drive to encourage King to run.  His spokeswoman posted to Baldacci's Facebook comment that he would likely decline to run,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stateandcapitol.bangordailynews.com/2015/03/23/stephen-king-for-governor-horror-story-or-best-seller/|title=Stephen King for governor: Horror story or best seller? |publisher=Bangor Daily News |first=Christopher|last=Cousins |date=March 23, 2015 |accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and King himself stated he would not run or serve on March 23 while still criticizing what he said was the "laziness that made him mad" about not checking his tax payments and that LePage had "a problem finding a comfortable pair of big-boy pants".&lt;ref name=kingno&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stateandcapitol.bangordailynews.com/2015/03/23/update-king-continues-attack-on-lepage-says-i-will-not-run-for-governor/ |title=UPDATE: King continues attack on LePage, says 'I will not run' for governor |publisher=Bangor Daily News |first=Christopher |last=Cousins |date=March 23, 2015 |accessdate=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King sent a tweet on June 30, 2015, stating that LePage is "a terrible embarrassment to the state I live in and love. If he won't govern, he should resign." He later clarified that he was not calling on LePage to resign, but to "go to work or go back home."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hashtagmaine.bangordailynews.com/2015/07/01/reddit/stephen-king-joins-call-for-lepage-to-resign/|title=Stephen King joins call for LePage to resign |publisher=Bangor Daily News |first=Erin|last=Rhoda |date=July 1, 2015 |accessdate=July 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 27, 2016, King sent another tweet about LePage, calling him "a bigot, a homophobe, and a racist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2016/08/28/maines-stephen-king-says-gov-paul-lepage-is-a-bigot-a-homophobe-and-a-racist/ |title=Maine's Stephen King says Gov.

==Philanthropy==
King has stated that he donates approximately $4 million per year "to libraries, local fire departments that need updated lifesaving equipment ([[Jaws of Life]] tools are always a popular request), schools, and a scattering of organisations that underwrite the arts."&lt;ref name=DailyBeast /&gt;&lt;ref name="GuardianTax"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/01/stephen-king-tax-the-rich | title=Stephen King: I'm rich, tax me | publisher=The Guardian | date=1 May 2012 | accessdate=30 March 2015 | author=Flood, Alison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stephen and Tabitha King Foundation, chaired by the author and his wife, ranks sixth among Maine charities in terms of average annual giving with over $2.8 million in grants per year, according to [[The Grantsmanship Center]].&lt;ref name="Grantsmanship"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.tgci.com/funding-sources/ME/top | title=Top Giving Foundations: ME | publisher=The Grantsmanship Center | accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the STK Foundation donated $70,000 in matched funding via his radio station to help pay the heating bills for families in need in his home town of Bangor, Maine, during the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alison |last=Flood |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/10/stephen-king-donate-70000-maine?intcmp=239 |title=Stephen King to donate $70,000 to heat Maine homes|newspaper=The Guardian |location=UK |date=November 10, 2011 |accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[Image:Stephenking house.JPG|thumb|300px|King's home in [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]]]]
King married [[Tabitha King|Tabitha Spruce]] in 1971. She too is a novelist and philanthropic activist. The couple own and divide their time between three houses: one in [[Bangor, Maine]], one in [[Lovell, Maine]], and for the winter a waterfront mansion located off the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in [[Sarasota, Florida]]. The Kings have three children, a daughter and two sons, and four grandchildren.&lt;ref name=OfficialBio/&gt; Their daughter Naomi is a [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist Church]] minister in [[Plantation, Florida]], with her lesbian partner, Rev. Dr. Thandeka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riverofgrass.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=27&amp;Itemid=12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502063226/http://www.riverofgrass.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=27&amp;Itemid=12 |archivedate=May 2, 2010 |title=River of Grass Ministry |accessdate=April 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of the Kings' sons are authors: [[Owen King]] published his first collection of stories, ''We're All in This Together: A Novella and Stories'', in 2005. [[Joe Hill (writer)|Joseph Hillstrom King]], who writes as Joe Hill, published a collection of short stories, ''[[20th Century Ghosts]]'', in 2005. His debut novel, ''[[Heart-Shaped Box (novel)|Heart-Shaped Box]]'' (2007), was optioned by Warners Bros.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i24f58f9705c1a288fbb70a9ce94d51e1 |title=Jordan will build 'Box' for Warners |publisher=Hollywood Reporter |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930223244/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i24f58f9705c1a288fbb70a9ce94d51e1 |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

King's addictions to alcohol and other drugs were so serious during the 1980s that, as he acknowledged in ''On Writing'' in 2000, he can barely remember writing ''[[Cujo]]''.&lt;ref name="UKOnWriting" /&gt;{{rp|73}} Shortly after the novel's publication, King's family and friends staged an intervention, dumping on the rug in front of him evidence of his addictions taken from his office including beer cans, cigarette butts, grams of [[cocaine]], [[Alprazolam|Xanax]], [[Valium]], [[NyQuil]], [[dextromethorphan]] (cough medicine) and [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. As King related in his memoir, he then sought help, quit all drugs (including alcohol) in the late 1980s, and has remained sober since.&lt;ref name="UKOnWriting" /&gt;{{rp|72}} The first novel he wrote after becoming sober was ''[[Needful Things]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stephen King, The Art of Fiction No. 189 |work=[[The Paris Review]]|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5653/the-art-of-fiction-no-189-stephen-king|accessdate=June 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King is a fan of baseball, and of the [[Boston Red Sox]] in particular; he frequently attends the team's home and away games, and occasionally mentions the team in his novels and stories. He helped coach his son Owen's Bangor West team to the Maine [[Little League]] Championship in 1989. He recounts this experience in the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' essay "[[Head Down (essay)|Head Down]]", which appears also in the collection ''[[Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes]]''. In 1999, King wrote ''[[The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon]],'' featuring former Red Sox pitcher [[Tom Gordon]] as the protagonist's imaginary companion. In 2004, King co-wrote a book titled ''[[Faithful (book)|Faithful: Two Diehard Boston Red Sox Fans Chronicle the Historic 2004 Season]]'' with [[Stewart O'Nan]], recounting the authors' roller-coaster reaction to the Red Sox's 2004 season, a season culminating in the Sox winning the [[2004 American League Championship Series]] and [[2004 World Series|World Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/BOS/2004.shtml|title=2004 Boston Red Sox Statistics|work=Baseball Reference|accessdate=June 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2005 film ''[[Fever Pitch (2005 film)|Fever Pitch]],'' about an obsessive Boston Red Sox fan, King tosses out the first pitch of the Sox's opening-day game.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3815">The '''Symphony No. 2''' by [[England|English]] [[composer]] [[William Walton]] was commissioned by the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society]] to celebrate the city's 750th anniversary in 1957. The [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra]] conducted by [[John Pritchard (conductor)|John Pritchard]] gave the first performance on 2 September 1960 at the [[Edinburgh International Festival|Edinburgh Festival]]. [[George Szell]] gave the Continental Premiere with the [[Concertgebouw Orchestra]] in Amsterdam on 19 November 1960. Szell also conducted the US Premiere of the work on 29 December 1960 with the Cleveland Orchestra in that city and a few months later they made its first recording. [[Leopold Stokowski]] gave the work another early Continental performance in Vienna in May 1961 while on tour with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]].

The work is in three movements.

# [[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Allegro]] molto
# [[Tempo|Lento]] assai
# [[Passacaglia]]: Theme, Variations, Fugato, and Coda-Scherzando

It is scored for a large symphony orchestra comprising 3 [[flute]]s (3rd doubling [[piccolo]]), 3 [[oboe]]s (3rd doubling [[cor anglais]]), 3 [[clarinet]]s (2nd doubling [[clarinet in E-flat]], 3rd doubling [[bass clarinet]]), 3 [[bassoon]]s (3rd doubling [[contrabassoon]]), 4 [[French horn|horns]], 3 [[trumpet]]s, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], military drum, snare drum, crash cymbals, suspended cymbal, bass drum, glockenspiel, vibraphone, xylophone, tambourine, bell, [[piano]], [[celesta]], 2 [[harp]]s and [[String instrument|strings]].

The symphony was the subject of harsh press criticism on account of its seemingly conservative style at a time when the European avant-garde style was in its ascendance. With time, however, it has been recognised&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/william-walton-the-enfant-terrible-of-oldham-655757.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2017}}&lt;!--As of 15 Sept. 2017, 17:05 BST, this links to a story headlined “Police admit they have no suspects after ‘home-made time bomb’ explodes inside London Tube train”. If this is really a review of Walton's Second Symphony, it is a harsh account, indeed.--&gt; as a mature, subtle and superbly crafted work with many refinements of [[orchestration]], a characteristic of this composer.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Michael (1989). ''Portrait of Walton''. Oxford University Press. pp 211–214&lt;/ref&gt; The finale is notable for its use of a [[twelve-tone]] note-row,{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} a device used in [[twelve-tone technique]].

The '''''taotie''''' is a [[Motif (art)|motif]] commonly found on [[Chinese ritual bronzes|Chinese ritual bronze vessels]] from the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] and [[Zhou dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Woolf2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg Woolf|title=Ancient civilizations: the illustrated guide to belief, mythology, and art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=94NuSg3tlsgC&amp;dq=ancient+civilizations+the+illustrated+guide+mythology&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Taotie+jade+cong|year=2007|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|isbn=978-1-4351-0121-0|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design typically consists of a [[zoomorphic]] mask, described as being frontal,  bilaterally symmetrical, with a pair of raised eyes and typically no lower jaw area. Some argue that the design can be traced back to jade pieces found in Neolithic sites such as the [[Liangzhu culture]] (3310–2250 BC).&lt;ref name="Kesner" /&gt;

In ancient Chinese mythology like "[[Classic of Mountains and Seas]]", the ''''' taotie ''''' ({{linktext|饕餮}}) is one of the "four evil creatures of the world" or four fiends, along with [[Hundun]] ({{linktext|混沌}}), [[:zh:穷奇|Qiongqi]] ({{linktext|窮奇}}) and [[:zh:梼杌|Taowu]] ({{linktext|梼杌}}).&lt;ref&gt;Legge, James. 1872.

==Design==
[[File:Liu Ding part.jpg|thumb|Taotie on a ''[[Ding (vessel)|ding]]'' bronze vessel from late Shang era]]
Scholars have long been perplexed&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allan|1991|p=128}}; Quote: "To some, the problem of meaning has seemed impenetrable"&lt;/ref&gt; over the meaning (if any) of this [[theriomorphic]] design, and there is still no commonly held single answer. The hypotheses range from [[Robert Bagley]]'s belief that the design is a result of the casting process, and rather than having an iconographic meaning was the artistic expression of the artists who held the technological know-how to cast bronze,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Robert | last = Bagley | title = Shang Ritual Bronzes | publisher = The Arthur M. Sackler Foundation | year = 1987 | isbn=978-0-674-80525-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  to theories that it depicts ancient face masks that may have once been worn by either shamans or the god-kings who were the link between humankind and their deceased ancestors (Jordan Paper).

The once-popular belief that the faces depicted the animals used in the sacrificial ceremonies has now more or less been rejected. (Although some faces appear to be oxen, tigers, dragons, etc. some argue{{who|date=March 2016}} that the faces are not meant to depict actual animals, feline or bovine.) Most scholars favor an interpretation that supports the idea that the faces have meaning in a religious or ceremonial context, as the objects they appear on are almost always associated with such events or roles. As one scholar writes "art styles always carry some social references."&lt;ref name="Kesner"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Taotie Reconsidered: Meaning and Functions of the Shang Theriomorphic Imagery | first = Ladislav | last = Kesner | publisher = Artibus Asiae | volume= 51, No. 1/2 | year = 1991 | pages = 29–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is interesting that even Shang divination inscriptions shed no light on the meaning of the ''taotie''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = David | last = Keightley | title= Sources of Shang History: The Oracle-Bone Inscriptions of Bronze Age China' | publisher = University of California Press | year = 1978 | isbn = 0-520-02969-0 | page = 137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
It is not known what word the Shang and Zhou used to call the design on their bronze vessels; as [[Sarah Allan]] notes, there is no particular reason to assume that the term ''taotie'' was known during the Shang.&lt;ref name=allan145&gt;{{harvnb|Allan|1991|p=145,148}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the first known occurrence of this word is in ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'', where it is used to refer to one of the ''four evil creatures of the world'' {{zh|c=四凶|p=sì xiōng}}: a greedy and gluttonous son of the Jinyun clan, who lived during the time of the legendary [[Yellow Emperor]]. The word ''taotie'' itself was glossed by a ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' commentator as "glutton".&lt;ref name=allan145/&gt;

Nonetheless, the association of the term ''taotie'' with the motif on the Zhou (and Shang) bronzes is sufficiently ancient. It  comes from the following passage in the [[Lüshi Chunqiu|Lu’s ''Spring and Autumn Annals'']] (16/3a, "Prophecy"):

{{Quote|The ''taotie'' on Zhou bronzes [''ding''] has a head but no body. When it eats people, it does not swallow them, but harms them.|&lt;ref name=li&gt;{{harvnb|Li|1994}}. The primary source: [[Lüshi Chunqiu|Lu’s ''Spring and Autumn Annals'']], chapter [http://ctext.org/lv-shi-chun-qiu/xian-shi/zh 先識] ("Prophecy"), quote: "周鼎著饕餮，有首無身，食人未咽，害及其身，以言報更也。"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

(In another translation, given in {{harvnb|Allan|1991|p=145}}, the second sentence is translated as follows: "It devoured a man, but before it could swallow it, its own body was damaged".) In Sarah Allan's view, association between gluttony (the meaning in Zuo Zhuan) and the dings' use for food sacrifices to the "insatiable" spirits of the dead is significant.&lt;ref name=allan145/&gt;

[[Li Zehou]] comments on the description of the ''taotie'' in the ''Spring and Autumn Annals'' as follows: 
[[File:Cernuschi Museum 20060812 033.jpg|thumb|A vessel with a ''taotie'' design from [[Cernuschi Museum]]]]
{{quote|It is hard to explain what is implied in this, as so many myths concerning the ''taotie'' have been lost, but the indication that it eats people accords fully with its cruel, fearful countenance. To alien clans and tribes, it symbolized fear and force; to its own clan or tribe, it was a symbol of protection. This religious concept, this dual nature, was crystallized in its strange, hideous features. What appears so savage today had a historical, rational quality in its time. It is for precisely this reason that the savage old myths and legends, the tales of barbarism, and the crude, fierce, and terrifying works of art of ancient clans possessed a remarkable aesthetic appeal. As it was with Homer’s epic poems and African masks, so it was with the ''taotie'', in whose hideous features was concentrated a deep-seated historic force. It is because of this irresistible historic force that the mystery and terror of the ''taotie'' became the beautiful—the exalted.|&lt;ref name=li/&gt;}}

[[Li Zehou]] further notes,  "Some scholars consider that the meaning of '''taotie'' is not "eating people" but making a mysterious communication between people and Heaven (gods)."&lt;ref name=li/&gt;

==Later interpretations==
During the [[Ming dynasty]], a number of scholars compiled lists of traditional motifs seen in architecture and applied art, which eventually became codified as the [[Nine sons of the dragon|Nine Children of the Dragon]] (龍生九子). In the earliest known list of this type (in which the creatures are not yet called "children of the dragon", and there are 14 of them, rather than 9), given by [[Lu Rong]]  (1436–1494) in his ''Miscellaneous records from the bean garden'' (菽园杂记, ''Shuyuan Zaji''), the ''taotie'' appears with a rather unlikely description, as a creature that likes water and depicted on bridges.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lu Rong]]'s  ''Shuyuan Zaji'' is quoted in  [[#yang2008|Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong (2008)]]: "饕餮性好水，故立桥所。". The full text of ''Shuyuan Zaji'' can be found at a number of sites online, e.g. here: [http://xxgblog.tcip.net.cn/index.php/56/viewspace-3024.html  菽園雜記] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306151643/http://xxgblog.tcip.net.cn/index.php/56/viewspace-3024.html |date=2010-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a well-known later list of the Nine Children of the Dragon given by [[Yang Shen]] (1488–1559) accords with both the ancient and the modern usage of the term:

{{quote|The ''taotie'' likes to eat and drink; it used to  appear on the surface of the ''[[ding (vessel)|ding]]s''.|&lt;ref&gt;[[Yang Shen]]'s ''Sheng'an Ji'' (升庵集) quoted in  [[#yang2008|Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong (2008)]]: "饕餮好饮食，故立于鼎盖。"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some scholars believed that the Taotie motif is a reference to [[Chi You]] and is used to serve as a warning to people who covet power and wealth.&lt;ref name="Brnz"&gt;{{cite book|title=Chinese Brozes: Ferocious Beauty|author1=Wangheng Chen |author2=Various |publisher=Asiapac Books Pte Ltd|year=2001|ISBN=9789812290205|url=http://www.google.ca/books?id=6yCq-NEdKeUC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=hundun+taotie|pages=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Book of Imaginary Beings]]'' (1957) [[Jorge Luis Borges]] interpreted the figures as representing a dog-headed, double-bodied monster that represented greed and gluttony.

==In popular culture==
The Tao Tie (spelled as "Tao Tei") are the primary antagonists in the 2016 historical-fantasy epic film ''[[The Great Wall (film)|The Great Wall]]''. In the film, they are depicted as green-skinned quadrupedal aliens, with shark-like teeth, eyes located on their shoulders, and the Tao Tie motif visible on their heads. They are shown living in a eusocial hive similar to ants, where they attack the capital of China every sixty years to collect food to feed their queen.&lt;ref&gt;http://fm.kuac.org/post/great-wall-stands-monument-absurd-cgi-clutter&lt;/ref&gt;

Taotie is the name of a warthog [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Enemies|enemy character]] in [[DreamWorks]]' animated series ''[[Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness]].''

Taotie, Shadow of the Yang Zing is a [[dragon]]-like creature in the [[trading card game]] [[Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]

[[Image:Ten American Painters (The Ten).jpg|thumb|right|The Ten in 1908]]

'''The Ten American Painters''' (also known as '''The Ten''') was an artists' group formed in 1898 to exhibit their work as a unified group. [[John Henry Twachtman]], [[J. Alden Weir]], and [[Childe Hassam]] were the driving forces behind the organization. Dissatisfied with the conservatism of the American art establishment, the three artists recruited seven others from Boston, New York City, and elsewhere on the East Coast, with the intention of creating an exhibition society that valued their view of originality, imagination, and exhibition quality. The Ten achieved popular and critical success,&lt;ref&gt;“Ten American Painters: The First Exhibition, Catalogue of the Pictures, from the Thomas Wilmer Dewing and Dewing Family Papers - Image and Media Gallery | Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution.” Accessed September 16, 2015. http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/items/detail/ten-american-painters-first-exhibition-catalogue-pictures-14281.&lt;/ref&gt; and lasted two decades before dissolving.

==Foundation==
In America, popular painting styles usually originated on the east coast in cities like New York and Boston. The Ten continued a tradition of artists forming new groups  in reaction to a lack of support from existing artists' groups. Thus, the [[National Academy of Design]] (founded in 1825 by students dissatisfied by the conservatism of the older [[American Academy of the Fine Arts]]) eventually became too conservative to suit the artists who in 1877 initiated the [[Society of American Artists]] so they could meet and exhibit their work as a collective. The Ten American Painters was born from this group in 1898, when Twachtman, Weir, and Hassam found the Society hostile to the [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] style they had adopted. Leaving the group was considered a bold move by the general public, but the Society of American Artists felt that it was easier to let the members that were leaving go than appease them.

==Impressionism==
[[Impressionism]] was a French art movement that emerged in the 1870s, and was picked up by American painters towards the end of the 19th century. Painters like [[Edgar Degas]], [[Claude Monet]] and [[Auguste Renoir]] are generally considered the masters of the impressionist movement. An Impressionist painting will often use small dabs of color in order to make the painting distinguishable from afar, but indistinguishable from up close.&lt;ref&gt;“Impressionism.” Accessed September 21, 2015. http://www.artmovements.co.uk/impressionism.htm.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
The founding members of The Ten were [[Frank Weston Benson|Frank W. Benson]], [[Joseph Rodefer DeCamp]], [[Thomas Wilmer Dewing]], [[Childe Hassam]], [[Willard Leroy Metcalf]], [[Robert Reid (painter)|Robert Reid]], [[Edward Simmons (painter)|Edward Simmons]], [[Edmund C. Tarbell]], [[John Henry Twachtman]], and [[J. Alden Weir]]. All were former members of the Society of American Artists. [[Winslow Homer]] declined an invitation to join the group; [[Abbott Handerson Thayer]] accepted membership but withdrew before the group's first exhibition. After J. H. Twachtman died in 1902, [[William Merritt Chase]] joined in his place. Unanimous approval was required to admit a new member to the society.&lt;ref name=Brockett&gt;{{cite web|last=Brockett|first=Erik|title=The Ten American Painters|url=http://www.antiquesandfineart.com/articles/article.cfm?request=844|publisher=Antiques &amp; Fine Art Magazine|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also decided that there would never be less than ten members active for the group to remain as one. 

For twenty years The Ten exhibited in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and other American cities. After this it dissolved due to death in its ranks and lack of public interest.&lt;ref name=Brockett&gt;{{cite web|last=Brockett|first=Erik|title=The Ten American Painters|url=http://www.antiquesandfineart.com/articles/article.cfm?request=844|publisher=Antiques &amp; Fine Art Magazine|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Minpins''''' is a book by [[Roald Dahl]] with illustrations by Patrick Benson. It was published in 1991, a few months after Dahl's death in November 1990, and is the author's final contribution to literature after an illustrious career spanning almost half a century. The book was republished in 2017 under the title '''''Billy and the Minpins''''' with new illustrations by [[Quentin Blake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-41189188|title=Sir Quentin Blake illustrates Roald Dahl's final book, 26 years on|publisher=BBC News|date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Little Billy is forbidden by his mother to enter the Forest of Sin behind his house.  She tells him of the [[Whangdoodle]], Hornswogglers, Snozzwanglers and [[Vermicious knids]] that live in the forest.  Worst of all is the Terrible Blood-suckling Tooth-puckling Stone-chuckling Spittler, who chases his prey while glowing clouds of hot smoke pour out of his nose, and then swallows them up in one gulp.  Little Billy doesn't believe his mother, and the Devil whispers to Little Billy that the monsters don't exist, and there is a plethora of luscious wild strawberries in the forest.  Soon, Little Billy is walking through the forest when he hears something coming after him, and runs to escape it.  As he looks back, he sees puffs of orange-red smoke catching up with him.  

He escapes what he is sure must be the Spittler by climbing up a tree as high and as fast as he can.  When he comes to a rest, he notices windows opening all over the branches, and discovers a whole city of little people, the Minpins, living inside the tree.  The leader of the Minpins, Don Mini, tells Little Billy that the monster waiting under the tree is not the Spittler (which the Minpins have never heard of), but the Red-Hot Smoke-Belching Gruncher, who grunches up everything in the forest.  It seems that there is no way for Little Billy to safely get down from the tree and return home.  

But upon learning of the close friendship between the Minpins and birds, Little Billy devises a plan to rid the forest of the Gruncher: Little Billy flies on the back of a swan and uses his scent to lure the Gruncher into a lake.  The water of the lake puts out the fire in the Gruncher's belly, killing him.  The Minpins are grateful to Little Billy for ridding the forest of their tormentor.  They reward him by sending the swan to serve as Little Billy's own personal transport every night, which he uses to explore the world and to continue his newfound friendship with the Minpins.

'''''Thor Battering the Midgard Serpent''''' is a 1790 painting by the Swiss artist [[Henry Fuseli]]. It depicts one of the most popular myths in Germanic mythology, [[Thor]]'s fishing trip, which was known to Fuseli through P. H. Mallet's 1755 book ''Introduction à l'histoire du Dannemarc'', translated to English by Thomas Percy in 1770 as ''Northern Antiquities''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vads.ac.uk/large.php?uid=190562|title=Thor Battering the Midgard Serpent|work=[[VADS (organisation)|VADS]]|accessdate=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nude and muscular Thor stands in [[Hymir]]'s boat with the [[Jörmungandr]] on his fish hook.

The painting was Fuseli's diploma work for his election to the British [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1790. The subject has been interpreted in relation to Fuseli's support for the [[French Revolution]], where the serpent could represent the [[Ancien Régime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.racollection.org.uk/ixbin/indexplus?_IXSR_=7KTmL9VfZZ8&amp;_IXSP_=33&amp;_MREF_=20389&amp;_IXSS_=work_date%3d%26%252asform%3d%252fsearch_form%252fworksform%26_IXresults_%3dy%26title%3d%26_IXACTION_%3dquery%26artist_role_sval%3d%26all_fields%3d%26submit%3dSearch%26sort_by%3d%26_IXTRAIL_%3dSearch%2bWorks%2bof%2bArt%257cSearch%2bResults%26type%3d%26_IXSP_%3d0%26artist_name%3dHENRY%2bFUSELI%26_IXMAXHITS_%3d18&amp;_IXACTION_=display&amp;_IXSPFX_=templates/full/|title=Thor battering the Midgard Serpent, 1790|publisher=[[Royal Academy of Arts]]|accessdate=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Women in society sidebar}}
'''Women in architecture''' have been documented for many centuries, as professional (or amateur) practitioners, educators and clients. Since architecture became organized as a  profession in 1857, the number of women in architecture has been low.  At the end of the 19th century, starting in Finland, certain [[List of international architecture schools|schools of architecture]] in Europe began to admit women to their programmes of study. In 1980  
[[M. Rosaria Piomelli]], born in Italy, became the first woman to hold a deanship of any school of architecture in the United States, as Dean of the [[City College of New York]] School of Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital-archives.ccny.cuny.edu/exhibits/fiftyexhibit/rosaria_piomelli.html |title=rosaria_piomelli |publisher=Digital-archives.ccny.cuny.edu |date=1937-10-24 |accessdate=2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only in recent years have women begun to achieve wider recognition with several outstanding participants including two [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker prizewinners]] since the turn of the millennium.

==Early examples==
Two European women stand out as early examples of women playing an important part in architecture, designing or defining the development of buildings under construction. In France, [[Katherine Briçonnet]] (ca. 1494–1526) was influential in designing the [[Château de Chenonceau]] in the [[Loire Valley]], supervising the construction work between 1513 and 1521 and taking important architectural decisions while her husband was away fighting in the Italian wars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k870051/f856 M. E. Aubry-Vitet, "Chenonceau"], in ''Revue des deux mondes'', no 69 (1867), p.855. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Great Britain|Britain]], there is evidence that [[Elizabeth Wilbraham|Lady Elizabeth Wilbraham]] (1632–1705) studied the work of the Dutch architect [[Pieter Post]] as well as that of [[Andrea Palladio|Palladio]] in [[Veneto]], Italy, and the [[Landshut Residence|Stadtresidenz]] at Landshut, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;John Millar [http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/critics/the-first-woman-architect/8608009.article ''The first woman architect''], The Architects' Journal, 11 November 2010. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; She has been put forward as the architect of [[Wotton House]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] and of many other buildings. It has also been suggested that she tutored [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]].  Wilbraham had to use male architects to supervise the construction work.&lt;ref name="Indy first lady"&gt;Jay Merrick [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/architecture/elizabeth-wilbraham-the-first-lady-of-architecture-2215936.html ''Elizabeth Wilbraham, the first lady of architecture''], The Independent, 16 February 2011. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; There is now much research including that by [[John Millar (historian)|John Millar]]&lt;ref name="Indy first lady" /&gt; to show she may have designed up to 400 buildings including 18 London churches previously attributed to her pupil  Sir Christopher Wren.

Towards the end of the 18th century, another Englishwoman, [[Mary Townley (architect)|Mary Townley]] (1753–1839), tutored by the artist [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]], designed several buildings in [[Ramsgate]] in south-eastern England including [[Townley House]] which is considered to be an architectural gem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaelsbookshop.com/blogpicts2/townley.htm Paul Nettleingham, "Townley House in Ramsgate"], ''Michaels Bookshop Ramsgate''. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sarah Losh]] (1785-1853) was an English woman and landowner of [[Wreay]].  She has been described as a lost [[Romanticism|Romantic]] genius, antiquarian, architect and visionary.  Her main work is [[St Mary's Church (Wreay)]], Cumbria, but she also constructed various associated buildings and monuments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stmaryswreay.org/ St Mary's Church Wreay] (Accessed Sept 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jenny Uglow|Uglow, Jenny]] (2012) ''The Pinecone'', Faber and Faber&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[J.B.

==Modern pioneers==
Yet another Englishwoman, [[Sophy Gray (architect)|Sophy Gray]] (1814–1871), wife of [[Robert Gray (bishop of Cape Town)|Robert Gray]] who became bishop of [[Cape Town]] in 1847, proved to be a competent assistant, not only helping her husband with his administrative and social obligations but above all by designing at least 35 of the [[South Africa]]n Anglican churches completed between 1848 and 1880, all in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style in which she showed strong interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artefacts.co.za/main/Buildings/archframes.php?archid=643 "Gray, Sophia (Sophie) Wharton Myddleton"], ''ArteFacts''. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The daughter of a French-Canadian carriage maker, [[Mother Joseph Pariseau]] (1823–1902) was not just one of the very earliest female architects in North America but a pioneer in the architecture of the north-western United States. In 1856, together with four sisters from [[Montreal]], she moved to [[Vancouver, Washington]] where she designed eleven hospitals, seven academies, five schools for [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] children, and two orphanages in an area encompassing today's [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington State]], northern [[Oregon]], [[Idaho]], and [[Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/nsh/joseph_m.cfm "Mother Joseph", ''Architect of the Capitol'']. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louise Blanchard Bethune]] (1856–1913) from [[Waterloo (town), New York|Waterloo, New York]], was the first American woman known to have worked as a professional architect. In 1876, she took a job working as a draftsman in the office of [[Richard A. Waite]] and F.W. Caulkings in [[Buffalo, New York]] where she worked for five years, demonstrating she could hold her own in what was a masculine profession. In 1881, she opened an independent office partnered with her husband Robert Bethune in Buffalo, earning herself the title as the nation's first professional woman architect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.arch.uiuc.edu/organizations/wia/timeline/bethunelouise.html "Louise Blanchard Bethune (1856-1913)"], ''Women in Architecture (University of Illinois)''.

Another early practicing architect in the United States was [[Emily Williams (architect)|Emily Williams]] (1869–1942) from northern California. In 1901, together with her friend Lillian Palmer, she moved to [[San Francisco]] where she studied drafting at the [[Lick-Wilmerding High School|California High School of Mechanical Arts]]. Encouraged by Palmer, she went on to build a number of cottages and houses in the area, including a family home on 1037 Broadway in San Francisco, now a listed building.&lt;ref name=Horton&gt;[http://www.womenarchitectsca.com/sample-biographies/emily-williams/ Inge S.

[[Theodate Pope Riddle]] (1868–1946) grew up in a well-to-do background in Farmington, Connecticut, where she hired faculty members to tutor her in architecture. Her early designs, such as that for [[Hill-Stead Museum|Hill-Stead]] (1901), were translated into working drawings by the firm of [[McKim, Mead and White]], providing her with an apprenticeship in architecture. She was the first woman to become a licensed architect in both New York and Connecticut and in 1926 was appointed to the AIA College of Fellows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arvha.asso.fr/archi_fem/arvha_french/info_arvha/document_info/us-archi.html "Women in Architecture"], ''ARVHA''. Retrieved 17 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable pioneer of the early days was [[Josephine Wright Chapman]] (1867–1943). Chapman received no formal education in architecture but went on design a number of buildings before setting up her own firm. The architect of [[Tuckerman Hall]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], she is considered to be one of America's earliest and most successful female architects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuckermanhall.org/chapmanfull.pdf "Josephine Wright Chapman and Tuckerman Hall"], ''Tuckermanhall.org''. Retrieved 17 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanian architect [[Virginia Andreescu Haret]] (1894–1962), first woman to graduate with a degree in architecture in 1919 and first woman as Romanian Architectural Inspector General. She continued her studies in [[Italy]]. 
She worked at the Technical Service of the Ministry of Education, for which reason she did numerous and important projects for schools, in [[Bucharest]] (Şincai and Cantemir Lyceum) as well as in the country (Bârlad, Focşani). Side by side with buildings of large dimensions, she also designed houses for one or two persons. The mobility did not stop at the studies in Italy, she was present also at numerous congresses of architecture in Rome, Paris, Moscow, Bruxelles ...

A highly influential player was [[Mary Colter]] (1869–1958). After studying at the [[California School of Design]] in [[San Francisco]], she was employed by the [[Fred Harvey Company]], first for interior design but soon to take on ambitious architectural projects, including landmark hotels and [[wikt:Special:Search/rustic|Rustic]] lodges in the Southwest, several in Grand Canyon National Park. She often used Native American motifs (and artisans) while blending the regional [[Spanish Colonial Revival Style]] and [[Pueblo Revival Style architecture|Pueblo Revival Style]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilsonquarterly.com/article.cfm?AID=6694&amp;AT=1 A.

==First academic qualifications==

===Finland===

Finland is the country in which women were first permitted to undertake architectural studies and receive academic qualifications&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arvha.asso.fr/archi_fem/arvha_french/info_arvha/document_info/paivi_nikkanen_uk.htm Päivi Nikkanen-Kalt, "Female architects in Finland"], ''ARVHA''. Retrieved 23 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; even if they were initially given the status of special students. The earliest record belongs to [[Signe Hornborg]] (1862–1916) who attended the [[Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture|Helsinki Polytechnic Institute]] from the spring of 1888, graduating as an architect in 1890 "by special permission".  She does not, however, appear to have acted as an independent architect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architekturarchiv-web.de/frauen.htm Karl Heinz Hoffmann and Anika Hakl, "Frauen und Häuser"], ''Hamburgisches Architekturarchiv der Hamburgischen Architektenkammer''. {{de icon}} Retrieved 18 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Other graduates in architecture at the Polytechnic Institute in the 1880s include Inez Holming, Signe Lagerborg, Bertha Enwald, Stina Östman and [[Wivi Lönn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecta.fi/sivu.php?sivu=historia "Perustaminen: Nainen arkkitehtina"], ''Architecta''. {{fi icon}} Retrieved 18 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lönn (1872–1966), who attended the institute from 1893 to 1896, has the honour of being the first woman to work independently as an architect in Finland. On graduating, she immediately established her own architectural firm by receiving a commission to design the building of a Finnish-language girls' school in Tampere. She designed several significant public buildings, including more than thirty school buildings. Lönn won five architectural competitions alone, including the municipal fire-station in Tampere in 1906, an unusual design for a woman at that time. Lönn won two competitions with [[Armas Lindgren]] with him she designed the [[New Student House, Helsinki|New Student House]] in [[Helsinki]] (1910) and the [[Estonia Theatre]] in [[Tallinn]] (1913). One of her last was the Sodankylä Geophysical Observatory, completed in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/english/?id=3438 "Lönn, Wivi (1872 - 1966)"], ''Biografiakeskus''. Retrieved 17 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hilda Hongell]] (1867–1952), from Finland's [[Åland Islands]], became a special student at Helsinki Industrial School in 1891 at a time when only men could attend the institution. Following excellent results, she was accepted as a regular student the following year and graduated as a "master builder" in 1894. She went on to design 98 buildings in the [[Mariehamn]] district of the Åland Islands, mostly town houses and farm houses in the ornamental Swiss style. However, she did not qualify as an architect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mariehamn.ax/Kulturforvaltningen/Stadens_historia/Hilda_Hongell_ "Hilda Hongell"], ''Mariehamns stad''. {{sv icon}} Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other early graduates===

[[Fay Kellogg]] (1871–1918) learnt her architectural skills with a German tutor who taught her drafting, at the [[Pratt Institute]] in Brooklyn, and by working with Marcel de Monclos in his Paris atelier. She had hoped to study at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] but as a woman was refused admission. As a result of her efforts, however, the institution later opened its doors to women wishing to study architecture. On her return to the United States, Kellogg helped design the [[Surrogate's Courthouse|Hall of Records]] in Lower Manhattan before opening a studio of her own. She went on to design hundreds of buildings in the New York area, encouraging the [[New York Times]] to describe her as "one of the most successful woman architects in America".&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/11/17/106768465.pdf "Woman Invades Field of Modern Architecture"], ''The New York Times'', November 17, 1907. Retrieved 17 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julia Morgan]] (1872–1957) was more successful as she was the first woman to receive a degree in architecture from the École des Beaux-Arts. She was initially refused admission as a woman in 1896 but reapplied and was successfully admitted in 1898. After graduating in 1901, she returned to California where she had a prolific and innovative career, blazing new paths professionally, stylistically, structurally, and aeshetically, setting high standards of excellence in the profession.  Completing over 700 projects, she is especially known for her work for women's organizations and key clients, including [[Hearst Castle]] in [[San Simeon, California|San Simeon]], considered to be one of her masterpieces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070623083708/http://capitolmuseum.ca.gov/english/remarkable/panel4.html "Julia Morgan, Early Architect, 1872-1957"], ''California State Capitol Museum''. Retrieved 17 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first woman architect licensed in California. [[Mary Rockwell Hook]] (1877–1978) from [[Kansas]] also traveled to study architecture at the École des Beaux-Arts where she suffered from discrimination against women after sitting for examinations.  She was not successful in gaining admittance, and returned to America in 1906, where she did practice architecture. She designed the [[Pine Mountain Settlement School]] in [[Kentucky]] as well as a number of buildings in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] where she was the first architect to incorporate the natural terrain into her designs and the first to use cast-in-place concrete walls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spec.lib.vt.edu/IAWA/news/news3.html "Mary Rockwell Hook"], ''International Archive of Women in Architecture''.

[[Isabel Roberts]] (1871–1955), born in [[Missouri]], studied architecture in New York City at the Masqueray-Chambers Atelier, established by [[Emmanuel Louis Masqueray]] along the lines of the French École des Beaux-Arts. It was the first studio in the United States specifically established to teach the practice of architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0E11F7395F1B7A93C5AB178ED85F438185F9 "Noted Architect Dead.

[[Esther Hill|Esther Marjorie Hill]] was the first woman to graduate from a Canadian architecture school, in 1920.

==European developments==
After Finland, several other European countries allowed women to study architecture. In [[Norway]], the first female architect was [[Lilla Hansen]] (1872–1962) who studied at the Royal Drafting School (''Den Kongelige Tegneskole'') in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] (1894) and served architectural apprenticeships in Brussels, Kristiania and Copenhagen. She established her own practice in 1912 and gained immediate success with Heftyeterrassen, a [[Baroque Revival architecture|Neo-baroque]] residential complex in Oslo. She went on to design a number of large villas as well as student accommodation for women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Lilla_Hansen/utdypning "Lilla Hansen"], ''Store Norske Leksikon''. {{no icon}} Retrieved 18 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first woman to run an architecture practice in [[Germany]] was [[Emilie Winkelmann]] (1875−1951). She studied architecture as a guest student registered as Student Emil at the [[University of Hanover|College of Technology]] in [[Hanover]] (1902–1908) but was refused a diploma as women were not entitled to the qualification until 1909. Working from her practice in Berlin where she employed a staff of 15, she completed some 30 villas before the outbreak of war.

She received her degree from the [[Technical University of Darmstadt]] in 1913. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.zeit.de/2013/38/erste-ingenieurin-frauen-karriere|title=Ingenieurswissenschaften: Fräulein Diplom-Ingenieur|work=ZEIT ONLINE|access-date=2018-05-25|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Serbia]], [[Jelisaveta Načić]] (1878–1955) studied architecture at the [[University of Belgrade]] at a time when it was felt that women should not enter the profession. At the age of 22, she was the first woman to graduate from the Faculty of Engineering. As a woman, she was unable to obtain the ministerial post she sought but gained employment with the [[Belgrade|Municipality of Belgrade]] where she became chief architect. Among her notable achievements are the well-proportioned Kralj Petar I (King Peter I) elementary school (1906) and the Moravian-styled Alexander Nevsky Church (1929), both in Belgrade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sajkaca.blogspot.com/2009/01/alexander-nevsky-church-in-belgrade_12.html "Alexander Nevsky Church in Belgrade"], Nothing Against Serbia.

==Male and female professional partnerships==
[[File:Alvar and Elissa Aalto.jpg|thumb|Alvar and Elissa Aalto (1950s)]]
A number of the more important women architects in the first half of the 20th century partnered with men, often forming husband-and-wife practices.&lt;ref name="Anthony"&gt;Kathryn H. Anthony, "Designing for Diversity: Gender, Race, and Ethnicity in the Architectural Profession", University of Illinois Press (2001), p. 56 et seq., {{ISBN|0-252-02641-1}} (online here [https://books.google.com/books?id=qqo2LXIaW7YC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=architecture+husband+wife+partners&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WjXomoDx7f&amp;sig=aY4NpsdR3jJwZoBdMpkR9RbRJ4w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y72ST7jNEcnN0QX7gaH9AQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=architecture%20husband%20wife%20partners&amp;f=false]).&lt;/ref&gt; Such partnerships began in the early years of women's involvement when some of the most successful male architects worked with women. Since the 1960s, which saw increased enrollment by women into schools of Architecture, male and female students have often met and later married; long hours working together and a shared passion have been described as "the perfect prescription for romance".&lt;ref name="Anthony 56"&gt;Anthony, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; A good overview of this topic is also discussed in Ann Forsyth's "In Praise of Zaha" &lt;ref name=Forsyth&gt;{{cite journal|title=In Praise of Zaha |date=2006-09-27 |doi=10.1111/j.1531-314X.2006.00082.x |volume=60 |issue=2 |journal=Journal of Architectural Education |pages=63–65|last1 = Forsyth|first1 = Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Male-female partnerships in architecture sometimes lead to misattribution of the work to the male partner, often because the male is better known. This can be seen as the result of an underlying discrimination or biased attitude. What has been described as the "tradition of misattribution" has remained a "secret" until recent years.&lt;ref name="Anthony 56-57"&gt;Anthony, p. 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some particularly notable male-female partnerships in architecture include:

* [[Aino Aalto]] (1894-1949) and [[Alvar Aalto]] - after qualifying as an architect in Finland in 1920, she married Alvar Aalto in 1923 and participated in the design of his earlier buildings, often contributing to the interiors as in the [[Villa Mairea]] (1937) in [[Noormarkku]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alvaraalto.fi/info/press/09eng_villa-mairea.htm "Internet exhibition on Alvar Aaltos Villa Mairea"], ''Alvar Aalto''. Retrieved 21 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Reima and Raili Pietilä]], another Finnish couple, worked closely together developing their early Modernistic style. Raili Pietilä (born 1926) found two the perfect number for a design team, explaining: "We often took our work with us: for a walk, in the kitchen, and in the evenings. And when doing competitions we used to take trips, like long train journeys, because we found that changing your environment affects your thinking."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metropolismag.com/story/20080424/breaking-the-modernist-mold David Sokol, "Breaking the Modernist Mold: Raili Pietilä reflects on a life of design with her husband, Reima, and the new exhibition that examines the Pietilä legacy"], ''Metropolismag.com'', 24 April 2008.

* French architect and designer [[Charlotte Perriand]] (1903–1999) established a partnership with an icon of [[modern architecture]], [[Le Corbusier]], contributing to the development of functional living spaces, especially by designing interiors and furniture for his buildings. She later recalled how Le Corbusier insisted on strict adherence to his demanding principles: "The smallest pencil stroke had to have a point, to fulfil a need, or respond to a gesture or posture, and to be achieved at mass-production prices." After collaborating with Le Corbusier for about ten years, Perriand left his studio in 1937 to concentrate on furniture design, often working with [[Jean Prouvé]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://designmuseum.org/design/charlotte-perriand "Charlotte Perriand, Architect + Furniture Designer (1903-1999)"], ''Design Museum''.

In addition to designs of her own including many streamlined private homes, it was Elizabeth who ran the firm in her husband's absence during the Second World War and while he was busy constructing the [[University of Minnesota]] campus. The architectural historian Jane King Hession remarked: "By her example she inspired many women in architecture, myself included, but she didn't want to be known as a woman architect — just as an architect who happened to be a woman."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uminnpressblog.com/2010/08/then-and-now-old-gray-heads-part-two.html "Then and Now: 'Old Gray Heads,' part two -- Elizabeth Close"], ''University of Minnesota Press''.

She worked for various architectural firms in [[Australia]] (1931-1936) and the UK (1937), and traveled Europe meeting many key Modernist architects. After working for others again in Australia (1938), she formed an architectural firm, Romberg &amp; Shaw, with the Modernist architect [[Frederick Romberg]]. The firm operated from 1939 to 1942.

*[[Denise Scott Brown]] (born 1931) and [[Robert Venturi]] met at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1960. Shortly after their marriage in 1967, Scott Brown joined his [[Philadelphia]] firm Venturi and Rauch, where she became principal in charge of planning in 1969. She has since played a major role at the firm (renamed Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates in 1989) leading civic planning projects and studies, and collaborating with Venturi on the firm's larger projects. She is however resentful of the fact that she is seldom credited for her work. For example, it was her husband who was awarded the Pritzker Prize in 1991 although she explains: "We both design every inch of a building together." In 1997 she speculated: "The question of being a woman will be in the air for ever in my case. If I had not married Bob, would I have gone further or not? Who can tell? But the same question holds for him. If he had not married me, would he have gone further?"&lt;ref name=Anthony/&gt; Denise Scott Brown also disclosed her feelings about this situation in a chapter of "Gender Space Architecture".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender space architecture an interdisciplinary introduction|url = http://public.eblib.com/choice/publicfullrecord.aspx?p=169967|publisher = Routledge|date = 2000-01-01|location = London; New York|isbn = 9780203449127 |first = Jane|last = Rendell|first2 = Barbara|last2 = Penner|first3 = Iain|last3 = Borden|pages = 229, 263|chapter = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although until recently their contributions have been largely unnoticed, women have in fact exerted a fair amount of influence on architecture over the past century. It was [[Susan Lawrence Dana House|Susan Lawrence Dana]], heiress to a mining fortune, who in 1902 chose to have her house in [[Springfield, Illinois]], designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], so ensuring his breakthrough. Women have also played a key role in historic preservation through organizations such as the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] (1890).&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn H.

A study on experience in Canada highlights the widespread contributions women have made in recent years, developing innovative approaches to practice and design. Women's significant and growing presence in the profession has attracted more attention than issues of marginalization.&lt;ref&gt;[[Annmarie Adams]], Peta Tancred.

Exhibitions presenting women's achievements in various fields provided early opportunities for women demonstrate their competence in designing pavilions. They included the [[World's Columbian Exposition|1893 exhibition in Chicago]], where the women's pavilion was designed by [[Sophia Hayden Bennett|Sophia Hayden]], and two in 1914 in Germany: the [[Werkbund Exhibition (1914)|Werkbund Exhibition in Cologne]], whose ''Haus der Frau'' was designed by [[Lilly Reich]], and the Burga Expo in Leipzig devoted to books and graphic art. Inspired by these successes, in 1928 [[Lux Guyer]] from Switzerland designed pavilions for [[SAFFA]] (''Schweizerische Ausstellung für Frauenarbeit'') a fair exhibiting the accomplishments of women first held in [[Bern]]. The second SAFFA, held in [[Zurich]] in 1958, was put together by a team of 28 female architects, establishing architecture as a profession open to women in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblion.epfl.ch/EPFL/theses/1992/1079/1079_abs.pdf Évelyne Lang, "Les Premières Femmes Architectes de Suisse"], ''École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne''. {{fr icon}} Retrieved 24 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent statistics==

It is not easy to find reliable statistics on women's place in architecture across the world. Much of the information is dated and some is based on surveys inviting responses but with no guarantee of comprehensive coverage.

;Europe:
In 2010, a survey conducted by the [[Architects' Council of Europe]] in 33 countries, found that there were 524,000 architects, of whom 31% were women. However the proportions differed widely from country to country. The countries with the highest proportion of female architects were Greece (57%), Croatia (56%), Bulgaria (50%), Slovenia (50%) and Sweden (49%) while those with the lowest were Slovakia (15%), Austria (16%), the Netherlands (19%), Germany (21%) and Belgium (24%). Over 200,000 of Europe's architects are in Italy or Germany where the proportions of women are 30% and 21% respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ace-cae.eu/public/contents/getdocument/content_id/1079 "The Architectural Profession in Europe 2010"], ''Architects' Council of Europe''. Retrieved 24 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Australia 
A study conducted in Australia in 2002 indicated that women comprise 43% of architecture students while their representation in the profession varied from 11.6% in [[Queensland]] to 18.2% in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].
More recent Australian data, collected and analyzed as part of the Equity and Diversity in the Australian Architecture Profession research project, shows that whatever measure used women continue to disappear from the profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Research - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/about/research/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women have comprised over 40% of Australian architecture graduates for over two decades, but are only 20% of registered architects in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The 'half-life' of women architects - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/the-half-life-of-women-architects/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17|publisher = |last = Matthewson|first = Gill|authorlink = Gill_Matthewson|last2 = Clark|first2 = Justine|authorlink2 = Justine_Clark|date = 2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Updating the numbers, part 1: at school - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/updating-the-numbers-at-school/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17|last = Matthewson|first = Gill|authorlink = Gill_Matthewson|date = 2013-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Updating the numbers, part 2: at work - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/updating-the-numbers-part-2-at-work/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17|last = Matthewson|first = Gill|authorlink = Gill_Matthewson|date = 2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Updating the numbers, part 3: Institute membership - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/updating-the-numbers-part-3-institute-membership/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17|last = Matthewson|first = Gill|authorlink = Gill_Matthewson|date = 2013-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;South Africa
In 2016 only 21% of the architectural professionals registered in [[South Africa]] were women. A survey by the [[South African Institute of Architects|SA Institute of Architects]] Eastern Cape institute showed that in 2014 only 29% of architecture students graduating from [[Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University]] were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Only 21% of SA architects are women - what can be done? |url =https://www.property24.com/articles/only-21-of-sa-architects-are-women-what-can-be-done/24574 |publisher = Property24 |accessdate = 2018-10-01 |date=25 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;United Kingdom 
A United Kingdom survey in 2000 stated that 13% of practising architects were women although women comprised 38% of students and 22% of teaching staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://architectureau.com/articles/women-in-architecture/ Karen Burns, "Women in architecture"], ''ArchitectureAU''. Retrieved 24 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Data from the Fees Bureau in November 2010 showed, however, that only 19% of professional architects were women, a drop of 5% since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constructingequality.co.uk/faq-s/news/u%E2%80%98alarm%E2%80%99asnumberofwomenarchitectsfallsforfirsttimeinnearlyadecadentitledpost Chrissi McCarthy, "Alarm as number of women architects falls for first time in nearly a decade"], ''Constructing Equality'', 11 November 2010. Retrieved 24 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

;United States
In the United States, the [[National Architectural Accrediting Board]] reported in 2009 that 41% of architecture graduates were women while the [[American Institute of Architects|AIA]] National Associates Committee Report from 2004 gives the percentage of licensed female architects as 20%. In 2003, an AIA Women in Architecture study found that women accounted for 27% of staff in U.S. architecture firms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.aia.org/aiarchitect/2009/11/calling_all_women_finding_the.html Alexis Gregory, "Calling All Women: Finding the Forgotten Architect"], ''AIArchitect'', November 12, 2009.
