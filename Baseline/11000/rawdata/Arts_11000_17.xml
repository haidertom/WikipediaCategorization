''Adiyogi'' was inaugurated on 24 February 2017 by the [[Prime Minister of India]], [[Narendra Modi]], on the occasion of [[Maha Shivaratri]]{{dash}}a [[List of Hindu festivals|Hindu festival]] celebrated annually in honour of Shiva.

{{quote box|width=19em|border=1px|bgcolor=#FFEFD5|quote="This face is not a deity or temple, this is an iconic inspiration. In pursuit of the divine, you don't have to look up because it is not somewhere else. Each of the 112 possibilities is a method to experience the divine within you. You just have to pick one. [...] The idea is not to build one more monument but to use it as a galvanizing force towards self-transformation."|author=Sadhguru on the purpose of the statue.&lt;ref name="IE1"/&gt;}}

''Adiyogi'' is located at the Isha Yoga complex which houses the [[Dhyanalinga]] in [[Coimbatore]], Tamil Nadu at the foothills of [[Velliangiri Mountains]], a range in the [[Western Ghats]].&lt;ref name="DC1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/in-other-news/240217/coimbatore-narendra-modi-unveils-112-feet-shiva-statue-on-mahashivaratri.html|title=Coimbatore: Narendra Modi unveils 112-feet Shiva statue on Mahashivaratri|newspaper=Deccan Chronicle|date=24 February 2017|accessdate= 27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue was designed over two years and manufactured within eight months. The bust is cast in steel. The height of the statue, {{cvt|112|ft|m}}, symbolizes the 112 possibilities to attain to ''[[moksha]]'' (liberation) that are mentioned in yogic culture. Sadhguru also said that the height represents the 112 [[chakras]] in the human system.&lt;ref name="IE1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MB"/&gt;

The Isha Foundation plans to erect such statues in three more locations in the eastern, western and northern parts of India - in [[Varanasi]], [[Mumbai]] and [[Delhi]].&lt;ref name="IE1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/art-and-culture/isha-foundation-narendra-modi-112-feet-shiva-idols-in-india-4536763/ |title=PM Narendra Modi to unveil first 112 feet Shiva idol at Isha Foundation|newspaper=The Indian Express|location=Chennai|date=24 February 2017|accessdate= 27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue's face is world's tallest bust of Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/coimbatore-pm-modi-unveils-112-feet-tall-bust-of-adiyogi-shiva-117022400886_1.html|title=PM Modi unveils 112-foot tall bust of Adiyogi Shiva in Coimbatore|newspaper=Business Standard|date=24 February 2017|accessdate=1 March 2017|location=Coimbatore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaumudi.com/innerpage1.php?newsid=88366|title=PM unveils Adi Yogi, world's tallest bust|publisher=kaumudi|date=24 February 2017|accessdate=1 March 2017|location=Coimbatore}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tallest Shiva statue is the [[Kailashnath Mahadev Statue]] in [[Nepal]] 20-km east of the capital, [[Katmandu]], which is {{Convert|143|ft|order=flip}} tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/south-asia/nepal-president-to-inaugurate-worlds-tallest-shiva-statue_633492.html |title= Nepal President to inaugurate `world`s tallest` Shiva statue |work=Zee News |date=12 June 2010 |accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Linga]] called "Yogeshwar Linga" was consecrated through the ceremony called [[Prana Pratishtha|prana pratishtha]], and is placed in front of the ''Adiyogi'' statue. This linga has five [[chakra]]s{{dash}}[[Muladhara]] (root chakra), [[Svadhishthana]] (sacral chakra), [[Manipura]] (solar plexus chakra), [[Vishuddhi]] (throat chakra), and [[Ajna]] (third eye chakra), and each one of them has sixteen dimensions. The linga specifically has no [[Anahata]] (heart chakra) as it is to represent "a heartless yogi", not heartless as being insensitive but inclusive who doesn't need emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://isha.sadhguru.org/blog/sadhguru/spot/yogeshwar-a-heartless-yogi/|title=Yogeshwar: A Heartless Yogi|accessdate=1 March 2017|publisher=Isha Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sadhguru notes that the statue is named as "Adiyogi", which means "the first yogi", as Shiva is known as the originator of yoga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sadhguru/shiva-the-first-yogi_b_7457374.html |title=Shiva, the First Yogi |date=28 May 2015|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The South-facing Adiyogi is also called [[Dakshinamurthy]] and Adi Guru (first Guru).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sadhguru|title=The first Guru is born|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/edit-page/The-first-Guru-is-born/articleshow/14613783.cms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inauguration ==
In 2014, on [[Guru Poornima]], a {{Convert|21|ft|adj=on|order=flip}} version of the same statue was unveiled at the Isha Yoga Center. This version weighed 30 tonnes and was constructed in three months by a team of fifteen people. This statue was also made of steel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2014/jul/13/Adi-Yogi-Statue-Unveiled-at-Isha-Centre-635177.html|title=Adiyogi Statue Unveiled at Isha Centre|date=13 July 2014|newspaper=New Indian Express|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 January 2017, a replica model of the statue was taken out in a procession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/Adiyogi-replica-taken-out-on-procession/article17117933.ece|title= Adiyogi replica taken out on procession|newspaper=The Hindu|date=30 January 2017|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The main statue was inaugurated by Narendra Modi on Maha Shivaratri, 24 February 2017. He also inaugurated the book ''Adiyogi: The Source of Yoga'' written by Sadhguru and Arundhathi Subramaniam, and lit the [[Yajna|yajna fire]] for the Maha Yoga Yagna. Notable politicians  present at the event include Tamil Nadu Governor [[C. Vidyasagar Rao]], Tamil Nadu Chief Minister [[Edappadi K. Palaniswami]], Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister [[Shivraj Singh Chouhan]], Rajasthan Chief Minister [[Vasundhara Raje|Vasundhara Raje Scindia]], Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister [[N. Chandrababu Naidu]], Minister [[Pon Radhakrishnan]], and Puducherry Lieutenant Governor [[Kiran Bedi]]. Along with politicians, various celebrities from [[Bollywood]] as well as [[Kollywood]] like actresses [[Juhi Chawla]] and [[Kajal Aggarwal]] were also present.&lt;ref name="DC1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/politicos-celebrities-flock-to-coimbatore/articleshow/57323833.cms|title=Politicos, celebrities flock to Coimbatore|newspaper=The Times of India|date=24 February 2017|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

To mark the unveiling of the statue, the song "Adiyogi - The source of Yoga" was released by the Isha Foundation on [[YouTube]] on 19 February 2017. The song was sung and composed by [[Kailash Kher]] with the lyrics being written by [[Prasoon Joshi]] and also performed live at the inaugural function by Kher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.radioandmusic.com/entertainment/editorial/news/170223-prasoon-joshi-and-kailash-kher-collaborate|title=Prasoon Joshi and Kher Collaborate|access-date=5 March 2017|date=23 February 2017|work=RadioAndMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narendra Modi at the inauguration mentioned that "[by] practising Yoga, a spirit of oneness is created. Oneness of mind, body and the intellect, oneness with our families and with the society we live in, with fellow humans and with birds, animals and trees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-maha-shivratri-2017-kailash-kher-s-adiyogi-the-source-of-yoga-song-is-a-must-listen-for-all-shiv-bhakts-2334076|title=Maha Shivratri 2017: Kailash Kher's 'Adiyogi - the source of yoga song' is a must-listen for all Shiv bhakts|date=24 February 2017|newspaper=Daily News and Analysis|access-date=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another {{Convert|21|ft|adj=on|order=flip}} statue of Adiyogi was unveiled in Tennessee, USA, in October 2015 by the Isha Foundation. The abode called "Adiyogi: The Abode of Yoga" in Tennessee is spread over a {{cvt|30,000|sqft|sqm|order=flip}} area and the project cost over $8 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiapost.com/21foot-statue-of-adiyogi-unveiled-and-consecrated-in-tennessee/|title=21-foot statue of Adiyogi unveiled and consecrated in Tennessee|publisher=India Post |date=6 October 2015 |access-date=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Various environmental activists and groups protested the inauguration claiming that the statue was built in the catchment area of the [[Noyyal River]], thus affecting biodiversity and violating building bylaws. A [[Public Interest Litigation]] was also filed by Vellingiri Hill Tribal Protection Society in the [[Madras High Court]] challenging the construction of the statue. The Isha Foundation however stated that it has acquired all the required approvals of the construction.&lt;ref name="IT1"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/on-maha-shivaratri-pm-modi-inaugurates-112-feet-tall-adiyogi-statue-272218.html|title=On Maha Shivaratri PM Modi Inaugurates 112- Feet Tall Adiyogi Statue!|newspaper=India Times|author= Abraham, Bobins|date=24 February 2017|accessdate= 27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 March 2017, the Deputy Director of Town and Country Planning filed their report stating that the statue and various buildings like the arch, road, a parking lot and ''[[Mandapa|mandapams]]'' (outdoor hall or pavilion) were constructed without taking proper approvals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.southlive.in/southly/2017/03/01/tn-govt-says-adiyogi-statue-is-illegal-environmentalist-asks-why-then-the-govt-allowed-the-inauguration-to-happen |title=TN govt says Adiyogi statue is illegal, Environmentalist asks why govt allowed inauguration to happen?  |date=1 March 2017 |work=South Live |accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/counter-filed-in-isha-foundation-case/998505/?next|title=Counter filed in Isha foundation case |work=Outlook India |place=Chennai |date=1 March 2017 |accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matter is currently ''[[sub judice]]'' as the High Court will await for responses from all the concerned twelve respondents in the case before taking the decision.&lt;ref name=TNM_Illegal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/ishas-shiva-statue-has-no-approval-buildings-illegal-tn-government-takes-stand-57938 |title=Isha's Shiva statue has no approval, buildings illegal: TN government takes a stand |work=[[The News Minute]] |date=1 March 2017 |accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Her recording of Grieg songs won the 1993 ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' Record of the Year, the first time in the award's history that it had gone to a song recording. In 2001, she released her album with [[Elvis Costello]], ''For the Stars'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/21/arts/worlds-mezzo-pop-star-meet-somewhere-between-anne-sofie-von-otter-fresh-start.html | title=Worlds of Mezzo and Pop Star Meet Somewhere in Between; Anne Sofie von Otter: Fresh Start | work=The New York Times | author=Neil Strauss | date=2001-05-21 | accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which she won an [[Edison Award]]. She was awarded the [[Grammy Award for Best Classical Vocal Solo]] [[57th Annual Grammy Awards|in 2015]] for her album of French songs, ''Douce France''. She is a regular recital and recording partner with Swedish pianist [[Bengt Forsberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/09/arts/music-review-von-otter-from-lieder-to-blues.html | title=Music Review: Von Otter, From Lieder to Blues | work=The New York Times | author=Anthony Tommasini | date=1998-05-09 | accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/19/arts/music/vibrant-singing-at-the-nice-price.html | title=Vibrant Singing at the Nice Price |work=[[The New York Times]]|author=[[Anthony Tommasini]]| date=2005-04-19 | accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/05/arts/music/05otte.html | title=Resilience of the Human Spirit, in Song | work=The New York Times | author=Steve Smith | date=2009-05-04 | accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, von Otter sang the Evangelist in the premiere of [[Sven-David Sandström]]'s ''[[Ordet – en passion]]''. Other work in contemporary music has included singing the role of The Woman in ''Senza Sangue'' of [[Péter Eötvös]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/11/arts/music/review-a-peter-eotvos-premiere-and-schubert-at-the-new-york-philharmonic.html|title=Review: A Peter Eotvos Premiere and Schubert at the New York Philharmonic|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=[[Anthony Tommasini]]|date=2015-05-10| accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other media, she appeared in the film ''[[A Late Quartet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/02/movies/a-late-quartet-directed-by-yaron-zilberman.html | title=The Strings Play On; The Bonds Tear Apart | work=The New York Times | author=Stephen Holden | date=2012-11-01 | accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, she released an album of music written by composers imprisoned in the Nazi "model" ghetto of [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]] (also known as Terezin) prior to their transportation to the death camp of Auschwitz. She collaborated on this project with [[Christian Gerhaher]] (baritone) and chamber musicians. She has stated that the material has special personal meaning for her as her father had attempted unsuccessfully during the war to spread information that he had received from SS officer [[Kurt Gerstein]] about the Nazi death camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://forward.com/culture/11634/a-different-aria-00490/ | title=A Different Aria | work=Forward | author=David Bartal | date=2007-09-17 | accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Antequera Dolmens Site''' is a cultural heritage ensemble comprising 3 cultural monuments &lt;ref&gt;''Decree 25/2009 of 27 January, which is enroll into the General Catalogue of Andalusian Historical Heritage as an Heritage of Cultural Interest, with the typology of Archaeological Zone, the archaeological area of the dolmens of Antequera (province of Málaga).'' [http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/boja/2009/33/32 BOJA 18.02.09]&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[Dolmen of Menga]], [[Dolmen de Viera|Dolmen of Viera]] and [[Tholos de El Romeral|Tholos of El Romeral]]) and 2 natural mountain features (the [[Peña de los Enamorados]] and [[El Torcal de Antequera|El Torcal]]&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/boja/2014/8/14 Decree 222/2013, of November 5, declare  the Special Areas of Conservation Torcal de Antequera (ES0000032), Los Reales de Sierra Bermeja (ES6170004), Sierra Crestellina (ES6170005) and Desfiladero de los Gaitanes (ES6170003), expands the territorial scope of the Natural Park Torcal de Antequera and approves the Plan of Management of Natural Resources of the Natural Tourist Sites Torcal de Antequera, Los Reales de Sierra Bermeja, Sierra Crestellina and Desfiladero de los Gaitanes.]''&lt;/ref&gt;) in and near the city of [[Antequera]] in [[Andalusia]], [[Spain]]. The cultural institution responsible for its protection is the [[Archeological Ensemble Dolmens of Antequera|CADA]] ({{ill|Conjunto Arqueológico Dólmenes de Antequera|es}}, Archeological Ensemble Dolmens of Antequera). It was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] in 2016.

==Outstanding Universal Value==
For something to be declared World Heritage Site, it must demonstrate exceptional universal value; that is, an extraordinary importance transcending national borders and of interest to present and future generations of all humanity.

[[UNESCO]] requires justification of at least one of the six criteria set for the cultural heritage by the ''Convention on the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage'' (1972) to demonstrate the exceptional universal value of the site. The proposal of the Antequera Dolmens Site is based on one of them (i); the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]] in its final report incorporates other two (iii, iv).

* Criterion (i): "represent a masterpiece of the human creative genius"

The [[Neolithic]] Dolmen of Menga represents one of the most important masterpiece of [[Megalith|megalithic]] architecture (Atlantic tradition) based on [[Post and lintel|post-and-lintel]] construction with an earthen covering, notable for its enormous dimensions that push the size possible in a corridor sepulcher by incorporating the unprecedented solution of intermediate pillars; likewise, the later, [[Chalcolithic]] [[Beehive tomb|tholos]] (beehive tomb) of El Romeral complements the two dolmens with its corridor and false dome of [[Dry stone|drystone masonry]] (Mediterranean tradition).

* Criterion (iii): "provide a unique testimony, or at least exceptional, on a cultural tradition or a living or dead civilization"

Both the Dolmen of Menga and the Tholos of El Romeral have anomalous orientations. The [[Archaeoastronomy|archaeoastronomer]] Michael Hoskin, who studied the site, noted that, whereas the axes of almost all [[dolmen]]s around the Mediterranean are oriented to a celestial feature, such as sunrise at dawn on the [[equinox]]es (as occurs in the [[Dolmen de Viera|Dolmen of Viera]]), the [[Dolmen of Menga]] points to the striking nearby peak called the [[Peña de los Enamorados]]. This rises abruptly from the plain and contains the contemporaneous [[rock shelter of Matacabras]], in which cave paintings are found.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/boja/2011/150/23 Decree 245/2011 of 12 July, which is enroll into the General Catalogue of the Andalusian Historical Heritage as Bien de Interés Cultural, with the typology of archaeological site, the Archaeological site of Peña de los Enamorados, in the municipality of Antequera (Andalusia). BOJA nº150 de 02/08/2011]''&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Tholos of El Romeral is oriented to the mountains of [[El Torcal de Antequera|El Torcal]], containing the [[Cave del Toro|Cave of the Bull]] (terrestrial orientation), as well as to the noon sun on the winter [[solstice]] (celestial orientation). El Torcal is noted for the extensive, otherworldly [[karst]] landscape at its summit. In addition, the Tholos of El Romeral lies along an axis from the Dolmen of Menga to the Peña de los Enamorados. Thus, the Dolmens of Antequera construct a unique megalithic landscape by their relationship with the surrounding natural elements.

* Criterion (iv): "be an outstanding example of a type of building or architectural or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates one or several significant periods of human history"

The three megalithic monuments reflect a stage of human history in which the first ceremonial monuments in [[Western Europe]] were built, according to the two major building traditions of [[megalithic art]] ([[lintel]] and [[Beehive tomb|beehive]]). This is an unusual proposal on the List of World Heritage Sites as it is not being put forward as a mixed heritage site, in which its cultural value would be added to its natural value, but as an integration and close dialogue between the megalithic architecture and the [[landscape]]. A phenomenon of "landscape monumentalization" has occurred here by which the natural landmarks acquire the value of monuments while the manmade constructs present the appearance of a natural landscape.

Finally, the authenticity of the megaliths is well established, with the [[Dolmen of Menga]] dating to the [[Neolithic]] and the Tholos of El Romeral to the [[Chalcolithic]], and the structures retain high integrity, being in good condition and well maintained.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6443">The '''Arts Council Norway''' ({{lang-no|Norsk kulturråd}}, often shortened to ''Kulturrådet'') is the official [[arts council]] for [[Norway]].

Based in [[Oslo]], it is a Norwegian state institution created in 1965 as a result of a [[parliament of Norway|parliamentary]] decision in 1964.

Arts Council Norway's administration is in charge of a broad spectrum of administrative tasks and functions within the cultural field, including artists' grants, the Audio and Visual Fund and a number of other funding schemes. In 2010, Arts Council Norway was merged with [[ABM-utvikling]], the Norwegian Archive, Library and Museum Authority. The library functions were transferred to the [[National Library of Norway]]. In 2015, the archive functions were transferred to the [[National Archives of Norway]].

Arts Council Norway administers funding schemes for literature, music, performing and visual arts, museum development, youth culture, cultural heritage and creative industries. Arts Council Norway also develops, funds and commissions cultural research projects and evaluations of major projects funded by the Cultural Fund.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kulturradet.no/documents/10157/96a2e648-a8b3-4bff-ad51-92121d3a41f2&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the administration is the main contact point for the [[EEA Grants]] Culture, [[Creative Europe]] and other international cultural cooperation efforts. The administration also houses the secretariat for The Cultural Rucksack.

'''The Arts Council'''

The arts council is charged with managing the Norwegian culture fund, reviewing applications and allocating funds to achieve cultural objectives at the members' academic and artistic discretion, but consistent with the sitting Parliament's priorities. The council also serves as an advisory body for the public in cultural matters.

The Council may, on their own initiative, hold conferences, perform cultural experiments and initiate studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Simonsen|first=Mie|date=17 March 2006|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/debatt/article1251101.ece|title=Retorikk og realiteter|work=[[Aftenposten]]|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The council annually awards the [[Arts Council Norway Honorary Prize]] ({{lang-no|Norsk kulturråds ærespris}}).

Chairman of the arts council is [[Yngve Slettholm]].

==History==

Regional arts programs first emerged in the late 1960s in response to a need for greater access to performing arts touring in areas isolated from major cultural centers. The development of RAOs was encouraged in 1973 by the NEA House reauthorizing committee, which stated its belief that:

:''Cooperation among states in their activities to support the arts can significantly serve the purposes of this act… It is felt that the regional approach would better serve the cultural needs of the people in many areas by allowing the full utilization of the resources of several states to be brought to bear where special needs exist.''&lt;ref&gt;US Regional Arts Organizations, ''History.'' {{cite web|url=http://www.usregionalarts.org/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711093307/http://www.usregionalarts.org/history.htm |archivedate=2010-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislation creating RAOs was introduced by Public Law 93-133.&lt;ref&gt;US Congress (1973). ''National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Amendments,'' The Library of Congress. http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d093:SN00795:@@@L&amp;summ2=m&amp;&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1973, the [[United States Congress]] has set aside a specific appropriation within the NEA budget for the states and their regional organizations. The RAOs, which include Arts Midwest, [[Mid-America Arts Alliance]], [[Mid Atlantic Arts Foundation]], the [[New England Foundation for the Arts]], [[Southern Arts Federation|South Arts]], and the [[Western States Arts Federation]], use this funding to coordinate the touring and presenting of visual and performing arts programs in the United States. 

Arts Midwest was formed in 1985 through the merger of two RAOs, the Affiliated State Arts Agencies of the Upper Midwest and the Great Lakes Arts Alliance. It is supported by the NEA’s appropriation, as well as private support in the forms of individual gifts, corporate and foundation grants, and dues paid by member State Arts Agencies.

==Programs==

'''Arts Midwest World Fest''' identifies and tours global music ensembles to small and rural Midwest communities to conduct week-long residencies. Residencies include public performances; workshops and concerts with K – 12 students; and community outreach activities. 

The '''Arts Midwest Touring Fund''' supports the inter-state touring of professional performing artists specializing in dance, theater, music, youth and family entertainment. Through this fund, Arts Midwest provides grants to presenting organizations to conduct public performances and educational activities to audiences in the Arts Midwest region. 

The annual '''Arts Midwest Conference''' is a booking and educational conference for the performing arts in the United States. The Conference is managed by Arts Midwest and serves the 15 states represented by Arts Midwest and Mid-America Arts Alliance.

'''ArtsLab''' is a learning and technical assistance program that aims to strengthen urban and rural arts organizations in Minnesota and North Dakota. 

'''Caravanserai: A place where cultures meet''' is a cultural exchange program that brings artists from predominantly Muslim societies to American communities with the goal of encouraging greater understanding and acceptance. Caravanserai is produced by Arts Midwest on behalf of its fellow Regional Arts Organization. The program is supported by a lead grant from the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art. 

'''Arts Learning Xchange''' is a program that supports learning events and networking among [[Twin Cities]] metro area arts organizations. It is funded by the [http://www.wallacefoundation.org/Pages/default.aspx Wallace Foundation] in collaboration with [http://www.saintpaulfoundation.org/ Minnesota Community Foundation.]

'''Arts Midwest manages several national initiatives for the National Endowment for the Arts:'''

:*'''[[The Big Read]]''' is an program of the NEA managed by Arts Midwest. It was created in response to ''Reading at Risk: A Survey of Literary Reading in America'',&lt;ref&gt;National Endowment for the Arts (2004). ''Reading At Risk: A Survey of Literary Reading in America.'' Research Division Report #46. {{cite web|url=http://www.arts.gov/pub/readingatrisk.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527173632/http://www.arts.gov/pub/ReadingAtRisk.pdf |archivedate=2010-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a report issued in July 2004 by the NEA that identified issues facing literary reading. The mission of the Big Read is “to bring together partners across the country to encourage citizens to read for pleasure and enlightenment.”&lt;ref&gt;National Endowment for the Arts. The Big Read. http://www.neabigread.org/about.php&lt;/ref&gt;

:*'''Shakespeare in American Communities''' supports professional theatrical productions of [[William Shakespeare]] for middle and high school students by annually providing grants to professional theater companies.

:*'''NEA Jazz Masters Live''' supports programs that feature and honor [[NEA Jazz Masters]]. The initiative aims to introduce audiences to the genre of [[Jazz|American Jazz]] and its musicians.

==Past Programs==

In 2009, Arts Midwest worked in collaboration with its partner Regional Arts Organizations on '''''Global Positioning Strategy for the Arts: Recommitting America to International Cultural Exchange,'''''&lt;ref&gt;US Regional Arts Organizations (2009). ''Global Positioning Strategy for the Arts: Recommitting America to International Cultural Exchange.'' http://www.artsmidwest.org/files/GPS_for_the_Arts_Web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; a report that outlines a set of policy recommendations for the [[Obama Administration]] on increasing investment in and capacity for international cultural exchange.

From 2008-2010, Arts Midwest coordinated an international component of The Big Read, The Big Read Egypt/U.S. The Big Read Egypt/U.S. was a Global Cultural Initiative project of the U.S. Department of State and the NEA in partnership with Arts Midwest, the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services. The program introduced communities in Egypt to American literature: '[[Fahrenheit 451|Fahrenheit 451 (Ray Bradbury)'']],'[[To Kill a Mockingbird|'To Kill A Mockingbird (Harper Lee),'']] and '[[The Grapes of Wrath|'The Grapes of Wrath (John Steinbeck),'']] and has exposed US communities to Egyptian author '[[The Thief and the Dogs|'Naguib Mahfouz’s The Thief and the Dogs.'']]

Arts Midwest partnered with the [[Ohio Arts Council]] and the [[Columbus Museum of Art]] in 2000 to tour '''''Illusions of Eden: Visions of the American Heartland.''''' This exhibition focused on the [[American Midwest]] and included approximately 100 paintings and photographs created during the period between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. These works surrounded four large-scale sculptural projects created by contemporary artists [[Maya Lin]], [[Mary Lucier]], [[Kerry James Marshall]],  and Malcolm Cochran. ''Illusions of Eden'' was organized around the themes of garden, home, work, word, and journey.

In 2002, Arts Midwest partnered with the Ludwig Museum in Budapest on '''''The View from Here: Recent Pictures from Central Europe and the American Midwest''''', an exhibition that explored regional identity as envisioned by artists from the American Midwest and [[Central Europe]]. Four themes shaped ''The View from Here'': natural landscape, built or constructed environments, social commentaries gleaned through the artists’ observations and experiences, and reflections on cultural values. 

Arts Midwest partnered with The Decorative Arts Center of Ohio in 2006 on the exhibition '''''Russel Wright: Living with Good Design.''''' The exhibition featured American designer [[Russel Wright|Russel Wright’s]] designs for housewares, furniture, appliances, and fabrics from the 1930s to the late 1950s. 

In 2009, Arts Midwest and the Columbus Museum of Art organized '''''Stories of the Somali Diaspora: Photographs by Abdi Roble'''''.

The '''Ashkenaz''' is a live music and dance venue located in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]] in the [[United States]]. It is a [[non-profit]] organization. It focuses on [[world music]]. In 2011 it was voted the best place to dance by readers of ''[[East Bay Express]]''.&lt;ref name=EBE1&gt;{{cite web|title=Readers' Poll Winners: Arts and Culture|url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/ebx/readers-poll-winners-arts-and-culture/BestOf?oid=2928575&amp;keywords=|work=Best of the East Bay|publisher=East Bay Express|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Ashkenaz opened in 1973 and was founded by [[performance artist]] and activist [[David Nadel]]. After relocating from [[Los Angeles]] to attend [[University of California, Berkeley]], Nadel formed a [[dance troupe]]. The troupe started renting spaces on [[San Pablo Avenue]]. Nadel, along with six other people, would go on to buy the building where Ashkenaz is located today. He named the organization after his [[Ashkenazi Jewish]] ancestry. The original building was a series of old retail shops. Nadel and friends built the wooden facade that is seen today.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt; It is supposed to resemble an [[Eastern European]] [[synagogue]].&lt;ref name=EBE2&gt;{{cite web|title=Ashkenaz|url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/ebx/ashkenaz/Location?oid=1109232|publisher=East Bay Express|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It totals 5,000 square feet.&lt;ref name=Rosenblatt&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenblatt|first=Eli|title=A Place Called Ashkenaz|url=http://forward.com/articles/12917/a-place-called-ashkenaz-/|work=Arts &amp; Culture|publisher=Forward|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the city of Berkeley named the Ashkenaz a [[List of Berkeley Landmarks, Structures of Merit, and Historic Districts|city landmark]].&lt;ref name=Katz&gt;{{cite web|last=Katz|first=Leslie|title=Slain Ashkenaz owner recalled for his sense of justice|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/4790/slain-ashkenaz-owner-recalled-for-his-sense-of-justice/|work=Local|publisher=J Weekly|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 a drunken patron was kicked out of the club by Nadel. The patron threatened to shoot Nadel. The man returned after Nadel closed the club for the evening and shot Nadel [[point blank]] in the head. Nadel died from the gunshot wound at the hospital and the man was never found. In wake of Nadel dying, a group of Ashkenaz patrons bought it, and then formed it into a nonprofit.&lt;ref name=Mills&gt;{{cite web|last=Mills|first=Robert|title=Ashkenaz provides music, “living room” for activists|url=http://www.berkeleyside.com/2011/07/21/ashkenaz-provides-music-dance-living-room-for-activists/|work=Berkeley History|publisher=Berkeleyside|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It re-opened six months later, on June 21, 1997.&lt;ref name=Bowman/&gt;

==Today==
It caters to [[world music]], both local and international. Music genres range from [[hip-hop]] to [[Cajun music]].&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt; They also host events focused around [[Judaism]], including holiday celebrations and [[klezmer]] concerts.&lt;ref name=Rosenblatt/&gt; The majority of concerts start with a [[dancing|dance lessons]] based around the style or genre of the music.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt; They host benefits for local organizations and activists, such as the [[American Indian Movement]] and [[Nature Conservancy]].&lt;ref name=Bowman&gt;{{cite news|last=Bowman|first=Catherine|title=Ashkenaz Reborn 6 Months After Owner's Slaying|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Ashkenaz-Reborn-6-Months-After-Owner-s-Slaying-2822075.php|work=News|publisher=SFGate|accessdate=31 October 2012|date=14 June 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization aims to be a [[zero waste]] business. They recycle everything and provide customers glasses of water instead of [[water bottles]]. They have a television program on [[Berkeley Community Television]] called ''Ashkenaz Live,'' where they showcase performances and history of the performers genres. Ashkenaz has a live children's program where musicians play to local children on Sundays.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt; The venue has a stage, alcohol serving bar, a dance studio, and a [[vegetarian]] restaurant. A space upstairs where Nadel used to live is an office space.&lt;ref name=Rosenblatt/&gt;

The '''Australian Girls Own Gallery''' (aGOG) was a commercial gallery that operated in Leichhardt Street, [[Kingston, Australian Capital Territory|Kingston]] in [[Canberra]] from 1989 to 1998. The gallery was owned and operated by former [[National Gallery of Australia]] curator Helen Maxwell.

The gallery was significant because it only represented women artists (although towards the end of its operations the work of men would be very rarely exhibited). Maxwell started the gallery because she felt as that there was a bias against women artists within the art world and she 'felt strongly that women didn't get enough of a voice'.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Bellis Alison Dell, "A Place Good for the Spirit", ''Canberra Times'', 5 October 1989, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first exhibition at aGOG was ''Les femmes formidables 1'' which ran from 16 March – 19 April 1989 and featured the work of five female artists: Banduk Marika, [[Barbara Hanrahan]], Joyce Allen, Lidia Groblika and Kate Lohse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article120915840 |title=Fringe festival program |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=63 |issue=19,512 |date=11 March 1989 |page=14 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian and art critic Sasha Grishin noted that the represented artists 'form an important cross-section of contemporary women printmakers in Australia'.&lt;ref&gt;Sasha Grishin, "'Les Femmes' a Good Start for Girl's Own Gallery", ''Canberra Times'', 29 March 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

aGOG would exhibit several group and solo shows each year. Represented artists included: [[Vivienne Binns]], Pam Debenham, [[Judy Horacek]], Marie McMahon, Patsy Payne, Mitzi Shearer, Ruth Waller, and [[Judy Watson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://australianartnetwork.com.au/category/artists/judy-watson/?filter_types=3610 |title=Judy Watson |website=australianartnetwork.com.au |publisher=Australian Art Network |accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After closing aGOG in 1998, Maxwell went on to open Helen Maxwell Gallery in [[Braddon, Australian Capital Territory|Braddon]], Canberra, which represented both male and female artists and was closed in 2010.

The '''Battlefield Palette''' (also known as the '''Vultures Palette''', the '''Giraffes Palette''', or the '''Lion Palette''')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://xoomer.virgilio.it/francescoraf/hesyra/palettes/vulptures.htm|title=The Battlefield palette - Corpus of Egyptian Late Predynastic Palettes|website=xoomer.virgilio.it|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be the earliest battle scene representation of the dozen or more ceremonial or ornamental [[cosmetic palette]]s of [[ancient Egypt]]. Along with the others in this series of palettes, including the [[Narmer Palette]], it includes some of the first representations of the figures, or glyphs, that became [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyph]]s. Most notable on the Battlefield Palette is the standard ([[Commons:Category:Standard (hieroglyph)|iat hieroglyph]]), and [[Man-prisoner (hieroglyph)|Man-prisoner hieroglyph]], probably the forerunner that gave rise to the concept of the [[Nine Bows]] (representation of foreign tribal enemies).

The palettes probably date mostly from the [[Naqada III]] (ca. 3300–3100 BC),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.berkshirefinearts.com/04-19-2012_dawn-of-civilization-egypt.htm|title=The Dawn of Egyptian Art - Berkshire Fine Arts|last=Giuliano|first=Charles|website=www.berkshirefinearts.com|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. late predynastic period, around 3100 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=116965&amp;partId=1&amp;people=93650&amp;peoA=93650-3-4&amp;page=1|title=The Battlefield Palette|website=British Museum|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two major pieces of the Battlefield Palette are held by the [[British Museum|British]] and [[Ashmolean Museum]]s.

==The Battlefield Palette, two fragments==
[[Image:Hierakonpolis Palette fragment.jpg|thumb|170px|Upper fragment, obverse, in the Ashmolean Museum.]]

[[Image:Battlefield palette.jpg|thumb|170px|Lower fragment, obverse, (28 x 20 cm), in the British Museum.]]
The Battlefield Palette obverse contains the circular defined area for the mixing of a cosmetic substance. It contains the battlefield scene, and forerunners of hieroglyphs: ''prisoner'', tribal-territory ''wooden standard'', the ''[[horus#Etymology|horus]]-falcon'' and an ''[[Commons:Category:Ibis (hieroglyph)|ibis]]'' bird resting on standards. The fractured lower half of the prisoner on the obverse right may have a hieroglyph at his front (the rectangle, as rounded for land) with suspected papyrus plants attached on top.

The reverse of the palette has dramatically stylized versions of a bird, two antelope-like mammals, a vertical palm-tree trunk, a partial top with fruits, and short horizontal palm fronds.

'''Benjamin Jonson''' (''c''. 11 June 1572 – ''c''. 16 August 1637&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bland|first=Mark|date=2004|title=Ben Jonson and the Legacies of the Past|jstor=10.1525/hlq.2004.67.3.371|journal=Huntington Library Quarterly|volume=67|pages=371–400}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an English playwright, poet, actor, and literary critic, whose artistry exerted a lasting impact upon English poetry and stage comedy. He popularised the [[comedy of humours]]. He is best known for the [[satire|satirical]] plays ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]''&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Jonson, Ben |volume=15 |pages=502–507 |first=Adolphus William |last=Ward}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1598), ''[[Volpone|Volpone, or The Fox]]'' (c. 1606), ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'' (1610) and ''[[Bartholomew Fair (play)|Bartholomew Fair]]'' (1614) and for his [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] and [[epigram]]matic poetry; he is generally regarded as the second most important English playwright during the reign of [[James VI and I]] after [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|306058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonson was a [[Classics|classically educated]], well-read and cultured man of the [[English Renaissance]] with an appetite for controversy (personal and political, artistic and intellectual) whose cultural influence was of unparalleled breadth upon the playwrights and the poets of the [[Jacobean era]] (1603–1625) and of the [[Caroline era]] (1625–1642).&lt;ref name="autogenerated388"&gt;"Ben Jonson", ''Grolier Encyclopedia of Knowledge'', volume 10, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StewartHarp2000"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Evans |first=Robert C |year=2000 |editor=Harp, Richard |editor2=Stewart, Stanley |title=The Cambridge companion to Ben Jonson |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |isbn=0-521-64678-2 |pages=189–202 |chapter=Jonson's critical heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:William Camden by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Westminster School]] master [[William Camden]] cultivated the artistic genius of Ben Jonson.]]

[[File:Attributed to Abraham van Blijenberch - William Drummond of Hawthornden, 1585 - 1649. Poet - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Scottish poet [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]] was friend and confidant to Jonson.]]
In midlife, Jonson claimed that his paternal grandfather, who 'served King Henry 8 and was a gentleman',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-15116&lt;/ref&gt; was a member of the extended Johnston family of [[Annandale]] in the [[Dumfries and Galloway|Dumfries and Galloway]], a genealogy that is attested by the three spindles ([[rhombus|rhombi]]) in the Jonson family [[coat of arms]]: one spindle is a diamond-shaped [[Heraldry|heraldic]] device used by the Johnston family. 

Jonson's father lost his property, was imprisoned, and suffered [[forfeiture (law)|forfeiture]] under [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]]; having become a clergyman upon his release, he died a month before his son's birth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-15116&lt;/ref&gt; Jonson's mother married a master [[bricklayer]] two years later.&lt;ref name="Robert Chambers, Book of Days"&gt;Robert Chambers, Book of Days&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Ben Jonson", Encyclopædia Britannica, 15th Edition, pp. 611&lt;/ref&gt; Jonson attended school in [[St Martin's Lane]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Later, a family friend paid for his studies at [[Westminster School]], where the [[antiquarian]], historian, [[topographer]] and [[officer of arms]], [[William Camden]] (1551–1623) was one of his masters. In the event, the pupil and the master became friends, and the intellectual influence of Camden's broad-ranging scholarship upon Jonson's art and [[style (fiction)|literary style]] remained notable, until Camden's death in 1623.

On leaving Westminster School, Jonson was to have attended the [[University of Cambridge]], to continue his book learning but did not, because of his unwilled apprenticeship to his bricklayer stepfather.&lt;ref name="autogenerated388"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robert Chambers, Book of Days"/&gt; According to the churchman and historian [[Thomas Fuller]] (1608–61), Jonson at this time built a garden wall in [[Lincoln's Inn]]. After having been an apprentice bricklayer, Ben Jonson went to the [[Netherlands]] and volunteered to soldier with the English regiments of [[Francis Vere]] (1560–1609) in [[Flanders]].

The ''Hawthornden Manuscripts'' (1619), of the conversations between Ben Jonson and the poet [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]]&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; (1585–1649), report that, when in Flanders, Jonson engaged, fought and killed an enemy soldier in [[single combat]], and took for trophies the weapons of the vanquished soldier.&lt;ref name=Hawthornden&gt;{{Cite book |last=Drummond |first=William |year=1619 |title=Heads of a Conversation betwixt the Famous Poet Ben Johnson and William Drummond of Hawthornden, January 1619 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ubHPBcMk2OMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22William+Drummond%22+jonson&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=S0PASPT7GY-2iwGjjPTsDQ&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA43,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his military activity on the Continent, Jonson returned to England and worked as an actor and as a playwright. As an actor, Jonson was the protagonist “Hieronimo” (Geronimo) in the play ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'' (ca. 1586), by [[Thomas Kyd]] (1558–94), the first [[revenge tragedy]] in English literature. Moreover, by 1597, he was a working playwright employed by [[Philip Henslowe]], the leading producer for the English public theatre; by the next year, the production of ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' (1598) had established Jonson's reputation as a dramatist.&lt;ref&gt;"Ben Jonson", Encyclopædia Britannica, 15th Edition, p. 611&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Thomas Kyd", ''Grolier Encyclopedia of Knowledge'', volume 11, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding his marriage Jonson described his wife to William Drummond as "a shrew, yet honest". The identity of Jonson's wife has always been obscure, yet she sometimes is identified as "Ann Lewis", the woman who married a Benjamin Jonson in 1594, at the church of [[St Magnus-the-Martyr]], near [[London Bridge]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated612"&gt;"Ben Jonson", Encyclopædia Britannica, 15th Edition, p. 612.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning the family of Anne Lewis and Ben Jonson, the St. Martin's Church registers indicate that Mary Jonson, their eldest daughter, died in November 1593, at six months of age. Then a decade later, in 1603, Benjamin Jonson, their eldest son, died of [[Bubonic plague]] when he was seven years old; to lament and honour the dead boy, Benjamin Jonson ''père'' wrote the elegiac ''[[On My First Sonne]]'' (1603). Moreover, 32 years later, a second son, also named Benjamin Jonson, died in 1635. In that period, Ann Lewis and Ben Jonson lived separate lives for five years; their matrimonial arrangement cast Ann Lewis as the housewife Jonson, and Ben Jonson as the artist who enjoyed the residential hospitality of his patrons, Sir Robert Townshend and Lord Aubigny, [[Esme Stuart, 3rd Duke of Lennox]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated612"/&gt;

==Career==
By summer 1597, Jonson had a fixed engagement in the [[Admiral's Men]], then performing under [[Philip Henslowe]]'s management at [[The Rose (theatre)|The Rose]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; [[John Aubrey]] reports, on uncertain authority, that Jonson was not successful as an actor; whatever his skills as an actor, he was evidently more valuable to the company as a writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowers|first1=Fredson T.|title=Ben Jonson the Actor|journal=Studies in Philology|date=July 1937|volume=34|issue=3|pages=392–406|jstor=4172372|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time Jonson had begun to write original plays for the Admiral's Men; in 1598 he was mentioned by [[Francis Meres]] in his ''Palladis Tamia'' as one of "the best for tragedy."&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; None of his early tragedies survive, however. An undated comedy, ''[[The Case is Altered]]'', may be his earliest surviving play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miola|first=Robert S.|year=2012|title=The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Ben Jonson|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|chapter=The Case Is Altered, Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1597 a play which he co-wrote with [[Thomas Nashe]], ''[[The Isle of Dogs (play)|The Isle of Dogs]]'', was suppressed after causing great offence. Arrest warrants for Jonson and Nashe were issued by Queen [[Elizabeth I]]'s so-called interrogator, [[Richard Topcliffe]]. Jonson was jailed in [[Marshalsea Prison]] and charged with "Leude and mutynous behaviour", while Nashe managed to escape to [[Great Yarmouth]]. Two of the actors, [[Gabriel Spenser]] and Robert Shaw, were also imprisoned. A year later, Jonson was again briefly imprisoned, this time in [[Newgate Prison]], for killing Gabriel Spenser in a [[duel]] on 22 September 1598 in Hogsden Fields&lt;ref name=Hawthornden/&gt; (today part of [[Hoxton]]). Tried on a charge of [[manslaughter]], Jonson pleaded guilty but was released by [[benefit of clergy]],&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; a legal ploy through which he gained leniency by reciting a brief bible verse (the [[neck-verse]]), forfeiting his 'goods and chattels' and being branded on his left thumb.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; While in jail Jonson converted to Catholicism, possibly through the influence of fellow-prisoner Father [[Thomas Wright (writer)|Thomas Wright]], a [[Jesuit]] priest.&lt;ref name="ID2008"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Donaldson |first=Ian |year=2008 |title=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, England |chapter=Benjamin Jonson (1572–1637) |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/15116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1598 Jonson produced his first great success, ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'', capitalising on the vogue for humorous plays which [[George Chapman]] had begun with ''[[An Humorous Day's Mirth]]''. [[William Shakespeare]] was among the first actors to be cast. Jonson followed this in 1599 with ''[[Every Man out of His Humour]]'', a pedantic attempt to imitate [[Aristophanes]]. It is not known whether this was a success on stage, but when published it proved popular and went through several editions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Jonson's other work for the theatre in the last years of [[Elizabeth I]]'s reign was marked by fighting and controversy. ''[[Cynthia's Revels]]'' was produced by the [[Children of the Chapel]] Royal at [[Blackfriars Theatre]] in 1600. It satirised both [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]], who Jonson believed had accused him of lustfulness in ''[[Histriomastix (play)|Histriomastix]]'', and [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]]. Jonson attacked the two poets again in ''[[Poetaster (play)|Poetaster]]'' (1601). Dekker responded with ''[[Satiromastix]]'', subtitled "the untrussing of the humorous poet".&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The final scene of this play, whilst certainly not to be taken at face value as a portrait of Jonson, offers a caricature that is recognisable from Drummond's report – boasting about himself and condemning other poets, criticising performances of his plays and calling attention to himself in any available way.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

This "[[War of the Theatres]]" appears to have ended with reconciliation on all sides. Jonson collaborated with Dekker on a [[procession|pageant]] welcoming [[James I of England|James I]] to England in 1603 although Drummond reports that Jonson called Dekker a rogue. Marston dedicated ''The Malcontent'' to Jonson and the two collaborated with Chapman on ''[[Eastward Ho]]'', a 1605 play whose anti-Scottish sentiment briefly landed both Jonson and Chapman in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gossett|first1=Suzanne|title=Marston, Collaboration, and "Eastward Ho!"|journal=Renaissance Drama|date=2004|volume=33|pages=181–200|jstor=41917391|accessdate=|series=New series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal patronage==
At the beginning of the English reign of [[James VI and I]] in 1603 Jonson joined other poets and playwrights in welcoming the new king. Jonson quickly adapted himself to the additional demand for [[masque]]s and entertainments introduced with the new reign and fostered by both the king and his consort&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; [[Anne of Denmark]]. In addition to his popularity on the public stage and in the royal hall, he enjoyed the patronage of aristocrats such as [[Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland|Elizabeth Sidney]] (daughter of [[Philip Sidney|Sir Philip Sidney]]) and [[Lady Mary Wroth]]. This connection with the Sidney family provided the impetus for one of Jonson's most famous lyrics, the [[country house poems|country house poem]] ''To [[Penshurst Place|Penshurst]]''.

In February 1603 [[John Manningham]] reported that Jonson was living on Robert Townsend, son of [[Roger Townshend (died 1590)|Sir Roger Townshend]], and "scorns the world."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Harvnb|Donaldson|2011|p=428}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps this explains why his trouble with English authorities continued. That same year he was questioned by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] about ''[[Sejanus His Fall|Sejanus]]'', a politically themed play about corruption in the Roman Empire. He was again in trouble for topical allusions in a play, now lost, in which he took part. Shortly after his release from a brief spell of imprisonment imposed to mark the authorities' displeasure at the work, in the second week of October 1605, he was present at a supper party attended by most of the [[Gunpowder Plot]] conspirators. After the plot's discovery he appears to have avoided further imprisonment; he volunteered what he knew of the affair to the investigator [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]] and the [[Privy Council]]. Father Thomas Wright, who heard Fawkes's confession, was known to Jonson from prison in 1598 and Cecil may have directed him to bring the priest before the council, as a witness.&lt;ref name="ID2008"/&gt; (Teague, 249).
[[File:Jonson 1616 folio Workes title page.jpg|200px|thumb|Title page of ''The Workes of Beniamin Ionson'' (1616), the first [[Folio (printing)|folio]] publication that included stage plays]]
At the same time, Jonson pursued a more prestigious career, writing masques for James's court. ''[[The Entertainment at Althorp|The Satyr]]'' (1603) and ''[[The Masque of Blackness]]'' (1605) are two of about two dozen masques which Jonson wrote for James or for Queen Anne, some of them performed at [[Apethorpe Palace]] when the King was in residence. ''The Masque of Blackness'' was praised by [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] as the consummate example of this now-extinct genre, which mingled speech, dancing and spectacle.

On many of these projects he collaborated, not always peacefully, with designer [[Inigo Jones]]. For example, Jones designed the scenery for Jonson's masque ''[[Oberon, the Faery Prince]]'' performed at [[Whitehall]] on 1 January 1611 in which [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Henry]], eldest son of James I, appeared in the title role. Perhaps partly as a result of this new career, Jonson gave up writing plays for the public theatres for a decade. He later told Drummond that he had made less than two hundred pounds on all his plays together.

In 1616 Jonson received a yearly pension of 100 [[Mark (money)|marks]] (about £60), leading some to identify him as England's first [[Poet Laureate]]. This sign of royal favour may have encouraged him to publish the first volume of the folio collected edition of his works that year.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Other volumes followed in 1640–41 and 1692. (See: [[Ben Jonson folios]])

On 8 July 1618 Jonson set out from Bishopsgate in London to walk to Edinburgh, arriving in Scotland's capital on 17 September. For the most part he followed the great north road, and was treated to lavish and enthusiastic welcomes in both towns and country houses.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/884139272|title=Ben Jonson's walk to Scotland : an annotated edition of the 'foot voyage'|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Loxley, James, 1968-, Groundwater, Anna,, Sanders, Julie, 1968-|year=|isbn=9781107003330|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|pages=94, 96|oclc=884139272}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his arrival he lodged initially with John Stuart, a cousin of King James, in Leith, and was made an honorary burgess of Edinburgh at a dinner laid on by the city on 26 September.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He stayed in Scotland until late January 1619, and the best-remembered hospitality he enjoyed was that of the Scottish poet, [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]],&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; sited on the [[River Esk, Lothian|River Esk]]. Drummond undertook to record as much of Jonson's conversation as he could in his diary, and thus recorded aspects of Jonson's personality that would otherwise have been less clearly seen. Jonson delivers his opinions, in Drummond's terse reporting, in an expansive and even magisterial mood. Drummond noted he was "a great lover and praiser of himself, a contemner and scorner of others".&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

On returning to England, he was awarded an [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] [[academic degree|degree]] from Oxford University.

The period between 1605 and 1620 may be viewed as Jonson's heyday. By 1616 he had produced all the plays on which his present reputation as a dramatist is based, including the tragedy ''[[Catiline His Conspiracy|Catiline]]'' (acted and printed 1611), which achieved limited success&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; and the comedies ''[[Volpone]]'' (acted 1605 and printed in 1607), ''[[Epicoene, or the Silent Woman]]'' (1609), ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'' (1610), ''[[Bartholomew Fayre: A Comedy|Bartholomew Fair]]'' (1614) and ''[[The Devil is an Ass]]'' (1616).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; ''The Alchemist'' and ''Volpone'' were immediately successful. Of ''Epicoene'', Jonson told Drummond of a satirical verse which reported that the play's subtitle was appropriate, since its audience had refused to applaud the play (i.e., remained silent). Yet ''Epicoene'', along with ''Bartholomew Fair'' and (to a lesser extent) ''The Devil is an Ass'' have in modern times achieved a certain degree of recognition. While his life during this period was apparently more settled than it had been in the 1590s, his financial security was still not assured.

==Religion==
Jonson recounted that his father had been a prosperous [[Protestant]] landowner until the reign of "[[Mary I of England|Bloody Mary]]" and had suffered imprisonment and the forfeiture of his wealth during that monarch's attempt to restore England to Catholicism. On [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'s accession he was freed and was able to travel to London to become a clergyman.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson (2011: 56)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riggs (1989: 9)&lt;/ref&gt; (All that's known of Jonson's father, who died a month before his son was born, comes from the poet's own narrative.) Jonson's elementary education was in a small church school attached to [[St Martin-in-the-Fields#Medieval and Tudor|St Martin-in-the-Fields]] parish, and at the age of about seven he secured a place at [[Westminster School]], then part of [[Westminster Abbey]].

Notwithstanding this emphatically Protestant grounding, Jonson maintained an interest in Catholic doctrine throughout his adult life and, at a particularly perilous time while a religious war with Spain was widely expected and persecution of Catholics was intensifying, he converted to the faith.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson (2011: 176)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=R51&gt;Riggs (1989: 51–52)&lt;/ref&gt; This took place in October 1598, while Jonson was on remand in [[Newgate Prison|Newgate Gaol]] charged with manslaughter. Jonson's biographer Ian Donaldson is among those who suggest that the conversion was instigated by Father Thomas Wright, a [[Jesuit]] priest who had resigned from the order over his acceptance of Queen Elizabeth's right to rule in England.&lt;ref name=D134&gt;Donaldson (2011: 134–140)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harp; Stewart (2000: xiv)&lt;/ref&gt; Wright, although placed under [[house arrest]] on the orders of [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]], was permitted to minister to the inmates of London prisons.&lt;ref name="D134" /&gt; It may have been that Jonson, fearing that his trial would go against him, was seeking the unequivocal [[Absolution#Roman Catholic Church|
absolution]] that Catholicism could offer if he were sentenced to death.&lt;ref name="R51" /&gt; Alternatively, he could have been looking to personal advantage from accepting conversion since Father Wright's protector, the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]], was among those who might hope to rise to influence after the succession of a new monarch.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson (2011: 143)&lt;/ref&gt; Jonson's conversion came at a weighty time in affairs of state; the royal succession, from the childless Elizabeth, had not been settled and Essex's Catholic allies were hopeful that a sympathetic ruler might attain the throne.

Conviction, and certainly not expedience alone, sustained Jonson's faith during the troublesome twelve years he remained a Catholic. His stance received attention beyond the low-level intolerance to which most followers of that faith were exposed. The first draft of his play ''[[Sejanus His Fall|Sejanus]]'' was banned for "[[Papist|popery]]", and did not re-appear until some offending passages were cut.&lt;ref name="ID2008"/&gt; In January 1606 he (with Anne, his wife) appeared before the [[Consistory Court]] in London to answer a charge of [[recusancy]], with Jonson alone additionally accused of allowing his fame as a Catholic to "seduce" citizens to the cause.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson (2011: 229)&lt;/ref&gt; This was a serious matter (the [[Gunpowder Plot]] was still fresh in mind) but he explained that his failure to take [[Eucharist|communion]] was only because he had not found sound theological endorsement for the practice, and by paying a fine of thirteen shillings (65p) he escaped the more serious penalties at the authorities' disposal. His habit was to slip outside during the sacrament, a common routine at the time—indeed it was one followed by the royal consort, [[Anne of Denmark|Queen Anne]], herself—to show political loyalty while not offending the conscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Maxwell |first=Julie |year=2010 |editor=Sanders, Julie |title=Ben Jonson in context |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |isbn=978-0-521-89571-2 |page=231 |chapter=Religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading church figures, including [[John Overall (bishop)|John Overall]], [[Dean of St Paul's]], were tasked with winning Jonson back to Protestantism, but these overtures were resisted.&lt;ref name=D228&gt;Donaldson (2011: 228–9)&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1610 [[Henry IV of France]] was assassinated, purportedly in the name of the Pope; he had been a Catholic monarch respected in England for tolerance towards Protestants, and his murder seems to have been the immediate cause of Jonson's decision to rejoin the Church of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Walker |first=Anita |year=1995 |author2=Dickerman, Edmund |title=Mind of an Assassin: Ravaillac and the Murder of Henri IV of France |journal=Canadian Journal of History |location=Saskatoon, Saskatchewan |volume=30 |pages=201–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=D272&gt;Donaldson (2011: 272)&lt;/ref&gt; He did this in flamboyant style, pointedly drinking a full chalice of [[communion wine]] at the [[eucharist]] to demonstrate his renunciation of the Catholic rite, in which the priest alone drinks the wine.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Morrill (historian)|Jon Morrill]], quoted in Donaldson (2011: 487)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=R177&gt;Riggs (1989: 177)&lt;/ref&gt; The exact date of the ceremony is unknown.&lt;ref name=D272/&gt; However, his interest in Catholic belief and practice remained with him until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=van den Berg |first=Sara |editor=Harp, Richard |editor2=Stewart, Stanley |title=The Cambridge Companion to Ben Jonson |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |isbn=0-521-64678-2 |page=10 |chapter=True relation: the life and career of Ben Jonson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline and death==
Jonson's productivity began to decline in the 1620s, but he remained well known.  In that time, rose to the prominence the [[Sons of Ben (literary group)|Sons of Ben]] or the "[[Tribe of Ben]]" - those younger poets such as [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]], [[Richard Lovelace]], and [[John Suckling (poet)|Sir John Suckling]] who took their bearing in verse from Jonson. However, a series of setbacks drained his strength and damaged his reputation. He resumed writing regular plays in the 1620s, but these are not considered among his best. They are of significant interest, however, for their portrayal of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s England. ''[[The Staple of News]]'', for example, offers a remarkable look at the earliest stage of English journalism. The lukewarm reception given that play was, however, nothing compared to the dismal failure of ''[[The New Inn]]''; the cold reception given this play prompted Jonson to write a poem condemning his audience (the ''Ode to Myself''), which in turn prompted [[Thomas Carew]], one of the "Tribe of Ben," to respond in a poem that asks Jonson to recognise his own decline.&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal factor in Jonson's partial eclipse was, however, the death of James and the accession of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] in 1625. Jonson felt neglected by the new court. A decisive quarrel with Jones harmed his career as a writer of court masques, although he continued to entertain the court on an irregular basis. For his part, Charles displayed a certain degree of care for the great poet of his father's day: he increased Jonson's annual pension to £100 and included a [[English units of wine casks#Tierce|tierce]] of wine and beer.

Despite the strokes that he suffered in the 1620s, Jonson continued to write. At his death in 1637 he seems to have been working on another play, ''The Sad Shepherd''. Though only two acts are extant, this represents a remarkable new direction for Jonson: a move into [[pastoral]] drama. During the early 1630s he also conducted a correspondence with [[James Howell]], who warned him about disfavour at court in the wake of his dispute with Jones.

Jonson died on or around 16 August 1637, and his funeral was held the next day. It was attended by 'all or the greatest part of the nobility then in town'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He is buried in the north aisle of the nave in [[Westminster Abbey]], with the inscription "O Rare Ben Johnson ''[sic]''" set in the slab over his grave.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref name=DCWA&gt;{{cite web |title=Monuments &amp; Gravestones: Ben Jonson |work=Westminster Abbey 1065 to today |publisher=Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey |url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/history-research/monuments-gravestones/people/12177 |accessdate=26 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107172342/http://www.westminster-abbey.org/history-research/monuments-gravestones/people/12177 |archivedate=7 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Aubrey]], in a more meticulous record than usual, notes that a passer-by, John Young of [[Great Milton]], [[Oxfordshire]], saw the bare grave marker and on impulse paid a workman eighteen pence to make the inscription. Another theory suggests that the tribute came from [[William Davenant]], Jonson's successor as Poet Laureate (and card-playing companion of Young), as the same phrase appears on Davenant's nearby gravestone, but essayist [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]] contends that Davenant's wording represented no more than Young's coinage, cheaply re-used.&lt;ref name=DCWA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hunt |first=Leigh |date=9 April 1828 |title=Life of Sir William Davenant, with specimens of his poetry |series=The Companion |volume=XIV |page=187 |chapter=His epitaph, and Ben Jonson's |oclc=2853686}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Jonson was buried in an upright position was an indication of his reduced circumstances at the time of his death,&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Quincy Adams|Adams, J. Q.]] ''The Jonson Allusion Book''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1922. pp. 195–6&lt;/ref&gt; although it has also been written that he asked for a grave exactly 18&amp;nbsp;inches square from the monarch and received an upright grave to fit in the requested space.&lt;ref name="world and its people"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dunton |first=Larkin |year=1896 |title=The World and Its People |publisher=Silver, Burdett |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson (2011:1)&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been claimed that the inscription could be read "Orare Ben Jonson" (pray for Ben Jonson), possibly in an allusion to Jonson's acceptance of [[Roman Catholic theology|Catholic doctrine]] during his lifetime (although he had returned to the Church of England) but the carving shows a distinct space between  "O" and "rare".&lt;ref name="ID2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Stubbs |first=John |date=24 February 2011 |title=Reprobates |publisher=Viking Penguin |location=London |isbn=978-0-670-91753-2 |page=182 |quote=…a plea for the passerby's prayers (the Latin imperative ''orare'')…}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Fletcher |first=Angus |year=2007 |title=Time, space, and motion in the age of Shakespeare |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=978-0-674-02308-6 |page=95 |chapter=Structure of an epitaph |quote=At first sight the words seem clear enough…but some…have believed that the words intended to say, in Latin, "Pray for Ben Jonson"…}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A monument to Jonson was erected in about 1723 by the Earl of Oxford and is in the eastern aisle of Westminster Abbey's [[Poets' Corner]]. It includes a portrait medallion and the same inscription as on the gravestone. It seems Jonson was to have had a monument erected by subscription soon after his death but the [[English Civil War]] intervened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/ben-jonson |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083717/http://westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/ben-jonson |archivedate=19 August 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drama===
Apart from two tragedies, ''[[Sejanus (play)|Sejanus]]'' and ''[[Catiline: His Conspiracy|Catiline]]'', that largely failed to impress Renaissance audiences, Jonson's work for the public theatres was in comedy. These plays vary in some respects. The minor early plays, particularly those written for [[boy player]]s, present somewhat looser plots and less-developed characters than those written later, for adult companies. Already in the plays which were his salvos in the Poet's War, he displays the keen eye for absurdity and hypocrisy that marks his best-known plays; in these early efforts, however, plot mostly takes second place to variety of incident and comic set-pieces. They are, also, notably ill-tempered. [[Thomas Davies (bookseller)|Thomas Davies]] called ''Poetaster'' "a contemptible mixture of the serio-comic, where the names of [[Augustus Caesar]], [[Maecenas]], [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], [[Ovid]] and [[Tibullus]], are all sacrificed upon the altar of private resentment." Another early comedy in a different vein, ''[[The Case is Altered]]'', is markedly similar to Shakespeare's romantic comedies in its foreign setting, emphasis on genial wit and love-plot. Henslowe's diary indicates that Jonson had a hand in numerous other plays, including many in genres such as English history with which he is not otherwise associated.

The comedies of his middle career, from ''[[Eastward Ho]]'' to ''[[The Devil is an Ass]]'' are for the most part [[city comedy]], with a London setting, themes of trickery and money, and a distinct moral ambiguity, despite Jonson's professed aim in the Prologue to ''[[Volpone]]'' to "mix profit with your pleasure". His late plays or "[[dotages]]", particularly ''[[The Magnetic Lady]]'' and ''The Sad Shepherd'', exhibit signs of an accommodation with the romantic tendencies of [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan comedy]].

Within this general progression, however, Jonson's comic style remained constant and easily recognisable. He announces his programme in the prologue to the [[folio (printing)|folio]] version of ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'': he promises to represent "deeds, and language, such as men do use." He planned to write comedies that revived the classical premises of Elizabethan dramatic theory—or rather, since all but the loosest English comedies could claim some descent from [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]], he intended to apply those premises with rigour.&lt;ref&gt;Doran, 120ff&lt;/ref&gt; This commitment entailed negations: after ''The Case is Altered'', Jonson eschewed distant locations, noble characters, romantic plots and other staples of Elizabethan comedy, focusing instead on the satiric and realistic inheritance of [[new comedy]]. He set his plays in contemporary settings, peopled them with recognisable types, and set them to actions that, if not strictly realistic, involved everyday motives such as greed and [[jealousy]]. In accordance with the temper of his age, he was often so broad in his characterisation that many of his most famous scenes border on the [[farce|farcical]] (as [[William Congreve]], for example, judged ''Epicoene''.) He was more diligent in adhering to the [[classical unities]] than many of his peers—although as [[Margaret Cavendish]] noted, the unity of action in the major comedies was rather compromised by Jonson's abundance of incident. To this classical model Jonson applied the two features of his style which save his classical imitations from mere pedantry: the vividness with which he depicted the lives of his characters, and the intricacy of his plots. Coleridge, for instance, claimed that ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'' had one of the three most perfect plots in literature.

===Poetry===

Jonson's poetry, like his drama, is informed by his classical learning. Some of his better-known poems are close translations of Greek or Roman models; all display the careful attention to form and style that often came naturally to those trained in classics in the [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] manner. Jonson largely avoided the debates about rhyme and meter that had consumed Elizabethan classicists such as [[Thomas Campion]] and [[Gabriel Harvey]]. Accepting both rhyme and stress, Jonson used them to mimic the classical qualities of simplicity, restraint and precision.

"Epigrams" (published in the 1616 folio) is an entry in a genre that was popular among late-Elizabethan and Jacobean audiences, although Jonson was perhaps the only poet of his time to work in its full classical range. The epigrams explore various attitudes, most from the satiric stock of the day: complaints against women, courtiers and spies abound. The condemnatory poems are short and anonymous; Jonson’s epigrams of praise, including a famous poem to Camden and lines to Lucy Harington, are longer and are mostly addressed to specific individuals. Although it is included among the epigrams, "[[On My First Sonne]]" is neither satirical nor very short; the poem, intensely personal and deeply felt, typifies a genre that would come to be called "lyric poetry." It is possible that the spelling of 'son' as 'Sonne' is meant to allude to the [[sonnet]] form, with which it shares some features. A few other so-called epigrams share this quality. Jonson's poems of "The Forest" also appeared in the first folio. Most of the fifteen poems are addressed to Jonson's aristocratic supporters, but the most famous are his country-house poem “[[To Penshurst]]” and the poem “[[To Celia]]” ("Come, my Celia, let us prove") that appears also in ''[[Volpone]]''.

''Underwood'', published in the expanded folio of 1640, is a larger and more heterogeneous group of poems. It contains ''[[A Celebration of Charis]]'', Jonson's most extended effort at love poetry; various religious pieces; [[Encomium|encomiastic poems]] including the poem to Shakespeare and a sonnet on [[Mary Wroth]]; the ''[[Execration against Vulcan]]'' and others. The 1640 volume also contains three elegies which have often been ascribed to Donne (one of them appeared in Donne's posthumous collected poems).

==Relationship with Shakespeare==
[[File:Shakespeare and Jonson at the Mermaid Tavern.jpg|thumb|A 19th century engraving illustrating [[Thomas Fuller]]'s story of [[Shakespeare]] and Jonson debating at the "[[Mermaid Tavern]]".]]

There are many legends about Jonson's rivalry with [[Shakespeare]], some of which may be true.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} Drummond reports that during their conversation, Jonson scoffed at two apparent absurdities in Shakespeare's plays: a nonsensical line in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', and the setting of ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'' on the non-existent seacoast of Bohemia. Drummond also reported Jonson as saying that Shakespeare "wanted art" (i.e., lacked skill). Whether Drummond is viewed as accurate or not, the comments fit well with Jonson's well-known theories about literature.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In [[s:On Shakespeare|"De Shakespeare Nostrat"]] in ''Timber'', which was published posthumously and reflects his lifetime of practical experience, Jonson offers a fuller and more conciliatory comment. He recalls being told by certain actors that Shakespeare never blotted (i.e., crossed out) a line when he wrote. His own claimed response was "Would he had blotted a thousand!"{{efn|Jonson's claim is interesting, since early printings of Shakespeare's work suggest that he tended to start a scene before giving up and trying again. His failure to cross the original attempts out left his printers unsure what needed to be deleted, though also allowed an insight into his creative process.}} However, Jonson explains, "He was, indeed, honest and of an open and free nature, had an excellent phantasy, brave notions and gentle expressions, wherein he flowed with that facility that sometimes it was necessary he should be stopped".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/dscv10h.htm#footnote11 Gutenberg.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Jonson concludes that "there was ever more in him to be praised than to be pardoned." Also when Shakespeare died, he said, "He was not of an age, but for all time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pogue |first1=Kate Emery |year=2006 |title=Shakespeare's Friends |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oy29eyCMNycC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=%22praised+than+to+be+pardoned%22+%22age+but+for+all+time%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22praised%20than%20to%20be%20pardoned%22%20%22age%20but%20for%20all%20time%22&amp;f=false |location=London |publisher=Praeger |page=99 |isbn=0275989569 |access-date=25 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Fuller]] relates stories of Jonson and Shakespeare engaging in debates in the [[Mermaid Tavern]]; Fuller imagines conversations in which Shakespeare would run rings around the more learned but more ponderous Jonson. That the two men knew each other personally is beyond doubt, not only because of the tone of Jonson's references to him but because Shakespeare's company produced a number of Jonson's plays, at least two of which (''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' and ''[[Sejanus His Fall]]'') Shakespeare certainly acted in. However, it is now impossible to tell how much personal communication they had, and tales of their friendship cannot be substantiated.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Jonson's most influential and revealing commentary on Shakespeare is the second of the two poems that he contributed to the prefatory verse that opens Shakespeare's [[First Folio]]. This poem, [[s:To the Memory of My Beloved the Author, Mr. William Shakespeare and What He Hath Left Us|"To the Memory of My Beloved the Author, Mr. William Shakespeare and What He Hath Left Us"]], did a good deal to create the traditional view of Shakespeare as a poet who, despite "small Latine, and lesse Greeke",&lt;ref&gt;W.T. Baldwin [https://web.archive.org/web/20060904145150/http://durer.press.uiuc.edu/baldwin/vol.1/html/2.html 's ''William Shakspere's Smalle Latine and Lesse Greeke'', 1944]&lt;/ref&gt; had a natural genius. The poem has traditionally been thought to exemplify the contrast which Jonson perceived between himself, the disciplined and erudite classicist, scornful of ignorance and sceptical of the masses, and Shakespeare, represented in the poem as a kind of natural wonder whose genius was not subject to any rules except those of the audiences for which he wrote. But the poem itself qualifies this view:
:Yet must I not give Nature all: Thy Art,
:My gentle Shakespeare, must enjoy a part.

Some view this elegy as a conventional exercise, but others see it as a heartfelt tribute to the "Sweet Swan of Avon", the "Soul of the Age!" It has been argued that Jonson helped to edit the [[First Folio]], and he may have been inspired to write this poem by reading his fellow playwright's works, a number of which had been previously either unpublished or available in less satisfactory versions, in a relatively complete form.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Reception and influence==
Jonson was a towering literary figure, and his influence was enormous for he has been described as 'One of the most vigorous minds that ever added to the strength of English literature'.&lt;ref&gt;Morley, Henry, Introduction to ''Discoveries Made Upon Men and Matter and Some Poems'' 1892 kindle ebook 2011 ASIN B004TOT8FQ&lt;/ref&gt; Before the English Civil War, the "Tribe of Ben" touted his importance, and during the Restoration Jonson's satirical comedies and his theory and practice of "humour characters" (which are often misunderstood; see William Congreve's letters for clarification) was extremely influential, providing the blueprint for many Restoration comedies. [[John Aubrey]] wrote of Jonson in "[[Brief Lives]]." By 1700 Jonson's status began to decline. In the Romantic era, Jonson suffered the fate of being unfairly compared and contrasted to Shakespeare, as the taste for Jonson's type of satirical comedy decreased. Jonson was at times greatly appreciated by the Romantics, but overall he was denigrated for not writing in a Shakespearean vein.

In 2012, after more than two decades of research, [[Cambridge University Press]] published the first new edition of Jonson's complete works for 60 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/9423214/Why-should-William-Shakespeare-have-the-last-word-over-Ben-Jonson.html|title=Why should William Shakespeare have the last word over Ben Jonson?|date=24 July 2012|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drama===
As G. E. Bentley notes in ''Shakespeare and Jonson: Their Reputations in the Seventeenth Century Compared'', Jonson's reputation was in some respects equal to Shakespeare's in the 17th century. After the English theatres were reopened on the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], Jonson's work, along with Shakespeare's and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher]]'s, formed the initial core of the Restoration repertory. It was not until after 1710 that Shakespeare's plays (ordinarily in heavily revised forms) were more frequently performed than those of his Renaissance contemporaries. Many critics since the 18th century have ranked Jonson below only Shakespeare among [[English Renaissance theatre|English Renaissance dramatists]]. Critical judgment has tended to emphasise the very qualities that Jonson himself lauds in his prefaces, in ''Timber'', and in his scattered prefaces and dedications: the realism and propriety of his language, the bite of his satire, and the care with which he plotted his comedies.

For some critics, the temptation to contrast Jonson (representing art or craft) with Shakespeare (representing nature, or untutored genius) has seemed natural; Jonson himself may be said to have initiated this interpretation in the second folio, and [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]] drew the same comparison in his [[commonplace book]] later in the century.

At the Restoration, this sensed difference became a kind of critical dogma. [[Charles de Saint-Évremond]] placed Jonson's comedies above all else in English drama, and [[Charles Gildon]] called Jonson the father of English comedy. [[John Dryden]] offered a more common assessment in the "Essay of Dramatic Poesie," in which his [[Avatar]] Neander compares Shakespeare to [[Homer]] and Jonson to [[Virgil]]: the former represented profound creativity, the latter polished artifice. But "artifice" was in the 17th century almost synonymous with "art"; Jonson, for instance, used "artificer" as a synonym for "artist" (''Discoveries,'' 33). For [[Lewis Theobald]], too, Jonson "ow[ed] all his Excellence to his Art,” in contrast to Shakespeare, the natural genius. [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Nicholas Rowe]], to whom may be traced the legend that Jonson owed the production of ''Every Man in his Humour'' to Shakespeare's intercession, likewise attributed Jonson's excellence to learning, which did not raise him quite to the level of genius. A consensus formed: Jonson was the first English poet to understand classical precepts with any accuracy, and he was the first to apply those precepts successfully to contemporary life. But there were also more negative spins on Jonson's learned art; for instance, in the 1750s, [[Edward Young]] casually remarked on the way in which Jonson's learning worked, like Samson's strength, to his own detriment. Earlier, [[Aphra Behn]], writing in defence of female playwrights, had pointed to Jonson as a writer whose learning did not make him popular; unsurprisingly, she compares him unfavourably to Shakespeare. Particularly in the tragedies, with their lengthy speeches abstracted from [[Sallust]] and [[Cicero]], [[Augustan literature|Augustan]] critics saw a writer whose learning had swamped his [[aesthetic]] judgment.

In this period, [[Alexander Pope]] is exceptional in that he noted the tendency to exaggeration in these competing critical portraits: "It is ever the nature of Parties to be in extremes; and nothing is so probable, as that because Ben Johnson had much the most learning, it was said on the one hand that Shakespear had none at all; and because Shakespear had much the most wit and fancy, it was retorted on the other, that Johnson wanted both."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Pope, ed. ''Works of Shakespeare'' (London, 1725), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; For the most part, the 18th century consensus remained committed to the division that Pope doubted; as late as the 1750s, [[Sarah Fielding]] could put a brief recapitulation of this analysis in the mouth of a "man of sense" encountered by David Simple.

Though his stature declined during the 18th century, Jonson was still read and commented on throughout the century, generally in the kind of comparative and dismissive terms just described. [[Heinrich Wilhelm von Gerstenberg]] translated parts of [[Peter Whalley (clergyman)|Peter Whalley]]'s edition into German in 1765. Shortly before the Romantic revolution, [[Edward Capell]] offered an almost unqualified rejection of Jonson as a dramatic poet, who (he writes) "has very poor pretensions to the high place he holds among the English Bards, as there is no original manner to distinguish him and the tedious sameness visible in his plots indicates a defect of Genius."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Craig, D. H., ed. ''Jonson: The Critical Heritage'' (London: Routledge, 1995). p. 499&lt;/ref&gt; The disastrous failures of productions of ''Volpone'' and ''Epicoene'' in the early 1770s no doubt bolstered a widespread sense that Jonson had at last grown too antiquated for the contemporary public; if he still attracted enthusiasts such as [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Earl Camden]] and [[William Gifford]], he all but disappeared from the stage in the last quarter of the century.

The [[Romanticism|romantic]] revolution in criticism brought about an overall decline in the critical estimation of Jonson. Hazlitt refers dismissively to Jonson's "laborious caution." Coleridge, while more respectful, describes Jonson as psychologically superficial: “He was a very accurately observing man; but he cared only to observe what was open to, and likely to impress, the senses.” Coleridge placed Jonson second only to Shakespeare; other romantic critics were less approving. The early 19th century was the great age for recovering Renaissance drama. Jonson, whose reputation had survived, appears to have been less interesting to some readers than writers such as [[Thomas Middleton]] or [[John Heywood]], who were in some senses "discoveries" of the 19th century. Moreover, the emphasis which the romantic writers placed on imagination, and their concomitant tendency to distrust studied art, lowered Jonson's status, if it also sharpened their awareness of the difference traditionally noted between Jonson and Shakespeare. This trend was by no means universal, however; [[William Gifford]], Jonson's first editor of the 19th century, did a great deal to defend Jonson's reputation during this period of general decline. In the next era, [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Swinburne]], who was more interested in Jonson than most [[Victorians]], wrote, "The flowers of his growing have every quality but one which belongs to the rarest and finest among flowers: they have colour, form, variety, fertility, vigour: the one thing they want is fragrance” – by “fragrance,” Swinburne means spontaneity.

In the 20th century, Jonson’s body of work has been subject to a more varied set of analyses, broadly consistent with the interests and programmes of modern literary criticism. In an essay printed in ''The Sacred Wood'', [[T. S. Eliot]] attempted to repudiate the charge that Jonson was an arid classicist by analysing the role of imagination in his dialogue. Eliot was appreciative of Jonson's overall conception and his "surface", a view consonant with the modernist reaction against Romantic criticism, which tended to denigrate playwrights who did not concentrate on representations of psychological depth. Around mid-century, a number of critics and scholars followed Eliot's lead, producing detailed studies of Jonson's verbal style. At the same time, study of Elizabethan themes and conventions, such as those by [[E. E. Stoll]] and [[M. C. Bradbrook]], provided a more vivid sense of how Jonson's work was shaped by the expectations of his time.

The proliferation of new critical perspectives after mid-century touched on Jonson inconsistently. Jonas Barish was the leading figure among critics who appreciated Jonson's artistry. On the other hand, Jonson received less attention from the new critics than did some other playwrights and his work was not of programmatic interest to psychoanalytic critics. But Jonson's career eventually made him a focal point for the revived [[New Historicism|sociopolitical criticism]]. Jonson's works, particularly his masques and pageants, offer significant information regarding the relations of literary production and political power, as do his contacts with and poems for aristocratic patrons; moreover, his career at the centre of London's emerging literary world has been seen as exemplifying the development of a fully commodified literary culture. In this respect he is seen as a transitional figure, an author whose skills and ambition led him to a leading role both in the declining culture of [[patronage]] and in the rising culture of mass consumption.

===Poetry===
Jonson has been called 'the first poet laureate'.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Michael, ''Lives of the Poets'', Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson 1998 {{ISBN|9780753807453}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Jonson's reputation as a playwright has traditionally been linked to Shakespeare, his reputation as a poet has, since the early 20th century, been linked to that of [[John Donne]]. In this comparison, Jonson represents the [[Cavalier poet|cavalier]] strain of poetry, emphasising grace and clarity of expression; Donne, by contrast, epitomised the [[Metaphysical poets|metaphysical]] school of poetry, with its reliance on strained, [[baroque]] metaphors and often vague phrasing. Since the critics who made this comparison ([[Herbert Grierson]] for example), were to varying extents rediscovering Donne, this comparison often worked to the detriment of Jonson's reputation.

In his time Jonson was at least as influential as Donne. In 1623, historian [[Edmund Bolton]] named him the best and most polished English poet. That this judgment was widely shared is indicated by the admitted influence he had on younger poets. The grounds for describing Jonson as the "father" of cavalier poets are clear: many of the cavalier poets described themselves as his "sons" or his "tribe". For some of this tribe, the connection was as much social as poetic; [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Herrick]] described meetings at "the Sun, the Dog, the Triple Tunne".&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; All of them, including those like Herrick whose accomplishments in verse are generally regarded as superior to Jonson's, took inspiration from Jonson's revival of classical forms and themes, his subtle melodies, and his disciplined use of [[wit]]. In these respects Jonson may be regarded as among the most important figures in the prehistory of English [[Augustan literature|neoclassicism]].

The best of Jonson's lyrics have remained current since his time; periodically, they experience a brief vogue, as after the publication of Peter Whalley's edition of 1756. Jonson's poetry continues to interest scholars for the light which it sheds on English literary history, such as politics, systems of patronage and intellectual attitudes. For the general reader, Jonson's reputation rests on a few lyrics that, though brief, are surpassed for grace and precision by very few Renaissance poems: "[[On My First Sonne]]"; "[[To Celia]]"; "[[To Penshurst]]"; and the [[epitaph]] on Salomon Pavy, a [[boy player]]  abducted from his parents who acted in Jonson's plays.

It is in Jonson's ''Timber, or Discoveries...'' that he famously quipped on the manner in which language became a measure of the speaker or writer:

{{quote|Language most shows a man: Speak, that I may see thee. It springs out of the most retired and inmost parts of us, and is the image of the parent of it, the mind. No glass renders a man’s form or likeness so true as his speech. Nay, it is likened to a man; and as we consider feature and composition in a man, so words in language; in the greatness, aptness, sound structure, and harmony of it.|Ben Jonson, 1640 (posthumous)&lt;ref&gt;Jonson, B., "Discoveries and Some Poems," Cassell &amp; Company, 1892.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As with other English Renaissance dramatists, a portion of Ben Jonson's literary output has not survived. In addition to ''[[The Isle of Dogs (play)|The Isle of Dogs]]'' (1597), the records suggest these lost plays as wholly or partially Jonson's work: ''Richard Crookback'' (1602); ''Hot Anger Soon Cold'' (1598), with Porter and [[Henry Chettle]]; ''Page of Plymouth'' (1599), with Dekker; and ''Robert II, King of Scots'' (1599), with Chettle and Dekker. Several of Jonson's masques and entertainments also are not extant: ''The Entertainment at Merchant Taylors'' (1607); ''The Entertainment at Salisbury House for James I'' (1608); and ''The May Lord'' (1613–19).

Finally, there are questionable or borderline attributions. Jonson may have had a hand in ''[[Rollo Duke of Normandy|Rollo, Duke of Normandy, or The Bloody Brother]]'', a play in the canon of John Fletcher and his collaborators. The comedy ''[[The Widow (play)|The Widow]]'' was printed in 1652 as the work of [[Thomas Middleton]], Fletcher and Jonson, though scholars have been intensely sceptical about Jonson's presence in the play. A few attributions of anonymous plays, such as ''[[The London Prodigal]]'', have been ventured by individual researchers, but have met with cool responses.&lt;ref&gt;Logan and Smith, pp. 82–92&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Box Hill artists' camp''' was a site in [[Box Hill, Victoria]], [[Australia]]  favoured for [[plein air]] [[painting]] in the late 1880s by a group of artists who were part of a movement that later became known as the [[Heidelberg School]].

In the summer of 1885/86, [[Tom Roberts]] and [[Frederick McCubbin]] set up a tent on the site near Damper Creek (now [[Gardiners Creek]]) on the property of David Houston, about a mile south of the [[Box Hill railway station, Melbourne|railway station]].&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article122471434 |author=Moore, William|title=How Australian art was born on the road to Heidelberg. |newspaper=[[Canberra Times|The Canberra Times (ACT : 1926 - 1995)]] |location=ACT |date=7 April 1985 |accessdate=28 October 2013 |page=42 Section: Good Weekend |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time the area was relatively untouched [[The Bush|bush]].

Painting activities were carried out on weekends by the two artists over the next few years and at various times other artists would join them including [[Arthur Streeton]], [[Louis Abrahams (art patron)|Louis Abrahams]], [[Charles Conder]], [[Jane Sutherland]], [[Tom Humphrey (artist)|Tom Humphrey]] and [[John Mather (artist)|John Mather]].

'''Brian Douglas Wilson''' (born June 20, 1942) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer who co-founded [[&lt;!-- DO NOT CAPITALIZE --&gt;the Beach Boys]]. After signing with [[Capitol Records]] in 1962, Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than two dozen [[Top 40]] hits for the group.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=34–150}} In addition to his lifelong struggles with [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], Wilson is known for his unorthodox [[Musicianship of Brian Wilson|approaches to pop composition and mastery of recording techniques]]. He is often [[Brian Wilson is a genius|referred to as a "genius"]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Carl|authorlink=Carl Wilson (writer)|title=The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson: America's Mozart?|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20150608-is-this-americas-mozart|publisher=BBC|date=June 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is widely acknowledged as one of the most [[Cultural impact of the Beach Boys|innovative and significant]] songwriters of the late 20th century.&lt;ref name="conversation2015"/&gt;

The Beach Boys were formed by Wilson with his brothers [[Carl Wilson|Carl]] and [[Dennis Wilson|Dennis]], their cousin [[Mike Love]], and friend [[Al Jardine]]. Brian, who grew up influenced by 1950s [[rock and roll]] and [[jazz]]-based vocal groups, originally functioned as the band's songwriter, producer, co-lead vocalist, bassist, keyboardist, and de facto leader. In 1965, he suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] and stopped touring with the group, which led to more personal work such as ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' (1966) and the unfinished ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]''. As his mental health deteriorated, his contributions to the band diminished, and over the next decade, he was reputed for his reclusive lifestyle and [[substance abuse]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=198, 277}} Following a court-ordered removal from the care of psychologist [[Eugene Landy]], Wilson started receiving conventional medical treatment, and in the late 1990s, he began performing and recording consistently as a solo artist. He remains a member of the Beach Boys' corporation, [[Brother Records|Brother Records Inc]].

Wilson was the first [[pop music|pop]] artist credited for writing, arranging, producing, and performing his own material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalfatovic|first=Martin R.|editor-last1=Browne|editor-first1=Ray Broadus|editor-last2=Browne|editor-first2=Pat|title=The Guide to United States Popular Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U3rJxPYT32MC&amp;pg=PA70|year=2001|publisher=Popular Press|isbn=978-0-87972-821-2|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered a major innovator in the field of [[music production]],{{sfn|Moorefield|2010|p=16}} the principal originator of the [[California Sound]],{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=50–51, 57}} one of the first [[music auteur|music producer auteurs]],{{sfn|Edmondson|2013|p=890}} and the first rock producer to [[Recording studio as an instrument|use the studio as its own instrument]].{{sfn|Cogan|Clark|2003|p=33}} The unusual creative control Capitol gave him over his own records effectively set a precedent that allowed other bands and artists to act as their own producers or co-producers. Wilson's success also led to a proliferation of like-minded California producers who helped supplant New York as the center of popular records.{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=54}} The zeitgeist of the early 1960s is commonly associated to his early songs,&lt;ref name="Davis1990"&gt;{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Erik|title=Look!

==Biography==

===1942–1962: Early years and Performances===
[[File:Brian Wilson 1960 yearbook.png|thumb|upright|left|Wilson's senior yearbook photo, 1960]]

Brian Douglas Wilson was born on June 20, 1942, at Centinela Hospital in [[Inglewood, California]], the eldest son of Audree Neva (''née'' Korthof) and [[Murry Wilson]], a musician and machinist.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=40}} His two younger brothers were [[Dennis Wilson|Dennis]] and [[Carl Wilson|Carl]]. He has Dutch, English, German, Irish, and Swedish ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Michael Thomas Meggison |url=http://www.americanancestors.org/ancestry-beach-boys/ |title=#71 Royal Descents, Notable Kin, and Printed Sources: The Immediate New England and Royal Ancestry of the Beach Boys |website=American Ancestors |publisher=New England Historic Genealogical Society |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823011549/http://www.americanancestors.org/ancestry-beach-boys/ |archive-date=August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was two,{{sfn|Leaf|1978|p=14}} the family moved from Inglewood to 3701 West 119th Street in nearby [[Hawthorne, California]].{{sfn|Stebbins|2007|p=14}} Speaking of Wilson's unusual musical abilities prior to his first birthday, his father said that, as a baby, he could repeat the melody from "When the Caissons Go Rolling Along" after only a few verses had been sung by the father. Murry Wilson said, "He was very clever and quick. I just fell in love with him."{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=11}} At about age two, Wilson heard [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', which had an enormous emotional impact on him.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=10}} A few years later, he was discovered to have diminished hearing in his right ear. The exact cause of this hearing loss is unclear, though theories range from him simply being born partially [[Hearing loss|deaf]] to a blow to the head from his father, or a neighborhood bully, being to blame.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=12}}

While Wilson's father was ostensibly a reasonable provider, he is believed to have been frequently abusive.{{editorializing|date=May 2018}} A minor musician and songwriter, Wilson's father encouraged his children in the music field in numerous ways. At an early age, Wilson was given six weeks of lessons on a "toy accordion" and, at seven and eight, sang solos in church with a choir behind him.{{sfn|Leaf|1978|pp=15–17}} At [[Hawthorne High School (Hawthorne, California)|Hawthorne High School]], Wilson was on the [[American football|football team]] as a [[quarterback]], played baseball and was a cross-country runner in his senior year.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=15}} He sang with various students at school functions and with his family and friends at home, teaching his two brothers harmony parts that all three would then practice. He also played piano obsessively after school, deconstructing the harmonies of [[the Four Freshmen]] by listening to short segments of their songs on a [[phonograph]], then working to recreate the blended sounds note by note on the keyboard.{{sfn|Stebbins|2007|p=18}} He received a [[Wollensak]] [[tape recorder]] on his 16th birthday, allowing him to experiment with recording songs and early group vocals.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=14}}

One of Wilson's earliest public performances was at a fall arts program at his high school. He enlisted his cousin and frequent singing partner [[Mike Love]], and to entice Carl into the group, named the newly formed membership "Carl and the Passions." The performance featured tunes by [[Dion and the Belmonts]] and the Four Freshmen ("It's a Blue World"), the latter of which proved difficult for the ensemble. The event was notable for the impression which it made on another musician and classmate of Wilson's in the audience that night, [[Al Jardine]].  Jardine would join the three Wilson brothers and Mike Love a few years later in the Beach Boys.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=24}}

Wilson enrolled at [[El Camino College]] in Los Angeles, majoring in psychology, in September 1960. He continued his music studies at the [[community college]] as well.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=15}} At some point in 1961 he wrote his first all-original melody, loosely based on a Dion and the Belmonts version of "[[When You Wish Upon a Star]]". The song was eventually known as "[[Surfer Girl (song)|Surfer Girl]]". Although an early demo of the song was recorded in February 1962 at World-Pacific Studios, it was not re-recorded and released until 1963, when it became a top-ten hit.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|pp=27–31}}

Wilson, his brothers Carl and Dennis, Mike Love and Al Jardine first appeared as a music group in the summer of 1961, initially under the name the Pendletones. After being prodded by Dennis to write a song about the local water-sports craze, Wilson and Mike Love together created what became the  first single for the band, "[[Surfin' (song)|Surfin']]". Over Labor Day weekend 1961, Wilson took advantage of the fact that his parents were in Mexico City for several days, and the boys used the emergency money his parents had left to rent an amplifier, a microphone, and a stand-up bass for Jardine to play. After the boys rehearsed for two days in the Wilsons' music room, his parents returned home from their trip. Eventually impressed, Murry Wilson proclaimed himself the group's manager and the band embarked on serious rehearsals for a proper studio session.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=28–29}}

Recorded by Hite and Dorinda Morgan and released on the small [[Candix Records]] label, "Surfin'" became a top local hit in Los Angeles and reached number seventy-five on the national [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] sales charts.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=30–31}} Dennis later described the first time that his older brother heard their song on the radio, as the three Wilson brothers and [[David Marks (musician)|David Marks]] drove in Wilson's 1957 Ford in the rain: "Nothing will ever top the expression on Brian's face, ever&amp;nbsp;... ''that'' was the all-time moment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/the-beach-boys/bio/|title=The Beach Boys Biography &amp;#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|publisher=Rockhall.com|date=April 15, 2013|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danaddington.com/denny/quotes.html|title=Dennis Wilson: quotes|publisher=Danaddington.com|date=|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Pendletones were no more. Without the band's knowledge or permission, Candix Records had changed their name to the Beach Boys.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=16–17}} Wilson and his bandmates, following a set by [[Ike &amp; Tina Turner]], performed their first major live show at the [[Ritchie Valens]] Memorial Dance on New Year's Eve, 1961. Three days previously, Wilson's father had bought him an electric bass and amplifier. Wilson had learned to play the instrument in that short period of time, with Al Jardine moving to rhythm guitar. On stage, Wilson provided many of the lead vocals, and often harmonized with the group in [[falsetto]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Looking for a follow-up single for their radio hit, Wilson and Mike Love wrote "[[Surfin' Safari (song)|Surfin' Safari]]", and attempts were made to record a usable take at World Pacific, including overdubs, on February 8, 1962, along with several other tunes including an early version of "Surfer Girl". Only a few days later, discouraged about the band's financial prospects, and objecting to adding some [[Chubby Checker]] songs to the Beach Boys live setlist, Al Jardine abruptly left the group, but rejoined shortly thereafter.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=20}} When Candix Records ran into money problems and sold the Beach Boys' master recordings to another label, Wilson's father terminated the contract. As "Surfin'" faded from the charts, Wilson, who had forged a songwriting partnership with [[Gary Usher]], created several new songs, including a car song, "[[409 (song)|409]]", that Usher helped them write. Wilson and the Beach Boys cut new tracks at [[United Western Recorders|Western Recorders]] including an updated "Surfin' Safari" and "409". These songs convinced Capitol Records to release the demos as a single; they became a [[A-side and B-side#Double A-side|double-sided]] national hit.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=22–23}}

===1962–1964: Success and record producing===
[[File:The Beach Boys TV (cropped Brian).jpg|thumb|right|Wilson performing on electric bass with the Beach Boys, 1964.]]
Recording sessions for the band's first album took place in [[Capitol Studios|Capitol's basement studios]] in the [[Capitol Records Building|famous tower building]] in August 1962, but early on Wilson lobbied for a different place to cut Beach Boy tracks. The large rooms were built to record the big orchestras and ensembles of the 1950s, not small rock groups. At Wilson's insistence, Capitol agreed to let the Beach Boys pay for their own outside recording sessions, to which Capitol would own all the rights, and in return the band would receive a higher royalty rate on their record sales. Additionally, during the taping of their first LP Wilson fought for, and won, the right to be in charge of the production – though this fact was not acknowledged with an album liner notes production credit.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=26}}

In January 1963, the Beach Boys recorded their first top-ten (cresting at number three in the United States) single, "[[Surfin' U.S.A. (song)|Surfin' U.S.A.]]", which began their long run of highly successful recording efforts at Hollywood's [[United Western Recorders]] on [[Sunset Boulevard]]. It was during the sessions for this single that Wilson made the production decision from that point on to use [[double tracking]] on the group's vocals, resulting in a deeper and more resonant sound.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=32}} The [[Surfin' U.S.A.|''Surfin' U.S.A.'' album]] was also a big hit in the United States, reaching number two on the national sales charts by early July 1963. The Beach Boys had become a top-rank recording and touring band.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=40}}

Wilson was for the first time officially credited as the Beach Boys' producer on the ''[[Surfer Girl]]'' album, recorded in June and July 1963 and released that September. This LP reached number seven on the national charts, containing singles that were top 15 hits. Feeling that surfing songs had become limiting, Wilson decided to produce a set of largely car-oriented tunes for the Beach Boys' fourth album, ''[[Little Deuce Coupe]]'', which was released in October 1963, only three weeks after the ''Surfer Girl'' LP. The departure of guitarist David Marks from the band that month meant that Wilson was forced to resume touring with the Beach Boys, for a time reducing his availability in the recording studio.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=39–42}}

{{listen|filename=The Honeys - He's A Doll.ogg|pos=left|title=The Honeys – "He's A Doll" (1964)|description=Written and produced by Brian Wilson, "[[The Honeys|He's A Doll]]" was one of several attempts by Wilson to branch away from the Beach Boys.&lt;ref name=petp/&gt;

For much of the decade, Wilson attempted to establish himself as a record producer by working with various artists. On July 20, 1963, "[[Surf City (song)|Surf City]]", which he co-wrote with [[Jan Berry]] of [[Jan and Dean]], was his first composition to reach the top of the US charts. The resulting success pleased Wilson, but angered both Murry and Capitol Records. Murry went so far as to order his oldest son to sever any future collaborations with Jan and Dean. Wilson's other non-Beach Boy work in this period included tracks by [[the Castells]], [[Donna Loren]], Sharon Marie, the Timers, and the Survivors. The most notable group to which Wilson would attach himself in this era would be [[the Honeys]], which Wilson intended as the female counterpart to the Beach Boys, and as an attempt to compete with [[Phil Spector]]-led girl groups such as [[the Crystals]] and [[the Ronettes]].&lt;ref name=petp&gt;{{cite web|last=Vinnis|first=Rob|title=Pet Projects liner notes|url=http://albumlinernotes.com/Pet_Projects.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued juggling between recording with the Beach Boys and producing records for other artists, but with less success at the latter—except for Jan and Dean.&lt;ref name="HimesSurf"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Himes|first1=Geoffrey|title=Surf Music|url=http://teachrock.org/media/essays/surf_himes_with_maia_edits_2.pdf|website=teachrock.org|publisher=Rock and Roll: An American History|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125223127/http://teachrock.org/media/essays/surf_himes_with_maia_edits_2.pdf|archivedate=November 25, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1964–1967: Artistic growth===

====Resignation from touring and changing scene ====
The Beach Boys' rigorous performing schedule increasingly burdened Wilson, and following a panic attack on board a flight from L.A. to Houston on December 23, 1964,&lt;ref name="AC interview"/&gt; he stopped performing live with the group in an effort to concentrate solely on songwriting&lt;ref name="Riding a wave"&gt;{{cite news |first=Robin|last=Denselow|title=Feature: ''Riding a wave''|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|issue=September 1, 1976|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studio production.&lt;ref name="AC interview"/&gt; Wilson explained in 1971: "I felt I had no choice. I was run down mentally and emotionally because I was running around, jumping on jets from one city to another on one-night stands, also producing, writing, arranging, singing, planning, teaching—to the point where I had no peace of mind and no chance to actually sit down and think or even rest."&lt;ref name="Nolan1971"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Nolan|first=Tom|title=The Beach Boys: A California Saga|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=October 28, 1971|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-beach-boys-a-california-saga-19711028|issue=94|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glen Campbell]] was called in as his temporary stand-in for live performances,&lt;ref name="A Boy's own story"/&gt; before [[Bruce Johnston]] replaced him.

It was during that December that Wilson was introduced to [[cannabis]] hesitantly by his friend Lorren Daro (formerly Loren Schwartz), an assistant at the [[William Morris Agency]].{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=87}} Attracted by the drug's ability to alleviate stress and inspire creativity, Wilson completed the Beach Boys' forthcoming ''[[The Beach Boys Today!|Today!]]'' album by late January 1965 and quickly began work on their next, ''[[Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)|Summer Days]]''. Sometime in April, Wilson experienced his first [[acid trip]], which had a profound effect on his musical and spiritual conceptions.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=136}} Again, Daro was hesitant to provide drugs to Wilson, which he did not feel he was ready for, but has recounted that his dosage was "one hundred and twenty-five [[Microgram|mics]] of pure [[Owsley Stanley|Owsley]]," and that "he had the full-on [[ego death]]. It was a beautiful thing."{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=174–175}} The music for "[[California Girls]]" came from this first LSD experience, a composition which would later be released as a #3 charting single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boucher|first=Geoff|title='California Girls' The Beach Boys|pages=F-4|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=August 12, 2007|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/12/entertainment/ca-socalsong12|accessdate=August 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson continued experimenting with [[psychotropics]] for the next few years, sometimes even during recording sessions.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=276}} He became fixated on [[psychedelia]], claiming to have coined a slang, "psychedelicate,"{{sfn|Siegel|1967}} and foreseeing that "[[psychedelic music]] will cover the face of the world and color the whole popular music scene."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parks|first=Van Dyke|title=IN RESPONSE TO: A Lost Pop Symphony from the September 22, 2005 issue|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2006/jan/12/smile/|work=The New York Review of Books|publisher=nybooks.com|date=January 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week after his first LSD trip, Wilson began suffering from [[auditory hallucination]]s, which have persisted throughout his life.&lt;ref name="Ability"&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Brian Wilson – A Powerful Interview|magazine=Ability|year=2006|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/past/brianW/brianw.html|accessdate=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Pet Sounds'', "genius" promotion, and ''Smile''====
{{Main|Pet Sounds|Smile (The Beach Boys album)}}
[[File:Brian Wilson 1966.png|thumb|right|Wilson in 1966]]
In late 1965, Wilson began working on material for a new project, ''[[Pet Sounds]]''. He formed a temporary songwriting partnership with lyricist [[Tony Asher]], who was suggested to Wilson by mutual friend Daro.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=194}} Wilson, who had recorded the album's instrumentation with [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|the Wrecking Crew]], then assembled the Beach Boys to record vocal [[overdub]]s, following their return from a tour of Japan. Upon hearing what Wilson had created for the first time in 1965,&lt;ref name="AC interview"/&gt; the group, particularly [[Mike Love]], was somewhat critical of their leader's music,&lt;ref name="A Boy's own story"/&gt; and expressed their dissatisfaction.&lt;ref name="AC interview"/&gt; At this time, Wilson still had considerable control within the group and, according to Wilson, they eventually overcame their initial negative reaction, as his newly created music began to near completion.&lt;ref name="AC interview"/&gt; The album was released May 16, 1966, and, despite modest sales figures at the time, has since become widely critically acclaimed, often being cited among the all-time greatest albums. Although the record was issued under the group's name, ''Pet Sounds'' is arguably seen as a Brian Wilson solo album. Wilson even toyed with the idea by releasing "[[Caroline, No]]" as a solo single in March 1966, it reaching number 32 on the ''Billboard'' charts.&lt;ref name="Pet Sounds Billboard Singles"&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: ''Pet Sounds, Charts &amp; Awards, Billboard Singles''|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1420|pure_url=yes}} |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation|Macrovision Corporation]] |accessdate=August 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2015}}

During the ''Pet Sounds'' sessions, Wilson had been working on another song, which was held back from inclusion on the record as he felt that it was not sufficiently complete. The song "[[Good Vibrations]]" set a new standard for musicians and for what could be achieved in the recording studio. Recorded in multiple sessions and in numerous studios, the song eventually cost $50,000 ({{Inflation|US|50000|1966|fmt=eq}}) to record within a six-month period.&lt;ref name="The nutty producers"&gt;{{cite news|first=Sean|last=O'Hagan|title=Feature: ''The nutty producers''|newspaper=[[The Guardian#G2|G2]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|issue=December 16, 1999|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1966, it was released as a single, giving the Beach Boys their third US number-one hit after "[[I Get Around]]" and "[[Help Me, Rhonda]]". It sold over a million copies.

Sometime after ''Pet Sounds'' was released, the Beatles' press agent [[Derek Taylor]] started working as a publicist for the Beach Boys. He gradually became aware of Wilson's reputation as a "genius" among musician friends, a belief that wasn't widely held at the time.{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=27}} Motivated by Wilson's musical merits, Taylor responded with a campaign that would reestablish the band's outdated surfing image, and was the first to tout Wilson as a "genius".{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=27}}{{sfn|Priore|2005|pp=63–64}} According to Van Dyke Parks, this was "much to Brian's embarrassment".{{sfn|Priore|2005|pp=63–64}}

By the time of the universal success of "Good Vibrations", Wilson was underway with his next project, ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'', which Wilson described as a "teenage symphony to God." "Good Vibrations" had been recorded in modular style, with separately written sections individually tracked and spliced together, and Wilson's concept for the new album was more of the same, representing a departure from the standard live-taped performances typical of studio recordings at that time. Having been introduced to [[Van Dyke Parks]] at a garden party at [[Terry Melcher]]'s home, Wilson liked Parks' "visionary eloquence" and began working with him in the fall of 1966.&lt;ref name="The unknown surfer"&gt;{{cite news|author=Hodgkinson, Will|title=Feature: ''The unknown surfer''|work=Friday Review|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|issue=December 10, 1999|pages=16–17|authorlink=Will Hodgkinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Wilson famously installed a sandbox and tent in his living room, the pair collaborated closely on several ''Smile'' tracks. Conflict within the group and Wilson's own growing personal problems threw the project into [[Collapse of Smile|terminal disarray]]. Originally scheduled for release in January 1967, the release date was continually pushed back until press officer [[Derek Taylor]] announced its cancellation in May 1967.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===1967–1975: Career decline===
====Home studio, institutionalization, and reduced band involvement====

{{Quote box |align=right |salign = left |quote=We pulled out of that production pace, really because I was about ready to die. I was trying so hard. So, all of a sudden I decided not to try any more, and not try and do such great things, such big musical things. And we had so much fun.

I didn't have any paranoia feelings. |source=—Brian Wilson, January 1968&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Highwater|first=Jamake|title=Rock and other four letter words; music of the electric generation.|year=1968|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|isbn=0552043346}}&lt;/ref&gt; |width  = 25%}}

By 1967, Wilson's life was on the verge of a serious decline. Following the cancellation of ''Smile'', the Beach Boys relocated to a studio situated in the living room of Wilson's new mansion in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]] (once the home of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}), where the band would primarily record until 1972. This has been perceived by some commentators as "the moment when the Beach Boys first started slipping from the vanguard to nostalgia."&lt;ref name="AC interview"&gt;{{cite web |first=Greg|last=Beets |title=Review: ''Pet Sounds: Fifteen Minutes With Brian Wilson''|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid:77984|date=July 21, 2000|publisher=Nick Barbaro |accessdate=August 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jonathan Perry Stern |year=2012 |page=106 [https://books.google.com/books?id=4O5qzMV2kKcC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;f=false Retrieved April 12, 2018.] |title=Memoirs of a Bipolar Ex-Podiatrist |publisher=Dorrance Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout mid-to-late 1967, Wilson oversaw the production of only a few heavily orchestrated songs holding continuity with his ''Pet Sounds'' and ''Smile'' work, such as "[[Can't Wait Too Long]]" and "[[Time to Get Alone]]". Wilson's interest in the Beach Boys began to wane. Carl explained: "When we did ''Wild Honey'', Brian asked me to get more involved in the recording end. He wanted a break. He was tired. He had been doing it all too long."&lt;ref name="MF1976" /&gt;

Still psychologically overwhelmed by the cancellation of ''Smile'' and the imminent birth of his first child [[Carnie Wilson]] in 1968 amid the looming financial insolvency of the Beach Boys, Wilson's creative directorship within the band became increasingly tenuous; additionally, [[cocaine]] had begun to supplement Wilson's regular use of amphetamines, marijuana, and psychedelics.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=139}} Shortly after abandoning an intricate arrangement of Kern and Hammerstein's "Ol' Man River" at the instigation of Mike Love,{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=139, 141}} Wilson entered a [[psychiatric hospital]] for a brief period of time. Biographer [[Peter Ames Carlin]] has speculated that Wilson had self-admitted and may have been administered a number of treatments ranging from [[talking therapies]] to doses of [[Lithium (medication)|Lithium]] and [[electroconvulsive therapy]] during this stay.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=141}}

In his absence, 1969's ''[[20/20 (The Beach Boys album)|20/20]]'' consisted substantially of key ''Smile'' outtakes ("[[Cabinessence]]" and "[[Our Prayer]]") along with the long-germinating "Time to Get Alone". The album's lead track, the Wilson/Love-authored "[[Do It Again (Beach Boys song)|Do It Again]]", was an unabashed throwback to the band's earlier surf hits, and had been an international hit in the summer of 1968, reaching number 20 in the US charts and number 1 in the UK and Australia while also scoring well in other countries. During this phase, Wilson also collaborated with his father (credited under the pseudonym of Reggie Dunbar) on "[[Break Away (The Beach Boys song)|Break Away]]", the band's final single for Capitol Records under their original contract; although relatively unsuccessful in the US (peaking at number 63 in ''Billboard''), the song reached number 6 on the British singles chart.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

At a press conference ostensibly convened to promote "Break Away" to the European media shortly thereafter, Wilson intimated that "We owe everyone money. And if we don't pick ourselves off our backsides and have a hit record soon, we will be in worse trouble&amp;nbsp;... I've always said, 'Be honest with your fans.' I don't see why I should lie and say that everything is rosy when it's not." These incendiary remarks ultimately thwarted long-simmering contract negotiations with [[Deutsche Grammophon]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=149}} Although Murry Wilson's sale of the [[Sea of Tunes]] publishing company (including the majority of Wilson's oeuvre) to [[A&amp;M Records]]' publishing division for $700,000 at the band's commercial nadir in 1969 renewed the longstanding animus{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=169}} between father and son, the younger Wilson stood in for Mike Love during a 1970 Northwest tour when Love was convalescing from illness. He also resumed writing and recording with the Beach Boys at a brisk pace; seven of the twelve new songs on the 1970 album ''[[Sunflower (The Beach Boys album)|Sunflower]]'' were either written or co-written by Wilson. Nevertheless, the album (retrospectively appraised as "perhaps the strongest album they released post-''Pet Sounds''" by [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11665-sunflowersurfs-up/|title=The Beach Boys: Sunflower/Surf's Up Album Review|website=pitchfork.com|accessdate=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a commercial failure in the US, peaking at number 151 during a four-week ''Billboard'' chart stay in October 1970. Following the termination of the Capitol contract in 1969, the band's new contract with then-au courant [[Reprise Records]] (brokered by Van Dyke Parks, employed as a multimedia executive at the company at the time) stipulated Wilson's proactive involvement with the band in all albums,{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=150}} a factor that would become hugely problematic for the band in the years to come.

Sometime in 1969, Wilson opened a short-lived [[health food store]] called [[The Radiant Radish]].&lt;ref name="Nolan1971"/&gt; The store closed in 1971 due to unprofitable produce expenditures and Wilson's general lack of business acumen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hind|first=John|title=This much I know – Brian Wilson, musician, 66, London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/aug/24/popandrock|accessdate=June 28, 2013|newspaper=The Observer|date=August 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports from this era detailed Wilson as "increasingly withdrawn, brooding, hermitic&amp;nbsp;... and occasionally, he is to be seen in the back of some limousine, cruising around Hollywood, bleary and unshaven, huddled way tight into himself."{{sfn|Cohn|1970|pp=103–104}} This notion was contested by lyricist and close friend Stanley Shapiro.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=172}} Nevertheless, Wilson's reputation suffered as a result of his purported eccentricities, and he quickly became known as a commercial has-been whom record labels feared.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=172}} When Shapiro persuaded Wilson to rewrite and rerecord a number of Beach Boys songs in order to reclaim his legacy, he contacted fellow songwriter [[Tandyn Almer]] (whom Wilson would later characterize as his "best friend")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carlindustries.com/happy-birthday-brian-wilson-an-extra-bonus-interview-with-a-man-made-for-all-times/|title=Happy Birthday, Brian Wilson!: An extra-bonus interview with a man made for all times.|website=carlindustries.com|accessdate=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for support. The trio then spent a month reworking cuts from the Beach Boys' ''Friends'' album.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=172–173}} As Shapiro handed demo tapes to [[A&amp;M Records]] executives, they found the product favorable before they learned of Wilson and Almer's involvement, and proceeded to veto the idea.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=173}}{{refn|group=nb|Wilson's close friendship with Almer reportedly deteriorated by early 1972 due to a variety of factors, including an alleged liaison between Almer and [[Marilyn Wilson]] and the purported theft of recording equipment from Wilson's home studio.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=250}}}} Wilson commented in 1976:

{{quote|Once you've been labeled as a genius, you have to continue it or your name becomes mud. I am a victim of the recording industry. I didn't think I was a genius. I thought I had talent. But I didn't think I was a genius.&lt;ref name="MF1976"&gt;{{cite magazine|title=The Beach Boys|magazine=Music Favorites|volume=1|issue=2|date=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, Wilson amassed myriad home demo recordings which later became informally known as the "[[Bedroom Tapes]]".&lt;ref name=Bedroom2014&gt;{{cite news|last=Chidester|first=Brian|title=Brian Wilson's Secret Bedroom Tapes|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2014-01-30/music/brian-wilsons-secret-bedroom-tapes/|accessdate=February 1, 2014|newspaper=LA Weekly|date=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these recordings remain unreleased and unheard by the public. Some of the material has been described as "schizophrenia on tape," and "intensely personal songs of gentle humanism and strange experimentation, which reflected on his then-fragile emotional state."&lt;ref name=Bedroom2014/&gt; Beach Boys archivist Alan Boyd observed: "A lot of the music that Brian was creating during this period was full of [[syncopation|syncopated exercises]] and [[counterpoint]]s piled on top of jittery eighth-note clusters and loping [[Swing (jazz performance style)|shuffle grooves]]. You get hints of it earlier in things like the tags to 'California Girls,' '[[Wouldn't It Be Nice]]' and all throughout ''Smile'', but it takes on an almost manic edge in the '70s."&lt;ref name=Bedroom2014/&gt; Wilson's daughter [[Wendy Wilson|Wendy]] remembers, "Where other people might take a run to release some stress, he would go to the piano and write a 5-minute song."&lt;ref name=IJWMFTT&gt;''[[I Just Wasn't Made For These Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Her sister Carnie has recounted: "My memories of him are him wandering from room to room&amp;nbsp;... thinking about ''something''. I always wanted to know what he was thinking, you know? Who knows what he was thinking in his head? ... We got used to what the whole environment was. It was very musical; there was always a piano going. Either "Rhapsody in Blue" was playing, or&amp;nbsp;..."[[Be My Baby]]"—I mean—I woke up every morning to ''boom boom-boom pow!

{{listen|filename=Til I Die Beach Boys.ogg|title= "'Til I Die" from ''Surf's Up'' (1971)|description=Initially demoed in 1969 and largely recorded in 1970, Wilson has referred to "[['Til I Die]]" as the most personal song he ever wrote for the Beach Boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquarterly.com/bellagio/gigs70.html|title=GIGS70|publisher=Esquarterly.com|date=April 17, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=288}}}}

While working at the Radiant Radish, Wilson met journalist and radio presenter [[Jack Rieley]], who would manage the Beach Boys and act as Wilson's principal lyricist for the next few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunflower/Surf's Up 2000 liner notes|url=http://albumlinernotes.com/Sunflower_Surf_s_Up.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson played and sang on much of the 1971 ''[[Surf's Up (album)|Surf's Up]]'' album—the band's highest American album chart placement (No. 29) since 1967—and wrote or co-wrote four of the album's ten songs, including the title track. However, only one fully formed original song from Wilson emerged during the album's nominal recording sessions, the dirge-like "[[A Day in the Life of a Tree]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquarterly.com/bellagio/gigs71.html|title=GIGS71|publisher=Esquarterly.com|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to engineer [[Stephen Desper]], the cumulatively deleterious effects of Wilson's cocaine and tobacco use began to affect his vocal register in earnest during the ''Surf's Up ''sessions.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=160}}

[[File:The Beach Boys 1971 Central Park.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The Beach Boys performing in the early 1970s without Wilson]]

In late 1971 and early 1972, he worked on an album for the [[American Spring]], titled ''[[Spring (American Spring album)|Spring]]'', a new collaboration between erstwhile Honeys Marilyn Wilson and Diane Rovell. He was closely involved in the home-based recordings with co-producer David Sandler and engineer Stephen Desper, and did significant work on more than half of the tracks. As with much of his work in the era, his contributions "ebbed and flowed."{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=176}} According to [[Dan Peek]] of [[America (band)|America]], Wilson "held court like a Mad King as [longtime friend] [[Danny Hutton]] scurried about like his court jester" during the ascendant band's engagement at the [[Whisky a Go Go]] in February 1972.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=168}} Concurrently, he contributed to three out of eight songs on Beach Boys' ''[[Carl and the Passions – "So Tough"]]'' (1972).

Later that year, he reluctantly agreed to accompany the band to the Netherlands, where they based themselves to record ''[[Holland (album)|Holland]]''. Although physically present, he often yielded to his vices (primarily hashish and [[hard cider]]) and rarely participated, confining himself to work on "Funky Pretty" (a collaboration with Mike Love and Jack Rieley); a one-line sung intro to Al Jardine's "[[California Saga: California]]"; and ''Mount Vernon and Fairway (A Fairy Tale)'', a narrative suite musically inspired by [[Randy Newman]]'s [[Sail Away (Randy Newman album)|''Sail Away'']] that was promptly rejected by the band. However, Carl Wilson ultimately capitulated and ensured that the suite would be released as a bonus EP with the album.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p = 182}} When the album itself was rejected by Reprise, the song "[[Sail On, Sailor]]"—a collaboration with Van Dyke Parks dating from 1971 that had grown to encompass additional lyrical contributions solicited by Wilson at parties hosted by Hutton—was inserted at the instigation of Parks and released as the lead single.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p = 184}} It promptly garnered a considerable amount of [[FM radio]] play, became a minor chart hit, and entered the band's live sets as a concert staple.

In 1973, Jan Berry (under the alias JAN) released the single "[[Don't You Just Know It]]", a duet featuring Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discography 1970s|url=http://www.jananddean-janberry.com/main/index.php/disc/disc1970s|website=jananddean-janberry.com|accessdate=October 5, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141123021334/http://www.jananddean-janberry.com/main/index.php/disc/disc1970s|archive-date=November 23, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recluse period====
{{Quote box|align=right |image= right |quote=I was snorting cocaine, which I shouldn't have gotten into. It messed up my mind, and it unplugged me from music. I just remember reading magazines.

Wilson spent a great deal of the two years following his father's June 1973 death, [[Seclusion|secluded]] in the chauffeur's quarters of his home; sleeping, [[alcohol abuse|abusing alcohol]], taking drugs (including heroin), overeating, and exhibiting [[self-destructive behavior]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=198}} He attempted to drive his vehicle off a cliff, and at another time, demanded that he would be pushed into and buried in a grave that he had dug in his backyard.&lt;ref name=Bedroom2014 /&gt; During this period, his voice deteriorated significantly as a result of his mass consumption of cocaine and incessant [[chain smoking]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=180}} Wilson later said that he was preoccupied with "[doing] drugs and hanging out with Danny Hutton" (whose house became the center of Wilson's social life) during the mid-1970s.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=265}} [[John Sebastian]] often showed up at Wilson's Bel Air home "to jam" and later recalled that "it wasn't all grimness."{{sfn|Dillon|2012}} Although increasingly [[Recluse|reclusive]] during the day, Wilson spent many nights at Hutton's house fraternizing with [[the Hollywood Vampires|Hollywood Vampire]] colleagues, such as [[Alice Cooper]] and [[Iggy Pop]], who were mutually bemused by an extended Wilson-led singalong of the folk song "[[Shortnin' Bread#The Beach Boys|Shortnin' Bread]]"; other visitors of Hutton's home included Vampires [[Harry Nilsson]], [[John Lennon]], [[Ringo Starr]], and [[Keith Moon]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=172}} [[Micky Dolenz]] recalls taking LSD with Wilson, Lennon, and Nilsson, where Wilson "played just one note on a piano over and over again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dolenz|first1=Micky|last2=Bego|first2=Mark|title=I'm a Believer|date=2004|publisher=Cooper Square Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-81541-284-7|pages=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; On several occasions, Marilyn Wilson sent her friends to climb Hutton's fence and retrieve her husband.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=265}}

[[Jimmy Webb]] reported Wilson's presence at an August 2, 1974 session for Nilsson's "[[Duit on Mon Dei|Salmon Falls]]"; he kept in the back of the studio playing "[[Da Doo Ron Ron]]" haphazardly on a [[Hammond organ|B3 organ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shipton|first1=Alyn|title=Nilsson: The Life of a Singer-Songwriter|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19975-657-5|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, he was photographed at Moon's 28th birthday party (held on August 28 at the [[Beverly Wilshire Hotel]]) wearing only his bathrobe. Sometime in 1974, Wilson interrupted a set by jazz musician [[Larry Coryell]] at [[The Troubadour, West Hollywood|The Troubadour]] by leaping onto stage and singing "[[Be-Bop-A-Lula]]", again wearing slippers and a bathrobe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Brian's Back|magazine=Newsweek|date=July 19, 1976|page=79|url=http://i1188.photobucket.com/albums/z405/smayo1953/scan6.jpg|accessdate=July 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During summer 1974, the Capitol Records-era greatest hits compilation ''[[Endless Summer (The Beach Boys album)|Endless Summer]]'' reached number 1 on the ''Billboard'' charts, reaffirming the relevance of the Beach Boys in the popular imagination. However, recording sessions for a new album under the supervision of Wilson and [[James William Guercio]] at [[Caribou Ranch]] and the band's studio in Santa Monica that autumn yielded only a smattering of basic tracks, including a banjo-driven arrangement of "[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]"; "[[It's O.K. (The Beach Boys song)|It's O.K.]]", an uptempo collaboration with Mike Love; the ballad "[[Good Timin' (The Beach Boys song)|Good Timin']]"; and Dennis Wilson's "[[River Song (Dennis Wilson song)|River Song]]".{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=194–195}} Eventually, Wilson diverted his attentions to "[[Child of Winter (Christmas Song)|Child of Winter]]", a Christmas single co-written with [[Stephen Kalinich]]; released belatedly for the holiday market on December 23, it failed to chart.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=195}}

Although still under contract with Warner Brothers Records, Wilson signed a sideline production deal with Bruce Johnston and [[Terry Melcher]]'s Equinox Records in early 1975. Together, they founded the loose-knit supergroup known as [[California Music]], which involved them along with L.A. musicians [[Gary Usher]], [[Curt Boettcher]], and a few others.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=198}} This contract was nullified by the Beach Boys' management, who perceived it as an attempt by Wilson to relieve the burden of his growing drug expenses, and it was demanded that Wilson focus his efforts on the Beach Boys, even though he strongly desired to escape from the group.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=198}} The idea of California Music immediately disintegrated.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=198}}

====First treatment====
Marilyn and the Wilson family were dismayed by Wilson's continued deterioration and were reluctant to payroll him as an active partner in the touring Beach Boys, an arrangement that had persisted for a decade. They enlisted the services of radical therapist [[Eugene Landy]] in October 1975.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=198–199}} Landy diagnosed him as paranoid schizophrenic (a diagnosis later retracted), and the treatment prompted Wilson to become more stable and socially engaged, and his productivity increased again.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=200}} The tagline "Brian's Back!" became a major promotional tool for the new Beach Boys album ''[[15 Big Ones]]'', released to coincide with their fifteenth anniversary as a band as a mixture of traditional pop covers with newly written original material. The record was released in the summer of 1976 to commercial acclaim and, despite lukewarm reviews, peaked at number 8 on the ''Billboard'' album chart. Wilson returned to regular stage appearances with the band, alternating between piano and bass, and made a solo appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in November 1976; to the chagrin of the other Beach Boys, producer [[Lorne Michaels]] stipulated an exclusive performance from Wilson.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=215}}

[[File:Brian Wilson 1976 crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Wilson at a ''[[15 Big Ones]]'' session, circa 1976]]

Wilson's behavior during this time was reported by many to be strange and off-putting, and Landy's role was described as "unethical" and ostentatious.&lt;ref name="songwriter1969"/&gt; Oftentimes, Wilson would ask for drugs in mid-interview.&lt;ref name="Felton1976"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Felton|first=David|title=The Healing of Brother Brian|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=November 4, 1976|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-healing-of-brother-brian-the-rolling-stone-interview-with-the-beach-boys-19761104|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Oui&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Rensin|first1=David|title=A Conversation With Brian Wilson|magazine=Oui|date=December 1976|url=http://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/a-conversation-with-brian-wilson|accessdate=July 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AstonishingGenius2011"/&gt; During this period, Wilson was under constant surveillance by bodyguards, which he resented.&lt;ref name=Oui/&gt; ''Rolling Stone'' editor David Felton chronicled bizarre exchanges between Wilson and Landy in "The Healing of Brother Brian", a profile of the resurgent band published by the magazine in November 1976; these included a report of Landy's medical staff promising Wilson a cheeseburger in exchange for writing a new song.&lt;ref name="Felton1976"/&gt;

Wilson expressed a fervent desire to leave the group and record a solo album in this period but could not, due to conflicts that it would create between him and the group, leading him to remark, "Sometimes I feel like a commodity in a stock market." He was also firm in that he wanted to record another work on par with the achievement of ''Pet Sounds''.&lt;ref name=Oui/&gt; In April 1977, the all-original album by Wilson, ''[[Love You (The Beach Boys album)|Love You]]'', was released bearing the Beach Boys moniker, although the group's contributions were minimal. It was described by Wilson as an attempt to relieve himself from mental instability brought on by a period of inactivity.&lt;ref name=RS1977&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Snyder|first=Patrick|title=Brian Wilson surfs out of nowheresville|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=March 10, 1977|url=http://troun.tripod.com/rsbriannowhere.html|accessdate=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Love You'' has since been cited as an early work of [[synthpop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/artist/the-beach-boys/id562555|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|title=The Beach Boys Biography|accessdate=July 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album features playful lyrics (alternately invoking [[Johnny Carson]], [[Phil Spector]], and adolescent interests) and stark instrumentation (featuring [[Moog bass]] lines and [[gated reverb]]-drenched drum patterns reflective of contemporaneous work by [[David Bowie]] and [[Tony Visconti]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Although ''Love You'' only reached number 53 on the ''Billboard'' chart, it was lauded as an artistic watershed by many critics, including [[punk rock]] lodestar [[Patti Smith]] (writing for ''[[Hit Parader]]'') and [[Robert Christgau]] of ''[[The Village Voice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=The+Beach+Boys|title=CG: The Beach Boys|publisher=Robert Christgau|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dangerousminds.net/comments/patti_smiths_review_of_the_beach_boys_love_you|title=Patti Smith’s review of ‘The Beach Boys Love You’|date=September 2, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson was under Landy's care for fourteen months until December 1976, when the therapist was dismissed for a dispute on his monthly fee.&lt;ref name="TelegraphObit"/&gt; Throughout the next several years, Wilson vacillated between periods of relative stability (frequently joining the touring band on piano, bass and vocals and writing or co-writing eight of the twelve tracks on 1978's poorly received ''[[M.I.U. Album]]'') and resurgences of his addictions. During this period, Wilson and his wife, Marilyn, amicably divorced in 1979 due to the strain of his erratic behavior on their family.&lt;ref name="Carlin"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Carlin |first1=Peter Ames |year=1998 |title=Love and Mercy |magazine=People |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=69–73 |publisher= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He repeatedly checked in and out of hospitals and continued to be plagued by incessant mood swings. At one point, he wandered off alone for several days and was sighted at a gay bar playing piano for drinks.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=228}}{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=318}} For a short period in 1978, he lived as a vagrant in [[Balboa Park (San Diego)|Balboa Park]], [[San Diego]] until police officers took him to [[Alvarado Hospital]] for [[alcohol poisoning]].{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=318}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sanford|first1=Jay Allen|title=The Day Beach Boy Brian Wilson Got Busted in Balboa Park |url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/weblogs/bands/2007/sep/18/the-day-beach-boy-brian-wilson-got-busted/|publisher=''[[San Diego Reader]]''|date=September 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sanford|first1=Jay Allen|title=Will Brian Wilson Film Depict 1978 Balboa Park Vagrancy Bust?|url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/weblogs/big-screen/2011/jun/26/will-brian-wilson-film-depict-1978-balboa-park-vag/#|publisher=''[[San Diego Reader]]''|date=June 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson's role in the band, as well as the Beach Boys' commercial prospects, began to diminish once more. By 1982, he was immersed in debt, owing the government tens of thousands of dollars in back taxes.&lt;ref name="Goldberg1984"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Goldberg|first1=Michael|title=Dennis Wilson: The Beach Boy Who Went Overboard|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=June 7, 1984|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-beach-boy-who-went-overboard-19840607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second treatment====
After Wilson overdosed on a combination of alcohol, cocaine, and other psychoactive drugs, he once again employed Landy.  With this effort by Landy, a more radical program was undertaken to try to restore to Wilson's health.&lt;ref name="TelegraphObit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/03/31/db3102.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2006/03/31/ixportal.html|title=Eugene Landy obituary|accessdate=April 16, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225202250/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2006%2F03%2F31%2Fdb3102.xml&amp;sSheet=%2Fportal%2F2006%2F03%2F31%2Fixportal.html|archivedate=February 25, 2008|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; This involved removing him from the Beach Boys on November 5, 1982 at the behest of Carl Wilson, Mike Love, and Al Jardine,&lt;ref name="Goldberg1984"/&gt; in addition to isolating him from his family and friends in Hawaii as well as putting him on a rigorous diet and health regimen.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=243–244}} According to Carolyn Williams, Wilson refused to see Landy: "They told him that the only way that he could be a Beach Boy again, and the only way they would release his 1982 tour disbursement money, was if he would agree to see Dr. Landy. Brian started yelling that he didn't like Dr. Landy and that [Landy] was charging him $20,000 a month the last time. He was willing to see anybody to get the weight off, but he didn't want to see Landy. And they said, 'Well, no, you have to see Dr. Landy. That's the only way.'"&lt;ref name="Goldberg1984"/&gt; Landy described the program that he accorded Wilson in ''The Handbook of Innovative Psychotherapies'':

{{quote|The success of twenty-four-hour therapy rests on the extent to which the therapeutic team can exert control over every aspect of the patient's life. ...&amp;nbsp;[The goal is to] totally disrupt the privacy of [the] patient's [life], gaining complete control over every aspect of their physical, personal, social, and sexual environments.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=243}}}}

Coupled with long, extreme counseling sessions, this therapy was successful in bringing Wilson back to physical health, slimming down from {{convert|311|lb|kg}} to {{convert|185|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brian Wilson on the Beach Boys, Gershwin and his upcoming biopic|url=http://www.ifc.com/fix/2011/11/brian-wilson-on-biopic-the-beach-boys-gershwin|work=IFC|accessdate=August 28, 2013|date=November 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Wilson's recovery consolidated, he rejoined the Beach Boys for [[Live Aid]] in 1985 and participated in the recording of the [[Steve Levine]]-produced album ''[[The Beach Boys (album)|The Beach Boys]]''. Wilson stopped working with the Beach Boys on a regular basis after the release of the album, largely due to the control that Landy exercised. Eventually, Landy's therapy technique created a [[Svengali]]-like environment for Wilson, controlling every movement in his life, including his musical direction.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=254–258}} In the mid 1980s, Landy stated, "I influence all of [Brian]'s thinking. I'm practically a member of the band&amp;nbsp;... [We're] partners in life."{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=244, 256}} Wilson later responded to allegations with, "People say that Dr. Landy runs my life, but the truth is, I'm in charge."{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=257}}

Between 1983 and 1986, Landy charged about $430,000 annually. When he requested more money, Carl Wilson was obliged to give away a quarter of Wilson's publishing royalties.&lt;ref name="TelegraphObit"/&gt; In 1988, Wilson said that "Dr. Landy doesn't like me to be in touch with my family too much. He thinks it's unhealthy." Landy responded to the charges that he exerted too much control on the songwriter: "He's got a car phone in his car. If he wants to call somebody, he calls somebody... He can go anywhere, on his own, anytime he wants." Regarding Wilson's relationship to the Beach Boys at that time, Wilson added: "Although we stay together as a group, as people we're a far cry from friends. One time we were doing an interview together, and the interviewer asked Carl what it was between him and me. He goes, 'Well, Brian and I don't have to talk to each other. We're just Beach Boys, but we don't need to be friends.' And that's true. Although, whenever I think about him, I feel rotten."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=White|first1=Timothy|authorlink1=Timothy White (writer)|title=BACK FROM THE BOTTOM|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/26/magazine/back-from-the-bottom.html?pagewanted=all|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 26, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson named the song a "personal message from me to people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes|title=Brian Wilson|others=Brian Wilson|year=2000|first=David|last=Leaf|authorlink=David Leaf|publisher=[[Rhino Records]]|type=CD Liner|url=http://albumlinernotes.com/Brian_Wilson__Reissue_.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wilson signed to a solo record deal with [[Sire Records]] label boss [[Seymour Stein]] and variously worked with [[Andy Paley]], [[Russ Titelman]] and Landy's girlfriend as co-authors on the new material. Old friend and collaborator [[Gary Usher]] was a key participant in the early demo work for the album, though Landy later removed him from the project. After several years of genesis, Wilson released his debut solo album ''[[Brian Wilson (album)|Brian Wilson]]''. His work may have been hampered by Landy's influence, since Landy insisted on controlling involvement in every aspect of Wilson's writing and recording and his lyrical influence is significant.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Despite the critical success of his debut solo album, rumors abounded that Wilson had either suffered a [[stroke]] or had been permanently disabled due to excessive drug use.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=271}} The actual problem was that Wilson, who had been prescribed massive amounts of [[psychotropic drugs]] by Landy's staff since 1983, had developed [[tardive dyskinesia]],{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=271, 280}} a neurological condition marked by involuntary, repetitive movements, that develops in about 20 percent of patients treated with [[anti-psychotic]] drugs for an extended period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Sweet, R.A., Mulsant, B.

Archives of General Psychiatry, 52, 478–486.&lt;/ref&gt; During recording of the ''Brian Wilson'' album, engineering staff had observed what seemed to be "every pharmaceutical on the face of the earth," referring to the medicine bag Landy was using to store Wilson's prescription drugs.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=272}} Landy separated from Wilson in 1989, however, they remained business partners.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=269, 272}} Wilson's proposed second solo album under the direction of Landy, titled ''[[Sweet Insanity (album)|Sweet Insanity]]'', was rejected by Sire in 1990.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

An ostensible memoir, ''[[Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story]]'', was published in 1991. In the book, whose authorship is still debated, Wilson spoke about his troubled relationship with his abusive father Murry, his private disputes with the Beach Boys and his lost years of mental illness.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=270, 272–273}} Landy's illegal use of psychotropic drugs on Wilson, and his influence over Wilson's financial affairs, were legally ended by his brother Carl and other members of the Wilson family after a two-year-long conservatorship battle in Los Angeles. Landy's misconduct resulted in the loss of his license to practice in California,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20120051,00.html |title=Brian Wilson's Svengali Has His Wings Clipped |magazine=People |volume=31 |issue=15 |date=April 17, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a court-ordered removal and restraining order from Wilson.&lt;ref name="TelegraphObit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/107279|title=The Strange Life of Brian|publisher=Newsweek.com|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s–2010s: Touring and solo resurgence===

====Collaborations and unfinished projects====
{{Further|Andy Paley sessions}}

Wilson released two albums simultaneously in 1995. The first was the [[I Just Wasn't Made for These Times|soundtrack]] to [[Don Was]]'s documentary ''[[Brian Wilson: I Just Wasn't Made for These Times|I Just Wasn't Made for These Times]]'', which consisted of new versions of several Beach Boys and solo songs. The second, ''[[Orange Crate Art]]'', saw Wilson as lead vocalist on an album produced, arranged and written by [[Van Dyke Parks]]. ''I Just Wasn't Made for These Times'' includes Wilson performing for the first time with his now-adult daughters, [[Wendy Wilson|Wendy]] and [[Carnie Wilson|Carnie]] of the group [[Wilson Phillips]] and Van Dyke Parks. During the early 1990s, he also worked on some tracks with [[power pop]] band [[Jellyfish (band)|Jellyfish]], which remain unreleased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mitchell|first=Justin|title=Rocky Mountain News|url=http://zenandjuice.com/music/jellyfish/text/rocky-070993.txt|accessdate=June 30, 2013|newspaper=Rocky Mountain News|date=July 9, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Joseph Manning, Jr.|Roger Manning]] has recounted an anecdote during these sessions involving Wilson falling asleep at the piano yet continuing to play.&lt;ref name="Atlantic City 2013" /&gt; Later in the decade, Wilson and his daughters Carnie and Wendy would release an album together, titled ''[[The Wilsons]]'' (1997). Also, around this time, Wilson sang backup vocals on [[Belinda Carlisle]]'s "[[California (Belinda Carlisle song)|California]]".

Having missed out on the Beach Boys' 27th studio album ''[[Summer in Paradise]]'', Wilson returned to the Beach Boys for [[Andy Paley sessions|sporadic recording sessions and live performances during the early to mid-1990s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Back to the Beach|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,296612,00.html|accessdate=June 30, 2013|newspaper=Entertainment|date=March 31, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working with collaborators Andy Paley and Don Was, the sessions were reported to have been tenuous. It had also been discussed that Wilson and the Beach Boys would work with [[Sean O'Hagan]] of [[the High Llamas]] on a comeback album for Wilson and the Beach Boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stratton|first=Jeff|title=Bandwidth|url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/2000-10-26/music/bandwidth/|accessdate=June 30, 2013|newspaper=Porward Palm Beach New Times|date=October 26, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; All projects collapsed, and instead, Wilson was involved with the 1996 Beach Boys album ''[[Stars and Stripes Vol. 1]]'': a group collaboration, backing country music artists singing lead vocals of Beach Boys' standards.

In 1998, he teamed with Chicago-based producer [[Joe Thomas (producer)|Joe Thomas]] for the album ''[[Imagination (Brian Wilson album)|Imagination]].'' Following this, he received extensive vocal coaching to improve his voice, learned to cope with his [[glossophobia|stage fright]], and started to consistently perform live for the first time in decades. This resulted in Wilson successfully performing the entire ''Pet Sounds'' album live throughout the US, UK and Europe. In 1999, Wilson filed a suit against Thomas, seeking damages and a declaration which freed him to work on his next album without involvement from Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bad Vibrations: Brian Wilson Sues Collaborator |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bad-vibrations-brian-wilson-sues-collaborator-19990824|work=Rolling Stone|date=August 24, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suit was made after Thomas allegedly began to raise his industry profile and wrongfully enrich himself through his association with Wilson. Thomas reciprocated with a suit citing that Melinda Wilson "schemed against and manipulated" him and Wilson. The case was settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brian Wilson Settles Suit With Former Partner|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/brian-wilson-settles-suit-with-former-partner-20000718|work=Rolling Stone|date=July 18, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson's third solo album ''[[Gettin' In Over My Head]]'' (2004) featured collaborations with [[Elton John]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[Eric Clapton]] and brother Carl, who died of [[lung cancer]] in February 1998.

====''Brian Wilson Presents Smile''====
{{Main|Brian Wilson Presents Smile}}
With his mental health on the mend, Wilson decided to revisit the aborted ''Smile'' project from 1967. Aided by musician and longtime fan [[Darian Sahanaja]] of Wondermints, and lyricist Van Dyke Parks, Wilson reimagined the session material into something that would work in a live context. His work was finally revealed in concert on February 20, 2004, 37 years after it was conceived, though he later stated that the finished product was substantially different from what was originally envisioned. Wilson debuted his 2004 interpretation of ''Smile'' at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London and subsequently toured the UK. Following the tour, ''Brian Wilson Presents Smile'' was recorded, and released in September 2004. The release hit number 13 on the [[Billboard chart|''Billboard'' chart]]. At the [[47th Grammy Awards]] in 2005, Wilson won his first Grammy for the track "[[The Elements: Fire|Mrs. O'Leary's Cow]]" as Best Rock Instrumental. In 2004, Wilson promoted ''Brian Wilson Presents Smile'' with a tour of Australia, New Zealand and Europe.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In February 2005, Wilson had a cameo in the television series ''[[Duck Dodgers (TV series)|Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century]]'' as [[Daffy Duck]]'s spiritual surfing adviser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=blackwolf_13 Added|url=http://www.tv.com/duck-dodgers/surf-the-stars---samurai-quack/episode/355094/summary.html|title=Duck Dodgers: Surf the Stars / Samurai Quack|publisher=TV.com|date=August 10, 2006|accessdate=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 26, 2005, Wilson performed at [[Glastonbury Festival]] in [[England]] to critical success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brian Wilson triumphs in Glasto Sunshine|url=http://www.nme.com/news/festivals/20299|work=[[New Musical Express|NME]]|first=Adam|last=Bychawski|date=June 26, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 2, 2005, Wilson performed for the [[Live 8 concert, Berlin|Live 8 concert]] in [[Berlin]], Germany. In September 2005, Wilson arranged a charity drive to aid victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]], wherein people who donated $100 or more would receive a personal phone call from Wilson. According to the website, over $250K was raised.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-09-24-brian-wilson-website_x.htm|title=Donate to hurricane relief and Brian Wilson will say hi|publisher=Usatoday.com|date=September 24, 2005|accessdate=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2005, former bandmate [[Mike Love]] sued Wilson over "shamelessly misappropriating&amp;nbsp;...

In December 2005, Wilson released ''[[What I Really Want for Christmas]]'' for [[Arista Records]]. The release hit number 200 on the ''Billboard'' chart, though sales were modest. Wilson's remake of "Deck the Halls" became a surprise Top 10 Adult Contemporary hit. He appeared in the 2005 holiday episode of ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]'', performing "Deck the Halls" for children with [[xeroderma pigmentosum]] (hypersensitivity to sunlight) at [[Walt Disney World Resort]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

To celebrate the 40th anniversary of ''[[Pet Sounds]]'', Wilson embarked on a brief tour in November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.usatoday.com/listenup/2006/09/two_beach_boys_.html|work=USA Today|title=Two Beach Boys to reunite – Listen Up|date=September 24, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220033634/http://blogs.usatoday.com/listenup/2006/09/two_beach_boys_.html|archivedate=December 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beach Boy [[Al Jardine]] accompanied Wilson for the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/23/arts/music/23wils.html?_r=0|title=Wouldn’t It Be Nice Not to Fuss Over Significance or Perfection?|publisher=The New York Times|date=November 23, 2006|accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''That Lucky Old Sun'' and band reunion====

{{Wikinews|Kennedy Center names 2007 honors recipients}}

Wilson released ''[[That Lucky Old Sun (album)|That Lucky Old Sun]]'' in September 2008. The piece originally debuted in a series of September 2007 concerts at London's [[Royal Festival Hall]], and in January 2008 at Sydney's [[State Theatre (Sydney)|State Theatre]] while headlining the [[Sydney Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/arts/brian-wilson-to-headline-sydney-festival/2007/09/12/1189276795807.html|title=Brian Wilson to headline Sydney Festival|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=September 12, 2007|accessdate=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson described the piece as "...&amp;nbsp;consisting of five 'rounds', with interspersed spoken word."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/news/brian_wilson/news/9313|title=Brian Wilson to Premiere New Creation in London|website=Uncut|accessdate=September 14, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211075126/http://www.uncut.co.uk/news/brian_wilson/news/9313|archivedate=February 11, 2007|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of US and UK concerts preceded its release. On September 30, 2008, Seattle's [[Light in the Attic Records]] released ''[[A World of Peace Must Come]]'', a collaboration between Wilson and [[Stephen Kalinich]], originally recorded in 1969, but later lost in Kalinich's closet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Seattle Weekly|title=Stephen John Kalinich's LP With Brian Wilson Gets Rescued|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/2008-10-08/music/finding-peace/|author=Brian J.

Around this time, Wilson announced that he was developing another concept album, titled ''Pleasure Island: A Rock Fantasy''. Accordingly: "It’s about some guys who took a hike, and they found a place called Pleasure Island. And they met all kinds of chicks, and they went on rides and — it’s just a concept. I haven’t developed it yet. I think people are going to love it — it could be the best thing I’ve ever done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Dylan|title=The Biographical Dictionary of Popular Music: From Adele to Ziggy, the Real A to Z of Rock and Pop|date=2012|isbn=978-1-25003-188-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album has yet to surface, and for several years, Wilson has consistently maintained in interviews that he wishes his "next album" to be more rock-oriented.

In summer 2009, Wilson signed a two-record deal with Disney after he was approached to record an album of his interpretations of Gershwin songs, and to assess unfinished piano pieces by Gershwin for possible expansion into finished songs. After extensive evaluation of a vast body of Gershwin fragments, Wilson chose two to complete.

Wilson's understanding of [[music theory]] was self-taught.{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=112}} The first instrument he learned to play was a toy [[accordion]]{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=11}} before quickly moving to piano and then bass guitar.{{sfn|Zager|2011|pp=215–216}} From an early age, Wilson demonstrated an extraordinary skill for [[learning music by ear]] on keyboard.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|pp=2, 8}} According to bassist [[Carol Kaye]], "He took bass up another step. He saw it as integral in a symphonic orchestra. He used bass as the framework for a hit record. Very few people can write for bass, but his writing was beautiful. There are a lot of jazz musicians who admire him for it."{{sfn|Dillon|2012}}

The work of record producer [[Phil Spector]], who popularized the [[Wall of Sound]], was a focal obsession for Wilson.&lt;ref name="A Boy's own story"&gt;{{cite news |first=Sean|last=O'Hagan|title=Feature: ''A Boy's Own Story''|work=Review, [[The Observer]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|issue=January 6, 2002|pages=1–3|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/jan/06/features.review87}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, Wilson thought of Spector as "the single most influential producer.

Wilson is officially diagnosed as a [[schizoaffective disorder|schizoaffective]] with mild [[Bipolar disorder|manic depression]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=280}} He regularly experiences [[auditory hallucination]]s that present themselves in the form of disembodied voices.&lt;ref name="freedom2007"&gt;{{cite news|last=Freedom du Lac|first=J.|title=It Wasn't All Fun, Fun, Fun|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2007/11/30/ST2007113001361.html|date=December 2, 2007|accessdate=June 30, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brian Wilson – A Powerful Interview|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/past/brianW/brianw.html |work=Ability Magazine |author1=Chet Cooper |author2=Gillian Friedman}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, he began having hallucinations in 1965, shortly after starting to use [[psychedelic drug]]s.&lt;ref name="AstonishingGenius2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Petridis|first=Alexis|title=The astonishing genius of Brian Wilson|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/24/brian-wilson-interview|accessdate=June 30, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlantic City 2013"&gt;{{cite web|last=Condran|first=Ed|title=They Get Around|url=http://www.atlanticcityweekly.com/arts_and_entertainment/they-get-around/article_f6bc2439-059e-5cbc-9707-889f68f55fac.html|work=Atlantic City Weekly|accessdate=April 12, 2018|date=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brian Wilson: "LSD fucked with my brain"|url=http://www.nme.com/news/brian-wilson/57557|accessdate=June 30, 2013|newspaper=NME|date=June 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, he had been diagnosed as [[paranoid schizophrenic]], with doctors finding evidence of [[brain damage]] caused by excessive and sustained drug abuse.&lt;ref name="A Boy's own story" /&gt; The paranoid schizophrenic diagnosis, originally made by Landy, was later retracted.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=200}} Wilson's mental condition improved in later years, although his struggles with auditory hallucinations were not eliminated. He credited his relationship with his wife with allowing him to resume his career as a musician. In his own words, he said that he should have spent the early 2000s "in a mental institution under heavy sedation" due to the stresses of his condition, however, "Things have started to get a little bit easier, but I'm not always in a positive, happy place."&lt;ref name="freedom2007"/&gt;

Whether Wilson truly consents to his semi-regular touring schedule since the 2000s is a subject of debate among fans.{{sfn|Stebbins|2011}}  In a 1999 ''[[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]]'' biography, Ledbetter stated: "We more or less decided that if he's going to stay in the music business, there's a certain way you stay in the music business, and it's not by making an album every ten years, and just throwing it out." Ginger Blake, a family friend formerly of the Honeys, characterized Wilson as "seemingly is in a fairly good place, but that's not the real Brian Wilson, that's the Brian Wilson who's become complacent and basically surrendered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|people=Neville, Morgan (Director)|date=1999|title=Brian Wilson: A Beach Boy's Tale|time=1:28:34|medium=Video}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about negative comments written in Wilson's 2016 autobiography, Mike Love responded: "He’s not in charge of his life, like I am mine. His every move is orchestrated and a lot of things he's purported to say, there’s not tape of it. But, I don’t like to put undue pressure on him, either, because I know he has a lot of issues."&lt;ref name="fes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fessier|first1=Bruce|title=Beach Boys seek to overcome discord with new wave of Love|url=http://www.desertsun.com/story/life/entertainment/music/2016/11/16/beach-boys-seek-overcome-discord-new-wave-love/93977562/|work=[[The Desert Sun]]|date=November 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|In 2001, the High Llamas' Sean O'Hagan reported that Wilson was "not really responsible for his day-to-day life, he's totally dependent on other people. ...

In 2011, after speaking to some of Wilson's acquaintances, biographer [[Jon Stebbins]] speculated that "Working in the studio and especially touring is not really his choice. His handlers, managers, and wife insist that he work. It's all a bit Landy-like when you look behind the curtain." Although Wilson often says that he enjoys touring, Stebbins writes of a "recent interview [where he was asked] what he disliked the most about touring, Brian replied that it was going on stage and performing. ... Upon hearing Brian say that, his 'handler' quickly reminded Brian, through a fake smile, that he loved performing".{{sfn|Stebbins|2011}}

[that] set the pace for how pop music could and should sound in the [[flower power|Flower Power]] era: at once starry-eyed and wistful."&lt;ref name=AVSunshine/&gt; Sean O'Hagan of the High Llamas named Wilson an important pioneer of [[experimental pop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Pederson |first1=Erik |title=What the World Needs Now: The New Easy Listening |magazine=Option |date=1997 |issue=77 |pages=62–67 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once Wilson started incorporating quasi-symphonic textures into his work, many people began crediting him for propelling the mid-1960s [[art pop]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Holden |first=Stephen |authorlink=Stephen Holden |date=February 28, 1999 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/arts/music-they-re-recording-but-are-they-artists.html |title=MUSIC; They're Recording, but Are They Artists? |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlin wrote that Wilson was the forerunner of "a new kind of [[art-rock]] that would combine the transcendent possibilities of art with the mainstream accessibility of pop music".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Carlin |first1=Peter Ames |authorlink=Peter Ames Carlin |title=MUSIC; A Rock Utopian Still Chasing An American Dream |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/25/arts/music-a-rock-utopian-still-chasing-an-american-dream.html |date=March 25, 2001 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also regarded as the most famous [[outsider music]]ian.{{sfn|Chusid|2000|p=xv}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vivinetto |first1=Gina |title=The bipolar poet |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/07/19/Floridian/The_bipolar_poet.shtml |newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |date=July 19, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Irwin Chusid]] noted Wilson as an ironic example of the genre due to his past commercial success, but believes that Wilson's history of torment, substance abuse, and "loopy" material are what "certify" his outsider status.{{sfn|Chusid|2000|p=xv}}

As one of the first [[music auteur|music producer auteurs]], Wilson (along with [[George Martin]]) popularized the idea of the recording studio as a compositional tool{{sfn|Edmondson|2013|p=890}} by using recording sessions as fertile creative terrain in and of themselves, a practice which was unheard of in his time and later shorthanded as "playing the studio".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Seymour|first1=Corey|title=Love &amp; Mercy Does Justice to the Brilliance of Brian Wilson|magazine=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|date=June 5, 2015|url=http://www.vogue.com/13266664/love-and-mercy-brian-wilson/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 21 years old when he received the freedom to produce his own records with total creative autonomy, he ignited an explosion of like-minded California producers, supplanting New York as the center of popular records,{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=54}} and becoming the first rock producer to use the studio as a discrete instrument.{{sfn|Cogan|Clark|2003|p=33}} The Beach Boys were thus one of the first rock groups to exert studio control.{{sfn|Miller|1992|p=193}}

Music producers after the mid 1960s would draw on Wilson's influence, setting a precedent that allowed bands and artists to enter a recording studio and act as producers, either autonomously, or in conjunction with other like minds.{{sfn|Edmondson|2013|p=890}} ''[[The Atlantic]]''{{'}}s Jason Guriel credits ''Pet Sounds'' with inventing the modern pop album, that Wilson "paved the way for auteurs ... anticipat[ing] the rise of the producer ... [and] the modern pop-centric era, which privileges producer over artist and blurs the line between entertainment and art. ... Anytime a band or musician disappears into a studio to contrive an album-length mystery, the ghost of Wilson is hovering near. ... [he was] the first to turn an album into an occasion."&lt;ref name="Guriel2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guriel|first1=Jason|title=How Pet Sounds Invented the Modern Pop Album|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/05/how-pet-sounds-invented-the-modern-pop-album/482940/|publisher=''[[The Atlantic]]''|date=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s, Wilson also started a trend of "project" recording, where an artist records by himself instead of going into an established studio.{{sfn|Edmondson|2013|p=890}}

'''''Carbon Copy''''' is a 1981 British-American [[comedy film]] directed by [[Michael Schultz]]. The film stars [[George Segal]], [[Susan Saint James]], [[Jack Warden]], and features [[Denzel Washington]] in his feature-film debut. It was the first [[feature film]] produced by [[RKO Pictures]] after a break of many years, though they were only co-distributor with Avco/Embassy Pictures and Hemdale Film Corporation.

==Plot==
Roger Porter (Washington), a black man, is the long-lost son of Walter Whitney (Segal), a white businessman living in the exclusive, predominantly white community of [[San Marino, California]]. Walter, who is Jewish, lives a frustrating life in his gated community, sexually and otherwise. One day he finds out about his former girlfriend son's existence. Once Roger turns up at Walter's office, it turns out that he is the result of Walter's relationship with a black woman, who is now dead. For purposes of professional advancement in the business, he left Roger's mother. The only person who knew about Roger's mother was his anti-Semitic father-in-law (Warden) who is also his boss. Walter's father-in-law had warned him that the relationship would be harmful to his career, so Walter under pressure broke it off.

Walter attempts to help Roger by telling his wife Vivian (Saint James) that he wants to adopt him. She accepts, but soon regrets the decision after she finds out about Roger's real relationship with Walter and ends up kicking Walter out. Her father also fires him, taking his car and benefits in the process. Walter's friends alienate him. He comes to the realization that his job and his wife receive all of his benefits, leaving him penniless. Walter realizes he is going through "social menopause", a change of color. Per his new accountant, "They don't want you to participate as a White man, so they are going to make you watch like a Black man." Afterwards, Roger checks into a motel and tries to make ends meet. Meanwhile his father-in-law watches Walter's every move to make sure Walter receives no help from the world he knew so Walter can come back to his old world WITHOUT Roger. Later, Walter and Roger move into an apartment. Walter ends up as a menial manual laborer, shoveling horse manure.

The final ten minutes makes the transition from comedy to [[drama film|drama]], where Walter has to choose between either acceptance that Roger is his son, or alienation of Roger to salvage his own position in society.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9642">The aim of '''color calibration''' is to measure and/or adjust the color response of a device (input or output) to a known state. In [[International Color Consortium]] (ICC) terms, this is the basis for an additional color characterization of the device and later profiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | title = Calibration vs. Characterization | author = Graeme Gill | url = http://www.argyllcms.com/doc/calvschar.html | publisher = Graeme Gill}}&lt;/ref&gt; In non-ICC workflows, calibration refers sometimes to establishing a known relationship to a standard [[color space]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Introduction to color imaging science | author = Hsien-Che Lee | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-521-84388-X | url = https://books.google.com/?id=CzAbJrLin_AC&amp;pg=PA388&amp;dq=%22color+calibration%22+camera+monitor#PPA388,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in one go. The device that is to be calibrated is sometimes known as a ''calibration source''; the color space that serves as a standard is sometimes known as a ''calibration target''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Color calibration is a requirement for all devices taking an active part of a [[color management|color-managed]] workflow, and is used by many industries, such as television production, gaming, photography, engineering, chemistry, medicine and more.

== Information flow and output distortion ==
Input data can come from device sources like [[digital cameras]], [[image scanner]]s or any other measuring devices. Those inputs can be either monochrome (in which case only the [[Tone reproduction|response curve]] needs to be calibrated, though in a few select cases one must also specify the color or spectral power distribution  that that single channel corresponds to) or specified in [[Additive color|multidimensional]] color - most commonly in the three channel [[RGB color model|RGB]] model. Input data is in most cases calibrated against a [[Color management#Color translation|profile connection space (PCS)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | title = Color Imaging Workflow Primitives | author = Ann L. McCarthy | url = http://www.color.org/primitives.pdf | publisher = International Color Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important factors to consider when dealing with color calibration is having a valid source. If the color measuring source does not match the displays capabilities, the calibration will be ineffective and give false readings.

The main distorting factors on the input stage stem from the amplitude nonlinearity of the channel response(s), and in the case of a multidimensional datastream the non-ideal wavelength responses of the individual color separation filters (most commonly a [[Color filter array|color filter array (CFA)]]) in combination with the [[Light temperature#Spectral power distribution|spectral power distribution]] of the scene illumination.

After this the data is often circulated in the system translated into a [[Color management#Working spaces|working space RGB]] for viewing and editing.

In the output stage when exporting to a viewing device such as a [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] or [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] screen or a digital projector, the computer sends a signal to the computer's graphic card in the form RGB [Red,Green,Blue]. The dataset [255,0,0] signals only a device instruction, not a specific color. This instruction [R,G,B]=[255,0,0] then causes the connected display to show Red at the maximum achievable brightness [255], while the Green and Blue components of the display remain dark [0]. The resultant color being displayed, however, depends on two main factors:

*the [[phosphor]]s or another system actually producing a light that falls inside the red spectrum;
*the overall brightness of the color resulting in the desired [[Color vision|color perception]]: an extremely bright light source will always be seen as white, irrespective of spectral composition.

Hence every output device will have its unique color signature, displaying a certain color according to manufacturing tolerances and material deterioration through use and age.
If the output device is a printer, additional distorting factors are the qualities of a particular batch of paper and ink.

The conductive qualities and standards-compliance of connecting cables, circuitry and equipment can also alter the electrical signal at any stage in the signal flow. (A partially inserted [[VGA connector]] can result in a monochrome display, for example, as some pins are not connected.)

== Color perception ==
Color perception is subject to ambient light levels, and the ambient [[white point]]; for example, a red object looks black in blue light. It is therefore not possible to achieve calibration that will make a device look correct and consistent in all capture or viewing conditions. The [[computer display]] and calibration target will have to be considered in controlled, predefined lighting conditions.

==Calibration techniques and procedures==
[[File:PIA16132-MarsCuriosityRover-CalibrationTarget-20120909.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''[[Color chart|Calibration Target]]'' of the "[[Curiosity rover#Mars Hand Lens Imager .28MAHLI.29|Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI)]]" on the [[Mars]] [[Curiosity rover]] (September 9, 2012) ([http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/images/MAHLIcaltarget-br2.jpg 3-D image]).]]
The most common form of calibration aims at adjusting cameras, scanners, monitors and printers for photographic reproduction. The aim is that a printed copy of a photograph appear identical in saturation and dynamic range to the original or a source file on a computer display. This means that three independent calibrations need to be performed:

* The camera or scanner needs a device-specific calibration to represent the original's estimated colors in an unambiguous way.
* The computer display needs a device-specific calibration to reproduce the colors of the image color space.
* The printer needs a device-specific calibration to reproduce the colors of the image color space.

These goals can either be realized via direct value translation from source to target, or by using a common known reference color space as middle ground. In the most commonly used color profile system, [[ICC profile|ICC]], this is known as the PCS or "Profile Connection Space".

=== Camera ===
The camera calibration needs a known calibration target to be photographed and the resulting output from the camera to be converted to color values. A correction profile can then be built using the difference between the camera result values and the known reference values.
When two or more cameras need to be calibrated relatively to each other, to reproduce the same color values, the technique of [[color mapping]] can be used.

=== Scanner ===
[[File:IT8target.jpg|right|thumb|350px|An [[IT8]].7 Target by [[LaserSoft Imaging]]]]
For creating a scanner profile it needs a target source, such as an [[IT8]]-target, an original with many small color fields, which was measured by the developer with a [[photometer]]. The scanner reads this original and compares the scanned color values with the target's reference values. Taking the differences of these values into account an [[ICC profile]] is created, which relates the device specific color space ([[RGB color space]]) to a device independent color space ([[Lab color space|L*a*b* color space]]). Thus, the scanner is able to output with color fidelity to what it reads.

=== Display ===
[[File:ColorHug2 - 03.jpg|thumb|Color calibration of a monitor using ColorHug2, an open source colorimeter, placed on the screen.]]
For calibrating the monitor a [[Tristimulus colorimeter|colorimeter]] is attached flat to the display's surface, shielded from all ambient light. The calibration software sends a series of color signals to the display and compares the values that were actually sent against the readings from the calibration device. This establishes the current offsets in color display. Depending on the calibration software and type of monitor used, the software either creates a correction matrix (i.e. an [[ICC profile]]) for color values before being sent to the display, or gives instructions for altering the display's brightness/contrast and RGB values through the [[on-screen display|OSD]].
This tunes the display to reproduce fairly accurately the in-[[gamut]] part of a desired color space. The calibration target for this kind of calibration is that of print stock paper illuminated by [[CIE Standard Illuminant D65|D65]] light at 120&amp;nbsp;cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Printer ===
The ICC profile for a printer is created by comparing a test print result using a photometer with the original reference file. The testchart contains known [[CMYK]] colors, whose offsets to their actual L*a*b* colors scanned by the photometer are resulting in an ICC profile. Another possibility to ICC profile a printer is to use a calibrated scanner as the measuring device for the printed CMYK testchart instead of a photometer. A calibration profile is necessary for each printer/paper/ink combination.

The '''''Corpse of Christ''''' is a painting by the Italian Baroque master [[Annibale Carracci]], dating to c. 1583-1585  and housed in the [[Staatsgalerie Stuttgart|Staatsgalerie]] of [[Stuttgart]], Germany.

The work, dating to Carracci's early career, is a manifest homage to [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s [[Dead Christ (Mantegna)|''Dead Christ'']], which he had perhaps seen in the [[Aldobrandini]] collection. Christ is portrayed lying in a contorted position, seen from his feet. Differently from Mantegna, Carracci did not paint the mourners at the side, and adopted a more realistic depiction of the body.

'''''Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)''''' is a 1954 [[oil-on-canvas]] painting by [[Salvador Dalí]]. A nontraditional, [[surrealism|surrealist]] portrayal of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]], it depicts [[Christ]] on the [[polyhedron net]] of a [[tesseract]] (hypercube). It is one of his best known paintings from the later period of his career.

==Background==
Dalí's inspiration for ''Corpus Hypercubus'' came from his change in artistic style during the 1940s and 1950s. Around that time, his interest in traditional surrealism diminished and he became fascinated with [[nuclear science]], feeling that "thenceforth, the atom was [his] favorite food for thought". His interest grew from the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombing of Hiroshima]] at the end of World War II, which left a lasting impression on him. In his 1951 essay "Mystical Manifesto", he introduced an art theory he called "nuclear mysticism" that combined Dalí's interests in [[Catholicism]], mathematics, science, and [[Catalonia|Catalan]] culture in an effort to reestablish classical values and techniques, which he extensively utilized in ''Corpus Hypercubus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baylor.edu/content/services/document.php/130948.pdf |format=PDF |title=Prayer in a Fourth Dimension |website=Baylor.edu |accessdate=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, to promote nuclear mysticism and explain the "return to spiritual classicism movement" in modern art,&lt;ref&gt;Montse Aguer- The Treasures of Dalí {{citation broken|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he traveled throughout the United States giving lectures. Before painting ''Corpus Hypercubus'', Dalí announced his intention to portray an exploding Christ using both classical painting techniques along with the motif of the cube, and he declared that "this painting will be the great [[metaphysical]] work of [his] summer". [[Juan de Herrera]]'s ''Treatise on Cubic Forms'' was particularly influential to Dalí.&lt;ref name="Coppens"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philipcoppens.com/dali.html |title=Salvador Dali: painting the fourth dimension |website=Philipcoppens.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition and meaning ==
''Corpus Hypercubus'' is composed of oil on canvas, and its dimensions are 194.3 cm × 123.8 cm (76.5 in x 48.75 in).&lt;ref name="Met"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/210009107 |title=Salvador Dalí &amp;#124; Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus) &amp;#124; The Met |website=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with his theory of nuclear mysticism, Dalí uses classical elements along with ideas inspired by mathematics, science, etc. Some noticeably classic features are the drapery of the clothing and the [[Caravaggisti|Caravaggesque]] lighting that theatrically envelops Christ, though like his 1951 painting ''Christ of Saint John of the Cross'', ''Corpus Hypercubus'' takes the traditional Biblical scene of Christ's Crucifixion and almost completely reinvents it. The union of Christ and the tesseract reflects Dalí's opinion that the seemingly separate and incompatible concepts of science and religion can in fact coexist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.humboldt.edu/art/Artists/Dali_Salvador/Dali_Home.htm |title=Dali, Salvador &amp;#124; Library &amp;#124; Humboldt State University |website=Library.humboldt.edu |date=1953-03-27 |accessdate=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completing ''Corpus Hypercubus'', Dalí described his work as "metaphysical, transcendent [[cubism]]".&lt;ref name="Coppens" /&gt;

While he did attempt to distance himself from the Surrealist movement after his development of nuclear mysticism, Dalí still incorporates dream-like features consistent with his earlier surrealist work in ''Corpus Hypercubus'', such as the levitating Christ and the giant chessboard below. Jesus' face is turned away from the viewer, making it completely obscured. The crown of thorns is missing from Christ's head as are the nails from his hands and feet, leaving his body completely devoid of the wounds often closely associated with the Crucifixion. With ''Christ of Saint John of the Cross'', Dalí did the same in order to leave only the "metaphysical beauty of Christ-God".  Dalí sets the painting in front of the bay of [[Port Lligat]] in [[Catalonia]], Dalí's home, which is also the setting of other paintings of his including ''The Madonna of Port Lligat'', ''The Sacrament of the Last Supper'', and ''Christ of Saint John of the Cross''.

A viewer's eyes may quickly be drawn to the knees of Christ, which have a grotesque exaggeration of hyperrealistic detail. On close observation of the original painting, 5 different images of Dalí's wife [[Gala Dalí|Gala]] appear in Christ's right knee, and 5 different images of Dalí himself appear in the left knee; the most prominent two being Gala's back/neck/back of head with right arm extended upward, and Dalí's own face complete with his trademark upswept mustache. The additional [[Hidden message|embedded images]] are more difficult to see in low-quality reproductions or prints.

=== Tesseract ===
[[File:8-cell net.png|thumb|A [[Net (polyhedron)|net]] of a hypercube ([[tesseract]])]]
The most striking change Dalí makes from nearly every other crucifixion painting concerns the [[cross]]. Instead of painting Christ on a wooden cross, Dalí depicts him upon the unfolded net of a [[tesseract]] (also known as a hypercube). The unfolding of a tesseract into eight cubes is analogous to unfolding the sides of a cube into six squares. The use of a hypercube for the cross has been interpreted as a geometric symbol for the transcendental nature of [[God]]. Just as the concept of God exists in a space that is incomprehensible to humans, the hypercube exists in four spatial dimensions, which is equally inaccessible to the mind. The net of the hypercube is a three-dimensional representation of it, similar to how Christ is a human form of God that is more relatable to people.

The word "corpus" in the title can refer both to the body of Christ and to geometric figures, reinforcing the link Dalí makes between religion and mathematics and science.&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Schiebler- Dalí: The Reality of Dreams {{citation broken|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christ's levitation above the Earth could symbolize His rise above Earthly desire and suffering. The motif of the cube is present elsewhere: Gala is standing on one, and the chessboard is made up of squares.

=== Gala ===
On the bottom left of the painting, Dalí painted his wife [[Gala Dalí|Gala]] as [[Mary Magdalene]] looking up at Jesus. Dalí thought of her as the "perfect union of the development of the hypercubic octahedron on the human level of the cube". He used her as a model because "the most noble beings were painted by [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]] and [[Francisco de Zurbarán|Zurbarán]]. [He] only [approaches] nobility when painting Gala, and nobility can only be inspired by the human being."&lt;ref name="Coppens" /&gt;

== Reception ==
Fiona Macdonald describes the painting as showing a classical pose of Christ superimposed on a mathematical representation of the [[Fourth dimension in art|fourth dimension]] that is both unseeable and spiritual, considering it to be "arguably the greatest expression of [Dalí's] scientific curiosity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160511-the-painter-who-entered-the-fourth-dimension|title=The painter who entered the fourth dimension|first=Fiona|last=Macdonald|publisher=BBC Culture|date=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Bolyer assesses it as "one of the most beautiful works of the modern era."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://garybolyer.com/2013/01/21/review-crucifixion-corpus-hypercubus-by-salvador-dali/|title=Review of Crucifixion Corpus Hypercubus by Salvador Dali|first=Gary|last=Bolyer|date=January 21, 2013|accessdate=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novelist [[Ayn Rand]] declared ''Corpus Hypercubus'' to be her favorite painting, and she would spend hours contemplating it at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. She felt a connection between John Galt's defiance over his spiritual ordeal in her novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'' and Dalí's portrayal of Christ in the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Britting- Ayn Rand {{citation broken|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reproduction of the painting is mentioned in [[J. G. Ballard]]'s 1969 surrealist novel, ''[[The Atrocity Exhibition]]'' and in [[Robert J. Sawyer]]'s 1998 science fiction novel, ''[[Factoring Humanity]]''.

== Exhibitions ==
After being first exhibited in Rome in 1954, ''Corpus Hypercubus'' was acquired in 1955 by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, where it was renamed ''Crucifixion''. After nearly 25 years, the painting was loaned to the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in Paris, the [[Daimaru Museum]] in Osaka, and the [[Tate Gallery]] in London from December 1979 until June 1980. Throughout the early and mid 1980s ''Crucifixion'' was loaned to museums in Japan, Mexico, and Spain, including the [[Palau Reial de Pedralbes]] in Barcelona, the only time the painting has been exhibited in Catalonia, Dalí's home region.

It was later loaned to the [[Staatsgalerie Stuttgart]] in Germany and the [[Pabellón de España]] in Madrid before being loaned long-term to the [[Salvador Dalí Museum]] (St. Petersburg, Florida) from 1993 to 1999. In 2000, it was loaned to the [[Wadsworth Atheneum]] in Connecticut from January to March and the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]] in Washington DC, as part of the traveling show "Dalí's Optical Illusions". In 2005, ''Corpus Hypercubus'' spent four months at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] in a major retrospective of Dalí's work, and in 2006 it was loaned to the [[Museum Ludwig]] in Cologne, before returning to New York City.&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt;

[[File:Phisicke Against Fortune 1579.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt; ''Phisicke Against Fortune'' &lt;br /&gt;book cover of 1579 ]]
'''''De remediis utriusque fortunae''''' is a collection of 254 [[Latin]] [[dialogues]] written by the humanist [[Francesco Petrarca]] (1304-1374), commonly known as [[Petrarch]].

The dialogues, completed towards the end of Petrarch's life, are treasure-chests of wisdom and humour which have not lost their relevance despite the passing of six centuries. They display remarkably lucid ideas that are cogently expressed. Drawing on classical sources, Petrarch expounded on refinement in taste and intellect, on finesse and propriety in speech and style.

The writing is a bouquet of moral philosophy, set out to show how thought and deed can generate happiness on the one hand, or sorrow and disillusionment on the other. In a recurring theme throughout the dialogues, Petrarch advises humility in prosperity and fortitude in adversity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colophon.com/foolscap/phis.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 254 woodcut illustrations by the anonymous [[Master of Petrarch]] for the 1532 German edition are considered masterpieces of the [[German Renaissance]].

In 1579 the dialogues were translated into English by the [[Elizabethan]] physician [[Thomas Twyne]] (1543–1613) as ''Phisicke Against Fortune'', and by [[Susannah Dobson]] in 1791 as ''Petrarch's View of Human Life''.&lt;ref&gt;Antonella Braida, "Dobson , Susannah (d. 1795)", ODNB, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7718 Retrieved 7 October 2014, subscription required.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sharon Chemical Works 1894.jpg|thumb|The Sharon Chemical Works- A J Keene, a member of the Derby Sketching Club]]
The''' Derby Sketching Club''' is a members' club now meeting in [[Littleover]], [[Derby, Derbyshire|Derby]], [[England]]. It was founded in 1887, and still meets today, providing members with facilities so they and others can work and share their interest in painting and sketching.&lt;ref name="reg"/&gt; Early members included F. Booty, [[Alfred John Keene]], William Swindell, George Thompson, Charles Terry and Frank Timms

==History==
In 1887, a group of young men held a meeting at the County hotel in Derby and founded the Derby Sketching Club with the aim of providing a place where they and others could work and share their interest in painting and sketching, a place to share their art. They set an annual fee of two shillings and sixpence. The first exhibition of their work was held in  January 1889, at the Athenaeum Rooms.

In 1922, the Derby Ladies Art Group was formed and it was only in 1951, for the Festival of Britain, that the two groups first held a joint Exhibition. They finally merged in 1966.

The art collector [[Alfred E. Goodey]].&lt;ref name=goodeys&gt;{{cite book|last=Allard|first=Sarah|title=Goodey's Derby p. 12|year=2003|publisher=Breedon Books|isbn=1-85983-379-9|pages=157|author2=Nicola Rippon}}&lt;/ref&gt; amassed the work of Derby Sketching Club members, and in the 1940s presented it to  [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]].

==Current activities==
There are regular sessions for members- for lifedrawing, and portrait painting and still life. There are guest lectures and exhibitions and members use the website to promote their work.&lt;ref name="reg"&gt;{{Official website|http://derbysketchingclub.co.uk}}, accessed July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other notable members==
[[Ernest Townsend]], R. W. Bardill, [[Harold Gresley]] and J. P. Wale.

[[File:Et nous aussi nous serons meres Lequeu.jpg|thumb|''And we too, shall be mothers, because.......!'' by [[Jean-Jacques Lequeu]], 1794]]
[[File:Achille Devéria erotism.jpg|thumb|200px|right|&lt;center&gt;In [[Achille Devéria]]'s "libertine watercolor" the explicit [[Cunnilingus|erotic scene]] is taking place clandestinely against the background of a "respectable" party seen at the back&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Erotic art''' covers any [[Work of art|artistic work]] that is intended to evoke [[Sexual arousal|erotic arousal]] or that depicts scenes of [[human sexuality|sexual activity]]. It is a type of [[erotica]] and includes drawings, engravings, films, paintings, photographs, and sculptures, and writing.

==Definition==
{{details|Erotic literature}}
The definition of erotic art is somewhat subjective, and dependent on context, since perceptions of both what is ''erotic'' and what is ''art'' vary. For example, a sculpture of a [[phallus]] in some cultures may be considered a traditional symbol of potency rather than overtly erotic. Material that is produced to illustrate [[sex education]] may be perceived by others as inappropriately erotic.

A distinction is often made between erotic art and [[pornography]], which also depicts scenes of sexual activity and is intended to evoke erotic arousal, but is not usually considered [[fine art]]. Some draw a distinction based on the work's intent and message: erotic art would be works intended for purposes in addition to arousal, which could be appreciated as art by someone uninterested in their erotic content. [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] Justice [[Potter Stewart]] famously wrote that the distinction was intuitive, saying about hard-core pornography which would not be legally protected as erotic art, "I know it when I see it"&lt;ref&gt;''Jacobellis v. Ohio'', 378 U.S. 184, 197 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical==
{{details|History of erotic depictions#Early depictions|Erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum}}
Among the oldest surviving examples of erotic depictions are [[Paleolithic]] cave paintings and carvings, but many cultures have created erotic art. Artifacts have been discovered from ancient Mesopotamia depicting explicit heterosexual sex.&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Black|first1=Jeremy|first2=Anthony|last2=Green|title=Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=05LXAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Inana|publisher=The British Museum Press|year=1992|isbn=0-7141-1705-6|pages=150-152|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NemetNejat"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nemet-Nejat|first=Karen Rhea|date=1998|title=Daily Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|location=Santa Barbara, California|publisher=Greenwood|series=Daily Life|isbn=978-0313294976|page=137|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glyptic art from the [[Sumer]]ian [[Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia)|Early Dynastic Period]] frequently shows scenes of frontal sex in the [[missionary position]].&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; In Mesopotamian [[Ex-voto|votive plaques]] from the early second millennium BC, the man is usually shown entering the woman from behind while she bends over, drinking [[beer]] through a straw.&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; [[Assyria|Middle Assyrian]] lead votive [[figurine]]s often represent the man standing and penetrating the woman as she rests on top of an altar.&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; Scholars have traditionally interpreted all these depictions as scenes of [[Hieros gamos|ritual sex]],&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; but they are more likely to be associated with the cult of [[Inanna]], the goddess of sex and prostitution.&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; Many sexually explicit images were found in the temple of Inanna at [[Assur]],&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; which also contained models of male and female sexual organs,&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; including stone [[phallus|phalli]], which may have been worn around the neck as an amulet or used to decorate [[Cult image|cult statues]],&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; and clay models of the female [[vulva]].&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt;

Depictions of sexual intercourse were not part of the general repertory of ancient Egyptian formal art,&lt;ref name="Gay1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robins|first1=Gay|title=Women in Ancient Egypt|date=1993|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-95469-6|pages=189-190|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UTSA88SVHCMC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=Turin+erotic+papyrus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMmKPkn8HYAhXLQt8KHePuB48Q6AEIRTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Turin%20erotic%20papyrus&amp;f=false|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rudimentary sketches of heterosexual intercourse have been found on pottery fragments and in graffiti.&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt; The [[Turin Erotic Papyrus]] (Papyrus 55001) is a {{convert|8.5|ft|m}} by {{convert|10|in|cm}} Egyptian papyrus scroll discovered at [[Deir el-Medina]],&lt;ref name=oconnor2001&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connor|first=David|title=Eros in Egypt|url=http://fontes.lstc.edu/~rklein/Documents/eros_in_egypt.htm|website=Archaeology Odyssey|date=September–October 2001|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt; the last two-thirds of which consist of a series of twelve [[Vignette (literature)|vignette]]s showing men and women in various [[sexual position]]s.&lt;ref name=oconnor2001/&gt; The men in the illustrations are "scruffy, balding, short, and paunchy" with exaggeratedly large genitalia&lt;ref name=schmidt2000&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmidt|first1=Robert A.|last2=Voss|first2=Barbara L.|date=2000|title=Archaeologies of Sexuality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eSBVQpifqhkC&amp;lpg=PA254&amp;pg=PA254#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Turin%20Papyrus%22&amp;f=false|location=Abingdon-on-Thames, England|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-22366-9|page=254|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not conform to Egyptian standards of physical attractiveness,&lt;ref name=schmidt2000/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt; but the women are [[nubile]]&lt;ref name=schmidt2000/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt; and they are shown with objects from traditional erotic [[iconography]], such as [[convolvulus]] leaves and, in some scenes, they are even holding items traditionally associated with [[Hathor]], the goddess of love, such as [[lotus flower]]s, monkeys, and [[sistra]].&lt;ref name=schmidt2000/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt; The scroll was probably painted in the Ramesside period (1292-1075 BC)&lt;ref name=oconnor2001/&gt; and its high artistic quality indicates that was produced for a wealthy audience.&lt;ref name=oconnor2001/&gt; No other similar scrolls have yet been discovered.&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt;

The ancient [[Greeks]] painted sexual scenes on their ceramics, many of them famous for being some of the earliest depictions of same-sex relations and pederasty, and there are numerous sexually explicit paintings on the walls of ruined Roman buildings in [[Pompeii]]. The [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] of [[Peru]] in [[South America]] are another ancient people that sculpted explicit scenes of sex into their pottery.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, M., Leslie, J. &amp; Butts, S. (2005) ''Pornography: the Secret History of Civilization'' [DVD], Koch Vision.&lt;/ref&gt; There is an entire gallery devoted to pre-Columbian erotic ceramics ([[Moche (culture)|Moche]] culture) in [[Lima]] at the [[Larco Museum]].

Additionally, there has been a long tradition of erotic painting in Eastern cultures. In [[Japan]], for example, [[Shunga (art)|shunga]] appeared in the 13th century and continued to grow in popularity until the late 19th century when photography was invented.&lt;ref name = shunga&gt;{{cite web| title = Shunga| publisher = Japanese art net and architecture users system| year = 2001| url = http://www.aisf.or.jp/%7Ejaanus/deta/s/shunga.htm| accessdate = 2006-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the erotic art of [[China]] reached its popular peak during the latter part of the [[Ming Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Bertholet, L. C. P. (1997) "Dreams of Spring: Erotic Art in China," in: ''Bertholet Collection'', Pepin Press (October, 1997) {{ISBN|90-5496-039-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[India]], the famous [[Kama Sutra]] is an ancient sex manual that is still popularly read throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;Daniélou, A., trans. (1993) ''The Complete Kama Sutra: the first unabridged modern translation'', Inner Traditions. {{ISBN|0-89281-525-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fellatiomoche.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Moche (culture)|Moche]] ceramic depicting fellatio, ca. 200 AD, [[Larco Museum]] Collection]]
In Europe, starting with the [[Renaissance]], there was a tradition of producing [[erotica]] for the amusement of the aristocracy. In the early 16th century, the text ''[[I Modi]]'' was a [[woodcut]] album created by the designer [[Giulio Romano]], the engraver [[Marcantonio Raimondi]] and the poet [[Pietro Aretino]]. In 1601 [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]] painted the "[[Amor Vincit Omnia (Caravaggio)|Amor Vincit Omnia]]," for the collection of the Marquis Vincenzo Giustiniani.

An erotic cabinet, ordered by [[Catherine the Great]], seems to have been adjacent to her suite of rooms in the [[Gatchina Palace]]. The furniture was highly eccentric with tables that had large penises for legs. Penises and vaginas were carved on the furniture. The walls were covered in erotic art. The rooms and the furniture were seen in 1941 by two Wehrmacht-officers but they seem to have vanished since then.&lt;ref&gt;Igorʹ Semenovich Kon and James Riordan, ''Sex and Russian Society'' page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4512/Cultuur/archief/article/detail/1775415/2003/12/06/Het-Geheim-van-Catherina-de-Grote.dhtml|title=Het Geheim van Catherina de Grote|newspaper=Trouw|author=Peter Dekkers|date=6 December 2003|trans-title=The Secret of Catherine the Great|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; A documentary by Peter Woditsch suggests that the cabinet was in the [[Peterhof Palace]] and not in Gatchina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Secret of Catherine the Great|url=http://www.deproductie.nl/en/films/het-geheim-van-catherina-de-grote/|last=Woditsch|first=Peter|website=De Productie|accessdate=8 July 2014}} Includes trailer of the documentary by Peter Woditsch.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition was continued by other, more modern painters, such as [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]], [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]], [[Jean-François Millet|Millet]], [[Balthus]], [[Picasso]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Egon Schiele]]. Schiele served time in jail and had several works destroyed by the authorities for offending contemporary mores with his depictions of nude girls.

By the 20th century, photography became the most common medium for erotic art. Publishers like [[Taschen]] mass-produced erotic illustrations and [[erotic photography]].

==Modern==
[[File:Ciągliński Symbolic dance.jpg|thumb|150px|left|''Symbolic dance'' by [[Jan Ciągliński]], late 19th-century subtle [[lesbian]] erotica ([[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]]).]]
Today, erotic artists thrive, although in some circles, much of the genre is still not as well accepted as the more standard genres of art such as portraiture and landscape. During the last few centuries, society has broadened its view of what can be considered as art and several new styles developed during the 19th century such as [[Impressionism]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]]. This has given today's artists a broad variety of genres from which to choose, including; [[Fantasy art|fantasy]], [[Pinup art|pinup]], [[Horror fiction|horror]], [[Fetish art|fetish]], [[Adult comics|comics]], [[anime]], [[hentai]], and many other niche genres all with erotic elements.

Classic "war-era" pin-ups like the works of [[Alberto Vargas]], [[Gil Elvgren]] and [[Baron Von Lind]], are still as popular as their contemporaries: [[Bunny Yeager]], [[Greg Hildebrandt]], [[Olivia De Berardinis]], [[Hajime Sorayama]], [[Aslan (artist)|Alain Aslan]], and [[List of pin-up artists|others]].

The acceptance and popularity of erotic art has pushed the genre into mainstream pop-culture and has created many famous icons. [[Frank Frazetta]], [[Luis Royo]], [[Boris Vallejo]], [[Chris Achilleos]], and [[Clyde Caldwell]] are among the artists whose work has been widely distributed.  The Guild of Erotic Artists were formed in 2002 to bring together a body of like minded individuals whose sole purpose was to express themselves and promote the sensual art of erotica for the modern age.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview, see Eberhard and Phyllis Kronhausen: ''Erotic Art.'' Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers, [[New York City|New York]] 1993, {{ISBN|0-88184-970-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2010 and 2015 [[sexologist]] and [[gallerist]] [[Laura Henkel]], curator of the [[Erotic Heritage Museum]] and the Sin City Gallery, organised 12 Inches of Sin, an exhibition focussing on art that expresses a diverse view of sexuality and challenging ideas of high and low art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/las-vegas-sexologist-art|title=One Sexologist’s Quest to Stimulate Las Vegas’ Art Scene|website=The Creators Project|author=Alyssa Buffenstein|date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Henkel collaborated with former [[MoMA]] curator and art historian Rosa JH Berland to create the Modern Provocateur Manifesto, that describes artwork that is about human sexuality.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Legal standards==
Whether or not an instance of erotic art is [[obscene]] depends on the standards of the jurisdisction and community in which it is displayed.

In the [[United States]], the 1973 ruling of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''[[Miller v. California]]'' established a three-tiered [[Miller test|test]] to determine what was obscene—and thus not protected, versus what was merely erotic and thus protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

Delivering the opinion of the court, Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;
The basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be: (a) whether 'the average person, applying contemporary community standards' would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.&lt;ref&gt;''Miller v. California'', 413 U.S. 15, 24 (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As this is still much more vague than other judicial tests within U.S. jurisprudence, it has not reduced the conflicts that often result, especially from the ambiguities concerning what the "contemporary community standards" are. Similar difficulties in distinguishing between erotica and obscenity have been found in other legal systems.

A '''fairy door''' is a miniature [[door]], usually set into the base of a tree, behind which may be small spaces where people can leave notes, wishes, or gifts for the "fairies". fairy doors are easily spotted by fairy's if they are pink or surrounded by shells. If it is your first time talking to the fairy ask questions about their life. Friendly fairies respond to notes . Only one fairy can access the door and be your friend.

[[File:FaeDoorSketch1590c.jpg|thumb|upright|Fae Door Legend Sketch 1590c]]
The Fae Door Legend, is that of a traveling door, given to a human, so that they may have access to the fae, and their realm. Legend states that a daughter of a brewer woman, had been going through trouble and the townsfolk had grudges against her for fear her mother was a witch. Late one night, the towns folk came to confront her mother. The daughter had woken up from the noise while the mother still slept, only to see a fae at a door, gesturing the daughter to come in. As soon as the mob came knocking at the door. The mother ran to get her daughter, only to see a door laying on the ground, wide open, with light coming through. She picked it up as the villagers set fire to the straw on her house. In nearby woods, she placed the door down at the base of a willow tree, and as she tried to open it, it wouldn't budge. She heard her daughter call out to her, but she couldn't ever open the door, so she carried it the rest of her life, waiting for the door to open once again.


== Uses and materials ==
Fairy doors can be purchased commercially and many are public art installations crafted by unknown artists.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/04/fairies-fairy-doors-wayford-woods-somerset|title=Don’t do away with the fairies: we need to relearn our sense of the magical|date=2015-03-04|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be crafted from a wide variety of materials and many architectural styles, and are not obligated to follow a woodland theme. Some fairy doors have working parts such as key holes with working locks and doors with working lights, as in the case of a fairy door located in the downtown branch of the Ann Arbor, Michigan public library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2015/05/fairy_doors_in_ann_arbor.html "Your guide to Ann Arbor fairy doors"]. ''MLive.com''. Retrieved 2017-03-18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Doors do not have to include the functionality of opening and can be painted or glued onto the building or tree where it is installed.

Some parents and guardians use fairy doors to stimulate their children's imaginations and prompt creative thinking, describing the fairies as creatures that use their magical powers to protect children from bad dreams, grant their wishes if they are well-behaved, and replace lost teeth with small rewards.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/11807974/The-fairytale-start-up-helping-childrens-imaginations-run-wild.html "The fairytale start-up helping children's imaginations run wild"].

== Notable past and present fairy doors ==
[[File:Corvallis, OR Fairy Door (version 2).jpg|thumb|Fairy door in [[Corvallis, Oregon]].]]
Fairy doors can be found in many locations, most of which are attributed to anonymous artists. 
* [[Golden Gate Park]], [[San Francisco]]: In 2013Tony Powell, author [[Tony Powell (writer)|Tony Powell]], with help from his son Rio, placed a fairy door that was hand-crafted with stain-finished wood, complete with a drawer-pull door handle and brass hinges, another measuring a foot tall. The door was removed by park officials shortly after its installation, but was replaced with a new door due to public outcry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/cityinsider/2013/09/16/the-tiny-tree-door-saga-continues/|title=The tiny tree door saga continues|date=2013-09-16|work=City Insider|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, the door with two tiny brass hinges was removed for concerns of damaging the tree, but was replaced with a door the park officials had made by tracing the removed, beyond-repair door onto wood, and had one giant steel hinge.
* [[Alameda, California]]: "An urban art movement of tiny doors hitting the curbs, trees, and public spaces on the Island and spreads a little whimsy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Victoria |last=Reim |url=http://www.alamedaoakleaf.com/2016/03/03/an-alamedans-guide-to-the-secret-world-of-fairy-houses/|title= An Alamedan’s Guide To The Secret World Of Fairy Houses|work=alamedaoakleaf.com|date=2016-03-03|accessdate=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Laura |last=Casey |url=https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2017/12/14/fairy-door-craze-takes-over-alamedas-webster-street/|title=Fairy door craze takes over Alameda’s Webster Street|work=eastbaytimes.com|date=2017-12-14|accessdate=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Eve |last=Pearlman |url=http://www.alamedamagazine.com/Mouse-or-Fairy-Doors-Spring-Up-in-Alameda/|title=Mouse or Fairy Doors Spring Up in Alameda|work=alamedamagazine.com|date=2016-03-10|accessdate=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fairy Doors of Ann Arbor]]: A series of small doors that typically replicated the doors of the buildings they were installed on or in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5393277|title=The Wee Fairy Doors of Ann Arbor, Mich.|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Putnam, Connecticut]]: The downtown area has a dozen fairy doors created by different artists. Each door is stylized to represent the major American cities: New York, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Nashville, and New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ctvisit.com/articles/guide-putnams-fairy-doors|title=A Guide to Putnam's Fairy Doors|date=2016-05-01|work=Visit CT|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.connecticutmag.com/the-connecticut-story/hidden-connecticut-tucked-away-gems-to-visit/article_f4294ae2-f3a1-11e6-940e-475e7339fa87.html|title=Hidden Connecticut: 30 Tucked-away Gems to Visit|work=Connecticut Magazine|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Portland, Oregon]]:  The city has two fairy doors in a northeast community garden. The doors are housed in a miniature fairy garden within the community garden. The fairy garden holds a hotel, a Ferris wheel, and an archery field.&lt;ref&gt;Tabora-Roberts, Toni.

* [[Maricara Natural Area]], Portland, Oregon: Several doors were installed in the area and were well received by most locals. The doors were eventually removed by an anonymous environmentalist vandal posing as a Parks and Recreation worker. They also posted a falsified notice from Parks and Recreation that cited city codes as the reason for the door's removal, prompting Parks and Recreation to clarify that they did not remove the doors.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, Stephen.

* Wayford Woods, [[Crewkerne]], [[Somerset]]: About 200 fairy doors made of different materials and by different artists were installed along the woodland trails, leading to an increase of tourists. As the town was unable to deal with the increased tourism and garbage began to accumulate along the woodland trails, the doors were removed by trustees.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Criticism ==
Reception for fairy doors have been mixed, as proponents claim that the doors are entertaining and can stimulate the imagination while critics claim that the doors can cause damage to property or surrounding flora and fauna.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Residents in the small town of [[Crewkerne]], [[Somerset]] complained over a series of 200 fairy doors that had been installed in the nearby Wayford Woods as the village's infrastructure was not equipped to deal with the amount of tourism that the doors attracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-somerset-30687171|title='Fairy control' to halt tiny doors in Somerset woods|date=2015-03-04|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The townspeople also complained of increased garbage along the wood's trails, leading to the woodland's trustees removing the fairy doors.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Morris, Steven, 2015 "Disenchanted Woodland Trustees Banish Fairy Doors", ''The Guardian'', 23 August 2015, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics also argue that some fairy doors are overly gaudy and garish.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Helaman Rolfe Pratt Ferguson''' (born 1940 in [[Salt Lake City]], Utah) is an American [[sculptor]] and a [[digital artist]], specifically an [[algorist (artist)|algorist]]. He is also well known for his development of the [[PSLQ algorithm]], an integer relation detection algorithm.

==Early life and education==
Ferguson's mother died when he was about three and his father went off to serve in the [[Second World War]].  He was adopted by an Irish immigrant and raised in New York. He learned to work with his hands in an old-world style with earthen materials from his adoptive father who was a carpenter and stonemason by trade. An art-inclined math teacher in high school helped him develop his dual interests in math and art.

Ferguson was a graduate of [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]], a liberal arts school in New York. In 1971, he received a Ph.D. in mathematics from the [[University of Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helasculpt.com/theartist/ helaman ferguson sculpture: the artist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Ferguson and his wife, Claire, later moved to Utah, where he continued to teach math and she studied art at [[Brigham Young University]]. The couple raised their seven children, while Ferguson was tenured at BYU for 17 years. Ferguson is a Latter-day Saint.

==Work==
In 1977, Ferguson and another mathematician, [[Rodney Forcade]], developed an algorithm for integer relation detection. It was first viable generalization of the Euclidean algorithm to three or more variables.&lt;ref&gt;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Ferguson-ForcadeAlgorithm.html&lt;/ref&gt; A more notable integer relation detection algorithm he developed, the [[PSLQ algorithm]], was selected as one of the "Top Ten Algorithms of the Century" by [[Jack Dongarra]] and Francis Sullivan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siam.org/pdf/news/637.pdf ''The Best of the 20th Century: Editors Name Top 10 Algorithms''] by [[Barry A. Cipra]]; SIAM News, Volume 33, Number 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PSLQAlgorithm.html PSLQ Algorithm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nersc.gov/news/newsroom/bailey1-20-00.php An Algorithm for the Ages: PSLQ, A Better Way to Find Integer Relations]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, Ferguson and his wife Claire Ferguson delivered an MAA Invited Address, titled "Mathematics in Stone and Bronze," at the Joint Math Meetings in Baltimore Maryland. He is an active artist, often representing mathematical shapes in his works. One of the first bronze torii sculpted by Ferguson was exhibited at a computer art exhibition in 1989 at the Computer Museum in Boston. His most widely known piece of art is a 27-inch (69 centimeters) bronze sculpture, [[Umbilic Torus]]. In 2010, the [[Simons Foundation]], a private institution committed to the advancement of science and mathematics, commissioned him to create the Umbilic Torus SC, a massive 8.5 meter-high cast bronze and granite sculpture weighing more than nine tons. With its installation completed in 2012, the torus sculpture was donated to [[Stony Brook University]], in Long Island, N.Y., and sits outside  the Math and Physics buildings of the same university, near the [[Simons Center for Geometry and Physics]]. Mounted on a stainless steel column, the torus has a 7.7 meter diameter as the granite base, where various mathematical formulas defining the torus are inscribed.&lt;ref&gt;Helaman Ferguson, "Two Theorems, Two Sculptures, Two Posters", American Mathematical Monthly, Volume 97, Number 7,August–September 1990, pages 589-610.&lt;/ref&gt; To create the humongous sculpture, Ferguson wrote a program consisting of 25,000 movements to control a 16-by-20 robot arm and its affixed foot-long industrial diamond-encrusted cutting tool.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2012-12-11/explore/bs-exho-helaman-fergusons-sculpture-blends-the-artistic-mathematic-20121211_1_mathematics-helaman-ferguson-golden-age&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heritage Preservation''' is an [[United States|American]] [[non-profit organization]] founded in 1973. Its mission is to preserve the nation’s heritage for future generations through innovative leadership, education, and programs.

==History==
[[List of dates in the history of art conservation|In 1973]], the National Conservation Advisory Council was organized in November, funded by the National Museum Act of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. The NCAC surveyed national needs and became the National Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Property in 1982, and changed its name again to Heritage Preservation in 1997.&lt;ref name="AIC Bulletin 1974"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Edward R.|title=National Conservation Advisory Council|journal=Bulletin of the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|year=1974|volume=14|series=Papers Presented at the Second Annual Meeting. American Institute for the Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, Inc.|issue=2|pages=154–159|jstor=3179333}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Secretary of Interior Journal - Spring 1978"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berry|first=Betty|title=Writer-Editor, National Register Division|journal=11593 - Information Related to the Responsibilities of the Secretary of the Interior|year=1978|volume=Special Energy Issue|issue=Spring|pages=1–3|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/11593/Special-Energy-Issue.pdf|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of its first major projects was called [[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]] (SOS!). Initiated in 1989, the project is a community-based effort to identify, document, and conserve outdoor [[sculpture]] in the United States. By fostering awareness and appreciation, SOS! aims to advocate proper care of a nationwide public resource.  The [[Smithsonian Museum of American Art]] has become an active partner in the SOS! Project.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian American Art Museum website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Programs|url=http://americanart.si.edu/research/programs/sos/|work=Smithsonian American Art Museum Website|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project may be viewed as a precursor of community-generated or “crowd-sourced” social media-driven initiatives.

[[File:Wood Bodhisattva 2.jpg|thumb|right|230px|A [[China|Chinese]] wooden [[Bodhisattva]], [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]], [[Shanghai Museum]].]]
Wood carving is one of the oldest arts of humankind. Wooden spears from the Middle Paleolithic, such as the [[Clacton Spear]], show that people have engaged in utilitarian woodwork for millennia. Indeed the beginnings of the craft go so far back that, at least where [[timber]] is present, the use of wood exists as a universal in human culture as both a means to create or enhance technology and as a medium for artistry. The [[North American Indian]] carves his wooden fish-hook or his pipe stem just as the [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] works patterns on his paddle. The native of [[Guyana]] decorates his [[cavassa grater]] with a well-conceived scheme of incised scrolls, while the native of [[Loango Bay]] distorts his spoon with a design of figures standing up in full relief carrying a hammock. Wood carving is also present in architecture. 

Figure-work seems to have been universal. To carve a figure/design in wood may be not only more difficult but also less satisfactory than [[sculpture|sculpting]] with marble, owing to the tendency of wood to crack, to be damaged by insects, or to suffer from changes in the atmosphere. The texture of the material, too, often proves challenging to the expression of features, especially in the classic type of youthful face. On the other hand, magnificent examples exist of the more rugged features of age: the beetling brows, the furrows and lines neutralizing the defects of the grain of the wood. In ancient work the surface may not have been of such consequence, for figures as a rule being painted for protection and especially color.

It is not always realized at the present day to what extent color has even from the most ancient times been used to enhance the effect of wood-carving and sculpture. The modern colour prejudice against gold and other tints is perhaps because painted work has been vulgarized. The arrangement of a proper and harmonious scheme of colour is not the work of the [[Painter and decorator|house painter]], but of the specially trained artist.

In the early 20th century, the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]], on which much of this entry is based, commented, "Of late years carving has gone out of fashion. The work is necessarily slow and requires substantial skill, making the works expensive. Other and cheaper methods of decoration have driven carving from its former place. Machine work has much to answer for, and the endeavor to popularize the craft by means of the village class has not always achieved its own end. The gradual disappearance of the individual artist, elbowed out as he has been, by the contractor, is fatal to the continuance of an art which can never flourish when done at so much a yard." This statement has proven untrue, as the continued survival of the art and craft of woodcarving can be demonstrated by the large number of [[:Category:Woodcarvers|woodcarvers]] who have carried on or advanced the tradition in different parts of the world.

== Ancient Egypt ==
[[File:Modellino di barca, con schiavi, legno decorato, Museo Egizio, Torino.jpg|thumb|left|Ancient Egyptian servant statuettes]]

The extreme dryness of the climate of Egypt accounts for the existence of a number of woodcarvings from this remote period. Some wood panels from the tomb of Hosul Egypt, at [[Saqqara|Sakkarah]] are of the [[Old Kingdom|III. dynasty]]. The carving consists of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] and figures in low relief, and the style is extremely delicate and fine. A stool shown on one of the panels has the legs shaped like the fore and hind limbs of an animal, a form common in Egypt for thousands of years.

In the [[Cairo]] museum may be seen the statue of a man from the period of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], possibly 4000 B.C. The expression of the face and the realism of the carriage have never been surpassed by any Egyptian sculptor of this or any other period. The figure is carved out of a solid block of sycamore, and in accordance with the Egyptian custom the arms are joined on. The eyes are inlaid with pieces of opaque white quartz, with a line of bronze surrounding to imitate the lid; a small disk of transparent [[Quartz|rock crystal]] forms the iris, while a tiny bit of polished ebony fixed behind the crystal imparts to it a lifelike sparkle. The [[Old Kingdom|IV., V. and VI. dynasties]] cover the finest period of Egyptian sculpture. The statues found in the tombs show a freedom of treatment which was never reached in later times. They are all portraits, which the artist strove his utmost to render exactly like his model. For these are not, like mere modern statues, simply works of art, but had primarily a religious signification [[Gaston Camille Charles Maspero|(Maspero)]]. As the spirits of the deceased might inhabit, these [[Ka (Egyptian soul)|Ka]] statues, the features and proportions were closely copied.

There are to be found in the principal museums of Europe many Egyptian examples: mummy cases of human beings with the face alone carved, animal mummy cases, sometimes boxes, with the figure of a lizard, perhaps, carved in full Mummy relief standing on the lid. Sometimes the animal would be carved in the round and its hollowed body used as the case itself.

Of furniture, folding seats like the modern camp stool, and chairs with legs terminating in the heads of beasts or the feet of animals, Furniture still exist. Beds supported by lions paws [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|XI. and XII.]] dynasties, from [[Gebelein]], now in the [[Egyptian Museum|Cairo Museum]]), headrests, 6 or 8 in. high, shaped like a crutch on a foot, very like those used by the [[Papuan people|native of New Guinea]] today, are carved with scenes, etc., in outline. In [[British Museum|the British Museum]] may be seen a tiny little coffer, 4 in. by 21/2 in., with very delicate figures carved in low relief. This little box stands on cabriole legs 3/4 of an inch long with claw feet, quite [[Louis Quinze]] in character. There are incense ladles, the handle representing a bouquet of lotus flowers, the bowl formed like the leaf of an aquatic plant with serrated edges from [[Gurnah]] during the [[New Kingdom|XVIII. dynasty]]; mirror handles, representing a little pillar, or a lotus stalk, sometimes surmounted by a head of [[Hathor]], the Egyptian Venus or of [[Bes]], god of the toilet; pin-cushions, in the shape of a small round tortoise with holes in the back for toilet pins, which were also of wood with dog-head ends (XI. dynasty, Cairo Museum); and perfume boxes such as a fish, the two halves forming the bottom and top of the perfume or pomatum was removed by little wooden spoons, one shaped in the form of a cartouche emerging from a full-blown lotus, another shaped like the neck of a goose, a third consisting of a dog running with a fish in its closed mouth, the fish forming the bowl. The list might be prolonged, but enough has been said to show to what a pitch of refinement the art of wood-carving had reached thousands of years before the birth of [[Christ]].

Of the work of [[Assyria]], [[Greece]] and [[Rome]], little is actually known except from history or inference. It may be safely assumed that the Assyria craft kept pace with the varying taste and refinement of Greece and all the older civilizations. Important pieces of wooden [[Roman sculpture]] which once existed in Greece and other ancient countries are only known to us from the descriptions of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] and other classic writers. Many examples of the wooden images of the gods, were preserved down to late historic times. The [[Palladium (mythology)|Palladium]], or sacred figure of [[Athena|Pallas]], which was guarded by the [[Vestal Virgin]]s in Rome and was fabled to have been brought by [[Aeneas]] from the burning [[Troy]], was one of these wooden figures.

== Western World / Europe ==

Great works of art were created in wood during the entire [[Middle Ages]], eg in [[Cathedrals]], Abbeys and other Church connected sites. These works demonstrated both craftsmanship and artistry.

===First eleven centuries of CE===
[[File:RomaSSabinaPortaLigneaParticolare.JPG|thumb|Detail from the carved portal, of [[Santa Sabina|St Sabina]] on the [[Aventine Hill]], dating back from the 5th century]]

Wood-carving examples of the first eleven centuries of CE are rare due to the fact that wood do decay easily in 1,000 years. The carved panels of the main doors of [[Santa Sabina|St Sabina]] on the [[Aventine Hill]], Rome, are very interesting specimens of early Christian relief sculpture in wood, dating, as the dresses show, from the 5th century. The doors are made up of a large number of small square panels, each minutely carved with a scene from the Old or New Testament. A very fine fragment of Byzantine art (11th or 12th centuries) is preserved in a monastery at [[Mount Athos]] in Macedonia. It consists of two panels (one above the other) of relief sculpture, surmounted by a semicircular arch of conventional foliage springing from columns ornamented with animals in foliage of spiral form. The capitals and bases are square, each face being carved with a figure. It is a wonderfully fine piece of work, conceived in the best decorative spirit.

In Scandinavian countries we find some very early work of excellent design, both Christian and Non-Christian in nature, as "The Christening" in that part of the world took place quite late in the first millenium CE. In the Christiania Museum there are some fine chairs. In the Copenhagen Museum there are panels from Iceland in the same style. The celebrated wooden doorways of Aal (1200 CE), Sauland, Flaa, Solder and other Norwegian churches (Christiania Museum) has dragons and intricate scroll work, a style which we still see carried on in the door-posts of the 15th century in the [[Nordiska museum]], [[Stockholm]], and in the Icelandic work of quite modern times. In these early days the leaf was not much developed in design. The carver depended almost entirely on the stalk, a style of work which has its counterpart in [[Myanmar|Burmese]] work of the 17th century.

=== Gothic period (12th–15th centuries) ===
Towards the end of this epoch wood-carving reached its culminating point. The [[choir stall]]s, [[Rood screen|rood-screens]], roofs, [[retable]]s, of [[Britain in the Middle Ages|England]], [[France in the Middle Ages|France]] and the [[Germanic peoples|Teutonic]] countries of Europe, have in execution, balance and proportion, never at any time been approached. In small designs, in detail, in minuteness, in mechanical accuracy, the carver of this time has had his rivals, but for greatness of architectural conception, for a just appreciation of decorative treatment, the designer of the 15th century stands alone.

[[File:Gothic woodcarved beauty 2d.jpg|thumb|left|Gothic beauty in carved wood]]
It should always be borne in mind that color was the keynote of this scheme. The custom was practically universal, and enough traces remain to show how splendid was the effect of these old Gothic churches and cathedrals. The priests in their gorgeous [[vestment]]s, the lights, the [[crucifix]], the banners and [[incense]], the [[fresco]]ed or diapered walls, and that crowning glory of [[Gothic art]], the [[stained glass]], were all in harmony with these beautiful schemes of colored carved work. Red, blue, green, white and gilding were the tints as a rule used. Not only were the screens painted in colors, but the parts painted white were often further decorated with delicate lines and sprigs of foliage in conventional pattern. The plain surfaces of the panels were also adorned with saints, often on a background of delicate [[gesso]] diaper, colored or [[Gilding|gilded]] (Southwold). Nothing could exceed the beauty of the [[triptych]]s or retables of [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]], [[Flanders (county)|Flanders]] or France; carved with scenes from the [[New Testament]] in [[Alto-relievo|high relief]] arranged under a delicate lacework of canopies and clustered pinnacles glistening with gold and brilliant colors. In Germany the effect was further enhanced by emphasizing parts of the gilding by means of a transparent varnish tinted with red or green, thus giving a special tone to the metallic [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]].

The style of design used during this great period owes much of its interest to the now obsolete custom of directly employing the [[Artisan|craftsman]] and his men, instead of the present-day habit of giving the work to a contractor. It is easy to trace how those bands of carvers traveled about from church to church. In one district the designer would employ a particular form and arrangement of vine leaf, while in another adjoining quite a different style repeatedly appears. The general scheme was of course planned by one mastermind, but the carrying out of each section, each part, each detail, was left to the individual workman. Hence that variety of treatment, that endless diversity, which gives a charm and interest to Gothic art, unknown in more symmetrical epochs. The Gothic craftsman appreciated the cardinal fact that in design beautiful detail does not necessarily ensure a beautiful [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]], and subordinated the individual part to the general effect. He also often carved [[in situ]], a practice seldom if ever followed in the present day. Here and there one comes across the work of long years ago still unfinished. A half-completed bench-end, a fragment of screen left plain, clearly show that sometimes at least the church was the workshop.

=== Gothic and Renaissance: A comparison ===
Gothic design roughly divides itself into two classes:
#the geometrical, i.e. tracery and diaper patterns, and
#the foliage designs, where the mechanical scroll of the Renaissance is as a rule absent.

The lines of foliage treatment, so common in the bands of the 15th-century roodscreens and the panel work especially of Germany, serve to illustrate the widely different motives of the craftsmen of these two great epochs. Again, while the Renaissance designer as a rule made the two sides of the panel alike, the Gothic carver seldom repeated a single detail. While his main lines and grouping corresponded, his detail differed. Of numberless examples a 15th-century chest (Plate III. fig. 6) in the [[Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin]] may be referred to. The arrangements of foliage, etc., on top, back and front, are typical of Gothic at its best.

=== End of the 12th century ===
As this section treats of woodcarving in Europe generally, and not of any one country alone, the dates just named must be of necessity only approximate. The 13th century was marked not only by great skill both in design and treatment, but also much devotional feeling. The craftsman seems to have not merely carved, but to have carved to the glory of God. At no time was work more delicately conceived or more beautifully cut. This early Gothic style certainly lent itself to fine finish, and in this respect was more suited to stone treatment than to wood. But the loving care bestowed on each detail seems to point to a religious devotion which is sometimes absent from later work. Very good examples of [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] (now, alas, divided down the center) are to be seen in [[Peterborough Cathedral|Peterborough cathedral]]. Scrolls and foliage spring from groups of columns of four. Some [[Italy in the Middle Ages|Italian]] [[column]]s of the same date ([[Victoria and Albert Museum]]) should be compared, much to the advantage of the former. [[Exeter Cathedral]] boasts [[misericord]]s unsurpassed for skilful workmanship; mermaids, dragons, elephants, masks, knights and other subjects introduced into foliage, form the designs. [[Salisbury Cathedral|Salisbury cathedral]] is noted for its stall elbows, and the [[reredos]] in the south [[transept]] of [[Adisham]], [[Kent]], is another fine example testifying to the great skill of the 13th-century woodcarvers. A very interesting set of stalls, the early history of which is unknown, was placed in [[Barming]] church, Kent, about the year 1868. The book rest ends are carved with two scrolls and an animal standing between, and the ends of the stalls with figure sculpture:

=== 1300–1380 ===
During this period foliage forms, though still conventional, more closely followed nature. The canopy work of the choir of Winchester contains exquisite carvings of oak and other leaves. The choir stalls of Ely and Chichester and the tomb of Edward III. in [[Westminster Abbey]] are all fine examples of this period. Exeter boasts a throne that of [[Walter de Stapledon|Bishop Stapledon]] (1308–1326) standing {{convert|57|ft|m|abbr=on}} high, which remains unequaled for perfection of proportion and delicacy of detail. In France the stalls of St Benoit-sur-Loire, Lisieux, and Évreux are good 14th-century examples. But little Gothic work is now to be seen in the churches of this country. It is to the museums we have to look for traces of the old Gothic carvers. The two retables in Dijon Museum, the work of [[Jacques de Baerze]] (1301), a sculptor of Flanders, who carved for [[Philip II, Duke of Burgundy|Philippe le Hardi]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], are masterpieces of design and workmanship. The tracery is of the very finest, chiefly gilt on backgrounds of diapered gesso.

=== 1380–1520 ===
Towards the end of the 14th century carvers gave up natural foliage treatment to a great extent, and took to more conventional forms. The oak and the maple no longer inspired the designer, but the vine was constantly employed. A very large amount of 15th-century work remains to us, but the briefest reference only can be made to some of the more beautiful examples that help to make this period so great.

The [[rood screen]], that wonderful feature of the medieval church, was now universal. It consisted of a tall screen of usually about thirty ft. high, on the top of which rested a loft, i.e. a platform rood about {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}}. in width guarded on either side by a gallery screen, and either on the top or in front of that, facing the nave, was placed the rood, i.e. a large [[crucifix]] with figures of St Mary and St John on either side. This rood screen sometimes spanned the church in one continuous length ([[Leeds, Kent]]), but often filled in the aisle and [[chancel]] arches in three separate divisions (Church Handborough, Oxon.). The loft was as a rule approached by a winding stair built in the thickness of the aisle wall. The lower part of the screen itself was solid paneled to a height of about {{convert|3|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} and the upper part of this paneling was filled in with tracery (Carbrook, Norfolk), while the remaining flat surfaces of the panels were often pictured with saints on a background of delicate [[gesso]] [[diaper]] ([[Southwold|Southwold, Suffolk]]). Towards the end of this period the employment of figures became less common as a means of decoration, and the panels were sometimes filled- entirely with carved foliage (Swimbridge, Devon). The upper part of the rood screen consisted of open arches with the heads filled in with pierced tracery, often enriched with [[crocket]]s (Seaming, Norfolk), embattled transoms ([[Hedingham Castle]], [[Essex]]), or floriated cusps ([[Eye, Suffolk]]). The mullions were constantly carved with foliage (Cheddar, Somerset), pinnacles (Causton, Norfolk), angels ([[Pilton, Devon]]), or decorated with canopy work in gesso (Southwold). But the feature of these beautiful screens was the loft with its gallery and vaulting. The loft floor rested on the top of the rood screen and was usually balanced and kept in position by means of a groined vaulting (Harberton, Devon) or a cove (Eddington, Somerset). The finest examples of vaulting are to be seen in Devon. The bosses at the intersections of the ribs and the carved tracery of the screen at Honiton stand unrivaled. Many screens still possess the beam which formed the edge of the loft floor and on which the gallery rested. It was here that the medieval roodscreen carver gave most play to his fancy, and carved the finest designs in foliage to be seen throughout the whole Gothic period. Although these massed moulds, crests and bands have the appearance of being carved out of one log, they were in practice invariably built up in parts, much of the foliage, etc., being pierced and placed in hollow moulds in order to increase the shadow. As a rule the arrangement consisted of a crest running along the top, with a smaller one depending from the lower edge, and three bands of foliage and vine between them (Feniton, Devon). The designs of vine leaves at Kenton, Bow and Dartmouth, all in Devon, illustrate three very beautiful treatments of this plant. At Swimbridge, Devon, there is a very elaborate combination; the usual plain beads which separate the bands are carved with twisted foliage also. At Abbots Kerswell and other places in the district round Totnes the carvers introduced birds in the foliage with the best effect. The variety of cresting used is very great. That at Winchcomb, Gloucester, consists of dragons combined with vine leaves and foliage. It illustrates how Gothic carvers sometimes repeated their patterns in as mechanical a way as the worst workmen of the present time. Little can be said of the galleries, so few remain to us. They were nearly all pulled down when the order to destroy the roods was issued in 1548. That they were decorated with carved saints under niches (Llananno, Wales), or painted figures (Strencham, Worcester), is certain from the examples that have survived the Reformation. At Atherington. Devon, the gallery front is decorated with the royal [[coat of arms]], other heraldic devices, and with prayers. The Breton screen at [[Le Faouët (Morbihan)|St Fiacre-le-Faouet]] is a wonderful example of French work of this time, btit does not compare with the best English examples. Its flamboyant lines and its small tracery never obtained any foothold in England, though screens carved in this way (Colebrook, Devon) are sometimes to be found.

The rood was sometimes of such dimensions as to require some support in addition to the gallery on which it rested. A carved beam was used from which a chain connected the rood itself. At [[Cullompton]], Devon, such a beam still exists, and is carved with foliage; an open cresting ornaments the under side and two angels support the ends. This particular rood stood on a base of rocks, skulls and bones, carved out of two solid logs averaging 18 in. wide and 21 in. high, and together measuring {{convert|15|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} long; there are round holes along the top which were probably used for lights.

No country in Europe possesses roofs to equal those of England created in the 15th century. The great roof of [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster Hall]] remains to the present day unique. In Norfolk and Suffolk roofs abound of the [[Hammerbeam roof|hammerbeam class]]; that at Woolpit, Suffolk, achieves the first rank of quality. Each bracket is carved with strongly designed foliage, the end of every beam terminates in an angel carrying a shield, and the purlins are crested, while each truss is supported by a canopied riche (containing a figure) resting on an angel corbel. Here, too, as at Ipswich and many other churches, there is a row of angels with outspread wings under the wall-plate. This idea of angels in the roof is a very beautiful one, and the effect is much enhanced by the coloring. The roof at St Nicholas, [[King's Lynn]], is a magnificent example of tiebeam construction. The trusses are filled in with tracery at the sides and the centres more or less open, and the beams, which are crested and embattled, contain a row of angels on either side. In Devon, Cullompton possesses a very fine semicircular ceiling supported at intervals by ribs pierced with carving. Each compartment is divided up into small square panels, crossed by diagonal ribs of cresting, while every joint is ornamented with a boss carved in the decorative way peculiar to the Gothic craftsman. The nave roof of [[Manchester Cathedral|Manchester cathedral]] is nearly flat, and is also divided up into small compartments and bossed; the beams are supported by carved brackets resting on corbels with angels at each base.

[[File:Ulm-Muenster-ChorGestuehl2-061104.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bust of [[Cicero]] by Jörg Syrlin t.E., in the [[Ulm Münster]]]]
In the 15th century, choir stalls with their canopies continued to increase in magnificence. Manchester cathedral (middle of 15th century) and [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] chapel in Westminster Abbey (early 16th) are good examples of the fashion of massing ~7~7 pinnacles and canopies; a custom which hardly compares with the more simple beauty of the 14th-century work of [[Ely Cathedral|Ely cathedral]]. The stalls of [[Amiens Cathedral|Amiens]] cathedral were perhaps the finest in the world at the beginning of the 16th century. The cresting employed, though common on the Continent, is of a kind hardly known in England, consisting as it does of arches springing from arches, and decorated with crockets and finials. The tabernacle work over the end seats, with its pinnacles and [[flying buttress]]es, stretches up towards the roof in tapering lines of the utmost delicacy. The choir stalls (the work of [[Jörg Syrlin the Elder]]) in Ulm cathedral are among the finest produced by the German carver. The front panels are carved with foliage of splendid decorative boldness, strength and character; the stall ends were carved with foliage and sculpture along the top edge, as was sometimes the case in Bavaria and France as well as Germany.

In early times the choir alone possessed seats, the nave being left bare. Gradually benches were introduced, and during the 15th century became universal. The [[Poppyhead (carving)|poppyhead]] form of B ornament now reached perfection and was constantly used enc for seats other than those of the choir. The name refers en a. to the carved finial which is so often used to complete the top of the bench end and is peculiarly English in character. In Devon and Cornwall it is rarely met with ([[Ilsington]], [[Devon]]). In Somerset it is more common, while in the eastern counties thousands of examples remain. The quite simple [[Fleur-de-lis|fleur-de-lys]] form of poppyhead, suitable for the village, is seen in perfection at Trunch, Norfolk, and the very elaborate form when the poppyhead springs from a crocketed circle filled in with sculpture, at St Nicholas, King's Lynn. Often the foliage contained a face ([[St Margaret's, Cley]], Norfolk), or the poppyhead consisted of figures or birds only ([[Thurston, Suffolk]]) or a figure standing on a dragon (Great Brincton, Northampton); occasionally the traditional form was departed from and the finial carved like a lemon in outline (Bury St Edmuncis) or a diamond (Tirley, Glos.). In Denmark an ornament in the form of a large circle sometimes takes the place of the English poppy-head. In the Copenhagen Museum there is a set of bench ends of the 15th century with such a decoration carved with coats of arms, interlacing strap-work, etc. But the old 15th-century bench end did not depend entirely on the poppy-head for its embellishment. The side was constantly enriched with elaborate tracery (Dennington, Norfolk) or with tracery and domestic scenes (North Cadbury, Somerset), or would consist of a mass of sculpture in perspective, with canopy work, buttresses and sculptured niches, while the top of the bench end would be crowned with figures carved in the round, of the finest craftsmanship. Such work at Amiens cathedral is a marvel alike of conception, design and execution. In the [[Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin]] some beautiful stall ends are to be seen. Out of a dragons mouth grows a conventional tree arranged and balanced in excellent proportion. On another, stall end a tree is carved growing out of the mouth of a fool. This custom of making foliage grow out of the mouth or eyes is hardly defensible, and was by no means confined to any country or time. We have plenty of Renaissance examples of the same treatment.

Before the 15th century preaching had not become a regular institution in England, and pulpits were not so common. However, the value of the sermon began to be appreciated from the use to which the Lollards and other sects put this method of teaching doctrine, and pulpits became a necessity. A very beautiful one exists at [[Kenton, Devon]]. It is, as is generally the case, octagonal, and stands on a foot. Each angle is carved with an upright column of foliage between pinnacles, and the panels, which are painted with saints, are enriched with carved canopies and foliage; it is, however, much restored. The puipit at Trull, Somerset, is noted for its fine figure carving. A large figure standing under a canonv fills each of the nanelled sides. while many other smaller figures help to enrich the general effect. Examples of Gothic sounding boards are very rare; that, together with the pulpit, in the choir of Winchester is of the time of [[Thomas Silkstede|Prior Silkstede]] (1520), and is carved with his rebus, a skein of twisted silk.

The usual form of font cover during the hundred years before the Reformation was pyramidal, the ribs of the salient angles being Fo straight and cusped (Frindsbury, Kent) or of curved outline and cusped (St Mildred, Canterbury). There is a very charming one of this form at Colebrook, Devon. It is quite plain but for a little angel kneeling on the top, with its hands clasped in prayer. But the most beautiful form is the massed collection of pinnacles and canopy work, of which there is such a fine example at [[Sudbury, Suffolk]]. It was not uncommon to carve a dove on the topmost pinnacle (Castleacre, Norfolk), in allusion to the descent of the Holy Spirit. The finest font in England is undoubtedly that of Ijiford, Suffolk. It rises some {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}}. in height, arid when the panels were painted with saints and the exquisite tabernacle work colored and gilded, must have been a masterpiece of Gothic craftsmanship. A cord connecting the tops of these covers with the roof or with a carved beam standing out from the wall, something like a crane (Salle, Norfolk), was used to remove the cover on the occasion of baptism.

Many [[lectern]]s of the Gothic period do not exist today. They usually had a double sloping desk which revolved round a central moulded post. The lectern at Swanscombe, Kent, has an eras, circle of good foliage ornamenting each face of the book rest, and sonic tracery work at either end. The box form is more common in France than in England, the pedestal of such a lectern being surrounded by a casing of three or more sides. A good example with six sides is in the church of Vance (France), and one of triangular form in the Muse of Bourges, while a four-sided box lectern is still in use in the church of Lenham, Kent. The Gothic prayer desk, used for private devotional purposes, is hardly known in England, but is not uncommon on the Continent. There is a beautiful specimen in the Muse, Bourges; the front and sides of the part for kneeling are carved with that small tracery of flowing character so common in France and Belgium during the latter part of the 15th century, and the back, which rises to a height of {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}}., contains a little crucifix with traceried decoration above and below.

A word should be said about the [[ciboria]], so often found on the Oboria continent of Europe. In tapering arrangement of tabernacle work they rival the English font covers in delicacy of outline (Muse, Rouen).

Numbers of doors are to be met with not only in churches but also in private houses. [[Lavenham]], [[Suffolk]], is rich in work of this latter class. In England the general custom was to carve the head of the door only with tracery (East Brent, Somerset), but in the [[Tudor period]] doors were some times covered entirely with [[linenfold]] paneling ([[St Albans Abbey]]). This form of decoration was exceedingly common on the Continent as well as in England. In France the doors towards the latter part of the 15th century were often square-headed, or perhaps had the corners rounded. These doors were usually divided into some six or eight oblong panels of more or less equal size. One of the doors of Bourges Cathedral is treated thus, the panels being filled in with very good tracery enriched with crockets and coats of arms. But a more restrained form of treatment is constantly employed, as at the church of St Godard, Rouen, where the upper panels only are carved with tracery and coats of arms and the lower adorned with simple linenfold design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |title=Wood-Carving |page=794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To Spain and the Teutonic countries of Europe we look for the most important object of church decoration, the retable; the Reformation accounting for the absence in England of any work of this iec kind. The magnificent [[Altarpiece|altar-piece]] in [[Schleswig Cathedral|Schleswig cathedral]] was carved by [[Hans Bruggerman]], and consists, like many others, of a number of panels filled with figures standing some four or five deep. The figures in the foremost rows are carved entirely separate, and stand out by themselves, while the background is composed of figure work and architecture, etc., in diminishing perspective. The panels are grouped together under canopy work forming one harmonious whole. The genius of this great carver shows itself in the large variety of the facial expression of those wonderful figures all instinct with life and movement, In France few retables exist outside the museums. In the little church of Marissel, not far from [[Beauvais]], there is a retable consisting of eleven panels, the crucifixion being, of course, the principal subject. And there is a beautiful example from Antwerp in the Muse Cluny, Paris; the pierced tracery work which decorates the upper part being a good example of the style composed of interlacing segments of circles so common on the Continent during late Gothic times and but seldom practised in England. ln Spain the cathedral of Valladolid was famous for its retable, and [[Alonzo Cano|Alonso Cano]] and other sculptors frequently used wood for large statuary, which was painted in a very realistic way with the most startlingly lifelike effect. Denmark also possessed a school of able wood-carvers who imitated the great altar-pieces of Germany. A very large and well-carved example still exists in the cathedral of Roskilde. But besides these great altarpieces tiny little models were carved on a scale the minuteness of which staggers the beholder. [[Triptych]]s and shrines, etc., measuring but a few inches were filled in with tracery and figures that excite the utmost wonder. In the British Museum there is such a triptych (Flemish, I 511); the center panel, measuring an inch or two square, is crowded with figures in full relief and in diminishing perspective, after the custom of this period. This rests on a semicircular base which is carved with the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]], and is further ornamented with figures and animals. The whole thing inclusive measures about 9 in. high, and, with the triptych wings open, 5 in. wide. The extraordinary delicacy and minuteness of detail of this microscopic work baffle description. There is another such a piece, also Flemish, in the Wallace collection, which rivals that just referred to in rni&amp; applied talent. For, marvellous as these works of art are, they fail to satisfy. They make ones eyes ache, they worry one as to how the result could ever have been obtained, and after the first astonishment one must ever feel that the same work of art on a scale large enough for a cathedral could have been carved with half the labor.

With regard to paneling generally, there were, during the last fifty years of the period now under review, three styles of design followed by most European carvers, each of which attained great notoriety. Firstly, a developed form of small Panelling. tracery which was very common in France and the Netherlands. A square-headed panel would be filled in with small detail of flamboyant character, the perpendicular line or mullion being always subordinate, as in the German chasse (Muse Cluny), and in some cases absent, as the screen work of Évreux cathedral shows us. Secondly, the [[linenfold]] design. The great majority of examples are of a very conventional form, but at [[Bere Regis]], Dorsetshire, the designs with tassels, and at St Sauvur, Caen, those with fringe work, readily justify the universal title applied to this very decorative treatment of large surfaces. At the beginning of the 16th century yet another pattern became the fashion. The main lines of the design consisted of flat hollow mouldings sometimes in the form of interlacing circles (Gatton, Surrey), at other times chiefly straight (Rochester cathedral), and the intervening spaces would be filled in with cusps or sprigs of foliage. It marks the last struggle of this great school of design to withstand the oncoming flood of the new art, the great Renaissance. From this time onward Gothic work, in spite of various attempts, has never again taken a place in domestic decoration. The lines of the tracery style, the pinnacle, and the crocket unequaled as they have always been in devotional expression are universally considered unsuited for decoration in the ordinary house.

But little reference can be made to the domestic side of the period which ended with the dawn of the 16th century, because so few remains exist. At [[Bayeux]], [[Bourges]], [[Reims]] and preeminently [[Rouen]], we see by the figures of saints, bishops or virgins, how much the religious feeling of the Middle Ages entered into the domestic life. In England the carved corner post (which generally carried a bracket at the top to support the overhanging storey) calls for comment. In [[Ipswich]], there are several such posts. On one house near the river, that celebrated subject, the fox preaching to geese, is carved in graphic allusion to the dissemination of false doctrine.

Of mantelpieces, there is a good example in the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen|Rouen Museum]]. The overhanging corners are supported by dragons and the plain mouldings have little bunches of foliage carved at either end, a custom as common in France during the 15th century as it was in England a century earlier; the screen. beam at Eastbourne parish church, for example.

As a rule, cabinets of the 15th century were rectangular in plan. In Germany and Austria the lower part was often enclosed, as well as the upper; the top, middle and lower rails being carved with geometrical design or with bands of foliage (Museum, Vienna). But it was also the custom to make these cupboards with the corners cut off, thus giving five sides to the piece of furniture. A very pretty instance, which is greatly enhanced by the metal work of the lock plates and hinges, is in the Muse Cluny, and there are other good specimens with the lower part open in the Victoria and Albert Museum, [[London]].

The [[Chest (furniture)|chest]] was a very important piece of furniture, and is often to be met with covered with the most elaborate carving (Orleans Museum). There is a splendid chest (14th century) in the [[Musée de Cluny|Cluny Museum]]; the front is carved with twelve knights in armour standing under as many arches, and the spandrels are filled in with faces, dragons and so on. But it is to the 15th century that we look for the best work of this class; there is no finer example than that in the [[Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin]]. The front is a very animated hunting scene most decoratively arranged in a scheme of foliage, and the top bears two coats of arms with helms, crests and mantling. But the more general custom in chest decoration was to employ tracery with or without figure work; Avignon Museum contains some typical examples of the latter class.

A certain number of seats used for domestic purposes are of great interest. A good example of the long bench placed against the wall, with lofty panelled back and canopy over, is in the [[Musée Cluny]], Paris. In the Museum at [[Rouen]] is a long seat of a movable kind with a low panelled back of pierced tracery, and in the Dijon Museum there is a good example of the typical chair of the period, with arms and high panelled and traceried back. There was a style of design admirably suited to the decoration of furniture when made of softwood such as pine. It somewhat resembled the excellent Scandinavian treatment of the 10th-12th centuries already referred to. A pattern of Gothic foliage, often of beautiful outline, would be simply grounded out to a shallow depth. The shadows, curves and twists only being emphasized by a few well-disposed cuts with a [[V tool]]; and of course the whole effect greatly improved by colour. A Swiss door of the 15th century in the Berlin Museum, and some German, Swiss and Tirolese work in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], offer patterns that might well be imitated today by those who require simple decoration while avoiding the hackneyed Elizabethan forms.

It is hard to compare the figure work of England with that on the Continent owing to the disastrous effect of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. But when we examine the roofs of the Eastern counties, the bench ends of Somerset, or the misereres{{Clarify|date=February 2013|reason=Should this be misericord?}} in many parts of the country, we can appreciate how largely wood sculpture was used for purposes of decoration. If as a rule the figure work was I not of a very high order, we have conspicuous exceptions in the stall elbows of Sherborne, and the pulpit of Trull, Somerset. Perhaps the oldest instance is the often mutilated and often restored effigy of Robert, [[Duke of Normandy]], in [[Gloucester Cathedral]] (12th century), and carved, as was generally the case in England, in oak. At [[Clifton Reynes]], Buckingham, there are two figures of the 13th century. They are both hollowed out from the back in order to facilitate seasoning the wood and to prevent cracking. During the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries there are numberless instances of figure carving of the most graphic description afforded in the misereres{{Clarify|date=February 2013|reason=Should this be misericord?}} in many of our churches and cathedrals. But of figures carved in the round apart from their surroundings hardly an instance remains. At the little chapel of Cartmel Fell, in the wilds of Westmorland, there is a figure of Our Lord from a crucifix, some {{convert|2|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} in length. The cross is gone, the arms are broken away, and the feet have been burned off. A second figure of Our Lord (originally in the church of Keynes Inferior) is in the museum of Caerleon, and a third, from a church in Lincolnshire, is now in a private collection. On the continent some of the finest figure work is to be found in the retables, some of which are in the Victoria and Albert Museum. A Tirolese panel of the 15th century carved in high relief, representing St John seated with his back to the onlooker, is a masterpiece of perspective and foreshortening, and the drapery folds are perfect. The same may be said of a small statue of the Virgin, carved in lime by a Swiss hand, and some work of the great [[Tilman Riemenschneider]] of [[Würzburg|Wurzburg]] (1460–1531) shows that stone sculptors of medieval times were not ashamed of wood.

===Renaissance period (16th–17th centuries)===
With the beginning of the 16th century, the great [[Renaissance]] began to elbow its way in to the exclusion of Gothic design. But the process was not sudden, and much transition work has great merit. The rood screen at Hurst, [[Berkshire]], the stall work of [[Cartmel Priory]], Westmorland, and the bench ends of many of the churches in [[Somerset]], give good illustrations. But the new style was unequal to the old in devotional feeling, except in classic buildings like [[St Paul's Cathedral]], where the stalls of Grinling Gibbons better suit their own surroundings. The rest of this article will therefore be devoted in the main to domestic work, and the exact location of examples can only be given when not the property of private owners or where the public have access.

During the 16th century the best work is undoubtedly to be found on the Continent. [[France]], [[Germany]] and the Netherlands producing numberless examples not only of house decoration but of furniture as well. The wealth of the newly discovered [[Americas|American continent]] was only one factor which assisted in the civilizing influence of this time, and hand in hand with the spread of commerce came the desire for refinement. The custom of building houses chiefly in wood wherever timber was plentiful continued. [[Pilaster]]s took the place of pinnacles, and vases or dolphins assisted the acanthus leaf to oust the older forms of design. House fronts of wood gave ample scope to the carver. That of Sir Paul Pinder (1600), formerly in [[Bishopsgate]], but now preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum, is a good example of decorative treatment without overloading. The brackets carved in the shape of monsters which support the projecting upper storey are typical of hundreds of dwellings, as for instance St Peters Hospital, [[Bristol]]. The panels, too, of Sir Paul Pinders house are good examples of that [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] form of medallion surrounded by scroll work which is at once as decorative as it is simple.

In England that familiar style known as [[Elizabethan furniture|Elizabethan]] and Jacobean prevailed throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. At the present time hardly a home in the land has not its old oak chest carved with the familiar half circle or scroll border along the top rail, or the arch pattern on the panels. The [[court cupboard]]s, with their solid or open under parts and upper [[cornice]] supported by turned [[baluster]]s of extravagant thickness, are to be seen wherever one goes. And chairs, real as well as spurious, with solid backs carved in the usual flat relief, are bought up with an avidity inseparable from fashion. Four-post bedsteads are harder to come by. The back is usually broken up into small panels and carved, the best effect being seen in those examples where the paneling or the framework only is decorated. The dining-hall tables often had six legs of great substance, which were turned somewhat after the shape of a covered cup, and were carved with foliage bearing a distant resemblance to the acanthus. Rooms were generally panelled with oak, sometimes divided at intervals by flat pilasters and the upper frieze carved with scroll work or dolphins. But the feature which distinguished the period was the [[fire mantle]]. It always must be the principal object in a room, and the Elizabethan carver fully appreciated this fact. By carving the [[chimney breast]] as a rule to the ceiling and covering the surrounding walls with more or less plain paneling, the designer, by thus concentrating the attention on one point, often produced results of a high order. [[Caryatid]] figures, pilasters and [[frieze]]s were among the customary details employed to produce good effects. No finer example exists than that lately removed from the old palace at [[Bromley-by-Bow]] to the Victoria and Albert Museum. The mantelshelf is {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}}. from the ground and consists of a deep quadrant mould decorated with flat scroll work of good design. The supporting pilasters on either side are shaped and moulded in the customary Jacobean manner and are crowned by busts with Ionic capitals on the heads. Above the shelf the large center panel is deeply carved with the royal coat of arms with supporters and mantling, and on either side a semicircular arched niche contains a figure in classic dress. The [[Elizabethan]] carver often produced splendid staircases, sometimes carving the newel posts with heraldic figures bearing coats of arms, etc. The newels of a staircase at Highgate support different types of Cromwellian soldiers, carved with great vivacity and life. But in spite of excellent work, as for example the beautiful gallery at Hatfield, the carving of this period did not, so far as England was concerned, compare with other epochs, or with contemporary work in other parts of Europe. Much of the work is badly drawn and badly executed. It is true that good decorative effects were constantly obtained at the very minimum of cost, but it is difficult to discover much merit in work which really looks best when badly cut.

In France this flat and simple treatment was to a certain extent used. Doors were most suitably adorned in this way, and the split baluster so characteristic of Jacobean work is often to be met with. There are some very good cabinets in the museum at Lyngby, Denmark, illustrating these two methods of treatment in combination. But the Swiss and Austrians elaborated this style, greatly improving the effect by the addition of color. However, the best Continental designs adopted the typical acanthus foliage of Italy, while still retaining a certain amount of Gothic feeling in the strength of the lines and the cut of the detail. Panelling often long and narrow was commonly used for all sorts of domestic purposes, a feature being a medallion in the center with a simple arrangement of vase, dolphins, dragons, or birds and foliage filling in the spaces above and below.

The cabinets of the Netherlands and [[Belgium]] are excellent{{according to whom|date=October 2012}} models of design. These pieces of furniture were usually arranged in two storeys with a fine moulded and carved cornice, mid division and plinth. The pilasters at the sides, and small raised panels carved only on the projecting part, would compose a very harmonious whole. A proportion of the French cabinets are decorated with caryatids not carved in the best taste, and, like other French woodwork of this period, are sometimes overloaded with sculpture. The doors of St Maclou, Rouen, fine as they are, would hardly to-day be held up as models for imitation. A noteworthy set of doors belong to the [[Oudenaarde Town Hall]]. The central door contains twelve and that on either side eight panels, each of which is carved with Renaissance foliage surrounding an unobtrusive figure. In the [[Law Courts of Brussels|Palais de Justice]] we see that great scheme of decoration which takes up the whole of the fireplace end of the hall. Five large figures carved in the round are surrounded by small ones and with foliage and coats of arms.

In Italy, the birthplace of the Renaissance, there is much fine work of the 16th century. A very important school of design was promoted by [[Raphael]], whose patterns were used or adapted by a large number of craftsmen. The shutters of Raphaels Stanze in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]], and the choir stalls in the church of St Pietro de Cassinesi at Perugia, are among the most beautiful examples of this style of carving. The work is in slight relief, and carved in walnut with those graceful patterns which Raphael developed out of the newly discovered remains of ancient Roman wall painting from the palace of Nero and other places. In the Victoria and Albert Museum are many examples of Italian work: the door from a convent near Parma, with its three prominent masks and heavy gadroon moulds; a picture frame with a charming acanthus border and, egg and tongue moulds on either side; and various marriage chests in walnut covered with very elaborate schemes of carving. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish Spanish, or for that matter South of France work, from Italian, so much alike is the character. The Spaniards yield to none in good workmanship. Some Spanish panels of typical Italian design are in the Victoria and Albert Museum as well as cabinets of the purest Renaissance order. There is a wonderful Portuguese coffer (17th century) in this section. The top is deeply carved in little compartments with scenes from the life of Our Lord.

===17th–18th centuries===
In England, the great school of [[Grinling Gibbons]] arose. Although he carved many beautiful mouldings of conventional form ([[Hampton Court Palace]], Chatsworth, etc.), his name is usually associated with a very heavy form of decoration which was copied direct from nature. Great swags of drapery and foliage with fruit and dead birds, etc., would be carved in lime a foot thick. For technical skill these examples are unsurpassed; each grape would be undercut, the finer stalks and birds legs stand out quite separate, and as a consequence soon succumb to the energy of the housemaid's broom. Good work of this class is to be found at Petworth; [[Trinity College, Oxford]]; [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]; St Pauls cathedral; St James, Piccadilly; and many other London churches.

During the reigns of Louis XIV. and XV. the principal merit of carved design, i.e. its appropriateness and suitability, gradually disappeared. Furniture was often carved in a way hardly legitimate. The legs, the rails of tables and chairs, the frames of cabinets, of looking-glasses, instead of being first made fcr construction and strength. and then decorated, were first designed to carry cherubs heads and [[rococo]] (i.e. rock and shell ornament), quite regardless of utility or convenience. A wealth of such mistaken design was also applied to state carriages, to say nothing of bedsteads and other furniture. However, the wall paneling of the mansions of the rich, and sometimes the paneling of furniture, was decorated with rococo design in its least illegitimate form. The main part of the wood surface would be left plain, while the center would be carved with a medallion surrounded by foliage, vases or trophies of torches and musical instruments, etc., or perhaps the upper part of the panel would be thus treated. France led the fashion, which was more or less followed all over Europe. In England gilt chairs in the style of Louis XV. were made in some quantities. But [[Thomas Chippendale]], Ince and Mayhew, Sheraton, Johnson, Heppelwhite and other cabinet-makers did not as a rule use much carving in their designs. Scrolls, shells, ribbon, ears of corn, etc., in very fine relief, were, however, used in the embellishment of chairs, etc., and the claw and ball foot was employed as a termination to the cabriole legs of cabinets and other furniture.

The mantelpieces of the 18th century were, as a rule, carved in pine and painted white. Usually the shelves were narrow and supported by pilasters often of flat elliptic plan, sometimes by [[caryatid]]s, and the frieze would consist of a raised center panel carved with a classic scene in relief, or with a mask alone, and on either side a swag of flowers, fruit and foliage.
[[File:Apostels Groeden.jpg|thumb|Baroque woodcarved apostles from [[Val Gardena]]]]

Interior doorways were often decorated with a [[Pediment|broken pediment]] more or less ornate, and a swag of foliage commonly depended from either side over a background of scroll work. The outside porches so often seen in Queen Anne houses were of a character peculiar to the 18th century. A small platform or curved roof was supported by two large and heavy brackets carved with acanthus scroll work. The staircases were as a rule exceedingly good. Carved and pierced brackets were fixed to the open strings (i.e. the sides of the steps), giving a very pretty effect to the graceful balustrade of turned and twisted columns.

Renaissance figure work calls for little comment. During the 16th century many good examples were produced those priestly statues in the museum of Sens for example. But the figure work used in the decoration of cabinets, etc., seldom rose above the ordinary level. In the 18th century cherubs heads were fashionable and statuettes were sometimes carved in boxwood as ornaments, but as a means of decorating houses wood sculpture ceased to be. The Swiss, however, have kept up their reputation for animal sculpture to the present day, and still turn out cleverly carved chamois and bears, etc.; as a rule the more sketchily cut the better the merit. Their more ambitious works, their groups of cows, etc., sometimes reach a high level of excellence.

Between the 17th and 18th century a florid woodcarving industry started in the [[Val Gardena|Gardena]] valley, which is now located in the [[Italy|Italian]] province of [[South Tyrol]].  A network of people from that valley traveled on foot to all European cities, as far as to Lisbon and Saint Petersburg, to sell the products of hundreds of carvers. Finally in the 19th century in Gardena, mainly wooden toys and dolls known also as Dutch dolls or penny dolls, were carved by the millions of pieces. The  [[Museum Gherdëina]] in [[Urtijëi]] displays a large collection of examples of woodcarcarvings from that region.

[[Gilded woodcarving in Portugal]] and Spain continued to be produced, and the style exported to their New World colonies, and the [[Philippines]], [[Macao]] and [[Goa]].

=== 19th century to present day ===
Of the work of the 19th century onward little can be said in praise. Outside and beyond the present-day fashion for collecting old oak there seems to be no demand for carved decoration. In church work a certain number of carvers find occupation, as also for repairs or the production of imitations. But the carving one is accustomed to see in hotels or on board the modern ocean palace is in the main the work of the machine, often with finishing work done by human workers.

Nonetheless, the 1800s saw the teaching of woodcarving became formalized in several European countries. For example, the Austrian woodcarver [[Josef Moriggl]] (1841–1908) had a long career as a teacher, culminating in his appointment in 1893 as Professor at the Staats-Gewerbeschule (Craft School) in [[Innsbruck]], where he served until his retirement in 1907.

In [[Val Gardena|Gröden]] the institution of an art school in 1820 improved considerably the skills of the carvers. A new industrial branch developed with hundreds of artists and artisans dedicated to sculpture and manufacturing of statues and altars in wood exported to the whole world. Unfortunately the machine-carving industry, initiated in the 1950s and the [[Second Vatican Council]], caused hundreds of carvers in Val Gardena to quit their craft. A worldwide trade of machine-carved figuerines and statues ensued.

== Coptic ==
In the [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] period screens and other fittings were produced for the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] churches of Egypt by native Christian workmen. In the British Museum there is a set of ten small cedar panels from the church door of [[Sitt Miriam]], Cairo (13th century). The six sculptured figure panels are carved in very low relief and the four foliage panels are quite Oriental in character, intricate and fine both in detail and furnish. In the Cairo Museum there is much work treated, after the familiar Arab style, while other designs are quite [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] in character. The figure work is not of a very high order.

== Islamic work ==

[[File:Ahşapkapı.JPG|thumb|[[Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum]], [[İstanbul]]]]
[[Muslim]] wood-carvers of Persia, Syria, Egypt and Spain  are renowned for their skill, designed and executed the richest paneling and other decorations for wall linings, ceilings, pulpits and all kinds of fittings and furniture.{{According to whom|date=April 2012}} The mosques and private houses of Cairo, Damascus and other Oriental Cities are full of the most elaborate and minutely delicate woodwork. A favorite style of ornament was to cover the surface with very intricate interlacing patterns, formed by finely moulded ribs; the various geometrical spaces between the ribs were then filled in with small pieces of wood carved with foliage in slight relief. The use of different woods such as ebony or box, inlaid so as to emphasize the design, combined with the ingenious richness of the patterns, give this class of woodwork an almost unrivaled splendour of effect. Carved ivory is also often used for the filling in of the spaces. The Arabs are past masters in the art of carving flat surfaces in this way. A gate in the mosque of the sultan Bargoug (Cairo, 14th century) well illustrates this appreciation of lines and surfaces. The pulpit or mimbar (15th century) from a Cairo mosque, now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, is also a good example in the same style, the small spaces in this case being filled in with ivory carved in flat relief.

Screens made up of labyrinths of complicated joinery, consisting of multitudes of tiny balusters connecting hexagons, squares or other forms, with the flat surfaces constantly enriched with small carvings, are familiar to every one. In Cairo we also have examples in the mosque of Qous (12th century) of that finely arranged geometrical interlacing of curves with foliage terminations which distinguishes the Saracenic designer. Six panels in the Victoria and Albert Museum (13th century), and work on the tomb of the sultan Li Ghoury (16th century), show how deeply this form of decoration was ingrained in the Arab nature. Figure work and animals were sometimes introduced, in medieval fashion, as in the six panels just referred to, and at the hflpital du Moristan (13th century) and the mosque of El Nesfy Qeycoun (14th century). There is a magnificent panel on the door of Beyt-el-Emyr. This exquisite design is composed of vine leaves and, grapes of conventional treatment in low relief. The Arab designer was fond of breaking up his paneling in a way reminding one of a similar Jacobean custom. The main panel would be divided into a number of hexagonal, triangular or other shapes, and each small space filled in with conventional scroll work. Much of this simple flat design reminds one of that Byzantine method from which the Elizabethan carvers were inspired.

== Persia ==
The Persian carvers closely followed Arab design. A pair of doors of the 14th century from Samarkand (Victoria and Albert Museum) are typical. Boxes, spoons and other small articles were often fretted with interlacing lines of Saracenic character, the delicacy and minuteness of the work requiring the utmost patience and skill. Many of the patterns remind one, of the sandalwood work of Madras, with the difference that the Persians v~ere satisfied with a much lower relief. Sometimes a very beautiful result was obtained by the sparing tise of fretted lattice pattern among foliage. A fine panel of the 14th century in the Victoria and Albert Museum shows how active was Arab influence even as far as Bokhara.

== India and Burma ==
Throughout the great [[India|Indian peninsula]] woodcarving of the most luxurious kind has been continuously produced for many centuries. The ancient [[Hindu temple]]s were decorated with doors, ceilings and various fittings carved in teak and other woods with patterns of extreme richness and minute elaboration. The doors of the temple of Somnath, on the north-west coast, were famed for their magnificence and were highly valued as sacred relics. In 1024 they were taken to Ghazni by the Moslem conqueror, Sultan Mahmud, and are now lying at the fort at Agra. The gates which now exist are very fine specimens of ancient woodcarving, but are likely copies of the original, likely ancient, doors. Many doors, columns, galleries or even entire house-fronts are covered with the most intricate design bewildering to behold (Bhera, Shahpur). But this is not always the case, and the Oriental is at times more restrained in his methods. Architectural detail is to be seen with enrichment carved round the framing. Hindu treatment of the circle is often exceedingly good, and might perhaps less rarely inspire western design.  Foliage, fruit and flowers are constantly adapted to a scheme of fret-cut decoration for doors or windows as well as the frames of chairs and the edges of tables. Southern Indian wood carvers are known to work often with sandalwood, always covered with design, where scenes or characters from Hindu mythology occupy space. Many of the gong stands of Burma show the highest skill; the arrangement of two figures bearing a pole from which a gong hangs is familiar.

== Indochina and the Far East ==
[[File:Vietnamese wooden ceiling.jpg|thumb|upright|Details of a Vietnamese wooden ceiling]]
In these countries the carver is unrivaled for deftness of hand. {{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Grotesque and imitative work of the utmost perfection is produced, and many of the carvings of these countries, Japan in particular, are beautiful works of art, especially when the carver copies the lotus, lily or other aquatic plant. A favorite form of decoration consists of breaking up the architectural surfaces, such as ceilings, friezes, and columns, into framed squares and filling each panel with a circle, or diamond of conventional treatment with a spandrels in each corner. &lt;!-- image of door of Tai-h Hall, Pekin--&gt; A very Chinese feature is the finial of the newel post, so constantly left more or less straight in profile and deeply carved with monsters and scrolls. A heavily enriched moulding bearing a strong resemblance to the gadroon pattern is commonly used to give emphasis to edges, and the dragon arranged in curves imitative of nature is frequently employed over a closely designed and subordinated background.

[[File:Vietnamese column.JPG|thumb|left|Detail of a Vietnamese wooden column]]
The general rule that in every country designers use much the same means whereby a pattern is obtained holds good in China.{{Clarify|date=April 2012}} There are forms of band decoration here which closely resemble those of Gothic Europe, and a chair from Turkestan (3rd century) might almost be Elizabethan, so like are the details. Screens of grill form, often found in the historically Islamic countries, are common, and the deeply grounded, closely arranged patterns of Bombay also have their counterparts. The imperial dais in the Chien-Ching Hall, Pekin, is a masterpiece of intricate design. The back consists of one central panel of considerable height, with two of lesser degree on either side luxuriously carved. The whole is crowned with a very heavy crest of dragons and scroll work; the throne also is a wonderful example of carved treatment, and the doors of a cabinet in the same building show how rich an effect of foliage can be produced without the employment of stalk or scroll. One might almost say, he wastes his talent on such an ungrateful material as wood. In this material fans and other trifles are carved with a delicacy that courts disaster.

In Japan much of the Chinese type is apparent. The native carver is fond of massing foliage without the stalk to lead him. He appears to put in his foliage, fruit and flowers first and then to indicate a stalk here and there, thus reversing the order of the Western method. Such a treatment, especially when birds and beasts are introduced, has the highest decorative effect. But, as such close treatment is bound to do, it depends for success to some extent upon its scheme of color. A long panel in the Victoria and Albert Museum, depicting merchants with their packhorse, strongly resembles in its grouping and treatment Gothic work of the 15th century, as for example the panel of [[Hubertus|St Hubert]] in the museum at Chftlons. The strength and character of Japanese figure work is quite equal to the best Gothic sculpture of the 15th century.

== Aboriginal ==
{{further|Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas|Arts by region#Oceania}}
&lt;!--was called savage races, but that is POV from 11th britannica --&gt;
There is a general similarity running through the carved design of most races of [[primitive culture]],{{POV statement|date=May 2012}} the [[chip carving|chip form of ornament]]{{clarify|date=January 2012}} being almost universally employed. Decorated surfaces depending almost entirely upon the incised line also obtain all over the world, and may no doubt be accounted for by the extensive use of stone cutting tools. The carver shows the same tendency to over-exalt his art by [[horror vacui|crowding on too much design]] as the more civilized craftsman of other lands, while he also on occasion exercises a good deal of restraint by a harmonious balance of decoration and plain space. So far as his chip designs and those patterns more or less depending on the line are concerned, his work as a rule is good and suitable, but when he takes to figure work his attempts do not usually meet with success. Primitive carving, generally, shows that very similar stages of artistic development are passed through by men of every age and race.

A very favorite style of chip pattern is that formed by small triangles and squares entirely covering a surface in the [[Cook Islands]], the monotony being sometimes varied by a band of different arrangement in the middle of the article or at the top or bottom. So far as the cultivation of patience and accuracy is concerned, has no equal. The [[Fiji|Fiji Islanders]], employ chip designs rivaling those of [[Europe]] in variety. Upon occasion the aboriginal [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]] carver appreciates the way in which plain surfaces contrast and emphasize decorated parts, and judiciously restricts his skill to bands of decoration or to special points. The [[Ijaw people|Ijos]] of the lower [[Niger Delta|Niger]] design their paddles in a masterly way, and show a fine sense of proportion between the plain and the decorated surface. Their designs, though slightly in relief, are of the chip nature. The method of decorating a subject with groups of incised lines, straight or curved, though often very effective and in every way suitable, is not a very advanced form of art and has decided limits. The natives of the Congo, now two nations, covered by the landmass of the [[Republic of the Congo]] and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] does good work of this kind.

Carving in relief is common enough, idols being produced in many forms. The [[South African]] carves the handle of his spoon perhaps in the form of a [[giraffe]], and in the round, with each leg cut separately and the four hoofs meeting at the bowl, hardly a comfortable form of handle to hold. The [[Native Americans in the United States|North American Indian]] shows a wider invention than some nations, the twist in various shapes being a favorite treatment say of [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|pipe stems]]. The [[Papuan peoples|Papuan]] has quite a style of his own; he uses a scroll of the form familiar in Indian shawls, and in some cases the scroll entwines in a way which faintly suggests the [[Guilloché|guilloche]]. The [[Papuan people|native of New Guinea]] also employs the scroll for a motive, the flat treatment of which reminds one of a similar method in use in [[Scandinavia]]n countries. The work of the [[New Zealand]]er is greatly in advance of the average [[Primitive culture|primitive type]];{{POV statement|date=May 2012}} he uses a very good scheme of scroll work for decorative purposes, the lines of the scrolls often being enriched with a small pattern in a way reminding one of the familiar Norman treatment, as for example the prows of his canoes. The [[Māori people|Maori]] wood carver sometimes carves not only the barge boards of his house but the gables also, reptilian and grotesque figures being as a rule introduced; the main posts and rafters, too, of the inside receive attention. Unlike the [[Hindu]] he has a good idea of decorative proportion, and does not plan his scheme of design on too small a scale.

'''''In the Night Kitchen''''' is a popular and controversial children's [[picture book]], written and illustrated by [[Maurice Sendak]], and first published in 1970. The book depicts a young boy's dream journey through a [[surrealism|surreal]] baker's kitchen where he assists in the creation of a cake to be ready by the morning. ''In the Night Kitchen'' has been described by Sendak as part of a trilogy of books based on psychological development from ''In the Night Kitchen'' (toddler) to ''[[Where the Wild Things Are]]'' (pre-school) to ''[[Outside Over There]]'' (pre-adolescent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LLcBV9ghpuAC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;lpg=PA186 |title=Maurice Sendak's Trilogy: Disappointment, Fury, and Their Transformation through Art |journal=[[Psychoanalytic Study of the Child]] |first=Richard M. |last=Gottlieb |volume=63 |pages=186–217 |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-300-14099-6 |pmid=19449794}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[Caldecott Medal|Caldecott Honor]] recipient in 1971. It was adapted into a five-minute animated short film in 1987 by [[Gene Deitch]].

==Plot summary==
A young boy named Mickey sleeps in his [[bed]] when he is disturbed by noise on a lower floor. Suddenly, he begins to float, and loses all of his clothes as he drifts into a surreal world called the "Night Kitchen".

He falls naked into a giant mixing pot that contains the [[Batter (cooking)|batter]] for the "morning cake". While Mickey is buried in the mass, three identical bakers (who closely resemble [[Oliver Hardy]]) mix the batter and prepare it for baking, unaware (or unconcerned) that there is a little boy inside. Just before the baking pan is placed into the oven, the boy emerges from the pan, protesting that he is not the batter's milk.

To make up for the baking ingredient deficiency, Mickey (now covered in batter from the neck down) constructs an [[airplane]] out of [[bread]] [[dough]] so he can use the [[measuring cup]] as a [[hat]] and fly to the [[mouth]] of a gigantic [[milk]] [[bottle]]. Upon reaching the bottle's opening, he dives in and briefly revels in the [[liquid]]. After his covering of batter disintegrates, making him naked again, he pours the needed milk in a cascade down to the bakers who joyfully finish making their morning cake.

With dawn breaking, the naked Mickey crows like a [[rooster]] and slides down the side of the bottle, back into his bed, where he is magically clothed again, "cake free and dried". 
==Controversy==
When Mickey (who looks to be about three years old) enters the Night Kitchen, he loses his pajamas and is fully naked in some parts of the story. Critics object to Mickey's nudity which depicts not only his [[buttocks]], but also his genitals. Some also interpret sexual innuendo in the events, with the [[nudity]], free-flowing milky fluids, and a giant (allegedly [[Phallus|phallic]]) milk bottle.&lt;ref name="NNDB"&gt;{{cite web|last=NNDB|title=Maurice Sendak|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/275/000023206/}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the book proved controversial in the United States on its release and has continued to be so. The inclusion of child nudity has been frequently raised as morally problematic; consequently, this book remains on lists of books either challenged or banned.&lt;ref name="blisstree.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blisstree.com/live/the-15-most-controversial-picture-books-366/ |title=The 15 Most Controversial Picture Books |publisher=Blisstree.com |date=2008-08-18 |accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has been ranked 25th place on the "100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990-2000" list compiled by the [[American Library Association]].&lt;ref name="100most"&gt;{{cite web|last=American Library Association |title=The 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000 |url=http://www.ala.org/ala/issuesadvocacy/banned/frequentlychallenged/challengedbydecade/1990_2000.cfm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sC3hcGt2?url=http://www.ala.org/ala/issuesadvocacy/banned/frequentlychallenged/challengedbydecade/1990_2000.cfm |archivedate=2010-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artwork==
Sendak's illustrations here are rather different in style from ''[[Where the Wild Things Are]]'', his best known book, which makes much use of [[Hatching|cross hatching]] not found here. However, Sendak continues to utilize specific color tones and drawing a dream environment around a young child. Sendak's unique style captures the spirit and feeling of a dream, as Mickey floats, flies and dances from one panel to the next.

The book may be defined as a [[comics|comic story]], at least if one uses the definition of comics proposed in [[Scott McCloud]]'s acclaimed ''[[Understanding Comics]]'' — the storytelling is mainly pictorial (albeit clarified by captions) and the images mainly [[sequential art|sequential]], and [[speech balloons]] are used throughout the entire book.

In fact, the imagery is very similar to [[Winsor McCay]]'s [[Sunday page|Sunday comic strip]] series ''[[Little Nemo]]'' from the early 20th century. Maurice Sendak has cited these comics as influential in his work, and on page five of ''Night Kitchen'', one of the ingredients shown has a subtitle saying "Chicken Little, Nemo, mass", a nod to this influence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://springlakemccay.blogspot.com/2007/12/maurice-sendaks-homage.html Some examples of similarities between Little Nemo and Sendak's ''In the Night Kitchen''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview on [[NPR]]'s ''Fresh Air'', Sendak said that his depiction of the cooks in ''In the Night Kitchen'' (with their [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]-esque mustaches) and the fact that they tried to cook the boy in their ovens were references to [[the Holocaust]], a subject high in his thoughts especially due to his Jewish heritage. Sendak also said the story dealt with the things that happen after a child goes to bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gross|first1=Terry |title=Sendak on Adapting 'Brundibar' for Theater|url=https://www.npr.org/programs/fresh-air/2006/05/05/13001512/|website=npr|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kentucky Foundation for Women'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kfw.org KFW Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; promotes feminist art and [[social justice]] by awarding grants to individual artists and organizations, providing time and space for artists and activists at its retreat center, sharing information, and building alliances.

The Kentucky Foundation for Women is a 501(c)3 private, independent foundation that was established in 1985 by author [[Sallie Bingham]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salliebingham.com SallieBingham.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. At the time, Ms. Bingham's philanthropic gift of $10 million was the largest endowment to any women's fund in the United States. The mission of the Kentucky Foundation for Women is "to promote positive [[social change]] by supporting varied feminist expression in the arts."&lt;ref name="kfw.org"&gt;Kentucky Foundation for Women website http://www.kfw.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation funds two grant programs annually, they are ''Artist Enrichment'' and ''Arts Meets Activism''. Both grant programs are artist-centered, feminist in nature, and demonstrate high artistic quality. Applicants to both programs are expected to be able to express their commitment to [[feminism]] and their understanding of the relationship between art and social change.

Grant awards range from $1,000 to $7,500 per project. Social change, as defined by the foundation, includes "eliminating societal barriers to women: neutralizing discrimination against women based on age, ethnicity, [[sexual orientation]], physical ability, economic condition, and geographic origin; and producing actions, conditions, policies, attitudes, and behaviors that benefit women."&lt;ref&gt;"The Perfect Marriage" by Kopana Terry, ''Arts Across Kentucky Magazine'', Spring 2003, pages 55-57&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1985 and 2005 the Kentucky Foundation for Women awarded 1298 grants to individuals and organizations totaling $7,140,831.

[[Image:Hopscotch House.JPG|left]]'''Hopscotch House''' is a program of the Kentucky Foundation for Women; it is first and foremost an artist retreat center for feminist artists. It is also used by a variety of groups and organizations that are working to better the lives of women and girls in Kentucky.

Hopscotch House was purchased by the Kentucky Foundation for Women in 1987 and was first used by a group of [[Women\'s fiction|women writers]] known as the Wolf Pen Writer's Colony. In the early 1990s Hopscotch House became available to other [[women artists]] and women's groups. Over the years, Hopscotch House has served hundreds of women including artists, activists, feminists, eco-feminists, art critique groups, drumming circles, quilting groups, social justice groups, girls' empowerment groups, arts organizations, and [[Social work|social service]] organizations.

The property is considered a "classic" Kentucky farmstead and is located 13 miles east of [[downtown Louisville]]. The house has five bedrooms, six bathrooms, a library of women's literature and [[reference work]]s, a large living room/dining area, a sun room, and a deck. The large kitchen is fully furnished and well equipped so that residents can prepare their own meals. Separate studio space for artists is available upon request.&lt;ref name="kfw.org"/&gt;

==Other activities and support==

The Kentucky Foundation for Women has provided financial gifts for special projects such as the '''National Sculpture Conference: Works by Women''' held in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] in 1987. The conference honored American women sculptors ages 67–88. The honorees were: [[Selma Burke]], [[Elizabeth Catlett]], Clyde Connell, [[Dorothy Dehner]], Louise Bourgeois [https://www.pbs.org/art21/artists/bourgeois/index.html], [[Claire Falkenstein]], Sue Fuller, Louise Nevelson&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louisenevelsonfoundation.org/ Louise Nevelson Foundation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Claire Zeisler]].&lt;ref&gt;"Women Sculptors Have Their Say" by Elizabeth Bookser Barkley, ''Tristate Magazine, The Cincinnati Enquirer'', April 26, 1987, pages 3–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hot Flash Fan''', purchased by the foundation, was a collaborative project completed by more than 50 artists. "The project is a fan incorporating needlework, knotting, quilting, and painting in an expression of feelings associated with menopause."&lt;ref&gt;[http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~sch00326 Chicago, Judy, 1939- . Papers, 1947-2004 (inclusive), 1957-2004 (bulk): A Finding Aid&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Lead artists for the project were: [[Judy Chicago]], facilitator; [[Ann Stewart Anderson]], originator and principal coordinating artist; Ada O'Connor, principal embroidery artist/coordinator; Judith Myers, quilting coordinator. The Hot Flash Fan was on display at the [[Water tower|Water Tower]], home of the Louisville Visual [[Art association|Art Association]], before being added to the Foundation's permanent collection.

The Kentucky Foundation for Women published 50 issues of the [[Literary magazine|literary journal]] '''''The American Voice''''', which featured international and Kentucky writers. The editor of the Pan-American journal was Frederick Smock and was published trianually from 1986 to 1999. During that time ''The American Voice'' published two stories that were awarded the [[Pushcart Prize]] that honors the best poetry, [[Short story|short fiction]], and essays published in the small presses. It was a feminist publication that was known for featuring works by well-known authors such as [[Joyce Carol Oates]], [[Isabel Allende]], and [[Reynolds Price]] alongside Kentuckians [[Wendell Berry]], [[James Still]], and [[Sena Jeter Naslund]]. The journal also nurtured the work of less established, home-grown talent and published early work by the award-winning poet Aleda Shirley, novelist [[Barbara Kingsolver]], playwright [[Naomi Wallace]], and children's author George Ella Lyon.&lt;ref&gt;"Editor aims to bring Kentucky into the literary mainstream" by Ira Simmons, ''The Courier-Journal'', May 1, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sallie Bingham Award===
The '''Sallie Bingham Award''' was established in 1996 to recognize individuals and groups who have made outstanding contributions toward changing the lives of Kentucky women through feminist expression in the arts. Recipients are given a $500 cash award, a [[Gold plating|gold-plated]] Ginko pin and plaque. The award is announced at KFW Day, an annual celebration held each fall at Hopscotch House.

'''Kitsch''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɪ|tʃ}}; [[loanword]] from [[German language|German]]), also called '''cheesiness''' or '''tackiness''', is art or other objects that appeal to [[popular culture|popular]] rather than [[High culture|high art]] tastes. Such objects are sometimes appreciated in a knowingly [[ironic]] or humorous way.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=kitsch American Heritage Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/kitsch?a=british Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/kitsch Oxford Living Dictionaries]&lt;/ref&gt; The word was first applied to artwork that was a response to certain divisions of 19th-century art with [[aesthetics]] that favored what later art critics would consider to be exaggerated [[sentimentality]] and [[melodrama]]. Hence, 'kitsch art' is closely associated with 'sentimental art'. Kitsch is also related to the concept of [[camp (style)|camp]], because of its humorous and [[irony|ironic]] nature.

To brand visual art as "kitsch" is generally [[pejorative]], as it implies that the work in question is gaudy, or that it serves a solely ornamental and decorative purpose rather than amounting to a work of true artistic merit. The term is also sometimes applied to music or literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scruton|first1=Roger|authorlink1=Roger Scruton|date=Feb 21, 2014|title=A fine line between art and kitsch|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerscruton/2014/02/21/a-fine-line-between-art-and-kitsch/#7fbd667e3679|website=Forbes|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As a descriptive term, ''kitsch'' originated in the art markets of [[Munich#Capital of reunited Bavaria|Munich]] in the 1860s and the 1870s, describing cheap, popular, and marketable pictures and sketches.&lt;ref&gt;Calinescu, Matei. Five Faces of Modernity. Kitsch, p.&amp;nbsp;234.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Das Buch vom Kitsch'' (''The Book of Kitsch''), [[Hans Reimann (writer)|Hans Reimann]] defines it as a professional expression "born in a painter's studio".

The study of kitsch was done almost exclusively in German until the 1970s, with [[Walter Benjamin]] being an important scholar in the field.&lt;ref name="menninghaus"&gt;{{cite book|last=Menninghaus|first=Winfried|editor=Andrew Benjamin|others=Charles Rice|title=Walter Benjamin and the Architecture of Modernity| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFx1D_BC5tsC&amp;pg=PA40| year=2009| publisher=re.press| isbn=9780980544091| pages=39–58| chapter=On the Vital Significance of 'Kitsch': Walter Benjamin's Politics of 'Bad Taste'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modernism|Modernist]] writer [[Hermann Broch]] argues that the essence of kitsch is imitation: kitsch mimics its immediate predecessor with no regard to ethics—it aims to copy the beautiful, not the good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Broch|first=Hermann|title=Geist and Zeitgeist: The Spirit in an Unspiritual Age. Six Essays by Hermann Broch| year=2002| publisher=Counterpoint| isbn=9781582431680|chapter=Evil in the Value System of Art|pages=13–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Walter Benjamin, kitsch is, unlike art, a utilitarian object lacking all critical distance between object and observer; it "offers instantaneous emotional gratification without intellectual effort, without the requirement of distance, without sublimation".&lt;ref name="menninghaus"/&gt;

Kitsch is less about the thing observed than about the observer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eaglestone|first1=Robert|title=The Broken Voice: Reading Post-Holocaust Literature|date=May 25, 2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0191084204|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Roger Scruton]], "Kitsch is fake art, expressing fake emotions, whose purpose is to deceive the consumer into thinking he feels something deep and serious."&lt;ref name=Scruton&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-30439633 Scruton, Roger. "A Point of View: The strangely enduring power of kitsch", ''BBC News Magazine'', December 12, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomáš Kulka in ''Kitsch and Art'' starts from two basic facts that kitsch "has an undeniable mass-appeal" and "considered (by the art-educated elite) bad" and then proposes three essential conditions: 
# Kitsch depicts a beautiful or highly emotionally charged subject; 
# The depicted subject is instantly and effortlessly identifiable
# Kitsch does not substantially enrich our associations related to the depicted subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Kitsch and art|last=Tomas|first=Kulka|date=|publisher=Pennsylvania State Univ.

'''''Lapidarium''''', also known as '''''Skeletal Horses''''', is a traveling public sculpture exhibition by Mexican artist [[Gustavo Aceves]]. The installation, which addresses immigration, was installed in front of the [[Brandenburg Gate]] in [[Berlin]] during May 2–10, 2015 to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the end of [[World War II]] in Europe. It consists of 22 bronze and marble horse statues that are broken or cracked, and have a skeletal and unfinished appearance. Some pieces include human skulls within, representing immigrants who died during their journey. The work's title refers to [[lapidarium]]s, or sites where archeological findings are exhibited, creating "an association between the fragmented artworks and our shared history and past". After Berlin, the work will be installed with minor differences in other cities around the world until 2017.&lt;ref name=Neuendorf&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neuendorf|first1=Henri|title=Skeletal Horses by Gustavo Aceves Installed at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin|url=https://news.artnet.com/in-brief/gustavo-aceves-lapidarium-berlin-293453|publisher=[[Artnet]]|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Life in Malaysia}}
The making of Tamil films outside its motherland of [[Tamil Nadu]] is actively growing. With the [[Tamil diaspora]] worldwide, there are many enthusiastic filmmakers who want to make their mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/story/?file=/2011/4/16/nation/8492067&amp;sec=nation|title=Archives - The Star Online.|website=Thestar.com.my|accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thestar.com.my"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Lifestyle/Entertainment/Movies/News/2014/09/18/Beating-the-odds/|title=How the director of local Tamil film 'Maindhan' beat the odds  - News - The Star Online|website=Thestar.com.my|accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sashisez.blogspot.com/2012/06/local-tamil-moviestelemovies-why-i-dont.html|title=Gotta say something ...: Local Tamil movies - why I don't feel like watching?|date=18 June 2012|website=Sahisez.blogspot.com|accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tamil cinema in Malaysia started in 1968 after the movie ''Ratha Paei'', starring Kalaikkumar Chinnasamy, Susheela and [[Malaysia Vasudevan]]. It was shot in Golden Studio, [[Chennai]]. Centered in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Penang]] and [[Johor Bahru]], the industry remained relatively small with fewer than 50 films produced. The industry has slow growth and faces strong competition from Tamil films from [[Kollywood]].

'''Ned Kahn''' is an environmental artist and sculptor, famous in particular for museum exhibits he has built for the [[Exploratorium]] in [[San Francisco]].   His works usually involves capturing an invisible aspect of nature and making it visible; examples include building facades that move in waves in response to wind; indoor tornadoes and vortices made of fog, steam, or fire; a transparent sphere containing water and sand which, when spun, erodes a beach-like ripple pattern into the sand surface. In 2003 Kahn collaborated with [[Koning Eizenberg Architecture, Inc.]] on a piece for the [[Children's Museum of Pittsburgh]] consisting of hundreds of movable flaps that respond to the wind creating visible patterns.  Kahn  won a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Foundation]] "[[genius grant]]" fellowship in 2003, and the [[National Design Award]] for environmental design in 2005. His work is in the collection of di Rosa, Napa.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dirosaart.org/collection-in-focus-ned-kahn/&lt;/ref&gt;

Kahn lives and works in California.

The foundation regularly sponsors foreign and Nigerian scholars, curators, artists and art historians to interact with and utilize its art collection for their studies and researches, collaborate with Nigeria’s artists, curators, museums, galleries, other collectors and Nigerian art institutions,  for promoting Nigerian art and culture to the world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

It has as at end 2016, sponsored seventeen (17) fellows from the USA, Kenya, South Africa, Ghana, Germany, Switzerland and Austria. Some of the previous beneficiaries of the Oyasaf fellowship program are from the following institutions: [[University of Chicago]] (USA), [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]] (USA), [[Stanford University]] (USA), [[University of Vienna]] (Austria), [[Rhodes University]] (South Africa), Ziko Museum (South Africa), [[Columbia University]] (USA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenigerianvoice.com/news/58506/1/at-home-in-oyasafs-haven-of-arts.html|title=AT HOME IN OYASAF'S HAVEN OF ARTS|work=TheNigerianVoice.com|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vansa.co.za/Projects/western-cape/news/focus-on-nigeria-at-learn-africa-love-africa-art-talk|title=FOCUS ON NIGERIA AT LEARN AFRICA LOVE AFRICA ART TALK — VANSA|website=vansa.co.za|language=en|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art workshops and donations ==
Oyasaf has organized art workshops and collaborations with some tertiary institutions and other foundations, notably of which, are the [[University of Lagos]], Nigeria, the [[University of Port Harcourt]], Nigeria and the  UFUK Dialogue Foundation of Turkey.  It has also lent art works to local and international Museums (e.g. New York Museum of African Art, 2010-2013) and participated in different public lectures and presentations on art and culture globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://westernpostnigeria.com/ufuk-foundation-working-towards-peaceful-co-existence-among-nigerians/|title=UFUK Foundation…Working Towards Peaceful Co-existence among Nigerians|date=2015-03-16|work=Western Post News|access-date=2017-05-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thesoleadventurer.com/2017/03/22/announcement-skoto-gallery-presents-works-of-ladi-kwali-and-uche-okeke/|title=ANNOUNCEMENT {{!}} SKOTO GALLERY PRESENTS WORKS OF LADI KWALI AND UCHE OKEKE|website=The Sole Adventurer|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The foundation has donated some life size sculptural monuments to public places and institutions in Nigeria, notably among which, are the eighteen (18) life size sculptures at the Freedom Park in Lagos, Nigeria and monuments to the University of Lagos and University of Ibadan (both in Nigeria). It has also established an online journal of art, titled : "TOJA", which is published under the "Yemisi Shyllon Professorial Chair ", with the [[University of Port Harcourt]], Port Harcourt, Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tojaonline.org|title=The Oyasaf Journal of Art|website=www.tojaonline.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6859">&lt;!--- Don't mess with this line! ---&gt;The annual '''Portage Ceramic Awards''' is [[New Zealand's]] premier ceramics event. Established in 2001, the awards are funded by The Trusts Charitable Foundation and administered by [[Lopdell House#Lopdell House Society|Te Uru Waitakere Contemporary Gallery]] (formerly Lopdell House Gallery). A national award, the Portage Ceramics Awards also acknowledge [[Waitakere City]]’s long history of ceramic practice, dating back to 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Portage Ceramic Awards 2001|date=2001|publisher=Lopdell House Gallery|location=Waitakere City, Auckland, New Zealand|isbn=9780958228404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The competition==

Entry is available to artists of New Zealand citizenship.The annual awards are judged each year by a different international judge, usually from the field of ceramics. An open call is made for entries, and since the third award onwards the judge has selected a group of finalists for exhibition. An exhibition is held at Te Uru and a publication produced.

==Residencies==

In 2013 two international residencies were announced as part of the awards: the Guldagergaard residency in Skaelskor, [[Denmark]], awarded to [[Richard Stratton (artist)|Richard Stratton]] and a residency in Medalta, Medicine Hat, [[Canada]], awarded to Melissa Ford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portage Ceramic Awards|url=http://www.thebigidea.co.nz/news/industry-news/2013/oct/135466-portage-ceramic-awards|website=The Big Idea|accessdate=12 January 2015|date=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 a workshop scholarship to the Peters Valley School of Craft in [[New Jersey]] was awarded to Chris Weaver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Premier Portage Award 2014|url=http://www.thebigidea.co.nz/news/industry-news/2014/nov/152095-premier-portage-award-2014|website=The Big Idea|accessdate=12 January 2015|date=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ralaghan Man''' is an [[anthropomorphic]], carved wooden figure found in the bog of [[Ralaghan]], [[County Cavan]], Ireland, which dates back to the [[late bronze age]]. As of 2016, it was held in the collections of the [[National Museum of Ireland]].&lt;ref name="museum2016"&gt;{{cite web|publisher =National Museum of Ireland|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126064314/https://www.museum.ie/Archaeology/Exhibitions/Current-Exhibitions/Kingship-and-Sacrifice/New-Theory-of-Sacrifice | title = Kingship and Sacrifice - New Theory of Sacrifice |website=museum.ie| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160126064314/https://www.museum.ie/Archaeology/Exhibitions/Current-Exhibitions/Kingship-and-Sacrifice/New-Theory-of-Sacrifice | archivedate = 26 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Mahr]], keeper of Irish Antiquities in the National Museum in Dublin wrote in 1930; "''The figure was found, while cutting turf, under 3 to 4 feet of peat....It is made of yew, its height being 3 feet, 8 and five eighths inches''".&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Mahr | first = Adolf | year = 1930 | title = A wooden idol from Ireland | journal = Antiquity |volume=4 |page=487}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found in [[Ralaghan]] bog, which has since been drained, on a boundary. It is therefore currently regarded as a [[boundary marker]], though it has also been referred to as a [[votive offering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Sullivan|first1=Aidan|title=Exploring past people's interactions with wetland environments in Ireland.|url=https://www.academia.edu/448757/Exploring_Past_Peoples_Interactions_With_Wetland_Environments_In_Ireland|website=Academia.edu|publisher=ria.metapress.com|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Although covered in cracks, the figure has strongly incised facial features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coles|first1=Bryony|title=Anthropomorphic Wooden Figures from Britain and Ireland|journal=Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society|date=1990|volume=56|issue=2050-2729|pages=315--333|doi=10.1017/S0079497X0000517X|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0079497X0000517X|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The left eye is slightly higher than the right, with the nose off-centre and possible damage to the left of the face. The pubic area features a gouged out hole (initially reported as drilled)&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; with some theorising that the figure was female (drawing associations with other figurative female representations, such as stone [[sheela na gig]] carvings).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Freitag | first = Barbara  | title = Sheela-na-gigs: Unravelling an Enigma | publisher = Sutton | year = 2007 | isbn = 9780750945981 | page = 107 | quote = ''Mainly because there is not the slightest indication of breasts on any of them, some archaeologists are inclined to believe that the Ralaghan and Dagenham figures represent males, and that the hole was meant for the insertion of a now missing penis. Since the absence of breasts in female idols is familiar, such an interpretation does not naturally follow. Indeed, the stones inside the pubic hole of the Ralaghan idol and the oval shape of the hole in the Dagenham figure, strongly indicative of female representation - and ill-designed, according to Coles, to hold a penis - would tell us otherwise''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other theories identify the figure as male, suggesting that the hole may have been used to hold a 'carved phallus' (since lost).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Williams| first = Mark | title = Ireland's Immortals: A History of the Gods of Irish Myth |publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 2016 | isbn = 9780691157313 | page = 6 | quote = ''One [pomorphic wooden image] found in the bog of Ralaghan, Co. Cavan is roughly a metre long and made from a single round trunk of yew: it has a gouged hole in the genital area, which may once have held a carved phallus''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Ralaghan Man| url = http://agsmaoineamh.com/2014/06/24/ralaghan-man/ | website = agsmaoineamh.com | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140912222643/http://agsmaoineamh.com/2014/06/24/ralaghan-man/ | archivedate = 12 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11587">The '''Schoenflies''' (or '''Schönflies''') '''notation''', named after the [[Germans|German]] mathematician [[Arthur Moritz Schoenflies]], is one of two conventions commonly used to describe [[point group]]s. This notation is used in [[spectroscopy]]. The other convention is the [[Hermann–Mauguin notation]], also known as the international notation. A point group in the Schoenflies convention is completely adequate to describe the symmetry of a molecule; this is sufficient for spectroscopy. The Hermann–Mauguin notation is able to describe the [[space group]] of a crystal lattice, while the Schoenflies notation isn't. Thus the Hermann–Mauguin notation is used in [[crystallography]].

==Symmetry elements==
Symmetry elements are denoted by '''i''' for centers of inversion, '''C''' for proper rotation axes, '''σ''' for mirror planes, and '''S''' for improper rotation axes ([[rotation-reflection axes]]). '''C''' and '''S''' are usually followed by a subscript number (abstractly denoted '''n''') denoting the order of rotation possible.

By convention, the axis of proper rotation of greatest order is defined as the principal axis. All other symmetry elements are described in relation to it.  A vertical mirror plane (containing the principal axis) is denoted '''σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'''; a horizontal mirror plane (perpendicular to the principal axis) is denoted '''σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

==Point groups==
In three dimensions, there are an infinite number of point groups, but all of them can be classified by several families. 

*''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' (for [[cyclic group|cyclic]]) has an ''n''-fold rotation axis. 
:*''C&lt;sub&gt;nh&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' with the addition of a mirror (reflection) plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation (''horizontal plane''). 
:*''C&lt;sub&gt;nv&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' with the addition of ''n'' mirror planes containing the axis of rotation (''vertical planes''). 
*''S&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;'' (for ''Spiegel'', German for [[mirror]]) contains only a 2''n''-fold [[rotation-reflection axis]]. The index should be even because when ''n'' is odd an ''n''-fold rotation-reflection axis is equivalent to a combination of an ''n''-fold rotation axis and a perpendicular plane, hence ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''C&lt;sub&gt;nh&lt;/sub&gt;'' for odd ''n''.
*''C&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' has only a [[Improper rotation|rotoinversion axis]]. These symbols are redundant, because any rotoinversion axis can be expressed as rotation-reflection axis, hence for odd ''n'' ''C&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''S&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''C&lt;sub&gt;2ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''C&lt;sub&gt;nh&lt;/sub&gt;'', and for even ''n'' ''C&lt;sub&gt;2ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''S&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;''. Only ''C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is conventionally used, but in some texts you can see symbols like ''C&lt;sub&gt;3i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''C&lt;sub&gt;5i&lt;/sub&gt;''.
*''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' (for [[dihedral group|dihedral]], or two-sided) has an ''n''-fold rotation axis plus ''n'' twofold axes perpendicular to that axis. 
:*''D&lt;sub&gt;nh&lt;/sub&gt;'' has, in addition, a horizontal mirror plane and, as a consequence, also ''n'' vertical mirror planes each containing the ''n''-fold axis and one of the twofold axes.
:*''D&lt;sub&gt;nd&lt;/sub&gt;'' has, in addition to the elements of ''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''n'' vertical mirror planes which pass between twofold axes (''diagonal planes'').
* ''T'' (the chiral [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] group) has the rotation axes of a tetrahedron (three 2-fold axes and four 3-fold axes). 
:*''T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' includes diagonal mirror planes (each diagonal plane contains only one twofold axis and passes between two other twofold axes, as in ''D&lt;sub&gt;2d&lt;/sub&gt;''). This addition of diagonal planes results in three improper rotation operations '''S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'''.
:*''T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' includes three horizontal mirror planes. Each plane contains two twofold axes and is perpendicular to the third twofold axis, which results in inversion center '''i'''.
* ''O'' (the chiral [[octahedron|octahedral]] group) has the rotation axes of an octahedron or [[cube]] (three 4-fold axes, four 3-fold axes, and six diagonal 2-fold axes).
:*''O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' includes horizontal mirror planes and, as a consequence, vertical mirror planes. It contains also inversion center and improper rotation operations.
* ''I'' (the chiral [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] group) indicates that the group has the rotation axes of an icosahedron or [[dodecahedron]] (six 5-fold axes, ten 3-fold axes, and 15 2-fold axes).
:*''I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' includes horizontal mirror planes and contains also inversion center and improper rotation operations.
&lt;!-- I think, it shouldn't be here: 
It is important to note that the 'plane' in the definition of the rotation-reflection (alternating) axis of symmetry is '''not necessarily''' a mirror plane of the group in which the axis exists.  The ''S'' groups, for example, have no mirror planes. 
May be it should go to Improper rotation page? --&gt;
All groups that do not contain several higher-order axes (order 3 or more) can be arranged in a table, as shown below; symbols marked in red should not be used.

In crystallography, due to the [[crystallographic restriction theorem]], ''n'' is restricted to the values of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6. The noncrystallographic groups are shown with grayed backgrounds. ''D''&lt;sub&gt;4''d''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''D''&lt;sub&gt;6''d''&lt;/sub&gt; are also forbidden because they contain [[improper rotation]]s with ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;8 and 12 respectively. The 27 point groups in the table plus ''T'', ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''O'' and ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt; constitute 32 [[crystallographic point groups]].  

Groups with ''n = ∞'' are called limit groups or [[Curie group]]s. There are two more limit groups, not listed in the table: ''K'' (for ''Kugel'', German for ball, sphere), the group of all rotations in 3-dimensional space; and ''K&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'', the group of all rotations and reflections. In mathematics and theoretical physics they are known respectively as the ''[[special orthogonal group]]'' and the ''[[orthogonal group]]'' in three-dimensional space, with the symbols SO(3) and O(3).

== Space groups ==
The [[List of space groups#List|space groups]] with given point group are numbered  by 1, 2, 3, ...  (in the same order as their international number) and this number is added as a superscript to the Schönflies symbol for the corresponding point group. For example, groups numbers 3 to 5 whose point group is ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have Schönflies symbols ''C''{{sup sub|1|2}}, ''C''{{sup sub|2|2}}, ''C''{{sup sub|3|2}}. 

While in case of point groups, Schönflies symbol defines the symmetry elements of group unambiguously, the additional superscript for space group doesn't have any information about translational symmetry of space group (lattice centering, translational components of axes and planes), hence one needs to refer to special tables, containing information about correspondence between Schönflies and [[Hermann–Mauguin notation]]. Such table is given in [[List of space groups]] page.

A '''service record''' is a collection of either electronic or printed material which provides a [[documentary evidence|documentary]] [[history]] of a person's activities and accomplishments while serving as a member of a given [[organization]].  Service records are most often associated with the [[military]], but are commonly found in other groups, such as large [[corporations]] or for use by [[employee]]s of a civilian [[government]].

==Australian armed forces==
Service records for the [[Australian Army]], are available at the National Archives of Australia website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/explore/defence/service-records/index.aspx National Archives of Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/explore/defence/service-records/army-boer.aspx Boer War records&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/explore/defence/service-records/army-wwi.aspx First World War records&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/explore/defence/service-records/army-between.aspx inter-World War records&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/explore/defence/service-records/army-wwii.aspx Second World War records&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/explore/defence/service-records/army-after.aspx Post–Second World War records&lt;/ref&gt; The service records of the Royal Australian Navy and Royal Australian Air Force are also available.

World War I service records provide the dates when the person was "in the field", that is with his unit on active service, if and when they embarked for oversea service, and the names of the units in which the person served. The service record also documents other changes—promotions, transfers, time at base, the date and place of sickness or wounding, and the names of hospital or clearing station where the person was treated.

==Nazi Germany==
The records of [[Nazi Germany]] are extensive and the record keeping ability of the [[Nazi Party]] was generally considered to be extremely meticulous.  Service records of Nazi organizations are maintained at the [[Berlin Document Center]], in [[Berlin, Germany]], with several [[microfiche]] copies of these records available at the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] in [[College Park, Maryland]].

Records of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'', that is the regular armed forces of Germany during [[World War II]], are maintained at the ''[[Bundesarchiv]]'', also in [[Berlin]].

==United States armed forces==
{{main|Military personnel file (United States)}}
Service records of the [[United States armed forces]] are considered vital documents both for historical reasons and also to help secure [[veteran]] benefits for discharged or retired service members.  In addition, service records of the U.S. military provide a chronology of a service member's career and thus ensure accurate tracking of accomplishments, activities, and promotions.

Active duty U.S. military service records are maintained by the various branches of the U.S. armed forces.  Retired and discharged service records are maintained at the [[Military Personnel Records Center]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].

After 2005, most U.S. military service records are retained by the military branch since most such records are electronically stored.

'''''Solovey iz sela Marshyntsi''''' ({{lang-uk|Соловейко із села Маршинці}}, ''Соловейко з Буковини'') is a 1966 short film. It was the first studio filmed movie starring [[Sofia Rotaru]].

Rotaru was 19 when she starred in the film as a performer of Ukrainian and Moldavian folk songs. The setting is the premises of the Chernivsti Philharmonic Society. The name of the film was ultimately adopted as Rotaru's nickname in Soviet Union media reports of her career in the 1970s.

The singer appears in the titles with her Ukrainified (first version) last name - Rotar' (Rotaru in Moldavian).

The '''Star Awards''' ([[Simplified Chinese|Chinese]]: 红星大奖) is an annual ceremony held in Singapore where the media organisation [[Mediacorp]] recognises entertainers under their employment for outstanding performances of the year.

==History==
The first ever annual Star Awards event was held in 1994. In the first three years of the Awards, MediaCorp handed out just 10 Most Popular Artistes awards (five for each gender) instead of the current 20 (10 for each gender).&lt;ref name=stdyk&gt;{{cite news | title = Things you didn't know about the Star Awards | publisher = [[The Straits Times]] | date = 2006-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Best Actor and Best Actress awards were only introduced in 1995. Prior to that, it was more of a popularity contest, with [[Li Nanxing]], [[Chew Chor Meng]] and Zoe Tay winning the Most Popular Actor and Actress award.&lt;ref name=stdyk /&gt;

In 1995, a top gun of Hong Kong's TVB was one of the guests at the Star Awards. When giving out the award, he commented on the significance of the awards in recognizing television talents. He wished that Hong Kong will have similar television award ceremony in future. In less than 2 years after his return to Hong Kong, the [[TVB Anniversary Awards]] was born.

The Star Awards has traditionally been held at the TV Theatre on Caldecott Hill. Though there were some exceptions, the first being in 1996 where this annual event was being held at Harbour Pavilion, and 2006, when it was held at [[St James Power Station]].&lt;ref name=stdyk /&gt;

Previously, technical category awards (e.g. Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Variety Show Producer, etc.), newscaster and current affairs awards and, for a time, the Young Talent Award (for child actors) were held separately at a gala dinner due to time constraints and results and clips from the event would be shown at the ceremony. From 2010 to 2015, all awards were presented at the ceremony proper and the awards ceremony had been split into two shows. For Show 1, it was held at Caldecott Broadcast Centre throughout the above-mentioned period. For Show 2, it was held at [[Resorts World Sentosa]] in 2010 and 2011, at [[Marina Bay Sands]] in 2012 and 2013, at [[Suntec City]] in 2014 and at Caldecott Broadcast Centre in 2015.

In 2016, technical category awards were reverted to being presented at an off-site ceremony. Despite this, there still were two shows, where the programme and performance category awards were split equally. Both shows were held at the new Mediacorp campus at 1 Stars Avenue.

In 2017, a new format is introduced, whereby there is only one main show and three one-hour prelude episodes leading to it. Technical category awards (and Young Talent Award) are split equally among the three prelude episodes to be presented.

The award ceremonies were held in end of the year from 1998 to 2007. From 2009 onwards, the Star Awards would be held annually in April to honour television talents from works from the previous year. Hence, there was no ceremony in the year 2008.

With the merger of [[MediaCorp]] with [[SPH MediaWorks]] on 1 January 2005, nominees now include artistes and shows from [[MediaCorp Channel U]], formerly MediaWork's [[SPH MediaWorks Channel U|Chinese language channel]]. The ceremony was broadcast on Channel U in 2005 for the first time.

==Trophy==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Lolmcs.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The current Star Awards trophy, which was first designed in Year 2000.]] --&gt;
The Star Awards trophy has seen four different designs, since its inception in 1994.
* 1994: The trophy was a circular column with a star-shaped circle capping the top.
* 1995 - 1997: The trophy was a straight column topped with a gold star.
* 1998 - 1999: The trophy was changed to a cone-like shape with a bigger star.
* 2000–present: A new trophy made in Shanghai was designed, weighing 4&amp;nbsp;kg and cost S$1,000 each. It is designed with a crystal body shaped in the letter "S", and from another angle, shaped in the letter "A", forming the initials of the "Star Awards". The trophy used to come in different colors every year.

'''Street art''' is [[visual art]] created in public locations, usually unsanctioned artwork executed outside of the context of traditional art vans. Other terms for this type of art include "independent public art", "post-graffiti", and "neon-graffiti", and is closely related with [[urban outfiters]] and [[guerrilla art]].&lt;ref&gt;"Neo-graffiti" is a term coined by ''Tokion Magazine'' in the title of its Neo-Graffiti Project 2000, which featured "classic" subway surfers  graffiti artists working in new media; others have called this phenomenon "urban art." A discussion by the [[Wooster Collective]] on terminology can be found at [http://www.woostercollective.com/2004/01/what_the_hell_should_we_call_i.html WoosterCollective.com.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rafael"&gt;[http://www.lataco.com/interview-rafael-schacter-author-amazing-new-book-world-atlas-street-art-graffiti/ http://www.lataco.com] Interview with Rafael Schacter, Author of ''The World Atlas of Street Art and Graffiti'' ("...I prefer to use the term Independent Public Art...").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/books/review/city-as-canvas-and-the-world-atlas-of-street-art-and-graffiti.html https://www.nytimes.com] Aerosol Art ("...in favor of the catchall 'Independent Public Art'").&lt;/ref&gt; Common forms and media include [[aerosol paint|spray paint]] [[graffiti]], [[stencil graffiti]], [[flyposting|wheatpasted poster art]], [[sticker art]], [[street installation]]s, and [[sculpture]]. [[video design|Video projection]] and [[yarn bombing]] have also gained some popularity near the turn of the 21st century.

Street art is a form of artwork that is displayed in a community on its surrounding buildings, streets, trains, and other publicly viewed surfaces. Many instances come in the form of guerrilla art, which is composed to make a public statement about the society that the artist lives within. The work has moved from the beginnings of graffiti and vandalism to new modes where artists work to bring messages, or just simple beauty, to an audience.&lt;ref name=Antonova2014&gt;Antonova, Maria. 2014. "Street Art." Russian Life 57(5):17&lt;/ref&gt;

Some artists use "smart vandalism" as a way to raise awareness of social and political issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Student art project is vandalism for a cause |url=http://www.whas11.com/news/local/Student-art-project-is-vandalism-for-a-cause-86760522.html |work=The Herald-Times |accessdate=4 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320000018/http://www.whas11.com/news/local/Student-art-project-is-vandalism-for-a-cause-86760522.html |archivedate=20 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others simply see urban space as an untapped format for personal artwork, while others may appreciate the challenges and risks that are associated with installing illicit artwork in public places. A common motive is that creating art in a format which utilizes public space allows artists who may otherwise feel disenfranchised to reach a much broader audience than other styles or galleries would allow.

Whereas traditional [[graffiti]] artists have primarily used [[aerosol paint|spray paint]] to produce their work, "street art" encompasses many other media, such as [[LED art]], [[mosaic]] tiling, [[stencil graffiti|stencil art]], [[sticker art]], [[reverse graffiti]], [[Lock On (street art)|"Lock On" sculptures]], [[street installations]], [[wheatpaste|wheatpasting]], [[woodblock graffiti|woodblocking]], [[yarn bombing]], and [[rock balancing]].&lt;ref&gt;For the development of style in the aerosol paint medium, as well as an examination of the political, cultural, and social commentary of its artists, see the anthropological history of New York subway graffiti art, ''Getting Up: Subway Graffiti in New York'', by Craig Castleman, a student of [[Margaret Mead]], The MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; New media forms such as projection onto large city buildings are an increasingly popular tool for street artists—and the availability of cheap hardware and software allows street artists to become more competitive with corporate advertisements. Much like open source software, artists are able to create art for the public realm from their personal computers, similarly creating things for free which compete with companies making things for profit.&lt;ref&gt;Geek Graffiti: A Study in Computation, Gesture and Graffiti Analysis&lt;/ref&gt;

Some observers use the term "independent public art" to describe a type of street art, which can also include work in remote places that may not be visited by an audience, and may also be short-lived. An ephemeral instance of colored smoke in the forest, or a precarious [[Rock balancing|rock balance]] are examples.&lt;ref name="Rafael"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Filippo"&gt;[http://www.filippominelli.com/project/silence-shapes/ http://www.filippominelli.com] Filippo Minelli "''Silence/Shapes''."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Schacter, author of "''The World Atlas of Street Art and Graffiti''", September, 2013; {{ISBN|9780300199420}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklynstreetart.com/theblog/2014/02/13/rafael-schacter-and-his-world-atlas-of-street-art-and-graffiti/ http://www.brooklynstreetart.com] Rafael Schacter and His "World Atlas of Street Art and Graffiti."&lt;/ref&gt; Some work has been installed underwater.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bANKhbe1Vg8 https://www.youtube] Gravity Glue 2015; (Underwater [[Rock balancing|Rock balance]] at 3:55).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
Slogans of protest and political or social commentary graffitied onto public walls are the precursor to modern graffiti and street art, and continue as one aspect of the genre. Street art in the form of text or simple iconic graphics in the vein of corporate icons become well-known yet enigmatic symbols of an area or an era.&lt;ref name="Village Voice Mott"/&gt; Some credit the ''[[Kilroy Was Here]]'' graffiti of the World War II era as one such early example; a simple line-drawing of a long-nosed man peering from behind a ledge. Author [[Charles Panati]] indirectly touched upon the general appeal of street art in his description of the "Kilroy" graffiti as "outrageous not for what it said, but where it turned up".&lt;ref name="Kilroy"/&gt; Much of what can now be defined as modern street art has well-documented origins dating from [[New York City]]'s [[Graffiti in the United States|graffiti boom]], with its infancy in the 1960s, maturation in the 1970s, and peaking with the spray-painted full-car subway train murals of the 1980s centered in the [[Bronx]].

As the 1980s progressed, a shift occurred from text-based works of early in the decade to visually conceptual street art such as [[Richard Hambleton|Hambleton]]'s shadow figures.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, David (1990) ''Soho Walls&amp;nbsp;– Beyond Graffiti'', Thames &amp; Hudson, NY, {{ISBN|978-0-500-27602-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period coincides with [[Keith Haring]]'s subway advertisement subversions and [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]]'s [[SAMO]] tags. What is now recognized as "street art" had yet to become a realistic career consideration, and offshoots such as [[stencil graffiti]] were in their infancy. [[Flyposting|Wheatpasted]] poster art used to promote bands and the clubs where they performed evolved into actual artwork or copy-art and became a common sight during the 1980s in cities worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}
The group working collectively as [[AVANT]] were also active in New York during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Katherine | last=Drasher | title=Avant's on the Street | date=1983-06-30 | work =The Villager | url =http://avant-streetart.com/avant_street_art_press_nyc_80s.htm | pages =31–32 | accessdate = 2009-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Punk rock music's subversive ideologies were also instrumental to street art's evolution as an art form during the 1980s.  Some of the anti-museum mentality can be attributed to the ideology of [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|Marinetti]] who in 1909 wrote the "[[Manifesto of Futurism]]" with a quote that reads, "''we will destroy all the museums''."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zox-Weaver|first=Annalisa|date=June 1, 2015|title=Institutional Guerilla Art Open Access: The Public Sculpture of Florentijn Hofman|url=|journal=Sculpture Review|volume=3|issue=p 22-26|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many street artists claim we do not live in a museum so art should be in public places with no tickets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Early iconic works===
[[File:Houston Street at the Bowery 2008.jpg|thumb|The 2010 recreation of [[Keith Haring]]'s original 1982 mural; New York City's [[Bowery Mural]] wall at [[Houston Street]] and the [[Bowery]]]]
The northwest wall of the intersection at [[Houston Street]] and the [[Bowery]] in New York City has been a target of artists since the 1970s. The site, now sometimes referred to as the [[Bowery Mural]], originated as a derelict wall which graffiti artists used freely. [[Keith Haring]] once commandeered the wall for his own use in 1982. After Haring, a stream of well-known street artists followed, until the wall had gradually taken on prestigious status. By 2008, the wall became privately managed and made available to artists by commission or invitation only.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

A series of murals by [[René Moncada]] began appearing on the streets of [[SoHo]] in the late 1970s emblazoned with the words ''[[I AM THE BEST ARTIST Rene|I AM THE BEST ARTIST]]''.

Some street artists have earned international attention for their work and have made a full transition from street art into the mainstream art world&amp;nbsp;— some while continuing to produce art on the streets. [[Keith Haring]] was among the earliest wave of street artists in the 1980s to do so. Traditional graffiti and street art motifs have also increasingly been incorporated into mainstream advertising, with many instances of artists contracted to work as graphic designers for corporations. Graffiti artist [[Eric Haze|Haze]] has provided font and graphic designs for music acts such as the [[Beastie Boys]] and [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]. [[Shepard Fairey]]'s street posters of then-presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] were reworked by special commission for use in the presidential campaign. A version of the artwork also appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine. It is also not uncommon for street artists to start their own merchandising lines.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Street art has become more accepted by the general public, likely due to its artistic recognition and the high-profile status of [[Banksy]] and other artists. This has led street art to become one of the 'sights to see' in many European cities. Some artists now provide tours of local street art and are able to share their knowledge, explaining the ideas behind many works, the reasons for tagging and the messages portrayed in a lot of graffiti work. 
Berlin, London, Paris, Hamburg and other cities all have popular street art tours running all year round. In London alone there are supposedly ten different graffiti tours available for tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Incredible street art tours | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/picturegalleries/9880046/Incredible-street-art-tours.html | accessdate = 2015-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these organisations, such as Alternative London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Means|first1=Gary|title=Alternative London Street Art Guides|url=http://www.alternativeldn.com/best_london_tours/london_street_art_tour_guides.php|website=alternativeldn.com|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ParisStreetArt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paris Underground|url=http://undergroundparis.org/street-art-tours-paris|website=undergroundparis.org|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; AlternativeBerlin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternative Berlin|url=http://alternativeberlin.com/about|website=alternativeberlin.com|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; pride themselves on working with local artists, so visitors can get an authentic experience and not just a rehearsed script.

Many of these guides are painters, fine-art graduates and other creative professionals that have found the medium of street art as a way to exhibit their work. With this commercial angle they are able to let people in to the world of street art and give them more of an understanding of where it comes from. It has been argued that this growing popularity of steet art has made it a factor in [[gentrification]].&lt;ref&gt;Bross, F. (2017): [https://www.academia.edu/33405765/Beer_Prices_Correlate_with_the_Quality_of_Illegal_Urban_Art._A_Case_Study_on_the_Relationship_Between_Street_Art_and_Gentrification_in_a_Berlin_Neighborhood Beer Prices Correlate with the Quality of Illegal Urban Art.

=== Legality and ethics ===
Street art can have its own set of legal issues. The parties involved can include the artist, the city or municipal government, the intended recipient, and the owner of the structure or the medium where the work was displayed. One example is a case in 2014 in Bristol England, which exhibits the legal, moral, and ethical questions that can result. The ''Mobile Lovers'' by [[Banksy]] was painted on plywood on a public doorway, then cut out by a citizen who in turn was going to sell the piece to garner funds for a Boys Club. The City government in turn confiscated the artwork and placed it in a museum. Banksy, hearing of the conundrum then bequeathed it to the original citizen, thinking his intentions were genuine. In this case, as in others, the controversy of ownership and public property, as well as the issues of trespassing and vandalism are issues to be resolved legally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salib|first=Peter|date=Fall 2015|title=The Law of Banksy: Who Owns Street Art?|url=|journal=University of Chicago Review|volume=  82|issue= 4 p293|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Street art, guerilla art, and graffiti==
Graffiti is characteristically made up of written words that are meant to represent a group or community in a covert way and in plain sight. The tell tale sign of street art is that it usually includes images, illustrations, or symbols that are meant to convey a message.&lt;ref name="Bloch2015"&gt;Bloch, Stefano. 2015. "Street Art, Public City: Law, Crime and the Urban Imagination." Urban Studies (Sage Publications, Ltd.) 52(13):2500-2503.&lt;/ref&gt; While both works are meant to represent or tell a message to viewers, one difference between the two comes in the specific viewers that it is meant for. One trait of street art that has helped to bring it to positive light in the public eye is that the messages shown in these public spaces are usually made to be understandable to all.&lt;ref name=Bloch2015/&gt;

While both of these types of art have many differences, there are more similarities than their origins. Both graffiti and street art are works of art that are created with the same intent. Most artists, whether they are working anonymously, creating an intentionally incomprehensible message, or fighting for some greater cause are working with the same ambitions for popularity, recognition, and the public display or outpouring of their personal thoughts, feelings, and/or passions.&lt;ref name=Bloch2015/&gt;

The term street art is described in many different ways, one of which is the term "guerrilla art." Both terms describe these public works that are placed with meaning and intent. They can be done anonymously for works that are created to confront taboo public issues that will result in backlash, or under the name of a well-known artist. With any terminology, these works of art are created as a primary way to express the artist's thoughts on many topics and public issues.&lt;ref name=Campos2015&gt;Campos, Ricardo. 2015. "Youth, Graffiti, and the Aestheticization of Transgression." Social Analysis 59(3):17-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

One defining trait or feature of street art is that it is created on or in a public area without or against the permission of the owner.&lt;ref name=Bacharach2015/&gt; This is a trait which falls in line with that of graffiti. A main distinction between the two comes in the second trait of street art or guerrilla art, where it is made to represent and display a purposefully uncompliant act that is meant to challenge its surrounding environment.&lt;ref name=Bacharach2015/&gt; This challenge can be granular, focusing on issues within the community or broadly sweeping, addressing global issues on a public stage.

This is how the term "guerilla art" was associated with this type of work and behavior. The word ties back to guerilla warfare in history where attacks are made wildly, without control, and with no rules of engagement. This type of warfare was dramatically different than the previously formal and traditional fighting that went on in wars normally. When used in the context of street art, the term guerilla art is meant to give nod to the artist's uncontrolled, unexpected, and often unnamed attack on societal structure or norms.&lt;ref name="Sisko2015"/&gt;

=== Guerilla sculpture ===

[[File:Rubber Duck in Los Angeles.JPG|thumb|''Rubber Duck'' by Florentijn Hofman]]

Guerilla sculpture is the placement of sculptures in street settings without official approval; it developed from street art in England in the late 20th century.&lt;ref name=Sisko2015/&gt;  In addition to the nontraditional setting of the works of art involved, there are also many different techniques used in the creation of this art work. The artists tend to work illegally and in secrecy to create and place these works in the dark of night, cloaked in mystery regarding their origins and creators. The sculptures are used to express the artist's views and to reach an audience that would not otherwise be reached through more traditional methods of displaying one's work to the public. In performing these acts of artistic expression, they are not working to gain acceptance or love of the people that they reach, but at times may even anger those who view their work.&lt;ref name=Sisko2015/&gt;

An example is the overnight appearance of an unsanctioned sculpture of [[Edward Snowden]] onto a column in [[Fort Greene Park]] in New York City.&lt;ref name="Sisko2015"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sisko|first=|date=Summer 2015|title=Guerilla Sculpture: Free Speech and Dissent|url=|journal=Sculpture Review|volume= 64|issue= 2|pages=26–35|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other cases the sculptures integrate two-dimensional backdrops with a three-dimensional component, such as one by Banksy titled ''Spy Booth'' (2014).  The backdrop was painted on a wall in Cheltenham, England and featured [[Cold War|Cold-War]] spy characters adorned in trench coats and fedoras, with spy accoutrements, microphones, and reel-to-reel tape decks.  These characters appeared to be [[phone tap|tapping into]] a broken telephone booth.&lt;ref name="Sisko2015"/&gt;

A deviation from unsanctioned street sculpture is "institutionalized guerilla sculpture", which is sanctioned by civic authorities and can be commercialized. One such artist from the Netherlands is [[Florentijn Hofman]], who in 2007 created ''[[Rubber Duck (sculpture)|Rubber Duck]]'', a colossal rendition of the childhood tub-toy. The [[Guardians of Time (art)|Guardians of Time]] guerrilla dOCUMENTA are social sculptures by [[Manfred Kielnhofer]].

==Public acceptance==
[[File:27 club Graffiti in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|[[27 Club Graffiti in Tel Aviv]] blurs the lines between public art and graffiti]]Although this type of art has become a staple of most cities around the world, the popularity of this form of artistic expression was not always so apparent as it is today. In recent years, street art has undergone a major transformation in public opinion to even become a socially accepted and respected accent to the public places that they adorn.&lt;ref name=Bacharach2015&gt;Bacharach, Sondra. 2015. "Street Art and Consent." British Journal of Aesthetics 55(4):481-495&lt;/ref&gt;  Even with this push for public acceptance, the act of defacing public property with any and all message, whether it is considered art or not, has yet to become permitted or approved by the government.&lt;ref name=Bacharach2015/&gt;  Today's street art, while common and growing in acceptance, is largely placed in a middle ground between an act that is against the law and a beautifully respected act of artistic expression.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In the beginning, graffiti was the only form of street art that there was and it was widely considered to be a delinquent act of territorial marking and crude messaging. Initially, there was very clear divisions between the work of a street artist and the act of tagging a public or private property, but in recent years where the artists are treading the line between the two, this line has become increasingly blurred.&lt;ref name=Bacharach2015 /&gt;  Those who truly appreciate the work of famed street artists or street works of art, are in acceptance of the fact that this art would not be the same without the medium being the street. The works are subject to whatever change or destruction may come due to the fact that they are created on public or private surfaces which are neither owned by the artist or permitted to be worked on by the property owners. This acceptance of the potential impermanence of the works of art and the public placement of the uncondoned works are what contribute to the meaning of the piece and therefore, what helps the growth of street art popularity.&lt;ref name=Bacharach2015/&gt;

== Free art movement ==

The '''free art movement''' is the practice of artists leaving art in public places as street art, as well as being free for the public to remove and keep. The artwork is usually tagged with a notice stating it is free art, and either with the artist's name or left anonymously. The movement was reinvigorated by British artist [[My Dog Sighs]] coining the term "Free Art Fridays" and actively participating in the movement, which has since spread internationally.&lt;ref&gt;Johnathen Duran, [https://mic.com/articles/30569/free-art-friday-a-global-art-movement-everyone-can-appreciate Free Art Friday: A Global Art Movement Everyone Can Appreciate] mic.com, March 21, 2013 [retrieved 3 Dec 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Clues to the location of artworks are sometimes left on [[social media]] to combine [[Treasure hunt (game)|treasure hunting]] with art.&lt;ref&gt;Holly Roberts, [http://www.redandblack.com/culture/month-long-art-scavenger-hunt-free-art-movement-comes-to/article_1752f2b2-fc2b-11e5-b1f6-cbc8592908a3.html Month-long art scavenger hunt, Free Art Movement, comes to Classic City], TheRed&amp;Black, Apr 7, 2016 [retrieved 3 Dec 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement is distinct from the [[free culture movement]] as the artist retains full copyright for the work.

==Around the globe==
[[File:Ervin Hervé - Lóránth - Thankyoubudapest (1).JPG|thumb|''Thankyoubudapest'' (Hervé)]]
Street art exists worldwide. Large cities and regional towns of the world are home to some form of street art community, from which pioneering artists or forerunners of particular mediums or techniques emerge. Internationally known street artists travel between such locations to promote and exhibit their artwork.

===North America===
'''[[New York City]]''' attracts artists from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rojo | first1=Jaime | last2=Harrington | first2=Steven P. |title=Street Art New York |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=391sQgAACAAJ |year= 2010 |publisher=Prestel Pub |isbn=978-3-7913-4428-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In '''[[Manhattan]]''', "post-graffiti" street art grew in the 1980s from the then largely vacant neighborhoods of [[SoHo]] and the [[Lower East Side]]. The [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] art district became another locale, with area galleries also hosting formal exhibitions of street artist's work. In '''[[Brooklyn]]''', the [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] and [[Dumbo, Brooklyn|Dumbo]] neighborhoods&amp;nbsp;— especially near the waterfront&amp;nbsp;— are recognized street art sites.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Kugel (9 March 2008) [http://travel.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/travel/09weekend.html "To the Trained Eye, Museum Pieces Lurk Everywhere"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs in the [[Pennsylvania]] cities of '''[[Philadelphia]]''' and '''[[Pittsburgh]]''' provide funding to agencies who employ street artists to decorate city walls. The [[Mural Arts Program]] established in 1984 has helped Philadelphia earn praise as the "City of Murals".
The project was initiated to encourage graffiti artists toward a more constructive use of their talents. Murals backed by [[The Sprout Fund]] in Pittsburgh were named the "Best Public Art" by the ''[[Pittsburgh City Paper]]'' in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muralarts.org/about/history |title=History &amp;#124; Mural Arts Program |publisher=Muralarts.org |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hoff| first = Al| title = Best Public Art: Sprout Fund Murals| newspaper = [[Pittsburgh City Paper]]| date = 14 December 2006 | url = http://www.pittsburghcitypaper.ws/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A20486 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atlanta established a Graffiti Task Force in 2011. Although the city selected a number of murals which would not be targeted by the task force, the selection process overlooked street art of the popular Krug Street Tunnel site. Art created in conjunction with the [[Living Walls (conference)|Living Walls]] street art conference, which Atlanta hosts annually, were spared.

'''[[São Paulo]]''' is also home to an internationally recognized street art scene.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

An abundance of buildings slated for demolition provide blank canvases to a multitude of artists, and the authorities cannot keep up with removing artists output. "Population density" and "urban anxiety" are common motifs expressed by "Grafiteiros" in their street art and ''[[pichação]]'', rune-like black graffiti, said to convey feelings of class conflict.

Many international films have been produced by and about artists who have participated in the programs, their murals and street drawings, and special events at the festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourobserver.com/content/2012-Chalk-Festival-342.html ''Chalk Festival''], a forty-page guide to the 2012 Sarasota Chalk Festival, Sarasota Observer, 28 October through 6 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Symphony No.1''' is A three movement piece for [[Orchestra]] and Turntables by [[Jeremy Mayall]].  This piece is the first orchestral [[symphony]] to use the techniques of turntablism.

== History ==
The conception for this piece started in 2003 when composer [[Jeremy Mayall]] first wanted to blend the worlds of classical orchestral music with modern Hip Hip turntablism.
He began work on creating a structure for the piece, as well as deciding how best to score and integrate the turntable parts into the well established orchestral traditions.
The piece was finished in early 2004. It was played as part of orchestral readings events by the APO and NZSO but didn't receive its premiere performance until May 2005. The premiere performance was given by the [[Wellington Youth Orchestra at the Michael Fowler Centre]], in Wellington, [[New Zealand]]. Mayall performed the turntable part.

In general, the 18th and 19th century presidents are on the left, the later ones on the right, some appear lost in thought while others, [[Bill Clinton]] and the two Roosevelts, are applauding. The only non-president in the painting is a young white man, who sits alone on a park bench, hunched over in despair, contemplating his future. Some of the presidents, including [[George Washington|Washington]], [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]], [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] and [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] reach out to him, while looking toward [[Barack Obama]] who stands in the foreground right. [[James Madison]], the Father of the Constitution, is outraged by Obama's actions, for beneath Obama's foot is the U.S. Constitution. Scattered on the ground are dollar bills, laws and amendments that form part of the Bill of Rights.

==Reception and influence==

The painting gained initial notoriety in 2010 when it was featured on [[MSNBC]] television host [[Rachel Maddow]]'s blog as part of a caption contest.&lt;ref name="anikamehta1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ibtimes.com/forgotten-man-jon-mcnaughton-painting-shows-obama-standing-us-constitution-photo-405530 | title = The Forgotten Man: Jon McNaughton Painting Shows Obama Standing on US Constitution [PHOTO] | date = 2 March 2012 | accessdate = 25 April 2018 | publisher = ''International Business Times'' | author = Anika Mehta }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, it drew satirical praise during an episode of ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' from [[Stephen Colbert (character)|Stephen Colbert's conservative persona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sltrib.com/news/2017/08/26/utah-artist-who-found-fame-and-controversy-for-religious-and-political-works-releases-first-trump-painting/ | title = Utah painter who found fame and controversy for religious and political art releases first Trump piece | date = 13 September 2017 | accessdate = 25 April 2018 | publisher = ''The Salt Lake Tribune'' | author = Brennan Smith }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being purchased by conservative commentator [[Sean Hannity]] in 2016, ''The Forgotten Man'' was rumored to have been bought as a gift for then President-elect [[Donald Trump]], though a spokesperson for [[Fox News]] (Hannity's employer) later clarified that the painting was never intended to be given as a gift.&lt;ref name="jimnewell"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/11/16/did_sean_hannity_buy_donald_trump_this_painting.html | title = Did Sean Hannity Buy Donald Trump This Anti-Obama Painting to Hang in the White House? | date = 17 November 2016 | accessdate = 25 April 2018 | publisher = ''Slate'' | author = Jim Newell }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.politico.com/blogs/donald-trump-administration/2016/11/sean-hannity-buys-anti-obama-painting-231544 | title = Update: Mystery solved!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9467">{{redirect|The Golden Axe|other uses|Golden Axe (disambiguation)}}
'''The Honest Woodcutter''', also known as '''Mercury and the Woodman''' and '''The Golden Axe''', is one of [[Aesop's Fables]], numbered 173 in the [[Perry Index]]. It serves as a cautionary tale on the need for cultivating honesty, even at the price of self-interest.

==The story==
The Greek version of the story tells of a woodcutter who accidentally dropped his axe into a river and, because this was his only means of livelihood, sat down and wept. Taking pity on him, the god [[Hermes]] (also known as [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]) dived into the water and returned with a golden axe. "Was this what you had lost?", Hermes asked, but the woodcutter said it was not, and returned the same answer when a silver axe was brought to the surface. Only when his own tool is produced does he claim it. Impressed by his honesty, the god allows him to keep all three. Hearing of the man's good fortune, an envious neighbor threw his own axe into the river and wailed for its return. When Hermes appeared and offered him a golden axe, the man greedily claimed it but was denied both that and the return of his own axe.

Though the tale's moral is that 'Honesty is the best policy', as the English proverb has it, there existed a medieval Byzantine proverb apparently alluding to the fable, which stated that 'A river does not always bring axes'. But since this was glossed to mean that no person always acts consistently, it is obviously at a considerable remove from the story's application.&lt;ref name="Hansen2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=William F. Hansen|title=Ariadne's Thread: A Guide to International Tales Found in Classical Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ezDlXl7gP9oC&amp;pg=PA44|accessdate=2013-04-14|year=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-3670-2|page=44|chapter=Hermes and the Woodcutter}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence of ideas that led to this understanding of the fable also exposes the gap in the envious neighbor's logic. He had observed the [[proximate and ultimate causation|proximate cause]] for enrichment, namely dropping an axe in the river, and overlooked the ultimate cause - the need for scrupulous honesty. The right combination of circumstances had to be there for Hermes to act as he did. Without them, as the neighbor eventually learned, 'the river does not always bring (golden) axes'. 

A burlesque retelling of the fable occurs in [[François Rabelais]]'s 16th-century novel ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]''. It takes up most of the author's prologue to the 4th Book and is considerably extended in his typically prolix and circuitous style. The woodcutter's cries disturb the chief of the gods as he deliberates the world's business and he sends Mercury down with instructions to test the man with the three axes and cut off his head if he chooses wrongly. Although he survives the test and returns a rich man, the entire countryside decides to follow his example and gets decapitated. So, Rabelais concludes, it is better to be moderate in our desires. Much the same story is told in [[La Fontaine's Fables]] (V.1) but in more concentrated form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/19785 |title=An English version |publisher=Readbookonline.net |date= |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, rather than beheading the woodman's imitators, Mercury merely administers a heavy blow.

==The fable in the arts==
Some paintings named from the fable have been broad landscapes with small figures added in the middle plane. [[Salvator Rosa]]'s ''Mercury and the Dishonest Woodman'' in the [[National Gallery]], London, dates from about 1650.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/salvator-rosa-landscape-with-mercury-and-the-dishonest-woodman |title=Salvator Rosa &amp;#124; Landscape with Mercury and the Dishonest Woodman &amp;#124; NG84 &amp;#124; The National Gallery, London |publisher=Nationalgallery.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; An 18th-century watercolour by George Robertson (1748–88) seems to derive from this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icollector.com/George-Robertson-1748-1788-watercolour-Mercury-and-The-Woodman-9-5-x-15-5-ins_i5078639 |title=George Robertson (1748-1788) watercolour, Mercury and The Woodman, 9.5 x 15.5 ins |publisher=Icollector.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles-André van Loo]] gives greater prominence to the figures in his ''Mercure présentant des haches au bûcheron'' in the [[Hôtel de Soubise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insecula.com/oeuvre/photo_ME0000063203.html |title=Mercure présentant des haches au bûcheron |publisher=Insecula.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025055023/http://www.insecula.com/oeuvre/photo_ME0000063203.html |archivedate=2012-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this the god hovers in mid-air and presents the axes to the surprised and kneeling woodman. 

Illustrations of the fable on English chinaware draw on the woodcut in [[Samuel Croxall]]'s edition of Aesop. A Wedgwood plate of about 1775 displays a red picture in a square, garlanded frame. The rim has a wavy edge printed with detached sprays of flowers. Much the same picture as there, printed in green, is used on a contemporary Liverpool tile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/search/?listing_type=&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=15&amp;narrow=&amp;q=mercury+and+the+woodman&amp;commit=Search&amp;quality=0&amp;objectnamesearch=&amp;placesearch=&amp;after=&amp;after-adbc=AD&amp;before=&amp;before-adbc=AD&amp;namesearch=&amp;materialsearch=&amp;mnsearch=&amp;locationsearch= |title=Both are on display in the Victoria and Albert Museum |publisher=Collections.vam.ac.uk |date=2013-04-02 |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the left foreground, Mercury is presenting an axe to the seated woodman. In the distance, on the opposite bank, his dishonest neighbour has raised his axe before throwing it into the river. 

In 1987 the story was included on the 40 drachma value of the eight-stamp set of Aesop's fables issued by Greece and features the naked god seated on a rock in the river and offering the three axes to the bearded woodman on the bank.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.creighton.edu/aesop/artifacts/stamps/greece Creighton University]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
The appearance of other tellings of the story, with local variations, from [[Nigeria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tcdZB_qga58C&amp;q=honesty+and+dishonesty#v=snippet&amp;q=honesty%20and%20dishonesty&amp;f=false|last=Aare |first=Emmanuel |title=African Tales|chapter=Honesty and Dishonesty|page=18 |isbn=978-1-60808-000-7 |publisher=WriteLife LLC |date=1 December 2008 |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thailand]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raupectOnCkC&amp;q=honest+woodcutter#v=snippet&amp;q=honest%20woodcutter&amp;f=false|isbn=1-56308-096-6 |chapter=The Honest Woodcutter |title=Thai Tales |first1=Supaporn |last1=Vathanaprida |first2=Margaret |last2=MacDonald |first3=Boonsong |last3=Rohitasuke |page=42 |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |date=1994 |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tibet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b3jVISrJayEC&amp;q=golden+axe#v=snippet&amp;q=golden%20axe&amp;f=false|title=Essentials of modern literary Tibetan: a reading course and reference grammar |last1=Goldstein|first1=Melvin|last2=Rimpoche|first2=Gelek|last3=Phuntshog|first3=Lobsang|chapter=The Golden Axe|page=208|isbn=0-520-07622-2 |publisher=University of California Press |date=7 August 1991 |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; seems to call in question the purely Greek origin of the story. The Thai account claims to originate from a Buddhist [[Jataka]] tale but gives no source for a comparison to be made. Since the main lines of the story in all three are the same as in Aesopic versions, one might infer that, whatever their original form, they have since been influenced by the European model. 

A certain kinship has also been observed between the fable and the account of the miraculous recovery of an axe from a river in the [[Tanakh|Jewish Bible]]. There the prophet [[Elisha]] was travelling with some members of a religious community 'and when they came to the Jordan, they began cutting down trees; but it chanced that as one man was felling a trunk, the head of his axe flew off into the water. "Oh master," he exclaimed, "it was a borrowed one." "Where did it fall?" asked the man of God. When he was shown the place, he cut off a piece of wood and threw it in and made the iron float.' (NEB, Kings II, 6.4-6)

The genre of '''travel literature''' encompasses [[outdoor literature]], [[guide book]]s, [[nature writing]], and travel [[memoir]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cuddon, J. A. |title=The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory |location=London |publisher=Penguin Books |date=1999 |page=937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One early travel memoirist in [[Western literature]] was [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], a Greek geographer of the 2nd century AD. In the [[early modern period]], [[James Boswell]]'s ''Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides'' (1786) helped shape travel memoir as a genre.

Early examples of travel literature include [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]' ''Description of Greece'' in the 2nd century CE, the ''[[Itinerarium Cambriae|Journey Through Wales]]'' (1191) and ''[[Descriptio Cambriae|Description of Wales]]'' (1194) by [[Gerald of Wales]], and the travel journals of [[Ibn Jubayr]] (1145&amp;ndash;1214) and [[Ibn Battuta]] (1304&amp;ndash;1377), both of whom recorded their travels across the known world in detail. The travel genre was a fairly common genre in medieval [[Arabic literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Travel Genre in Arabic Literature: A Selective Literary and Historical Study|first=Fathi A.|last=El-Shihibi|publisher=Dissertation.com|location=Boca Raton, Fla|year=2006|isbn=1-58112-326-4|type=Originally presented as the author's thesis (Ph.D.--Boston University, 1998)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Travel literature became popular during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) of medieval China.&lt;ref name="hargett 67"&gt;Hargett 1985, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The genre was called 'travel record literature' (youji wenxue), and was often written in [[narrative]], [[prose]], [[essay]] and [[diary]] style.&lt;ref name="hargett 67 93"&gt;Hargett 1985, pp. 67–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Travel literature authors such as [[Fan Chengda]] (1126–1193) and [[Xu Xiake]] (1587–1641) incorporated a wealth of [[geographical]] and [[topographical]] information into their writing, while the 'daytrip essay' ''[[Su Shi#Travel record literature|Record of Stone Bell Mountain]]'' by the noted poet and statesman [[Su Shi]] (1037–1101) presented a philosophical and moral argument as its central purpose.&lt;ref name="hargett 74 76"&gt;Hargett 1985, pp. 74–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest known records of taking pleasure in travel, of travelling for the sake of travel and writing about it, is [[Francesco Petrarch|Petrarch]]'s (1304&amp;ndash;1374) ascent of [[Mount Ventoux]] in 1336. He states that he went to the mountaintop for the pleasure of seeing the top of the famous height. His companions who stayed at the bottom he called ''frigida incuriositas'' ("a cold lack of curiosity"). He then wrote about his climb, making [[Medieval allegory|allegorical]] comparisons between climbing the mountain and his own moral progress in life.

Michault Taillevent, a poet for the [[Duke of Burgundy]], travelled through the [[Jura Mountains]] in 1430 and recorded his personal reflections, his horrified reaction to the sheer rock faces, and the terrifying thunderous cascades of mountain streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7yqsIYSNmLMC&amp;pg=PA32 | title=Un poète bourguignon du XVe siècle, Michault Taillevent: édition et étude | publisher=Librairie Droz |author1=Deschaux, Robert |author2=Taillevent, Michault | year=1975 | pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Antoine de la Sale]] (c. 1388&amp;ndash;c. 1462), author of ''Petit Jehan de Saintre'', climbed to the crater of a volcano in the [[Lipari Islands]] in 1407, leaving us with his impressions. "Councils of mad youth" were his stated reasons for going. In the mid-15th century, Gilles le Bouvier, in his ''Livre de la description des pays'', gave us his reason to travel and write:
:Because many people of diverse nations and countries delight and take pleasure, as I have done in times past, in seeing the world and things therein, and also because many wish to know without going there, and others wish to see, go, and travel, I have begun this little book.

In 1589, [[Richard Hakluyt]] (c. 1552&amp;ndash;1616) published ''Voyages'', a foundational text of the travel literature genre.

In the 18th Century, travel literature was commonly known as the book of travels, which mainly consisted of maritime [[diary|diaries]].&lt;ref name="stolley 26"&gt;Stolley 1992, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In 18th century Britain, almost every famous writer worked in the travel literature form.&lt;ref name="fussell 54"&gt;Fussell 1963, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Captain James Cook]]'s diaries (1784) were the equivalent of today's best sellers&lt;ref&gt;Glyndwr Williams, ''Captain Cook's Voyages: 1768–1779''. London: The Folio Society, 1997, p. xxxii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s ''Personal narrative of travels to the equinoctial regions of America, during the years 1799–1804'', originally published in French, was translated to multiple languages and influenced later naturalists, including [[Charles Darwin]].

Other later examples of travel literature include accounts of the [[Grand Tour]]. Aristocrats, clergy, and others with money and leisure time travelled Europe to learn about the art and architecture of its past. One tourism literature pioneer was [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] (1850&amp;ndash;1894), with ''[[An Inland Voyage]]'' (1878), and  ''[[Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes]]'' (1879) about his travels in the [[Cévennes]], (France), is among the first popular books to present hiking and camping as recreational activities, and tells of commissioning one of the first [[sleeping bag]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

==Travel books==
{{further|List of travel books}}

Travel books come in styles ranging from the [[documentary]], to the literary, as well as the journalistic, and from the humorous to the serious. They are often associated with [[tourism]] and include [[guide book]]s. Travel writing may be found on web sites, in periodicals, and in books. It has been produced by a variety of writers, including travelers, military officers, missionaries, explorers, scientists, pilgrims, social and physical scientists, educators, and migrants. Englishmen [[Eric Newby]],&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[[Margalit Fox]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/24/obituaries/24newby.html "Eric Newby, 86, Acclaimed British Travel Writer, Dies"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 24 october 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[H. V. Morton]], the Americans [[Bill Bryson]] and [[Paul Theroux]], and [[Wales|Welsh]] author [[Jan Morris]] are or were widely acclaimed as travel writers (though Morris has frequently claimed herself as a writer of 'place' rather than travel ''per se'').{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Bill Bryson in 2011 won the Golden Eagle Award from the Outdoor Writers and Photographers Guild.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.owpg.org.uk/2011/08/bill-bryson-wins-prestigious-golden-eagle-award/&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 November 2012, Durham University officially renamed the [[Durham University Library|Main Library]] the Bill Bryson Library for his contributions as the university's 11th chancellor (2005–11).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Main Library is being renamed 'The Bill Bryson Library'!|date=2012-09-25|work=[[Durham University]]|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/library/news/?itemno=15355|accessdate=2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill Bryson Library renaming event, Tuesday 27 November 2012|date=2012-11-22|work=[[Durham University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Theroux was awarded the 1981 [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for his novel ''[[The Mosquito Coast]]'', which was adapted for the 1986 movie of the same name. He was also awarded in 1989 the [[Thomas Cook Travel Book Award]]  for ''Riding the Iron Rooster''. In 2005, Jan Morris was awarded the [[Golden PEN Award]] by [[English PEN]] for "a Lifetime's Distinguished Service to Literature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.englishpen.org/prizes/golden-pen-award-for-a-lifetimes-distinguished-service-to-literature |title=Golden Pen Award, official website |publisher=[[English PEN]] |date= |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Traveling Genius: The Writing Life of Jan Morris |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wHMEVRxWx6UC&amp;pg=PR20 |author=Gillian Fenwick |publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press |chapter=Chronology |page=XX |year=2008 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Travel literature often intersects with [[essay]] writing, as in [[V. S. Naipaul]]'s ''[[India: A Wounded Civilization]]'' (1976), whose trip became the occasion for extended observations on a nation and people. This is similarly the case in [[Rebecca West]]'s work on Yugoslavia, ''[[Black Lamb and Grey Falcon]]'' (1941).&lt;ref&gt;West, Rebecca, intr. Geoff Dyer, (2006). ''Black Lamb and Grey Falcon: A Journey Through Yugoslavia''. Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a writer will settle into a locality for an extended period, absorbing a sense of place while continuing to observe with a travel writer's sensibility. Examples of such writings include [[Lawrence Durrell]]'s ''[[Bitter Lemons]]'' (1957), [[Deborah Tall]]'s ''The Island of the White Cow: Memories of an Irish Island'' (1986),&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Gross, "'White Cow` Absorbing Account Of Irish Island The Island Of The White Cow: Memories Of An Irish Island. By Deborah Tall". March 2, 1986, ''News/Sun-Sentinel''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter Mayle]]'s best-selling ''[[A Year in Provence]]'' (1989) and its sequels.

Travel and nature writing merge in many of the works by [[Sally Carrighar]], [[Gerald Durrell]] and [[Ivan T. Sanderson]]. Sally Carrighar's works include ''One Day at Teton Marsh'' (1965), ''Home to the Wilderness'' (1973), and ''Wild Heritage'' (1965). [[Gerald Durrell]]'s ''[[My Family and Other Animals]]'' (1956) is an autobiographical work by the British naturalist. It tells of the years that he lived as a child with his siblings and widowed mother on the Greek island of [[Corfu]] between 1935 and 1939. It describes the life of the Durrell family in a humorous manner, and explores the fauna of the island. It is the first and most well-known of Durrell's "Corfu trilogy", together with ''[[Birds, Beasts, and Relatives]]'' and ''[[The Garden of the Gods]]'' (1978). [[Ivan T. Sanderson]] published ''Animal Treasure'', a report of an expedition to the jungles of then-British West Africa; ''Caribbean Treasure'', an account of an expedition to [[Trinidad]], [[Haiti]], and [[Surinam]], begun in late 1936 and ending in late 1938; and ''Living Treasure'', an account of an expedition to [[Jamaica]], British Honduras (now [[Belize]]) and the [[Yucatán]]. These authors are [[natural history|naturalists]], who write in support of their fields of study. Another naturalist, [[Charles Darwin]], wrote his famous account of the journey of [[The Voyage of the Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']] at the intersection of science, natural history and travel.&lt;ref&gt;"Review of Narrative of the Surveying Voyages of H.M.S. Adventure and Beagle between the Years 1826 and 1836 ... &amp; Journal of Researches into the Geology and Natural History of the various Countries visited by H.M.S. Beagle ...". ''The Quarterly Review''. 65: 194–234. December 1839.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of writers famous in other fields have written about their travel experiences. Examples are [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland'' (1775); [[Charles Dickens]]' ''American Notes for General Circulation'' (1842); [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s ''Letters Written during a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark'' (1796); [[Hilaire Belloc]]'s ''The Path To Rome'' (1902); [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s ''Twilight in Italy and Other Essays'' (1916); ''Mornings in Mexico and Other Essays'' (1927); [[Rebecca West]]'s ''[[Black Lamb and Grey Falcon]]'' (1941); and [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[Travels with Charley: In Search of America]]'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;[http://reason.com/archives/2011/04/04/sorry-charley "Sorry, Charley"], Bill Steigerwald, ''Reason'', April 2011 [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/books/steinbecks-travels-with-charley-gets-a-fact-checking.html "A Reality Check for Steinbeck and Charley"], Charles McGrath, ''New York Times'', April 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adventure literature==
In the world of sailing [[Joshua Slocum]]'s ''[[Sailing Alone Around the World]]'' (1900) is a classic of outdoor adventure literature.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Slocum Society: [http://www.joshuaslocumsocietyintl.org].&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1895, [[Joshua Slocum]] set sail from [[Boston, Massachusetts]] and in  ''Sailing Alone Around the World'',&lt;ref name=SailingAlone&gt;Slocum (1899), ''Sailing Alone Around the World''&lt;/ref&gt; he described his departure in the following manner:

:I had resolved on a voyage around the world, and as the wind on the morning of April 24, 1895 was fair, at noon I weighed anchor, set sail, and filled away from Boston, where the ''Spray'' had been moored snugly all winter. ... A thrilling pulse beat high in me. My step was light on deck in the crisp air. I felt there could be no turning back, and that I was engaging in an adventure the meaning of which I thoroughly understood.

More than three years later, on June 27, 1898, Slocum returned to [[Newport, Rhode Island]], having [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] the world.

==Guide books==
{{main|Guide book}}
[[Image:Claife Station.jpg|right|thumb|Claife Station, built at one of [[Thomas West (priest)|Thomas West]]'s 'viewing stations', to allow visiting tourists and artists to better appreciate the [[picturesque]] English [[Lake District]].]]
A '''guide book''' or '''travel guide''' is "a book of information about a place, designed for the use of visitors or tourists".&lt;ref&gt;''New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; An early example is [[Thomas West (priest)|Thomas West]]'s guide to the [[Lake District]], published in 1778.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas West, (1821) [1778]. ''A Guide to the Lakes in Cumberland, Westmorland, and Lancashire''. Kendal: W. Pennington.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas West (priest)|Thomas West]], an English [[priest]], popularized the idea of walking for pleasure in his guide to the [[Lake District]] of 1778. In the introduction he wrote that he aimed: &lt;blockquote&gt;to encourage the taste of visiting the lakes by furnishing the traveller with a Guide; and for that purpose, the writer has here collected and laid before him, all the select stations and points of view, noticed by those authors who have last made the tour of the lakes, verified by his own repeated observations.&lt;ref name=West2&gt;{{cite book |last=West |title=A Guide to the Lakes |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; To this end he included various 'stations' or viewpoints around the lakes, from which tourists would be encouraged to appreciate the views in terms of their aesthetic qualities.&lt;ref name=development&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lakedistrict.uk7.net/tourist_development.html |title=Development of tourism in the Lake District National Park |accessdate=2008-11-27 |publisher=Lake District UK |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011064752/http://www.lakedistrict.uk7.net/tourist_development.html |archivedate=October 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Published in 1778 the book was a major success.&lt;ref name=NPA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/learning/lakedistrictfacts/archaeologyhistory/archaeologydiscoveryzone/archaeologyindepth/archaeologyviewing-stations-2 |title=Understanding the National Park &amp;mdash; Viewing Stations |accessdate=2008-11-27 |publisher=Lake District National Park Authority |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104212541/http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/learning/lakedistrictfacts/archaeologyhistory/archaeologydiscoveryzone/archaeologyindepth/archaeologyviewing-stations-2 |archivedate=2014-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It will usually include full details relating to accommodation, restaurants, transportation, and activities. Maps of varying detail and historical and cultural information are also often included. Different kinds of guide books exist, focusing on different aspects of travel, from [[adventure travel]] to relaxation, or aimed at travelers with different incomes, or focusing on sexual orientation or types of diet. Travel guides can also take the form of [[travel website]]s.

==Travel journals==
[[File:Goethe's Italian Journey.png|thumb|upright|Goethe's Italian Journey between September 1786 and May 1788]]
A travel journal, also called road journal, is a record made by a traveller, sometimes in diary form, of the traveler's experiences, written during the course of the journey and later edited for publication. This is a long-established literary format; an early example is the writing of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (2nd century AD) who produced his ''Description of Greece'' based on his own observations. [[James Boswell]] published his ''[[The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides]]'' in 1786 and [[Goethe]] published his ''[[Italian Journey]]'', based on diaries, in 1816. [[Frances Erskine Inglis, 1st Marquise of Calderón de la Barca|Fannie Calderón de la Barca]], the Scottish-born wife of the Spanish ambassador to Mexico 1839–1842, wrote ''[[Life in Mexico]]'', an important travel narrative of her time there, with many observations of local life. A British traveller, [[Mrs Alec Tweedie]], published a number of travelogues, ranging from Denmark (1895) and Finland (1897), to the U.S. (1913), several on Mexico (1901, 1906, 1917), and one on Russia, Siberia, and China (1926). A more recent example is [[Che Guevara]]'s ''[[The Motorcycle Diaries (book)|The Motorcycle Diaries]]''. A travelogue is a [[Travelogue (films)|film]], book written up from a travel diary, or illustrated talk describing the experiences of and places visited by traveller.&lt;ref&gt;''New Oxford American Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; American writer [[Paul Theroux]] has published many works of travel literature, the first success being ''[[The Great Railway Bazaar]]''.  Anglo-American [[Bill Bryson]] is known for ''[[A Walk in the Woods (book)|A Walk in the Woods]]'', made into a Hollywood [[A Walk in the Woods (film)|film of the same name]].&lt;ref name="variety.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNary|first1=Dave|title=‘99 Homes,’ ‘A Walk in the Woods’ Set for September Releases|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/99-homes-a-walk-in-the-woods-release-date-broad-green-1201468864/|accessdate=April 9, 2015|work=variety.com|date=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiction==
Some fictional travel stories are related to travel literature. Although it may be desirable in some contexts to distinguish [[fiction]]al from [[non-fiction]]al works, such distinctions have proved notoriously difficult to make in practice, as in the famous instance of the travel writings of [[Marco Polo]] or [[John Mandeville]]. Examples of fictional works of travel literature based on actual journeys are: 
* [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899), which has its origin in an actual voyage Conrad made up the [[River Congo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Conrad, Joseph &amp; Zdzisław Najder (Editor)|title=The Congo Diary and Other Uncollected Pieces| date= 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Jack Kerouac]]'s ''[[On the Road]]'' (1957) and ''[[The Dharma Bums]]'' (1958) are fictionalized accounts of his travels across the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s
*Travel writer [[Kira Salak]]'s novel, ''[[The White Mary]]'' (2008), a contemporary example of a real life journey transformed into a work of fiction, which takes place in [[Papua New Guinea]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]].&lt;ref name=NatGeoWhiteMary&gt;{{cite web|last=Finkel[[Michael Finkel|Finkel]]|first= Michael|title=Kira Salek: The White Mary|url=http://adventure.nationalgeographic.com/2008/08/kira-salak/michael-finkel-text|work=National Geographic Adventure|accessdate=12 November 2010|date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WallStreetWhiteMary&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121702303930685891?mod=2_1167_1 |title=Imaginary Journey |work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Jeffrey A. | last=Trachtenberg | date=26 July 2008|accessdate=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amazon_entryWhiteMary&gt;{{cite web |title=The White Mary: A Novel|work=Amazon.com|isbn=0805088474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travel blogs==
In the 21st century, travel literature became a genre of [[social media]] in the form of travel blogs, with travel bloggers using outlets like personal [[blog]]s, [[Pinterest]], [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]] to convey information about their adventures, and provide advice for navigating particular countries, or for traveling generally.&lt;ref name="TJEPIC"&gt;F. Hanusch, E. Fürsich, ''Travel Journalism: Exploring Production, Impact and Culture'' (2014), p. 100-101.&lt;/ref&gt; Travel blogs were among the first instances of blogging, which began in the mid 1990s.&lt;ref name="TJEPIC"/&gt;. In 2018 the most popular self hosted blogging platform is [[WordPress]], due to its ease of use&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-choose-the-best-blogging-platform/|title=How to Choose the Best Blogging Platform in 2018 (Compared)|date=2016-11-10|work=WPBeginner|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Scholarship==

&lt;!--this whole section smells of [[WP:OR]] and [[WP:POV]]; needs either rewrite or thorough citations--&gt;
The systematic study of travel literature emerged as a field of scholarly inquiry in the mid-1990s, with its own conferences, organizations, journals, monographs, anthologies, and encyclopedias.  Important, pre-1995 monographs are: ''Abroad'' (1980) by [[Paul Fussell]], an [[exploration]] of British interwar travel writing as escapism; ''Gone Primitive: Modern Intellects, Savage Minds'' (1990) by Marianna Torgovnick, an inquiry into the [[primitivism|primitivist]] presentations of foreign cultures; ''Haunted Journeys: Desire and Transgression in European Travel Writing'' (1991) by Dennis Porter, a close look at the psychological correlatives of travel; ''Discourses of Difference: An Analysis of Women's Travel Writing'' by Sara Mills, an inquiry into the intersection of gender and [[colonialism]] during the 19th century; ''Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation'' (1992), [[Mary Louise Pratt]]'s influential study of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] travel writing's dissemination of a colonial mind-set; and ''Belated Travelers'' (1994), an analysis of colonial anxiety by Ali Behdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29468460|title=Belated travelers : orientalism in the age of colonial dissolution|last=Behdad|first=Ali|date=1994|publisher=Duke University Press|year=|isbn=0822314711|location=Durham, North Carolina|pages=|oclc=29468460}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Disrupting the assumptions of traditional travel writing, Amitav Ghosh's ''In an Antique Land'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29428387|title=In an antique land|last=Ghosh|first=Amitav|date=1994|publisher=|year=|isbn=0679727833|edition=|location=New York|pages=|oclc=29428387}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be regarded as an example of "counter travel narrative", reversing the "roles of traveller and local, viewing the present as contextualized by the colonial and precolonial past, and eschewing definitive authorial authority [in] a powerful rebuttal to the ideology of the traditional travel text."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McParland|first=Liam|date=2017|title=Egypt, India, ideology: In an antique land as a rebuttal to the traditional travel text|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10613/5430|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=VIUSpace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travel awards==

Prizes awarded annually for travel books have included the [[Thomas Cook Travel Book Award]], which ran from 1980 to 2004, the  [[Boardman Tasker Prize for Mountain Literature]], and the [[Dolman Best Travel Book Award]], which began in 2006. The [[North American Travel Journalists Association]] holds an annual awards competition honoring travel journalism in a multitude of categories, ranging across print and online media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://natja.memberclicks.net/competition-guidelines|title=Competition Rules and Guidelines|last=Leon|first=Yanira|website=natja.memberclicks.net|language=en-us|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
