'''''Affluenza: The All-Consuming Epidemic''''' is a 2001 [[anti-consumerist]] book by John de Graaf, environmental scientist David Wann, and economist [[Thomas Naylor|Thomas H. Naylor]]. Viewing consumerism (with its accompanying overwork and dissatisfaction) as a deliberately spread disease, the book consists of three parts—symptoms, origins, and treatment. [[Affluenza]] is described as "a painful, contagious, socially transmitted condition of overload, debt, anxiety, and waste resulting from the dogged pursuit of more".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Book Review: Affluenza: The All-Consuming Epidemic (2nd Edition) | last=O'Neill | first=Barbara | journal=Journal of Financial Counseling &amp; Planning | year=2008 | volume=19 | issue=1 | pages=70–72 | url=http://6aa7f5c4a9901a3e1a1682793cd11f5a6b732d29.gripelements.com/pdf/11-br-affluenza-volume-19-issue-1.pdf | accessdate=2011-02-16 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711130521/http://6aa7f5c4a9901a3e1a1682793cd11f5a6b732d29.gripelements.com/pdf/11-br-affluenza-volume-19-issue-1.pdf | archive-date=2011-07-11 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was considered one of the eight best non-fiction books of the year by ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'', and copies were given to every freshman by two universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bkconnection.com/ProdDetails.asp?ID=1576753573&amp;PG=1&amp;Type=RLMa&amp;PCS=BKP Affluenza, Second Edition]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/66ga3Oobd?url=http://www.bkconnection.com/ProdDetails.asp?ID=1576753573&amp;PG=1&amp;Type=RLMa&amp;PCS=BKP |date=April 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amazon.com]] lists 38 books citing it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Affluenza-All-Consuming-Epidemic-John-Graaf/dp/book-citations/1576751996/ref=sid_dp_av?ie=UTF8&amp;citeType=cited#cited Citations]&lt;/ref&gt; The book was highly recommended for academic and public libraries by M. Bay from Indiana University in ''Library Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Affluenza-All-Consuming-Epidemic-John-Graaf/dp/product-description/1576751511/ref=dp_proddesc_0?ie=UTF8&amp;n=283155&amp;s=books Editorial Reviews]&lt;/ref&gt; The Idaho State University has focused its Book Reading Project 2007 on the book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.isu.edu/headlines/?p=718 ISU Reading Project ‘Affluenza’ events scheduled Sept. 18-21]&lt;/ref&gt;

The title was awarded to Ximena Andrea García Buitrago.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/03/24/colombia.drug.queen/index.html?hpt=C1|title=Model, allegedly drug queen, on the lam|publisher=CNN|author= Karl Penhaul|date=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Zamora | first =Héctor Fabio | title =Destronada la Reina Nacional del Café | work =Archives | publisher =El Tiempo | date =2000-07-06 | url =http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-1220246 | accessdate =2011-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syndicate==
Valencia's operation is believed to be a "rival empire" to that of her former boyfriend, a Mexican drug baron known as "The Monster".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/argentina/7304510/Lingerie-model-runs-one-of-worlds-largest-drug-gangs-according-to-police.html Telegraph.co.uk: Lingerie model runs one of world's largest drug gangs, according to police]&lt;/ref&gt; She formed her own cartel after splitting with him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ninemsn.com.au/world/1016790/police-hunt-ex-model-turned-cocaine-kingpin NineMSN: Police hunt ex-model turned 'cocaine kingpin'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227091035/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/world/1016790/police-hunt-ex-model-turned-cocaine-kingpin |date=February 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is alleged to have recruited other models, whom she is quoted referring to as her "unsuspicious, beautiful angels" as drug traffickers, paying them up to around $5,000 (£3,200) per trip to transport [[cocaine]] from Argentina to England by way of [[Cancún]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2010/02/lingerie-model-sought-for-allegedly-hiring-beautiful-models-to-smuggle-cocaine/1 USAToday: Lingerie model allegedly hired beautiful models to smuggle cocaine]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
Valencia's alleged syndicate was believed to have been exposed on 13 December 2009, when a 21-year-old woman, "Ariel L", was arrested with a suitcase containing 55&amp;nbsp;kg (121 pounds) of cocaine at [[Ezeiza International Airport]], Buenos Aires, Argentina.  "L" made no attempt to hide the drugs inside her bags, leading authorities to suspect the ring had help from employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2010/02/24/2010-02-24_lingerie_model_angie_valencia_running_global_cocaine_ring__using_fellow_catwalke.html NY Daily News: Lingerie model Angie Valencia running global cocaine ring -- using fellow catwalkers as mules: cops]&lt;/ref&gt;  She is reported to have been told that no one at the airport would try to stop her, and an investigation was launched to find employees of the airport with possible links to the syndicate.  After questioning "L", three additional arrests were made and a warrant was issued for Valencia's arrest.  Authorities believed she was still in Argentina after she fled a hotel where she had been staying with her [[Pomeranian (dog)|pomeranian]]. Investigators attempted to trace her location through the address under which the animal was registered, but it only led them to an abandoned warehouse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1253347/Runaway-lingerie-model-Angie-Sanselmente-Valencia-named-head-drug-gang.html DailyMail.co.uk: On the run, the lingerie model who heads an all-women cocaine-smuggling cartel]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010 [[Interpol]] issued an international warrant for her arrest.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

Valencia was finally arrested in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on May 26, 2010, while staying in a local [[hostel]]. Police reported that she had registered under a false name and had tried to alter her appearance by dyeing her hair blonde.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/05/26/argentina.model.arrested/?hpt=T2 CNN: Former model arrested in Argentina on drug charges]&lt;/ref&gt;

She was initially jailed on 27 May 2010 in the "Centro Federal de Detención de Mujeres Unidad número 31" in the city of Ezeiza, Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. In October of the same year she was moved to the "Instituto Correccional de Mujeres Unidad número 3" also in Ezeiza after she suffered some violent attacks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ambito.com/noticia.asp?id=543682&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Hurley | first =Bevan | title ='Cocaine queen' moved after assaults in prison | work =New Zealand Herald | publisher =APN Holdings NZ | date =1 May 2011 | url =http://www.nzherald.co.nz/bevan-hurley/news/article.cfm?a_id=645&amp;objectid=10722644 | accessdate =19 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anton Herman Gerard''' "'''Anthony'''" '''Fokker''' (6 April 1890 – 23 December 1939) was a Dutch [[aviation]] pioneer and [[aircraft manufacturer]]. He is most famous for the fighter aircraft he produced in Germany during the [[First World War]] such as the [[Fokker Eindecker fighters|Eindecker]] monoplanes,  the [[Fokker Triplane|Dr.1]] triplane and the [[Fokker D.VII|D.VII]] biplane.

After the treaty of Versailles forbade Germany to produce airplanes, Fokker moved his business to the [[Netherlands]]. There his company was responsible for a variety of successful aircraft including the [[Fokker trimotor]], a successful passenger aircraft of the inter-war years. He died in [[New York City|New York]] in 1939. Later authors suggest he was personally charismatic but unscrupulous in business and a controversial character.

==Early life==
Anthony (Tony) Fokker was born in [[Blitar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Santosa |first=Eddi |url=http://www.detiknews.com/index.php/detik.read/tahun/2007/bulan/02/tgl/28/time/082020/idnews/747790/idkanal/10 |title=Laporan dari Den Haag: Fokker, dari Kediri Lalu Mendunia |trans-title=Report from The Hague: Fokker, from Kediri Went Worldwide |language=id |website=detiknews.com |date=28 February 2007 |access-date=8 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929020444/http://news.detik.com/index.php/detik.read/tahun/2007/bulan/02/tgl/28/time/082020/idnews/747790/idkanal/10 |archive-date=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (then [[Dutch East Indies]], now [[Indonesia]]), to Herman Fokker, a Dutch coffee [[plantation]] owner. Some sources say that he was born in [[Kediri Regency|Kediri]]. At that time, Blitar was a part of the 'Kediri Residency', a colonial administrative division the capital of which was in Kediri. When Fokker was four, the family returned to the [[Netherlands]] and settled in [[Haarlem]] in order to provide Fokker and his older sister, Toos, with a Dutch upbringing.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Fokker was not a studious boy and did not complete his high school education.  However, he showed an early interest in mechanics, and preferred making things, playing with model trains and steam engines, and experimenting with model aeroplane designs.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

He devoted considerable effort{{when|date=April 2018}} to the development of a wheel that would not suffer from punctures, basically a wheel with a perimeter formed by a series of metal plates. This idea had been experimented with elsewhere and was already patented.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[File:Fokker vliegt rond de Grote of Sint-Bavokerk in Haarlem.jpg|thumb|Fokker flies around the [[Grote Kerk, Haarlem|Grote Kerk]] in Haarlem on 1 September 1911]]
Fokker's first interest in flight stemmed from [[Wilbur Wright]]'s exhibition flights in France in the summer and fall of 1908. In 1910, aged 20, Fokker was sent by his father to [[Germany]] to receive training as an automobile [[mechanic]] at Bingen Technical school, but his interest was in [[flight#Mechanical|flying]], so he transferred to the Erste deutsche Automobil-Fachschule in Mainz.&lt;ref&gt;van Weezepoel, Paul.

In 1912, Fokker moved to [[Johannisthal (Berlin)|Johannisthal]] near [[Berlin]] where he founded his first own company, ''Fokker Aeroplanbau''. In the following years he constructed a variety of airplanes. He relocated his factory to [[Schwerin]] where it was renamed ''Fokker Flugzeugwerke GmbH'', and later shortened to ''[[Fokker]] Werke GmbH''.{{citation needed|date=August 2017|reason=Company names not mentioned in source}}

==Involvement in World War I==
At the outbreak of [[World War I]] the German government took control of the factory. Fokker remained as director and alleged designer of many aircraft for the Imperial German Army Air Service (''[[Luftstreitkräfte]]''), including the [[Fokker Eindecker fighters|Fokker ''Eindecker'']] and the [[Fokker Dr.I]], the triplane made famous in the hands of aces such as [[Manfred von Richthofen]] (the Red Baron). In all, his company delivered about 700 military planes to the German air force as well as supplying the German navy and Austria-Hungary.

Fokker himself was a skilled pilot, demonstrating his aircraft on many occasions.&lt;ref name="van Wyngarden" /&gt;  On 13 June 1915, Fokker demonstrated the new ''Eindecker'' (monoplane) at [[Stenay]] in the [[5th Army (German Empire)|German 5th Army]] Sector in front of the [[William, German Crown Prince|German Crown Prince]] and other [[Very Important Person|VIPs]]. Fokker worked closely with an accomplished military pilot, [[Otto Parschau]], to bring the Eindecker into military use and on this occasion both men demonstrated the aircraft.  [[Max Immelmann]], later to become a high-scoring [[Flying Ace]] with the ''Eindecker'', commented in a letter written shortly after this event on 25 June 1915 that:&lt;ref name="van Wyngarden" /&gt;
"Fokker, especially, amazed us with his skill".

Author A.R. Weyl (Fokker: the creative years, Putnam 1965) says that, while Fokker was a talented and bold pilot, his business character was more flawed. He failed to reinvest war profits back into his factory which consequentially struggled to fulfill war contracts as the factory floor was often muddled with prototype development and production taking place at the same time. Fokker distrusted qualified engineers (which he was not) and resented frequent German insistence on carrying out stringent structural tests to ensure prototype aircraft were fit for combat. He could be bad tempered and insensitive as when he verbally abused his dying designer Martin Kreuzer on the evening of 27 June 1916, after Kreuzer had crashed the prototype Fokker D.I. The rudder jammed but Kreuzer was able to give a verbal report on the accident before he died. "Fokker hurried to the scene and shouted reproaches at the mortally injured man". Weyl says this incident was witnessed by [[Reinhold Platz]], who succeeded Kreuzer.

While Weyl's biography paints an unpleasant picture of Fokker as a businessman, he was a popular and charismatic figure with service pilots and could charm even senior officers. This charm enabled him to deal with the first major crisis of his German career when his newly delivered Fokker Dr.I triplanes began to experience sudden fatal accidents in late 1917 and the type was temporarily grounded as too dangerous to fly. The triplanes' top wings frequently ripped off under aerobatic conditions and even [[Lothar von Richthofen]] (brother of Manfred) was lucky to survive one such crash. Fokker was able to prove to the German high command that the basic design was not at fault but the German military inquiry concluded that shoddy workmanship due to poor supervision and quality control at the Fokker factory were to blame. Fokker received a stern warning about future conduct. Unfortunately the same scenario repeated itself again, a few months later, with the introduction of his E.V/D.VIII monoplane in mid-1918. A further high level German inquiry revealed more production and workmanship issues. Weyl asserts that the German authorities were now willing to file criminal charges against Fokker and might have done so, had he not returned to the Netherlands shortly after the end of World War I.

Fokker's own account of the D.VIII places the blame on officious German Air Force inspectors requiring an ill-conceived design change.  "When the first D-8[sic] was submitted to the engineering division to be sandload tested, the wings proved to be sufficiently strong, but the regulations called for a proportionate strength in the rear spar compared to the front spar... Complying with the government's edict, we strengthened the rear spar and started to produce in quantity...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fokker|first1=Anthony|title=Flying Dutchman: The Life of Anthony Fokker|date=1931|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|location=New York|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;"  The D.VIII's immediately ran into trouble with the wing collapsing at high speed.  Fokker recalled the aircraft for further testing, and successfully demonstrated that the reinforced rear spar caused the wings to flex unevenly at speed, increasing the angle of attack at the wing tips and causing the wing to shear apart under the increased loads.  The problem was resolved by restoring the rear spar to its original specifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fokker|first1=Anthony|title=Flying Dutchman: The Life of Anthony Fokker|date=1931|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|location=New York|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weyl also discusses claims of Fokker's outright plagiarism or taking sole credit for the work of his staff, first designer Martin Kreuzer and later Reinhold Platz. For example, contemporary German documents for the E.V/D.VIII refer to Fokker as 'the designer' but Weyl and other authors now suggest that Platz was the real design genius behind the Dr.I, D.VII and D.VIII. There may be some truth in this as Platz recalled to Weyl that he attended high level meetings alongside Fokker but was never introduced or referred-to as the designer and often never even spoke. Yet when Fokker fled Germany it was Platz who immediately took over the German works on Fokker's behalf. Fokker later moved Platz to the Netherlands, as head designer, when the post-war German operation collapsed which indicates Platz really did play a greater design role than Fokker admits. Weyl uncharitably suggests that Platz's role at the Fokker D.VIII crisis meetings was to take the blame if anything was wrong and not receive credit. How much of this interpretation is based on the fact that Platz was still alive to tell his side of the story in 1965, and Fokker was not, is unclear.

Another book by Henri Hegener (who knew both Fokker and Platz personally) depicts a rather different story, saying that Platz, while a skilled craftsman (and excellent welder), had received no formal technical training, and that his contributions to the Fokker designs are exaggerated, although Hegener grants that Platz was a good "rule of thumb" designer. Hegener also contradicts the claims that Platz was treated badly by Fokker, at least not financially because Platz's year-end bonuses often exceeded his yearly salary.&lt;ref name="HegenerFOKKER1961"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hegener|first1=Henri|editor=Bruce Robertson|title=Fokker-the Man and the Aircraft.|year=1961|publisher=Letchworth (UK) / Aero Publishers (US)|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The interrupter gear==
{{main|Synchronization gear}}
Fokker is often credited with having invented the [[Synchronization gear#Fokker's Synchronizer and other German gears|synchronization device]]&lt;ref name="Flying coffin"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guttman|first1=Robert|date=|year=2012 |title=Fokker’s Fabulous Flying Coffin|journal=Aviation History|volume=22|issue=5|page=42|publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which enabled [[World War I]] aircraft to fire through the spinning [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]].  His role was certainly significant but there were a number of prior developments before the result was achieved for which Fokker is commonly credited.

The famous [[France|French]] pilot [[Roland Garros (aviator)|Roland Garros]] was shot down on 18 April 1915. His aircraft had been fitted with a deflector device, whereby metal deflector wedges were fitted to the airscrew.  Garros was able to set fire to the airframe before being taken prisoner but the aircraft's gun and the armoured propeller remained intact and came into [[Germany|German]] hands.&lt;ref name="van Wyngarden"&gt;van Wyngarden, G. ''Early German Aces of World War 1.'' Oxford, UK: [[Osprey Publishing]], 2006. {{ISBN|1-84176-997-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This initiated a phase of consideration of the interrupter gear concept in the Imperial German Army Air Service (''[[Luftstreitkräfte]]'').  Fokker was heavily involved in this process but the story of his conception, development and installation of a synchronization device in a period of 48 hours (first found in an authorized biography of Fokker written in 1929) has been shown to be not factual.  The available evidence points to a synchronisation device having been in development with Fokker's company for perhaps six months prior to the capture of Garros' machine.&lt;ref name="van Wyngarden" /&gt; Additionally there were patents filed in France, Germany and Austria-Hungary as far back as 1910 which show a very similar device to that pioneered by Fokker. Author A. J. Weyl suggests that Fokker – or more probably someone on his production team – were aware of these patents. One patentee, Franz Schneider and his employer LVG, later sued Fokker in the German courts and won their case; but Fokker (by now in America) refused to pay up.

However the final result of the development was Fokker's [[pushrod]] control mechanism, ''Gestängesteuerung'', which allowed the aircraft's forward-firing [[machine gun]] to fire only when the propeller was out of the line of fire. As incorporated into the famous Fokker ''Eindecker'', its use directly led to a phase of German air superiority known as the [[Fokker Scourge]].&lt;ref name="Flying coffin" /&gt;  Despite its shock effect on the enemy, the first Fokker interrupters remained unreliable and were prone to failures. Both [[Oswald Boelcke]] and Max Immelmann survived failures which resulted in propellers being shot off and even engines pulled out of their mountings due to the engine becoming unbalanced by the loss of the propeller. Immelmann's eventual death in combat has also been attributed to interrupter gear failure as the aircraft was seen to break up in mid-air while engaged against a [[Royal Flying Corps]] [[Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2|F.E.2b]].

== Other works on aircraft armament ==
Fokker and his armament team, including [[Heinrich Lübbe|Lübbe]] and Leimberger, also worked on lesser known projects, including a multi-barrelled machine gun, known as the [[Fokker-Leimberger]].&lt;ref name="flight"&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1957/1957%20-%200312.html "Motor Guns-A flashback to 1914–18"], ''Flight'', 8 March 1957, pp. 313–314&lt;/ref&gt; Although superficially similar to a [[Gatling]], the action of the Fokker-Leimberger was substantially different. Problems with the gun, especially with ruptured cases, prevented its adoption into production during the war.&lt;ref name="Williams2005"&gt;Anthony G Williams (8 November 2005), [http://www.quarry.nildram.co.uk/Split%20Breech.htm SPLIT BREECH GUNS: THE NUTCRACKER AND THE 40MM MK 18] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614202850/http://www.quarry.nildram.co.uk/Split%20Breech.htm |date=14 June 2007 }}. quarry.nildram.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to the US, Fokker continued to work on the design, but he was ultimately unsuccessful—properly sealing the rotary split-breech was apparently very difficult. A single surviving prototype is known today at the [[Kentucky Military Treasures]].&lt;ref name="moments"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fokker Split Breech Rotary Machine Gun, ca. 1930| url=http://www.lrc.ky.gov/record/Moments10RS/web/KMT%20legislative%20moment%2040.pdf|publisher = lrc.ky.gov / Kentucky Historical Society|quote="This test model of a rotary machine gun built for Dutch designer Anthony Fokker proved unsuccessful because of its inability to seal breech cylinders.

==Return to the Netherlands==
[[File:Anthony Fokker 1934b.jpg|thumb|Fokker in the Netherlands in 1934]]
After the war's end, the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] forbade Germany to build any aircraft or [[aircraft engine]]s. The treaty singled out the Fokker D.VII for destruction or confiscation, the only aircraft to be named in the treaty. In 1919 Fokker returned to the Netherlands and started a new aircraft company, the ''Nederlandse Vliegtuigenfabriek'' (Dutch Aircraft Factory), predecessor to the [[Fokker]] Aircraft Company. Despite the strict disarmament conditions in the Treaty, Fokker did not return home empty-handed: he managed to smuggle six goods trains' worth of [[Fokker D.VII|D.VII]] and [[Fokker C.I|C.I]] military planes and spare parts out of Germany across the German-Dutch border. Author Weyl says that Fokker used 350 railway wagons and made sure that each train was too long to fit into the railway sidings where trains were normally checked for contraband. Weyl quotes Fokker himself as saying that he paid 20,000 Dutch guilders in bribes. The trains included 220 aeroplanes, more than 400 aero engines and much other material. This initial stock enabled him to quickly set up shop, but his focus shifted from military to civil aircraft such as the very successful [[Fokker F.VII]] [[trimotor]].

Fokker's admitted bribery has contributed to his reputation for sharp business practices. Weyl also points out that – in addition to possible criminal charges for the Fokker D.VIII fatal crashes – Fokker also failed to pay taxes to German authorities and actually owed more than 14 million marks.  Fokker's autobiography tells a similar story, but focuses on the rampant corruption, hyper-inflation, economic meltdown, and violent revolutionary forces of the pre-Weimar days.  According to Fokker's account, as WWI progressed, the German High Command became increasingly brazen, even forcing Fokker into German citizenship against his will.  Fokker describes his escape from Germany as a harrowing tale in which he protected as many workers as possible and escaped with less than a quarter of his net worth.  He takes pains to rebuff the claim that he left the country owing any taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fokker|first1=Anthony|title=Flying Dutchman: The Life of Anthony Fokker|date=1931|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|location=New York|pages=221–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
On 25 March 1919, Fokker married Sophie Marie Elisabeth von Morgenland in [[Haarlem]]. This marriage ended in divorce in 1923. In 1927, he married Canadian Violet Eastman in [[New York City]]. On 8 February 1929, she died in a fall from their hotel suite window. The original police report said her death was a suicide, but this was later changed to 'vertigo victim' at the request of her husband's staff. On the subject of his marriages, Fokker wrote, "I have always understood airplanes much better than women. I had more love affairs in my life, and they ended just like the first one, really, because I thought there was nothing that could be more important than my airplanes... I have now learned, by bitter experience, that one must give a little too; in love one has to use one's brain just as much as in business, and perhaps even more".&lt;ref name="HegenerFOKKER1961/2"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henri Hegener|author2=Bruce Robertson (editor)|title=Fokker-the Man and the Aircraft.|year=1961|publisher=Letchworth (UK) / Aero Publishers (US)|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Move to the US and death==
[[File:Anthony.Fokker.grave.jpg|thumb|Fokker's grave in Driehuis]]
In or about 1926 or 1927, Fokker moved to the [[United States]]. Here he established the North American branch of his company, the [[Atlantic Aircraft]] Corporation.

He was the maker of the [[Fokker F-VII]] airplane ''Josephine Ford'' (named after the grand daughter of automobile magnate [[Henry Ford]]), which Lieutenant Commander [[Richard E. Byrd]] and Machinist [[Floyd Bennett]] flew over or near the [[North Pole]] on 9 May 1926.

In 1931, Fokker sold his American aircraft plants to [[General Motors]], whereupon they became the company's General Aviation division.

[[Neville Shute]] in 1934 negotiated with Fokker for a manufacturing licencing agreement for [[Airspeed Ltd]] (England), and found him ''genial, shrewd and helpful'' but ''already a sick man''; and he was difficult to deal with as ''his domestic life was irregular''. He worked ''at all hours and in strange places''. Frequently ''his very efficient legal advisor and secretary could not tell us where he was''. Shute said he was ''a good chooser of men'' and had a ''most efficient staff of Dutchmen and ex-Germans''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Norway |first= Neville Shute  |title= Slide Rule  |accessdate=  |edition=  |origyear=  |year= 1954 |publisher= William Heinemann  |location= London |isbn= |oclc= |page= |pages= 219-221}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

Fokker died at age 49 in New York in 1939 from [[meningitis|pneumococcal meningitis]], after a three-week-long illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A.H.G. Fokker Dies. Airplane Designer.

In 1970, Fokker was inducted into the [[International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor. ''These We Honor: The International Aerospace Hall of Fame''. Donning Co. Publishers, 2006. {{ISBN|978-1-57864-397-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
Fokker's [[nickname]] was ''The [[Flying Dutchman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Fokker, Anthony and Bruce Gould. ''Flying Dutchman: The Life of Anthony Fokker.'' London: George Routledge, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; In popular media, [[Hurd Hatfield]] portrayed him in the 1971 film ''[[Von Richthofen and Brown]]'' and the character [[Roy Fokker]] from the animated series [[Macross]] was named in honor of Anthony Fokker. Fokker is portrayed by [[Craig Kelly (actor)|Craig Kelly]] in the ''[[Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]: Attack of the Hawkmen''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5416">'''Avraham "Avri" Ran''', known as the father of the “[[Hilltop Youth]]” movement, was born in 1955 in [[Nir Hen]]. He lives on the [[West Bank]], is a noted entrepreneur and a guide for the radical settler movement.

==Life==
In the period of his service with the Israeli army (the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]), he served in an elite operations unit, the [[Sayeret Matkal]]. He and his wife Sharona – who had immigrated to Israel from the United States when she was four years old – both  grew up in secular Jewish homes. They later became strictly religious. The couple has ten children.

In 1993, Ran moved with his family to the Jewish community of [[Itamar]], not far from Shechem. In 1997, he ventured beyond the community's borders and pitched his tent on an open, windswept hill more than four kilometers east of Itamar. In 1998, his wife Sharona and the children joined him and they formally named their new settlement [[Giv'ot Olam]] ''(Hills of Eternity)''.

At that time, some claimed he had trespassed both on land that Arabs from a village called [[Yanun]] claimed as their own and on [[Israeli land and property laws|Israeli state lands]], and attacked any Arab who ventured on the property.&lt;ref name="Levinson"&gt;Chaim Levinson, [http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/israeli-hilltop-youth-accuse-their-former-hero-of-stealing-settlers-land.premium-1.500458  Israeli 'hilltop youth' accuse their former hero of stealing settlers' land], at  [[Haaretz]], 31 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The sprawling farm complex they built produces and markets organic eggs, cheese and other locally grown foodstuffs sold under the logo “Giv'ot Olam”.

In March 1995, Ran was arrested and charged with assaulting an Arab farmer who plowed a tractor onto land Ran claimed he owned. He was ordered to be put in house arrest far from his home but soon disappeared, only later to be captured and jailed for five months until the case was closed without conviction. Months earlier, he had been convicted of attacking an Israeli-Arab and was sentenced to a six-month suspended sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/79578|title= Supreme Court: Defendant Motivated by "Ideological Fanaticism" | author= |date= 2005-04-04| work= |publisher= Arutz 7| accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2006, the judge – ruling that she could not establish Ran's claim to the land – instead acquitted him and two other defendants, saying that the Arab claimant's testimony was unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/hilltop-youth-leader-avri-ran-acquitted-1.62423| title=Hilltop youth leader Avri Ran acquitted |author= Zvi Bar'el |date= 2006-01-17|work= |publisher= Haaretz|accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business interests==
Ran has developed a flourishing organic agricultural business in organic farming that sells produce throughout Israel worth tens of millions of [[shekel]]s. The quality of his natively grown and packaged foodstuffs are legendary. In 2013, some residents of the nearby town of Itamar, where Ran is recognized for his tireless work to settle the Land of Israel with Jewish Israeli citizens and revitalize the original agriculture of the local land, known for its fertility from accounts in the Bible, claimed he had taken over land, an 866 meter high hill, Mitzpeh Shloshet Hayamim, which they asserted belongs to Itamar. They stated that he had bulldozed it to expand the infrastructure of his own enterprise. The location of the hill in question is also under dispute. Some claim that it lies outside the official jurisdiction of the regional governing authority, the [[Samaria Regional Council]].&lt;ref name="Levinson" /&gt;

==Criminal Convictions==

*April 1997. Assault for attacking a disabled pedestrian.
*May 1997. Interfering with a police officer while the latter was performing his duties.
*March 2004. Assault of a left-wing activist near his farm.
*November 2004. Assault of an Israeli Arab dispatched by the [[JNF]] to work on the Itamar settlement.
*September 2006. Fighting in a public location.&lt;ref name="Levinson"/&gt;

==Notable remarks==
&lt;blockquote&gt;'The Arabs are not afraid of me. They revere me. They are wary of me, yes. Have I set out regulations? Certainly. There is not one Arab in the Nablus region who dares to work contrary to my rules. Every Arab knows this. What does this say? This says that there is a Jew in town, a son of Abraham our father-that the ancient Jews have returned a little to the Land of Israel. And a Jew must be respected..'&lt;ref&gt;Lela Gilbert

[[File:Cumulative Current Account Balance per capita.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Cumulative current account balance '''per capita''' 1980–2008 based on [[International Monetary Fund]] data.]]

The '''balance of trade''', '''commercial balance''', or '''net exports''' (sometimes symbolized as '''NX'''), is the difference between the monetary value of a nation's [[exports]] and [[imports]] over a certain period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Sullivan |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) |first2=Steven M. |last2=Sheffrin |title=Economics: Principles in Action |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2003 |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458 |page=462 |isbn=0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes a distinction is made between a balance of trade for goods versus one for services. "Balance of trade" can be a misleading term because trade measures a ''flow'' of exports and imports over a given period of time, rather than a ''balance'' of exports and imports at a given point in time. Also, balance of trade does not mean that exports and imports are "in balance" with each other or anything else.

If a country exports a greater value than it imports, it has a '''trade surplus''' or '''positive balance''', and conversely, if a country imports a greater value than it exports, it has a '''trade deficit''' or '''negative balance.''' [[List of countries by net exports|About 60 out of 200 countries have a trade surplus]]. The notion that bilateral trade deficits are bad in and of themselves is overwhelmingly rejected by trade experts and economists.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/09/upshot/what-is-the-trade-deficit.html|title=What Is the Trade Deficit?|last=|first=|date=2018-06-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-06-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|quote=The vast majority of economists view it differently. In this mainstream view, trade deficits are not inherently good or bad. They can be either, depending on circumstances.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
[[File:Balance of trade in goods and services (Eurozone countries).png|thumb|Balance of trade in goods and services (Eurozone countries)]]
[[File:US Trade Balance 1980 2010.svg|thumb|US Trade Balance 1980 2010]]
[[File:U.S. Trade Balance (1895–2015) and Trade Policies.png|thumb|U.S. Trade Balance and Trade Policy (1895–2015)]]
[[File:U.K. balance of trade in goods (since 1870).png|thumb|U.K. balance of trade in goods (since 1870)]]
The balance of trade forms part of the [[current account]], which includes other transactions such as income from the [[net international investment position]] as well as international aid. If the current account is in surplus, the country's net international asset position increases correspondingly. Equally, a deficit decreases the net international asset position.

The trade balance is identical to the difference between a country's output and its domestic demand (the difference between what goods a country produces and how many goods it buys from abroad; this does not include money re-spent on foreign stock, nor does it factor in the concept of importing goods to produce for the domestic market).

Measuring the balance of trade can be problematic because of problems with recording and collecting data. As an illustration of this problem, when official data for all the world's countries are added up, exports exceed imports by almost 1%; it appears the world is running a positive balance of trade with itself. This cannot be true, because all transactions involve an equal [[credit (finance)|credit]] or [[debit]] in the account of each nation. The discrepancy is widely believed to be explained by transactions intended to launder money or evade taxes, smuggling and other visibility problems. Especially for developing countries, the transaction statistics are likely to be inaccurate.

Factors that can affect the balance of trade include:
* The cost of production (land, labor, capital, taxes, incentives, etc.) in the exporting economy ''vis-à-vis'' those in the importing economy;
* The cost and availability of raw materials, intermediate goods and other inputs;
* Currency exchange rate movements;
* Multilateral, bilateral and unilateral taxes or restrictions on trade;
* Non-tariff barriers such as environmental, health or safety standards;
* The availability of adequate foreign exchange with which to pay for imports; and
* Prices of goods manufactured at home (influenced by the responsiveness of supply)

In addition, the trade balance is likely to differ across the [[business cycle]]. In export-led growth (such as oil and early industrial goods), the balance of trade will shift towards exports during an economic expansion.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} However, with domestic demand-led growth (as in the United States and Australia) the trade balance will shift towards imports at the same stage in the business cycle.

The monetary balance of trade is different from the physical balance of trade&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=6542|title=Physical Trade Balance, OECD Glossary of Statistical Terms|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which is expressed in amount of raw materials, known also as Total Material Consumption). Developed countries usually import a lot of raw materials from developing countries. Typically, these imported materials are transformed into finished products, and might be exported after adding value. Financial trade balance statistics conceal material flow. Most developed countries have a large physical trade deficit, because they consume more raw materials than they produce. Many{{who|date=May 2016}} civil society organisations claim this imbalance is predatory and campaign for [[ecological debt]] repayment.

==Historical examples==
{{See also|Foreign trade of the United States}}
Many countries in early modern Europe adopted a policy of [[mercantilism]], which theorized that a trade surplus was beneficial to a country, among other elements such as [[colonialism]] and [[trade barrier]]s with other countries and their colonies.  ([[Bullionism]] was an early philosophy supporting mercantilism.)
[[File:Merchandise exports (1870-1992).png|thumb|Merchandise exports (1870–1992)]]
[[File:Trade policy, exports and growth in selected European countries.png|thumb|Trade policy, exports and growth in selected European countries]]

The practices and abuses of mercantilism led the natural resources and cash crops of [[British North America]] to be exported in exchange for finished goods from Great Britain, a factor leading to the [[American Revolution]]. An early statement appeared in ''Discourse of the Common Wealth of this Realm of England'', 1549: "We must always take heed that we buy no more from strangers than we sell them, for so should we impoverish ourselves and enrich them."&lt;ref&gt;Now attributed to [[Thomas Smith (diplomat)|Sir Thomas Smith]]; quoted in [[José Rizal]], ''The Wheels of Commerce'', vol. II of ''Civilization and Capitalism 15th–18th Century'', 1979:204.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly a systematic and coherent explanation of balance of trade was made public through [[Thomas Mun]]'s 1630 "England's treasure by foreign trade, or, The balance of our foreign trade is the rule of our treasure"&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Mun, Oxford National Dictionary of Biography&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid-1980s, the [[United States Balance of trade|United States has had a growing deficit in tradeable goods]], especially with Asian nations (China and Japan) which now hold large sums of U.S debt that has in part funded the consumption.&lt;ref name=Bivens&gt;Bivens, L. Josh (14 December 2004). [http://www.epinet.org/Issuebriefs/203/ib203.pdf Debt and the dollar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041217041437/http://www.epinet.org/Issuebriefs/203/ib203.pdf |date=17 December 2004 }} ''Economic Policy Institute''. Retrieved on 8 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=debt&gt;[http://www.treas.gov/tic/mfh.txt Major foreign holders of Treasury securities]. United States Treasury.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. has a trade surplus with nations such as Australia. The issue of trade deficits can be complex. Trade deficits generated in tradeable goods such as manufactured goods or software may impact domestic employment to different degrees than do trade deficits in raw materials.

Economies which have savings surpluses, such as Japan and Germany, typically run trade surpluses. China, a high-growth economy, has tended to run trade surpluses. A higher savings rate generally corresponds to a trade surplus. Correspondingly, the U.S. with its lower savings rate has tended to run high trade deficits, especially with Asian nations.

==Views on economic impact==
The notion that bilateral trade deficits are bad in and of themselves is overwhelmingly rejected by trade experts and economists.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/03/06/economists-take-aim-at-trump-trade-theory-again-peter-navarro-bilateral-multilateral-trade-deals-china-germany-national-security/|title=Economists Take Aim at Trump Trade Theory — Again|last=Gramer|first=Robbie|date=March 6, 2017|work=[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]|access-date=March 12, 2017|quote=Navarro’s comments drew skepticism from trade experts and economists across the political spectrum, who said that line of thinking on economics was flawed. Economists say trade deficits aren’t an indication of good or bad economic times, but rather a function of savings and investments. (The United States enjoyed a stellar trade surplus during the Great Depression in the 1930s, for example.) “He won’t find economists — either on the left or the right — that believe trade deficits are this huge a problem,” Chip Roh, a former assistant U.S. trade representative and trade lawyer, told Foreign Policy. “It doesn’t make economic sense.” “When economists hear, ‘Our goal is reduce the trade deficit,’ it baffles us,” Gordon Hanson, a trade economist at the University of California, San Diego, told FP. “He’s either using it as a cheap political ploy or there’s a misconception&amp;nbsp;— he doesn’t understand how it operates.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/03/07/trump-rails-against-the-trade-deficit-but-economists-say-theres-no-easy-way-for-him-to-make-it-go-away/|title=Analysis: Trump rails against trade deficit, but economists say there’s no easy way for him to make it go away|last=|first=|date=|work=Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 12, 2017|quote=At a conference Monday morning in Washington, Peter Navarro, the director of Trump’s National Trade Council, reiterated the administration’s focus on the trade deficit. The Trump administration policy is one of “free and fair and truly reciprocal trade that begins and ends with the belief that bilateral trade deficits do indeed matter,” he said. “Trade deficits not only matter when it comes to jobs and growth and national security, they matter a great deal,” Navarro said. Many economists disagree with this claim, saying that the factors behind the trade balance can be complex — and that the trade deficit is far from the best economic metric for policymakers to target... In an interview Monday, Angus Deaton, who won the Nobel Prize for economics in 2015, called the administration’s attitude on trade deficits “an old-fashioned mercantilist position.” “If you stand on a platform, it makes you six inches taller,” he said. “It’s a ridiculous argument.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-03-01/trump-warns-trade-deficits-economists-say-who-cares|title=Trump warns of trade deficits.

===Classical theory===

====Adam Smith on the balance of trade====
{{See also|Friedrich List}}
"In the foregoing part of this chapter I have endeavoured to show, even upon the principles of the commercial system, how unnecessary it is to lay extraordinary restraints upon the importation of goods from those countries with which the balance of trade is supposed to be disadvantageous.
Nothing, however, can be more absurd than this whole doctrine of the balance of trade, upon which, not only these restraints, but almost all the other regulations of commerce are founded. When two places trade with one another, this [absurd] doctrine supposes that, if the balance be even, neither of them either loses or gains; but if it leans in any degree to one side, that one of them loses and the other gains in proportion to its declension from the exact equilibrium." (Smith, 1776, book IV, ch. iii, part ii)
&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Adam. (1776). An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 1981, 2 vols., (1776) (reprint of the Clarendon Press edition, Oxford 1976, with Edward Cannan's original index from 1922)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Keynesian theory===

In the last few years of his life, [[John Maynard Keynes]] was much preoccupied with the question of balance in international trade. He was the leader of the British delegation to the [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference]] in 1944 that established the [[Bretton Woods system]] of international currency management.
He was the principal author of a proposal – the so-called Keynes Plan – for an [[International Clearing Union]]. The two governing principles of the plan were that the problem of settling outstanding balances should be solved by 'creating' additional 'international money', and that debtor and creditor should be treated almost alike as disturbers of equilibrium. In the event, though, the plans were rejected, in part because "American opinion was naturally reluctant to accept the principle of equality of treatment so novel in debtor-creditor relationships".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|author=Crowther, Geoffrey|title=An Outline of Money|version=Second Edition|publisher= Thomas Nelson and Sons|year=1948|pages=326–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new system is not founded on free-trade (liberalisation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deregulate.asp|title=Deregulation|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=25 November 2003|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of foreign trade&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade-liberalization.asp|title=Trade Liberalization|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=3 April 2010|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) but rather on the regulation of international trade, in order to eliminate trade imbalances: the nations with a surplus would have a powerful incentive to get rid of it, and in doing so they would automatically clear other nations deficits.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1127&amp;context=peri_workingpapers&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed a global bank that would issue its own currency – the bancor – which was exchangeable with national currencies at fixed rates of exchange and would become the unit of account between nations, which means it would be used to measure a country's trade deficit or trade surplus. Every country would have an overdraft facility in its bancor account at the International Clearing Union. He pointed out that surpluses lead to weak global aggregate demand – countries running surpluses exert a "negative externality" on trading partners, and posed far more than those in deficit, a threat to global prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/05/reform-euro-or-bin-it-greece-germany|title=Reform the euro or bin it - Joseph Stiglitz|first=Joseph|last=Stiglitz|date=5 May 2010|website=the Guardian|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''"National Self-Sufficiency" The Yale Review, Vol. 22, no. 4 (June 1933)'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uam.es/personal_pdi/economicas/jsanchez/documentos/1601%20KEYNES%20National%20Self-sufficiency%201933.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.india-seminar.com/2009/601/601_david_singh_grewali.htm|title=601 David Singh Grewal, What Keynes warned about globalization|website=www.india-seminar.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he already highlighted the problems created by free trade .

His view, supported by many economists and commentators at the time, was that creditor nations may be just as responsible as debtor nations for disequilibrium in exchanges and that both should be under an obligation to bring trade back into a state of balance. Failure for them to do so could have serious consequences. In the words of [[Geoffrey Crowther, Baron Crowther|Geoffrey Crowther]], then editor of [[The Economist]], "If the economic relationships between nations are not, by one means or another, brought fairly close to balance, then there is no set of financial arrangements that can rescue the world from the impoverishing results of chaos."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Crowther, Geoffrey|title=An Outline of Money|version=Second Edition|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons
|year=1948|page=336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ideas were informed by events prior to the [[Great Depression]] when – in the opinion of Keynes and others – international lending, primarily by the U.S., exceeded the capacity of sound investment and so got diverted into non-productive and speculative uses, which in turn invited default and a sudden stop to the process of lending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Crowther, Geoffrey| title=An Outline of Money|version=Second Edition|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons|year=1948|pages= 368–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by Keynes, economics texts in the immediate post-war period put a significant emphasis on balance in trade. For example, the second edition of the popular introductory textbook, ''An Outline of Money'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Crowther, Geoffrey|title=An Outline of Money|version= Second Edition|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons|year=1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; devoted the last three of its ten chapters to questions of foreign exchange management and in particular the 'problem of balance'. However, in more recent years, since the end of the [[Bretton Woods system]] in 1971, with the increasing influence of [[monetarist]] schools of thought in the 1980s, and particularly in the face of large sustained trade imbalances, these concerns – and particularly concerns about the destabilising effects of large trade surpluses – have largely disappeared from [[mainstream economics]] discourse&lt;ref&gt;See for example, Krugman, P and Wells, R (2006). "Economics", Worth Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; and Keynes' insights have slipped from view.&lt;ref&gt;although see Duncan, R (2005). "The Dollar Crisis: Causes, Consequences, Cures", Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; They are receiving some attention again in the wake of the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example,{{cite web|url= http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2008/11/18/clearing-up-this-mess/|title=Clearing Up This Mess| date=18 November 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090123161345/http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2008/11/18/clearing-up-this-mess/| archivedate= 23 January 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monetarist theory===
Prior to 20th century monetarist theory, the 19th century economist and philosopher [[Frédéric Bastiat]] expressed the idea that trade deficits actually were a manifestation of profit, rather than a loss. He proposed as an example to suppose that he, a Frenchman, exported French wine and imported British coal, turning a profit. He supposed he was in France, and sent a cask of wine which was worth 50 francs to England. The customhouse would record an export of 50 francs. If, in England, the wine sold for 70 francs (or the pound equivalent), which he then used to buy coal, which he imported into France, and was found to be worth 90 francs in France, he would have made a profit of 40 francs. But the customhouse would say that the value of imports exceeded that of exports and was trade deficit against the ledger of France.

By ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', Bastiat argued that the national trade deficit was an indicator of a successful economy, rather than a failing one. Bastiat predicted that a successful, growing economy would result in greater trade deficits, and an unsuccessful, shrinking economy would result in lower trade deficits. This was later, in the 20th century, echoed by economist [[Milton Friedman]].

In the 1980s, [[Milton Friedman]], a [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Memorial Prize]]-winning economist and a proponent of [[monetarism]], contended that some of the concerns of trade deficits are unfair criticisms in an attempt to push macroeconomic policies favorable to exporting industries.

Friedman argued that trade deficits are not necessarily important, as high exports raise the value of the currency, reducing aforementioned exports, and vice versa for imports, thus naturally removing trade deficits ''not due to investment''. Since 1971, when the Nixon administration decided to abolish fixed exchange rates, America's Current Account accumulated trade deficits have totaled $7.75 trillion as of 2010. This deficit exists as it is matched by investment coming into the United States – purely by the definition of the balance of payments, any current account deficit that exists is matched by an inflow of foreign investment.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the U.S. had experienced high inflation and Friedman's policy positions tended to defend the stronger dollar at that time. He stated his belief that these trade deficits were not necessarily harmful to the economy at the time since the currency comes back to the country (country A sells to country B, country B sells to country C who buys from country A, but the trade deficit only includes A and B). However, it may be in one form or another including the possible tradeoff of foreign control of assets. In his view, the "worst-case scenario" of the currency never returning to the country of origin was actually the best possible outcome: the country actually purchased its goods by exchanging them for pieces of cheaply made paper. As Friedman put it, this would be the same result as if the exporting country burned the dollars it earned, never returning it to market circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ideachannel.tv/|title=TheIdeaChannel.tv|website=www.ideachannel.tv|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This position is a more refined version of the theorem first discovered by [[David Hume]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hume, David|title=Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hume argued that England could not permanently gain from exports, because hoarding gold (i.e., currency) would make gold more plentiful in England; therefore, the prices of English goods would rise, making them less attractive exports and making foreign goods more attractive imports. In this way, countries' trade balances would balance out.

Friedman presented his analysis of the balance of trade in ''[[Free to Choose]]'', widely considered his most significant popular work.

===Trade balance’s effects upon a nation's GDP===
Exports directly increase and imports directly reduce a nation's balance of trade (i.e. net exports). A trade surplus is a positive net balance of trade, and a trade deficit is a negative net balance of trade. Due to the balance of trade being explicitly added to the calculation of the nation's gross domestic product using the expenditure method of calculating gross domestic product (i.e. GDP), trade surpluses are contributions and trade deficits are "drags" upon their nation's GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expenditure-method.asp|title=Expenditure Method|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=11 May 2010|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/methodologies/index.htm#national_meth|title=Bureau of Economic Analysis|first=US Department of Commerce, BEA, Bureau of Economic|last=Analysis|website=www.bea.gov|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/gross-domestic-product|title=gross domestic product - Definition &amp; Formula|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Drummond was raised and had the greater part of his career in Toronto, and traded in the Toronto futures exchanges in the 1970s and 1980s as he developed his theories.  In the late 1980s he relocated to Nova Scotia where he maintained an organic farm and wrote many of his works on [[technical analysis]].

'''Christian counseling''' is distinct from secular [[Counseling psychology|counseling]]. According to the International Association of Biblical Counselors, Biblical counseling "seeks to carefully discover those areas in which a [[Christian]] may be disobedient to the principles and commands of Scripture and to help him learn how to lovingly submit to God's will."{{Third-party-inline|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christian Counseling|url=https://www.allaboutgod.com/christian-counseling.htm|website=All About God|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian counselors, therefore, approach [[psychology]] through the lens of the [[Bible]].{{Third-party-inline|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lelek|first1=Jeremy|title=Biblical Counseling Defined|url=http://christiancounseling.com/content/biblical-counseling-defined|website=Association of Biblical Counselors|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They see the Bible as the source of all truth.

==History==
Christian counseling began in the end of the 1960s leading into the 1970s with the Biblical Counseling Movement directed by [[Jay E. Adams]] which brought to attention in his book ''Competent to Counsel'', a Christian-based approach which differed from the psychological and psychiatric solutions of the time. He was a devout [[Protestant]] who believed that it was the job of the church to heal people who he believed were morally corrupt, but labeled by society as mentally ill. He rejected other models of counseling, such as the [[medical model]], which gave clients a medical diagnosis based on a list of their behaviors or actions.  Adams believed the lists of maladaptive behaviors listed under each diagnostic category were actually behaviors emanating from our volitional nature, rather than an illness.  Maladaptive behaviors are a matter of [[sin]] and therefore subject to confrontation and education in God's word, exhorting the client to choose behavior that is obedient to God's word, thus removing the sin in their life.  Adams disagreed with any attempt to reclassify behavior that removed people from complete responsibility for their choices.

Adams gained converts but also lost popularity among people as well.{{clarify|1=What does "lost popularity among people mean? Which people? Professionals? Was he "popular" before he wrote the book?|date=December 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Powlison|first1=David|title=The Biblical Counseling Movement|date=2010|publisher=New Growth Press|location=Greensboro|isbn=978-1-935273-13-4}}&lt;!--|accessdate=4 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Adam's model of Nouthetic counseling identifies many scriptures that a counselor may use to exhort clients to change their behavior and come into obedience and away from sin.  The term "Nouthetic" is derived from the Greek word "noutheteo", meaning "to admonish".

Prior to this movement, counseling had become something more secular and not associated with the church. People such as [[Charles Darwin]], who questioned the book of Genesis and how life began in his book ''Origin of Species'' published in 1859. This caused panic in the church because it called into question everything that the church believed at the time. Following in that direction, Later [[Wilhelm Wundt]], a main contributor to the scientific method, introduced it to psychology and claimed that one's biological makeup was the reason why humans are the way they are. He was one of the main drivers behind psychology being looked at in the scientific realm. In addition to Wundt, [[Sigmund Freud]] believed that the church had failed to counsel in the correct way, so he came up with [[psychotherapy]], "the talking therapy", apart from the church. These were driving factors behind why the responsibility of counseling was moved away from the church and began to be secularized. The Church began to fall behind the ever-changing scientific field that seemed to blossom quickly. When Adams did come along he brought the attention back to the church but his influence faded in the 1980s only to be continued by [[David Powlison]]. Powlison converted to Christianity in his adult life and was extremely influential in this movement, publishing a journal, the ''Journal of Biblical Counseling'', which made his beliefs known.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Because of his work, Biblical counselors reflected on their movement and began to seek ways that it could improve which had never really been called to question before. His aim was to advance what had already been started by Adams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lambert|first1=Heath|title=The Biblical Counseling Movement After Adams|date=2012|publisher=Crossway|isbn=978-1-4335-2813-2|pages=30–33}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integration with psychology==
Efforts to combine counseling, psychotherapy or other scientific or academic endeavors with Christian or other religious perspectives or approaches are sometimes called "integration".  Integration of academic subjects with [[theology]] has a long history in academia and continues in many colleges and universities that have continued their founding religious underpinnings.&lt;ref name=stevenson07&gt;{{cite book |title = Psychology &amp; Christianity integration: Seminal works that shaped the movement |last1 =Stevenson |first1 = Daryl H. | first2 = Brian E | last2 = Eck | first3 = Peter C | last3 = Hill |year=2007 |publisher=[[Christian Association for Psychological Studies]] |location=Batavia, IL |isbn=978-0-9792237-0-9 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jCF1dwlLq6YC}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple kinds of integration, as it has been defined differently over the years. The way in which Christianity has been integrated with psychology thus far is by considering the ways in which psychology and the [[Bible]] agree and not integrating the teachings of psychology that don't agree with the Bible. While this tactic is still in progress and continuing to be looked at, there have been significant efforts to try and integrate the two. [[Stanton Jones]] and [[Richard Buteman]] came up with a list of three different methods on how to integrate psychology and the Christian faith. The methods are called pragmatic eclecticism, metatheoretical eclecticism, and theoretical integration. The first method, pragmatic eclecticism, looks at the best solutions for resolving patients' problems based on previous research comparing different methods that have been used. The second method is concerned with the effectiveness of the counselor and looks at the tactics they are using that are beneficial and those that are not. The third method takes theories that are previously existing and makes that the baseline from which further research can build upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Stanton|last2=Buteman|first2=Richard|title=Modern psychotherapies: A comprehensive Christian appraisal|publisher=InterVarsity Press|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; What all integrators of Christianity and psychology do believe as underlying truth is that all truth is God's truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stevenson|first1=Daryl|last2=Ick|first2=Brian|last3=Hill|first3=Peter|title=Psychology &amp; Christianity Integration: Seminal Works that Shaped the Movement|date=2007|publisher=Christian Association for Psychological Studies|location=Batavia, Illinois|isbn=978-0-9792237-0-9}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
Christian counseling focuses on a few main principles. It focuses on the care of the whole person, body, soul and spirit, as it is also sometimes named "soul-care", and maintains the values taught in the Bible. The aim of Christian counseling is to help people regain a sense of hope for their life that is found in [[Jesus Christ]]. Christian counseling believes that at the core of what they do is to help others achieve a better understanding of themselves and God which is rooted in the [[Holy Spirit]]'s conviction. Christian counselors seek to make people aware of the sin in their lives that has caused them suffering but also come to know the immense worth and value they have as a person to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clinton|first1=Timothy|last2=Ohlschlager|first2=George|title=Competent Christian Counseling|date=1984|publisher=Waterbrook Press|location=Colorado Springs, Colorado|isbn=978-1-57856-517-7}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Jay E. Adams]] published ''Competent to Counsel'' in 1970, criticizing the influence of psychology throughout Christian counseling. He began the [[Nouthetic counseling]] movement which teaches that the Bible alone is sufficient for all counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.nanc.org/About-NANC/History | title = About | contribution = History | publisher = NANC}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While Nouthetic counseling is strictly based on the Biblical scriptures and the power of the Holy Spirit separate from any psychological implementations, Christian counseling tries to implement psychology and Christianity still keeping God and biblical truths in the picture. While they do not take psychology as the absolute answer or solution to problems that people face, it is used as a tool in unity with Christianity to help people have a deeper understanding of themselves and God. Though some Christians do reject the teachings of science completely, others think that science and Christianity can be integrated, which Christian counseling aims to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wallace|first1=Ken|title=Integrating Psychology and Christianity|url=http://www.northforest.org/SocialCulturalTopics/psychology.html#references|website=Integrating Psychology and Christianity|accessdate=4 December 2014}}{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''computer reservation system''' or '''central reservation system'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaweb.net/global-distribution-systems/central-reservation-system.html |title=Central Reservation System &amp;#124; Online Hotel Marketing Services, Hong Kong and Philippines Hotel, Spa and Restaurant Software |publisher=Iaweb.net |date=2010-07-06 |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''CRS''') is a [[computer]]ized system used to store and retrieve information and conduct transactions related to [[air travel]], [[hotel]]s, [[car rental]], or other activities. Originally designed and operated by airlines, CRSs were later extended for the use of [[travel agency|travel agencies]]. [[Global distribution system]]s (GDS) book and sell tickets for multiple airlines. Most airlines have [[outsource]]d their CRSs to GDS companies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The ineluctable middlemen |url= http://www.economist.com/node/21560866 |newspaper=The Economist |date=25 August 2012 |accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also enable consumer access through [[Internet]] gateways. Modern GDS's typically allow users to book hotel rooms, rental cars, airline tickets as well as other activities and tours. They also provide access to railway reservations and bus reservations in some markets, although these are not always integrated with the main system. These are also used to relay computerized information for users in the hotel industry, making reservation and ensuring that the hotel is not overbooked. 

[[Airline reservations system]]s may be integrated into a larger [[passenger service system]], which also includes an airline inventory system and a [[departure control system]].

==History==

===Origins===
In 1946, [[American Airlines]] installed the first automated booking system, the experimental [[electromechanical]] [[Reservisor]]. A newer machine with temporary storage based on a [[magnetic drum]], the Magnetronic Reservisor, soon followed. This system proved successful, and was soon being used by several airlines, as well as [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton Hotels]] and [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] for [[inventory]] control. It was seriously hampered by the need for local human operators to do the actual lookups; ticketing agents would have to call a booking office, whose operators would direct a small team operating the Reservisor and then read the results over the telephone. There was no way for agents to directly query the system.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The [[MARS (ticket reservation system)|MARS-1]] train ticket reservation system was designed and planned in the 1950s by the [[Japanese National Railways]]' R&amp;D Institute, now the [[Railway Technical Research Institute]], with the system eventually being produced by [[Hitachi]] in 1958.&lt;ref name="mars1"&gt;[http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/computer/dawn/0030.html 【Hitachi and Japanese National Railways】 MARS-1], [[Information Processing Society of Japan]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the world's first seat reservation system for trains.&lt;ref name="dawn"&gt;[http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/computer/dawn/history.html Early Computers: Brief History], [[Information Processing Society of Japan]]&lt;/ref&gt; The MARS-1 was capable of reserving seat positions, and was controlled by a [[transistor computer]] with a [[central processing unit]] and a 400,000-bit magnetic drum memory unit to hold seating files. It used many [[Processor register|registers]], to indicate whether seats in a train were vacant or reserved to accelerate searches of and updates to seat patterns, for communications with terminals, printing reservation notices, and [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] displays.&lt;ref name="mars1"/&gt;

===Remote access===
In 1953, [[Trans-Canada Airlines]] (TCA) started investigating a computer-based system with remote [[Computer terminal|terminals]], testing one design on the [[University of Toronto]]'s [[Manchester Mark 1]] machine that summer. Though successful, the researchers found that input and output was a major problem. [[Ferranti Canada]] became involved in the project and suggested a new system using [[punched card]]s and a [[transistor]]ized computer in place of the unreliable [[Vacuum tube|tube]]-based Mark I. The resulting system, [[ReserVec]], started operation in 1962, and took over all booking operations in January 1963. Terminals were placed in all of TCA's ticketing offices, allowing all queries and bookings to complete in about one second with no remote operators needed.

In 1953, American Airlines [[chief executive officer|CEO]] [[C. R. Smith]] chanced to sit next to R. Blair Smith, a senior [[IBM]] sales representative, on a flight from Los Angeles to New York. C.R. invited Blair to visit their Reservisor system and look for ways that IBM could improve the system. Blair alerted [[Thomas Watson, Jr.|Thomas Watson Jr.]] that American was interested in a major collaboration, and a series of low-level studies started. Their idea of an automated [[airline reservations system|airline reservation system]] (ARS) resulted in a 1959 venture known as the [[Sabre (computer system)|Semi-Automatic Business Research Environment]] (SABRE), launched the following year.&lt;ref&gt;R. Blair Smith, OH 34. Oral history interview by Robina Mapstone, May 1980. Charles Babbage Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis. http://www.cbi.umn.edu/oh/display.phtml?id=9&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the network was completed in December 1964, it was the largest civil [[data processing]] system in the world.

Other airlines  established their own systems. [[Pan American World Airways]] launched its [[PANAMAC]] system in 1964. [[Delta Air Lines]] launched the [[Delta Automated Travel Account System]] (DATAS) in 1968. [[United Airlines]] and [[Trans World Airlines]] followed in 1971 with the [[Apollo Reservation System]] and [[Programmed Airline Reservation System]] (PARS), respectively. Soon, travel agents began pushing for a system that could automate their side of the process by accessing the various ARSes directly to make reservations. Fearful this would place too much power in the hands of agents, American Airlines executive [[Robert Crandall]] proposed creating an industry-wide computer reservation system to be a central clearing house for U.S. travel; other airlines demurred, citing fear of [[United States antitrust law|antitrust prosecution]].

===Travel agent access===
In 1976, United began offering its Apollo system to travel agents; while it would not allow the agents to book tickets on United's competitors, the marketing value of the convenient terminal proved indispensable. SABRE, PARS, and DATAS were soon released to travel agents as well. Following [[Airline Deregulation Act|airline deregulation]] in 1978, an efficient CRS proved particularly important; by some counts, [[Texas Air]] executive [[Frank Lorenzo]] purchased money-losing [[Eastern Air Lines]] specifically to gain control of its SystemOne CRS.

Also in 1976 [[Videcom international]] with [[British Airways]], [[British Caledonian]] and CCL launched [[Travicom]], the world's first multi-access reservations system (wholly based on Videcom technology), forming a network providing distribution for initially two and subsequently 49 subscribing international airlines (including British Airways, British Caledonian, [[TWA]], [[Pan American World Airways]], [[Qantas]], [[Singapore Airlines]], [[Air France]], [[Lufthansa]], [[Scandinavian Airlines System|SAS]], [[Air Canada]], [[KLM]], [[Alitalia]], [[Cathay Pacific]] and [[Japan Airlines|JAL]]) to thousands of travel agents in the UK. It allowed agents and airlines to communicate via a common distribution language and network, handling 97% of UK airline business trade bookings by 1987. The system went on to be replicated by Videcom in other areas of the world including the Middle East (DMARS), New Zealand, Kuwait (KMARS), Ireland, Caribbean, United States and Hong Kong. Travicom was a trading name for Travel Automation Services Ltd.   When BA (who by then owned 100% of Travel Automation Services Ltd) chose to participate in the development of the Galileo system Travicom changed its trading name to Galileo UK and a migration process was put in place to move agencies from Travicom to Galileo.

European airlines also began to invest in the field in the 1980s initially by deploying their own reservation systems in their homeland, propelled by growth in demand for travel as well as technological advances which allowed GDSes to offer ever-increasing services and searching power. In 1987, a consortium led by Air France and West Germany's Lufthansa developed [[Amadeus (computer system)|Amadeus]], modeled on SystemOne. Amadeus Global Travel Distribution was launched in 1992. In 1990, Delta, [[Northwest Airlines]], and Trans World Airlines formed [[Worldspan]], and in 1993, another consortium (including British Airways, KLM, and [[United Airlines]], among others) formed the competing company [[Galileo CRS|Galileo International]] based on Apollo. Numerous smaller companies such as [[KIU System (CRS&amp;GDS)|KIU]] have also formed, aimed at niche markets not catered for by the four largest networks, including the [[low-cost carrier]] segment, and small and medium size domestic and regional airlines.

*Sabre Holdings was purchased by private investors [[Silver Lake Partners]] and [[Texas Pacific Group]] on March 30, 2007, for about US$5 billion.  Full year 2008 Sabre Holdings revenues were about US$3 billion.
*In December 2006, [[Travelport]], which owns Galileo, agreed to buy and merge with the [[Worldspan]] GDS. The combined company would then control a 46.3% market share using 2002 airline booking data.
*Worldspan's market share is 16.9% globally and 31% in the U.S. according to 2006 [[MIDT]] airline transaction data.
*In March 2007, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines switched from its own reservations system (CORDA) to Amadeus as a result of the merger with Air France.
*In February 2010, JetBlue converted its reservation system over to the SabreSonic Customer Sales and Service platform.

==Trends==
For many years the GDSs had a dominant position in the travel industry. To bypass the GDS and avoid high GDS fees, airlines have started to distribute flights directly from their websites.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Michael (2010): Value Creation in Travel Distribution, https://www.amazon.com/dp/0557612462&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility to bypass the GDS are direct connections to the Travel Agencies. [[American Airlines]]' direct connects are a prominent example of this development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://directconnect.aa.com/Default.aspx |title=American Airlines - Direct Connect |publisher=Directconnect.aa.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vice President Joe Biden writing condolence message at Polish Embassy in Washington.jpg|alt=Joe Biden sits at a desk, writing in a book|thumb|Diplomatic message of condolence at an embassy]]
'''Condolences''' (from Latin ''con'' (with) + ''dolere'' (sorrow)) are an expression of sympathy to someone who is experiencing pain arising from death, deep mental anguish, or misfortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/condolence | title=condolence | publisher=Merriam-Webster | accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the word "condolences", in plural, is more common than "condolence". The reason for this habit is unclear,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;searchmode=none&amp;search=condolence etymonline.com search for "condolence"] accessed 2016-06-16&lt;/ref&gt; but it resembles our habit to send someone our 'regards', 'best wishes', greetings'  (all plural), etc.

When individuals condole, or offer their condolences to a particular situation or person, they are offering active, conscious [[Moral support|support]] of that person or activity. This is often expressed by saying, "Sorry". Often, the [[English language]] expression "My condolences" will be in a context, such as [[death]] of a friend's loved one, in which the one offering condolences is communicating a feeling of [[pity]] towards the unfortunate party. Expressions of condolence may also be used as [[sarcasm]] if one considers the complaining person to be exaggerating their suffering, especially when they appear to consider as tragic something that is relatively insignificant.

Condolence is not always expressed in sorrow or grievance, as it can also be used to acknowledge a fellow feeling or even a common opinion.

There are various ways of expressing condolences to the victims. Examples include donating money to the charity nominated by the person who has just died, writing in a condolences book or supporting the friends and family of the loved one by making meals and looking after them in various ways in times of need.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13128">A '''copyright transfer agreement''' is a legal document containing provisions for the conveyance of full or partial [[copyright]] from the rights owner to another party.

== History ==
Copyright transfer agreements became common in the publishing business after the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] in the United States and similar legislation in other countries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1107/S0021889878012753 | title = Transfer of Copyright | journal = Journal of Applied Crystallography | volume = 11 | pages = 63–64 | year = 1978 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; redefined copyright as accruing to the author from the moment of creation (rather than publication) of a work.&lt;ref name=Bachrach1998/&gt; This required publishers to acquire copyrights from the author in order to sell the works or access to it, and written statements signed by the rights owner became necessary in order for the copyright transfer to be considered valid.&lt;ref name=Friedman1982/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap2.html#204 Section 204] of the [[Copyright Act of 1976]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
{{Quotation|The situation in which authors hold the copyright usually involves considerable effort in the form of correspondence and record keeping and often leads to unnecessary delays. Although this may appear to be trivial for a few requests, a good scholarly journal publishing exciting papers can expect several hundred requests per year; a task of this magnitude can become onerous. On the other hand, if the Journal holds the copyright, requests, value judgements, and permissions can be handled expeditiously to the satisfaction of all concerned.|J. Lagowski (1982)&lt;ref name=Lagowski1982/&gt;}}

Granting publishers the permission to copy, display and distribute the work is necessary for publishers to act as such, and copyright transfer agreements across a wide range of publishers have such provisions.&lt;ref name=Gadd2003-4/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gaeta | first1 = T. J. | title = Authorship: "Law" and Order | doi = 10.1111/j.1553-2712.1999.tb00393.x | journal = Academic Emergency Medicine | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 297–301 | year = 1999 | pmid =  10230981| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reach of copyright transfer agreements can go well beyond that, and "[s]ome publishers require that, to the extent possible, copyright be transferred to them."&lt;ref name=Friedman1982/&gt; This means that no one, including the authors, can reuse text, tables, or figures in other publications without first getting permission from the new copyright owner.&lt;ref name="understand"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Berquist | first1 = T. H. | title = The Copyright Transfer Agreement: We Sign It, but Do We Understand It? | doi = 10.2214/AJR.09.2655 | journal = American Journal of Roentgenology | volume = 192 | issue = 4 | pages = 849–851| year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copyright transfer agreements also ask that the authors confirm to actually own the copyright for all the materials pertaining to a given act of publishing, and that the item for which the copyright is to be transferred has not been previously published and is not under consideration to be published elsewhere,&lt;ref name="understand"/&gt; to limit the frequency of [[duplicate publication]] and [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref name=Gadd2003-4/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = I. S. | last2 = Spector | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1088/1748-6041/7/1/010201 | title = Coping with copying and conflicts (of interest) | journal = Biomedical Materials | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 010201 | year = 2012 | pmid =  22287538| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Critics have said that the copyright transfer agreement in commercial scholarly publishing is "as much about ensuring long–term asset management as it is about providing service to the academic community" because the practice seems to grant favor to the publisher in a way that does not obviously benefit the authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Willinsky|first=John|title=Copyright Contradictions in Scholarly Publishing|journal=[[First Monday (journal)|First Monday]]|date=4 November 2002|volume=7|issue=11|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1006/927|accessdate=20 February 2012|doi=10.5210/fm.v7i11.1006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copyright transfer agreements often conflict with [[self-archiving]] practices&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gadd | first1 = E. | last2 = Oppenheim | first2 = C. | last3 = Probets | first3 = S. | doi = 10.1108/00220410310698239 | title = RoMEO studies 1: The impact of copyright ownership on academic author self-archiving | journal = Journal of Documentation | volume = 59 | issue = 3 | pages = 243 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; or appear to do so due to ambiguous language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Coleman | first1 = A. | title = Self-archiving and the Copyright Transfer Agreements of ISI-ranked library and information science journals | doi = 10.1002/asi.20494 | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology | volume = 58 | issue = 2 | pages = 286 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3767615587113113566&amp;q=Storix&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,29 Johnson v. Storix] upheld a copyright transfer involving no written assignment. In that case, the Author, Anthony Johnson sold software as a sole proprietor and incorporated his company in 2003 as Storix, Inc. Eight years later he gave 60% share of the corporation to his employees, who later removed him from the company and claimed ownership of the copyrights. The court upheld a  jury decision that Johnson had made an oral agreement to transfer the copyright to the corporation upon its formation based on an annual report he wrote and signed a year later stating that he had transferred “all assets” from his sole proprietorship. The jury rejected Johnson's claim he intended only to transfer the license to sell the software, and further decided that Johnson became a work for hire upon forming the corporation, thereby also forfeiting all rights to his derivative works. This is the first case in which a document, not itself a contract or agreement and containing no reference to the copyrights, was considered a “note or memorandum” of copyright transfer, and the first time a sole owner of a company was designated a work for hire for copyright ownership purposes. This serves as a lesson that a “writing” required by the Copyright Act need not necessarily be “clear”, but may contain ambiguous language which can be interpreted by course of dealing by third parties to the alleged transaction.  

== Other models ==
Copyright transfer agreements are one way to govern permissions based on copyright. Since the advent of digital publishing, various commentators have pointed out the benefits of author-retained copyright,&lt;ref name=Bachrach1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilbanks2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wilbanks | first1 = J. | authorlink = John Wilbanks| title = Another reason for opening access to research | doi = 10.1136/sbmj.39063.730660.F7 | journal = BMJ | volume = 333 | issue = 7582 | pages = 1306–1308 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17185718 | pmc =1761190 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and publishers have started to implement it&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Watt | first1 = F.

== Author addenda ==
Copyright transfer agreements are usually prepared by the publisher, and some print journals include a copy of the statement in every issue they published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00348410 | title = Forthcoming papers | journal = Applied Physics A: Solids and Surfaces | volume = 59 | pages = A5–A5 | year = 1994 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; If authors wish to deviate from the default phrasing&amp;nbsp;– ''e.g.'', if they want to retain copyright or would not like to grant the publisher an exclusive right to publish&amp;nbsp;– they can specify desired modifications, either by editing the document directly or by attaching an [[addendum#In contracts|addendum]] to a copy of the default version. Publisher policies on the acceptance of such addenda vary, though. Some institutions offer instructions and assistance for staff in creating such addenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Author rights: using the SPARC Author Addendum to secure your rights as the author of a journal article|url=http://www.sparc.arl.org/resources/authors/addendum|work=SPARC|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amend a Publishing Agreement|url=https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/authors/amend|work=Harvard University Library|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3826">[[Image:Downtown Duluth Nov 2005.jpg|thumb|Looking down '''Superior Street''' in downtown Duluth]]

The '''Downtown''' of [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]], [[Minnesota]], United States; is situated between Mesaba Avenue ([[Minnesota State Highway 194|Highway 194]]) and 4th Avenue East; and located on Michigan, Superior, First, Second, and Third Streets.

The downtown area is easily accessible from [[Interstate 35 in Minnesota|Interstate Highway 35]].

As in most cities, the downtown area is home to a number of the city's cultural and social attractions, as well as government offices and business centers.  Duluth's main library is located in downtown, as is the city's foremost museum, the courthouse, city hall, several local restaurants and bars with live music venues, and many of the larger business offices.  Stores and places to eat and drink tend to be locally or regionally owned and operated, with most chain and franchise establishments having located (or re-located) themselves in the "Miller Hill area" around the [[Miller Trunk Corridor|U.S. Highway 53 corridor]].

Most of the downtown is within walking distance of the touristy [[Canal Park (Duluth)|Canal Park]] district.

A large portion of the eastern section of downtown is oriented around Essentia Health–St. Mary's Medical Center and Miller-Dwan Medical Center.

==Buildings==
The downtown area contains a number of historical buildings, many of them dating to the city's peak days in the late 19th century and early 20th.  These include the [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] (Old) [[Central High School (Duluth, Minnesota)|Central High School]] building (now the administrative offices of Duluth's [[school district]]), the Duluth Opera House, and the Union Depot (now a museum), among many others.  Newly constructed ones are less common than older edifices, although some large newer buildings such as the Tech Village are present.

Downtown Duluth is the home of Fond-du-Luth Casino.

==Streets==
[[Image:1st_Avenue_East,_Duluth,_Minnesota_(2006).jpg|250px|thumb|'''1st Avenue East''' rises 520-feet in a one-mile climb up the hillside]]
Streets in Duluth's downtown area features dramatic upward slopes, a feature common to many of Duluth's [[Neighborhoods of Duluth, Minnesota|neighborhoods]] due to 800 feet (240 m) elevation difference between the shore and the hilltop.

As a part of a beautification project during Duluth's economic crisis of the 1980s, several blacktop streets were converted to brick.  Along with this change came the introduction of "old-fashioned" [[Ornament (art)|ornamental]] streetlamps.

==Skywalk==

Due to the city's cold winter temperatures (at times falling well below -20&amp;nbsp;°F / -29&amp;nbsp;°C), a network of skywalks was constructed to provide indoor connectivity between most major buildings.  The [[Skyway|skywalk]] system is augmented by an over-the-freeway enclosed walkway leading to the [[Duluth Entertainment Convention Center]] (DECC) in the [[Canal Park (Duluth)|Canal Park]] district.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15976">[[File:Hannes Androsch.jpg|thumb]]
'''Johannes "Hannes" Androsch''' is an Austrian entrepreneur and consultant; a former Social Democrat top politician who served as an Austrian minister of finance from 1970 to 1981 and additionally as vice chancellor from 1976 to 1981; and a former banker who from 1981 to 1988 was the general director of the Creditanstalt-Bankverein (Austria’s leading bank at that time) and subsequently an advisor to the World Bank. From 1989 onward he built an industrial investment group, Androsch International Consulting (AIC), which is a major factor in Austria's internationally active corporate landscape. In addition, Androsch's foundation is an important sponsor of research and development activities in Austria, where he is regularly consulted on matters of political, economic and financial importance.

== Youth and early political activities ==

Androsch was born on 18 April 1938 in Vienna, where his parents, Hans and Lia, were [[tax advisors]] in the district [[Floridsdorf]]. The family lived through the end of World War II in Southern Bohemia, where they witnessed the [[expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia]] in June 1945.  His mother placed seven-year-old Hannes on the window sill and instructed him to watch the events closely so that he would never forget.&lt;ref&gt;Palme, Liselotte. Androsch. Ein Leben zwischen Geld und Macht. {{ISBN|978-3-453-17851-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Androsch concluded his high school education in Vienna in 1956. He proceeded to study business administration at the University of World Trade (today's [[Vienna University of Economics and Business]]), where he obtained his diploma in 1959, followed by a doctorate in 1969.

His political activities manifested early, and took him to the top position in the Vienna branch of the student organization of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Socialist party]] (1960–1961), and then to leadership of the national organization (1962–1963). Thereafter, at the age of only 25 years, he became secretary for economic issues in the club of the Socialist members of parliament, a position which he held until 1966.

==Rise and fall as a politician==
1967 was a fateful year for Androsch: he was certified as a [[Certified Public Accountant|public accountant]] and tax advisor, allowing him to participate in the financial consulting enterprise which his parents had significantly expanded; and he became a member of parliament for the Socialist party where he earned himself a reputation as a shooting star. When [[Bruno Kreisky]] turned the tables on Austria's political scenery with the [[Austrian legislative election, 1970|1970 national election]] he made the 32-year-old Androsch [[Finance minister]] in his first minority cabinet on 21 April 1970. Androsch continued in this function when the Socialist single-party government consolidated its dominance through the absolute majorities won in the elections of 1971 and 1975. Although he had not been Kreisky's first choice for this position (Schachner-Blazizek and Felix Slavik had declined) the two men developed a working relationship that was, initially, very good. Androsch became a strong advocate of [[Keynesian economics]], in a modification that became known as “Austro-Keynesianism.”

On 1 October 1976 Androsch was made [[Vice-Chancellor of Austria]] while remaining minister of finance. In this capacity he became chairman of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] at ministerial level in 1979, and also served as chairman of the Interim Committee of the [[International Monetary Fund]].

While Androsch had built an excellent political network within the centrist wing of the Socialist party and especially the [[Austrian Trade Union Federation]] (ÖGB), not everybody was happy with his rapid rise. The fact that the Austrian print media, who for the most part venerated Kreisky and had adorned him with the nickname "Sun King," started to refer to Androsch as the "Crown Prince" did not help. When in 1975 Androsch differed with Kreisky on how to handle the reconfiguration of Austria's state-owned industry, and expressed his wish to become president of the national bank
instead of continuing in the government, Kreisky himself became suspicious  of the young man he had mentored for years. He started to take exception to a highly problematic incompatibility that had been public knowledge since Androsch became a member of the government: he still owned the tax advisor company (renamed Consultatio in 1970) which he had taken over from his parents, although he had placed it in [[escrow]] when he became a finance minister.

Towards the end of 1980, after long and intense campaigns by Austria's media and a continued deterioration of his relationship with Kreisky, Androsch resigned from his political positions on 20 January 1981.

==Second career as a banker==
The government appointed Androsch as the governor of the state-owned [[Creditanstalt]], Austria’s leading bank at that time, a little later in 1981. However, he continued to face heavy opposition and revelations made by investigative journalists (especially [[Alfred Worm]]), that culminated in a series of investigations of his personal financial conduct, which in part predated his public role or were not demonstrably connected with it. Androsch has repeatedly stated (and has repeated these allegations in a series of interviews published by the Austrian newspaper "Die Presse" in February and March 2010; see sources) that his Socialist successors in the finance ministry, Herbert Salcher and [[Franz Vranitzky]] (who had been Androsch's secretary, and would later rise to chancellorship) had conspired with Kreisky, "who was simply jealous", (and with political opponent [[Alois Mock]]) to "construe the financial and legal proceedings against him", that would not be finally settled for the following 16 years. "I had no chance to even be heard. And many who have participated in this vendetta would now rather pretend that nothing had ever happened."

A central point of Androsch's defence concerning his personal finances — he claimed that a rich "uncle-by-choice" ("Wahlonkel" in German) had provided him with significant funds, and habitually replied "alas, no" when asked if he was a millionaire — did not hold. On 8 October 1991 Androsch was convicted by the Vienna Regional Criminal Court of having evaded taxes between 1974 and 1983 in the amount of about five million Austrian schillings (roughly corresponding to EUR 500,000 expressed in 2010 currency), a minuscule fraction of the original allegations. He was sentenced to a fine of 1.8 million Austrian schillings.

A legally separate but politically related affair (a conviction for false testimony to the parliamentary examination board investigating the scandal surrounding the [[Vienna General Hospital]]) forced Androsch to resign from the Creditanstalt post in January 1988. With the help of a Swiss member of the [[Bilderberg Group]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.androsch.com/media/news/1218_news_20080410_androschslebensbilanz.pdf Androschs Lebensbilanz] Interview published in NEWS No. 15/2008 (see p. 63)&lt;/ref&gt; he became a consultant to the [[World Bank]], especially for China and parts of Africa, until 1989. Androsch is a former member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bilderbergmeetings.org/former-steering-committee-members.html|title=Former Steering Committee Members|work=bilderbergmeetings.org|publisher=[[Bilderberg Group]]|accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third career as an industrial investor==
In 1989 Androsch founded AIC Androsch International Management Consulting GmbH, which in 1994 commenced its corporate investment and acquisition activity. Its offices are situated at the Ringstraße, opposite the Vienna opera house.

By way of AIC, Androsch is co-owner and president of the supervisory board of the following Austrian companies:

*Austria Technologie und Systemtechnik (AT&amp;S) AG, Europe's largest manufacturer of [[printed circuit boards]] with offices in Vienna and [[Leoben]]
*Salinen Austria AG, Austria's [[salt mining]] and processing company and a significant player in Europe
*bwin.com Interactive Entertainment AG, a developer and marketer of [[online gambling]] and gaming products in Vienna

Former investments of Androsch's holdings included major stakes in Future Advanced Composite Components (FACC) AG in [[Ried im Innkreis]] (acquired by [[Xi'an Aircraft Industrial Corporation]] in 2009) and in [[KTM]] Sportmotorcycle AG. In 2000, he was a major founding investor of Austrian prepaid payment method [[paysafecard]], until it was finally sold to British [[Skrill]] group for 140 million euros in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/economist/1260747/Oesterreichische-Paysafecard-um-140-Mio-Euro-verkauft |title=Österreichische "Paysafecard" um 140 Mio.

Androsch is also president of the supervisory board of the [[Austrian Institute of Technology]] (AIT; formerly Austrian Research Centers, ARC) in [[Seibersdorf]], and deputy chairman of the supervisory board of FIMBAG Finanzmarktbeteiligung AG,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oeiag.at/english/asp/indexchart.asp?id=fimbag FIMBAG company information] [https://www.webcitation.org/5pT7Ijazr Archived]&lt;/ref&gt; the vehicle through which the state-owned [[Österreichische Industrieholding]] controls its stakes in Austrian banking system. He has been chairman of the Council of the [[University of Leoben]].

Following the collapse of [[Refco]], a class-action lawsuitsuit in the US caused considerable difficulties for [[BAWAG P.S.K.]], the Austrian trade union's bank. Androsch and other Austrian investors formed a consortium with [[Cerberus Capital Management]], which acquired the bank in
2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bawagpsk.com/bawagpsk/__UeberUns/Unternehmen/Firmengeschichte/nav__en,setId=bawagpsk,path=_2A125984_2A_2F126866_2F125984_2F122828_2FCR122828_2FCD123146.html BAWAG P.S.K. Company History (2005-2008)] [https://www.webcitation.org/5pT73z6zG Archived]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the Austrian economics magazine ''trend'' estimated Androsch's wealth at EUR 420 million, ranking him 25th among the wealthiest Austrians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oe24.at/oesterreich/Die-reichsten-Oesterreicher/31110 Die reichsten Österreicher] Ranking of the wealthiest Austrians in 2006 by ''trend'' magazine [https://www.webcitation.org/5xN3OIQpi Archived]&lt;/ref&gt; Using a modified rating that also considered networking, the magazine ranked him the 22nd most powerful person in Austria's economy in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Die 100 Mächtigsten in der Wirtschaft. trend 7/2009, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research sponsorships==
On 21 June 2004, the founding session of the Hannes Androsch Foundation within the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] was held. It is dedicated to "the consolidation of social balance and peace." Androsch endowed it with EUR 1 million and committed himself to increase the annual budget to EUR 10 million until 2012. It awards the Hannes Androsch Prize (EUR 100,000 for 2011) for scientific contributions to its goals. According to the academy, this is the most important private non-profit foundation established in Austria since 1945.

Androsch is a member of the fundraising committee of the [[Institute of Molecular Biotechnology]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imba.oeaw.ac.at/support-imba/fundraising-committee/ IMBA fundraising committee website] [https://www.webcitation.org/5pT7aQIHe Archived]&lt;/ref&gt; a joint initiative of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and the pharmaceutical company [[Boehringer Ingelheim]].

==Honors==
Androsch has been awarded a significant number of international honors, among them an honorary doctorate in economics from the [[University of New Orleans]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austrianinformation.org/summer-fall-2009/former-austrian-vice-chancellor-androsch-awarded-honorary-do.html Androsch awarded honorary doctorate] Austrian News Service press release Sept. 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harry Hoxie Bassett''' (September 11, 1874 – October 17, 1926) was an [[Automotive industry in the United States|American automotive industry]] [[Senior management|executive]] and president of Buick Motor Car Company, division of General Motors from 1920 through 1926.

==Early life==
Bassett was born in [[Utica, New York]], the son of Mary (née Babcock) and William Bassett.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York State Census 1905|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:9Q97-YSRQ-MDD?mode=g&amp;i=2&amp;wc=M8SJ-MWR%3A42719101%2C42768601%2C42807501%3Fcc%3D1463113&amp;cc=1463113|website=FamilySearch.org|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bassett had dreams of being a lawyer but without funds to attend law school, he started his manufacturing career directly out of high school working for the Remington Arms Company. He had to request a day off to be able to attend his high school graduation. He worked for Remington Arms for twelve years when [[Charles Stewart Mott]] requested that Bassett become the assistant general manager at Mott's operation in Flint. ([[Billy Durant]] had requested that Mott move his wheel and axle manufacturing company from Utica, New York to [[Flint, Michigan]] to be closer to the Buick Manufacturing operations in Flint). In 1905, Bassett agreed to join Mott and left his position with [[Remington Arms]].&lt;ref name = "forbes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forbes|first1=Bertie Charles|title=Automotive giants of America: Men who made our Motor Industry|date=1926|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=65ZuBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT17&amp;dq=harry+bassett+buick&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-4-Lt7aXMAhXLk4MKHTCpBIoQ6AEINTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=harry%20bassett%20buick&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weston-Mott Operations ==
After becoming abreast of Weston-Mott manufacturing operations in Utica, Bassett left for Flint and within one year was promoted to factory manager. The factory in Flint was new and was placed conveniently next to a new Buick manufacturing operation. By 1909, Durant traded General Motors stock for Weston-Mott stock and acquired 49% ownership of the Weston-Mott enterprise. The remaining 51% was purchased by General Motors in 1913 while the company was under the leadership of [[Charles Williams Nash]] &lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Langworth|first1=Richard M.|last2=NOrbye|first2=Jan P.|title=The Complete History of General Motors 1908-1986|date=1986|publisher=Beekman House|location=New York|pages=13–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although purchased by General Motors, Weston-Mott was positioned within the Buick Car Company. In 1916, Bassett was elected vice-president of the Weston-Mott company and assistant general manager of Buick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Automobile Journal|date=10 March 1916|publisher=Automobile Journal Publishing Company|location=Pawtucket, RI|page=15|edition=Volume 41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V_9YAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA15&amp;dq=h.h.+bassett+weston-mott&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiXo4md26XMAhWKsYMKHXgND6kQ6AEINTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=h.h.%20bassett%20weston-mott&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, [[Walter Chrysler]] then head of Buick Motor Car Company, threatened to leave General Motors as operations were back under control of Billy Durant. Durant offered Chrysler $500,000 annual salary plus bonus to remain with the company which Chrysler did for the next three years, finally resigning in 1919. The last straw for Chrysler was Durant's plan to invest $6M in the factory in Flint to manufacture frames when Chrysler had negotiated with A.O. Smith of Milwaukee to purchase frames cheaper than the Flint factory could produce them.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Durant's promoting Bassett to general manager that year, was a bid to position a successor to Chrysler.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

==Buick Motor Car Company==
When Chrysler finally did resign, Bassett was promoted to the Chrysler's position and became president and general manager of Buick. Immediately after taking office, Bassett was charged with implementing the $6M investment in the factory in Flint to manufacture frames and an additional $3M to establish a new factory in [[St. Louis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Buick Extensions to Cost $10,500,000|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/118709505/?terms=h.h.%2Bbassett|newspaper=The Detroit Free Press|date=20 Jan 1920|page=11|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = 24 April 2016 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bassett was very popular among the workers in his factories, many of whom referred to him as "Harry." Forbes wrote the following after interviewing Bassett: "I once had a similar experience on a tour through a Buick plant with Harry Bassett, then its president.  He was "Harry" to hundreds of men; he was constantly on his feet going from department to department of the plant; the men approached him and he approached them as if there were not the slightest distinction in their status and, if he ran short of tobacco, he thought nothing of asking an overawed workman to give him a chew." Forbes went on, "I learned from other officials that all the men who had been with the company for any time felt that they were working, not for some monster corporation, but for Harry Bassett, and that it was up to them to do their best by him and for him."
&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forbes|first1=Bertie Charles|title=Forbes|date=15 April 1922|page=128|edition=Volumes 10-11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wZcjAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA128&amp;dq=forbes+magazine+harry+bassett&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJ2KeYlKfMAhXqtoMKHaaIAbQQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=forbes%20magazine%20harry%20bassett&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Bassett travelled to Paris with a number of General Motors executives to attend the Paris Auto Show. While there, he contracted a cold which turned into bronchial pneumonia and on 17 October 1926, Bassett died.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;  Bassett's body was returned to the United States and was brought by special train from Detroit to Flint on the 5th of November 1926. His body lay in state in Flint the next day. Buick factories were closed the 5th and 6th of November, out of respect and to permit the workers to pay their respects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Buick Plant Closes Today and Saturday|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/20980386/?terms=harry%2Bbassett|newspaper=The News- Palladium|date=5 Nov 1926|page=14|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = 24 April 2016 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bassett was replaced by Edward T. Strong who was appointed by [[Alfred Sloan]], the man in charge of General Motors at that time.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

'''John Anderson''' (1747–1820) was a Scottish businessman and entrepreneur. He was a commercial agent in New York and later a business owner in Cork. His business played a pivotal role in creating infrastructure that connected Dublin to Cork. Anderson purchased land in [[Fermoy]] that was later used as a military complex. 

==Career==
Anderson was born into a poor family at Portland near Dumfries, Scotland and moved to [[Glasgow]] in 1784. He later settled in Cork City, at that time the major provisioning centre on the Atlantic Coast.  During the American wars he earned considerable sums as a commercial agent in New York, and made extensive land purchases in the Cork area.

His Cork enterprise was based at [[Lapp's Island]], and his business acumen was recognised as he grew rapidly in fortune and was appointed to the city's committee of merchants.  He was made a Freeman of the city in 1787.  Among his business interests was a malting and warehouse complex at [[Ballinacurra, County Cork|Ballinacurra]] on Cork Harbour in partnership with John Lapp, in the 1780s.  In common with many Cork merchants he was in favour of union with Great Britain in 1800.  Anderson's Quay in Cork is called after him.  He married a Miss Semple and had two daughters and two sons, one of whom, [[Sir James Caleb Anderson, 1st Baronet|James Caleb Anderson]] (1782–1861), was a noted experimenter with steam-driven road vehicles.

His fortunes suffered a series of reversals with the fall in the value of land after the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and he lost over £30,000 in a Welsh mining venture.  He had been conducting banking business and with the economic downturn his bank collapsed in 1816.

===Development of roads and coaching===
Anderson secured the equivalent of a government franchise to provide a mail service from [[Dublin]] to Cork.  This involved the building of an extensive infrastructure of roads, bridges, inns and [[stage coach]] stations. By 1789 he was the dominant partner in the Dublin–Cork turnpike and mail line, which was extended to Limerick in 1793.  Its paramount achievement was getting from Dublin to Cork within 24 hours, the first Royal Mail arriving in Cork 8 July 1789.

===Founding of Fermoy===
Anderson purchased lands in the [[Fermoy]] area in 1791 and responded to a British government demand for military barracks by offering to build to their order in Fermoy.  The first barracks was for 1400 troop and 100 horses, later increased to a total of 3300 men.  Soon a vast military complex with workshops and ancillary services together with coach workshops were functioning.

===Foundation and early history===
[[File:Robert-wood-johnson-i.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Robert Wood Johnson]]
[[File:Johnson and Johnson corrosive sublimate cotton.jpg|thumb|Early corrosive sublimate cotton packaging with the signature logo]]
Inspired by a speech by [[antiseptic]] advocate [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]], [[Robert Wood Johnson I|Robert Wood Johnson]] joined his brothers [[James Wood Johnson]] and [[Edward Mead Johnson]] to create a line of ready-to-use [[Dressing (medical)|surgical dressings]] in 1885. The company produced its first products in 1886 and [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in 1887. Those products already featured a logo resembling the signature of James Wood Johnson, very similar to the logo used today. It is one of the longest-used company logos in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jnj.com/our-heritage/the-story-behind-johnson-johnson-logo|title=A Sign of the Times: The Story Behind Johnson &amp; Johnson's Iconic Logo - Johnson &amp; Johnson|website=www.jnj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Wood Johnson served as the first president of the company. He worked to improve [[sanitation]] practices in the nineteenth century, and lent his name to the [[Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital]] in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Upon his death in 1910, he was succeeded in the presidency by his brother James Wood Johnson until 1932, and then by his son, [[Robert Wood Johnson (son)|Robert Wood Johnson II]].

Robert Wood Johnson's granddaughter, [[Mary Lea Johnson Richards]], was the first baby to appear on a Johnson &amp; Johnson baby powder label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/15/nyregion/about-books.html |work=The New York Times | title=About Books | first=Shirley | last=Horner | date=February 15, 1987 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q8HGjT8KnJkC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;dq=mary+lea+johnson+first+baby#v=onepage&amp;q=mary%20lea%20johnson%20first%20baby&amp;f=false |title=The Natural History of the Rich: A Field Guide |first=Richard |last=Conniff |publisher=W.

===1959: McNeil Consumer Healthcare===
McNeil Consumer Healthcare was founded on March 16, 1879, by 23-year-old Robert McNeil. In 1904, one of McNeil's sons, Robert Lincoln McNeil, became part of the company, and together they created McNeil Laboratories in 1933. The company focused on [[direct marketing]] of prescription drugs to hospitals, pharmacists, and doctors. Development of [[acetaminophen]] began under the leadership of [[Robert L. McNeil, Jr.]], who later served as the firm's chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Singer|first=Natasha|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/04/business/04mcneil.html?pagewanted=print|title=Robert L. McNeil Jr., Chemist Who Introduced Tylenol, Dies at 94|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 3, 2010|accessdate=June 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, Johnson &amp; Johnson acquired McNeil Laboratories and a year later the company was able to sell [[Tylenol (brand)|Tylenol]] for the first time ever, without a prescription. In 1977, two subsidiary companies were created; McNeil medicals products and McNeil Consumer Products Company (also known as McNeil Consumer Healthcare). The focus of McNeil medicals products is to market prescription drugs. In 1993 McNeil medicals products merged with the [[Ortho Pharmaceutical]] to form [[Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical]]. In 2001 McNeil Consumer Healthcare changed its name to McNeil Consumer &amp; Specialty medicals products. However, it was later changed to "McNeil Consumer Healthcare". The company markets [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] and [[Prescription drug|prescription]] medicals products including complete lines of [[Tylenol (brand)|Tylenol]] and [[Motrin]] IB ([[ibuprofen]]) products for adults and children.

In 2008 a Wellness &amp; Prevention Platform was established with the double acquisition of Orlando-based LGE Performance Systems, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/johnson-and-johnson-strengthens-wellness-and-prevention-platform-with-acquisition-of-human-performance-institute-/?keywords=johnson+%26+johnson+acquire&lt;/ref&gt; and Ann Arbor-based HealthMedia, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/johnson-and-johnson-a-href-http-www-biospace-com-joblistingcompany-aspx-job_customer_entity_id-248231-and-source-newsjoblink-font-color-red-jobs-230973/?keywords=johnson+%26+johnson+acquire&lt;/ref&gt;

===1959: Cilag===
In 1933, Swiss chemist [[Bernhard Joos]] set up a small research laboratory in [[Schaffhausen]], Switzerland. This set the basis for the founding of Chemische Industrie-Labor AG (Chemical Industry Laboratory AG or Cilag) on 12 May 1936. In 1959, Cilag joined the Johnson &amp; Johnson family of companies. In the early nineties, the marketing organizations of Cilag and [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]] were joined to form [[Janssen-Cilag]]. The non-marketing activities of both companies still operate under their original name. Cilag continues to have operations under the Cilag name in Switzerland, ranging from research and development through manufacturing and international services.

In May 2011 Cilag acquired the over-the-counter operations of J B Chemicals &amp; Pharmaceuticals Limited for around $260 million.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/johnson-and-johnson-to-buy-jb-chemicals-and-pharmaceuticals-limited-s-russian-brands-for-about-260-million-/?keywords=johnson+%26+johnson+acquire&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012, the division announced the acquisition of CorImmun GmbH, and its lead compound, COR-1, a small cyclic peptide in development for the treatment of heart failure.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/janssen-cilag-ag-acquires-b-corimmun-b-/?keywords=johnson+%26+johnson+acquire&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, Cilag acquired Covagen a biopharmaceutical company which specializes in the development of multi-specific protein-based therapeutics. As part of the acquisition Cilag will gain access to Covagen's lead drug candidate, COVA 322, a bi-specific anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha/anti-interleukin (IL)-17A FynomAb, is in a Phase Ib study for [[psoriasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/janssen-affiliate-cilag-acquires-covagen/81250273/|title=Janssen Affiliate Cilag Acquires Covagen|work=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1961: Janssen Pharmaceuticals===
Janssen Pharmaceuticals can be traced back to 1933. In 1933, [[Constant Janssen]], the father of Paul Janssen, acquired the right to distribute the pharmaceutical products of [[Gedeon Richter Ltd.|Richter]], a Hungarian pharmaceutical company, for Belgium, the Netherlands and [[Belgian Congo]]. On 23 October 1934, he founded the N.V. Produkten Richter in [[Turnhout]]. After the Second World War, the name for the company products was changed to Eupharma, although the company name Richter would remain until 1956.&lt;ref name=JanssenHist&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lopez-Munoz|first1=Francisco|last2=Alamo|first2=Cecilio|title=The Consolidation of Neuroleptic Therapy: Janssen, the Discovery of Haloperidol and Its Introduction into Clinical Practice|journal=Brain Research Bulletin|date=2009|volume=79|pages=130–141|pmid= 19186209|doi=10.1016/j.brainresbull.2009.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Janssen founded his own research laboratory in 1953 on the third floor of the building in the Statiestraat, still within the Richter-Eurpharma company of his father. On 5 April 1956, the name of the company was changed to NV Laboratoria Pharmaceutica C. Janssen (named after Constant Janssen). On 2 May 1958, the research department in Beerse became a separate legal entity, the N.V. Research Laboratorium C. Janssen. On 24 October 1961, the company was acquired by the American corporation Johnson &amp; Johnson. On 10 February 1964, the name was changed to Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. Between 1990 and 2004, Janssen Pharmaceuticals expanded worldwide, with the company growing in size to approximately 28000 employees worldwide. In 1999, clinical research and non-clinical development become a global organization within Johnson &amp; Johnson. In 2001, part of the research activities was transferred to the United States with the reorganization of research activities in the [[Johnson &amp; Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development]] organization. The research activities of the Janssen Research Foundation and the R.W. Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute were merged into the new global research organization. On 27 October 2004, the Paul Janssen Research Center, for discovery research, was inaugurated.

In August 2013, the company acquired Aragon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.. In November 2014, the company acquired Alios BioPharma, Inc. for $1.75 billion.

== JNJ Headquarters and the New Brunswick gentrification ==
The company has historically been located on the [[Delaware and Raritan Canal]] in New Brunswick. The company considered moving its headquarters out of New Brunswick in the 1960s, but decided to stay in the town after city officials promised to gentrify downtown New Brunswick by demolishing old buildings and constructing new ones.

While New Brunswick lost many historic structures, including the early home of Rutgers University, and most of its historic commercial waterfront to the redevelopment effort, the gentrification did attract people back to New Brunswick. Johnson &amp; Johnson hired [[Henry N. Cobb]] from [[Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners]] to design an addition to its headquarters.

==Products==
The company's business is divided into three major segments, Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices, and Consumer Products. In 2015, these segments contributed 44.9%, 35.9%, and 19.2%, respectively, of the company's total revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/JNJ/1709744668x0x881109/474857DD-8E67-43B1-BB38-0A9712D93545/2015_annual_report_.pdf |format=PDF|work=files.shareholder.com |title=Downloads |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharmaceuticals===
The company's major franchises in the Pharmaceutical segment include Immunology, Neuroscience, Infectious Disease, and Oncology.

Immunology products include the anti-[[tumor necrosis factor]] antibodies Remicade ([[infliximab]]), and Simponi ([[golimumab]]) used for the treatment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/103772s5359lbl.pdf |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of autoimmune diseases, including [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[Crohn's disease]] (Remicade only), [[ulcerative colitis]], [[ankylosing spondylitis]], and other disorders. In 2013, these two products accounted for 29% of Johnson and Johnson's pharmaceutical revenues, and 11.3% of the company's total revenues. A third immunology product, Stelara ([[ustekinumab]]), targets [[interleukin-12]] and [[interleukin-23]] and is used for the treatment of [[psoriasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/125261s114lbl.pdf |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key infectious diseases products include Incivio ([[telaprevir]]), a hepatitis C protease inhibitor; Intelence ([[Etravirine]]), a non-nucleoside HIV polymerase inhibitor; and Prezista ([[darunavir]]), an HIV protease inhibitor. Telaprevir sales are expected to decline due to the recent approval of treatment regimens that are more efficacious and much better tolerated. Etravirine and darunavir are notable for their high barriers to resistance development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ruela Corrêa JC, D'Arcy DM, dos Reis Serra CH, Nunes Salgado HR |title=Darunavir: a critical review of its properties, use and drug interactions |journal=Pharmacology |volume=90 |issue=1-2 |pages=102–9 |year=2012 |pmid=22797653 |doi=10.1159/000339862 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tools.wmflabs.org/citation-template-filling/cgi-bin/index.cgi?ddb=&amp;type=pubmed_id&amp;id=++++23560740 |title=Wikipedia template filling |publisher=Tools.wmflabs.org |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darunavir in combination with HIV polymerase inhibitors is recommended as a first line treatment option for treatment naive persons with HIV infection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/contentfiles/lvguidelines/adultandadolescentgl.pdf |title=aidsinfo.nih.gov |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but etravirine is approved only for use in treatment-experienced patients, owing in part to its requirement for twice-daily dosing.

The company's CNS products include the ADHD drug Concerta ([[methylphenidate]] extended release), and the long-acting injectable antipsychotics Invega Sustenna ([[paliperidone palmitate]]) and Risperdal Consta ([[risperidone]]). Invega Sustenna and Risperdal Consta were the first widely utilized long-acting depot injections for the treatment of schizophrenia. Designed to address the issue of poor patient compliance with oral therapy, they are administered by intramuscular injection at intervals of 2 weeks and one month, respectively. Only minimal improvements in outcomes relative to the oral versions of these drugs were observed in the clinical trial setting, but some evidence suggests that the advantages of long-acting injections in clinical practice may be greater than is readily demonstrated in the environment of a clinical trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaplan G, Casoy J, Zummo J |title=Impact of long-acting injectable antipsychotics on medication adherence and clinical, functional, and economic outcomes of schizophrenia |journal=Patient Prefer Adherence |volume=7 |issue= |pages=1171–80 |year=2013 |pmid=24265549 |pmc=3833623 |doi=10.2147/PPA.S53795 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kane JM, Kishimoto T, Correll CU |title=Assessing the comparative effectiveness of long-acting injectable vs. oral antipsychotic medications in the prevention of relapse provides a case study in comparative effectiveness research in psychiatry |journal=J Clin Epidemiol |volume=66 |issue=8 Suppl |pages=S37–41 |date=August 2013 |pmid=23849151 |doi=10.1016/j.jclinepi.2013.01.012 |url=|pmc=3742035 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fusar-Poli P, Kempton MJ, Rosenheck RA |title=Efficacy and safety of second-generation long-acting injections in schizophrenia: a meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials |journal=Int Clin Psychopharmacol |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=57–66 |date=March 2013 |pmid=23165366 |doi=10.1097/YIC.0b013e32835b091f |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oncology products include Velcade ([[bortezomib]]), for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/021602s031s032lbl.pdf |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Zytiga ([[abiraterone]]), an androgen antagonist for the treatment of prostate cancer.

=== 2010 hip-replacement recall ===
{{Main|2010 DePuy Hip Recall}}
On August 2009, 2010, DePuy, a subsidiary of American giant Johnson &amp; Johnson, recalled its ASR (articular surface replacement) hip prostheses from the market. DePuy said the recall was due to unpublished National Joint Registry data showing a 12% revision rate for resurfacing at five years and an ASR XL revision rate of 13%. All hip prostheses fail in some patients, but it is expected that the rate will be about 1% a year.&lt;ref name="Out of joint"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d2905.full | title = Out of joint: The story of the ASR | date = May 14, 2011 | author=Deborah Cohen }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pathologically, the failing prosthesis had several effects. Metal debris from wear of the implant led to a reaction that destroyed the soft tissues surrounding the joint, leaving some patients with long term disability. Ions of cobalt and chromium—the metals from which the implant was made—were also released into the blood and cerebral spinal fluid in some patients.&lt;ref name="fda1"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/ImplantsandProsthetics/MetalonMetalHipImplants/ucm241604.htm | title = FDA.

In March 2013, a jury in Los Angeles ordered Johnson &amp; Johnson to pay more than $8.3 million in damages to a Montana man in the first of more than 10,000 lawsuits pending against the company in connection with the now-recalled DePuy hip.&lt;ref name="Meier"&gt;{{cite news|last=Meier|first=Barry|title=J.&amp;J.

=== Use of the Red Cross symbol ===
[[File:Flag of the Red Cross.svg|thumb|150px|Flag of the [[Red Cross]]]]

{{further|Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement#Use of the emblems}}
Johnson &amp; Johnson registered the [[Red Cross]] as a U.S. trademark for "medicinal and surgical plasters" in 1905 and has used the design since 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=71013666|title=Trademark Status &amp; Document Retrieval|work=uspto.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Geneva Conventions]], which reserved the [[Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement#Red Cross|Red Cross emblem]] for specific uses, were first approved in 1864 and ratified by the United States in 1882. However, the emblem was not protected by U.S. law for the use of the [[American Red Cross]] and the U.S. military until after Johnson &amp; Johnson had obtained its trademark. A clause in this law (now 18 U.S.C. 706) permits this pre-existing uses of the Red Cross to continue.

&lt;!-- Please do NOT insert any further assertions that continued Johnson &amp; Johnson use of the Red Cross violates the Geneva Conventions; as a the paragraph below states, the U.S. specifically excluded that application of the Geneva Conventions thru a reservation. --&gt;
A declaration made by the U.S. upon its ratification of the 1949 Geneva Conventions includes a [[Reservation (law)|reservation]] that pre-1905 U.S. domestic uses of the Red Cross, such as Johnson &amp; Johnson's, would remain lawful as long as the cross is not used on "aircraft, vessels, vehicles, buildings or other structures, or upon the ground," i.e., uses which could be confused with its military uses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/NORM/D6B53F5B5D14F35AC1256402003F9920?OpenDocument U.S. reservations to the 1949 Geneva Conventions] ([[International Committee of the Red Cross]] website)&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the U.S. did not agree to any interpretation of the 1949 Geneva Conventions that would overrule Johnson &amp; Johnson's trademark. The American Red Cross continues to recognize the validity of Johnson &amp; Johnson's trademark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redcross.org/pressrelease/0,1077,0_314_6910,00.html American Red Cross Defends Use of Emblem and Mission] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818044717/http://www.redcross.org/pressrelease/0,1077,0_314_6910,00.html# |date=August 18, 2007 }} ([[American Red Cross]] press release, August 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007, Johnson &amp; Johnson filed a lawsuit against the [[American Red Cross]] (ARC), demanding that the charity halt the use of the red cross symbol on products it sells to the public, though the company takes no issue with the charity's use of the mark for non-profit purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118662527980592590 "Red Cross Is Sued by J&amp;J Over Signature Emblem"] ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' August 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008, the judge in the case dismissed most of Johnson &amp; Johnson's claims, and a month later the two organizations announced a settlement had been reached in which both parties would continue to use the symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/18/business/18cross.html | title = Claim Over Red Cross Symbol Is Settled |work=The New York Times | date = June 18, 2008 | author=Stephanie Saul }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Boston Scientific lawsuits ===
Since 2003, Johnson &amp; Johnson and [[Boston Scientific]] have both claimed that the other had infringed on their patents covering [[heart stent]] medical devices. The litigation was settled when Boston Scientific agreed to pay $716&amp;nbsp;million to Johnson &amp; Johnson in September 2009 and an additional $1.73&amp;nbsp;billion in February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704107204575039430685168478 Boston Scientific to Pay J&amp;J $1.73B to Settle Stent Patent Disputes], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', February 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Their dispute was renewed in 2014, now on the grounds of a contract dispute.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/19/us-johnson-johnson-boston-scient-trial-idUSKCN0J30CS20141119 J&amp;J seeks over $5 billion in damages from Boston Scientific at trial]. [[Reuters]], 19 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Patent-infringement case against Abbott ===
In 2007, Johnson &amp; Johnson sued [[Abbott Laboratories]] over the development and sale of the arthritis drug [[Humira]]. Johnson &amp; Johnson claimed that Abbott used technology patented by [[New York University]] and licensed exclusively to Johnson &amp; Johnson's [[Centocor]] division to develop Humira. Johnson &amp; Johnson won the court case, and in 2009 Abbott was ordered to pay Johnson &amp; Johnson $1.17&amp;nbsp;billion in lost revenues and $504&amp;nbsp;million in royalties.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg2009&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aF0Qoxe0JCiw Abbott Told to Pay Record $1.67&amp;nbsp;billion Award to J&amp;J], ''Bloomberg News'', June 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The judge also added $175.6&amp;nbsp;million in interest to bring the total to $1.84&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name= bloomberg2010&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-02/abbott-challenges-1-67-billion-patent-loss-to-j-j-over-arthritis-therapy.html Abbott Challenges $1.67&amp;nbsp;billion Patent Loss to J&amp;J Over Humira], ''Bloomberg News'', November 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This was the largest patent-infringement award in U.S. history&lt;ref name=Bloomberg2009/&gt; until the 2013 decision against Teva in favor of [[Takeda]] and [[Pfizer]] for over 2.1 billion dollars.&lt;ref name= WSJ2013&gt;[https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324188604578541080995659790 Pfizer, Takeda to Get $2.15 Billion Settlement], ''WSJ'', 6 12 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Abbott appealed the verdict&lt;ref name= bloomberg2010/&gt; and in 2011 won the appeal.&lt;ref name=BusinessWeek2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-02-23/abbott-wins-reversal-of-j-j-s-1-67-billion-patent-victory.html|title=abbott-wins-reversal-of-j-j-s-1-67-billion-patent-victory|work=Bloomberg.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506001424/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-02-23/abbott-wins-reversal-of-j-j-s-1-67-billion-patent-victory.html|archivedate=May 6, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vaginal mesh implants===
Tens of thousands of women worldwide have taken legal action against Johnson &amp; Johnson after suffering serious complications following a vaginal mesh implant procedure.&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/states-file-lawsuit-against-johnson-johnson-over-pelvic-mesh-implants/|title=States file lawsuit against Johnson &amp; Johnson over pelvic mesh implants|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the U.S. states of [[California]] and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] filed a lawsuit against the company, accusing it of deception.&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"/&gt; More than 700 women began a [[class action]] against the company in the [[Federal Court of Australia]] in 2017, telling the court they "suffered irreparable, debilitating pain after the devices began to erode into surrounding tissue and organs, causing infections and complications." The class action alleged that Johnson &amp; Johnson, which "aggressively marketed" the implants "failed to properly warn patients and surgeons of the risk, or test the devices adequately."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jul/04/vaginal-mesh-risks-downplayed-by-johnson-johnson-court-told|title=Vaginal mesh risks downplayed by Johnson &amp; Johnson, court told|first=Christopher|last=Knaus|date=July 4, 2017|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emails between executives show the company was aware of the risks in 2005 but still went ahead and made the product available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/27/vaginal-mesh-implant-sold-despite-warnings-could-cause-pain-johnson-johnson Pharma firm sold mesh implant despite pain warnings] The Guardian, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baby powder===
In February 2016, J&amp;J was ordered to pay $72 million in damages to the family of Jacqueline Fox, a 62-year-old woman who died of ovarian cancer in 2015: the company said it would appeal.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|title=Johnson &amp; Johnson hit with $72m damages in talc-cancer case|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-35648252|accessdate=24 February 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 2017, over 1,000 U.S. women had sued J&amp;J for covering up the possible cancer risk from its Baby Powder product; the company says that 70 percent of its Baby Powder is used by adults.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-baby-powder-cancer-lawsuits/ Johnson &amp; Johnson Has a Baby Powder Problem] Bloomberg, Retrieved April 20, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, a California jury ordered Johnson &amp; Johnson to pay $417 million to a woman who claimed she developed ovarian cancer after using the company's talc-based products like Johnson's Baby Powder for feminine hygiene. The verdict included $70 million in compensatory damages and $347 million in punitive damages. J&amp;J said they will appeal the verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-johnson-johnson-cancer-lawsuit/jj-ordered-to-pay-417-million-in-trial-over-talc-cancer-risks-idUSKCN1B121D|title=J&amp;J ordered to pay $417 million in trial over talc cancer risks|date=August 21, 2017|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, the [[Missouri]] Eastern District appeals court on Tuesday threw out a $72 million jury verdict. The appeals court ruled 3-0 that Jacqueline Fox's lawsuit lacked jurisdiction in Missouri because of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that imposed limits on where injury lawsuit can be filed which lawsuit's jurisdiction requires a stronger connection between the forum state and a plaintiff's claims. Fox, 62, of [[Birmingham, Ala.]], died in 2015, about four months before her trial was held in [[St. Louis]] Circuit Court. She was among 65 plaintiffs, of whom only two were from Missouri. Subsequently, it also would kill three other recent St. Louis jury verdicts of more than $200 million combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/missouri-appeals-court-tosses-out-million-dollar-johnson-johnson-talcum/article_e976d9eb-c9dc-5fdf-b136-8d94bc6cfbdd.html|title=Missouri appeals court tosses out $72 million Johnson &amp; Johnson talcum powder verdict|first=Joel|last=Currier|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, a St. Louis jury awarded nearly US$4.7 billion in damages to 22 women and their families after they claimed asbestos in Johnson &amp; Johnson talcum powder caused their ovarian cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bever |first1=Lindsey |title=Johnson &amp; Johnson ordered to pay $4.7 billion to women who say baby powder gave them cancer |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/07/13/johnson-johnson-ordered-to-pay-4-7-billion-to-women-who-say-baby-powder-gave-them-cancer/ |website=[[Washington Post]] |accessdate=28 July 2018 |language=en |date=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, Johnson &amp; Johnson said that it removed several chemicals from baby powder products and re-engineered them to be safer for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.livemint.com/Companies/f2z1TqJx9HtNRwmAEiIXXK/Johnson-and-Johnsonremoveschemicals-to-make-products-safer.html|title=Johnson and Johnson removes chemicals to make products safer|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opioid epidemic ===
By 2018, the company had become embroiled in the [[opioid epidemic]] in the United States and had become a target of [[lawsuit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dddmag.com/news/2018/03/doj-support-lawsuits-against-companies-selling-opioids|title=DOJ to Support Lawsuits Against Companies Selling Opioids|last=Gurman|first=Sadie|date=March 2, 2018|work=Drug Discovery &amp; Development|access-date=2 March 2018|publisher=Advantage Business Media|agency=Associated Press|last2=Mulvihill|first2=Geoff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 500 opioid-related cases have been filed as of May 2018 against Johnson &amp; Johnson and its competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://seekingalpha.com/article/4200206-trump-insurance-johnson-and-johnson|title=Trump Insurance For Johnson &amp; Johnson|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Idaho, Johnson &amp; Johnson is part of a lawsuit accusing the company for being partically to blame for opioid-related overdose deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.idahostatesman.com/living/health-fitness/article216893150.html|title=11 Idaho counties take on Walmart, CVS, drug companies in opioid lawsuit|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janeček graduated from the Faculty of [[Mathematics]] and [[Physics]] of [[Charles University in Prague]] in the field of [[Probability]] and [[Mathematical Statistics]].&lt;ref name=biz&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=115284062&amp;privcapId=23712517 Executive Profile], ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He is  an [[MBA]] in [[Finance]] graduate of [[Bradley University]], [[Peoria, Illinois]], USA, and a [[Ph.D.]] graduate in the field of [[Mathematical Finance]] of [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], USA.&lt;ref name=biz/&gt;

==Academia==
During the period 2007-2013, Janeček lectured at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of Charles University in Prague. He specializes in [[optimal control]] in [[mathematical finance]].&lt;ref name=biz/&gt;

Janeček has authored and co-authored several research articles in scientific journals in the area of applied [[stochastic calculus]], where his work has numerous citations,&lt;ref name=biz/&gt; such as "Optimal investment with high-watermark performance fee," ''SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization'', 2012; "Futures trading with transaction costs," ''Illinois Journal of Mathematics'', 2010; "Asymptotic analysis for optimal investment and consumption with transaction costs," ''Finance and Stochastics'', 2004; and others.

==Business==
From 1998 to 2000, Janeček worked as a mathematical analyst for the [[hedge fund]] Market Research Ltd, and from 2004 to 2005, served as Researcher in the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name=biz/&gt; On the basis of his experience, he started the firm RSJ Algorithmic Trading.&lt;ref name=praha&gt;[http://www.radio.cz/en/section/one-on-one/businessman-and-anti-corruption-pioneer-karel-janecek-whistle-blowing-is-a-brave-thing-to-do "Businessman and anti-corruption pioneer Karel Janeček: Whistle-blowing is a brave thing to do"], [[Radio Prague]], 28 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-corruption campaign==
{{More|Corruption in the Czech Republic}}
According to media reports, by 2013, the Czech government was "buffeted" by a series of corruption scandals that have threatened to bring it down.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/28/world/europe/foes-want-czech-leader-prosecuted-over-amnesty.html?_r=0 "Foes Want Czech Leader Prosecuted Over Amnesty"], by [[Dan Bilefsky]],  ''[[The New York Times]]'', 27 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Václav Klaus]], then president of the republic, in his last days in office, granted [[amnesty]] to a number of people accused of [[corruption]], Janeček financed the publishing of online videos and newspaper advertisements urging Czechs to sign a [[petition]] calling Klaus to account.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; The signatures were published on a website called "High Treason" in [[Czech language|Czech]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; The movement convinced 28 Senators to back a proposal in the [[Senate of the Parliament of the Czech Republic|Senate]] for the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic]] to undertake [[high treason]] proceedings against Klaus.&lt;ref name=monde&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2013/03/01/milliardaire-et-croise-anticorruption_1841515_3210.html "Karel Janecek, milliardaire et croisé anticorruption"], by Martin Plichta, ''[[Le Monde]]'', 1 March 2013 (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Klaus, who was eventually not charged by the Supreme Court, had previously stated he did not regret the amnesty, and on an official visit to [[Slovakia]]  dismissed the move as "political games."&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==Political reform==
In 2012, he proposed a new electoral system primarily based on a minus vote, i.e. the possibility to vote against a candidate. The idea was promoted as a part of the Positive Evolution project. In May 2013, Janecek created the electoral system [[Democracy 2.1]] or D21&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.d21.me/en/ Democracy 21] website&lt;/ref&gt; which, he argues, will bring about a major improvement comparable to "an upgrade from DOS to Windows". The main effect of D21 lies in the use of multiple votes - each voter has twice as many votes than the number of seats available to winners. More concretely, for the elections to the Chamber of Deputies, he designed two-mandate districts in which voters could use four votes, with the possibility to use one minus vote.&lt;ref name=pw&gt;[http://praguewandering.com/2013/12/06/lessons-from-the-blackjack-table/ "Billionaire Mystifies Public as He Tries to Fight Corruption with Math"], ''Prague Wandering'', 6 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sponsorship==
The Karel Janeček Benevolent Fund for Support of Science and Research was established in 2010 (renamed as Neuron Fund for Support of Science in 2013) a non-profit organisation, which promotes the idea of benefactors supporting the science and research in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name=neu&gt;[http://www.nfneuron.cz/en/about-us/ Neuron Fund for Support of Science]&lt;/ref&gt; Neuron has supported a number of scientists and their projects through grants worth over 13 million [[Czech koruna|Czech crowns]].&lt;ref name=neu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Approximately [[United States dollar|$]] 600,000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gambling==
[[File:SBA_diskette.jpg|thumb|right|150px|&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;SBA [[floppy disk]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]

Janeček, in the 1990s, and after playing the game in various [[casino]]s in the United States and elsewhere, created a [[simulation software]] for [[Advantage gambling|advantage play]] in [[Blackjack]], which he marketed under the brand "Statistical Blackjack Analyzer."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sba21.com/Details.html SBA website]&lt;/ref&gt; The sim program has been praised by many gambling researchers.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Don Schlesinger]]: "[Janeček]'sStatistical Blackjack Analyzer software was the original, all-purpose simulator, and it has come to be known as the standard against which all other such products are measured." [http://www.sba21.com/Reviews.html Reviews], SBA website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sba21.com/Reviews.html SBA sample reviews]&lt;/ref&gt; He has acted as a consultant for the casino games industry, including the creators of [[Blackjack Switch]], which, before it became operational, was tested by Janeček-created software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.professional-poker.com/interviews/geoff-hall/blackjack-switch.htm "Blackjack Switch - interview with Geoff Hall"], ''Professional Poker''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/switch/ Blackjack Switch] at the [[Michael Shackleford|Wizard of Odds]] website for the game's analysis&lt;/ref&gt;

Janeček, along with Brett Harris, [[R. Michael Canjar|Mike Canjar]], Winston Yamashita, Pete Moss, [[Steven L. Heston|Kim Lee]], and other gambling theorists, contributed to the development of what has become known as "[[Gambling and information theory|optimal betting theory]]", and the discovery that it is possible to calculate a [[Card counting#Running counts versus True counts in Balanced counting systems|true count for unbalanced counting systems]] in casino Blackjack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bjinsider.com/newsletter_112_unbalanced.shtml "The truth about unbalanced counts"] by Dr Brett Harris, ''Blackjack Insider''&lt;/ref&gt;  He has regularly contributed articles in gambling-research websites, such as [[Stanford Wong]]'s BJ21.com.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bj21.com/bj_reference/pages/certaintyequivalentanalysis.shtml "Certainty Equivalent Analysis"] by Karel Janeček, bj21.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Janeček recommends treating the handling of advantage play "as just another [[Investment#In finance|investment]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bj21.com/bj_reference/pages/fluctuations.shtml "Fluctuations - A Personal Perspective"] by [[MathProf]], bj21.com,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 2015, Janeček married for the second time. His wife was [[Demographics of Tunisia|Tunisian]] Mariem Mhadhbi, a [[structural engineering|structural engineer]] who studied at [[Mines ParisTech|L'École des Mines]], on [[AngelList]] and they have one child. Janeček has two daughters from his first marriage.

[[File:Kingdom 5KR.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''Kingdom 5KR'', docked in Antibes, France]]
[[File:Kingdom 5KR - 005.JPG|thumb|''Kingdom 5KR''|400x400px]]

'''''Kingdom 5KR''''' is an 85.65-metre (281&amp;nbsp;ft) [[Luxury yacht|superyacht]] built for Saudi billionaire [[Adnan Khashoggi]] that is now owned by Saudi business magnate [[Al-Waleed bin Talal]].

== Overview ==
The yacht was built in 1980 by the yacht builder [[Benetti]] at a cost of $100 million&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onthecanvas.com/body_politic.htm onthecanvas.com - Retrieved November 15, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|100|1980}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}}). Its original interior was designed by Luigi Sturchio.&lt;ref name="monacoeye"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yachts.monacoeye.com/yachtsbysize/pages/kingdom5kr01.html|title=Kingdom 5KR|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was originally built as '''''Nabila''''' for Saudi billionaire [[Adnan Khashoggi]] (named for his daughter).  During Khashoggi's ownership, it was one of the [[List of motor yachts by length|largest yachts in the world]] but is now{{when|date=October 2018}} ranked below 60th and continues to fall down the rankings, due to the trend of larger yachts being built. In fact the largest yacht as of 2016 is 180 metres so ''Kingdom 5KR'' falls short of even half that size.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

During her days as ''Nabila'', she was featured in the [[James Bond]] movie ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'', in which she was seen as ''Flying Saucer'' (translated from Italian ''[[List of James Bond vehicles#Marine vehicles|Disco Volante]]'' in the source novel, ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]''), the villain's superyacht mobile headquarters. She was also the inspiration for a track, "[[The Miracle (album)#Khashoggi's Ship|Khashoggi's Ship]]", on the 1989 album by rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]], ''[[The Miracle (album)|The Miracle]]''.

After Khashoggi ran into financial problems, he sold the yacht in 1988 to the [[List of Sultans of Brunei|Sultan of Brunei]], who in turn sold her to [[Donald Trump]] for $29 million. After a [[refit]], Trump renamed her '''''Trump Princess'''''. The yacht was handed over to [[creditor]]s after Trump was found to be $900 million in debt.&lt;ref name="Agora2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Agorakis | first=Stavros | title=Trump tweeted he has no ties to Saudi Arabia. A Fox News account proved him wrong. | website=Vox | date=2018-10-16 | url=https://www.vox.com/2018/10/16/17984212/trump-tweet-saudi-arabia-fox-news-jamal-khashoggi-mbs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then she was sold in 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE5DD1739F93BA25757C0A967958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2|title=Fiscal Riddle Confronts Casino Panel|date=18 April 1991|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Prince [[Al-Waleed bin Talal]] for $20 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/inside-the-fabulous-world-of-donald-trump-where-money-is-no-problem/2015/10/09/e51ae0fc-6161-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html|title=Inside the fabulous world of Donald Trump, where money is no problem|author=Roxanne Roberts|date=9 October 2015|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The yacht's latest name stems from the Prince's investment company, [[Kingdom Holding Company]], his lucky number (5), and his children's initials ("K" and "R").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yachtcrew-cv.com/yachts/Kingdom%20%20Nabilia.htm yachtcrew-cv.com - Retrieved November 15, 2007]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012194847/http://www.yachtcrew-cv.com/yachts/Kingdom%20%20Nabilia.htm |date=October 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship has a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|13.25|m|ft}}, a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|4.72|m|ft}} and fuel capacity of {{convert|515,000|l|USgal|abbr=off}}.

When she was delivered she had five decks, a disco, a cinema with seats for 12 and 2 double beds, 11 opulent suites, a helipad on top (its [[Funnel (ship)|funnels]] are sloped outward to avoid interference with the helicopters), a pool with a water jet on top in front of the heliport, 2 Riva [[Luxury yacht tender|tenders]], a crew of 48, a top speed of 20 knots, and cruising speed of 17.5 knots. Propulsion was supplied by two {{convert|3000|hp}} [[NOHAB|Nohab]] Polar engines.&lt;ref name="monacoeye"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6366">'''Massaya''' is a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] winery and [[arak (drink)|arak]] distillery owned and operated by the Ghosn brothers Sami and Ramzi. Situated in the north of the [[Beqaa Valley]] near Chtaura and [[Zahlé]], 38&amp;nbsp;km from [[Baalbek]], the winery and distillery are located on the Tanaïl property, which is also home to vineyards and a restaurant. The Beqaa Valley has an extensive history of viticulture dating back over 5,000 years to the [[Phoenicians]].&lt;ref&gt;McGovern, Patrick.E. "Uncorking the Past". University of California Press, 2009, Pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The northern Bekaa has traditionally been a favoured [[terroir]] for [[viticulture]],&lt;ref&gt;Karam, Michael (2005) ''The Wines of Lebanon'' Saqi Books&lt;/ref&gt; especially since the beginning of the last century.&lt;ref&gt;McGovern, Patrick.E. ''Uncorking the Past''. University of California Press, 2009, Pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Vines have also been introduced in the southern Bekaa as part of the recent surge in the number of wineries established in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lebanonwines.com/terroir.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804031946/http://www.lebanonwines.com/terroir.html |archivedate=2011-08-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The history of the estate==

The Tanaïl property was brought by Michel and Amal Ghosn in the early 1970s and was used by the family as a country retreat from their primary residence in Beirut. In line with tradition, it was planted [[table grape]]s, including indigenous varieties such as beitamouni and obeidi, used to produce home-made arak. It also had a [[kitchen garden]] growing [[mekti]], an indigenous drought-resistant cucumber, and [[orchard]]s.

The outbreak of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1975 forced the family to leave the estate and both Sami and Ramzi Ghosn left Lebanon to study abroad. In the early 1990s Sami and Ramzi returned to Lebanon and decided to work on revitalisating the war-ravaged estate.

==Establishment==

At the end of the civil war in 1991 there were five wineries in Lebanon – [[Château Musar]], [[Château Ksara]], [[Kefraya]], [[Domaine des Tourelles]] and [[Nakad]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/wine/8243878/Lebanese-wine-Edgy-exhilarating-and-drinkable.html&lt;/ref&gt; but that number has now increased to over 30. As part of this renaissance,&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, Where Conflict Raged, Lebanon Now Tends Its Vineyards, October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; the Ghosn brothers, assisted by French partners, established the Massaya winery in 1998, citing the historical potential of Lebanese terroir and a desire to revitalise both a traditional industry and an area that had suffered hugely during the civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordwine.co.uk/features/winter_06/massaya.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120906173214/http://www.oxfordwine.co.uk/features/winter_06/massaya.html |archivedate=2012-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the brothers focused on the revival of traditional home-made [[arak (drink)|arak]], the Lebanese spirit made from wine and aniseed, often likened to Turkey's [[Rakı|raki]] and Greece's [[ouzo]]. Only traditional methods were used, including the burning of vine wood to heat the copper alembics used for distillation and the use of traditional clay jars for ageing the arak. The clay jars are produced for Massaya by specialised potters from the village of Beit Chabab. The arak is triple distilled and aged for 18 months. It is drunk diluted with water or ice.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.economist.com/node/2281757&lt;/ref&gt; Massaya now produces 40,000 litres per annum which is sold in distinctive blue bottles and has had notable success &lt;ref&gt;http://www.economist.com/node/2281757&lt;/ref&gt;

== French partners ==

The Brunier family of [[Châteauneuf-du-Pape]] and the Hebrard family, formerly of [[Château Cheval Blanc]] in [[Saint-Émilion]], [[Bordeaux]], are partners in the winery.  Hippolyte Brunier planted his first wine stocks on Plateau de la Crau, where grapes had been grown since the 14th century and where, in 1972, Claude Chappe, the inventor of the optical telegraph, built one of his signal towers. Hippolyte’s son, Jules, extended the estate to 42 acres and gave it its name "Vieux Télégraphe".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vignoblesbrunier.fr Domaine du Vieux Télégraphe]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early 1980s, the family business has been run by Frédéric and Daniel, both of whom are partners in Massaya. After the sale of the Hebrard family enterprise, Dominic Hebrard established la Maison Hebrard, a new Chateau in Saint Emilion, and went into partnership with Massaya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wine-pages.com/resources/lebanon.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219000803/http://www.wine-pages.com/resources/lebanon.htm |archivedate=2010-12-19 |df= }} by Tom Cannavan and Michael Karam&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wines==

The grapes are harvested in September and October from Massaya's vineyards on the Tanaïl property as well as other areas of Massaya land around the Bekaa valley. Massaya bottles five wines per vintage: one white, one rosé and three reds – Classic, Silver Selection and Gold Reserve, made from varying blends of [[Grenache noir]], [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Mourvedre]], [[Syrah]] and [[Cinsault]].

The 2008 event featured an initiative to plant one million trees in honor of the 75th anniversary of the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]].&lt;ref name="Civilian Conservation Corps"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.publiclandsday.org/partners/civilian-conservation-corps| title=Civilian Conservation Corps| publisher=PublicLandsDay.org| accessdate=2011-07-12| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005060340/http://www.publiclandsday.org/partners/civilian-conservation-corps| archivedate=2011-10-05| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This goal was exceeded, with more than 1.6 million trees planted.

'''Ngan Shing-kwan''', {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of the British Empire|CBE]]}} (Chinese: 顏成坤; 1903 – 14 April 2001), born in Hong Kong,&lt;ref name="general"&gt;"[https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:KXHH-2V5 List or Manifest of Alien Passengers for the United States Immigrant Inspector at Port of Arrival: S.S. General W. H. Gordon]". San Francisco, California: Immigration and Naturalization Service, U.S. Department of Labor, 21 August 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cleveland"&gt;"[https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:KXH6-V6K Manifest of In-Bound Passengers (Aliens): S.S. President Cleveland]". San Francisco, California: Immigration and Naturalization Service, United States Department of Justice, 17 June 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; was a notable [[Hong Kong]] transport and later property tycoon that ran [[China Motor Bus]]. Ngan got his start running his uncle's rickshaw service during the 1920s in Kowloon. Such was Ngan's reputation in the rickshaw industry that according to one interview "[s]top any rickshaw puller on the street and he would nod knowingly at the nearest mention of Ngan Shing Kwan's [sic] name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Chi Ming |last= Fung |title=Reluctant Heroes: Rickshaw Pullers in Hong Kong and Canton, 1874-1954 |year=2005 |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This success within the rickshaw industry attracted the attention of the government and Ngan won the first exclusive licence to operate a bus service in Hong Kong in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/115515 |title=A Dynasty Falls |date=5 May 1998 |publisher=The Economist |accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ngan established himself on the Hong Kong business scene via a frugal attitude during the early days of China Motor Bus. The Company owned many strategic bus depots and properties, which were subsequently redeveloped for commercial, residential and industrial use at great profit.  Ngan Shing-kwan thrived by sticking to two simple principles: devotion to the buses and counting the pennies. In fact, it was Ngan that was instrumental in bringing the iconic double-decker bus to Hong Kong.

However, by the early 1990s and after Ngan Shing-kwan's retirement from day-to-day operations, that the Company began to fall behind its competitors [[Citybus (Hong Kong)|Citybus]] and [[Kowloon Motor Bus]]. Ngan Shing-kwan's children incorrectly wagered that frugal Hong Kong customers would not pay a premium for air conditioned buses. The Company's frugality, once a virtue, had now become a liability. Even though CMB was a Hong Kong Stock Exchange listed Company, annual general meetings were often held in a depot and once inside a hospital. Finally, in 1998, despite owning a fleet of more than 800 buses, having 2,400 employees and a turnover of HKD$800 million, the Hong Kong government pulled CMB's licence, citing poor performance. At the time CMB's licence was pulled just 20% of their fleet was air conditioned, versus their competitors which had approximately 80%. Ngan Shing-kwan remained Chairman of CMB until his death, where he was subsequently succeeded by his children: Irene, Henry and Horace. The later, Horace, subsequently became [[Baron of Appleby]] in 1999.

Ngan was a high profile member of Hong Kong's public sector. In addition to his role at China Motor Bus Co. Ltd, he was the first chairman of the [[Tung Wah Group of Hospitals|Tung Wah Hospital's]] and the [[Po Leung Kuk]] (Society for the Protection of Women and Children). Ngan was also a member of Hong Kong's Legislative Council (1951–1961) and the Executive Council (1959–1961), until he was succeeded by [[Douglas Clague]] on 28 May 1961. In the [[1961 New Year Honours|New Year Honours 1961]] Shing-kwan was appointed as a [[Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]] for '''public services in Hong Kong'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=42231 |date=27 December 1960 |page=8911 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Chi Ming |last= Fung |title=Reluctant Heroes: Rickshaw Pullers in Hong Kong and Canton, 1874-1954 |year=2005 |publisher=Hong Kong University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ngan was also an influential figure within the Chiu Chow Chamber of Commerce since the 1930s and was known to be a devout Christian and trustee of Hop Yat Church's in Kowloon (since 1957), North Point (since 1984) and Ma On Shan (since 1997). He died in April 2001 at the age of 98{{sic}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.scmp.com/article/344588/father-hong-kong-buses-dies-aged-98|title='Father of Hong Kong Buses' dies aged 98|newspaper=South China Morning Post|publication-place=Hong Kong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Offshore Leaks''' is the name of a report disclosing details of 130,000 offshore accounts in April 2013. Some observers have called it the biggest hit against international tax fraud of all times (to date), although it has been pointed out that normal businesses may use the offshore legislation to ease formalities in international trade.&lt;ref name=Zeit.de&gt;{{cite news|title=Riesiger Datensatz enthüllt Geheimgeschäfte in Steueroasen|url=http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2013-04/steueroasen-dokumente-offshore-leak|accessdate=4 April 2013|newspaper=Zeit}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ICIJ Secret Files Expose"&gt;{{cite news|title=Secret Files Expose Offshore’s Global Impact|url=http://www.icij.org/offshore/secret-files-expose-offshores-global-impact|accessdate=4 April 2013|newspaper=ICIJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report originated from the Washington D.C.-based investigative journalism nonprofit, the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] (ICIJ), who collaborated with reporters around the world to produce the series of investigative reports published in connection with ICIJ's ''The Global [[Muckraker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;ICIJ [http://www.icij.org/blog The Global Muckraker] 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation is based on a cache of 2.5 million secret records about the offshore assets of people from 170 countries and territories, obtained by ICIJ's director, [[Gerard Ryle]].&lt;ref name="ICIJ Secret Files Expose" /&gt; The ICIJ Offshore Leaks Database is headed with the cautionary paragraph: "There are legitimate uses for offshore companies and trusts. We do not intend to suggest or imply that any persons, companies or other entities included in the ICIJ Offshore Leaks Database have broken the law or otherwise acted improperly."

More than 100 journalists from more than 60 countries and dozens of news organizations have taken part in the investigation, which has since expanded to include revelations about the offshore holdings of China's business and political elites.

In Brazil, ICIJ's criteria for selecting journalists has been criticized for lack of transparency. The journalists chosen by ICIJ are part of media conglomerates that could potentially have connections with offshore account owners.

Paulo]]) and O Globo (from military dictatorship backers [[Grupo Globo]]) journalists might pick and disclose names according to political bias rather than public interest eventually led investigative reporter Amaury Ribeiro Jr. to leave the ICIJ.&lt;ref name="Viomundo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viomundo.com.br/denuncias/amaury-ribeiro-jr-deixa-o-comite-de-jornalistas-investigativos-com-suspeita-de-que-ele-investiga-um-lado.html|title=HSBC: Amaury Ribeiro Jr. deixa o Comitê de Jornalistas Investigativos - Viomundo - O que você não vê na mídia|date=19 February 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paper engineering''' is a branch of engineering that deals with the usage of [[physical science]] (e.g. chemistry and physics) and life sciences (e.g. [[biology]] and [[biochemistry]]) in conjunction with [[mathematics]] as applied to the converting of raw materials into useful [[paper]] products and co-products.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.industrysolutions.siemens.com/paper/en/index.htm |title=Siemens AG. Pulp and Paper Technologies. |date= |work= |publisher=[[Siemens AG]] |accessdate=November 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field applies various principles in [[process engineering]] and [[unit operations]] to the manufacture of [[paper]], [[paper chemicals|chemicals]], [[energy]] and related materials. The following timeline shows some of the key steps in the development of the science of chemical and bioprocess engineering:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pafko.com/history/h_intro.html  History of Chemical Engineering] – at North Carolina State University (and in general).&lt;/ref&gt;

From a heritage perspective, the field encompasses the design and analysis of a wide variety of thermal, chemical and biochemical [[unit operations]] employed in the manufacture of pulp and paper, and addresses the preparation of its raw materials from trees or other natural resources via a [[Wood pulp|pulp]]ing process, chemical and mechanical pretreatment of these recovered [[biopolymer]] (e.g. principally, although not solely, [[cellulose]]-based) fibers in a fluid suspension, the high-speed forming and initial dewatering of a non-woven web, the development of bulk sheet properties via control of energy and mass transfer operations, as well as post-treatment of the sheet with coating, calendering, and other chemical and mechanical processes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Applications==
Today, the field of paper and chemical engineering is applied to the manufacture of a wide variety of products. The (bio)[[chemical industry]] scope manufactures organic and [[agrochemicals]] (fertilizers, insecticides, herbicides), [[oleochemicals]], fragrances and flavors, food, [[Fodder|feed]], [[pharmaceuticals]], [[nutraceuticals]], [[chemicals]], [[polymers]] and power from biological materials.

The resulting products of paper engineering including paper, cardboard, and various paper derivatives are widely used in everyday life. In addition to being a subset of chemical engineering, the field of paper engineering is closely linked to [[forest management]], product [[recycling]], and the mass production of paper – based media.

==Methods==

===Mechanical pulping===
In the process of mechanical pulping, "grinding" and "refining" are the two main methods used to create the pulp. Grinding is the method of pressing logs and chips against a turning stone to produce fibers. Refiner pulping is treating wood chips with chemicals or heat and then crushing the objects between two disks, one or both of which are rotating. There are four main types of refiner pulping, which includes refiner mechanical pulping, thermo-mechanical pulping, chemi-mechanical pulping, and chemithermomechanical pulping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.washington.edu/classes.pse.476/Powerpoint/Powerpoint-Renata/pse%20476-2%20mechanical%20pulping.ppt  |title=Pulping and Bleaching |author= R. Gustafson |date=n.d. |work= |publisher= University of Washington |accessdate=November 23, 2010 | first= | last= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further descriptions of each process are contained in this link:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfr.washington.edu/classes.pse.476/Powerpoint/Powerpoint-Renata/pse%20476-2%20mechanical%20pulping.ppt&lt;/ref&gt;
Mechanical pulping, when compared to chemical pulping, is relatively inexpensive and has a high pulp yield (85–95%). However, the paper created is generally weak since it retains the lignin.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Chemical pulping===
The process of [[chemical pulping]] is used to chemically disband the [[lignin]] found in the cell walls of the material undergoing the process. After the [[cellulose]] fibers are separated from the lignin, a pulp is created which can then be treated to create durable paper, boxes, and corrugated cardboard. Chemical pulping can be characterized by two main methods: sulfate ([[Kraft process]]) pulping and sulfite pulping, and these two methods have different benefits. Sulfate pulping can be performed on a wide range of tree varieties and results in the creation of a strong type of paper. Conversely, sulfite pulping results in a higher volume of pulp which is easier to bleach and process. However, sulfate pulping is more widely used since the product is more durable and the chemicals used in the process can be recovered, thus resulting in minimal environmental pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/air/pdfs/pulpmil3.pdf  |title=Chemical Pulp Mills |author= Washington State Department of Ecology |date=n.d. |work= |publisher= |accessdate=November 23, 2010 | first= | last= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further pulp processing===
{{Main|Paper machine}}

The pulp is then processed through an apparatus which renders the pulp as a mesh of fibers. This fiber network is then pressed to remove all water contents, and the paper is subsequently dried to remove all traces of moisture.

===Finishing===
{{Main|Paper}}

After the above processes have been completed, the resulting paper is coated with a minuscule amount of [[china clay]] or [[calcium carbonate]] to modify the surface, and the paper is then re-sized depending on its intended purpose.

===Product recycling ===
{{Main|Paper recycling}}

Generally, the material to be recycled first undergoes mechanical or chemical pulping to render it in pulp form. The resulting pulp is then processed in the same way normal pulp is processed; however, original fiber is sometimes added to enhance the quality and appearance of the product.

'''About Produce Marketing Association                                 '''

The '''Produce Marketing Association''' ('''PMA''') is a global [[trade association]] whose 2200 members represent the full [[supply chain]] of the [[produce]] and mass-market floral industry, from seed producer to [[supermarket]] or [[foodservice]] outlet.  It was founded in 1949.  Mike O'Brien of Schnucks Markets in St. Louis, MO is the current chairman of the board of directors.  The CEO is Bryan Silbermann, and the president is Cathy Burns.  PMA sponsors an annual convention and exposition called Fresh Summit. 

PMA has 2,900-member companies in 54 countries. The company focuses on the five-following member needs: Demand Creation, Global Connections, Science &amp; Technology, Industry Talent and Sustainability.

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pma.com/about-pma/history|title=History|website=www.pma.com|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''History:''' Formed in 1949 during the inaugural National Conference on Prepackaging, PMA (then Produce Prepackaging Association) was led by Paul B. Dickman and aimed to revolutionize the produce industry by delivering member networking and educational opportunities.

In 1958, official headquarters moved from New York to Newark, Delaware, with Robert Carey as Executive Secretary. This marks a turning point for the organization.

The organization officially changed its name to Produce Marketing Association in 1970. This is when PMA created three operating division to address increasing member demand for services: retailer, producer and distributor.

In 1974 PMA joined the floral industry when it formed the Floral Marketing Division to represent mass-market floral members.

The Produce Electronic Identification Board (PEIB) was created by PMA in 1987 to administer standardized Price Look-Up (PLU) codes. The following year, in 1988, PMA joined with United Fresh &amp; Vegetable Association to establish the Center for Produce Quality.

In 1989 Bob Carey became President of PMA after three decades of service to the association.

PMA.com was launched in 1995, establishing the association as an online destination for produce industry members. By taking advantage of new communications technologies to connect to members worldwide, the association could now provide 24-hour access to information and create a virtual trade show.

In 1996 Bryan Silbermann succeeded Bob Carey as President and CEO. During his time with PMA Bryan Silbermann helped standardize PLU/UPC codes, spearheaded the Produce Traceability Initiative (PTI), began the import-export committee that became the International Trade Committee to Global Strategy and Development committees. Silbermann also helped institute the Produce for Better Health (PBH) program, FNV, Center for Produce Quality, Center for Produce Safety and Partnership for Food Safety Education, along with many other achievements during his time with PMA.

PMA initiated the Pack Family/Career Pathways Program in 2004, which would later be re-named the Center for Growing Talent.

In 2017 Cathy Burns succeeded Bryan Silbermann as CEO of PMA. Burns currently holds the CEO position at PMA.

'''Projector PSA, Inc.''' is a developer of cloud-based [[professional services automation]] (PSA) software.

== History ==

Projector PSA was started in 2002 by a group of employees at [[Agency.com]]. Their self-developed application used to manage Agency.com became the prototype for Projector PSA's main software offering, Projector. In 2003 Projector PSA, Inc. was formed and in mid-2004 they released the first version of Projector.&lt;ref name="MSPmentor"&gt;{{cite web

The '''Sarkies Brothers''', '''Martin''' (1852–1912), '''Tigran''' (1861–1912), '''Aviet''' (1862–1923), and '''Arshak''' (1868–1931), were a group of brothers of [[Armenians|Armenian]] ethnicity best known for founding a chain of luxury [[hotel]]s throughout [[Southeast Asia]]. The brothers were born in [[Isfahan]], [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="amassia"&gt;[http://www.amassia.com.au/Raffles.htm The History of Armenians in Singapore and Malaysia]. Amassia.com.au. Retrieved on 2011-10-23.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was 23-year-old Tigran who took the first step into the hotel industry, seeing it as more profitable than his fledgeling auctioneering business. Taking over the lease of a large compound house at 1A Light Street, [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], [[Penang]], he named it the [[Eastern &amp; Oriental Hotel|Eastern Hotel]] (now Eastern &amp; Oriental Hotel), announcing on 15 April 1884 that the hotel was open to receive boarders.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amassia.com.au/Raffles.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The brothers went on to found several hotels in the region, including the [[Raffles Hotel]] in [[Singapore]], and the [[Strand Hotel]] in [[Rangoon]] (Yangon).

Arshak, the last of the brothers, died on January 9, 1931.  On June 10 of the same year, a bankruptcy case was filed against the Raffles Hotel, eventually resulting in the Sarkies family losing control of their hotels.&lt;ref name="famoushotels"/&gt;  

The Sarkies name still lives on in Singapore through the namesake Sarkies Road. However, the road was named after Regina Sarkies (née Carapiet), the wife of Arathoon Sarkies, who was a cousin of the brothers and fellow hotelier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Respected citizens: the history of Armenians in Singapore and Malaysia|publisher=Amassia Publishing|date=2003|first=Nadia H.|last=Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=Proud of the legendary Sarkies name|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/proud-of-the-legendary-sarkies-name|work=[[The Straits Times]]|date=September 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Sarkies Corner, the [[Coffeehouse|coffee shop]] in the Eastern &amp; Oriental Hotel, is named after the brothers.

'''Shanghai Metal Exchange''' (SHME), one of the national level [[futures exchange]]s of [[China]], was established on 28 May 1992. SHME is a non-profit, self-regulating corporation. The exchange was created for trading in non-ferrous [[metal]]s and currently contracts for several non-ferrous metals including [[copper]], [[aluminum]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[tin]], [[nickel]].

SHME is located in the city of [[Shanghai]] and its [[geographical]] location bridges the time gap between [[London Metal Exchange]] and [[New York Mercantile Exchange]] markets, thus enabling traders across the world to have a 24-hour access to [[futures contract]]s of non-ferrous metals. SHME is currently the largest non-ferrous metals futures exchange in China and the third largest exchange of its kind in the world.

'''Southwell Business Park''' is a business park on the [[Isle of Portland]], [[Dorset]], [[England]]. It is housed at the former Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment, which closed in 1995 and became the Southwell Business Park in 1997.

==History==
[[Image:Southwell Business Park (ex-AUWE Portland) 3.JPG|thumb|The establishment as it remains today, now the Southwell Business Park.]]
[[Image:South West Coast Path Portland Dorset.jpg|thumb|The establishment can be clearly seen on the skyline from various parts of Portland, particularly from the South West Coast Path which runs around the edge of the establishment.]]
The Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment, built as a Gunnery Establishment at the beginning of the Cold War, was closed in 1995 alongside Portland's naval base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Legg|first=Rodney|title=Portland Encyclopaedia|year=1999|publisher=Dorset Publishing Company|isbn=978-0948699566|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jurassicagent1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jurassicagent.co.uk/index.php/library/history/deadly-weapons/55-underwater-research|title=The Jurassic Coast - Underwater Research|publisher=jurassicagent.co.uk|accessdate=2014-07-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726022607/http://www.jurassicagent.co.uk/index.php/library/history/deadly-weapons/55-underwater-research|archivedate=2014-07-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment buildings remained empty for two years, until Roy Haywood and Ray Bulpit, whose business was the acquisition and development of former military sites, purchased the site in 1997.&lt;ref name="dorsetlife1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dorsetlife.co.uk/2008/10/a-portland-success-story/ |title=A Portland Success Story &amp;#124; Dorset Life - The Dorset Magazine |publisher=Dorset Life |date= |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first tenants of Southwell Business Park arrived that year, and the park continued to expand its range of business tenants. In the 2000s, the site was recorded as employing almost 500 people and being home to over 100 businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geoffkirby.co.uk/Portland/680700/ |title=Southwell Business Park |publisher=Geoffkirby.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that the total turnover generated at the park from 1997 to 2008 reached over £200 million.&lt;ref name="dorsetlife1"/&gt;

In 2006, work commenced on developing unused parts of the park, including an unused 1970s-built wing, into the Portland Spa and an 80-bedroom hotel, known as the Venue Hotel. Completed in 2007, the spa included a gym, a fitness studio and an indoor swimming pool.&lt;ref name="dorsetlife1"/&gt; The Orchid Restaurant was also converted from the former AUWE canteen.

'''''Squawk on the Street''''', which debuted on December 19, 2005, is a business show on [[CNBC]] that follows the first 90 minutes of trading on [[Wall Street]] in the [[United States]].

Originally airing as a one-hour program, the show doubled its airtime to two hours on July 19, 2007 (due in part to [[Liz Claman]]'s departure from the network).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cnbc/cnbcs_new_mornings_squawk_on_the_street_expands_to_two_hours_63384.asp#more mediabistro.com: TVNewser&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  This replaced the first hour of ''[[Morning Call (CNBC)|Morning Call]]'' (later renamed ''[[The Call (CNBC)|The Call]]'' on August 8, 2007), which aired one hour later and had its airtime reduced in half.  On October 17, 2011, ''Squawk on the Street'' was expanded to 3 hours, from 9am to noon ET.  ''The Call'' was canceled as a result of this program's expansion.  On May 19, 2014, ''Squawk on the Street'' reverted to 2 hours (9am to 11am ET) as a new program, ''[[Squawk Alley]]'', debuted on that day.

==About the show==
''Squawk on the Street'', which is seen at 9:00am [[North American Eastern Time Zone|ET]], is broadcast live at the [[New York Stock Exchange]].  [[Mark Haines]] and [[Erin Burnett]] were the original co-anchors at the NYSE.  Haines (the original host of ''[[Squawk Box]]''), died on May 24, 2011, 18 days after Burnett left CNBC (May 6, 2011) to host CNN's ''Outfront'' (see below Mark Haines).  [[David Faber (CNBC)|David Faber]] (who also hosts and contributes to his "Faber Report" segments) originally reported from CNBC Global Headquarters, while Haines and Burnett were in the "Squawk Nest," or "Luxury Box" (as Haines called it) above the [[NYSE]].  Contributors include [[Bob Pisani]] ([[NYSE]]), [[Bertha Coombs]] and Scott Wapner.  Coombs and Wapner were the original [[NASDAQ]] contributors, Wapner left the show in 2010 focusing to host on ''Fast Money Halftime Report'' and was replaced by [[Seema Mody]]. Leaving Coombs remained in that report along with Mody, were [[Sharon Epperson]]  ([[NYMEX]]) and [[Rick Santelli]] ([[Chicago Mercantile Exchange|CME Group]]).

On July 11, 2011, ''Squawk on the Street'' debuted an entirely new anchor team at the NYSE.  [[Carl Quintanilla]] (previously co-anchor of ''Squawk Box''), [[Melissa Lee (journalist)|Melissa Lee]] (anchor of ''[[Fast Money (CNBC)|Fast Money]]'' and ''Options Action'') and Simon Hobbs (previously a presenter on [[CNBC Europe]]) were appointed as the new anchor team.  ''[[Mad Money]]'' host [[Jim Cramer]] joined Quintanilla and Lee as a contributor for the first hour, with Hobbs joining Quintanilla and Lee as a third anchor for the duration.  The following year (2012), Faber was moved from the network's Englewood Cliffs studio to a new trading-floor studio set (which replaced the old above-the-floor set that had been used since 2005) at the NYSE.  The trading-floor studio set located in Post 9 at the NYSE, which debuted in 2012, is shared with ''[[Squawk Alley]]'' and ''[[Closing Bell]]''.

On April 1, 2013, Lee was removed from her anchoring duties on ''Squawk on the Street'' and continues on as anchor of ''Fast Money'' and ''Options Action''.  On May 17, 2013, [[Kelly Evans]] (previously the co-anchor of ''[[Worldwide Exchange]]'', which was originally based in [[CNBC Europe|CNBC Europe's headquarters at Fleet Place]] in London; now the co-anchor of ''[[Closing Bell]]''), became the new co-anchor of ''Squawk on the Street'', her assignment began three days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/its-official-kelly evans-named-squawk-on-the-street-co-anchor_b179822|title=It’s Official: Kelly Evans Named ‘Squawk On The Street’ Co-Anchor|work=TVNewser|last=Werpin|first=Alex|date=May 17, 2013|accessdate=May 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans officially left her anchoring duties to ''Closing Bell'' at the end of 2013 and was replaced by Sara Eisen, who was previously had a contributing role. Sara became a permanent co-anchor in May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cnbc-adds-squawk-alley-to-daytime-lineup_b225143 | title=CNBC Adds ‘Squawk Alley’ to Daytime Lineup | publisher=TV Newser | date=May 15, 2014 | accessdate=May 27, 2014 | author=Knox, Merrill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 13, 2014, ''Squawk on the Street'', along with CNBC's other trading-day programs, launched in full 1080i high-definition as part of a network-wide switch to a full 16:9 letterbox presentation on that same day.

As of November 29, 2018, [[Sara Eisen]] now also co-hosts ''[[Closing Bell]]'', along with [[Wilfred Frost]].  Eisen had previously co-anchored ''[[Worldwide Exchange]]'', also alongside Frost, from January 4, 2018 through March 9, 2018 and after that, ''[[Power Lunch]]'' from March 12, 2018 to November 28, 2018.

* [[David Faber (CNBC)|David Faber]] (2005–present)
* [[Jim Cramer]] (2011–present)
* [[Sara Eisen]] (2014–present), now also co-anchor of ''[[Closing Bell]]''

==Program format==
The show begins with the co-anchors and Jim Cramer on the floor of the [[NYSE]], and  "The Rundown" segment, starting with [[Bob Pisani]] on the floor at the NYSE. The other market pre-open segments include the "Word on the Street" segment, in which either the co-anchors talk to a trader on the floor of the NYSE, and "Instant Analysis," in which either Quintanilla or Faber (or both) talk to an analyst either via satellite or on set.

Around the midway point of the show's first hour was originally the "Opening Bell Countdown," which had a countdown clock on the lower right of the screen.  However, since Cramer joined ''Squawk on the Street'' in July 2011, the "Opening Bell Countdown" segment has been replaced with "Cramer's Mad Dash."  After the opening bells ring at the NYSE and [[NASDAQ]] MarketSite, Quintanilla, Cramer and Faber send viewers through the opening minutes of the trading day with the "Opening Buzz" segment (see below).  The show originally ended with the anchors looking at the "Stocks to Watch."

==Current and previous segments==
* Jim Cramer, if he's on the set, talks to the ''[[Squawk Box]]'' hosts, usually 5-10 minutes before the show starts.
* Around the Horn: A brief summary of pre-market news; seen at the start of the show.
* The Rundown: This segment (seen just after the start of each hour of the show) starts with Bob Pisani on the floor at the NYSE, then continues with market reporters at the NASDAQ, the NYMEX and in Chicago (usually Santelli).  Each of the reporters narrate pre-market news headlines in turn.
* Word on the Street: A market pre-open segment in which Haines or Burnett (or both) talk to an analyst on the floor of the NYSE.
* Instant Analysis: A market pre-open segment in which Haines or Burnett (or both) talk to an analyst either via satellite or on set, similar to the "Word on the Street" segment mentioned above.
* The Faber Report: This segment features David Faber tracking the US companies and stocks making news.  This segment, however, is not seen when Faber is off, or on assignment.
* Five for Five: Seen on Mondays during the first hour with Jon Hilsenrath from ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', who tells the anchors on set his five things to look for throughout the week.  
* Cramer's Mad Dash: Introduced in July 2011, Faber and Jim Cramer look at the stocks making news at the pre-open.
* Opening Bell Countdown: This segment, which has a [[countdown clock]] on the lower right of the screen where the network bug is usually seen (also used on ''[[Closing Bell]]''), features final pre-open thoughts (time permitting), as well as the ringing of the opening bells at the NYSE and NASDAQ.
* Opening Buzz: After the opening bells ring at the NYSE and NASDAQ, Haines and Burnett send viewers through the opening minutes of the trading day with reporters at the NYSE, NASDAQ, NYMEX, and so on.  This is very similar to the aforementioned "Rundown" segment, as explained above.
* Weekly Energy Inventory Data: Seen at 10:30am ET on Wednesdays and Thursdays, [[Sharon Epperson]] reports from the [[NYMEX]] on the weekly energy inventory data for [[crude oil]], [[gasoline]], [[distillates]], refinery capacity (on Wednesdays) and [[natural gas]] (on Thursdays).  This segment, which formerly aired during the now-discontinued first hour of ''The Call'' (formerly ''[[Morning Call (CNBC)|Morning Call]]''), is now seen during the second hour of ''Squawk on the Street'' as of 2007-07-25.
* Six in 60: This segment gives the show's anchors (Haines and Burnett) 60 seconds to look at the 6 stocks viewers are watching.  This one-minute segment debuted on the 2007-03-06 broadcast.
* [[MSNBC]] News Update: News headlines from MSNBC.  Seen during the final half-hour.
* West Coast Wake-Up: Seen during the second hour, a guest from the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] joins the program.
* Inside the Numbers: CNBC's [[Steve Liesman]] breaks down the day's economic numbers.
* Cash Crop: CNBC's West Coast-based reporter [[Jane Wells]] takes a weekly look at how crops are affecting the businesses, the economy, and the industry.  Seen on Thursdays.
* Squawk Around the World: This occasional segment, which debuted on 2008-04-09, takes a look at the economic diaries of different regions outside of the US.
* The European Close: This segment, which debuted on October 17, 2011 following the cancellation of ''The Call'' at 11:30 am ET, on the last 30 minutes of the show.  Simon Hobbs reports on closing of the European stocks.  This segment was moved to ''Squawk Alley'' on May 19, 2014.
* "Stop Trading!": This segment, which previously aired on the US version of ''Street Signs'', was moved to the end of this program's first hour on February 9, 2015.

==Overview==
The book starts with a comparison of the two main ways to influence human behaviour: manipulation and inspiration. Sinek argues that inspiration is the more powerful and sustainable of the two.

==The golden circle&lt;!--Section linked from [[Reflective practice]]: do not rename without fixing incoming link (see [[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;==
[[File:Golden circle.png|thumb|upright=0.75|The golden circle diagram, redrawn from ''Start With Why'']]
Sinek says people are inspired by a sense of purpose (or "Why"), and that this should come first when communicating, before "How" and "What". Sinek calls this triad ''the golden circle'', a diagram of a bullseye (or [[concentric circles]] or [[onion diagram]]) with "Why" in the innermost circle (representing people's motives or purposes), surrounded by a ring labeled "How" (representing people's processes or methods), enclosed in a ring labeled "What" (representing results or outcomes). He goes on to speculate about the biological factors behind this structure, such as the [[limbic system]].

== Reception ==
Ken Krogue, in a [[blog]] post for ''[[Forbes]]'', argued that it is far more important, especially for [[salespeople]], to find the right person (which Krogue called "starting with Who") before "starting with Why": {{Quote|Great salespeople always start with Who. Then they move to Why, What, and How. And then eventually to When, and How Much.&amp;nbsp;... Now once you get to the right Who, Simon Sinek is spot-on about beginning the conversation with Why. The Why is a game changer in selling modern technology.&lt;ref name="Krogue"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenkrogue/2015/07/06/simon-sinek-says-start-with-why-but-sales-experts-disagree/|title=Simon Sinek Says 'Start With Why,' But Sales Experts Disagree|last=Krogue|first=Ken|work=[[Forbes]]|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Haines''' (1945–2012) was an American [[organizational theorist]], [[management consultant]], author of books on  management   and [[systems thinking]].&lt;ref name="SGH00"&gt;Stephen G. Haines (2000). ''The Manager's Pocket Guide to Systems Thinking''. p.157.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Stephen Haines earned a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in  Engineering  from the [[United States Naval Academy]]. He also worked for a doctorate in Management  and [[Educational Psychology]] from [[Temple University]], but did not complete the dissertation He received a [[Master of Science in Administration]] in [[Organization Development]] under [[Richard F.

Retrieved June 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, Haines worked as an executive and consultant. He was Executive Vice President of Imperial Corporation of America,&lt;ref name="SGH00"/&gt; a nationwide financial services firm that filed for bankruptcy in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Barth, Susanne Trimbath, Glenn Yago (2004). ''The savings and loan crisis''. Springer, 2004. {{ISBN|1-4020-7871-4}} p.266-276.&lt;/ref&gt; and Senior Vice President of [[Freddie Mac]].

== Work ==

=== Strategic Management System ===
To develop a strategic management system, Haines (2000) suggested using the "Systems Thinking Approach" and its five-phased (ABCDE) Systems Thinking model that invites the leader to ask and answer five important questions:&lt;ref&gt;Carrie Regenstein, Barbara I. Dewey (2003). ''Leadership, higher education, and the information age: a new era for information technology and libraries''. Neal-Schuman Publishers. {{ISBN|1-55570-455-7}}. p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SGH002"&gt;Stephen G. Haines (2000). ''The systems thinking approach to strategic planning and management''. pp.43-44&lt;/ref&gt; 
:(A) Where do we want to be?
:(B) How will we know when we get there?
:(C) Where are we right now?
:(D) How do we get there from here?, and
:(E) What is changing in the future external environment, that we need to take into account?
These five questions "align directly with the five phases of a system: (1) output, (2) feedback loop, (3) input, and (4) throughput/actions (5) within the dynamic and changing environment".&lt;ref name="SGH002"/&gt;

== Publications ==
Haines wrote more than 16 books, over 50 articles, and developed 12 volumes of the Haines' Strategic Library.&lt;ref&gt;The Haines' Strategic Library contains over 7,000 pages—Planning, Leadership, HR, Change, Customer Value, and Systems Thinking.&lt;/ref&gt; A selection:

'''Stewart Tan Seng Teong''' is a Chinese [[motorsport]] executive, founder and general manager of [[Zhuhai International Circuit]] in [[Guangdong]] province.

==Career==
Stewart Tan Seng Teong was born and raised in a big Chinese family in [[Penang]], Malaysia. His family has a name in the Chinese medical field. Instead of taking over the family company, he engaged in other business activities. He worked in the Hong Kong share market during the late 80s, and has experience in managing shares and investments especially those in China. He was also the co-founder of the Chinese chocolate brand, Le Conte, later moving on from that business.

In 1992, he worked with the city government of [[Zhuhai]] to build the first motor racing circuit in China, which became Zhuhai International Circuit. He also took part in organising the first official [[street racing]] circuit in Zhuhai, on which events were held between 1993 and 1995 before the permanent circuit was built. In 1994, he and his group of organizers brought the BPR Global Endurance GT to Zhuhai.

In 1997, Tan partnered with [[Elf Aquitaine|Elf]] and [[Renault]] of France to bring “Formula Campus” (a junior formula) to China, established Formula Racing Development Ltd (FRD Motorsports). At the same time he set up the first racing school in China and organized China’s first formula racing series.

He was the Team Principal of the Volkswagen China (FAW) Factory Rally Team in 1999. The car used at that time was the [[Volkswagen Jetta]].

From 2004 to 2007, Tan brought [[FIA GT Championship]] to Zhuhai International Circuit. In 2006, he created the Pan Delta Super Racing Festival, a regular event that included the Circuit Hero race. Race drivers, race fans and the media in the Pearl River Delta region took part in this festival, and it attracted sponsors including [[Frestech]], [[Red Bull]], [[Coca-Cola]], and [[Audi]].

In 2007, Tan worked with China Motor Sport Association (CMSA) to create the China Superbike Championship, with two races in Zhuhai, one in Beijing and one in Shanghai. Over the 5 years, Tongyi Iced Tea and Yulin Pharmaceutical have sponsored that championship. In December of the same year, A1GP [[World Cup of Motorsport]] came to the track; in this race A1 Team China driver [[Cheng Congfu]] achieved a podium finish. Due to his series of successes in 2007, Stewart was awarded the “Man of the Year” by [[Autonews]] Magazine at the Golden Autosport Awards in 2008.

Tan is currently the General Manager of Zhuhai International Circuit Ltd. In 2010 and 2011, under his leadership, the circuit signed an agreement with Automobile Club de l’Ouest to bring the [[Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]] to Zhuhai. In 2011, the Zhuhai Municipal Government also hosted a China Zhuhai International Motor Sport Festival to help promote the event in the city.

'''''The Money Programme''''' was a finance and business affairs television programme on [[BBC Two]] which had a [[List of longest-running TV shows by category|long run]].

It was first broadcast on 5 April 1966 and presented by "commentators" (financial journalists) [[William Davis (journalist)|William Davis]], [[Erskine Barton Childers|Erskine B. Childers]] and Joe Roeber. At this time [[David Attenborough]] was the controller of BBC2. The programme has a memorable [[Theme music|theme tune]], a version of the main title theme from ''[[The Carpetbaggers (film)|The Carpetbaggers]]'' film by [[Lalo Schifrin]] (which appeared on an album by jazz organist [[Jimmy Smith (musician)|Jimmy Smith]]), then by 1989, the programme was updated with new arrangements composed by George Fenton. 

The programme used a magazine style starting in the 1980s, but changed to a single subject documentary in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/03/bbc.television |title=BBC's Money Programme series to become one-off specials  |work=The Guardian |first=Leigh |last=Holmwood |date=3 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently the programme has formed a partnership with the [[Open University#Business school|Open University Business School]]. The [[Open University]] provides input into programmes and supplementary materials written by OU Business School academics.

On 1 June 2007, an episode of the ''Money Programme'' called "Virtual World / Real Millions" became the first full [[BBC]] programme to have been broadcast inside the virtual world [[Second Life]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/05_may/24/money.shtml BBC – Press Office – Money Programme is first BBC show to broadcast in Second Life&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; That episode featured an interview with Second Life founder and CEO [[Philip Rosedale]] amongst others.

This programme was parodied in Series 3 of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' as the opening sketch of the third episode in that series first airing on the BBC 3 November 1972.&lt;ref name="montypython"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2656">{{Nihongo|'''Tokumei kumiai'''|匿名組合}}, literally "anonymous partnerships," are a [[Japan]]ese [[bilateral contract]] governed by the Commercial Code of Japan, Article 535 ''et seq''.&lt;ref name="art535"&gt;[http://ja.wikibooks.org/wiki/%E5%95%86%E6%B3%95%E7%AC%AC535%E6%9D%A1 Japanese Commercial Code, article 535]&lt;/ref&gt; In English, they are often called '''TK''' or '''silent partnerships'''. In many respects they are similar to [[common law]] [[limited partnership]]s.

In a tokumei kumiai arrangement, {{Nihongo|"anonymous (or silent) partners"|匿名組合員|tokumei kumiai'in}} invest in a venture operated by a {{Nihongo|manager|営業者|eigyōsha}}.&lt;ref name="art535" /&gt;

By law, the partnership itself has no [[Juristic person|legal personality]]. Any assets of the partnership are the property of the manager; however, the anonymous partners have a right to a share of any profits from the venture, as provided in the partnership agreement. Anonymous partners have [[limited liability]] for the partnership's debts, on the condition that they are anonymous. If an anonymous partner allows their name to be used in the name of the manager or in the name of the partnership, the anonymous partner loses their limited liability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ja.wikibooks.org/wiki/%E5%95%86%E6%B3%95%E7%AC%AC536%E6%9D%A1 Japanese Commercial Code, article 536]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tokumei kumiai are often used for investment funds. A structure known as the "Dutch TK" was once popular among foreign investors in Japan, as it was possible to recognize income from Japan through a Dutch anonymous partner in a tokumei kumiai without paying Japanese income or withholding taxes under the tax treaty of 1970. This loophole was closed by a new tax treaty in August 2010, which imposes a 20% withholding tax on distributions through such structures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taxand.com/news/newsletters/New_Dutch_Japanese_Tax_Treaty_Signed_Benefits_Investors&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has become popular to use a tokumei kumiai together with a [[godo kaisha]] to hold a [[Land trust|trust]] [[beneficial interest]] in real estate using what is known as a "TK/GK scheme."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amendment To The Japanese Real Estate Joint Enterprise Act: Will It Benefit Overseas Investors?|url=http://mondaq.com/x/254384/real+estate/Amendment+to+the+Japanese+Real+Estate+Joint+Enterprise+Act+Will+It+Benefit+Overseas+Investors|publisher=[[Jones Day]]|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
