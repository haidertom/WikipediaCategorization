:''This article refers to the United Kingdom based record label and should not be confused with [[Agitprop! Records]].''

'''Agit-Prop Records''' was an [[independent record label]] founded in 1985 by the members of the punk band [[Chumbawamba]].

==History==
Before starting the label, Chumbawamba had distributed their records and [[cassette culture|tapes]] using the [[Sky and Trees Records|Sky and Trees]] label. As well as releasing their own recordings, Agit-Prop also put out a number of records by other groups.

Agit-Prop was run in co-op form adhering to [[anarchism|anarchist]] philosophy.

Agit-Prop released its last album, ''[[Shhh (Chumbawumba album)|Shhh]]'', in 1992. Chumbawamba felt it was too much work to maintain a band and a label. Band member [[Alice Nutter (musician)|Alice Nutter]] adds: 
::We realised long ago while still running Agit-Prop that we were existing within a [[capitalism|capitalist system]], and belonging to a small but pure [[indie label|indie]] ghetto wasn't going to have any effect other than making us feel holy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chumba.com/_faquestions.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050204194903/http://www.chumba.com/_faquestions.htm |archivedate=4 February 2005 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The label was disbanded, and Chumbawamba signed onto [[One Little Indian Records]].

==Name==
The term "agit prop" originates from the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Agitprop|Department for Agitation and Propaganda]].

'''Art world economics''' is a relatively unexplored area of [[financial]] exchange that exists at the edges of the regular financial industry. Investment in [[art]] has been an accepted form of deposit investment for several decades such as the purchase of works by [[Matisse]], [[Van Gogh]] and [[Picasso]]. However these works only have an assured value as long as there is a restricted supply of works on the open market - i.e. the artist is dead or producing small numbers of works and that the [[Authenticity in art|authenticity]] of works can be verified by a small number of sources. In the case of contemporary artists it is the interest of collectors and therefore dealers to ensure a tightly controlled line of supply.

The intricacies of [[art world]] economics were exposed by the suit of the family of [[Mark Rothko]] against the Marlborough Fine Art Gallery brought during the 1970s. In an action known as the [[Rothko Case]], it was determined that Marlborough had knowingly manipulated their management of Rothko's works to maintain a higher sale price after his death, to the detriment of Rothko's family's interest in his estate.

The art market was hit by the 2008 financial crash; sales were down about 41 per cent by 2009, compared with a market peak of almost $66bn in 2007. Contemporary art was particularly badly hit, with sales in that category plunging almost 60 per cent over the two years 2008-09. However, by 2011 the value of sales had almost reached the record level of 2007, and they have remained between $56bn and $68bn in the years since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Boom amid the bust |url=https://www.ft.com/content/9c5e3fe8-85ea-11e8-9199-c2a4754b5a0e |website=The Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Avon Players''' is a [[nonprofit]] [[community theatre]] located along the banks of [[Stony Creek (Michigan)|Stony Creek]] in the Historic District of [[Rochester Hills, Michigan|Rochester Hills]], [[Michigan]]. Located two miles from the heart of downtown [[Rochester, Michigan|Rochester]], [[Michigan]]. Avon Players has served the [[Metro Detroit Area]] since 1947.

==History==
Avon Players was founded in 1947. Many of the original members had earlier been part of a church theatre group.

Avon Players owns its own playhouse, a unique multiple A-frame design, built in 1965. The governing body for the group consists of a nine-member [[Executive Board]] elected by active members at an annual meeting. The playhouse is located in the [[Historic district of Rochester Hills]].

==Typical season==
Volunteers bring to the stage five full-scale productions. Full scale means a computerized lighting system, sound effects equipment, costumes, live orchestra, completely constructed sets, and scenic backdrops painted by local talented artists.

Seasons have included award-winning dramas, British farces, Broadway musicals, and mysteries.

==Youth theatre==
In addition to five regular season offerings, Avon Players puts on a Youth Theatre production – either a musical or a large-cast play – for students in the sixth through twelfth grades.

Attired in an orange dhoti, his body is enitirely red.  On the three points of his tiny crown, budding lotuses have been fixed. {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} holds in his two right hands the rosary and a cup filled with three modakas (a fourth substituted by the curving trunk is just about to be tasted). In his two left hands, {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} holds a large lotus above and an axe below, with its handle leaning against his shoulder.  In the {{IAST|Mudgalapurāṇa}} (VII, 70), in order to kill the demon of egotism ({{IAST|Mamāsura}}) who had attacked him, {{IAST|Gaṇeśa Vighnarāja}} throws his lotus at him.

== History ==

Immortalised by its artistic eminences and its connoisseur patrons, Basohli today is a metaphor for a vigorous, bold and imaginative artistic style, rich, stylish and unconventional. A style of painting characterized by vigorous use of primary colours and a peculiar facial formula prevailed in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries in the foothills of the Western [[Himalayas]] in the [[Jammu]] and [[Punjab region|Punjab]] States. The earliest paintings in this style have been dated to the time of [[Raja Kirpal Pal]] (1678–93).A Battle was fought at Basoli, it was called as the [[Battle of Basoli]] between [[Sikhs]] and [[Mughal Empire]] in 1702.&lt;ref name="CS"&gt;A Review of Basohli Style in Indian Painting, Chandramani Singh, Kailash - Journal of Himalayan Studies vol 2, Number 1&amp;2, 1974 [http://www.thdl.org/texts/reprints/kailash/kailash_02_0102_reviews.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Originating in [[Basohli State]], the style spread to the Hill States of [[Mankot]], [[Nurpur State|Nurpur]], [[Kullu|Kulu]], [[Mandi State|Mandi]], [[Suket State|Suket]], [[Bilaspur (princely state)|Bilaspur]], [[Nalagarh State|Nalagarh]], [[Chamba State|Chamba]], [[Guler State|Guler]] and [[Kangra State|Kangra]]. The first mention of Basohli painting is in the annual report of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] for the year published in 1921. Referring to the acquisitions of the Archaeological Section of the [[Lahore Museum|Central Museum]], [[Lahore]], the report states that "a series of old paintings of the Basohli School were purchased, and the Curator concludes that the Basohli Schools is possibly of pre-[[Moghul]] origin, and so called Tibeti pictures are nothing but late productions of this school".

'''''Brady Street Beasts''''' is a [[public art]] work by American artist Bill Reid located on the East Side of [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]] near Brady Street and the Holton Street Viaduct. The artwork consists of three creatures made of painted steel.&lt;ref name=Moriarty&gt;{{cite news|last=Moriarty|first=Judith Ann|title=Brady Street's Point of Inspiration|url=http://expressmilwaukee.com/article-15947-brady-streets-point-of-inspiration.html|accessdate=11 November 2012|newspaper=Shepherd Express|date=31 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

==Description==
''Brady Street Beasts'' includes a large blue reindeer accompanied by a red rat and a green dragonfly.&lt;ref name=Ng&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams-Ng|first=Stacey|title=Bill Reid's Moveable Beasts|url=http://toryfolliard.com/press/Reid-Review.shtml|work=Milwaukee Home and Fine Living Magazine|accessdate=11 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110705101047/http://toryfolliard.com/press/Reid-Review.shtml|archivedate=5 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sculptures are constructed from sheet metal welded together on top of a substructure of metal rods. The reindeer appears to have scaled to the top of an exhaust chimney above a [[public works]] building. Its yellow antlers extend into the sky, and it grasps a paint can from which blue liquid appears to flow into the opening of the chimney. On the opposite side of the chimney, the rat climbs upward. On the roof of the building adjacent to the chimney, a bug-eyed green dragonfly stands with a telescope to its eye. A nearby [[weather vane]] includes three words, each painted on a bar with two arrowheads on either end: water, reflection, good food.

'''Charles Augustus Howell''' (10 March 1840 – 21 April 1890) was an art dealer and alleged blackmailer who is best known for persuading the poet [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] to dig up the poems he buried with his wife [[Elizabeth Siddal]]. His reputation as a blackmailer inspired [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s Sherlock Holmes story, "[[The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton]]".&lt;ref name ="bas"&gt;Basbenes, Nicholas A. ''A Gentle Madness: Bibliophiles, Bibliomanes, and the Eternal Passion for Books'', p.15-16."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Howell was born in [[Oporto]], [[Portugal]] to an English father, Alfred William Hervey Howell, and a Portuguese mother.  He claimed to have aristocratic Portuguese ancestry, and would wear a red ribbon of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Portuguese Order of Christ]], which he proclaimed to be an inherited family order.&lt;ref name = "ggw"&gt;G. G. Williamson, ''Murray Marks and His Friends'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to Britain in his youth, allegedly after having been caught cheating at cards.&lt;ref name = "sam"&gt;Samuel C. Chew, ''Swinburne'', Little, Brown, and Company, Boston: 1929, p.67.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1858 Howell left Britain shortly before his friend [[Felice Orsini]] attempted to assassinate [[Napoleon III]], leading to rumours that he was involved in the plot. He returned in 1864.

Howell was the friend and business agent of both Rossetti and [[John Ruskin]]. Ruskin employed him as a secretary between 1865 and 1868. Ruskin trusted Howell with "affairs needing delicate handling and a wise discretion". This was usually to manage Ruskin's discreet charitable donations. But Howell sought increasingly to obtain complete control of Ruskin's finances.&lt;ref name = "ggw"/&gt; Eventually [[Edward Burne-Jones]] persuaded Ruskin to sever his connection with Howell.

According to Rossetti's brother [[William Michael Rossetti]], Howell was a skilful salesman "with his open manner, his winning address, with his exhaustless gift of amusing talk, not innocent of high colouring and actual blague – Howell was unsurpassable". His ability to exploit people's "hobbies and weaknesses" secured Rossetti several commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Hepworth, ''Blackmail: publicity and secrecy in everyday life'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 1975, p.55.&lt;/ref&gt; Howell organised the exhumation of Dante Gabriel Rossetti's wife [[Elizabeth Siddal]] and the retrieval of the poems he had left in her coffin in 1869. Rossetti insisted that the exhumation be kept absolutely secret.

Howell also became a business adviser to [[Algernon Swinburne]], becoming "not only his man of business but also the partner of his amusements and the recipient of his confidences". Some "burlesque and indecent letters" which Swinburne wrote to Howell were somehow acquired by George Redway, a publisher, who used them to blackmail Swinburne into giving up the copyright of one of his poems.&lt;ref name = "sam"/&gt; Swinburne blamed Howell, and after his death wrote that he hoped he was "in that particular circle of [[Malebolge]] where the coating of eternal excrement makes it impossible to see whether the damned dog's head is or is not tonsured".&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Freeman, ''Drama, Disaster and Disgrace in Late Victorian Britain'': Edinburgh University Press, 2011, p.208&lt;/ref&gt;

Howell's connection with the Rossetti family is said to have ended when he was alleged to have persuaded his lover [[Rosa Corder]] to create fake Rossetti drawings.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Rintoul, ''Dictionary of real people and places in fiction'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 1993, p.521.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883 Corder gave birth to Howell's daughter, who was christened Beatrice Ellen Howell.&lt;ref name = "whist"&gt;[http://www.whistler.arts.gla.ac.uk/correspondence/biog/display/?bid=Cord_R The Correspondence of James McNeill Whister]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Charlesaugustushowell.jpg|thumb|left|Charles Augustus Howell, drawn by Rossetti]]
Howell died in 1890 under strange circumstances. He was found close to a [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] [[public house]] with his throat slit, with a coin in his mouth – either a [[sovereign (coin)|sovereign]] or [[half-sovereign]].&lt;ref name ="bas"/&gt; The presence of the coin was believed to be a criticism of those guilty of slander.&lt;ref name ="bas"/&gt; Reports are inconsistent about whether or not he was found already dead or died in the hospital to which he was taken. The embarrassment of an inquest and police investigation was avoided when his death was ruled to have resulted from "[[tuberculosis|pneumonic phthisis]]", the slit throat having been inflicted perimortem or posthumously. Numerous, carefully filed, letters from high-placed people were found at his home, leading to much speculation.

==Reputation==
[[File:Rossetti-21.jpg|thumb|A caricature of Howell eavesdropping, while Rosa Corder forges Rossetti drawings (from [[Rossetti and his Circle]] by [[Max Beerbohm]]).]]
The circumstances of Howell's death and the many rumours about his dishonesty and double dealings led to the accusation that he had used letters in his possession to blackmail prominent persons. His associates in the art world were divided. Edward Burne-Jones described Howell as "a base, treacherous, unscrupulous and malignant fellow".&lt;ref name = "jib"&gt;Helen Rossetti Angeli, ''Dante Gabriel Rossetti: His Friends and Enemies'', p11&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hall Caine]] called him a "soldier of fortune" and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] said he was "the vilest wretch I ever came across".&lt;ref name = "jib"/&gt; Other artists were more generous. [[Ford Madox Brown]] said that though he was "one of the biggest liars in existence" and "half mad", he was essentially "good natured". Whistler said he was a "wonderful man... genius... splendidly flamboyant".&lt;ref name = "jib"/&gt;

20th century commentators on the Pre-Raphaelites claimed that in his later years Howell used letters to blackmail former friends. In the words of Humphrey Hare, "Fallen on hard days, Howell did not hesitate to blackmail by the threatened sale of letters which contained the customary puerile indecencies".&lt;ref name = "swin"/&gt; However, his biographer, Helen Rossetti Angeli, could find nothing to support the accusations of blackmail, which possibly arose from extrapolations of the incident involving George Redway.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Rossetti Angeli, ''Pre-Raphaelite twilight, the story of Charles Augustus Howell'', Richards Press, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Sherlock Holmes story "Charles Augustus Milverton", Howell was the basis of the character De Castro in [[Theodore Watts-Dunton]]'s novel ''Aylwin''.&lt;ref name = "swin"&gt;Humphrey Hare, ''Swinburne: A Biographical Approach'', H.F. &amp; G. Witherby. London. 1949. p.110.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hatnote|Not to be confused with a [[calorimeter]]''}}
{{Refimprove|date=May 2010}}
A '''colorimeter''' is a device used in [[Colorimetry (chemical method)|colorimetry]]. In scientific fields the word generally refers to the device that measures the [[absorbance]] of particular [[wavelength]]s of [[light]] by a specific [[solution]].&lt;ref&gt;Nuffield Advanced Chemistry (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; This device is commonly used to determine the [[concentration]] of a known [[solution|solute]] in a given solution by the application of the [[Beer-Lambert law]], which states that the concentration of a solute is proportional to the absorbance.

==Construction==
[[Image:Spectrophoto-controls.svg|thumb|300px|(1) Wavelength selection, (2) Printer button, (3) Concentration factor adjustment, (4) UV mode selector (Deuterium lamp), (5) Readout, (6) Sample compartment, (7) Zero control (100% T), (8) Sensitivity switch, (9)ON/OFF switch&lt;ref&gt;Colorimetry&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The essential parts of a colorimeter are:
* a '''light source''' (often an ordinary low-voltage filament lamp);
* an adjustable [[aperture]];
* a set of colored [[Filter (optics)|filters]];
* a [[cuvette]] to hold the working solution;
* a detector (usually a [[photoresistor]]) to measure the transmitted light;
* a meter to display the output from the detector.

In addition, there may be:
* a [[voltage regulator]], to protect the instrument from fluctuations in [[Mains power systems|mains voltage]];
* a second light path, cuvette and detector.  This enables comparison between the working solution and a "blank", consisting of pure solvent, to improve accuracy.

There are many commercialized colorimeters as well as [[open source]] versions with construction documentation for education and for research.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/3333921/Open-Source_Colorimeter] Anzalone GC, Glover AG, Pearce JM. Open-Source Colorimeter. ''Sensors'' (2013); 13(4):5338-5346&lt;/ref&gt;

Filters:-
Changeable [Filter (optics)|optics filters]are used in the colorimeter to select the wavelength which the solute absorbs the most, in order to maximize accuracy. The usual wavelength range is from 400 to 700 [nanometer] (nm). If it is necessary to operate in the [ultraviolet]range  then some modifications to the colorimeter are needed. In modern colorimeters the filament lamp and filters may be replaced by several (light-emitting diode)of different colors.The Measurement of Colour.

===Cuvettes===
{{Main|Cuvette}}
In a manual colorimeter the cuvettes are inserted and removed by hand. An automated colorimeter (as used in an [[AutoAnalyzer]]) is fitted with a '''flowcell''' through which solution flows continuously.

===Output===
The output from a colorimeter may be displayed by an analogue or digital meter and may be shown as [[transmittance]] (a [[linear]] scale from 0-100%) or as [[absorbance]] (a [[logarithmic scale]] from zero to infinity). The useful range of the absorbance scale is from 0-2 but it is desirable to keep within the range 0-1 because, above 1, the results become unreliable due to scattering of light.

In addition, the output may be sent to a [[chart recorder]], [[data logger]], or [[computer]].

[[File:Culture Factory Polymer.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Culture Factory Polymer|Culture Factory Polymer]]
'''Culture Factory Polymer''' ({{lang-et|Kultuuritehas Polymer}}) is a multidisciplinary centre for artistic creation and diffusion in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]]. Located in [[Lilleküla]], [[Kristiine|Kristiine District]], on the fringes of the [[Kesklinn, Tallinn|Tallinn city centre]], this former toy factory became in 2003 one of the main strong points for alternative un-institutionalized culture in Tallinn.

==History==
During the [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet era]], Polymer was a [[toy]] factory. In 1993, closed this branch of activities, leaving a large building in a state of abandonment. 

A few years after, a group of artists, intrigued by this big empty space, decided to turn a room into a rehearsal place. Step-by-step, other artists wished to enjoy different spaces to create, to rehearse. The new owner of the building gave its agreement for necessary rearrangements and renovations.

Nowadays, the factory disposes of {{convert|3000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} of space, dedicated to creation and diffusion. The building aesthetics of Polymer are typical Soviet industrial style. Concrete production facilities were transferred over time to incorporate new space for living, artistic use and events, with the old flair and keeping its authenticity. The conservation of the old factory's name, "Polymer", perpetuates the memory of this historic past.&lt;ref&gt;Polymer website&lt;/ref&gt;

==The different spaces==
Polymer, it is nowadays:
*studios for artists,
*rehearsals rooms for music bands,
*a center for art courses,
*two exhibition galleries,
*a Media Lab,
*two concert halls,
*two spaces which can be converted for several kinds of events,
*a bar,
*and two studios for guest artists.

A traditional letterpress print shop was also installed in the building; it's kept alive through realisation of posters for different organizations and animation of workshops for different publics.

==Activities &amp; events==
Gradually, Polymer became a place for residencies and diffusion with multiple spaces, where live together about 30 artists and organizations, working on diverse artistic fields. 
Constituted as a non profit organization, Polymer works as a platform, as a venue for different events and activities, offering thus a new space for alternative culture in Tallinn. Public events take place every week, involving [[artist in residency]] and guest artist also, from Tallinn, Estonia and Europe.

Every year in August, Polymer organizes its own festival, "Culture Factory Festival"; during 2 weeks, artists of the house open their studios and hang their art out to take some fresh air, and artists and a multitude of events from diverse universes take possession of the place: exhibition openings, concerts, film screenings, dance performances. Important is involving the audience in action through the workshops during the festival.

Polymer is an organization involved in local life and open to outwards contacts. Polymer leads different cultural and social actions at a local level, and develops its partnerships in Tallinn, in Estonia and in Europe.

Polymer was a member of the Trans Europe Halles network in years 2005-2013.&lt;ref&gt;Trans Europe Halles website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Keshav is a well-known astrologer and doctor who lives with his father, wife and daughter. Keshav's grandfather had obtained a yellow bicycle from an Englishman and had bequeathed it to his grandson prior to his death. Keshav is possessive of his cycle. One night two thieves steal his cycle to escape. Keshav is distressed and sets out in search of his cycle.

The thieves pose themselves as Keshav's cousins and tour around nearby villages. Wherever they go, they are honored by people for their relation with Keshav. Keshav's journey teaches him to not be so attached to worldly possessions. The guilt-ridden thieves decide to renounce their activities and return all stolen goods. They write a letter to Keshav, expressing their respect for him and also return the cycle. Keshav realises his folly and gifts the cycle to a boy. He returns home, realising the true meaning of joy.

The '''European Academy of Music Theatre''' ({{lang-de|Europäische Musiktheater-Akademie}}, abbreviated '''EMA''') is a [[Vienna]] based, non-profit institute which seeks to promote not only a pan-European but also international network for those active in the theory and praxis of [[Music theatre|Music Theatre]]. The organisation frequently holds symposia at various European cities and publishes their proceedings. The Academy cultivates and optimises the collaboration of professional activities throughout [[Europe]] and beyond.

== History ==
On 26 May 1992 the European Academy of Music Theatre  was founded in Prague's Ständetheater by the [[Forschungsinstitut für Musiktheater|Research Institute for Music Theatre Thurnau]] ([[Germany]]), [[Vanemuine]] Theatre, [[Tartu]] ([[Estonia]]), Academy of Sciences, [[Prague]] ([[Czech Republic]]) and the Department for Theatre, Film and Media Studies, [[University of Vienna]] ([[Austria]]).

During its period of gestation the Academy's main task was to provide support and knowledge to partners from Eastern Europe. After the completion of numerous projects and collaborations, the EMA increasingly positioned itself as a dialogue board for those professionally active in Music Theatre. This is achieved by establishing contacts between scientific researchers and those involved in music theatre affiliated domains. At its regular symposia EMA provides its members and associates a high-profile forum for exchanging experience and knowledge as well as for presenting latest developments in research, documentation and music theatre.

Since 1992 the European Academy of Music Theatre held fourteen symposia in different European countries, e.g. [[Russia]], [[Portugal]], [[France]] and [[Switzerland]]. Some of the analysed subjects have been organising and managing opera houses, historiography, as well as aspects of contemporary staging concepts.

At the 2011 general meeting [[:de:Dominique Meyer|Dominique Meyer]] and [[Kasper Holten]] have been appointed President and Vice President, respectively, and British musicologist [[John Deathridge]] has been elected new Member of the Board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://musiktheater-akademie.eu/new-board-elected-meyer-p-holten-vp-deathridge-schade-new-members/ "New Board elected: Meyer (P), Holten (VP); Deathridge, Schade new Members"], European Academy of Music Theatre, 7 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2013 general meeting in London the director of De Vlaamse Opera (Antwerp), Aviel Cahn, has been elected new Member of the Board.

At the 2015 general meeting, held in Vienna, English composer [[Thomas Adès]], Maltese Tenor [[Joseph Calleja]], and Italian musicologist Alessandro Di Profio have been elected into the Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://musiktheater-akademie.eu/17995/ "New board elected: Thomas Adès, Joseph Calleja and Alessandro Di Profio new members"] European Academy of Music Theatre, 10 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016 the Australian Conductor [[Simone Young]] was appointed Member of the Board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://musiktheater-akademie.eu/conductor-simone-young-new-member-of-the-board/ Simone Young new Member of the Board, 16 March 2016]; Retrieved 16 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FOCAL International''' is the [[trade association]] representing [[Stock footage#Libraries|stock footage]] companies, [[post-production]] facilities and individuals involved in the use of [[stock footage|footage]], [[stock photography|still images]] and [[stock sound effect|audio]] in all forms of media production. It represents more than 300 companies and individuals involved in media production, asset management, preservation of historical archives, [[film restoration]] and [[post-production]].

==History==
FOCAL International was founded in 1985 by an international group of [[stock footage|library]] archive leaders, specialising in film, television and news content who knew each other largely through licensing film and television archives who felt that archive owners could financially benefit from commercially exploiting parts of their archives for secondary use by professional film and television producers. 
The high cost of Archive management, preservation and storage and the introduction of new formats was also endangering many film based collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nitrate Won't Wait: A History of Film Preservation in the United States|first=Anthony|last=Slide|publisher=MacFarland &amp; Company Ltd|year=1992|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HZIq5-_hu5cC&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=jill+hawkins,+focal&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q=jill%20hawkins%2C%20focal&amp;f=false|isbn=0-7864-0836-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founders included Jill Hawkins from [[BBC Enterprises]] (now [[BBC Worldwide]]), Pam Turner of [[Visnews]], David Warner of [[ITN]], George Marshall of [[British Pathe]], Sten Frykholm from the Swedish broadcaster [[Svt|SVT]], Jacque Blanchard, from the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], and Patricia Gang of [[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]]. 
With the support of a close group of individuals from both BBC and Visnews including Alan Stoner, Jeremy Cantwell, David Wratten as well as researchers Kirsty MacCalman and Jane Mercer, FOCAL launched officially at MIPCOM in 1987.

Its first patron was [[David Puttnam|David (now Lord) Puttnam]], who became Chair of Patrons in 2005.

==Structure==
FOCAL International is run by a small administration team in the UK, reporting to an international Executive Council, comprising a Chair, and a number of representatives of member bodies.

FOCAL International seeks to implement its objectives through its [[committee]]s, which are made up of industry experts and representatives. These committees include: the Editorial Committee, responsible for the quarterly magazine "Archive Zones"; the Events &amp; Exhibitions Committee, responsible for organising the [[FOCAL International#FOCAL International Awards|FOCAL International Awards]], and FOCAL International’s presence at relevant trade and industry events; the Training Committee, responsible for providing and promoting training in the archive industry, and raising awareness of the need for preservation of archives; and the Funding &amp; Lobbying Committee, which lobbies governmental and institutional bodies on behalf of its members.

==FOCAL International Awards==
The FOCAL International Awards were established in 2004 to support and honour the researchers, technicians and producers who uncover, preserve and utilise archive footage in their work. The award ceremony is held annually in the spring in [[London]], UK.

The Awards cover categories for the best use of footage in factual productions, entertainment or drama, arts, music, sports, natural history and cinema, and also include categories for the best restoration or [[film preservation|preservation]] project, best [[Stock footage#Libraries|footage library]], best footage researcher of the year, and a Lifetime Achievement Award.

'''''Fight for Your Life''''' is a 1977 American [[grindhouse]] [[action film]] directed by Robert A. Endelson and starring [[William Sanderson]] and [[Robert Judd (actor)|Robert Judd]]. It was presented at the [[Quentin Tarantino Film Festival]] in the QT Six Lineup showing held in October 2005. The story revolves around three criminals (a White, Mexican, and Asian male) who hold a Black family hostage and forces them to fight for their lives.

== Synopsis ==
Sanderson plays Kane, a hate-fuelled racist [[Redneck (stereotype)|redneck]] who absconds from jail with his sidekicks (an [[Asia]]n and a [[Mexico|Mexican]]). They hole up in the secluded house of Ted Turner, a [[African American|black]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], and his family, where harsh epithets are exchanged and the minister is forced to take action to defend his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Rotten Tomatoes | id= fight-for-your-life }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cast ==
* [[William Sanderson]] – as Jessie Lee Kane
* [[Robert Judd (actor)|Robert Judd]] – as Ted Turner
* [[Catherine Peppers]] – as Mrs. Turner
* [[Lela Small]] – as Grandma Turner
* [[Yvonne Ross]] – as Corrie Turner
* [[Reggie Rock Bythewood]] – as Floyd Turner (as Reginald Bythewood)
* [[Ramon Saunders]] – as Val Turner
* [[Queenie Endelson]] – as Dog

* [[Richard A. Rubin]] – Captain Hamilton
* [[David Dewlow]] – Joey
* [[Pepe Hern]] – Navarro

== Critical reception ==
''Fight for Your Life'' has received a negative response from critics. ''[[TV Guide]]'' called it "a vile low-budget film that couldn't have found a receptive audience even during the height of tough [[blaxploitation]] pictures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.tvguide.com/fight-for-your-life/review/114666 |title=Fight For Your Life Review |publisher=[[TV Guide|TVGuide.com]] |accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AllRovi|Allmovie]] called it an "outrageous sleazefest" and "amazingly racist".&lt;ref&gt;{{AllMovie title | id= 17158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Censorship ==
''Fight For Your Life'' was denied a [[Great Britain|British]] theatrical release in 1981,&lt;ref&gt;{{BBFC title|AZF059828}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a video release the following year allowed the public brief access to the film before it wound up on the [[video nasty|video nasties]] list and was outlawed.  It is notable for being the only 'video nasty' to appear on the list due to language, specifically the racism displayed by Sanderson's character.

== Availability ==
Briefly available in the [[United Kingdom]] on the independent video label Vision On, released circa 1982, but outlawed with the advent of the [[Video Recordings Act 1984|Video Recordings Act (1984)]], ''Fight For Your Life'' was denied a British cinema release when it was rejected by the [[BBFC]] in October 1981. ''Fight For Your Life'' was issued in the U.S. by [[Blue Underground]] as a [[remastered]] [[DVD]].

The original film negative, having been stored by the film rights holder in a New Jersey basement, was destroyed by [[Hurricane Sandy]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diaboliquemagazine.com/spider-baby-given-academy-treatment-interview-william-lustig/|title=Spider Baby is Given The Academy Treatment (Interview with William Lustig)|work=[[Diabolique (magazine)|Diabolique]]|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''flag of Georgia''' ([[Georgian language|Georgian]]: საქართველოს სახელმწიფო დროშა; ''sakartvelos sakhelmtsʼipo drosha''), also known as the '''Five Cross Flag''' ([[Georgian language|Georgian]]: ხუთჯვრიანი დროშა; ''khutjvriani drosha''), is one of the [[national symbol]]s of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Originally a [[banner]] of the [[medieval]] [[Kingdom of Georgia]], it was brought back to popular use in the late [[20th century|20th]] and early [[21st century|21st centuries]] during periods of the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Georgian national revival]]. Prior to obtaining its official status in 2004, the flag was popularized by the [[United National Movement (Georgia)|United National Movement]] and served as one of the most recognizable symbols of the [[Rose Revolution]]. 

== History==
The current flag was used by the Georgian patriotic movement following the country's independence from the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991. By the late 1990s, the design had become widely known as the Georgian historical national flag as [[Vexillology|vexillologist]]s had pointed out the red-on-white [[Jerusalem cross]] shown as the flag of [[Tbilisi]] in a 14th-century map by [[Domenico and Francesco Pizzigano]].&lt;ref&gt;"The new flag of Georgia does not seem to be related with this historical banner. The flag of the National Movement was unknown ten years ago [1993] and was called 'the Georgian historical national flag' by the opposition leaders only after publications by the Georgian vexillologist I.L. Bichikashvili." Mikhail Revnivtsev, 25 November 2003 [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ge.html crwflags.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

A majority of Georgians, including the influential [[Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia|Catholicos-Patriarch]] of the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]], supported the restoration of the flag and in 1999 the [[Parliament of Georgia]] passed a bill to change the flag. However, it was not endorsed by the [[President of Georgia|President]], [[Eduard Shevardnadze]]. It was adopted in the early 2000s by the main opposition party, the [[United National Movement (Georgia)|United National Movement]] led by [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], as a symbol of popular resistance to Shevardnadze's rule.&lt;ref&gt;"A majority of Georgians, including the patriarch of the Georgian Orthodox Church, have long favored adopting the five-cross banner as the nation's official flag.  But the outgoing president stymied all efforts to make the change. In 1999, the Georgian Parliament voted to change the flag, and all Shevardnadze had to do was issue a supportive Decree. Inexplicably, he refused to do so, instead setting up a powerless Heraldic Commission to study the matter. When Saakashvili founded the National Movement in 2001, therefore, the five-cross flag was the natural choice to illustrate his party's populist bent."

The flag was adopted by Parliament on 14 January 2004.&lt;ref name='agenda' /&gt; Saakashvili formally endorsed it via Presidential Decree No. 31 signed on 25 January,&lt;ref&gt;[https://matsne.gov.ge/ka/document/view/34906 Presidential Decree 31]{{link language|ka}}&lt;/ref&gt; following his election as President. 14 January is annually marked as a [[Flag Day]] in Georgia.&lt;ref name='agenda'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agenda.ge/news/73182/eng|title=Georgia celebrates National Flag Day today|publisher=Agenda.ge|date=14 Jan 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
The national flag of Georgia, as described in the decree:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Georgian national flag is a white rectangle, with in its central portion a large red cross touching all four sides of the flag. In the four corners there are four ''[[Bolnisi cross|bolnur-katskhuri]]'' crosses (Also refer as Georgian Crosses aside with [[Grapevine cross]]) of the same colour (as the large cross).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Early Georgian States===
The first Georgian flag design came about during the era of the early Georgian state, the [[Principality of Iberia]] which had a red cross against a white background, similar to the [[flag of England]]).
The subsequent [[Principality of Tao-Klarjeti]], shared this same flag. The flag of the [[Kingdom of Abkhazia]] had 4 green strips in a dextral position on the right side, while the left side contained the cross seen on the current Georgian flag.

===Collapse of Kingdom of Georgia===
After the collapse of the Kingdom of Georgia, its successor states adopted their own flags, with most of them using animals as their representative symbols.

===Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti (1762–1801)===
The kingdom was formed through the unification of Kartli and Kakheti. The flag had a white cross against a black background. The country lost its independence in 1801 to annexation by the [[Russian Empire]].

===Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic (1918)===
While not technically a Georgian flag, this flag is of importance as Georgia was one of the founding countries of the federation. The [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic]]'s flag was a [[tricolour (flag)|tricolour]] design, with a top band of dark yellow, a middle band of black, and a bottom band of red.

===Democratic Republic of Georgia (1918–1921)===
During Georgia's brief existence as an independent state as the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] from 1918 to 1921, a [[tricolour (flag)|tricolour]] was adopted. The design resulted from a national flag-designing contest won by the painter [[Iakob Nikoladze]]. It was abolished by the [[Soviet Union]] following the 1921 incorporation of Georgia into the USSR.

=== Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (1921–1991) ===
{{Main|Flag of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic}}
During the Soviet period, Georgia adopted several variants of the [[flag of the Soviet Union|red Soviet flag]] incorporating either the [[Georgian SSR|Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic's]] name, or a red [[hammer and sickle]] with a [[red star|star]] in a blue sun in the [[flag terminology|canton]] and a blue bar in the upper part of flag. The flag of the [[Flag of Georgian SSR|Georgian SSR]] was abolished by the Georgian government in November 1990 shortly before it declared independence from the Soviet Union.

===Georgia (1991–2004)===
The previous flag used by the Democratic Republic of Georgia from 1918 to 1921 was revived on 8 December 1991, by the [[Supreme Council of the Republic of Georgia]]. However, it lost popularity thereafter as it became associated with the chaotic and violent period around the collapse of the Soviet Union. The wine-red colour symbolises the good times in the past and the future, while the black represents Russian rule, and the white represents hope for peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Luck, ed.|year=1997|title=Oxford Family Encyclopedia (first ed.).

'''''Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream''''' is a 1990 non-fiction book written by [[H. G. Bissinger]]. The book follows the story of the 1988 [[Permian High School]] Panthers [[High school football|football]] team from [[Odessa, Texas]], as they made a run towards the Texas state championship. While originally intended to be a ''[[Hoosiers (film)|Hoosiers]]''-type chronicle of high school sports that holds together a small town, the final book ended up being critical about life in the town of Odessa. It was later adapted for television and film.

==Inspiration==
Bissinger was a journalist for ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' when he was selected as a Harvard [[Neiman Fellowship|Neiman Fellow]].  It was while he was at Harvard that the idea to write a book focused upon the role high school football plays within American society, in particular rural society, took hold. Bissinger returned to ''The Inquirer'' briefly, received a [[Pulitzer Prize]], and then took off in search of a community for which high school football was paramount. He settled on Odessa, Texas.  Permian High School and its football team, the Permian Panthers, had a substantial, rich history of winning in Texas' 4A and 5A division, having won championships in 1965, 1972, 1980, and 1984. Bissinger moved his family to Odessa and spent the entire 1988 football season with the Permian Panther players, their families, their coaches, and even many of the townspeople in an effort to understand the town and its football-mad culture.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Characters==
*'''[[Boobie Miles|James "Boobie" Miles]]''' –  Star fullback for Permian heading into the 1988 season. The previous season he had rushed for 1,385 yards and showed flashes of brilliance. This season would be the season for him to shine and lead the team to a Texas state championship. Boobie was being heavily recruited by major college football programs such as [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]], [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]], [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]], [[Texas A&amp;M Aggies football|Texas A&amp;M]] and [[USC Trojans football|USC]] and had professional football aspirations before suffering a knee injury in the preseason. He would never recover 100% and eventually quit the team in a rage.
*'''Mike Winchell''', the starting [[quarterback]] for the Panthers. He is portrayed by Bissinger as a boy who is mostly level-headed, but prone to nerves. His play is unspectacular but effective. He feels a lot of pressure from the town and peers alike.
*'''Brian Chavez''' – A very intelligent player. He is [[valedictorian]] of his class and attends [[Harvard University]] after graduating from Permian. He is a [[tight end]] and [[defensive lineman]]. He is mostly seen as an example of the good in Odessa, a diamond among rocks.
*'''Ivory Christian''', a [[Linebacker]] for the Panthers. A punishing hitter with excellent reflexes and athleticism, Christian is a religious person. He struggles to enjoy playing football, realizing that there should be more to life and spends much of his time in thought. He is the only senior player from the 1988 Panther football team to receive a [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] [[Athletic scholarship|football scholarship]], attending [[TCU Horned Frogs football|Texas Christian University]].
*'''Don Billingsley''', a Permian [[Fullback (American football)|halfback]] who frequently finds himself in trouble with the coaches. His father is a local legend for being a star player for Permian in the late 1960s, though Don is known more for his off the field activities, which at the time included drinking, fighting, and womanizing.
*'''Jerrod McDougal''', a Permian [[offensive tackle]], who has sacrificed a lot to become varsity for Permian and, at 5'9", knows he is too small to play at the college level, so practices several times a day to bring himself to an advantage.
*'''[[Gary Gaines]]''', the [[head coach]] for Permian. A bright football mind who constantly deals with the pressures from the fans, the booster club, and the lofty expectations of being head coach for Permian.

==Summary==
In the 5A playoff semifinals, Permian meets [[David W. Carter High School|Dallas Carter Cowboys]], a predominantly black team. In a hard fought game in the rain at [[Darrell K Royal–Texas Memorial Stadium|Memorial Stadium]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], the Panthers are defeated 14–9. Dallas Carter, led by future [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami Hurricanes]] and [[New York Giants]] linebacker [[Jessie Armstead]], goes on to win the state championship, but faced severe penalties for their grade tampering, giving the state championship to [[Judson High School]] almost three years later.

The book ends with Coach erasing names of the  seniors from his board and replacing them with names of the juniors who will replace them next season. Permian goes undefeated the next year, with future NFL player [[Stoney Case]] as quarterback, and becomes the 1989 Texas state football champions.

==Chapters==
{{Plot|date=September 2011}}

'''Prologue'''

Bissinger discusses the [[Robert E. Lee High School (Midland, Texas)|Midland Lee]] game, as Permian's arch rival. The game is played on October 28, 1988. He introduces the characters of Gary Gaines, Mike Winchell, Don Billingsley, Boobie Miles, Ivory Christian, Brian Chavez and Jerrod McDougal and gives insight into their personalities, thoughts and their pregame rituals. Former star, Boobie knows his performance against Midland Lee will be important for his future. He hasn't played well since August when he injured his knee in a preseason scrimmage, but the coaches never put Boobie in the game. Permian puts up a valiant fight but lose 22–21. After the game, a furious Boobie storms out of the locker room and quits the team two days later.

'''Chapter 1: Odessa'''

Bissinger begins the book at the start of the 1988 football season in August and how Gaines is preparing for it. Bissinger then chronicles the history of Odessa. It was founded in the 1880s by land speculators from [[Zanesville, Ohio]]. They advertised the land as being as fertile farmland like in [[Kansas]] and [[Iowa]]. However, the settlers quickly discovered that it was dry and arid. The town saw little growth until 1926 when oil was discovered in the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] (hence the high school's name). Almost overnight, the town boomed and it saw more growth in a month than it had seen in ten years. The population increased dramatically and money was everywhere. In town, the roads were so muddy that the oil workers, (nicknamed boomers), often had to bring in cattle to pull the equipment to the oil fields. According to the book, "diarrhea, lawlessness, overcrowding, bad water, prostitution, and a rat problem" plagued the town. Out in the oil fields, the boomers worked round the clock to make their money. Meanwhile, [[Odessa High School]]'s football team garnered success by winning the state championship in 1946 and making it back to the championship in 1953, thus laying the foundation for football fanaticism.  Another boom in the 1950s led to the opening of [[Permian High School]] in 1959. Permian proved quickly that it was not going to play second to Odessa High. They became known as the embodiment of Odessa: small, white and overachieving. Meanwhile, due to demographic shifts and oddly drawn boundaries, Odessa High became populated with mainly poor whites and poor Hispanics—while a substantial majority of the city's relatively small black population ended up in the Permian attendance zone. This is not to say, however, that Permian didn't have its share of poor people from all major ethnic groups.

'''Chapter 2: The Watermelon Feed'''

Bissinger talks about the Watermelon Feed held at Permian in August as a preseason celebration. He then chronicles the history of Permian football. Since its founding in 1959, it had won the state championship in 1965, 1972, 1980 and 1984. Despite the fact that it only won one state championship in the 1970s, Permian had statistically been the winningest team in the state of Texas. Bissinger then discusses the pressure that Gaines is constantly under because of how  intensely devoted the Permian fans are. High school football is used as a distraction for the once thriving community of Odessa which had gone into a slump when the second boom ended.

'''Chapter 3: Boobie'''

This chapter focuses upon the black star fullback, James "Boobie" Miles, who is Permian's ticket to the state championship. Bissinger uses Boobie as an example of the negative effect high school football can have its players. Boobie is not a good student and doesn't have to worry about grades because he will most likely get a football scholarship to a major college. The dream seems all too real until, in August, during a scrimmage in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], Boobie injured his knee. With the season opener only a week away, no one knows what to do. Now the pressure is on quarterback Mike Winchell. Meanwhile, junior running back Chris Comer is called up to replace Boobie.

'''Chapter 4: Dreaming of Heroes'''

This chapter focuses upon the life of Mike Winchell, Permian's starting quarterback. Mike lived with his mother.  His father, Billy, died when Mike was just thirteen. Billy had always been keen on Mike's playing football when he was a little kid. Mike's older brother, Joe Bill, took over that role but, in 1988, Joe Bill had moved out. Mike was very intelligent and received an offer of admission from Brown University but  had prospects of playing football only at a smaller college. Don Billingsley is Permian's starting Tailback and son of the legendary Charlie Billingsley who played football in the 1960s. Don, whose mother had been a Permian cheerleader while Charlie played football, moved from [[Blanchard, Oklahoma]] to Odessa in 1986 before his sophomore year. Don and Charlie had always had a rocky relationship but it was all made better by football. Don was always inspired by his father's stories and always tried to live up to him. Yet, sometimes he faltered because he sometimes fumbled the ball on key plays.

'''Chapter 5: Black and White'''

Bissinger discusses the issue of race relations in Odessa which he describes as the ugliest racism he had ever witnessed. The town didn't desegregate until the 1980s and even then the schools were racially divided. Many viewed football as exploiting the talented black athletes by using them and then spitting them out afterwards.

'''Chapter 6: The Ambivalence of Ivory'''

Bissinger begins by discussing the life of Permian linebacker Ivory Christian. He originally thought he would go to Ector High School, where many poor blacks went, until Permian was desegregated in the early 1980s. Ivory had ambitions of becoming a minister at a Baptist church. Ivory gains these ambitions when he has a life changing dream that involves a dark tunnel and light. Because of this dream, Ivory decides that he will change his partying ways and turn his life over to God. Because of this decision, he becomes ambivalent towards football, what it represents, and for its beginning the inner battle between Homeric and Christian values.

'''Chapter 7: School Days'''

Bissinger spends the chapter discussing the situation at Permian High School. He highlights the misplaced priorities as well as bad spending. More money is spent on sports medical supplies than the entire English department. The teachers make less money than the coaches who are financially at the mercy of the boosters who seldom care about education. Permian's SAT scores have plummeted dramatically since the 1970s and no one seems to care as long as Permian wins football games. As a result, everyone including the football players suffers. As the season progresses, Permian begins winning games.

'''Chapter 8: East versus West'''

Bissnger discusses the Permian–Odessa High game. The cross town rivalry is fueled by the cultural difference between the schools. For one thing, Permian also got the majority of the [[Ector County Independent School District|Ector County]]&lt;!--The relevant link here is the district, not the county.--&gt; education budget while Odessa High typically got what was left (which wasn't that much). Odessa High had once been the beacon of hope in the city. It won the 1946 state championship and did well overall. Then, Permian opened in 1959. The middle class whites went to Permian and the [[Mexican American|Mexicans]] went to Odessa High. Also, Permian hasn't lost to Odessa in over twenty years. Permian wins the game 35–7.

'''Chapter 9: Friday Night Politics'''

Bissinger discusses the political views in Odessa which has long been a Republican voting city. The 1988 election is coming up and it is clear that majority of its residents are going to vote for Republican candidate and then Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]], who lived in the area in the 1940s and 1950s. They had loved [[Ronald Reagan]] so the choice was clear. Many view Democratic candidate [[Michael Dukakis]] as far too liberal and think he is out to destroy their way of life from his comfortable home in Massachusetts. Meanwhile, Permian rolls over [[Midland High School (Midland, Texas)|Midland High School]] winning 35–0. Bissinger also discusses the life of Brian Chavez, the Permian tight end. Chavez is extremely smart and has ambitions of going to Harvard. His father Tony is a successful lawyer originally from [[El Paso, Texas]]. Tony had enlisted in the [[United States Army]] after high school. After he was discharged, he took his [[GI Bill]] money and decided to take law classes at [[Texas Tech University|Texas Tech]] in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]] eventually graduating with a law degree in 1978. He supported the family by working as a police officer in El Paso. On his trips between the two cities, he drove through Odessa and thought it was dirty, seedy and trashy, and so decided to work in Midland. However, once he graduated, he got a job offer in Odessa and moved his family there. In 1982, the family moved to the Country Club estates, the nicest part of town. Tony was, in many ways, the embodiment of the American dream.

'''Chapter 10: Boobie Who?'''

Bissinger discusses Boobie's football career after his injury. He thought the injury wasn't that serious and constantly tried to convince the coaches he could play. He played as a back up in several games but never got any serious playing time. But as Boobie's career is falling Mike Winchell's is soaring.

'''Chapter 11: Sisters'''

Bissinger discusses the Permian-[[Robert E. Lee High School (Midland, Texas)|Midland Lee]] rivalry. Even though the two towns were very similar, the hatred ran deep. Odessans viewed Midland as a town full of rich snobs and Midlanders view Odessa as a city full of rednecks, money burners and drunks. In 1983 an article in [[Forbes|''Forbes'' magazine]] named Midland one of the nicest places to live in America. At the same time, ''[[Newsweek]]'' named Odessa "Murder Capital U.S.A." with a record 29.8 murders per 100,000 residents. Bissinger traces the roots of the hatred to the second oil boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The boom had been brought by the oil embargo by [[OPEC]] as well as the [[Iranian Revolution]], the [[1973 Oil Crisis]], the [[1979 Energy Crisis]] and the Carter Energy Policy. Oil prices skyrocketed and for the second time in forty years the boom was on. People were making money left and right in both Midland and Odessa. There were stories of welders who could barely read making as much as $90,000 a year. Stories abounded of business men buying [[Lear jets]] and building huge homes for no other reason than the fact that they could. The oil executives thought they were in control of everything and didn't realize it was all circumstantial. Once the embargo ended, the boom was over. The final nail in the coffin was the closing of the [[First National Bank of Midland]] in October 1983 as a result of the [[1980s oil glut]] and the Permian Basin never fully recovered. Bissinger also discusses the effects that the Reagan 1980s had on the Odessa-Midland Area.

'''Chapter 12: Civil War'''

After Permian loses to Midland Lee the fate of the season is unclear. Gaines is now under tremendous pressure and wonders if he will still have a job in a year's time. In two seasons Gaines had only gotten as far as the third round of playoffs. Boobie Miles quietly quits the team. Meanwhile, Jerrod McDougal, the Permian defensive tackle who knew he wouldn't play football in college, was devastated at the prospect of the season ending so early. Permian, Midland High and Midland Lee are all tied with one district loss each and only two can go to represent the district in the 1988 playoffs. It will be decided in a coin toss.

'''{{visible anchor|Chapter 13}}: Heads or Tails'''

Permian ends the regular season beating the San Angelo Bobcats 41–7. But now it all comes down to a coin toss. Coach Gaines and Mike Belew drive to meet the head coaches of Midland High and Midland Lee. The event is held at a truck stop on the south side of Midland at 2:00 am [[Central Time Zone (North America)|local time]]. The location is undisclosed and it is broadcast live on TV. When the coin toss finally happens there it is originally thought to be a tie. Then it turns out that Permian and Midland Lee landed heads and Midland High landed tails. The two teams will continue their seasons while Midland High's season is over.

'''Chapter 14: Friday Night addiction'''

The playoffs have finally arrived. Permian first defeats [[Tascosa High School]] in Amarillo 21–7. They then play [[Andress High School]] in El Paso in the [[Sun Bowl Stadium|Sun Bowl]], winning 41–13. The Saturday after Thanksgiving, Permian beats the [[Nimitz High School (Irving, Texas)|Irving Nimitz]] Vikings, a team ranked sixth in the state, 41–7. Bissinger also explores the fates of many famous Permian players and how many of them ended right back in Odessa. He cites these stories as key examples of the false world Permian football can have on its players. Permian then beats [[Lamar High School (Arlington, Texas)|Arlington Lamar]] 21–7. But now it was on to play the team many called the best high school football team in the state if not the country—the [[David W. Carter High School]] Cowboys from Dallas.

'''Chapter 15: The Algebraic Equation'''

Bissinger spends the chapter discussing the football players at Dallas Carter High School, which is an all black upper middle class high school. The football obsession at Dallas Carter dwarfs the one at Permian. Players skipped classes, left school to get lunch, and had their grades fixed by teachers so that they could play. This led to a court case when a teacher, Will Bates, refused to lie about the algebra grade of a key player, Gary Edwards. The case was won and Dallas Carter got to continue their season. During the week of the game the coaches from Permian and Dallas Carter meet to decide where the game will be played. They eventually agree on [[Darrell K Royal – Texas Memorial Stadium|Texas Memorial Stadium]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. They also agree on a racially mixed officiating crew to minimize any possible bias from that source.

'''Chapter 16: Field of Dreams'''

Permian plays Dallas Carter on December 17, 1988. The game is extremely close with Permian initially ahead. Don Billingsley makes some great blocks. Ivory Christian makes an interception. Jerrod McDougal blocks exceptionally well, and Chris Comer moves the ball exceptionally well. But then a bad call in which the football bounced off the artificial turf of the field into a Carter receiver's hand. Carter then scores. Permian is now down 14–9. As the game draws to an end in the fourth quarter Permian gains the ball and starts gaining yards fast until finally the final seconds of the game are at hand with Permian on the Carter 24-yard line. Winchell gets ready to pass to Robert Brown. The ball is snapped, Winchell looks to Brown and throws the ball. It is incomplete. Permian loses 14–9. For the players, high school football is over and a big part of their lives has just ended. Right after the game the team heads home. McDougal, who loved football to death, lingered in the team locker room for a little longer than everyone else but eventually left to the locker room. Then Gaines and the coaches took down the magnetic names on the board. Bissinger ends the chapter saying, "The season had ended, but another one had begun. People everywhere, young and old were already dreaming of heroes."

'''Epilogue'''

A week later, Dallas Carter won the 1988 Texas state championship. For the players, the sense of entitlement and the feeling that they could do whatever they wanted to reach an all-time high. Gary Edwards got a full scholarship to the University of Houston. However, in May 1989, Edwards and several other players committed an armed robbery in Dallas. They were arrested and they were tried in September. It was then discovered they had committed as many as ten robberies prior. Edwards, who initially thought he would just get probation, was sentenced to 16 years in prison. After some review it was decided that because of grade changing on the player's{{Who|date=July 2010}} action, Dallas Carter was stripped of their state championship.

Bissinger then discusses the fates of the 1988 Permian Panthers. Brian Chavez went to Harvard but quit the football team after only one day because there was no bond. He instead decided to play [[Rugby union|rugby]]. Boobie Miles played football at Ranger College, a junior college. Jerrod McDougal attended [[Odessa College]] and then Midland College. Although he missed football he could find happiness in the knowledge that Permian football would go on forever. Don Billingsley went back to Oklahoma and at first played football for [[East Central University]] but then he severely injured his knee and needed surgery. Ivory Christian went to play for [[TCU Horned Frogs football|Texas Christian University]] but quit playing football after his freshman year. Mike Winchell played football for [[Baylor Bears football|Baylor University]] but said it wasn't as great as Permian and lost a lot of his abilities.

1989 saw the price of oil rise as high as $20 a barrel. Yet that same year saw 46% of the nation's oil imported, the highest in twelve years. As a result, West Texas continued to suffer economically.  That year Odessa was named the second-worst place to live in America by the ''Places Rated Almanac''. Meanwhile, Permian was dominating on the football field. They redeemed themselves, beating Midland Lee 17–13. Permian continued to win in the playoffs and eventually got to the state championship. Among the players was quarterback [[Stoney Case]] who would eventually go on to play in the NFL for the Arizona Cardinals and Baltimore Ravens. Before the game Gary Gaines told the players, "Everybody in this room has paid a dear, dear price. That ought to make your effort that much more intense, that much more fanatical, because of all the hard work and sacrifice that's gone into getting you here. It ought to make you play that much harder. You represent a lot of people. We're gonna represent them well and we're gonna win this sucker!"  The players then took the field. Odessa had gone through a ridiculous amount of change in the 1980s going from a place where anything was possible to a place where nothing was certain and everything was finite.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Yet football had always been there. Bissinger ends the book by saying, "It would always go on just as Jerrod McDougal had realized, because it was a way of life. The Permian Panthers ended the decade the same way they had begun it. Two days before Christmas, they became the state football champions of Texas."

==Investigation==
While Bissinger, who had taken a leave of absence from reporting for ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' to follow the team and write ''Friday Night Lights'', was writing the book, the [[University Interscholastic League]] (UIL) investigated the Permian Panthers football program, alleging that Bissinger took players out to eat and paid for the meals while interviewing them for the book, a violation of amateur rules. He also paid for Boobie Miles' car for an interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UIL Probing Journalist's Links with Permian|work= [[Dallas Morning News]]|date= November 19, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2011}}
The book's release during the 1990 season coincided with the investigation of the team for holding illegal off-season practices, which resulted in the team's being declared ineligible for the playoffs and thus not participating in the [[post season]] for only the second time since 1980. Permian's absence from the playoffs allowed [[San Angelo Central]] into the playoffs for only the 3rd time since 1966. The negative reaction to the playoff situation was exacerbated by the book, and many residents of Odessa received the book with responses ranging from mild indignation to threats of physical violence aimed at the book's author.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

In response to the negative reaction in Odessa, a bookstore cancelled a booksigning by the author, and T-shirts possessed by the population bore the words, "Buzz off, Bissinger".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&amp;s_site=miami&amp;p_multi=MH&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=101AA4E7965D1322&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |work=[[The Miami Herald]]|date= March 29, 2004|title= 2D Sports: FRIDAY NIGHT FRIGHTS| accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, over time, the accuracy of the story has held up. The book has been reprinted frequently, including a 2000 reprint with a new [[afterword]] by the author detailing the team's accomplishments in the early part of the 1990s followed by the demise of the program in the latter part of the decade.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

In 2002, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' named ''Friday Night Lights'' the fourth-greatest book ever written about sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = McEntegart| first = Pete,  L. Jon Wertheim, Gene Menez, &amp; Mark Bechtel| url=https://www.si.com/vault/2002/12/16/334173/the-top-100-sports-books-of-all-time |title= The Top 100 Sports Books of All Time |date = December 16, 2002|publisher=Sports Illustrated/Time, Inc. |accessdate=2017-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The book inspired the short-lived television series ''[[Against the Grain (TV series)|Against the Grain]]'' (1993), starring a young [[Ben Affleck]].

A movie version of [[Friday Night Lights (film)|''Friday Night Lights'']] was made and then released in the United States on October 6, 2004. It starred [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Permian Coach [[Gary Gaines]]. The film was a box office and critical success and, in turn, spawned the [[NBC]] [[Friday Night Lights (TV series)|television series of the same name]], which ran five seasons from 2006–2011.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

'''Gertie the Duck''' is an icon of [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]] history and the subject of a  4-foot tall bronze sculpture by American artist [[Gwendolyn Gillen]].&lt;ref name=mpr&gt;{{cite news|first=Bob |last=Collins |title=Gwen Gillen was much more than the Mary Tyler Moore statue |url=http://blogs.mprnews.org/newscut/2017/02/gwen-gillen-was-much-more-than-the-mary-tyler-moore-statue/ |work=[[Minnesota Public Radio]] |publisher= |date=2017-02-01 |accessdate=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was installed on the Wisconsin Avenue bridge in September 1997.

The story of her heroic efforts to hatch six ducklings became an inspiration for many war-weary Americans near the end of [[World War II]]. Gertie's story unfolded as a daily serial in the local newspaper for 37 days, captivating the residents of Milwaukee, the state and eventually the country.&lt;ref name=Sandin &gt;Sandin, Jo. "Home Sweet Home". ''The Milwaukee Journal'', March 31, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Gertie's story began in April 1945 when ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|Milwaukee Journal]]'' outdoor writer [[Gordon MacQuarrie]] reported that a mallard duck was nesting on a wood piling under the Wisconsin Avenue  bridge.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, Fran. "Gertie co-author remembers famous fowl". ''Milwaukee Journal Sentinel'', December 1, 1997, p. B3.&lt;/ref&gt; A total of nine eggs were laid and the duck kept vigil atop her nest despite throngs of visitors and motorists stopping on the bridge daily to check the progress of the expectant mother.   Mother's Day cards began arriving for the mallard, the Boy Scouts formed a Gertie Patrol and a Wisconsin Humane Society officer was stationed to watch the brood as six of the nine eggs eventually produced chicks.&lt;ref name=Gould &gt;Gould, Whitney. "Mallard memorialized Gertie, City's Famed duck gets statue in her honor". ''Milwaukee Journal Sentinel'', September 25, 1997 Final, p. B1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public interest continued to swell as wire services picked up MacQuarrie's stories.  Gertie and her nest were photographed by the ''Journal'' and local rival ''[[Milwaukee Sentinel]]'', featured in ''[[Life Magazine]]'' and even had a front-page story in the United Kingdom's ''[[Daily Express]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Mallard's Fame Spans Sea for Story in London". ''The Milwaukee Journal'', June 14, 1945, p. A1.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Readers Digest]]'' ran a story on Gertie entitled "The Duck That Made Milwaukee Famous".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Don L. "'Millie' Finds City Life Just Ducky". ''Milwaukee Sentinel'', May 28, 1980 Final, p. A1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite flooding, storms and fire on some nearby pilings, five ducklings and Gertie survived the ordeal and were put on public display in the nearby [[Gimbels]] department store windows, where more than 2 million visitors peered in to see the famous feathered family. The ducks were later relocated to the Juneau Park lagoon on Milwaukee's lakefront.&lt;ref name=Sandin /&gt;

==Popular culture==
[[File:Jan Shepard GE True Gertie the Great 1963.JPG|right|thumb|150px|A promotional still for "Gertie the Great"]]The first book based on Gertie's story was "The Story of 'Gertie'", published by the ''Journal'' in July 1945 and based on its daily coverage.  The book sold out three printings&lt;ref&gt;"'Gertie' Books Sold Out". ''The Milwaukee Journal'', July 15, 1945, p. A1.&lt;/ref&gt; before being re-printed by New York's Rinehart &amp; Co. in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;"Notes on Books and Authors". ''The Milwaukee Journal'', May 12, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, Anne T. "For Younger Readers". ''The New York Times'', March 10, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, Milwaukee toymaker Earl F. Wendt produced a wooden toy duck named for the famous mallard.&lt;ref&gt;"Gertie Reappears as Toy Made by Firm Here". ''The Milwaukee Journal'', September 5, 1946, p. A10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, Nicholas P. Georgiady and Louis G. Romano, two Milwaukee-area teachers, wrote a children's book titled "Gertie the Duck".&lt;ref&gt;Uebelherr, Jan. "Immortalizing Gertie the Duck". ''Milwaukee Journal Sentinel'', March 1, 2001 Final, p. A2.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was reissued in 1988 after selling more than 800,000 copies and translated into six languages.&lt;ref name=Sandin /&gt;

Gertie's story was also told in an episode of ''[[GE True]]'' in 1963 entitled "Gertie the Great", featuring Jan Shepard as a reporter assigned to cover the hatching eggs.

==Sculpture==
''Gertie the Duck'' is a 4-foot bronze sculpture of the mallard duck created by sculptor [[Gwendolyn Gillen]]. The original cost of the sculpture was $15,000, and it was given to the city by the Eppstein Uhen Architects firm and installed in September 1997. It stands on the northwest side of the Wisconsin Avenue bridge over the [[Milwaukee River]] in downtown Milwaukee.&lt;ref name=Roadside&gt;"Milwaukee, WI - Gertie the Duck, Symbol of Hope."

The '''Ihlara Valley''' (or '''Peristrema Valley'''; [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''Ihlara Vadisi'') is a canyon which is 15 km long and up to 150 m deep in the southwest of the [[Turkey|Turkish]] region of [[Cappadocia]], in the municipality of [[Güzelyurt]], [[Aksaray Province]]. The valley contains around 50 [[Monolithic church|rock-hewn churches]] and numerous [[Rock-cut architecture of Cappadocia|rock-cut buildings]].

== Development and location ==
[[File:IhlaraTalvonTreppe.jpg|thumb|View from the entry stairs]]
[[File:Map of Cappadocia.jpg|thumb|The Ihlara Valley and other noteworthy sites in Cappadocia]]
The canyon was formed in prehistoric times by the {{ill|Melendiz Çayı|de}}. It lies between the villages of [[Ihlara]] in the southeast and [[Selime]] in the northwest. At the north end of the village of Ihlara, there is a stairway with almost 400 steps, which descends over 100 m down into the canyon. From the 7th century AD, the valley was settled by Byzantine monks who dug their houses and churches out of the [[tuff]] stone, which had been deposited by the eruptions of [[Mount Hasan]]. The earlier [[Greek language|Greek name]], ''Peristrema'' (Περιστρημα; winding round) of the village of Belisarma which is located about halfway along the valley from Ihlara to Selime, gave its name to the valley as well.

== Churches ==
[[File:SümbüllüKilise.JPG|thumb|Facade of the Sümbüllü Kilise]]
The churches in the valley fall into two groups. The first consists of the churches near the village of Ihlara, which are decorated with paintings of a local Cappadocian type that show influence from Persia and Syria to the east. They mostly pre-date the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|Iconoclasm]], but were often repainted in newer styles over time. The second group is located near the village of Belisarma and consists of churches in the Byzantine style of the tenth and eleventh centuries, known as [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)|Macedonian art]]. 

The first group includes:
* Ağaçaltı Kilisesi ('Church under the Tree'): a [[cross-in-square]] church cut out of the cliff,  perhaps dating to the 7th century AD. The depiction of the [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]] in its cupola pre-dates the Iconoclasm. 
* Yılanlı Kilise ('Snake Church'): another cross-in-square church with an unusually long [[apse]]. In the [[narthex]] there are scenes of Hell dating to the 9th century AD, and below them are four naked sinners in the grip of snake-like monsters - from which the church takes its modern name.
* Sümbüllü Kilise ('Hyacinth church'): possibly from the 10th century AD. The church has a T-shaped ground plan and belongs to the transition to the Macedonian style. The wall paintings include depictions of [[Constantine VII]] with his wife [[Helena Lekapene|Helena]]. On the other hand, the external facade shows eastern influences.

[[File:IhlaraTal.jpg|thumb|Church facade]]

The second group includes:
* Direkli Kilise ('Pillar church'). The cruciform [[nave]] church was created in the 10th century AD. The cupola is supported by four tall columns, which are decorated with portraits of saints. One of the few inscriptions in the valley reports the dedication of the church by the Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]] (r. 976-1025).
* Karagedik Kilisesi ('Church with the Black Gap'): a cross-in-square church with four pillars, which was built from bricks and [[trachyte]] blocks in the 11th century and has been almost entirely destroyed aside from some faded remains of paintings.
* Kırkdamaltı Kilisesi ('Church with forty roofs', also called 'St George's Church'). An inscription allows the church to be dated between 1283 and 1295, which makes it the last known example of Christian architecture in the Ihlara valley until the revival of church building by the [[Cappadocian Greeks]] in the 19th century. The church's paintings include depictions of [[St George]], a painting of the Byzantine consul Basileos Giagupes, who was also an [[Emir]] and is shown in [[Seljuk]] clothing with his wife Thamar, a [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n princess. The aforementioned inscription mentions both the Seljuk Sultan [[Mesud II]] and the Byzantine emperor [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]], a sign that at this date some kind of peaceful co-existence between Christians and Muslims was possible in Cappadocia. 

In the [[Niğde Archaeological Museum]], there is a display of the mummies of a woman and four children who were entombed in the Ihlara Valley in the 10th century AD. The [[Aksaray Museum]] also has mummies from the Ihlara valley.

It is a subsidiary of [[Ingram Industries]].&lt;ref name="urlIngram Industries - Company Description - Hoovers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hoovers.com/ingram-industries/--ID__40233--/free-co-factsheet.xhtml |title=Ingram Industries - Company Description - Hoover's |work= |accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's daily activities are handled by Shawn Morin who serves as CEO.  [[John R. Ingram (businessman)|John R. Ingram]] serves as chairman of Ingram Content Group. He also serves as the Vice Chairman of [[Ingram Industries]].

The Ingram Content Group was formed in 2009 as Ingram Lightning Group merged with Ingram Digital Group. Ingram Content Group’s operating units are Ingram Book Company, Ingram International Inc., Ingram Library Services Inc., Ingram Publisher Services Inc., Ingram Periodicals Inc., Ingram Digital, Lightning Source Inc., Spring Arbor Distributors Inc., and Tennessee Book Company LLC.

During 1999 and 2000, Ingram Industries negotiated a sale to Barnes &amp; Noble which was ultimately withdrawn after pressure from [[independent bookstore]]s and the American Booksellers Association.

In June 2014, the company in conjunction with [[Hachette Book Group USA]], and [[Perseus Books Group]], announced a three-way deal whereby Hachette would buy Perseus and then sell that company's client services businesses to Ingram. Financial details of the deal were not disclosed.&lt;ref name="HachettePerseus"&gt;{{cite news|title=Perseus Books Group being acquired by Hachette|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/63029-hbg-buying-perseus-ingram-to-get-distribution-biz.html|accessdate=20 September 2014|publisher=''Publishers Weekly''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 4, 2016, John Ingram stepped down as CEO, being replaced by Shawn Morin.&lt;ref&gt;Shawn Morin Named CEO and President of Ingram Content Group Inc. http://www.ingramcontent.com/news/shawn-morin-named-ceo-and-president-of-ingram-content-group-inc&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
The company has the industry's largest active book inventory with access to 7.5 million titles. The markets they serve include booksellers, librarians, educators and specialty retailers. Ingram employs approximately 3,000 people worldwide.

Ingram Content Group is used heavily throughout the United States as a major distributor for independent book stores. Ingram has warehouses in Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Indiana. They also operate a print on demand business under the [[Lightning Source]] brand with facilities in Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Ohio, California, United Kingdom, France and Australia. The company also provides full service distribution including sales and marketing services via its Ingram Publisher Services division.

In addition to print distribution, Ingram also provides digital content services and distribution through CoreSource, [https://www.vitalsource.com VitalSource], and MyiLibrary.

In 2015, Ingram purchased Aer.io which allows websites, in USA only, to sell books from the Ingram catalog.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

[[File:Johann Elias Ridinger.jpg|thumb|A [[mezzotint]] of Johann Elias Ridinger in c. 1750]]
'''Johann Elias Ridinger''' (16 February 1698, [[Ulm]] &amp;ndash; 10 April 1767, [[Augsburg]]) was a German [[Painting|painter]], [[engraver]], [[Drawing|draughtsman]] and [[publisher]]. He is considered one of the most famous German engravers of animals, particularly [[horse]]s, [[hound]]s and [[hunting]] scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildlifeart.org/artists/artistDetails/index.php?aID=450|title=Johann Elias Ridinger|work=National Museum of Wildlife Art|access-date=25 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921090345/http://www.wildlifeart.org/artists/artistDetails/index.php?aID=450#|archive-date=21 September 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began his training in Ulm with the painter Christoph Resch (1701–16), and later studied under Johann Falch (1687–1727) in Augsburg. He learned the art of engraving from [[Georg Philipp Rugendas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philographikon.com/ridinger.html|title=Antique Ridinger Prints|work=philographikon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the invitation of Wolf, Freiherr von Metternich (1706–31), he spent three years in [[Regensburg]]: his coursing and visits to the riding school there proved decisive for his development. His [[Engraving|engraved]], etched and scratched sheets show the animals in characteristic movements and positions in a [[landscape]] environment. The ornamental movements in his works show visibly [[Rococo]] stylistic tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/johann-elias-ridinger-2|title=Johann Elias Ridinger|work=Answers.com|access-date=26 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105522/http://www.answers.com/topic/johann-elias-ridinger-2#|archive-date=2 April 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later founded his own art [[publishing house]] in Augsburg, where most of his works appeared. In 1759 he became the director of the [[Augsburg University of Applied Sciences|Augsburg Stadtakademie]]. His drawings were often executed with precision and taste and hence his work was held in high esteem and was also transferred to [[Decorative arts|decoration]], [[porcelain]] and [[ceramic]]s.

'''''L'Oiseau bleu''''' (also known as '''''The Blue Bird''''' and '''''Der Blaue Vogel''''') is a large oil painting created in 1912–1913 by the French artist and theorist [[Jean Metzinger]] (1883–1956); considered by [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] and [[André Salmon]] as a founder of [[Cubism]], along with [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]]. ''L'Oiseau bleu'', one of Metzinger's most recognizable and frequently referenced works, was first exhibited in Paris at the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]] in the spring of 1913 (cat. no. 2087),&lt;ref name="Gallica BnF"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k8892045/f202.image.r=.langEN Société des artistes indépendants. 29, Catalogue de la 29e exposition, 1913 : Quai d'Orsay, Pont de l'Alma, du 19 mars au 18 mai inclus / Société des artistes indépendants (cat. no. 2087)]&lt;/ref&gt; several months after the publication of the first (and only) [[Cubism|Cubist]] manifesto, ''[[Du "Cubisme"|Du «Cubisme»]]'', written by Jean Metzinger and [[Albert Gleizes]] (1912). It was subsequently exhibited at the 1913 [[:de:Erster Deutscher Herbstsalon|Erster Deutscher Herbstsalon]] in Berlin (titled ''Der blaue Vogel'', cat. no. 287).&lt;ref name="Berlin"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/ersterde00wald Herwarth Walden, ''Erster deutscher Herbstsalon'', Berlin 1913]&lt;/ref&gt; Apollinaire described ''L'Oiseau bleu'' as a 'very brilliant painting' and 'his most important work to date'. ''L'Oiseau bleu'', acquired by the City of Paris in 1937, forms part of the permanent collection at the [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mam.paris.fr/en/online-collections#/artwork/180000000001281 Jean Metzinger, ''L'Oiseau bleu'', Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Jean Metzinger, 1913, Etude pour L'Oiseau bleu, Centre Pompidou, Musée National d'Art Moderne.jpg|thumb|Jean Metzinger, 1913, ''Etude pour L'Oiseau bleu'' (''Study for The Blue Bird''), watercolor, graphite and ink on paper, 37 x 29.5 cm, [[Centre Pompidou]], [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]], Paris]]
''L'Oiseau bleu'' is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 230 x 196&amp;nbsp;cm (90.5 by 77.2 in). The work represents three nude women in a scene that contains a wide variety of components. ''L'Oiseau bleu'', writes Joann Moser, uses a wealth of anecdotal detail "which comprises a compendium of motifs found in earlier and later paintings by Metzinger: bathers, fan, mirror, ibis, necklace, a boat with water, foliage and an urban scene. It is a mélange of interior and exterior elements integrated into one of Metzinger's most intriguing and successful compositions."&lt;ref&gt;Joann Moser, 1985, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Cubist Works, 1910–1921'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

The central standing 'foreground' figure is shown affectionately holding in both hands a ''blue bird'' (thus the title of the painting). The reclining figure wearing a necklace shown in the lower center of the canvas is placed next to a pedestal fruit bowl and another bird with the unmistakable coloration of the rare [[Scarlet ibis]] (''L'Ibis rouge''), a rich symbol for both [[exoticism]] and [[fashion]]. Costume designers for Parisian cabarets such as [[Le Lido]], [[Folies Bergère]], the [[Moulin Rouge]] and [[haute couture]] houses in Paris during the 1910s used the feathers of the scarlet Ibis in their shows and collections. The Ibis is a bird to which the ancient Egyptians paid religious worship and attributed to it a 'virgin purity'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historyofgeology.fieldofscience.com/2011/01/ibis-in-myth-science-and-palaeontology.html The Ibis in myth, science and palaeontology, by David Bressan, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://geology.19thcenturyscience.org/books/1831-Cuvier-Revolutions/htm/doc.html [[Georges Cuvier]], 1831, A discourse on the revolutions of the surface of the globe, and the changes thereby produced in the animal kingdom] and [https://archive.org/details/adiscourseonrev00cuvigoog Full text here (translated from French, ''Le Règne Animal'...', the first edition of which appeared in four octavo volumes in 1817. In 1826 Cuvier would publish a revised version under the name ''Discours sur les révolutions de la surface du globe'')]&lt;/ref&gt; A mysterious pyramidal shape is seen as if through a [[porthole]] to the right of the reclining figure's head, though it remains a matter of speculation whether there exists any relation to the ibis or pyramids of ancient Egypt. In front of the pyramid appears a shape that resembles a [[sundial]], perhaps meant as the element of time, or 'duration', as the clock placed in the upper right hand corner of his ''Nude'' of 1910.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Metzinger, Nu à la cheminée (Nu), 1910, Salon d'Automne, Les Peintre Cubist, Apollinaire published 1913.jpg|Jean Metzinger, ''Nude'', 1910]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other birds, in addition to the [[blue bird]] and [[scarlet ibis]] can be seen in the composition, one of which resembles a [[green heron]]. A large steamship can be seen bellowing gaseous vapor from its funnel in the distant sea or ocean, and a smaller boat (or ''canot'') is visible below.

On the left half of Metzinger's ''L'Oiseau Bleu'', holding in her right hand a yellow fan (éventail) is a sitting nude who in her left hand holds a mirror into which she gazes. In the rest of the scene, various items and divers elements are placed, including in the upper center (practically at the highest point of the painting) the [[Sacré-Cœur, Paris|Sacré-Cœur Basilica]], located at the summit of the butte [[Montmartre]], the highest point of the city. This popular monument is just up the hill from where Metzinger lived and worked (Rue Lamarck) prior to his move to [[Meudon]] around 1912. It is also a short distance from [[Le Bateau-Lavoir]], widely known as the birthplace of Cubism.

===The flag===
[[File:Jean Metzinger, Portrait of an American Smoking, 1912, Cubist Exhibition, Boggs &amp; Buhl Department Store, Pittsburgh, July 1913.jpg|thumb|230px|Jean Metzinger, 1911-12, ''[[Man with a Pipe|Man with a Pipe (Portrait of an American Smoking)]]'', catalogue cover: ''Exhibition of Cubist and Futurist Pictures'', Boggs &amp; Buhl Department Store, Pittsburgh, July 1913]]
Edward F. Fry writes in ''Cubism'' (1978): "Three female nudes are in various postures, and the blue bird is held by the uppermost figure; in other parts of the composition are numerous birds, grapes in a dish on a table, the '''striped canopy''' of a Paris cafe, the dome of Sacre-Coeur in Montmartre, and a ship at sea."&lt;ref&gt;Edward F. Fry, ''Cubism'', Oxford University Press, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; (Bold added). Noticeably, the 'striped canopy' to which Fry refers has the same color pattern as the American flag. Recall that ''L'Oiseau bleu'' was painted as the International Exhibition of Modern Art (the [[Armory Show]]) in New York was beginning to materialize; when [[Arthur B. Davies]] and [[Walt Kuhn]] came to Paris in the fall of 1912 to select works for the Armory Show, with the help of [[Walter Pach]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psupress.org/books/SampleChapters/978-0-271-03740-0sc.html Laurette E. McCarthy, Walter Pach (1883–1958), The Armory Show and the Untold Story of Modern Art in America, Penn States University Press, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings of Metzinger, however, did not appear at the exhibition (to the surprise of many in his entourage); and this despite Picasso's 1912 recommendation. In a note to Kuhn, Picasso's handwritten list of artists recommended for the Armory Show include Gris, Metzinger, Gleizes, Léger, Duchamp, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier, Laurencin, La Fresnaye and Braque.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/container/viewer/Picasso-s-List--228110 Archive of American Art Picasso's handwritten list of artists recommended for the Armory Show]&lt;/ref&gt; He did however exhibit at the ''Exhibition of Cubist and Futurist Pictures'', Boggs &amp; Buhl Department Store, Pittsburgh, July 1913. His ''[[Man with a Pipe|Portrait of an American Smoking (Man with a Pipe)]]'', 1911–12 (Lawrence University, Appleton, Wisconsin&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130217094708/http://0-hdl.library.upenn.edu.librus.hccs.edu/1017/d/fisher/n2001030382 Jean Metzinger, ''Portrait of an American Smoking (Man with a Pipe)'', 1911-12, oil on canvas, 92.7 x 65.4 cm (36.5 x 25.75 in) Lawrence University, Appleton, Wisconsin]&lt;/ref&gt;) was reproduced on the front cover of the catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~museum/armory/marketing.html American Studies at the University of Virginia ''Marketing Modern Art in America: From the Armory Show to the Department Store'']&lt;/ref&gt; It is highly likely, since Walter Pach knew practically all the artists in the exhibition (a good friend of Metzinger and other members of the [[Section d'Or]] group; e.g., Gleizes, Picabia and the Duchamp brothers), that he had something to do with the organization of the show. Sponsored by the [[Gimbels|Gimbel Brothers]] department store from May through the summer of 1913 the Cubist and Futurist show toured Milwaukee, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and New York.&lt;ref name="McCarthy"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=j_9DhsBoyS4C&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=All+but+Metzinger+exhibited+in+the+Armory+show&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gdRHgTAE3y&amp;sig=Bcb8LjnKXlot53Sjk7tgbtENXdc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=G14bUeGNEYW7hAf85YHAAg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwCw#v=onepage&amp;q=Metzinger%20Gimbel%20Brothers&amp;f=false Laurette E. McCarthy, ''Walter Pach (1883–1958). The Armory Show and the Untold Story of Modern Art in America'', Penn State Press, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Metzinger had already been interviewed, circa 1908, by [[Gelett Burgess]] for his ''Wild Men of Paris'' article, published in ''The Architectural Record'', May 1910 (New York).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/11445-the-wild-men-of-paris Gelett Burgess, Wild Men of Paris, The Architectural Record, May 1910 (New York), documents p. 3]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915 (8 March - 3 April) Metzinger exhibited at the ''Third Exhibition of Contemporary French Art''—Carstairs (Carroll) Gallery, New York—with Pach, Gleizes, Picasso, de la Fresnaye, Van Gogh, Gauguin, Derain, Duchamp, Duchamp-Villon and Villon.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924063971836#page/n15/mode/2up/search/metzinger ''Third Exhibition of Contemporary French Art'', Carstairs (Carroll) Gallery, New York, 8 March - 3 April, 1915]. Metzinger exhibited five works: ''[[Au Vélodrome|At the Velodrome]]'' (33), ''A Cyclist'' (34), ''Woman Smoking'' (35), ''Landscape'' (36), ''Head of a Young Girl'' (37), ''The Yellow Plume'' (38)&lt;/ref&gt;

Metzinger would soon exhibit six works in New York at the Montross Gallery, 550 Fifth Avenue (4–22 April 1916) with Gleizes, Picabia, Duchamp, and [[Jean Crotti]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/show-full/bio/?artist_name=Jean%20Metzinger The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, ''Jean Metzinger'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/jean-crotti-papers-7559/more American Archives of American Art, Montross Gallery exhibition, New York, ''Jean Crotti papers, 1913-1973, bulk 1913-1961'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nyarc.org/digital_projects/gilded_age/31072002256933.pdf Montross Gallery exhibition catalogue, New York]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917 Metzinger exhibited at the ''People's Art Guild'' (founded in 1915 to disseminate art to the masses) in New York, with Pach, Picabia, Picasso, Derain and [[Joseph Stella]]. In December 1917 Metzinger exhibited at the ''Exhibition of Paintings by the Moderns'', held at [[Vassar College]] (located in the heart of the Hudson Valley in New York), with Pach, Derain, [[Edward Hopper]], [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Max Weber]].&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;

Duchamp, Picabia, Gleizes and his wife (via Hamilton Bermuda) would soon leave for New York where they would stay an extended period of time. Maurice Metzinger, Jean's brother, made several trips to the United States, in 1906, 1910 and would soon move there permanently in pursuit of his career as a Cellist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ellisisland.org/search/matchMore.asp?FNM=MAURICE&amp;LNM=METZINGER&amp;PLNM=METZINGER&amp;first_kind=1&amp;kind=exact&amp;offset=0&amp;dwpdone=1 The Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island Foundation, Inc., ''Maurice Metzinger'']&lt;/ref&gt; In light of the turmoil surrounding his non-acceptance at the Armory show, his brother's experiences in New York, his soon to be exposition at the ''Cubist Exhibition'', Boggs &amp; Buhl's, and the representation of a steamship in the upper right quadrant of ''L'Oiseau bleu'', it would not be out of the question that Metzinger made reference to the American flag (as opposed to a red and white stripped canopy of a Parisian café as suggested by Fry).

This would be remarkable in light of the growing trend of Nationalism surrounding modern art exhibitions in Paris, within which Metzinger was recognized as a French Cubist, and his work, in the French tradition: 'cubisme dans une tradition française'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://histoiremesure.revues.org/index2333.html Béatrice Joyeux-Prunel, ''Histoire &amp; Mesure'', no.

==Divisionism to Multiple perspective==

As in the works of [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] and [[Eadweard Muybridge]] there is no smooth transition between the elements and sections of Metzinger's painting, but when sutured together (with the eye) in succession or simultaneously a dynamic ensemble emerges. The composition is divided, fragmented, splintered or faceted into series, not only of individual rectangles, squares or 'cubes' of color, but into individual planes or surfaces delineated by color and form. Just as other paintings by Metzinger of the pre-war period (such as ''[[En Canot]]'', 1913) there is some continuity that transits between the foreground and background, blending perspective of objects close and far, the notion of [[depth perception]] has not been abolished, i.e., the spatial attributes of the scene have not been flattened, yet there is no absolute [[frame of reference]].

Though not the first painting by Jean Metzinger to employ the concept of [[multiple perspective]]—three years had passed since he first propounded the idea in ''Note sur la peinture'', published in 1910—''L'Oiseau bleu'' arguably exemplifies the extreme, a maxima, a ''[[summum bonum]]'' of such pictorial processes, while still maintaining elements of recognizable form; the extreme activity of geometric faceting visible in ''L'Oiseau bleu'' is not frenzied to the point that any understandable link between physicality or naturalness is lost. Yet, what is achieved is, of course, fundamentally anti-naturalistic; at great distance from the appearance of the natural world.

Aimed at a large audience (the Salon des Indépendants, rather than a gallery setting), ''L'Oiseau bleu'' deliberately sets out to agitate and confront the standard expectation of art, in an attempt to implicated the viewer, to transfer beauty and elegance into a fresh cohesive dialogue that most accurately represents [[Modernism]]—one that is in tune with the intricacies of modern life, one that describes Cubism, his Cubism, whose order was only a phase in a continuous process of change.

To achieve his goal, Metzinger raises the concept of ''mobile perspective'' (as opposed to single-point perspective of the Renaissance) to a poetic principle: a form of [[literature|literary art]] which uses the [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] qualities of [[iconography]] to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the [[Prose|prosaic]] ostensible [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]. ''L'Oiseau bleu'' contains something that Metzinger spoke of as early as 1907; a "chromatic versification", as if for syllables. The rhythm of its pictorial phraseology translates the diverse emotions aroused by nature (in the words of Metzinger).&lt;ref name="Jean Metzinger"&gt;Jean Metzinger, ca. 1907, quoted in Georges Desvallières, ''La Grande Revue'', vol. 124, 1907, as cited in Robert L. Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt; ''L'Oiseau bleu'' no longer represented nature as seen, but was a complete byproduct of the human 'sensation.' A departure from nature it was, and a departure from all that had been painted to date it was too.

Metzinger's [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] technique had its parallel in literature. For him, there was an emblematic alliance between the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] writers and [[Neo-Impressionism]]. Each brushstroke of color was equivalent to a word (or "syllable"). Together the pigments formed sentences (or "phrases") which translated the various emotions that nature would pass on to the artist. This is an important aspect of Metzinger's early work, and an important aspect of Metzinger's entire artistic output (as a painter, writer, poet, and theorist). Already then, Metzinger coupled Symbolist/Neo-Impressionist color theory with [[Paul Cézanne|Cézannian]] perspective, beyond not just the preoccupations of [[Paul Signac]] and [[Henri-Edmond Cross]], but beyond too the preoccupations of his avant-garde entourage.&lt;ref name="Robert L. Herbert 1968"&gt;Robert L. Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I ask of divided brushwork not the objective rendering of light, but iridescences and certain aspects of color still foreign to painting. I make a kind of chromatic versification and for syllables I use strokes which, variable in quantity, cannot differ in dimension without modifying the rhythm of a pictorial phraseology destined to translate the diverse emotions aroused by nature." (Metzinger, 1907)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An interpretation of this statement was made by Robert L. Herbert: "What Metzinger meant is that each little tile of pigment has two lives: it exists as a plane where mere size and direction are fundamental to the rhythm of the painting and, secondly, it also has color which can vary independently of size and placement." (Herbert, 1968)&lt;ref name="Jean Metzinger" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joann Moser, 1985, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Pre-Cubist Works, 1904-1909'', University of Iowa Museum of Art, Iowa City, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During Metzinger's Divisionist period, each individual square of pigment associated with another of similar shape and color to form a group; each grouping of color juxtaposed with an adjacent collection of differing colors; just as syllables combine to form sentences, and sentences combine to form paragraphs, and so on. Now, the same concept formerly related to color has been adapted to form. Each individual facet associated with another adjacent shape form a group; each grouping juxtaposed with an adjacent collection of facets connect or become associated with a larger organization—just as the association of syllables combine to form sentences, and sentences combine to form paragraphs, and so on—forming what Metzinger described as the 'total image'.&lt;ref name="Robert L. Herbert 1968"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Robbins, 1985, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', University of Iowa Museum of Art, Iowa City, J.

==Underlying geometric armature==
[[File:Jean Metzinger, 1912-13, L'Oiseau Bleu vs Juan Gris, 1915, Still Life with Checked Tablecloth (black and white).jpg|thumb|right|400px|Jean Metzinger, 1912-13, ''L'Oiseau Bleu'' vs [[Juan Gris]], 1915, ''Still Life with Checked Tablecloth'' (black and white)]]
Though the primary role of Metzinger's [[syntax]] was played by the relations of its intricate parts within the whole, there was another key factor that emerged: the mobile underlying geometric armature organized as a dynamic composition of superimposed planes. Metzinger, [[Juan Gris]] and to some extent [[Jacques Lipchitz]], would develop this concept further during the [[World War I|war]]; something Gleizes would notice when he returned to Paris from New York, and develop further still in ''[[Crystal Cubism#Painting and its Laws|Painting and its Laws (La Peinture et ses lois)]]'', written in 1922 and published in 1923. In that text Gleizes would attribute to this underlying armature 'objective notions of translation and rotation', words in which 'movement is implicit'.&lt;ref&gt;Gleizes, Albert, ''Painting and its laws'', (with Gino Severini: ''From Cubism to Classicism''), translation, introduction and notes by [http://www.francisboutle.co.uk/index.php?cPath=9 Peter Brooke, London, Francis Boutle publishers], 2001, {{ISBN|1-903427-05-3}}. Originally published in 1923-24. The key text in which Gleizes formulated the technique of 'translation' and 'rotation' as the permanent acquisition of Cubism.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/gltexts/1934 Peter Brooke, Translator's Introduction, Albert Gleizes in 1934, discussion of ''Painting and Its Laws'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In this sense Metzinger's ''L'Oiseau bleu'' was a precursor in its genre, more so perhaps than his ''[[Le goûter (Tea Time)]]'' of 1911, ''[[La Femme au Cheval]]'', 1911–12, or ''[[Dancer in a café]] (Danseuse)'' of 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/ressource.action%3Bjsessionid=053A4A09DC2C7A6193203996E6415888?param.id=FR_R-608f38b544a4f871a777f6e57d9d53da&amp;param.idSource=FR_O-f82fcc805fdc9c285fc92e49d4cccd56 Metzinger's ''Etude pour L'Oiseau Bleu'', 37 x 29,5 cm (Centre Pompidou, National museum of modern art, Paris) does not have the background architecture that Gleizes would write about in 1922]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photo.rmn.fr/cf/htm/CPicZ.aspx?E=2C6NU0K8G5AQ Jean Metzinger, ''Etude pour L'Oiseau Bleu'', 37 x 29,5 cm, Centre Pompidou, National museum of modern art, Paris]&lt;/ref&gt;

Now, the emergence of the 'total image' arises out of a [[:wikt:multiplicity|multiplicity]] of relatively simple interacting planes or surfaces, loosely based on the [[Golden triangle (mathematics)|Golden triangle]] and [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci spiral]]. Whereas before, each disconnected element would unite forming complex relationships as a collective, now (and progressively), the collective components would be organized into an abstract mathematical concept that is much more general; giving rise to a global topology. This underlying geometric armature would facilitate the union of a set (or sets) of complex structures on a given orientable surface.

==Symbolism and interpretations==
[[File:Coonen Chalutina Blue Bird Maeterlinck 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[The Blue Bird (play)|''The Blue Bird'']], by [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], Alisa Coonen (left) and Sofya Khalyutina (right) at Moscow Art Theatre (1908)]]
In ''The Introduction to Metaphysics'' (1903) [[Henri Bergson]] described in his theory of images how uniting a collection of disparate images acts on the consciousness and intuition, creating an alogical disposition. The Symbolist poet [[Tancrède de Visan]], who prior to 1904 and some time leading up to 1911 attended the lectures of Bergson at the College de France, met regularly with the Cubists at the poet [[Paul Fort]]'s soirees at the fashionable {{Interlanguage link multi|La Closerie des Lilas|fr|3=La Closerie des Lilas}}. He related Bergson's notion of 'accumulated successive images' to the writings of [[Maurice Maeterlinck]] circa 1907, and in 1910 advocated the technique in ''Vers et Prose''.&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten"&gt;Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, ''Cubism and Culture'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Note su la peinture'' of the same year Metzinger argues that Delaunay's ''Tour Eiffel'' combines several different views captured throughout the day in one image. 'Intuitive, Delaunay has defined intuition as the brusque deflagration of all the reasonings accumulated each day'.&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten" /&gt; The following year, in ''Cubisme et Tradition'' (1911) Metzinger writes of the immobility of paintings of the past, and that now, artists permit themselves the liberty of 'moving around the object to give, under the control of intelligence, a concrete representation derived from several successive aspects.' He continues, 'The painting possesses space, and now it also reigns in the duration' ["voilà qu'il règne aussi dans la durée"].,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/La_durée_picturale_chez_les_cubistes_et.html?id=disBOAAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Alexandre Thibault, ''La durée picturale chez les cubistes et futuristes comme conception du monde: Suggestion d'une parenté avec le problème de la temporalité en philosophie'', Université Laval, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-pTxpIgjpBcC&amp;pg=PA426&amp;lpg=PA426&amp;dq=voila+qu'il+regne+aussi+dans+la+duree&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ABVuE4XPki&amp;sig=JB1lr9wA4fROCFhx7gavJ76-hVY&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=voila%20qu'il%20regne%20aussi%20dans%20la%20duree&amp;f=false Timothy J. Clark, ''Farewell to an Idea: Episodes from a History of Modernism''], {{ISBN|0-300-08910-4}}, 1999, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; With motion and time, intuition and consciousness, Metzinger could now claim his art had moved closer to nature, closer to a true, yet subjective, reality.

Parallel to the theories of Bergson, embraced by Metzinger, Gleizes and other members of the [[Section d'Or]], Maeterlinck's ideas became of interest. Bolstered by mathematics, Reimannian geometry, and new discoveries in science that revealed existence of unseen realms (such as X-rays), and attracted to the concept of extra dimension (in addition the three spatial dimensions: the [[Fourth dimension in art|fourth dimension]]), Metzinger likely responded positively to Maeterlinck's popular stage play ''The Blue Bird'' (written in 1908), finding in it, perhaps, the analogy to the Cubist quest for higher realities.&lt;ref name="Laura Kathleen Valeri"&gt;[http://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/ETD-UT-2011-05-3479 Laura Kathleen Valeri, ''Rediscovering Maurice Maeterlinck and His Significance for Modern Art'', Supervisor: Linda D.

Maeterlinck’s play, [[The Blue Bird (play)|''The Blue Bird'']], premiered in Moscow in 1908, New York 1910, and on 2 March 1911 the play premiered in Paris at the Théâtre Réjane (owned and run by the French actress [[:fr:Réjane|Réjane]] from 1906 to 1918). The play subsequently was adapted to several films titled ''[[The Blue Bird (disambiguation)#Film Adaptations|The Blue Bird]]''. The French composer [[Albert Wolff (conductor)|Albert Wolff]] wrote an opera (first performed at the N.Y. Metropolitan, 27 December 1919, in the presence of Maeterlinck) based on Maeterlinck's original 1908 play. Due to the early popularity of the play and Metziger's various interests in science and Symbolism, and as his 1913 painting bears the same name as the play, it is relatively safe to assume that Metzinger was familiar with the work of Maeterlinck.

Edward Fry commented in ''Cubism''&lt;ref&gt;Edward F. Fry, ''Cubism'', New York and Toronto: McGraw-Hill, 1966. See too Edward F. Fry, ''Cubism'', Oxford University Press, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; that Metzinger's ''L’Oiseau bleu'' has "no significant connection with Maeterlinck’s 1910 play of the same name" may not be entirely justified.&lt;ref name="Laura Kathleen Valeri" /&gt; Aside from the presence of the ''blue bird'' (The Blue Bird of Happiness in Maeterlinck's play) there is no iconographic evidence relating to the painting to the play, but at the very least a connection between Maeterlinck and Symbolism, with Bergson and Cubism, has been established through Tancrede de Visan.&lt;ref name="Laura Kathleen Valeri" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antliff, Mark. ''Bergson and Cubism: A Reassessment.'' Art Journal 47, no. 4 (Winter 1988): 341-349.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Cubists also found support in Maeterlinck for their ideas regarding successive images and simultaneity. Contemporary critics like Visan recognized the parallel between Bergson and Maeterlinck, claiming that Maeterlinck had anticipated Bergson’s technique of successive images in ''Serres chaudes''. While Bergson argued that the artist must induce an alogical state in the beholder by juxtaposing images as disparate as possible to enable the spectator to reconstruct his or her original intuition, Maeterlinck took the same approach in ''Serres chaudes'', according to Visan. Furthermore, Maeterlinck used words and gestures in unusual ways and placed them in strange contexts with the same aim in mind. Maeterlinck’s highly popular ''L’Oiseau bleu'' and other writings, including ''Le temple enseveli'', espoused a continuity of time previously suggested by Bergson. In addition, the faceted diamond of ''L’Oiseau bleu'' not only gave the children "true sight" that closely mimicked the X-ray, but also allowed them to perceive distant times and places. Clearly responding the play, Metzinger, in his painting of the same name, breaks the objects into facets and reveals a simultaneous view of places separated by great distance. Just as Poincaré advocated that a combination of multiple perspectives could represent a higher-dimensional object, Metzinger must have seen a parallel with Maeterlinck’s diamond—a faceted object that revealed higher reality". (Laura Kathleen Valeri, 2011)&lt;ref name="Laura Kathleen Valeri" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

LIGHT: "We are in the Kingdom of the Future," said Light, a character in Meaterlinck's play, "in the midst of the children who are not yet born. As the diamond allows us to see clearly in this region which is hidden from men, we shall perhaps find the Blue Bird here..."&lt;ref name="Maeterlinck"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/8606/pg8606.html Maurice Maeterlinck, ''The Blue Bird'', A Fairy Play in Six Acts'', 1908, translate by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos in 1910 (Full text)]&lt;/ref&gt;

THE FAIRY: (Pointing to the diamond) "When you hold it like this, do you see?… One little turn more and you behold the past…. Another little turn and you behold the future…"&lt;ref name="Maeterlinck" /&gt;

LIGHT: "We are in the Kingdom of the Future, in the midst of the children who are not yet born. As the diamond allows us to see clearly in this region which is hidden from men, we shall very probably find the Blue Bird here..."&lt;ref name="Maeterlinck" /&gt;

The enchanted diamond in ''The Blue Bird'', when turned, has the virtue of setting free the spirits temporarily, a diamond " which opens your eyes" and "makes people see", even "the inside of things".&lt;ref name="Maeterlinck" /&gt;

The same year that he painted ''L’Oiseau bleu'' Metzinger wrote: 'We will not consider the forms as signs of an idea, but as living portions of the universe.' (1913)&lt;ref&gt;Jean Metzinger, ''Kubistická Technika'' (1913), in Antliff and Leighten, eds., A Cubism Reader, 607&lt;/ref&gt;

Cecchetti, ''A Ballet Dynasty'', Toronto: Dance Collection, Danse Educational Publications. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
L'Oiseau bleu et la Princesse Florine appear in a [[Pas de deux]], Act III of ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'', a [[ballet]] in three acts first performed in 1890. The music was by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Pyotr Tchaikovsky]] (his [[Opus number|Opus]] 66). The original scenario was conceived by [[Ivan Vsevolozhsky]], and is based on [[Charles Perrault]]'s ''[[Sleeping Beauty|La Belle au bois dormant]]''. [[Marius Petipa]] choreographed the original production. The premiere performance took place at the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] in 1890.

Russian composer [[Igor Stravinsky]], working for [[Sergei Diaghilev]] and the [[Ballets Russes]], achieved international fame with three ballets commissioned by the impresario Sergei Diaghilev and first performed in [[Paris]] by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes: ''[[The Firebird]] (L'Oiseau de feu)'' (1910), ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' (1911) and ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (1913). The rhythmic structure of these compositions were largely responsible for Stravinsky's enduring reputation as a musical revolutionary who pushed the boundaries of musical design.

Stravinsky's admiration for Tchaikovsky is well documented. Stravinsky's music has often been compared with Cubism. His path often crossed with the Cubists,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nvI8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=stravinsky+and+the+cubists&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RPDe_LrRz5&amp;sig=OLSBWFessDdd8D6INmub2QzVUP4&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=stravinsky%20and%20the%20cubists&amp;f=false Griffiths, Paul, ''Igor Stravinsky, The Rake's Progress'', Cambridge University Press, 1982]&lt;/ref&gt; notably Picasso and Gleizes, and through [[Ricciotto Canudo]] contributed to and became closely associated with the pro-Cubist publication ''Montjoie''.,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DteDDV50v44C&amp;pg=PA999&amp;lpg=PA999&amp;dq=%22stravinsky%22+%22albert+gleizes%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SoPnMLgD-P&amp;sig=JX8w-v6hkDQRfDkAfODBrcaLsp0&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22stravinsky%22%20%22albert%20gleizes%22&amp;f=false Richard Taruskin, ''Stravinsky and the Russian Traditions: Stravinsky and the Russian traditions: a biography of the works through Mavra'', Volume 1, Oxford University Press, 1996], and Albert Gleizes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DteDDV50v44C&amp;pg=PA999&amp;lpg=PA999&amp;dq=%22stravinsky%22+%22albert+gleizes%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SoPnMLgD-P&amp;sig=JX8w-v6hkDQRfDkAfODBrcaLsp0&amp;hl=en#v=snippet&amp;q=chaikovsky&amp;f=false Richard Taruskin, ''Stravinsky and the Russian Traditions: Stravinsky and the Russian traditions: a biography of the works through Mavra'', Volume 1, Oxford University Press, 1996], and Chaikovsky (Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky)&lt;/ref&gt; Gleizes published an article in Canudo's Montjoie entitled ''Cubisme et la tradition'', 10 February 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes, ''Le Cubisme et la Tradition'', Montjoie, Paris, 10 February 1913, p. 4. Reprinted in Tradition et Cubisme, Paris, 1927&lt;/ref&gt; It was through the intermediary of Ricciotto Canudo that Gleizes would meet the artist [[Juliette Roche]] (soon to become Juliette Roche-Gleizes); a childhood friend of [[Jean Cocteau]]. Stravinsky would later collaborate with both Picasso (Pulcinella, 1920), and Cocteau (Oedipus Rex, 1927).

Albert Gleizes painted the ''Portrait of Igor Stravinsky'' in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=95069 Albert Gleizes, ''Portrait of Igor Stravinsky'', 1914, Oil on canvas, 51 x 45" (129.5 x 114.3 cm), Museum of Modern Art, New York.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The connection between Tchaikovsky's ''L'Oiseau Bleu'' and Metzinger's ''L'Oiseau Bleu'' is not entirely far fetched in light of the close association between Stravinsky and both circles: that of the [[Ballets Russes|Russian Ballets]] and that of the Cubists. At the opening night of the Ballets Russes in Paris, May 1909, [[Vaslav Nijinsky]]'s performed with [[Tamara Karsavina]] in the ''Bluebird pas de deux''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Pas_de_deux_L_oiseau_bleu_Bluebird_from.html?id=OqkvAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Peter Ilich Tchaikovsky, Igor Stravinsky, ''Pas de deux (L'oiseau bleu - Bluebird)'' from P.

==L'Oiseau bleu (Madame d'Aulnoy)==
[[File:Épinal - L’Oiseau bleu titre.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of an edition of The Blue Bird, by [[Madame d'Aulnoy]]]]
The title ''[[The Blue Bird (fairy tale)|L'Oiseau bleu (The Blue Bird)]]'' can be traced back to a French literary fairy tale by [[Madame d'Aulnoy]] (1650/1651 – 4 January 1705), published in 1697. When d'Aulnoy termed her works ''contes de fées'' (fairy tales), she originated the term that is now generally used for the genre.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p 858, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Charming, in the story, is transformed by the fairy godmother into a blue bird. Aside from the subject of the title of Madame d'Aulnoy's story, there is further iconographic evidence in Metzinger's painting that suggests a link between the two. The first relates to the woman gazing into a mirror on the left side of Metzinger's painting.

In the Madame d'Aulnoy 1697 story it is written:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'The entire valley was a mirror. Around the valley there were more than sixty thousand women who gazed at themselves with extreme pleasure... Each saw herself as she wanted to be: the redhead seemed blonde, the brunette had black hair, the old thought she was young, the young didn't become old; finally, all defects were so well hidden that the people came from all over the world'.&lt;ref name="Madame d'Aulnoy"&gt;[http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/L’Oiseau_bleu_(Aulnoy) Madame d'Aulnoy, L’Oiseau bleu, 1697], full text in French&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With reference to the fruit visible in Metzinger's work, a link could be established as articulated in d'Aulnoy's tale: 'As soon as the day broke, the [blue] bird flew deep into the tree where fruits served as food.'&lt;ref name="Madame d'Aulnoy" /&gt;

And with reference to the necklace worn by Metzinger's reclining figure, a comparison could be made with d'Aulnoy's story:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'No day passed without [the Blue Bird – King Charming] bringing a present [présent] to Florine: sometimes a perl necklace, or the brightest and well-made rings, fastened with diamonds, an official marking [des poinçons], with bouquets of precious cut gems, that mimic the colors of flowers, pleasant books, medals, finally, she had a collection of wonderful treasures'.&lt;ref name="Madame d'Aulnoy" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Diversity and inspiration==
It is difficult to ascertain to what extent Metzinger was influenced, moved, provoked or inspired by the works of Maeterlinck, Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky or d'Aulnoy. What does emerge is the closer iconographic detail visible in Metzinger's painting with the original version of ''L'Oiseau bleu'' (the first version, that also happens to be French, of 1697) by Madame d'Aulnoy. In fact, it is the only version of ''L'Oiseau bleu'' that appears to be mirrored iconographically in Metzinger's painting.

The fact that the difficulty even exists attests to the diversity of Metzinger's interest in widely disparate subjects, widely faceted interests and sensitivities, ranging from women to fashion, from literature to science, in passing through mathematics, geometry, physics, metaphysics, philosophy, nature, classical music, opera, dance, theater, cafés, travel and poetry. He was open to all the idioms that he considered genuinely popular.&lt;ref name="Robbins"&gt;Daniel Robbins, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

:'The art that does not pass leans on mathematics' Metzinger wrote, 'Whether the result of patient study or of flashing intuition, it alone is capable of reducing our diverse, pathetic sensations to the strict unity of a mass (Bach), a fresco (Michelangelo), a bust (antiquity)."&lt;ref name="Robbins" /&gt;

"Jean Metzinger, then" wrote art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]], "was at the center of Cubism, not only because of his role as intermediary among the orthodox Montmartre group and right bank or Passy Cubists, not only because of his great identification with the movement when it was recognized, but above all because of his artistic personality. His concerns were balanced; he was deliberately at the intersection of high intellectuality and the passing spectacle."&lt;ref name="Robbins" /&gt;

===Salon des Indépendants, 1913===
The Salon des Indépendants was held 19 March through 18 May, the Cubist works were shown in room 46. Metzinger exhibited three works: ''Paysage, Nature Morte'', and his large ''L'Oiseau bleu'', number 2087 of the catalogue&lt;ref name="Gallica BnF" /&gt; — [[Albert Gleizes]] exhibited three works: ''Paysage'', ''Le port marchand'', 1912, Art Gallery of Ontario, and ''[[Les Joueurs de football|Les Joueurs de football (Football Players)]]'' 1912-13, National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C. m. 1293 of the catalogue&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k8892045/f131.image.r=.langEN Société des artistes indépendants. 29, Catalogue de la 29e exposition, 1913, Gleizes]&lt;/ref&gt; — [[Robert Delaunay]], ''L'équipe du Cardiff F.C.'', 1912–13, Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, n. 787 of the catalogue&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k8892045/f85.image.r=.langEN Société des artistes indépendants. 29, Catalogue de la 29e exposition, 1913, Delaunay]&lt;/ref&gt; — [[Fernand Léger]], ''Le modèle nu dans l'atelier (Nude Model In The Studio)'' 1912-13, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York — [[Juan Gris]], ''L'Homme dans le Café (Man in Café)'' 1912, Philadelphia Museum of Art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt323.html Salon des Indépendants 1913]&lt;/ref&gt;

In room 45 hung the works of [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Sonia Delaunay]], [[František Kupka]], [[Morgan Russell]] and [[Macdonald-Wright]]. This was the first exhibition where [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]] and [[Synchromism]] were emphatically present. Apollinaire in ''L'Intransigeant'' mentioned la Salle hollandaise (room 43), which included Jacoba van Heemskerck, [[Piet Mondrian]], Otto van Rees, [[Jan Sluyters]] en [[Leo Gestel]] and Lodewijk Schelfhout.

===Erster Deutscher Herbstsalon, Berlin, 1913===
20 September — 1 November 1913: Metzinger exhibited ''L'Oiseau bleu'' (''Der Blaue Vogel''), catalogue number 287, at [[:de:Erster Deutscher Herbstsalon|Erster Deutscher Herbstsalon]] in Berlin, an exhibition organized by [[Herwarth Walden]] (Galerie [[Der Sturm]]). Artists include [[Henri Rousseau]], the Delaunays, Gleizes, Léger, Marcoussis, Archipenko, Picabia, Kandinsky, Severini, Chagal, Klee, Jawlensky, Russolo, Mondrian and others.&lt;ref name="Berlin" /&gt;

Following the Salon d'Automne of 1913 in Paris this show took place at Potsdamer Strasse 75, Berlin. 75 artists from 12 countries exhibited 366 works. This exhibition was supported financially by the manufacturer and art collector [[:de:Bernhard Koehler|Bernhardt Köhler]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt334s.html Erster Deutscher Herbstsalon, Berlin, 1913, list of artists and works displayed]&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollinaire described the Herbst salon of 1913 as the first [[Orphism (art)|Orphist]] Salon. There were many works by Robert and Sonia Delaunay, in addition to abstract works by Picabia and Cubist works by Metzinger, Gleizes, Léger and a large number of [[Futurism|Futurist]] paintings. This exhibition was a turning-point in Apollinaire's artistic strategy for Orphism. After becoming entangled through some remarks in an argument between Delaunay and [[Umberto Boccioni]] about the ambiguousness of the term ‘simultaneity’ he did not use the term Orphism again in his art related articles. The artists labeled Orphists also brushed off the term and developed stylistic trends of their own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10142 Orphism, Erster Deutscher Herbstsalon, MoMA], Hajo Düchting, From Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris International Exposition, 1937===
The [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne]], dedicated to Art and Technology in Modern Life, was held from May 25 to November 25, 1937, in Paris, France. ''L'Oiseau Bleu'' (n. 11) was exhibited in a show entitled ''Les Maitres de I'Art Indépendant 1895-1937'', held at the [[Petit Palais]], in Paris. ''L'Oiseau Bleu'' was purchased by ''la Ville de Paris'' (the City of Paris) the same year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mam.paris.fr/en/node/603 Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, list of donations and acquisitions]&lt;/ref&gt; The Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, within the [[Palais de Tokyo]], which would soon house ''L'Oiseau Bleu'', was designed for the International Art and Technical Exhibition of 1937. This exhibition provided the opportunity for some remarkable acquisitions including: ''The Dance (La Danse)'' by [[Henri Matisse]], ''Nude in the bath'' and ''The Garden'' by [[Pierre Bonnard]], ''The Cardiff Team (L'équipe de Cardiff )'' by [[Robert Delaunay]], ''The River'' by [[André Derain]], ''Discs (Les Disques)'' by [[Fernand Léger]], ''The Stopover (l'Escale)'' by [[André Lhote]], ''L'Oiseau Bleu (The Blue Bird)'' by Jean Metzinger, [[Les Baigneuses (Gleizes)|Les Baigneuses (The Bathers)]] by [[Albert Gleizes]], four Artists’ Portraits by [[Édouard Vuillard]], which still number among the museum's masterpieces, not forgetting the large murals by Robert and [[Sonia Delaunay]], [[Albert Gleizes]] and [[Jacques Villon]], acquired during the exhibition (donated by the [[Salon des Réalités Nouvelles]] in 1939).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mam.paris.fr/en/museum Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt376s.html Kubistische werken op de Maîtres de l'art indépendant (in Dutch)]&lt;/ref&gt;

For this same massive exhibition Metzinger was commissioned to paint a large mural, ''Mystique of Travel'', which he executed for the ''Salle de Cinema'' in the railway pavilion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterhousedodd.com/jean-metzinger Waterhouse &amp; Dodd Fine Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris 1937, l'art indépendant, 1987===
Paris 1937, l'art indépendant: MAM, Musée d'art moderne de la Ville de Paris. From 12 June to 30 August 1987 ''L'Oiseau bleu'' (n. 254) was exhibited at the Musée d'art moderne de la Ville de Paris in a show entitled ''Paris 1937, l'art indépendant'', held for the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Paris International Exposition of 1937. At the 1987 memorial exhibition, consisting of 122 artists exhibiting 354 works, there were displayed considerably less works than the 1,557 presented in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt377.html Parijs 1937 L'art indépendant (in Dutch)]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Le cubisme'', 17 October 2018 to 25 February 2019, [[Centre Pompidou]], the first large-scale exhibition devoted to Cubism in France since 1973, with over 300 works on display. The 1973 exhibition, ''Les Cubistes'', included over 180 works and was held at the [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]] and [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Bordeaux|Galerie des Beaux-Arts]], Bordeaux.&lt;ref&gt;''Les Cubistes'', Bordeaux, Galerie des Beaux-Arts, 4 May – 1 September 1973, Moderne de la Ville de Paris, 26 September – 10 November 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The motivation for the Pompidou exhibition resides in broadening the scope of Cubism, usually focused on Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso, to include the major contributions of the Salon Cubists, the [[Section d'Or]], and others who participated in the over-all movement. The exhibition is held at [[Kunstmuseum Basel]], from March 31 to August 5, 2019.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/ressource.action?param.idSource=FR_E-ea420e871bb49bc7b3eb28598919c&amp;param.refStatus=nsr ''Le cubisme'', Centre Pompidou, Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, 17 October 2018 – 25 February 2019.

{{Libertarianism sidebar |Aspects}}
[[libertarianism|Libertarians]] have differing opinions on the validity of [[intellectual property]].

==Political parties==
The [[Libertarian Party of Canada]] takes "a moderate approach to patents and copyrights", calling for "a careful review of existing and proposed legislation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.libertarian.ca/platform-libertarian-party-canada |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111131447/https://www.libertarian.ca/platform-libertarian-party-canada |archivedate=2014-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anarcho-capitalist views ==

Since [[anarcho-capitalist]]s oppose the existence of even a minimal state, this ideological framework requires that any functions served by intellectual property law promulgation and enforcement be provided through private sector institutions.

[[Murray Rothbard]] argues for allowing contractually arising infinite copyright terms and against the need for any government role in protecting intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/rothbard/mes/chap15d.asp |title=Chapter 3 – Triangular Intervention |publisher=Mises.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that government's involvement in defining arbitrary limits on the duration, scope, etc. of intellectual property in order to "promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts" is inherently problematic, since "By what standard do you judge that research expenditures are 'too much,' 'too little,' or just about enough?" He argues that intellectual property laws can actually hinder innovation, since competitors can be indefinitely discouraged from further research expenditures in the general area covered by the patent because the courts may hold their improvements as infringements on the previous patent, and the patent holder is discouraged from engaging in further research in this field because the privilege discourages his improvement of his invention for the entire period of the patent, with the assurance that no competitor can trespass on his domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/rothbard/mes/chap10e.asp#7._Patents_Copyrights |title=Chapter 10 – Monopoly and Competition (continued) |publisher=Mises.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morris and Linda Tannehill]] propose that ideas in the form of inventions could be registered in a privately owned "data bank"; the inventor could then buy insurance against the theft and unauthorized commercial use of the invention, and the insurance company would guarantee to not only compensate the inventor for any losses suffered due to such infringement but to stop such unauthorized use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Market for Liberty|pages=58–59|author=Tannehill, Morris and Linda|isbn=0-930073-08-8|chapter=Property – The Great Problem Solver|year=1993|publisher=Fox &amp; Wilkes|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents to intellectual property rights include [[Wendy McElroy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McElroy |first=Wendy |year=2011 |title=Contra Copyright, Again |url=http://libertarianpapers.org/wp-content/uploads/article/2011/lp-3-12.pdf |journal=Libertarian Papers |volume=3 |issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom G. Palmer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Palmer |first=Tom G. |year=1990 |title=Are Patents and Copyrights Morally Justified? The Philosophy of Property Rights and Ideal Objects |url=http://tomgpalmer.com/wp-content/uploads/papers/palmer-morallyjustified-harvard-v13n3.pdf |journal=Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy |volume=13 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Lepage (economist)|Henri Lepage]], [[Boudewijn Bouckaert]], [[Jeffrey Tucker]], and [[N. Stephan Kinsella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bouillon |first=Hardy|editor-link1=Jörg Guido Hülsmann |editor1-first=Jörg Guido |editor1-last=Hülsmann |editor2-first=Stephan |editor2-last=Kinsella |title=Property, Freedom, and Society: Essays in Honor of Hans-Hermann Hoppe |publisher=Ludvig von Mises Institute |year=2009 |page=157 |chapter=A Note on Intellectual Property and Externalities |isbn=978-1-933550-52-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsella points out in ''Against Intellectual Property'' that patents may be inefficient since they divert resources from research and development to patent filing and lawsuits. He notices that theoretical research can not be patented as easily as practical research and thus theoretical research is relatively underfunded. Moreover, he argues that property rights can only apply to resources that are scarce, which intellectual property is not. Kinsella also claims that the only way that intellectual property rights can be implemented is by limiting others' physical property rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kinsella |first=N. Stephan |year=2008 |title=Against Intellectual Property |url=http://library.freecapitalists.org/books/Stephan%20Kinsella/Against%20Intellectual%20Property.pdf |publisher=Ludvig von Mises Institute |isbn=978-1-933550-32-9 |accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David D. Friedman]] takes a neutral stance on intellectual property, claiming "there are good arguments on both sides of that question".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailybell.com/exclusive-interviews/3771/Anthony-Wile-David-D-Friedman-on/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Left-libertarian views ==

[[Roderick T. Long]] argues that the concept of intellectual property is not libertarian. He holds that prohibiting people from using, reproducing, and trading copyrighted material is an infringement of [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]], and that since information exists in people's minds and other people's property, one cannot own information without owning other people. Claiming that authors and publishers will continue to produce absent copyright protection, he cites the fact that hundreds of thousands of articles are uploaded onto the Internet by their authors every day, available to anyone in the world for free and that nearly all works written before the 20th century are in the public domain, yet pre-1900 works are still published and sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libertariannation.org/a/f31l1.html |title=The Libertarian Case Against Intellectual Property Rights |publisher=Libertariannation.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020914233356/http%3A//libertariannation.org/a/f31l1.html |archivedate=2002-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benjamin Tucker]], opposing intellectual property, writes, "...the patent monopoly...consists in protecting inventors...against competition for a period long enough to extort from the people a reward enormously in excess of the labor measure of their services,{{spaced ndash}}in other words, in giving certain people a right of property for a term of years in laws and facts of Nature, and the power to exact tribute from others for the use of this natural wealth, which should be open to all."&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Tucker, ''Instead of a Book, By a Man Too Busy to Write One: A Fragmentary Exposition of Philosophical Anarchism'' (New York: Tucker, 1893), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ayn Rand's views ==

[[Ayn Rand]], founder of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], supported copyrights and patents, noting in ''[[Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rand |first=Ayn |authorlink=Ayn Rand |year=1966 |title=Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Patents and copyrights are the legal implementation of the base of all property rights: a man's right to the product of his mind. Every type of productive work involves a combination of mental and of physical effort: of thought and of physical action to translate that thought into a material form. The proportion of these two elements varies in different types of work. At the lowest end of the scale, the mental effort required to perform unskilled manual labor is minimal. At the other end, what the patent and copyright laws acknowledge is the paramount role of mental effort in the production of material values; these laws protect the mind's contribution in its purest form the origination of an ''idea''. The subject of patents and copyrights is ''intellectual'' property. ... Thus the law establishes the property right of a mind to that which it has brought in existence.}}
She held that patent should be granted for limited terms only: 
{{cquote|If it were held in perpetuity, it would lead to the opposite of the very principle on which it is based: it would lead, not to the earned reward of achievement, but to the unearned support of parasitism.  It would become a cumulative lien on the production of unborn generations, which would ultimately paralyze them. Consider what would happen if, in producing an automobile, we had to pay royalties to the descendants of all the inventors involved, starting with the inventor of the wheel and on up.  Apart from the impossibility of keeping such records, consider the accidental status of such descendants and the unreality of their unearned claims.}}

== Other libertarian and anarcho-libertarian views ==

Anarchists such as [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[J. Neil Schulman]] have also argued for forms of intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;See: Kinsella, [http://c4sif.org/2015/10/classical-liberals-and-anarchists-on-intellectual-property/ Classical Liberals and Anarchists on Intellectual Property], which also lists other classical liberals and anarchists and their positions on intellectual property. Kinsella's post [http://c4sif.org/2015/04/pro-ip-anarchists-and-anti-ip-patent-attorneys/ Pro-IP “Anarchists” and anti-IP Patent Attorneys] lists some more recent anarchist libertarians in favor of intellectual property. For further discussion of the views of various libertarians on this matter, see his [http://c4sif.org/resources/ Anti-IP Resources], [http://c4sif.org/2011/04/the-four-historical-phases-of-ip-abolitionism/ The Four Historical Phases of IP Abolitionism], and [http://c4sif.org/2011/04/the-origins-of-libertarian-ip-abolitionism/ The Origins of Libertarian IP Abolitionism].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Libro de Alexandre''''' is a [[Old Spanish|medieval Spanish]] [[epic poem]] about [[Alexander the Great]] written between 1178 and c. 1250 in the ''[[mester de clerecía]]''.&lt;ref name=nepaulsingh&gt;Colbert Nepaulsingh, "''Libro de Alexandre''", in Germán Bleiberg, Maureen Ihrie, and Janet Pérez, edd., ''Dictionary of the Literature of the Iberian Peninsula'', pp. 40&amp;ndash;42 (Greenwood Publishing Group, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; It is largely based on the ''[[Alexandreis]]'' of [[Walter of Châtillon]], but also contains many fantastical elements common to the [[Alexander romance]]. It consists of 2,675 stanzas of ''[[cuaderna vía]]'' and 10,700 lines. 

[[File:F 45v del Libro de Alexandre (ms O).jpg|thumb|Alexander as portrayed in MS ''O'']]
The ''Libro'' is preserved in two manuscripts, called ''P'' and ''O'', neither of which appears to be an original.&lt;ref name=nepaulsingh/&gt; There are as well three fragments preserved in separate manuscripts. Manuscript ''O'' is the earlier, copied around 1300, and includes 2,510 stanzas of ''cuaderna vía'' and two epistles. It was once owned by the [[Duke of Osuna]] (whence ''O'') and was known to the [[Marqués de Santillana]].&lt;ref name=nepaulsingh/&gt; ''P'', from [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Paris]], was copied in the fifteenth century and contains 2,639 stanzas. It is generally more reliable and together the two manuscripts make a coherent whole. R. S. Willis, Jr., produced an edition of both manuscripts where a page from ''O'' faces the corresponding page from ''P'', with fragments noted at the bottom, so that one reading can readily be corrected by the other text.&lt;ref name=nepaulsingh/&gt; ''O'' is generally considered to be from eastern [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], while ''P'' was copied in western Castile. The fragment ''G′'' is named after [[Gutierre Díez de Gamés]], who included stanzas from the first part of the ''Libro'' in his early fifteenth-century ''[[El Victorial|Victorial]]''.&lt;ref name=pountain&gt;Christopher J. Pountain, ''A History of the Spanish Language Through Texts'' (Routledge, 2001), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The date of composition is uncertain. However, it must postdate 1178, the earliest year when Walter completed the ''Alexandreis'', and predate 1250, the approximate date of the ''[[Poema de Fernán González]]'', which it influences. Some scholars have fixed the date as between 1202 and 1207.&lt;ref&gt;Such a date excludes Berceo as a possible author, as he would only have been a child at the time of composition.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the ''Alexandreis'', the author of the ''Libro'' claimed many sources. In his own words: ''el uno que leyemos, el otro que oyemos / de las mayores cosas Recabdo vos daremos'' ("the one that we read, the other that we hear / of the greatest things collected we give you").&lt;ref name=nepaulsingh/&gt; These sources include the ''[[Historia de proeliis]]'' of [[Leo of Naples]] and several ancient authorities, including Leo's source, [[Quintus Curtius]], [[Flavius Josephus]], and the ''[[Pindarus Thebanus]]''.&lt;ref name=nepaulsingh/&gt; The work of [[Isidore of Seville]] and the [[Old French]] ''[[Roman d'Alexandre]]'' were also consulted. 

Structurally the ''Libro'' is a chronological story of Alexander's life set between an introduction in six stanzas and a conclusion in seven. There are digressions and authorial displays of erudition, but the narrative, from birth to death, is logical and smooth.&lt;ref name=nepaulsingh/&gt; The problem of authorship is unresolved. It has been variously attributed to [[Juan Lorenzo de Astorga]] (sometimes thought to be merely a scribe), [[Alfonso X of Castile]], and [[Gonzalo de Berceo]].&lt;ref name=pountain/&gt;

Following is a sample text from the ''Libro'', with translations in Modern Spanish and English. This fragment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marín|first1=Francisco Marcos|title=Libro de Alexandre|url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/obra-visor/libro-de-alexandre--0/html/ff1d1018-82b1-11df-acc7-002185ce6064_16.html|publisher=Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; sums up the fall of Alexander because of his pride.

The '''''Life of Christ''''' as a narrative cycle in [[Christian art]] comprises a number of different subjects narrating the events from the life of [[Jesus]] on earth.  They are distinguished from the many other subjects in art showing the eternal life of Christ, such as [[Christ in Majesty]], and also many types of portrait or devotional subjects without a narrative element. 
[[Image:Relieftafel Szenen aus dem Leben Christi.jpg|thumb|Ivory panel with the [[Massacre of the Innocents]], [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]], and [[Wedding at Cana]], 1st third of 5th century]]

They are often grouped in series or cycles of works in a variety of media, from book illustrations to large cycles of wall paintings, and most of the subjects forming the narrative cycles have also been the subjects of individual works, though with greatly varying frequency.  By around 1000, the choice of scenes for the remainder of the [[Middle Ages]] became largely settled in the Western and Eastern churches, and was mainly based on the major feasts celebrated in the church calendars.

The most common subjects were grouped around the birth and childhood of Jesus, and the [[Passion of Christ]], leading to his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]]. Many cycles covered only one of these groups, and others combined the [[Life of the Virgin]] with that of Jesus. Subjects showing the life of Jesus during his active life as a teacher, before the days of the Passion, were relatively few in medieval art, for a number of reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, I, 152&lt;/ref&gt;  From the Renaissance, and in [[Protestant]] art, the number of subjects increased considerably, but cycles in painting became rarer, though they remained common in [[old master print|prints]] and especially book illustrations.

==Most common scenes==

The main scenes found in art during the Middle Ages are:&lt;ref&gt;Schiller has sections on each of these, and many other less common subjects. Mâle's Chapter 2 analyses 13th-century French Cathedral scenes in the text, and an appendix listing the contents of many.&lt;/ref&gt;

These scenes also could form part of cycles of the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'':
* [[Annunciation to Mary]], showing the conception of Jesus
* [[Nativity of Jesus in art]]
* [[Adoration of the Magi]] (Three Kings)
* [[Circumcision of Christ]]
* [[Presentation of Jesus]]
* [[Flight to Egypt]], or the [[Massacre of the Innocents]]. Later sometimes the [[Rest on the Flight into Egypt]].
* [[Finding in the Temple]], the last episode of Jesus's childhood in the [[Canonical Gospels]].

===Mission period===
[[File:Eadwine psalter - Morgan leaf M.521 (recto).jpg|thumb|[[Eadwine Psalter]], Morgan leaf M.521 (recto); mixed miracles and [[parables of Jesus]].  The last square has the story of the [[Prodigal Son]] in 8 scenes, the penultimate [[Dives and Lazarus]] in four.]]
* [[Baptism of Jesus]]
* [[Miraculous catch of fish]], more often found in ''Lives'' of apostles.
* [[Temptation of Christ]], often divided into its three parts.
* [[Wedding at Cana]], the first miracle recorded in the Gospels, and the only one at which Mary was present.
* [[Women in the Bible#The woman at the well in Samaria|the Samaritan woman at the well]] is occasionally depicted
* [[Transfiguration of Jesus in Christian art|Transfiguration of Jesus]], much more common in the Eastern than Western church
* [[Raising of Lazarus]]

===Passion of Christ===
* [[Christ taking leave of his Mother]], a late medieval development, not based on any Gospel episode.
* [[Palm Sunday]], Christ's entry into Jerusalem
* [[Jesus and the money changers]], much more popular as a single subject from the Renaissance on
* [[Last Supper in Christian art|Last Supper]], and [[Washing of feet]]
* [[Agony in the Garden]] of [[Gethsemane]]
* [[Betrayal of Christ]] and [[Arrest of Jesus]]
* [[Denial of Peter]] – if included, usually the only Passion scene not to include Christ
* [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus]]
* Christ before [[Pontius Pilate]]
* [[Flagellation of Christ]]
* [[Crown of Thorns|The Crowning with Thorns]]
* [[Ecce homo]]
* [[Christ carrying the Cross]]
* [[Crucifixion of Jesus]], often divided into several scenes, including the nailing to the cross, raising the cross, piercing the side of Jesus with the spear.
* [[Descent from the Cross]] (Deposition of Christ)
* [[Lamentation of Christ]]
* [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|Epitaphios]], or "Anointing of Christ"
* [[Entombment of Christ]]
* [[Harrowing of Hell]], not in the Gospels

===Resurrection to Ascension===
* [[Resurrection of Jesus in Christian art|Resurrection of Jesus]], which was not represented directly in the 1st millennium. Instead the [[Three Marys]] or [[Myrrhbearers]] finding an empty tomb was shown, or the next three scenes.
* [[Noli me tangere]]
* Meeting or [[Supper at Emmaus]]
* [[Doubting Thomas]]
* [[Ascension of Jesus in Christian art]]

==Choice of scenes==
[[Image:Giotto - Scrovegni - -26- - Entry into Jerusalem2.jpg|thumb|left|''Entry into Jerusalem'' from the large cycle in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] by [[Giotto]], c. 1266.]]
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - The Youth of Jesus (Jeunesse de Jésus) - James Tissot - overall.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Untypical scene from a large 19th-century cycle by [[James Tissot]]]]

After the Early Christian period, the selection of scenes to illustrate was led by the occasions celebrated as [[Liturgical year|Feasts of the Church]], and those mentioned in the [[Nicene Creed]], both of which were given prominence by the devotional writers on whose works many cycles appear to be based. Of these, the ''Vita Christi'' ("Life of Christ") by [[Ludolph of Saxony]] and the ''[[Meditations on the Life of Christ]]'' were two of the most popular from the 14th century onwards. Another influence, especially in smaller churches, was [[liturgical drama]], and no doubt also those scenes which lent themselves to a readily identifiable image tended to be preferred. Devotional practices such as the [[Stations of the Cross]] also influenced selection.

The [[Miracles attributed to Jesus|miracles of Christ]] did not score well on any of these counts.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, I, 152–3&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Byzantine art]] written names or titles were commonly included in the background of scenes in art; this was much less often done in the Early Medieval West, probably not least because few laymen would have been able to read them and understand the Latin.  The difficulties this could cause are shown in the 12 small narrative scenes from the Gospel of Luke in the 6th-century [[St. Augustine Gospels]]; about a century after the book was created captions were added to these images by a monk, which may already misidentify one scene.&lt;ref&gt;Lewine, Carol F.; [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3049296 JSTOR] ''Vulpes Fossa Habent or the Miracle of the Bent Woman in the Gospels of St. Augustine, Corpus Christi College, Cambridge,&lt;/ref&gt;  It was around this time that miracle scenes, which had often been prominent in [[Early Christian art]], became much more rare in the art of the Western Church.

However, some miracles commonly used as paradigms for Christian doctrines continued to be represented, especially the ''Wedding at Cana'' and ''Raising of Lazarus'', which were both easy to recognise as images, with Lazarus normally shown tightly wrapped in a white shroud, but standing up. Paintings in hospitals were more likely to show scenes of the miraculous cures. An exception is [[St Mark's Basilica]] in [[Venice]] where a 12th-century cycle of [[mosaic]]s originally had 29 scenes of the miracles (now 27), probably derived from a Greek [[gospel book]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Demus|Demus, Otto]], ''The Mosaic Decoration of San Marco Venice'' (1 volume version, edited by Herbert L. Kessler), 48–50, University of Chicago Press, 1988, {{ISBN|0-226-14292-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scenes originating in the [[apocrypha]]l Gospels that remain a feature of the depiction of ''Life of the Virgin'' have fewer equivalents in the ''Life of Christ'', although some minor details, like the boys climbing trees in the ''Entry to Jerusalem'', are tolerated. The [[Harrowing of Hell]] was not an episode witnessed or mentioned by any of the [[Four Evangelists]] but was approved by the Church, and the [[Lamentation of Christ]], though not specifically described in the Gospels, was thought to be implied by the accounts there of the episodes before and after.  Vernacular art was less policed by the clergy, and works such as some medieval tiles from [[Tring]] can show fanciful apocryphal legends that either hardly ever appeared in church art, or were destroyed at some later date.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O70759/tile-tring-tiles/ Tring tile], Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Gothic art|Gothic period]] the selection of scenes was at its most standardized. [[Emile Mâle]]'s famous study of 13th-century French cathedral art analyses many cycles, and discusses the lack of emphasis on the "public life [which] is dismissed in four scenes, the Baptism, the Marriage at Cana, the Temptation and the Transfiguration, which moreover it is rare to find all together".&lt;ref&gt;Mâle, 177&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cycles==
[[Image:Duccio - The Temptation on the Mount.jpg|thumb|[[Duccio]]'s ''Temptation on the Mount'' from his [[Maestà (Duccio)|Maestà]].]]
[[Image:Maest 001 duccio siena duomo.jpg|thumb|The rear of [[Duccio]]'s  [[Maestà (Duccio)|Maestà]]. The middle section has the Passion sequence, beginning with the entry to Jerusalem (bottom left) and ending with [[Noli me tangere]], top right, 2nd row; [[commons:Image:Maestà di duccio di buoninsegna, scenes scheme.gif|sequence]]. Below are the Works, above the post-Resurrection scenes. The birth and childhood scenes are on the front, as part of a ''Life of the Virgin''.]]

[[Early Christian art]] contains a number of narrative scenes collected on [[sarcophagi]] and in paintings in the [[Catacombs of Rome]]. Miracles are very often shown, but the Crucifixion is absent until the 5th century, when it originated in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], soon followed by the Nativity in much the form still seen in Orthodox icons today. The ''Adoration of the Magi'' and the ''Baptism'' are both often found earlier, but the choice of scenes is very variable.

The only [[Late Antique]] monumental cycles to have survived are in [[mosaic]]: [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] in [[Rome]] has a cycle from 432–430 on the birth and infancy of Christ together with other scenes from the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'', the dedicatee of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, II, 26–7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo|Sant'Appollinare Nuovo]] in [[Ravenna]] has cycles on opposite walls of the ''Works'' and ''Passion'' of Christ from the early 6th century. The ''Passion'' is notable for still not containing, among its thirteen scenes, a Crucifixion, and the ''Works'' contains eight miracles in its thirteen scenes. Neither of these features was to be typical of later art, but they are comparable to features of cycles in smaller objects of the period such as carved caskets and a gold pendant medallion of the late 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, I, 153. The medallion was found at [[Adana]] and is in the [[Istanbul Archaeological Museum]], Inv. no 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the rest of the Early Medieval period [[illuminated manuscript]]s contain the only painted scenes to have survived in quantity, though many scenes have survived from the applied arts, especially ivories, and some in cast bronze. The period of Christ's ''Works'' still seems relatively prominent compared to the [[High Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, I, 154&lt;/ref&gt;  Although this was the period when the [[Gospel book]] was the main type of manuscript to receive lavish illumination in this period, the emphasis was on depicting [[Evangelist portrait]]s, and relatively few contained narrative cycles; these are in fact more common in [[psalter]]s and other types of book, especially from the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque period]]. Where there were cycles of illustrations in illuminated manuscripts, these were normally collected together at the start of the book, or of the Gospels, rather than appearing throughout the text at the relevant places, something hardly found in Western manuscripts at all, and slow to develop in printed bibles. In the East this was more common; the 6th-century Byzantine [[Sinope Gospels]] has an unframed miniature at the bottom of every surviving page, and this style of illustrating the Gospels continued to be found in later Greek Gospel books, compelling the artist to devote more pictures to the ''Works''. Scenes with miracles were more often found in cycles of the ''life of [[Saint Peter]]'' and other apostles, from [[late antique]] [[sarcophagi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dick Stracke |url=http://www.aug.edu/augusta/iconography/miracles.html |title=Miracles, Augusta State University |work=Aug.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212194608/http://www.aug.edu/augusta/iconography/miracles.html |archivedate=2012-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Raphael Cartoons]].

In painting, the ''Life'' was often shown on one side of a church, paired with [[Old Testament]] scenes on the other, the latter usually chosen for pre-figuring the [[New Testament]] scene according to the theory of [[Typology (theology)|typology]]. Such schemes were later called the [[Poor Man's Bible]] (and in book form the [[Biblia Pauperum]]) by art historians, and were very common, though most have now vanished. After [[stained-glass]] became important in [[Gothic art]], this medium was also used, usually with a small medallion for each scene, requiring a very compressed composition. The [[fresco]]s on the walls of the [[Sistine Chapel]] showing the Lives of Christ and Moses are an unusual variant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/z-Patrons/MV_Patrons_05_01.html |title=Vatican Museums |publisher=Mv.vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 15th century [[old master print|prints]] had first scenes, then whole cycles, which were also one of the most common subjects for [[blockbook]]s.  [[Albrecht Dürer]] produced a total of three print cycles of the ''Passion of Christ'': large (7 scenes before 1500, with a further 5 in 1510) and small (36 scenes in 1510) cycles in [[woodcut]],&lt;ref&gt;Kurth, Willi. ''The Complete Woodcuts of Albrecht Durer'', Dover Books, New York, 1963. All images at Harvard external link.&lt;/ref&gt; and one in [[engraving]] (16 scenes, 1507–12).&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Walter L. ''The Complete Engravings, Etchings and Drypoints of Albrecht Durer'', Dover Books, New York, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;  These were distributed all over Europe, and often used as patterns by less ambitious painters.  [[Hans Memling]]'s ''[[Scenes from the Passion of Christ]]'' and ''[[Advent and Triumph of Christ]]'' are examples of a large number of scenes, in these case over twenty, shown in a single [[bird's eye view]] image of Jerusalem; another is illustrated here.

In Protestant areas production of paintings of the ''Life'' stopped very soon after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], but prints and book illustrations were acceptable, as free from the suspicion of [[idolatry]]. Nonetheless, there were surprisingly few cycles of the ''Life''.  [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] made a famous propaganda set of the ''Passion of Christ and Antichrist'' (1521), where 13 matched pairs of woodcuts contrasted a scene from the ''Life'' with an anti-Catholic scene. But otherwise scenes from the [[Old Testament]] and [[parable]]s were more often seen.

==Parables==
[[Image:Sebald Beham Der verlorene Sohn hütet seine Schweine.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hans Sebald Beham]] [[engraving]] of the parable of the [[Prodigal Son]] with his pigs, 1536]]
Of the thirty or so [[parables of Jesus]] in the [[canonical Gospel]]s, four were shown in medieval art almost to the exclusion of the others, but not normally mixed in with the narrative scenes of the ''Life'', though the page from the [[Eadwine Psalter]] ([[Canterbury]], mid 12th century) illustrated here provides an exception to this. These were: the [[Wise and Foolish Virgins]], [[Dives and Lazarus]], the [[Prodigal Son]] and the [[Good Samaritan]].&lt;ref&gt;Mâle, 195&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Labourers in the Vineyard]] also appear in Early Medieval works.

From the Renaissance the numbers shown widened slightly, and the three main scenes of the Prodigal Son – the high living, herding the pigs, and the return – became the clear favourites.  [[Albrecht Dürer]] made a famous [[engraving]] of the Prodigal Son amongst the pigs (1496), a popular subject in the [[Northern Renaissance]], and [[Rembrandt]] depicted the story several times, although in at least one of his works, ''[[The Prodigal Son in the Tavern]]'', a portrait of himself "as" the Son, revelling with his wife, is like many artists' depictions, a way of dignifying a genre [[merry company]] or tavern scene.&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Gerard van Honthorst 004.jpg|Gerard van Honthorst]]&lt;/ref&gt;  His late ''Return of the Prodigal Son'' (1662, [[Hermitage Museum]], [[St Petersburg]]&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 125.jpg|''Return of the Prodigal Son'']]&lt;/ref&gt;) is one of his most popular works.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8751">{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of Landor's ''Imaginary Conversations''}}
This is a list of the ''[[Imaginary Conversations]]'' of [[Walter Savage Landor]], a series of dialogues of historical and mythical characters. It follows the retrospective order and arrangement of the five-volume collection, chosen by Landor himself and to be found in his ''Collected Works''. These were then published separately (1883).

The original spelling and use of honorifics and titles is retained, but some names are made fuller in order to disambiguate.

In the Soviet Union, many cities had '''statues and monuments of Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov''', the revolutionary and leader of the [[Russian SFSR]], better known by the ''[[nom de plume]]'' '''[[Vladimir Lenin]]'''. With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, many of them were destroyed without the consent of their creators. This happened even earlier in the European post-Communist states and in the [[Baltic states]]. However, in many of the former [[Soviet Republics]] (namely [[Russia]], [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]]) many remain, and some new ones have been erected.&lt;ref name=new/&gt;

However, the restored monument to the city authorities moved on the forecourt, in front of the Legislative Assembly and a monument to Catherine II. Moving the monument prompted an outcry from the townspeople: according to law enforcement agencies, the Communists and other patriotic organizations organized picket lines several times in front of the Legislative Assembly demanding the return of the monument to its place.

It was a supposed focal point of a new housing development to be named 'Lenin Court' but the bust became a target of fascist sympathisers and was frequently daubed with anti-Communist and anti-semitic messages. Lubetkin had the bust removed and when the housing development was completed in the late 1940s, it was renamed 'Bevin Court'. The bust was displayed in Islington Town Hall for many years and is now on permanent display in the museum.

'''''Look Mickey''''' (also known as '''''Look Mickey!''''') is a 1961 oil on canvas painting by [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. Widely regarded as the bridge between his [[abstract expressionism]] and [[pop art]] works, it is notable for its ironic humor and aesthetic value as well as being the first example of the artist's employment of [[Ben-Day dots]], [[speech balloon]]s and comic imagery as a source for a painting. The painting was bequeathed to the Washington, D.C., [[National Gallery of Art]] upon Lichtenstein's death.

Building on his late 1950s drawings of [[comic strip]]s characters, ''Look Mickey'' marks Lichtenstein's first full employment of [[painterly]] techniques to reproduce almost faithful representations of pop culture and so satirize and comment upon the then developing process of mass production of visual imagery. In this, Lichtenstein pioneered a motif that became influential not only in 1960s pop art but continuing to the work of artists today. Lichtenstein borrows from a Donald Duck illustrated story book, showing [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Donald Duck]] during a fishing mishap. However, he makes significant alterations to the original source, including modifying the color scheme and perspective, while seeming to make statements about himself.

The work dates from Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition, and is regarded by art critics as revolutionary both as a progression of pop art and as a work of [[modern art]] in general. It was later reproduced in his 1973 painting, ''[[Artist's Studio—Look Mickey]]'', which shows the painting hanging prominently on a facing wall of Lichtenstein's studio.

==Background==
During the late 1950s and early 1960s a number of American painters began to adapt the imagery and motifs of comic strips into their work. Lichtenstein was among them, and in 1958 began to make drawings of comic strip characters. [[Andy Warhol]] produced his earliest paintings in the style in 1960. Lichtenstein, unaware of Warhol's work, produced ''Look Mickey'' and ''Popeye'' in 1961.&lt;ref name=L72/&gt;&lt;!--were these the only 1961 works of this type. It matters to the next claim, see the word "especially". --&gt;  Lichtenstein's 1961 works, especially ''Look Mickey'', are considered a minor step from his earlier comic strip pop art.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|page=21|Rondeau|Wagstaff|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Look Mickey source.jpg|thumb|Lichtenstein used this image from ''Donald Duck Lost and Found'' (illustrated by Bob Grant and Bob Totten) for ''Look Mickey''.]]
According to the Lichtenstein Foundation, ''Look Mickey'' was based on the [[Little Golden Book]] series.&lt;ref name=C/&gt; The National Gallery of Art notes that the source is entitled ''Donald Duck Lost and Found'', written in 1960 by Carl Buettner and published through [[Disney Consumer Products|Disney Enterprises]]. The image was illustrated by Bob Grant and Bob Totten.&lt;ref name=TC/&gt;&lt;ref name=RLOF175&gt;{{cite book|page=175|editor=Bader|last1=Bader|first1=Graham|chapter=Donald's Numbness|year=2009|quote=|title=Roy Lichtenstein: October Files|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative theory suggests that ''Look Mickey'' and ''Popeye'' were enlargements of bubble gum wrappers.&lt;ref name=L72&gt;{{harvnb|Livingstone|2000|pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; This image marked the first of numerous works in which Lichtenstein [[Cropping (image)|crop]]ped his source to bring the viewer closer to the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|page=31|Rondeau|Wagstaff|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of stories purport to tell of the moment of inspiration for ''Look Mickey''. Critic Alice Goldfarb Marquis writes that the artist recalled one of his sons pointing to a comic book and challenging; "I bet you can't paint as good as that".&lt;ref name=TPR&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pop! Revolution|author=Marquis, Alice Goldfarb|page=37|chapter=The Arts Take Center Stage|isbn=978-0-87846-744-0|year=2010|publisher=[[MFA Publications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another says that the painting resulted from an effort to prove his abilities to both his son and his son's classmates who mocked Lichtenstein's hard-to-fathom abstracts.&lt;ref name=RLOF166&gt;{{harvnb|page=166|Bader|2009|loc="Donald's Numbness"}}&lt;/ref&gt; American painter [[Allan Kaprow]] once stated, in reference to a [[Bazooka (chewing gum)|Bazooka]] [[Dubble Bubble]] Gum wrapper, to Lichtenstein, "You can't teach color from Cézanne, you can only teach it from something like this." Lichtenstein then showed him one of his Donald Duck images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein|author=Waldman, Diane|year=1993|isbn=0-89207-108-7|chapter=Early Pop Pictures|publisher=[[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the comic book phase of his career, Lichtenstein often slightly altered the colorization of the original source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein|publisher=[[Praeger Publishers]]|editor=Coplans, John|chapter=|year=1972|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marco Livingstone, his early comic subjects comprise a "loose and improvised style clearly derived from [[Willem de Kooning|de Kooning]]."&lt;ref name=L72/&gt; Art historian Jonathan Fineberg describes a Lichtenstein painting of 1960 as an "...abstract expressionist picture with Mickey Mouse in it, related stylistically to the de Kooning ''Women''".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fineberg|1995|page=260|loc="The Landscape of Signs: American Pop Art 1960 to 1965"}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Leo Castelli saw both Lichtenstein's and Warhol's large comic strip-based works, he elected to show only Lichtenstein's, causing Warhol to create the ''[[Campbell's Soup Cans]]'' series to avoid competing with the more refined style of comics Lichtenstein was then producing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pop Art: An International Perspective|editor=Livingstone, Marco|year=1991|isbn=0-8478-1475-0|publisher=Rizzoli International Publications, Inc.|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="W109"&gt;Bourdon, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; He once said "I've got to do something that really will have a lot of impact that will be different enough from Lichtenstein and [[James Rosenquist]], that will be very personal, that won't look like I'm doing exactly what they're doing."&lt;ref name="Wat79"&gt;Watson, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein's foray into comics led to the abandonment of the topic by Warhol.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fineberg|1995|page=251|author=Fineberg|loc="The Landscape of Signs: American Pop Art 1960 to 1965"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Lichtenstein continued to work with comic sources, after 1961 he avoided the easily identified sources like [[Popeye]] and [[Mickey Mouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fineberg|1995|page=261|loc="The Landscape of Signs: American Pop Art 1960 to 1965"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During autumn 1961, Allan Kaprow, a fellow teacher at [[Rutgers University]], introduced Lichenstein to art dealer [[Ivan Karp]], the director of the Leo Castelli Gallery. Lichtenstein showed Karp several paintings, but not ''Look Mickey''. He instead impressed him with ''[[Girl with Ball]]'', and Karp decided to represent Lichtenstein a few weeks later.&lt;ref name=C&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lichtensteinfoundation.org/frames.htm |title=Chronology |accessdate=May 9, 2012 |publisher=Roy Lichtenstein Foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507132503/http://www.lichtensteinfoundation.org/frames.htm |archivedate=May  7, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The painting is one of Lichtenstein's first non-[[expressionist]] works, and marks his initial employment of [[Ben-Day dots]] which he used to give it an "industrial" half-tone effect. The painting is his first use both of a speech balloon&lt;ref name=C/&gt; and [[comics]] as source material.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alloway|1983|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work has visible pencil marks and was produced using a plastic-bristle dog brush to apply the oil paint onto the canvas.&lt;ref name=C/&gt;  By the time of his death, ''Look Mickey'' was regarded as Lichtenstein's breakthrough work.&lt;ref name=PAILD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/sep/30/news/mn-37730/2|title=Pop Art Icon Lichtenstein Dies|accessdate=June 23, 2013|date=September 30, 1997|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=Knight, Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote="It occurred to me one day to do something that would appear to be just the same as a comic book illustration without employing the then current symbols of art: the thick and thin paint, the calligraphic line and all that had become the hallmark of painting in the 1940s and '50s. I would make marks that would remind one of a real comic strip."|source=—Lichtenstein on the germination of his style&lt;ref name=RLOF&gt;{{cite book|page=57|editor-last=Bader|title=Roy Lichtenstein: October Files|last=Lichtenstein|first=Roy|chapter=A Review of My Work Since 1961&amp;mdash;A Slide Presentation}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In reproducing a mass-produced illustration in a painterly style, Lichtenstein simplifies by reducing the composition to primary colors, which serves to accentuate its mass appeal and largely gives it the "pop" look.&lt;ref name=TC/&gt; Typically, Ben-Day dots enable an artist to produce a variety of colors by using dots of a few colors to give the illusion of a broader pallet. By mixing dots of different colors, like an ink jet printer, just a few colors can create a broad spectrum using only a limited number of primary hues. Lichtenstein as a painter and not a mass production printer is able to avoid this, achieving his individual color tones without blending existing hues. Instead, for each color that he wanted to include in a work, he used that color paint.&lt;ref name=p29&gt;{{harvnb|page=29|Rondeau|Wagstaff|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lichtenstein made several alterations to the original work: he eliminated various non-essential figures and rotated the dock so that Donald looks off the side rather than the end. At the same time, he kept Donald and Mickey in almost the same positions as they were in the original.&lt;ref name=RLOF174&gt;{{harvnb|page=174|Bader|2009|loc="Donald's Numbness"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein not only redesigned the space, but also altered the position of Donald's body and fishing rod for better balance and eliminated signs of stress and exertion to form a meticulous composition.&lt;ref name=RLOF174-5&gt;{{harvnb|pages=174–75|Bader|2009|loc="Donald's Numbness"}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Disney]] said about Donald Duck: "He's got a big mouth, a big belligerent eye, a twistable neck and a substantial backside that's highly flexible. The duck comes near being the animator's ideal subject."&lt;ref name=RLOF189&gt;{{harvnb|page=189|Bader|2009|loc="Donald's Numbness"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein's painting reflects many of these physical features.&lt;ref name=RLOF190&gt;{{harvnb|page=190|Bader|2009|loc="Donald's Numbness"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to the original source, Donald leans further forward towards the water, and Mickey less so. Mickey's face is more flushed, seemingly less from exertion, than embarrassment for and perhaps [[schadenfreude]] towards Donald.&lt;ref name=p27/&gt; The composition incorporates some of the foibles of comic book printing, including misaligning the joining of the contours of the waves with the yellow sky to give rise to an area of [[white space (visual arts)|white space]].&lt;ref name=p29/&gt;

==Interpretation==
The large scale reproduction of a comic strip frame was considered radical and revolutionary at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Livingstone|2000|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics applauded the work's playfulness, inherent humor and irreverence. According to Diane Waldman of the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], "''Look Mickey'' is broad comedy and falls into the category of slapstick&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name=RLDW55&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein|author=Waldman, Diane|page=59|publisher=[[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]|year=1993|isbn=0-89207-108-7|chapter=Comic Strips and Advertising Images|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lichtenstein's [[obituary]], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' critic Christopher Knight described the work as "a slyly hilarious riff on Abstract Expressionism".&lt;ref name=PAILD/&gt; Lichtenstein's slight alterations to its "linear clarity and colour", the critic writes, add to its aesthetic value and grandeur, reinforced by his choice of scale.&lt;ref name=PAES/&gt; A common misconception about Lichtenstein comes from the fact that in his best known works, his meticulous approach to painting is purposely disguised because he superficially seeks his paintings to appear as if facsimiles of industrial produced pop culture icons.&lt;ref name=RLOF174-5/&gt; Graham Bader wrote that "Lichtenstein's painting in fact appears more the product of industrial manufacture than the very pulp image on which it is based."&lt;ref name=RLOF176&gt;{{harvnb|page=176|Bader|2009|loc="Donald's Numbness"}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Look Mickey'' is considered [[self-reference|self-referential]] in the sense that the artist is painting something through which the viewer may see elements of the artist.&lt;ref name=RLOF176-8&gt;{{harvnb|pages=176–78|Bader|2009|loc="Donald's Numbness"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Narcissus-Caravaggio (1594-96) edited.jpg|thumb|''Look Mickey'' has reflective elements that call upon [[Caravaggio]]'s ''[[Narcissus (Caravaggio)|Narcissus]]''.&lt;ref name=RLOF176-8/&gt;]]

Bader observes that ''Look Mickey'' is concerned both with the artistic process and Lichtenstein's new painting techniques. He believes it can be considered a self-portrait in the sense that it "explicitly situates the painting's maker himself within the self-enclosed narcissistic circuit at its center". The painting shows Donald looking into the reflective water at Lichtenstein's blue 'rfl' signature "as a kind of surrogate for the image's creator", in a manner that is reminiscent of [[Caravaggio]]'s ''[[Narcissus (Caravaggio)|Narcissus]]'', in which the subject gazes at his own reflection on the water.&lt;ref name=RLOF176-8/&gt; This is viewed as an allegory of Lichtenstein's position as an artist trained to develop his [[Realism (arts)|realist]] instincts despite the prominence of [[abstract expressionism]]. When viewed this way, Mickey serves as the "vanguard [[Modern art|modernist]]" [[superego]] towering over Lichtenstein and laughing at his retrograde efforts.&lt;ref name=p27/&gt;

Lichtenstein uses red Ben-Day dots to color Mickey's face. According to some art critics, this gives the character the appearance of [[blushing]]. Other interpretations are that the coloration is merely skin pigmentation or that it is the hue associated with a "healthy glow," since Mickey has historically been viewed as a creature with skin rather than fur.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|page=26|Rondeau|Wagstaff|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another interpretation – supported by the original source in which Mickey says that if Donald can land the fish he can have it for lunch – is that Mickey's face is red due to the exertion necessary to contain his disbelief and laughter while he experiences his amused superiority.&lt;ref name=p27&gt;{{harvnb|page=27|Rondeau|Wagstaff|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those adhering to the blushing interpretation are bolstered by the uneven blotchiness of the red dots, but others are quick to point out that Lichtenstein's Ben-Day dot technique was still in a primitive stage. He did not develop the use of a stencil (i.e. the technique of pressing the liquid paint onto the surface through a screen of dots) to present uniformly distributed dots until 1963.&lt;ref name=p28&gt;{{harvnb|page=28|Rondeau|Wagstaff|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham Bader, describing it as the engine of the painting's narrative, notes the intrigue created by the juxtaposition of Donald's heightened sense of visual perception as it relates to his anticipated catch, and his deadened sense of tactile perception as it relates to having a fishing hook in the back of his own shirt. In this sense, Lichtenstein has chosen to depict a source that has as its subject a divide between raised visual awareness and an absent sense of touch:&lt;ref name=DN/&gt;

{{Quote|text=Donald is an explicitly divided subject, all sensory experience on one end and, literally, numbness on the other (and, visually, all depth and all flatness – for Donald's face is by far the painting's most spatially illusionistic element, while his caught jacket, merged with the schematic waves behind it, emphatically one of its flattest). Indeed, Donald is a portrait of precisely the separation of sight and feeling, vision and touch… What divides vision and touch in Look Mickey, what marks this shift between them, is text: the words that Donald (and Lichtenstein) introduces to the scene, and which the duck's pole-cum-brush passes through before snagging his own back end.|sign=Bader|source=&lt;ref name=DN/&gt;}}

Lichtenstein frequently explored vision-related themes after he began to work in the pop art genre; early examples include ''[[I Can See the Whole Room...and There's Nobody in It!]]'' and ''Look Mickey''.&lt;ref name=RL85/&gt; In this painting, Donald's large eyes indicate his belief that he has caught something big while Mickey's small eyes indicate his disbelief that Donald has caught anything significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein|author=Hendrickson, Janis|publisher=[[Benedikt Taschen]]|year=1993|isbn=3-8228-9633-0|page=20|chapter=The Beginnings}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Lichenstein's works with subjects looking through a periscope (''[[Torpedo...Los!]]''), a [[mirror]] (''[[Girl in Mirror]]'') or a [[peephole]] (''I Can See the Whole Room&amp;nbsp;... and There's Nobody in It!''), ''Look Mickey'', with a subject looking at his reflection in the water, is a prominent example of the theme of vision.

{{Quote|text=The idea of doing [a cartoon painting] without apparent alteration just occurred to me&amp;nbsp;... and I did one really almost half seriously to get an idea of what it might look like. And as  I was painting this painting I kind of got interested in organizing it as a painting and brought it to some kind of conclusion as an aesthetic statement, which I hadn't really intended to do to begin with. And then I really went back to my other kind of painting, which was pretty abstract. Or tried to. But I had this cartoon painting in my studio, and it was a little too formidable. I couldn't keep my eyes off it, and it sort of prevented me from painting in any other way, and then I decided this stuff was really serious&amp;nbsp;... I would say I had it on my easel for a week. I would just want to see what it looked like. I tried to make it a work of art. I wasn't trying just to copy. I realized that this was just so much more compelling.|sign=Lichtenstein|source=&lt;ref name=PAES&gt;{{cite book|title=Pop Art|author=Shanes, Eric|isbn=978-1-84484-619-1|page=84|year=2009|publisher=Parkstone Press International|chapter=The Plates}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The painting was bequeathed to the Washington [[National Gallery of Art]] after Lichtenstein's death in 1997, following a 1990 pledge in  honor of the institution's 50th Anniversary.&lt;ref name=TC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/20centpa/20centpa-71479.html|title=The Collection: National Gallery of Art|accessdate=May 9, 2012|publisher=[[National Gallery of Art]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/16/arts/inside-art.html|title=Inside Art|accessdate=May 9, 2012|date=January 16, 1998|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Vogel, Carol}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains in the gallery's collection, where, {{asof|November 2012|lc=on}}, it is on permanent view.&lt;ref name=TC/&gt;

[[Harold Rosenberg]] once described Lichtensteins reworking of the comics source as follows: "...the difference between a comic strip of Mickey Mouse and a Lichtenstein painting of the same was art history, or the fact that Lichtenstein paints with the idea of the museum in mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/crv/summary/v034/34.3beaty.html|title=Roy Lichtenstein's Tears: Art vs. Pop in American Culture|accessdate=June 30, 2013|volume=34|issue=3|year=2004|author=Beaty, Bart|work=Canadian Review of American Studies|pages=249&amp;ndash;268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Paolo and Francesca da Rimini''''' is a [[watercolour]] by English artist and poet [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], painted in 1855 and currently housed at [[Tate Britain]].

==History==
Rossetti's real name was Charles Gabriel Dante Rossetti, but his admiration for the great Florentine poet led him to change it to Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and he proceeded to sign all his work so. In the specific, the very subject of this painting is taken from [[Dante Aligheri]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', [[Inferno (Dante)#Second Circle .28Lust.29|Canto V]] – it is a small watercolour [[triptych]] executed in the archaic, [[medieval]]ising style of this period in Rossetti's art, and was never painted in oil. Although the artist had been sketching the subject for many years, the watercolour took him just one week to complete. The buyer was the writer and critic [[John Ruskin]].&lt;ref&gt;The subject was commissioned by Ellen Heaton, but [[John Ruskin]], who had requested five watercolours from Rossetti, bought it for 35 guineas and offered it, along with another picture, to Miss Heaton. He described the picture to her in a letter as 'a most gloomy drawing – very grand – but dreadful – of Dante seeing the soul of Francesca and her lover!' Not surprisingly, Heaton was dissuaded from buying the picture, which Ruskin kept for himself. Cf. V. Surtees, ''The Paintings &amp; Drawings of Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828–1882): A Catalogue Raisonné'', vol.1, Oxford 1971, p.37. See also the Tate's ref.[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=12779&amp;tabview=text&amp;texttype=10]&lt;/ref&gt; The drawing is simple and the colours generally muted. Only Francesca's long golden hair looks forward to the more sensuous creatures of Rossetti's later works. The picture was originally planned as a triptych in oil, with the same scenes as in the watercolour, but with the lovers kissing as the central motif.

===The Triptych and the inspiring ''Canto''===
[[Francesca da Rimini|Francesca]] was the sister-in-law of [[Paolo Malatesta]], and both were married, but they fell in love. Their tragic adulterous story was told by Dante in his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', Canto V of the ''Inferno'', and was a popular subject with [[Victorian era|Victorian]] artists and sculptors, especially with followers of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] ideology, and with other writers.

The triptych has several inscriptions taken from Canto V, with Rossetti bringing the story to life by writing relevant quotations in the original Italian around the edge of the composition.&lt;ref&gt;The top of central panel has the inscription ''O lasso!'' ("Alas!"). At bottom left, another continues the same verse, ''quanti dolci pensier, quanto disio...'' ("how many sweet thoughts, how great desire"), Inferno, Canto V, vv.112–113.&lt;/ref&gt; Its three parts read from left to right. The left-hand panel shows the adulterous kiss that condemns the lovers: staying faithful to Dante's poem, Rossetti depicts them reading about the [[Arthurian legend|Arthurian]] knight [[Sir Lancelot]] who also suffered for his forbidden love (his figure can be seen on the book's open page, dressed, like Paolo, in red and blue). The scene illustrates the following lines from Dante's text:
{{quote|One day we read, to pass the time away,
of Lancelot, of how he fell in love;
alone we were, and no suspicion near us 
... then he, who never from me shall separate,
at once my lips all trembling kissed.|''[[Divine Comedy]]'', Canto V, vv.127–136 (free transl.)}}

The central panel depicts two of Rossetti's literary heroes crowned with laurel: the Roman poet [[Virgil]] and the much-revered Dante himself – they regard with concern the two lovers on the right, who appear to float like wraiths in each other's arms, amid the flames of hell. Their adulterous relationship uncovered, they were murdered by Francesca's husband and Paolo's brother, [[Sigismondo Malatesta]], and banished to the second circle of hell.

In the final panel of the triptych, the lovers are being blown about violently with the wind, as described by Dante's verses: {{quote|The infernal storm, eternal in its rage, sweeps and drives the spirits with its blast.|''[[Divine Comedy]]'', Canto V, vv.31–32}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4233">'''Pentachromacy''' describes the capability and capacity for capturing, transmitting, processing, and perceiving five independent channels of [[color]] information through the primary visual system. Organisms with pentachromacy are termed ''pentachromats''. For these organisms, it would take at least five differing ranges of wavelengths along the electromagnetic spectrum to reproduce their full visual spectrum.  In comparison, a combination of red, green, and blue wavelengths of light are all that is necessary to simulate most of the common human [[trichromat]] visual spectrum.

One proposed explanation for pentachromacy is a [[retina]] containing five distinct types of [[cone cell]]s with differing absorption spectra. In actuality the number of cone cell types may be greater than five as different types may be active at a specific intensity or range of intensities for a given wavelength of electromagnetic radiation.

==Animals that are potentially pentachromats==

Some [[bird]]s (notably [[pigeon]]s) and [[butterfly|butterflies]] have five or more kinds of color receptors in their retinae, and are therefore believed to be pentachromats,&lt;ref&gt;[&lt;!---http://www.springerlink.com/content/q77725639466x474/---&gt;https://kops.uni-konstanz.de/bitstream/handle/123456789/20276/Delius_Wavelength.pdf Wavelength discrimination in the ‘visible’ and ultraviolet spectrum by pigeons], Jacky Emmerton1, and Juan D. Delhis, Journal of Comparative Physiology A. Volume 141, Number 1. March, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; though [[psychophysics|psychophysical]] evidence of functional pentachromacy is lacking. Research also indicates that some [[lamprey]]s, members of the [[Petromyzontiformes]], may be pentachromats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/content/abstract/fj.06-8057comv1?ck=nck Functional characterization, tuning, and regulation of visual pigment gene expression in an anadromous lamprey -- Davies et al., 10.1096/fj.06-8057com -- The FASEB Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; It is suspected that a human female could inherit multiple alleles for [[color blindness]] as [[protanomaly]], [[deuteranomaly]], and/or [[tritanomaly]] leading to the phenotypic expression of at least four and possibly as many as six types of color-sensing cones, although the red-, green-, and blue-deficient cones would have degenerate spectral sensitivity. {{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Color range in pentachromats==

According to [[Jay Neitz]], a visual spectrum researcher at the [[University of Washington]], the three common types of cones in the human retina—long, medium, and short wavelength—can each distinguish approximately 100 intensities of light throughout their continuum of sensitivity within the visual spectrum. The visual cortex in the [[occipital lobe]] of the cerebrum can multiplex these varying intensities which allows a typical human to distinguish approximately one million discrete hues.&lt;ref name="Roth 2006" &gt;{{cite web

  |date= September 13, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretically, a pentachromat, assuming the same spectral resolution of 100 intensities for each of five cone cell types and the same cognitive combinatorial capacity, may be capable of distinguishing up to 10 billion colors.&lt;ref&gt;"Color Vision:Almost Reason for Having Eyes" by Jay Neitz, Joseph Carroll, and Maureen Neitz  Optics &amp; Photonics News January 2001 1047-6938/01/01/0026/8- Optical Society of America&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that animals sensitive to more than three color channels are likely to see the world in a very different way from humans. These animals are likely to experience different and more numerous [[unique hues]], along with additional ways of mixing them.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

'''The Proclamation of the German Empire''' (18 January 1871) is the title of several [[historical painting]]s by the German painter [[Anton von Werner]].

On 18 January 1871, Anton von Werner was present at the proclamation of the [[German Empire]] in [[Versailles]] in his capacity as a painter. In the following years, he produced several versions of the imperial proclamation at greater intervals, two of which were shown in prominent places in [[Berlin]]. Only a third version was preserved to [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s last residence, [[Friedrichsruh]], and is now open to the public. It is the most reproduced picture of the [[Founding of the German Empire#Imperial Proclamation in Versailles|Imperial Proclamation]].

Since the three paintings show strong differences, the images are of great documentary and historical dichotomy. Von Werner obviously adapted them to the wishes of his respective clients. The clothes worn by Bismarck in the first painting do not match with the other two paintings. Bismarck is wearing his white parade uniform in the second and third painting, which places him in the focus of the viewer. In fact, in Versailles, he was wearing a blue gun coat. In addition, he was holding the Order of [[Pour le Mérite]] on his white uniform, which he received in 1884. Minister of War [[Albrecht von Roon]], who did not participate in the proclamation of Versailles, was also included in the third version. In the first, second, and third paintings, the [[Frederick I, Grand Duke of Baden|Grand Duke of Baden]] summons the new emperor. The perspective makes it appear that the imperial proclamation was above all a work of the princes and of the military.

Von Werner began working on the picture as one of the most active and influential German artists.

== First painting, 1877 ==
[[File:Die Kaiserproklamation 1871, Gemälde von 1877.png|thumb|On this reproduction of the painting, Werner's self-portrait can be seen on the extreme right margin (with a mustache).]]
[[File:Galerie des Glaces du Château de Versailles transformée en ambulance militaire.jpg|thumb|The [[Hall of Mirrors]] in the [[Palace of Versailles]]. A few days after the imperial proclamation, the victors of the [[Siege of Paris (1870–71)|Siege of Paris]] used it as a hospital (contemporary painting).]]
In 1870, von Werner spent the final phase of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] at the headquarters of the [[Franco-Prussian_War order of battle#Third Army|Third Army]] led by Prussian crown prince [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick William]]. In January 1871, the latter asked him to travel from [[Karlsruhe]] to the "Grand Headquarter" in the [[Palace of Versailles]] to "experience something worthy of your brush."&lt;ref&gt;Zitat bei Gaethgens: ''Anton von Werner, die Proklamierung des Deutschen Kaiserreichs; ein Historienbild im Wandel preußischer Politik.'' Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 1990, S. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Von Werner was only informed of the Proclamation of the German Empire on 18 January. The crown prince had impressed the design of the Palace of Versailles, which presented itself to visitors as a national site of fame in France, furnished with historical paintings. He wanted something similar for Berlin, but, unlike [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], he had not come to the idea that the imminent ceremony would be designed by the painter for posterity. Napoleon had allowed [[Jacques-Louis David]] to stage the furnishing and the appearance of the actors in his imperial crown for a historical painting.&lt;ref&gt;Zur Inszenierung Davids siehe [[Michael Sauer (Historiker)|Michael Sauer]]: ''Bilder im Geschichtsunterricht.'' Kallmeyer, Seelze-Velber 2000, {{ISBN|3-7800-4923-6}}, S. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prussian ceremony in the [[Hall of Mirrors]] was short and simple. In the elongated gallery stood, on the window side, Prussian and Bavarian soldiers and on the mirror side, their officers, mixed with some other southern German armies. The King, accompanied by German princes and his entourage, crossed the trellis to the middle, where a field altar was erected. There, a Potsdam military spiritst celebrated a worship service, which the chorus had decided to sing "''Nun danket alle Gott"'' ([[Now Thank We All Our God]]). Then, the group went to a flat platform at the end of the gallery, where the princes and William stood in the middle. Bismarck, who stood below and was surrounded by commanders, read the imperial proclamation. Thereupon, the Grand Duke of Baden issued a "Hoch" ("Hurrah") to "His Majesty Emperor William", which those who were in attendance repeated three times. The ceremony was over, while the calls continued among the troops station in the palace and the park.&lt;ref&gt;Beschreibung der Zeremonie bei Gaethgens: ''Anton von Werner. Die Proklamierung'', S. 14–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the worship, Werner was able to quickly draw the main characters in the immediate vicinity. He later portrayed the princes, the representatives of the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] cities and numerous officers. During the work, an almost friendly relationship with the Crown Prince came about, as well as the personal relations to Federal Chancellor Bismarck and Emperor William.

Werner had the problem of representing the [[Trellis (architecture)|trellis]] that formed the soldies with the officers to the gallery and the princes grouped around them. The adjoining oil painting by Victor Bachereau-Reverchon (1842-1885) shows the comparatively narrow space, from whose end the flat gallery for the Emperor had already been removed. It was also important to take the picture of the ceiling paintings that glorify [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] as a conqueror of German lands and cities. As early as January 1871, a conceptual design followed, and later a model, which was approved by the Crown Prince.&lt;ref&gt;Dazu Gaethgens: ''Anton von Werner. Die Proklamierung'', S. 18, 22; Vorstudie in Öl, 78 × 158&amp;nbsp;cm, Privatbesitz in Sachsen, verschollen.&lt;/ref&gt;

The picture was commissioned for the [[Berlin Palace|Berlin city palace]]. Werner determined the image format according to a place he had chosen in the "White Hall", the largest of the château, which was used for public events such as the opening of the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] and the grand court. His visit was the end and highlight of the guided tours through the representative rooms of the castle, where several hundred paying visitors took part every day.&lt;ref&gt;E. Hennings: ''Das königliche Schloss in Berlin. Ein Führer durch seine Sehenswürdigkeiten.'' Selbstverlag des Verfassers, Berlin o. J. [um 1906], zum Bild und zur Bildergalerie (unten) S. 31, zu den Besucherzahlen S. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The picture was against the window wall, opening the view to [[Unter den Linden]].&lt;ref&gt;Zum Umbau Goerd Peschken, Hans-Werner Klünner: ''Das Berliner Schloß. Das klassische Berlin. Unter Mitarbeit von Fritz-Eugen Keller und Thilo Eggeling.'' Propyläen, Berlin 1991, {{ISBN|3-549-06652-X}}, S. 490–492, zur Bilder- und Gobelingalerie (unten) S. 487 f.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|William II]] had the hall redesigned in 1892, the picture only fitted into a 9.5 x 9.7m gap at the western end of the picture gallery, thus losing its effect. After the transformation of the picture gallery into a gobeling gallery by William II in 1914 and the following years of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the period of [[Nazi Germany|National Socialism]], the painting remained like most "parental pictures" of the castle, the eyes of the visitors. Werner's headquarters at the castle were burned during the [[World War II|Second World War]] on 2 February 1945, during an [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|air raid on Berlin]].

== Second painting, 1882 ==
The great popularity of the painting prompted William I to entrust Werner with the production of the imperial proclamation in the newly erected Hall of Famy of the Prussian Army in Berlin's [[Zeughaus]]. There, opposite to the entrance of the ''Ruler's Hall'', two wall paintings of Werner's flanked the figure of the victorious goddess Viktoria von [[Fritz Schaper]]. To the left was the coronation of [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick III]] as Prussian King, and on the right was the proclamation of William I as German Emperor in 1701 and 1871 respectively. The dome, painted by [[Friedrich Geselschap]] &lt;small&gt;([[:de:Friedrich Geselschap|de]])&lt;/small&gt;, arched above.

Werner designed a frontal display showing William on a high platform surrounded by German princes. At the lowest level, Bismarck, whom Werner had emphasised for colour composition with white uniforms, turned to him, Roon, Moltke and other German commanders. In the foreground, cheering officers to the right of the picture could be seen and to the left a larger group of simple soldiers. In the meantime, two allegorical figures held the Emperor's coat of arms. William rejected Werner's design as being unrealistic, especially since Roon had not taken part in the ceremony. He agreed, however, with Bismarck's uniform, which was also inaccurate. "You are right, he was wrongly dressed."&lt;ref&gt;Dazu Bartmann 1985, S.&amp;nbsp;114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the smaller width of the picture, Werner had to reduce the size of the painting considerably. Only the princes of seven larger states remained to the figures of William I, the Crown Prince, and the Grand Duke of Baden. Werner even further reduced the group of officers, placing [[Georg von Kameke]], who had now been appointed Minister of War, in the foreground while others came to the rear. The Prussian Army, with Bavaria, were now documented by a hand of the Prussian General [[Leonhard Graf von Blumenthal|Leonhard von Blumenthal]] with his Bavarian comrade [[Jakob von Hartmann]], emphasised by his high head of hair and light blue uniform.&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;In the reception of the second painting, it was often problematic that some features such as the now white uniform of Bismarck and his decoration of the [[Pour le Mérite]] do not correspond to the actual historical situation of 1871. Werner, however, deliberately portrayed the participants in the imperial proclamation according to the real circumstances of 1882, and thus a decade after the [[Founding of the German Empire|founding of the Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Dies wird nur selten zur Kenntnis genommen, wie in: [[Dietrich Grünewald]] (Hrsg.): ''Kunst entdecken.'' Cornelsen, Berlin 2009, S. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The figures were aged by a good ten years and had gained in importance at the same time. The emperor was now more than just a ''[[primus inter pares]]'', and Bismarck had received the Order. [[Thomas W. Gaehtgens]] thus assigned to this image the function that "it is not a description of history, but credentials of the present with the help of a past occurrence."&lt;ref&gt;Gaehtgens: ''Anton von Werner, die Proklamierung des Deutschen Kaiserreichs; ein Historienbild im Wandel preußischer Politik.'' Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 1990, S.&amp;nbsp;64.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thus, according to William's view, the second painting emerged as a section of the first with a strong emphasis on figures of William before the princes and flags and Bismarck before the commanders and officers. Only a strict Cuirassier on the left in the foreground, represents the simple soldiers, namely Louis Stellmacher of [[Lychen]] of the [[Gardes du Corps (Prussia)|Gardes du Corps]] regiment (see picture).

The wall painting survived the air raids on the Zeughaus in November 1943, but was no longer in its frame after further damage to the building at the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Siehe die Abbildungen der zerstörten Herrscherhalle bei Regina Müller: ''Das Berliner Zeughaus. Die Baugeschichte.'' Brandenburgisches Verlagshaus, Berlin 1994, {{ISBN|3-89488-055-4}}, S. 146 (Nr. 246, November 1943) und 256 (Nr. 253, 1945).&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Third painting, 1885 ==
[[File:Wernerprokla.jpg|thumb|Painting for Otto von Bismarck, handed over on 1 April 1885. Oil on canvas. 1.67 x 2.02m. Otto-von-Bismarck-Stiftung, Friedrichsruh]]
Werner's second painting, like the Hall of Fame, was also a great success. The [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern family]] asked Werner enthusiastically to paint another painting of the imperial proclamation to give it to the "Iron Chancellor" Bismarck for his 70th birthday in 1885. In the brevity of the time, Werner could only satisfy the wish by colouring the black and white model of the Zeughaus. Again the participants had grown older. At the end of March 1885, Werner used a visit to the Grand Duke of Baden in his studio to update his depiction of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Gaehtgens: ''Anton von Werner, die Proklamierung des Deutschen Kaiserreichs; ein Historienbild im Wandel preußischer Politik.'' Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 1990, S.&amp;nbsp;65.&lt;/ref&gt; One exception was [[Albrecht von Roon|Roon]], who had died in 1879 and was not present in 1871. William I had insisted on putting him in the painting because of his close relations to Bismarck. Werner painted Roon as if he would have been a participant at the proclamation. He had portrayed him several times on paintings on the Franco-Prussian War. Werner sacrificed Hartmann's hand print with Blumenthal for Roon's Square. Both moved so closely together that now Hartmann's turn to Blumenthal appears unmotivated.

== Fourth painting, 1913 ==
In 1913, Werner created a barely reproduced fourth painting of the Imperial Proclamation as a wall painting for the new building at the Realgymnasium School in [[Frankfurt (Oder)|Frankurt (Oder)]] (wax paints on canvas, 4.90 x 7.50m). The appearance of this painting was not passed on. In the Second World War it remained undamaged, but was lost after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Bartmann: ''Anton von Werner. Zur Kunst und Kunstpolitik im Deutschen Kaiserreich'', S. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ralph Dodd''' (c. 1756 &amp;ndash; 11 April 1822) was a late 18th-century British civil [[engineer]] primarily known for his attempt to produce the first tunnel underneath the [[Thames]] in 1798.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Skempton |first=A.W. |title=A Biographical Dictionary of Civil Engineers in Great Britain and Ireland |year=2002 |publisher=Thomas Telford |isbn=978-0-7277-2939-2 |pages=184–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and family==
Born in the North East of England, Ralph Dodd was the second son of Alexander Dodd, and had an aptitude for drawing along with his elder brother [[Robert Dodd (artist)|Robert Dodd]] (1748–1816).&lt;ref&gt;George W. Younger," Robert &amp; Ralph Dodd, Marine Painters", THE MARINER'S MIRROR, Vol.10, 1924, No.3. page 243&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving an education in mechanics, both Ralph and his brother Robert spent five and a half years at the [[Royal Academy]] schools practicing as a portrait painter. His older brother Robert is known for his maritime landscapes and works on the [[French Revolutionary Wars]].

Dodd had two sons, Barrodall Robert Dodd (c.1780-1837) and George Dodd (c.1783-1827); who both became engineers and pioneers of steam power.&lt;ref&gt;J.G.James, ''Ralph Dodd, The Very Ingenious Schemer'', Newcomen Society Papers, Vol. No 47, 1976, page 161 foll.&lt;/ref&gt; His namesake, Ralph Dodd(s) (1792-1874) went on to become an engineer and mentor to locomotive engineers [[George Stephenson]] (1781-1848) and relative Isaac Dodds (1801-1882), founder of [[Isaac Dodds and Son]].

He has been well documented as an innovator  and registered a number of building patents, including British Patent No 3141 on 3 June 1801 for a building system that was over 150 years ahead of its time.

As a high-profile founder and promoter of engineering schemes, particularly in London, England, Dodd generally resigned his tender as engineer within one to two years of his projects receiving Parliamentary approval.  Most of his schemes went on to be successfully completed by renowned engineers of the day, such as [[John Rennie the Elder|John Rennie]] and [[Robert Mylne (architect)|Robert Mylne]]. During his career, Ralph Dodd,  was known for his flair for publicity and generating public interest, but has been portrayed by some of his detractors as a failure due to his general early departure from these companies despite repeated success.

In December 1821 he suffered severe burns when the boiler of the paddle steamer ''Sovereign'' (80 feet long, of the River Severn Steam Yacht Co, built by H. Turner, Stourport and registered on 30 Jan. 1822, British National Archives Registration No BT/107/168) exploded at Gloucester on her trial run. The damage sustained to the ship was so bad that she was broken up directly. Following the accident he took advice to go to Cheltenham for his health and, since he was nearly penniless, he walked there in the middle of winter. He died at Cheltenham on 11 April 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Two portraits of Ralph Dodd are to be found, one, probably in his artist days, c.1780-1810 and another at the height of his engineering career, c.1815-1820&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tunnels==
Having been employed to undertake surveys of [[canals]], [[coal mines]], [[harbours]] and other civil engineering works of the late eighteenth century Dodd turned his attention to tunnels, proposing the first under water tunnel in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1796.  The Tynemouth proposal was for a tunnel between [[North Shields]] and [[South Shields]], which was inspired by local undersea mining activities in [[Wylam]] and [[Whitehaven]] and was based on estimating parameters used for tunnel costings for the Grand Junction Canal.

===Gravesend to Tilbury===
In 1798 Dodd published his proposal for the building of a tunnel between Gravesend and Tilbury to “The great and the good” of Kent and Essex. His prospectus for the business played on the military advantages in having a tunnel as it had long been recognised that there was a need to be able to move troops rapidly between Kent and Essex in the event of war.

The proposal was of great interest to the military, but Charles Clarke of the Gravesend Ordnance Office was not impressed. In particular he believed that the tunnel design would not work as Dodd had not thought through the dimensions correctly, but also that the design was fundamentally flawed and sought to provide mathematical proof of this. He also challenged assumptions about the likely use of the tunnel and questioned Dodd’s experience and capabilities. Despite Clarke’s objections, and by eliciting the support of people in high places, a company to build the tunnel was set up and an Act of Parliament passed to approve its construction. (Stat. 39 GEO. III., c73) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kenthistoryforum.co.uk/index.php?topic=3757.0]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thames Tunnel was started some 800 yds. east of [[Tilbury Fort]], to join Tilbury to Gravesend in 1798. Much difficulty was experienced with flooding so a steam driven pump and digging machines were commissioned in 1801. After a number of disasters the pumping was abandoned and a figure of £15,242.10s.4d. was expended before the project was terminated in 1802.

===Gravesend to Strood===
In 1798 Dodd also proposed a canal from near Gravesend to Strood. This became the Thames &amp; Medway canal though it is not clear whether he was involved past the planning and approvals stage. Although this canal was closed, a tunnel forming part of the route, which for many years was shared by the canal and railway is used by trains travelling between Gravesend and Strood.

==Waterworks==
Despite little experience of water works in 1805 Dodd published his book 'Observations on Water' in which he proposed the creation of numerous London Waterworks.

===South London Waterworks Company===

===East London Waterworks Company===

===West Middlesex Waterworks Company===

==Canals and waterways==
In 1795 Dodd wrote ''An Account of the Principal Canals in the Known World''. As a riposte, J. Whitfield wrote ''The Engineering Plagiarist'', accusing Dodd of copying John Philips' ''General History of Inland Navigation'', Newcastle 1792. However, he was undeterred and continued to work on canal schemes.

===Newcastle-Carlisle-Maryport Canal===

In January 1794 Dodd surveyed and proposed the Newcastle-Carlisle-Maryport Canal. Subsequently, [[William Chapman (engineer)|William Chapman]] and [[William Jessop]] did a more detailed survey. By June 1795 he published a pamphlet proposing a canal from Stella in [[Blaydon-on-Tyne]] to [[Hexham]] on the south side of the [[River Tyne]] and estimated a cost of £35,709 for 18 miles of canal with 12 locks.

John Sutcliffe rejected Ralph Dodd's plans and proposed a different Stella to Hexham line 44 feet wide at the surface and 6 feet deep taking craft between 50 and 60 tons, but not existing keels. This 17 mile, 18 lock route was estimated at almost £90,000 to bring a revenue of £23,460 and a net yield of £17,595.

Having a looked at John Sutcliffe’s plans, Robert Whitworth approved it, noting 'is a rugged one; I never before saw a good line like it; yet so far as I can discover, I believe it is the best the country affords: It is certainly practicable, and I have no doubt but that a good and useful canal may be made (with some variation) upon it; but it will be exceedingly expensive: I am, however, told the trade that will come upon this canal will fully answer that expense, even were it twice as much'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jim-shead.com/waterways/index.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thames Medway Canal===
Following a successful proposal to Parliament an Act was obtained by Dodd in 1800. Following suggested amendments by John Rennie in 1802 works began with management of the construction and engineering being undertaken by John Rowe.

===Grand Surrey Canal===
Dodd suggested and promoted plans for a canal between Croydon and Rotherhithe during 1799. In 1800 this developed into the [[Grand Surrey Canal]] and the Croydon Canal and his plans were authorised by an Act of Parliament obtained on 21 May 1801. This created the Company of Proprietors of the Grand Surrey Canal, and gave them powers to raise £60,000 by issuing shares, and an additional £30,000 if required.

Dodd, assisted by his sons Barrodall and George, began engineering works but resigned from the project to be replaced by Rennie, a position that was to be repeated.

===Other proposed works===

* 1800: Involved with the Mersey and Irwell navigation
* 1802: Proposal for North London (London to Cambridge) - not executed
* 1810: Proposed link between Andover and Basingstoke canals - not executed
* 1815: Continuation of Surrey Canal to Vauxhall - not executed

==Bridges==

===Vauxhall Bridge===

Originally presented as The Prospectus for the Intended Prince's Bridge Ralph Dodd's hand written observations can be found at [[Battersea Library]], London. Following numerous months taking tally notes on crossing types at [[Battersea Bridge]], then operating a toll system, Dodd petitioned the [[Prince Regent]] in 1806-1811 for an Act allowing the construction of a bridge across the Thames to relieve congestion.

Dodd was successful in receiving an Act of Parliament, but exited the project in 1812 after being renamed the [[Vauxhall Bridge]] Company. Once again replaced by Rennie who was unsuccessful in this endeavour and also resign from the project.

===Springfield Bridge===
The Springfield Bridge was constructed in 1819-1821.

==Docks, harbours and ports==
Following his work on canals and waterways Ralph Dodd briefly turned his attention to harbours producing two proposals. First in 1800 with Ralph Dodd cooperating on a huge Port of London improvement scheme together with other, more famous, civil engineers.&lt;ref&gt;"Select Committee's Third Report", London, 28 July 1800.&lt;/ref&gt; and later the 1819 Brighton Pier scheme.

===Other Proposals===
*1796: Tynemouth Harbour proposal
*1811: Grimsby harbour proposal

==The Intended London Distillery Company==
In 1807 Ralph Dodd opened public subscriptions for transferable shares to raise capital of £100,000, divided into 2000 shares of £50 each, for the Intended [[The London Distillery Company|London Distillery Company Ltd]],&lt;ref&gt;Joint stock companies with transferrable shares. Report of the arguments, upon the application to the court of King's bench, for leave to file an information against Mr. Ralph Dodd, upon the statue of 6 geo. I. cap. 1s. 95 - 102. https://books.google.com/books?id=sPlbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA95#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false.&lt;/ref&gt; to manufacture Genuine British Spirits and Compounds.

Suitable premises were purchased and managers and other officers were employed, including both known malt distiller Mr Carr and chief rectifier ([[Rectified spirit]]) Mr John Taylor. However, no attempt was made to obtain incorporation and a solicitor was engaged to draft a deed of trust.&lt;ref&gt;The King v. Dodd, 9 East 515 (1808)&lt;/ref&gt; This proved to be an error and in 1808 criminal action was taken against Dodd for the promotion of a scheme for a company with transferrable shares in violation of the [[Bubble Act]].  Dodd decided to dispute this legal action but ultimately lost the case in 1808 resulting in the [[dispansion]] of The London Distillery Company until mid-2011.&lt;ref&gt;London’s whisky revival, http://misswhisky.com/tag/london-distillery-company/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;First whisky in 100 years to be made in London, http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/scotland/first-whisky-in-100-years-to-be-made-in-london-1-2363596&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Britain led the world in the development of canals, bridges and tunnels which acted as a stimulus for the Industrial Revolution by facilitating the transport of raw materials and manufactured goods. Ralph Dodd cannot claim to have been the greatest of technical engineers but his ideas and entrepreneurial flair led to the construction of many important British landmarks, including Vauxhall Bridge in London. Ralph Dodd, with his work on the Gravesend to Tilbury tunnel, the Grand Surrey Canal and London Waterworks, paved the way for the civil engineers who followed, such as his sons whom carried out much work on their own account, John Rennie, George Stephenson and [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]. Dodd was farsighted in realising that the individual canals and waterways being built would eventually be joined together, and later forge the way for railways inspiring a new generation of civil engineers.

==Dodd's Gin==
On April 2, 2013, [[The London Distillery Company]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.londondistillery.com&lt;/ref&gt; launched a super premium gin with luxury retailer [[Fortnum and Mason]] in tribute to Ralph Dodd. Dodd's Gin is made using an innovative production technique involving both traditional pot and vacuum distilling. Dodd's Gin is produced, bottled and labeled by hand in Bermondsey, London.

[[File:Red herring.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Herrings [[kipper]]ed by smoking and salting until they turn reddish-brown, i.e., a "red herring". Prior to refrigeration kipper was known for being strongly [[pungency|pungent]]. In 1807, William Cobbett wrote how he used [[kipper]] (a strong-smelling smoked fish) to lay a false trail, while training [[hunting dog]]s—an [[apocrypha]]l story that was probably the origin of the idiom.]]

A '''red herring''' is something that misleads or distracts from a relevant or important issue.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. red herring, n. Third edition, September 2009; online version December 2011. http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/160314; accessed 18 December 2011. An entry for this word was first included in New English Dictionary, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be either a logical [[fallacy]] or a [[literary device]] that leads readers or audiences towards a false conclusion. A red herring might be intentionally used, such as in mystery fiction or as part of [[rhetorical strategies]] (e.g., in politics), or it could be inadvertently used during argumentation.

The term was popularized in 1807 by English polemicist [[William Cobbett]], who told a story of having used a [[kipper]] (a strong-smelling smoked fish) to divert hounds from chasing a hare.

== Logical fallacy ==

As an [[informal fallacy]], the red herring falls into a broad class of [[relevance]] fallacies. Unlike the [[straw man]], which is premised on a distortion of the other party's position,&lt;ref name="Hurley2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hurley, Patrick J.|title=A Concise Introduction to Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ikp2dGWT5O4C&amp;pg=PT155|year=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-8400-3417-5|pages=131–133|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222174516/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ikp2dGWT5O4C&amp;pg=PT155|archivedate=2017-02-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the red herring is a seemingly plausible, though ultimately irrelevant, diversionary tactic.&lt;ref name="Tindale2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tindale, Christopher W.|title=Fallacies and Argument Appraisal|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-84208-2|pages=28–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', a red herring may be intentional, or unintentional; it is not necessarily a conscious intent to mislead.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;

The expression is mainly used to assert that an argument is not relevant to the issue being discussed. For example, ''"I think we should make the academic requirements stricter for students. I recommend you support this because we are in a budget crisis, and we do not want our salaries affected."'' The second sentence, though used to support the first sentence, does not address that topic.

== Intentional device ==

A red herring is often used in legal studies and exam problems to mislead and distract students from reaching a correct conclusion about a legal issue, allegedly as a device that tests students' comprehension of underlying law and their ability to properly discern material factual circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheppard|first=Steve (ed.)|title=The history of legal education in the United States : commentaries and primary sources|date=2005|publisher=Lawbook Exchange|location=Clark, N.J.|isbn=1584776900|edition=2nd print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the idiom ==

{{quote box|author=-[[William Cobbett]], February 14, 1807|title=Continental War|source=''Cobbett's Political Register, Volume XI''&lt;ref name=cobbett/&gt;|quote="When I was a boy, we used, in order to draw oft' the [[Harrier (dog)|harriers]] from the trail of a [[hare]] that we had set down as our own private property, get to her haunt&lt;ref&gt;''haunt'' – Wiktionary defines [[wikt:haunt|haunt]] as a "place at which one is regularly found; a hangout", but it can also mean a "feeding place for animals", both senses would work here.&lt;/ref&gt; early in the morning, and drag a red-herring, tied to a string, four or five miles over hedges and ditches, across fields and through [[coppices]], till we got to a point, whence we were pretty sure the hunters would not return to the spot where they had thrown off; and, though I would, by no means, be understood, as comparing the editors and proprietors of the London daily press to animals half so sagacious and so faithful as hounds, I cannot help thinking, that, in the case to which we are referring, they must have been misled, at first, by some political deceiver."|width=30%|border=4px|align=right}}

In a literal sense, there is no such fish as a "red herring"; it refers to a particularly strong [[kipper]], a fish (typically a [[herring]]) that has been strongly [[Curing (food preservation)|cured]] in [[brine]] and/or heavily [[Smoking (cooking)|smoked]]. This process makes the fish particularly pungent smelling and, with strong enough brine, turns its flesh reddish.&lt;ref name=quinion2002&gt;{{cite web | author=Quinion, Michael | year=2002–2008 | title=The Lure of the Red Herring | work=[[World Wide Words]] | url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/herring.htm | accessdate=November 10, 2010 | authorlink=Michael Quinion | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104180714/http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/herring.htm | archivedate=November 4, 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its literal sense as a strongly cured kipper, the term can be dated to the mid-13th century, in the poem ''[[The Treatise (Walter of Bibbesworth)|The Treatise]]'' by [[Walter of Bibbesworth]]: "He eteþ no ffyssh But heryng red."&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter de Bibbesworth|Bibbesworth, Walter de]] (c. 1250) [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=hmocAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Femina&amp;dq=Femina&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KcecUKrvNpGImQW0zIDoCw&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwCg ''Femina''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230213316/https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=hmocAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Femina&amp;dq=Femina&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KcecUKrvNpGImQW0zIDoCw&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwCg |date=2017-12-30 }} Trinity College, Cambridge MS B.14.40. 27.

Prior to 2008,&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt; the [[figurative sense]] of "red herring" was thought to originate from a supposed technique of training young [[scent hound]]s.&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt; There are variations of the story, but according to one version, the pungent red herring would be dragged along a trail until a puppy learned to follow the scent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Nashe|Nashe, Thomas]]. (1599) [http://www.oxford-shakespeare.com/Nashe/Nashes_Lenten_Stuff.pdf ''Nashes Lenten Stuffe''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715030947/http://www.oxford-shakespeare.com/Nashe/Nashes_Lenten_Stuff.pdf |date=2011-07-15 }} "Next, to draw on hounds to a sent, to a redde herring skinne there is nothing comparable." (Since Nashe makes this statement not in a serious reference to hunting but as an aside in a humorous pamphlet, the professed aim of which is to extol the wonderful virtues of red herrings, it need not be evidence of actual practice. In the same paragraph he makes other unlikely claims, such as that the fish dried and powdered is a prophylactic for kidney or gallstones.)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, when the dog was being trained to follow the faint odour of a [[Fox hunting|fox]] or a [[badger]], the trainer would drag a red herring (whose strong scent confuses the animal) perpendicular to the animal's trail to confuse the dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jal.2008.09.004 |first=J.E.P |last=Currall  |year=2008 |title=Authenticity: a red herring? |journal=Journal of Applied Logic |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=534–544 |issn=1570-8683|last2=Moss |first2=M.S. |last3=Stuart |first3=S.A.J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dog eventually learned to follow the original scent rather than the stronger scent. A variation of this story is given, without mention of its use in training, in ''The Macmillan Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' (1976), with the earliest use cited being from W. F. Butler's ''Life of Napier'', published in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;[[Burton Stevenson|Stevenson, Burton]] (ed.) (1976) [1948] ''The Macmillan Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' New York: Macmillan. p.1139. {{ISBN|0-02-614500-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]]'' (1981) gives the full phrase as "Drawing a red herring across the path", an idiom meaning "to divert attention from the main question by some side issue"; here, once again, a "dried, smoked and salted" herring when "drawn across a fox's path destroys the scent and sets the hounds at fault."&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Ivor H. (ed.) (1981) ''[[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]] (Centenary edition, revised) New York: Harper &amp; Row. p.549. {{ISBN|0-06-014903-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another variation of the dog story is given by Robert Hendrickson (1994) who says escaping convicts used the pungent fish to throw off hounds in pursuit.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickson, Robert (2000). ''The Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins''. United States: Checkmark.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a pair of articles by Professor Gerald Cohen and Robert Scott Ross published in ''Comments on Etymology'' (2008), supported by etymologist [[Michael Quinion]] and accepted by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the idiom did not originate from a hunting practice.&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt; Ross researched the origin of the story and found the earliest reference to using herrings for training animals was in a tract on horsemanship published in 1697 by Gerland Langbaine.&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt; Langbaine recommended a method of training horses (not hounds) by dragging the carcass of a cat or fox so that the horse would be accustomed to following the chaos of a hunting party.&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt; He says if a dead animal is not available, a red herring would do as a substitute.&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt; This recommendation was misunderstood by Nicholas Cox, published in the notes of another book around the same time, who said it should be used to train hounds (not horses).&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt; Either way, the herring was not used to distract the hounds or horses from a trail, rather to guide them along it.&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt;

The earliest reference to using herring for distracting hounds is an article published on 14 February 1807 by radical journalist [[William Cobbett]] in his polemical periodical ''[[Political Register]]''.&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Red herring", [[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', Sense 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cobbett&gt;"...we used, in order to draw oft' the harriers from the trail of a hare that we had set down as our own private property, get to her haunt early in the morning, and drag a red-herring, tied to a string, four or five miles over hedges and ditches..." For the full original story by Cobbett, see [https://archive.org/stream/cobbettspolitica11cobb#page/116/mode/2up "Continental War"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629152657/http://www.archive.org/stream/cobbettspolitica11cobb |date=2016-06-29 }} on pg. 231-33 of ''Political Register'', February 14, 1807. In [https://archive.org/details/cobbettspolitica11cobb ''Cobbett's political register, Volume XI, 1807''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803231251/https://archive.org/details/cobbettspolitica11cobb |date=2016-08-03 }} at [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cohen and Ross, and accepted by the OED, this is the origin of the figurative meaning of red herring.&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt; In the piece, William Cobbett critiques the English press, which had mistakenly reported Napoleon's defeat. Cobbett recounted that he had once used a red herring to deflect hounds in pursuit of a hare, adding "It was a mere transitory effect of the political red-herring; for, on the Saturday, the scent became as cold as a stone."&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt; Quinion concludes: "This story, and [Cobbett's] extended repetition of it in 1833, was enough to get the figurative sense of ''red herring'' into the minds of his readers, unfortunately also with the false idea that it came from some real practice of huntsmen."&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt;

=== Real-world usage ===

Although Cobbett popularized the figurative usage, he was not the first to consider red herring for scenting hounds in a literal sense; an earlier reference occurs in the pamphlet ''Nashe's Lenten Stuffe'', published in 1599 by the Elizabethan writer [[Thomas Nashe]], in which he says "Next, to draw on hounds to a scent, to a red herring skin there is nothing comparable."&lt;ref name=Nashe&gt;[[Thomas Nashe|Nashe, Thomas]] (1599) [http://www.oxford-shakespeare.com/Nashe/Nashes_Lenten_Stuff.pdf ''Praise of the Red Herring''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715030947/http://www.oxford-shakespeare.com/Nashe/Nashes_Lenten_Stuff.pdf |date=2011-07-15 }} In: William Oldys and John Malham (Eds) [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=JxOjdlsWMGcC&amp;pg=PA331&amp;lpg=PA331&amp;dq=%22on+hounds+to+a+scent%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LZlI9hToJr&amp;sig=aqRgPgjXnFakagAqVgvlw9YpOtY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3JUuT4rlGOa5iQfnoNjdDg&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22on%20hounds%20to%20a%20scent%22&amp;f=false  ''The Harleian miscellany''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230213316/https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=JxOjdlsWMGcC&amp;pg=PA331&amp;lpg=PA331&amp;dq=%22on+hounds+to+a+scent%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LZlI9hToJr&amp;sig=aqRgPgjXnFakagAqVgvlw9YpOtY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3JUuT4rlGOa5iQfnoNjdDg&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA |date=2017-12-30 }} Volume 2, Printed for R. Dutton, 1809. Page 331.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' makes no connection with Nashe's quote and the figurative meaning of red herring to distract from the intended target, only in the literal sense of a hunting practice to draw dogs towards a scent.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;

The use of herring to distract pursuing scent hounds was tested on [[MythBusters (2010 season)#Episode 148 – Hair of the Dog|Episode 148]] of the series ''[[MythBusters]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1683693|MythBusters: Season 9, Episode 1 - Hair of the Dog}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the hound used in the test stopped to eat the fish and lost the fugitive's scent temporarily, it eventually backtracked and located the target, resulting in the myth being classified by the show as "Busted".&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythbustersresults.com/hair-of-the-dog Episode 148: Hair of the Dog] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105122838/http://mythbustersresults.com/hair-of-the-dog |date=2012-11-05 }}, Mythbustersresults.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jean_Auguste_Dominique_Ingres_-_Roger_Delivering_Angelica.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], ''Roger Freeing Angelica'', 1819]]
'''''Roger Freeing Angelica''''' or '''''Ruggiero Freeing Angelica''''' is an 1819 painting by [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], inspired by ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' by [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]]. An oil painting on canvas measuring 147 x 199 cm, it is owned by the [[Louvre]]. Ingres subsequently painted several variants of the composition.

==Subject==
''Orlando Furioso'', a 16th-century epic poem by Ariosto, is the source of the tale of Roger, a knight whose steed is a [[hippogriff]] (a legendary creature half horse and half eagle). While riding near [[Brittany]]'s coast Roger espies a beautiful woman, Angelica, chained to a rock on the Isle of Tears. She has been abducted and stripped naked by barbarians who have left her there as a human sacrifice to a sea monster. As Roger rides to her aid, a great thrashing in the water occurs—it is the monster approaching Angelica. Roger drives his lance between the monster's eyes and rescues Angelica.&lt;ref&gt;Condon et al. 1983, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Jean auguste dominique ingres - angélica acorrentada 01.jpg|thumb|right|''Angelica'', 1859, [[São Paulo Museum of Art]]]]
Ingres received the commission for the work in 1817 and completed it in 1819.&lt;ref name="Arikha 1986, p. 51"&gt;Arikha 1986, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; When it was exhibited at the [[Paris Salon]] of 1819 alongside his ''[[Grande Odalisque]]'', the work was criticised for the treatment of Angelica's figure, described by the art historian [[Théophile Silvestre]] as "Angelica with [[goitre]]s" and by the painter [[Henry de Waroquier]] as "triple-breasted Angelica". Comte de Blacas, the French ambassador to the Vatican, acquired the painting for [[King Louis XVIII]].&lt;ref name="Arikha 1986, p. 51"/&gt; It was installed above a doorway in the throne room of [[Versailles]] from 1820 until 1823 before being relocated to the [[Musée du Luxembourg]].&lt;ref name="Arikha 1986, p. 51"/&gt; It  was Ingres' first painting to enter a public collection.

Ingres executed the work with his usual care, and many preparatory drawings for the composition and the individual figures exist. 

He painted several later versions of the composition, none of which are known to have been commissioned.&lt;ref name="Condon 1983 p.94"&gt;Condon et al. 1983, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; A reduced copy of the painting in a vertical format was painted sometime before 1839, and eventually acquired by [[Edgar Degas]], who purchased it in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;Dumas 1996, pp. 25, 70.&lt;/ref&gt; It was later acquired by the [[National Gallery, London]]. An 1841 replica, in an oval format, is in the [[Musée Ingres]]. A painting of 1859, also in an oval format, repeats the figure of Angelica but nearly eliminates Roger, whose presence is indicated only by his shield visible at the right edge.&lt;ref&gt;Condon et al. 1983, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1825–30 Ingres painted ''Perseus and Andromeda'' ([[Detroit Institute of Arts]]), which like ''Roger Freeing Angelica'' features a nude woman chained to a rock and a hero slaying a sea monster.&lt;ref&gt;Mongan and Naef 1967, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3806">The '''Seongnam Arts Center''' (성남아트센터) is the largest venue for cultural events in the city of [[Seongnam]]. It is in [[Yatap-dong]] in [[Bundang]], within a few minutes' walk of [[Imae Station]]. The Seongnam Arts Center was first opened on 14 October 2005 by the Seongam Cultural Foundation.

==Performing venues==
The Seongnam Arts Center is able to put on any kind of performance from [[ballet]], to [[opera]], to [[jazz]], in its three main performance areas:

*'''The Opera House''' seats 1,805 and is capable of hosting operas, [[musicals]], plays, ballets, and concerts. It is intended as a link between local and international culture.  
*'''The Concert Hall''' was acoustically designed with [[classical music]] performances in mind. This two-story facility seats 996. 
*'''The Ensemble Theatre''', seats 398, in addition to the regular stage, has a T-stage wrapping itself around the seats, allowing the performance to come closer to the audience.

==Galleries==
The arts center is also home to two galleries displaying work from both international and domestic artists. The facility is divided into 5 exhibition rooms in two separate sections of the Arts Center: 
* '''The Main Gallery''' has three exhibition rooms and is located under the Opera House.   
* '''The Annex Gallery''' has two exhibition rooms and is located on the first floor of the Ensemble Theater.

==Other facilities==
In the Opera House, on the first floor, a free [[daycare]] is available for parents while they enjoy the performance. Space is limited to about 15 children, which are supervised by two trained childcare specialists. On the next floor down, The Uptown Dinner provides casual Italian food in a comfortable atmosphere while a [[convenience store]] close by sells snacks.

The Seongnam Arts Center Art Shop is underneath the Ensemble Theater, selling works by first-class artists. By the Art Shop, flowers can be purchased in the Arts Flower Shop. There is also ample parking space, both above and below the ground.

Known as the Academy, a variety of courses are available for the public in the areas of both fine and the performing arts. Facilities such as music, ballet and art rooms are in the Concert Hall and the Ensemble Theater.

==Events==
* 2009: [[musical theatre|musical]], ''Namhansanseong'' is based on the novel of the same name by [[Kim Hoon]], which is based on the incident of Byeongjahoran, in which during the [[Second Manchu invasion of Korea]] in 1636, when [[King Injo of Joseon|King Injo]] of [[Joseon Dynasty]] took refuge in the [[Namhan Mountain Fortress]] in [[Gyeonggi-do]], in an ill-fated attempt to defy the rule of the [[Manchu]] [[Qing Empire]] [[Hong Taiji]], following the [[First Manchu invasion of Korea]] in 1627.&lt;ref&gt;Koh Young-aah [http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20090925000006 "Musicals hope for seasonal bounce"] ''Korea Herald''. 30 March 2010.

'''Slaven Tolj''' (born in 1964), a [[multimedia artist]] from [[Dubrovnik]], [[Croatia]]. He achieved international recognition for his [[installation art|installations]], [[body art]], and [[performances]] presenting distinct [[political]] and social-cultural [[criticism]]. 

The beginning of Slaven Tolj’s work, as an artist, was determined by his experiences of the [[Yugoslav War]], the [[Siege of Dubrovnik]] by the Yugoslavian army in the years 1991-1992, as well as the disintegration of [[former Yugoslavia]].
In the course of the late 1990s Slaven Tolj gradually extended the scope of his art, incorporating themes and issues related to political transformation and the emergence of [[multiculturalism]] and [[globalization]].

Slaven Tolj has also been involved in organisational and curatorial activities. He is one of the founders of [[Art Workshop Lazareti]] in Dubrovnik – a key institution for contemporary art scene in Dubrovnik and Croatia.   

In 2005 he was the commissioner of the Croatian pavilion at the [[Venice Biennale]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://artnews.org/news.php?i=3595&amp;t=news artnews.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Szpilman Award''' is an annual art prize. It is awarded to works that exist only for a moment or a short period of time. The purpose of the award is to promote such works whose forms consist of [[ephemeral]] situations.&lt;ref&gt;Nunez-Fernandez, Lupe:  [http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/blogon/2007/05/mahony_at_austrian_cultural_fo.php "Mahony at Austrian Cultural Forum"] ''Saatchi Online'', 9 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first presented in 2003 and is still the only award for ephemeral works worldwide.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}} The prize is open for the public.

==Background==

The ''Szpilman Award'' is initiated, financed and organized by German-based art group ''Szpilman''. It was founded in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Grit: Szpilman Award, ''art kaleidoscope'', page 23, January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially only people from [[Germany]] could apply. Regulations were changed in 2004 and opened the call for [[Europe]]. The public interest in the prize raised. In 2006 ''Szpilman'' abolished any restrictions: everyone from all over the world&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.szquirrel.szpilman.de/informations.html "Who participates in the Szpilman Award? "] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225213202/http://www.szquirrel.szpilman.de/informations.html |date=2008-12-25 }} ''Szpilman Award: Information'', viewed: 12 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; can apply now for the ''Szpilman Award''. The winner is chosen by a panel of up to 10 independent judges including the winner of the previous year. The prize is accompanied with a dynamic cash award (sum of money collected by members of the jury parallel to the competition, called "Jackpot Stipendium"), a trip to [[Cimochowizna]] ([[Poland]]), and a challenge cup whichwill be handed over to the next prize winner in the subsequent year.&lt;ref&gt;Vvoi:  [http://new-art.blogspot.com/2007/05/szpilman-award-carpe-diem-one-ephemeral.html "Szpilman Award: carpe diem, one ephemeral step at a time"] ''New Art'' blog, 16 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008 the ''Szpilman Award'' is also running a daily bulletin about ephemeral works, called "Potz!Blitz!Szpilman!".&lt;ref&gt;"In love with ephemeral" Sleek Magazine No.22, page 94, September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

To make ephemeral works more public and to show a greater variety of possibilities members of ''Szpilman Award'' curate exhibitions since 2006 in cities all around the world, called Szpilman Award Shows, e.g. in galleries, museums and public spaces in Austria, Germany,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mer spingkse, wat kütt.

The Sánchez de Ortigosa House is located at 60 St. George Street, [[St. Augustine, Florida]]. It is a reconstruction of a home dating from the [[History of Florida|First Spanish Period (1565-1763)]] that stood on this site. 

== History ==
The Sánchez de Ortigosa House shows up on city maps in 1763 and 1765 as being a stone building belonging to José Sánchez de Ortigosa. Sánchez de Ortigosa was from Ronda, Spain. He married a local woman, Juana Theodora Pérez, with whom he had nine children. He was a [[privateer]].

By 1788, during Florida's [[History of Florida|British Period (1763-1783)]], the stone house had been razed and a wooden house stood in its place.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guide Book: Including Descriptions of the Buildings, Crafts, and a Brief History of the Restoration of the Nation's Oldest City|last=Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board|first=|publisher=Department of Cultural Affairs, Department of State, State of Florida|year=1971|isbn=|location=Tallahassee, Florida|pages=32-33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restoration Commission Director Earle Newton stated that First Spanish Period homes did not last because the English tended to tear them down for use of the building materials and replace them with wooden structures.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/USACH00501/00001?search=sanchez+=ortigosa|title=Two Restoration Project Reconstructed Structures In Final Stages Of Building|website=ufdc.ufl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Restoration ==
The St. Augustine Historic Restoration and Preservation Commission (later the [[Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board]]) completed a reconstruction of the Sánchez de Ortigosa house in 1966. It was built as a one-story pink house on the corners of St. George Street and Cuna Street. The roof was built of tile and cement.

Additional funding for this reconstruction was donated by [[Edward Ball (businessman)|Edward Ball]] of Jacksonville.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== San Agustín Antiguo ==
During the time of the living history museum San Agustín Antiguo in St. Augustine, the Sánchez de Ortigosa house served as a First Spanish Period carpenter's shop. Antiques were repaired there and custom pieces were made for exhibition houses and for public sale.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Present Day ==
Today this site is retail space, operated by the Spanish Dutch Convoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://spanishdutchconvoy.com/about-us/|title=About Us|date=2015-02-12|work=Spanish Dutch Convoy|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is managed on behalf of the state by [[University of Florida Historic St. Augustine, Inc.|University of Florida Historic St. Augustine, Inc]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5810">'''The Great Led Zeppelin Wine Pairing''' is a series of “wine and music pairings,” created by noted restaurateur and viticulturist [[Joe Bastianich]] and writer-musician [[Mike Edison]],  along with writer and wine expert [[David Lynch (wine)|David Lynch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avclub.com/newyork/articles/led-zeppelin-wine-tasting,27655 Led Zeppelin Wine Tasting - A.V. Club]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25997634-14440,00.html Whole lotta Joe - TheAustralian]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/regional/rock_wine_6eepZtkURHTX9Pg55vlcAO Rock 'N' Wine - NewYorkPost]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/seven/03042009/entertainment/food/its_a_red_zeppelin_157977.htm It's a Red Zeppelin - NewYorkPost]&lt;/ref&gt; Bastianich and Lynch are both recipients of the [[James Beard Award.]]

The idea was formed when Bastianich and Edison were pondering how to pair the songs of [[Led Zeppelin]] with various wines.

"Our passion for wine is only rivaled by our passion for Zeppelin,” said Bastianich, and encouraged attendees to "taste with their ears and listen with their mouths."&lt;ref name="nym09"&gt;New York Metromix, March 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edison, in an interview with publishing blog Galley Cat, said, "Either you see this as a hyper-intellectual exercise in promoting the lexicon of oenology as a valid critical system while simultaneously subverting it and subjecting it to ridicule—or you think it is just some dudes who want to drink some really good wine and listen to Led Zeppelin. No matter what, it is still going be the best salon since [[Dorothy Parker]] made that crack about horticulture.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galleycat.com/ Galleycat.com], March 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Why Led Zeppelin? ==
Edison has explained that “Zep is the perfect band to pair with wine—maybe the only band. They have all the right qualities: They can be earthy and intense, or dark and mellow, or just insanely huge. They've got some very real, edgy twang, and some rich, complex textures. They embrace both the Old World and the New. I can't think of any other band that shows so much depth and development, both within individual songs and across entire records,” adding, that the wine pairings were both “freakishly sophisticated and patently absurd.”&lt;ref name="nym09"/&gt;

==History==
The first Great Led Zeppelin Wine Pairing was held at [[Becco]] restaurant in New York City on March 17, 2009,  and received excellent reviews and widespread media attention. The New York Post reported, “Guests at Tuesday night's first-ever Great Led Zeppelin Wine Tasting were an odd combo of wine fans and Zep heads but it didn't take many samplings for everyone to start feeling a whole lotta love.”&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Post]]'', March 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The menu, created by chef [[Billy Gallagher (chef)|Billy Gallagher]], featured six courses, each paired with wine and select Led Zeppelin songs, as follows:

'''~Antipasto~'''

The second Great Led Zeppelin Wine Tasting was held at City Winery in [[New York City]] and featured the Led Zeppelin Tribute band [[Six Foot Nurse]] performing live with special guest [[Scott Ian]] from the band [[Anthrax.]] More events are expected, including one in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] in May 2010. &lt;-- did this take place? --&gt;

== Quotes ==
'''Joe Bastianich:''' “I think because of the sheer complexity and the deep roots of the music—where the music comes from, and how profound it is— Led Zeppelin's music can only really be paralleled with the kind of evolution, importance and complexity of wine, as both a cultural thing as well as a beverage.”&lt;ref&gt;''New York Metromix, March 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mike Edison:''' “Back when I was in seminary school, attempting to pair [[Boones Farm]] apple wine with "[[Stairway to Heaven]]" and having disastrous results, I stumbled upon this little theory: "[[Led Zeppelin IV]]" is the record that when you're stoned and listening to it really loud you think the phone is ringing when it's really not. ’[[Black Dog (song)|Black Dog]]’ is like a fully fucking awesome motherfucker—this is when they got really heavy.”&lt;ref name="nym09" /&gt;

'''[[David Lynch (wine)|David Lynch]]''' (referring to the “Black Dog” pairing): We're bringing the thunder. We're bringing the tannin. We're bringing the viscosity. We're coming at you with guns blazing, with a [[Malbec]] from [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name="nym09" /&gt;

[[File:Frama AssSC044.JPG|14th century Venetian ''Madonna and child'' found in the '''Treasure Museum'''|thumb]]

The '''Treasure museum of the basilica of Saint Francis''' contains a collection of sacred art that is on display in two halls found on the northern side of the Cloister of Pope Sixtus IV which is part of the ''Sacro Convento'' in [[Assisi]], Italy.  The entrance is found on the second level of the renaissance cloister behind the apse of the Basilica of Saint Francis, which houses the remains of [[St. Francis of Assisi]]. Since 1986 the Museum has also displayed a collection of works donated to the Conventual Franciscan Friars by the [[Secular Franciscan]] and American art critic, [[Frederick Mason Perkins]], who died in Assisi in October 1955.

The Museum is part of the ''[[Associazione Musei Ecclesiastici Italiani]]'' (AMEI) and the network ''[[Museale Ecclesiastica Umbra]]'' (MEU).

== History ==
In 1930, three years after the return of the Basilica and the Sacred Convent to the [[friar]]s, the first exposition of the Treasure was put on display in the hall of Pope Pius XI at the western end of complex. The exhibition was designed to honor the works of the original patrimony which survived not only the ravages of time, but especially the plundering by Napoleon's troops (in 1798 nearly 390 kilograms of vestments in silver and other valuables were stolen). These works also survived the suppression of religious orders in 1866 during Italy's unification, when in any case the room in which the Treasure was kept, at the bottom of the bell tower, was already in a dilapidated state.&lt;ref&gt;[[Treasure Museum of the basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi#Bibliography|Nessi]]&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt; pp. 22-23.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

From documents found in the archives, especially from the old sacristy inventories (the first of which was taken in 1338), we can learn something about the evolution of the collection. But other sources also testify to the Treasure's development: the first biographies of St. Francis attest, for example, that in 1230 on occasion of the translation of Francis's body to the new church dedicated to him, Pope Gregory IX sent as a gift "a gold cross studded with precious stones in which is set a relic of the wood of the [[True Cross|true cross]]. And with it decorative objects, liturgical objects and other objects to be used for serving at the altar, and extremely precious and magnificent sacred vestments."&lt;ref&gt;''Leggenda dei tre compagni'', 72: ''Fonti francescane'' 1486&lt;/ref&gt;

As many other gifts amassed during these early decades, their necessary care created various difficulties and also caused the followers of St. Francis (known as "il Poverello"), to have some misgivings. So in 1253, to resolve these conflicts, Pope Innocent IV intervened with this bull "Dignum Extimamus" recognizing that the friars were permitted use of these gifts but were not their owners, just as was the case for the entire sanctuary complex as directed by the Apostolic See. At the same time, he forbid the removal of any of these objects from the Basilica. This was reaffirmed by Pope Clement X in 1703.&lt;ref&gt;With the bull ''Cum sicut dilecti filii'' of 13 December 1703 it was forbidden to remove any objects whether for liturgical use or otherwise from the church or convent.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Site ==
It's essential that the Treasure's exposition be considered within the context of the monumental complex, made up by the Basilica and the Sacred Convent, that constitutes the original location for which the Treasure was formed and for which some works were in fact specifically made. The rooms in which the Museum is found today were part of the original construction of 1228, made at the bidding of [[Pope Gregory IX]] to the community of friars. This area would certainly have been used even if for short stays by the Pope who had put the entire complex under his immediate jurisdiction.

In 1756 this area, sitting directly over the old dormitory (now known as the Sala Romanica), underwent heavy reconstruction in the Neo-gothic style, which is why it is today known as the Gothic Hall. It is precisely in this room that from 1977 the Treasure has been on view, while in the adjoining room, towards the so-called Papal Hall (the first site of the Museum), is the Sala Rossa, or Red Hall, in which since 1986 the [[F. M. Perkins]] Collection has been on display.

The current arrangement of the works dates from the year 2000 when the Museum was reopened after extensive repairs were made to the structural damage caused by the earthquake of September 1997.

== Works ==
Despite the impoverishment suffered during the course of its history, the Museum still contains works that can be admired for their great beauty and notable historical and artistic interest, allowing us only to imagine how much grander the collection was up until the end of the 18th century, when it remained in large portion intact.&lt;ref&gt;[[Treasure Museum of the basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi#Bibliography|Nessi]]&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt; p. 23.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection contains for the most part works of the so-called [[Decorative arts|minor arts]], although it does contain some sculpture and paintings. Among that which has survived from the very start of the collection, we find clear testimony of the Treasure's international character in works of French origin (like the illuminated manuscripts from Paris from the middle of the 13th century; gold and silver metalwork, among which is the magnificent reliquary of the Seamless Garment as well as the reliquary of the thorn from the Crown of Thorns in classic Parigian gothic style from the second half of the 12th century; and also an elegant Madonna and Child in ivory, also in the purest French gothic of the 14th century),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gothicivories.courtauld.ac.uk/images/ivory/18e10dbb_60172eb0.html |title=Gothic Ivories |access-date= 25 December 2011|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Flemish origin (the tapestry of Pope Sixtus IV and a few ivory carvings), and of Germanic origin (the clock donated in 1701 by the Austrian Emperor Leopold I to Fr. Vincenzo Coronelli, and a few precious metal works from Salzburg).

Gold and silver metalwork predominates: the reliquaries come in various forms and styles, and are from various places and times. Some are distinguished by their uniqueness, for example those of Saint Andrew (13th century) and Saint Ursula (14th century), decorated with gilded and engraved glass. Among the altar vessels are a number of chalices, from different epochs, of which the most celebrated is surely that of gold-plated silver and enamels made by [[Guccio di Mannaia]] and gift of [[Pope Nicholas IV]], the first Franciscan pope, who reigned from 1288-1292.

Also on display are: two rare Sicilian silk dossals from the beginning of the 13th century, works of Venetian glass (a crystal cross with miniatures from the early 14th century), and a number of painted works among which is the processional cross, painted on both sides, by the Master of the Blue Crucifix (late 13th century), and two altar panels by Tiberio di Assisi&lt;ref&gt;The altarpanel shows the Crucifixion between saints and angels. It was commissioned by the confraternity of the Disciplinati in the first decade of the 17th century for the chapel of Saint Anthony the Abbot in the Lower Church.&lt;/ref&gt; and Lo Spagna,&lt;ref&gt;The panel was commissioned in 1516 by the Third Order of Saint Francis for the chapel of Saint Catherine in the Lower Church. It was later moved to the chapel of Saint Louis, and was placed in the museum probably after being on loan for an exposition in Spoleto celebrating the 100th annivesary of the death of the artist.&lt;/ref&gt; both working at the end of the 15th and beginning of the 16th centuries. Among the textiles deserving special mention is the Florentine altar-frontal which was based on a drawing by [[Antonio del Pollaiolo]] and donated to the Basilica by Pope Sixtus IV in (perhaps?) 1478 on the occasion of the 250th anniversary of the canonization of Saint Francis.&lt;ref name="Bargioli"&gt;[[Treasure Museum of the basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi#Bibliography|Bargioli]]&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt; pp. 244-245&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Frederick Mason Perkins Collection ==
In the second half of the 20th century, the Perkins Collection, made up of 56 paintings and a sculpture spanning the 14th to the 16th century, was donated to the Museum. The collection contains, to name only a few items, a portrait of ''Saint Francis'' by [[Fra Angelico|Beato Angelico]], a ''Madonna and Child ''by [[Il Garofalo|Garofalo]], two panel paintings by [[Giovanni di Paolo]] and three by [[Pietro Lorenzetti]], a ''Saint Sebastian'' by dell’[[Ortolano]]&lt;ref name="Ortolano"&gt;Michele Danieli, Scheda 48 in: ''Natura e maniera. ''&lt;/ref&gt; and a ''Saint Christopher ''by Sassetta.

The '''visual arts''' are [[Art#Forms, genres, media, and styles|art forms]] such as [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]], [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[printmaking]], [[design]], [[craft]]s, [[photography]], [[video]], [[filmmaking]], and [[architecture]].

Current usage of the term "visual arts" includes [[fine art]] as well as the applied, decorative arts and [[craft]]s, but this was not always the case. Before the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and elsewhere at the turn of the 20th century, the term 'artist' was often restricted to a person working in the fine arts (such as painting, sculpture, or printmaking) and not the [[handicraft]], craft, or applied art media. The distinction was emphasized by artists of the Arts and Crafts Movement, who valued vernacular art forms as much as high forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwar.com/masters/movements/arts_and_crafts_movement.html Art History: Arts and Crafts Movement: (1861–1900). From World Wide Arts Resources] {{Webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091013011648/http://wwar.com/masters/movements/arts_and_crafts_movement.html |date=13 October 2009 }}. Retrieved 24 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Art school]]s made a distinction between the fine arts and the crafts, maintaining that a craftsperson could not be considered a practitioner of the arts.

The increasing tendency to privilege painting, and to a lesser degree sculpture, above other arts has been a feature of [[Western art]] as well as [[Eastern art history|East Asian]] art.  In both regions painting has been seen as relying to the highest degree on the imagination of the artist, and the furthest removed from manual labour – in [[Chinese painting]] the most highly valued styles were those of "scholar-painting", at least in theory practiced by gentleman amateurs. The Western [[hierarchy of genres]] reflected similar attitudes.

==Education and training==
{{main|Visual arts education}}
Training in the visual arts has generally been through variations of the [[apprentice]] and workshop systems.  In Europe the [[Renaissance]] movement to increase the prestige of the artist led to the [[academy]] system for training artists, and today most of the people who are pursuing a career in arts train in [[art school]]s at tertiary levels.  Visual arts have now become an elective subject in most education systems.

==Drawing==
{{Main|Drawing}}
[[Drawing]] is a means of making an [[image]], using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques. It generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface using dry media such as [[graphite]] [[pencil]]s, [[pen and ink]], [[ink]]ed [[brush]]es, wax [[color pencil]]s, [[crayon]]s, [[charcoal]]s, [[pastel]]s, and [[marker pen|markers]]. Digital tools that simulate the effects of these are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are: line drawing, [[hatching]], crosshatching, random hatching, scribbling, [[stippling]], and blending. An artist who excels in drawing is referred to as a ''draftsman'' or ''draughtsman''.

Drawing goes back at least 16,000 years to [[Paleolithic]] [[Cave painting|cave representations]] of animals such as those at [[Lascaux]] in France and [[Cave of Altamira|Altamira]] in Spain. In [[Art of ancient Egypt|ancient Egypt]], ink drawings on [[papyrus]], often depicting people, were used as models for painting or sculpture. Drawings on [[pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]], initially geometric, later developed to the human form with [[black-figure pottery]] during the 7th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dibujosparapintar.com/english_activities/drawing_course_history.html History of Drawing. From Dibujos para Pintar.] Retrieved 23 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[history of paper|paper]] becoming common in Europe by the 15th century, drawing was adopted by masters such as [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] who sometimes treated drawing as an art in its own right rather than a preparatory stage for painting or sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?vendorId=FWNE.fw..dr085000.a |title=Drawing |date=2006 |website=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314224108/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?vendorId=FWNE.fw..dr085000.a |archive-date=14 March 2009 |dead-url=yes |access-date=23 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Painting]] taken literally is the practice of applying [[pigment]] suspended in a carrier (or [[Paint#Components|medium]]) and a binding agent (a [[adhesive|glue]]) to a surface (support) such as [[paper]], [[canvas]] or a wall. However, when used in an artistic sense it means the use of this activity in combination with [[drawing]], [[composition (visual arts)|composition]], or other aesthetic considerations in order to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner. Painting is also used to express spiritual motifs and ideas; sites of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery to [[Sistine Chapel|The Sistine Chapel]] to the human body itself.

===Origins and early history===
{{Main|History of painting}}

Like drawing, painting has its documented origins in caves and on rock faces. The finest examples, believed by some to be 32,000 years old, are in the [[Chauvet Cave|Chauvet]] and [[Lascaux]] caves in southern France. In shades of red, brown, yellow and black, the paintings on the walls and ceilings are of bison, cattle, horses and deer.

Paintings of human figures can be found in the tombs of ancient Egypt. In the great temple of [[Ramses II]], [[Nefertari]], his queen, is depicted being led by [[Isis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=1320&amp;HistoryID=ab20&amp;gtrack=pthc History of Painting. From History World]. Retrieved 23 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks contributed to painting but much of their work has been lost. One of the best remaining representations are the Hellenistic [[Fayum mummy portraits]]. Another example is mosaic of the [[Battle of Issus]] at [[Pompeii]], which was probably based on a Greek painting. Greek and Roman art contributed to [[Byzantine art]] in the 4th century BC, which initiated a tradition in icon painting.

===The Renaissance===
{{Main|Italian Renaissance painting}}

Apart from the [[illuminated manuscripts]] produced by monks during the [[Middle Ages]], the next significant contribution to European art was from [[Italian Renaissance painting|Italy's renaissance painters]]. From [[Giotto]] in the 13th century to [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Raphael]] at the beginning of the 16th century, this was the richest period in [[Art of Italy|Italian art]] as the ''chiaroscuro'' techniques were used to create the illusion of 3-D space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.evansville.edu/rl29/art340/f04/renaissancepainting.html History of Renaissance Painting.

[[File:The Nightwatch by Rembrandt.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|alt=Rembrandt painting Night Watch two men striding forward with a crowd|Rembrandt: ''[[Night Watch (painting)|The Night Watch]]'']]
Painters in northern Europe too were influenced by the Italian school. [[Jan van Eyck]] from Belgium, [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] from the Netherlands and [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] from Germany are among the most successful painters of the times. They used the [[Glaze (painting technique)|glazing technique]] with oils to achieve depth and luminosity.

===Dutch masters===
{{Main|Dutch Golden Age painting}}
The 17th century witnessed the emergence of the great Dutch masters such as the versatile [[Rembrandt]] who was especially remembered for his portraits and Bible scenes, and [[Vermeer]] who specialized in interior scenes of Dutch life.

===Baroque===
{{Main|Baroque}}
The [[Baroque]] started after the Renaissance, from the late 16th century to the late 17th century. Main artists of the Baroque included [[Caravaggio]], who made heavy use of [[tenebrism]]. [[Peter Paul Rubens]] was a [[flemish]] painter who studied in Italy, worked for local churches in [[Antwerp]] and also painted a series for [[Marie de' Medici]]. [[Annibale Carracci]] took influences from the [[Sistine Chapel]] and created the genre of [[illusionistic ceiling painting]]. Much of the development that happened in the Baroque was because of the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the resulting [[Counter Reformation]]. Much of what defines the Baroque is dramatic lighting and overall visuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mutsaers |first=Inge |url=https://www.ashgate.com/pdf/SamplePages/Rethinking_the_Baroque_Intro.pdf |title=Ashgate Joins Routledge - Routledge |publisher=Ashgate.com |date= |accessdate=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impressionism===
{{Main|Impressionism}}
[[Impressionism]] began in France in the 19th century with a loose association of artists including [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] and [[Paul Cézanne]] who brought a new freely brushed style to painting, often choosing to paint realistic scenes of modern life outside rather than in the studio. This was achieved through a new expression of aesthetic features demonstrated by brush strokes and the impression of reality. They achieved intense colour vibration by using pure, unmixed colours and short brush strokes. The movement influenced art as a dynamic, moving through time and adjusting to new found techniques and perception of art. Attention to detail became less of a priority in achieving, whilst exploring a biased view of landscapes and nature to the artists eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Impressionist art &amp; paintings, What is Impressionist art?

===Post-impressionism===
{{Main|Post-Impressionism}}
Towards the end of the 19th century, several young painters took impressionism a stage further, using geometric forms and unnatural colour to depict emotions while striving for deeper symbolism. Of particular note are [[Paul Gauguin]], who was strongly influenced by Asian, African and Japanese art, [[Vincent van Gogh]], a Dutchman who moved to France where he drew on the strong sunlight of the south, and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]], remembered for his vivid paintings of night life in the Paris district of [[Montmartre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/poim/hd_poim.htm Post-Impressionism. Metropolitan Museum of Art]. Retrieved 25 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism, expressionism and cubism===
{{Main|Modern art}}
[[Edvard Munch]], a Norwegian artist, developed his symbolistic approach at the end of the 19th century, inspired by the French impressionist [[Manet]]. ''[[The Scream]]'' (1893), his most famous work, is widely interpreted as representing the universal anxiety of modern man. Partly as a result of Munch's influence, the German [[expressionism|expressionist]] movement originated in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century as artists such as [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner|Ernst Kirschner]] and [[Erich Heckel]] began to distort reality for an emotional effect.
In parallel, the style known as [[cubism]] developed in France as artists focused on the volume and space of sharp structures within a composition. [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]] were the leading proponents of the movement. Objects are broken up, analyzed, and re-assembled in an abstracted form. By the 1920s, the style had developed into surrealism with [[Salvador Dalí|Dali]] and [[René Magritte|Magritte]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/modern-art-movements.htm Modern Art Movements.

==Printmaking==
[[File:Ancientchineseinstrumentalists.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|alt=Ancient Chinese engraving of female instrumentalists|Ancient Chinese engraving of female instrumentalists]]
{{Main|Printmaking}}
[[Printmaking]] is creating, for artistic purposes, an image on a [[Matrix (printing)|matrix]] that is then transferred to a two-dimensional (flat) surface by means of ink (or another form of pigmentation). Except in the case of a [[monotype]], the same matrix can be used to produce many examples of the print.
[[File:Dürer Melancholia I.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Albrecht Dürer engraving Melancholia I from 1541 seated angel contemplating figure|Albrecht Dürer: ''[[Melancholia I]]'' (1541)]]
Historically, the major techniques (also called media) involved are [[woodcut]], [[line engraving]], [[etching]], [[lithography]], and screenprinting (serigraphy, silkscreening) but there are many others, including modern digital techniques. Normally, the print is printed on [[paper]], but other mediums range from cloth and [[vellum]] to more modern materials. Major printmaking traditions include that of Japan (''[[ukiyo-e]]'').

===European history===
{{Main|Old master print}}
Prints in the Western tradition produced before about 1830 are known as [[old master print]]s. In Europe, from around 1400 AD [[woodcut]], was used for master prints on paper by using printing techniques developed in the Byzantine and Islamic worlds. [[Michael Wolgemut]] improved German woodcut from about 1475, and [[Erhard Reuwich]], a Dutchman, was the first to use cross-hatching.  At the end of the century [[Albrecht Dürer]] brought the Western woodcut to a stage that has never been surpassed, increasing the status of the single-leaf woodcut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/prnt/hd_prnt.htm The Printed Image in the West: History and Techniques. The Metropolitan Museum of Art]. Retrieved 25 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese origin and practice===

{{Main|Woodblock printing}}
In China, the art of printmaking developed some 1,100 years ago as illustrations alongside text cut in woodblocks for printing on paper. Initially images were mainly religious but in the [[Song Dynasty]], artists began to cut landscapes. During the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] (1368–1644) and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] (1616–1911) dynasties, the technique was perfected for both religious and artistic engravings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engraving-review.com/chinese-art-engraving.html Engraving in Chinese Art.

===Development In Japan 1603–1867===

{{Main|Woodblock printing in Japan}}
Woodblock printing in Japan (Japanese: 木版画, moku hanga) is a technique best known for its use in the ukiyo-e artistic genre; however, it was also used very widely for printing books in the same period. Woodblock printing had been used in China for centuries to print books, long before the advent of movable type, but was only widely adopted in Japan surprisingly late, during the Edo period (1603–1867). Although similar to woodcut in western printmaking in some regards, moku hanga differs greatly in that water-based inks are used (as opposed to western woodcut, which uses oil-based inks), allowing for a wide range of vivid color, glazes and color transparency.

==Photography==
{{Main|Photography}}

[[Photography]] is the process of making pictures by means of the action of light. Light patterns reflected or emitted from objects are recorded onto a sensitive medium or storage chip through a timed [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]]. The process is done through mechanical [[Shutter (photography)|shutters]] or electronically timed exposure of [[photon]]s into [[chemical]] processing or [[digitizing]] devices known as [[camera]]s.

The word comes from the [[Greek words]] φως ''phos'' ("light"), and γραφις ''graphis'' ("stylus", "paintbrush") or γραφη ''graphê'', together meaning "drawing with light" or "representation by means of lines" or "drawing." Traditionally, the product of photography has been called a [[photograph]]. The term ''photo'' is an abbreviation; many people also call them ''pictures.'' In digital photography, the term ''image'' has begun to replace ''photograph.'' (The term ''image'' is traditional in geometric [[optics]].)

==Filmmaking==
{{Main| Filmmaking}}

Filmmaking is the process of making a motion-picture, from an initial conception and research, through scriptwriting, shooting and recording, animation or other special effects, editing, sound and music work and finally distribution to an audience; it refers broadly to the creation of all types of films, embracing documentary, strains of theatre and literature in film, and poetic or experimental practices, and is often used to refer to video-based processes as well

==Computer art==
{{Main|Computer art}}
&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:wiki.Picture by Drawing Machine 2.jpg|thumb|Picture produced by Drawing Machine 2]] --&gt;

Visual artists are no longer limited to [[Media (arts)|traditional art media]]. Computers have been used as an ever more common tool in the visual arts since the 1960s. Uses include the [[Image capture|capturing]] or creating of images and forms, the editing of those images and forms (including exploring multiple [[Composition (visual arts)|compositions]]) and the final [[Artistic rendering|rendering]] or [[printing]] (including [[3D printing]]).

'''Computer art''' is any in which [[computer]]s played a role in production or display. Such art can be an image, sound, [[computer animation|animation]], [[video]], [[CD-ROM]], [[DVD]], [[video game]], [[website]], [[algorithm]], [[performance]] or gallery installation. Many traditional disciplines are now integrating [[Digital data|digital]] technologies and, as a result, the lines between traditional works of art and [[new media]] works created using computers have been blurred. For instance, an artist may combine traditional [[painting]] with [[algorithmic art]] and other digital techniques. As a result, defining computer art by its end product can be difficult. Nevertheless, this type of art is beginning to appear in art museum exhibits, though it has yet to prove its legitimacy as a form unto itself and this technology is widely seen in contemporary art more as a tool rather than a form as with painting.

Computer usage has blurred the distinctions between [[illustrator]]s, [[photographer]]s, [[Image editing|photo editors]], [[3D modeling|3-D modelers]], and handicraft artists. Sophisticated rendering and editing software has led to multi-skilled image developers. [[Photographer]]s may become [[digital art]]ists. Illustrators may become [[animator]]s. Handicraft may be [[computer-aided]] or use [[computer-generated imagery]] as a template. Computer [[clip art]] usage has also made the clear distinction between visual arts and [[page layout]] less obvious due to the easy access and editing of clip art in the process of [[pagination|paginating]] a document, especially to the unskilled observer.

==Plastic arts==
{{main|Plastic arts}}

'''Plastic arts''' is a term for art forms that involve physical manipulation of a plastic medium by moulding or modeling such as sculpture or ceramics. The term has also been applied to ''all the visual (non-literary, non-musical) arts''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.ksu.edu.sa/DOC/Articles19/Article190588.doc Art Terminology at KSU]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/plastic%20arts |title=Merriam-Webster Online (entry for "plastic arts") |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Materials that can be carved or shaped, such as stone or wood, concrete or steel, have also been included in the narrower definition, since, with appropriate tools, such materials are also capable of modulation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} This use of the term "plastic" in the arts should not be confused with [[Piet Mondrian]]'s use, nor with the movement he termed, in French and English, "[[Neoplasticism]]."

===Sculpture===

Sculpture is [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Work of art|artwork]] created by shaping or combining hard or [[plastic]] material, sound, or text and or light, commonly [[Stone sculpture|stone]] (either [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or [[marble]]), [[clay]], [[metal]], [[glass]], or [[wood]]. Some sculptures are created directly by finding or [[Wikt:carving|carving]]; others are assembled, built together and [[Kiln|fired]], [[Welding|welded]], [[Molding (process)|molded]], or [[Casting|cast]]. Sculptures are often [[paint]]ed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artmuseums.harvard.edu/exhibitions/sackler/godsInColor.html Gods in Color: Painted Sculpture of Classical Antiquity 22 September 2007 Through 20 January 2008, The Arthur M. Sackler Museum] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104060402/http://www.artmuseums.harvard.edu/exhibitions/sackler/godsInColor.html |date=4 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A person who creates sculptures is called a sculptor.

Because sculpture involves the use of materials that can be moulded or modulated, it is considered one of the [[plastic arts]]. The majority of [[public art]] is sculpture. Many sculptures together in a [[garden]] setting may be referred to as a [[sculpture garden]].

Sculptors do not always make sculptures by hand. With increasing technology in the 20th century and the popularity of [[conceptual art]] over technical mastery, more sculptors turned to [[Art fabrication|art fabricators]] to produce their artworks. With fabrication, the artist creates a design and pays a fabricator to produce it. This allows sculptors to create larger and more complex sculptures out of material like cement, metal and plastic, that they would not be able to create by hand. Sculptures can also be made with [[3-d printing]] technology.
