[[File:Vesalius-copy.jpg|thumb|One of the large, detailed illustrations in [[Andreas Vesalius]]'s ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' 16th century, marking the rebirth of anatomy|245x245px]]
'''Anatomy''' (Greek anatomē, "dissection") is the branch of [[biology]] concerned with the study of the structure of organisms and their parts.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam Webster Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Anatomy is a branch of natural science which deals with the structural organization of living things. It is an old science, having its beginnings in prehistoric times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.booktionary.com.ng/index_files/Page1935.htm|title=Anatomy|last=Rotimi|first=Booktionary|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anatomy is inherently tied to [[developmental biology]], [[embryology]], [[comparative anatomy]], [[evolutionary biology]], and [[phylogeny]],&lt;ref name="intro HGray"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bartleby.com/107/1.html| title= Introduction page, "Anatomy of the Human Body". Henry Gray. 20th edition. 1918| accessdate =19 March 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070316005206/http://www.bartleby.com/107/1.html| archivedate= 16 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; as these are the processes by which anatomy is generated over immediate (embryology) and long (evolution) timescales. Anatomy and [[physiology]], which study (respectively) the structure and [[function (biology)|function]] of organisms and their parts, make a natural pair of [[multidisciplinary approach|related disciplines]], and they are often studied together. [[Human body|Human anatomy]] is one of the essential [[basic sciences]] that are [[Applied science|applied]] in [[medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;Arráez-Aybar et al. (2010). Relevance of human anatomy in daily clinical practice. Annals of Anatomy-Anatomischer Anzeiger, 192(6), 341–348.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline of anatomy is divided into [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] and [[microscopic scale|microscopic anatomy]]. Macroscopic anatomy, or [[gross anatomy]], is the examination of an animal's body parts using unaided [[eyesight]]. Gross anatomy also includes the branch of [[superficial anatomy]]. Microscopic anatomy involves the use of optical instruments in the study of the [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] of various structures, known as [[histology]], and also in the study of [[cell biology|cells]].

The [[history of anatomy]] is characterized by a progressive understanding of the functions of the [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] and structures of the [[human body]]. Methods have also improved dramatically, advancing from the examination of animals by dissection of carcasses and [[cadaver]]s (corpses) to 20th century [[medical imaging]] techniques including [[Radiography|X-ray]], [[Ultrasound imaging|ultrasound]], and [[MRI|magnetic resonance imaging]].

Derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀνατομή}} ''anatomē'' "dissection" (from {{lang|grc|ἀνατέμνω}} ''anatémnō'' "I cut up, cut open" from ἀνά ''aná'' "up", and τέμνω ''témnō'' "I cut"),&lt;ref&gt;O.D.E. 2nd edition 2005&lt;/ref&gt; anatomy is the scientific study of the structure of [[organism]]s including their systems, organs and [[tissue (biology)|tissues]]. It includes the appearance and position of the various parts, the materials from which they are composed, their locations and their relationships with other parts. Anatomy is quite distinct from [[physiology]] and [[biochemistry]], which deal respectively with the functions of those parts and the chemical processes involved. For example, an anatomist is concerned with the shape, size, position, structure, blood supply and innervation of an organ such as the liver; while a physiologist is interested in the production of [[bile]], the role of the liver in nutrition and the regulation of bodily functions.&lt;ref name=Everyman&gt;{{cite book |title=Everyman's Encyclopedia: Anatomy |editor-last=Bozman |editor-first=E. F.|year=1967 |publisher=J. M. Dent &amp; Sons |asin=B0066E44EC |page=272 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline of anatomy can be subdivided into a number of branches including gross or [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] anatomy and [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]] anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/microscopic+anatomy |title=Anatomy |year=2007 |work=The Free Dictionary |publisher=Farlex |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gross anatomy]] is the study of structures large enough to be seen with the naked eye, and also includes [[superficial anatomy]] or surface anatomy, the study by sight of the external body features. [[Microscopic anatomy]] is the study of structures on a microscopic scale, along with [[histology]] (the study of tissues), and [[embryology]] (the study of an organism in its immature condition).&lt;ref name="intro HGray" /&gt;

Anatomy can be studied using both invasive and non-invasive methods with the goal of obtaining information about the structure and organization of organs and systems.&lt;ref name="intro HGray" /&gt; Methods used include [[dissection]], in which a body is opened and its organs studied, and [[endoscopy]], in which a [[video camera]]-equipped instrument is inserted through a small incision in the body wall and used to explore the internal organs and other structures. [[Angiography]] using [[X-ray]]s or [[magnetic resonance angiography]] are methods to visualize blood vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Use of Angiography to Outline the Cardiovascular Anatomy of the Sand Crab Portunus pelagicus Linnaeus |vauthors=Gribble N, Reynolds K | journal=Journal of Crustacean Biology | year=1993 | volume=13 | issue=4 | pages=627–637 | doi=10.1163/193724093x00192 | jstor=1549093}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Characterization of the Renal Portal System of the Common Green Iguana (Iguana iguana) by Digital Subtraction Imaging |vauthors=Benson KG, Forrest L | journal=Journal of Zoo and Wildlife Medicine | year=1999 | volume=30 | issue=2 | pages=235–241|pmid=10484138 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/test_procedures/cardiovascular/magnetic_resonance_angiography_mra_135,14/ |title=Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) |publisher=Johns Hopkins Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/angiography/Pages/Introduction.aspx | title=Angiography | publisher=National Health Service | accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "anatomy" is commonly taken to refer to [[human anatomy]]. However, substantially the same structures and tissues are found throughout the rest of the animal kingdom and the term also includes the anatomy of other animals. The term ''zootomy'' is also sometimes used to specifically refer to non-human animals. The structure and tissues of plants are of a dissimilar nature and they are studied in [[plant anatomy]].&lt;ref name=Everyman/&gt;

== Animal tissues ==
[[File:Anima cell notext.svg|right|thumb|Stylized cutaway diagram of an animal cell (with flagella)]]
The [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] [[Animalia]] contains [[multicellular organism]]s that are [[heterotroph]]ic and [[Motility|motile]] (although some have secondarily adopted a [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] lifestyle). Most animals have bodies differentiated into separate [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and these animals are also known as [[eumetazoa]]ns. They have an internal [[digestion|digestive]] chamber, with one or two openings; the [[gamete]]s are produced in multicellular sex organs, and the [[zygote]]s include a [[blastula]] stage in their [[Embryogenesis|embryonic development]]. Metazoans do not include the [[sponge]]s, which have undifferentiated cells.&lt;ref name=Dorit549&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=547–549 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[plant cell]]s, [[animal cells]] have neither a cell wall nor [[chloroplast]]s. Vacuoles, when present, are more in number and much smaller than those in the plant cell. The body tissues are composed of numerous types of cell, including those found in [[muscle]]s, [[nerve]]s and [[skin]]. Each typically has a cell membrane formed of [[phospholipid]]s, [[cytoplasm]] and a [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]].  All of the different cells of an animal are derived from the embryonic [[germ layer]]s. Those simpler invertebrates which are formed from two germ layers of ectoderm and endoderm are called [[diploblasty|diploblastic]] and the more developed animals whose structures and organs are formed from three germ layers are called [[triploblasty|triploblastic]].&lt;ref name=Ruppert60&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=81-315-0104-3 |pages=59–60 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All of a triploblastic animal's tissues and organs are derived from the three germ layers of the embryo, the [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]] and [[endoderm]].

Animal tissues can be grouped into four basic types: [[connective tissue|connective]], [[epithelium|epithelial]], [[muscle tissue|muscle]] and [[nervous tissue]].
[[File:Cartilage polarised.jpg|thumb|Hyaline cartilage at high magnification ([[H&amp;E stain]])]]

===Connective tissue===
[[Connective tissue]]s are fibrous and made up of cells scattered among inorganic material called the [[extracellular matrix]]. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. The main types are loose connective tissue, [[adipose tissue]], fibrous connective tissue, [[cartilage]] and [[bone]]. The extracellular matrix contains [[protein]]s, the chief and most abundant of which is [[collagen]]. Collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues. The matrix can be modified to form a [[skeleton]] to support or protect the body. An [[exoskeleton]] is a thickened, rigid [[cuticle]] which is stiffened by [[mineralisation (biology)|mineralization]], as in [[crustacean]]s or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in [[insect]]s. An [[endoskeleton]] is internal and present in all developed animals, as well as in many of those less developed.&lt;ref name="Ruppert60" /&gt;

===Epithelium===
[[File:Normal gastric mucosa low mag.jpg|thumb|right|Gastric mucosa at low magnification ([[H&amp;E stain]])]]
[[Epithelial tissue]] is composed of closely packed cells, bound to each other by [[cell adhesion molecule]]s, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be [[Squamous epithelial cell|squamous]] (flat), [[Simple cuboidal epithelium|cuboidal]] or [[Columnar epithelial cell|columnar]] and rest on a [[basal lamina]], the upper layer of the [[basement membrane]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dorland's|title=Illustrated Medical Dictionary|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|isbn=978-1-4160-6257-8|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dorland's|title=Illustrated Medical Dictionary|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|isbn=978-1-4160-6257-8|page=1002}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different types of epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the [[respiratory tract]] there is a type of [[pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium|ciliated]] epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are [[Microvillus|microvilli]] on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are [[Intestinal villus|intestinal villi]]. [[Skin]] consists of an outer layer of [[keratin]]ized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. [[Keratinocyte]]s make up to 95% of the cells in the [[epidermis (skin)|skin]].&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, J.A.; Eady, R.A.; Pope, F.M. (2004). Rook's Textbook of Dermatology (7th ed.). Blackwell Publishing. pp. 3.1–3.6. {{ISBN|978-0-632-06429-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix in the form of a [[cuticle]]. In simple animals this may just be a coat of [[glycoproteins]].&lt;ref name="Ruppert60" /&gt; In more advanced animals, many [[gland]]s are formed of epithelial cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/kabernd/BerndCV/Lab/EpithelialInfoWeb/Glandular%20Epithelium.html |title=Glandular epithelium |author=Bernt, Karen |year=2010 |work=Epithelial Cells |publisher=Davidson College |accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muscle tissue===
[[File:Skeletal muscle - cross section, nerve bundle.jpg|right|thumb|Cross section through [[skeletal muscle]] and a small [[nerve]] at high magnification ([[H&amp;E stain]])]]
[[Myocyte|Muscle cells]] (myocytes) form the active contractile tissue of the body. [[Muscle tissue]] functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle is formed of contractile [[Myofibril|filaments]] and is separated into three main types; [[Smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscle]], [[Skeletal striated muscle|skeletal muscle]] and [[cardiac muscle]]. Smooth muscle has no [[Striated muscle tissue|striations]] when examined microscopically. It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility over a wide range of stretch lengths. It is found in such organs as [[sea anemone]] tentacles and the body wall of [[sea cucumber]]s. Skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension. It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws. Obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two. The filaments are staggered and this is the type of muscle found in [[earthworm]]s that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions.&lt;ref name=Ruppert103&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=81-315-0104-3 |page=103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of the [[uterus]], [[bladder]], [[intestines]], [[stomach]], o[[esophagus]], [[respiratory airways]], and [[blood vessel]]s. [[Cardiac muscle]] is found only in the [[heart]], allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body.

===Nervous tissue===
[[Nervous tissue]] is composed of many nerve cells known as [[neuron]]s which transmit information. In some slow-moving [[Symmetry in biology#Radial symmetry|radially symmetrical]] marine animals such as [[ctenophore]]s and [[cnidarian]]s (including [[sea anemone]]s and [[jellyfish]]), the nerves form a [[nerve net]], but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles. In simple animals, receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus. In more complex animals, specialized receptor cells such as [[chemoreceptor]]s and [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] are found in groups and send messages along [[biological neural network|neural networks]] to other parts of the organism. Neurons can be connected together in [[Ganglion|ganglia]].&lt;ref name=Ruppert104&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=81-315-0104-3 |page=104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In higher animals, specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs and there is a [[central nervous system]] (brain and spinal cord) and a [[peripheral nervous system]]. The latter consists of [[Sensory neuron|sensory nerves]] that transmit information from sense organs and [[Motor neuron|motor nerves]] that influence target organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Grey's Anatomy: Descriptive and Applied |year=1944 |edition=28 |page=1038 |publisher=Langmans |editor1-last=Johnston | editor1-first= T.B |editor2-last=Whillis | editor2-first=J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ruppert107&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=81-315-0104-3 |pages=105–107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The peripheral nervous system is divided into the [[somatic nervous system]] which conveys sensation and controls [[voluntary muscle]], and the [[autonomic nervous system]] which involuntarily controls [[smooth muscle]], certain glands and internal organs, including the [[stomach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.inkling.com/read/essential-clinical-anatomy-keith-moore-4th/introduction-to-clinical-anatomy/nervous-system | title=Essesntial Clinical Anatomy | publisher=Inkling | work=Nervous System | date=2010 |edition=4th | accessdate=30 April 2014 |author1=Moore, K. |author2=Agur, A. |author3=Dalley, A. F. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vertebrate anatomy ==
{{see also|Comparative anatomy}}
[[File:VolRenderShearWarp.gif|thumb|upright|[[Mouse]] skull]]
All [[vertebrate]]s have a similar basic [[body plan]] and at some point in their lives, mostly in the [[embryogenesis|embryonic]] stage, share the major [[chordate]] characteristics; a stiffening rod, the [[notochord]]; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the [[neural tube]]; [[pharyngeal arch]]es; and a tail posterior to the anus. The [[spinal cord]] is protected by the [[vertebral column]] and is above the notochord and the [[Gut (anatomy)|gastrointestinal tract]] is below it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Waggoner |first=Ben |title=Vertebrates: More on Morphology |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vertebrates/vertmm.html |publisher=UCMP |accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nervous tissue is derived from the [[ectoderm]], connective tissues are derived from [[mesoderm]], and gut is derived from the [[endoderm]]. At the posterior end is a [[tail]] which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the [[anus]] at the base of the tail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Vertebrate Body |last=Romer |first=Alfred Sherwood |year=1985 |publisher=Holt Rinehart &amp; Winston |isbn=978-0-03-058446-6 |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the [[vertebral column]], formed in the development of the segmented series of [[vertebra]]e. In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the [[nucleus pulposus]] of the [[intervertebral disc]]s. However, a few vertebrates, such as the [[sturgeon]] and the [[coelacanth]] retain the notochord into adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Functional anatomy of the vertebrates: an evolutionary perspective|year=2001|publisher=Harcourt College Publishers|isbn=978-0-03-022369-3|author=Liem, Karel F.|author2=Warren Franklin Walker|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gnathostomata|Jawed vertebrates]] are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor. This is one of the arguments put forward by [[Charles Darwin]] to support his theory of [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/evolution/science/what-is-homology |title=What is Homology? |date=17 October 2008 |publisher=National Center for Science Education |accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fish anatomy ===
{{main|Fish anatomy}}
[[File:Internal anatomy of a fish (cutaway diagram).jpg|thumb|left|Cutaway diagram showing various organs of a fish]]
The body of a fish is divided into a head, trunk and tail, although the divisions between the three are not always externally visible. The skeleton, which forms the support structure inside the fish, is either made of cartilage, in [[cartilaginous fish]], or bone in [[bony fish]]. The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, composed of articulating [[vertebra]]e which are lightweight yet strong. The ribs attach to the spine and there are no [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] or limb girdles. The main external features of the fish, the [[fish fin|fins]], are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays, which with the exception of the [[caudal fin]]s, have no direct connection with the spine. They are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk.&lt;ref name=Dorit818/&gt; The heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the [[gill]]s and on round the body in a single circulatory loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C003758/Development/fish.htm |title=The fish heart |work=ThinkQuest |publisher=Oracle |accessdate=27 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428001536/http://library.thinkquest.org/C003758/Development/fish.htm |archivedate=28 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision. There is an inner ear but no external or [[middle ear]]. Low frequency vibrations are detected by the [[lateral line]] system of sense organs that run along the length of the sides of fish, and these respond to nearby movements and to changes in water pressure.&lt;ref name=Dorit818&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=816–818 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharks and rays are [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] fish with numerous [[Primitive (phylogenetics)|primitive]] anatomical features similar to those of ancient fish, including skeletons composed of cartilage. Their bodies tend to be dorso-ventrally flattened, they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set on the underside of the head. The dermis is covered with separate dermal [[Fish scale#Placoid scales|placoid scales]]. They have a [[cloaca]] into which the urinary and genital passages open, but not a [[swim bladder]]. Cartilaginous fish produce a small number of large, [[Egg yolk|yolky]] eggs. Some species are [[ovoviviparous]] and the young develop internally but others are [[oviparous]] and the larvae develop externally in egg cases.&lt;ref name=Kotpal&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Text Book of Zoology: Vertebrates |last=Kotpal |first=R. L. |year=2010 |publisher=Rastogi Publications |isbn=978-81-7133-891-7 |page=193 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U7N1j-8LMsEC&amp;pg=PA199 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bony fish lineage shows more [[Derived trait|derived]] anatomical traits, often with major evolutionary changes from the features of ancient fish. They have a bony skeleton, are generally laterally flattened, have five pairs of gills protected by an [[operculum (fish)|operculum]], and a mouth at or near the tip of the snout. The dermis is covered with overlapping [[Fish scale|scales]]. Bony fish have a swim bladder which helps them maintain a constant depth in the water column, but not a cloaca. They mostly [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] a large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the water column.&lt;ref name=Kotpal/&gt;

[[File:Frog anatomy tags.PNG|thumb|upright|Plastic model of a frog]]
[[Amphibian]]s are a [[Class (biology)|class]] of animals comprising [[frog]]s, [[salamander]]s and [[caecilian]]s. They are [[tetrapod]]s, but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other and have [[articular processes]]. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little [[keratin]] and lacks scales, but contains many [[mucous gland]]s and in some species, poison glands. The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two [[atrium (heart)|atria]] and one [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]. They have a [[urinary bladder]] and [[metabolic waste#nitrogen wastes|nitrogenous waste products]] are excreted primarily as [[urea]]. Amphibians breathe by means of [[buccal pumping]], a pump action in which air is first drawn into the [[Buccopharyngeal membrane|buccopharyngeal]] region through the nostrils.

In frogs the pelvic girdle is robust and the hind legs are much longer and stronger than the forelimbs. The feet have four or five digits and the toes are often webbed for swimming or have suction pads for climbing. Frogs have large eyes and no tail. Salamanders resemble lizards in appearance; their short legs project sideways, the belly is close to or in contact with the ground and they have a long tail. Caecilians superficially resemble [[earthworm]]s and are limbless. They burrow by means of zones of muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim by undulating their body from side to side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Natural History of Amphibians |last1=Stebbins |first1=Robert C. |authorlink1=Robert C.

=== Reptile anatomy ===
{{main|Reptile anatomy}}
[[File:Crotalus atrox -Museum of Osteology, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA-29Aug2012.jpg|thumb|left|Skeleton of a [[diamondback rattlesnake]]]]
'''[[Reptile]]s''' are a class of animals comprising [[turtle]]s, [[tuatara]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[snake]]s and [[crocodile]]s. They are [[tetrapod]]s, but the snakes and a few species of [[lizard]] either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their [[lung]]s by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a [[Sex organ|copulatory organ]] present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by [[Amniote|amniotic membranes]] which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or [[Ovoviviparity|develop internally]] in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as [[uric acid]].&lt;ref name=Dorit865&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=861–865 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Turtles''' are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny [[carapace]] above and a [[plastron]] below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.&lt;ref name=Dorit868&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=865–868 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tuataras''' superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the [[Triassic]] period. There is one living species, ''[[Sphenodon punctatus]]''. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw and eventually wear down. The brain and heart are more primitive than those of other reptiles, and the lungs have a single chamber and lack [[Bronchus|bronchi]]. The tuatara has a well-developed [[parietal eye]] on its forehead.&lt;ref name=Dorit868/&gt;

'''Lizards''' have skulls with only one [[Skull#Fenestrae|fenestra]] on each side, the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost. This results in the jaws being less rigidly attached which allows the mouth to open wider. Lizards are mostly quadrupeds, with the trunk held off the ground by short, sideways-facing legs, but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes. Lizards have moveable eyelids, eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye.&lt;ref name=Dorit868/&gt;

'''Snakes''' are closely related to lizards, having branched off from a common ancestral lineage during the [[Cretaceous]] period, and they share many of the same features. The skeleton consists of a skull, a hyoid bone, spine and ribs though a few species retain a vestige of the pelvis and rear limbs in the form of [[pelvic spur]]s. The bar under the second fenestra has also been lost and the jaws have extreme flexibility allowing the snake to swallow its prey whole. Snakes lack moveable eyelids, the eyes being covered by transparent "spectacle" scales. They do not have eardrums but can detect ground vibrations through the bones of their skull. Their forked tongues are used as organs of taste and smell and some species have sensory pits on their heads enabling them to locate warm-blooded prey.&lt;ref name=Dorit870&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |page=870 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crocodilians''' are large, low-slung aquatic reptiles with long snouts and large numbers of teeth. The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed. It undulates from side to side to force the animal through the water when swimming. The tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull. The nostrils, eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above the surface of the water when the animal is floating. Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.&lt;ref name=Dorit874&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |page=874 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bird anatomy ===
{{main|Bird anatomy}}
[[File:Duerer wing of a blue roller.jpg|thumb|Part of a wing. [[Albrecht Dürer]], c.&amp;nbsp;1500–1512]]
Birds are [[tetrapod]]s but though their hind limbs are used for walking or hopping, their front limbs are [[wing]]s covered with [[feather]]s and adapted for flight. Birds are [[endotherm]]ic, have a high [[metabolic rate]], a light [[Skeleton|skeletal system]] and powerful [[muscle]]s. The long bones are thin, hollow and very light. Air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones. The sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused. There are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn-covered beak. The eyes are relatively large, particularly in nocturnal species such as owls. They face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks.&lt;ref name=Dorit895&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=881–895 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feathers are outgrowths of the [[epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]] and are found in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin. Large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail, contour feathers cover the bird's surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds. The only cutaneous gland is the single [[uropygial gland]] near the base of the tail. This produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird [[personal grooming|preens]]. There are scales on the legs, feet and claws on the tips of the toes.&lt;ref name=Dorit895/&gt;

=== Mammal anatomy ===
{{Main|Mammal anatomy}}
[[Mammal]]s are a diverse class of animals, mostly terrestrial but some are aquatic and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight. They mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings. The legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk, which is held well clear of the ground. The bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth, which are usually differentiated, are coated in a layer of [[Tooth enamel|prismatic enamel]]. The teeth are shed once ([[Deciduous teeth|milk teeth]]) during the animal's lifetime or not at all, as is the case in [[cetacea]]ns. Mammals have three bones in the middle ear and a [[cochlea]] in the [[inner ear]]. They are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete [[sweat gland|sweat]]. Some of these glands are specialized as [[mammary gland]]s, producing milk to feed the young. Mammals breathe with [[lung]]s and have a muscular [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs. The mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate. Nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea.&lt;ref name=Dorit914&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=909–914 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mammals are [[amniote]]s, and most are [[Viviparity|viviparous]], giving birth to live young. The exception to this are the egg-laying [[monotreme]]s, the [[platypus]] and the [[echidna]]s of Australia. Most other mammals have a [[placenta]] through which the developing [[foetus]] obtains nourishment, but in [[marsupial]]s, the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mother's [[Pouch (marsupial)|pouch]] where it latches on to a [[nipple]] and completes its development.&lt;ref name=Dorit914/&gt;

Humans have the overall body plan of a mammal. Humans have a [[human head|head]], [[neck]], [[Trunk (anatomy)|trunk]] (which includes the [[thorax]] and [[abdomen]]), two [[arm]]s and [[hand]]s, and two [[human leg|legs]] and [[foot|feet]].

Generally, students of certain [[biology|biological sciences]], [[paramedic]]s, prosthetists and orthotists, [[physical therapy|physiotherapists]], [[occupational therapy|occupational therapists]], [[nursing|nurses]], [[podiatry|podiatrists]], and [[medical school|medical students]] learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models, skeletons, textbooks, diagrams, photographs, lectures and tutorials, and in addition, medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of [[dissection]] and inspection of [[cadaver]]s. The study of microscopic anatomy (or [[histology]]) can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations (or slides) under a [[microscope]].

Academic anatomists are usually employed by universities, medical schools or teaching hospitals. They are often involved in teaching anatomy, and research into certain systems, organs, tissues or cells.&lt;ref name=AAA/&gt;

== Invertebrate anatomy ==
[[File:Chirocephalus diaphanus male head.png|thumb|Head of a male ''[[Daphnia]]'', a [[planktonic]] crustacean]]
[[Invertebrate]]s constitute a vast array of living organisms ranging from the simplest unicellular [[eukaryote]]s such as ''[[Paramecium]]'' to such complex multicellular animals as the [[octopus]], [[lobster]] and [[dragonfly]]. They constitute about 95% of the animal species. By definition, none of these creatures has a backbone. The cells of single-cell [[protozoa]]ns have the same basic structure as those of multicellular animals but some parts are specialized into the equivalent of tissues and organs. Locomotion is often provided by [[Cilium|cilia]] or [[Flagellum|flagella]] or may proceed via the advance of [[pseudopodia]], food may be gathered by [[phagocytosis]], energy needs may be supplied by [[photosynthesis]] and the cell may be supported by an [[endoskeleton]] or an [[exoskeleton]]. Some protozoans can form multicellular colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=81-315-0104-3 |pages=23–24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Metazoa]]ns are multicellular organism, different groups of cells of which have separate functions. The most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue, both of which are present in nearly all invertebrates. The outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an [[extracellular matrix]] which provides support to the organism. An endoskeleton derived from the [[mesoderm]] is present in [[echinoderm]]s, [[sponge]]s and some [[cephalopod]]s. [[Exoskeleton]]s are derived from the epidermis and is composed of [[chitin]] in [[arthropod]]s (insects, spiders, ticks, shrimps, crabs, lobsters). [[Calcium carbonate]] constitutes the shells of [[Mollusca|molluscs]], [[brachiopod]]s and some tube-building [[Polychaete|polychaete worms]] and [[silica]] forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic [[diatom]]s and [[radiolaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/198292/exoskeleton |title=Exoskeleton |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other invertebrates may have no rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete a variety of surface coatings such as the [[pinacoderm]] of sponges, the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians ([[polyp]]s, [[sea anemone]]s, [[jellyfish]]) and the [[collagen]]ous cuticle of [[annelid]]s. The outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells, gland cells and stinging cells. There may also be protrusions such as [[Microvillus|microvilli]], cilia, bristles, [[Spine (zoology)|spines]] and [[tubercle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/289723/integument |title=Integument |author= Ebling, F.

[[Marcello Malpighi]], the father of microscopical anatomy, discovered that plants had tubules similar to those he saw in insects like the silk worm. He observed that when a ring-like portion of bark was removed on a trunk a swelling occurred in the tissues above the ring, and he unmistakably interpreted this as growth stimulated by food coming down from the leaves, and being captured above the ring.&lt;ref name="ArberAgnes"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Arber, Agnes|title= Nehemiah Grew (1641–1712) and Marcello Malpighi (1628–1694): an essay in comparison|journal= Isis |volume =34|issue=1| pages =7–16|jstor=225992|doi=10.1086/347742|year= 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthropod]]s comprise the largest phylum in the animal kingdom with over a million known invertebrate species.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica Concise Encyclopaedia 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Insect]]s possess [[segmentation (biology)|segmented]] bodies supported by a hard-jointed outer covering, the [[exoskeleton]], made mostly of chitin. The segments of the body are organized into three distinct parts, a head, a [[Thorax (insect anatomy)|thorax]] and an [[abdomen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=O.

[[Spider]]s a class of [[arachnid]]s have four pairs of legs; a body of two segments—a [[cephalothorax]] and an [[abdomen]]. Spiders have no wings and no antennae. They have mouthparts called [[chelicerae]] which are often connected to venom glands as most spiders are venomous. They have a second pair of appendages called [[pedipalp]]s attached to the cephalothorax. These have similar segmentation to the legs and function as taste and smell organs. At the end of each male pedipalp is a spoon-shaped cymbium that acts to support the [[palpal bulb|copulatory organ]].

In 1600 BCE, the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]], an [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|Ancient Egyptian]] [[Medical manual|medical text]], described the [[heart]], its vessels, [[liver]], [[spleen]], [[kidneys]], [[hypothalamus]], [[uterus]] and [[Urinary bladder|bladder]], and showed the [[blood vessel]]s diverging from the heart.

Ancient Greek anatomy and physiology underwent great changes and advances throughout the early medieval world.  Over time, this medical practice expanded by a continually developing understanding of the functions of organs and structures in the body. Phenomenal anatomical observations of the human body were made, which have contributed towards the understanding of the brain, eye, liver, reproductive organs and the nervous system.

The [[Hellenistic Egypt]]ian city of [[Alexandria]] was the stepping-stone for Greek anatomy and physiology. Alexandria not only housed the biggest library for medical records and books of the liberal arts in the world during the time of the Greeks, but was also home to many medical practitioners and philosophers. Great patronage of the arts and sciences from the [[Ptolemy]] rulers helped raise Alexandria up, further rivalling the cultural and scientific achievements of other Greek states.&lt;ref name=Longrigg&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Longrigg|first1=James|title=Anatomy in Alexandria in the Third Century B.C|journal=The British Journal for the History of Science|date=December 1988|volume=21|issue=4|pages=455–488|jstor=4026964|doi=10.1017/s000708740002536x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It describes the body in the order followed in Mondino's dissections, starting with the abdomen, then the thorax, then the head and limbs. It was the standard anatomy textbook for the next century.&lt;ref name=Boas/&gt;

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) was trained in anatomy by [[Andrea del Verrocchio]].&lt;ref name=Boas/&gt; He made use of his anatomical knowledge in his artwork, making many sketches of skeletal structures, muscles and organs of humans and other vertebrates that he dissected.&lt;ref name=Boas/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Mason | first=Stephen F. | title=A History of the Sciences | publisher=Collier | year=1962 | location = New York | page=550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andreas Vesalius]] (1514–1564) (Latinized from Andries van Wezel), professor of anatomy at the [[University of Padua]], is considered the founder of modern human anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/new_material_from/ | title=Warwick honorary professor explores new material from founder of modern human anatomy | work=Press release | publisher= University of Warwick | accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally from [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], Vesalius published the influential book ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' ("the structure of the human body"), a large format book in seven volumes, in 1543.&lt;ref&gt;Vesalius, Andreas.

In the United States, medical schools began to be set up towards the end of the 18th century. Classes in anatomy needed a continual stream of cadavers for dissection and these were difficult to obtain. Philadelphia, Baltimore and New York were all renowned for [[body snatching]] activity as criminals raided graveyards at night, removing newly buried corpses from their coffins.&lt;ref name=trafficdead&gt;{{cite book |author=Sappol, Michael |title=A traffic of dead bodies: anatomy and embodied social identity in nineteenth-century America |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J. |year=2002 |isbn=0-691-05925-X |url=https://books.google.com/books/princeton?id=-9cKRzEx6ywC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+Traffic+of+Dead+Bodies}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar problem existed in Britain where demand for bodies became so great that grave-raiding and even [[anatomy murder]] were practised to obtain cadavers.&lt;ref name="Rosner, Lisa. 2010"&gt;Rosner, Lisa. 2010.

The teaching of anatomy in Britain was transformed by Sir [[John Struthers (anatomist)|John Struthers]], [[Regius Professor of Anatomy (Aberdeen)|Regius Professor of Anatomy]] at the [[University of Aberdeen]] from 1863 to 1889. He was responsible for setting up the system of three years of "pre-clinical" academic teaching in the sciences underlying medicine, including especially anatomy. This system lasted until the reform of medical training in 1993 and 2003. As well as teaching, he collected many vertebrate skeletons for his museum of [[comparative anatomy]], published over 70 research papers, and became famous for his public dissection of the [[Tay Whale]].&lt;ref name=pmid1717373426&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Waterston SW, Laing MR, Hutchison JD | title = Nineteenth century medical education for tomorrow's doctors | journal = Scottish Medical Journal | volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–49 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17373426 | doi=10.1258/rsmsmj.52.1.45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15712576"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Waterston SW, Hutchison JD | title = Sir John Struthers MD FRCS Edin LLD Glasg: Anatomist, zoologist and pioneer in medical education | journal = The Surgeon : Journal of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Ireland | volume = 2 | issue = 6 | pages = 347–351 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15712576 | doi=10.1016/s1479-666x(04)80035-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1822 the Royal College of Surgeons regulated the teaching of anatomy in medical schools.&lt;ref name="McLachlan, J. 2006. p.243-53"&gt;McLachlan, J. &amp; Patten, D. 2006.

Before the modern medical era, the main means for studying the internal structures of the body were [[dissection]] of the dead and [[inspection]], [[palpation]] and [[auscultation]] of the living. It was the advent of [[microscopy]] that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues. Technical advances in the development of [[achromatic lens]]es increased the [[Angular resolution|resolving power]] of the microscope and around 1839, [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann]] identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things. Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the [[microtome]] was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine. Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue. Advances in the fields of [[histology]] and [[Cell biology|cytology]] began in the late 19th century&lt;ref name=BritMicro&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/22980/anatomy/283/Microscopic-anatomy |title=Microscopic anatomy |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of [[biopsy]] specimens. The invention of the [[electron microscope]] brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the [[ultrastructure]] of cells and the [[organelle]]s and other structures within them. About the same time, in the 1950s, the use of [[X-ray diffraction]] for studying the crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of [[molecular anatomy]].&lt;ref name=BritMicro/&gt;
[[File:Acta Eruditorum - III medicina, 1691 – BEIC 13350590.jpg|thumb|Illustration from [[Acta Eruditorum]], 1691]]
Equally important advances have occurred in  ''non-invasive'' techniques for examining the interior structures of the body. [[X-ray]]s can be passed through the body and used in medical [[radiography]] and [[fluoroscopy]] to differentiate interior structures that have varying degrees of opaqueness. [[Magnetic resonance imaging]], [[X-ray computed tomography|computed tomography]], and [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound imaging]] have all enabled examination of internal structures in unprecedented detail to a degree far beyond the imagination of earlier generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mhhe.com/biosci/ap/foxhumphys/student/olc/h-reading1.html | title=Anatomical Imaging | publisher=McGraw Hill Higher Education | year=1998 | accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Auxins''' (&lt;small&gt;plural of auxin&lt;/small&gt; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔː|k|s|ᵻ|n}}) are a class of [[plant hormone]]s (or plant growth  regulators) with some [[morphogen]]-like characteristics. Auxins have a cardinal role in coordination of many growth and behavioral processes in the plant's life cycle and are essential for plant body development. Auxins and their role in plant growth were first described by the Dutch scientist [[Frits Warmolt Went]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plant-hormones.info/auxins.htm Auxins] page on ''www.plant-hormones.info'' — a website set up at [[Long Ashton Research Station]] an institute of the [[BBSRC]] (site is now on independent server).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth V. Thimann]] was the first to isolate one of these phytohormones and determine its chemical structure as [[indole-3-acetic acid]] (IAA). Went and Thimann co-authored a book on plant hormones, ''Phytohormones'', in 1937.

==Overview==
Auxins were the first of the major [[plant hormone]]s to be discovered. They derive their name from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word αυξειν (''auxein'' – "to grow/increase"). 
Auxin (namely IAA) is present in all parts of a plant, although in very different concentrations. The concentration in each position is crucial developmental information, so it is subject to tight regulation through both metabolism and transport. The result is the auxin creates "patterns" of auxin concentration maxima and minima in the plant body, which in turn guide further development of respective cells, and ultimately of the plant as a whole.

The (dynamic and environment responsive) [[Pattern formation#Biology|pattern]] of auxin distribution within the plant is a key factor for plant growth, its reaction to its environment, and specifically for development of plant organs&lt;ref name="shaping"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Benkova 2003"/&gt; (such as [[leaf|leaves]] or [[flower]]s). It is achieved through very complex and well coordinated [[active transport|active]] transport of auxin molecules from cell to cell throughout the plant body — by the so-called [[polar auxin transport]].&lt;ref name="shaping"/&gt; Thus, a plant can (as a whole) react to external conditions and adjust to them, without requiring a [[nervous system]]. Auxins typically act in concert with, or in opposition to, other plant hormones. For example, the ratio of auxin to [[cytokinin]] in certain plant tissues determines initiation of root versus shoot buds.

On the molecular level, all auxins are compounds with an aromatic ring and a carboxylic acid group.&lt;ref name="Taiz"/&gt; The most important member of the auxin family is [[indole-3-acetic acid]] (IAA),&lt;ref name="simon"/&gt; which generates the majority of auxin effects in intact plants, and is the most potent native auxin. And as native auxin, its stability is controlled in many ways in plants, from synthesis, through possible [[Conjugation (biochemistry)|conjugation]] to degradation of its molecules, always according to the requirements of the situation. However, molecules of IAA are chemically [[labile]] in aqueous solution, so it is not used commercially as a plant growth regulator.

* Five naturally occurring (endogenous) auxins in plants include indole-3-acetic acid, [[4-Chloroindole-3-acetic acid|4-chloroindole-3-acetic acid]], [[phenylacetic acid]], [[indole-3-butyric acid]], and [[indole-3-propionic acid]].&lt;ref name="simon"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TBH-51S6X51-2&amp;_user=625101&amp;_coverDate=03%2F31%2F2011&amp;_rdoc=8&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_origin=browse&amp;_zone=rslt_list_item&amp;_srch=doc-info(%23toc%235143%232011%23998199996%232867740%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&amp;_cdi=5143&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;_ct=20&amp;_acct=C000031698&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=625101&amp;md5=d1409d89eff55b90161ef75e1ff59679&amp;searchtype=a | title=Why plants need more than one type of auxin |author1=Simon, S |author2=Petrášek, P | journal=Plant Science | year=2011 | volume=180 | issue=3 | pages=454–460 | doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2010.12.007 | pmid=21421392}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Auxin 2011 review "&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ludwig-Müller J | title = Auxin conjugates: their role for plant development and in the evolution of land plants | journal = J.

==Discovery of auxin==

===Charles Darwin===
In 1881, [[Charles Darwin]] and his son [[Francis Darwin|Francis]] performed experiments on [[coleoptiles]], the sheaths enclosing young leaves in germinating grass seedlings. The experiment exposed the coleoptile to light from a unidirectional source, and observed that they bend towards the light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=23152332 |year=2013 |last1=Hohm|first1=T |last2=Preuten |first2=T|last3=Fankhauser |first3=C |title=Phototropism: Translating light into directional growth |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=47–59 |doi=10.3732/ajb.1200299 |journal=American Journal of Botany}}&lt;/ref&gt; By covering various parts of the coleoptiles with a light-impermeable opaque cap, the Darwins discovered that light is detected by the coleoptile tip, but that bending occurs in the [[hypocotyl]]. However the seedlings showed no signs of development towards light if the tip was covered with an opaque cap, or if the tip was removed. The Darwins concluded that the tip of the coleoptile was responsible for sensing light, and proposed that a messenger is transmitted in a downward direction from the tip of the coleoptile, causing it to bend.&lt;ref name="Whippo"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16670442 |year=2006 |last1=Whippo |first1=CW |last2=Hangarter |first2=RP |title=Phototropism: Bending towards enlightenment |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=1110–9 |doi=10.1105/tpc.105.039669 |pmc=1456868 |journal=The Plant Cell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peter Boysen-Jensen===
In 1913, Danish scientist Peter Boysen-Jensen demonstrated that the signal was not transfixed but mobile. He separated the tip from the remainder of the coleoptile by a cube of gelatine which prevented cellular contact, but allowed chemicals to pass through. The seedlings responded normally bending towards the light. However, when the tip was separated by an impermeable substance, there was no curvature of the stem.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;Mendipweb [http://www.plant-hormones.info/auxins.htm Nature of auxin]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frits Went===
{{main|Frits Warmolt Went}}

In 1928, the Dutch botanist [[Frits Warmolt Went]] showed that a chemical messenger diffuses from coleoptile tips. Went's experiment identified how a growth promoting chemical causes a coleoptile to grow towards light. Went cut the tips of the coleoptiles and placed them in the dark, putting a few tips on agar blocks that he predicted would absorb the growth-promoting chemical. On control coleoptiles, he placed a block that lacked the chemical. On others, he placed blocks containing the chemical, either centred on top of the coleoptile to distribute the chemical evenly or offset to increase the concentration on one side.&lt;ref name="Whippo" /&gt;

When the growth-promoting chemical was distributed evenly the coleoptile grew straight. If the chemical was distributed unevenly, the coleoptile curved away from the side with the cube, as if growing towards light, even though it was grown in the dark. Went later proposed that the messenger substance is a growth-promoting hormone, which he named auxin, that becomes asymmetrically distributed in the bending region. Went concluded that auxin is at a higher concentration on the shaded side, promoting cell elongation, which results in a coleoptiles bending towards the light.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

==Hormonal activity==
Auxins help 
development at all levels in plants, from the [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] level, through organs, and ultimately to the whole plant.

=== Molecular mechanisms ===
When a plant cell comes into contact with auxin, it causes dramatic changes in [[gene expression]], with many genes up- or down-regulated. The precise mechanisms by which this occurs are still an area of active research, but there is now a general consensus on at least two auxin signalling pathways.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leyser|first=Ottoline|date=2018-01-01|title=Auxin Signaling|url=http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/176/1/465|journal=Plant Physiology|language=en|volume=176|issue=1|pages=465–479|doi=10.1104/pp.17.00765|issn=0032-0889|pmid=28818861|pmc=5761761}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Enders|first=Tara A.|last2=Strader|first2=Lucia C.|date=February 2015|title=Auxin Activity: Past, present, and Future|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=102|issue=2|pages=180–196|doi=10.3732/ajb.1400285|issn=0002-9122|pmc=4854432|pmid=25667071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Perception ====
The most well characterized auxin receptors are the TIR1/ AFB family of [[F-box protein]]s. F-box proteins target other proteins for degradation via the [[Ubiquitin|ubiquitin degradation pathway]]. When TIR1/ ABF proteins bind to auxin, the auxin acts as a 'molecular glue' that allows these proteins to then bind to their targets (see below).

Another auxin-binding protein, APB1 is now often regarded as an auxin receptor (at the [[apoplast]]), but it is generally considered to have a much more minor role than the TIR1/ABF signalling pathway, and much less is known about APB1 signalling.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

====Aux/IAA and ARF signalling modules ====
[[File:Auxin signal cascade.jpg|thumb|'''The auxin signal cascade:''' In the absence of auxin, Aux/IAAs bind to and suppress the transcriptional activity of ARFs. When auxin is present it forms a 'molecular glue' between TIR1 and Aux/IAAs, which leads to the degradation of these repressors. ARFs are then free to bind to DNA and to cause changes in transcription.]]
Auxin response factors (ARFs) are a large group of [[transcription factor]]s that act in auxin signalling. In the absence of auxin, ARFs bind to a class of repressors known as Aux/IAAs. Aux/IAAs suppress the ability of ARFs to enhance gene transcription. Additionally, the binding of Aux/IAAs to ARFs brings Aux/IAAs into contact with the [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]] of auxin regulated genes. When at these promoters, Aux/IAAs repress the expression of these genes through recruiting other factors to make modifications to the [[DNA]] structure.

The binding of auxin to TIR1/AFBs allows them to bind to Aux/IAAs. When bound by TIR1/AFBs, Aux/IAAs are marked for degradation. The degradation of Aux/IAAs frees ARF proteins, which are then able to activate or repress genes at whose promoters they are bound.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The large number of Aux/IAA and ARF binding pairs possible, and there different distributions between cell types and across developmental age are thought to account for the astonishingly diverse responses that auxin produces.

In June 2018 it was demonstrated that plant tissues can respond to auxin in a TIR1-dependent manner extremely quickly (probably too quickly to be explained by changes in gene expression). This has led some scientists to suggest that there is an as yet unidentified TIR1-dependent auxin-signalling pathway that differs from the well-known transcriptional response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fendrych|first=Matyáš|last2=Akhmanova|first2=Maria|last3=Merrin|first3=Jack|last4=Glanc|first4=Matouš|last5=Hagihara|first5=Shinya|last6=Takahashi|first6=Koji|last7=Uchida|first7=Naoyuki|last8=Torii|first8=Keiko U.|last9=Friml|first9=Jiří|date=2018-06-25|title=Rapid and reversible root growth inhibition by TIR1 auxin signalling|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-018-0190-1|journal=Nature Plants|volume=4|issue=7|pages=453–459|language=En|doi=10.1038/s41477-018-0190-1|pmid=29942048|issn=2055-0278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On a cellular level ===
On the cellular level, auxin is essential for [[cell growth]], affecting both [[cell division]] and cellular expansion. Auxin concentration level, together with other local factors, contributes to [[cell differentiation]] and specification of the cell fate.

Depending on the specific tissue, auxin may promote axial elongation (as in shoots), lateral expansion (as in root swelling), or isodiametric expansion (as in fruit growth). In some cases (coleoptile growth), auxin-promoted cellular expansion occurs in the absence of cell division. In other cases, auxin-promoted cell division and cell expansion may be closely sequenced within the same tissue (root initiation, fruit growth). In a living plant, auxins and other plant hormones nearly always appear to interact to determine patterns of plant development.

===Organ patterns===
Growth and division of plant cells together result in growth of [[Biological tissue|tissue]], and specific tissue growth contributes to the development of plant [[organ (anatomy)#Plant organs|organ]]s.

Growth of cells contributes to the plant's size, unevenly localized growth produces bending, turning and directionalization of organs- for example, stems turning toward light sources ([[phototropism]]), roots growing in response to gravity ([[gravitropism]]), and other [[tropism]]s originated because cells on one side grow faster than the cells on the other side of the organ. So, precise control of auxin distribution between different cells has paramount importance to the resulting form of plant growth and organization.

====Auxin transport and the uneven distribution of auxin====
{{further|polar auxin transport}}

To cause growth in the required domains, auxins must of necessity be active preferentially in them. Local auxin maxima can be formed by active biosynthesis in certain cells of tissues, for example via tryptophan-dependent pathways,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mashiguchi|first=Kiyoshi|date=2011|title=The main auxin biosynthesis pathway in Arabidopsis|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/45/18512.long|journal=PNAS|doi=10.1073/pnas.1108434108|pmid=22025724|access-date=|volume=108|issue=45|pmc=3215075|pages=18512–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but auxins are not synthesized in all cells (even if cells retain the potential ability to do so, only under specific conditions will auxin synthesis be activated in them). For that purpose, auxins have to be not only translocated toward those sites where they are needed, but also they must have an established mechanism to detect those sites. For that purpose, auxins have to be translocated toward those sites where they are needed. Translocation is driven throughout the plant body, primarily from [[meristem|peaks of shoots]] to peaks of roots (from up to down).

For long distances, relocation occurs via the stream of fluid in [[phloem]] vessels, but, for short-distance transport, a unique system of coordinated polar transport directly from cell to cell is exploited. This short-distance, active transport exhibits some [[morphogen]]etic properties.

This process, [[polar auxin transport]], is directional, very strictly regulated, and based in uneven distribution of auxin efflux carriers on the plasma membrane, which send auxins in the proper direction. While PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins are vital in transporting auxin in a polar manner,&lt;ref name="Benkova 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Petrásek J, Mravec J, Bouchard R |title=PIN proteins perform a rate-limiting function in cellular auxin efflux |journal=Science |volume=312 |issue=5775 |pages=914–8 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16601150 |doi=10.1126/science.1123542 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/312/5775/914|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; the family of AUXIN1/LIKE-AUX1 (AUX/LAX) genes encodes for non-polar auxin influx carriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swarup|first=Ranjan|last2=Péret|first2=Benjamin|date=2012-01-01|title=AUX/LAX family of auxin influx carriers—an overview|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpls.2012.00225/abstract|journal=Plant Traffic and Transport|volume=3|pages=225|doi=10.3389/fpls.2012.00225|pmc=3475149|pmid=23087694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regulation of PIN protein localisation in a cell determines the direction of auxin transport from cell, and concentrated effort of many cells creates peaks of auxin, or auxin maxima (regions having cells with higher auxin – a maximum).&lt;ref name="Benkova 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Benková E, Michniewicz M, Sauer M |title=Local, efflux-dependent auxin gradients as a common module for plant organ formation |journal=Cell |volume=115 |issue=5 |pages=591–602 |date=November 2003 |pmid=14651850 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867403009243 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00924-3|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proper and timely auxin maxima within developing roots and shoots are necessary to organise the development of the organ.&lt;ref name="shaping"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sabatini S, Beis D, Wolkenfelt H |title=An auxin-dependent distal organizer of pattern and polarity in the ''Arabidopsis'' root |journal=Cell |volume=99 |issue=5 |pages=463–72 |date=November 1999 |pmid=10589675 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092-8674(00)81535-4 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81535-4|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heisler MG, Ohno C, Das P |title=Patterns of auxin transport and gene expression during primordium development revealed by live imaging of the ''Arabidopsis'' inflorescence meristem |journal=Curr.

Surrounding auxin maxima are cells with low auxin troughs, or auxin minima.

===Organization of the plant ===
{{further|apical dominance}}

As auxins contribute to organ shaping,&lt;ref name="shaping"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Friml J |title=Auxin transport — shaping the plant |journal=Current Opinion in Plant Biology |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=7–12 |date=February 2003 |pmid=12495745 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1369526602000031 |doi=10.1016/S1369526602000031}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Benkova 2003"/&gt; they are also fundamentally required for proper development of the plant itself.&lt;ref name="shaping"/&gt; Without hormonal regulation and organization, plants would be merely proliferating heaps of similar cells. Auxin employment begins in the embryo of the plant, where directional distribution of auxin ushers in subsequent growth and development of primary growth poles, then forms buds of future organs. Next, it helps to coordinate proper development of the arising organs, such as roots, cotyledons and leaves and mediates long distance signals between them, contributing so to the overall architecture of the plant.&lt;ref name="shaping"/&gt; Throughout the plant's life, auxin helps the plant maintain the polarity of growth,&lt;ref name="shaping"/&gt; and actually "recognize" where it has its branches (or any organ) connected.

An important principle of plant organization based upon auxin distribution is [[apical dominance]], which means the auxin produced by the apical bud (or growing tip) diffuses (and is transported) downwards and inhibits the development of ulterior lateral bud growth, which would otherwise compete with the apical tip for light and nutrients. Removing the apical tip and its suppressively acting auxin allows the lower dormant lateral buds to develop, and the buds between the leaf stalk and stem produce new shoots which compete to become the lead growth. The process is actually quite complex, because auxin transported downwards from the lead shoot tip has to interact with several other plant hormones (such as [[strigolactone]]s or [[cytokinins]]) in the process on various positions along the growth axis in plant body to achieve this phenomenon. This plant behavior is used in [[pruning]] by horticulturists.

Finally, the sum of auxin arriving from stems to roots influences the degree of root growth. If shoot tips are removed, the plant does not react just by outgrowth of lateral buds — which are supposed to replace to original lead. It also follows that smaller amount of auxin arriving to the roots results in slower growth of roots and the nutrients are subsequently in higher degree invested in the upper part of the plant, which hence starts to grow faster.
&lt;!---------- Is this section necessary?
==Locations==
;Biosynthesis

Auxins are not synthesized everywhere, but each cell retains the potential ability to do so, and only under specific conditions will auxin synthesis be activated. Auxin is preferentially sythesised in the following sites:
*In [[shoot]] (and [[root]]) [[meristem]]atic [[Biological tissue|tissue]]
*In young [[leaf|leaves]]
*In mature leaves in very tiny amounts
*In mature root cells in even smaller amounts

==Effects==&lt;!--the cleanup required to make this section even legible - never mind intelligible - was WORK--&gt;

[[Image:Auxin.jpg|thumb|A healthy ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' plant (left) next to an auxin signal-transduction mutant with a repressed response to auxin.]]
[[Image:Agrobacteriumgall.jpg|thumb|[[Gall|Crown galls]] are caused by ''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]'' [[bacteria]]; they produce and excrete auxin and [[cytokinin]], which interfere with normal [[cell division]] and cause [[tumor]]s.]]

Auxin participates in [[phototropism]], [[geotropism]], [[hydrotropism]] and other developmental changes. The uneven distribution of auxin, due to environmental cues, such as unidirectional light or gravity force, results in uneven plant tissue growth, and generally, auxin governs the form and shape of plant body, direction and strength of growth of all organs, and their mutual interaction.&lt;ref name="Benkova 2003"/&gt;

Auxin stimulates cell elongation by stimulating wall-loosening factors, such as [[elastin]]s, to loosen [[cell wall]]s. The effect is stronger if [[gibberellins]] are also present. Auxin also stimulates cell division if [[cytokinins]] are present. When auxin and cytokinin are applied to [[callus]], rooting can be generated if the auxin concentration is higher than cytokinin concentration. [[Xylem]] tissues can be generated when the auxin concentration is equal to the cytokinins.

Auxin also induces sugar and mineral accumulation at the site of application.

===Wound response===
Auxin induces the formation and organization of [[phloem]] and [[xylem]].  When the plant is wounded, the auxin may induce the [[cell differentiation]] and regeneration of the vascular tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ALONI|first=R.|last2=ALONI|first2=E.|last3=LANGHANS|first3=M.|last4=ULLRICH|first4=C. I.|date=May 2006|title=Role of Cytokinin and Auxin in Shaping Root Architecture: Regulating Vascular Differentiation, Lateral Root Initiation, Root Apical Dominance and Root Gravitropism|journal=Annals of Botany|volume=97|issue=5|pages=883–893|doi=10.1093/aob/mcl027|issn=0305-7364|pmc=2803412|pmid=16473866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Root growth and development===
Auxins promote root initiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Chambers |title=Science and Technology Dictionary |isbn=978-0-550-14110-1|year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Auxin induces both growth of pre-existing roots and adventitious root formation, i.e., branching of the roots. As more native auxin is transported down the stem to the roots, the overall development of the roots is stimulated. If the source of auxin is removed, such as by trimming the tips of stems, the roots are less stimulated accordingly, and growth of stem is supported instead.

In horticulture, auxins, especially [[1-Naphthaleneacetic acid|NAA]] and [[Indole-3-butyric acid|IBA]], are commonly applied to stimulate root initiation when rooting [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]] of plants. However, high concentrations of auxin inhibit root elongation and instead enhance adventitious root formation.  Removal of the root tip can lead to inhibition of secondary root formation.

===Apical dominance===
Auxin induces shoot [[apical dominance]]; the [[axillary bud]]s are inhibited by auxin, as a high concentration of auxin directly stimulates [[ethylene]] synthesis in axillary buds, causing inhibition of their growth and potentiation of apical dominance. When the apex of the plant is removed, the inhibitory effect is removed and the growth of lateral buds is enhanced. Auxin is sent to the part of the plant facing away from the light, where it promotes cell elongation, thus causing the plant to bend towards the light.&lt;ref&gt;Jiří Friml Lab (2012). That is why plants grow towards the light! VIB (the Flanders Institute for Biotechnology). http://www.vib.be/en/news/Pages/That-is-why-plants-grow-towards-the-light!.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fruit growth and development===
Auxin is required for fruit growth and development and delays fruit [[senescence]]. When seeds are removed from strawberries, fruit growth is stopped; exogenous auxin stimulates the growth in fruits with seeds removed. For fruit with unfertilized seeds, exogenous auxin results in [[parthenocarpy]] ("virgin-fruit" growth).

Fruits form abnormal morphologies when auxin transport is disturbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nemhauser JL, Feldman LJ, Zambryski PC |title=Auxin and ETTIN in ''Arabidopsis'' gynoecium morphogenesis |journal=Development |volume=127 |issue=18 |pages=3877–88 |date=September 2000 |pmid=10952886 |url=http://dev.biologists.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10952886}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Arabidopsis]]'' fruits, auxin controls the release of seeds from the fruit (pod). The valve margins are a specialised tissue in pods that regulates when pod will open (dehiscence). Auxin must be removed from the valve margin cells to allow the valve margins to form. This process requires modification of the auxin transporters (PIN proteins).&lt;ref name="Sorefan2009"/&gt;

===Flowering===
Auxin plays also a minor role in the initiation of flowering and development of reproductive organs. In low concentrations, it can delay the [[senescence]] of flowers. A number of plant mutants have been described that affect flowering and have deficiencies in either auxin synthesis or transport. In maize, one example is [[bif2 barren inflorescence2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McSteen |first=P |author2=Malcomber, S|author3=Skirpan, A|author4=Lunde, C|author5=Wu, X|author6=Kellogg, E|author7= Hake, S |title=barren inflorescence2 Encodes a co-ortholog of the PINOID serine/threonine kinase and is required for organogenesis during inflorescence and vegetative development in maize |journal=Plant Physiology |date=June 2007 |volume=144 |issue=2 |pages=1000–11 |doi=10.1104/pp.107.098558 |pmid=17449648 |url=http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/144/2/1000 |pmc=1914211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethylene biosynthesis===
In low concentrations, auxin can inhibit ethylene formation and transport of precursor in plants; however, high concentrations can induce the synthesis of ethylene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yu|first=Y.-B.|last2=Yang|first2=S. F.|title=Auxin-induced Ethylene Production and Its Inhibition by Aminoethyoxyvinylglycine and Cobalt Ion|journal=Plant Physiology|volume=64|issue=6|pages=1074–1077|doi=10.1104/pp.64.6.1074|year=1979|pmc=543194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the high concentration can induce femaleness of flowers in some species. {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

Auxin inhibits [[abscission]] prior to formation of abscission layer, and thus inhibits senescence of leaves.

== Synthetic auxins ==
In the course of research on auxin biology, many compounds with noticeable auxin activity were synthesized. Many of them had been found to have economical potential for man-controlled growth and development of plants in agronomy. Synthetic auxins include the following compounds:

Auxins are toxic to plants in large concentrations; they are most toxic to [[dicot]]s and less so to [[monocot]]s. Because of this property, [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] auxin herbicides, including [[2,4-D]] and [[2,4,5-T]], have been developed and used for [[weed]] control.

However, some exogenously synthesized auxins, especially [[1-naphthaleneacetic acid]] (NAA) and [[indole-3-butyric acid]] (IBA), are also commonly applied to stimulate root growth when taking [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]] of plants or for different agricultural purposes such as the prevention of fruit drop in [[orchard]]s.

Used in high doses, auxin stimulates the production of [[ethylene]]. Excess ethylene (also native plant hormone) can inhibit elongation growth, cause [[leaf|leaves]] to fall ([[abscission]]), and even kill the plant. Some synthetic auxins, such as 2,4-D and [[2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4,5-T) were marketed also as [[herbicide]]s. [[Dicots]], such as [[dandelion]]s, are much more susceptible to auxins than [[monocots]], such as [[grass]]es and [[cereals|cereal]] crops. So, these synthetic auxins are valuable as synthetic herbicides. 2,4-D was the first widely used herbicide, and it is still so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.24d.org/ The Industry Task Force II on 2,4-D Research Data]&lt;/ref&gt; [[2,4-D]] was first commercialized by the [[Sherwin-Williams]] company, and saw use in the late 1940s. It is easy and inexpensive to manufacture.

;Herbicide manufacture
The [[defoliant]] [[Agent Orange]], used extensively by British forces in the [[Malayan Emergency]] and American forces in the [[Vietnam War]], was a mix of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. The compound 2,4-D is still in use and is thought to be safe, but 2,4,5-T was more or less banned by the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] in 1979. The [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]] [[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|TCDD]] is an unavoidable contaminant produced in the manufacture of 2,4,5-T. As a result of the integral dioxin contamination, 2,4,5-T has been implicated in [[leukemia]], [[miscarriage]]s, [[birth defect]]s, [[liver]] damage, and other [[disease]]s.

[[File:Bimetallic stripe.svg|thumb|300px|Diagram of a bimetallic strip showing how the difference in thermal expansion in the two metals leads to a much larger sideways displacement of the strip]]
[[File:Bimetal coil reacts to lighter.gif|frame|right|A bimetallic coil from a thermometer reacts to the heat from a lighter, by uncoiling and then coiling back up when the lighter is removed.]]
A '''bimetallic strip''' is used to convert a temperature change into mechanical displacement. The strip consists of two strips of different metals which expand at different rates as they are heated, usually [[steel]] and [[copper]], or in some cases steel and [[brass]]. The strips are joined together throughout their length by [[rivet]]ing, [[brazing]] or [[welding]]. The different expansions force the flat strip to bend one way if heated, and in the opposite direction if cooled below its initial temperature. The metal with the higher [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] is on the outer side of the curve when the strip is heated and on the inner side when cooled.

The sideways displacement of the strip is much larger than the small lengthways expansion in either of the two metals. This effect is used in a range of mechanical and electrical devices. In some applications the bimetal strip is used in the flat form. In others, it is wrapped into a coil for compactness. The greater length of the coiled version gives improved sensitivity.

== History ==
[[File:John Harrison memorial 02.jpg|thumb|200px|John Harrison's Memorial in Westminster Abbey, London]]

The earliest surviving bimetallic strip was made by the eighteenth-century [[clockmaker]] [[John Harrison]] who is generally credited with its invention. He made it for his third [[marine chronometer]] (H3) of 1759  to compensate for temperature-induced changes in the [[balance spring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Sobel |first= Dava | authorlink= Dava Sobel |title= [[Longitude (book)|Longitude]] |year= 1995 |publisher= Fourth Estate |location= London |isbn= 0-00-721446-4 | pages= 103 | quote= One of the inventions Harrison introduced in H-3... is called... a bi-metallic strip.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should not be confused with the bimetallic mechanism for correcting for thermal expansion in his [[gridiron pendulum]]. His earliest examples had two individual metal strips joined by rivets but he also invented the later technique of directly fusing molten brass onto a steel substrate. A strip of this type was fitted to his last timekeeper, H5. Harrison's invention is recognized in the memorial to him in [[Westminster Abbey]], England.

==Applications==

===Clocks===
Mechanical [[clock]] mechanisms are sensitive to temperature changes as each part has tiny tolerance and it leads to errors in time keeping. A bimetallic strip is used to compensate this phenomenon in the mechanism of some timepieces. The most common method is to use a bimetallic construction for the circular rim of the [[balance wheel]]. What it does is move a weight in a radial way looking at the circular plane down by the balance wheel, varying then, the momentum of inertia of the balance wheel. As the spring controlling the balance becomes weaker with the increasing temperature, the balance becomes smaller in diameter to decrease the momentum of inertia and keep the period of oscillation (and hence timekeeping) constant.

Nowadays this system is not used anymore since the appearance of low temperature coefficient alloys like [[nivarox]], parachrom and many others depending on each brand.

===Thermostats===
[[File:WPThermostat new.jpg|thumb|Thermostat with bimetal coil at (2)]]

{{see also|Tipping point (physics)#Set-point thermostats|label 1=Tipping points and 'popping disc' bimetal thermostats}}
In the regulation of heating and cooling, [[thermostat]]s that operate over a wide range of temperatures are used. In these, one end of the bimetallic strip is mechanically fixed and attached to an electrical power source, while the other (moving) end carries an electrical contact. In adjustable thermostats another contact is positioned with a regulating knob or lever. The position so set controls the regulated temperature, called the ''set point''.

Some thermostats use a [[mercury switch]] connected to both electrical leads. The angle of the entire mechanism is adjustable to control the set point of the thermostat.

Depending upon the application, a higher temperature may open a contact (as in a [[heater]] control) or it may close a contact (as in a [[refrigerator]] or [[air conditioner]]).

The electrical contacts may control the power directly (as in a household iron) or indirectly, switching electrical power through a [[relay]] or the supply of [[natural gas]] or [[fuel oil]] through an electrically operated valve. In some natural gas heaters the power may be provided with a [[thermocouple]] that is heated by a pilot light (a small, continuously burning, flame). In devices without pilot lights for ignition (as in most modern gas clothes dryers and some natural gas heaters and decorative fireplaces) the power for the contacts is provided by reduced household electrical power that operates a relay controlling an electronic ignitor, either a resistance heater or an electrically powered [[spark gap|spark]] generating device.

===Thermometers===
A direct indicating dial [[thermometer]] really common in daily use devices (such as a patio thermometer or a meat thermometer) uses a bimetallic strip wrapped into a coil in its most used design. The coil changes the lineal movement of the metal expansion into a circular movement thanks to the helicoidal shape it draws. One end of the coil is fixed to the housing of the device as a fix point and the other drives an indicating needle inside a circular indicator. A bimetallic strip is also used in a [[recording thermometer]]. [[Breguet's thermometer]] consists of a tri-metallic helix in order to have a more accurate results.

===Heat engine===
Heat engines are not the most efficient ones, and with the use of bimetallic strips the efficiency of the heat engines is even lower as there is no chamber to contain the heat. Moreover, the bimetallic strips cannot produce strength in its moves, the reason why is that in order to achieve reasonables bendings (movements) both metallic strips have to be thin to make the difference between the expansion noticeable.  So the uses for metallic strips in heat engines are mostly in simple toys that have been built to demonstrate how the principle can be used to drive a [[heat engine]].&lt;sup&gt;[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt;

===Electrical devices===
Bimetal strips are used in miniature [[circuit breaker]]s to protect circuits from excess current. A coil of wire is used to heat a bimetal strip, which bends and operates a linkage that unlatches a spring-operated contact. This interrupts the circuit and can be reset when the bimetal strip has cooled down.

Bimetal strips are also used in time-delay relays, lamp flashers, and [[Fluorescent lamp#Starting|fluorescent lamp starters]]. In some devices the current running directly through the bimetal strip is sufficient to heat it and operate contacts directly.

==Calculations==
[[Curvature]] of a bimetallic beam:

:&lt;math&gt;\kappa = \frac{6 E_1 E_2 (h_1 + h_2)h_1 h_2 \epsilon }{E_1^2 h_1^4 + 4 E_1 E_2 h_1^3 h_2 + 6 E_1 E_2 h_1^2 h_2^2 + 4 E_1 E_2 h_2^3 h_1 + E_2^2 h_2^4}&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h_1&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Young's modulus]] and height (thickness) of material one and &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h_2&lt;/math&gt; are the Young's modulus and height (thickness) of material two. &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the misfit strain, calculated by:

:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon = (\alpha_1-\alpha_2) \Delta T \,&lt;/math&gt;

:where α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the coefficient of thermal expansion of material one and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the coefficient of thermal expansion of material two. ΔT is the current temperature minus the reference temperature (the temperature where the beam has no flexure).&lt;ref&gt;Clyne, TW. “Residual stresses in surface coatings and their effects on interfacial debonding.” Key Engineering Materials (Switzerland).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20469">'''Bioinorganic chemistry''' is a field that examines the role of [[metal]]s in [[biology]]. Bioinorganic chemistry includes the study of both natural phenomena such as the behavior of [[metalloprotein]]s as well as artificially introduced metals, including those that are [[essential element|non-essential]], in [[medicine]] and [[toxicology]].  Many [[biological process]]es such as [[cellular respiration|respiration]] depend upon molecules that fall within the realm of [[inorganic chemistry]].   The discipline also includes the study of inorganic models or mimics that imitate the behaviour of metalloproteins.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Lippard, Jeremy M. Berg, ''Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry'', University Science Books, 1994, {{ISBN|0-935702-72-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a mix of [[biochemistry]] and [[inorganic chemistry]], bioinorganic chemistry is important in elucidating the implications of electron-transfer [[protein]]s, substrate bindings and activation, atom and group transfer chemistry as well as metal properties in biological chemistry.

==Composition of living organisms==
About 99% of [[mammals]]' mass are the elements [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[calcium]], [[sodium]], [[chlorine]], [[potassium]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[oxygen]] and [[sulfur]].&lt;ref name=Heymsfield&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heymsfield S, Waki M, Kehayias J, Lichtman S, Dilmanian F, Kamen Y, Wang J, Pierson R |title=Chemical and elemental analysis of humans in vivo using improved body composition models |journal=[[American Journal of Physiology]] |volume=261 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=E190–8 |year=1991 |pmid=1872381}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[organic compound]]s ([[proteins]], [[lipids]] and [[carbohydrates]]) contain the majority of the carbon and nitrogen and most of the oxygen and hydrogen is present as water.&lt;ref name=Heymsfield/&gt;  The entire collection of metal-containing [[biomolecules]] in a [[Cell (biology)|cell]] is called the [[metallome]].

==History==
[[Paul Ehrlich]] used [[organoarsenic]] (“arsenicals”) for the treatment of [[syphilis]], demonstrating the relevance of metals, or at least metalloids, to medicine, that blossomed with Rosenberg’s discovery of the anti-cancer activity of [[cisplatin]] (cis-PtCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  The first protein ever crystallized (see [[James B. Sumner]]) was [[urease]], later shown to contain nickel at its [[active site]].  [[Cyanocobalamin|Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]], the cure for [[pernicious anemia]] was shown crystallographically by [[Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin]] to consist of a cobalt in a [[corrin]] macrocycle.  The Watson-Crick structure for [[DNA]] demonstrated the key structural role played by phosphate-containing polymers.

==Themes in bioinorganic chemistry==
Several distinct systems are of identifiable in bioinorganic chemistry.  Major areas include:

===Metal ion transport and storage===
This topic covers a diverse collection of [[ion channel]]s, ion pumps (e.g. [[NaKATPase]]), [[vacuole]]s, [[siderophore]]s, and other [[protein]]s and small molecules which control the concentration of metal ions in the cells.  One issue is that many metals that are metabolically required are not readily available owing to solubility or scarcity.  Organisms have developed a number of strategies for collecting such elements and transporting them.

===Enzymology===
Many reactions in life sciences involve water and metal ions are often at the catalytic centers (active sites) for these enzymes, i.e. these are [[metalloprotein]]s.  Often the reacting water is a ligand (see [[metal aquo complex]]).  Examples of [[hydrolase]] enzymes are [[carbonic anhydrase]], metallo[[phosphatase]]s, and [[metalloproteinase]]s.  Bioinorganic chemists seek to understand and replicate the function of these metalloproteins.

Metal-containing electron transfer proteins are also common.  They can be organized into three major classes: [[iron-sulfur protein]]s (such as [[rubredoxin]]s, [[ferredoxin]]s, and [[Rieske protein]]s), blue [[copper proteins]], and [[cytochrome]]s. These electron transport proteins are complementary to the non-metal electron transporters [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]] (NAD) and [[flavin adenine dinucleotide]] (FAD). The [[nitrogen cycle]] make extensive use of metals for the redox interconversions.

===Toxicity===
Several metal ions are toxic to humans and other animals. The bioinorganic chemistry of lead in the context of its toxicity has been reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Maret |first1= Wolfgang|chapter= Chapter 1. The Bioinorganic Chemistry of Lead in the Context of its Toxicity|publisher= de Gruyter|publication-date= 2017|series= Metal Ions in Life Sciences|volume=17|title=Lead: Its Effects on Environment and Health|editor1-last=Astrid|editor1-first= S.|editor2-last=Helmut|editor2-first=S.|editor3-last=Sigel |editor3-first= R. K. O.|doi=10.1515/9783110434330-001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Oxygen transport and activation proteins===
{{Main article|Transition metal dioxygen complex}}
Aerobic life make extensive use of metals such as iron, copper, and manganese.  [[Heme]] is utilized by [[red blood cell]]s in the form of [[hemoglobin]] for oxygen transport and is perhaps the most recognized metal system in biology.  Other oxygen transport systems include [[myoglobin]], [[hemocyanin]], and [[hemerythrin]].  [[Oxidase]]s and [[oxygenase]]s are metal systems found throughout nature that take advantage of oxygen to carry out important reactions such as energy generation in [[cytochrome c oxidase]] or small molecule oxidation in [[cytochrome P450 oxidase]]s or [[methane monooxygenase]].  Some metalloproteins are designed to protect a biological system from the potentially harmful effects of oxygen and other reactive oxygen-containing molecules such as [[hydrogen peroxide]].  These systems include [[peroxidase]]s, [[catalase]]s, and [[superoxide dismutase]]s.  A complementary metalloprotein to those that react with oxygen is the [[oxygen evolving complex]] present in plants.  This system is part of the complex protein machinery that [[Oxygen evolution|produces oxygen]] as plants perform [[photosynthesis]].
[[Image:Myoglobin.png|right|220px|thumb|Myoglobin is a prominent subject in bioinorganic chemistry, with particular attention to the iron-heme complex that is anchored to the protein.]]

===Bioorganometallic chemistry===
[[Bioorganometallic chemistry|Bioorganometallic]] systems feature metal-carbon bonds as structural elements or as intermediates. Bioorganometallic enzymes and proteins include the [[hydrogenase]]s, [[FeMoco]] in nitrogenase, and [[methylcobalamin]].  These naturally occurring [[organometallic compounds]].  This area is more focused on the utilization of metals by unicellular organisms. Bioorganometallic compounds are significant in [[environmental chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Sigel |editor-first=A. |editor2=Sigel, H. |editor3=Sigel, R.K.O. |title=Organometallics in Environment and Toxicology|publisher=RSC publishing|location=Cambridge|year=2010|series=Metal Ions in Life Sciences|volume=7|isbn=978-1-84755-177-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FeMoco cluster.svg|thumb|right|160px|Structure of [[FeMoco]], the catalytic center of nitrogenase.]]

===Metals in medicine===
{{Main article|Metals in medicine}}
A number of drugs contain metals.  This theme relies on the study of the design and mechanism of action of metal-containing pharmaceuticals, and compounds that interact with endogenous metal ions in enzyme active sites. The most widely used anti-cancer drug is [[cisplatin]].  [[MRI contrast agent]] commonly contain [[gadolinium]].  [[Lithium carbonate]] has been used to treat the manic phase of bipolar disorder.  Gold antiarthritic drugs, e.g. [[auranofin]] have been commerciallized.  [[Carbon monoxide-releasing molecules]] are metal complexes have been developed to suppress inflammation by releasing small amounts of carbon monoxide.  The [[cardiovascular]] and [[neuron]]al importance of [[nitric oxide]] has been examined, including the enzyme [[nitric oxide synthase]]. (See also: [[nitrogen assimilation]].) Besides, metallic transition complexes based on triazolopyrimidines have been tested against several parasite strains. &lt;ref name="pmid29227923"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Méndez-Arriaga JM, Oyarzabal I, etal |title=In vitro leishmanicidal and trypanocidal evaluation and magnetic properties of 7-amino-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine Cu(II) complexes |journal=J.

===Environmental chemistry===
{{main article|Environmental chemistry}}
Environmental chemistry traditionally emphasizes the interaction of heavy metals with organisms.  [[Methylmercury]] has caused major disaster called [[Minamata disease]]. [[Arsenic poisoning]] is a widespread problem owing largely to [[arsenic contamination of groundwater]], which affects many millions of people in developing countries.  The metabolism of mercury- and arsenic-containing compounds involves [[cobalamin]]-based enzymes.

===Biomineralization===
{{main article|Biomineralization}}
Biomineralization is the process by which living organisms produce [[mineral]]s, often to harden or stiffen existing tissues. Such tissues are called [[mineralized tissues]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Main group compounds===
Many other elements aside from metals are bio-active.  Sulfur and phosphorus are required for all life.   Phosphorus almost exclusively exists as phosphate and its various [[ester]]s.  Sulfur exists in a variety of oxidation states, ranging from sulfate (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) down to sulfide (S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;).  Selenium is a trace element involved in proteins that are antioxidants. Cadmium is important because of its toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13003">'''Bold hypothesis''' (or "bold conjecture") is a concept in the philosophy of science of [[Karl Popper]], first explained in his debut ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]''  (1935) and subsequently elaborated in writings such as ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'' (1963). The concept is nowadays widely used in the [[philosophy of science]] and in the [[philosophy of knowledge]]. It is also used in the social and behavioural sciences.

==Brief explanation==
Popper's argument is that the growth of scientific knowledge progresses by means of formulating ''bold'' hypotheses, and trying to refute (disprove or falsify) them.  Popper believed that:

{{Quotation|"Bold ideas, unjustified anticipations, and speculative thought, are our only means for interpreting nature: our only organon, our only instrument, for grasping her."&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper]], ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery''. London: Routledge, 1992, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

He makes this point more specific in a 1953 lecture, where he argues that, if we aim to explain the world, then:

{{Quotation|"... there is no more rational procedure than the method of trial and error – of conjecture and refutation: of boldly proposing theories; of trying our best to show that these are erroneous; and of accepting them tentatively if our critical efforts are unsuccessful. From the point of view here developed, all laws, all theories, remain essentially tentative, or conjectural, or hypothetical, even when we feel unable to doubt them any longer."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, British Council lecture given at Peterhouse, Cambridge, in Summer 1953. Published under the title "Philosophy of Science: a Personal Report" in C. A. Mace (ed.), British Philosophy in Mid-Century: a Cambridge Symposium. London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1966.[https://webfiles.uci.edu/rsmead/PHIL330/Readings/Popper%20-%20Science%20-%20Conjectures%20and%20Refutations.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

A "bold" hypothesis is a new scientific idea which, if it was true, would be able to predict and/or explain a lot, or a lot more, about the subject  being theorized about.  The "boldness" of a hypothesis depends mainly on:
 
*Its scope – the number and variety of phenomena which it could explain, if it is true (its "explanatory power").
*its novelty or originality – the extent to which the hypothesis is a genuinely ''new'' departure from the received scientific ideas.
*whether it enables new and novel predictions ("predictive power"").
*whether it stimulates new, innovative research ("heuristic power").
*Its degree of applicability or usefulness for scientific research ("utility").
*The effect or impact it has on existing scientific thinking, if it is true. 
 
Once a bold hypothesis has been mooted, Popper argues, scientists try to investigate and test how well the bold hypothesis can stand up to the known evidence, with the aim of finding counter-arguments which would refute or falsify the bold hypothesis.  In this process of testing and criticism, new scientific knowledge is generated. Even if the bold hypothesis turns out to have been wrong, testing it generates new knowledge about what can and cannot be the case. Often it stimulates new research.

Inversely, if a hypothesis lacks the quality of boldness, then it would make very little difference to what scientists already know. It is not "a big deal", i.e. it is not very significant for the theory which exists already. It can contribute rather little to advancing scientific progress, because it does not expand or add to scientific understanding very much.

According to Popper,
{{Quotation|"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock. The bold structure of its theories rises, as it were, above a swamp. It is like a building erected on piles. The piles are driven down from above into the swamp, but not down to any natural or ‘given’ base; and if we stop driving the piles deeper, it is not because we have reached firm ground. We simply stop when we are satisfied that the piles are firm enough to carry the structure, at least for the time being." "&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper]], The Logic of Scientific Discovery . London: Routledge, 1992, p.94.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

In Popper's philosophy of science, scientific statements are always provisional, they have limits of application, and they could always be wrong. If a statement cannot even in principle be proved wrong, it cannot be a scientific statement. Thus, in Popper's eyes, the [[falsifiability]] criterion clearly demarcates "science" from "[[non-science]]". This Popperian idea has been very controversial, however. The reason is that it can be quite difficult to test scientifically how true a particular idea is. Even if scientists do ''want'' to test an idea, they may not know yet ''how'' exactly to test it conclusively. Yet, scientists also don't want to abandon a hunch that seems useful, simply because they don't know how to verify it yet. This point is especially important for "bold" new hypotheses, because the very "boldness" of the new hypothesis could mean that it would take a lot of work before adequate tests could be designed.

Some philosophers have argued that, in the real world, scientists operate routinely with at least some metaphysical beliefs for which they have no proof or verification whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Amsterdamski, ''Between Experience and Metaphysics''. Dordrecht: Reidel, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Paul Feyerabend]], the creative processes that lead to a scientific discovery are usually quite reasonable and non-arbitrary. However, the creative processes are by no means fully "rational", and they can be quite unique. Thus, the idea that there is one standard model which can define the rationality of all scientific methods should be rejected.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Feyerabend]], ''Against Method'', 3rd edition. London: Verso, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of his later writings, ''Objective Knowledge'' (1972), Popper argued that:

{{Quotation|"A theory is the bolder the greater its content. It is also the riskier: it is the more probable to start with that it will be false. We try to find its weak points, to refute it. If we fail to refute it, or if the refutations we find are at the same time also refutations of the weaker theory which was its predecessor, then we have reason to suspect, or to conjecture, that the stronger theory has no greater falsity content than its weaker predecessor, and, therefore, that it has the greater degree of [[verisimilitude]]".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, ''Objective Knowledge: an evolutionary approach''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1972, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

This interpretation was criticized by Adolf Grünbaum.&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Grünbaum, "Is the Method of Bold Conjectures and Attempted Refutations Justifiably the Method of Science?". ''The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 27, No. 2 (Jun., 1976), pp. 105–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main criticisms==
Popper’s idea of the role of bold hypotheses in scientific progress has attracted three main kinds of criticisms.
*The idea of a bold hypothesis is itself somewhat vague, because exactly "how bold is bold"?&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Cleveland and Paul T. Sagal, "Bold hypotheses: the bolder the better?", in: ''Ratio'', Vol. 2, No. 2, December 1989, pp. 109–121, at p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; It might just depend on how you look at it. Some new ideas, although they are rather modest in themselves, can make a very large difference to the advancement of scientific research. The "boldness" could refer to the ''content'' of the hypothesis (considered relative to other possible hypotheses), or to the manner or context in which the hypothesis is ''presented'', to its importance for research, or to the ''attitude'' involved. It remains somewhat unclear what kinds of criteria we might use, to credit new hypotheses as "bold" or not. A fashionable scientist might be presented as doing new and bold things, while in reality it was more hype than substance.
*[[Imre Lakatos]] argued, that scientists do not aim to test bold hypotheses mainly in order to ''falsify'' them.&lt;ref&gt;Imre Lakatos, "Falsification and the methodology of scientific research programmes".  In: Imre Lakatos &amp; Alan Musgrave (eds.), ''Criticism and the growth of knowledge''. Cambridge University Press, 1970. pp. 91-195.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they aim mainly to ''confirm'' hypotheses.  A falsified conjecture shows the scientist only "what he does not know", whereas the scientist is more interested in what s/he does know, and what s/he ''can'' know. The scientist is interested in gaining ''positive'' new knowledge, which can be used for practical purposes. The scientist is not primarily interested in “knowing that he doesn’t know things” or in "what is not the case" (other than to rule out possibilities). The scientist wants to know what really ''is'' the case. Scientific statements according to this Lakatosian point of view are not ''falsifiable'' statements, but ''fallible'' statements. Fallible statements are simply statements which could be wrong. Fallible statements include ''both'' testable statements ''and'' statements of which it is known that they could be wrong, although currently we do not know how to test them yet for their truth or falsity (or, the possible tests are technically not yet feasible). Thus, scientific statements are fallible statements which scientists ''intend'' or ''aim'' to test for their truth-content. Lakatos did not regard scientific progress simply as a "trial and error" process, but as a process involving definite "do's and don'ts", which he calls "positive heuristics" and "negative heuristics". He believed Popper's philosophy was inconsistent, because Popper claimed definitive falsification was possible, while denying that absolute positive proof of a hypothesis was possible. In Lakatos's view of science, neither is true. There exist no "crucial experiments" which can either prove or disprove a hypothesis definitively.&lt;ref&gt;Imre Lakatos, "The role of crucial experiments in science". In: ''Studies in History and Philosophy of Science'', Part A 4 (4), pp. 309-325, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; All that really happens, is that scientists decide to accept the results of a test as definitive "for all intents and purposes", even though in principle that methodological decision could later on still be proved wrong. 
*Scientific researchers have argued that Popper’s interpretation does not provide a very realistic picture of what most scientists actually do. They argue that Popper focused on the “glamorous” side of scientific work.  In much, if not most, scientific work in the real world, scientists are not mooting bold hypotheses. Instead, they are working patiently on systematic and detailed tests of a small facet of a much larger theory (or a larger research programme). [[Thomas Kuhn]] called this "[[normal science]]". Thus, progress may come about not so much because somebody has a grandiose new idea, but instead because the careful testing of the details of a theory eventually provides definitive scientific conclusions.

Despite these important criticisms, Popper's concept of bold hypotheses continues to be widely used in the academic world. One reason is that, at some level, the concept does make sense, even if (arguably) Popper himself failed to define its role in scientific research very well. Another reason is that academic progress always requires that a scholar does something genuinely new and "breaks new ground". If a scholar only concerns himself with tiny, uncontroversial and fairly trivial claims, he is unlikely to be rewarded very much for his effort. Plausible and credible bold hypotheses are highly valued in the academic world, so long as they are reasonably consistent with well-established scientific findings, and do not seriously challenge scientific authority. 

In the business community, too, [[innovation]] is very important, to find new ways to reduce costs, increase sales, and increase profits.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Freeman &amp; Luc Soete, ''The economics of industrial innovation'', 3rd ed. London: Pinter 1999; Chris Freeman &amp; Francisco Louçã, ''As time goes by''. Oxford University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; A bold new idea can be worth a lot of money, and therefore, business people are often sympathetic to bold attempts to reframe what is known already and to create new ideas; without such innovations, they would eventually be defeated by competitors who have a better idea. So the idea of a bold hypothesis also continues to have a place in economics, management theory and business administration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6140">The '''Centro de Arte y Comunicación''' (CAyC) was an arts organization based in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], that was instrumental in creating an international arts movement based on the ideas of systems art within [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref name=CVAA-GrupoCAyC-2013&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sarti|first1=Graciela|title=Grupo CAyC|date=March 2013|publisher=Centro Virtual de Arte Argentino|location=Buenos Aires|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ImageTextConceptualArt-2016&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kalyva|first1=Eve|title=Image and Text in Conceptual Art: Critical Operations in Context|date=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Cham, Switzerland|isbn=978-3-319-45086-5|pages=80-102|language=en|chapter=Chapter 3.5: "Art and Violence in the Open Air: The Activities of CAYC"|oclc=996426645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In August 1968, CAyC was established as a multidisciplinary workshop by [[Víctor Grippo]], [[Jacques Bedel]], [[Luis Fernando Benedit]], [[Alfredo Portillos]], [[Clorindo Testa]], [[Jorge Glusberg]], and [[Jorge González (artist)|Jorge González]].&lt;ref name=VictoriaAlbertMuseum-CAyC-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ravilious|first1=Ella|title=Centro de Arte y Comunicación (CAyC)|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/factory-presents/centro-de-arte-y-comunicacion-cayc|work=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]]|date=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jorge Glusberg was the main leader associated with CAyC.&lt;ref name=ImageTextConceptualArt-2016 /&gt;

In 1971, the "Grupo de los Trece" was created by Polish theater director [[Jerzy Grotowski]]. There were 13 artists who made up the group: [[Jacques Bedel]], [[Luis Fernándo Benedit]], [[Gregorio Dujovny]], [[Carlos Ginsburg]], [[Jorge Glusberg]], [[Victor Grippo]], [[Jorge González Mir]], [[Vicente Lucas Marotta]], [[Luis Pazos]], [[Alfredo Portillos]], [[Juan Carlos Romero (artist)|Juan Carlos Romero]], [[Julio Teich]], and [[Horacio Zabala]]. Additional artists who later joined were [[Leopoldo Maler]] and [[Clorindo Testa]]. In 1975, the group were formally named the "Grupo CAyC."&lt;ref name=BuenosAiresHerald-GlusbergAffair-2003&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tortosa|first1=Alina|title=The Glusberg affair in focus|url=http://alinatortosa.blogspot.com/2013/07/the-glusberg-affair-in-focus-jorge_25.html|work=[[Buenos Aires Herald]]|date=14 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was centered around the concept of "Arte de Sistemas" or Systemic Art.&lt;ref name=BuenosAiresHerald-GlusbergAffair-2003 /&gt;

In 1972, the "Scuola de Altos Estudios del CAyC" aka "Escuela de Altos Estudios" / "Escuela de Altos Estudios del Centro de Arte y Comunicación" was founded.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

In the seventies CAyC became an international center for the [[Pop art]]-culture and the famous Museo de Arquitectura.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Well-known teachers at CAyC have included [[Justus Dahinden]] and [[Mario Botta]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}

From 1968 until his death in early 2012, [[Jorge Glusberg]] was the Director of CAyC.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Green]] and [[Marian Petre]].  The dimensions can be used to evaluate the [[usability]] of an existing ''information artifact'', or as heuristics to guide the design of a new one.

Cognitive dimensions are designed to provide a lightweight approach to analyse the quality of a design, rather than an in-depth, detailed description.  They provide a common vocabulary for discussing many factors in notation, UI or programming language design.  Also, cognitive dimensions help in exploring the space of possible designs through ''design maneuvers'', changes intended to improve the design along one dimension.

==List of the cognitive dimensions==
Thomas Green originally defined 14 cognitive dimensions:

; Abstraction gradient : What are the minimum and maximum [[Abstraction (computer science)#Levels of abstraction|levels of abstraction]] exposed by the notation? Can details be [[Encapsulation (computer science)|encapsulated]]?

; Closeness of mapping : How closely does the notation correspond to the [[Problem domain|problem]] world?

; Consistency : After part of the notation has been [[Learnability|learned]], how much of the rest can be successfully guessed?

; Diffuseness / terseness : How many [[Symbol (formal)|symbol]]s or how much space does the notation require to produce a certain result or express a [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]]?

; Error-proneness : To what extent does the notation influence the likelihood of [[user error|the user making a mistake]]?

; Hard mental operations : How much [[mental effort|hard mental processing]] lies at the notational level, rather than at the [[semantic]] level? Are there places where the user needs to resort to fingers or penciled annotation to keep track of what’s happening?

; Hidden dependencies : Are [[Coupling (computer programming)|dependencies]] between entities in the notation visible or hidden? Is every dependency indicated in both directions? Does a change in one area of the notation lead to unexpected consequences?

; Juxtaposability : Can different parts of the notation be compared side-by-side at the same time?

; Premature commitment : Are there strong constraints on the order in which the user must complete the tasks to use the system?

:Are there decisions that must be made before all the necessary information is available? Can those decisions be reversed or corrected later?

; Progressive evaluation : How easy is it to evaluate and obtain [[feedback]] on an incomplete solution?

; Role-expressiveness : How obvious is the [[Role (computer science)|role]] of each component of the notation in the solution as a whole?

; Secondary notation and escape from formalism : Can the notation carry extra information [[Secondary notation|by means not related to syntax]], such as layout, color, or other cues?

; Viscosity
: Are there in the notation any inherent barriers to change? How much effort is required to make a change to a program expressed in the notation?
: This dimension can be further classified into the following types:&lt;ref&gt;[http://acm.org/sigchi/chi96/proceedings/shortpap/Wilde/wn_txt.html Using Cognitive Dimensions in the Classroom as a Discussion Tool for Visual Language Design]&lt;/ref&gt;
:* 'Knock-on viscosity' : a change in the code violates internal constraints in the program, whose resolution may violate further internal constraints.
:* 'Repetition viscosity' : a single action within the user’s conceptual model requires many, repetitive device actions.
:* 'Scope viscosity' : a change in the size of the input data set requires changes to the program structure itself.

; Visibility : How readily can required parts of the notation be identified, accessed and made visible?

===Other dimensions===
In addition to the above, new dimensions are sometimes proposed in the HCI research field,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dealing with New Cognitive Dimensions | citeseerx=10.1.1.18.7947 | first1 = Alan F. | last1 = Blackwell | author-link = Alan F. Blackwell }}&lt;/ref&gt; with different levels of adoption and refinement.

Some of these candidate dimensions include creative ambiguity (does the notation encourage interpreting several meanings of the same element?), indexing (are there elements to guide finding a specific part?), synopsis ("[[Gestalt psychology#Properties|gestalt view]]" of the whole annotated structure) or unevenness (some creation paths are easier than others, which bias the expressed ideas in a developed artifact).

== User activities ==
The authors identify four main user activities with interactive artifacts: ''incrementation'' [creation], ''transcription'', ''modification'' and ''exploratory design''. Each activity is best served by a different trade-off in the usability on each dimension. For example, a high viscosity (resistance to change) is harmful for modification and exploration activities, but less severe for the one-off tasks performed in transcription and incrementation.

== Design maneuvers ==
A '''design maneuver''' is a change made by the designer in the notation design, to alter its position within a particular dimension. Dimensions are created to be pairwise independent, so that the design can be altered in one dimension while keeping a second one constant.

But this usually results in a trade-off between dimensions. A modification increasing the usability of the notation in one dimension (while keeping a second one constant) will typically reduce its usability in a third dimension. This reflects an assumption in the framework that there is no perfect interface and that trade-offs are a fundamental part of usability design.

An example of a design maneuver is reducing the viscosity of a notation by adding abstraction mechanisms. This can be done by incorporating [[Style sheet (desktop publishing)|style sheets]], an abstraction that represent the common styling attributes of items in a document, to a notation where each item in a document has defined its own individual style. After this design maneuver is made, an editor that changes the style sheet will modify all items at once, eliminating the ''repetition viscosity'' present in the need to change the style of each individual item.

The segmentation algorithm partitioned the sequence and correctly identified 4 domains as compositionally homogeneous domains and 2 compositionally nonhomogeneous domains.{{Primary source inline|date=May 2012}}]]

A '''compositional domain''' in [[genetics]] is a region of [[DNA]] with a distinct [[guanine]] (G) and [[cytosine]] (C) G-C and C-G content (collectively [[GC content]]).&lt;ref name=pmid20571085&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/nar/gkq532 |title=Identifying compositionally homogeneous and nonhomogeneous domains within the human genome using a novel segmentation algorithm |year=2010 |last1=Elhaik |first1=Eran |last2=Graur |first2=Dan |last3=Josić |first3=Krešimir |last4=Landan |first4=Giddy |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=38 |issue=15 |pages=e158 |pmid=20571085 |pmc=2926622}}&lt;/ref&gt; The homogeneity of compositional domains is compared to that of the chromosome on which they reside. As such, compositional domains can be homogeneous or nonhomogeneous domains. Compositionally homogeneous domains that are sufficiently long (= 300 kb) are termed [[isochore (genetics)|isochores]] or isochoric domains.

The '''compositional domain model''' was proposed as an alternative to the [[isochoric model]]. The isochore model was proposed by Bernardi and colleagues to explain the observed non-uniformity of genomic fragments in the genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.4001930 |title=The mosaic genome of warm-blooded vertebrates |year=1985 |last1=Bernardi |first1=G |last2=Olofsson |first2=B |last3=Filipski |first3=J |last4=Zerial |first4=M |last5=Salinas |first5=J |last6=Cuny |first6=G |last7=Meunier-Rotival |first7=M |last8=Rodier |first8=F |journal=Science |volume=228 |issue=4702 |pages=953–8 |pmid=4001930|bibcode = 1985Sci...228..953B }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent sequencing of complete genomic data refuted the isochoric model. Its main predictions were:

* GC content of the third codon position (GC3) of protein coding genes is correlated with the GC content of the isochores embedding the corresponding genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0378-1119(01)00644-8 |title=Misunderstandings about isochores.

The compositional domain model describes the genome as a mosaic of short and long homogeneous and nonhomogeneous domains. The composition and organization of the domains were shaped by different evolutionary processes that either fused or broke down the domains.

"'''Dark as a Dungeon'''" is a song written by singer-songwriter [[Merle Travis]]. It is a lament about the danger and drudgery of being a coal miner in a [[shaft mine]].  It has become a rallying song among miners seeking improved working conditions.

The song achieved much of its fame when it was performed by [[Johnny Cash]] in his [[Folsom Prison]] concert (''[[At Folsom Prison]]''). During this live performance, one of the prisoners in the background was laughing, and Cash started to chuckle. He gently admonished the man, "No laughing during the song, please!" The man yelled something about "Hell!" and Cash answered, "I know, 'hell'!" When he finished the song, Cash made a comment that was largely repeated, somewhat out of context, by [[Joaquin Phoenix]] in the 2005 film ''[[Walk the Line]]'': "I just wanted to tell you that this show is being recorded for an album released on Columbia Records, so you can't say 'hell' or 'shit' or anything like that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gross|first1=Jason|title=Prisoners Are the Best Audience: The Challenge of 'At Folsom Prison'|url=https://www.popmatters.com/65735-prisoners-are-the-best-audience-the-challenge-of-at-folsom-prison-2496102536.html|accessdate=January 2, 2018|work=PopMatters|date=November 18, 2008|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''De Natura Deorum''''' ('''''On the Nature of the Gods''''') is a philosophical dialogue by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] orator [[Cicero]] written in 45 BC. It is laid out in three books, each of which discusses the theology of different Roman and [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]]. The dialogue uses a discussion of [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]], [[Stoicism|Stoic]], and [[Platonism|skeptical (Platonist)]] theories to examine fundamental questions of [[theology]].

==Writing==
''De Natura Deorum'' belongs to the group of philosophical works which Cicero wrote in the two years preceding his death in 43 BC.&lt;ref name="brooks1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states near the beginning of ''De Natura Deorum'' that he wrote them both as a relief from the political inactivity to which he was reduced by the supremacy of [[Julius Caesar]], and as a distraction from the grief caused by the death of his daughter [[Tullia (daughter of Cicero)|Tullia]].&lt;ref name="brooks1"/&gt;

The dialogue is supposed to take place in Rome at the house of [[Gaius Aurelius Cotta]].&lt;ref name="brooks4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the dialogue he appears as pontiff, but not as consul.&lt;ref name="brooks4"/&gt; He was made pontiff soon after 82 BC, and consul in 75 BC, and as Cicero, who is present at the dialogue as a listener, did not return from Athens till 77 BC, its fictional date can be set between the years 77 and 75 BC, when Cicero was about thirty years of age, and Cotta about forty-eight.&lt;ref name="brooks4"/&gt;

The book contains various obscurities and inconsistencies which demonstrate that it was probably never revised by Cicero, nor published until after his death.&lt;ref name="brooks5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the content, Cicero borrowed largely from earlier Greek sources.&lt;ref name="brooks5"/&gt; However, the hasty arrangement by Cicero of authorities who themselves wrote independently of one another means that the work lacks cohesion,&lt;ref name="brooks7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and points raised by one speaker are sometimes not countered by subsequent speakers.&lt;ref name="brooks6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The dialogue is on the whole narrated by Cicero himself, though he does not play an active part in the discussion. [[Gaius Velleius]] represents the Epicurean school, [[Quintus Lucilius Balbus]] argues for the Stoics, and [[Gaius Cotta]] speaks for Cicero's own [[Academic skepticism]]. The first book of the dialogue contains Cicero's introduction, Velleius' case for the Epicurean theology and Cotta's criticism of Epicureanism. Book II focuses on Balbus' explanation and defense of Stoic theology. Book III lays out Cotta's criticism of Balbus' claims. Cicero's conclusions are ambivalent and muted, "a strategy of civilized openness";&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Greenblatt]], ''[[The Swerve: How the World Became Modern]]'', 2011:69ff.&lt;/ref&gt; he does, however, conclude that Balbus' claims, in his mind, more nearly approximate the truth (3.95).

===Book 1===
In Book 1 Cicero visits the house of Cotta the [[Pontifex Maximus]], where he finds him with Velleius &amp;ndash; a Senator and Epicurean, and Balbus supporter of the Stoics. Cotta himself is an Academic, and he informs Cicero that they were discoursing on the nature of the gods. Velleius had been stating the sentiments of [[Epicurus]] upon the subject.&lt;ref name="dunlop244"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunlop|1827|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Velleius is requested to go on with his arguments after recapitulating what he had already said.&lt;ref name="dunlop244"/&gt; The discourse of Velleius consists of three parts: a general attack on [[Platonist]] and Stoic cosmology; a historical review of the earlier philosophers; and an exposition of Epicurean theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rackham|first=H.|title=Cicero: De Natura Deorum; Academica|page=xvi|publisher=Loeb Classical Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Velleius raises the difficulty of supposing the creation of the universe to have taken place at a particular period of time, and questions the possible motive of a God in undertaking the work.&lt;ref name="brooks6"/&gt; The historical section (10-15), is full of inaccuracies and mis-statements, of which it is likely that Cicero himself was ignorant, since he has Cotta later praise this account.&lt;ref name="brooks7"/&gt; The purpose however is for Velleius to show that the Epicurean idea of God as a [[Divine happiness|perfectly happy]], [[God and eternity|eternal being]], possessed of reason, and in human form, is the only tenable one, and the other differing opinions is regarded as proof of their worthlessness.&lt;ref name="brooks7"/&gt; In the remainder of the book, Cotta attacks the positions of Velleius with regard to the form of the gods, and their exemption from creation and providence.&lt;ref name="dunlop245"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunlop|1827|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book 2===
In Book 2, Balbus gives the Stoics position on the subject of the gods.&lt;ref name="dunlop245"/&gt; He alludes to the magnificence of the world, and the prevalence of belief, and refers to the frequent appearance of the gods themselves in history.&lt;ref name="dunlop245"/&gt; After referring to the practice of [[divination]], Balbus proceeds to the "four causes" of [[Cleanthes]] as to how the idea of the gods is implanted in the minds of people: (1) a pre-knowledge of future events; (2) the great advantages we enjoy from nature; (3) the terror with which the mind is affected by thunder, tempests, and the like; (4) and the order and regularity in the universe. Balbus further contends that the world, or universe itself, and its parts, are possessed of reason and wisdom.&lt;ref name="dunlop246"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunlop|1827|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finally discusses the creation of the world, the [[Divine providence|providence]] of the gods, and denies "that a world, so beautifully adorned, [[Teleological argument|could be formed by chance]], or by a fortuitous concourse of atoms."&lt;ref name="dunlop246"/&gt; The problem of [[Problem of evil|how to account for the presence of misery]] and disaster in a world providentially governed is only hurriedly touched upon at the end of the book.&lt;ref name="brooks8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book 3===
In book 3 Cotta refutes the doctrines of Balbus.&lt;ref name="dunlop247"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunlop|1827|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large portion of this book, probably more than one third, has been lost.&lt;ref name="brooks8"/&gt; Cotta represents the appearances of gods as idle tales.&lt;ref name="dunlop248"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunlop|1827|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; There follows a gap in the text, following which Cotta attacks the four causes of Cleanthes.&lt;ref name="dunlop248"/&gt; Cotta refutes the Stoic ideas on reason attributed to the universe and its parts.&lt;ref name="dunlop249"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunlop|1827|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten chapters (16-25) are devoted to a disproportionately lengthy discussion of [[mythology]], with examples multiplied to an inordinate extent.&lt;ref name="brooks9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; There follows another major gap in the text, at the end of which Cotta is seen attacking the doctrine of providential care for humans.&lt;ref name="dunlop249"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brooks9"/&gt; Cicero states "The conversation ended here, and we parted. Velleius judged that the arguments of Cotta were the truest, but those of Balbus seemed to me to have the greater probability."&lt;ref name="dunlop249"/&gt;

==Influence==
The Christian writers [[Tertullian]], [[Minucius Felix]], [[Lactantius]], and [[Augustine]] were acquainted with ''De Natura Deorum'', and their arguments against polytheism were largely borrowed from it.&lt;ref name="brooks10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This work, alongside ''[[De Officiis]]'' and ''[[De Divinatione]]'', was highly influential on the [[philosophes]] of the 18th century. [[David Hume]] was familiar with the work and used it to style his own ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Holden|first=Thomas|title=Spectres of Fasle Divinity: Hume's Moral Atheism|year=2010|page=28|publisher=Oxford Universoty Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voltaire]] described ''De Natura Deorum'' and the ''[[Tusculan Disputations]]'' as "the two most beautiful books ever produced by the wisdom of humanity".&lt;ref&gt;'Les deux plus beaux ouvrages qu’ait jamais écrits la sagesse qui n’est qu’humaine' [Voltaire, "Cicéron", ''Dictionnaire philosophique'' (1764); ''Œuvres complètes'' (Garnier) 18:181]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1811 a fourth book was 'discovered' and published by one 'P. Seraphinus' in [[Bologna]].&lt;ref name="farrer"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Farrer|first=James Anson|title=Literary Forgeries|pages=10-12|year=1907|publisher=Longmans, Green &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this forgery Cicero asserts many points compatible with Christian and Catholic dogma, and even argues in favour of an authority equivalent to the Papacy.&lt;ref name="farrer"/&gt;

==Scholarship==
This work, although not written by an orthodox Epicurean or Stoic, is important because it supplements the scant primary texts that remain from Epicureans and Stoics discussing their views on religion and theology. In particular, heated scholarly debate has focused on this text's discussion at 1.43-44 of how the Epicurean gods may be said to "exist"; David Sedley, for example, holds that Epicureans, as represented in this text and elsewhere, think that "gods are our own graphic [[Ideal (ethics)|idealization]] of the life to which we aspire",&lt;ref&gt;[[David Sedley]], ''Epicurus’ Theological Innatism.'' In Fish and Saunders 2011: 29-52&lt;/ref&gt; whereas David Konstan maintains that "the Epicurean gods are real, in the sense that they exist as atomic compounds and possess the properties that pertain to the concept, or prolēpsis, that people have of them."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Konstan]], ''Epicurus on the Gods''. In Fish and Saunders 2011: 53-71&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==
* There is in fact no subject upon which so much difference of opinion exists, not only among the unlearned but also among educated men; and the views entertained are so various and so discrepant, that, while it is no doubt a possible alternative that none of them is true, it is certainly impossible that more than one should be so. (''{{lang|la|Res enim nulla est, de qua tantopere non solum indocti, sed etiam docti dissentiant; quorum opiniones cum tam variae sint tamque inter se dissidentes, alterum fieri profecto potest, ut earum nulla, alterum certe non potest, ut plus una vera sit}}'') (I, 5)

(''{{lang|la|Ut vinum aegrotis, quia prodest raro, nocet saepissime, melius est non adhibere omnino quam spe dubiae salutis in apertam perniciem incurrere, sic haud scio, an melius fuerit humano generi motum istum celerem cogitationis, acumen, sollertiam, quam rationem vocamus, quoniam pestifera sit multis, admodum paucis salutaris, non dari omnino quam tam munifice et tam large dari.}}'') (III, 69)

The '''Efficiency Movement''' was a major movement in the United States, Britain and other industrial nations in the early 20th century that sought to identify and eliminate waste in all areas of the economy and society, and to develop and implement best practices.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel T. Rodgers, ''Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; The concept covered mechanical, economic, social, and personal improvement.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Haber, ''Efficiency and Uplift: Scientific Management in the Progressive Era, 1890–1920'' (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; The quest for efficiency promised effective, dynamic management rewarded by growth.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer K. Alexander, ''The Mantra of Efficiency: From Waterwheel to Social Control'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the influence of an early proponent, it is more often known as [[Taylorism]].

==United States==
The Efficiency Movement played a central role in the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States, where it flourished 1890–1932.&lt;ref&gt;Haber (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents argued that all aspects of the economy, society and government were riddled with waste and inefficiency.  Everything would be better if experts identified the problems and fixed them.  The result was strong support for building research universities and schools of business and engineering, municipal research agencies, as well as reform of hospitals and medical schools, and the practice of farming.&lt;ref&gt;W. J. Spillman, "The Efficiency Movement in Its Relation to Agriculture," ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,'' Vol. 59, (May, 1915), pp. 65–76 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1012894 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the best known leaders were engineers [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] (1856–1915), who used a stopwatch to identify the smallest inefficiencies, and [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr.]] (1868–1924) who proclaimed there was always "one best way" to fix a problem.

Leaders such as [[Herbert Croly]], [[Charles R. van Hise]] and [[Richard T. Ely|Richard Ely]] sought to improve governmental performance by training experts in public service comparable to those in Germany, notably at the Universities of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Schools of business administration set up management programs oriented toward efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Morris, "The Wisconsin Idea and Business Progressivism," ''Journal of American Studies,'' April 1970, Vol. 4#1 pp 39–60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Municipal and state efficiency===
Many cities set up "efficiency bureaus" to identify waste and apply the best practices.  For example, Chicago created an Efficiency Division (1910–16) within the city government's Civil Service Commission, and private citizens organized the Chicago Bureau of Public Efficiency (1910–32).  The former pioneered the study of "personal efficiency," measuring employees' performance through new scientific merit systems and efficiency movement &lt;ref&gt;Mordecai Lee, ''Bureaus of Efficiency: Reforming Local Government in the Progressive Era,'' (Marquette University Press, 2008) {{ISBN|978-0-87462-081-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State governments were active as well. For example, Massachusetts set up its "Commission on Economy and Efficiency" in 1912.  It made hundreds of recommendations.&lt;ref name="books.google"&gt;Commission on Economy and Efficiency, ''Annual report of the Commission on Economy and Efficiency'' (Boston, 1913), p 76 [https://books.google.com/books?id=dWQNAAAAYAAJ  online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philanthropy===
Leading philanthropists such as [[Andrew Carnegie]]&lt;ref&gt;Abigail A. Van Slyck, ''Free to All: Carnegie Libraries &amp; American Culture, 1890–1920'' (1998) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John D. Rockefeller]] actively promoted the efficiency movement.  In his many philanthropic pursuits, Rockefeller believed in supporting efficiency.  He once said,
:"To help an inefficient, ill-located, unnecessary school is a waste ...it is highly probable that enough money has been squandered on unwise educational projects to have built up a national system of higher education adequate to our needs, if the money had been properly directed to that end."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/17090 John D. Rockefeller, ''Random Reminiscences of Men and Events'' (1933)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservation===
The [[Conservation in the United States|conservation movement]] regarding national resources came to prominence during the Progressive Era.  According to historian [[Samuel P. Hays]], the conservation movement was based on the "gospel of the efficiency.".&lt;ref&gt;Samuel P. Hays, ''Conservation and the Gospel of Efficiency: The Progressive Conservation Movement 1890–1920'' (1959).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Massachusetts Commission on Economy and Efficiency reflected the new concern with conservation. It said in 1912:
:"The only proper basis for the protection of game birds, wild fowl and, indeed, all animals is an economic one, and must be based upon carefully constructed and properly enforced laws for the conservation of all species for the benefit of future generations of our citizens, rather than based on local opinion....This expenditure for the protection of fish and game is clearly a wise economy, tending to prevent the annihilation of birds and other animals valuable to mankind which might otherwise become extinct.  It may be said that Massachusetts and her sister States have suffered irreparable loss by carelessly allowing, for generations past, indiscriminate waste of animal life."&lt;ref name="books.google" /&gt;

[[Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] was the nation's foremost conservationist, putting the issue high on the national agenda by emphasizing the need to eliminate wasteful uses of limited natural resources. He worked with all the major figures of the movement, especially his chief advisor on the matter,  [[Gifford Pinchot]].  Roosevelt was deeply committed to conserving natural resources, and is considered to be the nation's first [[conservation biology|conservation]] President.&lt;ref&gt;W. Todd Benson, ''President Theodore Roosevelt's Conservation Legacy'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:TR-Enviro.JPG|thumb|325px|left|1908 US editorial cartoon on Theodore Roosevelt and conservation]]

In 1908, Roosevelt sponsored the [[Conference of Governors]] held in the White House, with a focus on natural resources and their most efficient use. Roosevelt delivered the opening address: "Conservation as a National Duty."

In contrast, environmentalist [[John Muir]] promulgated a very different view of conservation, rejecting the efficiency motivation. Muir instead preached that nature was sacred and humans are intruders who should look but not develop. Working through the [[Sierra Club]] he founded, Muir tried to minimize commercial use of water resources and forests.&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Nash, ''Wilderness and the American Mind'' (3rd ed. 1982), pp 122–40&lt;/ref&gt;  While Muir wanted nature preserved for the sake of pure beauty, Roosevelt subscribed to Pinchot's formulation, "to make the forest produce the largest amount of whatever crop or service will be most useful, and keep on producing it for generation after generation of men and trees." &lt;ref&gt;Gifford Pinchot, ''Breaking New Ground,'' (1947) p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===National politics===
In U.S. national politics, the most prominent figure was [[Herbert Hoover]], a trained engineer who downplayed politics and believed dispassionate, nonpolitical experts could solve the nation's great problems, such as ending poverty.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Barber, ''From new era to New Deal: Herbert Hoover, the economists, and American economic policy, 1921–1933'' (1989) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks on efficiency===
After 1929, [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] blamed the [[Great Depression]] on Hoover and helped to somewhat discredit the movement, though the demand for efficiency and elimination of waste remains an important component of American values.

===Antitrust===
Boston lawyer [[Louis Brandeis]] (1856–1941) argued bigness conflicted with efficiency and added a new political dimension to the Efficiency Movement. For instance, while fighting against legalized price fixing, Brandeis launched an effort to influence congressional policymaking with the help of his friend [[Norman Hapgood]], who was then the editor of [[Harper's Weekly]]. He coordinated the publication of a series of articles (''Competition Kills'', ''Efficiency and the One-Price Article'', and ''How Europe deals with the one-price goods''), which were also distributed by the lobbying group American Fair Trade League to legislators, [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] justices, governors, and twenty national magazines.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prophets of Regulation|last=McCraw|first=Thomas|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2009|isbn=0674716086|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=103-104}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his works, he was asked to speak before a congressional committee considering the price-fixing bill he drafted. Here, he stated that "big business is not more efficient than little business" and that "it is a mistake to suppose that the department stores can do business cheaper than the little dealer."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Brandeis ideas on which business is most efficient conflicted with Croly's positions, which favored efficiency driven by a kind of consolidation gained through large-scale economic operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Herbert Croly of the New Republic: The Life and Thought of an American Progressive|last=Levy|first=David|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1985|isbn=0691047251|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=157-158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1895 Brandeis had warned of the harm that giant corporations could do to competitors, customers, and their own workers. The growth of industrialization was creating mammoth companies which he felt threatened the well-being of millions of Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin I. Urofsky, ''Louis D. Brandeis: a life'' (2009) pp 300–26&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''The Curse of Bigness'' he argued, "Efficiency means greater production with less effort and at less cost, through the elimination of unnecessary waste, human and material. How else can we hope to attain our social ideals?."&lt;ref&gt;Louis Brandeis, ''The curse of bigness: miscellaneous papers of Louis D. Brandeis'' edited by Osmond Kessler Fraenkel and Clarence Martin Lewis, (1965) p 51&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued against an appeal to Congress by the state-regulated railroad industry in 1910 seeking an increase in rates. Brandeis explained that instead of passing along increased costs to the consumer, the railroads should pursue efficiency by reducing their overhead and streamlining their operations, initiatives that were unprecedented during the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Efficient Society: Why Canada Is As Close To Utopia As It Gets|last=Heath|first=Joseph|publisher=Penguin Canada|year=2002|isbn=0140292489|location=Toronto|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Bedaux system===
The Bedaux system, developed by Franco-American [[management consultant]] [[Charles Bedaux]] (1886–1944) built on the work of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|F.W. Taylor]] and [[Charles Edward Knoeppel|Charles E. Knoeppel]].&lt;ref name=Brech&gt;[[Edward Francis Leopold Brech]], ''Productivity in Perspective, 1914-1974'' (Bristol: Thoemmes Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weatherburn&gt;Michael R. Weatherburn, 'Scientific Management at Work: the Bedaux System, Management Consulting, and Worker Efficiency in British Industry, 1914-48' (Imperial College PhD thesis, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Its distinctive advancement beyond these earlier thinkers was the [[Bedaux Unit]] or ''B'', a universal measure for all manual work.&lt;ref name=Littler&gt;Craig R.

===Relation to other movements===
Later movements had echoes of the Efficiency Movement and were more directly inspired by Taylor and [[Taylorism]].  [[Technocracy movement|Technocracy]], for instance, more of a fad than a movement, and others flourished in the 1930s and 1940s.

Postmodern opponents of nuclear energy in the 1970s broadened their attack to try to discredit movements that saw salvation for human society in technical expertise alone, or which held that scientists or engineers had any special expertise to offer in the political realm.

Coming into usage in 1990, the Western term [[Lean manufacturing]] (lean enterprise, lean production, or simply "Lean") refers to a business idea that considered the expenditure of resources for anything other than the creation of value for the end customer to be wasteful, and thus a target for elimination. Today the Lean concept is broadening to include a greater range of strategic goals, not just cost-cutting and efficiency.

==Britain==
In engineering, the concept of efficiency was developed in Britain in the mid-18th century by [[John Smeaton]] (1724–1792). Called the "father of civil engineering", he studied water wheels and steam engines.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander (2008) ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 19th century there was much talk about improving the efficiency of the administration and economic performance of the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold White, ''Efficiency and empire'' (1901) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ANUBAAAAMAAJ  online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Efficiency''' was an attempt to discredit the old-fashioned habits, customs and institutions that put the British at a handicap in competition with the world, especially with Germany,&lt;ref&gt;W.H. Dawson, ''The German Workman: a Study in National Efficiency'' (1906) [https://books.google.com/books?id=HoxNAAAAMAAJ online]&lt;/ref&gt; which was seen as the epitome of efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. R. Searle]], ''The Quest for National Efficiency, 1899–1914: A Study in Politics and Political Thought'' (Oxford UP, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, "National Efficiency" became a powerful demand&amp;nbsp;— a  movement supported by prominent figures across the political spectrum who disparaged sentimental humanitarianism and identified waste as a mistake that could no longer be tolerated.  The movement took place in two waves; the first wave from 1899 to 1905 was made urgent by the inefficiencies and failures in the [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902).  ''Spectator'' magazine reported in 1902 there was "a universal outcry for efficiency in all departments of society, in all aspects of life".&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Searle, "The Politics of National Efficiency and of War, 1900–1918" in Chris Wrigley, ed.,  ''A Companion to Early 20th-Century Britain'' (Blackwell, 2003) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;  The two most important themes were technocratic efficiency and managerial efficiency.  As White (1899) argued vigorously, the empire needed to be put on a business footing and administered to get better results.  The looming threat of Germany, which was widely seen as a much more efficient nation, added urgency after 1902.  Politically National Efficiency brought together modernizing Conservatives and Unionists, Liberals who wanted to bring modernize their party, and [[Fabian Society|Fabians]] such as [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[H. G. Wells]], along with [[Beatrice Webb|Beatrice]] and [[Sidney Webb]], who had outgrown socialism and saw the utopia of a scientifically up-to-date society supervised by experts such as themselves.  Churchill in 1908 formed an alliance with the Webbs, announcing the goal of a "National Minimum", covering hours, working conditions, and wages&amp;nbsp;– it was a safety net below which the individual would not be allowed to fall.&lt;ref&gt;James T. Kloppenberg, ''Uncertain Victory: Social Democracy and Progressivism in European and American Thought, 1870–1920'' (1988) p 475&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Pelling, ''Winston Churchill'' (1989) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Representative legislation included the [[Education Act 1902|Education Act of 1902]], which emphasized the role of experts in the schools system.  Higher education was an important initiative, typified by the growth of the [[London School of Economics]], and the foundation of [[Imperial College]].&lt;ref&gt;Searle (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a pause in the movement between 1904 and 1909, when interest resumed.  The most prominent new leaders included Liberals [[Winston Churchill]] and [[David Lloyd George]], whose influence brought a bundle of reform legislation that introduced the welfare state to Britain.

Much of the popular and elite support for National Efficiency grew out of concern for Britain's military position, especially with respect to Germany.  The Royal Navy underwent a dramatic modernization, most famously in the introduction of the ''[[Dreadnought]]'', which in 1906 revolutionized naval warfare overnight.

==Germany==
In Germany the efficiency movement was called "rationalization" and it was a powerful social and economic force before 1933. In part it looked explicitly at American models, especially [[Fordism]].&lt;ref&gt;Mary Nolan, "Housework Made Easy: the Taylorized Housewife in Weimar Germany's Rationalized Economy," ''Feminist Studies.'' Volume: 16. Issue: 3. pp 549+&lt;/ref&gt; The Bedaux system was widely adopted in the rubber and tire industry, despite strong resistance in the socialist labor movement to the Bedaux system. [[Continental AG]], the leading rubber company in Germany, adopted the system and profited heavily from it, thus surviving the Great Depression relatively undamaged and improving its competitive capabilities. However most German businessmen preferred the home-grown '''REFA system''' which focused on the standardization of working conditions, tools, and machinery.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Erker, "Das Bedaux-System: Neue Aspekte der Historischen Rationalisierungsforschung,["The Bedaux system: new aspects of research on the history of rationalization"], ''Zeitschrift für Unternehmensgeschichte,'' 1996, Vol. 41#2 pp 139–158&lt;/ref&gt;

"Rationalization" meant higher productivity and greater efficiency, promising science would bring prosperity. More generally it promised a new level of modernity and was applied to economic production and consumption as well as public administration. Various versions of rationalization were promoted by industrialists and Social Democrats, by engineers and architects, by educators and academics, by middle class feminists and social workers, by government officials and politicians of many parties. It was ridiculed by the extremists in the Communist movement. As ideology and practice, rationalization challenged and transformed not only machines, factories, and vast business enterprises but also the lives of middle-class and working-class Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Nolan (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet Union==
Ideas of Science Management was very popular in the Soviet Union. One of the leading theorists and practitioners of the Scientific Management in Soviet Russia was [[Alexei Gastev]]. The [[Central Institute of Labour]] (Tsentralnyi Institut Truda, or TsIT), founded by Gastev in 1921 with [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s support, was a veritable citadel of socialist Taylorism.
Fascinated by Taylorism and Fordism, Gastev has led a popular movement for the “scientific organization of labor” (Nauchnaya Organizatsiya Truda, or NOT).
Because of its emphasis on the cognitive components of labor, some scholars consider Gastev’s NOT to represent a [[Karl Marx|Marxian]] variant of cybernetics. As with the concept of 'Organoprojection' (1919) by [[Pavel Florensky]], underlying [[Nikolai Bernstein]] and Gastev's approach, lay a powerful man-machine metaphor.

==Japan==
[[W. Edwards Deming]] (1900–1993) brought the efficiency movement to Japan after World War II, teaching top management how to improve design (and thus service), product quality, testing and sales (the last through global markets), especially using statistical methods.  Deming then brought his methods back to the U.S. in the form of quality control called [[continuous improvement process]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Gabor, ''The Man Who Discovered Quality: How W. Edwards Deming Brought the Quality Revolution to America'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Embodied music cognition''' is a direction within [[systematic musicology]] interested in studying the role of the human body in relation to all musical activities.

It considers the human body as the natural mediator between mind (focused on musical intentions, meanings, significations) and physical environment (containing musical sound and other types of energy that affords human action).

== Introduction ==
Given the impact of body movement on musical meaning formation and signification, the musical mind is said to be embodied. [[Embodied philosophy|Embodiment]]  assumes that what happens in the mind is depending on properties of the body, such as kinaesthetic properties.

Embodied music cognition tends to see music perception as based on action. For example, many people move when they listen to music. Through movement, it is assumed that people give meaning to music. This type of meaning-formation is corporeal, rather than cerebral because it is understood through the body. This is different from a disembodied approach to music cognition, which sees musical meaning as being based on a perception-based analysis of musical structure. The embodied grounding of music perception is based on a multi-modal encoding of auditory information and on principles that ensure the coupling of perception and action.

During the last decade, research in embodied music cognition 
has been strongly motivated by a demand for new tools in view of the interactive possibilities offered by digital media technology.

With the advent of powerful computing tools, and in particular real-time interactive music systems, gradually more attention has been devoted to the role of gesture in music. This [[musical gestures]] research has been rather influential in that it puts more emphasis on
sensorimotor feedback and integration, as well as on the coupling
of perception and action. With new sensor technology, gesture-based research has meanwhile become a vast domain of music research, with consequences for the methodological and [[epistemological]] foundations of music cognition research.

==Method==
The scientific apparatus draws upon an empirical and evidence-based methodology, which is based on measurement of sound (via audio-recording), human movement (via video-recording, kinematic recording), human biology (via bioparameter-recording) and [[semantics]] (via questionnaires). Using a scientific apparatus for measurement, statistical analysis and computational modelling, embodied music cognition aims to build up reliable knowledge about the role of the human body in meaning formation.

==Applications==
Research in embodied music cognition has a strong connection with technology development, more particularly, in fields related to interactive music systems, and music information retrieval. Mediation technology is the technology by which the human body, and consequently also the human mind, can be given an extension in the digital musical domain.

==How it is distinct from (disembodied) music cognition==
[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]] had a tremendous impact on cognitive science and in particular on cognitive musicology.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Influenced by [[Gestalt psychology]], [[music cognition]] research of the last decades of the 20th Century was mainly focusing on the perception of structure, that is, the perception of [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[melody]], [[rhythm]], [[harmony]] and [[tonality]]. It considered music perception as a faculty on its own, completely dissociated from musical action.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Instead, in studies on embodied musical activity (such as listening and music performance), subjects are invited to actively engage in the [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]] process. This engagement is articulated by means of corporeal expression which can be measured, analyzed, modelled and related to the musical stimulus. [[René Descartes]]' idea that mental activity is of a separate order from body movement is refuted and, in fact reversed.

==How it is distinct from traditional musicology==
The difference with the traditional phenomenological and hermeneutic approaches to musical meaning formation is that embodied music cognition has a focus on an empirical and evidence-based methodology, rather than on subjective first-person descriptions. Embodied music cognition aims at giving a full account of the subjective involvement by taking into account the role of the social-cultural context, subjective background (involving gender, age, familiarity with music, degree of music education).

Embodied music cognition adopts a scientific methodology but its aim is not to reduce music to physics, nor to reduce gesture and embodied meaning to the biomechanics of the human body. Instead, embodied music cognition fully recognizes the contribution of all mental and bodily systems including subjective feelings, emotions and coinaesthetic (or body image) awareness.

{{Eurocodes}}
The '''eurocodes''' are the ten European standards (EN; harmonised technical rules) specifying how [[Structural engineering|structural design]] should be conducted within the [[European Union]] (EU). These were developed by the [[European Committee for Standardization|European Committee for Standardisation]] upon the request of the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref name="EN1990"&gt;EN 1990:2002 E, Eurocode - Basis of Structural Design, CEN, November 29, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the eurocodes is to provide:&lt;ref name="EN1990"/&gt;
* a means to prove compliance with the requirements for mechanical strength and stability and safety in case of fire established by European Union law.&lt;ref name="89-106-EEC"&gt;European Council Directive 89/106/EEC&lt;/ref&gt;
* a basis for construction and engineering contract specifications.
* a framework for creating harmonized technical specifications for building products ([[CE mark]]).

By March 2010 the Eurocodes are mandatory for the specification of European public works and are intended to become the de facto standard for the private sector.  The Eurocodes therefore replace the existing national [[building code]]s  published by national standard bodies (e.g. [[BS 5950]]), although many countries had a period of co-existence. Additionally, each country is expected to issue a National Annex to the Eurocodes which will need referencing for a particular country (e.g. The UK National Annex). At present take up of Eurocodes is slow on private sector projects and existing national codes are still widely used by engineers.

==History==
In 1975, the [[European Commission|Commission of the European Community]] (presently the European Commission), decided on an action programme in the field of construction, based on article 95 of the Treaty. The objective of the programme was to eliminate technical obstacles to trade and the harmonisation of technical specifications. Within this action programme, the Commission took the initiative to establish a set of harmonised technical
rules for the design of construction works which, in a first would serve as an alternative to the national rules in force in the [[Member state of the European Union|member states]] of the [[European Union]] (EU) and, ultimately, would replace them. For fifteen years, the Commission, with the help of a steering committee with representatives of the member states, conducted the development of the Eurocodes programme, which led to the first generation of European codes in the 1980s.

In 1989, the Commission and the member states of the EU and the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) decided, on the basis of an agreement between the Commission and to transfer the preparation and the publication of the Eurocodes to the [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN) through a series of mandates, in order to provide them with a future status of European Standard (EN). This links de facto the Eurocodes with the provisions of all the Council's Directives and/or Commission's Decisions dealing with European standards (e.g. the Council Directive 89/1 06/EEC on construction products - CPD and Council Directives 93/37/EEC, 921S0lEEC and 89/440lEEC on public works and services and equiva1ent EFTA Directives initiated in pursuit of setting up the internal market).

All of the EN Eurocodes relating to materials have a Part 1-1 which covers the design of buildings and other civil engineering structures and a Part 1-2 for fire design. The codes for concrete, steel, composite steel and concrete, and timber structures and earthquake resistance have a Part 2 covering design of bridges. These Parts 2 should be used in combination with the appropriate general Parts (Parts 1).

{{ForensicScience}}
'''Forensic Podiatry''' is a subdiscipline of [[forensic science]] in which specialized podiatric knowledge including foot and lower limb anatomy, musculoskeletal function, deformities and [[diseases of the foot]], [[ankle]], lower extremities, and at times, the entire human body is used in the examination of foot-related evidence in the context of a criminal investigation. Forensic Podiatry has been defined as:

:''"The application of sound and researched podiatry knowledge and experience in forensic investigations, to show the association of an individual with a scene of crime, or to answer any other legal question concerned with the foot or footwear that requires knowledge of the functioning foot" (Vernon &amp; McCourt, 1999)''

Those who specialize in this field need to have gained knowledge and experience in podiatry and also in forensic science and practice (Vernon et al., 2009).

Forensic Podiatry is usually used to assist in the process of human identification, but can also be employed to help address issues relating to questions that have arisen within the context of forensic enquiry. Such questions could include whether or not a shoe could have had multiple wearers, what the effects of a shoe not fitting correctly could have been, whether or not someone could have placed their foot into a shoe that was too small for the postulated wearer’s foot and other matters involving the podiatric interpretation of relevant evidential materials.

'''Areas of practice'''

There are currently four areas of forensic podiatry practice. These usually involve the analysis and interpretation in a forensic context of:

Bare footprints (both static and dynamic prints)

Footwear (specifically the consideration of features of wear and fit)

Podiatrists clinical records

Gait analysis (usually covering the examination of the gait forms of persons captured on closed circuity television [CCTV], but also covering the analysis of the sequences of footprints at a crime scene)

(DiMaggio and Vernon, 2017)

'''Methods'''

Forensic podiatry techniques usually follow the ACE-V approach used widely in forensic science and practice (DiMaggio and Vernon, 2011). Here, ACE is the acronym for the Analysis, Comparison and Evaluation of an item of evidence with exemplar or reference material (such as a shoe, bare footprint or recording of a suspect’s gait). Verification is about the independent working through of that same material by a peer forensic specialist to confirm whether or not they reach the same conclusions as the reporting specialist.

Physical evidence is generally understood to exist at two levels which have been described as demonstrating class and identification level characteristics (DiMaggio and Vernon, 2017). Class level characteristics demonstrate consistency and compatibility, not uniqueness, which identification level characteristics are those which are understood to be unique (REF). Forensic podiatrists currently work with class level features alone although some of those features can demonstrate high levels of individuality (DiMaggio and Vernon, 2017).

Given that forensic podiatrists currently deal with class level characteristics alone, their work would not in itself usually result in the incontrovertible identification of someone unless the situation is one in which a closed population (that is one in which there is a limited number of possible people to consider when considering the possibility of a match or mismatch between two evidential items from a podiatric perspective).

The evidential materials that would be considered by forensic podiatrists can sometimes fall within the specialist understanding of other disciplines. For example, forensic gait analysis case work has been undertaken by human movement scientists and the knowledge involved in forensic gait analysis is that possessed by some physical therapists and orthopedic specialists as well as podiatrists (DiMaggio and Vernon, 2017).

Similarly, some evidential material of interest to forensic podiatrists is also of interest to other forensic specialists (particularly forensic marks examiners) although from their own particular perspectives (DiMaggio and Vernon, 2017) and forensic podiatrists always need to consider the potential for multidisciplinary considerations/collaborations.

'''Key historic developments'''

In 1972, Dr Norman Gunn DPM, a Podiatric Physician from Canada was the first podiatrist worldwide to undertake forensic podiatry case work (Vernon, 2006).

In 1989, Dr Wesley Vernon PhD, a podiatrist from the UK began to undertake research in forensic podiatry and later began to undertake case work from the mid 1990s.

In the early 1990s, Dr John DiMaggio DPM, a Podiatric Physician began to undertake forensic podiatry case work in the US.

In September 2003, an organization was formed - the American Society of Forensic Podiatry.

In 2007, the Council for the Registration of Forensic Practitioners (CRFP) developed a competency test for forensic podiatrists in the UK. The CRFP is no longer in existence, but this testing process was developed further by the Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences (CSFS) in the UK and is available for those practising in this field.

In July 2007, a forensic [[podiatry]] science and practice subcommittee was established within the structure of the [[International Association for Identification]] (IAI).

In 2009, the IAI published a document defining the role and scope of practise for forensic podiatrists (Vernon et al., 2009)

In 2011 a M level course in forensic podiatry was developed at the University of Huddersfield in the UK. This was later developed further into a full MSc course in forensic podiatry at that university.

In 2011, the first forensic podiatry textbook was written (DiMaggio and Vernon, 2011). In 2017, a much more comprehensive, updated 2nd edition of this book was published (DiMaggio and Vernon, 2017)

In 2013 a [[Forensic Podiatry]] group was started at the [[New York College of Podiatric Medicine]].

In 2013, a student forensic [[podiatry]] group was started at [[Temple University School of Podiatric Medicine]].

In 2014, the forensic podiatry approach to bare footprint analysis was found to meet the US the United States Supreme Court’s standard of admissibility through a Daubert hearing (Nirenberg, 2016)

'''Contemporary developments'''

In 2016, a Forensic Podiatry Club was started at the Barry University School of Podiatric Medicine.

A formal class covering aspects of [[Forensic Podiatry]] is being held at [[New York College of Podiatric Medicine]] (open to [[Podiatrist]] candidate)s. Students exit the class with an in depth knowledge of [[Forensic Podiatry]] and other legal knowledge applicable to current cases.

In 2017, at the behest of the UK Regulator for Forensic Science, standards of practice for forensic gait analysis are being written and at the time of writing a draft document has been put out for consultation. It is anticipated that these will be completed in early 2018.

==Age of formation==
There are several theories about how and when gender identity forms, and studying the subject is difficult because children's [[Language acquisition|lack of language]] requires researchers to make assumptions from indirect evidence.&lt;ref name="Boles101102"&gt;Boles, 2013. Pages 101-102.&lt;/ref&gt; John Money suggested children might have awareness of, and attach some significance to gender, as early as 18 months to two years; Lawrence Kohlberg argues that gender identity does not form until age three.&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt; It is widely agreed that core gender identity is firmly formed by age three.&lt;ref name="Kalbfleisch and Cody"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallagher"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A few authorities say it forms between ages 3-4 rather than precisely at age 3, e.g. George J. Bryjak and Michael P. Soraka, ''Sociology: Cultural Diversity in a Changing World'' (ed. Karen Hanson), Allyn &amp; Bacon, 1997; 209-245&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, children can make firm statements about their gender&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newmann"/&gt; and tend to choose activities and toys which are considered appropriate for their gender&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt; (such as dolls and painting for girls, and tools and rough-housing for boys),&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Bates Doob, ''Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society''&lt;/ref&gt; although they do not yet fully understand the implications of gender.&lt;ref name="Newmann"/&gt; After age three, core gender identity is extremely difficult to change,&lt;ref name="Kalbfleisch and Cody"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleeman"/&gt; and attempts to reassign it can result in [[gender dysphoria]].&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Coleman, ''Developmental stages of the coming out process'', in ''Journal of homosexuality'', 1982: "Core gender and sex-role identities are well-formed by the age of 3 (Money &amp; Ehrhardt, 1972). This is believed because attempts to reassign gender identity after age 3 result in further gender dysphoria."&lt;/ref&gt; Gender identity refinement extends into the fourth&lt;ref name="Kleeman"&gt;J. A. Kleeman, ''The establishment of core gender identity in normal girls. I.(a) Introduction;(b) Development of the ego capacity to differentiate'', in the ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'', 1971: "Though gender identity formation continues into young adulthood and core gender identity establishment extends into the fourth year and possibly longer, core gender identity is fairly firmly formed by age 3[.]"&lt;/ref&gt; to sixth years of age,&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stein MT, Zucker KJ, Dixon SD. December, 1997. "Gender Identity", ''The Nurse Practitioner''. Vo. 22, No. 12, P. 104&lt;/ref&gt; and continues into young adulthood.&lt;ref name="Kleeman"/&gt;

Martin and Ruble conceptualize this process of development as three stages: (1) as toddlers and preschoolers, children learn about defined characteristics, which are socialized aspects of gender; (2) around the ages of 5–7 years, identity is consolidated and becomes rigid; (3) after this "peak of rigidity," fluidity returns and socially defined gender roles relax somewhat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = C. | last2 = Ruble | first2 = D. | year = 2004 | title = Children's Search for Gender Cues Cognitive Perspectives on Gender Development | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 13| issue = 2|pages = 67–70 | doi = 10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00276.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Newmann breaks it down into four parts: (1) understanding the concept of gender, (2) learning [[gender role]] standards and stereotypes, (3) identifying with parents, and (4) forming gender preference.&lt;ref name="Newmann"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newmann|first=Barbara|title=Development Through Life: A Psychosocial Approach|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9781111344665|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oTY_7osGmqUC|date=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to UN agencies, discussions relating to comprehensive sexuality education raise awareness of topics, such as gender and gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: An evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors influencing formation==

===Nature vs. nurture===
{{Main|Nature versus nurture}}

Although the formation of gender identity is not completely understood, many factors have been suggested as influencing its development. In particular, the extent to which it is determined by socialization (environmental factors) versus innate (biological) factors is an ongoing debate in psychology, known as "nature versus nurture". Both factors are thought to play a role. Biological factors that influence gender identity include pre- and post-natal hormone levels.&lt;ref name="ZhongNan"&gt;''Effects of male sex hormones on gender identity, sexual behavior, and cognitive function'', ''Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao, Yi Xue Ban'' (''Journal of Central South University, Medical Sciences''), April 2006, 31(2):149-61&lt;/ref&gt; While genetic makeup also influences gender identity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Money | first1 = John | authorlink = John Money | year = 1994 | title = The concept of gender identity disorder in childhood and adolescence after 39 years | url = | journal = Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 163–77 | pmid = 7996589 | doi = 10.1080/00926239408403428 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it does not inflexibly determine it.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Golombok, Robyn Fivush, ''Gender Development'' (1994, {{ISBN|0521408628}}), page 44: "When assigned and raised as boys, these genetic girls adopt a male gender identity and role, showing that a Y chromosome is not necessary for gender development to proceed in a male direction."&lt;/ref&gt;

Social factors which may influence gender identity include ideas regarding gender roles conveyed by family, authority figures, mass media, and other influential people in a child's life.&lt;ref name="Henslin"&gt;{{cite book|title=Essentials of Sociology|first=James M.|last=Henslin|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2001|pages=65–67, 240|isbn=978-0-536-94185-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; When children are raised by individuals who adhere to stringent gender roles, they are more likely to behave in the same way, matching their gender identity with the corresponding stereotypical gender patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/factors-influencing-gender-identity/|title=Factors Influencing Gender Identity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Language also plays a role: children, while learning a language, learn to separate masculine and feminine characteristics and subconsciously adjust their own behavior to these predetermined roles.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Michael, "Cultural Identity, Language Identity, Gender Identity", "The English Academy of South Africa", 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The [[social learning theory]] posits that children furthermore develop their gender identity through observing and imitating gender-linked behaviors, and then being rewarded or punished for behaving that way,&lt;ref name=myers&gt;Myers, David G. (2008). ''Psychology''. New York: Worth.&lt;/ref&gt; thus being shaped by the people surrounding them through trying to imitate and follow them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = C.

A well-known example in the nature versus nurture debate is the case of [[David Reimer]], otherwise known as "John/Joan". As a baby, Reimer went through a faulty circumcision, losing his male genitalia. Psychologist John Money convinced Reimer's parents to raise him as a girl. Reimer grew up as a girl, dressing in girl clothes and surrounded by girl toys, but did not feel like a girl. After he tried to commit suicide at age 13, he was told that he had been born with male genitalia, which he underwent surgery to reconstruct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nolen-Hoeksema|title=Abnormal Psychology|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9781308211503|pages=368|edition=6}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This response went against Money's hypothesis that biology had nothing to do with gender identity or human sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Carol |author2=Diane Ruble |author3=Joel Szkrybalo |title=Cognitive Theories of Early Gender Development |journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2002 |volume=128|issue=6 |pages=903–913|doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.128.6.903 |pmid=12405137|citeseerx=10.1.1.460.3216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological factors===
Several prenatal, biological factors, including genes and hormones, may affect gender identity.&lt;ref name="ZhongNan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghosh"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ghosh|first=Shuvo|title=Gender Identity|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/917990-overview|publisher=MedScape|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biochemical theory of gender identity suggests that people acquire gender identities through such factors rather than socialization.

Hormonal influences are also complex; [[Sexual differentiation in humans|sex-determining hormones]] are produced at an early stage of foetal development,&lt;ref&gt;Lynda Birke, ''In Pursuit Of Difference, scientific studies of women and men'', in ''The Gender and Science Reader'', page 310&lt;/ref&gt; and if prenatal hormone levels are altered, phenotype progression may be altered as well, and the natural predisposition of the brain toward one sex may not match the genetic make-up of the fetus or its external sexual organs.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hines|first=Melissa|date=2017-02-02|title=Prenatal endocrine influences on sexual orientation and on sexually differentiated childhood behavior|journal=Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology|volume=32|issue=2|pages=170–182|doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.02.006|issn=0091-3022| pmc=3296090 |pmid=21333673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hormones may affect differences between males' and females' verbal and spatial abilities, memory, and aggression; prenatal hormone exposure affects how the hypothalamus regulates hormone secretion later in life, with "women's sex hormones usually follow[ing] a monthly cycle [while] men’s sex hormones do not follow such a pattern."&lt;ref&gt;Lynda Birke suggests that during the early stage of fetal development, specific hormones will enter the brain and “permanently affect how the hypothalamus works. As before, high levels of hormones known as androgens will stop the hypothalamus from ever organizing hormone cycles. If there are low levels, then it will be cyclic.” This early influence on brain determines the different frequency of hormone secretion later in male or female’s life. “Obviously, women’s sex hormones usually follow a monthly cycle,” while “men’s sex hormones do not follow such a pattern.” {{cite book|last=Birke|first=Lynda|title=The Gender and Science Reader|pages=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 study on the gender identity outcomes of female-raised [[46,XY]] persons with [[penile agenesis]], [[cloacal exstrophy]] of the bladder, or penile [[ablation]], found that 78% of the study subjects were living as female, as opposed to 22% who decided to initiate a sex change to male in line with their genetic sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=423–38 |pmid=16010465 |doi=10.1007/s10508-005-4342-9 |title=Gender identity outcome in female-raised 46,XY persons with penile agenesis, cloacal exstrophy of the bladder, or penile ablation |last=Meyer-Bahlburg |first=HF |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study concludes: "The findings clearly indicate an increased risk of later patient-initiated gender re-assignment to male after female assignment in infancy or early childhood, but are nevertheless incompatible with the notion of a full determination of core gender identity by prenatal androgens."

Research suggests that the same hormones that promote differentiation of sex organs in utero also elicit puberty and influence the development of gender identity. Different amounts of these male or female sex hormones within a person can result in behavior and external genitalia that do not match up with the norm of their sex assigned at birth, and in a person acting and looking like their identified gender.&lt;ref name="Oswalt"&gt;{{cite web|last=Oswalt |first=Angela |title=Factors Influencing Gender Identity |url=http://www.sevencounties.org/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&amp;id=37697&amp;cn=1272 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415234240/http://www.sevencounties.org/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&amp;id=37697&amp;cn=1272 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 15, 2013 |publisher=Seven Countries Services, Inc. |accessdate=October 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social and environmental factors===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2010}}

In 1955, John Money proposed that gender identity was malleable and determined by whether a child was raised as male or female in early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;J. Money, J. G. Hampson, and J. L. Hampson, ''An examination of some basic sexual concepts'', 1955&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GDDSD"&gt;A. L. C. de Vries, et al., ''Gender Dysphoria and Disorders of Sex Development'' (2013, {{ISBN|1461474418}})&lt;/ref&gt; Money's hypothesis has since been discredited,&lt;ref name="GDDSD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Fausto-Sterling, ''Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construct''&lt;/ref&gt; but scholars have continued to study the effect of social factors on gender identity formation.&lt;ref name="GDDSD"/&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s, factors such as the absence of a father, a mother's wish for a daughter, or parental reinforcement patterns were suggested as influences; more recent theories suggesting that parental psychopathology might partly influence gender identity formation have received only minimal empirical evidence,&lt;ref name="GDDSD"/&gt; with a 2004 article noting that "solid evidence for the importance of postnatal social factors is lacking."&lt;ref&gt;D. F. Swaab, ''Sexual differentiation of the human brain: relevance for gender identity, transsexualism and sexual orientation'', in ''Gynecological Endocrinology'', 2004: "...direct effects of testosterone on the developing fetal brain are of major importance for the development of male gender identity and male heterosexual orientation. Solid evidence for the importance of postnatal social factors is lacking."&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 study found that the parents of gender-dysphoric children showed no signs of psychopathological issues aside from mild depression in the mothers.&lt;ref name="GDDSD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. S. C. Wallien, ''Psychosexual outcome of gender-dysphoric children'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the attitudes of the child's parents may affect the child's gender identity, although evidence is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;M Weinraub, LP Clemens, A Sockloff, T Ethridge, ''The development of sex role stereotypes in the third year: relationships to gender labeling, gender identity, sex-types toy preference, and family characteristics'', in ''Child Development'', 1984: "Previous investigators have failed to observe a relationship between parental attitudes and children's early sex role acquisition..."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parental establishment of gender roles====
Parents who do not support gender nonconformity are more likely to have children with firmer and stricter views on gender identity and gender roles.&lt;ref name="Oswalt"/&gt; Recent literature suggests a trend towards less well-defined gender roles and identities, as studies of parental coding of toys as masculine, feminine, or neutral indicate that parents increasingly code kitchens and in some cases dolls as neutral rather than exclusively feminine.&lt;ref name=Kane&gt;{{cite book|last=Spade|first =Joan|title=The Kaleidoscope of Gender|publisher=SAGE|location=London|isbn=978-1-4129-7906-1|pages= 177–184|date =2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Emily Kane found that many parents still showed negative responses to items, activities, or attributes that were considered feminine, such as domestic skills, nurturance, and empathy.&lt;ref name=Kane /&gt; Research has indicated that many parents attempt to define gender for their sons in a manner that distances the sons from femininity,&lt;ref name=Kane /&gt; with Kane stating that "the parental boundary maintenance work evident for sons represents a crucial obstacle limiting boys options, separating boys from girls, devaluing activities marked as feminine for both boys and girls, and thus bolstering gender inequality and heteronormativity."&lt;ref name=Kane /&gt;

Many parents form gendered expectations for their child before it is even born, after determining the child's sex through technology such as [[ultrasound]]. The child thus arrives to a gender-specific name, games, and even ambitions.&lt;ref name="Ghosh"/&gt; Once the child's sex is determined, most children are raised in accordance with it to be a man or a woman, fitting a male or female gender role defined partly by the parents.

When considering the parents' social class, lower-class families typically hold traditional gender roles, where the father works and the mother, who may only work out of financial necessity, still takes care of the household. However, middle-class "professional" couples typically negotiate the division of labor and hold an egalitarian ideology. These different views on gender from a child's parents can shape the child's understanding of gender as well as the child's development of gender.&lt;ref name="Halpern" /&gt;

Within a study conducted by Hillary Halpern&lt;ref name="Halpern"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halpern|first=Hillary Paul|title=Parents' Gender Ideology and Gendered Behavior as Predictors of Children's Gender-Role Attitudes: A Longitudinal Exploration|journal=Sex Roles|volume=74|issue=11–12|pages=527–542|doi=10.1007/s11199-015-0539-0|pmid=27445431|pmc=4945126|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was hypothesized, and proven, that parent behaviors, rather than parent beliefs, regarding gender are better predictors for a child's attitude on gender. It was concluded that a mother's behavior was especially influential on a child's assumptions of the child's own gender. For example, mothers who practiced more traditional behaviors around their children resulted in the son displaying fewer stereotypes of male roles while the daughter displayed more stereotypes of female roles. No correlation was found between a father's behavior and his children's knowledge of stereotypes of their own gender. It was concluded, however, that fathers who held the belief of equality between the sexes had children, especially sons, who displayed fewer preconceptions of their opposite gender.

In recent decades it has become possible to [[sex reassignment surgery|reassign sex surgically]]. Some people who experience gender dysphoria seek such medical intervention to have their physiological sex match their gender identity; others retain the genitalia they were born with (see [[transsexual]] for some of the possible reasons) but adopt a gender role that is consistent with their gender identity.

==History and definitions==

===Definitions===
The terms ''gender identity'' and ''core gender identity'' were first used with their current meaning — one's personal experience of one's own gender&lt;ref name="MorrowMessinger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boles101"&gt;Boles, 2013. Page 101: "Gender identity is the individual's personal and private experience of his/her gender."&lt;/ref&gt; — sometime in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=GID&gt;"The term 'gender identity' was used in a press release, November 21, 1966, to announce the new clinic for transsexuals at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. It was disseminated in the media worldwide, and soon entered the vernacular. ... gender identity is your own sense or conviction of maleness or femaleness." {{Cite journal | last1 = Money | first1 = John | authorlink = John Money | year = 1994 | title = The concept of gender identity disorder in childhood and adolescence after 39 years | url = | journal = Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 163–77 | pmid = 7996589 | doi = 10.1080/00926239408403428 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of the Psychology of Women and Gender'' (2004, {{ISBN|0471653578}}), page 102: "''Gender identity'' was introduced into the professional lexicon by Hooker and Stoller almost simultaneously in the early 1960s (see Money, 1985). For example, Stoller (1964) used the slightly different term ''core gender identity''..."&lt;/ref&gt; To this day they are usually used in that sense,&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt; though a few scholars additionally use the term to refer to the [[sexual orientation]] and [[sexual identity]] categories ''[[gay]]'', ''[[lesbian]]'' and ''[[Bisexuality|bisexual]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brym, Roberts, Lie, Rytina. "Sociology". Nelson Education Ltd., 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early medical literature===
In late-19th-century medical literature, women who chose not to conform to their expected gender roles were called "inverts", and they were portrayed as having an interest in knowledge and learning, and a "dislike and sometimes incapacity for needlework". During the mid 1900s, doctors pushed for corrective therapy on such women and children, which meant that gender behaviors that were not part of the norm would be punished and changed. The aim of this therapy was to push children back to their "correct" gender roles and thereby limit the number of children who became transgender.&lt;ref name = Padawer&gt;{{cite news|last=Padawer|first=Ruth|title=What's So Bad About a Boy Who Wants to Wear a Dress?| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/magazine/whats-so-bad-about-a-boy-who-wants-to-wear-a-dress.html | accessdate = October 29, 2012|work =[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freud and Jung's views===
In 1905, [[Sigmund Freud]] presented his theory of [[psychosexual development]] in ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]'', giving evidence that in the pregenital phase children do not distinguish between sexes, but assume both parents have the same genitalia and reproductive powers. On this basis, he argued that bisexuality was the original sexual orientation and that heterosexuality was resultant of repression during the [[phallic stage]], at which point gender identity became ascertainable. According to Freud, during this stage, children developed an [[Oedipus complex]] where they had sexual fantasies for the parent ascribed the opposite gender and hatred for the parent ascribed the same gender, and this hatred transformed into (unconscious) transference and (conscious) identification with the hated parent who both exemplified a model to appease sexual impulses and threatened to castrate the child's power to appease sexual impulses.&lt;ref name=myers/&gt; In 1913, [[Carl Jung]] proposed the [[Electra complex]] as he both believed that bisexuality did not lie at the origin of psychic life, and that Freud did not give adequate description to the female child (Freud rejected this suggestion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Freud | first1 = Sigmund | year = 1931 | title = Female Sexuality | url = | journal = The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud | volume = 21 | issue = | page = 229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s and 1960s===
During the 1950s and '60s, psychologists began studying gender development in young children, partially in an effort to understand the origins of [[homosexuality]] (which was viewed as a [[mental disorder]] at the time). In 1958, the Gender Identity Research Project was established at the [[UCLA Medical Center]] for the study of [[intersex]] and transsexual individuals. Psychoanalyst [[Robert Stoller]] generalized many of the findings of the project in his book ''Sex and Gender: On the Development of Masculinity and Femininity'' (1968). He is also credited with introducing the term ''gender identity'' to the International Psychoanalytic Congress in [[Stockholm, Sweden]] in 1963. Behavioral psychologist [[John Money]] was also instrumental in the development of early theories of gender identity. His work at [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins Medical School]]'s Gender Identity Clinic (established in 1965) popularized an [[interactionist]] theory of gender identity, suggesting that, up to a certain age, gender identity is relatively fluid and subject to constant negotiation. His book ''Man and Woman, Boy and Girl'' (1972) became widely used as a [[college textbook]], although many of Money's ideas have since been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haraway |first=Donna |authorlink=Donna Haraway |year=1991 |title=Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: The Reinvention of Nature |page=133 |publisher=[[Free Association Books]] |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-90386-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Fixing Sex|Fixing Sex: Intersex, Medical Authority, and Lived Experience]] by Katrina Karkazis, Duke University Press, November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Butler's views===
In the late 1980s, [[Judith Butler]] began lecturing regularly on the topic of gender identity, and in 1990, she published ''[[Gender Trouble|Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity]]'', introducing the concept of [[gender performativity]] and arguing that both sex and gender are constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Butler |year=1990 |title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity |pages=front/backmatter |publisher=[[Routledge Classic]] |location=London |isbn=978-0415389556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present views==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}&lt;!--also needs expansion--&gt;

===Medical field===
{{As of|2018}}, there is some changing of views and new discrepancies about the best way to deal with gender nonconformity. Medical practitioners, as well as an increasing number of parents, generally no longer support or believe in the idea of [[conversion therapy]],&lt;ref name="nymag-7feb2016"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Singal|first1=Jesse|title=How the Fight Over Transgender Kids Got a Leading Sex Researcher Fired|url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/02/fight-over-trans-kids-got-a-researcher-fired.html|accessdate=April 25, 2017|magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is now widely discredited as unethical and ineffective.&lt;ref name="The Guardian - prayer and pain"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Tom Dart |title=Prayer and pain: why gay conversion therapy is still legal despite dangers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/gay-conversion-therapy-republican-party-platform |accessdate=9 July 2018 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian Media Group |date=July 15, 2016 |ref=Prayer_and_pain |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stonewall - Conversion Therapy"&gt;{{cite web |title=Conversion Therapy |url=https://www.stonewall.org.uk/campaign-groups/conversion-therapy |website=Stonewall |publisher=Stonewall |accessdate=9 July 2018 |ref=stonewall_conversion|date=2015-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, all major counselling and psychotherapy bodies, as well as the [[NHS]], have concluded that conversion therapy to 'cure' sexual orientation is dangerous and work is being done to extend this position to include gender identity.&lt;ref name="MOU - Conversion Therapy"&gt;{{cite web |title=Memorandum of Understanding on Conversion Therapy in the UK |url=https://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Memorandum-of-understanding-on-conversion-therapy.pdf |website=www.pyschotherapy.org |publisher=UKCP - UK Council for Psychotherapy |accessdate=9 July 2018 |ref=MOU_CT |date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there are still a number of clinicians who continue to believe that there should be interventions for gender nonconforming children. They believe that stereotypical gender-specific toys and games will encourage children to behave in their traditional gender roles.&lt;ref name="Padawer"/&gt;

[[Transsexual]] self-identified people sometimes wish to undergo physical surgery to refashion their [[primary sexual characteristics]], secondary characteristics, or both, because they feel they will be more comfortable with different genitalia. This may involve removal of penis, testicles or breasts, or the fashioning of a penis, vagina or breasts. In the past, sex assignment surgery has been performed on infants who are born with ambiguous genitalia. However, current medical opinion is strongly against this procedure, since many adults have regretted that these decisions were made for them at birth. Today, [[sex reassignment surgery]] is performed on people who choose to have this change so that their anatomical sex will match their gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Milton|title=Sex and Gender are Different: Sexual Identity and Gender Identity are Different|journal=Clinical Child Psychology &amp; Psychiatry|year=2002|volume=7|issue=3|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/2000to2004/2002-sex-and-gender.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, it was decided under the Affordable Care Act that [[health insurance exchange]]s would have the ability to collect demographic information on gender identity and sexual identity through optional questions, to help policymakers better recognize the needs of the [[LGBT]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Kellan|title=FAQ: Collecting Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Data|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/report/2012/10/16/41620/faq-collecting-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-data/|publisher=Center for American Progress|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender dysphoria and gender identity disorder===
[[Gender dysphoria]] (previously called "gender identity disorder" or GID in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]]) is the formal diagnosis of people who experience significant [[dysphoria]] (discontent) with the sex they were assigned at birth and/or the gender roles associated with that sex:&lt;ref&gt;"Gender Identity Disorder | Psychology Today." Psychology Today: Health, Help, Happiness Find a Therapist. Psychology Today, 24 Oct. 2005. Web. 17 Dec. 2010. http://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/gender-identity-disorder.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100306075726/http://www.genderdysphoria.org/genderdysphoria_medical.html Gender Dysphoria Organization Research and Education - About Gender Dysphoria&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; "In gender identity disorder, there is discordance between the natal sex of one's external genitalia and the brain coding of one's gender as masculine or feminine."&lt;ref name="GID" /&gt; The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (302.85) has five criteria that must be met before a diagnosis of gender identity disorder can be made, and the disorder is further subdivided into specific diagnoses based on age, for example [[gender identity disorder in children]] (for children who experience gender dysphoria).

The concept of gender identity appeared in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] in its third edition, [[DSM-III]] (1980), in the form of two [[mental disorder|psychiatric diagnoses]] of gender dysphoria: gender identity disorder of childhood (GIDC), and transsexualism (for adolescents and adults). The 1987 revision of the manual, the [[DSM-III-R]], added a third diagnosis: gender identity disorder of adolescence and adulthood, nontranssexual type. This latter diagnosis was removed in the subsequent revision, DSM-IV (1994), which also collapsed GIDC and transsexualism into a new diagnosis of gender identity disorder.&lt;ref name="Historical Note"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zucker | first1 = KJ | last2 = Spitzer | first2 = RL  |date=Jan–Feb 2005 | title = Was the gender identity disorder of childhood diagnosis introduced into DSM-III as a backdoor maneuver to replace homosexuality?

The authors of a 2005 academic paper questioned the classification of gender identity problems as a [[mental disorder]], speculating that certain DSM revisions may have been made on a tit-for-tat basis when certain groups were pushing for the removal of homosexuality as a disorder. This remains controversial,&lt;ref name="Historical Note"/&gt; although the vast majority of today's mental health professionals follow and agree with the current DSM classifications.

===International human rights law===
[[The Yogyakarta Principles]], a document on the application of [[international human rights law]], provide in the preamble a definition of gender identity as each person's deeply felt internal and individual [[experience]] of gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth, including the person's sense of the body (which may involve, if freely chosen, modification of bodily appearance or function by medical, surgical or other means) and other experience of gender, including dress, speech and mannerism. Principle 3 states that "Each person’s self-defined [...] gender identity is integral to their personality and is one of the most basic aspects of self-determination, dignity and freedom. No one shall be forced to undergo medical procedures, including sex reassignment surgery, sterilisation or hormonal therapy, as a requirement for legal recognition of their gender identity."&lt;ref&gt;[[The Yogyakarta Principles]], ''Principle 3. The Right to recognition before the law''&lt;/ref&gt; and Principle 18 states that "Notwithstanding any classifications to the contrary, a person's sexual orientation and gender identity are not, in and of themselves, medical conditions and are not to be treated, cured or suppressed."&lt;ref&gt;The Yogyakarta Principles, ''Principle 18. Protection from medical abuse''&lt;/ref&gt; Relating to this principle, the "Jurisprudential Annotations to the Yogyakarta Principles" observed that "Gender identity differing from that assigned at birth, or socially rejected [[gender expression]], have been treated as a form of [[mental illness]]. The pathologization of difference has led to gender-transgressive children and adolescents being confined in psychiatric institutions, and subjected to aversion techniques — including [[electroshock therapy]] — as a 'cure'."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101122035344/http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/yogyakarta-principles-jurisprudential-annotations.pdf Jurisprudential Annotations to the Yogyakarta Principles, page 43] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122035344/http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/yogyakarta-principles-jurisprudential-annotations.pdf |date=November 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Yogyakarta Principles in Action" says "it is important to note that while 'sexual orientation' has been declassified as a mental illness in many countries, 'gender identity' or 'gender identity disorder' often remains in consideration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ypinaction.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Activists_Guide_English_nov_14_2010.pdf|title=Activist's Guide to the Yogyakarta Principles, p. 100|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Principles influenced the [[LGBT rights at the United Nations|UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity]]
In 2015, gender identity was part of a Supreme Court case in the United States called Obergefell v Hodges  in which marriage was no longer restricted between man and woman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-binary gender identities==
{{See also|Gender binary|Genderqueer|Third gender}}
Some people, and some societies, do not construct gender as a [[gender binary|binary]] in which everyone is either a boy or a girl, or a man or a woman. Those who exist outside the binary fall under the umbrella terms ''non-binary'' or ''[[genderqueer]]''. Some cultures have specific gender roles that are distinct from "man" and "woman." These are often referred to as ''[[third gender]]s''.

===Fa'afafine===
{{Main|Fa'afafine}}
In some [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] societies, [[fa'afafine]] are considered to be a third gender. They are anatomically male, but dress and behave in a manner considered typically feminine. According to Tamasailau Sua'ali'i (''see references''), fa'afafine in [[Samoa]] at least are often physiologically unable to reproduce. Fa'afafine are accepted as a natural gender, and neither looked down upon nor discriminated against.&lt;ref&gt;Sua'ali'i, Tamasailau, "[[Samoa]]ns and Gender: Some Reflections on Male, Female and Fa'afafine Gender Identities", in: ''Tangata O Te Moana Nui: The Evolving Identities of Pacific Peoples in [[Aotearoa]]/[[New Zealand]]'', Palmerston North (NZ): Dunmore Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-86469-369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fa'afafine also reinforce their femininity with the fact that they are only attracted to and receive sexual attention from straight masculine men. They have been and generally still are initially identified in terms of labour preferences, as they perform typically feminine household tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Johanna|title=Paradise Lost? Social Change and Fa'afafine in Samoa|journal=Current Sociology|date=May 2003|issue=3|pages=417–432|doi=10.1177/0011392103051003014|volume=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Prime Minister of Samoa|Samoan Prime Minister]] is patron of the Samoa Fa'afafine Association.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_5233232"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/south-pacific/5233232/Transsexuals-hailed-by-Samoan-PM |title=Transsexuals hailed by Samoan PM |author=Field, Michael |date=5 July 2011 |website=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translated literally, fa'afafine means "in the manner of a woman."&lt;ref&gt;Pual L. Vasey, Nancy H. Bartlett, "What Can the Samoan "Fa'afafine" Teach Us About the Western Concept of Gender Identity Disorder in Childhood?", ''Biology and Medicine'', 50.4 (2007) 481-490&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hijras===
{{Main|Hijra (South Asia)}}
In some cultures of [[Asia]], a [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]] is usually considered to be neither a man nor a woman. Most are anatomically [[male]] or [[intersex]], but some are anatomically [[female]]. The hijra form a third gender role, although they do not enjoy the same acceptance and respect as males and females in their cultures. They can run their own households, and their occupations are singing and dancing, working as cooks or servants, sometimes [[prostitute]]s, or long-term sexual partners with men. Hijras can be compared to [[transvestism|transvestites]] or [[drag queen]]s of contemporary western culture.&lt;ref&gt;Lorber, Judith. Paradoxes of Gender. Yale University Press:Yale, 1994. pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Khanith===
{{Main|Khanith}}
The [[khanith]] form an accepted third gender in [[Oman]]. The khanith are [[male]] [[homosexual]] [[prostitute]]s whose dressing is male, featuring pastel colors (rather than white, worn by men), but their mannerisms female. Khanith can mingle with women, and they often do at [[wedding]]s or other formal events. Khaniths have their own households, performing all tasks (both male and female). However, similarly to men in their [[society]], khaniths can marry women, proving their [[masculinity]] by consummating the [[marriage]]. Should a [[divorce]] or death take place, these men can revert to their status as khaniths at the next wedding.&lt;ref&gt;Lorber, Judith. Paradoxes of Gender. Yale University Press:Yale, 1994. pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two-spirit identities===
{{Main|Two-Spirit}}
&lt;!--section needs slight expansion--&gt;
Many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous North American Nations]] had more than two gender roles. Those who belong to the additional gender categories, beyond [[cisgender]] man and woman, are now often collectively termed "two-spirit" or "two-spirited." There are parts of the community that take "two-spirit" as a category over an identity itself, preferring to identify with culture or Nation-specific gender terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Sarah|year=2016|title=An Introduction to the Health of Two-Spirit People: Historical, contemporary and emergent issues|url=http://www.nccah-ccnsa.ca/Publications/Lists/Publications/Attachments/156/2016-05-10-RPT-HealthTwoSpirit-Hunt-EN-Web.pdf|journal=National Collaborative Centre Aboriginal Health|volume=|pages=|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202004508/http://www.nccah-ccnsa.ca/Publications/Lists/Publications/Attachments/156/2016-05-10-RPT-HealthTwoSpirit-Hunt-EN-Web.pdf|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1716">'''Helena''' (active during the 4th century BC in Egypt) was a painter who learned her craft from her father, Timon, who was also an artist. She worked in the period after the death of [[Alexander the Great]] in 323 BC.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20725">The establishment of [[industrial ecology]] as field of scientific research is commonly attributed to an article devoted to industrial ecosystems, written by Frosch and Gallopoulos, which appeared in a 1989 special issue of Scientific American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frosch | first1 = R.A. | last2 = Gallopoulos | first2 = N.E. | year = 1989 | title = Strategies for Manufacturing | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 261 | issue = 3| pages = 144–152 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0989-144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial ecology emerged from several earlier ideas and concepts, some of which date back to the 19th century.

== Before the 1960s ==

The term "[[Industrial Ecology|industrial ecology]]" has been used alongside "[[Industrial Symbiosis|industrial symbiosis]]" at least since the 1940s. [[Economic geography]] was perhaps one of the first fields to use these terms. For example, in an article published in 1947, George T. Renner refers to "The General Principle of Industrial Location" as a "Law of Industrial Ecology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Renner | first1 = G.T. | year = 1947 | title = Geography of Industrial Localization | url = | journal = Economic Geography | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 167–189 | doi=10.2307/141510 | jstor = 141510 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Briefly stated this is:

{{quote|Any industry tends to locate at a point which provides optimum access to its ingredients or component elements. If all these component elements be juxtaposed, the location of the industry is predetermined. If, however, they occur widely separated, the industry is so located as to be most accessible to that element which would be the most expensive or difficult to transport and which, therefore, becomes the locative factor for the industry in question.}}

In the same article the author defines and describes industrial symbiosis:

{{quote|Often the location of an industry cannot be fully understood solely in terms of its locative ingredient elements. There are relationships between industries, sometimes simple, but often quite complex, which enter into and complicate the analysis. Chief among these is the phenomenon of [[industrial symbiosis]]. By this is meant the consorting together of two or more of dissimilar industries. Industrial Symbiosis, when scrutinized, is seen to be of two kinds, disjunctive and conjunctive.}}

It appears that the concept of Industrial Symbiosis was not new for the field of economic geography, since the same categorization is used by Walter G. Lezius in his 1937 article "Geography of Glass Manufacture at Toledo, Ohio", also published in the Journal of Economic Geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lezius | first1 = Walter G | year = 1937 | title = Geography of Glass Manufacture at Toledo, Ohio | jstor = 141587| journal = Economic Geography | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 402–412 | doi=10.2307/141587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Used in a different context, the term "Industrial Ecology" is also found in a 1958 paper concerned with the relationship between the ecological impact from increasing urbanization and value orientations of related peoples. The case study is in Lebanon:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Armstrong | first1 = L. | last2 = Bashshur | first2 = R. | year = 1958 | title = Ecological Patterns and Value Orientations in Lebanon | journal = Public Opinion Quarterly | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 406–415 | jstor=2746350 | doi = 10.1086/266808 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The central ecological variable in the present research is ecological mobility, or the movement of men in space. It is patent that modern Industrial Ecology requires more such adaptive mobility than does traditional folk-village organization.}}

== 1960s ==

In 1963, we find the term Industrial Ecology (defined as the "complex ecology of the modern industrial world") being used to describe the social nature and complexity of (and within) industrial systems:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barnard | first1 = F | year = 1963 | title = Education for management conceived as a study of Industrial Ecology | journal = Journal of Vocational Education &amp; Training | volume = 15 | issue = 30| pages = 22–26 | doi=10.1080/03057876380000041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...industrial organisations are social rather than mechanical systems. A firm is not only a working organisation with a working purpose. It is rather a community with its own 'politics', in so far as it is involved in problems concerned with the proper distribution of power between individuals and groups of individuals and with questions of individual and group prestige, influence, status and standing... [and he concludes that] the understanding which the student of management is expected to gain is no less than the attainment of insight into an [[Industrial Ecology]] of great complexity.}}

In 1967, the President of the American association for the advancement of science writes in "The experimental city"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spilhaus |first1=Athelstan |year=1967 |title=The experimental city |journal=Daedalus |volume=96 |issue=4 |pages=1129–41 |jstor=20027108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that "There are examples of [[industrial symbiosis]] where one industry feeds off, or at least neutralizes, the wastes of another..." The same author in 1970 talks about "The Next Industrial Revolution"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.167.3926.1673 |pmid=17729610 |title=The Next Industrial Revolution |journal=Science |volume=167 |issue=3926 |pages=1673 |year=1970 |last1=Spilhaus |first1=A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of material and energy sharing and reuse is central to his proposal for a new industrial revolution and he cites agro-[[industrial symbiosis]] as a practical way for achieving this:

{{quote|The object of the next industrial revolution is to ensure that there will be no such thing as waste, on the basis that waste is simply some substance that we do not vet have the wit to use... The next industrial revolution is this generating of a huge new [industry that]... will not produce products, it will rather reprocess the things we call wastes so they may be reproduced in the factories into the things we need... Having the city near the rural area will enable waste heat to be used to speed up the biological processes of treating the organic wastes before they go back into the land. This might end in an elegant arrangement-the power plants located close enough to the center of use, to the people who need the power, but also, within the economics, close enough to the agriculture lands so that the waste heat may be used there. This is an example of agro-industrial symbiosis, if you like to call it that.}}

In these early articles, "Industrial Ecology" is used in its literal sense - as a system of interacting industrial entities. The relation to natural ecosystems (through either metaphor or analogy) is not explicit. Industrial Symbiosis on the other hand, is already clearly defined as a type of industrial organization, and the term symbiosis is borrowed from the ecological sciences to describe an analogous phenomenon in industrial systems.

== 1970s ==

Industrial Ecology has been a research subject of the Japan Industrial Policy Research Institute since 1971. Their definition of Industrial Ecology is "research for the prospect of dynamic harmonization between human activities and nature by a systems approach based upon ecology (JIPRI, 1983)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ogawa | first1 = H. | last2 = Sato | first2 = K. | last3 = Jo | first3 = N. | last4 = Noro | first4 = K. | last5 = Tsuchiya | first5 = K. | year = 1986 | title = Modelling of industrial ecological systems for evaluation of health services | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 31 | issue = 1–4| pages = 329–339 | doi=10.1016/0304-3800(86)90073-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This programme has resulted to a number of reports that are available only in Japanese.

One of the earliest definitions of  Industrial Ecology was proposed by Harry Zvi Evan at a seminar of the Economic Commission of Europe in Warsaw (Poland) in 1973 (an article was subsequently published by Evan in the Journal for International Labour Review in 1974 vol. 110 (3), pp.&amp;nbsp;219–233). Evan defined Industrial Ecology as a systematic analysis of industrial operations including factors like: Technology, environment, natural resources, bio-medical aspects, institutional and legal matters as well as the socio-economic aspects.

In 1974 the term of Industrial Ecology is perhaps for the first time associated with a cyclical production mode (rather than a linear one, resulting to waste). In this article, the necessity for a transition to an "open-world Industrial Ecology", is used as argument for the need to establish lunar industries:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ehricke | first1 = K.A. | year = 1974 | title = Lunar industries and their value for the human environment on Earth | journal = Acta Astronautica | volume = 1 | issue = 5–6| pages = 585–622 | doi=10.1016/0094-5765(74)90023-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Low living standards provide one strong motive for most developing countries to increase their productivity and grow economically. Population increase (while it lasts) is a still more powerful driver for increased world consumption. Thus the pressure on resources will continue to grow. Instead of deploring it, we better grow with it. Only through transition to an open-world [[Industrial Ecology]] - which includes both benign industrial revolution on Earth and extraterrestrial industrialization - can the present apparent limits to growth be overcome.}}

Many elements of modern Industrial Ecology were commonplace in the industrial sectors of the former Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sathre | first1 = R. | last2 = Grdzelishvili | first2 = I. | year = 2006 | title = Industrial symbiosis in the former Soviet Union | url = | journal = Progress in Industrial Ecology | volume = 3 | issue = 4| pages = 379–392 | doi=10.1504/pie.2006.011743}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, “kombinirovanaia produksia” (combined production) was present from the earliest years of the Soviet Union and was instrumental in shaping the patterns of Soviet industrialization. “Bezotkhodnoyi tekhnologii” (waste-free technology) was introduced in the final decades of the USSR as a way to increase industrial production while limiting environmental impact. Fiodor Davitaya, a Soviet scientist from the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Republic of Georgia]], described in 1977 the analogy relating industrial systems to natural systems as a model for a desirable transition to cleaner production:

{{quote|Nature operates without any waste products. What is rejected by some organisms provides food for others. The organisation of industry on this principle—with the waste products of some branches of industry providing raw material for others—means in effect using natural processes as a model, for in them the resolution of all arising contradictions is the motive force of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Davitaya, F. (1977) "Changes in the atmosphere and some problems of its protection" pp. 99–110 in ''Society and the Environment: A Soviet View''; Moscow: Progress Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== 1980s ==

By the 80s Industrial Ecology was already "promoted" to a research subject, which several institutes around the globe embraced. In a 1986 article published in the Journal of Ecological Modeling, there is a full description of Industrial Ecology and the [[analogy]] to natural [[ecosystems]] is clearly stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ogawa | first1 = H. | last2 = Sato | first2 = K. | last3 = Jo | first3 = N. | last4 = Noro | first4 = K. | last5 = Tsuchiya | first5 = K. | year = 1986 | title = Modelling of industrial ecological systems for evaluation of health services | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 31 | issue = 1–4| pages = 329–339 | doi=10.1016/0304-3800(86)90073-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The structure and inner-working of an industrial society resemble those of a natural ecosystem. The concepts in ecology such as habitat, succession, trophic level, limiting factors and community metabolism can also apply to the study of the ecology of an industrial society. For instance, an industry in a society may grow or decline as a consequence of dynamic changes in exogenous limiting resources and in the hierarchical and/or metabolic structure of that society. When studying the ecology of an industrial society (henceforth termed '[[Industrial Ecology]]'), these concepts and methodologies employed in ecosystems analyses are useful.}}

In fact, in the above article there is an attempt to model an "industrial ecological system". The model is composed of seven major sections: industry, population, labor force, living state, environment and pollution, general health, and occupational health. Notice the rough similarity with Evan's factors as stated in the above section.

During the 80s the emergence of another related term, "[[industrial metabolism]]", is observed. The term is used as a metaphor for the organization and functioning of industrial activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hicks | first1 =  | year = 1983 | title = The Property Tax in a New Industrial Era | jstor = 3700958| journal = Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages =  208–221| doi=10.2307/3700958}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article defending the "biological modulation of terrestrial carbon cycle", the author includes an extraordinary parenthetical note:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schidlowski | first1 = M | year = 1984 | title = Biological modulation of the terrestrial carbon cycle: isotope clues to early organic evolution | url = | journal = Advances in Space Research | volume = 4 | issue = 12| pages = 183–93 | pmid = 11537773 | doi=10.1016/0273-1177(84)90561-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Parenthetically, it should be noted that it is an intrinsic property of life to proliferate exponentially until the encounter of limits set by (I) the availability of biologically utilizable reducing power, or (2) the exhaustion of some critical nutrient, or (3) an autotoxic effect imposed by life on its own environment. These limits are universal, applying to microbial ecosystems as well as to the population dynamics of a seemingly unrestricted biological superdominant such as Homo Sapiens (here, the ultimate limit is likely to be placed by an autotoxic effect exerted by the "extrasomatic" (industrial) metabolism of the human race).}}

=== 1989 – Decisive articles ===

In 1989 two articles were released that played a decisive role in the history of industrial ecology. The first one was titled "Industrial Metabolism" by Robert Ayres. Ayres essentially lays the foundations of Industrial Ecology, although the term is not to be found in this article. In the appendix of the article he includes "a theoretical exploration of the biosphere and the industrial economy as material-transformation systems and lessons that might be learned from their comparison". He proposes that:&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, R.U. 1989. Industrial Metabolism. In Technology and Environment,J.H. Ausubel and H.E. Sladovich, 23–49. 1st. Washington DC: National Academy Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We may think of both the biosphere and the industrial economy as systems for the transformation of materials. The biosphere as it now exists is nearly a perfect system for recycling materials. This was not the case when life on earth began. The industrial system of today resembles the earliest stage of biological evolution, when the most primitive living organisms obtained their energy from a stock of organic molecules accumulated during prebiotic times. It is increasingly urgent for us to learn from the biosphere and modify our industrial metabolism, the energy - and value - yielding process essential to economic development... we should not only postulate, but indeed endorse, a long-run imperative favoring an industrial metabolism that results in reduced extraction of virgin materials, reduced loss of waste materials, and increased recycling of useful ones.}}

The term "Industrial Ecology" gains mainstream attention later the same year (1989) through a "[[Scientific American]]" article named "Strategies for Manufacturing". In this article, R.Frosch and N.Gallopoulos wonder "why would not our industrial system behave like an [[ecosystem]], where the wastes of a species may be [[natural resource|resource]] to another species? Why would not the outputs of an industry be the inputs of another, thus reducing use of raw materials, pollution, and saving on [[waste]] treatment?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frosch | first1 = R.A. | last2 = Gallopoulos | first2 = N.E. | year = 1989 | title = Strategies for Manufacturing | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 261 | issue = 3| pages = 144–152 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0989-144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This vision gave birth to the concept of the Eco-industrial Park, the industrial complex that is governed by Industrial Ecology principles. A notable example resides in a Danish industrial park in the city of [[Kalundborg]]. There, several linkages of byproducts and waste heat can be found between numerous entities such as a large power plant, an oil refinery, a pharmaceutical plant, a plasterboard factory, an enzyme manufacturer, a waste company and the city itself.&lt;ref&gt;The Kalundborg Centre for [[industrial symbiosis]] (2007) http://www.symbiosis.dk/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Frosch|Frosch's]] and Gallopoulos' thinking was in certain ways simply an extension of earlier ideas, such as the efficiency and waste-reduction thinking annunciated by [[Buckminster Fuller]] and his students (e.g., [[J. Baldwin]]), and parallel ideas about energy [[cogeneration]], such as those of [[Amory Lovins]] and the [[Rocky Mountain Institute]].

== 1990s ==

In 1991, C. Kumar Patel organized a seminal colloquium on Industrial Ecology, held on May 20 and 21, 1991, at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington D.C. The papers were later published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] USA, and they form an excellent reference on Industrial Ecology. Papers include:

== 21st century ==

The ''Journal of Industrial Ecology'' (since 1997), the International Society for Industrial Ecology (since 2001), and the journal ''Progress in Industrial Ecology'' (since 2004) have covered [[industrial ecology]] in the international scientific community. Principles of industrial ecology are also emerging in various policy realms such as the concept of the circular economy that is being promoted in China. Although the definition of the circular economy has yet to be formalized, generally the focus is on strategies such as creating a circular flow of materials, and cascading energy flows. An example of this would be using [[waste heat]] from one process to run another process that requires a lower temperature. This maximizes the efficiency of [[exergy]] use. This strategy aims for a more efficient economy with fewer pollutants and other unwanted by-products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yuan | first1 = Z | last2 = Bi | first2 = J | last3 = Moriguichi | first3 = Y | year = 2008| title = The Circular Economy: A New Development Strategy in China | url = | journal = Journal of Industrial Ecology | volume = 10 | issue = 1–2| pages = 4–8 | doi=10.1162/108819806775545321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hjernevask''''' ("Brainwash") is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Documentary film|documentary]] [[miniseries]] about [[science]] that aired on [[NRK1]] in 2010. The series, consisting of seven episodes, was created and presented by the comedian and sociologist [[Harald Eia]]. 

The series contrasted [[Cultural determinism|cultural determinist]] models of human behavior (also referred to as the [[Standard social science model]]) with nature-nurture interactionist perspectives. Experts interviewed for the series included [[Simon Baron-Cohen]], [[Steven Pinker]], [[Simon LeVay]], [[David Buss]], [[Glenn Wilson (psychologist)|Glenn Wilson]], and [[Anne Campbell (academic)|Anne Campbell]]. This ignited a wide public discussion on the subject of the [[nature versus nurture]] debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Braanen, Bjørgulv|title=Hjernevask|url=http://www.klassekampen.no/57307/article/item/null/hjernevask|work=[[Klassekampen]]|date=17 March 2010|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Mikkelsen, Solveig|title= - Rammer kritisk og teoretisk tenkning|url=http://www.universitetsavisa.no/forskning/article38587.ece?device=pc|work=Universitetsavisa|publisher=[[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]]|date=25 November 2011|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=NRK legger ut Eia-intervjuet|url=http://www.side2.no/underholdning/nrk-legger-ut-eia-intervjuet/2873679.html|work=Side2|publisher=[[Nettavisen]]|date=1 April 2010|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire series has since been released online.

==Objectives and awards==
Eia and coproducer Ole Martin Ihle have named [[Steven Pinker]]'s book ''[[The Blank Slate]]'' as an inspiration for the documentary series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://universitas.no/kultur/54528/vasker-forskerhjerner/ |title=Vasker forskerhjerner |publisher=[[Universitas (newspaper)|Universitas]] |date=2010-02-24 |accessdate=2013-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was a huge success, and Eia was awarded the [[Fritt Ord Award]] for "having precipitated one of the most heated debates on research in recent times".&lt;ref name="FrittOrd2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fritt-ord.no/en/hjem/mer/harald_eia_dag_hessen_og_bjorn_vassnes_far_fritt_ords_honnor/|title=Harald Eia, Dag Hessen and Bjørn Vassnes receive the Fritt Ord Foundation Tribute|date=December 8, 2010|publisher=[[Fritt Ord (organization)|The Fritt Ord Foundation]]|accessdate=September 5, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023210109/http://www.fritt-ord.no/en/hjem/mer/harald_eia_dag_hessen_og_bjorn_vassnes_far_fritt_ords_honnor/|archivedate=October 23, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46818">'''Human–computer interaction''' ('''HCI''') researches the design and use of computer technology, focused on the interfaces between people ([[user (computing)|users]]) and computers. Researchers in the field of HCI both observe the ways in which humans interact with computers and design technologies that let humans interact with computers in novel ways. 
As a field of research, human–computer interaction is situated at the intersection of [[computer science]], [[behavioral sciences]], [[design]], [[media studies]], and [[Outline of human–computer interaction#Related fields|several other fields of study]]. The term was popularized by [[Stuart K. Card]], [[Allen Newell]], and [[Thomas P. Moran]] in their seminal 1983 book, ''The Psychology of Human–Computer Interaction'', although the authors first used the term in 1980&lt;ref name="The keystroke-level model for user performance time with interactive systems"/&gt; and the first known use was in 1975.&lt;ref name="Evaluating the impact of office automation on top management communication"/&gt; The term connotes that, unlike other tools with only limited uses (such as a hammer, useful for driving nails but not much else), a computer has many uses and this takes place as an open-ended dialog between the user and the computer. The notion of dialog likens human–computer interaction to human-to-human interaction, an analogy which is crucial to theoretical considerations in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suchman|first1=Lucy|title=Plans and Situated Action.

==Introduction==
Humans interact with computers in many ways; the interface between humans and computers is crucial to facilitating this [[interaction]]. Desktop applications, internet browsers, handheld computers, and computer kiosks make use of the prevalent [[graphical user interface]]s (GUI) of today.&lt;ref name="ACM SIGCHI"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hewett|last2=Baecker|last3=Card|last4=Carey|last5=Gasen|last6=Mantei|last7=Perlman|last8=Strong|last9=Verplank|title=ACM SIGCHI Curricula for Human–Computer Interaction|url=http://old.sigchi.org/cdg/cdg2.html#2_1|publisher=ACM SIGCHI|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voice user interface]]s (VUI) are used for [[speech recognition]] and synthesizing systems, and the emerging multi-modal and Graphical user interfaces (GUI) allow humans to engage with [[Embodied agent|embodied character agents]] in a way that cannot be achieved with other interface paradigms. The growth in human–computer interaction field has been in quality of interaction, and in different branching in its history. Instead of designing regular interfaces, the different research branches have had a different focus on the concepts of multimodality rather than unimodality, intelligent adaptive interfaces rather than command/action based ones, and finally active rather than passive interfaces.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) defines human–computer interaction as "a discipline concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them".&lt;ref name="ACM SIGCHI"/&gt; An important facet of HCI is user satisfaction (or simply End User Computing Satisfaction).
"Because human–computer interaction studies a human and a machine in communication, it draws from supporting knowledge on both the machine and the human side. On the machine side, techniques in [[computer graphics]], [[operating system]]s, [[programming language]]s, and development environments are relevant. On the human side, [[communication theory]], [[graphic design|graphic]] and [[industrial design]] disciplines, [[linguistics]], [[social science]]s, [[cognitive psychology]], [[social psychology]], and [[human factors]] such as [[computer user satisfaction]] are relevant. And, of course, engineering and design methods are relevant."&lt;ref name="ACM SIGCHI"/&gt; Due to the multidisciplinary nature of HCI, people with different backgrounds contribute to its success. HCI is also sometimes termed ''human–machine interaction'' (HMI), ''man-machine interaction'' (MMI) or ''computer-human interaction'' (CHI).

Poorly designed [[human-machine interface]]s can lead to many unexpected problems. A classic example is the [[Three Mile Island accident]], a nuclear meltdown accident, where investigations concluded that the design of the human-machine interface was at least partly responsible for the disaster.&lt;ref name="What is Cognitive Ergonomics?"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NRC: Backgrounder on the Three Mile Island Accident"/&gt;&lt;ref name="threemileisland"/&gt; Similarly, accidents in aviation have resulted from manufacturers' decisions to use non-standard [[Flight instruments#Layout|flight instrument]] or throttle quadrant layouts: even though the new designs were proposed to be superior in basic human-machine interaction, pilots had already ingrained the "standard" layout and thus the conceptually good idea actually had undesirable results.

==Goals for computers==
Human–computer interaction studies the ways in which humans make, or do not make, use of computational artifacts, systems and infrastructures. In doing so, much of the research in the field seeks to ''improve'' human–computer interaction by improving the ''usability'' of computer interfaces.&lt;ref name=Grudin1992usability&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grudin|first1=Jonathan|title=Utility and usability: research issues and development contexts|journal=Interacting with Computers|date=1992|volume=4|issue=2|pages=209–217|url=http://iwc.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/2/209.short|accessdate=7 March 2015|doi=10.1016/0953-5438(92)90005-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; How usability is to be precisely understood, how it relates to other social and cultural values and when it is, and when it may not be a desirable property of computer interfaces is increasingly debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Chalmers|first1=Matthew|last2=Galani|first2=Areti|title=Seamful interweaving: heterogeneity in the theory and design of interactive systems|journal=Procee

Much of the research in the field of human–computer interaction takes an interest in:

* Methods for designing new computer interfaces, thereby optimizing a design for a desired property such as learnability or efficiency of use.
* Methods for implementing interfaces, e.g., by means of [[library (computing)|software libraries]].
* Methods for evaluating and comparing interfaces with respect to their usability and other desirable properties.
* Methods for studying human computer use and its sociocultural implications more broadly.

Visions of what researchers in the field seek to achieve vary. When pursuing a cognitivist perspective, researchers of HCI may seek to align computer interfaces with the mental model that humans have of their activities. When pursuing a [[post-cognitivist]] perspective, researchers of HCI may seek to align computer interfaces with existing social practices or existing sociocultural values.

Researchers in HCI are interested in developing design methodologies, experimenting with devices, prototyping software and hardware systems, exploring interaction paradigms, and developing models and theories of interaction.

==Differences with related fields==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}
HCI differs from [[human factors and ergonomics]] as HCI focuses more on users working specifically with computers, rather than other kinds of machines or designed artifacts. There is also a focus in HCI on how to implement the computer software and hardware mechanisms to support human–computer interaction. Thus, ''human factors'' is a broader term; HCI could be described as the human factors of computers – although some experts try to differentiate these areas. 

HCI also differs from human factors in that there is less of a focus on repetitive work-oriented tasks and procedures, and much less emphasis on physical stress and the physical form or [[industrial design]] of the user interface, such as [[computer keyboard|keyboards]] and [[mouse (computing)|mouse devices]].

Three areas of study have substantial overlap with HCI even as the focus of inquiry shifts. [[Personal information management]] (PIM) studies how people acquire and use personal information (computer based and other) to complete tasks. In [[computer-supported cooperative work]] (CSCW), emphasis is placed on the use of computing systems in support of the collaborative work. The principles of [[human interaction management]] (HIM) extend the scope of CSCW to an organizational level and can be implemented without use of computers.

==Design==

===Principles===
[[File:Linux kernel INPUT OUPUT evdev gem USB framebuffer.svg|thumb|300px|The user interacts directly with hardware for the human ''input'' and ''output'' such as [[History of display technology|display]]s, e.g. through a [[graphical user interface]]. The user interacts with the computer over this software interface using the given [[Input/output|input and output]] (''I/O'') hardware.
&lt;br/&gt;
Software and hardware must be matched, so that the processing of the user input is fast enough, the [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] of the computer output is not disruptive to the [[workflow]].]]
When evaluating a current [[user interface]], or designing a new user interface, it is important to keep in mind the following experimental design principles:
* Early focus on user(s) and task(s): Establish how many users are needed to perform the task(s) and determine who the appropriate users should be; someone who has never used the interface, and will not use the interface in the future, is most likely not a valid user. In addition, define the task(s) the users will be performing and how often the task(s) need to be performed.
* [[Empirical]] measurement: Test the interface early on with real users who come in contact with the interface on a daily basis. Keep in mind that results may vary with the performance level of the user and may not accurately depict the typical human–computer interaction. Establish quantitative [[usability]] specifics such as: the number of users performing the task(s), the time to complete the task(s), and the number of errors made during the task(s).
* [[Iterative design]]: After determining the users, tasks, and empirical measurements to include, perform the following iterative design steps:
*# Design the user interface
*# Test
*# Analyze results
*# Repeat
Repeat the iterative design process until a sensible, user-friendly interface is created.&lt;ref name="engineering"/&gt;

===Methodologies===
A number of diverse methodologies outlining techniques for human–computer [[interaction design]] have emerged since the rise of the field in the 1980s. Most design methodologies stem from a model for how users, designers, and technical systems interact. Early methodologies, for example, treated users' cognitive processes as predictable and quantifiable and encouraged design practitioners to look to cognitive science results in areas such as memory and attention when designing user interfaces. Modern models tend to focus on a constant feedback and conversation between users, designers, and engineers and push for technical systems to be wrapped around the types of experiences users want to have, rather than wrapping [[user experience]] around a completed system.

* [[Activity theory]]: used in HCI to define and study the context in which human interactions with computers take place. Activity theory provides a framework to reason about actions in these contexts, analytical tools with the format of checklists of items that researchers should consider, and informs [[Interaction design|design of interaction]]s from an activity-centric perspective.&lt;ref name="interaction-design"/&gt;
* [[User-centered design]]: user-centered design (UCD) is a modern, widely practiced design philosophy rooted in the idea that users must take center-stage in the design of any computer system. Users, designers and technical practitioners work together to articulate the needs and limitations of the user and create a system that addresses these elements. Often, user-centered design projects are informed by [[ethnography|ethnographic]] studies of the environments in which users will be interacting with the system. This practice is similar to [[participatory design]], which emphasizes the possibility for end-users to contribute actively through shared design sessions and workshops.
* [[Principles of user interface design]]: these principles may be considered at any time during the [[User interface design|design of a user interface]] in any order: tolerance, simplicity, visibility, affordance, consistency, structure and feedback.&lt;ref name="mit"/&gt;
* [[Value sensitive design]] (VSD): a method for building technology that account for the values of the people who use the technology directly, as well as those who the technology affects, either directly or indirectly. VSD uses an iterative design process that involves three types of investigations: conceptual, empirical and technical. Conceptual investigations aim at understanding and articulating the various stakeholders of the technology, as well as their values and any values conflicts that might arise for these stakeholders through the use of the technology. Empirical investigations are qualitative or quantitative design research studies used to inform the designers' understanding of the users' values, needs, and practices. Technical investigations can involve either analysis of how people use related technologies, or the design of systems to support values identified in the conceptual and empirical investigations.&lt;ref name="value sensitive design"/&gt;

==Display designs==
Displays are human-made artifacts designed to support the perception of relevant system variables and to facilitate further processing of that information. Before a display is designed, the task that the display is intended to support must be defined (e.g. navigating, controlling, decision making, learning, entertaining, etc.). A user or operator must be able to process whatever information that a system generates and displays; therefore, the information must be displayed according to principles in a manner that will support perception, situation awareness, and understanding.

===Thirteen principles of display design===

Christopher Wickens et al. defined 13 principles of display design in their book ''An Introduction to Human Factors Engineering''.&lt;ref name="introduction"/&gt;

These principles of human perception and information processing can be utilized to create an effective display design. A reduction in errors, a reduction in required training time, an increase in efficiency, and an increase in user satisfaction are a few of the many potential benefits that can be achieved through utilization of these principles.

Certain principles may not be applicable to different displays or situations. Some principles may seem to be conflicting, and there is no simple solution to say that one principle is more important than another. The principles may be tailored to a specific design or situation. Striking a functional balance among the principles is critical for an effective design.&lt;ref name="guidelines"/&gt;

====Perceptual principles====

''1.	Make displays legible (or audible)''. A display's legibility is critical and necessary for designing a usable display. If the characters or objects being displayed cannot be discernible, then the operator cannot effectively make use of them.

''2.	Avoid absolute judgment limits''. Do not ask the user to determine the level of a variable on the basis of a single sensory variable (e.g. colour, size, loudness). These sensory variables can contain many possible levels.

''3.	Top-down processing''. Signals are likely perceived and interpreted in accordance with what is expected based on a user's experience. If a signal is presented contrary to the user's expectation, more physical evidence of that signal may need to be presented to assure that it is understood correctly.

''4.	Redundancy gain''. If a signal is presented more than once, it is more likely that it will be understood correctly. This can be done by presenting the signal in alternative physical forms (e.g. colour and shape, voice and print, etc.), as redundancy does not imply repetition. A traffic light is a good example of redundancy, as colour and position are redundant.

''5.	Similarity causes confusion: Use distinguishable elements''. Signals that appear to be similar will likely be confused. The ratio of similar features to different features causes signals to be similar. For example, A423B9 is more similar to A423B8 than 92 is to 93. Unnecessarily similar features should be removed and dissimilar features should be highlighted.

====Mental model principles====

''6.	Principle of pictorial realism''. A display should look like the variable that it represents (e.g. high temperature on a thermometer shown as a higher vertical level). If there are multiple elements, they can be configured in a manner that looks like it would in the represented environment.

''7.	Principle of the moving part''. Moving elements should move in a pattern and direction compatible with the user's mental model of how it actually moves in the system. For example, the moving element on an altimeter should move upward with increasing altitude.

====Principles based on attention====

''8.	Minimizing information access cost'' or [[interaction cost]]. When the user's attention is diverted from one location to another to access necessary information, there is an associated cost in time or effort. A display design should minimize this cost by allowing for frequently accessed sources to be located at the nearest possible position. However, adequate legibility should not be sacrificed to reduce this cost.

''9.	Proximity compatibility principle''. Divided attention between two information sources may be necessary for the completion of one task. These sources must be mentally integrated and are defined to have close mental proximity. Information access costs should be low, which can be achieved in many ways (e.g. proximity, linkage by common colours, patterns, shapes, etc.). However, close display proximity can be harmful by causing too much clutter.

''10.	Principle of multiple resources''. A user can more easily process information across different resources. For example, visual and auditory information can be presented simultaneously rather than presenting all visual or all auditory information.

====Memory principles====

''11.	Replace memory with visual information: knowledge in the world''. A user should not need to retain important information solely in working memory or retrieve it from long-term memory. A menu, checklist, or another display can aid the user by easing the use of their memory. However, the use of memory may sometimes benefit the user by eliminating the need to reference some type of knowledge in the world (e.g., an expert computer operator would rather use direct commands from memory than refer to a manual). The use of knowledge in a user's head and knowledge in the world must be balanced for an effective design.

''12.	Principle of predictive aiding''. Proactive actions are usually more effective than reactive actions. A display should attempt to eliminate resource-demanding cognitive tasks and replace them with simpler perceptual tasks to reduce the use of the user's mental resources. This will allow the user to focus on current conditions, and to consider possible future conditions. An example of a predictive aid is a road sign displaying the distance to a certain destination.

''13.	Principle of consistency''. Old habits from other displays will easily transfer to support processing of new displays if they are designed consistently. A user's long-term memory will trigger actions that are expected to be appropriate. A design must accept this fact and utilize consistency among different displays.

==Human–computer interface==
{{main article|User interface}}
The human–computer interface can be described as the point of communication between the human user and the computer. The flow of information between the human and computer is defined as the ''loop of interaction''. The loop of interaction has several aspects to it, including:

* Visual Based :The visual based human computer inter-action is probably the most widespread area in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) research.
* Audio Based : The audio based interaction between a computer and a human is another important area of in HCI systems. This area deals with information acquired by different audio signals.
* ''Task environment'': The conditions and goals set upon the user.
* ''Machine environment'': The environment that the computer is connected to, e.g. a laptop in a college student's dorm room.
* ''Areas of the interface'': Non-overlapping areas involve processes of the human and computer not pertaining to their interaction. Meanwhile, the overlapping areas only concern themselves with the processes pertaining to their interaction.
* ''Input flow'': The flow of information that begins in the task environment, when the user has some task that requires using their computer.
* ''Output'': The flow of information that originates in the machine environment.
* ''Feedback'': Loops through the interface that evaluate, moderate, and confirm processes as they pass from the human through the interface to the computer and back.
* ''Fit'': This is the match between the computer design, the user and the task to optimize the human resources needed to accomplish the task.

==Current research==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
Topics in human-computer interaction include:

===User customization===
[[End-user development]] studies how ordinary users could routinely tailor applications to their own needs and to invent new applications based on their understanding of their own domains. With their deeper knowledge, users could increasingly be important sources of new applications at the expense of generic programmers with systems expertise but low domain expertise.

===Embedded computation===
Computation is passing beyond computers into every object for which uses can be found. Embedded systems make the environment alive with little computations and automated processes, from computerized cooking appliances to lighting and plumbing fixtures to window blinds to automobile braking systems to greeting cards. The expected difference in the future is the addition of networked communications that will allow many of these embedded computations to coordinate with each other and with the user. [[Human interface device|Human interfaces]] to these embedded devices will in many cases be disparate from those appropriate to workstations.

===Augmented reality===
{{Main article|Augmented reality}}
Augmented reality refers to the notion of layering relevant information into our vision of the world. Existing projects show real-time statistics to users performing difficult tasks, such as manufacturing. Future work might include augmenting our social interactions by providing additional information about those we converse with.

===Social computing===
In recent years, there has been an explosion of social science research focusing on interactions as the unit of analysis. Much of this research draws from psychology, social psychology, and sociology. For example, one study found out that people expected a computer with a man's name to cost more than a machine with a woman's name.&lt;ref name=posard2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Posard|first1=Marek|title=Status processes in human–computer interactions: Does gender matter?|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=2014|issue=37|pages=189–195|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563214002349|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2014.04.025|volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research finds that individuals perceive their interactions with computers more positively than humans, despite behaving the same way towards these machines.&lt;ref name=posardrinderknecht2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Posard|first1=Marek|last2=Rinderknecht|first2=R. Gordon|title=Do people like working with computers more than human beings?|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=2015|volume=51|pages=232–238|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563215003520|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2015.04.057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge-driven human–computer interaction===
In human and computer interactions, a semantic gap usually exists between human and computer's understandings towards mutual behaviors. [[Ontology (information science)]], as a formal representation of domain-specific knowledge, can be used to address this problem, through solving the semantic ambiguities between the two parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dong|first1=Hai|last2=Hussain|first2=Farookh|last3=Elizabeth|first3=Chang|title=A human-centered semantic service platform for the digital ecosystems environment|journal=World Wide Web|volume=13|issue=1–2|pages=75–103|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220301904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emotions and human-computer interaction ===
In the interaction of humans and computers, research has studied how computers can detect, process and react to human emotions to develop emotionally intelligent information systems. Researchers have suggested several 'affect-detection channels'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calvo, R., &amp; D'Mello S.|first=|date=2010|title=Affect detection: An interdisciplinary review of models, methods, and their applications|url=|journal=IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing|volume=1|issue=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The potential of telling human emotions in an automated and digital fashion lies in improvements to the effectiveness of human-computer interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cowie, R., Douglas-Cowie, E., Tsapatsoulis, N., Votsis, G., Kollias, S., Fellenz, W., &amp; Taylor, J.

===Brain–computer interfaces===
{{main|Brain–computer interface}}

==Factors of change==
Traditionally, computer use was modeled as a human–computer dyad in which the two were connected by a narrow explicit communication channel, such as text-based terminals. Much work has been done to make the interaction between a computing system and a human more reflective of the multidimensional nature of everyday communication. Because of potential issues, human–computer interaction shifted focus beyond the interface to respond to observations as articulated by D. Engelbart: "If ease of use was the only valid criterion, people would stick to tricycles and never try bicycles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fischer|first=Gerhard|date=1 May 2000 |title=User Modeling in Human–Computer Interaction |journal=User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction |volume=11 |issue=1–2 |pages= 65–86 |doi=10.1023/A:1011145532042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The means by which humans interact with computers continues to evolve rapidly. Human–computer interaction is affected by developments in computing. These forces include:

* Decreasing hardware costs leading to larger memory and faster systems
* Miniaturization of hardware leading to portability
* Reduction in power requirements leading to portability
* New display technologies leading to the packaging of computational devices in new forms
* Specialized hardware leading to new functions
* Increased development of network communication and distributed computing
* Increasingly widespread use of computers, especially by people who are outside of the computing profession
* Increasing innovation in input techniques (e.g., voice, [[gesture recognition|gesture]], pen), combined with lowering cost, leading to rapid computerization by people formerly left out of the ''computer revolution''.
* Wider social concerns leading to improved access to computers by currently disadvantaged groups

{{Asof|2010}} the future for HCI is expected&lt;ref&gt;SINHA, Gaurav; SHAHI, Rahul; SHANKAR, Mani. Human Computer Interaction. In: Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology (ICETET), 2010 3rd International Conference on. IEEE, 2010. p. 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt; to include the following characteristics:

* ''[[Ubiquitous computing]] and communication''. Computers are expected to communicate through high speed local networks, nationally over wide-area networks, and portably via infrared, ultrasonic, cellular, and other technologies. Data and computational services will be portably accessible from many if not most locations to which a user travels.
* ''High-functionality systems''. Systems can have large numbers of functions associated with them. There are so many systems that most users, technical or non-technical, do not have time to learn them in the traditional way (e.g., through thick manuals).
* ''Mass availability of computer graphics''. Computer graphics capabilities such as image processing, graphics transformations, rendering, and interactive animation are becoming widespread as inexpensive chips become available for inclusion in general workstations and mobile devices.
* ''Mixed media''. Commercial systems can handle images, voice, sounds, video, text, formatted data. These are exchangeable over communication links among users. The separate fields of consumer electronics (e.g., stereo sets, VCRs, televisions) and computers are merging partly. Computer and print fields are expected to cross-assimilate.
* ''High-[[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] interaction''. The rate at which humans and machines interact is expected to increase substantially due to the changes in speed, computer graphics, new media, and new input/output devices. This can lead to some qualitatively different interfaces, such as [[virtual reality]] or computational video.
* ''Large and thin [[displays]]''. New display technologies are maturing, enabling very large displays and displays that are thin, lightweight, and low in power use. This is having large effects on portability and will likely enable developing paper-like, pen-based computer interaction systems very different in feel from present desktop workstations.
* ''Information utilities''. Public information utilities (such as home banking and shopping) and specialized industry services (e.g., weather for pilots) are expected to proliferate. The rate of proliferation can accelerate with the introduction of high-bandwidth interaction and the improvement in quality of interfaces.

==Scientific conferences==
One of the main conferences for new research in human–computer interaction is the annually held [[Association for Computing Machinery]]'s (ACM) ''[[Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems]]'', usually referred to by its short name CHI (pronounced ''kai'', or ''khai''). CHI is organized by ACM Special Interest Group on Computer–Human Interaction ([[SIGCHI]]). CHI is a large conference, with thousands of attendants, and is quite broad in scope. It is attended by academics, practitioners and industry people, with company sponsors such as Google, Microsoft, and PayPal.

There are also dozens of other smaller, regional or specialized HCI-related conferences held around the world each year, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.confsearch.org/confsearch/faces/pages/topic.jsp?topic=hci&amp;sortMode=1&amp;graphicView=true|title=Conference Search: hci|website=www.confsearch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International VELUX Award''' challenges students of architecture to explore the theme of sunlight and daylight. The award is biennial and was first presented in 2004.

The award celebrates excellence in completed works on any scale from a small scale component to large urban contexts or abstract concepts and experimentation. The award is presented by [[VELUX]] in close cooperation with the [[International Union of Architects]] (UIA) and the European Association for Architectural Education (EAAE).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eaae.be/eaae2/index.php European Association for Architectural Education] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417013813/http://www.eaae.be/eaae2/index.php |date=2008-04-17 }} Official website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
“Light of Tomorrow” is the theme of the International VELUX Award. The award wants to challenge the future of daylight in the built environment. The award contains no specific categories and is in no way restricted to the use of VELUX products. The jury of the International VELUX Award comprises internationally recognized architects and other building professionals. Any registered student of architecture – individual or team – from all over the world may participate in the award. The award wants to acknowledge not only the students but their teachers as well. Therefore, all students must be backed and granted submission by a teacher from a school of architecture.

== History ==
The first International VELUX Award took place in 2004. 760 students from 194 schools in 34 countries in Europe registered, and 258 students from 106 schools in 27 countries submitted their projects. The international jury led by [[Glenn Murcutt]] selected three winners and eight honourable mentions, who were announced at the Award event held in Paris.

== 2004 winners ==
In 2004 the first prize went to Norwegian student Claes Heske Ekornås for his project “Light as matter”. In 2004, ten winners were announced at the Award event in Paris.

== 2006 winners ==
In 2006, the award went global – inviting students from all over the world to participate. The number of submissions more than doubled reaching 557 projects from 225 schools in 53 countries. The international jury led by Per Olaf Fjeld decided to award three winners and 17 honourable mentions, and they were all celebrated at the Award event at the [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao|Guggenheim Museum]] in Bilbao, Spain.

Louise Groenlund of Denmark won the International VELUX Award for her project ”A museum of photography”. Twenty winners and honourable mentions were announced at the Award event at the Guggenheim Bilbao in November 2006.

== 2008 winners ==
In 2008, the award received 686 projects, representing 244 schools of architecture in 46 countries. The international jury led by jury chairman Hani Rashid of [[Asymptote Architecture]] decided to award three winners and eight honourable mentions, who were celebrated at the Pisani Palace in Venice in November 2008.

The jury appointed three prize winners and eight honourable mentions. Reilly O’Neil Hogan from [[Cornell University]], USA, won first prize for his project “Embodied Ephemerality”. Ruan Hau and Xiong Xing from [[Tsinghua University]] in Beijing won second prize for their project ”Interface repairing – Light Festival”. Dean Carlo MacGregor from [[Lusíada University]] in Lisbon, Portugal, won third prize for his project “Light has a body”.

== 2010 winners ==
In 2010, the award represented more countries than ever before. There were 673 entries from 280 schools in 55 countries. The international jury led by jury chairman Magda Mostafa decided to award three winners and eight honourable mentions. They were celebrated at the award event on 6 October 2010 in [[La Rochelle]], France.

The jury appointed three prize winners and eight honourable mentions. Young-Gook Park, Kim Dea Hyun, Choi Jin Kyu and Kim Won Ill from Hanyang University, South Korea, won the first prize for their project Constellation of Light Field. Ma Xin, Wang Rui and Yang Meng from the Architecture School of Tianjin University, China, won the second prize for their project Condensation of Variational Sunlight Influences. Joe Wu from Delft University of Technology, TU Delft, the Netherlands, also won the second prize for his project Lightscape between gaps.

{{refimprove|date=September 2018}}
An '''intrusion detection system''' ('''IDS''') is a device or [[software application]] that monitors a [[Computer network|network]] or systems for malicious activity or policy violations. Any malicious activity or violation is typically reported either to an administrator or collected centrally using a [[security information and event management]] (SIEM) system. A SIEM system combines outputs from multiple sources, and uses [[alarm filtering]] techniques to distinguish malicious activity from false alarms.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

IDS types range in scope from single computers to large networks.&lt;ref&gt; Axelsson, S (2000). [http://neuro.bstu.by/ai/To-dom/My_research/Paper-0-again/For-research/D-mining/Anomaly-D/Intrusion-detection/taxonomy.pdf "Intrusion Detection Systems: A Survey and Taxonomy"] (retrieved 21 May 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; The most common classifications are '''network intrusion detection systems''' ('''NIDS''') and '''[[host-based intrusion detection system]]s''' ('''HIDS'''). A system that monitors important operating system files is an example of an HIDS, while a system that analyzes incoming network traffic is an example of an NIDS. It is also possible to classify IDS by detection approach: the most well-known variants are signature-based detection (recognizing bad patterns, such as [[malware]]); and [[Anomaly-based intrusion detection system|anomaly-based detection]] (detecting deviations from a model of "good" traffic, which often relies on [[machine learning]]). Some IDS products have the ability to respond to detected intrusions. Systems with response capabilities are typically referred to as an '''intrusion prevention system'''.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

== Comparison with firewalls ==
Although they both relate to network security, an IDS differs from a [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] in that a firewall looks outwardly for intrusions in order to stop them from happening. Firewalls limit access between networks to prevent intrusion and do not signal an attack from inside the network. An IDS describes a suspected intrusion once it has taken place and signals an alarm. An IDS also watches for attacks that originate from within a system.  This is traditionally achieved by examining network communications, identifying [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristics]] and patterns (often known as signatures) of common computer attacks, and taking action to alert operators.  A system that terminates connections is called an intrusion prevention system, and is another form of an [[application layer firewall]].{{fact|date=September 2018}}

== Intrusion detection ==
IDS can be classified by where detection takes place (network or [[Host (network)|host]]) and the detection method that is employed.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

For IDS related to [[Wireless sensor network|Wireless Sensor Networks]] (WSNs), readers may refer to Butun et al.'s &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butun|first=Ismail|last2=Morgera|first2=Salvatore D.|last3=Sankar|first3=Ravi|date=2014|title=A Survey of Intrusion Detection Systems in Wireless Sensor Networks|url=https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2013.050113.00191|journal=IEEE Communications Surveys &amp; Tutorials|language=en-US|volume=16|issue=1|pages=266–282|doi=10.1109/surv.2013.050113.00191|issn=1553-877X}}&lt;/ref&gt; work.

=== Analyzed activity ===

====Network intrusion detection systems====
Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are placed at a strategic point or points within the network to monitor traffic to and from all devices on the network. It performs an analysis of passing traffic on the entire [[Subnetwork|subnet]], and matches the traffic that is passed on the subnets to the library of known attacks. Once an attack is identified, or abnormal behavior is sensed, the alert can be sent to the administrator. An example of an NIDS would be installing it on the subnet where firewalls are located in order to see if someone is trying to break into the firewall. Ideally one would scan all inbound and outbound traffic, however doing so might create a bottleneck that would impair the overall speed of the network. [[OPNET]] and NetSim are commonly used tools for simulating network intrusion detection systems. NID Systems are also capable of comparing signatures for similar packets to link and drop harmful detected packets which have a signature matching the records in the NIDS.
When we classify the design of the NIDS according to the system interactivity property, there are two types: on-line and off-line NIDS, often referred to as inline and tap mode, respectively. On-line NIDS deals with the network in real time. It analyses the [[Ethernet frame|Ethernet packets]] and applies some rules, to decide if it is an attack or not. Off-line NIDS deals with stored data and passes it through some processes to decide if it is an attack or not.

NIDS can also combined with other technologies to increase detection, and prediction, rates. [[Artificial neural network|Artificial Neural Network]] based IDS are capable of analyzing huge volumes of data, in a smart way, due to the self-organizing structure that allows INS IDS to more efficiently recognize intrusion patterns&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garzia|first=Fabio|last2=Lombardi|first2=Mara|last3=Ramalingam|first3=Soodamani|date=2017|title=An integrated internet of everything — Genetic algorithms controller — Artificial neural networks framework for security/safety systems management and support|url=https://doi.org/10.1109/CCST.2017.8167863|journal=2017 International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology (ICCST)|language=en-US|publisher=IEEE|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1109/ccst.2017.8167863|isbn=9781538615850|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Neural networks assist IDS in predicting attacks by learning from mistakes; INN IDS help develop an early warning system, based on two layers. The first layer accepts single values, while the second layer takes the first's layers output as input; the cycle repeats and allows the system to automatically recognize new unforeseen patterns in the network&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vilela|first=Douglas W.

This system can average 99.9% detection and classification rate, based on research results of 24 network attacks, divided in four categories: DOS, Probe, Remote-to-Local, and user-to-root.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dias|first=L.

====Host intrusion detection systems====
{{Main article|Host-based intrusion detection system}}
Host intrusion detection systems (HIDS) run on individual hosts or devices on the network. A HIDS monitors the inbound and outbound packets from the device only and will alert the user or administrator if suspicious activity is detected. It takes a snapshot of existing system files and matches it to the previous snapshot. If the critical system files were modified or deleted, an alert is sent to the administrator to investigate. An example of HIDS usage can be seen on mission critical machines, which are not expected to change their configurations.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

Intrusion detection systems can also be system-specific using custom tools and [[honeypot (computing)|honeypots]].{{fact|date=September 2018}}

=== Detection method ===

====Signature-based====
Signature-based IDS refers to the detection of attacks by looking for specific patterns, such as byte sequences in network traffic, or known malicious instruction sequences used by malware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iup.edu/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=81109 |website=www.iup.edu |format=[[Microsoft PowerPoint|PPT]] |author=Brandon Lokesak |date=December 4, 2008 |title=A Comparison Between Signature Based and Anomaly Based Intrusion Detection Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; This terminology originates from [[anti-virus software]], which refers to these detected patterns as signatures. Although signature-based IDS can easily detect known attacks, it is difficult to detect new attacks, for which no pattern is available.{{fact|date=September 2018}}
{{expand section|date=July 2016}}

In Signature-based IDS, the signatures are released by a vendor for its all products. On-time updation of the IDS with the signature is a key aspect

====Anomaly-based====
[[Anomaly-based intrusion detection system]]s were primarily introduced to detect unknown attacks, in part due to the rapid development of malware. The basic approach is to use machine learning to create a model of trustworthy activity, and then compare new behavior against this model. Although this approach enables the detection of previously unknown attacks, it may suffer from [[false positives]]: previously unknown legitimate activity may also be classified as malicious. Most of the existing IDSs suffer from the time-consuming during detection process that degrades the performance of IDSs. Efficient feature selection algorithm makes the classification process used in detection more reliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowayda|first=A. Sadek|author2=M Sami, Soliman|author3=Hagar, S Elsayed|title=Effective anomaly intrusion detection system based on neural network with indicator variable and rough set reduction|journal= International Journal of Computer Science Issues (IJCSI)|date=November 2013|volume=10|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New types of what could be called anomaly-based intrusion detection systems are being viewed by [[Gartner]] as User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/3134524?ref=SiteSearch&amp;sthkw=avivah%20litan&amp;fnl=search&amp;srcId=1-3478922254|title=Gartner report: Market Guide for User and Entity Behavior Analytics|last=|first=|date=September 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (an evolution of the [[user behavior analytics]] category) and network traffic analysis (NTA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/3367417?ref=SiteSearch&amp;sthkw=hype%20cycle%20for%20infrastructure&amp;fnl=search&amp;srcId=1-3478922254|title=Gartner: Hype Cycle for Infrastructure Protection, 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, NTA deals with malicious insiders as well as targeted external attacks that have compromised a user machine or account. Gartner has noted that some organizations have opted for NTA over more traditional IDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/3449317?ref=SiteSearch&amp;sthkw=intrusion%20detection&amp;fnl=search&amp;srcId=1-3478922254|title=Gartner: Defining Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intrusion prevention ==

Some systems may attempt to stop an intrusion attempt but this is neither required nor expected of a monitoring system. Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) are primarily focused on identifying possible incidents, logging information about them, and reporting attempts.  In addition, organizations use IDPS for other purposes, such as identifying problems with security policies, documenting existing threats and deterring individuals from violating security policies. IDPS have become a necessary addition to the security infrastructure of nearly every organization.&lt;ref name="nist80094"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-94/SP800-94.pdf |title=Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) |first1=Karen |last1=Scarfone |first2=Peter |last2=Mell |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |work=Computer Security Resource Center |issue=800–94 |accessdate=1 January 2010 |date=February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IDPS typically record information related to observed events, notify security administrators of important observed events and produce reports. Many IDPS can also respond to a detected threat by attempting to prevent it from succeeding. They use several response techniques, which involve the IDPS stopping the attack itself, changing the security environment (e.g. reconfiguring a firewall) or changing the attack's content.&lt;ref name="nist80094" /&gt;

'''Intrusion prevention systems''' ('''IPS'''), also known as '''intrusion detection and prevention systems''' ('''IDPS'''), are [[network security]] appliances that monitor network or system activities for malicious activity. The main functions of intrusion prevention systems are to identify malicious activity, log information about this activity, report it and attempt to block or stop it.{{r|GIDPS}}.

Intrusion prevention systems are considered extensions of intrusion detection systems because they both monitor network traffic and/or system activities for malicious activity. The main differences are, unlike intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems are placed in-line and are able to actively prevent or block intrusions that are detected.{{r|Newman2009|page1=273|WhitmanMattord2009|page2=289}} IPS can take such actions as sending an alarm, dropping detected malicious packets, resetting a connection or blocking traffic from the offending IP address.{{r|Boyles2010}} An IPS also can correct {{nobr|[[cyclic redundancy check]] (CRC)}} errors, defragment packet streams, mitigate TCP sequencing issues, and clean up unwanted [[Transport layer|transport]] and [[network layer]] options.{{r|Newman2009|page1=278|TiptonKrause2007}}.

=== Classification ===
Intrusion prevention systems can be classified into four different types:{{r|GIDPS|Vacca2010}}

# '''Network-based intrusion prevention system (NIPS)''':  monitors the entire network for suspicious traffic by analyzing protocol activity.
# '''Wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS)''': monitor a wireless network for suspicious traffic by analyzing wireless networking protocols.
# '''Network behavior analysis (NBA)''': examines network traffic to identify threats that generate unusual traffic flows, such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, certain forms of malware and policy violations.
# '''Host-based intrusion prevention system (HIPS)''': an installed software package which monitors a single host for suspicious activity by analyzing events occurring within that host.

=== Detection methods ===
The majority of intrusion prevention systems utilize one of three detection methods: signature-based, statistical anomaly-based, and stateful protocol analysis.{{r|WhitmanMattord2009|page1=301|KirdaJha2009}}

# '''Signature-based detection''': Signature-based IDS monitors packets in the Network and compares with pre-configured and pre-determined attack patterns known as signatures.
# '''Statistical anomaly-based detection''': An IDS which is anomaly-based will monitor network traffic and compare it against an established baseline. The baseline will identify what is "normal" for that network – what sort of bandwidth is generally used and what protocols are used. It may however, raise a False Positive alarm for legitimate use of bandwidth if the baselines are not intelligently configured.&lt;ref name="Whitman"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Stateful protocol analysis detection''': This method identifies deviations of protocol states by comparing observed events with "pre-determined profiles of generally accepted definitions of benign activity".{{r|WhitmanMattord2009}}

== Limitations ==
* [[noise (signal processing)|Noise]] can severely limit an intrusion detection system's effectiveness.  Bad packets generated from  software bugs, corrupt [[DNS]] data, and local packets that escaped can create a significantly high false-alarm rate.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite book

 |year = 2001
 |pages = 387–388
 |isbn = 978-0-471-38922-4
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is not uncommon for the number of real attacks to be far below the number of false-alarms. Number of real attacks is often so far below the number of false-alarms that the real attacks are often missed and ignored.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt;{{Update inline|date=August 2017}}
* Many attacks are geared for specific versions of software that are usually outdated.  A constantly changing library of signatures is needed to mitigate threats. Outdated signature databases can leave the IDS vulnerable to newer strategies.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt;
* For signature-based IDS, there will be lag between a new threat discovery and its signature being applied to the IDS. During this lag time, the IDS will be unable to identify the threat.&lt;ref name="Whitman" /&gt;
* It cannot compensate for weak identification and [[authentication]] mechanisms or for weaknesses in [[network protocol]]s. When an attacker gains access due to weak authentication mechanisms then IDS cannot prevent the adversary from any malpractice.
* Encrypted packets are not processed by most intrusion detection devices. Therefore, the encrypted packet can allow an intrusion to the network that is undiscovered until more significant network intrusions have occurred.
* Intrusion detection software provides information based on the [[network address]] that is associated with the IP packet that is sent into the network. This is beneficial if the network address contained in the IP packet is accurate. However, the address that is contained in the IP packet could be faked or scrambled.
* Due to the nature of NIDS systems, and the need for them to analyse protocols as they are captured, NIDS systems can be susceptible to the same protocol-based attacks to which network hosts may be vulnerable. Invalid data and [[TCP/IP stack]] attacks may cause an NIDS to crash.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.giac.org/paper/gsec/235/limitations-network-intrusion-detection/100739&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evasion techniques ==
{{main article|Intrusion detection system evasion techniques}}
There are a number of techniques which attackers are using, the following are considered 'simple' measures which can be taken to evade IDS:
* Fragmentation: by sending fragmented packets, the attacker will be under the radar and can easily bypass the  detection system's ability to detect the attack signature.
* Avoiding defaults: The TCP port utilised by a protocol does not always provide an indication to the protocol which is being transported. For example, an IDS may expect to detect a [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan]] on port 12345. If an attacker had reconfigured it to use a different port, the IDS may not be able to detect the presence of the trojan.
* Coordinated, low-bandwidth attacks: coordinating a scan among numerous attackers (or agents) and allocating different ports or hosts to different attackers makes it difficult for the IDS to correlate the captured packets and deduce that a network scan is in progress.
* Address [[Spoofing attack|spoofing]]/proxying: attackers can increase the difficulty of the Security Administrators ability to determine the source of the attack by using poorly secured or incorrectly configured proxy servers to bounce an attack. If the source is spoofed and bounced by a server, it makes it very difficult for IDS to detect the origin of the attack.
* Pattern change evasion: IDS generally rely on 'pattern matching' to detect an attack. By changing the data used in the attack slightly, it may be possible to evade detection. For example, an {{nobr|[[Internet Message Access Protocol]]}} (IMAP) server may be vulnerable to a buffer overflow, and an IDS is able to detect the attack signature of 10 common attack tools. By modifying the payload sent by the tool, so that it does not resemble the data that the IDS expects, it may be possible to evade detection.

== Development ==
The earliest preliminary IDS concept was delineated in 1980 by James Anderson at the [[National Security Agency]] and consisted of a set of tools intended to help administrators review audit trails.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, James P., "Computer Security Threat Monitoring and Surveillance," Washing, PA, James P. Anderson Co., 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;  User access logs, file access logs, and system event logs are examples of audit trails.

[[Fred Cohen]] noted in 1987 that it is impossible to detect an intrusion in every case, and that the resources needed to detect intrusions grow with the amount of usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=David M. Chess |author2=Steve R. White |work=Proceedings of Virus Bulletin Conference |title=An Undetectable Computer Virus |date=2000 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.25.1508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dorothy E. Denning]], assisted by [[Peter G. Neumann]], published a model of an IDS in 1986 that formed the basis for many systems today.&lt;ref&gt;Denning, Dorothy E., "An Intrusion Detection Model," Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, May 1986, pages 119–131&lt;/ref&gt;  Her model used statistics for [[anomaly detection]], and resulted in an early IDS at [[SRI International]] named the Intrusion Detection Expert System (IDES), which ran on [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] workstations and could consider both user and network level data.&lt;ref&gt;Lunt, Teresa F., "IDES:  An Intelligent System for Detecting Intruders," Proceedings of the Symposium on Computer Security; Threats, and Countermeasures; Rome, Italy, November 22–23, 1990, pages 110–121.&lt;/ref&gt;  IDES had a dual approach with a rule-based [[Expert System]] to detect known types of intrusions plus a statistical anomaly detection component based on profiles of users, host systems, and target systems. The author of "IDES: An Intelligent System for Detecting Intruders," Teresa F. Lunt, proposed adding an [[Artificial neural network]] as a third component.  She said all three components could then report to a resolver.  SRI followed IDES  in 1993 with the Next-generation Intrusion Detection Expert System (NIDES).&lt;ref&gt;Lunt, Teresa F., "Detecting Intruders in Computer Systems," 1993 Conference on Auditing and Computer Technology, SRI International&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Multics]] intrusion detection and alerting system (MIDAS), an expert system using P-BEST and [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], was developed in 1988 based on the work of Denning and Neumann.&lt;ref&gt;Sebring, Michael M., and Whitehurst, R. Alan., "Expert Systems in Intrusion Detection:  A Case Study," The 11th National Computer Security Conference, October, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;  Haystack was also developed in that year using statistics to reduce audit trails.&lt;ref&gt;Smaha, Stephen E., "Haystack:  An Intrusion Detection System," The Fourth Aerospace Computer Security Applications Conference, Orlando, FL, December, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 the [[National Security Agency]] started an IDS research transfer program under [[Rebecca Bace]]. Bace later published the seminal text on the subject, ''Intrusion Detection'', in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGraw|first1=Gary|title=Silver Bullet Talks with Becky Bace|journal=IEEE Security &amp; Privacy Magazine|date=May 2007|volume=5|issue=3|pages=6–9|doi=10.1109/MSP.2007.70|url=https://www.cigital.com/silver-bullet-files/shows/silverbullet-012-bbace.pdf|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wisdom &amp; Sense (W&amp;S) was a statistics-based anomaly detector developed in 1989 at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;Vaccaro, H.S., and Liepins, G.E., "Detection of Anomalous Computer Session Activity," The 1989 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, May, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  W&amp;S created rules based on statistical analysis, and then used those rules for anomaly detection.

In 1990, the Time-based Inductive Machine (TIM) did anomaly detection using inductive learning of sequential user patterns in [[Common Lisp]] on a [[VAX]] 3500 computer.&lt;ref&gt;Teng, Henry S., Chen, Kaihu, and Lu, Stephen C-Y, "Adaptive Real-time Anomaly Detection Using Inductively Generated Sequential Patterns," 1990 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy&lt;/ref&gt;  The Network Security Monitor (NSM) performed masking on access matrices for anomaly detection on a Sun-3/50 workstation.&lt;ref&gt;Heberlein, L. Todd, Dias, Gihan V., Levitt, Karl N., Mukherjee, Biswanath, Wood, Jeff, and Wolber, David, "A Network Security Monitor," 1990 Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy, Oakland, CA, pages 296–304&lt;/ref&gt;  The Information Security Officer's Assistant (ISOA) was a 1990 prototype that considered a variety of strategies including statistics, a profile checker, and an expert system.&lt;ref&gt;Winkeler, J.R., "A UNIX Prototype for Intrusion and Anomaly Detection in Secure Networks," The Thirteenth National Computer Security Conference, Washington, DC., pages 115–124, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  ComputerWatch at [[AT&amp;T Bell Labs]] used statistics and rules for audit data reduction and intrusion detection.&lt;ref&gt;Dowell, Cheri, and Ramstedt, Paul, "The ComputerWatch Data Reduction Tool," Proceedings of the 13th National Computer Security Conference, Washington, D.C., 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, in 1991, researchers at the [[University of California, Davis]] created a prototype Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS), which was also an expert system.&lt;ref&gt;Snapp, Steven R, Brentano, James, Dias, Gihan V., Goan, Terrance L., Heberlein, L. Todd, Ho, Che-Lin, Levitt, Karl N., Mukherjee, Biswanath, Smaha, Stephen E., Grance, Tim, Teal, Daniel M. and Mansur, Doug, "DIDS (Distributed Intrusion Detection System) -- Motivation, Architecture, and An Early Prototype," The 14th National Computer Security Conference, October, 1991, pages 167–176.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Network Anomaly Detection and Intrusion Reporter (NADIR), also in 1991, was a prototype IDS developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory's Integrated Computing Network (ICN), and was heavily influenced by the work of Denning and Lunt.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Kathleen, DuBois, David H., and Stallings, Cathy A., "A Phased Approach to Network Intrusion Detection," 14th National Computing Security Conference, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;  NADIR used a statistics-based anomaly detector and an expert system.

The [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] announced [[Bro (software)|Bro]] in 1998, which used its own rule language for packet analysis from [[libpcap]] data.&lt;ref&gt;Paxson, Vern, "Bro:  A System for Detecting Network Intruders in Real-Time," Proceedings of the 7th USENIX Security Symposium, San Antonio, TX, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  Network Flight Recorder (NFR) in 1999 also used libpcap.&lt;ref&gt;Amoroso, Edward, "Intrusion Detection:  An Introduction to Internet Surveillance, Correlation, Trace Back, Traps, and Response," Intrusion.Net Books, Sparta, New Jersey, 1999, {{ISBN|0-9666700-7-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

APE was developed as a packet sniffer, also using libpcap, in November, 1998, and was renamed [[Snort (software)|Snort]] one month later. Snort has since become the world's largest used IDS/IPS system with over 300,000 active users.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlenberg, Toby (Ed.), Alder, Raven, Carter, Dr. Everett F. (Skip), Jr., Esler, Joel., Foster, James C., Jonkman Marty, Raffael, and Poor, Mike, "Snort IDS and IPS Toolkit," Syngress, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-59749-099-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can monitor both local systems, and remote capture points using the [[TZSP]] protocol.

The Audit Data Analysis and Mining (ADAM) IDS in 2001 used [[tcpdump]] to build profiles of rules for classifications.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara, Daniel, Couto, Julia, Jajodia, Sushil, Popyack, Leonard, and Wu, Ningning, "ADAM:  Detecting Intrusions by Data Mining," Proceedings of the IEEE Workshop on Information Assurance and Security, West Point, NY, June 5–6, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[Yongguang Zhang]] and Wenke Lee argue for the importance of IDS in networks with mobile nodes.&lt;ref&gt;Intrusion Detection Techniques for Mobile Wireless Networks, ACM WINET 2003 &lt;http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~wenke/papers/winet03.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Viegas and his colleagues &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Viegas|first=E.|last2=Santin|first2=A. O.|last3=Fran?a|first3=A.|last4=Jasinski|first4=R.|last5=Pedroni|first5=V.

In [[paleontology]], a '''Lazarus taxon''' (plural ''taxa'') is a [[taxon]] that disappears for one or more periods from the [[fossil record]], only to appear again later. Likewise in [[conservation biology]] and [[ecology]], it can refer to species or populations that were thought to be extinct, and are rediscovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryan|first1=Gerard|last2=Baker|first2=Christopher|title=A general method for assessing the risks and benefits of secrecy in conserving ‘Lazarus species’|journal=Biological Conservation|date=November 2016| volume=203|pages=186–187|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2016.09.022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Lazarus taxon was coined by Karl W. Flessa; &amp; David Jablonski in 1983 and was then expanded by Jablonski in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jablonski|first=David|date=1986 |title=Background and Mass Extinctions: The Alternation of Macroevolutionary Regimes |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]  |volume=231|issue=4734|pages=129–133|doi=10.1126/science.231.4734.129|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17842630}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wignall and Benton defined Lazarus taxon as, ‘At times of biotic crisis many taxa go extinct, but others only temporarily disappeared from the fossil record, often for intervals measured in millions of years, before reappearing unchanged’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wignall |first=P. B. |last2=Benton |first2=M. J.|title=Lazarus taxa and fossil abundance at times of biotic crisis |journal=Journal of the Geological Society|volume=156|issue=3|pages=453–456|doi=10.1144/gsjgs.156.3.0453}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier work also supports the concept though without using the name Lazarus taxon, like work by Christopher R. C. Paul.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The adequacy of the fossil record|date=1998|publisher=John Wiley |last=Donovan |first=S. K. |last2=Paul |first2=C. R. C. |isbn=0471969885|location=Chichester|oclc=38281286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term refers to the story in the Christian biblical [[Gospel of John]], in which [[Jesus Christ]] raised [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] from the dead.

== Potential explanations ==
Lazarus taxa are [[Artifact (observational)|observational artifact]]s that appear to occur either because of (local) [[extinction]], later resupplied, or as a [[sampling (statistics)|sampling artifact]]. The [[fossil]] record is inherently sporadic (only a very small fraction of organisms become fossilized, and an even smaller fraction are discovered before destruction) and contains gaps not necessarily caused by extinction, particularly when the number of individuals in a taxon is very low.

After [[mass extinction]]s, such as the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]], the Lazarus effect occurred for many taxa. However, there appears to be no link with the abundance of fossiliferous sites and the proportion of Lazarus taxa, and no missing taxa have been found in potential [[Refugium (population biology)|refuges]]. Therefore, reappearance of Lazarus taxa probably reflects the rebound after a period of extreme rarity during the aftermath of such extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Wignall|first1= P. B.|last2= Benton|first2= M. J.|year= 1999|title= Lazarus Taxa and Fossil Abundance at Times of Biotic Crisis|journal= Journal of the Geological Society|volume= 156|issue= |pages= 453–456|url= https://www.questia.com/library/1P3-41305234/lazarus-taxa-and-fossil-abundance-at-times-of-biot | doi = 10.1144/gsjgs.156.3.0453 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related but distinct concepts ==
An [[Elvis taxon]] is a look-alike that has supplanted an extinct taxon through [[convergent evolution]].

A [[zombie taxon]] is a taxon that contains specimens that have been collected from strata younger than the extinction of the taxon. Later such fossils turn out to be freed from the original seam and refossilized in a younger sediment. For example, a trilobite that gets eroded out of its Cambrian-aged limestone matrix, and [[reworked fossil|reworked]] into Miocene-aged siltstone.

A [[living fossil]] is an [[Extant taxon|extant]] taxon that appears to have changed so little compared with fossil remains, that it is considered identical. Living fossils may occur regularly in the fossil record, such as the lampshell ''[[Lingula (genus)|Lingula]]'', though the living species in this genus are not identical to fossil [[brachiopods]].&lt;ref name='Emig'&gt;{{cite journal | first= Christian C. | last= Emig | year= 2008 | title= On the history of the names Lingula, anatina, and on the confusion of the forms assigned them among the Brachiopoda | journal= Carnets de Géologie [Notebooks on Geology] | issue= Article 2008/08 | url= http://paleopolis.rediris.es/cg/CG2008_A08/CG2008_A08.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other living fossils however are also Lazarus taxa if these have been missing from the fossil record for substantial periods of time, such as applies for [[coelacanth]]s.

Finally, the term "Lazarus species" is applied to organisms that have been rediscovered as being still alive after having been widely considered extinct for years, without ever having appeared in the fossil record. In this last case, the term Lazarus taxon is applied in [[neontology]].

== Discussions ==
Because the definition of a Lazarus taxon is ambiguous, some like R. B. Rickards, do not agree with the existence of a Lazarus taxon.

=== R. B. Rickards &amp; A. J. Wright ===
Rickards and Wright questioned the usefulness of the concept of a Lazarus taxon. They wrote in "Lazarus taxa, refugia and relict faunas: evidence from graptolites" that anyone could argue that any gap in the fossil record could potentially be considered a Lazarus eﬀect because the duration required for the Lazarus eﬀect is not deﬁned.&lt;ref name="RICKARDS 1–4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=RICKARDS|first=R. B.|last2=WRIGHT|first2=A. J.|title=Lazarus taxa, refugia and relict faunas: evidence from graptolites|url=https://doi.org/10.1144/0016-764901058|journal=Journal of the Geological Society|volume=159|issue=1|pages=1–4|doi=10.1144/0016-764901058}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believed accurate plotting of biodiversity changes and species abundance through time, coupled with an appraisal of their palaeobiogeography was more important than using this title to categorize species.&lt;ref name="RICKARDS 1–4"/&gt;

== Communication and education ==
The lack of public engagement around environmental issue has led conservationists to attempt newer communication strategies. One of them is the focus on positive messages, of which Lazarus species are an important part &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/will-optimistic-stories-get-people-to-care-about-nature-76641|title=Will optimistic stories get people to care about nature?|last=Veríssimo|first=Diogo|work=The Conversation|access-date=2017-05-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One conservation outreach project that has focused exclusively on species rediscoveries is the Lost &amp; Found project which aims to tell the stories of species once thought extinct but that were subsequently rediscovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.mongabay.com/2017/04/lost-found-telling-the-stories-of-rediscovered-species/|title=‘Lost &amp; Found’: Telling the stories of rediscovered species|website=news.mongabay.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''leadership school''' is an organization, or entity within an organization, that provides education that focuses on the development of leaders. 

This activity can be undertaken at different levels. It can be in the form of training, seminars, institutes, or of more comprehensive frameworks that lead to the awarding of a certificate, degree, or diploma.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12853">The term "'''level of analysis'''" is used in the [[social science]]s to point to the location, size, or scale of a research target. "Level of analysis" is distinct from the term "[[unit of observation]]" in that the former refers to a more or less integrated set of relationships while the latter refers to the distinct unit from which data have been or will be gathered. Together, the [[unit of observation]] and the level of analysis help define the [[Sample population|population]] of a research enterprise.&lt;ref name="Blalock79"&gt;{{citation |year=1979 |author=Blalock, Hubert M |title=Social Statistics |place=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=0-07-005752-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analytical levels in social science (in ascending order) ==

Although levels of analysis are not necessarily [[Mutually exclusive events|mutually exclusive]], there are three general levels into which [[social science]] research may fall: [[Microsociology|micro-level]], [[wikt:meso-|meso-]]level or [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle-range]], and [[Macrosociology|macro]]-level.&lt;ref name="Blalock79"/&gt;

===Micro-level===
The smallest unit of analysis in the [[social sciences]] is an individual in their social setting. At the micro-level, also referred to as the local level, the research population typically is an individual in their social setting or a small group of individuals in a particular social context. Examples of micro levels of analysis include, but are not limited to, the following individual analysis type approach.
* [[Alien (law)|Alien]], [[stateless person]], [[Asylum seeker#Asylum seekers|asylum seeker]], [[refugee]]
* [[Person]]
* [[Citizen]]
* [[Civil partnership|Partnership]], [[marriage]]
* [[Families]]
* [[Household]]
* [[Neighbourhood|Neighborhood]]

===Meso-level===
In general, a meso-level analysis indicates a [[Sample population|population]] size that falls between the micro- and macro-levels, such as a [[community]] or an [[formal organization|organization]]. However, meso-level may also refer to analyses that are specifically designed to reveal connections between micro- and macro-levels. It is sometimes referred to as [[Middle range theory (sociology)|mid-range]], especially in [[sociology]]. Examples of meso-level units of analysis include, but are not limited to, the following. The
* [[Clan]]
* [[Tribe]]
* [[Community]]
* [[Village]], [[town]], [[city]]
* [[Formal organization]]
* [[State (polity)|State]]

===Macro-level===
Macro-level analyses generally trace the outcomes of interactions, such as [[economic]] or other [[resource]] [[Transfer function|transfer]] interactions over a large [[Sample population|population]]. It is also referred to as the global level. Examples of macro-level units of analysis include, but are not limited to, the following.
* [[Nation]]
* [[Society]]
* [[Civilization]]
* [[International relations|International]]
* [[Globalization|Global]]

== "Level of analysis" in cognitive science ==

=== Marr's tri-level hypothesis ===
According to [[David Marr (neuroscientist)#Levels of analysis|David Marr]], information processing systems must be understood at three distinct yet complementary levels of analysis - an analysis at one level alone is not sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Computational ====
The computational level of analysis identifies ''what'' the information processing system does (e.g.: what problems does it solve or overcome) and similarly, why does it do these things.

==== Algorithmic/representational ====
The algorithmic/representational level of analysis identifies ''how'' the information processing system performs its computations, specifically, what representations are used and what processes are employed to build and manipulate the representations.

==== Physical/implementation ====
The physical level of analysis identifies how the information processing system is ''physically realized'' (in the case of biological vision, what neural structures and neuronal activities implement the visual system).

=== Poggio's learning level ===
After thirty years of the book ''Vision (David Marr. 1982. W. H. Freeman and Company)'', [[Tomaso Poggio]] adds one higher level beyond the computational level, that is the [[machine learning|learning]].
{{Quote|text=I am not sure that Marr would agree, but I am tempted to add learning as the very top level of understanding, above the computational level. [...] Only then may we be able to build intelligent machines that could learn to see—and think—without the need to be programmed to do it.|sign=[[Tomaso Poggio]]|source=''Vision'' (David Marr. 2010. The MIT Press), Afterword, P.367}}

== "Level of analysis" in political science ==

In [[political science]], level of analysis is generally divided into three categories - [[individual]], [[State (polity)|state]], and [[international relations|international system]], however newer discussions of globalization have led to a newer level of analysis to be considered. The three (or four) levels of analysis cannot describe every effect and there is unlimited number of levels between the three primary ones, levels of analysis will help understand how one force in [[political power]] affects another. Generally, power is the concept that collects all the analysis together. For example, the struggle for power may be the cause of war, but the struggle for power may originate in the individual human being's lust for power. The lust for power is individual level of analysis, while the struggle for power is systemic level of analysis.&lt;ref name ="Nau"&gt;{{citation|author= Henry R. Nau | title= Perspectives on International Relations (2012)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual level===
The individual level of analysis locates the cause of events in individual leaders or the immediate circle of decision makers within a particular country. It focuses on human actors on the world stage identifying the characteristics of human decision making.&lt;ref name = "Nau" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John T. Rowrke. International Politics on the World Stage, 10th edition.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the cause of [[World War I]] is from the particular leaders in power at that time. [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] is considered to be the level from which the cause originated. It may have been his need for power to hide a sense of inferiority, or it may have been his inability to understand the intricacies of [[Power in international relations|statecraft]], the way [[Otto von Bismarck]] did. Or it may have been his idea about the [[monarchy]] and German destiny. All three possibilities are drawn from an individual level of analysis.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Domestic/state level===
The domestic level of analysis locates causes in the character of the domestic system of specific states. Thus, war is caused by aggressive or warlike states, not by evil, inept, or misguided people or the structure of power in the international system. The failure of domestic institutions may also cause war.&lt;ref name = "Nau" /&gt; In [[World War I]], the internal collapse of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], or the brittle coalition inside [[Germany]] of agricultural and industrial interest, such as [[rye]] and [[iron]], are often cited as important causes. Domestic level cases may come from various characteristics of the domestic system. [[Capitalist]] and [[socialist]] economies generate different attitudes and behavior. 

The [[Muslim]] and [[Christian]] religions or [[democracy|democratic]] and nondemocratic political ideologies do as well. Stable and failed institutions are domestic level factors affecting state behavior. A great worry today is the existence of failed states, meaning states whose domestic institutions have broken down, such as [[Somalia]]. Another worry here is existence of a rogue state, such as [[North Korea]], which may pass [[nuclear weapons]] on to [[terrorists]]. Any type of state come from the domestic level of analysis, but a [[failed state]] usually means an institutional breakdown at domestic level of analysis, whereas a [[rogue state]] often implies evil intentions by individual – individual level of analysis.

===Systemic level===
The systemic level of analysis explains outcomes from a system wide level that includes all states.&lt;ref name = "Nau" /&gt; It takes into account both the position of states in the international system and their interrelationships. The position of states constitutes the systemic structural level of analysis. This involves the relative distribution of power, such as which state; great, middle, or small power, and [[geopolitics]]; such as which state is sea or land power. The interaction of states constitutes the systemic process level of analysis. At this level, we are concerned with which state aligns with which other states and which state negotiates with which other states. Thus, we can explain [[World War I]] in terms of the absence of system wide institutions, such as [[League of Nations]], which was not created until after World War I to prevent such wars in the future. However, system wide institution does not always mean harmony among nations, as seen in the [[World War II]]. The cause of [[World War II]] is seen as the failure of a systemic institution, which led new institutions of the [[United Nations]] to carry on reformed legacy of the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;McGraw Hill. Introduction to International Business, 8th edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global level===
Global level factors are much like Systemic level factors, however the core difference is that global factors are not necessarily created by states, whereas systemic factors are. Global factors ''can'' be the outcome of individuals, interest groups, states, nonstate actors or even natural conditions – however they cannot be ''traced'' to the actions of any one state or even group of states. An example can be how the internet can shape how policy is formed, through social media or forums – where an idea is formed over time by a group of individuals, but the source is generally hard to determine. An environmental natural example is how global warming can help shape how society views certain policies, or help shape new policies themselves. Droughts caused by rising temperatures can cause global actors to form alliances to help procure critical resources - and as writers such as Peter Gleik and Michael Klare have shown, the possibility of "Water Wars" in dry countries in Africa and the Middle East are very possible.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford University Press. Introduction to Global Politics, Third edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mark Roland Wilson Jones''' (born 1956) is an architect and prominent architectural historian whose research covers varied aspects of classical architecture while concentrating on that of ancient Greece and Rome. He is best known for his work on the design of monumental buildings, especially the [[Pantheon, Rome]], and that of the Architectural orders in both Roman and Greek contexts. He is the author of two important books of classical architecture, and is currently a senior lecturer (associate professor) at the [[University of Bath]].

== Biography ==
Wilson Jones was educated at [[Queens' College, Cambridge]] (MA Cantab in architecture, RIBA Part 1) and the Polytechnic of Central London, now the [[University of Westminster]] (Diploma in architecture, RIBA Part 2, with distinction). The architecture department at PCL at the time benefited from inspirational young teachers including [[David Leatherbarrow]], [[Eric Parry]], [[Demetri Porphyrios]] and [[Robert Tavernor]]. Wilson Jones moved to Rome to take up tenure of the Rome Prize (the British Prix de Rome) in Architecture at the [[British School at Rome]] (1982–1984), with a project on the masterpiece of [[Baldassarre Peruzzi]], [[Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne]], and it was the process of understanding Peruzzi’s ideas about ancient design that led Wilson Jones to study ancient Roman practice in its own right. To further this research he was awarded a research contract with the Soprintendenza Archeologica di Roma (1984-5) at the instigation of the archeologist [[Lucos Cozza]].

While working as an architect for practices including Shepheard, Epstein and Hunter in London and Bruges Tozer in [[Bristol]], Wilson Jones published several articles on his discoveries about the [[Pantheon, Rome]], [[Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne]], the [[Tempietto]] and the [[Corinthian order]]. Having won research grants from the [[British Academy]] and the [[Leverhulme Trust]] he moved back to Rome in 1991, where he combined research with private practice and teaching at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]] and at American universities with programmes in Rome, along with fellowships in the United States. In 2000 he moved to the Department of Architecture and Civil Engineering, [[University of Bath]], where he has served as Director of CASA, and Director of Postgraduate Research. His research has received funding from bodies including the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council|AHRC]] and he held a research fellowship at the [[Canadian Centre for Architecture]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cca.qc.ca/fr/centre-d-etude/854-mark-wilson-jones-modernism-and-the-myth-of-origins |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053003/http://www.cca.qc.ca/fr/centre-d-etude/854-mark-wilson-jones-modernism-and-the-myth-of-origins |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson Jones is a registered architect. His professional practice and archaeological interests have sometimes intersected, as in the commission for a shelter at the site of [[Cosa]] north of Rome, and, also on the initiative of [[Elizabeth Fentress]], a masterplan for the site of [[Volubilis]] in Morocco for the [[World Monuments Fund]] (2001-2003). He  has been member of the Architecture and Planning Committee of the [[Bath Preservation Trust]] since 2001, and a Trustee since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bath-preservation-trust.org.uk/about-us/trustees/&lt;/ref&gt; He has served on the Faculty of Archaeology, History and Letters of the [[British School at Rome]] from 2006 to 2011, and in 2010 was elected corresponding member of the [[American Institute of Archaeology]].

He is married to Donatella Caramia professor of neurology at the University of Rome.

== Research ==
While the scholarly environment of much of Wilson Jones’s research is archaeological, it is characterized by an architectural approach. He is drawn to major unresolved issues, especially if much debated ever since the Renaissance, or even antiquity. His discoveries invite paradigm shifts with respect to the scholarly consensus. A case in point is his demonstration that the Romans designed the [[Corinthian order]] of columns not according to ratios based on the lower column diameter, as stipulated by [[Vitruvius]] and his Renaissance followers.  This had been argued by Claude Perrault in 1683, but he and subsequent authorities mistakenly held Roman design to be merely empirical. Wilson Jones proved, however, that while yet compatible with almost endless variation the Romans did in fact employ a system of simple arithmetical ratios (e.g. 1:1,1:2 and 6:5) to design and produce Corinthian columns. His synthetic vision of Roman design appeared as ''Principles of Roman Architecture'' (Yale University Press, 2000), the only book to have been awarded both the [[Banister Fletcher]] Prize by the RIBA together with the Authors’ Club of Great Britain and the Alice Davis Hitchcock Medallion by the [[Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bath.ac.uk/ace/people/wilson-jones/&lt;/ref&gt;

An abiding subject of study and controversy has been the [[Pantheon, Rome]], which despite being one of the most famous icons of architectural history is arguably a flawed masterpiece. The theory of a compromised design, first published in 1987 together with Paul Davies and David Hemsoll, was further developed in the final pair of chapters in Principles of Roman Architecture. Although widely embraced, the ‘compromise hypothesis’ has been contested by [[Lothar Haselberger]], a fellow authority on ancient design. Wilson Jones has published further corroboration in the volume of essays, ''The Pantheon from Antiquity to the Present'' (Cambridge University Press, 2015). Two decades of research into the nature of the orders and the Greek temple and the orders have culminated in the book ''Origins of Classical Architecture: temples, orders and gifts to the gods in ancient Greece'' (Yale University Press, 2014).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40792">'''Mediated cross-border communication''' is a scholarly field in [[communication studies]] and refers to any mediated form of communication in the course of which nation state or cultural borders are crossed or even get transgressed and undermined (e.g., [[world news]], [[satellite television]], [[transnational media events]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wessler, H., &amp; Brüggemann, M. (2012, in press). Transnationale Kommunikation. Eine Einführung. Wiesbaden: Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression serves as an umbrella term that encompasses different [[#Research approaches|research approaches]] (e.g., 
[[#International communication|international communication]], [[#Transnational communication|transnational communication]]) that can heuristically be differentiated by their specific use of research perspectives, as well as particular levels and objects of analysis (see [[#Dimensions of analysis|dimensions of analysis]]).

Thematically, research is often concerned with the political dimension of mediated cross-border communication. Examples include studies on the impact of mediated cross-border communication on foreign policy ([[CNN effect]],&lt;ref&gt;Volkmer, I. (1999). News in the global sphere: a study of CNN and its impact on global communications. Luton: University of Luton Press.&lt;/ref&gt;) political change ([[media and democratization]],&lt;ref&gt;Voltmer, K. (2008). Comparing media systems in new democracies: east meets south meets west. Central European Journal Journal of Communication, 1(1). 23-39.&lt;/ref&gt; [[zapatista effect]],&lt;ref&gt;Cleaver, H. M. (1998). The zapatista effect: the internet and the rise of an alternative political fabric. Journal of International Affairs, 51(2), 621-640.&lt;/ref&gt; [[boomerang effect (psychology)|boomerang effect]],&lt;ref&gt;Sikkink, K., Keck, M. E., &amp; Cunningham, S. (Eds.) (1998). Activists beyond borders: advocacy networks in international policy. London: Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;) research on official government communication targeting foreign audiences (e.g., certain kinds of [[International broadcasting]], [[Public diplomacy]]) and questions on media representations of the developing world (e.g., [[New World Information and Communication Order]]). Apart from that, [[global mass communication ethics]]&lt;ref&gt;Hanitzsch, T., Seethaler, J., Skewes, E. A., Anikina, M., Berganza, R., Cangöz, I., Coman, M., Hamada, B., Hanusch, F., Karadjov, C. D., Mellado, C., Moreira, S. V., Mwesige, P- G., Plaisance, P. L., Reich, Z., Vardiansyah Noor, D., &amp; Yuen, K. W. (2012). Worlds of journalism: journalistic cultures, professional autonomy and perceived influences across 18 nations. In D. H. Weaver &amp; L. Willnat (Eds.), The global journalist in the 21st century. New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, T. W. (Ed.) (1989). Communication ethics and global change. New York: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[globalization of entertainment]]&lt;ref&gt;Hafez, K. (2007). The myth of media globalization. Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; constitute further important topics.
An at least implicit common feature to almost all of the aforementioned topics is their general interest in answering the question to what extent nationally, culturally or otherwise defined media systems influence each other, converge or whether they can pertain distinct identities under conditions of mediated cross-border communication.

Mediated cross-border communication is considered as becoming increasingly important both as a real world phenomenon and field of research as there has been a steady strengthening of the conditions of [[globalization]] and media innovations that offer fast and low-cost forms of cross-border communication since the second half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;McQuail, D. (2010). McQuail's Mass Communication Theory (pp. 248-269). London: SAGE.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[#Selected Key Findings, Criticism and Advancements|critics]] argue that the importance of the nation state remains high; for example, most online communication still takes place between citizens of the same nation state. Also, the responsibility for most broadcasting and press legislation usually rests with individual national states.&lt;ref&gt;Hafez, K. (2007). The myth of media globalization. Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of research==
The history of mediated cross-border communication research is closely related to the three major decades of the 20th century, which stimulated and influenced this field of research in terms of themes, funding sources as well as ideologies: The two world wars in the first half of the 20th century, the Cold War decade, and finally the era of globalization after the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989 and the former Soviet Union in 1991. Throughout the time, technological innovations such as satellite television or the Internet and the expansion of media markets across national borders have further stimulated research interest in mediated cross-border communication.

[[File:Milestones of mediated cross-border communication research.png|Milestones of mediated cross-border communication research]]

=== 1930–1950: As psychological warfare (propaganda paradigm) ===
The propaganda operations of the great powers in the twentieth century's two world wars are often considered to have been the initiating driving forces for sustained scholarly interest into mediated cross-border research. Although cross-border communication activities have been set in place by national governments since ancient history (Melissen, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;3)&lt;ref&gt;Melissen, J. (2005): The new public diplomacy: between theory and practice. In J. Melissen (Ed.), The new public diplomacy (pp. 3-27). New York: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; it was not until the early twentieth century that such international propaganda efforts were followed by systematic academic research (McQuail, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;McQuail, D. (2010). McQuail's Mass Communication Theory (pp. 248-269). London: SAGE.&lt;/ref&gt; Literature reviews show that this trend continued far into the aftermath of World War II until development and modernization became leading research themes in the 1960s (see Smith, 1956; Mowlana, 1973).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, B. L. (1956). Trends in research on international communication and public opinion, 1945-1955. Public Opinion Quarterly, 20(1). 182-195.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mowlana, H. (1973). Trends in research on international communication in the United States. International Communication Gazette, 19. 79-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1950–1970: As development prompter (modernization paradigm) ===
In the 1950s, studies on mediated cross-border communication started to increasingly stress its assumed function as development and modernization prompter ([[development communication]]), not least due to the dozens of countries in Asia, Africa, and South America who gained their political independence at that time. US government interests to "modernize" these countries paralleled with sustained research efforts regarding the role of (mediated cross-border) mass media in this context (for a critical perspective on the role of US policies in the field see Hardt, 1988).&lt;ref&gt;Hardt, H. (1988). Comparative media research: the world according to America. Critical Studies in Mass Communication, 5. 129-146.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the latter was predominantly conceptualized as one-way flow of communication from government development agencies to people in Third World nations. Typically, strong media effects were assumed that would change attitudes and behavior of individuals, thus supporting the modernization of countries (Lerner, 1958).&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, D. (1958) The Passing of Traditional Society. New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Important proponents of the modernism paradigm later admitted its limitations and shortcomings, especially with regard to the application of the Western model of development to Third World countries (Schramm, 1979; Rogers, 1976).&lt;ref&gt;Schramm, W. I. (1979). Mass media and national development 1979 (international commission for the study of communication problems, no. 42). Paris: UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, E. M. (1976). Communication and development: the passing of the dominant paradigm. Communication Research, 3(2). 213-240.&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction of development and modernization to economic growth (poverty as equivalent to underdevelopment), overestimation of strong media effects and the ethnocentric promotion of adopting a Western model of society are today commonly viewed as the central reasons why modernization theory was subverted by early 1970.

The 1950s also showed early studies of international news flows, with assumingly the first one conducted by the International Press Institute in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;International Press Institute (1953). The flow of news. Zürich.&lt;/ref&gt; which was followed by more systematic analyses in the early 1960s by Wilbur Schramm (1960),&lt;ref&gt;Schramm, W. (1960). One day in the world's press. Stanford: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; thus initiating research concerned with the "balance" of news exchanges between developed and developing nations (Hur, 1984, p.&amp;nbsp;365). Furthermore, the then newly established [[UNESCO]] started to function as an important funding source and research agenda setter, sponsoring field-related studies on foreign news coverage and international news flows (for early examples see Kaiser, 1953; Williams, 1953).&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser, J. (1953). One week's news: comparative study of 17 major dailies for a seven-day period. Paris: UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, F. (1953). La transmission des informations: les télécommunications et la presse. Paris: UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another landmark study in this phase of research was the “Four theories of the press” put forward by Siebert, Peterson and Schramm (1956),&lt;ref&gt;Siebert, F., Peterson, T., &amp; Schramm, W. (1956). Four theories of the press. Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which offered a framework for comparative media system research. With regard to varying degrees of state interventionism, the authors described four ideal types of how media were ought to be organized (authoritarian, libertarian, Soviet communism, and social responsibility). Despite the fact that the book received widespread scholarly attention, it is today commonly criticized for its ideological bias, lack of empirical concern and universal approach (Nerone, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;Nerone, J. (2004). Four theories of the press in hindsight: reflections of a popular model. In M. Semati (Ed.), New frontiers in international communication theory (pp. 21-32). Oxford: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publisherhs.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1970–1990: As media imperialism (dependency paradigm) ===
Between the 1970s and early 1980s, research was characterized by an unprecedented amount of critical assessments of news and entertainment flows between developed and [[Developing country|developing nations]], framed by [[dependency theory|dependency theories]] and notions of [[media imperialism]] (see also [[cultural imperialism]]; for conceptual differences see Lee, 1988).&lt;ref&gt;Lee, P. S-N. (1988) Communication imperialism and dependency: a conceptual clarification. ''International Communication Gazette'', 41. 69–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the latter criticized the dominance of Western mass media in the evolving global media market as being a threat to the cultural identity of developing nations (e.g., [[Herbert Schiller|Schiller]], 1976; Tunstall, 1977).&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, H. I.(1976) Communication and cultural domination. White Plains, NY: M. E. Sharpe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tunstall, J. (1977). The media are American. London: Constable.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, empirical studies on international information flows found an "unbalanced one-way traffic" (Nordenstreng &amp; Varis, 1974)&lt;ref&gt;Nordenstreng, K., &amp; Varis, T. (1974). Television traffic - a one-way street? A survey and analysis of international flow of television programme material (Reports and Papers on Mass Communication No. 70). Paris: UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; from big exporting countries to the rest of the world.

Again, [[UNESCO]] played an important role in this context that is shown by guest contributions from top representatives to major scholarly journals (e.g., Masmoudi, 1979),&lt;ref&gt;Masmoudi, M. (1979). The new world information order. Journal of Communication, 29(2). 172–185.&lt;/ref&gt; its function as funding source for international comparative research projects (e.g., Nordenstreng &amp; Varis, 1974),&lt;ref&gt;Nordenstreng, K., &amp; Varis, T. (1974). Television traffic - a one-way street? A survey and analysis of international flow of television programme material (Reports and Papers on Mass Communication No. 70). Paris: UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; and especially through the publication of the so-called [[MacBride report]], which synthesized the controversial debate on imbalances and inequalities in international flows of communication (UNESCO, 1980, pp.&amp;nbsp;145–149; pp.&amp;nbsp;106–111)&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (1980). Many voices one world: towards a new more just and more efficient world information and communication order (pp. 145-149; 106-111). Paris: UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; that by then was coined by the term "[[New World Information and Communication Order|New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO)]]". The report was echoed by extensive academic attention ranging from hailing the report's call for a democratization of mediated cross-border communication to criticizing it for its alleged technological determinism (see Hamelink, 1980)&lt;ref&gt;Hamelink, C. (Ed.) (1980). Communication in the eighties: a reader on the “MacBride Report”. Rome: IDOC International.&lt;/ref&gt; and led to a dramatic growth of empirical studies in this field in the beginning 1980s (Mowlana, 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;10).&lt;ref&gt;Mowlana, H. (1985). International flows of news: an annotated bibliography. Paris: UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most inquiries remained rather descriptive with additional normative considerations, whereas explanatory approaches were largely missing (Chang, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;529).&lt;ref&gt;Chang, T.-K. (1998). All countries not created equal to be news: world system and international communication. Communication Research, 25. 528-563.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Hur (1984, p.&amp;nbsp;375)&lt;ref&gt;Hur, K. K. (1984). A critical analysis of international news flow research. Critical Studies in Mass Communication, 1. 365–378.&lt;/ref&gt; reported after a review of 80 studies from 1970 to 1982, that key questions such as whether international news flow or coverage is influenced by news events themselves or relationships between nations, or by the media involved remained largely unexplained.

After the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989 and the former Soviet Union in 1991, dependency theory and the media imperialism thesis became largely abandoned from research agenda, to be replaced by concepts of media globalisation and perspectives of transnational communication. While some say this happened in tune with the neo-liberal climate of the time (e.g., Curran, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;171),&lt;ref&gt;Curran, J. (2002). Media and power. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; the passing of the then prevailing paradigm is also to be attributed to its inability to explain forms of hybrid media systems as it rather focused on the ''quantitative supply'' as opposed to the particular ''use'' of media contents (for details see section on [[#Media imperialism: the evolution of an influence perspective|Media imperialism: the evolution of an influence perspective]]). Thus, scholars argued that the plain notion of Western domination failed to account for the complex and multidirectional nature of mediated cross-border communication (e.g., Sreberny-Mohammadi, 1996).&lt;ref&gt;Shreberny-Mohammadi A., The global and the local in international communications. In J. Curran and M. Gurevitch, Mass Media and Society (pp. 118-138). London: Arnold.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, the paradigm's inherent [[#Research perspectives|influence perspective]] and other central questions of the debate keep re-emerging under different headings and more advanced concepts such as [[Transformation processes (media systems)#Hybridization of media systems|hybridization]] and [[glocalisation]].

=== 1990–today: As transnationalization and hybridization of national public spheres (globalization paradigm) ===
From the 1990s on, another shift of paradigm took place with the emergence of [[globalization]] as the new key term of the field. Whereas previous decades of research for most of the part followed an influence perspective, the 1990s and especially from 2000 on saw a rise of transnational approaches that applied transgression perspective on mediated cross-border communication. According to Hafez,&lt;ref&gt;2002, p.&amp;nbsp;28&lt;/ref&gt; two different types of globalization theorems can be differentiated, which are coined by the terms of conversion and domestication. The idea of conversion is represented in works such as McLuhan's “global village”-approach, that expects the emergence of a global consciousness. The second type is coined by the term of glocalisation.

A third major stimulus to the field of study was set into place in 2004 with the publication of “Comparing media systems” (see [[Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics]].&lt;ref&gt;Hallin, D. C., &amp; Mancini, P. (2004). ''Comparing media systems: Three models of media and politics''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the “Four theories of the press”, an emphasis was put on the synthesis of empirical findings. Furthermore, the authors tried to avoid the universal approach put forward by Siebert et al., focusing themselves on North America and Western Europe countries. The work has been stimulating a great number of subsequent studies that try to adopt and modify the models and analytical dimensions (e.g., [[Political parallelism]]) of “Comparing media systems” to other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hallin, D. C., &amp; Mancini, P. (Eds.) (2012). Comparing media systems beyond the western world. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dimensions of analysis ==
[[#Research approaches|Research approaches to mediated cross-border communication]] can be categorized with regard to the respective dimensions of analysis. Wessler and Brüggemann (2012)&lt;ref&gt;Wessler, H., &amp; Brüggemann, M. (2012, in press). Transnationale Kommunikation. Eine Einführung. Wiesbaden: Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften.&lt;/ref&gt; propose three dimensions of analysis: (1) research perspectives, (2) levels of analysis and (3) objects of analysis. Most entities discussed below are considered to be convergent by nature, thus being open for combination and parallel use.

=== Research perspectives ===
Three different research perspectives are commonly applied to the field of mediated cross-border communication
# the “comparative perspective”
# the “influence perspective”
# the “transgression perspective”

As a “meta-method”, the comparative perspective is common to the vast majority of studies in this academic field and can be combined with all subsequent methods, perspectives, levels and objects of analysis. 

(1) The “comparative perspective” ([[Comparative research]]) seeks for similarities and differences as well as processes of convergence and divergence (see [[Transformation processes (media systems)|transformation processes of media systems]]) between different entities such as national media systems or organizations. 

With regard to research goals, two basic comparative research designs can be differentiated (Przeworski &amp; Teune, 1970;&lt;ref&gt;Przeworski, A., &amp; Teune, H. (1970). The logic of comparative social inquiry&lt;/ref&gt; Meckstroth, 1975&lt;ref&gt;Meckstroth, T. W. (1975) “Most different systems” and “most similar systems”: a study in the logic of comparative inquiry. Comparative Political Studies, 8(2). 132-157&lt;/ref&gt;). The “Most different systems, similar outcome design” aims to compare heterogeneous media systems to identify ''general statements which are (relatively) invariant concerning the systems within which observations are made'' (e.g., in a survey of journalists from seventeen explicitly different countries, Hanitzsch et al. (2010)&lt;ref&gt;Hanitzsch, T., Anikina, M., Berganza, R., Cangoz, I., Coman, M., Harmada, B., Hanusch, F., Karadjov, Ch. D., Mellado, C., Moreira, S. V., Mwesige, P. G., Plaisance, P. L., Reich, Z., Seethaler, J., Skewes, E. A., Noor, D. V., Yuen, K. W. (2010). Modeling perceived influences on journalism: evidence from a cross-national survey of journalists. Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly, 87(1). 5-22.&lt;/ref&gt; extracted relatively invariant cross-national structures of perceived influences on journalism). By contrast, the “Most similar system, different outcome design” stresses the ''individual causes of observed differences'' between a given number of media systems. The rationale behind this second approach is that causes of intercultural or international differences are thought to be easier to interpret when the cases under study share many similarities (e.g., Hallin and Mancini (2012, p.&amp;nbsp;288)&lt;ref&gt;Hallin, D. C., &amp; Mancini, P. (Eds.) (2012). Comparing media systems beyond the western world. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; said that one of the main reasons for focusing on ''Western'' media systems in their seminal work from 2004 was to reduce the number and complexity of variables).

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Type !! Cases under study !! Research objectives 
|-
| Most different systems, similar outcome || Media systems with contrasting structural features || Identification of predictor variables of relatively invariant cross-national/cultural outcomes
|-
| Most similar systems, different outcome || Media systems with similar structural features || Identification of predictor variables of individual country/culture-specific outcomes
|-
|}

(2) The “influence perspective” focuses on patterns of exchange, influence, dominance and resistance in the relationship between two or more entities. Studies that follow this perspective ask, for example, to what extent American mass media are in some respects dominant and exert influence to other media systems worldwide ([[Americanization of the Media]], [[New World Information and Communication Order]]).&lt;ref&gt;De Grazia, V. (2005). Irresistible empire: America's advance through 20th century Europe. Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[development communication]], [[international communication]])

(3) The “transgression perspective” is looking for mediated cross-border communication that leads to structures and processes beyond traditional nation state or cultural borders e.g., [[European public sphere]]), whereas the aforementioned [[#Influence perspective|influence perspective]] is stronger connected to the idea of fixed entities.&lt;ref&gt;Wessler, H., &amp; Brüggemann, M. (2012, in press). Transnationale Kommunikation. Eine Einführung. Wiesbaden: Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Levels of analysis ===
(1) “Individual/group”, (2) “organization”, (3) “state/society”, (4) “linguistic/political/cultural areas“ and (5) “the world/global level” constitute the five levels of analysis. It is important to note that these levels are (a) not hierarchal (e.g., mediated cross-border communication between groups in social media constituted by individuals from different places worldwide) and that (b) unit of analysis and record unit are not necessarily one and the same (e.g., foreign coverage of multiple newspapers as recording unit, which then get aggregated, compared and analyzed on a nation/society level).

=== Objects of analysis ===
A broad range of objects of analysis is subject to mediated cross-border communication research: (1) “media publics”, (2) “media contents”, (3) “media products”, (4) “media structures” and (5) “societal actors”. For example, in their study from 2004, Hallin and Mancini ask for the relationship between media and politics, hereby analyzing (among others) the development of national mass circulation press, literacy rates and the autonomy of journalists from societal actors (such as political parties and the government) from a comparative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Hallin, D. C., &amp; Mancini, P.(2004). Comparing media systems: Three models of media and politics. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research approaches ==

=== International communication ===
[[International communication]] research is concerned with communication that crosses nation state borders without actually contesting them. The field of international communication is characterized by an influence perspective, comparing for example news flows between national media systems in order to analyze, for example, structures of dominance and resistance. (see also: [[Media imperialism]]).

While this perspective has been central to the field of international communication throughout the 1960s and 1970s, there has been increasing criticism since the 1980s, with scholars arguing that it would lack to be able to explain the complexity of mediated cross-border communication and its effects&lt;ref&gt;Kraidy, M. (2005). Hybridity or the cultural logic of globalization. Delhi: Dorling Kindersley.&lt;/ref&gt; (see also: [[#Methodological refinements and the relativization of the media imperialism thesis|Methodological refinements and the relativization of the media imperialism thesis]]).

=== Transnational communication ===
Being a more recent and emerging research approach, [[transnational communication]] is concerned with communication that transcends nation state borders, thus undermining their importance and eventually leading to structures and processes of transgression. Examples include:
* TV channels such as [[CNN]], whose program is no longer directed toward particular national or cultural but  ''global'' audiences.
* Media events such as the U.N. climate summits which contribute toward a globally defined identity (Eide, Kunelius, &amp; Kumpu (2010).&lt;ref&gt;Eide, E., Kunelius, R., &amp; Kumpu, V. (Eds.) (2010). Global climate – local journalisms: a transnational study of how media make sense of climate summits. Bochum: Projektverlag.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Transnational civil society such as [[Amnesty International]] who contribute to the definition, awareness and spread of global issues such as human rights.
Especially the Europeanization of national public spheres has attracted major scholarly interest covered by this research approach (e.g., Wessler, Peters, Brüggemann, Kleinen-von-Königslöw, &amp; Sifft (2008),&lt;ref&gt;Wessler, H., Peters, B., Brüggemann, M., Kleinen-von Königslöw, K., &amp; Sifft, S. (2008). Transnationalization of public spheres. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.)&lt;/ref&gt; drawing light to questions like for example to what extent discourses in European countries converge, or show signs of discursive integration and collective identification.

==Selected Key Findings, Criticism and Advancements==

=== Media imperialism: the evolution of an influence perspective ===
A common frame to the debate on global media flows and export of US media contents to other countries by the early 1970s, the [[Media imperialism|media imperialism thesis]] (see also [[cultural imperialism]]) has repeatedly been criticized for basing its assumptions on an over-simplified model of communication. Claiming forms of cultural dominance by Western media as a result of their worldwide commercial distribution, the thesis implicitly applied the idea of communication as a process of cause and effects (see also [[Models of communication#Shannon and Weaver|linear model of communication]])&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, C. E., &amp; Weaver, W. (1949). The mathematical theory of communication. Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press&lt;/ref&gt; to the field of mediated cross-border communication, thus disregarding the active interpretation and local adaption of media contents by their audiences (Kraidy, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Kraidy, M. (2005). Hybridity or the cultural logic of globalization. Delhi: Dorling Kindersley.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The latter can be illustrated by the global spread of [[Hip hop|hip hop culture]]: Originated in the USA during the 1970s, it has ever since then been integrated into local contexts throughout the world with distinct local adaptions in many diverse countries (see [[:Category:Hip hop by nationality|Hip hop by nationality]]). For example, during the [[Arab Spring]], a Libyan musician fueled the rebellion with his anti-government songs, connecting typical US rap music with local lyrics and issues.

On a methodological level, the criticism mentioned above has often been accompanied by a call for a shift of focus from the sheer ''quantitative supply'' to the particular ''consumption'' and ''use'' of media contents in order to adequately analyze their impact on, for example, the potential loss or homogenization of cultural identities (e.g., Liebes &amp; Katz, 1990;&lt;ref&gt;Liebes, T., &amp; Katz, E. (1990). The export of meaning: cross-cultural readings on Dallas. New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Sepstrup, 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Sepstrup, P. (1989). Research into international television flows: a methodological contribution. European Journal of Communication 4(4), 393-407.&lt;/ref&gt;) For instance, in a seminal study by Liebes and Katz (1990)&lt;ref&gt;Liebes, T., &amp; Katz, E. (1990). The export of meaning: cross-cultural readings on Dallas. New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; the authors found that globally exported US entertainment products such as the [[Dallas (1978 TV series)|TV series Dallas]] encounter local contexts of interpretations formed by the particular cultural backgrounds of their recipients, thus showing that identical media contents may be read and adapted in very diverse ways. However, the degree to which an audience actively interprets media contents is also subject to variance, as subsequent research has shown.&lt;ref&gt;Biltereyst, D. (1991). Resisting American hegemony: a comparative analysis of the reception of domestic and US fiction. European Journal of Communication 6, 469-497.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nevertheless, [[Denis McQuail|McQuail]]&lt;ref&gt;McQuail, D. (2010). ''McQuail's Mass Communication Theory'' (pp. 248-269). London: SAGE.&lt;/ref&gt; reports that the [[Media imperialism|media imperialism thesis]] has been widely abandoned from the study of mediated cross-border communication. Today, the more advanced concepts of [[Transformation processes (media systems)#Hybridization of media systems|hybridization]] and [[glocalisation]]&lt;ref&gt;Kraidy, M. (2005). Hybridity or the cultural logic of globalization. Delhi: Dorling Kindersley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, R. (1994). Globalisation or glocalisation? Journal of International Communication, 1(1). 33-52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martín-Barbero, J. (1993). Communication, culture and hegemony: From the media to mediations (trans. E. Fox). London: Sage. (Original work published 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; have gained increased attention by scholars as a way of conceptualizing the transformation, convergence and divergence of media systems.

=== Over-estimation of media globalization ===
Hafez (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Hafez, K. (2007). The myth of media globalization. Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the qualitative dimension of mediated cross-border communication may be much different compared to what some scholars assume it would be. Speaking of the "myth of media globalization", Hafez warns not to confound technical potentials of media innovations with their actual use. For example, Hafez refers to statistics saying that while many people have access to foreign TV channels, the majority mainly uses national or local channels.&lt;ref&gt;Hafez, K. (2007). The myth of media globalization (p. 24). Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to that, most people use the Internet as a ‘local medium’, as the bulk of accessed websites and communication stays within national borders. The increasingly multilinguistic character of the Internet may even further the fragmentation of the World Wide Web into separate public spheres (Hafez, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;90)&lt;ref&gt;Hafez, K. (2002). International vergleichende Medienforschung: Eine unterentwickelte Forschungsdimension. In K. Hafez (Ed.), Die Zukunft der internationalen Kommunikationwissenschaft in Deutschland (pp. 59-94). Hamburg: Deutsches Übersee-Institut.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such notions concerned with the ''use'' of media correspond to insights on the level of media ''contents'' gained by an international comparative study of online-news websites conducted by Quandt (2008),&lt;ref&gt;Quandt, T. (2008). (No) news on the world wide web? Journalism Studies, 9(5). 717-738.&lt;/ref&gt; who found that in most cases coverage is much limited by the traditional, national context, concluding that online-news may not be as "global" as one might expect. In accordance with these findings, Halavais (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Halavais, A. (2000). National border on the world wide web. New Media and Society 2(7), 7-28.&lt;/ref&gt; reported after surveying 4000 websites that although geographic borders may be removed from cyberspace, the 'real world' social structures keep inscribed online: the number of hyperlinks that cross international borders are significantly less compared to those which stay within national borders.

=== The making of a transnational public sphere: the case of Europe ===
For a long time, the academic debate on the existence of a transnational European public sphere was characterized by rather pessimistic viewpoints (e.g., Habermas, 1998).&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, J. (1998). Die postnationale Konstellation. Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of skepticism was fueled by assumption regarding (e.g.):
* the fragmented nature of national public spheres
* language barriers
* disinterest of audiences in European issues
* lack of transnational European media outlets.
However, empirical findings on mediated cross-border communication between national public spheres in Europe have contributed to an empirical informed re-assessment of the aforementioned pessimistic picture. While there is indeed only little empirical evidence on an emerging European public sphere in the sense of one that would replace the existing national public spheres, research has stressed the phenomenon of a ''transnationalization of national public  spheres'' (Wessler, Peters, Brüggemann, Kleinen-von-Königslöw, &amp; Sifft, 2008),&lt;ref&gt;Wessler, H., Peters, B., Brüggemann, M., Kleinen-von Königslöw, K., &amp; Sifft, S. (2008). Transnationalization of public spheres. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the latter remaining in place while at the same time contributing to transnational European debates. According to Brüggemann, Sifft, Kleinen-von-Königslöw, Peters, and Wimmel (2006, p.&amp;nbsp;304),&lt;ref&gt;Brüggemann, M., Sifft, S., Kleinen-von-Königslöw, K., Peters, B. &amp; Wimmel, A. (2006). Segmentierte Europäisierung. Trends und Muster der Transnationalisierung von Öffentlichkeit in Europa. In H. Weßler (Ed.), Bernhard Peters. Der Sinn von Öffentlichkeit (p. 304). Frankfurt am Main: suhrkamp taschenbuch wissenschaft.&lt;/ref&gt; this specific kind of transnationalization can empirically be measured in media coverage by the following dimensions:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Dimension !! Description !! Indicators
|-
| Vertical Dimension: Governance Surveillance || Public discourse on EU-institutions, EU-actors und EU-policies || Mentioning of EU-institutions; EU-policy as main topic of an article
|-
| Vertical Dimension: Collective Identity || Mediated establishment of a European community sense or feeling || Use of the expression "we Europeans"
|-
| Horizontal Dimension: Discourse Convergence  || Media attention on other European countries || References to European countries
|-
| Horizontal Dimension: Discursive Integration || Mediated exchange of arguments and positions between European countries || Direct or indirect quotes of foreign actors; 
|-
|}

A number of case- and longitudinal studies (e.g., Wessler, Peters, Brüggemann, Kleinen-von-Königslöw, &amp; Sifft (2008);&lt;ref&gt;Wessler, H., Peters, B., Brüggemann, M., Kleinen-von Königslöw, K., &amp; Sifft, S. (2008). Transnationalization of public spheres. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; for a similar approach: Koopmans &amp; Meyer, 2010&lt;ref&gt;Koopmans, J. E., &amp; Meyer, M.F. (2010). The Europeanisation of public spheres: Comparisons across issues, time, and countries. In R. Koopmans &amp; P. Statham (Ed.), The making of a European public sphere. Media discourse and political contention (pp. 63-96). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;), could show an intensifying observation of EU institutions and issues by national media, high but constant numbers of references to other European countries since the early 1980s, with powerful countries ranking on top. Although on a much lower level, this also holds true for the dimension of discursive integration, whereas only little evidence could be found for the emergence of a collective identity. Furthermore, a shared history of interdependency as well as population size respectively the corresponding political power showed to be valid predictors of the number of references to a given country (Wessler, Skorek, Kleinen-von-Königslöw, Held, Dobreva, &amp; Adolphsen, 2008&lt;ref&gt;Wessler, H., Skorek, M., Kleinen-von-Königslöw, K., Held, M., Dobreva, M., Adolphsen, M. (2008). Comparing media systems and media content: online newspapers in ten eastern and western European countries. Journal of Global Mass Communication, 1(3/4), 165-189)&lt;/ref&gt;). In sum, the studies mentioned above form the picture of a "nationally segmented Europeanization": Brüggemann, Hepp, Kleinen-von-Königslöw and Wessler (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Brüggemann, M., Hepp, A., Kleinen-von Königslöw, K., &amp; Wessler, H. (2009). Transnationale Öffentlichkeit in Europa – Forschungsstand und Perspektiven. Publizistik, 54. 391-414.&lt;/ref&gt; use this term to describe the fact that while Europe as an issue of media coverage gains increasing public attention on the vertical dimension, undeniable deficits on the horizontal dimension and thus a strong dependence on national political and media structures remain stable.

'''Microbiology of decomposition''' is the study of all microorganisms (mainly [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]) involved in [[decomposition]], the chemical and physical processes during which organic matter is broken down and reduced to its original elements.

Decomposition microbiology can be divided between two fields of interest:
# decomposition of [[plant]] materials;
# decomposition of [[cadavers]] and carcasses.

The decomposition of plant materials is commonly studied in order to understand the [[Carbon cycle|cycling of carbon]] within a given environment and to understand the subsequent impacts on soil quality. Plant material decomposition is also often referred to as composting. The decomposition of cadavers and carcasses has become an important field of study within forensic [[taphonomy]].

==Decomposition microbiology of plant materials==

{{See also|compost}}
 
The breakdown of vegetation is highly dependent on oxygen and moisture levels. During decomposition, microorganisms require oxygen for their respiration. If anaerobic conditions dominate the decomposition environment, microbial activity will be slow and thus decomposition will be slow.  Appropriate moisture levels are required for microorganisms to proliferate and to actively decompose organic matter. In arid environments, bacteria and fungi dry out and are unable to take part in decomposition. In wet environments, anaerobic conditions will develop and decomposition can also be considerably slowed down. Decomposing microorganisms also require the appropriate plant substrates in order to achieve good levels of decomposition. This usually translates to having appropriate carbon to nitrogen ratios (C:N). The ideal composting carbon-to-nitrogen ratio is thought to be approximately 30:1. As in any microbial process, the decomposition of plant litter by microorganisms will also be dependent on temperature. For example, leaves on the ground will not undergo decomposition during the winter months where snow cover occurs as temperatures are too low to sustain microbial activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McKinley |first1=V.L. |last2=Vestal |first2=J.R. |last3=Eralp |first3=A.E. |year=1985 |title=Microbial activity in composting |journal=BioCycle |publisher= |volume=26 |issue=10 |pages=47–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decomposition microbiology of cadavers and carcasses==

The decomposition processes of cadavers and carcasses are studied within the field of forensic taphonomy in order to:
*aid in the estimation of [[post-mortem interval]] (PMI) or time since death;
*aid in the location of potential clandestine graves.

Decomposition microbiology as applied to forensic taphonomy can be divided into 2 groups of studies:
* microorganisms from within the body;
* microorganisms from the decomposition environment.

===Microorganisms in the body===

When considering cadavers and carcasses, [[putrefaction]] is the proliferation of microorganisms within the body following death and also encompasses the breakdown of tissues brought upon by the growth of bacteria. The first signs of putrefaction are usually the discolorations of the body which can vary between shades of green, blue, red or black depending on 1) where the color changes are observed and 2) how far along within the decomposition process the observation is made. This phenomenon is known as marbling. Discolorations are the results of bile pigments being released following an enzymatic attack of the [[liver]], [[gallbladder]] and [[pancreas]] and the release of hemoglobin breakdown products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gill-King | first= Harrell |editor-first= William D.| editor-last=Hagldund |title= Forensic Taphonomy: The post-mortem fate of human remains |publisher=CRC Press |year=1997 |pages=93–108 |chapter=Chapter Chemical and Ultrastructural Aspects of Decomposition |isbn= 978-0-8493-9434-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proliferation of bacteria throughout the body is accompanied with the production of considerable amounts of gases due to their capacities of [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vass|first1=A.A.|last2=Barschik|first2=S.A.|last3=Sega|first3=G.|last4=Caton|first4=J.|last5=Skeen|first5=J.T.|last6=Love|first6=J.C.|year=2002|title=Decomposition chemistry of human remains: a new methodology for determining post-mortem interval|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|volume=47|issue=3|pages=542–553|url= http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=0022-1198&amp;site=1|doi= 10.1520/JFS15294J|pmid=12051334}}&lt;/ref&gt; As gases accumulate within the bodily cavities the body appears to swell as it enters the bloat stage of decomposition.

As oxygen is present within a body at the beginning of decomposition, [[aerobic organism|aerobic bacteria]] flourish during the first stages of the process. As the microbial population increases, an accumulation of gases changes the environment into anaerobic conditions which is consequently followed by a change to [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Janaway | first= Robert C |editor1-first= John| editor1-last=Hunter |editor2-first= Charlotte| editor2-last=Roberts|editor3-first=Anthony|editor3-last=Martins| title= Studies in crime: An introduction to forensic archaeology|publisher=Batsford |year=1996 |pages=58–85 |chapter=The decay of human buried remains and their associated materials |isbn= 0-415-16612-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gastro-intestinal bacteria are thought to be responsible for the majority of the putrefactive processes that occur in cadavers and carcasses. This can be in part attributed to the impressive concentrations of viable gastro-intestinal organisms and the metabolic capacities they possess allowing them to use an array of different nutrient sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson|first=Michael|title= Microbial inhabitants of humans: their ecology and role in health and disease|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2005|isbn= 0-521-84158-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gastro-intestinal bacteria are also capable of migrating from the gut to any other region of the body by using the [[lymphatic system]] and [[blood vessel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Janaway | first= Robert C |editor1-first= John| editor1-last=Hunter |editor2-first= Charlotte| editor2-last=Roberts|editor3-first=Anthony|editor3-last=Martins| title= Studies in crime: An introduction to forensic archaeology|publisher=Batsford |year=1996 |pages=58–85 |chapter=The decay of human buried remains and their associated materials |isbn= 0-415-16612-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, we know that coliform varieties of ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' are important members of the aerobic putrefactive bacteria and that members of the genus ''[[Clostridium]]'' make up a large part of anaerobic putrefactive bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Janaway | first= Robert C |editor1-first= John| editor1-last=Hunter |editor2-first= Charlotte| editor2-last=Roberts|editor3-first=Anthony|editor3-last=Martins| title= Studies in crime: An introduction to forensic archaeology|publisher=Batsford |year=1996 |pages=58–85 |chapter=The decay of human buried remains and their associated materials |isbn= 0-415-16612-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Microo scheme.jpg|thumb|center|frame| Proposed evolution of microorganisms within the body during decomposition. As oxygen is available at the beginning of decomposition, aerobic microorganisms flourish and quickly deplete the oxygen. Anaerobic bacteria can then proliferate in the body. Later in the decomposition process, fungi and bacteria from the environment will also become involved in the process.]]

===Microorganisms outside the body===

Cadavers and carcasses are usually left to decompose in contact with soil whether through burial in a grave or if left to decompose on the soil surface. This allows microorganisms in the soil and air to come in contact with the body and to take part in the decomposition process. Soil microorganism communities also undergo changes as a result of decomposition fluids leaching in the environment. Cadavers and carcasses often show signs of fungal growth suggesting that fungi use the body as a source of nutrients.

The exact impacts that decomposition may have on surrounding soil microbial communities remains unclear as some studies have shown increases in microbial biomass following decomposition whereas other have seen decreases. It is likely that the survival of microorganisms throughout the decomposition process is highly dependent of a multitude of environmental factors including pH, temperature and moisture.      [[File:Example of a pig carcass in the dry decay stage of decomposition.jpg|thumb|Frame|Right|Skeletonized pig carcass showing the production of a cadaver decomposition island surrounding the remains as a result of leaching of decomposition fluids into the surrounding environment.]]

====Decomposition fluids and soil microbiology====

Decomposition fluids entering the soil represent an important influx of organic matter and can also contain a large microbial load of organisms from the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Putman|first1=R.J.|year=1978|title= Flow of energy and organic matter from a carcase during decomposition: Decomposition of small mammal carrion in temperate systems 2|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|volume=31|issue=1|pages=58–68|jstor=3543384|doi=10.2307/3543384|journal=Oikos}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area where the majority of the decomposition fluid leaches into the soil is often referred to as a cadaver decomposition island (CDI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carter|first1= D.O.|last2=Yellowlees|first2=D.|last3=Tibbett|first3=M.|year=2006|title= Cadaver decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems| journal= Naturwissenschaften |publisher= Springer|volume=94|pages= 12–24|url= http://www.springerlink.com/content/r8021xqt7667w264/|doi= 10.1007/s00114-006-0159-1|pmid=17091303}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed that decomposition can have a favorable influence on the growth of plants due to increased fertility, a useful tool when trying to locate clandestine graves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Hunter |first1= John |last2= Cox |first2=Margaret |title= Forensic archaeology: advances in theory and practice |publisher= [[Routledge]] |year=2005 |isbn=0-415-27312-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The changes in the concentration of nutrients can have lasting effects that are still seen years after a body or carcass has completely disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Towne |first1= E.G. |year=2000 |title= Prairie vegetation and soil nutrient response to ungulate carcasses |publisher= Springer |volume=122 |issue=2 |pages= 232–239 |doi= 10.1007/PL00008851 |jstor=4222536 |journal=Oecologia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence that the surge in nutrients can have on the microorganisms and vegetation of a given site is not well understood but it appears that decomposition initially has an inhibitory effect for an initial stage before entering a second stage of increased growth.

====Decomposition fungi====

{{See also|detritivore|decomposer|decomposition}}

[[File:Fungihoof.JPG|right|frame| Fungal mycelia (white) on hoof of a deceased pig|412x412px]] It is well known that fungi are heterotrophic for carbon compounds and almost all other nutrients they require. They must obtain these through saprophytic or parasitic associations with their hosts which implicates them in many decomposition processes.

Two major groups of fungi have been identified as being linked to cadaver decomposition: 
* [[ammonia fungi]]
* post-putrefactive fungi

Ammonia fungi are broken-down into two groups referred to as "early stage fungi" and "late stage fungi." Such a classification is possible due to the successions that are observed between the types of fungi that fruit in or around a burial environment. The progression between the two groups occurs following the release of nitrogenous products from a body in decomposition.  Early stage fungi are described as being [[ascomycota|ascomycetes]], [[fungi imperfecti|deuteromycetes]] and saprophytic [[basidiomycota|basidiomycetes]] whereas late stage fungi consisted of ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carter |first1= David O. |last2=Tibbett |first2=Mark |year=2003 |title= Taphonomic mycota: Fungi with forensic potential |journal= Journal of Forensic Sciences |publisher=Blackwell |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=168–171 |url=http://enterprise.astm.org.uproxy.library.dc-uoit.ca/SUBSCRIPTION/DIGITAL_LIBRARY/JOURNALS/FORENSIC/PAGES/JFS2002169.htm |doi=10.1520/JFS2002169 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Decomposition fungi as PMI estimators=====

Considering the amount of forensic cases in which significant amounts of mycelia are observed is quite high, investigating cadaver associated mycota may prove valuable to the scientific community as they have much forensic potential.

Only one attempt at using fungi as a PMI marker in a forensic case has been published to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hitosugi |first1= Masahito |last2=Ishii |first2=Kiyoshi |last3=Yaguchi |first3=Takashi |last4=Chigusa |first4=Yuichi |last5=Kurosu |first5=Akira |last6=Kido |first6=Masahito |last7=Nagai |first7=Toshiaki |last8=Tokudome |first8=Shogo |title= Fungi can be a useful forensic tool |journal= Legal medicine |publisher=Elsevier |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages= 240–242 |url=http://www.legalmedicinejournal.com/article/S1344-6223%2806%2900052-6/abstract | doi = 10.1016/j.legalmed.2006.04.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study reported the presence of two types of fungi (''Penicillium'' and ''Aspergillus'') on a body found in a well in Japan and stated that they could estimate PMI as being approximately ten days based on the known growth cycles of the fungi in question.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1695">'''Mitochondrial toxicity''' is a condition in which the [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] of a body's cells become damaged or decline significantly in number; it occurs as a side effect of certain [[antiretroviral drug]]s used to treat human immunodeficiency virus, or [[HIV]].

==Causes==
While the exact causes of mitochondrial toxicity are unknown, research has shown that a certain group of anti-viral drugs used to treat HIV, specifically nucleoside analog [[reverse transcriptase inhibitor]]s (NRTIs), interfere with an enzyme needed in the production of mitochondria.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thebody.com/pinf/mitochondrial.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
The disruption of cell function that accompanies the condition can cause both mild and severe problems in people suffering from mitochondrial toxicity.  The most commonly observed symptom is muscle weakness, or [[myopathy]].  Others include [[peripheral neuropathy]] (numbness in the fingers and toes) and [[pancreatitis]] (inflammation of the pancreas), with the most severe being [[lactic acidosis]], in which a build-up of lactic acid in the tissues of the body leads to loss of energy, organ failure, and eventually death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.projinf.org/fs/mito_b.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002195329/http://www.projinf.org/fs/mito_b.html |archivedate=2006-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Mechanisms of monodominance in diverse tropical tree-dominated systems". Journal of Ecology (British Ecological Society) 99 (4): 891–898.doi:10.1111/j.1365-2745.2011.01827.x.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="low veg"&gt;-Prebble, Matthew; Kennedy, Jean; Southern, Wendy (2010).

ANU E Press. {{ISBN|9781921666803}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although monodominance is studied across different regions, most research focuses on the many prominent species in tropical forests. Connel and Lowman, originally called it single-dominance.&lt;ref name="low dive"&gt;Connel, Joseph H.; Lowman, Margaret D. (1989). "Low diversity tropical rainforests: Some possible mechanisms for their existence.". The American Naturalist 134: 88–119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dive top"/&gt; Conventional explanations of [[biodiversity]] in [[tropical forest]]s in the decades prior to Connel and Lowman's work either ignored monodominance entirely or predicted that it would not exist.&lt;ref name="causes"&gt;Torti, Sylvia D.; Coley, Phyllis D.; Kursar, Thomas A. (February 2001). "Causes and Consequences of Monodominance in Tropical Lowland Forests". The American Naturalist 157 (2): 141–153. doi:10.1086/318629.&lt;/ref&gt;

Connel and Lowman hypothesized two contrasting mechanisms by which [[Dominance (ecology)|dominance]] can be attained.&lt;ref name="low dive"/&gt; The first is by fast regrowth in unstable habitats with high disturbance rates. The second is through competitive exclusion in stable habitats that have low disturbance rates.&lt;ref name="low veg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="low dive"/&gt; Explanations of persistent monodominace include the monodominant species being more resistant than others to seasonal flooding, or that the monodominance is simply a sere.&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt; With persistent monodominance, the monodominant species successfully remains so from generation to generation.&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="low veg"/&gt;

== Examples ==
A minimum of 22 species from eight different [[Family (biology)|families]] are known to create monodominant forests.&lt;ref name="dive top"/&gt; Examples of persistent monodominance are seen in [[Africa]], [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], and [[Asia]].&lt;ref name="pretest"&gt;Torti, Sylvia D.; Coley, Phyllis D. (June 1999). "Tropical Monodominance: A Preliminary Test of the Ectomycorrhizal Hypothesis". Biotropica (The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation) 31 (2): 220–228.doi:10.1111/j.1744-7429.1999.tb00134.x.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dipterocarpaceae'' is one example of a plant family that is recognized as persistently [[Dominance (ecology)|dominant]] in Asia.&lt;ref name="pretest"/&gt; The [[Ectomycorrhiza|ectomycorrhizal tree]] ''Dicymbe corymbosa'', found in central Guyana, creates wide ranges of monodominant forests containing more than 80% of the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] tree species.&lt;ref name="ecto"&gt;McGuire, Krista L.

Dominant plants in the [[Neotropics]] and Africa are usually in the [[Leguminosae]] family.&lt;ref name="pretest"/&gt; The species ''Gilbertiodendron dewevrei'', ''Cynometra alexandri'', and ''Julbernardia seretii'' are pronounced as exclusive dominants in their individual forests in equatorial Africa.&lt;ref name="humid"&gt;Hart, T.

== Causes ==
Connel and Lowman originally hypothesized [[ectomycorrhiza]]l association causing the replacement of other species as one of two mechanisms by which a species becomes persistently monodominant; the other is the simple colonization of large gaps.&lt;ref name="low dive"/&gt; However, subsequent research over the years has shown that there is not a single, simple mechanism by which monodominance occurs.&lt;ref name="terese"&gt;Hart, Terese (January 1990). "Monospecific dominance in tropical rain forests.". Trends in Ecology and Evolution (Elsevier Ltd) 5 (1): 6–11.doi:10.1016/0169-5347(90)90005-X.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anomaly"&gt;Read, Jennifer; Hallam, Patricia; Cherrier, Jean-François (1995). "The anomaly of monodominant tropical rainforests: some preliminary observations in the Nothofagus-dominated rainforests of New Caledonia". Journal of Tropical Ecology (Cambridge University Press) 11(03): 359–389. doi:10.1017/s026646740000883x&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, K. L. (2007). "Recruitment dynamics and ectomycorrhizal colonization of Dicymbe corymbosa, a monodominant tree in the Guiana Shield". Journal of Tropical Ecology 23 (3): 297–307.doi:10.1017/s0266467406003968.&lt;/ref&gt; Monodominant species have been recorded forming at various times after [[forest]] clearance, though this has not been shown to be a predictor of monodominant species persistence. Reliance upon ectomycorrhizae and poor [[soil]]s have not been demonstrated.&lt;ref name="low veg"/&gt; Instead, multiple traits of adult monodominant species hinder the ability of other species to grow, including a dense canopy, a uniform canopy, deep leaf litter, slow nutrient processing, [[Fruiting|mast fruiting]], and poor [[Dispersal (ecology)|dispersal]].

Several causal mechanisms have been proposed for the formation of monodominant forest in [[Tropics|tropical]] [[ecosystem]]s,&lt;ref name="terese"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dive top"/&gt; including features of the environment such as low [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] rates, and intrinsic characteristics of the [[Dominance (ecology)|dominant]] species: escape from [[herbivore]]s, high seedling shade-tolerance, and the formation of [[mycorrhizal network]]s between individuals of the same species.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, K. L. 2007. Common ectomycorrhizal networks may maintain monodominance in a tropical rain forest" Ecology 88(3) 567–574.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canopy ===
The dense [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] of the adult trees prevents light from getting into the [[understory]].  In the [[Ituri Rainforest|Ituri]] Forest of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] a monodominant ''[[Gilbertiodendron]]'' forest understory only receives 0.57% full sunlight while a mixed-forest understory received 1.15% full sunlight. This difference may prohibit many plant species from living in that environment due to the low light conditions and their resulting inability to sufficiently and effectively [[Photosynthesis|photosynthesize]]. Even some species that are more shade tolerant cannot survive the severe low light conditions.&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt;

=== Leaf-litter ===
[[File:Leaf litter.jpg|thumb|Leaf litter]]
A monodominant forest has generally very deep [[leaf litter]] because the leaves are not [[Decomposition|decomposing]] as quickly as in other [[forest]]s. In some monodominant forests the decomposition rates can be two to three times slower than [[mixed forest]]s.&lt;ref name="dive top"/&gt; Low [[ammonium]] and [[nitrate]] could be the result of this slow decomposition which in turn, means less nutrients in the soil for other plant species to use.&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt;

=== Nutrient processing ===
[[Nutrient cycle|Nutrient processing]] is somewhat different from one [[forest]] to another. In the ''[[Gilbertiodendron]]'' forests there is low availability of [[nitrogen]] due to the low levels in the leaves that fall to the ground and the slow [[decomposition]]. This could prevent other plant species from [[Colonisation (biology)|colonizing]] because the soil lacks necessary nutrients.&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt; In ''[[Parashorea chinensis]]'' forests, trees are known to require more [[Soil fertility|fertile soils]] than in other areas. There is a large amount of [[manganese]] though that prevents other plants from taking root. Manganese can poison other trees if the levels are too high and possibly cause leaf [[chlorosis]] and [[necrosis]] and prevent the nutrient uptake of [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]].&lt;ref&gt;Van der Velden, N., Ferry Slik, J. W., Hu, Y. H., Lan, G., Lin, L., Deng, X., &amp; Poorter, L. (2014). "Monodominance of ''Parashorea chinensis'' on fertile soils in a Chinese tropical rain forest". ''Journal of Tropical Ecology'', 30(04), 311-322.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mast fruiting ===
Mast [[fruiting]] is a mass fruiting event that overwhelms the animals that consume fruit and helps the seeds' [[survival rate]]. Well-defended leaves also assist in the prevention of [[predation]]. In the ''[[Gilbertiodendron]]'' forests this mast fruiting does not assist in lesser predation, but in [[Asia]] and the [[Neotropics]] this does induce fitness benefits &lt;ref name="VisserJongejans2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Visser|first1=Marco D.|last2=Jongejans|first2=Eelke|last3=van Breugel|first3=Michiel|last4=Zuidema|first4=Pieter A.|last5=Chen|first5=Yu-Yun|last6=Rahman Kassim|first6=Abdul|last7=de Kroon|first7=Hans|title=Strict mast fruiting for a tropical dipterocarp tree: a demographic cost-benefit analysis of delayed reproduction and seed predation|journal=Journal of Ecology|volume=99|issue=4|year=2011|pages=1033–1044|issn=00220477|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2745.2011.01825.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes is actually important to monodominant maintenance.&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt;

=== Poor dispersal ===
A monodominant [[forest]] has poor [[Dispersal (ecology)|dispersal]] because of the lack of animal dispersers, so many of the [[seed]]s are just dropped from the parent tree and fall to the ground where they [[Germination|germinate]]. This can create a regular and [[wikt:radial|radial]] path around the parent tree that results in a "tree-by-tree replacement" in a [[mixed forest]].&lt;ref name="dive top"/&gt; In a monodominant forest the [[Dominance (ecology)|dominant]] species do not need all of the described traits to overwhelm the area. Though many have a combination, all monodominant forests have at least one of these traits to create the monodominant habitat.&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt;

=== Ectomycorrhizal association ===
Many of the [[Tropics|tropical]] monodominant trees are associated with [[Ectomycorrhizal fungus|ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi]] networks. [[Mycorrhizal fungi]] are known to effect plant [[Biodiversity|diversity]] trends in a variety of [[ecosystem]]s around the world.&lt;ref name="ecto"/&gt; [[Ectomycorrhiza]]l relations with trees can increase [[Nutrient|nutrient supplies]] through a more effectual use of larger capacities of [[soil]]s or through the direct [[decomposition]] of [[leaf litter]]. This has been suggested to provide a competitive advantage to such tree species.&lt;ref name="dive top"/&gt;

Examples of ectomycorrhizal trees in [[tropical rainforest]]s can be found in Asia, Africa, and the Neotropics. There is a strong correlation between the ECM association in tropical trees and the occurrence of monodominance.&lt;ref name="ecto"/&gt;

[[Fungi]] like mycorrihizae appear not to harm the leaves and even display a symbiotic relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, A. E., and F. Lutzoni. 2007. Diversity and host range of folier fungal endophytes: Are tropical leaves biodiversity hotspots? Ecology 88: 541-549.&lt;/ref&gt; ECM fungi are derived from saprotrophs and retain some ability to decompose organic material. Because tropical soils are often nutrient-poor, ECM trees are predicted to have a competitive advantage over neighboring trees because of their ability to attain more nutrients. With time this could lead to dominance in a tropical rainforest.

==== Ectomycorrhizal mediated mechanisms ====
A study of ''Dicymbe corymbosa'' individuals show that (in terms of total [[basal area]]) the adult trees dominate resources and space. Additionally, they form [[Coppicing|coppices]], also known as [[epicormic shoot]]s, which allow their perseverance over time. Hence, if one stem of the tree dies, it is replaced by another living stem in the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]]. This creates same-species regrowth at stem level. All of this requires high levels of [[carbohydrate]]s and nutrients that are accumulated from the ECM association.
There is evidence that [[masting]] tree species rely on ECM associations to accumulate these requisite nutrients for reproduction during inter-mast years. Associations between resource levels stowed in plant tissue, timing of masting, and ECM patterns propose that [[Ectomycorrhizal fungus|ECM fungi]] are essential in the procurement of nutrients required for large masting trees.&lt;ref name="ecto"/&gt;

Seeds of monodominant trees typically have higher rates of [[germination]] and seedling survival when planted in monodominant forests rather than [[mixed forest]]s. Monodominant seedlings planted in mixed forests have significantly lower levels of ECM colonization of [[root]]s. The lower percent of ECM colonization can cause the low [[survival rate]]s of these seedlings in mixed forest.&lt;ref name="ecto"/&gt; Another mechanism that can be important for seedling and growth survival is a connection to a common [[Ectomycorrhiza|ECM]] network. By connecting their small root systems to ECM networks that emanate from larger adults, more benefits can be received.&lt;ref name="ecto"/&gt;

Slower [[decomposition]] rates in monodominant forests have been hypothesized to be a result of competition between [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprotrophic]] bacteria and [[Fungus|fungi]]. ECM fungi may be suppressing saprotrophs in the monodominant forest to slow decomposition and return organically bound nutrients back to the tree. This is also called the "Gadgil" hypothesis.&lt;ref name="ecto"/&gt;

== Ecological impacts ==
All of the traits that contribute to creating a monodominant forest over time hinder the growth of other plant species and force them to move to a more [[mixed forest]]. Even though this is inconvenient for the plant species that were there, there has not been any evidence that suggests that this is a negative effect of monodominance.&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt; Monodominant forests are also found to have significantly less [[nitrogen]] in their [[soil]] than mixed forests. In these monodominant forests there are a lot of [[Dominance (ecology)|dominant]] tree species from the [[Legume family|legume]] family that have [[nitrogen fixation]]. Nitrogen fixation creates compounds that help a plant to grow in otherwise low nutrient conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Brookshire, E. J., &amp; Thomas, S. A. (2013). Ecosystem Consequences of Tree Monodominance for Nitrogen Cycling in Lowland Tropical Forest. PLoS ONE,8(7), e70491.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12146">[[File:Stockholms-stadsbibliotek-2003-04-14.jpg|thumb|[[Stockholm Public Library]] (1920-28) by [[Gunnar Asplund]].]]
'''Nordic Classicism''' was a [[Architectural style|style of architecture]] that briefly blossomed in the [[Nordic countries]] ([[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[Finland]]) between 1910 and 1930.

Until a resurgence of interest for the period during the 1980s (marked by several scholarly studies and public exhibitions), Nordic Classicism was regarded as a mere interlude between two far more well-known architectural movements, [[National Romantic Style|National Romanticism]], or ''[[Jugendstil]]'' (often seen as equivalent or parallel to [[Art Nouveau]]), and [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]] (aka [[Modernist architecture|Modernism]]).

== History ==
[[File:Københavns Politigård under construction.jpg|thumb|[[Copenhagen Police Headquarters]] (1924) by [[Hack Kampmann]].]]
The development of Nordic Classicism was no isolated phenomenon, but took off from [[Classical architecture|classical]] traditions already existing in the Nordic countries, and from new ideas being pursued in German-speaking cultures. Nordic Classicism can thus be characterised as a combination of direct and indirect influences from [[vernacular]] architecture (Nordic, Italian and German) and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassicism]], but also the early stirrings of Modernism from the [[Deutscher Werkbund]] – especially their exhibition of 1914 - and by the mid-1920s the ''Esprit Nouveau'' emerging from the theories of [[Le Corbusier]].

The modernist influence went beyond mere aesthetics: [[urbanisation]] tied to modern building techniques and the introduction of regulations both in building and [[town planning]], and moreover, to the rise of social forces that resulted in a change in political ideology toward the Left, resulting in the [[Nordic welfare state]], and new programmes for public buildings such as hospitals (e.g. the [[Beckomberga Hospital]] in western [[Stockholm]] (1927-1935) by [[Carl Westman]]) and schools (e.g. the Fridhemsplan school, Stockholm, (1925–27) by Georg A. Nilsson). But while Nordic classicism was employed for a number of important public buildings, it was also applied as a model for low-cost housing (e.g. the [[Käpylä|Puu-Käpylä]] Garden Town, Helsinki (1920–25) by Martti Välikangas) and domestic architecture in general (e.g. an affordable sense of style for the nouveau-riche).

1930 is usually considered the end point of Nordic Classicism because that was the year of the [[Stockholm Exhibition (1930)|Stockholm Exhibition]], designed mostly by [[Gunnar Asplund]] and [[Sigurd Lewerentz]], when a more purist Modernism was unveiled as a model for a modern society. However, key buildings continued to be built in the classical style after that, notably Östberg's Maritime Museum in Stockholm (1931–34).

== Notable architects ==
[[File:Parliament building Finland.jpg|thumb|[[Eduskuntatalo|Parliament of Finland]], Helsinki (1926-1931) by [[Johan Sigfrid Sirén]]]]
[[File:Rathaus Haugesund.jpg|thumb|right|Haugesund City Hall (1922-1931) by [[Gudolf Blakstad]] and [[Herman Munthe-Kaas]]]]

Certain architects had reached the culmination of their careers already when the [[National Romantic style]] came, but their latter works were in the Nordic Classicism style (e.g. [[Carl Westman]]), the career of others culminated with Nordic Classicism (e.g. [[Ivar Tengbom]] and [[Ragnar Östberg]]), while others later went on to achieve far greater significance as Modernist architects (e.g. [[Arne Jacobsen]], [[Alvar Aalto]], and [[Sven Markelius]]). The two figures who achieved greatest significance in both periods, however, were Swedish architects [[Gunnar Asplund]] and [[Sigurd Lewerentz]].

'''[[Architecture of Denmark|Denmark]]''': [[Kay Fisker]], [[Hack Kampmann]], [[Kaj Gottlob]], [[Ivar Bentsen]], [[Povl Baumann]], [[Poul Holsøe]], [[Edvard Thomsen]], [[Thomas Havning]], [[Holger Jacobsen]], [[Kaare Klint]], [[Arne Jacobsen]], [[Carl Petersen (architect)|Carl Petersen]], [[Aage Rafn]], [[Steen Eiler Rasmussen]], [[Sven Risom]], and [[Frits Schlegel]].

'''[[Architecture of Finland|Finland]]''': [[Gunnar Taucher]], [[Uno Ullberg]], [[Martti Välikangas]], [[J.S. Sirén]], [[Alvar Aalto]], [[Pauli E. Blomstedt]], [[Elsi Borg]], [[Erik Bryggman]], [[Hilding Ekelund]], [[Heikki Siikonen]], and [[Oiva Kallio]].

'''[[Architecture of Norway|Norway]]''': [[Lars Backer]], [[Lorentz Ree]], [[Sverre Pedersen]], [[Nicolai Beer]], [[Finn Berner]], [[Harald Hals]], [[Herman Munthe-Kaas]], [[Gudolf Blakstad]], [[Finn Bryn]], [[Jens Dunker]] and [[Johan Ellefsen]].

'''[[Architecture of Sweden|Sweden]]''': [[Ragnar Östberg]], [[Gunnar Asplund]], [[Carl Westman]], [[Sigurd Lewerentz]], [[Carl Bergsten]], [[Sigfrid Ericson]], [[Torben Grut]], [[Ragnar Hjorth]], [[Cyrillus Johansson]], [[Erik Lallerstedt]], [[Gunnar Leche]], [[Sven Markelius]], [[Gunnar Morssing]], [[George Nilsson]], [[Ture Ryberg]], [[Albin Stark]], [[Eskil Sundahl]], [[Lars Israel Wahlman]], [[Sven Wallander]], [[Hakon Ahlberg]] and [[Ivar Tengbom]].

Though these architects are listed by country, during this period there was an intense cultural exchange among the Nordic countries (many architects worked in more than one), but also considerable development in the architect's sphere of activity, from consultant to the bourgeoisie to town planner concerned with infrastructure, dwelling and public services. As Swedish historian Henrik O. Anderson (1982: 23), has put it, this was an architecture of democracy, not radical [[avant-garde|avant-gardism]]. Furthermore, with the exception of Finland, the other Nordic countries had avoided getting involved in the [[World War I|First World War]], allowing for continued cultural development.

Interest in Nordic Classicism, especially in its most classical form, arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s at the height of [[postmodern architecture|postmodernism]] when critics, historians and architecture teachers were looking for historical precedents for the architecture of such architects as [[Michael Graves]], [[Leon Krier]] and [[Robert A. M. Stern|Robert Stern]]. Nordic classicism provided that precedent, especially with such seminal buildings as Gunnar Asplund's Scandia Cinema in Stockholm (1924), Listers District Courthouse (1917–21), Villa Snellman in [[Djursholm]] (1917–18) and [[Stockholm Public Library]] (1920-28), as well as the landscape and buildings of the [[Skogskyrkogården]] Cemetery, Stockholm (1917-1940) by both Asplund and Sigurd Lewerentz.

In regards to architectural style, there were several precedents or reasons which account for the rise of Nordic Classicism. First was the existing classical tradition, borne from the architecture of [[Absolute monarchy|Absolutism]] &amp;ndash; that is, the classical architectural symbols of power of the Swedish and Danish monarchies &amp;ndash; down to the vernacular, for instance in terms of considerations for symmetry, detailing and proportion.

Throughout the 19th century there were a number of factors contributing to a more simplified classicism. The teachings of [[Jean-Nicolas-Louis Durand|J.N.L. Durand]] at the [[École Polytechnique]] of Paris at the beginning of the 19th century had attempted to rationalise the language and building techniques of classicism, while allowing for simple additive compositions. Durand's teachings spread, entering German culture in the form of Romantic Classicism with the work of [[Friedrich Gilly]] and [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]. Scholars were at the time uncovering the remnants of [[Pompeii]], and discovering the use of bright colour in Roman architecture – an aspect that had more or less been forgotten in the [[Renaissance]], but also rediscovering Greece and Egypt. These aspects were incorporated into Neoclassicism and continued into Nordic Classicism (e.g. The [[Thorvaldsen Museum]], [[Copenhagen]], 1839–48, by M.G. Bindesbøll, incorporates Egyptian motifs as does Asplund's Stockholm Public Library).

There are also 'circles of reaction' to consider. Art Nouveau and National Romanticism had little impact in Denmark, while in Sweden, Norway and Finland there were also strong National Romantic reactions. Neoclassicism had arrived in Finland via [[Saint Petersburg]] as a universal language but by the end of the 19th century came to represent an alien presence – that of [[Russia]]. Thus when stirrings of political independence appeared in Finland and  Norway, a rugged, national romantic architecture – a local variation of Art Nouveau – playing on the nationalistic myths, took hold. Nordic classicism was thus a counter-reaction to that style and eclecticism in general; a movement toward [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]]ism, internationalism and simplification.

Many of the architects who practiced in the Nordic Classical style made pilgrimages to northern [[Italy]] to study Italian vernacular architecture. With close cultural links at that time between the Nordic countries and Germany, another important source came from German critics of Art Nouveau, in particular [[Hermann Muthesius]] – who had been a promoter of the English [[Arts and Crafts movement]] and founded the [[Deutscher Werkbund]] in 1907 - and Paul Schultze-Naumburg, as well as the latter’s student [[Heinrich Tessenow]], and [[Peter Behrens]].

In turn, the thinking in Nordic Classicism became one of the basis for the development of Modernism in the Nordic Countries. The idea that there would have been a continuity between vernacular and modernism has been seen as counter to received historical opinion about the rise of Modernism, beginning with [[Le Corbusier]] and his [[Le Corbusier#Five points of architecture|5 Points for Architecture]], which are seen as overturning 5 basic principles of Classicism. A demonstration in real time of the move from Nordic Classicism to a pure Functionalism is offered by Alvar Aalto's design for the [[Viipuri Library]] (1927–35), which went through a profound transformation from the original architectural competition proposal in 1927 (owing much to Gunnar Asplund) to the severely functionalist building, completed eight years later in a purist modernist style, influenced by Le Corbusier.

In [[astrophysics]], the '''Phillips relationship''' is the relationship between the peak luminosity of a [[Type Ia supernova]] and the speed of luminosity evolution after maximum light. The relationship was independently
discovered by the American statistician and astronomer Bert Woodard Rust and the Soviet astronomer Yury Pavlovich Pskovskii in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rust | first = B. W. | title = The Use of Supernovae Light Curves for Testing the Expansion Hypothesis and Other Cosmological Relations | journal = [PhD thesis, University of Illinois] | url = http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/06/179/6179223.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pskovskii | first = Yu. P. | title = Light curves, color curves, and expansion velocity of type I supernovae as functions of the rate of brightness decline | journal = [[Astronomy Reports|Soviet Astronomy]] | volume = 21 | pages = 675 | date = 1977 | bibcode = 1977SvA....21..675P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pskovskii | first = Yu. P. | title = Photometric classification and basic parameters of type I supernovae | journal = [[Astronomy Reports|Soviet Astronomy]] | volume = 28 | pages = 658–664 | date = 1984 | bibcode = 1984SvA....28..658P}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that the faster the supernova faded from maximum light, the fainter its peak magnitude was. As a main parameter characterizing the light curve shape, Pskovskii used β, the mean rate of decline in photographic brightness from maximum light to the point at which the luminosity decline rate changes. β is
measured in magnitudes per 100-day intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pskovskii | first = Yu. P. | title = The Photometric Properties of Supernovae | journal = [[Astronomy Reports|Soviet Astronomy]] | volume = 11 | pages = 63–69 | date = 1967 | bibcode = 1967SvA....11...63P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selection of this parameter is justified by the fact that, at that time, the probability of discovering a supernova before the maximum light, and obtain the full light curve, was small. Moreover, the existing light curves were mostly incomplete. On the other hand, to determine the decline after the maximum light was rather simple for most observed supernovae.

In the early 1980s CCD cameras appeared, and the number of SNe discoveries increased substantially. Moreover, the probability of discovering SNe before they reached maximum light and following their brightness evolution longer also increased. The first light curves of SNe Ia obtained using CCD photometry showed that some supernovae had faster decline rates than others. Later, the low luminosity Ia [[SN 1991bg]] with a fast decline rate was discovered.
All this motivated the American astronomer [[Mark M. Phillips]] to revise this relationship precisely during the course of the [[Calán/Tololo Supernova Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Phillips | first = M. M. | authorlink = Mark M. Phillips | title = The absolute magnitudes of Type IA supernovae | journal = [[Astrophysical Journal|Astrophysical Journal Letters]] | volume = 413 | issue = 2 | pages = L105–L108 | date = 1993 | doi = 10.1086/186970 | bibcode = 1993ApJ...413L.105P}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correlation had been difficult to prove because Pskovskii's slope (β) parameter was difficult to measure with precision in practice, a necessary condition to prove the correlation. Rather than trying to determine the slope, Phillips used a simpler and more robust procedure that consisted in "measuring the total amount in magnitudes that the light curve decays from its peak brightness during some specified period following maximum light." It was defined as the decline in the ''B''-magnitude [[light curve]] from maximum light to the [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 15 days after ''B''-maximum, a parameter he called &lt;math&gt;\Delta{m}_{15}&lt;/math&gt;. The lead sentence of the final paragraph of Phillips' paper acknowledges "I am indebted to George Jacoby for suggesting the &lt;math&gt;\Delta{m}_{15}&lt;/math&gt; parameter as an alternative to Pskovskii's β."  The relation states that the maximum '''intrinsic''' B-band magnitude is given by

&lt;math&gt; M_\mathrm{max}(B) = -21.726 + 2.698 \Delta m_{15} (B). &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Rosswog | author2 =Bruggen | title = High Energy Astrophysics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phillips dedicated the journal article confirming Yuri Pskovskii's proposed correlation to Pskovskii, who died a few weeks after Phillips' evidence confirming the relationship was published.

It has been recast to include the evolution in multiple photometric bandpasses, with a significantly shallower slope&lt;ref&gt;Hamuy, M., Phillips, M. M., Maza, J., Suntzeff, N. B., Schommer, R. A., &amp; Aviles, R. 1995, ''Astronomical Journal'', 109, 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riess, A. G., Press, W. H., &amp; Kirshner, R. P. 1996, ''AstrophysicsJournal'', 473, 88&lt;/ref&gt; and as a ''stretch'' in the time axis relative to a standard template.&lt;ref&gt;Perlmutter, S. A., &amp; et al.  1997, ''NATO ASIC Proc. 486: Thermonuclear Supernovae'', 749&lt;/ref&gt;
The relation is typically used to bring any Type Ia supernova peak magnitude to a [[standard candle]] value.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3179">'''Postnormal times''' ('''PNT''') is a concept developed by [[Ziauddin Sardar]] as a development of [[Post-normal Science]]. Sardar describes the present as "postnormal times", "in an in-between period where old orthodoxies are dying, new ones have yet to be born, and very few things seem to make sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sardar|first1=Ziauddin|title=Welcome to postnormal times|journal=Futures|date=June 2010|volume=42|issue=5|pages=435–444|doi=10.1016/j.futures.2009.11.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
In support of engaging communities of various scope and scale on how to best navigate PNT and imagine preferred pathways toward the future(s), Sardar and Sweeney published an article in the journal ''[[Futures (journal)|Futures]]'' outlining The Three Tomorrows method, which fills a gap in the field as "many methods of futures and foresight seldom incorporate pluralism and diversity intrinsically in their frameworks, and few, if any, emphasize the dynamic and merging nature of futures possibilities, or highlight the ignorance and uncertainties we constantly confront."&lt;ref&gt;Ziauddin Sardar &amp; John A. Sweeney, "The Three Tomorrows of Postnormal Times," Futures 75(2016) 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John A. Sweeney, "Signs of postnormal times," East-West Affairs 1, no. 3/4(2013).''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and criticism==
Rakesh Kapoor criticized PNT in 2011 as a Western concept, that does not apply to India and other [[emerging market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Rakesh Kapoor, "Is there a postnormal time? From the illusion of normality to the design for a new normality," Futures 43(2011) 216-220. &lt;/ref&gt; Sam Cole criticised the three C’s of PNT (chaos, complexity and contradictions) as "Alliterative Logic, theorizing through alliterative word-triads that is not based on empirical evidence".&lt;ref&gt;Sam Cole, "Alliterative logic: A theory of postnormal times," Futures 43(2011) 209-215.&lt;/ref&gt; Jay Gray has suggested that PNT is embryonic, needs a more robust framework, and should be extended to include [[C. S. Holling|C S Holling's]] adaptive cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Jay E. Gary, "Toward a new macrohistory: An extension to Sardar’s ‘postnormal times,’" Futures 43(2011) 48-51. &lt;/ref&gt; Scientists working on complex evolving systems have pointed out that PNT recalls the ‘Long Waves’ of [[Kondratiev wave|Kondratiev]] and [[Joseph Schumpeter]]’s view of waves of "creative destruction."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Allen and Liz Varga, "Modelling sustainable energy futures for the UK," Futures 57(2014) 28-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

PNT is one of the core areas of research for the Center for Postnormal Policy and Futures Studies at [[East-West University]] in [[Chicago]], Illinois, US. A number of articles and editorials on PNT have been published in the journal ''East-West Affairs''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6761">'''River Linking''' is project linking two or more [[river]]s by creating a network of manually created [[canal]]s, and providing land areas that otherwise does not have river water access and reducing the flow of water to sea using this means. It is based on the assumptions that surplus water in some rivers can be diverted to deficit rivers by creating a network of canals to interconnect the rivers.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:RiverLinkingMainMap.jpg|River linking map of India]] --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nwda.gov.in/index2.asp?slid=3&amp;sublinkid=3&amp;langid=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons and motivations==
For an instance, in India the rainfall over the country is primarily orographic, associated with tropical depressions originating in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. The summer monsoon accounts for more than 85 per cent of the precipitation. The uncertainty of occurrence of rainfall marked by prolonged dry spells and fluctuations in seasonal and annual rainfall is a serious problem for the country. Large parts of Haryana, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are not only in deficit in rainfall but also subject to large variations, resulting in frequent droughts and causing immense hardship to the population and enormous loss to the nation. The water availability even for drinking purposes becomes critical, particularly in the summer months as the rivers dry up and the ground water recedes. Regional variations in the rainfall lead to situations when some parts of the country do not have enough water even for raising a single crop. On the other hand, excess rainfall occurring in some parts of the country creates havoc due to floods.
 
Irrigation using river water and ground water has been the prime factor for raising the food grain production in India from a mere 50 million tonnes in the 1950s to more than 200 million tonnes at present, leading India to attain self-sufficiency in food. Irrigated area has increased from 22 million hectares to 95 million hectares during this period. The population of India, which is around 1000 million at present, is expected to increase to 1500 to 1800 million in the year 2050 and that would require about 450 million tonnes of food grains. For meeting this requirement, it would be necessary to increase irrigation potential to 160 million hectares for all crops by 2050. India's maximum irrigation potential that could be created through conventional sources has been assessed to be about 140 million hectares. For attaining a potential of 160 million hectares, other strategies shall have to be evolved.
 
Floods are a recurring feature, particularly by the Brahmaputra and Ganga rivers, in which almost 60 per cent of the river flows of India country occur. Flood damages, which were Rs. 52 crores in 1953, have gone up to Rs. 5,846 crores in 1998 with annual average being Rs. 1,343 crores affecting the States of Assam, Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh along with untold human sufferings. On the other hand, large areas in the States of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu face recurring droughts. As much as 85 percentage of drought prone area falls in these States. One of the most effective ways to increase the irrigation potential for increasing the food grain production, mitigating floods and droughts and reducing regional imbalance in the availability of water is the Inter Basin Water Transfer (IBWT) from the surplus rivers to deficit areas. Brahmaputra and Ganga particularly their northern tributaries, Mahanadi, Godavari and West Flowing Rivers originating from the Western Ghats are found to be surplus in water resources. If we can build storage reservoirs on these rivers and connect them to other parts of the country, regional imbalances could be reduced significantly and lot of benefits could be gained by way of additional irrigation, domestic and industrial water supply, hydropower generation, navigational facilities etc.

== Benefits ==

===Irrigation===
By linking the rivers, vast amount of land areas which will not otherwise be [[Irrigation|irrigated]] and are unusable for [[agriculture]] become fertile.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;[http://www.the-south-asian.com/Aug2004/River-linking.htm Article at the-south-asian], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flood prevention===
During heavy [[rainy season]]s some areas can experience heavy [[flood]]s while other areas might be experiencing [[drought]] like situations. With network of rivers this problem can be greatly avoided by channeling excess water to areas that are not experiencing a flood or are dry.

===Generation of electricity===
With new canals built, feasibility of new [[Damages|dams]] to generate [[hydroelectric power]] becomes a possibility.

===Navigation===
Newly created network of canals opens up new routes and ways and routes of water navigation, which is generally more efficient and cheaper compared to [[road transport]].

==National River Linking Project in India==
{{main|Indian Rivers Inter-link}}
The National River Linking Project (NRLP) is designed to ease [[water shortage]]s in western and southern [[India]] while mitigating the impacts of recurrent floods in the eastern parts of the [[Ganga basin]]. The NRLP, if and when implemented, will be one of the biggest interbasin water transfer projects in the world.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

==Issues and Concerns==

=== Ecological issues ===

One of the major concerns is that rivers change their course in 70–100 years and thus once they are linked, future change of course could create huge practical problems for the project.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

===Aqua life===
A number of leading [[environmentalist]]s are of the opinion that the project could be an [[ecological disaster]]. There would be a decrease in downstream flows resulting in reduction of [[fresh water]] inflows into the seas seriously jeopardizing [[aquatic life]].&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

=== Deforestation ===
Creation of canals would need large areas of land resulting large scale [[deforestation]] in certain areas.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

===Areas getting submerged===
Possibility of new dams comes with the threat of large otherwise habitable or reserved land getting submerged under water or surface water.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

===Displacement of people===
As large strips of land might have to be converted to canals, a considerable population living in this areas must need to be rehabilitated to new areas.

The '''Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute''' is a permanent [[research institute]] at the [[University of Utah]] that focuses on the development of new [[scientific computing]] and [[scientific visualization|visualization]] techniques, tools, and systems with primary applications to [[biomedical engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute – Home|url=http://www.sci.utah.edu/home.html|accessdate=2013-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lipson|first1=Hod|last2=Kurman|first2=Melba|title=Fabricated: The New World of 3D Printing|date=2013|publisher=Wiley|location=Indianapolis, IN|isbn=978-1118350638|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SCI Institute is noted worldwide in the [[visualization (graphics)|visualization]] community for contributions by faculty, alumni, and staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shneiderman|first1=Ben|title=The New ABCs of Research: Achieving Breakthrough Collaborations|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-875883-9|pages=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faculty are associated primarily with the [[University of Utah School of Computing|School of Computing]], Department of Bioengineering, Department of Mathematics, and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, with auxiliary faculty in the [[University of Utah Medical School|Medical School]] and [[University of Utah College of Architecture and Planning|School of Architecture]].

==History==
The Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute started in 1992 as a research group in the [[University of Utah School of Computing]] by [[Christopher R. Johnson|Chris Johnson]] and Rob MacLeod. In 1994 this group became the Center for Scientific Computing and Imaging, and in 2000 the name was changed to the Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute. In 2007, the SCI Institute was awarded funding from [[USTAR]] to recruit more faculty in medical imaging technology. The SCI Institute was recognized as an [[Nvidia|NVIDIA]] [[CUDA]] Center of Excellence in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Humber|first1=Andrew|title=NVIDIA Recognizes University Of Utah As A Cuda Center Of Excellence|url=http://www.nvidia.com/object/io_1217508281856.html|publisher=NVIDIA|accessdate=8 April 2017|language=en-us|date=31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[USTAR]] funding allowed faculty recruitment for genomic [[signal processing]] and information visualization. in 2014, [[Intel]] partnered with the SCI Institute to form the Intel Parallel Computing Center for Scientific Rendering to research and develop large scale and in situ visualization techniques for Intel hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intel® Parallel Computing Center at SCI Institute, University of Utah {{!}} Intel® Software|url=https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-parallel-computing-center-at-sci-institute-university-of-utah|website=Intel Developer Zone|accessdate=8 April 2017|language=en|date=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The overarching research objective of the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute is to conduct [[applied science|application-driven research]] in the creation of new [[scientific computing]] techniques, tools, and systems. Given the proximity and availability of research conducted at the [[University of Utah School of Medicine]], a main application focus is [[medicine]]. SCI Institute researchers also apply computational techniques to scientific and engineering sub-specialties, such as [[fluid dynamics]], [[biomechanics]], [[electrophysiology]], bioelectric fields, [[scientific visualization]], [[parallel computing]], [[inverse problems]], and [[neuroimaging]].

'''''Sexual Morality and the Law''''' is the transcription of a 1978 radio conversation in [[Paris]] between philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], playwright/actor/lawyer [[Jean Danet]], and novelist/gay activist [[Guy Hocquenghem]], debating the idea of [[age of consent reform|abolishing age of consent laws]] in France.

In 1977, the issue was brought to public attention in France by a [[French petitions against age of consent laws|petition against age of consent laws]] addressed to the Parliament, defending the decriminalization of all consented sexual relations between adults and [[minor (law)|minor]]s below the age of fifteen (the [[age of consent]] in France).&lt;ref name="petition" /&gt;  Foucault stated that the petition was signed by several philosophers including himself, [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Louis Althusser]], pediatrician and psychoanalyst [[Françoise Dolto]], and also by people he described as belonging to a wide range of political positions.&lt;ref name="petition"&gt;Foucault, Michel, edited by Lawrence D. Kritzman. ''Politics, Philosophy, Culture: Interviews and other writings 1977-1984.'' New York/London: Routledge, 1988, p.273. {{ISBN|0-415-90082-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dialogue was broadcast on April 4, 1978 by radio [[France Culture]].&lt;ref name="danger" /&gt; It was originally published in French as ''La loi de la pudeur'' [literally, "The law of decency"] and reprinted in English as ''The Danger of Child Sexuality''.&lt;ref name="danger"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ipce.info/ipceweb/Library/danger.htm|title=The Danger of Child Sexuality – an interview with Michel Foucault|accessdate=2010-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text was later included under the title ''Sexual Morality and the Law'' in Foucault’s book ''Politics, Philosophy, Culture&amp;nbsp;– Interviews and other writings, 1977–1984''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Politics, Philosophy, Culture – Interviews and other writings 1977–1984]]|author=Michel Foucault, edited by Lawrence D. Kritzman|year=1988|isbn=0-415-90082-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Foucault and Hocquenghem focus, in the first place, on the penalization of the "sexual offences", at the time of the 19th century, and on the invention by the then incipient [[psychiatry]] of the category of the "[[perversion|perverts]]".

Foucault points out that the French Penal Code of 1810 comprises 485 articles defining crimes, offenses, and misdemeanors as well as the resulting punishments. It was promulgated on February 12, 1810, and did not regulate the sexual behaviors, "as if sexuality was not the business of the law". He explains that legislation on sexuality during the 19th century and specially in the 20th century, at the time of [[Philippe Pétain|Pétain]] and of the "[[Sodomy law#France|Mirguet amendment]]" (1960). The [[Sodomy law#France|Mirguet amendment]] of July 18, 1960, increased the penalties for "public insult against decency" between same sex couples. It has changed article 38 of the 1958 French constitution.

Foucault, Hocquenghem and Danet denounce the increasing psychiatrization of society and the introduction of a [[social control]] over sexuality. Foucault had already outlined this analysis of what he calls the "device of sexuality" in his work ''[[The Will to Knowledge]]'' (1976). "All the legislation on sexuality", affirms Foucault, "introduced since the 19th century in France, is a set of laws on decency", which appears impossible to define, becoming thus a flexible tool politically used in several local tactics.  Foucault stressed that:
:''"What is emerging is a new penal system, a new legislative system whose function is not so much to punish offenses against these general laws concerning decency, as to protect populations and parts of populations regarded as particularly vulnerable"''  (for example children).  ''"Therefore, there would be on one side the fragile population, and on the other side the "dangerous population" "'' (the adult in general).

Danet affirms that "what takes place with the intervention of psychiatrists in court is a manipulation of the children's consent, a manipulation of their words".

Using among other things the example of the movement of protest, in Germany, at the end of the 19th century, against article 175 of the [[German Penal Code]] which criminalized any homosexual act, Danet considers that the psychiatrists "expected only one thing from the abolition of this law, namely, to be able to take over the 'perverts'" [as homosexuals were regarded at that time] "for themselves and to treat them with all the knowledge that they claimed to have acquired since around 1860" (Danet cites then [[Bénédict Morel|Morel]] and his ''Treaty of degenerescence'', published in 1857).

==Main ideas of the text==

===The fabrication of a crime===
Foucault observes that whereas the law formerly condemned the infringement, the act of breaking the law, we enter from now on in a disciplinary society which condemns the criminal himself&amp;nbsp;– called "[[wikt:delinquent|delinquent]]" or "[[pervert]]"&amp;nbsp;–  and instead of punishing the act, we criminalize a person or a category of the population.

Hocquenghem sustains that "a whole mixture of notions" is responsible for the fabrication of the idea of the crime against [[decency]], ranging from religious [[prohibition]]s concerning [[sodomy]] to the separation between the world of the [[child]] and the world of the [[adult]].

He observes that this was possible due to the creation of a category of people regarded as "perverts", "legal monsters" whose aim in life would be to practice sex with children. They would then really become intolerable perverts since the crime as such is recognized, and reinforced by a psychological and sociological arsenal.

Hahn&amp;nbsp;– who coordinated the debate&amp;nbsp;– remembers then that this idea leads us to the concept of the "born criminal", present in the work of Italian controversial criminologist [[Cesare Lombroso]]: "Indeed this idea that legislation, the legal system, the penal system, even medicine must concern themselves essentially with dangers, with dangerous individuals rather than acts, dates more or less from Lombroso and so it is not at all surprising if one finds Lombroso's ideas coming back into fashion", he said.

Hocquenghem considered the construction of this new type of criminal&amp;nbsp;– an individual perverse enough "to do a thing that hitherto had always been done without anybody thinking it right to stick his nose into it" – as "an extremely grave step from a political point of view":
:''"In the case of "attentat sans violence" [attack without violence], the offence in which the police have been unable to find anything, nothing at all, in that case, the criminal is simply a criminal because he is a criminal, because he has those tastes. It is what used to be called a [[crime of opinion]]. (...) The crime vanishes, nobody is concerned any longer to know whether in fact a crime was committed or not, whether someone has been hurt or not. No one is even concerned any more whether there actually was a victim."''

Hocquenghem concludes that the crime feeds upon itself in a man-hunt, by the identification and isolation of the category of individuals regarded as [[pedophile]]s, and the call for a [[lynching]] sent out by the "[[sensationalism|gutter press]]".

Jean Danet adds that this crime without violence can be used by the state for political reasons, against "inconvenient" individuals: "Incitement of a minor to commit an immoral act, for example, can be used against social workers and teachers. (...) In 1976 in Nantes, a teacher was tried for inciting minors to immoral acts, when in fact what he had done was to supply contraceptives to the boys and girls in his charge".

Danet predicted that a new form of social control would replace the legal one, had their proposal to reform the law been approved. "If it has been possible to believe for a time that there was to be a withdrawal of legislation, it was not because we thought that we were living in a liberal period but because we knew that more subtle forms of sexual supervision would be set up&amp;nbsp;– and perhaps the apparent freedom that camouflaged these more subtle, more diffuse social controls was going to extend beyond the field of the juridical and the penal".

===A society of dangers===
Foucault sees the emergence of a new [[penal system]], with the focus changing from criminal acts to the definition of [[sexual predator|dangerous individuals]]. He predicted that a society of dangers would come:
:''"We're going to have a society of dangers, with, on the one side, those who are in danger, and on the other, those who are dangerous. (...) [[human sexuality|Sexuality]] will become a threat in all [[social relations]], in all relations between members of different [[age group]]s, in all relations between individuals. And sexuality will no longer be a kind of [[behavior]] hedged in by precise prohibitions, but a kind of roaming danger, a sort of omnipresent phantom, a phantom that will be played out between men and women, children and adults, and possibly between adults themselves. It is on this shadow, this phantom, this fear that the authorities would try to get a grip through an apparently generous and, at least general, legislation and through a series of particular interventions that would probably be made by the legal institutions, with the support of the medical institutions."''

He identified the fear of others’ sexuality as the reason for this change:
:''"The [[legislator]] will not justify the measures that he is proposing by saying: the universal decency of mankind must be defended. What he will say is: there are people for whom others' sexuality may become a permanent danger".''

Foucault foresaw a new regime for the supervision of sexuality, with the intervention of legal institutions and the support of medical institutions. He completed: "I would say that the danger lay there". In his book ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1975), he had already detailed his ideas against an increasing social control over the behavior of the individual.

===The establishment of a new medical power===
Foucault stressed that with this focus change to the individual, legislation appeals now to medical knowledge, giving the chance to [[psychiatry|psychiatrists]] to intervene twice: first to say that, indeed, children do have a sexuality, and second to establish that child sexuality is a territory with its own geography, that the adult must not enter.

Jean Danet added that some psychiatrists consider that sexual relations between children and adults "are always [[Psychological trauma|traumatizing]]", that the child "is marked forever", will become emotionally disturbed and if a child doesn't remember them, it's because they remain in his or her [[subconscious]].

He ponders that the intervention of psychiatrists in [[court]] is a manipulation of the children’s [[consent]], of their words.
Foucault remarks with [[irony]] the position of specialists:
:''"It could be that the child, with his own sexuality, may have desired that adult, he may even have consented, he may even have made the first moves. We may even agree that it was he who [[seduction|seduced]] the adult. But we specialists with our psychological knowledge know perfectly well that even the seducing child runs a risk, of being damaged and traumatized. (...) Consequently, the child must be 'protected from his own desires', even when his desires turn him towards an adult".''

He concludes that it is within this new legislative framework&amp;nbsp;– "basically intended to protect certain vulnerable sections of the population with the establishment of a new medical power"&amp;nbsp;– that a conception of sexuality and of the relations between child and adult sexuality will be based, and considers it as "extremely questionable".

===Guilt by association===
Hocquenghem observed that this 1977 French petition has been signed by a lot of people “who are suspect neither of being particularly pedophiles themselves nor even of entertaining [[extremism|extravagant political views]]”.

Danet pointed out that  [[lawyer]]s who choose to defend someone found [[Guilt (law)|guilt]]y of an indecent act with a [[Minor (law)|minor]] end up facing serious public backlash and are suspect of being favorable to such acts. Their experience is akin to that of lawyers defending [[terrorism|terrorists]] (as happened in the [[Klaus Croissant|Croissant affair]]),. Many, he said, avoid doing so, and prefer being appointed by the court. He said that "anyone who defends a pedophile may be suspected of having some sympathy for that cause. Even [[judge]]s think to themselves: if he defends them, it's because he isn't really as much against it himself".

He argued that “just because one is involved in a struggle against some authority, (...) this does not mean one is on the side of those who are subjected to it”. Two examples are given, dating back to the 19th and early 20th centuries: in [[France]], an open letter signed by [[Psychology|psychologists]], [[Sexology|sexologists]] and [[Psychiatry|psychiatrists]], asking for the decriminalization of immoral acts with minors between the ages of 15 and 18, and in [[Germany]] where a whole movement (made up of [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] and members of the medical community) protested against a law that [[Criminalization|criminalized]] homosexual acts.

===Childhood and the notion of consent===
While today the very possibility of consent before puberty is [[polemic]]&amp;nbsp;– often raising emotional responses and leaving [[intellectual]]s in a defensive position, in 1977–1978 Foucault, Hocquenghem and Danet admitted openly and with naturalness the idea of a non-abusive pedophilia.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The 1977 petition refers to all ages below the [[age of consent]] in France (fifteen), including the ages before [[puberty]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  The biological definition of pedophilia is recognized by the [[United Nations]] and accepted in the [[Francophone]] world.

Both Foucault and Hocquenghem agreed that consent is a contractual notion. 'This notion of consent is a trap, in any case. What is sure is that the legal form of an intersexual consent is nonsense. No one signs a contract before making love', said Hocquenghem.
:''"When we say that children are 'consenting' in these cases, all we intend to say is this: in any case, there was no violence, or organized manipulation in order to wrench out of them affective or erotic relations"'', he completed.

The journalist Pierre Hahn asks twice about how to determine an age for consent:  "Public opinion, including enlightened opinion such as that of the doctors of the Institute of Sexology ( L'Institut de Sexologie), asked at what age there can be said to be definite consent. It's a big problem. (...) If you were a legislator, you would fix no limit and you would leave it to the judges to decide whether or not an indecent act was committed with or without consent? Is that your position?". Foucault answers that "it is difficult to lay down barriers", and that this wouldn’t make any sense. He added that he discussed the subject with a judge who told him that there are eighteen-year-old girls who are practically forced to have sex with their fathers or stepfathers: "They may be eighteen, but it's an intolerable system of constraint", he said.

As for the legal aspect, the lawyer Jean Danet observed that [[conclusive presumption|violence is legally presumed]], even "in a case in which the charge used is that of indecent act without violence". This happens because the legislator believed that "it has to be said that this act without violence [defined as a crime] is the repressive, legal translation of consenting pleasure". Danet completed that "It's pretty clear how the system of proof is manipulated in opposite ways in the case of rape of women and in the case of indecent assault on a minor."

On the other side, Danet acknowledged that sometimes consent may not be present. "We are not, of course, saying that consent is always there".

He pointed out that they were very careful in the text of the petition, so as to separate [[rape]] from acts without violence:
:''"We took great care to speak exclusively of an indecent act not involving [[violence]] and incitement of a minor to commit an indecent act. We were extremely careful not to touch, in any way, on the problem of rape, which is totally different."''

He observed then that the problem of (violent) rape arouses reactions at the level of [[public opinion]], triggering off secondary effects of [[Manhunt (law enforcement)|man-hunting]], [[lynching]] and [[Moral panic|moral mobilization]].

===The credibility of children in court===
As for the [[credibility]] of children in court, Foucault begins pointing out that officially children are supposed to have a [[human sexuality|sexuality]] that can never be directed towards an adult, and are also supposed to not be capable of talking about themselves in a sufficiently lucid way. Secondly, he argues that the speech of the child is reliable in order to establish what happened, once there is sympathy enough. He said:
:''"After all, listening to a child, hearing him speak, hearing him explain what his relations actually were with someone, adult or not, provided one listens with enough [[sympathy]], must allow one to establish more or less what degree of violence, if any, was used or what degree of consent was given".''

He vehemently opposed any doubt on the child's ability to speak about the facts: "To assume that a child is incapable of explaining what happened and was incapable of giving his consent are two [[abuse]]s that are intolerable, quite unacceptable. (...) The child may be [[Trust (sociology)|trusted]] to say whether or not he was subjected to violence".

Hocquenghem observed that the [[trial]] ceremony constrains the child: "The public affirmation of consent to such acts is extremely difficult, as we know. Everybody&amp;nbsp;— judges, doctors, the defendant&amp;nbsp;– knows that the child was consenting&amp;nbsp;– but nobody says anything, because, apart from anything else, there's no way it can be introduced".

He stressed that it is impossible to express a complete [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] between an adult and a child, a relationship involving all kinds of [[affective]] contacts and going through all kinds of stages (which are not all exclusively sexual), solely in terms of consent, and that to express it in terms of legal consent is an absurdity:
:''"In any case, if one listens to what a child says and if he says 'I didn't mind', that doesn't have the legal value of 'I consent'."''

[[Image:Édouard-Henri Avril (13).jpg|thumb|250px|Sexual penetration occurring in the [[missionary position]], depicted by [[Édouard-Henri Avril]]]]

'''Sexual penetration''' is the insertion of a body part or other object into a [[body orifice]], such as the [[vagina]], [[anus]] or [[mouth]], as part of [[human sexual activity]] or [[animal sexual behavior]].

The term is most commonly used in statute law in the context of proscribing certain sexual activities. Terms such as “[[sexual intercourse]]” or “[[carnal knowledge]]” are more commonly found in older statutes, while many modern criminal statutes use the term “sexual penetration” because it is a broad term encompassing (unless otherwise qualified) any form of penetrative sex, including digital (meaning with the digits, i.e., the fingers) or with an object, and may involve only the most minimal penetration. Some jurisdictions refer to some forms of penetration as "acts of indecency", or other terminology. 

==Definitions==
When a [[Human penis|penis]] is inserted into a woman's vagina, it is generally called vaginal or sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="Starr"&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Biology|isbn =0495561819|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2008|page=314|accessdate=April 30, 2013|url=https://books.google.com/?id=09reWGhFDqUC&amp;pg=PA314|author=Cecie Starr, Beverly McMillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sexual intercourse| publisher=''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''| accessdate=September 5, 2012|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/sexual-intercourse}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a penis penetrates another person's anus, it is called [[anal sex]] or anal intercourse.&lt;ref name="Answer"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Orgasm Answer Guide|isbn = 978-0-8018-9396-4|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press|JHU Press]]|year=2009|pages=108–109|accessdate=November 6, 2011|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Kkts3AX9QVAC&amp;pg=PA108|author1 = Barry R.

Carroll|title =Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity|isbn = 978-0-495-60274-3|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2009|pages=270–271|accessdate=December 19, 2010|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5f8mQx7ULs4C&amp;pg=PA271}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Penetrative [[oral sex]] may involve penetration of the mouth by a penis ([[fellatio]]) or the use of the tongue to penetrate a woman's vagina or [[vulva]] ([[cunnilingus]]). The tongue may also penetrate the anus during [[anilingus]], which is a form of oral and anal sex. If one or more fingers are used to penetrate an orifice, it is called [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]] or digital penetration. The insertion of an object, such as a [[dildo]], [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]] or other [[sex toy]], into a person's genital area or anus may also be considered sexual penetration.

==Unlawful==
{{See also|Human sexual activity#Legal issues}}
Penetrative [[sex crimes]] are generally considered more serious than [[non-penetrative sex]] crimes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/sexual_assult_by_penetration/ Guidelines for sentencing, UK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115152923/http://cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/sexual_assult_by_penetration/ |date=2013-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and sexual penetration of a child even more so. A child below the statutory [[age of consent]] generally cannot consent to acts involving sexual penetration. In laws, the term ''sexual penetration'' is commonly used in relation to sex with children. Unlawful sexual penetration is generally an offense irrespective of how deep the penetration was and irrespective of whether [[ejaculation]] of semen took place.

Laws may distinguish particular forms of sexual penetration as part of the offense. For example, the law in the U.S. state of [[Oregon]] provides:
{{quote|"Unlawful sexual penetration in the first degree" is a [[felony]] that occurs where the offender "penetrates the vagina, anus or penis of another with any object other than the penis or mouth of the actor", if the victim is "subjected to forcible compulsion", or is "under 12 years of age", or "is incapable of consent by reason of mental defect, mental incapacitation or physical helplessness"|[https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/163.411 Unlawful sexual penetration in the first degree], Oregon Statutes § 163.411}}

In the [[United Kingdom]], sexually penetrating a relative is an offense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/part/1/crossheading/sex-with-an-adult-relative Sexual Offences Act 2003] retrieved 24 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Various forms of penetration have at times been considered [[Obscenity|obscene]] and been prohibited. Works containing such penetrations may be considered [[pornography]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17761">{{Other uses|Synonym}}
In [[nomenclature|scientific nomenclature]], a '''synonym''' is a [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific name]] that applies to a [[taxon]] that (now) goes by a different scientific name,&lt;ref name=ICNsyn /&gt; although the term is used somewhat differently in the zoological code of nomenclature.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ICZN|''ICZN'']], "Glossary", entry for "synonym"&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] was the first to give a scientific name (under the currently used system of scientific nomenclature) to the Norway spruce, which he called ''Pinus abies''. This name is no longer in use: it is now a synonym of the current scientific name, ''[[Picea abies]]''.

Unlike [[synonym]]s in other contexts, in taxonomy a synonym is not interchangeable with the name of which it is a synonym. In taxonomy, synonyms are not equals, but have a different status. For any taxon with a particular [[circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]], position, and rank, only one scientific name is considered to be the correct one at any given time (this correct name is to be determined by applying the relevant [[Nomenclature codes|code of nomenclature]]). A synonym cannot exist in isolation: it is always an alternative to a different scientific name. Given that the correct name of a taxon depends on the taxonomic viewpoint used (resulting in a particular circumscription, position and rank) a name that is one taxonomist's synonym may be another taxonomist's correct name (and ''vice versa'').

Synonyms may arise whenever the same taxon is described and named more than once, independently. They may also arise when existing taxa are changed, as when two taxa are joined to become one, a species is moved to a different genus, a variety is moved to a different species, etc. Synonyms also come about when the codes of nomenclature change, so that older names are no longer acceptable; for example, ''Erica herbacea'' &lt;small&gt;[[Carl Linnaeus|L.]]&lt;/small&gt; has been [[Conserved name|rejected]] in favour of ''[[Erica carnea]]'' &lt;small&gt;L.&lt;/small&gt; and is thus its synonym.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ICN|''ICN'']], Appendix IV&lt;/ref&gt;

== General usage ==
To the general user of scientific names, in fields such as agriculture, horticulture, ecology, general science, etc., a synonym is a name that was previously used as the correct scientific name (in handbooks and similar sources) but which has been displaced by another scientific name, which is now regarded as correct. Thus Oxford Dictionaries Online defines the term as "a taxonomic name which has the same application as another, especially one which has been superseded and is no longer valid."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Definition of synonym from Oxford Dictionaries Online |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/synonym |accessdate=2011-11-28 |postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In handbooks and general texts, it is useful to have synonyms mentioned as such after the current scientific name, so as to avoid confusion. For example, if the much advertised name change should go through and the scientific name of the [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] were changed to ''Sophophora melanogaster'', it would be very helpful if any mention of this name was accompanied by "(syn. ''Drosophila melanogaster'')".  Synonyms used in this way may not always meet the strict definitions of the term "synonym" in the formal rules of nomenclature which govern scientific names ''(see below)''.

Changes of scientific name have two causes: they may be taxonomic or nomenclatural. A name change may be caused by changes in the circumscription, position or rank of a taxon, representing a change in taxonomic, scientific insight (as would be the case for the fruit fly, mentioned above). A name change may be due to purely nomenclatural reasons, that is, based on the rules of nomenclature;{{CN|date=December 2016}} as for example when an older name is (re)discovered which has priority over the current name. Speaking in general, name changes for nomenclatural reasons have become less frequent over time as the rules of nomenclature allow for names to be conserved, so as to promote stability of scientific names.

{{Further|Valid name (zoology)}}
[[File:Triturus boscai.001.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Scientific Latin|Latin]] ''Caudata'' and [[Scientific Greek|Greek]] ''Urodela'' both mean "tailed" and have been used as a [[scientific name]] at the [[taxonomic rank]] of [[Order (biology)|order]] for the [[salamander]]s (as opposed to the tail-less [[frog]]s). Thus they are synonyms.]]
In [[zoological]] [[scientific nomenclature|nomenclature]], codified in the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'', synonyms are different scientific names of the same [[taxonomic rank]] that pertain to that same [[taxon]]. To give examples of such synonyms {{clarify|text=using different taxa (the plural of taxon): |post-text= - All taxa or some? Not in higher taxa/highest taxon? In theory or practice?|date=October 2017}}
{{Biological classification}}
* a particular species could have two or more [[species (biology)|species-rank]] names published for it, while
* a particular order could have two or more [[order (biology)|order-rank]] names published for it as well.

The earliest published name is called the '''senior synonym''', while the later name is the '''junior synonym'''.

One basic principle of zoological nomenclature is that the earliest correctly published (and thus [[available name|available]]) name, the senior synonym, by default takes precedence in [[Naming rights#Other examples|naming rights]] and therefore, unless other restrictions interfere, must be used for the taxon. However, junior synonyms are still important to document, because if the earliest name cannot be used (for example, because the same spelling had previously been used for a name established for another taxon), then the next available junior synonym must be used for the taxon.

'''Objective synonyms'''{{anchor|Objective synonym}} refer to taxa with the same [[Type (biology)|type]] and same rank (more or less the same taxon, although circumscription may vary, even widely). This may be species-group taxa of the same rank with the same [[Type (biology)|type specimen]], genus-group taxa of the same rank with the same [[type species]] or if their type species are themselves objective synonyms, of family-group taxa with the same type genus, etc.&lt;ref&gt;''ICZN'', Art. 61.3&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Subjective synonym}}In the case of '''subjective synonyms''', there is no such shared type, so the synonymy is open to taxonomic judgement,&lt;ref&gt;''ICZN'', Art. 61.3.1&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that there is room for debate: one researcher might consider the two (or more) types to refer to one and the same taxon, another might consider them to belong to different taxa. For example, [[John Edward Gray]] published the name ''Antilocapra anteflexa'' in 1855 for a species of [[pronghorn]], based on a pair of horns. However, it is now commonly accepted that his specimen was an unusual individual of the species ''Antilocapra americana'' published by [[George Ord]] in 1815. Ord's name thus takes precedence, with ''Antilocapra anteflexa'' being a junior subjective synonym.

Objective synonyms are common at the rank of genera, because for various reasons two genera may contain the same type species; these are objective synonyms.&lt;ref&gt;''ICZN'', Art. 61.3.3&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases researchers established new generic names because they thought this was necessary or did not know that others had previously established another genus for the same group of species. An example is the genus ''Pomatia'' Beck, 1837,&lt;ref&gt;p. 43 in Beck, H. 1837. Index molluscorum præsentis ævi musei principis augustissimi Christiani Frederici. – pp. 1–100 [1837], 101–124 [1838]. Hafniæ.&lt;/ref&gt; which was established for a group of terrestrial snails containing as its type species the Burgundy or Roman snail ''[[Helix pomatia]]''—since ''Helix pomatia'' was already the type species for the genus ''Helix'' Linnaeus, 1758, the genus ''Pomatia'' was an objective synonym (and useless). At the same occasion ''Helix'' is also a synonym of ''Pomatia'', but it is older and so it has precedence.

At the species level, subjective synonyms are common because of an unexpectedly large range of variation in a species, or simple ignorance about an earlier description, may lead a biologist to describe a newly discovered specimen as a new species. A common reason for objective synonyms at this level is the creation of a replacement name.

It is possible for a junior synonym to be given precedence over a senior synonym,&lt;ref&gt;''ICZN'', Art. 23.9 "reversal of precedence"&lt;/ref&gt; primarily when the senior name has not been used since 1899, and the junior name is in common use. The older name may be declared to be a ''[[nomen oblitum]]'', and the junior name declared a ''[[Nomen oblitum|nomen protectum]]''. This rule exists primarily to prevent the confusion that would result if a well-known name, with a large accompanying body of literature, were to be replaced by a completely unfamiliar name. An example is the European land snail ''[[Petasina edentula]]'' ([[Jacques Philippe Raymond Draparnaud|Draparnaud]], 1805). In 2002, researchers found that an older name ''Helix depilata'' Draparnaud, 1801 referred to the same species, but this name had never been used after 1899 and was fixed as a ''nomen oblitum'' under this rule by Falkner ''et al''. 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner, G., Ripken, T. E. J. &amp; Falkner, M. 2002. Mollusques continentaux de France. Liste de référence annotée et bibliographie. – pp. [1–2], 1–350, [1–3]. Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a reversal of precedence is also possible if the senior synonym was established after 1900, but only if the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN)]] approves an application. (Note that here the C in ICZN stands for Commission, not Code as it does at the beginning of [[#Zoology|§&amp;nbsp;Zoology]]. The two are related, with only one word difference between their names.) For example, the scientific name of the [[red imported fire ant]], ''Solenopsis invicta'' was published by Buren in 1972, who did not know that this species was first named ''Solenopsis saevissima wagneri'' by Santschi in 1916; as there were thousands of publications using the name ''invicta'' before anyone discovered the synonymy, the ICZN, in 2001, ruled that ''invicta'' would be given precedence over ''wagneri''.

To qualify as a synonym in zoology, a name must be properly published in accordance with the rules. Manuscript names and names that were mentioned without any description (''[[Nomen nudum|nomina nuda]]'') are not considered as synonyms in zoological nomenclature.

==Botany==
In [[botanical nomenclature]], a synonym is a name that is not correct for the [[circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]], position, and [[Taxonomic rank|rank]] of the taxon as considered in the particular botanical publication. It is always "a synonym of the correct scientific name", but which name is correct depends on the taxonomic opinion of the author. In botany the various kinds of synonyms are:
* Homotypic,{{anchor|Homotypic synonym}} or nomenclatural, synonyms (sometimes indicated by [[Triple bar|≡]]) have the same [[Type (biology)|type]] (specimen) and the same [[taxonomic rank]]. The Linnaean name ''Pinus abies'' L. has the same type as ''Picea abies'' (L.) H.Karst. When ''Picea'' is taken to be the correct genus for this species (there is almost complete consensus on that), ''Pinus abies'' is a homotypic synonym of ''Picea abies''. However, if the species were considered to belong to ''Pinus'' (now unlikely) the relationship would be reversed and ''Picea abies'' would become a homotypic synonym of ''Pinus abies''. A homotypic synonym need not share an epithet or name with the correct name; what matters is that it shares the type. For example, the name ''Taraxacum officinale'' for a species of dandelion has the same type as ''Leontodon taraxacum'' L. The latter is a homotypic synonym of ''Taraxacum officinale'' F.H.Wigg.
* Heterotypic, {{anchor|Heterotypic synonym}}or taxonomic, synonyms (sometimes indicated by =) have different types. Some botanists [[lumpers and splitters|split]] the [[Taraxacum officinale|common dandelion]] into many, quite restricted species. The name of each such species has its own type. When the common dandelion is regarded as including all those small species, the names of all those species are heterotypic synonyms of ''Taraxacum officinale'' F.H.Wigg. Reducing a taxon to a heterotypic synonym is termed "to sink in synonymy" or "as synonym".

In botany, although a synonym must be a formally accepted scientific name (a validly published name): a listing of "synonyms", a "synonymy", often contains designations that for some reason did not make it as a formal name, such as manuscript names, or even misidentifications (although it is now the usual practice to list misidentifications separately&lt;ref name=ICN1&gt;[[#ICN|''ICN'']], Recommendation 50D&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Comparison between zoology and botany ==
Although the basic principles are fairly similar, the treatment of synonyms in botanical nomenclature differs in detail and terminology from zoological nomenclature, where the correct name is included among synonyms, although as first among equals it is the "senior synonym":
* Synonyms in botany are comparable to "junior synonyms" in zoology.
* The homotypic or nomenclatural synonyms in botany are comparable to "objective synonyms" in zoology.
* The heterotypic or taxonomic synonyms in botany are comparable to "subjective synonyms" in zoology.

== Synonym lists ==
Scientific papers may include lists of taxa, synonymizing existing taxa and (in some cases) listing references to them.

The status of a synonym may be indicated by symbols, as for instance in a system proposed for use in [[paleontology]] by Rudolf Richter. In that system a &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; before the year would indicate that the authors have inspected the original material; a &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; that they take on the responsibility for the act of synonymizing the taxa.&lt;ref name="Matthews1973"&gt;{{Citation|title=Notes on open nomenclature and synonymy lists|url=https://cdn.palass.org//publications/palaeontology/volume_16/pdf/vol16_part4_pp713-719.pdf|year=1973|postscript=.|author=Matthews, S. C.|journal=[[Palaeontology (journal)|Palaeontology]]|volume=16|pages=713–719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other usage ==
The traditional concept of synonymy is often expanded in taxonomic literature to include "pro parte" (or "for part") synonyms. These are caused by splits and circumscriptional changes. They are usually indicated by the abbreviation "p.p."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Berendsohn|first=W. G. |year=1995|title=The concept of "potential taxa" in databases|journal=Taxon |volume=44|pages=207–212|url=http://www.bgbm.fu-berlin.de/biodivinf/docs/PotentialTaxa/PotentialTaxa.pdf|format= PDF|doi=10.2307/1222443|issue=2|postscript=.|jstor=1222443}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example:
* When [[James Edgar Dandy|Dandy]] described ''[[Galium tricornutum]]'', he cited ''G. tricorne'' Stokes (1787) pro parte as a synonym, but explicitly excluded the type (specimen) of ''G. tricorne'' from the new species ''G. tricornutum''. Thus ''G. tricorne'' was subdivided.
* The [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]]'s summary of plant classification states that family [[Verbenaceae]] "are much reduced compared to a decade or so ago, and many genera have been placed in [[Lamiaceae]]", but ''[[Avicennia]]'', which was once included in Verbenaceae has been moved to [[Acanthaceae]]. Thus, it could be said that Verbenaceae pro parte is a synonym of Acanthaceae, and Verbenaceae pro parte is also a synonym of Lamiaceae. However, this terminology is rarely used because it is clearer to reserve the term "pro parte" for situations that divide a taxon that includes the type from one that does not.

'''Tap water''' (''running water'', ''city water'', ''town water'', ''municipal water'', etc.) is [[water]] supplied to a [[tap (valve)]]. Its uses include drinking, washing, cooking, and the flushing of [[toilet]]s. Indoor tap water is distributed through "indoor [[plumbing]]", which has existed since antiquity but was available to very few people until the second half of the 19th century when it began to spread in popularity in what are now [[developed country|developed countries]]. Tap water became common in many regions during the 20th century, and is now lacking mainly among people in poverty, especially in [[developing country|developing countries]].

Tap water is often culturally assumed to be [[drinking water]], especially in developed countries. Usually it is potable, although [[water quality]] problems are not rare. Household [[water purification]] methods such as [[water filter]]s, [[boiling]], or [[distillation]] can be used when tap water's potability is doubted. The application of technologies (such as [[water treatment]] plants) involved in providing clean water to homes, businesses, and public buildings is a major subfield of [[sanitary engineering]]. Calling a water supply "tap water" distinguishes it from the other main types of fresh water which may be available; these include water from rainwater-collecting [[cistern]]s, water from [[village pump]]s or town pumps, water from [[Water well|well]]s, or water carried from streams, rivers, or lakes (whose potability may vary).

==Background==
Publicly available treated water has historically been associated with major increases in life expectancy and improved [[public health]].  [[Water-borne diseases]] are vastly reduced by proper sewage and fresh water availability. Providing tap water to large urban or suburban populations requires a complex and carefully designed system of collection, storage, [[water purification|treatment]] and distribution, and is commonly the responsibility of a government agency, often the same agency responsible for the removal and treatment of [[clean water]].

Specific [[compound (chemistry)|chemical compounds]] are often taken out of tap water during the treatment process to adjust the [[pH]] or remove contaminants, and [[chlorine]] may be added to kill [[biotoxin|biological toxins]]. Local geological conditions affecting [[groundwater]] are determining factors for the presence of various metal [[ion]]s, often rendering the water "[[soft water|soft]]" or "[[hard water|hard]]".

Tap water remains susceptible to biological or chemical contamination. In the event of contamination deemed dangerous to public health, government officials typically issue an advisory regarding water consumption. In the case of [[biological contamination]], residents are usually advised to boil their water before consumption or to use bottled water as an alternative. In the case of chemical contamination, residents may be advised to refrain from consuming tap water entirely until the matter is resolved.

In many areas a [[compound (chemistry)|compound]] of [[fluoride]] is added to tap water in an effort to improve [[dental health]] among the public. In some communities "[[Water fluoridation|fluoridation]]" remains a controversial issue. (See [[water fluoridation controversy]].)

==Potable water supply==
{{main|Potable water}}
This supply may come from several possible sources.
* [[Water purification|Municipal water supply]]
* [[Water well]]s
* Processed water from creeks, streams, rivers, lakes, rainwater, etc.

Domestic water systems have been evolving since people first located their homes near a running water supply, such as a stream or river.  The water flow also allowed sending waste water away from the residences.

Modern indoor plumbing delivers clean, safe, potable water to each service point in the distribution system.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}  It is important that the clean water not be contaminated by the waste water (disposal) side of the process system.  Historically, this contamination of drinking water has been the largest killer of humans.&lt;ref&gt;''Plumbing: the Arteries of Civilization'', Modern Marvels video series, The History Channel, AAE-42223, A&amp;E Television, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Tap water can sometimes appear cloudy, often mistaken for mineral impurities in the water. It is usually caused by air bubbles coming out of solution due to change in temperature or pressure. Because cold water holds more air than warm water, small bubbles will appear in water. It has a high dissolved gas content that is heated or depressurized, which reduces how much dissolved gas the water can hold. The harmless cloudiness of the water disappears quickly as the gas is released from the water.&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Water Resource Authority. http://www.mwra.com/04water/2004/whitewater.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hot water supply==
{{Main|Hot water system}}
Domestic hot water is provided by means of [[water heater]] appliances, or through [[district heating]].  The hot water from these units is then piped to the various fixtures and appliances that require hot water, such as lavatories, sinks, bathtubs, showers, washing machines, and dishwashers.

==Fixtures and appliances==
Everything in a building that uses water falls under one of two categories; fixture or appliance.  As the consumption points above perform their function, most produce waste/sewage components that will require removal by the waste/sewage side of the system.  The minimum is an air gap. See [[cross connection control &amp; backflow prevention]] for an overview of backflow prevention methods and devices currently in use, both through the use of mechanical and physical principles.

Fixtures are devices that use water without an additional source of power.

==Fittings and valves==
{{main|Piping and plumbing fittings}}
Potable water supply systems are composed of [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]]s, [[Piping and plumbing fittings|fittings]] and [[valve]]s.

==Materials==
The installation of water pipes can be done using the following plastic&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anr.gov.pl/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=83e2e56e-1518-4d72-bcfc-210de29a741a&amp;groupId=96805.|title=INSTALACJE WODOCIĄGOWE|last=|first=|date=2003|website=Anr.gov.pl|publisher=|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and metal&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; materials:

===Plastic===
* polybutylene (PB)
* high density cross-linked polyethylene (PE-X)
* block copolymer of polypropylene (PP-B)
* the polypropylene copolymer (PP-H)
* random copolymer of polypropylene (random) (PP-R)
* Layer: cross-linked polyethylene, aluminum, high-density polyethylene (PE-X / Al / PE-HD)
* Layer: polyethylene crosslinked, aluminum, cross-linked polyethylene (PE-X / Al / PE-X)
* Layer copolymer of a random polypropylene, aluminum, polypropylene random copolymer (PP-R / Al / PP-R)
* polyvinyl chloride, chlorinated (PVC-C)
* polyvinyl chloride - not softened(only cold water) (PVC-U)

===Metals===
* carbon steel, ordinary galvanized
* corrosion resistant steel
* copper(Cu-DHP)
* Lead was previously used.

Other materials, if the pipes made from them have been let into circulation and the widespread use in the construction of the water supply systems.

==== Lead pipes ====
For many centuries, water pipes were made of lead, because of its ease of processing and durability. The use of lead pipes was a cause of health problems due to ignorance of the dangers of lead on the human body, which causes miscarriages and high death rates of newborns. Lead pipes, which were installed mostly in the late 1800s in the US, are still common today, much of which are located in the Northeast and the Midwest. Their impact is relatively small due to the fouling of pipes and stone cessation of the evolution of lead in the water; however, lead pipes are still detrimental. Most of the lead pipes that exist today are being removed and replaced with the more common material, copper or some type of plastic.

Remnants of pipes in some languages are the names of the experts involved in the execution, reparation, maintenance, and installation of water supply systems, which have been formed from the Latin word 'lead', English word 'plumber', French word, 'plombier'.

==Regulation and compliance==

===United States===
Before a water supply system is constructed or modified, the designer and contractor need to consult the local plumbing code and obtain a building permit prior to construction.&lt;ref&gt;''Uniform Plumbing Code'', IAPMO&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''International Plumbing Code'', ICC&lt;/ref&gt; Even replacing an existing water heater may require a permit and inspection of the work. The US national standard for potable water piping guidelines is NSF/ANSI 61 certified materials. NSF/ANSI also sets standards for certifying polytanks, though the FDA approves the materials. National and local fire codes should be integrated in the design phase of the water system too to prevent "failure to comply with regulations" notices. Some areas of the [[United States]] require on-site water reserves of potable and fire water by law.

==Wastewater==
{{main|Sewage treatment}}
[[Wastewater]] from various appliances, fixtures, and taps is transferred to the waste and sewage removal system via the [[sewerage|sewage drain]] system to [[sewage treatment|treatment plants]].  This system consists of larger diameter piping, [[backflow preventer|water traps]], and [[Plumbing drainage venting|ventilation]] to prevent toxic gases from entering the living space.

==Water flow reduction==
{{main|Water conservation}}
Water flow through a tap can be reduced by inexpensive small plastic flow reducers.  These restrict flow between 15 and 50%, aiding [[water conservation]] and reducing the burden on both [[water supply]] and [[sewerage treatment|treatment]] facilities.

==Comparison to bottled water==
{{Globalize|section|date=April 2010}}
{{See also|Bottled water#Bottled water versus tap water}}
In modern [[Western society]], levels of contaminants found in tap water vary for every household and plumbing system but tend to be low. Two general conceptions with popular appeal are:
# That tap water is widely contaminated 
# That bottled water is assuredly pure
Both lack scientific support. In reality, both tap water and bottled water are usually safe, although in both cases exceptions can occur. The University of Cincinnati recently completed a Tap Water Quality Analysis, funded by PUR, for major US cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uc.edu/gissa/projects/drinkingwater/ "Tap Water Quality Analysis"]&lt;/ref&gt; Its findings show generally safe [[water quality]] in most regions. While most US cities have what is considered safe tap water, contaminants ranging from bacteria to heavy metals are present in some tap water, and occasionally serious violations of tap water standards have been well-publicized, such as the severe 1993 [[Cryptosporidium]] outbreak in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], which led to several deaths and around 400,000 illnesses (see: [[Milwaukee Cryptosporidium outbreak]]). Regarding bottled water quality perceptions and reality, in 1999, the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] (NRDC) released controversial findings from a 4-year study on bottled water. The results of this study claimed that one-third of the waters tested contained levels of contamination—including synthetic organic chemicals, bacteria, and arsenic—in at least one sample that exceeded allowable limits under either state or bottled water industry standards or guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrdc.org/water/drinking/nbw.asp|title=NRDC: Summary Findings of NRDC's 1999 Bottled Water Report|work=nrdc.org|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the bottled water industry was quick to dispute the claim, saying bottled water is one of the most highly regulated food products under the FDA regulatory authority and that the FDA system worked extremely well when coupled with the International Bottled Water Association's Model Code and unannounced inspections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bottledwater.org/content/key-message-points|title=Key Message Points|work=bottledwater.org|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using tap water (whether straight from the tap or [[water filter|filtered]] first) is generally considered to be better for one's environmental impact than habitually drinking bottled water, because the bottling and distribution of bottled water consumes resources and produces emissions (electricity and oil to make the bottles, [[diesel fuel]] to truck the filled bottles through the supply chain, truck exhaust, powerplant emissions, bottle recycling, and so on). In comparison, the [[water treatment]] plant activities were going to happen anyway in either case, but the other costs and effects are avoided in the tap water case.

Many municipalities in the [[United States]] are making an effort to use tap water over bottled water on government properties and events. However, others voted the idea down, including voters in the state of Washington, who repealed a bottled water tax via citizen initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Washington's Gregoire plans 400 million more in budget cuts|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-12-16/washington-s-gregoire-plans-400-million-more-in-cuts.html|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=December 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Workman, author of the book ''Heart of Dryness: How the Last Bushmen Can Help Us Endure the Coming Age of Permanent Drought'' and co-founder of SmartMarkets says that he doesn't believe that "tap water is bad and bottled water is good".

In [[surveying]], '''[[tape measure|tape]] correction(s)''' refer(s) to correcting measurements for the effect of slope angle, expansion or contraction due to temperature, and the tape's sag, which varies with the applied tension. Not correcting for these effects gives rise to [[systematic error]]s, i.e. effects which act in a predictable manner and therefore can be corrected by mathematical methods.

== Correction due to slope ==
[[File:Diagram of simple slope correction.svg|thumb|right|250px|&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the slope line and the horizontal line, ''s'' is the slope distance measured between two points on the slope line, ''h'' is the height of the slope.]]


&lt;math&gt;C_v =2L*sin^2 + \frac {A}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Where 
           L= Inclined length measured
           A= Inclined angle



When distances are measured along the [[slope]], the equivalent horizontal distance may be determined by applying a slope correction.

The vertical slope angle of the length measured must be measured. (Refer to the figure on the other side) Thus,

:*For gentle slopes, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;20\%&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;C_h = \frac {h^2}{2s}&lt;/math&gt;

:*For steep slopes, &lt;math&gt;20\%\le m \le 30\%&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;C_h = \frac {h^2}{2s} + \frac {h^4}{8s^3}&lt;/math&gt;

:*For very steep slopes, &lt;math&gt;m&gt;30\%&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;C_h = s(1-\cos \theta)&lt;/math&gt;,
::Or, more simply, &lt;math&gt;d = s * \cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:'''&lt;math&gt;C_h&lt;/math&gt;''' is the correction of measured slope distance due to slope;
:'''&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;''' is the angle between the measured slope line and horizontal line;
:'''s''' is the measured slope distance.
:'''d''' is the horizontal distance.

The correction &lt;math&gt;C_h&lt;/math&gt; is subtracted from &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; to obtain the equivalent horizontal distance on the slope line:

:&lt;math&gt;d = s - C_h&lt;/math&gt;

== Correction due to temperature ==
When measuring or laying out distances, the standard [[temperature]] of the tape and the temperature of the tape at time of measurement are usually different. A difference in temperature will cause the tape to lengthen or shorten, so the measurement taken will not be exactly correct. A correction can be applied to the measured length to obtain the correct length.

The correction of the tape length due to change in temperature is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;C_t = C \cdot L (T_m - T_s)&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:&lt;math&gt;C_t&lt;/math&gt; is the correction to be applied to the tape due to temperature;
:'''C''' is the [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] of the metal that forms the tape;
:'''L''' is the length of the tape or length of the line measured.
:&lt;math&gt;T_m&lt;/math&gt; is the observed temperature of the tape at the time of measurement;
:&lt;math&gt;T_s&lt;/math&gt; is the standard temperature, when the tape is at the correct length, often 20&amp;nbsp;°C;

The correction &lt;math&gt;C_t&lt;/math&gt; is added to &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; to obtain the corrected distance:

:&lt;math&gt;d = L + C_t&lt;/math&gt;

For common tape measurements, the tape used is a [[steel tape]] with [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] C equal to 0.000,011,6 units per unit length per degree [[Celsius]] change. This means that the tape changes length by 1.16&amp;nbsp;mm per 10 m tape per 10&amp;nbsp;°C change from the standard temperature of the tape. For a 30 meter long tape with standard temperature of 20&amp;nbsp;°C used at 40&amp;nbsp;°C, the change in length is 7 mm over the length of the tape.

== Correction due to sag ==
A tape not supported along its length will sag and form a [[catenary]] between end supports. The correction due to sag must be calculated separately for each unsupported stretch separately and is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;C_s = \frac {{\omega}^2 L^3}{24P^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:&lt;math&gt;C_s&lt;/math&gt; is the correction applied to the tape due to sag; meters;
:&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the weight of the tape per unit length; newtons per meter;
:'''L''' is the length between the two ends of the catenary; meters;
:'''P''' is the tension or pull applied to the tape; newtons.

A tape held in catenary will record a value larger than the correct measurement. Thus, the correction &lt;math&gt;C_s&lt;/math&gt; is subtracted from &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; to obtain the corrected distance:

:&lt;math&gt;d = L - C_s&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the weight of the tape per unit length is equal to the weight of the tape divided by the length of the tape:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac {W}{L}&lt;/math&gt;

so: &lt;math&gt;W = \omega L&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, we can rewrite the formula for correction due to sag as:

:&lt;math&gt;C_s = \frac {W^2 L}{24 P^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Derivation (sag)===
The general formula for a [[Catenary#Mathematical description|catenary]] formed by a tape supported only at its ends is

:&lt;math&gt;y = \frac{P}{\omega g} \cosh \left(\frac{x \omega g}{P}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Here, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational acceleration. The [[Arc length#Finding arc lengths by integrating|arc length]] between two support points at &lt;math&gt;x=-k/2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x=+k/2&lt;/math&gt; is found by usual methods via integration:

:&lt;math&gt;L = \int_{-k/2}^{+k/2} \sqrt{1+\left(dy/dx\right)^2} \, dx&lt;/math&gt;

For convenience set &lt;math&gt;a=\frac{P}{\omega g}&lt;/math&gt;. The integrand is simplified as follows using [[Hyperbolic function#Useful relations|hyperbolic function identities]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1+\left(dy/dx\right)^2} = \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{d}{dx}\left(a \cosh\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)\right)\right)^2} = \sqrt{1+\sinh^2\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)} = \cosh\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The tape length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is then found by integrating:

:&lt;math&gt;L = \int_{-k/2}^{+k/2} \cosh\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) dx = \left[a \sinh\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)\right]_{x=-k/2}^{x=+k/2} = \left(2a\right) \sinh\left(\frac{k}{2a}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

Now the correction for tape sag is the difference between the actual span between the supports, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, and the arc length of the tape's catenary, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. Call this correction &lt;math&gt;\delta = k - L&lt;/math&gt;. The absolute value of this &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; correction is &lt;math&gt;C_s&lt;/math&gt; above, the amount you would subtract from the tape measurement to get the true span distance.

A [[Taylor series]] expansion of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the quantity &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is desired to give a good first approximation to the correction. In fact, the first nonvanishing term in the Taylor series is cubic in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, and the next nonvanishing term is to the fifth power of L; thus, a series expansion for &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is reasonable. To this end, we need to find an expression for &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; that contains &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; but not &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. We already have an expression for &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, but now need to find the inverse function (for &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{2a} = \sinh\left(\frac{k}{2a}\right) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sinh^{-1}\left(\frac{L}{2a}\right)= \frac{k}{2a} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;k = \left(2a\right) \sinh^{-1}\left(\frac{L}{2a}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\delta = k - L = \left(2a\right) \sinh^{-1}\left(\frac{L}{2a}\right) - L &lt;/math&gt;

Evaluating &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;L=0&lt;/math&gt; yields zero, so there is no zero-order term in the Taylor series. The first derivative of this function with respect to L is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\delta}{dL} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{L^2}{4 a^2}+1}}-1 &lt;/math&gt;.

Evaluated at L=0, it vanishes and so does not contribute a Taylor series term. The second derivative of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2\delta}{{dL}^2} = -\frac{L}{4 a^2 \left(\frac{L^2}{4 a^2}+1\right)^{3/2}} &lt;/math&gt;.

Again, when evaluated at L=0 it vanishes. When evaluated at L=0, the third derivative survives, however.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^3\delta}{{dL}^3} = -\frac{ \left(8 a^3-4\text{aL}^2\right)}{\left(4 a^2+L^2\right)^{5/2} } &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the first surviving term in the Taylor series is:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta \cong \left[\frac{d^3\delta}{{dL}^3}\right]_{L=0} \frac{ L^3}{3!} = -\frac{1}{4a^2} \frac{L^3}{6} = \frac{-L^3}{24a^2} = \frac{-L^3 \omega^2 g^2}{24 P^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the variable &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; here is the tension on the cable, whereas above, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the mass whose gravitational force (mass times gravitational acceleration) equals the tension on the cable. The only conversion necessary then is to take &lt;math&gt;P/g&lt;/math&gt; here and equate it to &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; above. Also, this formula is the tape sag correction to be added to the measured distance, so the negative sign in front can be removed and the tape sag correction can be made instead by subtracting the absolute value as is done in the preceding section.

=== Correction due to tension ===
Some tapes are already calibrated to account for the sag at a standard tension.{{cn|date=September 2016}} In this case, errors arise when the tape is pulled at a [[Tension (physics)|Tension]] which differs from the standard tension used at standardization. The tape will stretch less than its standard length when a tension less than the standard tension is applied, making the tape too short.

A tape stretches in an elastic manner until it reaches its [[Yield (engineering)|elastic limit]], when it will deform permanently and ruin the tape.

The correction due to tension is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;C_p = \frac{(P_m - P_s)L}{AE}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:&lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt; is the elongation in tape length due to pull; or the correction to be applied due to applying a tension which differs from standard tension; meters;
:&lt;math&gt;P_m&lt;/math&gt; is the tension applied to the tape during measurement; newtons;
:&lt;math&gt;P_s&lt;/math&gt; is the standard tension, when the tape is the correct length, often 50 newtons; newtons;
:'''L''' is the measured or erroneous length of the line; meters
:'''A''' is the cross-sectional area of the tape; square centimeters;
:'''E''' is the [[Elastic modulus|modulus of elasticity]] of the tape material; newtons per square centimeter;

The correction &lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt; is added to &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; to obtain the corrected distance:

:&lt;math&gt;d = L + C_p&lt;/math&gt;

The value for A is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac {W}{(L)(U_w)}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:'''W''' is the total weight of the tape; kilograms;
:&lt;math&gt;U_w&lt;/math&gt; is the unit weight of the tape; kilograms per cubic centimeter.

For steel tapes, the value for &lt;math&gt;U_w&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;7.866 \times 10^{-3} kg/cm^3&lt;/math&gt;.

==Correction due to incorrect tape length==
Manufacturers of measuring tapes do not usually guarantee the exact length of tapes, and [[standardization]] is a process where a standard temperature and tension are determined at which the tape is the exact length. The nominal length of tapes can be affected by physical imperfections, stretching or wear. Constant use of tapes cause wear, tapes can become kinked and may be improperly repaired when breaks occur.

The correction due to tape length is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;C_L = Corr \times M_L &lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:'''C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the corrected length of the line to be measured or laid out;
:'''M&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the measured length or length to be laid out;
:'''N&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the nominal length of the tape as specified by its mark;
:'''K&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''' is a known length;
:'''Corr''' is the ratio of measured to actual length &lt;math&gt;\frac {M_L}{K_L}&lt;/math&gt;, determined by measuring a known length. 

In the U.S., some tapes come with [[United States Bureau of Standards]] certifications establishing the correction needed per 100' of tape.

Note that incorrect tape length introduces a systematic error that must be calibrated periodically.

The '''taxome''' is the sum of all the described [[species]] and higher groups such as [[genus|genera]], [[family (biology)|families]], [[phylum|phyla]] of all life, or the sum of all valid [[taxa]].  The documenting of all this [[biodiversity]] is still very incomplete.

Many organisms have already been documented (it is guessed that around 1-2 million species have been described &amp;mdash; see Species Inventory in [[biodiversity]] article), but probably around nine-tenths of existing species have never been described, and those that have been described may have been redescribed, many times, under different names.  Thus, the state of the science of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] (the systematic organization of life) is somewhat confused.

The system of Linnean nomenclature (named after the 18th century [[Swedish people|Swedish]] pioneer [[Carl Linnaeus]]) is such that, in principle, the correct scientific name of all organisms described could be adjudicated, by means of historical priority.  However, the names of many organisms are published in such obscure books and journals that very little of this information is available to most people.  Thus, not only do we have little idea how many species there are, but we are even ignorant of the number of supposedly known species that have been described.

However, the situation is not as bad as it is sometimes painted.  The sum total of all existing taxonomic and nomenclatural documentation of living things is not large by today's data-rich standards.  We know where the books and journals are where species might have been described.  We simply need to put in the work to make the text and graphics of species descriptions available in [[database]]s, particularly electronic databases.  In many groups, species are poorly known, but it is now rare to discover a major undetected phylum or family, so coverage of the kinds of diversity of life is probably good, even if all species are not described.  Most of the undiscovered groups are probably reasonably closely related to something we have described.  Thus if we could document the existing knowledge, we would have a useful, albeit somewhat pixellated map of the diversity of life.

Just as a sequenced [[genome]] of an organism is a map of its [[DNA]], a database documenting the complete taxome would form a map of the described biodiversity of the entire planet.  Existing projects are mapping the positions of moons, planets and stars in the universe, as well as the physical geography of our own planet, and the genomes of selected organisms.  Projects are now being set up to take advantage of information technology to document and make available the entire body of taxonomy on line.  When this information becomes more complete, it should be possible to link this taxome information to all other information about biology.

'''''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism''''' ({{lang-de|Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus}}) is a book written by [[Max Weber]], a German [[sociologist]], economist, and politician. Begun as a series of essays, the original German text was composed in 1904 and 1905, and was translated into English for the first time by American sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]] in 1930.&lt;ref name="WeberBaehr2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Max Weber|author2=Peter R.

In the book, Weber wrote that capitalism in [[Northern Europe]] evolved when the [[Protestant]] (particularly [[Calvinism|Calvinist]]) ethic influenced large numbers of people to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own [[Organization|enterprise]]s and engaging in trade and the accumulation of wealth for investment. In other words, the [[Protestant work ethic]] was an important force behind the unplanned and uncoordinated emergence of modern [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name="aura.abdn.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McKinnon | first1 = AM | year = 2010 | title = Elective affinities of the Protestant ethic: Weber and the chemistry of capitalism | url = http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3035/1/McKinnon_Elective_Affinities_final_non_format.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Sociological Theory | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 108–126 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9558.2009.01367.x| hdl = 2164/3035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, apart from Calvinists, Weber also discusses [[Lutherans]] (especially [[Pietists]], but also notes differences between traditional Lutherans and Calvinists), [[Methodists]], [[Baptists]], [[Quakers]], and [[Moravians]] (specifically referring to the [[Herrnhut]]-based community under [[Count von Zinzendorf]]'s spiritual lead).

==Summary==

===Basic concepts===
Although not a detailed study of Protestantism but rather an introduction to Weber's later studies of interaction between various religious ideas and economics (''[[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism]],'' ''[[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism]],'' and ''[[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]]),'' ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'' argues that [[Puritan]] [[ethic]]s and [[idea]]s influenced the development of capitalism. The 'spirit of capitalism' does not refer to the spirit in the metaphysical sense but rather a set of values, the spirit of hard work and progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Michael Shea |url=http://discoversociety.org/2015/10/06/the-protestant-ethic-and-the-language-of-austerity/ |title=The Protestant Ethic and the Language of Austerity |date=6 October 2015 |publisher=[[Discover Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious devotion, Weber argues, is usually accompanied by a rejection of worldly affairs, including the pursuit of wealth and possessions. To illustrate his theory, Weber quotes the ethical writings of [[Benjamin Franklin]]:

{{quote|sign=|source=|Remember, that ''time is money''.  He that can earn ten shillings a day by his labor, and goes abroad, or sits idle, one half of that day, though he spends but sixpence during his diversion or idleness, ought not to reckon ''that'' the only expense; he has really spent, or rather thrown away, five shillings besides. [...] Remember, that money is the ''prolific, generating nature''. Money can beget money, and its offspring can beget more, and so on. Five shillings turned is six, turned again is seven and threepence, and so on, till it becomes a hundred pounds. The more there is of it, the more it produces every turning, so that the profits rise quicker and quicker. He that kills a breeding feline taint, destroys all her offspring to the thousandth generation. He that murders a crown, destroys all that it might have produced, even scores of pounds.}}

Weber notes that this is not a philosophy of mere greed, but a statement laden with moral language. Indeed, Franklin claims that God revealed the usefulness of virtue to him.&lt;ref name="protestant"&gt;Weber, Max "The Protestant Ethic and The Spirit of Capitalism" (Penguin Books, 2002) translated by Peter Baehr and Gordon C. Wells&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9–12}}

The Reformation profoundly affected the view of work, dignifying even the most mundane professions as adding to the common good and thus blessed by God, as much as any "sacred" calling (German: ''Ruf''). A common illustration is that of a cobbler, hunched over his work, who devotes his entire effort to the praise of God.

To emphasize the [[work ethic]] in Protestantism relative to Catholics, he notes a common problem that industrialists face when employing precapitalist laborers: Agricultural entrepreneurs will try to encourage time spent harvesting by offering a higher wage, with the expectation that laborers will see time spent working as more valuable and so engage it longer. However, in precapitalist societies this often results in laborers spending ''less'' time harvesting. Laborers judge that they can earn the same, while spending less time working and having more leisure. He also notes that societies having more Protestants are those that have a more developed capitalist economy.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|15–16}}

It is particularly advantageous in technical occupations for workers to be extremely devoted to their craft.  To view the craft as an end in itself, or as a "calling" would serve this need well. This attitude is well-noted in certain classes which have endured religious education, especially of a [[Pietist]] background.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|17}}

He defines spirit of capitalism as the ideas and ''esprit'' that favour the [[Rationalization (sociology)|rational]] pursuit of [[Wealth|economic gain]]: "We shall nevertheless provisionally use the expression 'spirit of capitalism' for that attitude which, ''in the pursuit of a calling [berufsmäßig]'', strives systematically for profit for its own sake in the manner exemplified by Benjamin Franklin."&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|19}}

Weber points out that such a [[spirit]] is not limited to [[Western culture]] if one considers it as the attitude of [[Person|individual]]s, but that such individuals – heroic entrepreneurs, as he calls them – could not by themselves establish a new economic order (capitalism).&lt;ref name="Bendix77"&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'',  University of California Press, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|54–55}} He further noted that the spirit of capitalism could be divorced from religion, and that those passionate capitalists of his era were either passionate against the Church or at least indifferent to it.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|23}} Desire for profit with minimum effort and seeing work as a burden to be avoided, and doing no more than what was enough for modest life, were common attitudes.&lt;ref name="Bendix77" /&gt;{{rp|55}} As he wrote in his essays:

:{{quote|In order that a manner of life well adapted to the peculiarities of the capitalism… could come to dominate others, it had to originate somewhere, and not in isolated individuals alone, but as a way of life common to the whole groups of man.}}

After defining the "spirit of capitalism," Weber argues that there are many reasons to find its origins in the religious ideas of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. Many others like [[William Petty]], [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], [[Henry Thomas Buckle]], [[John Keats]] have noted the [[Affinity (sociology)|affinity]] between Protestantism and the development of [[commercialism]].&lt;ref name="Bendix54"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bendix |title=Max Weber |url=|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber shows that certain branches of Protestantism had supported worldly activities dedicated to economic gain, seeing them as endowed with moral and spiritual significance. This recognition was not a goal in itself; rather they were a byproduct of other doctrines of faith that encouraged planning, hard work and self-denial in the pursuit of worldly riches.&lt;ref name="Bendix77" /&gt;{{rp|57}}

===Origins of the Protestant work ethic===

Weber traced the origins of the Protestant ethic to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], though he acknowledged some respect for secular everyday labor as early as the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|28}} The Roman Catholic Church assured salvation to individuals who accepted the church's sacraments and submitted to the clerical authority. However, the Reformation had effectively removed such assurances. From a [[psychological]] viewpoint, the average person had difficulty adjusting to this new worldview, and only the most devout believers or "religious geniuses" within Protestantism, such as [[Martin Luther]], were able to make this adjustment, according to Weber.

In the absence of such assurances from religious authority, Weber argued that Protestants began to look for other "signs" that they were saved. Calvin and his followers taught a doctrine of [[Predestination|double predestination]], in which from the beginning God chose some people for salvation and others for damnation. The inability to influence one's own salvation presented a very difficult problem for Calvin's followers. It became an absolute duty to believe that one was chosen for salvation, and to dispel any doubt about that: lack of self-confidence was evidence of insufficient faith and a sign of damnation. So, self-confidence took the place of priestly assurance of God's grace.

Worldly success became one measure of that self-confidence. Luther made an early endorsement of Europe's emerging divisions. Weber identifies the applicability of Luther's conclusions, noting that a "vocation" from God was no longer limited to the clergy or church, but applied to any occupation or trade. Weber had always detested Lutheranism for the servility it inspired toward the bureaucratic state. When he discussed it in the ''Protestant Ethic'', he used Lutheranism as the chief example of the ''[[unio mystica]]'' that contrasted sharply with the ascetic posture. Later he would associate "Luther, the symbolic exponent of [[bureaucratic despotism]], with the ascetic hostility to [[Eros]] — an example of Weber's sporadic tendency to link together bureaucratic and ascetic modes of life and to oppose both from mystical and aristocratic perspectives."&lt;ref name="Mitzman1970"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Mitzman|title=The Iron Cage: An Historical Interpretation of Max Weber|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mayilngcerQC&amp;pg=PA218|accessdate=15 September 2013|year=1970|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-3745-3|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Weber saw the fulfillment of the Protestant ethic not in [[Lutheranism]], which was too concerned with the reception of divine spirit in the soul, but in [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] forms of Christianity.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|32–33}} The trend was carried further still in Pietism.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|90}} The [[Baptists]] diluted the concept of the calling relative to Calvinists, but other aspects made its congregants fertile soil for the development of capitalism—namely, a lack of paralyzing ascetism, the refusal to accept state office and thereby develop ''un''politically, and the doctrine of control by conscience which caused rigorous honesty.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|102–104}}

What Weber argued, in simple terms:
* According to the new Protestant religions, an individual was religiously compelled to follow a secular vocation (German: ''Beruf'') with as much zeal as possible. A person living according to this world view was more likely to accumulate money.
* The new religions (in particular, Calvinism and other more austere Protestant sects) effectively forbade wastefully ''using'' hard earned money and identified the purchase of luxuries as a [[sin]]. Donations to an individual's church or congregation were limited due to the rejection by certain Protestant sects of [[icon]]s. Finally, donation of money to the poor or to [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] was generally frowned on as it was seen as furthering beggary. This social condition was perceived as laziness, burdening their fellow man, and an affront to God; by not working, one failed to glorify God.

The manner in which this paradox was resolved, Weber argued, was the investment of this money, which gave an extreme boost to [[Primitive accumulation|nascent capitalism]].

===The Protestant work ethic in Weber's time===

By the time Weber wrote his essay, he believed that the religious underpinnings of the Protestant ethic had largely gone from society. He cited the writings of [[Benjamin Franklin]], which emphasized frugality, hard work and thrift, but were mostly free of spiritual content. Weber also attributed the success of mass production partly to the Protestant ethic. Only after expensive luxuries were disdained could individuals accept the uniform products, such as clothes and furniture, that industrialization offered.

In his remarkably prescient conclusion to the book, Weber lamented that the loss of religious underpinning to capitalism's spirit has led to a kind of involuntary servitude to mechanized industry.

{{quote|The Puritan wanted to work in calling; we are forced to do so.  For when asceticism was carried out of monastic cells into everyday life, and began to dominate worldly morality, it did its part in building the tremendous cosmos of the modern economic order.  This order is now bound to the technical and economic conditions of machine production which today determine the lives of all the individuals who are born into this mechanism, not only those directly concerned with economic acquisition, with irresistible force.  Perhaps it will so determine them until the last ton of fossilized coal is burnt. In Baxter’s view the care for external goods should only lie on the shoulders of the 'saint like a light cloak, which can be thrown aside at any moment.' But fate decreed that the cloak should become an iron cage. (Page 181, 1953 Scribner's edition.)}}

Weber maintained that while Puritan religious ideas had significantly impacted the development of economic system in Europe and United States, there were other factors in play, as well. They included a closer relationship between mathematics and [[observation]], the enhanced value of scholarship, rational systematization of government administration, and an increase in entrepreneurship ventures. In the end, the study of Protestant ethic, according to Weber, investigated a part of the detachment from [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], that ''disenchantment of the world'' that could be seen as a unique characteristic of [[Western culture]].&lt;ref name="Bendix77" /&gt;{{rp|60}}

===Conclusions===

In the final endnotes Weber states that he abandoned research into Protestantism because his colleague [[Ernst Troeltsch]], a professional [[theology|theologian]], had begun work on ''The Social Teachings of the Christian Churches and Sects''. Another reason for Weber's decision was that Troeltsch's work already achieved what he desired in that area, which is laying groundwork for comparative analysis of religion and society. Weber moved beyond Protestantism with his research but would continue research into [[sociology of religion]] within his later works (the study of [[Ancient Judaism (book)|Judaism]] and the religions of [[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism|China]] and [[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Budhism|India]]).&lt;ref name="Bendix77"/&gt;{{rp|49}}

This book is also Weber's first brush with the concept of [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]]. His idea of modern capitalism as growing out of the religious pursuit of wealth meant a change to a rational means of existence, wealth. That is to say, at some point the Calvinist rationale informing the "spirit" of capitalism became unreliant on the underlying religious movement behind it, leaving only rational capitalism. In essence then, Weber's "Spirit of Capitalism" is effectively and more broadly a Spirit of Rationalization.

==Reception==
The essay can also be interpreted as one of Weber's criticisms of [[Karl Marx]] and his theories. While Marx's [[historical materialism]] held that all human institutions – including religion – were based on economic foundations, many have seen ''The Protestant Ethic'' as turning this theory on its head by implying that a religious movement fostered capitalism, not the other way around.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

Other scholars have taken a more nuanced view of Weber's argument. Weber states in the closing of this essay, "it is, of course, not my aim to substitute for a one-sided materialistic an equally one-sided spiritualistic causal interpretation of culture and history. Each is equally possible, but each if it does not serve as the preparation, but as the conclusion of an investigation, accomplishes equally little in the interest of historical truth." Weber's argument can be understood as an attempt to deepen the understanding of the cultural origins of capitalism, which does not exclude the historical materialist origins described by Marx: modern capitalism emerged from an elective affinity of 'material; and 'ideal' factors.&lt;ref name="aura.abdn.ac.uk"/&gt;

==Criticisms==

===Economic criticism===
The economist and historian [[Henryk Grossman]] criticises Weber's analysis on two fronts, firstly with reference to [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s extensive work which showed that the stringent legal measures taken against poverty and vagabondage was a reaction to the massive population shifts caused by the [[enclosure]] of the [[commons]] in England.  And, secondly, in Grossman's own work showing how this "bloody legislation" against those who had been put off their land was effected across Europe and especially in France.  For Grossman this legislation, the outlawing of [[idleness]] and the [[poorhouses]] they instituted physically forced people from [[serfdom]] into [[wage-labor]].  For him, this general fact was not related to Protestantism and so capitalism came largely by force and not by any vocational training regarding an inner-worldliness of Protestantism.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Henryk (2006) ‘The Beginnings of Capitalism and the New Mass Morality’ Journal of Classical Sociology 6 (2): July&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible that the Protestant "work ethic" reinforced or legitimized these legal measures within a larger cultural context.

In a paper published on 10 November 2009, Harvard economist Davide Cantoni tested Weber's Protestant hypothesis using population and economic growth in second-millennium Germany as the data set, with negative results. Cantoni writes:

{{quote|Using population figures in a dataset comprising 276 cities in the years 1300–1900, I find no effects of Protestantism on economic growth. The finding is robust to the inclusion of a variety of controls, and does not appear to depend on data selection or small sample size. In addition, Protestantism has no effect when interacted with other likely determinants of economic development. I also analyze the endogeneity of religious choice; instrumental variables estimates of the effects of Protestantism are similar to the OLS results.&lt;ref&gt;David Cantoni, "The Economic Effects of the Protestant Reformation: Testing the Weber Hypothesis in the German Lands," November 2009, {{cite web |url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~cantoni/papers.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205143318/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~cantoni/papers.html |archivedate=5 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, Cantoni uses city size, and not relative real wage growth, which was the Weber thesis, as his "main dependent variable" (Cantoni, 2).

Other recent scholarship continues to find valid Protestant Ethic effects both in historical and contemporary development patterns.

Dudley and Blum write:
{{quote|Evidence of falling wages in Catholic cities and rising wages in Protestant cities between 1500 and 1750, during the spread of literacy in the vernacular, is inconsistent with most theoretical models of economic growth. In The Protestant Ethic, Weber suggested an alternative explanation based on culture. Here, a theoretical model confirms that a small change in the subjective cost of cooperating with strangers can generate a profound transformation in trading networks. In explaining urban growth in early-modern Europe, specifications compatible with human-capital versions of the neoclassical model and endogenous-growth theory are rejected in favor of a "small-world" formulation based on the Weber thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.sceco.umontreal.ca/publications/etext/2001-05.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030807123042/http://www.sceco.umontreal.ca/publications/etext/2001-05.pdf |archivedate=2003-08-07  |title=Religion and Economic Growth: Was Weber Right? |first1=Ulrich |last1=Blum |first2=Leonard |last2=Dudley |date=February 2001 |journal=Journal of Evolutionary Economics |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=207–230}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Revisionist criticism===
H. M. Robertson, in his book ''Aspects of Economic Individualism'', argued against the historical and religious claims of Weber. Robertson points out that capitalism began to flourish not in Britain, but in 14th century Italy, a decidedly different epoch. Since this is true, then the rise of capitalism cannot be attributed to [[Adam Smith]], the Protestant Reformation, etc. In fact, Robertson goes further, and states that what happened in Britain was rather a retrogression from what was achieved in Italy centuries earlier.

Looking at the history of the development of economic thought, Robertson shows that Adam Smith and [[David Ricardo]] did not found economic science ''de novo''. In fact, liberal economic theory was developed by French and Italian Catholics, who were influenced by the [[Scholastics]]. The British economic thought was rather a step backwards since it espoused the [[Labor Theory of Value]], which had already been proved incorrect by the [[School of Salamanca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard56.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313191910/http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard56.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-03-13 |title=Catholicism, Protestantism, and Capitalism |first=Murray N. |last=Rothbard |author-link=Murray Rothbard |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |date=February 1957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other criticism===
It has recently been suggested that Protestantism has indeed influenced positively the capitalist development of respective social systems not so much through the "Protestant ethics" but rather through the promotion of literacy.&lt;ref name="urss.ru"&gt;[[Korotayev]] A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D. (2006), ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics'', Moscow: URSS, {{ISBN|5-484-00414-4}} [http://urss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?cp=&amp;lang=en&amp;blang=en&amp;list=14&amp;page=Book&amp;id=34250] ([http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=187&amp;Itemid=70 Chapter 6: Reconsidering Weber: Literacy and "the Spirit of Capitalism"]). P.87-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Becker and Wossmann at the University of Munich,&lt;ref name="epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de"&gt;Becker, Sascha O. and Wossmann, Ludger. "Was Weber Wrong? A Human Capital Theory of Protestant Economics History." Munich Discussion Paper No. 2007-7, 22 January 2007. http://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/1366/1/weberLMU.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Andrey Korotayev]] and [[Daria Khaltourina]] at the Russian Academy of Sciences,&lt;ref name="urss.ru"/&gt; showed that literacy levels differing in religious areas can sufficiently explain the economic gaps cited by Weber. The results were supported even under a concentric diffusion model of Protestantism using distance from Wittenberg as a model.&lt;ref name="epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de"/&gt;

==Support==

In 1958, American sociologist [[Gerhard Lenski]] conducted an empirical inquiry into "religion's impact on politics, economics, and family life" in the [[Detroit]], Mich., area. It revealed, among other insights, that there were significant differences between Catholics on the one hand and (white) Protestants and Jews on the other hand with respect to economics and the sciences. Lenski's data supported basic hypotheses of Weber's work ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism''. According to Lenski, "the contribution of Protestantism to material progress have been largely unintended by-products of certain distinctive Protestant traits. This was a central point in Weber's theory." Lenski noted that more than a hundred years prior to Weber, [[John Wesley]], one of the founders of the [[Methodism|Methodist]] church, had observed that "diligence and frugality" made Methodists wealthy. "In an early era, Protestant asceticism and dedication to work, as noted both by Wesley and Weber, seem to have been important patterns of action contributing to economic progress. Both facilitated the accumulation of capital, so critically important to the economic growth and development of nations."&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Lenski (1963), ''The Religious Factor: A Sociological Study of Religion's Impact on Politics, Economics. and Family Life'', Revised Edition, Garden City, N.Y., pp. 350-352&lt;/ref&gt;

German theologian Friedrich Wilhelm Graf notes: "Sociologists of religion like [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[David Martin (sociologist)|David Martin]] have interpreted the Protestant revolution in [[Latin America]] as implicit support of basic elements of Weber's thesis. [...] At any rate, many pious persons there interpret their transition from the Roman Catholic church to Protestant [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] congregations in terms of a moral idea that promises long-term economic gains through strong innerworldly asceticism. The strict ascetic self-discipline that has been successfully institutionalized in the Pentecostal congregations, the readiness to work more and with greater effort and to take less leisurely attitudes lead many Pentecostal Christians to believe that their new faith in God is supported by their economic successes."&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Wilhelm Graf (2010), ''Der Protestantismus. Geschichte und Gegenwart'', Second, Revised Edition, Munich (Germany), pp. 116-117&lt;/ref&gt;

''' ''The Province of Jurisprudence Determined'' ''' is a book written by [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]], first published in 1832, in which he sets out his theory of law generally known as the 'command theory'. Austin believed that the science of general jurisprudence consisted in the clarification and arrangement of fundamental legal notions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Province of Jurisprudence Determined  |last= Austin  |first= John |authorlink= John Austin (legal philosopher) |editor = |year= 1832 |publisher= John Murray |location=London |edition= |volume= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= https://archive.org/stream/provincejurispr02austgoog#page/n5/mode/2up |accessdate=2012-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His object in this book is to identify the distinguishing characteristics of positive law to free it from the precepts of religion and morality. The book consists of six lectures designed to be delivered in a law school setting. Although his theory did not receive significant attention in the 19th Century, it has since become central to the jurisprudential canon, and has been criticised, adapted and enlarged upon by subsequent jurists such as [[H. L. A. Hart]] and [[Ronald Dworkin]].

Austin was a student of [[Jeremy Bentham]], and as such subscribed to [[Utilitarianism]]. He adopted this perspective in his understanding of law, and argued that all laws should work toward promoting the greatest good for the greatest number of people.

According to Austin, a law is 'a rule laid down for the guidance of an intelligent being by an intelligent being having power over him.' This was what Austin defined as positive law. Austin believed that positive law was the appropriate focus of study for jurisprudence. He states that:

{{Quote|text='Every positive law, or every law simply and strictly so called, is set, directly or circuitously, by a sovereign person or body, to a member or members of the independent political society wherein that person or body is supreme.'}}

According to Austin, the sovereign could not be legally limited, 'supreme power limited by positive law is a flat contradiction in terms' he states. However, he did concede that a sovereign may be limited in a non-legal sense by 'popular opinion'.

He defined divine law as 'law set by God to his human creatures'. Although he contends that God's (law) is above and beyond human law, he also states that:

{{Quote|text='To say that human laws which conflict with the Divine law are not binding, that is to say, are not law, is to talk stark nonsense.' He emphasises that a law set by a sovereign to a subject is not negated by any apparent conflicting divine or moral law.'}}

'''Transculturation''' is a term coined by Cuban anthropologist [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]] in 1947&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/s/a/sam50/readings521/ORTIZ_Counter-Engl.pdf Ortiz 1995], pp. v, 97&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the phenomenon of merging and converging cultures.

Transculturation encompasses more than transition from one culture to another; it does not consist merely of acquiring another culture (acculturation) or of losing or uprooting a previous culture (deculturation).  Rather, it merges these concepts and additionally carries the idea of the consequent creation of new cultural phenomena (neoculturation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ortiz|1995|pp=102–103|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/s/a/sam50/readings521/ORTIZ_Counter-Engl.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ortiz also referred to the devastating impact of Spanish colonialism on Cuba's indigenous peoples as a "failed transculturation". Transculturation can often be the result of colonial conquest and subjugation, especially in a postcolonial era as native peoples struggle to regain their own sense of identity.

In simple terms, transculturation reflects the natural tendency of people (in general) to resolve conflicts over time, rather than exacerbating them.  (In the modern context, both conflicts and resolutions are amplified by communication and transportation technology—the ancient tendency of cultures drifting or remaining apart has been replaced by stronger forces for bringing societies together.) Where transculturation impacts ethnicity and ethnic issues the term "ethnoconvergence" is sometimes used.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In one general sense, transculturation covers [[war]], [[ethnic conflict]], [[racism]], [[multiculturalism]], [[cross-culturalism]], [[interracial marriage]], and any other of a number of contexts that deal with more than one culture.  In the other general sense, transculturation is one aspect of global phenomena and human events.

The general processes of transculturation are extremely complex—steered by powerful forces at the macrosocial level, yet ultimately resolved at the interpersonal level. The driving force for conflict is simple [[Proxemics|proximity]]—boundaries, once separating people (providing for a measure of isolation) become the issue of a conflict when societies encroach upon one another territorially.  If a means to co-exist cannot be immediately found, then conflicts can be hostile, leading to a process by which contact between individuals leads to some resolution. Often, history shows us, the processes of co-existence begins with hostilities, and with the natural passing of polarist individuals, comes the passing of their polarist sentiments, and soon some resolution is achieved.  Degrees of hostile conflict vary from outright genocidal conquest, to lukewarm infighting between differing political views within the same ethnic community.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

These changes often represent differences between homeland pons, and their [[diasporic]] communities abroad. Nevertheless, obstacles to '''ethnoconvergence''' are not great. The primary issue; [[language]], (''hence, communication and education'') can be overcome within a single generation—as is evident in the easy acclimation of children of foreign parents.  English, for example, is spoken by more non-Anglo-American people than Anglo-Americans, making it the current [[lingua-franca]], the worldwide de facto standard international language.

Processes of transculturation become more complex within the context of [[globalization]], given the multiple layers of abstraction that permeate everyday experiences. Elizabeth Kath argues that in the global era we can no longer consider transculturation only in relation to the face-to-face, but that we need to take into account the many layers of abstracted interactions that are interwoven through face-to-face encounters, a phenomenon that she describes as ''layers of transculturation''.&lt;ref&gt;Kath, Elizabeth (2015) [http://www.rowmaninternational.com/books/narratives-of-globalization "On Transculturation: Re-enacting and Remaking Latin Dance and Music in Foreign Lands"] In Julian Lee (Ed) ''Narratives of Globalization: Reflections on the Global Condition.''  Rowman &amp; Littlefield International&lt;/ref&gt; Kath draws upon the concept of constitutive abstraction as seen in the work of Australian social theorists Geoff Sharp&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Geoff (1993) "Extended Forms of the Social", ''Arena,'' 1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]].&lt;ref&gt;James, Paul (1996) ''Nation Formation: Towards a Theory of Abstract Community,'' SAGE&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Emotional Ambivalence Across Times and Spaces: Mapping Petrarch's Intersecting Worlds|last = James|first = Paul|date = 2014|journal = Exemplaria|volume = 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homogenization versus ethnoconvergence==

It has been observed that even in monolingual, industrial societies like urban North America, some individuals do cling to a "modernized" primordial identity, apart from others. Some intellectuals, such as [[Michael Ignatieff]], argue that convergence of a general culture does not directly entail a similar convergence in [[ethnic]] identities. This can become evident in social situations, where people divide into separate groups, despite being of an identical "super-ethnicity", such as [[nationality]].

Within each smaller ethnicity, individuals may tend to see it perfectly justified to assimilate with other cultures, and some others view assimilation as wrong and incorrect for their culture. This common theme, representing dualist opinions of ethnoconvergence itself, within a single ethnic group is often manifested in issues of [[sexual partner]]s and [[marriage]], employment preferences, etc. These varied opinions of ethnoconvergence represent themselves in a spectrum; [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]], [[wikt:homogeneous|homogenization]], [[acculturation]], and [[cultural compromise]] are commonly used terms for ethnoconvegence which flavor the issues to a bias.

Often it's in a secular, multi-ethnic environment that cultural concerns are both minimised and exacerbated; Ethnic prides are boasted, hierarchy is created ("center" culture versus "periphery") but on the other hand, they will still share a common "culture", and common language and behaviours. Often the elderly, more conservative-in-association of a clan, tend to reject cross-cultural associations, and participate in ethnically similar community-oriented activities. [[Xenophobia|Xenophobes]] tend to think of cross-cultural contact as a component of assimilation, and see this as harmful.

==Obstacles to ethnoconvergence==

The obstacle to ethnoconvergence is [[ethnocentrism]], which is the view that one's culture is of greater importance than another's. Ethnocentrism often takes different forms, as it is a highly personal bias, and manifests itself in countless aspects of culture. [[Religion]], or belief, is the prime ethnocentric divider. Second is [[convention (norm)|custom]], which may overlap religion. With the adherence to each distinct component, comes the repulsion of the other. In most regions, ethnic divides are binary, meaning only two distinct cultures are present, each seeing the other as foreign. Many, however make the point that the binary example is the exception, and the norm is far more dynamic.

Ethnicity can be divided into two distinct areas, as they relate to ethnoconvergence:  Utilitarian traits, and traditional customs.

Religion, on the other hand, is a highly personal and attached part of culture. However, religion does not neatly correspond with ethnic identity. In many [[Multicultural|cosmopolitan]] societies, religion is everything—social, utilitarian, intellectual, political; from the point of view of people of immersed cultures; The very concept of ethnicity and its distinctions is incongruous to their immersed concepts.

In many societies, such as in those in Europe, languages are considered a significant component of ethnic values. This does not mean that most Europeans reject learning other languages. Quite the contrary, Europeans are often polyglots, and may label other individuals by their ethnicities; practical means of distinguishing cultures may resemble tendencies similar to ethnocentrism.

However, the political and cultural significance of regional or national languages are retained because these polyglots conform to the linguistic norms of the place they visit—doing "as the Romans do". Thus, conforming to the "ethnic integrity" of the region.

It has even become a cliché that "to learn a new language is to adopt a new soul". There are many other examples of the essential significance of language. In pre-[[Russia]]n [[Siberia]], [[Siberian Tatars|Tatar-Mongol]] colonists in the [[Taiga]] often recognized indigenous speakers of [[Turkic languages]] as their "own people" and non-Turkic groups as "foreigners", despite these indigenous groups having a similar level of material culture, and sharing much of a primitive culture with tribes foreign to the Muslim-Buddhist Tatar-Mongols.

==Transcultural communications==

In October 2011, U.S. communications agency [[Bromley Originate Change|Bromley]] launched a new model/[[strategy]] utilizing transcultural [[sociological]] theory as a means to segment and 'make sense' of the changing [[United States|American]] cultural landscape. Returning to classic social science as a solution, [[Bromley Originate Change|Bromley]] has embraced the anthropological approach put forward by thinkers like [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]] as a way to account for ethnicity and language without being limited by them as a way for viewing the world.

'''Rosalind Mary Owens''' (born 12 November 1944), known as '''Tuppy Owens''', is an English sex therapist, consultant, campaigner, writer and former adult model.&lt;ref name=sexis1118103/&gt;&lt;ref name=theskinny20080617/&gt;&lt;ref name="highbeam.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18669012.html|title=BBC under fire for porn star's Viagra love-making|date=19 August 1998|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Tuppy Owens was born in [[Cambridge]]. She gained a degree in [[zoology]] from [[Exeter University]], and then worked in [[ecology]] in [[Africa]] and [[Trinidad]].&lt;ref name=sexis1118103/&gt; She settled in [[London]], and worked as a scientific administrator at the [[Natural Environment Research Council]].&lt;ref name=observer19720924/&gt; Then, in the late 1960s, she established a sex education book publishing company, for which she wrote and published ''The Sex Maniac’s Diary''&lt;ref name=paulharris/&gt; successfully between 1972 and 1995, and which she operated as a thriving business from her [[Mayfair]] flat&lt;ref name=observer19720924/&gt; — for example, the 1975 ''Sex Maniac's Diary'' was launched in August 1974 with a reception at the Bristol Hotel in London which was reported on the following day in the [[Financial Times]].&lt;ref name=ft19740822/&gt;

==Work==

From 1974, Tuppy Owens also began lecturing on the subject of sex.&lt;ref name=es19740409/&gt;  In 1975, she appeared in the Dutch pornographic film ''Sensations''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pre-cert.co.uk/display.php?vId=UK13009|title=Sensations (1975) on Video Blue|website=Pre-Certification Video}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1984, the ''Sex Maniac's Diary'' was published as ''The Safer Sex Maniac's Diary'' and provided the first visual instructions to the public on how to put a [[condom]] on securely; it also reviewed condoms and offered [[Safe sex|safer sex]] advice, all at the beginning of the outbreak of [[HIV]].&lt;ref name=thediary/&gt;

In 1979, Owens started the Outsiders Club for socially and physically disabled people to find partners. She was helped by Nigel Verbeek, who had recently lost his sight. Both worked voluntarily, which Tuppy continues to do today. Outsiders is a warm and friendly club providing peer support to members, a beautiful online Clubhouse, and lovely monthly lunches around the country.

In order to ensure that she answered the members' questions with accuracy, Owens trained as a [[sex therapist]] at [[St George's Hospital Medical School]] in London, where she gained a diploma in Human Sexuality in 1986.&lt;ref name=theskinny20080617/&gt; She was also subsequently awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the Institute of Advanced Study of Human Sexuality in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=theskinny20080617/&gt; In 2009, Owens was named one of the Family Planning Association‘s 80 most influential achievers in the field of family planning.

For disabled men and women who want to learn what pleasures their bodies are capable of enjoying, and how to please a partner, Owens set up the TLC Trust website, where they can find responsible, safe sexual services.

In 1981, Owens appeared in the English pornographic film ''Lady Victoria's Training'', which was produced by Mike Freeman/Videx and featured Simon Linsday Honey, who went on to work as a porn producer and actor in 1990's under the pseudonym [[Ben Dover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pre-cert.co.uk/display.php?vId=UK09550|title=Lady Victoria's Training (1981) on Videx|website=Pre-Certification Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="highbeam.com"/&gt;

In the 1990s, after more than 30 years living in London, Tuppy Owens moved away from that city. Since then, she has lived in a croft in the north of Scotland.&lt;ref name=highladnews20060608/&gt;

In 2005, Tuppy Owens founded the Sexual Health and Disability Alliance (SHADA)&lt;ref name=sexis1118103/&gt; to bring together health professionals interested in sex and disability. In November 2009, a conference with the title "Disability: Sex, Relationships and Pleasure" was held by SHADA with the [[Royal Society of Medicine]].&lt;ref name=rsm20091113/&gt; Tuppy produced the Sexual Respect Tool Kit, and started the sexual advocacy service, ASAP. Tuppy also answers the Sex and Disability Helpline. Her book "Supporting Disabled People with their Sexual Lives" was published by [[Jessica Kingsley Publishers|Jessica Kingsley]] on 19 November 2014.

Tuppy Owens remains active in running Outsiders.&lt;ref name=realist136/&gt; At the same time, she also advises the promoter of the Sexual Freedom Ball to fund Outsiders, and the organisers of the fundraiser, The [[Erotic Awards]],&lt;ref name=thetimes1085069/&gt; now called The Sexual Services and Entertainment Awards. 

Owens is now the chair of the Sexual Freedom Coalition.&lt;ref name=marieclaire200903/&gt; Back in the 90s Owens worked campaigning with Prostitution Pride, parades through London, which were funded by Arcadia events in North London.

Owens has been working with the Bath Institute of Medical Engineering in the hope that they will be able to create sex toys that can be used by disabled people who, without them, cannot masturbate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Owens|first1=Tuppy|title=Supporting disabled residents to enjoy masturbation and sexual services|url=http://shadainternational.com/all-impairments/pioneers/|website=Shada International|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owens will be the editor of a forthcoming website, The School of Sex for Disabled People, which is being created by sexually experienced disabled people and those who provide them with sexual services. She is currently writing her autobiography.

==Award==
Owens has won the 2015 Lifetime Achievement Award from the European Lifestyles Awards. She is also a Winner of the Innovation Award of Sexual Health and Human Rights UNESCO 2015.
She was a finalist (Lifetime Achievement) in the Directory of Social Change Awards 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: 2015 Social Change Awards Ceremony|url=https://www.dsc.org.uk/content/2015-social-change-awards-ceremony/|website=Directory of Social Change|accessdate=11 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Virtual Library of Musicology''' or '''VifaMusik''' ({{lang-de|Virtuelle Fachbibliothek Musikwissenschaft}}) is funded by the German Research Foundation ([[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]]) to provide sources and materials for music and [[musicology]]. The project has been active since July 2005 at the [[Bavarian State Library]], in cooperation with the [[State Institute for Music Research|State Institute for Musicological Research in Berlin]] and the German Musicological Society.

== Description ==
ViFaMusik, the central portal for music and musicology, offers access to an extensive digital library containing scholarly research and online resources such as bibliographical data, entries to experts and research projects as well as current events on search topics.  The available material includes items from the inventory of the Bavarian State Library and sources and databases from other institutions.

During the further development of the ViFaMusik numerous additional sources will be added to the ViFaMusik search engine and to the ViFaMusik web site.

'''Whale feces''',  the [[excrement]] of [[whale]]s, has a significant role in the [[ecology]] of the [[ocean]]s,&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/10/101012101255.htm|title=Whale poop pumps up ocean health|author=Brown, Joshua E.|date=12 Oct 2010|website=Science Daily|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whales have been referred to as "marine ecosystem engineers". Nitrogen released by cetacean species and [[iron chelate]] are a significant benefit to the marine [[food chain]] in addition to sequestering carbon for long periods of time. Whale feces can give information on a number of aspects of the health, natural history and ecology of an animal or group as it contains DNA, hormones, toxins and other chemicals.

 |quote  = Whales transport more nitrogen through their feces in the Gulf of Maine than all of the rivers in that system combined.
 |source = Briana Abrahms&lt;ref name="Enough N"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conservationconnections.blogspot.in/2012/05/importance-of-whale-poop-interview-with.html |title=The Importance of Whale Poop: An Interview with Joe Roman |author=Abrahms, Briana |date=1 June 2012 |website=Conservation Connections  |accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Cetaceans are an important source of [[nitrogen]]. A study in the [[Gulf of Maine]] extrapolated from modern levels nitrogen recycling in the sea due to [[marine mammals]], such as [[cetaceans]] and [[Pinniped|seals]], prior to the advent of commercial culling, estimating a former level thrice that of supply of [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen fixed from the atmosphere]]. Even today, despite reduction of marine mammal populations and increase in nitrogen uptake from the atmosphere and nitrogen pollution, the local clustering of marine mammals plays a significant role in maintaining the productivity in the regions they frequent.&lt;ref name="PLOSOne"/&gt;  The enrichment is not only in primary productivity but also secondary productivity in the form of abundance in fish populations.&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily"/&gt;

The study assumes that whales tend to defecate more commonly in the upper part of the water column, which they frequent for breathing; additionally the feces tend to float. Whales feed at deeper levels of the ocean where krill is found.&lt;ref name="PLOSOne"/&gt; The fecal action of whales thus reverses the usual flow of nutrients of the ocean's "[[biological pump]]" due to the downward flow of "[[marine snow]]" and other [[detritus]] from surface to bottom. The phenomenon has been termed the "whale pump".&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily"/&gt;

The Gulf of Maine study also found that the view of whales and other marine mammals as competitors for fishing, advocated by some nations, is incorrect as whales play a vital role in maintaining the productivity of phytoplankton and consequently  the fish. Culling marine mammal populations threatens the nutrient supply and the productivity of fishing grounds.&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily"/&gt;

In addition, the feces of krill-eating whales is rich in [[iron]].&lt;ref name="DiscoveryNews"/&gt;&lt;!--slide 5 of 5--&gt; The release of iron from whale feces encourages the growth of [[phytoplankton]] in the sea,&lt;ref name="DiscoveryNews"/&gt;&lt;!--slide 3 of 5--&gt; which not only benefits the marine [[food chain]], but also sequesters carbon for long periods of time.&lt;ref name="DiscoveryNews"/&gt;&lt;!--slide 1 of 5--&gt;  When phytoplankton, which is not consumed in its lifetime, perishes, it descends through the [[euphotic zone]] and settles down into the depths of sea. Phytoplankton sequesters an estimated 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the ocean each year, causing the ocean to become a sink of carbon dioxide which holds an estimated 90% of all sequestered carbon.&lt;ref name="EarthTimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthtimes.org/scitech/role-marine-plankton-sequestration-carbon/1062/|title=The role of marine plankton in sequestration of carbon |author=Campbell, Mike |date=22 June 2011 |website=EarthTimes|accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Southern Ocean is amongst the largest ranges for phytoplankton and has the characteristic of being nutrient-rich in terms of  phosphate, nitrate  and silicate, while it is iron-deficient at the same time.&lt;ref name="ScienceAlert"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencealert.com.au/features/20141108-26000-2.html |title=Bottoms up: how whale poop helps feed the ocean |author1=Ratnarajah, Lavenia |author2=Bowie, Andrew |author3=Hodgson-Johnson, Indi  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=11 August 2014 |website= Science Alert |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increases of nutrient iron results in blooming of phytoplankton. Whale feces is up to 10 million times richer in iron than the surrounding sea water and plays a vital role in providing the iron required for maintaining phytoplankton biomass on the earth.&lt;ref name="ScienceAlert"/&gt; The iron defecation of just the 12,000 strong [[sperm whale]] population  in the Southern Ocean results in the sequestration of 200,000 tonnes of atmospheric carbon per year.&lt;ref name="ScienceAlert"/&gt;

A study of the Southern Ocean found that whales not only recycled iron concentrations vital for phytoplankton, but also formed, along with krill, a major source of sequestered iron in the ocean, up to 24% of the iron held in the surface waters of Southern Ocean. Whales formed part of a positive feedback loop and if whale populations are allowed to recover in the Southern Ocean,  greater productivity of phytoplankton will result as larger amounts of iron are recycled through the system.&lt;ref name="NicollEtAl2010"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-2979.2010.00356.x/abstract|title=Southern Ocean iron fertilization by baleen whales and Antarctic krill|authors=Nicol, Stephen; Bowie, Andrew; Jarman, Simon; Lannuzel, Delphine; Meiners, Klaus M &amp; Van Der Merwe, Pier |journal=Fish and Fisheries| volume=11 |issue=2 |pages= 203–209|date=June 2010| accessdate=22 August 2014 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-2979.2010.00356.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, whales are referred to as "marine ecosystem engineers".&lt;ref name="ESAJournal"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/130220 |title=Whales as marine ecosystem engineers |authors=Roman, Joe; Estes, James A.;  Morissette, Lyne; Smith, Craig; Costa, Daniel; McCarthy, James; Nation,  J.B.;  Nicol, Stephen; Pershing, Andrew &amp;  Smetacek, Victor |journal = Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment  |publisher=Ecological Society of America |doi=10.1890/130220 |date=2014 |accessdate=23 August 2014 |volume=12 |pages=377–385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted in the [[Fernando de Noronha]] Archipelago of the southwest [[Atlantic Ocean]], revealed the feces and vomit of [[Spinner dolphin]]s (''Stenella longirostris'') formed part of the diet of twelve species of reef fish from seven different families. The most prolific consumer was the [[black durgon]] (''Melichthys niger''), which could even discern the postures dolphins assumed prior to voiding and positioned themselves for effective feeding. All these offal eating fish species are recorded plankton eaters and it is considered that this type of feeding may represent a change in its usual diet, i.e. drifting plankton.&lt;ref name="Sazimaetal2003"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The cetacean offal connection: Feces and vomits of spinner dolphins as a food source for reef fishes |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263336964_The_cetacean_offal_connection_Feces_and_vomits_of_spinner_dolphins_as_a_food_source_for_reef_fishes |type=abstract| journal=Bulletin of Marine Science|place=Miami|year=2003|volume=72|issue=1|access-date=26 April 2015|authors=Sazima, Ivan; Sazima, Cristina &amp; Silva, José Martins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whales, along with other large animals, play a significant role in the transport of nutrients in global ecological cycles. Population reduction of whales and other large animals has severely affected the efficacy of pump mechanisms which transport nutrients from the deep sea to the continental shelves.&lt;ref&gt;

==Whale feces as indicators of health and ecology==
Whale feces contain DNA, hormones, toxins and other chemicals which can give information on a number of aspects of the health, natural history and ecology of the animal concerned. Feces have also provided information on the bacteria present in the gastro-intestinal tract of whales and dolphins.

===Indicator for diet composition===
A 2016 research study used [[fecal analysis]] of wild orcas, which spent the summer season in the [[Salish Sea]], for quantitive estimation of prey species. The analysis was consistent with earlier estimates based on surface prey remains. The study found that salmonids comprised over 98.6% of the identified genetic sequences with [[Chinook salmon|Chinook]] and [[coho salmon]] species as the most important prey species.&lt;ref name="CrockerFord2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crocker|first1=Daniel E|last2=Ford|first2=Michael J.|last3=Hempelmann|first3=Jennifer|last4=Hanson|first4=M. Bradley|last5=Ayres|first5=Katherine L.|last6=Baird|first6=Robin W.|last7=Emmons|first7=Candice K.|last8=Lundin|first8=Jessica I.|last9=Schorr|first9=Gregory S.|last10=Wasser|first10=Samuel K.|last11=Park|first11=Linda K.|title=Estimation of a Killer Whale (Orcinus orca) Population’s Diet Using Sequencing Analysis of DNA from Feces|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=1|year=2016|pages=e0144956|issn=1932-6203|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0144956|pmid=26735849|pmc=4703337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As indicator for population decline===
A research study, published in 2012, on impacts of overfishing and maritime traffic on a wild population of the Southern Resident Killer Whales of the western seaboard of North America, was based on the chemical analysis of fecal specimens  of orcas. The study aimed to find out the reasons for orca decline for which three causes were hypothesized - disturbance by boats and ships, lack of food, and, long-term exposure of toxins which accumulate in whale fat, namely DDT, PBDT and PCB.&lt;ref name="Ayres et al (2012)"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0036842 |title=Distinguishing the Impacts of Inadequate Prey and Vessel Traffic on an Endangered Killer Whale (Orcinus orca) Population | authors=Ayres, Katherine L.; Rebecca K. Booth; Jennifer A. Hempelmann; Kari L. Koski; Candice K. Emmons; Robin W. Baird; Kelley Balcomb-Bartok; M. Bradley Hanson; Michael J. Ford &amp; Samuel K. Wasser |year=2012 | journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=6 |accessdate=10 Apr 2015 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0036842 | pages=e36842 | pmid=22701560 | pmc=3368900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fecal samples of orca were detected with the help of a trained spotter dog, a black [[labrador retriever]], named "Tucker", from a firm [[Conservation Canines]]. The dog could detect fresh scat from orcas while following in a boat {{convert|200|to|400|m|ft}} behind a pod of orcas. Fecal samples collected were tested for the presence and quantity of [[DNA]], as well as stress,  nutrition and  reproductive [[hormone]]s, and toxins such as  [[PBDE]], [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]], and [[DDT]] [[congener (chemistry)|congener]]s.&lt;ref name="Cons Biology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conservationbiology.uw.edu/research-programs/killer-whales/| title=Causes of decline among Southern Resident killer whales : Research overview |website=Center for Conservation Biology|publisher=University of Washington, Seattle|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fecal samples were analysed over time and co-related to boat densities over time and the quantity of Fraser River Chinook salmon, the main constituent of orca diet in those regions. Boat densities and the salmon abundance over time were estimated independently.&lt;ref name="Cons Biology"/&gt; [[Glucocorticoid]]s  in orcas rise when the animal faces psychological tension or starvation. The study found that prey is maximum in August, at which time, boats are most abundant. Conversely, the availability of salmon was minimum in late fall when the level of marine boat traffic was also the least. Glucocorticoid levels were highest in the fall when there was a shortage of prey and maximum during August at the height of availability of food.&lt;ref name="Cons Biology"/&gt;

Similarly [[thyroid hormone]]s co-relate to nutritional stress, enabling animals to lower metabolism rates to better conserve declining nutrition. The Southern Resident Killer Whales arrive in the study area in spring after having fed on salmons from early spring spawning on other rivers when their thyroid hormone levels are highest. The hormone levels decline as the animals arrive in the study area, plateau during the time of fish availability and decline further during the period of nutritional scarcity.&lt;ref name="Cons Biology"/&gt; The toxin analysis was ongoing at the time of publication of research. So far, presence of congeners of the three toxins in whale feces are found to be proportionate to the levels of these chemicals measured in samples of orca flesh during biopsy.  The results indicate that restoring the abundance and quality of available prey is an important first measure to restoring orca populations in the area under study.&lt;ref name="Cons Biology"/&gt;

===Biodiversity indicator===

An analysis of feces of two dolphin and one whale species led to the discovery of a new species of [[Helicobacter]], namely ''[[Helicobacter cetorum]]'', the bacteria being associated with clinical symptoms and [[gastritis]] in the cetaceans.&lt;ref name="Harperetal2003"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Harper, Claudia G. ; Whary, Mark T.; Yan Feng; Rhinehart, Howard L.; Wells, Randall S.; Shilu Xu;  Taylor, Nancy S.; &amp; Fox, James G.|title=Comparison of Diagnostic Techniques for ''Helicobacter cetorum'' Infection in Wild Atlantic Bottlenose Dolphins (''Tursiops truncatus'')|journal=Journal of Clinical Microbiology| date=July 2003 | volume= 41|issue= 7 |pages= 2842–2848 |doi=10.1128/JCM.41.7.2842-2848.2003|pmc=165289}}&lt;/ref&gt;
