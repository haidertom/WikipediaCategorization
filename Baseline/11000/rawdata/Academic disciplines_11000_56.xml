In [[Greek mythology]], the '''Amazons''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμαζόνες}}, ''{{transl|grc|Amazónes}}'', singular {{lang|grc|Ἀμαζών}}, ''{{transl|grc|Amazōn}}'') were a tribe of women warriors related to [[Scythians]] and [[Sarmatians]]. [[Apollonius Rhodius]], at [[Argonautica]], mentions that Amazons were the daughters of [[Ares]] and [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]] (a nymph of the Akmonian Wood). They were brutal and aggressive, and their main concern in life was war.&lt;ref name="theoi.com"&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/AresFamily.html Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica, Book 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2"&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo23.htm ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]] and [[Strabo]] place them on the banks of the [[Thermodon]],&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hh/hh4110.htm Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/rca/rca02.htm THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Diodorus]] giving the account of Dionysius of Mitylene, who, on his part, drew on Thymoetas, states that before the Amazons of the Thermodon there were, much earlier in time, the Amazons of Libya.&lt;ref name="penelope.uchicago.edu"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html The Library of History of Diodorus Siculus, Book III, 52]&lt;/ref&gt; These Amazons started from [[Ancient Libya|Libya]], passed through Egypt and Syria, and stopped at the [[Caïcus]] in [[Aeolis]], near which they founded several cities. Later, he says, they established [[Mytilene]] a little way beyond the Caïcus.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; [[Aeschylus]], in [[Prometheus Bound]], places the original home of the Amazons in the country about [[Lake Maeotis]] and they later moved to [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]] on the Thermodon.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/AeschylusPrometheus.html AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] tells that the Amazons were sought and found somewhere near [[Lycia]].&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;

Notable queens of the Amazons are [[Penthesilea]], who participated in the [[Trojan War]], and her sister [[Hippolyta]], whose magical girdle, given to her by her father [[Ares]], was the object of one of the [[labours of Heracles]]. [[Diodorus]] mentions that the Amazons traveled from Libya under Queen [[Myrina (mythology)|Myrina]].&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; Amazon warriors were often depicted in battle with Greek warriors in [[amazonomachy|amazonomachies]] in classical art.

Archaeological discoveries of burial sites with female warriors on the Eurasian steppes suggest that the [[Scythian]] women may have inspired the myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simon|first1=Worrall|title=Amazon Warriors Did Indeed Fight and Die Like Men|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/10/141029-amazons-scythians-hunger-games-herodotus-ice-princess-tattoo-cannabis/|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foreman|first1=Amanda|title=The Amazon Women: Is There Any Truth Behind the Myth?|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/amazon-women-there-any-truth-behind-myth-180950188/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[early modern period]], their name has become a term for female warriors in general. Amazons were said to have founded the cities and temples of Smyrna, Sinope, Cyme, Gryne, Ephesus, Pitania, Magnesia, Clete, Pygela, Latoreria and Amastris; according to legend, the Amazons also invented the [[cavalry]].&lt;ref name="Wonder Woman"&gt;{{Cite book| last1=Steinem | first1=Gloria| last2=Chesler| first2=Phyllis | last3=Feitler | first3=Bea | title= Wonder Woman | publisher= Hole, Rinehart and Winston and Warner Books | date=1972 | isbn = 0-03-005376-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Palaephatus]], who was trying to rationalize the Greek myths in his work ''On Unbelievable Tales'' or ''On Incredible Tales'' ({{lang-grc|Περὶ ἀπίστων ἱστοριῶν}}), stated that the Amazons most probably were men mistaken for women by their enemies because they wore clothing which reached their feet, tied up their hair in headbands and shaved their beards, and also, since they did not exist during his time, most probably they did nοt exist in the past either.&lt;ref&gt;Palaephatus On Unbelievable Tales&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t4EfiGQwgh4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false On Unbelievable Tales, p. 64]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a-NmaO-kM2UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Classical Mythology: A Guide to the Mythical World of the Greeks and Romans, p. 9]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The origin of the word is uncertain. It may be derived from an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[ethnonym]] ''*ha-mazan-'' "warriors", a word attested indirectly through a derivation, a denominal verb in [[Hesychius of Alexandria]]'s gloss {{lang|grc|"ἁμαζακάραν· πολεμεῖν. Πέρσαι"}} ("''{{transl|grc|hamazakaran}}'': 'to make war' in Persian"), where it appears together with the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] root ''*kar-'' "make" (from which [[Sanskrit]] ''[[karma]]'' is also derived).&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz, ''Xenia Lidéniana'' (1912), 270ff., cited after [[Hjalmar Frisk]], ''Greek Etymological Dictionary'' (1960–1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

It may also be derived from ''{{PIE|*ṇ-mṇ-gw-jon-es}}'' "manless, without husbands" ([[privative a|''a-'' privative]] and a derivation of ''[[Man (word)|*man-]]'' also found in Slavic ''muzh'') has been proposed, an explanation deemed "unlikely" by [[Hjalmar Frisk]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsohn, [[Kuhns Zeitschrift|KZ]] 54, 278ff., cited after [[Hjalmar Frisk]] (1960–1970).&lt;/ref&gt; 19th-century scholarship also connected the term to the ethnonym [[Amazigh]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy Cadogan Rothery, ''The Amazons'' (1910), [http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/ama/ama08.htm ch. 7]: "There have been some authors who trace the word Amazon from this term."&lt;/ref&gt; A further explanation proposes Iranian *''ama-janah'' "virility-killing" as source.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hinge|2005|pp=94–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=The Hittite researcher Friedrich Cornelius assumes that there had been the land Azzi with the capital Chajasa in the area of the Thermodon-Iris Delta on the coast of the Black Sea. He brings its residents in direct relation to the Amazons, namely based on its name (woman of the land Azzi = 'Am'+ 'Azzi' = Amazon) and its customs (matriarchal custom of promiscuous sexual intercourse, even with blood relatives).

Among Classical Greeks, ''amazon'' was given a [[False etymology|folk etymology]] as originating from ''{{transl|grc|a-}}'' ({{lang|grc|ἀ-}}) and ''{{transl|grc|mazos}}'' ({{lang|grc|μαζός}}), "without [[breast]]", connected with an [[etiology|etiological]] tradition once claimed by [[Justin (historian)|Marcus Justinus]] who alleged that Amazons had their right [[mastectomy|breast cut off]] or [[breast ironing|burnt out]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin (historian)|Justinus']] "Historiae Phillippicae ex Trogo Pompeio", Liber II, 4: "Virgines (...) armis, equis, venationibus exercebant, inustis infantum dexterioribus mammis, ne sagittarum iactus impediantur; unde dictae Amazones." "They exercised the virgins on weapon-wielding, horse-riding and hunting, and burned the children's right breasts, so that arrow-throwing wouldn't be impeded; and for such reason, they were called Amazons."&lt;/ref&gt; There is no indication of such a practice in ancient works of art,&lt;ref name=Mayor&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-amazons-lives--legends-of-warrior-women-across-the-ancient-world-by-adrienne-mayor-book-review-9799090.html|title=The Amazons: Lives &amp; Legends of Warrior Women Across the Ancient World by Adrienne Mayor, book review|last=Haynes|first=Natalie|date=16 October 2014|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Amazons are always represented with both breasts, although one is frequently covered.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Amazons|volume=1|pages=790–791}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayor"/&gt; Adrienne Mayor suggests the origin of this myth was due to the word's etymology.&lt;ref name=Mayor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Adrienne Mayor, Start the Week, Radio Four|date= 6 April 2015|time= 21:30 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05plghp|publisher=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greeks also used some [[epithet|descriptive phrases]] for them. Herodotus used the ''Androktones'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνες}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androktona}}'') ("killers of men")&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt; and ''Androleteirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androleteira}}'') ("destroyers of men, murderesses"),&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; in the [[Iliad]] they are also called ''Antianeirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Antianeira}}'') ("against men") and Aeschylus, in his work ''Prometheus Bound'', used ''styganor'' ({{lang|grc|στυγάνωρ}}) ("those who loathe all men").&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0009%3Acard%3D696 Aeschylus, Prometheus Bound]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Amazon Anıtı (2).jpg|thumb|upleft|Amazons monument in [[Samsun]], [[Turkey]].]]

[[Herodotus]] and [[Strabo]] placed them on the banks of the [[Thermodon]] and [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]].&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt;&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; Herodotus also mentions that some Amazons lived at Scythia because after the Greeks defeated the Amazons in battle, they sailed away carrying in three ships as many Amazons as they had been able to take alive, but out at sea the Amazons attacked the crews and killed them, then these Amazons landed at Scythian lands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D110%3Asection%3D1 Herodotus Histories]&lt;/ref&gt; Strabo writes that the original home of the Amazons was in Themiscyra and the plains about Thermodon and the mountains that lie above them, but were later driven out of these places, and during his time they were said to live in the mountains above [[Caucasian Albania]] (not to be confused with the modern [[Albania]]), but he also states that some others, among them [[Metrodorus of Scepsis]] and [[Hypsicrates]], say that after Themiscyra, the Amazons traveled and lived on the borders of the Gargarians, in the northerly foothills of those parts of the [[Caucasian Mountains]] which are called Ceraunian.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/11E*.html STRABO, GEOGRAPHY, Book XI, Chapter 5] {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diodorus]] giving the account of Dionysius of Mitylene, who, on his part, drew on Thymoetas states that before the Amazons of the Thermodon there were, much earlier in time, the Amazons of Libya.&lt;ref name="penelope.uchicago.edu"/&gt; These Amazons started from [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] passed through Egypt and Syria, and stopped at the [[Caïcus]] in [[Aeolis]], near which they founded several cities. Later, he says, they established [[Mitylene]] a little way beyond the Caïcus.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; [[Aeschylus]], in ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', places the original home of the Amazons in the country about [[Lake Maeotis]] and they later moved to [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]] on the Thermodon.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"/&gt; According to [[Pseudo-Plutarch]], the Amazons lived in and about the Tanais ({{lang-grc-gre|Τάναϊς}}) river (modern [[Don River (Russia)|Don river]]), formerly called the Amazonian or Amazon ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμαζόνιος}}) river, because the Amazons bathed themselves therein.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0400%3Achapter%3D14 Pseudo-Plutarch-XIV, TANAIS]&lt;/ref&gt; The Amazons later moved to [[Themiscyra (mythology)|Themiscyra]] (speculated to be modern [[Terme]], though no ruins exist) on the River [[Thermodon]] (the Terme river in northern Turkey).
[[Plutarch]] mentions that the campaign(s) of [[Heracles]] and [[Theseus]] against the Amazons was at [[Euxine Sea]] (modern Black Sea).&lt;ref name="uchicago2"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/theseus*.html Plutarch, The Parallel Lives, The Life of Theseus]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] tells that the Amazons were sought and found somewhere near [[Lycia]].&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;

The Amazons were supposed to have founded many towns, amongst them [[Smyrna]], [[Ephesus]], [[Cyme (Aeolis)|Cyme]], [[Myrina (Aeolis)|Myrina]], [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]], [[Paphos]], [[Mitylene]].&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; At [[Patmos]] there was a place called Amazonium.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stadiasm. Mar. Mag. p. 488, ed. Hoffmann&lt;/ref&gt; Also, on the island of [[Lemnos]], there was another Myrina.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; The cities of Myrina had this name after the amazon [[Myrina (mythology)|Myrina]].

[[Apollonius Rhodius]], at [[Argonautica]], mentions that at Thermodon the Amazons were not gathered together in one city, but scattered over the land, parted into three tribes. In one part dwelt the Themiscyreians ({{lang|grc|Θεμισκύρειαι}}), in another the Lycastians ({{lang|grc|Λυκάστιαι}}), and in another the Chadesians ({{lang|grc|Χαδήσιαι}}).&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 994-1001"&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo23.htm ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 994-1001]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other names==

Greeks also used other [[epithet|descriptive phrases]] for them. Herodotus used the ''Androktones'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνες}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androktonα}}'') ("killers/slayers of men")&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt; and ''Androleteirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androleteira}}'') ("destroyers of men, murderesses"),&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; in the [[Iliad]] they are also called ''Antianeirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Antianeira}}'') ("equivalent to men") and Aeschylus used the ''Styganor'' ({{lang|grc|Στυγάνωρ}}) ("those who loathe all men")&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"/&gt; in his work [[Prometheus Bound]].

[[Herodotus]] stated that in the Scythian language they were called ''Oiorpata'', ''oior'' meaning "man", and ''pata'' meaning "to slay".&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt;

==Mythology==
In some versions of the myth, no men were permitted to have sexual encounters or reside in Amazon country; but once a year, in order to prevent their race from dying out, they visited the [[Gargareans]], a neighbouring tribe.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[Strabo]], giving credits to [[Metrodorus of Scepsis]] and [[Hypsicrates]], mentions that at his time the Amazons were believed to live on the borders of the [[Gargareans]]. There were two special months in the spring in which they would go up into the neighboring mountain which separates them and the Gargareans. The Gargareans also, in accordance with an ancient custom, would go there to offer sacrifice with the Amazons and also to have intercourse with them for the sake of begetting children. They did this in secrecy and darkness, any Gargareans at random with any Amazon, and after making them pregnant they would send them away. Any females that were born are retained by the Amazons themselves, but the males would be taken to the Gargareans to be brought up; and each Gargarean to whom a child is brought would adopt the child as his own, regarding the child as his son because of his uncertainty.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt; He also stated that the Gargareans went up from Themiscyra into this region with the Amazons, then, in company with some Thracians and Euboeans who had wandered thus far, waged war against them. They later ended the war against the Amazons and made a compact that they should have dealings with one another only in the matter of children, and that each people should live independent of the other.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt;
In addition, he states that the right breasts of all Amazons are seared when they are infants, so that they can easily use their right arm for every needed purpose, and especially that of throwing the javelin and use the bow.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt;
[[File:Otto van Veen - Amazons and Scythians.jpg|thumb|left|320px|''Amazons and Scythians'' by [[Otto van Veen]]]]

Herodotus mentions that when Greeks defeated the Amazons at war, they sailed away carrying in three ships as many Amazons as they had been able to take alive, but out at sea the Amazons attacked the crews and killed them. But the Amazons knew nothing about ships so they were driven about by waves and winds and they were disembarked at the land of the Scythians, there they met first with a troop of horses feeding, they seized them and mounted upon these they plundered the property of the Scythians. The Scythians were not able to understand them because they did not know either their speech or their dress or the race to which they belonged, and they thought that they were men. Scythians fought a battle against them, and after the battle the Scythians got possession of the bodies of the dead, and thus they discovered that they were women. After the battle Scythians sent young men and told them to encamp near the Amazons and to do whatsoever they should do. If the women should come after them, they were not to fight but to retire before them, and when the women stopped, they were to approach near and encamp. This plan was adopted by the Scythians because they desired to have children born from them. When the Amazons perceived that they had not come to do them any harm, they let them alone; and the two camps approached nearer to one another every day: and the young men, like the Amazons, had nothing except their arms and their horses and got their living, as the Amazons did, by hunting and by taking booty. One day a Scythian and an Amazon came close. They could not speak to each other because they were speaking different languages but the Amazon made signs to him with her hand to come. Later the young Scythians and the Amazons joined their camps and lived together, each man having for his wife her with whom he had had dealings at first. The men were not able to learn the language of the Amazons, but the women learned Scythian.&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt;

[[Apollonius Rhodius]], at [[Argonautica]], mentions that Amazons were the daughters of [[Ares]] and [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]] (a nymph of the Akmonian Wood). They were brutal and aggressive, and their main concern in life was war.&lt;ref name="theoi.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2"/&gt; According to him, the Amazons were not gathered together in one city, but scattered over the land, parted into three tribes. In one part dwelt the Themiscyreians ({{lang|grc|Θεμισκύρειαι}}), in another the Lycastians ({{lang|grc|Λυκάστιαι}}), and in another the Chadesians ({{lang|grc|Χαδήσιαι}}).&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 994-1001"/&gt; Also, he mention that on an island, the Queens of the Amazons, Otrere ({{lang|grc|Ὀτρηρή}}) and Antiope ({{lang|grc|Ἀντιόπη}}), built a marble temple of Ares. On this desert island there were ravening birds, which in countless numbers haunt it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo17.htm ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 380-390]&lt;/ref&gt; The island mentioned is the [[Aretias]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D13 Pliny the Elder, The Natural History-Book VI-Chapter 13.5]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Argonauts]] passed by Themiscyra on their journey to [[Colchis]].

The King [[Iobates]] sent [[Bellerophon]] against Amazons, hoping that they would kill him, but Bellerophon killed them all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' vi. 186, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholiast]] ''On [[Lycophron]]'' 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DO.%3Apoem%3D13 Pindar, Olympian 13:89]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amazons appear in [[Greek art]] of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] and in connection with several Greek legends. The tomb of [[Myrine]] is mentioned in the ''Iliad''; later interpretation made of her an Amazon: according to [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' Book ii.45-46; book iii.52-55&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Diodorus, the Amazons under the rule of Queen Myrina, invaded the lands of the [[Atlantis|Atlantians]]. Amazons defeated the army of the Atlantian city of Cerne, treated the captives savagely, killed all the men, led into slavery the children and women, and razed the city. When the terrible fate of the inhabitants of Cerne became known among the other Atlantians, they were struck with terror, surrendered their cities on terms of capitulation and announced that they would do whatever should be commanded them. Queen Myrina bearing herself honourably towards the Atlantians, established friendship with them and founded a city to bear her name in place of the city of Cerne which had been razed; and in it she settled both the captives and any native who so desired. Atlantians presented her with magnificent presents and by public decree voted to her notable honours, and she in return accepted their courtesy and in addition promised that she would show kindness to their nation. Diodorus also mentions that the Amazons of Queen Myrina used the skins of gigantic snakes, from Libya, to protect themselves at battle. Later Queen Myrine led her Amazons to victory against the [[Gorgons]]. After the battle against the Gorgons, Myrina accorded a funeral to her fallen comrades on three pyres and raised up three great heaps of earth as tombs, which are called "Amazon Mounds" ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμαζόνων σωρούς}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html The Library of History of Diodorus Siculus, Book III, 54]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the [[Labours of Hercules|tasks imposed upon Hercules]] by [[Eurystheus]] was to obtain possession of the [[girdle]] of the Amazonian queen [[Hippolyta]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pseudo-Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' ii. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' iv. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] xi. 244&lt;/ref&gt; He was accompanied by his friend [[Theseus]], who carried off the princess [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]], sister of Hippolyta, an incident which led to a retaliatory invasion of [[Attica]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' i. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Theseus'' 26-28&lt;/ref&gt; in which Antiope perished fighting by the side of Theseus.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In some versions, however, Theseus marries Hippolyta and in others, he marries Antiope and she does not die; by this marriage with the Amazon Theseus had a son [[Hippolytus (son of Theseus)|Hippolytus]]. 
In another version of this myth, Theseus made this voyage on his own account, after the time of Heracles.&lt;ref name="uchicago2"/&gt;
The battle between the Athenians and Amazons is often commemorated in an entire genre of art, [[amazonomachy]], in marble [[bas-relief]]s such as from the [[Parthenon]] or the sculptures of the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]].
[[File:Johann Georg Platzer - Thalestris im Lager Alexander des Großen.jpg|left|thumb|300px|''[[Thalestris]], Queen of the Amazons, visits [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'' by [[Johann Georg Platzer]]]]

[[Plutarch]], in his work [[Parallel Lives]]-The Life of Theseus, mentions that Bion said that the Amazons, were naturally friendly to men, and did not fly from Theseus when he touched upon their coasts.&lt;ref name="uchicago2"/&gt;

Amazons attacked the [[Phrygia]]ns, who were assisted by [[Priam]], then a young man.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' iii. 189&lt;/ref&gt; In his later years, however, towards the end of the [[Trojan War]], his old opponents took his side against the Greeks under their queen [[Penthesilea]] "of [[Thrace|Thracian]] birth", who was slain by [[Achilles]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the ''[[Aethiopis]]'', a continuation of the ''Iliad''. The epic, by [[Arctinus of Miletus]], is lost: only references to it survive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] i. 699&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin (historian)|Justin]] ii.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' i. 490&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' v. 11. § 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Philostratus]] ''Her.'' xix. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The god [[Dionysus]] and his entourage fought the amazons at [[Ephesus]], the Amazons fled to [[Samos]], but Dionysus pursued them and at Samos he killed a great number of them on a spot which was, from that occurrence, called Panaema ({{lang|grc|Πάναιμα}}), which means blood-soaked field.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rboWBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Amazons: Lives and Legends of Warrior Women across the Ancient World]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0216%3Asection%3D56 Plutarch, Quaestiones Graecae, Question 56]&lt;/ref&gt; In another myth Dionysus united with the Amazons to fight against [[Cronus]] and the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3E*.html DIODORUS SICULUS LIBRARY OF HISTORY, Book III, 74]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amazons are also said to have undertaken an expedition against the [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|island of Leuke]], at the mouth of the [[Danube]], where the ashes of Achilles had been deposited by [[Thetis]]. The ghost of the dead hero appeared and so terrified the horses, that they threw and trampled upon the invaders, who were forced to retire. [[Pompey]] is said to have found them in the army of [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

They are heard of in the time of Alexander, when some of the king's biographers make mention of Amazon Queen [[Thalestris]] visiting him and becoming a mother by him (the story is known from the ''[[Alexander Romance]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Greek [[Alexander Romance]], [http://www.attalus.org/translate/alexander3c.html#25 3.25-26]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, several other biographers of Alexander dispute the claim, including the highly regarded [[secondary source]], [[Plutarch]]. In his writing he makes mention of a moment when Alexander's secondary naval commander, [[Onesicritus]], was reading the Amazon passage of his Alexander history to King [[Lysimachus]] of [[Thrace]] who was on the original expedition: the king smiled at him and said "And where was I, then?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Alexander'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/6-7.html#46 Chapter 46]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman writer [[Virgil]]'s characterization of the [[Volsci]]an warrior maiden [[Camilla (mythology)|Camilla]] in the ''[[Aeneid]]'' borrows heavily from the myth of the Amazons.

[[Jordanes]]' ''[[Getica]]'' ({{circa|560}}), purporting to give the earliest history of the [[Goths]], relates that the Goths' ancestors, descendants of [[Magog (Bible)|Magog]], originally dwelt within Scythia, on the [[Sea of Azov]] between the [[Dnieper]] and [[Don River (Russia)|Don Rivers]]. After a few centuries, following an incident where the Goths' women successfully fended off a raid by a neighboring tribe, while the menfolk were off campaigning against Pharaoh [[Vesosis]], the women formed their own army under [[Marpesia]] and crossed the Don, invading Asia. Her sister [[Lampedo]] remained in Europe to guard the homeland. They procreated with men once a year. These Amazons conquered Armenia, Syria, and all of Asia Minor, even reaching [[Ionia]] and [[Aeolis|Aeolia]], holding this vast territory for 100 years. Jordanes also mentions that they fought with Hercules, and in the Trojan War, and that a smaller contingent of them endured in the Caucasus Mountains until the time of Alexander. He mentions by name the Queens Menalippe, Hippolyta, and Penthesilea.

In the Grottaferrata Version of ''[[Digenes Akritas]]'', the twelfth century medieval epic of Basil, the Greek-Syrian knight of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] frontier, the hero battles with and kills the female warrior Maximo.

* She was descended from some Amazons.
* Taken by Alexander from the Brahmans.&lt;ref&gt;''Digenis Akritas: the Two-Blood Border Lord'', translated by Denison B. Hull, 1972, Ohio University Press, G-vi, 385-387, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several (conflicting) lists of names of Amazons.
* [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], ''[[Posthomerica]]'' I&lt;/ref&gt; lists the attendant warriors of Penthesilea: "Clonie was there, Polemusa, Derinoe, Evandre, and [[Antandre]], and [[Bremusa]], [[Hippothoe]], dark-eyed Harmothoe, [[Alcibie]], Derimacheia, Antibrote, and Thermodosa glorying with the spear."
* [[Diodorus Siculus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' IV. 16&lt;/ref&gt; lists twelve Amazons who challenged Heracles to single combat during his quest for Hippolyta's girdle and died against him one by one: [[Aella (Amazon)|Aella]], Philippis, Prothoe, Eriboea, [[Celaeno]], Eurybia, [[Phoebe (mythological characters)|Phoebe]], Deianeira, [[Asteria (mythology)|Asteria]], Marpe, Tecmessa, Alcippe. After Alcippe's death, a group attack followed. Diodorus also mentions [[Myrina (mythology)|Myrina]] as a queen of the Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html The Library of History of Diodorus Siculus, Book III]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another list of Amazons' names is found in [[Hyginus]]' ''Fabulae''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 163&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Hippolyta]], [[Otrera]], [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]] and [[Penthesilea]], it attests the following names: Ocyale, Dioxippe, Iphinome, Xanthe, [[Hippothoe]], Laomache, [[Glauce]], [[Agave (mythology)|Agave]], Theseis, Clymene, Polydora.
* Yet another different set of names is found in [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]]' ''Argonautica'':&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]], ''[http://www.theoi.com/Text/ValeriusFlaccus1.html Argonautica]'', 6. 370-377&lt;/ref&gt; he mentions Euryale, Harpe, Lyce, Menippe and Thoe. Of these Lyce also appears in a fragment preserved in the ''[[Latin Anthology]]'' where she is said to have killed the hero Clonus of [[Moesia]], son of Doryclus, with her javelin.&lt;ref name="Latin Anthology" /&gt;
* [[John Tzetzes]] in ''Posthomerica''&lt;ref&gt;[[Tzetzes]], ''Posthomerica'', 176-183&lt;/ref&gt; enumerates the Amazons who fell at [[Troy]]: Hippothoe, Antianeira, Toxophone, Toxoanassa, Gortyessa, Iodoce, Pharetre, Andro, Ioxeia, Oïstrophe, Androdaïxa, Aspidocharme, Enchesimargos, Cnemis, Thorece, Chalcaor, Eurylophe, Hecate, Anchimache, Andromache the queen. Concerning Antianeira and Andromache, see below; for almost all the other names on the list, this is a unique attestation.
* [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] provides an alternate list of the Amazons who fell against Heracles, describing them as "the most prominent" of their people: Tralla, Isocrateia, Thiba, Palla, Coea (Koia), Coenia (Koinia).&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], s. v. ''Thibaïs''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustathius]] gives the same list minus the last two names.&lt;ref&gt;Eustathius on [[Dionysius Periegetes]], 828&lt;/ref&gt; Both Stephanus and Eustathius write of these Amazons in connection with the placename Thibais, which they report to have been derived from Thiba's name.

Other names of Amazons from various sources include:

* [[Aegea]], queen of the Amazons who was thought by some to have been the [[eponym]] of the [[Aegean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Pompeius Festus]], s. v. ''Aegeum Mare''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ainia, presumably accompanied [[Penthesilea]] to the [[Trojan War]], killed by [[Achilles]]; known only from an Attic terracotta relief fragment.&lt;ref&gt;New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art 42.11.33, c. 600. ''LIMC'', "Achilleus" no. 720*.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ainippe, an Amazon who confronted [[Telamon]] in the battle against Heracles' troops.&lt;ref name="Perseus Digital Library - Description of the Tyrrhenian amphora" /&gt;
* Alce, who was said to have killed the young Oebalus of [[Arcadia]], son of Ida (otherwise unknown), with her spear during the Parthian War.&lt;ref name="Latin Anthology"&gt;''[[Latin Anthology]]'', 392 (''Traiani Imperatoris e Bello Parthico versus decori''), ed. Riese&lt;/ref&gt;
* Amastris, who was believed to be the [[eponym]] of the city previously known as Kromna,&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]] in [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] s. v. Amastris&lt;/ref&gt; although the city was actually named after the historical [[Amastrine|Amastris]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''Geography'', 12. 3. 11&lt;/ref&gt;
* Anaea, an Amazon whose tomb was shown at the island of [[Samos]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]] s. v. Anaia&lt;/ref&gt;
* Andromache, an Amazon who fought Heracles and was defeated; only known from vase paintings.&lt;ref name="Perseus Digital Library - Description of the Tyrrhenian amphora"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Boston%2098.916&amp;object=Vase |title=Perseus Digital Library - Description of the Tyrrhenian amphora |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date=1990-01-24 |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/image?img=Perseus:image:1990.24.0349|title=Perseus:image:1990.24.0349|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not to be confused with [[Andromache]], wife of [[Hector]].

* Clete, one of the twelve followers of Penthesilea. After Penthesilea's death she, in accord with the former's will, sailed off and eventually landed in Italy, founding the city of [[Clete]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tzetzes]] on [[Lycophron]], 995&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cyme, who gave her name to the city of [[Cyme (Aeolis)]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], s. v. Kyme&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Diodorus Siculus, ''Library of History'', 3. 55" /&gt;

''Kynna''. Stephanus does not write out the Amazon's name, simply stating that the town Cynna could have been named "after one of the Amazons".&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ephesos, a [[Lydia]]n Amazon, after whom the city of [[Ephesus]] was thought to have been named; she was also said to have been the first to honor [[Artemis]] and to have surnamed the goddess ''Ephesia''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Etymologicum Magnum]]'' 402. 8, under ''Ephesos''&lt;/ref&gt; Her daughter Amazo was thought of as the eponym of the Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], s. v.

===Hero cults===
According to ancient sources ([[Plutarch]], [[Theseus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:BiDerPMT15YJ:classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/theseus.html+Amazon+statues+in+Scotussa&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=4 |title=The Internet Classics Archive &amp;#124; Theseus by Plutarch |publisher=Google.com |date=2010-09-02 |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]), Amazon tombs could be found frequently throughout what was once known as the ancient Greek world. Some are found in [[Megara]], [[Athens]], [[Chaeronea]], [[Chalcis]], [[Thessaly]] at [[Skotousa]], in [[Cynoscephalae (Thessaly)|Cynoscephalae]], and statues of Amazons are all over Greece. [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], quoting [[Ephorus]], mention that the tomb of the amazon Anaea ({{lang|grc|Ἀναία}}) was at the city of [[Söke|Anaea]] ({{lang|grc|Ἄναια}}), which also has this name after the amazon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Mary Bennett| first = Florence | title = Religious Cults Associated With the Amazons| url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/rca/rca02.htm| publisher = Forgotten Books |date= December 2007 | isbn = 978-1605063867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At both Chalcis and Athens, [[Plutarch]] tells us that there was an Amazoneum or shrine of Amazons that implied the presence of both tombs and cult. At the entrance of Athens there was a monument to the Amazon [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D2 Pausanias, Description of Greece]&lt;/ref&gt; On the day before the Thesea at Athens there were annual sacrifices to the Amazons. In historical times Greek maidens of [[Ephesus]] performed an annual circular dance with weapons and shields that had been established by [[Hippolyta]] and her Amazons. They had initially set up wooden statues of [[Artemis]], a ''bretas'' ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ({{floruit|{{circa|AD 160}}}}): ''Description of Greece'', Book I: Attica).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/pausanias-bk1.html |title=Ancient History Sourcebook: Pausanias: Description of Greece, Book I: Attica |publisher=Fordham.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In art===
[[File:Gladiatrix relief.jpg|thumb|left|Two [[female gladiator]]s with their names ''Amazonia and Achillea''.]]

In works of art, battles between Amazons and Greeks are placed on the same level as – and often associated with – battles of Greeks and [[centaur]]s. The belief in their existence, however, having been once accepted and introduced into the national poetry and art, it became necessary to surround them as far as possible with the appearance of natural beings. Amazons were therefore depicted in the manner of Scythian or Sarmatian horsemen. Their occupation was hunting and war; their arms the bow, spear, axe, a half shield, nearly in the shape of a crescent, called ''pelta'', and in early art a helmet. The model in the Greek mind had apparently been the goddess [[Athena]]. In later art they approach the model of Artemis, wearing a thin dress, girt high for speed; while on the later painted vases their dress is often peculiarly [[Iran|Persian]] – that is, close-fitting trousers and a high cap called the ''kidaris''. They were usually on horseback but sometimes on foot.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;
This depiction of Amazons demonstrates just how closely, in the Greek mind, the Amazons were linked to the Scythians. Their manner of dress has been noted to bear a striking similarity to the traditional dress of nomadic peoples from the Crimea to Mongolia.&lt;ref name="amaz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/previous_seasons/case_amazon/clues.html |title=SECRETS OF THE DEAD . Amazon Warrior Women. Clues and Evidence |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amazons were described by Herodotus as wearing trousers and having tall stiff caps.{{cn|date=March 2018}} The double-sided axe was the most emblematic of their weapons.&lt;ref name="Wonder Woman"/&gt; Amazons can also be identified in vase paintings by the fact that they are wearing one earring. The battle between Theseus and the Amazons ([[Amazonomachy]]) is a favourite subject on the friezes of temples (e.g. the reliefs from the frieze of the [[Temple of Apollo at Bassae]], now in the [[British Museum]]), vases and sarcophagus reliefs; at [[Athens]] it was represented on the shield of the statue of [[Athena Parthenos]], on wall-paintings in the [[Theseum]] and in the ''[[Stoa Poikile]]''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; There were also three standard [[Amazon statue types]].

Later in the [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]], as Amazon myth evolved, artists started to depict warrior women in a new light. [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] was often thought of as an Amazon-like warrior during her reign and was sometimes depicted as such.&lt;!-- really? Examples? --&gt; Though, as explained in ''Divinia Viagro'' by Winfried Schleiner, Celeste T. Wright "has given a detailed account of the bad press Amazons had in the Renaissance (with respect to their unwomanly conduct and Scythian cruelty). She notes that she has not found any Elizabethans comparing the queen directly to an Amazon, and suggests that they might have hesitated to do so because of the association of Amazons with enfranchisement of women, which was considered contemptible."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = "Divina Virago": Queen Elizabeth as an Amazon|jstor = 4173965|journal = Studies in Philology|date = 1978-04-01|pages = 163–180|volume = 75|issue = 2|first = Winfried|last = Schleiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder|Jan Brueghel]] depicted the Battle of the Amazons around 1598, showing many attributes of Renaissance-styled paintings. Amazons also appear in the [[Rococo]] period in another painting titled ''Battle of the Amazons'' by [[Johann Georg Platzer]]. As a part of the Romantic period revival, German artist [[Anselm Feuerbach]] painted the Amazons as well. His paintings “engendered all the aspirations of the Romantics: their desire to transcend the boundaries of the ego and of the known world; their interest in the occult in nature and in the soul; their search for a national identity, and the ensuing search for the mythic origins of the Germanic nation; finally, their wish to escape the harsh realities of the present through immersion in an idealized past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = German masters of the nineteenth century : paintings and drawings from the Federal Republic of Germany / The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York :: Metropolitan Museum of Art Publications|url = http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/71300|website = libmma.contentdm.oclc.org|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

==In historiography==
[[File:S03 06 01 020 image 2552.jpg|thumbnail|Amazon in combat, infl. Polyclitus, Rome. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]
[[Herodotus]] reported that the Sarmatians were descendants of Amazons and Scythians, and that their wives observed their ancient maternal customs, "frequently hunting on horseback with their husbands; in war taking the field; and wearing the very same dress as the men". Moreover, said Herodotus, "No girl shall wed till she has killed a man in battle". In the story related by Herodotus, a group of Amazons was blown across the [[Sea of Azov|Maeotian Lake]] (the [[Sea of Azov]]) into [[Scythia]] near the cliff region (today's southeastern [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]]). After learning the Scythian language, they agreed to marry Scythian men, on the condition that they not be required to follow the customs of Scythian women. According to Herodotus, this band moved toward the northeast, settling beyond the [[Don River (Russia)|Tanais]] ([[Don River (Russia)|Don]]) river, and became the ancestors of the [[Sarmatians|Sauromatians]]. According to Herodotus, the [[Sarmatians]] fought with the Scythians against [[Darius the Great]] in the 5th century BC.

Hippocrates describes them as: "They have no right breasts...for while they are yet babies their mothers make red-hot a bronze instrument constructed for this very purpose and apply it to the right breast and cauterize it, so that its growth is arrested, and all its strength and bulk are diverted to the right shoulder and right arm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&amp;query=Hipp.%20Aer.%2017&amp;getid=2|title=Perseus Under Philologic: Hipp. Aer. 17|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amazons came to play a role in [[Roman historiography]]. Caesar reminded the Senate of the conquest of large parts of Asia by [[Semiramis]] and the Amazons. Successful Amazon raids against Lycia and Cilicia contrasted with effective resistance by Lydian cavalry against the invaders ([[Strabo]] 5.504; Nicholas Damascenus). [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus]] pays particularly detailed attention to the Amazons. The story of the Amazons as deriving from a Cappadocian colony of two Scythian princes Ylinos and Scolopetos is due to him. [[Pliny the Elder]] records some surprising facts pointing to the valley of the [[Terme River]] as possibly being their home: a mountain named for them (the modern Mason Dagi), as well as a settlement Amazonium; Herodotus (VI.86) first mentions their capital [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]], which Pliny locates near the Terme.&lt;ref&gt;[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]] VI.3.10&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philostratus]] places the Amazons in the [[Taurus Mountains]]. [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] places them east of [[Tanais]], as neighbouring the [[Alans]]. [[Procopius]] places them in the Caucasus. [[Diodorus Siculus]] (''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' III, chapter 52) mentioned that besides [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] Amazons existed much older race (at that time entirely disappeared) of Amazons from western [[Ancient Libya|Libya]], and retells their mythological story which includes [[Atlantis]] and Greek mythology.

Although Strabo shows skepticism as to their historicity, the Amazons in general continue to be taken as historical throughout Late Antiquity. Several Church Fathers speak of the Amazons as of a real people. [[Gaius Julius Solinus|Solinus]] embraces the account of Pliny. Under [[Aurelianus]], captured [[Goths|Gothic]] women were identified as Amazons ([[Claudian]]us). The account of [[Justin (historian)|Justinus]] was influential, and was used as a source by [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]] who continued to be read during the European Middle Ages. Medieval authors thus continue the tradition of locating the Amazons in the North, [[Adam of Bremen]] placing them at the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Paulus Diaconus]] in the heart of Germania.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. A. Ukert]], ''Die Amazonen'', Abhandlungen der philosophisch-philologischen Classe der Königlich Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften (1849), 63..&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval and Renaissance literature==
[[File:Dahomey amazon1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dahomey Amazons]] were so named by Western observers due to their similarity to the mythical Amazons]]

Amazons continued to be discussed by authors of the European Renaissance, and with the [[Age of Exploration]], they were located in ever more remote areas. In 1542, [[Francisco de Orellana]] reached the [[Amazon River]] (''Amazonas'' in Spanish), naming it after a tribe of warlike women he claimed to have encountered and fought on the [[Nhamundá River]], a tributary of the Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;It has been suggested that what Orellana actually engaged was an especially warlike tribe of Native Americans whose warrior men had long hair and thus appeared to him as women. See Theobaldo Miranda Santos, ''Lendas e mitos do Brasil'' ("Brazil's legends and myths"), Companhia Editora Nacional, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards the whole basin and region of the Amazon (''Amazônia'' in Portuguese, ''Amazonía'' in Spanish) were named after the river. Amazons also figure in the accounts of both [[Christopher Columbus]] and [[Walter Raleigh]].&lt;ref&gt;Ukert (1849), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Famous medieval traveller [[John Mandeville]] mentions them in his book:

{{quote|Beside the land of Chaldea is the land of Amazonia, that is the land of Feminye. And in that realm is all woman and no man; not as some may say, that men may not live there, but for because that the women will not suffer no men amongst them to be their sovereigns.&lt;ref&gt;''The Travels of Sir John Mandeville'', Dover publications, Mineola, New York, 2006, cap. XVII, p. 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Medieval and Renaissance authors credit the Amazons with the invention of the [[Corded Ware culture|battle-axe]]. This is probably related to the ''[[sagaris]]'', an axe-like weapon associated with both Amazons and Scythian tribes by Greek authors (see also [[Thracian tomb of Aleksandrovo kurgan]]). [[Paulus Hector Mair]] expresses astonishment that such a "manly weapon" should have been invented by a "tribe of women", but he accepts the attribution out of respect for his authority, [[Johannes Aventinus]].

[[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' contains a country of warrior women, ruled by Queen Orontea; the epic describes an origin much like that in Greek myth, in that the women, abandoned by a band of warriors and unfaithful lovers, rallied together to form a nation from which men were severely reduced, to prevent them from regaining power. The Amazons and Queen Hippolyta are also referenced in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' in "[[The Knight's Tale]]".

==Historical background==
[[Classics|Classicist]] Peter Walcot wrote, "Wherever the Amazons are located by the Greeks, whether it is somewhere along the Black Sea in the distant north-east, or in Libya in the furthest south, it is always beyond the confines of [[Civilization|the civilized world]]. The Amazons exist outside the range of normal human experience."&lt;ref&gt;P. Walcot, "Greek Attitudes towards Women: The Mythological Evidence" ''Greece &amp; Rome''2nd Series 31.1 (April 1984, pp. 37-47) p 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there are various proposals for a historical nucleus of the Amazons of Greek historiography, the most obvious candidates being historical [[Scythia]] and [[Sarmatia]] in line with the account by [[Herodotus]], but some authors prefer a comparison to cultures of Asia Minor or even [[Minoan Crete]].

==Archaeology==
===Scythians and Sarmatians===
Speculation that the idea of Amazons contains a core of reality is based on archaeological findings from burials, pointing to the possibility that some Sarmatian women may have participated in battle. These findings have led scholars to suggest that the Amazonian legend in [[Greek mythology]] may have been "inspired by real warrior women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/diotima/essays/wilde.shtml |title=Lyn Webster Wilde, "Did the Amazons really exist?" '&amp;#39;Diotima'&amp;#39; |publisher=Stoa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of high-ranking warrior women comes from [[kurgan]]s in southern Ukraine and Russia.
David Anthony notes, "About 20% of [[Scythians|Scythian]]-[[Sarmatian]] 'warrior graves' on the lower [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] and lower [[Volga river|Volga]] contained women dressed for battle similar to how men dress, a phenomenon that probably inspired the Greek tales about the Amazons."&lt;ref name="anthonyd"&gt;{{cite book| last = Anthony| first = David W.| title = The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World| url = https://books.google.com/?id=mTxQmQEACAAJ| year = 2007| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn = 0-691-05887-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amazone Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2342.jpg|thumb|Mounted Amazon in [[Scythia]]n costume, on an [[Attica|Attic]] red-figure vase, {{circa}}420 BC]]
Up to 25% of military burials were of armed Sarmatian women usually including bows.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/diotima/essays/wilde.shtml |title=Diotima |publisher=Stoa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian archaeologist Vera Kovalevskaya points out that when Scythian men were away fighting or hunting, nomadic women would have to be able to defend themselves, their animals and pasture-grounds competently. During the time that the Scythians advanced into Asia and achieved near-[[hegemony]] in the Near East, there was a period of twenty-eight years when the men would have been away on campaigns for long periods. During this time the women would not only have had to defend themselves, but to reproduce, and this could well be the origin of the idea that Amazons mated once a year with their neighbours, if Herodotus actually based his accounts on fact.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

Before modern archaeology uncovered some of the Scythian burials of warrior-maidens entombed under [[kurgan]]s in the region of [[Altai Mountains]] and Sarmatia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/9701/abstracts/sarmatians.html "Warrior Women of Eurasia"], Archaeology Magazine (Abstract) Volume 50 Number 1, January/February 1997 Retrieved 7/10/08.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;In a recent excavation of [[Sarmatian]] sites by Dr. Jeannine Davis-Kimball,{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} a tomb was found wherein female warriors were buried.&lt;/ref&gt; giving concrete form at last to the Greek tales, the origin of the Amazon story had been the subject of speculation among classics scholars. In the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] speculation ranged along the following lines:

{{quote|While some regard the Amazons as a purely mythical people, others assume an historical foundation for them. The deities worshipped by them were [[Ares]] (who is consistently assigned to them as a god of war, and as a god of [[Thrace|Thracian]] and generally northern origin) and [[Artemis]], not the usual Greek goddess of that name, but an Asiatic deity in some respects her equivalent. It is conjectured that the Amazons were originally the temple-servants and priestesses (''hierodulae'') of this goddess; and that the removal of the breast corresponded with the self-mutilation of the god [[Attis]] and the [[galli]], Roman priests of [[Cybele|Rhea Cybele]]. Another theory is that, as the knowledge of geography extended, travellers brought back reports of tribes ruled entirely by women, who carried out the duties which elsewhere were regarded as peculiar to man, in whom alone the rights of nobility and inheritance were vested, and who had the supreme control of affairs. Hence arose the belief in the Amazons as a nation of female warriors, organized and governed entirely by women. According to J. Viirtheim (''De Ajacis'' origine, 1907), the Amazons were of Greek origin [...] It has been suggested that the fact of the conquest of the Amazons being assigned to the two famous heroes of Greek mythology, Heracles and Theseus [...] shows that they were mythical illustrations of the dangers which beset the Greeks on the coasts of Asia Minor; rather perhaps, it may be intended to represent the conflict between the Greek culture of the colonies on the [[Black Sea|Euxine]] and the barbarism of the native inhabitants.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;}}

===Minoan Crete===
[[File:Departure of the Amazons MET DP318355.jpg|thumb|''Departure of the Amazons'', by [[Claude Deruet]], 1620]]

When [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] archeology was still in its infancy, nevertheless, a theory raised in an essay regarding the Amazons contributed by [[Lewis Richard Farnell]] and [[John Myres]] to [[Robert Ranulph Marett]]'s ''Anthropology and the Classics'' (1908),&lt;ref&gt;L.R. Farnell and J.L. Myres, "Herodotus and anthropology" in [[Robert Ranulph Marett|Robert R. Marett]] ''Anthropology and the Classics'' 1908, pp. 138ff.&lt;/ref&gt; placed their possible origins in Minoan civilization, drawing attention to overlooked similarities between the two cultures. According to Myres,&lt;ref&gt;(pp.&amp;nbsp;153 ff)&lt;/ref&gt; the tradition interpreted in the light of evidence furnished by supposed Amazon cults seems to have been very similar and may have even originated in Minoan culture. &lt;!--The following is a "hard sell" for an outdated idea: "The theory that the Amazons originally represented Minoan Crete's women has a strong case based on what [[archeologists]] and historians have been discovering about Minoan culture. Out of all the ancient civilizations which are so far known to archaeologists and historians the Minoans seem to fit most of the aspects that classical Greeks and later scholars have come to associate with the Amazonian culture."--&gt;

==Modern legacy==

The city of [[Samsun]] in modern-day [[Turkey]] features a recently constructed "Amazon Village" museum, created to bring attention to the legacy of the Amazons and to generate both academic interest and popular tourism.&lt;ref name="todayszaman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;link=212625 |title=Village of Amazons to be recreated in Samsun park - Today's Zaman, your gateway to Turkish daily news |publisher=Todayszaman.com |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2014-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201214800/http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;link=212625 |archivedate=2014-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A festival is also held every year in the [[Terme]] district of [[Samsun Province]] to celebrate the Amazons.&lt;ref name="todayszaman" /&gt;

In Greece, female [[equestrians]] are also called "Amazons" ({{lang-el|Αμαζόνες}}).

Amazons became an important subject of the fine arts around 1900, especially in the work of the Munich painter and sculptor [[Franz Stuck]] (1863-1928). 

In Nazi-Germany open air events called "Nacht der Amazonen" ([[Night of the Amazons]]) were performed at [[Nymphenburg Palace]] in [[Munich]] between 1936 and 1939. These revues with bare-breasted girls presented an allegedly emancipated female role as part of the „new race“ intended to be realized by racial fanatics.

{{As of|2016|8}}, neither the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] nor the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]] has yet officially approved the term as a recognized subdivision of [[Geologic time scale|geological time]],&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Subcomission on Quaternary Stratigraphy, ICS » Working Groups |url = http://quaternary.stratigraphy.org/workinggroups/anthropocene/ |website = quaternary.stratigraphy.org |accessdate = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gixmodo001" /&gt; although the Anthropocene Working Group (AWG) of the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS) of the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy|International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS)]], voted to proceed towards a formal [[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point|golden spike (GSSP)]] proposal to define the Anthropocene epoch in the [[Geologic time scale|Geologic Time Scale]] and presented the recommendation to the [[International Geological Congress]] on 29 August 2016.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/29/declare-anthropocene-epoch-experts-urge-geological-congress-human-impact-earth |title= The Anthropocene epoch: scientists declare dawn of human-influenced age|first= Damian |last= Carrington|date= 29 August 2016|work= [[The Guardian]] |accessdate= August 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various different start dates for the Anthropocene have been proposed, ranging from the beginning of the [[Neolithic Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] 12,000–15,000 years ago, to as recent as the [[Trinity test]] in 1945. {{As of|2018|02}}, the ratification process continues and thus a date remains to be decided definitively, but the latter date has been more favored than others.

The most recent period of the Anthropocene has been referred to by several authors as the [[Great Acceleration]] during which the socioeconomic and earth system trends are increasing dramatically, especially after the [[Second World War]]. For instance, the [[Geological Society]] termed the year 1945 as ''The Great Acceleration''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/anthropocene|title=The Anthropocene|publisher=The Geological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General==
An early concept for the Anthropocene was the [[Noosphere]] by [[Vladimir Vernadsky]], who in 1938 wrote of "scientific thought as a geological force."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://action.larouchepac.com/_the_anthropocene|title='The Anthropocene' viewed from Vernadsky's Noosphere|date=29 February 2016|publisher=Larouche Pac}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists in the [[Soviet Union]] appear to have used the term "anthropocene" as early as the 1960s to refer to the [[Quaternary]], the most recent [[Period (geology)|geological period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Akademii͡a nauk SSSR|title= Doklady: Biological sciences sections, Volumes 132-135}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=June 2018|reason=URL? Looks like a journal, not a website}} Ecologist [[Eugene F. Stoermer]] subsequently used "anthropocene" with a different sense in the 1980s&lt;ref name="revkin2011"&gt;{{cite web|last= Revkin|first= Andrew C.|title= Confronting the 'Anthropocene'|url= http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/confronting-the-anthropocene/|work= New York Times|accessdate= 25 March 2014|date=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term was widely popularized in 2000 by [[Atmospheric chemistry|atmospheric chemist]] [[Paul J. Crutzen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Dawson|first= Ashley|authorlink = Ashley Dawson |title= Extinction: A Radical History|date= 2016|publisher= [[OR Books]]|url= http://www.orbooks.com/catalog/extinction-by-ashley-dawson/|page= 19 |isbn= 978-1944869014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who regards the influence of human behavior on Earth's atmosphere in recent centuries as so significant as to constitute a new [[geological epoch]].

In 2008, the Stratigraphy Commission of the [[Geological Society of London]] considered a proposal to  make the Anthropocene a formal unit of geological epoch divisions.&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zalasiewicz08"&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Zalasiewicz |first= Jan |title = Are we now living in the Anthropocene? |journal = [[GSA Today]] |volume = 18 |issue = 2 |pages= 4–8 |year = 2008 |url = http://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/18/2/pdf/i1052-5173-18-2-4.pdf |doi = 10.1130/GSAT01802A.1|display-authors= etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of the commission decided the proposal had merit and should be examined further.

Evidence of relative human impact – such as the [[Human overpopulation#Effects of human overpopulation|growing human influence]] on land use, ecosystems, [[biodiversity]], and [[Holocene extinction|species extinction]] – is substantial; scientists think that human impact has significantly changed (or halted) the growth of biodiversity.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;{{cite journal | url= http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html | author= Sahney, S. | author2= Benton, M.

[[File:Trinity Test Fireball 16ms.jpg|thumb|The [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test]] in 1945 has been proposed as the start of the Anthropocene.]]
In January 2015, 26 of the 38 members of the International Anthropocene Working Group published a paper suggesting the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test]] on 16 July 1945 as the starting point of the proposed new epoch.&lt;ref name=trinity&gt;"[http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2015/01/16/was-first-nuclear-test-dawn-of-new-human-dominated-epoch-the-anthropocene/ Was first nuclear test the start of new human-dominated epoch, the Anthropocene?]" [[University of California, Berkeley]] News Centre, 16 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; However, a significant minority supports one of several alternative dates.&lt;ref name=trinity /&gt; A March 2015 report suggested either 1610 or 1964 as the beginning of Anthropocene.&lt;ref name="Lewis &amp; Maslin"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lewis |first1= Simon L. |last2= Maslin |first2= Mark A. |title= Defining the Anthropocene |journal= Nature |volume= 519 |date= March 2015 |pages= 171–180 |url= http://www.realtechsupport.org/UB/MCC/Lewis_DefiningAnthropocene_2015.pdf |doi= 10.1038/nature14258 |bibcode= 2015Natur.519..171L |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151224052554/http://www.realtechsupport.org/UB/MCC/Lewis_DefiningAnthropocene_2015.pdf |archivedate= 2015-12-24 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars point to the [[diachronous]] character of the physical strata of the Anthropocene, arguing that onset and impact are spread out over time, not reducible to a single instant or date of start.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Diachronous beginnings of the Anthropocene: The lower bounding surface of anthropogenic deposits |url= http://anr.sagepub.com/content/2/1/33 |journal= The Anthropocene Review |date=1 April 2015 |issn= 2053-0196 |pages= 33–58 |volume= 2 |issue= 1 |doi = 10.1177/2053019614565394 |first1= Matt |last1= Edgeworth |first2= Dan deB |last2= Richter |first3= Colin |last3= Waters |first4= Peter |last4= Haff |first5= Cath |last5= Neal |first6= Simon James |last6= Price}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A January 2016 report on the climatic, biological, and geochemical signatures of human activity in sediments and ice cores suggested the era since the mid-20th century should be recognised as a distinct geological epoch from the [[Holocene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = The Anthropocene is functionally and stratigraphically distinct from the Holocene |url = http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6269/aad2622 |journal = Science |date = 8 January 2016 |issn = 0036-8075 |pmid = 26744408 |pages = aad2622 |volume = 351 |issue = 6269 |doi = 10.1126/science.aad2622 |first = Colin N. |last = Waters |first2 = Jan |last2 = Zalasiewicz |first3 = Colin |last3 = Summerhayes |first4 = Anthony D. |last4 = Barnosky |first5 = Clément |last5 = Poirier |first6 = Agnieszka |last6 = Gałuszka |first7 = Alejandro |last7 = Cearreta |first8 = Matt |last8 = Edgeworth |first9 = Erle C. |last9 = Ellis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anthropocene Working Group met in Oslo in April 2016 to consolidate evidence supporting the argument for the Anthropocene as a true geologic epoch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://quaternary.stratigraphy.org/workinggroups/anthropocene/|title= Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy – Working Group on the 'Anthropocene'|publisher= [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]]|accessdate= 28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence was evaluated and the group voted to recommend "Anthropocene" as the new geological age in August 2016.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Should the International Commission on Stratigraphy approve the recommendation, the proposal to adopt the term will have to be ratified by the International Union of Geological Sciences before its formal adoption as part of the [[geologic time scale]].&lt;ref name="Gixmodo001"&gt;

==Etymology==
{{Human timeline}}{{Life timeline}}
The name ''Anthropocene'' is a combination of ''[[wikt:anthropo-#English|anthropo-]]'' from ''anthropos'' ({{lang-grc|ἄνθρωπος}}) meaning "human" and ''[[wikt:-cene#English|-cene]]'' from ''kainos'' ({{lang-grc|καινός}}) meaning "new" or "recent."&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)/nqrwpos|ἄνθρωπος}}, {{LSJ|kaino/s|καινός|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|-cene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1873, the Italian geologist [[Antonio Stoppani]] acknowledged the increasing power and effect of humanity on the Earth's systems and referred to an 'anthropozoic era'.&lt;ref name="Crutzen02"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Crutzen | first=P. J. | title=Geology of mankind | journal=Nature | volume=415 | date=2002 | page=23 | url=http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1038%2F415023a | doi=10.1038/415023a | pmid=11780095 | issue=6867|bibcode = 2002Natur.415...23C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the biologist [[Eugene Stoermer]] is often credited with coining the term "anthropocene", it was in informal use in the mid-1970s. [[Paul Crutzen]] is credited with independently re-inventing and popularizing it.

===Homogenocene===
'''Homogenocene''' (from old Greek: [[wikt:Homo-#English|homo-]], ''same'' [[wikt:geno-#English|geno-]], ''kind'', '''kainos-''', ''new'' and [[wikt:-cene#English|-cene]], ''period'') is a more specific term used to define our current [[Geologic time scale|geological]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]], in which [[#Biodiversity|biodiversity]] is diminishing and [[#Biogeography|biogeography]] and [[ecosystems]] around the globe seem more and more similar to one another mainly due to [[invasive species]] that have been introduced around the globe either on purpose (crops, livestock) or inadvertently.

The term Homogenocene was first used by Michael Samways in his editorial article in the ''Journal of Insect Conservation'' from 1999 titled "Translocating fauna to foreign lands: here comes the Homogenocene."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Climate===
{{main|Anthropogenic climate change}}
{{main|Anthropocene extinction}}
One geological symptom resulting from human activity is increasing [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] [[carbon dioxide]] (CO{{sub|2}}) content. During the [[ice age|glacial–interglacial]] cycles of the past million years, natural processes have varied CO{{sub|2}} by approximately 100 [[Parts per million|ppm]] (from 180 ppm to 280 ppm). {{As of|2013}}, anthropogenic net emissions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increased atmospheric concentration by a comparable amount from 280 ppm (Holocene or pre-industrial "equilibrium") to approximately 400 ppm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/global.html|title=ESRL Global Monitoring Division - Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network|author=ESRL Web Team|work=noaa.gov|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 2015&amp;ndash;16 monthly monitoring data of CO{{sub|2}} displaying a rising trend above 400 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/|title=NASA Global Climate Change - Vital Signs of the Planet - Facts - Carbon Dioxide|date=7 November 2016|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This signal in the Earth's climate system is especially significant because it is occurring much faster,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5314592.stm|date=4 September 2006|title=Deep ice tells long climate story|work=BBC News|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to a greater extent, than previous, similar changes. Most of this increase is due to the [[combustion]] of [[fossil fuel]]s such as [[coal]], [[Petroleum|oil]], and [[Natural gas|gas]], although smaller fractions are the result of [[cement]] production and land-use changes (e.g. [[deforestation]]).

===Geomorphology===
Changes in drainage patterns traceable to human activity will persist over geologic time in large parts of the continents where the geologic regime is erosional.  This includes the paths of roads and highways defined by their grading and drainage control. Direct changes to the form of the Earth's surface by human activities (e.g., quarrying, landscaping) also record human impacts.

It has been suggested the deposition of [[calthemite]] formations are one example of a natural process which has not previously occurred prior to the human modification of the Earth's surface, and therefore represents a unique process of the Anthropocene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dixon|first=Simon J|last2=Viles|first2=Heather A|last3=Garrett|first3=Bradley L|title=Ozymandias in the Anthropocene: the city as an emerging landform|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/area.12358/abstract|date=21 June 2017|journal=Area|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/area.12358|issn=1475-4762}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calthemite is a secondary deposit, derived from [[concrete]], [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] or other calcareous material ''outside the [[cave]] environment''.&lt;ref name=SmithGK2016&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=G.

===Stratigraphy===

====Sedimentological record====
Human activities like deforestation and road construction are believed to have elevated average total sediment fluxes across the Earth's surface.&lt;ref name="Science2016" /&gt; However, construction of dams on many rivers around the world means the rates of sediment deposition in any given place do not always appear to increase in the Anthropocene. For instance, many [[river delta]]s around the world are actually currently starved of sediment by such dams, and are subsiding and failing to keep up with sea level rise, rather than growing.&lt;ref name="Science2016" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Giosan|first1=L.|last2=Syvitski|first2=J.

====Fossil record====
Increases in erosion due to farming and other operations will be reflected by changes in sediment composition and increases in deposition rates elsewhere. In land areas with a depositional regime, engineered structures will tend to be buried and preserved, along with litter and debris. Litter and debris thrown from boats or carried by rivers and creeks will accumulate in the marine environment, particularly in coastal areas. Such manmade artifacts preserved in stratigraphy are known as "technofossils."&lt;ref name="Science2016" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=H.V.|last1=Cabadas-Báez|first2=S.|last2=Sedov|first3=S|last3=Jiménez-Álvarez|first4=D|last4=Leonard|first5=B.|last5=Lailson-Tinoco|first6=R.|last6=García-Moll|first7=I.|last7=Ancona-Aragón|first8=L.|last8=Hernández|date=2017|title=Soils as a source of raw materials for ancient ceramic production in the Maya region of Mexico: Micromorphological insight|url=http://boletinsgm.igeolcu.unam.mx/bsgm/vols/epoca04/7001/%282%29Cabadas.pdf|journal=Boletín de la Sociedad Geológica Mexicana|volume=70|issue=1|pages=21–48|doi=10.18268/BSGM2018v70n1a2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in biodiversity will also be reflected in the fossil record, as will species introductions.  An example cited is the domestic chicken, originally the [[red junglefowl]] ''Gallus gallus'', native to south-east Asia but has since become the world's most common bird through human breeding and consumption, with over 60 billion consumed a year and whose bones would become fossilized in landfill sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/domestic-chicken-anthropocene-humanity-influenced-epoch |title=How the domestic chicken rose to define the Anthropocene |first=Damian |last=Carrington|date= 31 August 2016 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trace elements====
In terms of trace elements, there are distinct signatures left by modern societies. For example, in the [[Upper Fremont Glacier]] in Wyoming, there is a layer of [[chlorine]] present in ice cores from 1960's atomic weapon testing programs, as well as a layer of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] associated with [[coal]] plants in the 1980s. From 1945 to 1951, [[nuclear fallout]] is found locally around atomic device test sites, whereas from 1952 to 1980, tests of [[thermonuclear]] devices have left a clear, global signal of excess {{SimpleNuclide2|carbon|14}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|plutonium|239}}, and other artificial [[radionuclide]]s. The highest global concentration of radionuclides was in 1965, one of the dates which has been proposed as a possible benchmark for the start of the formally defined Anthropocene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global peak in atmospheric radiocarbon provides a potential definition for the onset of the Anthropocene Epoch in 1965|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20970-5|website=[[Scientific Reports]]|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human burning of [[fossil fuel]]s has also left distinctly elevated concentrations of black carbon, inorganic ash, and spherical carbonaceous particles in recent sediments across the world. Concentrations of these components increases markedly and almost simultaneously around the world beginning around 1950.&lt;ref name="Science2016" /&gt;

The Anthropocene Working Group voted on the "Base/beginning of the Anthropocene", and most members favored some time around 1950.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/press-releases/2016/august/media-note-anthropocene-working-group-awg|title=Media note: Anthropocene Working Group (AWG)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=University of Leicester|access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This time period has also been referred to as the [[Great Acceleration]].

==="Early anthropocene" model ===
{{Main|Early anthropocene}}
While much of the environmental change occurring on Earth is suspected to be a direct consequence of the [[Industrial Revolution]], [[William Ruddiman]] has argued that the proposed Anthropocene began approximately 8,000 years ago with the development of farming and sedentary cultures. At this point, humans were dispersed across all of the continents (except [[Antarctica]]), and the [[Neolithic Revolution]] was ongoing. During this period, humans developed [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]] to supplement or replace [[hunter-gatherer]] subsistence. Such innovations were followed by a wave of [[extinction]]s, beginning with large [[mammal]]s and land [[bird]]s. This wave was driven by both the direct activity of humans (e.g. hunting) and the indirect consequences of land-use change for agriculture.

A plausible starting point of the Anthropocene could be at ''ca.'' 2,000 years ago,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} which roughly coincides with the start of the final phase of [[Holocene]], the [[Subatlantic]].&lt;ref name="Certini01"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Anthropogenic soils are the golden spikes for the Anthropocene |author= Certini, G. |author2= Scalenghe, R. |last-author-amp= yes |date= 2011 |doi= 10.1177/0959683611408454|journal= The Holocene|volume= 21 |issue= 8 |pages= 1269–1274|bibcode= 2011Holoc..21.1269C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, the [[Roman Empire]] encompassed large portions of [[Europe]], the Middle East, and North Africa. In [[China]] the [[Han Dynasty|classical dynasties]] were flowering. The [[Middle kingdoms of India]] had already the [[largest economy]] of the ancient and medieval world. The Napata/Meroitic kingdom extended over the current [[Sudan]] and [[Ethiopia]]. The [[Olmec]]s controlled central [[Mexico]] and [[Guatemala]], and the pre-Incan Chavín people managed areas of northern [[Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/world-history-beginnings/ancient-americas/a/andean-and-chavn-civilizations-article|title=Andean and Chavín civilizations|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although often apart from each other and intermixed with buffering ecosystems, the areas directly impacted by these civilizations and others were large. Additionally, some activities, such as mining, implied much more widespread perturbation of natural conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Greenland ice evidence of hemispheric lead pollution two millennia ago by Greek and Roman civilizations |author= Hong, S. |author2= Candelone, J-P. |author3= Patterson, C. C. |author4= Boutron C.

They have taken advantage of global environmental conditions not of their own making.The end of the [[last glacial period]] – when as much as 30% of Earth's surface was ice-bound – led to a warmer world with more water ({{H2O}}). Although humans existed in the previous Pleistocene epoch, it is only in the recent Holocene period that they have flourished. Today there are more humans alive than at any previous point in Earth's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castree|first=Noel|year=2015|title=The anthropocene: a primer for geographers|url=https://2017.moodle.maynoothuniversity.ie/pluginfile.php/487483/mod_resource/content/1/Castree%20The%20Anthropocene.pdf|journal=geography|volume= 100|pages=66|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial Revolution===
Crutzen proposed the [[Industrial Revolution]] as the start of Anthropocene.&lt;ref name="Crutzen02" /&gt; Lovelock proposes that the Anthropocene began with the first application of the [[Newcomen atmospheric engine]] in 1712. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] takes the pre-industrial era (chosen as the year 1750) as the baseline related to changes in long-lived, well mixed greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aggi/aggi.html|title=NOAA/ESRL Global Monitoring Division - THE NOAA ANNUAL GREENHOUSE GAS INDEX (AGGI)|last=Laboratory|first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA, Earth System Research|website=www.esrl.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is apparent that the Industrial Revolution ushered in an unprecedented global human impact on the planet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Industry, environment and health through 200 years in Manchester |author= Douglas, I. |author2= Hodgson, R. |author3= Lawson, N. |last-author-amp= yes |year= 2002 |doi= 10.1016/S0921-8009(02)00029-0 |journal= Ecological Economics |volume= 41 |issue= 2 |pages= 235–255}}&lt;/ref&gt; much of Earth's landscape already had been profoundly modified by human activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Holocene record |author= Kirch, P. V. |year= 2005 |doi= 10.1146/annurev.energy.29.102403.140700 |journal= Annual Review of Environment and Resources |volume= 30 |issue= 1 |pages= 409–440}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human impact on Earth has grown progressively, with few substantial slowdowns.

=== Anthropocene marker ===
A marker that accounts for a substantial global impact of humans on the total environment, comparable in scale to those associated with significant perturbations of the geological past, is needed in place of minor changes in atmosphere composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Response to 'The Anthropocene forces us to reconsider adaptationist models of human-environment interactions' |author= Zalasiewicz, J. |author2= Williams, M. |author3= Steffen, W. |author4= Crutzen, P. J. |last-author-amp= yes |year= 2010 |doi= 10.1021/es102062w |journal= Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume= 44 |issue= 16 |page= 6008|bibcode = 2010EnST...44.6008Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Stratigraphy of the Anthropocene |author= Zalasiewicz, J. |year= 2011 |doi= 10.1098/rsta.2010.0315 |journal= Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A |volume= 369 |issue= 1938 |pages= 1036–1055|bibcode = 2011RSPTA.369.1036Z |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A useful candidate for this purpose is the [[pedosphere]], which can retain information of its climatic and geochemical history with features lasting for centuries or millennia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Humanity's transformation of Earth's soil: pedology's new frontier |author= Richter, D. deB. |year= 2007 |doi= 10.1097/ss.0b013e3181586bb7 |journal= Soil Science |volume= 172 |issue= 12 |pages= 957–967|bibcode= 2007SoilS.172..957R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human activity is now firmly established as the sixth factor of soil formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The place of humans in the state factor theory of ecosystems and their soils |author= Amundson, R. |author2= Jenny, H. |last-author-amp= yes |date= 1991 |journal= Soil Science |volume= 151 |issue= 1 |pages= 99–109 |doi=10.1097/00010694-199101000-00012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It affects pedogenesis either directly, by, for example, land levelling, trenching and embankment building for various purposes, organic matter enrichment from additions of manure or other waste, organic matter impoverishment due to continued cultivation, compaction from overgrazing or, indirectly, by drift of eroded materials or pollutants. Anthropogenic soils are those markedly affected by human activities, such as repeated ploughing, the addition of fertilizers, contamination, sealing, or enrichment with artefacts (in the [[World Reference Base for Soil Resources]] they are classified as [[Anthrosols]] and [[Technosols]]). They are recalcitrant repositories of artefacts and properties that testify to the dominance of the human impact, and hence appear to be reliable markers for the Anthropocene. Some anthropogenic soils may be viewed as the 'golden spikes' of geologists ([[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point]]), which are locations where there are strata successions with clear evidences of a worldwide event, including the appearance of distinctive fossils.&lt;ref name="Certini01" /&gt; Drilling for fossil fuels has also created holes and tubes which are expected to be detectable for millions of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldofideas.wbur.org/2015/03/29/mcneill|title=The Advent of the Anthropocene: Was That the Big Story of the 20th Century?|work=worldofideas|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In culture==
The concept of the Anthropocene has also been approached via humanities such as philosophy, literature and art. In the scholarly world, it has been the subject of increasing attention through special journal issues,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 34| issue = 2| editor = Timothy Clark| title = Special Issue: Deconstruction in the Anthropocene| journal = Oxford Literary Review| accessdate = 21 July 2014| date = 1 December 2012| url = http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/olr.2012.0039| doi=10.3366/olr.2012.0039| pages=v–vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; conferences,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| author = Humanities Research Centre, Australian National University| title = Anthropocene Humanities: The 2012 Annual Meeting of the Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes| location = Canberra, Australia| accessdate = 21 July 2014| date = 13 June 2012| url = http://chcinetwork.org/anthropocene-humanities/| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140831221523/http://chcinetwork.org/anthropocene-humanities/| archivedate = 31 August 2014| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| author = Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society at LMU-Munich| last2 = Alexander von Humboldt Transatlantic Network in the Environmental Humanities| title = Culture and the Anthropocene| location = Munich, Germany| accessdate = 21 July 2014| date = 14 June 2013| url = http://www.carsoncenter.uni-muenchen.de/events_conf_seminars/event_history/2013/2013_conf_ws_sem/130614_cult_anthrop/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and disciplinary reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = American Comparative Literature Association| last = Wenzel| first = Jennifer| title = State of the Discipline Report: Ideas of the Decade| chapter = Climate Change| accessdate = 21 July 2014| date = 13 March 2014| chapterurl = http://stateofthediscipline.acla.org/entry/climate-change}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Anthropocene, its attendant timescale, and ecological implications prompts questions about death and the ends of civilization,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Scranton| first = Roy| title = Learning How to Die in the Anthropocene| work = New York Times: Opinionator| accessdate = 17 July 2014| date = 10 November 2013| url = http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/learning-how-to-die-in-the-anthropocene/}}&lt;/ref&gt; memory and archives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Colebrook| first = Claire| title = The Anthropocene and the Archive| work = The Memory Network: Exchanges| accessdate = 21 July 2014| date = 27 January 2014| url = http://thememorynetwork.net/the-anthropocene-and-the-archive/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the scope and methods of humanistic inquiry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Nowviskie| first = Bethany| title = digital humanities in the anthropocene| work = nowviskie.org| accessdate = 10 July 2014| date = 10 July 2014| url = http://nowviskie.org/2014/anthropocene/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and emotional responses to the "end of nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Ronda| first = Margaret| title = Mourning and Melancholia in the Anthropocene| journal = Post45| accessdate = 21 July 2014| date = 10 June 2013| url = http://post45.research.yale.edu/2013/06/mourning-and-melancholia-in-the-anthropocene/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been also criticized as an ideological construct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Andreas|last=Malm|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/03/anthropocene-capitalism-climate-change/|title=The Anthropocene Myth|magazine=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some environmentalists on the political left suggest that "Capitalocene" is a more historically appropriate term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anthropocene or Capitalocene?

An '''automatic transmission system''' (or occasionally '''automated transmission system''', to avoid confusion with the [[automatic transmission]] of an [[automobile]]) is an [[automate]]d [[system]] designed to keep a radio [[transmitter]] and [[antenna (radio)|antenna system]] running without direct human oversight or attention for long periods.  

==History==
In the early days of radio, an [[operator (profession)|operator]], [[technician]] or [[electrical engineer]] was required to attend to a transmitter at any time it was operating or capable of operating. Any condition (such as [[harmonic distortion|distorted]] or [[frequency|off-frequency]] transmission) which could interfere with other radio services would require immediate manual intervention; facilities also had to be monitored for any fault conditions which could impair the transmitted signal or cause damage to the transmitting equipment.

As [[technology]] improved, transmitters became more reliable, and [[electromechanical]] means of checking and later correcting problems became commonplace.  [[Regulation]]s eventually caught up with these advances, and [[radio station]]s (both [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] and non-broadcast, such as [[amateur radio]] [[repeater]]s) were allowed to run unattended provided that there was such an '''ATS''' installed.

==Theory of operation==
The system monitors conditions such as [[voltage]], [[current (electricity)|current]], and [[temperature]] within the transmitter cabinet or enclosure, and often has external [[sensor]]s as well, particularly on the antenna.  Some systems have remote monitoring points which report back to the main unit though [[telemetry]] links, particularly for lower [[radio frequencies]] like [[AM radio]] where [[radio propagation|propagation]] changes from day to night.  

Advanced systems can monitor and often correct other problems which are considered [[mission-critical]], such as detecting ice on antenna elements or [[radome]]s and turning on heaters to prevent the [[VSWR]] (power reflected from a mismatched antenna back into the transmitter) from going too high.  High-power stations which use [[desiccation]] [[pump]]s to put dry [[nitrogen]] into their [[feedline]] (to displace moisture for increased [[electrical efficiency|efficiency]]) can also monitor the [[pressure]].  [[Electrical generator|Generator]]s, [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], and incoming [[electricity]] can also be monitored.

If anything goes wrong which the ATS cannot handle, it can send out calls for help, via [[pager]], [[telephone]] [[voice message]], or [[transmitter/studio link|dedicated telemetry link]]s back to a fixed point such as a broadcast [[studio]].  Other than possibly listening for [[dead air]] from the [[studio/transmitter link]], an ATS does ''not'' cover the programming or the studio equipment like [[broadcast automation]], but rather only the "[[transmitter plant]]".

A '''challenge''' can serve as a dare or an exhortation, motivating a person or persons by "[a]n invitation or summons to a trial or contest of any kind" and thus to "a difficult or demanding task, esp[ecially] one seen as a test of one's abilities or character".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite OED | challenge}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, speakers or writers can use challenges to [[motivation | motivate]] - to convince people "to perform an action they otherwise [might] not".&lt;ref&gt; 
Compare https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/challenge
&lt;/ref&gt;
A challenge can thus become a [[Rhetorical device | tool]] of [[rhetoric]]: a '''rhetorical challenge'''.&lt;ref&gt;

[...] Recall how one of the more notable traces of Morris's influence on the speech was his organization  of an anaphoric structure based on the command, 'I challenge.' Through this device, the speaker could shift from describing issues into a mode of exhortation, epitomized by the repetition of 'I challenge' twenty-five times, and its context-specific entailments - for example, 'I urge,' 'I invite,' and so on.

The '''Città della Scienza''' ("city of science") is a museum in [[Naples]], in [[Campania]] in southern Italy. It was opened to the public in 1996 and features various areas in which one can explore and learn about science, natural phenomena, and hosts a wide large number of science exhibits and culture events. It is also a promoter for sustainable technologies activities and enterprises.
Its structures are located in [[Bagnoli]], the ex [[industrial district]] in [[Naples]], and its nucleus was built in a 19th-century workshops industry archeological site.

==History==
The museum was built by a public-private foundation called "Fondazione IDIS" in 1985–1996. Città della Scienza grew to become one of the most visited museums of Naples and actually is included into the list of “NGOs in official relation”  with [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ngo-db.unesco.org/r/or/en/1122273500&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idis.cittadellascienza.it/?p=21772{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archivio.denaro.it/VisArticolo.aspx?IdArt=617976&amp;KeyW= |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401082726/http://archivio.denaro.it/VisArticolo.aspx?IdArt=617976&amp;KeyW= |archivedate=1 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous Science Centre has been destroyed during a fire arson on 4 March 2013. The science area for kids was the first to be rebuilt and it is actually open to public.
Being de facto destroyed and almost non functioning, Città della Scienza foundation communicates with public thanks to Facebook,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/cittadellascienza?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts&lt;/ref&gt; its website and Derev (for crowdfunding).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.derev.com/revolution/ricostruiamo-citta-della-scienza/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130408215133/https://www.derev.com/revolution/ricostruiamo-citta-della-scienza/ |archivedate=8 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various initiatives (either public and private) were created to collect funding to rebuild completely the whole museum. In April a part of Science Center has been reopened to public.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cittadellascienza.it/notizie/11-aprile-riapertura-per-le-scuole/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cittadellascienza.it/notizie/domenica-14-aprile-ricominciamo-insieme-grande-festa-dedicata-ai-visitatori/&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three principal areas but, during the fire, the previous Science Centre was destroyed.: 
* [[Science museum#Science_center|Science center]], the first Italian scientific interactive museum. Now composed by: Corporea (traveling in the human body), 'The sea', children’s workshop and a Planetarium &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cittadellascienza.it/science-centre-en/?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;
* Training and development
* Events area

'''Clinical clerkships''' encompass a period of [[medical education]] in which students – [[medical student|medical]], [[nursing school|nursing]], [[dentistry school|dental]], or otherwise – practice medicine under the supervision of a health practitioner.&lt;ref name="unm-glossary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unm.edu/~unmreg/Curriculum/ScheduleTypeGlossary1-9-06.htm |title=Clinical clerkship |work=UNM Course Type Glossary |accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical clerkships ==
In [[medical education]], a '''clerkship''', or '''rotation''', refers to the practice of [[medicine]] by [[medical students]] ([[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]], [[Doctor of Podiatric Medicine|D.P.M]]) during their final year(s) of study. Traditionally, the first half of [[medical school]] trains students in the classroom setting, and the second half takes place in a [[teaching hospital]]. Clerkships give students experiences in all parts of the hospital setting, including the [[operating room]], [[emergency department]], and various other departments that allow learning by viewing and doing.

During this training, students are required to rotate through different [[medical specialties]] and treat [[patient]]s under the supervision of [[physicians]].  Students elicit [[medical history|patient histories]], complete [[physical examination]]s, write [[progress note]]s, and assist in [[surgery|surgeries]] and [[medical procedure]]s. The work hours are that of a full-time job, generally similar to that of [[residency (medicine)|residents]]. Students may also be required to work on weekends and to be on call.
For [[medical student]]s, [[Clerkship (medicine)|clerkships]] occur after the [[basic science]] curriculum, and are supervised by medical specialists at a [[teaching hospital]] or [[medical school]]. Typically, certain clerkships are required to obtain the [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree or the [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] degree in the United States (e.g., [[internal medicine]], [[surgery]], [[pediatrics]]), while others are elective (e.g., [[dermatology]], [[pathology]], and [[neurology]]).

The intent of the clinical clerkship is to teach the medical student the fundamentals of clinical examination, evaluation, and care provision, and to enable the student to select the course of further study. During the clinical clerkship, the medical student will interact with real patients much as a [[physician]] does, but their evaluation and recommendations will be reviewed and approved by more senior physicians.

===United States===
In the United States, [[Medical school in the United States|medical school]] typically lasts four years.  Medical students spend the third and fourth years rotating through a combination of required clerkship and electives.  Most medical schools require rotations in [[internal medicine]], [[surgery]], [[pediatrics]], [[psychiatry]], [[obstetrics and gynecology]], [[family medicine]], [[radiology]], and [[neurology]].  Some schools additionally require [[emergency medicine]] and [[intensive-care medicine]].  Furthermore, a common graduation requirement is to complete a [[sub-internship]] in a specialty, where the medical student acts as an [[internship (medicine)|intern]].

The '''Columbia Water Center''' ('''CWC''') was established in January 2008 as a branch of the [[Earth Institute]] at [[Columbia University]]. The center focuses on researching and addressing global water-related challenges, including [[water scarcity]], access, quality and climate risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthinstitute.columbia.edu/articles/view/2125 |title=The Earth Institute Water |publisher=[[Earth Institute]] |author= |date= |accessdate=2009-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center's stated mission is to "creatively tackle water challenges of a rapidly changing world where water and climate interact with food, energy, ecosystems and urbanization," by combining "the rigor of scientific research with the impact of effective policy."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/about-us/|title=Columbia Water Center: About Us |publisher=Columbia Water Center |author= |date= |accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Columbia Water Center takes a multidisciplinary approach to water challenges, employing [[hydrologists]], [[climatologists]], [[environmental engineer]]s, and [[water policy]] analysts. The Director of the center is Upmanu Lall, the Carol Silberstein Professor of Earth and Environmental Engineering and Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics at Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/2757  |title=The Earth Institute Profiles: Upmanu Lall |publisher=[[Earth Institute]] |author= |date= |accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierre Gentine, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering, also takes a leading role in the center, with his own PhD and Post-doctoral team focusing on the interactions between soil and atmospheric moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~pg2328/Website/Pierre_Gentines_Homepage/Lab.html|title=Gentine Lab website|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earth water and sky"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2011/05/11/earth-water-and-sky-a-conversation-with-pierre-gentine-a-new-columbia-water-center-scientist/|title=Earth, Water and Sky –A Conversation with Pierre Gentine, a new Columbia Water Center Scientist|date=11 May 2011|last=Polycarpou|first=Lakis|publisher=State of the planet|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The center currently divides its projects into five themes, America's Water, The Global Floods Initiative, Data Analytics and Multi-Scale Predictions, Risk and Financial Instruments and the Water, Food, Energy Nexus.&lt;ref name="research themes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/  |title=The Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |publisher=Columbia Water Center |author= |date= |accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Earth Institute, under the leadership of [[Jeff Sachs]], is a research institution that supports sustainable development from various angles.&lt;ref name="Earth Institute"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/2021|title=PepsiCo Foundation announces major new grant to the Earth Institute at Columbia University to promote global water sustainability |publisher=[[Earth Institute]]|date=22 January 2008|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[PepsiCo]] Foundation awarded the [[Earth Institute]] $6 million to address these water-related issues. The PepsiCo grant led to the establishment of the Columbia Water Center under the leadership of Columbia University engineering professor Upmanu Lall.  This three-year grant made possible projects in four countries: India, China, Mali, and Brazil.&lt;ref name="Earth Institute"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pepsico.com/Purpose/Environmental-Sustainability/Water|title=Our planet sustainability efforts and goals|publisher=PepsiCo|accessdate=5 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001095523/http://www.pepsico.com/Purpose/Environmental-Sustainability/Water|archivedate=1 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil, CWC has partnered with the [[Federal University of Ceará]] in the northeast to focus on sophisticated climate-based forecasting systems used for water allocation decisions across diverse use sectors.  In addition, the CWC team recently completed a municipal water plan (PAM) for Milhã, a rural area in central Ceará. The project outlines a plan for the municipality to deliver water to all of its 14,000 residents.

As part of the project, the CWC designed and built water infrastructure demonstration projects for Ingá and Pedra Fina, two communities in Milhã. The project provides water to 500 people in the area.&lt;ref name="CWC Article"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.america.gov/st/energy-english/2010/June/20100528161751kjleinad0.6077082.html |title=Columbia Water Center at Work Across Globe |publisher=America.gov |author=Carrie Loewenthal Massey |date=2010-06-01 |accessdate=2010-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, the project focuses on reducing water consumption in the agricultural sector by encouraging sustainable crop choice patterns, as well as working with corporations to deploy better [[irrigation]] technologies (and increase reliability) throughout their supply chains.  A key objective is to reduce the [[overdrafting|groundwater stress]] in the region. Primary project locations are in the states of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref name="Circleofblue"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2010/world/qa-upmanu-lall-gives-insight-to-indias-nexus-of-energy-food-and-water?CP.rss=true |title=U.S., India Working Together to Address India’s Water Needs |publisher=Circle of Blue Water News|author=J. Carl Ganter |date=2010-06-04 |accessdate=2011-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Punjab, the CWC has partnered with [[Punjab Agricultural University]] to come up with innovative solutions to reduce farmer irrigation. Some of the methods developed (including the use of inexpensive [[Tensiometer (soil science)|tensiometers]] to measure soil moisture and direct seeding of rice) were field tested in the 2010 planting season with over 500 farmers participating.&lt;ref name="India"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.america.gov/st/energy-english/2010/May/20100528153333kjleinad0.4795191.html?CP.rss=true |title=U.S., India Working Together to Address India’s Water Needs |publisher=America.gov |author=Carrie Loewenthal Massey |date=2010-05-28 |accessdate=2010-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Punjab Agricultural University team reports that participating farmers saved 25 to 30 percent of their normal water use by implementing the new approaches. The CWC/PAU team plans to scale up the pilot project in 2011 by recruiting 5,000 rice farmers to use tensiometers.&lt;ref name="tensiometer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2010/11/17/%E2%80%9Csmall-is-also-beautiful%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-appropriate-technology-cuts-rice-famers%E2%80%99-water-use-by-30-percent-in-punjab-india/?CP.rss=true |title=‘Small is Also Beautiful’ – Appropriate Technology Cuts Rice Famers’ Water Use by 30 Percent in Punjab, India |publisher=blogs.ei.columbia.edu |author=Lakis Polycarpou |date=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Gujarat, the Columbia Water Center is working with the state government to reform [[subsidies in India|electricity subsidies]] to provide a greater incentive for farmers to conserve water. In conjunction with subsidy reform, the CWC is also piloting water saving technologies among farmers.&lt;ref name="WaterWideWeb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waterwideweb.org/incentives-for-water-conservation-in-guajarat.html#comments |title=Incentives for Water Conservation in Gujarat |publisher=WaterWideWeb.org |author=Eryn-Ashlei Bailey |date=2010-12-03 |accessdate=2011-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110502164844/http://www.waterwideweb.org/incentives-for-water-conservation-in-guajarat.html#comments |archivedate=2011-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work in Mali coincides with the [[Millennium Villages Project]]. CWC is focusing on designing irrigation and cropping systems that can be operated and maintained locally in order to provide farmers with higher-value cash crops. The center has installed large pumps that improved the amount of water available.  Projects emphasize bringing together local partners, [[market forces]] and [[public-private partnership]]s.

==Current Research ==

In recent years, the Columbia Water Center has expanded the scope of its initiatives to encompass five broad research themes.&lt;ref name="research themes" /&gt;

===[http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/americas-water/ America's Water]===

The America’s Water Initiative is aims to build a network of academic institutions, government agencies, and private industry to inform water infrastructure improvements in the United States and address other water challenges. The initiative focuses on all aspects of water, from policy to drought and flood forecasting and the potential for disruptive water technology to provide distributed water infrastructure that is less expensive than replacing legacy systems.&lt;ref name="America's Water"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/americas-water/ |title=Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |location=America's water |publisher=The Columbia Water Center |accessdate=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 2015, the initiative held its first annual symposium, which brought together water experts from various groups, representing the industry, utilities, policy and non-profit sectors among others. The meeting was intended to be a first step toward a broader working relationship that can help set a water research agenda and develop solutions for national water challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://piscesfoundation.org/partnering-with-academia-to-address-u-s-water-challenges/|title=Partnering with Academia to Address U.S. Water Challenges|date=13 March 2013|accessdate=5 April 2017|last=Stoner|first=Nancy|publisher=Pisces Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2015/03/19/waking-up-to-americas-water-challenges/|title=Waking up to America’s Water Challenges|date=19 March 2015|publisher=State of the Planet|last=Polycarpou|first=Lakis|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/global-floods-initiative/ The Global Floods Initiative]===

The Global Floods Initiative aims to apply cutting-edge and continually evolving  climate forecasting techniques to help helping policymakers, disaster relief agencies, infrastructure designers, financial institutions and others better prepare for, manage and respond to extreme floods.&lt;ref name="Global Floods Initiative 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/global-floods-initiative/ |title=Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |location=Global floods initiative |publisher=The Columbia Water Center |accessdate=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earth water and sky" /&gt;

The initiative builds on almost two decades of research on how the quasi-periodic climate cycles (such as El-Nino/La-Nina and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) interact to increase the risk of flooding in particular locations. More recent research into hydrometerology, which looks at the interaction of land, water and atmosphere at a more local scale, adds additional layers to the potential for flood prediction.&lt;ref name="research themes" /&gt;

===[http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/data-analytics-and-multi-scale-predictions/ Data Analytics and Multi-Scale Predictions]===

The Columbia Water Center is a leader in predicting seasonal hydroclimate forecasts and associated risk analyses. These forecasts are used for a variety of applications, including integrating climate forecasts into water allocation procedures for urban, industrial and agricultural consumers.&lt;ref name="Data Analytics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/data-analytics-and-multi-scale-predictions/ |title=Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |location=Data analytics and multi-scale predictions |publisher=The Columbia Water Center |accessdate=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New ways of representing convection and vegetation response to water stress are also major areas of research, the results of which could offer new understandings of the carbon and hydrological cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/data-analytics-and-multi-scale-predictions/5115-2/|title=Predictions, Surface Energy, Plants: Understanding the Hydrologic Cycle|publisher=Columbia Water Center|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/risk-and-financial-instruments/ Risk and Financial Instruments]===

Climate forecasting can also be used to develop flood and drought risk metrics for companies with global supply chains. These metrics can help companies address challenges through new sourcing strategies, novel regional financial risk management products (e.g., cat bonds, index insurance), pre-emptive maintenance and mitigation, reservoir reallocation agreements and other tools.&lt;ref name="Risk and Financial Instruments"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/risk-and-financial-instruments/ |title=Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |location=Risk and finantial instruments |publisher=The Columbia Water Center |accessdate=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/water-food-energy-nexus/ Water, Food, Energy Nexus]===

The Columbia Water Center  studies how the water, food, and energy sectors are interrelated and how climate affects this relationship. Projects include policy research and recommendations to  promote water and energy savings in the agricultural sector in water-stressed farming regions, development of seasonal forecasts to guide decision-making in the water and energy sectors, and testing and implementation of low-cost soil moisture and nitrogen sensors to improve irrigation efficiency, reducing fertilizer use and [[groundwater pollution]] and saving energy from groundwater pumping.&lt;ref name="Water, Food, Energy Nexus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/water-food-energy-nexus/ |title=Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |location=Water, food, energy nexus |publisher=The Columbia Water Center |accessdate=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Circleofblue" /&gt;

'''Complexity''' characterises the behaviour of a [[system]] or [[model (disambiguation)|model]] whose components interact in multiple ways and follow local rules, meaning there is no reasonable higher instruction to define the various possible interactions.&lt;ref name="steven"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is generally used to characterize something with many parts where those parts interact with each other in multiple ways, culminating in a higher order of [[emergence]] greater than the sum of its parts. The study of these complex linkages at various scales is the main goal of [[complex systems theory]].

[[Science]] {{as of | 2010 | lc = on}} takes a number of approaches to characterizing complexity; Zayed ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
reflect many of these. [[Neil F. Johnson|Neil Johnson]] states that "even among scientists, there is no unique definition of complexity – and the scientific notion has traditionally been conveyed using particular examples..."  Ultimately Johnson adopts the definition of "complexity science" as "the study of the phenomena which emerge from a collection of interacting objects".&lt;ref name="Neil Johnson"&gt;{{cite book

== Overview ==
Definitions of complexity often depend on the concept of a confidential "[[system]]" – a set of parts or elements that have relationships among them differentiated from relationships with other elements outside the relational regime. Many definitions tend to postulate or assume that complexity expresses a condition of numerous elements in a system and numerous forms of relationships among the elements. However, what one sees as complex and what one sees as simple is relative and changes with time.

[[Warren Weaver]] posited in 1948 two forms of complexity: disorganized complexity, and organized complexity.&lt;ref name=Weaver&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;
Phenomena of 'disorganized complexity' are treated using probability theory and statistical mechanics, while 'organized complexity' deals with phenomena that escape such approaches and confront "dealing simultaneously with a sizable number of factors which are interrelated into an organic whole".&lt;ref name=Weaver/&gt; Weaver's 1948 paper has influenced subsequent thinking about complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

The approaches that embody concepts of systems, multiple elements, multiple relational regimes, and state spaces might be summarized as implying that complexity arises from the number of distinguishable relational regimes (and their associated state spaces) in a defined system.

Some definitions relate to the algorithmic basis for the expression of a complex phenomenon or model or mathematical expression, as later set out herein.

== Disorganized vs. organized ==
One of the problems in addressing complexity issues has been formalizing the intuitive conceptual distinction between the large number of variances in relationships extant in random collections, and the sometimes large, but smaller, number of relationships between elements in systems where constraints (related to correlation of otherwise independent elements) simultaneously reduce the variations from element independence and create distinguishable regimes of more-uniform, or correlated, relationships, or interactions.

Weaver perceived and addressed this problem, in at least a preliminary way, in drawing a distinction between "disorganized complexity" and "organized complexity".

In Weaver's view, disorganized complexity results from the particular system having a very large number of parts, say millions of parts, or many more. Though the interactions of the parts in a "disorganized complexity" situation can be seen as largely random, the properties of the system as a whole can be understood by using probability and statistical methods.

A prime example of disorganized complexity is a gas in a container, with the gas molecules as the parts. Some would suggest that a system of disorganized complexity may be compared with the (relative) [[simplicity]] of planetary orbits – the latter can be predicted by applying [[Newton's laws of motion]]. Of course, most real-world systems, including planetary orbits, eventually become theoretically unpredictable even using Newtonian dynamics; as discovered by modern [[chaos theory]].&lt;ref&gt;"Sir James Lighthill and Modern Fluid Mechanics", by Lokenath Debnath, The University of Texas-Pan American, US, Imperial College Press: {{ISBN|978-1-84816-113-9}}: {{ISBN|1-84816-113-1}}, Singapore, page 31. Online at http://cs5594.userapi.com/u11728334/docs/25eb2e1350a5/Lokenath_Debnath_Sir_James_Lighthill_and_mode.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organized complexity, in Weaver's view, resides in nothing else than the non-random, or correlated, interaction between the parts. These correlated relationships create a differentiated structure that can, as a system, interact with other systems. The coordinated system manifests properties not carried or dictated by individual parts. The organized aspect of this form of complexity vis-a-vis to other systems than the subject system can be said to "emerge," without any "guiding hand".

The number of parts does not have to be very large for a particular system to have emergent properties. A system of organized complexity may be understood in its properties (behavior among the properties) through [[model (abstract)|modeling]] and [[simulation]], particularly [[computer simulation|modeling and simulation with computers]]. An example of organized complexity is a city neighborhood as a living mechanism, with the neighborhood people among the system's parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sources and factors ==
There are generally rules which can be invoked to explain the origin of complexity in a given system.

The source of disorganized complexity is the large number of parts in the system of interest, and the lack of correlation between elements in the system.

In the case of self-organizing living systems, usefully organized complexity comes from beneficially mutated organisms being selected to survive by their environment for their differential reproductive ability or at least success over inanimate matter or less organized complex organisms. See e.g. [[Robert Ulanowicz]]'s treatment of ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Ulanowicz, Robert, "Ecology, the Ascendant Perspective", Columbia, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Complexity of an object or system is a relative property. For instance, for many functions (problems), such a computational complexity as time of computation is smaller when multitape [[Turing machine]]s are used than when Turing machines with one tape are used. [[Random Access Machine]]s allow one to even more decrease time complexity (Greenlaw and Hoover 1998: 226), while inductive Turing machines can decrease even the complexity class of a function, language or set (Burgin 2005). This shows that tools of activity can be an important factor of complexity.

== Varied meanings ==
In several scientific fields, "complexity" has a precise meaning:

* In [[computational complexity theory]], the [[Computational resource|amounts of resources]] required for the execution of [[algorithm]]s is studied. The most popular types of computational complexity are the time complexity of a problem equal to the number of steps that it takes to solve an instance of the problem as a function of the [[problem size|size of the input]] (usually measured in bits), using the most efficient algorithm, and the space complexity of a problem equal to the volume of the [[computer storage|memory]] used by the algorithm (e.g., cells of the tape) that it takes to solve an instance of the problem as a function of the size of the input (usually measured in bits), using the most efficient algorithm. This allows classification of computational problems by [[complexity class]] (such as [[P (complexity)|P]], [[NP (complexity)|NP,]] etc.). An axiomatic approach to computational complexity was developed by [[Manuel Blum]]. It allows one to deduce many properties of concrete computational complexity measures, such as time complexity or space complexity, from properties of axiomatically defined measures.
* In [[algorithmic information theory]], the ''[[Kolmogorov complexity]]'' (also called ''descriptive complexity'', ''algorithmic complexity'' or ''algorithmic entropy'') of a [[string (computer science)|string]] is the length of the shortest binary [[computer program|program]] that outputs that string. [[Minimum message length]] is a practical application of this approach. Different kinds of Kolmogorov complexity are studied: the uniform complexity, prefix complexity, monotone complexity, time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity, and space-bounded Kolmogorov complexity. An axiomatic approach to Kolmogorov complexity based on [[Blum axioms]] (Blum 1967) was introduced by Mark Burgin in the paper presented for publication by [[Andrey Kolmogorov]].&lt;ref&gt;Burgin, M. (1982) Generalized Kolmogorov complexity and duality in theory of computations, Notices of the Russian Academy of Sciences, v.25, No. 3, pp. 19–23&lt;/ref&gt; The axiomatic approach encompasses other approaches to Kolmogorov complexity. It is possible to treat different kinds of Kolmogorov complexity as particular cases of axiomatically defined generalized Kolmogorov complexity. Instead of proving similar theorems, such as the basic invariance theorem, for each particular measure, it is possible to easily deduce all such results from one corresponding theorem proved in the axiomatic setting. This is a general advantage of the axiomatic approach in mathematics. The axiomatic approach to Kolmogorov complexity was further developed in the book (Burgin 2005) and applied to software metrics (Burgin and Debnath, 2003; Debnath and Burgin, 2003).
* In [[information processing]], complexity is a measure of the total number of [[property|properties]] transmitted by an object and detected by an [[observation|observer]]. Such a collection of properties is often referred to as a [[state (computer science)|state]].
* In [[physical systems]], complexity is a measure of the [[probability]] of the [[Quantum state|state vector]] of the system. This should not be confused with [[entropy (statistical thermodynamics)|entropy]]; it is a distinct mathematical measure, one in which two distinct states are never conflated and considered equal, as is done for the notion of entropy in [[statistical mechanics]].
* In [[mathematics]], [[Krohn–Rhodes complexity]] is an important topic in the study of finite [[semigroup]]s and [[automata theory|automata]].
* In [[Network theory]] complexity is the product of richness in the connections between components of a system,&lt;ref&gt;A complex network analysis example: "[http://www.martingrandjean.ch/complex-structures-and-international-organizations/ Complex Structures and International Organizations]" ({{Cite journal | volume = | issue = 2| last = Grandjean| first = Martin| title = Analisi e visualizzazioni delle reti in storia. L'esempio della cooperazione intellettuale della Società delle Nazioni | journal = Memoria e Ricerca | date = 2017| pages = 371–393| url = https://www.rivisteweb.it/doi/10.14647/87204 | doi = 10.14647/87204}} See also: [https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01610098v2 French version]).&lt;/ref&gt; and defined by a very unequal distribution of certain measures (some elements being highly connected and some very few, see [[complex network]]). 
* In [[software engineering]], [[programming complexity]] is a measure of the interactions of the various elements of the software. This differs from the computational complexity described above in that it is a measure of the design of the software.
* In [[Abstract and concrete|abstract]] sense – Abstract Complexity, is based on visual structures [[perception]] &lt;ref&gt;Mariusz Stanowski (2011) Abstract Complexity Definition, Complicity 2, p.78-83 [https://ejournals.library.ualberta.ca/index.php/complicity/article/view/11156]&lt;/ref&gt; It is complexity of binary string defined as a square of features number divided by number of elements (0's and 1's). Features comprise here all distinctive arrangements of 0's and 1's. Though the features number have to be always approximated the definition is precise and meet intuitive criterion.

Other fields introduce less precisely defined notions of complexity:

* A [[complex adaptive system]] has some or all of the following attributes:&lt;ref name="Neil Johnson" /&gt;
** The number of parts (and types of parts) in the system and the number of relations between the parts is non-trivial – however, there is no general rule to separate "trivial" from "non-trivial";
** The system has memory or includes [[feedback]];
** The system can adapt itself according to its history or feedback;
** The relations between the system and its environment are non-trivial or non-linear;
** The system can be influenced by, or can adapt itself to, its environment;
** The system is highly sensitive to initial conditions.

== Study ==
Complexity has always been a part of our environment, and therefore many scientific fields have dealt with complex systems and phenomena. From one perspective, that which is somehow complex – displaying variation without being [[randomness|random]] – is most worthy of interest given the rewards found in the depths of exploration.

The use of the term complex is often confused with the term complicated. In today's systems, this is the difference between myriad connecting "stovepipes" and effective "integrated" solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lissack, Michael R.]]; [[Johan Roos]] (2000). ''The Next Common Sense, The e-Manager's Guide to Mastering Complexity.'' Intercultural Press. {{ISBN|978-1-85788-235-3}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; This means that complex is the opposite of independent, while complicated is the opposite of simple.

While this has led some fields to come up with specific definitions of complexity, there is a more recent movement to regroup observations [[interdisciplinarity|from different fields]] to study complexity in itself, whether it appears in [[anthill]]s, [[human brain]]s, or [[stock market]]s, social systems&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/30193748/Complexics_as_a_Meta-Transdisciplinary_Field|title=Complexics as a meta-transdisciplinary field|last=Bastardas-Boada|first=Albert|date=|website=Academia.edu|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One such interdisciplinary group of fields is [[relational order theories]].

== Topics ==

=== Behaviour ===
The behavior of a complex system is often said to be due to emergence and [[self-organization]]. Chaos theory has investigated the sensitivity of systems to variations in initial conditions as one cause of complex behaviour.

===Mechanisms ===
Recent developments around [[artificial life]], [[evolutionary computation]] and [[genetic algorithm]]s have led to an increasing emphasis on complexity and [[complex adaptive systems]].

=== Simulations ===
In [[social science]], the study on the emergence of macro-properties from the micro-properties, also known as macro-micro view in [[sociology]]. The topic is commonly recognized as [[social complexity]] that is often related to the use of computer simulation in social science, i.e.: [[computational sociology]].

=== Systems ===
{{main article|Complex system}}
[[Systems theory]] has long been concerned with the study of [[complex system]]s (in recent times, ''complexity theory'' and ''complex systems'' have also been used as names of the field). These systems are present in the research of a variety disciplines, including [[biology]], [[economics]], social studies and [[technology]]. Recently, complexity has become a natural domain of interest of real world socio-cognitive systems and emerging [[systemics]] research. Complex systems tend to be high-[[dimension]]al, [[non-linearity|non-linear]], and difficult to model. In specific circumstances, they may exhibit low-dimensional behaviour.

=== Data ===
In [[information theory]], algorithmic information theory is concerned with the complexity of strings of data.

Complex strings are harder to compress. While intuition tells us that this may depend on the [[codec]] used to compress a string (a codec could be theoretically created in any arbitrary language, including one in which the very small command "X" could cause the computer to output a very complicated string like "18995316"), any two [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]] languages can be implemented in each other, meaning that the length of two encodings in different languages will vary by at most the length of the "translation" language – which will end up being negligible for sufficiently large data strings.

These algorithmic measures of complexity tend to assign high values to [[signal noise|random noise]]. However, those studying complex systems would not consider randomness as complexity{{who|date=October 2013}}.

[[Information entropy]] is also sometimes used in information theory as indicative of complexity.

Recent work in [[machine learning]] has examined the complexity of the data as it affects the performance of [[Supervised learning|supervised]] classification algorithms. Ho and Basu present a set of [[Computational complexity theory|complexity measures]] for [[binary classification]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;Ho, T.K.; Basu, M. (2002). "[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=990132&amp;tag=1 Complexity Measures of Supervised Classification Problems]". IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 24 (3), pp 289–300.&lt;/ref&gt;

The complexity measures broadly cover:
* the overlaps in feature values from differing classes.
* the separability of the classes.
* measures of geometry, topology, and density of [[manifold]]s. Instance hardness is another approach seeks to characterize the data complexity with the goal of determining how hard a data set is to classify correctly and is not limited to binary problems.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M.R.; Martinez, T.; Giraud-Carrier, C. (2014). "[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10994-013-5422-z An Instance Level Analysis of Data Complexity]". Machine Learning, 95(2): 225–256.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Instance hardness is a bottom-up approach that first seeks to identify instances that are likely to be misclassified (or, in other words, which instances are the most complex). The characteristics of the instances that are likely to be misclassified are then measured based on the output from a set of hardness measures. The hardness measures are based on several supervised learning techniques such as measuring the number of disagreeing neighbors or the likelihood of the assigned class label given the input features. The information provided by the complexity measures has been examined for use in [[Meta learning (computer science)|meta learning]] to determine for which data sets filtering (or removing suspected noisy instances from the training set) is the most beneficial&lt;ref&gt;Saez, J.; Luengo, J.; Herrera, F. (2013). "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320312003251 Predicting Noise Filtering Efficacy with Data Complexity Measures for Nearest Neighbor Classification]". Pattern Recognition 46 (1) pp 355–364.&lt;/ref&gt; and could be expanded to other areas.

=== In molecular recognition ===
A recent study based on molecular simulations and compliance constants describes [[molecular recognition]] as a phenomenon of organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Complexity in molecular recognition | author=Jorg Grunenberg | journal=Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. | year=2011 | volume=13 | pages= 10136–10146 | doi=10.1039/c1cp20097f}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even for small molecules like [[carbohydrates]], the recognition process can not be predicted or designed even assuming that each individual [[hydrogen bond]]'s strength is exactly known.

== Applications ==
Computational complexity theory is the study of the complexity of problems – that is, the difficulty of [[problem solving|solving]] them. Problems can be classified by complexity class according to the time it takes for an algorithm – usually a computer program – to solve them as a function of the problem size. Some problems are difficult to solve, while others are easy. For example, some difficult problems need algorithms that take an exponential amount of time in terms of the size of the problem to solve. Take the [[travelling salesman problem]], for example. It can be solved in time &lt;math&gt;O(n^2 2^n)&lt;/math&gt; (where ''n'' is the size of the network to visit – the number of cities the travelling salesman must visit exactly once). As the size of the network of cities grows, the time needed to find the route grows (more than) exponentially.

Even though a problem may be computationally solvable in principle, in actual practice it may not be that simple. These problems might require large amounts of time or an inordinate amount of space. [[Analysis of algorithms|Computational complexity]] may be approached from many different aspects. Computational complexity can be investigated on the basis of time, memory or other resources used to solve the problem. Time and space are two of the most important and popular considerations when problems of complexity are analyzed.

There exist a certain class of problems that although they are solvable in principle they require so much time or space that it is not practical to attempt to solve them. These problems are called [[Computational complexity theory#Intractability|intractable]].

There is another form of complexity called [[Model of hierarchical complexity|hierarchical complexity]]. It is orthogonal to the forms of complexity discussed so far, which are called horizontal complexity.

'''Dance science''' is the scientific study of [[dance]] and dancers, as well as the practical application of scientific principles to dance. Its aims are the enhancement of [[performance]], the reduction of [[injury]], and the improvement of [[well-being]] and [[health]].

[[Dance and health|Dance medicine and science]] as a field of study developed in the 1970s and 80s out of the field of [[sports medicine]]. In the early 1980s, the American Dance Festival (ADF) started including dance medicine courses in their course work for dancers. When ADF moved to Duke University, physicians from Duke University Hospital became interested in dancers. Then, in 1990, the International Association for Dance Medicine and Science ([[IADMS]])  was formed by an international group of dance medicine practitioners, dance educators, dance scientists, and dancers. Membership of IADMS began with 48 members in 1991, and has grown to over 900 members in 35 countries as of 2016.&lt;ref name=IADMSabout&gt;{{cite web|author=International Association for Dance Medicine &amp; Science |url=http://www.iadms.org/?page=A8 |title=About IADMS |publisher=iadms.org |accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dance science as an academic discipline has been evolving over the past 20 years.{{when|date=November 2018}} In the United Kingdom, three degrees (at master's level) now exist: one at the University of Bedfordshire,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beds.ac.uk/howtoapply/courses/postgraduate/next-year/dance-science University of Bedfordshire]&lt;/ref&gt; one at the [[University of Wolverhampton]], and one at the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in London. With regards to dance science research, another UK institution which has staff and students active in the area is [[the University of Birmingham]].   Some undergraduate degrees in dance, or other dance courses, also include one or several modules in dance science, with the aim of promoting healthy dance practices. These include the [[University of Wolverhampton]], the [[Royal Academy of Dance]], and [[Bird College]].

Several universities in the United States also offer dance science courses as part of their dance curriculum, accommodating both undergraduate and graduate level students. These include, but are not limited to: Cornish College of the Arts, Columbia College of Chicago, California State - Long Beach, Elon University, Florida State University, [[Goucher College]], Long Island University - Brooklyn Campus, Ohio State University, Ohio University, UCLA - Irvine, University of Colorado, University of Illinois - Urbana Champagne, and the University of Oregon.

Typically, the subject areas within dance science are similar to those studied in "[[sports science]]", though naturally with a focus on dance and the special considerations that this involves. They include: [[physiology]], [[anatomy]], [[kinesiology]], [[psychology]], [[biomechanics]], [[nutrition]], and similar. However, unlike sports science, dance science sometimes also studies related topics such as [[creativity]] and somatic techniques, including the practices of [[Pilates]], [[yoga]], [[Alexander technique]], [[Feldenkrais method]], etc.

Some dance companies employ dance scientists to provide support services, such as physiological testing, psychological support, conditioning and nutritional counseling. Such professionals include physical therapists, nutritionists, pilates instructors, massage therapists, and dance medicine physicians. Dancers that are not employed by a dance company that offers rehabilitation benefits on-site can sometimes have access to such facilities within their city of residence. Dancers in New York City have access to The Harkness Center for Dance Injuries, located at the NYU-Hospital for Joint Diseases, NYU Langone Medical Center, which offers many subsidized and free services for the dance community. These services include "clinics staffed by orthopedists and dance physical therapists; state-of-the art research and rehabilitation technology and free injury prevention screenings and lectures."  Westside Physical Therapy, directed and founded by Marika Molnar - the first physical therapist hired by the New York City Ballet - is another example of a physical therapy clinic in New York City that offers specialized care to dancers (as well as to non-dancers).

The largest organization promoting dance science internationally is the International Association for Dance Medicine and Science ([[IADMS]]). As well as producing a scientific peer-reviewed journal, ''Journal of Dance Medicine and Science'', it also holds an annual conference. The Performing Arts Medicine Association (PAMA), which holds its annual symposium in Aspen-Snowmass, Colorado, is a unique organization that concerns itself with the injuries and health issues of musicians as well as dancers. In the UK, DanceUK is perhaps the foremost proponent of dance science and healthy dance practice more generally. A conference entitled "From Cognition to Conditioning" was held at [[Middlesex University]] in February 2007.

===United States===
After working with [[Goupil &amp; Cie]] in [[Paris]],&lt;ref name=es /&gt; Carel received an offer to work as an advisor and restorer with art dealing institution [[Knoedler]] &amp; Co, and departed for the [[United States]] in 1911.&lt;ref name=ob /&gt; During his time with Knoedler &amp; Co., and subsequently at the independent practice on [[Fifth Avenue]] he opened in 1916, he worked closely with American [[industrialists]] [[Henry Clay Frick]], [[Joseph Widener]],&lt;ref name=wf&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date={{date|1918-12-14|mdy}} |title=That Phila.

==Derix de Wild==
After Carel's departure for the [[United States]] in 1911, the Haarlem Committee of Supervision nominated his older brother, Derix, to continue restoring the city's twelve Hals group portraits.&lt;ref name=ac /&gt;&lt;ref name=ba&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Wild |first1=Derix |last2= |first2= |date={{date|1924-9|mdy}} |title=The Cleaning of the Frans Hals Pictures at Haarlem |url= |journal=Bulletin of the Bachstitz Gallery |volume=7 |issue=8 |pages= |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Carel, he worked at the [[Mauritshuis]], developing a close professional relationship with then-director [[Wilhelm Martin]] that led to several collaborative projects, often scientific in nature. For example, in July 1916, in response to a threat of [[chemical attack]], they tested the effects of [[lye]] on a series of "dummy" paintings in order to discover which brand of fire extinguisher was best suited to saving an artwork.&lt;ref name=ac /&gt; Derix is also thought to have assisted Martin in his publications on conservation and restoration.&lt;ref name=ac /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Martin |first1=Wilhelm |last2= |first2= |date={{date|1916-10|mdy}} |title=Over conserveeren en restaureeren van oude schilderijen |url= |journal=Oude Kunst |volume= |issue= |pages=1–9 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his continuation of the Hals project at [[Haarlem]], he brought in the chemist Gosen Van der Sleen to aid in his analysis. This was the first known case in the Netherlands of a chemist advising on a painting restoration project.&lt;ref name=ac /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levy-van Halm |first=J |editor-last=Schweizerischer Verband für Konservierung der Kunsthistoriker in der Schweiz; Nationale Informationsstelle für Kulturgüter-Ehraltung |editor-first= |title=Geschichte der Restaurierung in Europa : Akten des internationalen Kongresses "Restauriergeschichte", Interlaken 1989 |publisher=Worms: Wernersche Verlagsgesellschaft |date=1991 |pages=105–07 |chapter=Zur Geschichte der Restaurierung in Holland, eine Skizze |isbn=3884620827}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Van der Sleen's approval, he continued the restoration as planned, working with his son A.M., nephew C. F. Louis, and brother Carel to re-varnish the paintings.&lt;ref name=ac /&gt; Although he published little himself, save for an article in the [[Kurt Walter Bachstitz]] Gallery Bulletin, he remained well-occupied with his restoration business in the Hague until his death on December 4, 1932.&lt;ref name=ba /&gt;&lt;ref name=ac /&gt;

==A. Martin de Wild==
[[File:A-Martin-de-Wild-from-The-Hague-352107479016.jpg|thumb|upright|A. Martin de Wild in 1947.]]
Angenitus Martin de Wild, known as A. M. or Martin, was Derix de Wild's son. He sought to further the chemical approach to restoration promoted by his father and uncle. To this end, he enrolled at the [[Delft University of Technology]], completing a doctorate degree in [[inorganic chemistry]] in 1928.&lt;ref name=he&gt;{{cite book |last=Tromp |first=Henk |date=2010 |title=A Real Van Gogh: How the Art World Struggles with Truth |url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/R/bo10497630.html |location=Amsterdam |publisher=Amsterdam University Press |page= |isbn=9089641769 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''The Scientific Examination of Pictures,'' originally completed as part of his chemistry thesis, was soon published internationally.&lt;ref name=he /&gt;&lt;ref name=sc&gt;{{cite book |last=Wild, de |first=A.

Bell and Sons, Ltd |page= |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking paint samples from a variety of European masterpieces, he studied the chemical makeup of synthetic pigments used in oil painting over time. After Martin's death, the book was considered a "landmark" for its technical analysis of pigmentation.&lt;ref name=amo&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=April 1969 |title=Angenitus Martin de Wild |jstor=3179096 |journal=Bulletin of the American Group: International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=9 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin's heavily technical method of art analysis and formal chemical training were a relative novelty. He went on to some renown for his involvement in forgery trials throughout the 1930s and 1940s, including the highly publicized [[Otto Wacker]] trial in 1932 and the [[Han van Meegeren]] trial in 1946.&lt;ref name=he /&gt; He lectured at the [[University of Utrecht]] from 1938 until 1947.&lt;ref name=ac /&gt; Working privately in his studio in the Hague, Martin published widely until his death in 1969, often collaborating with colleagues from the Delft University of Technology and the [[International Institute for Conservation]].&lt;ref name=amo /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Wild |first1=A.M. |last2=Cursiter |first2=S. |date=1937 |title=Picture Relining |url= |journal=Technical Studies in the Field of Fine Arts |volume= |issue= |pages= 161–178|doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Wild |first1=A.M. |last2=Froentejes |first2=W |date=October 1950 |title=A Forged Frans Hals |jstor=870559 |journal=The Burlington Magazine |volume=92 |issue=571 |pages= 296–297 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Wild |first1=A.M. |last2= |first2= |date=1964 |title=Wiederfestigung von Leinwand und Bildschicht |url= |journal=Maltechnik |volume=4 |issue= |pages=97–111 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Wild |first1=A.M. |last2= |first2= |date=May 1959 |title=A Vacuum Re-Lining Apparatus for General Use |jstor=1504889 |journal=Studies in Conservation |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=i |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==C. F. Louis de Wild==
Carel de Wild's son C. F. Louis trained with his uncle Derix for much of his youth, eventually establishing his own restoration practice.&lt;ref name=ac /&gt;&lt;ref name=cob&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=C.

He worked in conjunction with American museums like the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the [[National Gallery of Art]], and, like his father before him, the [[Frick Collection]]. Notable paintings he restored include the [[Alba Madonna]] and multiple works by [[Piero della Francesca]]. He retired from his conservation practice in 1969, and passed away in 1987 at the age of 86.&lt;ref name=cob /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7560">'''''Delegata potestas non potest delegari''''' is a principle in  [[constitutional law|constitutional]] and [[administrative law]] that means in [[Latin]] that "no [[subdelegate|delegated]] powers can be further delegated." Alternatively, it can be stated '''''delegatus non potest delegare''''' ("one to whom power is [[delegate]]d cannot himself further delegate that power").&lt;ref name="Mullan_368"&gt;Mullan, D.J. (2001) Essentials of Canadian Law: Administrative Law. Toronto: Irwin Law. {{ISBN|1-55221-009-X}}. p. 368&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle is present in several [[jurisdictions]] such as that of the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[India]] as well as in [[canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic canon law]].

==Canada==
The principle was first articulated in [[Canada]] in 1943, in an article in the ''Canadian Bar Review'' by John Willis. While it is acknowledged as "the seminal articulation of the law governing the subdelegation of statutory and discretionary powers"&lt;ref name="Mullan_368"/&gt; and it is still often cited,&lt;ref&gt;''Comeau's Sea Foods Ltd. v. Canada (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 12''&lt;/ref&gt; it has not achieved the rigid standing that was originally intended. The maxim has had some success as an operating principle in the restriction of delegation of legislative and judicial powers, but the demands of modern governmental regulatory practices have inhibited its application in the delegation of administrative powers.&lt;ref name="Mullan_368"/&gt; Exceptions are rare and dependent on the statute conferring power.&lt;ref&gt;Mullan, D.J. (2001) Essentials of Canadian Law: Administrative Law. Toronto: Irwin Law. {{ISBN|1-55221-009-X}}. p. 370&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ramawad v. Canada (Minister of manpower and Immigration) 2 S.C.R. 375''&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
In [[India]], the law was first stated in ''A K ROY v. State Of Punjab'', (1986) 4 SCC 326, that sub delegation of delegated power is ultra vires to the Enabling Act.&lt;ref&gt; (1986) 4 SCC 326 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document|last=manupatra|title=In Re: The Delhi Laws Act, 1912, the Ajmer-Merwara (Extension of Laws) Act, 1947 and the Part C States (Laws) Act, 1950|url=|publisher=Manupatra|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In [[United States]], one of the earliest mentions of the principle occurred when it was cited by counsel for one of the litigants before the [[Supreme Court of Pennsylvania]] in 1794, in ''M'Intire v. Cunningham'', 1 Yeates 363 (Pa. 1794). The summary of the case reports, "Mr. Wilson had given no power to Noarth to transact his business; but if he even had, it is a maxim, that delegata potestas non potest delegari."&lt;ref name=Cunningham&gt;''M'Intire v. Cunningham'', 1 Yeates 363 (Pa. 1794).&lt;/ref&gt;

The maxim was first cited by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''United States v. Sav. Bank'', 104 U.S. 728 (1881) in which the case summary reports that one of the litigants argued, "The duty imposed by statute on the commissioner cannot be delegated to a collector. Delegata potestas non potest delegari."&lt;ref name=SavBank&gt;''[http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/104/104.US.728.html United States v. Sav. Bank]'', 104 U.S. 728 (1881); ''see also'', ''[http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/276/276.US.394.242.html J. W. Hampton, Jr., &amp; Co. v. United States]'', 276 U.S. 394, 405-406 (U.S. 1928).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
In [[Australia]] the maxim has been largely superseded by [[Statute]] and [[common law]].&lt;ref&gt;M Aronson and M Groves, Judicial Review of Administrative Action (Thomson Lawbook Co, 2013) at 6.20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D C Pearce and S Argument, Delegated Legislation in Australia (Lexis Nexis, 2012) at 2.31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R Creyke &amp; J McMillan, Control of Government Action: Text, Cases and Commentary, (3rd ed, 2012.)&lt;/ref&gt;There is a long line of authorities applying the [[Carltona doctrine|Carltona principles]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Carltona doctrine|Carltona Ltd v Commissioners of Works]] [1943] 2 All ER 560.&lt;/ref&gt; to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly v State Bank of Victoria Commissioners  (1983) 153 CLR 1 at 11 and 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DPP v His Honor Judge Fricke [1993] 1 VR 361.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racecourse Co-operative Sugar Association Ltd v Attorney-General (Qld) [1979] HCA 50  per Gibbs J. at 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though courts have found that where a stature expressly requires a personal action, such delegation is not possible.&lt;ref&gt;Kutlu v Director of professional Services Review (2011)197 FCR 177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also Din v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs(1997) 147 ALR 673 at 682.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racecourse Co-operative Sugar Association Ltd v Attorney-General (Qld) [1979] HCA 50  per Gibbs J. at 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Dooney''&lt;ref&gt;Dooney v Henry (2000) 174 ALR 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[High Court of Australia]]([[Ian Callinan|Callinan J]]),&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Groves, H. P. Lee, Australian Administrative Law: Fundamentals, Principles and Doctrines ([[Cambridge University Press]], 2007)[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=XP2WI_VrBWgC&amp;pg=PA262&amp;lpg=PA262&amp;dq=No+permanent+head+of+a+department+in+the+Public+Service+is+expected+to+discharge+personally+all+the+duties+which+are+performed+in+his+name+and+for+which+he+is+accountable+to+the+responsible+Minister&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EJyfpPkKfb&amp;sig=vN4vEYRQBh4YGyxjlrZ2kpdCgFE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7qMWWitnWAhWJE7wKHdcWCawQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=No%20permanent%20head%20of%20a%20department%20in%20the%20Public%20Service%20is%20expected%20to%20discharge%20personally%20all%20the%20duties%20which%20are%20performed%20in%20his%20name%20and%20for%20which%20he%20is%20accountable%20to%20the%20responsible%20Minister&amp;f=false  p262].&lt;/ref&gt; observed that&lt;I&gt; "No permanent head of a department in the Public Service is expected to discharge personally all the duties which are performed in his name and for which he is accountable to the responsible Minister&lt;/I&gt;."

This caselaw has been backed up by [[legislation]]. Section 34AA and 34AAB of the [[Government of Australia|federal government]]s &lt;i&gt;[[Acts Interpretation Act 1901]]&lt;/i&gt; clearly create a statutory power to delegate, contrary to the maxim. The federal legislation is echoed in some state legislation &lt;ref&gt;See for example &lt;I&gt;The Interpretation Act 1987&lt;/I&gt; of [[New South Wales]]  section 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Acts Interpretation Act 1915 ([[South Australia|SA]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interpretation Act 1918 ([[Western Australia|WA]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catholic canon law==
{{canon law}}
Canon 137 of the ''[[1983 Code of Canon Law]]'' states:

:§ 1 Ordinary executive power can be delegated either for an individual case or for all cases, unless the law expressly provides otherwise.

:§ 2 Executive power delegated by the [[Holy See|Apostolic See]] can be subdelegated, either for an individual case or for all cases, unless the delegation was deliberately given to the individual alone, or unless subdelegation was expressly prohibited.

:§ 3 Executive power delegated by another authority having ordinary power, if delegated for all cases, can be subdelegated only for individual cases; if delegated for a determinate act or acts, it cannot be subdelegated, except by the express grant of the person delegating.

:§ 4 No subdelegated power can again be subdelegated, unless this was expressly granted by the person delegating.

'''Dialectic''' or '''dialectics''' ({{lang-grc-gre|διαλεκτική}}, ''dialektikḗ''; related to [[dialogue]]), also known as the '''dialectical method''', is at base a [[discourse]] between two or more people holding different [[Opinion|points of view]] about a subject but wishing to establish the [[truth]] through [[Rationality|reasoned]] arguments. Dialectic resembles [[debate]], but the concept excludes subjective elements such as emotional appeal and the modern [[pejorative]] sense of [[rhetoric]].&lt;ref&gt;see [[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]], 449B: "Socrates: Would you be willing then, Gorgias, to continue the discussion as we are now doing [Dialectic], by way of question and answer, and to put off to another occasion the (emotional) speeches [Rhetoric] that [the Sophist] Polus began?"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Corbett|first=Edward P.

Dialectic is alternatively known as minor [[logic]], as opposed to major [[logic]] or [[critique]].

Within [[Hegelianism]], the word ''dialectic'' has the specialised meaning of a [[contradiction]] between ideas that serves as the determining factor in their relationship. Dialectic comprises three stages of development: first, a thesis or statement of an idea, which gives rise to a second step, a reaction or antithesis that contradicts or negates the thesis, and third, the synthesis, a statement through which the differences between the two points is resolved. [[Dialectical materialism]], a theory or set of theories produced mainly by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], adapted the Hegelian dialectic into arguments regarding traditional [[materialism]].

Dialectic tends to imply a ''process'' of evolution and so does not naturally fit within [[formal logic]] (see [[logic and dialectic]]). This process is particularly marked in Hegelian dialectic and even more so in Marxist dialectic which may rely on the evolution of ideas over longer time periods in the real world; [[dialectical logic]] attempts to address this.

== Western dialectical forms ==
=== Classical philosophy ===
In [[Classical Greece|classical]] [[philosophy]], dialectic ({{lang|el|διαλεκτική}}) is a form of reasoning based upon dialogue of arguments and counter-arguments, advocating ''[[proposition]]s'' ([[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|theses]]) and ''counter-propositions'' ([[antithesis|antitheses]]). The outcome of such a dialectic might be the refutation of a relevant proposition, or of a synthesis, or a combination of the opposing assertions, or a qualitative improvement of the dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Ayer, A. J., &amp; O'Grady, J. (1992). ''A Dictionary of Philosophical Quotations''. Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishers. p. 484.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McTaggart, J. M. E. (1964). A commentary on Hegel's logic. New York: Russell &amp; Russell. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the term "dialectic" owes much of its prestige to its role in the philosophies of [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]], in the Greek [[Classical Greece|Classical]] period (5th to 4th centuries BCE). [[Aristotle]] said that it was the pre-Socratic philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]] who invented dialectic, of which the dialogues of Plato are the examples of the Socratic dialectical method.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]], IX 25ff and VIII 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], however, the ancient Greeks used the word "dialectic" to signify the logic of false appearance or semblance. To the Ancients, "it was nothing but the logic of illusion. It was a sophistic art of giving to one's ignorance, indeed even to one's intentional tricks, the outward appearance of truth, by imitating the thorough, accurate method which logic always requires, and by using its topic as a cloak for every empty assertion."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 61&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Socratic method ====
{{main|Socratic method}}
The [[Socratic dialogues]] are a particular form of dialectic known as the [[method of elenchus]] (literally, "refutation, scrutiny"&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/elenchus&lt;/ref&gt;) whereby a series of questions clarifies a more precise statement of a vague belief, logical consequences of that statement are explored, and a contradiction is discovered. The method is largely destructive, in that false belief is exposed&lt;ref&gt;https://open.conted.ox.ac.uk/sites/open.conted.ox.ac.uk/files/resources/Create%20Document/PLA_HO3_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and only constructive in that this exposure may lead to further search for truth. The detection of error does not amount to a proof of the antithesis; for example, a contradiction in the consequences of a definition of ''piety'' does not provide a correct definition. The principal aim of Socratic activity may be to improve the soul of the interlocutors, by freeing them from unrecognized errors; or indeed, by teaching them the spirit of inquiry.

In common cases, Socrates used [[enthymemes]] as the foundation of his argument.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

For example, in the ''[[Euthyphro]]'', Socrates asks [[Euthyphro (prophet)|Euthyphro]] to provide a definition of piety. Euthyphro replies that the pious is that which is loved by the gods. But, Socrates also has Euthyphro agreeing that the gods are quarrelsome and their quarrels, like human quarrels, concern objects of love or hatred. Therefore, Socrates reasons, at least one thing exists that certain gods love but other gods hate. Again, Euthyphro agrees. Socrates concludes that if Euthyphro's definition of piety is acceptable, then there must exist at least one thing that is both pious and impious (as it is both loved and hated by the gods)—which Euthyphro admits is absurd. Thus, Euthyphro is brought to a realization by this dialectical method that his definition of piety is not sufficiently meaningful.

For example, in Plato's Gorgias, dialectic occurs between Socrates, the Sophist Gorgias, and two men, Polus and Callicles. Because Socrates' ultimate goal was to reach true knowledge, he was even willing to change his own views in order to arrive at the truth. The fundamental goal of dialectic, in this instance, was to establish a precise definition of the subject (in this case, rhetoric) and with the use of argumentation and questioning, make the subject even more precise.  In the Gorgias, Socrates reaches the truth by asking a series of questions and in return, receiving short, clear answers.
    
There is another interpretation of the dialectic, as a method of intuition suggested in The Republic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper|Popper, K.]] (1962) [[The Open Society and its Enemies]], Volume 1, London, Routledge, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Blackburn writes that the dialectic in this sense is used to understand "the total process of enlightenment, whereby the philosopher is educated so as to achieve knowledge of the supreme good, the Form of the Good".&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Simon.  1996.  The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy.  Oxford: Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Aristotle ====
Aristotle stresses that rhetoric is closely related to dialectic. He offers several formulas to describe this affinity between the two disciplines: first of all, rhetoric is said to be a “counterpart” (antistrophos) to dialectic (Rhet. I.1, 1354a1); (ii) it is also called an “outgrowth” (paraphues ti) of dialectic and the study of character (Rhet. I.2, 1356a25f.); finally, Aristotle says that rhetoric is part of dialectic and resembles it (Rhet. I.2, 1356a30f.). In saying that rhetoric is a counterpart to dialectic, Aristotle obviously alludes to Plato's Gorgias (464bff.), where rhetoric is ironically defined as a counterpart to cookery in the soul. Since, in this passage, Plato uses the word ‘antistrophos’ to designate an analogy, it is likely that Aristotle wants to express a kind of analogy too: what dialectic is for the (private or academic) practice of attacking and maintaining an argument, rhetoric is for the (public) practice of defending oneself or accusing an opponent. The analogy to dialectic has important implications for the status of rhetoric. Plato argued in his Gorgias that rhetoric cannot be an art (technê), since it is not related to a definite subject, while real arts are defined by their specific subjects, as e.g. medicine or shoemaking are defined by their products, i.e., health and shoes.&lt;ref&gt;Rapp (2010). Aristotle's Rhetoric. Retrieved from http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-rhetoric/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval philosophy ===
Logic, which could be considered to include dialectic, was one of the three liberal arts taught in [[medieval universities]] as part of the [[trivium (education)|trivium]]; the other elements were [[rhetoric]] and [[grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;Abelson, P. (1965). The seven liberal arts; a study in mediæval culture. New York: Russell &amp; Russell. Page 82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, A., &amp; Walsh, J. J. (1983).

Based mainly on [[Aristotle]], the first medieval philosopher to work on dialectics was [[Boethius]] (480–524).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dA0YGAD1cQcC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=dialectics+in+Boethius&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_HccRhfdjX&amp;sig=-lqZuRDK4jXLpWiN8-X8Rn36F3o&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=KGv0S_L6J4P-8AaZs-zNDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=dialectics%20in%20Boethius&amp;f=false From topic to tale: logic and narrativity in the Middle Ages], by Eugene Vance,p.43-45&lt;/ref&gt; After him, many scholastic philosophers also made use of dialectics in their works, such as [[Abelard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01036b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Peter Abelard |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William of Sherwood]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=f3uMdwDVvL8C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=Dialectic+in+william+of+sherwood&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DgQ7rzGOrB&amp;sig=7KAHsosojbyBiA_Fe6KckbL_zlM&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=FGX0S8rTAYL68Aar5oijBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dialectical&amp;f=false William of Sherwood's Introduction to logic], by Norman Kretzmann,p.69-102&lt;/ref&gt; [[Garlandus Compotista]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7mcPcSuUa8EC&amp;pg=RA1-PA198&amp;lpg=RA1-PA198&amp;dq=Garlandus+Compotista+and+Dialectic+in+the+Eleventh+and+Twelfth+Centuries&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XkXFFyOASE&amp;sig=bH4YzmizXsgyd2LWo-QjTT5FB4o&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=F2b0S8eiB8H-8AbhrMCyAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Garlandus%20Compotista%20and%20Dialectic%20in%20the%20Eleventh%20and%20Twelfth%20Centuries&amp;f=false A History of Twelfth-Century Western Philosophy], by Peter Dronke,p.198&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Burley]], Roger Swyneshed, [[William of Ockham]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UnW7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=William+of+Ockham+dialectical+materialism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GRVgP3JXdO&amp;sig=KWQjQf8z5s0VMgVf5sqjIkWZgpk&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=Mmn0S4bqHMT38AablKj6Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=William%20of%20Ockham%20dialectical%20materialism&amp;f=false Medieval literary politics: shapes of ideology], by Sheila Delany,p.11&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14663b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: St. Thomas Aquinas |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This dialectic (a ''quaestio disputata'') was formed as follows:
# The question to be determined (“It is asked whether...”);
# A provisory answer to the question (“And it seems that...”);
# The principal arguments in favor of the provisory answer;
# An argument against the provisory answer, traditionally a single argument from authority ("On the contrary...");
# The determination of the question after weighing the evidence ("I answer that...");
# The replies to each of the initial objections. (“To the first, to the second etc., I answer that...”)

=== Modern philosophy ===
The concept of dialectics was given new life by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (following [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]), whose dialectically synthetic model of nature and of history made it, as it were, a fundamental aspect of the nature of reality (instead of regarding the contradictions into which dialectics leads as a sign of the sterility of the dialectical method, as [[Immanuel Kant]] tended to do in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, J. A. (1950). Philosophy of religion. New York: Ronald Press Co. Page 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kant, I., Guyer, P., &amp; Wood, A. W. (2003). [https://books.google.com/books?id=7bRychF0y0EC Critique of pure reason]. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Page 495.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-19th century, the concept of "dialectic" was appropriated by [[Karl Marx]] (see, for example, ''[[Das Kapital]]'', published in 1867) and [[Friedrich Engels]] and retooled in a dynamic, nonidealistic manner. It would also become a crucial part of later representations of Marxism as a philosophy of [[dialectical materialism]]. These representations often contrasted dramatically&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Lefebvre]]'s "humanist" dialectical materialism (''Dialectical Materialism'' [1940]) was composed to directly challenge [[Joseph Stalin]]'s own dogmatic text on dialectical materialism.&lt;/ref&gt; and led to vigorous debate among different Marxist groupings, leading some prominent Marxists to give up on the idea of dialectics completely.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the work of Louis Althusser in France and Galvano Della Volpe in Italy in the mid-20th century.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hegelian dialectic'''&lt;!-- Boldface per WP:R#PLA. --&gt;, usually presented in a threefold manner, was stated by [[Heinrich Moritz Chalybäus]]&lt;ref&gt;''Historische Entwicklung der spekulativen Philosophie von Kant bis Hegel'', Dresden-Leipzig (1837), p. 367 of the fourth edition (1848).&lt;/ref&gt; as comprising three dialectical stages of development: a [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|thesis]], giving rise to its reaction; an [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|antithesis]], which contradicts or negates the thesis; and the tension between the two being resolved by means of a [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]]. In more simplistic terms, one can consider it thus: problem → reaction → solution.  Although this model is often named after Hegel, he himself never used that specific formulation. Hegel ascribed that terminology to Kant.&lt;ref&gt;''The Accessible Hegel'' by Michael Allen Fox. Prometheus Books. 2005. p. 43. Also see Hegel's preface to the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', trans. A. V. Miller (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1977), secs. 50, 51, pp. 29. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Carrying on Kant's work, [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] greatly elaborated on the synthesis model and popularized it.

On the other hand, Hegel did use a three-valued logical model that is very similar to the antithesis model, but Hegel's most usual terms were: Abstract-Negative-Concrete. Hegel used this writing model as a backbone to accompany his points in many of his works.

The formula, thesis-antithesis-synthesis, does not explain why the thesis requires an antithesis. However, the formula, abstract-negative-concrete, suggests a flaw, or perhaps an incompleteness, in any initial thesis—it is too abstract and lacks the negative of trial, error, and experience. For Hegel, the concrete, the synthesis, the absolute, must always pass through the phase of the negative, in the journey to completion, that is, mediation. This is the essence of what is popularly called Hegelian dialectics.

According to the German philosopher [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;Fichte introduced into German philosophy the three-step of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, using these three terms. Schelling took up this terminology. ''Hegel did not.'' He never once used these three terms together to designate three stages in an argument or account in any of his books. And they do not help us understand his ''Phenomenology'', his ''Logic'', or his philosophy of history; they impede any open-minded comprehension of what he does by forcing it into a scheme which was available to him and which he deliberately spurned [...] The mechanical formalism [...] Hegel derides expressly and at some length in the preface to the ''Phenomenology''.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel: A Reinterpretation, 1966, Anchor Books, p.154)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Mueller (June 1958), "The Hegel Legend of 'Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis", 166ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kaufmann also cites Hegel's criticism of the triad model commonly misattributed to him, adding that "the only place where Hegel uses the three terms together occurs in his lectures on the history of philosophy, on the last page but one of the section on Kant—where Hegel roundly reproaches Kant for having 'everywhere posited thesis, antithesis, synthesis'".&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, ''Werke'', ed. Glockner, XIX, 610&lt;/ref&gt;

To describe the activity of overcoming the negative, Hegel also often used the term [[Aufheben|''Aufhebung'']], variously translated into English as "sublation" or "overcoming," to conceive of the working of the dialectic. Roughly, the term indicates preserving the useful portion of an idea, thing, society, etc., while moving beyond its limitations. ([[Jacques Derrida]]'s preferred French translation of the term was ''relever''.)&lt;ref&gt;See 'La différance' in: ''Margins of Philosophy''. Alan Bass, translator. University of Chicago Books. 1982. p. 19, fn 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Science of Logic|''Logic'']], for instance, Hegel describes a dialectic of [[existence]]: first, existence must be posited as pure Being (''Sein''); but pure Being, upon examination, is found to be indistinguishable from Nothing (''Nichts''). When it is realized that what is coming into being is, at the same time, also returning to nothing (in life, for example, one's living is also a dying), both Being and Nothing are united as Becoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hegel |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlbeing.htm#HL1_82 |title=Section in question from Hegel's ''Science of Logic'' |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the Socratic dialectic, Hegel claimed to proceed by making implicit contradictions explicit: each stage of the process is the product of contradictions inherent or implicit in the preceding stage. For Hegel, the whole of history is one tremendous dialectic, major stages of which chart a progression from self-alienation as [[Master-slave dialectic|slavery]] to self-unification and realization as the [[Rationality|rational]] [[constitutional state]] of free and equal citizens. The Hegelian dialectic cannot be mechanically applied for any chosen thesis. Critics argue that the selection of any antithesis, other than the logical negation of the thesis, is subjective. Then, if the logical negation is used as the antithesis, there is no rigorous way to derive a synthesis. In practice, when an antithesis is selected to suit the user's subjective purpose, the resulting "contradictions" are [[rhetoric]]al, not logical, and the resulting synthesis is not rigorously defensible against a multitude of other possible syntheses. The problem with the Fichtean "thesis–antithesis–synthesis" model is that it implies that contradictions or negations come from outside of things. Hegel's point is that they are inherent in and internal to things. This conception of dialectics derives ultimately from [[Heraclitus]].

Hegel stated that the purpose of dialectics is "to study things in their own being and movement and thus to demonstrate the finitude of the partial categories of understanding."&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich. 1874. ''The Logic''. ''Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences''. 2nd Edition. London: Oxford University Press. Note to §81&lt;/ref&gt;

One important dialectical principle for Hegel is the transition from quantity to quality, which he terms the Measure. The measure is the qualitative quantum, the quantum is the existence of quantity.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich. 1874. The Logic. Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences. 2nd Edition. London: Oxford University Press. §§107–111&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|The identity between quantity and quality, which is found in Measure, is at first only implicit, and not yet explicitly realised. In other words, these two categories, which unite in Measure, each claim an independent authority. On the one hand, the quantitative features of existence may be altered, without affecting its quality. On the other hand, this increase and diminution, immaterial though it be, has its limit, by exceeding which the quality suffers change. [...] But if the quantity present in measure exceeds a certain limit, the quality corresponding to it is also put in abeyance. This however is not a negation of quality altogether, but only of this definite quality, the place of which is at once occupied by another. This process of measure, which appears alternately as a mere change in quantity, and then as a sudden revulsion of quantity into quality, may be envisaged under the figure of a nodal (knotted) line.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich. 1874. The Logic. Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences. 2nd Edition. London: Oxford University Press. §§108–109&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As an example, Hegel mentions the states of aggregation of water: "Thus the temperature of water is, in the first place, a point of no consequence in respect of its liquidity: still with the increase or diminution of the temperature of the liquid water, there comes a point where this state of cohesion suffers a qualitative change, and the water is converted into steam or ice".&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich. 1874. The Logic. Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences. 2nd Edition. London: Oxford University Press. §108&lt;/ref&gt; As other examples Hegel mentions the reaching of a point where a single additional grain makes a heap of wheat; or where the bald tail is produced, if we continue plucking out single hairs.

Another important principle for Hegel is the negation of the negation, which he also terms ''Aufhebung'' (sublation): Something is only what it is in its relation to another, but by the negation of the negation this something incorporates the other into itself. The dialectical movement involves two moments that negate each other, something and its other. As a result of the negation of the negation, "something becomes its other; this other is itself something; therefore it likewise becomes an other, and so on ad infinitum".&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich. 1874. The Logic. Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences. 2nd Edition. London: Oxford University Press. §93&lt;/ref&gt; Something in its passage into other only joins with itself, it is self-related.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich. 1874. The Logic. Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences. 2nd Edition. London: Oxford University Press. §95&lt;/ref&gt; In becoming there are two moments:&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich. 1812. Hegel's Science of Logic. London. Allen &amp; Unwin. §§176–179.&lt;/ref&gt; coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be: by sublation, i.e., negation of the negation, being passes over into nothing, it ceases to be, but something new shows up, is coming to be. What is sublated (''aufgehoben'') on the one hand ceases to be and is put to an end, but on the other hand it is preserved and maintained.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich. 1812. Hegel's Science of Logic. London. Allen &amp; Unwin. §185.&lt;/ref&gt; In dialectics, a totality transforms itself; it is self-related, then self-forgetful, relieving the original tension.

==== Marxist dialectic ====&lt;!-- 'Marxist dialectic' redirects here. --&gt;
{{Marxism}}
{{Frankfurt School}}
Marxist dialectic is a form of Hegelian dialectic which applies to the study of [[historical materialism]]. It purports to be a reflection of the real world created by man. Dialectic would thus be a robust method under which one could examine personal, social, and economic behaviors. Marxist dialectic is the core foundation of the philosophy of [[dialectical materialism]], which forms the basis of the ideas behind historical materialism.

[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] proposed that Hegel's dialectic is too abstract: {{quote|The mystification which dialectic suffers in Hegel's hands, by no means prevents him from being the first to present its general form of working in a comprehensive and conscious manner. With him it is standing on its head. It must be turned right side up again, if you would discover the rational kernel within the mystical shell.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl (1873) ''Capital'' Afterword to the Second German Edition, Vol. I [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/p3.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In contradiction to Hegelian idealism, Marx presented his own dialectic method, which he claims to be "direct opposite" of Hegel's method: {{quote|My dialectic method is not only different from the Hegelian, but is its direct opposite. To Hegel, the life-process of the human brain, i.e. the process of thinking, which, under the name of 'the Idea', he even transforms into an independent subject, is the [[Demiurge|demiurgos]] of the real world, and the real world is only the external, phenomenal form of 'the Idea'. With me, on the contrary, the ideal is nothing else than the material world reflected by the human mind, and translated into forms of thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marx|first1=Karl|title=Afterword (Second German Ed.)|journal=Capital|volume=1|page=14|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/doc/Capital-Volume-I.doc|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

In Marxism, the dialectical method of historical study became intertwined with [[historical materialism]], the school of thought exemplified by the works of Marx, Engels, and [[Vladimir Lenin]]. In the USSR, under [[Joseph Stalin]], Marxist dialectics became "diamat" (short for dialectical materialism), a theory emphasizing the primacy of the material way of life; social "praxis" over all forms of social consciousness; and the secondary, dependent character of the "ideal". The term "dialectical materialism" was coined by the 19th-century social theorist [[Joseph Dietzgen]] who used the theory to explain the nature of [[socialism]] and social development. The original populariser of Marxism in Russia, [[Georgi Plekhanov]] used the terms "dialectical materialism" and "historical materialism" interchangeably. For Lenin, the primary feature of Marx's "dialectical materialism" (Lenin's term) was its application of materialist philosophy to history and social sciences. Lenin's main input in the philosophy of dialectical materialism was his theory of reflection, which presented human consciousness as a dynamic reflection of the objective material world that fully shapes its contents and structure. Later, Stalin's works on the subject established a rigid and formalistic division of Marxist–Leninist theory in the dialectical materialism and historical materialism parts. While the first was supposed to be the key method and theory of the philosophy of nature, the second was the Soviet version of the philosophy of history.

A dialectical method was fundamental to Marxist politics, e.g., the works of [[Karl Korsch]], [[Georg Lukács]] and certain members of the [[Frankfurt School]]. Soviet academics, notably [[Evald Ilyenkov]] and [[Zaid Orudzhev]], continued pursuing unorthodox philosophic study of Marxist dialectics; likewise in the West, notably the philosopher [[Bertell Ollman]] at  [[New York University]].

Friedrich Engels proposed that Nature is dialectical, thus, in [[Anti-Dühring]] he said that the negation of negation is: {{quote|A very simple process, which is taking place everywhere and every day, which any child can understand as soon as it is stripped of the veil of mystery in which it was enveloped by the old [[Idealism|idealist]] philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Engels, Frederick, (1877) ''Anti-Dühring,''Part I: Philosophy, XIII. Dialectics. Negation of the Negation. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/ch11.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[Dialectics of Nature]]'', Engels said: {{quote|Probably the same gentlemen who up to now have decried the transformation of quantity into quality as [[mysticism]] and incomprehensible [[transcendentalism]] will now declare that it is indeed something quite self-evident, trivial, and commonplace, which they have long employed, and so they have been taught nothing new. But to have formulated for the first time in its universally valid form a general law of development of Nature, society, and thought, will always remain an act of historic importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch02.htm |title=Engels, Frederick, (1883) ''Dialectics of Nature:''II.

Marxist dialectics is exemplified in ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (Capital), which outlines two central theories: (i) surplus value and (ii) the materialist conception of history; Marx explains dialectical materialism: {{quote|In its rational form, it is a scandal and abomination to [[bourgeoisie|bourgeoisdom]] and its doctrinaire professors, because it includes in its comprehension an affirmative recognition of the existing state of things, at the same time, also, the recognition of the negation of that state, of its inevitable breaking up; because it regards every historically developed social form as in fluid movement, and therefore takes into account its transient nature not less than its momentary existence; because it lets nothing impose upon it, and is in its essence critical and revolutionary.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl, (1873) ''Capital'' Vol. I, Afterword to the Second German Edition.
[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/p3.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Class struggle]] is the primary contradiction to be resolved by Marxist dialectics, because of its central role in the social and political lives of a society. Nonetheless, Marx and Marxists developed the concept of class struggle to comprehend the dialectical contradictions between mental and manual labor, and between town and country. Hence, philosophic contradiction is central to the development of dialectics{{snd}} the progress from quantity to quality, the acceleration of gradual social change; the negation of the initial development of the ''status quo''; the negation of that negation; and the high-level recurrence of features of the original ''status quo''. In the USSR, Progress Publishers issued anthologies of dialectical materialism by Lenin, wherein he also quotes Marx and Engels: {{quote|As the most comprehensive and profound doctrine of development, and the richest in content, Hegelian dialectics was considered by Marx and Engels the greatest achievement of classical German philosophy.... "The great basic thought", Engels writes, "that the world is not to be comprehended as a complex of ready-made things, but as a complex of processes, in which the things, apparently stable no less than their mind images in our heads, the concepts, go through an uninterrupted change of coming into being and passing away... this great fundamental thought has, especially since the time of Hegel, so thoroughly permeated ordinary consciousness that, in its generality, it is now scarcely ever contradicted.

But, to acknowledge this fundamental thought in words, and to apply it in reality in detail to each domain of investigation, are two different things.... For dialectical philosophy nothing is final, absolute, sacred. It reveals the transitory character of everything and in everything; nothing can endure before it, except the uninterrupted process of becoming and of passing away, of endless ascendancy from the lower to the higher. And dialectical philosophy, itself, is nothing more than the mere reflection of this process in the thinking brain." Thus, according to Marx, dialectics is "the science of the general laws of motion both of the external world and of human thought".&lt;ref name="Lenin, V.I. page 7-9"&gt;Lenin, V. I., ''On the Question of Dialectics: A Collection'', pp. 7–9. Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lenin describes his dialectical understanding of the concept of ''development'': {{quote|A development that repeats, as it were, stages that have already been passed, but repeats them in a different way, on a higher basis ("the negation of the negation"), a development, so to speak, that proceeds in spirals, not in a straight line; a development by leaps, catastrophes, and revolutions; "breaks in continuity"; the transformation of quantity into quality; inner impulses towards development, imparted by the contradiction and conflict of the various forces and tendencies acting on a given body, or within a given phenomenon, or within a given society; the interdependence and the closest and indissoluble connection between all aspects of any phenomenon (history constantly revealing ever new aspects), a connection that provides a uniform, and universal process of motion, one that follows definite laws{{snd}} these are some of the features of dialectics as a doctrine of development that is richer than the conventional one.&lt;ref name="Lenin, V.I. page 7-9"/&gt;}}

==== Dialectical naturalism ====
[[Dialectical naturalism]] is a term coined by American philosopher [[Murray Bookchin]] to describe the philosophical underpinnings of the political program of [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]]. Dialectical naturalism explores the complex interrelationship between social problems, and the direct consequences they have on the ecological impact of human society. Bookchin offered dialectical naturalism as a contrast to what he saw as the "empyrean, basically antinaturalistic dialectical idealism" of Hegel, and "the wooden, often scientistic dialectical materialism of orthodox Marxists".

== Dialectical theology ==
[[Neo-orthodoxy]], in Europe also known as theology of crisis and dialectical theology,&lt;ref name=BR1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://original.britannica.com/eb/topic-409012/neoorthodoxy|title=Original Britinnica online|accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BR2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/409012/neoorthodoxy#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=neoorthodoxy%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia |title=Britannica Encyclopedia (online) |accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an approach to [[theology]] in [[Protestantism]] that was developed in the aftermath of the [[First World War]] (1914–1918). It is characterized as a reaction against doctrines of [[Christianity in the 19th century|19th-century]] [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theology]] and a more positive reevaluation of the teachings of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], much of which had been in decline (especially in western Europe) since the late [[Christianity in the 18th century|18th century]].&lt;ref name=MW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/neo-orthodox |title=Merriam-Webster Dictionary(online) |accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is primarily associated with two [[Swiss people|Swiss]] professors and pastors, [[Karl Barth]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/91/N0059100.html |title=American Heritage Dictionary (online) |accessdate=2008-07-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050510080135/http://bartleby.com/61/91/N0059100.html |archive-date=2005-05-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1886–1968) and [[Emil Brunner]] (1899–1966),&lt;ref name=BR1/&gt;&lt;ref name=BR2/&gt; even though Barth himself expressed his unease in the use of the term.&lt;ref&gt;See Church Dogmatics III/3, xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In dialectical theology the difference and opposition between God and human beings is stressed in such a way that all human attempts at overcoming this opposition through moral, religious or philosophical idealism must be characterized as 'sin'. In the death of Christ humanity is negated and overcome, but this judgment also points forwards to the resurrection in which humanity is reestablished in Christ. For Barth this meant that only through God's 'no' to everything human can his 'yes' be perceived. Applied to traditional themes of Protestant theology, such as [[double predestination]], this means that election and reprobation cannot be viewed as a quantitative limitation of God's action. Rather it must be seen as its "qualitative definition".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Barth, The Epistle to the Romans (1933), p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; As Christ bore the rejection as well as the election of God for all humanity, every person is subject to both aspects of God's double predestination.

== Legacy ==
Dialectics has become central to continental philosophy, but it plays no part in Anglo-American philosophy. In other words, on the continent of Europe, dialectics has entered intellectual culture as what might be called a legitimate part of thought and philosophy, whereas in America and Britain, the dialectic plays no discernible part in the intellectual culture, which instead tends toward [[positivism]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} A prime example of the European tradition is [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s ''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]'', which is very different from the works of Popper, whose philosophy was for a time highly influential in the UK where he resided (see below). Sartre states:
:[[Existentialism]], like [[Marxism]], addresses itself to experience in order to discover there concrete syntheses. It can conceive of these syntheses only within a moving, dialectical totalisation, which is nothing else but history or—from the strictly cultural point of view adopted here—'philosophy-becoming-the world'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jean-Paul Sartre |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/critic/sartre1.htm |title=The Search for Method (1st part) Sartre, 1960, in Existentialism from Dostoyevsky to Sartre, transl. Hazel Barnes, Vintage Books |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
[[Karl Popper]] has attacked the dialectic repeatedly. In 1937, he wrote and delivered a paper entitled "What Is Dialectic?" in which he attacked the dialectical method for its willingness "to put up with contradictions".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper,''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'' [New York: Basic Books, 1962], p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; Popper concluded the essay with these words: "The whole development of dialectic should be a warning against the dangers inherent in philosophical system-building. It should remind us that [[philosophy]] should not be made a basis for any sort of scientific system and that philosophers should be much more modest in their claims. One task which they can fulfill quite usefully is the study of the critical [[Scientific method|methods of science]]" (Ibid., p.&amp;nbsp;335).

In chapter 12 of volume 2 of ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' (1944; 5th rev. ed., 1966), Popper unleashed a famous attack on Hegelian dialectics in which he held that Hegel's thought (unjustly in the view of some philosophers, such as [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Walter Kaufmann |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/kaufmann.htm |title=kaufmann |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; was to some degree responsible for facilitating the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe by encouraging and justifying [[Epistemology#Irrationalism|irrationalism]]. In section 17 of his 1961 "addenda" to ''The Open Society'', entitled "Facts, Standards and Truth: A Further Criticism of Relativism", Popper refused to moderate his criticism of the Hegelian dialectic, arguing that it "played a major role in the downfall of [[Weimar Republic|the liberal movement in Germany]] [...] by contributing to [[historicism]] and to an identification of might and right, encouraged [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] modes of thought. [...] [And] undermined and eventually lowered the traditional standards of intellectual responsibility and honesty".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper,''The Open Society and Its Enemies'', 5th rev. ed., vol. 2 [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1966], p.&amp;nbsp;395&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher of science and physicist [[Mario Bunge]] repeatedly criticized Hegelian and Marxian dialectics, calling them "fuzzy and remote from science"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bunge |first=Mario Augusto |authorlink=Mario Bunge |date=1981 |chapter=A critique of dialectics |title=Scientific materialism |series=Episteme |volume=9 |location=Dordrecht; Boston |publisher=[[Kluwer Academic Publishers]] |pages=41–63 |isbn=9027713049 |oclc=7596139 |doi=10.1007/978-94-009-8517-9_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "disastrous legacy".&lt;ref name="Bunge 2012"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bunge |first=Mario Augusto |authorlink=Mario Bunge |date=2012 |title=Evaluating philosophies |series=Boston studies in the philosophy of science |volume=295 |location=New York |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |pages=84–85 |isbn=9789400744073 |oclc=806947226 |doi=10.1007/978-94-007-4408-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded: "The so-called laws of dialectics, such as formulated by Engels (1940, 1954) and Lenin (1947, 1981), are false insofar as they are intelligible."&lt;ref name="Bunge 2012"/&gt;

== Formalism ==
{{main|Logic and dialectic}}
In the past few decades, European and American logicians have attempted to provide mathematical foundations for dialectical logic or [[argument (logic)|argument]].&lt;ref name="Eemeren"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eemeren |first1=Frans H. van |last2=Garssen |first2=Bart |last3=Krabbe |first3=Erik C.

Pollock]]), systems have been built that define well-formedness of arguments, rules governing the process of introducing arguments based on fixed assumptions, and rules for shifting burden. Many of these logics appear in the special area of [[artificial intelligence and law]], though the computer scientists' interest in formalizing dialectic originates in a desire to build [[decision support]] and computer-supported collaborative work systems.&lt;ref&gt;For surveys of work in this area see, for example: {{cite journal |last1=Chesñevar |first1=Carlos Iván |last2=Maguitman |first2=Ana Gabriela |last3=Loui |first3=Ronald Prescott |date=December 2000 |title=Logical models of argument |journal=ACM Computing Surveys |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=337–383 |doi=10.1145/371578.371581|url=http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~loui/survey.ps.gz }} And: {{cite book |last1=Prakken |first1=Henry |last2=Vreeswijk |first2=Gerard |date=2005 |chapter=Logics for defeasible argumentation |editor1-last=Gabbay |editor1-first=Dov M. |editor2-last=Guenthner |editor2-first=Franz |title=Handbook of philosophical logic |edition=2nd |volume=4 |location=Dordrecht; Boston |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |isbn=9789048158775 |doi=10.1007/978-94-017-0456-4_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''electron microscope''' is a microscope that uses a beam of accelerated [[electron]]s as a source of illumination. As the wavelength of an electron can be up to 100,000 times shorter than that of visible light [[photon]]s, electron microscopes have a higher [[Angular resolution|resolving power]] than [[optical microscope|light microscope]]s and can reveal the structure of smaller objects. A [[scanning transmission electron microscope]] has achieved better than 50&amp;nbsp;[[Picometre|pm]] resolution in [[annular dark-field imaging]] mode&lt;ref name="erni"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.096101|title=Atomic-Resolution Imaging with a Sub-50-pm Electron Probe|year=2009|author=Erni, Rolf|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=102|page=096101|pmid=19392535|last2=Rossell|first2=MD|last3=Kisielowski|first3=C|last4=Dahmen|first4=U|issue=9|bibcode=2009PhRvL.102i6101E| url = http://escholarship.org/uc/item/3cs0m4vr}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[magnification]]s of up to about 10,000,000x whereas most [[light microscope]]s are limited by [[diffraction]] to about 200&amp;nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]] resolution and useful magnifications below 2000x.

Electron microscopes have [[electron optics|electron optical lens]] systems that are analogous to the glass lenses of an optical light microscope.

Electron microscopes are used to investigate the [[ultrastructure]] of a wide range of biological and inorganic specimens including [[microorganisms]], [[cell (biology)|cells]], large [[molecules]], [[biopsy]] samples, [[metals]], and [[crystalline|crystals]]. Industrially, electron microscopes are often used for quality control and [[failure analysis]]. Modern electron microscopes produce electron [[micrograph]]s using specialized digital cameras and [[frame grabber]]s to capture the images.

=== Transmission electron microscope (TEM) ===
{{Main|Transmission electron microscope}}

[[File:Transmission Electron Microscope operating principle.ogg|thumb|upright=1.5|Operating principle of a transmission electron microscope]]

The original form of the electron microscope, the [[transmission electron microscope]] (TEM), uses a [[high voltage]] [[electron beam]] to illuminate the specimen and create an image. The electron beam is produced by an [[electron gun]], commonly fitted with a [[tungsten]] filament [[cathode]] as the electron source. The electron beam is accelerated by an [[anode]] typically at +100 k[[Electronvolt|eV]] (40 to 400 keV) with respect to the cathode, focused by [[electrostatic]] and [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] lenses, and transmitted through the specimen that is in part transparent to electrons and in part [[Electron scattering|scatters]] them out of the beam. When it emerges from the specimen, the electron beam carries information about the structure of the specimen that is magnified by the [[objective lens]] system of the microscope. The spatial variation in this information (the "image") may be viewed by projecting the magnified electron image onto a fluorescent viewing screen coated with a [[phosphor]] or [[scintillator]] material such as zinc sulfide. Alternatively, the image can be photographically recorded by exposing a [[photographic film]] or [[photographic plate|plate]] directly to the electron beam, or a high-resolution phosphor may be coupled by means of a lens optical system or a [[fibre optic]] light-guide to the sensor of a [[digital camera]]. The image detected by the digital camera may be displayed on a monitor or computer.

The resolution of TEMs is limited primarily by [[spherical aberration]], but a new generation of hardware correctors can reduce spherical aberration to increase the resolution in [[high-resolution transmission electron microscopy]] (HRTEM) to below 0.5 [[angstrom]] (50 [[picometre]]s),&lt;ref name="erni" /&gt; enabling magnifications above 50 million times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sc.doe.gov/bes/scale_of_things.html |title=The Scale of Things |date=2006-05-26 |publisher=Office of Basic Energy Sciences, U.S. Department of Energy |accessdate=2010-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201175106/http://www.sc.doe.gov/bes/scale_of_things.html |archivedate=2010-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of HRTEM to determine the positions of atoms within materials is useful for nano-technologies research and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1 = O'Keefe MA |author2 = Allard LF |title = Sub-Ångstrom Electron Microscopy for Sub-Ångstrom Nano-Metrology|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/821768-E3YVgN/native/821768.pdf |publisher=Information Bridge: DOE Scientific and Technical Information – Sponsored by OSTI |format=PDF |date=2004-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transmission electron microscopes are often used in [[electron diffraction]] mode. The advantages of electron diffraction over X-ray crystallography are that the specimen need not be a single crystal or even a polycrystalline powder, and also that the Fourier transform reconstruction of the object's magnified structure occurs physically and thus avoids the need for solving the [[phase problem]] faced by the X-ray crystallographers after obtaining their X-ray diffraction patterns of a single crystal or polycrystalline powder.

One major disadvantage of the transmission electron microscope is the need for extremely thin sections of the specimens, typically about 100 nanometers. Creating these thin sections for biological and materials specimens is technically very challenging. Semiconductor thin sections can be made using a [[focused ion beam]]. Biological tissue specimens are chemically fixed, dehydrated and embedded in a polymer resin to stabilize them sufficiently to allow ultrathin sectioning. Sections of biological specimens, organic polymers, and similar materials may require staining with heavy atom labels in order to achieve the required image contrast.

===Serial-section electron microscopy (ssEM)===

=== Scanning electron microscope (SEM) ===

[[File:Bacillus subtilis image.jpg|thumb|Image of bacillus subtilis taken with a 1960s electron microscope]]
The SEM produces images by probing the specimen with a focused electron beam that is scanned across a rectangular area of the specimen ([[raster scan]]ning). When the electron beam interacts with the specimen, it loses energy by a variety of mechanisms. The lost energy is converted into alternative forms such as heat, emission of [[secondary emission|low-energy secondary electrons]] and high-energy backscattered electrons, light emission ([[cathodoluminescence]]) or [[X-ray]] emission, all of which provide signals carrying information about the properties of the specimen surface, such as its topography and composition. The image displayed by an SEM maps the varying intensity of any of these signals into the image in a position corresponding to the position of the beam on the specimen when the signal was generated. In the SEM image of an ant shown below and to the right, the image was constructed from signals produced by a secondary electron detector, the normal or conventional imaging mode in most SEMs.

Generally, the image resolution of an SEM is lower than that of a TEM. However, because the SEM images the surface of a sample rather than its interior, the electrons do not have to travel through the sample. This reduces the need for extensive sample preparation to thin the specimen to electron transparency. The SEM is able to image bulk samples that can fit on its stage and still be maneuvered, including a height less than the working distance being used, often 4 millimeters for high-resolution images. The SEM also has a great depth of field, and so can produce images that are good representations of the three-dimensional surface shape of the sample. Another advantage of SEMs comes with [[environmental scanning electron microscope]]s (ESEM) that can produce images of good quality and resolution with hydrated samples or in low, rather than high, vacuum or under chamber gases. This facilitates imaging unfixed biological samples that are unstable in the high vacuum of conventional electron microscopes.[[File:Ant SEM.jpg|thumb|right|An image of an [[ant]] in a scanning electron microscope]]

=== Color ===
In their most common configurations, electron microscopes produce images with a single brightness value per pixel, with the results usually rendered in [[grayscale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgess|first=Jeremy|title=Under the Microscope: A Hidden World Revealed|year=1987|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-39940-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=30A5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA11|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, often these images are then colorized through the use of feature-detection software, or simply by hand-editing using a graphics editor. This may be done to clarify structure or for aesthetic effect and generally does not add new information about the specimen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Electron Microscopy|url=http://www.fei.com/uploadedfiles/documents/content/introduction_to_em_booklet_july_10.pdf|publisher=FEI Company|accessdate=12 December 2012|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some configurations information about several specimen properties is gathered per pixel, usually by the use of multiple detectors.&lt;ref name="ColourInSEMImaging"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Antonovsky |first=A. |year=1984 |title=The application of colour to sem imaging for increased definition |journal=Micron and Microscopica Acta |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=77–84 |doi=10.1016/0739-6260(84)90005-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In SEM, the attributes of topography and material contrast can be obtained by a pair of backscattered electron detectors and such attributes can be superimposed in a single color image by assigning a different primary color to each attribute.&lt;ref name=ColorSEMImages2&gt;{{cite journal |last=Danilatos |first=G.D. |year=1986 |title= Colour micrographs for backscattered electron signals in the SEM|journal=Scanning |volume=9 |issue= 3|pages=8–18|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2818.1986.tb04287.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a combination of backscattered and secondary electron signals can be assigned to different colors and superimposed on a single color micrograph displaying simultaneously the properties of the specimen.&lt;ref name=ColorSEMImages3&gt;{{cite journal |last=Danilatos |first=G.D. |year=1986 |title= Environmental scanning electron microscopy in colour|journal=J. Microscopy |volume=142 |pages=317–325|doi=10.1002/sca.4950080104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some types of detectors used in SEM have analytical capabilities, and can provide several items of data at each pixel. Examples are the [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] (EDS) detectors used in elemental analysis and [[Cathodoluminescence microscope]] (CL) systems that analyse the intensity and spectrum of electron-induced [[luminescence]] in (for example) geological specimens.  In SEM systems using these detectors, it is common to color code the signals and superimpose them in a single color image, so that differences in the distribution of the various components of the specimen can be seen clearly and compared. Optionally, the standard secondary electron image can be merged with the one or more compositional channels, so that the specimen's structure and composition can be compared.  Such images can be made while maintaining the full integrity of the original signal, which is not modified in any way.

=== Reflection electron microscope (REM) ===
In the '''reflection electron microscope''' (REM) as in the TEM, an electron beam is incident on a surface but instead of using the transmission (TEM) or secondary electrons (SEM), the reflected beam of [[Elastic scattering|elastically scattered electrons]] is detected. This technique is typically coupled with [[RHEED|reflection high energy electron diffraction]] (RHEED) and ''reflection high-energy loss spectroscopy (RHELS)''.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Another variation is spin-polarized low-energy electron microscopy ([[SPLEEM]]), which is used for looking at the microstructure of [[magnetic domain]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncem.lbl.gov/frames/spleem.html |publisher=National Center for Electron Microscopy (NCEM) |title=SPLEEM |accessdate=2010-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529185331/http://ncem.lbl.gov/frames/spleem.html |archivedate=2010-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) ===
{{Main|Scanning transmission electron microscopy}}
The STEM rasters a focused incident probe across a specimen that (as with the TEM) has been thinned to facilitate detection of electrons scattered ''through'' the specimen. The high resolution of the TEM is thus possible in STEM. The focusing action (and aberrations) occur before the electrons hit the specimen in the STEM, but afterward in the TEM. The STEMs use of SEM-like beam rastering simplifies [[annular dark-field imaging]], and other analytical techniques, but also means that image data is acquired in serial rather than in parallel fashion. Often TEM can be equipped with the scanning option and then it can function both as TEM and STEM.

== Sample preparation ==
[[File:Golden insect 01 Pengo.jpg|thumb|An insect [[sputter coating|coated in gold]] for viewing with a scanning electron microscope]]
Materials to be viewed under an electron microscope may require processing to produce a suitable sample. The technique required varies depending on the specimen and the analysis required:
* ''Chemical [[fixation (histology)|fixation]]'' – for biological specimens aims to stabilize the specimen's mobile macromolecular structure by chemical crosslinking of [[protein]]s with [[aldehyde]]s such as [[formaldehyde]] and [[glutaraldehyde]], and [[lipid]]s with [[osmium tetroxide]].
* ''[[Negative stain]]'' – suspensions containing nanoparticles or fine biological material (such as viruses and bacteria) are briefly mixed with a dilute solution of an electron-opaque solution such as ammonium molybdate, uranyl acetate (or formate), or phosphotungstic acid. This mixture is applied to a suitably coated EM grid, blotted, then allowed to dry. Viewing of this preparation in the TEM should be carried out without delay for best results. The method is important in microbiology for fast but crude morphological identification, but can also be used as the basis for high-resolution 3D reconstruction using EM tomography methodology when carbon films are used for support. Negative staining is also used for observation of nanoparticles.
* ''[[Cryofixation]]'' – freezing a specimen so rapidly, in [[liquid ethane]], and maintained at liquid nitrogen or even [[liquid helium]] temperatures, so that the water forms [[Amorphous ice|vitreous (non-crystalline) ice]]. This preserves the specimen in a snapshot of its solution state. An entire field called [[cryo-electron microscopy]] has branched from this technique. With the development of [[cryo-electron microscopy]] of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS), it is now possible to observe samples from virtually any biological specimen close to its native state.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}
* ''Dehydration'' – or replacement of [[water]] with organic solvents such as [[ethanol]] or [[acetone]], followed by [[critical point drying]] or infiltration with embedding [[resins]]. Also [[freeze drying]].
* ''Embedding, biological specimens'' – after dehydration, tissue for observation in the transmission electron microscope is embedded so it can be sectioned ready for viewing. To do this the tissue is passed through a 'transition solvent' such as [[propylene oxide]] (epoxypropane) or [[acetone]] and then infiltrated with an [[epoxy]] [[resin]] such as [[Araldite]], Epon, or [[Durcupan]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* ''Embedding, materials'' – after embedding in resin, the specimen is usually ground and polished to a mirror-like finish using ultra-fine abrasives. The polishing process must be performed carefully to minimize scratches and other polishing artifacts that reduce image quality.
* ''Metal shadowing'' – Metal (e.g. [[platinum]]) is evaporated from an overhead electrode and applied to the surface of a biological sample at an angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=R. C.|last2=Wyckoff|first2=R. W.|date=1945-06-08|title=Electron shadow micrography of the tobacco mosaic virus protein|journal=Science |volume=101|issue=2632|pages=594–596|doi=10.1126/science.101.2632.594|pmid=17739444|bibcode=1945Sci...101..594W}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surface topography results in variations in the thickness of the metal that are seen as variations in brightness and contrast in the electron microscope image.
* ''Replication'' – A surface shadowed with metal (e.g. platinum, or a mixture of carbon and platinum) at an angle is coated with pure carbon evaporated from carbon electrodes at right angles to the surface. This is followed by removal of the specimen material (e.g. in an acid bath, using enzymes or by mechanical separation&lt;ref name="Juniper"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=B.E.|last1=Juniper|first2=D.E.|last2=Bradley|journal=Journal of Ultrastructure Research|volume=2|issue=1|year=1958|pages=16–27|title=The carbon replica technique in the study of the ultrastructure of leaf surfaces|doi=10.1016/s0022-5320(58)90045-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to produce a surface replica that records the surface ultrastructure and can be examined using transmission electron microscopy.
* ''Sectioning'' – produces thin slices of the specimen, semitransparent to electrons. These can be cut on an [[ultramicrotome]] with a glass or [[diamond]] knife to produce ultra-thin sections about 60–90&amp;nbsp;nm thick. Disposable [[glass knives]] are also used because they can be made in the lab and are much cheaper.
* ''[[Staining]]'' – uses heavy metals such as [[lead]], [[uranium]] or [[tungsten]] to scatter imaging electrons and thus give contrast between different structures, since many (especially biological) materials are nearly "transparent" to electrons (weak phase objects). In biology, specimens can be stained "en bloc" before embedding and also later after sectioning. Typically thin sections are stained for several minutes with an aqueous or alcoholic solution of [[uranyl acetate]] followed by aqueous lead citrate.&lt;ref name=Reynolds63&gt;{{cite journal | last=Reynolds | first=E.

The cold fractured surface (sometimes "etched" by increasing the temperature to about −100&amp;nbsp;°C for several minutes to let some ice sublime) is then shadowed with evaporated platinum or gold at an average angle of 45° in a high vacuum evaporator. The second coat of carbon, evaporated perpendicular to the average surface plane is often performed to improve the stability of the replica coating. The specimen is returned to room temperature and pressure, then the extremely fragile "pre-shadowed" metal replica of the fracture surface is released from the underlying biological material by careful chemical digestion with acids, [[hypochlorite]] solution or [[Sodium dodecyl sulfate|SDS]] detergent. The still-floating replica is thoroughly washed free from residual chemicals, carefully fished up on fine grids, dried then viewed in the TEM.
* ''Freeze-fracture replica immunogold labeling (FRIL)'' – the freeze-fracture method has been modified to allow the identification of the components of the fracture face by immunogold labeling. Instead of removing all the underlying tissue of the thawed replica as the final step before viewing in the microscope the tissue thickness is minimized during or after the fracture process. The thin layer of tissue remains bound to the metal replica so it can be immunogold labeled with antibodies to the structures of choice. The thin layer of the original specimen on the replica with gold attached allows the identification of structures in the fracture plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1987-03-01|title=Immunolocalization of MP70 in lens fiber 16-17-nm intercellular junctions|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|volume=104|issue=3|pages=565–572|pmc=2114558|pmid=3818793|author1=Gruijters|first1=W.

* ''Ion beam milling'' – thins samples until they are transparent to electrons by firing [[ions]] (typically [[argon]]) at the surface from an angle and sputtering material from the surface. A subclass of this is [[focused ion beam]] milling, where [[gallium]] ions are used to produce an electron transparent membrane in a specific region of the sample, for example through a device within a microprocessor. Ion beam milling may also be used for cross-section polishing prior to SEM analysis of materials that are difficult to prepare using mechanical polishing.
* ''Conductive coating'' – an ultrathin coating of electrically conducting material, deposited either by high vacuum evaporation or by low vacuum sputter coating of the sample. This is done to prevent the accumulation of static electric fields at the specimen due to the electron irradiation required during imaging. The coating materials include gold, gold/palladium, platinum, tungsten, graphite, etc.
* ''[[ground (electricity)|Earthing]]'' – to avoid electrical charge accumulation on a conductively coated sample, it is usually electrically connected to the metal sample holder. Often an [[electrically conductive adhesive]] is used for this purpose.

== Disadvantages ==
Electron microscopes are expensive to build and maintain, on the order of other complex machines such as airplanes. Microscopes designed to achieve high resolutions must be housed in stable buildings (sometimes underground) with special services such as magnetic field canceling systems.  Operating the electron microscope requires  specialized training and continuing practice and education.

The samples largely have to be viewed in [[vacuum]], as the molecules that make up air would scatter the electrons. An exception is [[Liquid-Phase Electron Microscopy|liquid-phase electron microscopy]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Jonge|first1= N.|last2= Ross|first2= F.M.|date=2011 | title=Electron microscopy of specimens in liquid | journal= Nature Nanotechnology |volume=6 |issue= 8| pages= 695–704 | doi=10.1038/nmat944|pmid= 12872162|bibcode=2003NatMa...2..532W}}&lt;/ref&gt; using either a closed liquid cell or an environmental chamber, for example, in the [[environmental scanning electron microscope]], which allows hydrated samples to be viewed in a low-pressure (up to {{convert|20|Torr|kPa|disp=or|abbr=on|lk=in}}) wet environment. Various techniques for [[in situ electron microscopy]] of gaseous samples have been developed as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gai|first1= P.L.|last2= Boyes|first2= E.D.|year=2009 | title=Advances in atomic resolution in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy and 1A aberration corrected in situ electron microscopy | journal= Microsc Res Tech |volume=72 |issue= 3| pages= 153–164 | doi=10.1002/jemt.20668 |pmid= 19140163|arxiv= 1705.05754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scanning electron microscopes operating in conventional high-vacuum mode usually image conductive specimens; therefore non-conductive materials require conductive coating (gold/palladium alloy, carbon, osmium, etc.). The low-voltage mode of modern microscopes makes possible the observation of non-conductive specimens without coating.  Non-conductive materials can be imaged also by a variable pressure (or environmental) scanning electron microscope.

Small, stable specimens such as [[carbon nanotubes]], [[diatom]] frustules and small mineral crystals (asbestos fibres, for example) require no special treatment before being examined in the electron microscope. Samples of hydrated materials, including almost all biological specimens have to be prepared in various ways to stabilize them, reduce their thickness (ultrathin sectioning) and increase their electron optical contrast (staining). These processes may result in ''[[Visual artifact#In microscopy|artifacts]]'', but these can usually be identified by comparing the results obtained by using radically different specimen preparation methods. Since the 1980s, analysis of [[cryofixation|cryofixed]], vitrified specimens has also become increasingly used by scientists, further confirming the validity of this technique.&lt;ref name="Adrian1984"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Adrian |first=Marc |author2=Dubochet, Jacques |author3=Lepault, Jean |author4= McDowall, Alasdair W.  |year=1984 |title=Cryo-electron microscopy of viruses |journal=Nature |volume=308 |issue=5954 |pages=32–36 |doi=10.1038/308032a0 |pmid=6322001|bibcode = 1984Natur.308...32A |url=https://serval.unil.ch/notice/serval:BIB_BEC796503260 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sabanay1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sabanay |first=I. |author2=Arad, T. |author3=Weiner, S. |author4= Geiger, B.  |year=1991|title=Study of vitrified, unstained frozen tissue sections by cryoimmunoelectron microscopy |journal=Journal of Cell Science |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=227–236 |pmid=1795028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kasas |first=S. |author2=Dumas, G. |author3=Dietler, G. |author4=Catsicas, S. |author5= Adrian, M.  |year=2003 |title=Vitrification of cryoelectron microscopy specimens revealed by high-speed photographic imaging |journal=Journal of Microscopy |volume=211 |issue=1 |pages=48–53 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2818.2003.01193.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elizabeth Campbell''' (1893–1971) was an American archeologist, notable for proposing a much earlier date for the presence of man in the desert Southwest than was generally accepted. She worked with her husband William (Bill) Campbell and first proposed that artifacts found along the shores of [[Lake Mojave]] and other [[Pleistocene]] lakes and rivers of the desert West were contemporaneous with the presence of water.  They showed that there were virtually no sites that were not associated with archaic water sources.  They hypothesized that the geologic features associated with the artifacts could be used to date the period of human habitation.  This is the first use of what has become known as [[environmental archaeology]].&lt;ref name='warren2017'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warren|first1=Claude N.|author-link1=Claude Nelson Warren|last2=Schneider|first2=Joan S.|title=Purple Hummingbird: A Biography of Elizabeth Warder Crozer Campbell|date=2017|publisher=University of Utah Press|isbn=9781607815181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==

Elizabeth Crozer was the youngest of four daughters born to upper class parents: John Price Crozer II and Elizabeth Steger Warder Crozer of [[Upland, Pennsylvania]].  She was born on August 11, 1893 at the Crozer summer cottage in [[Beach Haven, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="warren2017"/&gt;

Her father was the grandson of [[John Price Crozer]], founder of the Crozer textile mills and possessor of the Crozer fortune.&lt;ref name="mcQueen1982"&gt;McQueen, David A. (1982) ''The Crozers of Upland 1723-1926'', Serendipity Wress, Wilmington, Deleware&lt;/ref&gt;  When the elder John Crozer died the younger John Crozer inherited the mills and formed a partnership with his father under the name: S. A. Crozer and Son.  When S. A Crozer died in 1910 John inherited coal companies, an iron and steel company, shared of a railroad and farms.&lt;ref name="warren2017"/&gt; The Crozer family founded the [[Crozer Theological Seminary]], the [[Crozer Arboretum]], and the [[Crozer Quarterly]].  They also built the [[George K. Crozer Mansion]] and are the namesake of the [[Crozer-Keystone Health System]].

Her uncle was [[Hermann Volrath Hilprecht]], professor of Assyriology at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and a scholar of Near Eastern archaeology.  He was involved in the excavations at the Near Eastern site of [[Nippur]].  Campbell described in her diary how her Aunt Sallie would travel with Hilprecht to Europe and how "..[s]he never let her loveliness interfere with anything.  She climbed the pyramids with three Arabs to push and pull."&lt;ref name="crozer1908"&gt;Crozer, Elizabeth W. (1908) Diary of Elizabeth Crozer.  Manuscript on file in the Joshua Tree National Park archives, Twentynine Palms, California&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell was schooled at home by a French tutor until age fourteen.&lt;ref name="JTNP"&gt;Elizabeth Campbell - Joshua Tree National Park (U.S. National Park Service),  https://www.nps.gov/jotr/learn/historyculture/campbell.htm, Retrieved April 15, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  In the fall of 1909 she began attending Miss Irwin's School (later the Agnes Irwin School) and graduated in 1911.  Until World War II the education of most daughters of Philadelphia high society who attended Miss Irwin's ended at the secondary level.&lt;ref&gt;Baltzell, Edward Digby, (1989) ''Philadelphia Gentlemen: The Making of a National Upper Class'', Transaction Publishers, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was Campbell's last formal education.

Campbell married William (Bill) Campbell in May 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Antevs, Ernst, (1945) "William Henry Campbell, 1895-1944",  ''American Antiquity'', 10(4) pp 379-382.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bill had served in World War I and had been gassed two days before the armistice of November 11, 1918.&lt;ref name='warren2017'/&gt;  Bill's lung damage due to exposure to mustard gas caused them to move to [[Los Angeles, California]] and later to the drier climes of [[Twentynine Palms, California|Twentynine Palms]] where they established a homestead.

When Campbell's father died in 1926 she inherited a trust&lt;ref name="JTNP"/&gt; that enabled her and Bill to live comfortably for the rest of their lives.  The Campbells were considered pillars of the Twentynine Palms community and developed a reputation as benefactors of both individual and community endeavours.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Joseph, "The Late, Great American WASP", ''Wall Street Journal'', December 21–22, 2013: C1-C2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bagley1978"&gt;Bagley, Hellen, 1978) ''Sand in My Shoe:  Homestead Days in Twentynine Palms'', Homestead Publishers, Twentynine Palms, California.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Campbells maintained their residence in Twentynine Palms, and lived in a summer home on the shores of [[Lake Tahoe]], near [[Glenbrook, Nevada]].  It was here that Bill died in June 1944.  After Bill's death Campbell sold the house in Twentynine Palms and moved to [[Carson City, Nevada]] where she met and married Joe Cecil Turman.  The marriage lasted a short time before it was annulled.&lt;ref name="warren2017"/&gt;  She moved to [[Tucson, Arizona]] around 1952 where she lived until 1961.

While living in Tucson she became a research associate with the [[Arizona State Museum]]&lt;ref name="warren2017"/&gt; and continued to work on the collections she and Bill had assembled over the years.  In 1957 she had Arizona State Museum exhibit designer Robert Baker design a laboratory on the second floor of her Tucson home.&lt;ref name="baker1957"&gt;Baker, Robert G, (1957) Drawing of a plan for archaeological laboratory for Tucson home of Elizabeth W.C. Campbell.  Elizabeth Crozer Campbell file, Administrative Records, Arizona State Museum Archives, University of Arizona, Tucson (File 129A)&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time she also wrote a memoir about homesteading in Twentynine Palms, ''The Desert was Home.''&lt;ref name="campbell1961"&gt;Campbell, Elizabeth W. Crozer, (1961) ''The Desert Was Home'', Westernlore Press, Los Angeles, California.&lt;/ref&gt;  Campbell made a trip to Twentynine Palms for an event marking the publication of her book and made the decision to move back there.  She remained in Twentynine Palms for the rest of her life.&lt;ref name="bagley1978"/&gt;  Elizabeth Campbell died on December 21, 1971.  She was cremated and her cremains were interred alongside those of her husband Bill in a single plot in Twentynine Palms Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Warder "Betty" Crozer Campbell - Find a Grave Memorial, https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=92706255, accessed April 20, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  Her obituary was published in ''The Masterkey.''&lt;ref&gt;(1972) Obit for Elizabeth Crozer Campbell, ''The Masterkey'' Vol. 46, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career in Archaeology ==

Campbell developed an interest in archaeology after she and Bill moved to Twentynine Palms. She began collecting arrowheads from nearby sand dunes while gathering firewood.  When Bill McHaney, an old prospector who often visited their camp, told stories about Indian culture and caches of pottery, she listened and took notes.&lt;ref name="JTNP"/&gt;  They would drive their trusty automobile -- "The Ship of the Desert"&lt;ref name='campbell1961'/&gt;—into the surrounding countryside looking for archaeological sites and visiting locations that McHaney told them about.  It was said that archaeology met Campbell's need for "intellectual effort and accomplishment" and ameliorated the lonely desert life.&lt;ref name='bagley1978'/&gt;  The Campbells were among the earliest archaeologists in the California desert.  At the time (1925) virtually nothing was known about how long humans had lived in the deserts and the use of [[stratigraphy (archaeology)|stratigraphy]] as a means of chronological ordering of archaeological assemblages was just beginning.&lt;ref name='warren2017'/&gt;

Campbell's first monograph was published by the [[Southwest Museum of the American Indian|Southwest Museum]] in 1931.&lt;ref name="crozer1931a"&gt;Campbell, Elizabeth Crozer, (1931) ''An Archaeological Reconnaissance of the Twenty Nine Palms Region'', Southwest Museum Papers No. 7,  Southwest Museum, Pasadena, California.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1932 the Campbells were appointed fellows in archaeology of the Southwest Museum and hosted a conference in Twentynine Palms on April 22–23 of that year.&lt;ref name="hinchman1932"&gt;Hinchman, Fred K, (1932) "Southwestern Archaeological Federation at Twenty-Nine Palms.", ''The Masterkey'', 6(2):52-56&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 the Campbells began their investigation of [[Pinto Basin]].  The area is associated with an extinct river channel and a dry lake bed.&lt;ref name="campbellAmsden1934"&gt;Campbell, Elizabeth Crozer and Charles Amsden, (1934) "The Eagle Mountain Site.", ''The Masterkey'', 8(6):170-173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CampbellCampbell1935"&gt;Campbell, Elizabeth W. Crozer and William Campbell, (1935) ''The Pinto Basin Site: An Ancient Aboriginal Camping Ground in the California Desert'', Southwest Museum Papers No. 9, Southwest Museum, Los Angeles, California.&lt;/ref&gt;  Campbell began consulting with geologists and paleontologists at the [[California Institute of Technology]].  Geologist David Scharf authored the geological chapter of the Pinto Basin report in one of the first collaborations of geologists and archaeologists.  The artifacts from Pinto Basin were associated with the dry stream channel known as [[Pinto Wash]] and the lake bed known as [[Palen Dry Lake]].  This suggested that these sites were occupied during the period of time when the desert was considerably wetter.&lt;ref name="warren2017"/&gt;  The Campbells argued that this wet period was not recent and presented as evidence the ground-water level being 97 feet below the surface of the surrounding arid mountain ranges.  Starting with the Pinto Basin report, and for all research after, Campbell collaborated and consulted with well-known professionals in the fields of geology, paleontology, and archaeology.  This increased her professional status and standing with the archaeological community.&lt;ref name="warren2017"/&gt;

In early 1934 the Campbells collected artifacts from the high shorelines of [[Silver Lake (Mojave)|Silver Lake]] playa (the northern basin of Lake Mojave) and in 1935 they collected from the shorelines of [[Soda Lake (San Bernardino County)|Soda Lake]] playa (the southern basin of Lake Mojave).  Campbell stated she and Bill wanted to become experts in [[Dry Lake|playa]] culture.&lt;ref name="campbell1935"&gt;Typewritten report from Elizabeth Campbell to the National Park Service on 1935 reconnaissance carried out in San Bernardino County.  On file in the Joshua Tree National Park archives., Twentynine Palms, California&lt;/ref&gt;  Campbell believed that most ancient sites would be located in the [[Great Basin]].&lt;ref name="campbell1937"&gt;Typewritten report from Elizabeth Campbell to the National Park Service on 1937 reconnaissance carried out in San Bernardino County.  On file in the Joshua Tree National Park archives., Twentynine Palms, California&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 Campbell published her seminal paper "Archaeological Problems in the Southern California Deserts"&lt;ref name="campbell1936a"&gt;Campbell, Elizabeth W. Crozer, (1936) Archaeological Problems in the Southern California Deserts, ''American Antiquity'', 1(4) pp 235-300&lt;/ref&gt; in which she outlined her hypothesis that associated prehistoric peoples with certain landforms.  She believed a thorough study of the spatial relationships of artifact assemblages to the landscape would illuminate their chronology.&lt;ref name="warren2017"/&gt;  This approach is clearly laid out in the Lake Mohave report&lt;ref name="campbellCampbell1937"&gt;Campbell, Elizabeth W.C., William H. Campbell, Ernst Anteves, Charles E. Amsden, J.A. Barbieri and F.D. Bode, (1937) "The Lake Mohave Site" in ''The Archaeology of Pleistocene Lake Mohave: A Symposium'', Southwest Museum Papers No. 11:9, Southwest Museum, Los Angeles, California&lt;/ref&gt; where she wrote: {{quote|text=In order to prove that a site has great age, it should be a pure site; that is, the artifacts should represent one period only, and it should be situated where the geology of the regions points to antiquity. For this reason we have sought man's ancient remains along extinct river channels and about the strand lines of playas and fossil lakes, indicated as such by beaches, terraces, spits, and wave-cut cliffs -- mute testimony to a past day of moister climate.  We have not be disappointed in our search for locations by geological indication, for during the last two years the Desert Laboratory of the Southwest Museum has found and studied ten sites of the desired type.  As all of these are now far from water, their occupants no doubt belonged to a period of greater rainfall.}}

'''Engineers Without Borders Ireland''' is an [[international development]] organisation for students and professionals from [[Ireland]] who share a common interest in [[sustainable development]] through engineering and [[appropriate technologies]].

The organisation was initially founded in 2007, and partook in a 2-week project in the [http://www.sonairte.ie/ Sonairte: The National Ecology Centre] in Co. Meath, Ireland. After a lull in activities, a small group of engineers began discussions on reviving EWB-Ireland in 2009. These discussions led to the formation of EWB-Ireland's first ever national committee in January 2010. The committee is a small group of committed engineers from numerous disciplines, located throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewb-ireland.org/history EWB-Ireland Website - History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, EWB-Ireland has branches in [[University College Dublin]] and [[Queens University Belfast]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewb-ireland.org/branches EWB Ireland Website - Branches]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''epiphyte''' is an organism that grows on the surface of a plant and derives its moisture and nutrients from the air, rain, water (in marine environments) or from debris accumulating around it. Epiphytes take part in nutrient cycles and add to both the diversity and biomass of the ecosystem in which they occur like any other organism. They are an important source of food for many species. Typically, the older parts of a plant will have more epiphytes growing on them. Epiphytes differ from parasites in that epiphytes grow on other plants for physical support and do not necessarily negatively affect the host. An epiphytic organism that is not a plant is sometimes called an [[epibiont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2001|author1=Hickey, M.|author2=King, C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epiphytes are usually found in the temperate zone (e.g., many [[moss]]es, [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]], [[lichen]]s, and [[alga]]e) or in the tropics (e.g., many [[fern]]s, [[Cactus|cacti]], [[orchid]]s, and [[bromeliad]]s).&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged''.

Epiphyte is one of the subdivisions of the [[Raunkiær plant life-form|Raunkiær system]].
The term ''epiphytic'' derives from the Greek ''epi-'' (meaning 'upon') and ''phyton'' (meaning 'plant'). Epiphytic plants are sometimes called "air plants" because they do not root in soil. However, there are many aquatic species of [[algae]] that are epiphytes on other aquatic plants (seaweeds or aquatic [[angiosperms]]).
[[File:Epiphytes (Dominica).jpg|thumb|Epiphytes can grow on the trunks of trees or sometimes in the canopy of a tree]]
[[File:Epiphytic orchid.jpg|thumb|An epiphytic orchid on a tree in a Brazilian cloud forest]]

==Terrestrial epiphytes==
The best-known epiphytic plants include [[moss]]es, [[orchid]]s, and [[bromeliad]]s such as [[Spanish moss]] (of the genus ''[[Tillandsia]]''), but epiphytes may be found in every major group of the plant kingdom. 89% of terrestrial epiphyte species (about 24,000) are [[flowering plant]]s. The second largest group are the [[leptosporangiate fern]]s, with about 2800 species (10% of epiphytes). In fact, about one third of all ferns are epiphytes.&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, C Michael, 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Fern ''Fern''. Encyclopedia of Earth. National council for Science and the Environment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109071540/http://www.eoearth.org/article/Fern |date=November 9, 2011 }}. Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt; The third largest group is [[clubmoss]]es, with 190 species, followed by a handful of species in each of the [[spikemoss]]es, other ferns, [[Gnetophyta|Gnetales]], and [[cycad]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/10161/181/1/D_Schuettpelz_Eric_a_052007.pdf | title = The evolution and diversification of epiphytic ferns | author = Schuettpelz, Eric | year = 2007 | publisher = Duke University PhD thesis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first important monograph on epiphytic [[plant ecology]] was written by [[Andreas Franz Wilhelm Schimper|A.F.W. Schimper]] (''Die epiphytische Vegetation Amerikas'', 1888). Assemblages of large epiphytes occur most abundantly in moist [[Tropical rainforest|tropical forests]], but mosses and lichens occur as epiphytes in almost all biomes. In Europe there are no dedicated epiphytic plants using roots, but rich assemblages of mosses and lichens grow on trees in damp areas (mainly the western coastal fringe), and the common polypody fern grows epiphytically along branches. Rarely, grass, small bushes or small trees may grow in suspended soils up trees (typically in a rot-hole). 

=== Holo-epiphyte or Hemi-epiphyte ===

Epiphytes however, can generally be categorized into holo-epiphytes or hemi-epiphytes. A holo-epiphyte is a plant that spends its whole life cycle without contact with the ground and a hemi-epiphyte is a plant that spends only half of its life without the ground before the roots can reach or make contact with the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nieder|first=Jürgen|last2=Prosper´ı|first2=Juliana|date=2001|title=Epiphytes and their contribution to canopy diversity|url=https://journals.ohiolink.edu/pg_99?106706970338822::NO::P99_ENTITY_ID,P99_ENTITY_TYPE:27304615,MAIN_FILE&amp;cs=3qQvpBlUcKYGOcd_hN-qdwSXVcYkST9-7VRlGkwQDz68JuTJ_hoy9DUjfU-zwDhoDlbkjhZpoG7YFvPkDAHZkhw|journal=Plant Ecology|volume=153|pages=51–63|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orchidaceae|Orchids]] are a common example of holo-epiphytes and [[Strangler fig|Strangler Figs]] are an example of hemi-epiphytes.

=== Plant nutrient relations ===

Epiphytes are not connected to the soil, and consequently must get nutrients from other sources, such as fog, dew, rain and mist.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zotz|first=Gerhard|last2=Hietz|first2=Peter|date=November 2001|title=The physiological ecology of vascular epiphytes: current knowledge, open questions|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/jexbot/52.364.2067|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|volume=Volume 52|issue=364|pages=2067–2078|via=|doi=10.1093/jexbot/52.364.2067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, nutrients being released from ground rooted plants by decomposition or leaching, and dinitrogen fixation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Epiphytic plants attached to their hosts high in the [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]] have an advantage over herbs restricted to the ground where there is less light and herbivores may be more active. Epiphytic plants are also important to certain animals that may live in their water reservoirs, such as some types of [[frog]]s and [[arthropod]]s.

Epiphytes can have a significant effect on the microenvironment of their host, and of ecosystems where they are abundant, as they hold water in the canopy and decrease water input to the soil.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, D.E., Chávez, J.H., Villegas, L., Villasante, F., Armesto, J., Hedin, L.O., Horn, H. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2435.12249/abstract "Epiphytes Improve Host Plant Water Use by Microenvironment Modification"], ''[[Functional Ecology (journal)]]'', doi: 10.1111/1365-2435.12249&lt;/ref&gt; Some non-vascular epiphytes such as lichens and mosses are well known for their ability to take up water rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johansson|first=Dick|date=1974|title=ECOLOGY OF VASCULAR EPIPHYTES IN WEST AFRICAN RAIN FOREST|url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:565496/FULLTEXT01.pdf|journal=Acta Phytogeographica Suecica|volume=Volume 59|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The epiphytes create a significantly cooler and moister environment in the host plant canopy, potentially greatly reducing water loss by the host through transpiration.[[File:Clinging root of epiphyte.jpg|thumb|200px|A clinging root of an [[orchid]]]]

== Marine epiphytes ==
[[File:Heavy epiphyte growth on kelp stipe at Umhlali wreck PA171965.JPG|thumb|Heavy epiphyte growth on kelp stipe at Umhlali wreck]]
The ecology of epiphytes in marine environments differs from those in terrestrial ecosystems. Epiphytes in marine systems are species of algae, bacteria, fungi, sponges, bryozoans, ascidians, protozoa, crustaceans, molluscs and any other sessile organism that grows on the surface of a plant, typically [[seagrass]]es or algae.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mvcommission.org/sites/default/files/docs/Epiphytes_Wrack_feb2009.pdf|title=MV Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seagrassli.org/ecology/fauna_flora/epiphytes.html|title=www.SeagrassLI.org Cornell Cooperative Extension Eelgrass Restoration|website=www.seagrassli.org|access-date=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Settlement of epiphytic species is influenced by a number of factors including light, temperature, currents, nutrients, and trophic interactions. Algae are the most common group of epiphytes in marine systems.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Photosynthetic epiphytes account for a large amount of the photosynthesis in systems in which they occur.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/bisc/learn/nature/marineplants.htm|title=Marine Plants / Algae - Biscayne National Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is typically between 20 and 60% of the total primary production of the ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They are a general group of organisms and are highly diverse, providing food for a great number of fauna.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Snail and nudibranch species are two common grazers of epiphytes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Epiphyte species composition and the amount of epiphytes can be indicative of changes in the environment. Recent increases in epiphyte abundance have been linked to excessive nitrogen put into the environment from farm runoff and storm water. High abundance of epiphytes are considered detrimental to the plants that they grow on often causing damage or death, particularly in seagrasses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is because too many epiphytes can block access to sunlight or nutrients. Epiphytes in marine systems are known to grow quickly with very fast generation times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/outreach/pdfs/coastalhypoxia.pdf|title=An Assessment of Coastal Hypoxia and Eutrophication in U.S. Waters|last=|first=|date=|website=NOAA|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Personalized medicine]] developed to a major field for Genomatix.&lt;ref name="Personaliced Medicine"&gt;[http://www.genomatix.de/en/forscher.html] Genomatix and personalized medicine.&lt;/ref&gt; Genomatix is involved in several projects and international conferences e.g. 5th Santorini Conference - "Functional Genomics towards personalized health care" &lt;ref name="Santorini Conference"&gt;[http://www.santorini2010.org/] Conference about personalized health care.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008 Genomatix has strongly focused on Next Generation Sequencing data analysis. Because of the large amount of data and the need for high-end computing power, Genomatix deploys its solutions as in-house installations (hardware software bundle)

Two systems are available:

1. The Genomatix Mining Station (GMS) is based on a proprietary genomic pattern recognition paradigm, or GenomeThesaurus, which allows for input of raw sequence reads plus optional quality files from any deep sequencing hardware. It provides ultra fast mapping of sequences of any length (starting from 8bp) with no practical limits on the number of point mutations and/or insertions and deletions that can be taken into account during the mapping process. Depending on the nature of the experiment, the GMS can provide SNP detection and genotyping, copy number analysis, and small RNA analysis. For ChIPseq data, the GMS delivers clustering and peak finding, and performs automated binding pattern identification. For RNAseq experiments, normalized expression values are calculated at the exon and transcript level. A special GenomeThesaurus is also provided for potential splice junctions, which allows for splice junction analysis and identification of new transcriptional units.

For genomic re-sequencing and newly sequenced genomes, a de-novo assembly will be provided.

2. The Genomatix Genome Analyzer (GGA) delivers downstream software tools and databases for the deep biological analysis of data coming from the GMS. It allows for easy integration and visualization in the terabytes of background annotation of the ElDorado genome database. GGA extensively annotates genomic coordinates and surrounding areas derived by the GMS or any other mapping procedure. Clustering and peak finding, analysis for phylogenetic conservation, large scale correlation analysis with annotated genomic elements, meta-analysis of data correlation between different experiments, pathway mining for groups of identified genes, transcription factor binding site (TFBS) analysis ( identification, over-representation, binding partner analysis, framework identification, phylogenetic conservation, regulatory SNP effects) and much more are all processes carried out on the GGA.

With the GGA and GMS Genomatix delivers the worldwide first integrative data analysis platform for Next Generation Sequencing analysis with custom workflows tailored towards specific needs.

Further developments will be the link-up of data from clinical sources and medical applications. Pilot projects were already started within Genomatix’ consulting platform linking genotype and phenotype information.

{{Redirects|Double time|for the double dutch documentary|Doubletime}}
[[File:common time signatures.gif|right|frame|Basic [[time signature]]s: {{music|time|4|4}}, also known as common time ({{music|common-time}}); {{music|time|2|2}}, also known as cut time or cut-common time ({{music|alla-breve}}); etc.]]

In [[popular music]], '''half-time''' is a type of [[meter (music)|meter]] and [[tempo]] that alters the [[rhythm]]ic feel by essentially ''doubling the tempo resolution'' or metric [[divisive rhythm|division]]/level in comparison to [[common-time]]. Thus {{music|time|4|4}} approximates {{music|time|8|8}}. It is not to be confused with ''[[alla breve]]'' or [[Time signature#Complex time signatures|odd time]]. Though notes usually get the same value relative to the tempo, the way the [[beat (music)|beats]] are divided is altered. While much music typically has a [[Beat (music)#Backbeat|backbeat]] on [[quarter note]] (crotchet) beats two and four, half time would increase the interval between backbeats to double, thus making it hit on beats three and seven, or the third beat of each measure ([[counting (music)|count]] out of an 8 beat measure [bar], common practice in half time):
 1   '''2'''   3   '''4'''   1   '''2'''   3   '''4'''
 1   '''2'''   3   '''4'''   5   '''6'''   7   '''8'''
 1       '''2'''       3       '''4'''
Essentially, a half time '[[Groove (drumming)|groove]]' is one that expands one [[bar (music)|measure]] over the course of two. The ''length'' of each note is doubled while its ''frequency'' is halved).

==Common-time==
{{main|Common-time}}
[[File:Characteristic rock drum pattern.png|250px|thumb|Rhythm pattern characteristic of much popular music including rock ({{audio|Characteristic rock drum pattern.mid|Play}}), quarter note (crotchet) or "regular" time: "bass drum on beats 1 and 3 and snare drum on beats 2 and 4 of the measure [bar]...add eighth notes [quavers] on the hi-hat".&lt;ref&gt;Peckman, Jonathan (2007). ''Picture Yourself Drumming'', p.50. {{ISBN|1-59863-330-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Time signatures are defined by how they divide the measure (in {{music|time|9|8}}, complex triple time, each measure is divided in three, each of which is divided into three eighth notes: 3×3=9). In "common" time, often considered {{music|time|4|4}}, each level is divided in two (simple duple time: 2×2=4). In a  common-time rock drum pattern each measure (a whole note) is divided in two by the bass drum (half note), each half is divided in two by the snare drum (quarter note, collectively the bass and snare divide the measure into four), and each quarter note is divided in two by a [[ride pattern]] (eighth note). "Half"-time refers to halving this division (divide each measure into quarter notes with the ride pattern), while "double"-time refers to doubling this division (divide each measure into sixteenth notes with the ride pattern).

==Half-time==
[[File:Half time rock pattern.png|300px|center|thumb|Half time: notice the snare moves to beats 3 of measures (bars) one and two (beats 3 &amp; 7) while the hi-hat plays only on the quarter notes (quavers).{{audio|Half time rock pattern.mid|Play}} Note also, for example, that the quarter notes 'sound like' eighth notes in one giant measure.]]

A classic example is the '''half-time shuffle''', a variation of a [[swung note|shuffle]] rhythm, which is used extensively in hip-hop and some blues music. Some of the variations of the basic groove are notoriously difficult to play on [[drum set]]. It is also a favorite in some pop and rock tunes. Some classic examples are the [[Purdie Shuffle]] by [[Bernard Purdie]] which appears in "[[Home at Last (Steely Dan song)|Home At Last]]" and "[[Babylon Sisters]]", both of which are [[Steely Dan (band)|Steely Dan]] songs.&lt;ref name=Porcaro&gt;{{YouTube|id=pwyO1qr0edI|title=The Rosanna Half Time Shuffle by Jeff Porcaro}}. Accessed 31 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Fool in the Rain]]" by [[Led Zeppelin]] uses a derivation of the Purdie Shuffle, and [[Jeff Porcaro]] of [[Toto (band)|Toto]] created a hybridization of the Zeppelin and Purdie shuffles called the [[Rosanna shuffle]] for the track "[[Rosanna (song)|Rosanna]]".&lt;ref name=Porcaro /&gt;

[[File:Shuffle feel.png|thumb|right|250px|Quarter note shuffle&lt;ref&gt;Mattingly, Rick (2006). ''All About Drums'', p.44. Hal Leonard. {{ISBN|1-4234-0818-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Audio|Shuffle feel.mid|play}}]]
[[File:Half time shuffle.png|thumb|center|300px|"Basic half time shuffle"&lt;ref&gt;Potter, Dee (2001). ''The Drummer's Guide to Shuffles'', p.19. {{ISBN|0-634-01098-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Audio|Half time shuffle.mid|play}}.]]

It is important to realize that while in half time, the ''feel'' of notes are chopped in half, but the actual time ''value'' remains the same. For example, at the same tempo, 8th notes (quavers) would sound like 16ths (semiquavers). In the case of the half time shuffle, triplets sound like 16th note (semiquaver) triplets, etc. By preserving the tempo, the beat is stretched by a factor of 2.

In [[music]] and [[dance]], '''double-time''' is a type of [[meter (music)|meter]] and [[tempo]] or rhythmic feel by essentially ''halving the tempo resolution'' or metric [[divisive rhythm|division]]/level. It is also associated with specific [[time signature]]s such as {{music|time|2|2}}. Contrast with [[half time (music)|half time]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5658">[[Image:J-Dryden.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[John Dryden]], who formulated and wrote the heroic drama in the 1670s.]]
'''Heroic drama''' is a type of [[Play (theatre)|play]] popular during the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] era in [[England]], distinguished by both its verse structure and its subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene M. Waith, ''Ideas of Greatness: Heroic Drama in England'', London, Routledge, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Douglas Canfield, ''Heroes and States: On the Ideology of Restoration Tragedy'', Lexington, KY, University Press of Kentucky, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The subgenre of heroic drama evolved through several works of the middle to later 1660s; [[John Dryden]]'s ''[[The Indian Emperour]]'' ([[1665 in literature|1665]]) and [[Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery| Roger Boyle's]] ''[[The Black Prince (play)|The Black Prince]]'' ([[1667 in literature|1667]]) were key developments.

==Dryden in 1670==
The term "heroic drama" was invented by Dryden for his play, ''[[The Conquest of Granada]]'' ([[1670 in literature|1670]]).  For the ''Preface'' to the printed version of the play, Dryden argued that the drama was a species of ''[[epic poetry]]'' for the stage, that, as the epic was to other poetry, so the heroic drama was to other plays.  Consequently, Dryden derived a series of rules for this type of play.

First, the play should be composed in [[heroic verse]] (closed couplets in iambic pentameter).  Second, the play must focus on a subject that pertains to national foundations, mythological events, or important and grand matters.  Third, the hero of the heroic drama must be powerful, decisive, and, like [[Achilles]], dominating even when wrong.  ''The Conquest of Granada'' followed all of these rules.  The story was that of the national foundation of [[Spain]] (and [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] was known to be fond of Spanish plays), and the hero, Almanzor, was a man of great martial prowess and temperament.

Dryden's ''Conquest of Granada'' is often considered one of the better heroic tragedies, but his highest achievement is his adaptation (which he called ''All for Love'', 1678) of Shakespeare's ''Anthony and Cleopatra'' to the heroic formula. Other heroic dramatists were Nathaniel Lee (''The Rival Queens'') and Thomas Otway, whose ''Venice Preserved'' is a fine tragedy that transcends the usual limitations of the form. We also owe indirectly to heroic tragedy two very amusing parodies of the type: the Duke of Buckingham's ''The Rehearsal'' and Henry Fielding's ''The Tragedy of Tragedies, or the Life and Death of Tom Thumb the Great''

==Other dramatists==
"Those who associate 'heroic drama' primarily with the use of the 'heroic couplet' usually set as its extent the years from 1664 to 1678. This, certainly, is its period of fullest development and authority. Those who prefer to accentuate the elements suggested by the very term 'heroic' rather than the strict rhymed verse form are willing to admit wider limits."&lt;ref&gt;George Henry Nettleton, ''English Drama of the Restoration and Eighteenth Century, 1642&amp;ndash;1780'', New York, Macmillan, 1914; p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Restoration plays by Sir [[William Davenant]], [[Thomas Otway]], [[Nathaniel Lee]], [[John Crowne]], [[Elkanah Settle]], and [[John Banks (playwright)|John Banks]], and later works by [[Nicholas Rowe (writer)|Nicholas Rowe]] and [[Joseph Addison]], have been included in tighter or looser definitions of heroic drama.&lt;ref&gt;Nettleton, pp. 24-9; Waith, pp. 235-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heroic drama in literary criticism==
Today, drama is divided up into numerous subgenres; Dryden, however, worked from [[Classical literature|Classical]] critics.  There was little dramatic critical theory for him to appeal to, and the new rules brought over from [[France]] (particularly those of [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]] and [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]]) did not match English theatrical history or practice.  The emphasis on unities and on maintaining only Classically proscribed dramatic forms also came from [[Thomas Rymer]], who condemned the heterogeneity of the stage.  [[Aristotle]] had only spoken of [[satire]], [[Epic poetry|epic]], and [[tragedy]], and [[Horace]] also wrote only of [[comedy]], tragedy and satire, and so Dryden was seeking to square actual theatrical practice with an ancient framework for literature.  He was attempting his own neo-classicism.  The [[First Folio]] of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] had divided Shakespeare's plays into "history," "tragedy," and "comedy," but these terms were stretched.  Dryden, therefore, implicitly recognizes that drama had moved into the territory of other types of poetry, but he strives to restrain that freedom by reforming the stage to a true and epic subject matter. 

==Satirical response==
[[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham]] and others satirized heroic drama in ''[[The Rehearsal (play)|The Rehearsal]]''.  The satire was successful enough that heroic drama largely disappeared afterward.  Buckingham attacked the stupidity of blustering, military heroes, as well as the apparent self-importance of attempting a dramatic entertainment about the serious subjects of military and national history.

Buckingham's criticism of Dryden in ''[[The Rehearsal (play)|The Rehearsal]]'' is partly Dryden's bombastic verse but, more pointedly, Dryden's ''personal'' interest in creating a "pure" drama.  The character of Bayes is ludicrous more for his hubris in damning actual plays in favor of imagined ones than he is for being a poetaster.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40636">The discovery of [[disease]]-causing [[pathogen]]s is an important activity in the field of medical science.  Many [[virus]]es, [[bacteria]], [[protozoa]], [[fungi]], [[helminthes]] and [[prion]]s are identified as a confirmed or potential pathogen. In the United States, a [[Centers for Disease Control]] program, begun in 1995, identified over a hundred patients with life-threatening illnesses that were considered to be of an [[Infection|infectious]] cause, but that could not be linked to a known pathogen.&lt;ref name="DAY_1997"/&gt;  The association of pathogens with disease can be a complex and controversial process, in some cases requiring decades or even centuries to achieve.

==Factors impairing identification of pathogens==
Factors which have been identified as impeding the identification of pathogens include the following:

:'''1. Lack of animal models''': Experimental infection in animals has been used as a criterion to demonstrate a disease-causing ability, but for some pathogens (such as ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', which cause disease only in humans) animal models do not exist. In cases where animal models were not available, scientists have sometimes infected themselves or others to determine an organism's disease causing ability.&lt;ref name=autobiography&gt;{{cite web  | last =Barry   | first =Marshall  | title =Autobiography  | publisher =[[Nobel Foundation]]  | year =2005  | url =http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2005/marshall-autobio.html  | accessdate = 2007-01-28 | authorlink = Barry Marshall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''2. Pre-existing theories of disease''': Before a pathogen is well-recognized, scientists may attribute the symptoms of infection to other causes, such as [[Toxicology|toxicological]], [[Psychosomatic illness|psychological]], or [[Genetics|genetic]] causes. Once a pathogen has been associated with an illness, researchers have reported difficulty displacing these pre-existing theories.&lt;ref name="MARSHALL_2002"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Marshall  | first = Barry  | title = Helicobacter Pioneers: Firsthand Accounts from the Scientists who Discovered Helicobacters, 1892-1982  | publisher = Blackwell Publishing Limited  | date = May 1, 2002  | isbn = 978-0-86793-035-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BENT_1995"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bentivoglio M, Pacini P |title=Filippo Pacini: a determined observer |journal=Brain Res.

This theory was consistent with [[humorism]], and led to such medical practices as [[bloodletting]].&lt;ref name="CHAPIN_2006" /&gt; The bacterium was first reported in 1849 by [[Gabriel Pouchet]], who discovered it in [[human faeces|stools]] from patients with cholera, but he did not appreciate the significance of this presence.&lt;ref name="BULLOCH_1979"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Bulloch  | first = William   | title = The History of Bacteriology  | journal = Nature   | volume = 142   | issue = 3600   | year=1979  | pages=771-773  | isbn=978-0-486-23761-9| bibcode = 1938Natur.142..771D   | doi = 10.1038/142771a0   }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first scientist to understand the significance of ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' was the Italian anatomist [[Filippo Pacini]], who published detailed drawings of the organism in "Microscopical observations and pathological deductions on cholera" in 1854.&lt;ref name="BENT_1995" /&gt; He published further papers in 1866, 1871, 1876 and 1880, which were ignored by the scientific community.&lt;ref name="BENT_1995" /&gt;  He correctly described how the bacteria caused diarrhea, and developed treatments that were found to be effective.&lt;ref name="BENT_1995" /&gt; Whilst [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s edpidemiology maps were well recognised, and led to the removal of the Broad Street pump handle, e.g. [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]].

Some scientists opposed the new theory, and even drank cholera cultures to disprove it:

{{"
|Koch announced his discovery of the cholera vibrio in 1884. His conclusions were based upon the constant finding of the peculiar "comma bacillus" in the stools of cholera patients, and the failure to demonstrate this organism in the feces of other persons. It was not possible to reproduce typical cholera in laboratory animals. At the time the "germ theory" of disease had not yet obtained general acceptance, and Koch's announcement was received with considerable skepticism, particularly after it was found that similar "comma bacilli" could be found at times in the feces of persons not suffering from cholera, and often in all sorts of other environments - well and river waters, cheese, etc. We now know that these were saprotrophic species of Vibrio, which may be differentiated from the cholera vibrio by cultural and immunological methods. But the correctness of Koch's opinion was dramatically demonstrated by von Pettenkofer and Emmerich who, doubting the etiological relationship of Koch's organisms, deliberately drank cultures of it. Von Pettenkofer developed merely a transient diarrhea, but Emmerich suffered from a typical and severe attack of cholera. 
|by A. T. Henrici, ''The Biology of Bacteria'', DC Heath and Company, 1939. ASIN B00085GABK, 
}}

Von Pettenkofer considered his experience proof that ''Vibrio cholerae'' was harmless, as he did not develop cholera from consuming the culture.  Between 1849 when Pouchet discovered ''Vibrio cholerae'' and 1891, over a million people died in cholera epidemics in Europe and Russia.&lt;ref name="STITT_1922"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Stitt  | first = Edward  | title = The Diagnosis and Treatment of Tropical Diseases  | publisher = P.

If too many of them occur in a person, they will develop [[cystic fibrosis]], an incurable and often fatal genetic disorder.

===''Giardia lamblia'' (1681-1975)===

Giardiasis is a disease caused by infection with the protozoan ''[[Giardia lamblia]]''.  Infection with ''[[Giardia]]'' can produce diarrhea, gas, and abdominal pain in some people. If untreated, infection can be chronic. In children, chronic ''[[Giardia]]'' infection can cause [[Stunted growth|stunting]] (stunted growth) and lowered intelligence,&lt;ref name="ALI_2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ali SA, Hill DR |title=Giardia intestinalis |journal=Curr.

[http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/labs/aboutlabs/lpd/gastrointestinalParasitesSection/nash.htm Gastrointestinal Parasites Lab] studies ''[[Giardia]]'' almost exclusively.

However, ''[[Giardia]]'' experienced an extraordinarily long term of emergence, from its discovery in 1681, until the 1970s when it was fully accepted that infection with ''[[Giardia]]'' was a treatable cause of chronic diarrhea:

{{"
|''Giardia lamblia'' was first discovered by Leeuwenhoeck (1681) who found the parasite in his own {diarrheal} stools. It was long considered to be a harmless commensal organism, but in recent years has been recognized as a cause of intestinal disease often acquired by travelers to foreign countries, persons drinking contaminated water in this country, children in day care nurseries and homosexual males. It is the most common pathogenic intestinal parasite in the United States, being found in 4% of stool specimens submitted to state public health laboratories for parasite examination. Attesting to its increasing importance in the United States, a symposium on Giardiasis, sponsored by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], was held in the fall of 1978.&lt;ref name="SMITH_1980" /&gt;
|by JW Smith, ''Giardiasis'', 1980
}}

Some of the first evidence in modern times of ''Giardia's'' pathogenicity came during [[World War II]] when soldiers were treated for [[malaria]] with the antiprotozoal [[Quinacrine]], and their diarrhea disappeared, as did the ''[[Giardia]]'' from their stool samples. In 1954, Dr. R.C. Rendtorff  performed experiments on prisoner volunteers, infecting them with ''[[Giardia]]''.&lt;ref name=RENDTORFF&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rendtorff|first=RC |title=The experimental transmission of human intestinal protozoan parasites.

His experiments were described in the EPA Symposium on Waterborne Transmission of Giardiasis in 1979:

As a result we felt safe in exposing prisoners to Giardia...&lt;ref name=RENDTORFF/&gt;

In the communication, Veazie notes that he was unable to find a publisher for his account of the epidemic.  The communication was re-published in the ''EPA Symposium on Waterborne Transmission of Giardiasis'' in 1979, and that version included the following quote from the Director of the Oregon State Board of Health, suggesting that diarrhea from ''[[Giardia]]'' was still being attributed to other causes by health authorities in 1954:

===''Helicobacter pylori'' (1892-1982)===

Infection with the bacteria ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' is the cause of most stomach ulcers. The discovery is generally credited to Australian gastroenterologists Dr. [[Barry Marshall]] and Dr. J Robin Warren, who published their findings in 1983. The pair received the Nobel Prize in 2005 for their work. Before this, nobody really knew what caused stomach ulcers, though a popular belief was that the "stress" played a role. Some researchers suggested that ulcers were a [[psychosomatic]] illness.&lt;ref name="PAULLEY_1975"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paulley JW |title=Cultural influences on the incidence and pattern of disease |journal=Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=2–11 |year=1975 |pmid=1178798 |doi=10.1159/000286889}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KELLNER_1975"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kellner R |title=Psychotherapy in psychosomatic disorders |journal=Arch.

In ''H Pylori Pioneers'', Dr. Marshall noted that other physicians had produced evidence of ''[[H. pylori]]'' infection as early as 1892.&lt;ref name="MARSHALL_2002" /&gt; Marshall writes that earlier reports were disregarded because they conflicted with existing belief. The first description of ''H. Pylori'' came in 1892 from Giulio Bizzozero, who identified acid-tolerant bacteria living in a dog’s stomach. Later, a theory would be developed that no bacteria could live in the stomach.&lt;ref name="MARSHALL_2002" /&gt; Although the theory has no scientific basis, it would become a stumbling block for scientists, discouraging them for searching for infective causes of stomach ulcers. In 1940, two physicians, Dr. A. Stone Freeberg and Dr. Louis E. Barron published a paper describing a spiral bacteria found in about half of their gastroenterology patients who had stomach ulcers. Dr. [[John Lykoudis]], a Greek physician, was one of the first physicians to treat stomach ulcers as an infectious disease. Between 1960 and 1970, he treated over 10,000 ulcer patients in Athens with antibiotics.&lt;ref name="RIGAS_1999"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rigas B, Feretis C, Papavassiliou ED |title=John Lykoudis: an unappreciated discoverer of the cause and treatment of peptic ulcer disease |journal=Lancet |volume=354 |issue=9190 |pages=1634–5 |year=1999 |pmid=10560691 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(99)06034-1|last2=Feretis |last3=Papavassiliou }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lykoudis tried to publish a paper on his findings, but they conflicted with traditional theory, and his work was never published.&lt;ref name="MARSHALL_2002" /&gt;  Lykoudis' experience was followed in 1975 by a further publication in Gut magazine that included spiral bacteria living on the borders of duodonal ulcers.&lt;ref name="STEER_1975"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Steer HW, Colin-Jones DG |title=Mucosal changes in gastric ulceration and their response to carbenoxolone sodium |journal=Gut |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=590–7 |year=1975 |pmid=810394 |doi=10.1136/gut.16.8.590 |pmc=1411007|last2=Colin-Jones }}&lt;/ref&gt; The medical significance of Steer’s findings was disregarded, but he “continued to publish papers on ''[[H. Pylori]]'', mostly as a hobby."&lt;ref name="MARSHALL_2002" /&gt;

''[[H. pylori]]'' can infect the stomach of some people without causing stomach ulcers. In investigating asymptomatic carriers of ''[[H. pylori]]'', researchers identified a genetic trait called Interleuik-1 beta-31 which causes increased production of stomach acid, resulting in ulcers if patients become infected with ''[[H. pylori]]''. Patients without the trait do not develop stomach ulcers in response to ''[[H. pylori]]'' infection, but instead have increased risk from stomach cancer if they become infected.&lt;ref name="EL-OMAR_2000" /&gt; Investigation into other gastrointestinal infections has also shown that the symptoms are the result of interaction between the infection and specific genetic mutations in the host.

===Pathogenic variants of ''Escherichia coli'' (1947-1983)===

There are different types of ''[[E. coli]]'', some of which are found in humans and are harmless.  [[Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli]] (ETEC) is a type found to cause illness in humans, possessing [[gene]] that allows it to manufacture a substance toxic to humans. Cattle are immune to its effects but when people eat food contaminated with cattle feces, the organism can cause disease.

===Human immunodeficiency virus (1959-1984)===

AIDS was first reported June 5, 1981, when the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] recorded a cluster of [[Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)|''Pneumocystis carinii'' pneumonia]] (now still classified as PCP but known to be caused by [[Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)|''Pneumocystis jirovecii'']]) in five homosexual men in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=MMWR2&gt;{{cite web

However, HIV existed long before the 1981 CDC report. Three of the earliest known instances of HIV infection are as follows:

Two species of HIV infect humans: [[HIV-1]] and [[HIV-2]]. HIV-1 is more virulent and more easily transmitted.

[[Cyclospora]] is a gastrointestinal pathogen that causes fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and severe weight loss.  Outbreaks of the disease occurred in [[Chicago]] in 1989 and other areas in the United States.&lt;ref name=GOLEMAN_1995&gt;{{cite news   | last = Goleman  | first =Daniel  | title = Tiny Clinic in Katmandy Solves Mystery  | publisher = New York Times  | date = January 3, 1995  | url =  https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEFD7163AF930A35752C0A963958260&amp;sec=travel&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink  | accessdate = 2007-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But investigation by the [[Center for Disease Control]] could not identify an infectious cause. The discovery of the cause was made by Mr. Ramachandran Rajah, the head of a medical clinic's laboratory in [[Kathmandu]], Nepal. Mr. Rajah was trying to discover why local residents and visitors were becoming ill every summer.&lt;ref name="GOLEMAN_1995" /&gt; He identified an unusual looking organism in stool samples from patients who were sick. But when the clinic sent slides of the organism to the [[Center for Disease Control]], it was identified as blue-green algae, which is harmless. Many pathologists had seen the same thing before, but dismissed it as irrelevant to the patient's disease.&lt;ref name="GOLEMAN_1995" /&gt; Later, the organism would be identified as a special kind of parasite, and treatment would be developed to help patients with the infection. In the United States, [[Cyclospora]] infection must be reported to the [[Center for Disease Control]] according to the [https://www.cdc.gov/epo/dphsi/phs/infdis2007r.htm CDC's Reportable Disease Chart]

==Present day discoveries==

The process of identifying new infectious agents continues. One study has suggested there are a large number of pathogens already causing illness in the population, but they have not yet been properly identified.&lt;ref name="DAY_1997"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Day M |title=Stalking the diseases with no name |journal=New Scientist  | date=June 7, 1997 | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15420850.600-stalking-the-diseases-with-no-name.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gastrointestinal pathogens===

Many recently emerged pathogens infect the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. For example, there are three gastrointestinal protozoal infections which must be reported to the [[Center for Disease Control]].&lt;ref name=CDC2007&gt;{{cite web

====''Dientamoeba fragilis''====

''[[Dientamoeba fragilis]]'' is a single-celled parasite which infects the large intestine causing diarrhea, gas, and abdominal pain. An Australian study identified patients with symptoms of IBS who were actually infected with ''Dientamoeba fragilis''.&lt;ref name="BORODY_2002" /&gt; Their symptoms resolved following treatment. A study in Denmark identified a high incidence ''Dientamoeba fragilis'' infection in a group of patients suspected of having gastrointestinal illness of an infectious nature.&lt;ref name="STENSVOLD_2007F"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stensvold CR, Arendrup MC, Mølbak K, Nielsen HV |title=The prevalence of Dientamoeba fragilis in patients with suspected enteroparasitic disease in a metropolitan area in Denmark |journal=Clin.

====''Blastocystis''====

''Blastocystis'' is a single-celled protozoan which infects the large intestine. Physicians report that patients with infection show symptoms of abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea.&lt;ref name="QADRI_1989"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Qadri SM, al-Okaili GA, al-Dayel F |title=Clinical significance of ''Blastocystis'' hominis |journal=J.

'''''Homo consumericus''''' ([[mock Latin]] for consumerist person) is a [[neologism]] used in the social sciences, notably by [[Gad Saad]] in his book ''The Evolutionary Bases of Consumption''&lt;ref&gt;Gad Saad, ''The Evolutionary Bases of Consumption'' (Routledge, 2007) {{ISBN|0-8058-5149-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Gilles Lipovetsky]] in ''Le Bonheur Paradoxal''.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Lipovetsky, ''Le bonheur paradoxal, Essai sur la société d'hyperconsommation'', (éditions Gallimard, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; According to these and other scholars the phenomenon of [[mass consumption]] could be compared to certain traits of human psychology described by [[Evolution theory|evolutionary scientists]] pointing out similarities between [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] principles and [[consumer behaviour]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jmsb.concordia.ca/~GadSaad/Jill%20Sundie-%20Review%20of%20my%20book.pdf Jill M.

{{Introduction to genetics glossary}}

'''Genetics''' is the study of [[heredity]] and variations.  Heredity and variations are controlled by [[gene]]s—what they are, what they do, and how they work.  Genes inside the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] of a [[cell (biology)|cell]] are strung together in such a way that the sequence carries [[information]]: that information determines how living [[organism]]s [[heredity|inherit]] various features ([[phenotypic trait]]s). For example, [[offspring]] produced by [[sexual reproduction]] usually look similar to each of their parents because they have inherited some of each of their parents' genes. Genetics identifies which features are inherited, and explains how these features pass from [[generation]] to generation. In addition to inheritance, genetics studies how genes are turned on and off to control what substances are made in a cell—[[gene expression]]; and how a cell divides—[[mitosis]] or [[meiosis]].

Some phenotypic traits can be seen, such as eye color while others can only be detected, such as [[blood type]] or intelligence. Traits determined by genes can be modified by the animal's surroundings (environment): for example, the general design of a tiger's stripes is inherited, but the specific stripe pattern is determined by the tiger's surroundings. Another example is a person's height: it is determined by both genetics and [[nutrition]].

[[Chromosome]]s are tiny packages which contain one [[DNA]] molecule and its associated proteins. Humans have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs). This number varies between [[species]]—for example, many [[primate]]s have 24 pairs. Meiosis creates special cells, [[sperm]] in males and [[egg]]s in females, which only have 23 chromosomes. These two cells merge into one during the [[fertilization]] stage of sexual reproduction, creating a [[zygote]].  In a zygote, a [[nucleic acid double helix]] divides, with each single helix occupying one of the daughter cells, resulting in half the normal number of genes. By the time the zygote divides again, [[genetic recombination]] has created a new [[embryo]] with 23 pairs of chromosomes, half from each parent. [[Mating]] and resultant [[mate choice]] result in [[sexual selection]]. In normal cell division ([[mitosis]]) is possible when the double helix separates, and a complement of each separated half is made, resulting in two identical double helices in one cell, with each occupying one of the two new daughter cells created when the cell divides.

Chromosomes all contain DNA made up of four [[nucleotide]]s, abbreviated  C ([[cytosine]]), G ([[guanine]]), A ([[adenine]]), or T ([[thymine]]), which line up in a particular sequence and make a long string. There are two strings of nucleotides coiled around one another in each chromosome: a [[double helix]]. C on one string is always opposite from G on the other string; A is always opposite T. There are about 3.2 billion nucleotide pairs on all the human chromosomes: this is the [[human genome]]. The order of the nucleotides carries genetic information, whose rules are defined by the [[genetic code]], similar to how the order of letters on a page of text carries information. Three nucleotides in a row—a triplet—carry one unit of information: a codon. 

The genetic code not only controls inheritance: it also controls [[gene expression]], which occurs when a portion of the double helix is uncoiled, exposing a series of the nucleotides, which are within the interior of the DNA. This series of exposed triplets (codons) carries the information to allow machinery in the cell to "read" the codons on the exposed DNA, which results in the making of [[RNA]] molecules. RNA in turn makes either [[amino acids]] or [[microRNA]], which are responsible for all of the structure and function of a living organism; i.e. they determine all the features of the cell and thus the entire individual. Closing the uncoiled segment turns off the gene.    
      
The [[heritability]] of a trait (like height) in a population essentially conveys what percentage of the observed variation comes from differences in genes vs. differences in environment. Each unique form of a single gene is called an [[allele]]; different forms are collectively called [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]]. As an example, one allele for the gene for hair color and skin cell pigmentation could instruct the body to produce black pigment, producing black hair and pigmented skin; while a different allele of the same gene in a different individual could give garbled instructions that would result in a failure to produce any pigment, giving white hair and no pigmented skin: [[albinism]]. [[Mutation]]s are random changes in genes creating new alleles, which in turn produce new traits, which could help, harm, or have no new effect on the individual's likelihood of survival; thus, mutations are the basis for [[Introduction to evolution|evolution]].

==Inheritance in biology==

===Genes and inheritance===
[[File:ADN animation.gif|frame|150px|left|A section of [[DNA]]; the sequence of the plate-like units ([[nucleotide]]s) in the center carries information.]]
[[File:Red Headed Young Man.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Red hair is a [[Dominance relationship#Recessive allele|recessive]] trait.]]

Genes are pieces of DNA that contain information for synthesis of ribonucleic acids (RNAs) or polypeptides. Genes are inherited as units, with two parents dividing out copies of their genes to their offspring. This process can be compared with mixing two hands of cards, shuffling them, and then dealing them out again. Humans have two copies of each of their genes, and make copies that are found in eggs or sperm—but they only include ''one'' copy of each type of gene. An egg and sperm join to form a complete set of genes. The eventually resulting offspring has the same number of genes as their parents, but for any gene one of their two copies comes from their father, and one from their mother.&lt;ref name=Utah/&gt;

The effects of this mixing depend on the types (the [[allele]]s) of the gene. If the father has two copies of an allele for red hair, and the mother has two copies for brown hair, all their children get the two alleles that give different instructions, one for red hair and one for brown. The hair color of these children depends on how these alleles work together. If one allele [[dominance (genetics)|dominates]] the instructions from another, it is called the ''dominant'' allele, and the allele that is overridden is called the ''recessive'' allele. In the case of a daughter with alleles for both red and brown hair, brown is dominant and she ends up with brown hair.&lt;ref name=OMIM&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/155555 MELANOCORTIN 1 RECEPTOR], Accessed 27 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the red color allele is still there in this brown-haired girl, it doesn't show. This is a difference between what you see on the surface (the traits of an organism, called its [[phenotype]]) and the genes within the organism (its [[genotype]]). In this example you can call the allele for brown "B" and the allele for red "b". (It is normal to write dominant alleles with capital letters and recessive ones with lower-case letters.) The brown hair daughter has the "brown hair phenotype" but her genotype is Bb, with one copy of the B allele, and one of the b allele.

Now imagine that this woman grows up and has children with a brown-haired man who also has a Bb genotype. Her eggs will be a mixture of two types, one sort containing the B allele, and one sort the b allele. Similarly, her partner will produce a mix of two types of sperm containing one or the other of these two alleles. When the transmitted genes are joined up in their offspring, these children have a chance of getting either brown or red hair, since they could get a genotype of BB = brown hair, Bb = brown hair or bb = red hair. In this generation, there is therefore a chance of the recessive allele showing itself in the phenotype of the children—some of them may have red hair like their grandfather.&lt;ref name=OMIM/&gt;

Many traits are inherited in a more complicated way than the example above. This can happen when there are several genes involved, each contributing a small part to the end result. Tall people tend to have tall children because their children get a package of many alleles that each contribute a bit to how much they grow. However, there are not clear groups of "short people" and "tall people", like there are groups of people with brown or red hair. This is because of the large number of genes involved; this makes the trait very variable and people are of many different heights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childrensnyp.org/mschony/P02134.html  Multifactorial Inheritance] Health Library, Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, Accessed 20 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a common misconception, the green/blue eye traits are also inherited in this complex inheritance model.&lt;ref name=Athro&gt;[http://www.athro.com/evo/gen/inherit1.html#uncertainty Eye color is more complex than two genes], Athro Limited, Accessed 27 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Inheritance can also be complicated when the trait depends on interaction between genetics and environment. For example, malnutrition does not change traits like eye color, but can stunt growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.med.umich.edu/opm/newspage/2003/kidheight.htm |title=Low income kids' height doesn't measure up by age 1 |publisher=University of Michigan Health System |accessdate=May 20, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526034018/http://www.med.umich.edu/opm/newspage/2003/kidheight.htm |archivedate=26 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inherited diseases===
Some diseases are hereditary and run in families; others, such as [[infectious disease]]s, are caused by the environment. Other diseases come from a combination of genes and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genome.gov/19016930 requently Asked Questions About Genetic Disorders] NIH, Accessed 20 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genetic disorder]]s are diseases that are caused by a single allele of a gene and are inherited in families. These include [[Huntington's disease]], [[Cystic fibrosis]] or [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]]. Cystic fibrosis, for example, is caused by mutations in a single gene called ''[[CFTR (gene)|CFTR]]'' and is inherited as a recessive trait.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=cysticfibrosis  Cystic fibrosis] Genetics Home Reference, NIH, Accessed 16 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Other diseases are influenced by genetics, but the genes a person gets from their parents only change their risk of getting a disease. Most of these diseases are inherited in a complex way, with either multiple genes involved, or coming from both genes and the environment. As an example, the risk of [[breast cancer]] is 50 times higher in the families most at risk, compared to the families least at risk. This variation is probably due to a large number of alleles, each changing the risk a little bit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peto J |title=Breast cancer susceptibility-A new look at an old model |journal=Cancer Cell |volume=1 |issue=5 |pages=411–2 |date=June 2002 |pmid=12124169 |doi=10.1016/S1535-6108(02)00079-X |issn=1535-6108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the genes have been identified, such as ''[[BRCA1]]'' and ''[[BRCA2]]'', but not all of them. However, although some of the risk is genetic, the risk of this cancer is also increased by being overweight, drinking a lot of alcohol and not exercising.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_4_2X_What_are_the_risk_factors_for_breast_cancer_5.asp What Are the Risk Factors for Breast Cancer?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429042057/http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_4_2X_What_are_the_risk_factors_for_breast_cancer_5.asp |date=29 April 2009 }} American Cancer Society, Accessed 16 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A woman's risk of breast cancer therefore comes from a large number of alleles interacting with her environment, so it is very hard to predict.

==How genes work==

===Genes make proteins===
{{main|Genetic code}}
The function of genes is to provide the information needed to make molecules called [[protein]]s in cells.&lt;ref name=Utah&gt;{{Cite book| title =University of Utah Genetics Learning Center animated tour of the basics of genetics| publisher =Howstuffworks.com| url =http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/units/basics/tour| accessdate =2008-01-24| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080210023634/http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/units/basics/tour/| archivedate =10 February 2008| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cells are the smallest independent parts of organisms: the human body contains about 100 trillion cells, while very small organisms like [[bacteria]] are just one single cell. A cell is like a miniature and very complex factory that can make all the parts needed to produce a copy of itself, which happens when cells [[cell division|divide]]. There is a simple division of labor in cells—genes give instructions and proteins carry out these instructions, tasks  like building a new copy of a cell, or repairing damage.&lt;ref name=NIGMS&gt;[http://publications.nigms.nih.gov/structlife/chapter1.html The Structures of Life] National Institute of General Medical Sciences, Accessed 20 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Each type of protein is a specialist that only does one job, so if a cell needs to do something new, it must make a new protein to do this job. Similarly, if a cell needs to do something faster or slower than before, it makes more or less of the protein responsible. Genes tell cells what to do by telling them which proteins to make and in what amounts.

[[File:Genetic code.svg|thumb|image|right|280px|Genes are expressed by being [[transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] into RNA, and this RNA then [[protein biosynthesis|translated]] into protein.]]

Proteins are made of a chain of 20 different types of [[amino acid]] molecules. This chain folds up into a compact shape, rather like an untidy ball of string. The shape of the protein is determined by the sequence of amino acids along its chain and it is this shape that, in turn, determines what the protein does.&lt;ref name=NIGMS/&gt; For example, some proteins have parts of their surface that perfectly match the shape of another molecule, allowing the protein to bind to this molecule very tightly. Other proteins are [[enzyme]]s, which are like tiny machines that alter other molecules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.howstuffworks.com/cell2.htm Enzymes] HowStuffWorks, Accessed 20 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The information in DNA is held in the sequence of the repeating units along the DNA chain.&lt;ref name=nih&gt;[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/basics/dna  What is DNA?] Genetics Home Reference, Accessed 16 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; These units are four types of [[nucleotide]]s (A,T,G and C) and the sequence of nucleotides stores information in an alphabet called the [[genetic code]]. When a gene is read by a cell the DNA sequence is copied into a very similar molecule called [[RNA]] (this process is called [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]). Transcription is controlled by other DNA sequences (such as [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]]s), which show a cell where genes are, and control how often they are copied. The RNA copy made from a gene is then fed through a structure called a [[ribosome]], which translates the sequence of nucleotides in the RNA into the correct sequence of amino acids and joins these amino acids together to make a complete protein chain. The new protein then folds up into its active form. The process of moving information from the language of RNA into the language of amino acids is called [[protein biosynthesis|translation]].&lt;ref name=nobel&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/educational_games/medicine/dna/index.html DNA-RNA-Protein] Nobelprize.org, Accessed 20 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DNA replication split.svg|thumb|left|[[DNA replication]]. DNA is unwound and [[nucleotide]]s are matched to make two new strands.]]

If the sequence of the nucleotides in a gene changes, the sequence of the amino acids in the protein it produces may also change—if part of a gene is deleted, the protein produced is shorter and may not work any more.&lt;ref name=NIGMS/&gt; This is the reason why different alleles of a gene can have different effects in an organism. As an example, hair color depends on how much of a dark substance called [[melanin]] is put into the hair as it grows. If a person has a normal set of the genes involved in making melanin, they make all the proteins needed and they grow dark hair. However, if the alleles for a particular protein have different sequences and produce proteins that can't do their jobs, no melanin is produced and the person has white skin and hair ([[albinism]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albinism.org/publications/what_is_albinism.html What is Albinism?] The National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation, Accessed 20 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genes are copied===
{{main|DNA replication}}
Genes are copied each time a cell divides into two new cells. The process that copies DNA is called [[DNA replication]].&lt;ref name=nih/&gt; It is through a similar process that a child inherits genes from its parents, when a copy from the mother is mixed with a copy from the father.

DNA can be copied very easily and accurately because each piece of DNA can direct the creation of a new copy of its information. This is because DNA is made of two strands that pair together like the two sides of a zipper. The nucleotides are in the center, like the teeth in the zipper, and pair up to hold the two strands together. Importantly, the four different sorts of nucleotides are different shapes, so for the strands to close up properly, an '''A''' nucleotide must go opposite a '''T''' nucleotide, and a '''G''' opposite a '''C'''. This exact pairing is called [[base pairing]].&lt;ref name=nih/&gt;

When DNA is copied, the two strands of the old DNA are pulled apart by enzymes; then they pair up with new nucleotides and then close. This produces two new pieces of DNA, each containing one strand from the old DNA and one newly made strand. This process is not predictably perfect as proteins attach to a nucleotide while they are building and cause a change in the sequence of that gene. These changes in DNA sequence are called [[mutation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/units/disorders/mutations/ Mutations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515113857/http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/units/disorders/mutations/ |date=15 May 2008 }} The University of Utah, Genetic Science Learning Center, Accessed 20 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Mutations produce new alleles of genes. Sometimes these changes stop the functioning of that gene or make it serve another advantageous function, such as the melanin genes discussed above. These mutations and their effects on the traits of organisms are one of the causes of [[evolution]].&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;

==Genes and evolution==
{{further|Introduction to evolution|History of evolutionary thought|Evolutionary developmental biology}}
[[File:PCWmice1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mouse|Mice]] with different coat colors]]

A population of organisms evolves when an inherited trait becomes more common or less common over time.&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;{{Cite book|first = Marshall| last= Brain | contribution =How Evolution Works | contribution-url =http://science.howstuffworks.com/evolution.htm/printable | title =How Stuff Works: Evolution Library| publisher =Howstuffworks.com | url =http://science.howstuffworks.com/evolution-channel.htm|accessdate=2008-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, all the mice living on an island would be a single population of mice: some with white fur, some gray. If over generations, white mice became more frequent and gray mice less frequent, then the color of the fur in this population of mice would be [[evolving]]. In terms of genetics, this is called an increase in [[allele frequency]].

Alleles become more or less common either by chance in a process called [[genetic drift]], or by [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evo101/IIIMechanisms.shtml Mechanisms: The Processes of Evolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527163721/http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evo101/IIIMechanisms.shtml |date=27 May 2008 }} Understanding Evolution, Accessed 20 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In natural selection, if an allele makes it more likely for an organism to survive and reproduce, then over time this allele becomes more common. But if an allele is harmful, natural selection makes it less common. In the above example, if the island were getting colder each year and snow became present for much of the time, then the allele for white fur would favor survival, since predators would be less likely to see them against the snow, and more likely to see the gray mice. Over time white mice would become more and more frequent, while gray mice less and less.

Mutations create new alleles. These alleles have new DNA sequences and can produce proteins with new properties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evo101/IIICGeneticvariation.shtml Genetic Variation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527163711/http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evo101/IIICGeneticvariation.shtml |date=27 May 2008 }} Understanding Evolution, Accessed 20 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; So if an island was populated entirely by black mice, mutations could happen creating alleles for white fur. The combination of mutations creating new alleles at random, and natural selection picking out those that are useful, causes [[adaptation]]. This is when organisms change in ways that help them to survive and reproduce. Many such changes, studied in [[evolutionary developmental biology]], affect [[embryogenesis|the way the embryo develops]] into an adult body.

==Genetic engineering==
{{main|Genetic engineering}}
Since traits come from the genes in a cell, putting a new piece of DNA into a cell can produce a new trait. This is how [[genetic engineering]] works. For example, rice can be given genes from a maize and a soil bacteria so the rice produces [[beta-carotene]], which the body converts to Vitamin A.&lt;ref&gt;Staff [http://www.goldenrice.org/ Golden Rice Project] Retrieved 5 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This can help children suffering from Vitamin A deficiency. Another gene being put into some crops comes from the bacterium ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]''; the gene makes a protein that is an [[insecticide]]. The insecticide kills insects that eat the plants, but is harmless to people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ars.usda.gov/is/ar/archive/nov99/pest1199.htm  Tifton, Georgia: A Peanut Pest Showdown] USDA, accessed 16 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In these plants, the new genes are put into the plant before it is grown, so the genes are in every part of the plant, including its seeds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmo-safety.eu/basic-info/129.bacterial-arsenal-combat-chewing-insects.html  Genetic engineering: Bacterial arsenal to combat chewing insects] GMO Safety, Jul 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The plant's offspring inherit the new genes, which has led to concern about the spread of new traits into wild plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geo-pie.cornell.edu/gmo.html Genetically engineered organisms public issues education] Cornell University, Accessed 16 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The kind of technology used in genetic engineering is also being developed to treat people with [[genetic disorder]]s in an experimental medical technique called [[gene therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Staff|date= November 18, 2005| url = http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/medicine/genetherapy.shtml| title = Gene Therapy| format = FAQ| work = Human Genome Project Information| publisher = [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]| accessdate = 2006-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, here the new gene is put in after the person has grown up and become ill, so any new gene is not inherited by their children. Gene therapy works by trying to replace the allele that causes the disease with an allele that works properly.

The ''Liber physiognomiae'' itself is divided into three sections, which deal with various concepts like procreation, generation, dream interpretation, and physiognomy proper.

The information found in the ''Liber physiognomiae'' seems to have been derived largely from Arabic copies of Aristotelian and [[Pseudo-Aristotle|Pseudo-Aristotelian]] works. The work was written in the early 13th century for [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], but was first officially printed in 1477. ''Liber physiognomiae'' would go on to be very popular, and would be reprinted many times. Scot's work had a major influence on physiognomy itself, and heavily affected how it would be approached and applied in the future.

== Background ==

''Liber physiognomiae'' was written by the Scottish mathematician [[Michael Scot]] (AD 1175 – c. 1232) and is the final entry in a divination-centered trilogy, collectively titled the ''[[Liber introductorius]]'' (''The Great Introductory Book'').{{#tag:ref|Some sources refer to the first book in the trilogy as the ''Liber introductorius'',&lt;ref&gt;Examples includes: [[#Edwards|Edwards (1985)]]; [[#Kay|Kay (1985)]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas other sources specify that the first book is the ''Liber quatuor distinctionum'' and that ''Liber introductorius'' is the name of the trilogy as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Examples include: [[#Meyer|Meyer (2010)]]; [[#Pick|Pick (1998)]], p. 96; [[#Resnick|Resnick (2012)]], p. 15, note 10.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}} This trilogy also includes the ''Liber quatuor distinctionum'' (''The Book of the Four Distinctions'') and the ''Liber particularis'' (''The Singular Book'').&lt;ref name=resnicknote&gt;[[#Resnick|Resnick (2012)]], p. 15, note 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kay5&gt;[[#Kay|Kay (1985)]], p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kay|Kay (1985)]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scott|Scott &amp; Marketos (2014)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Liber physiognomiae'', as the title suggests, concerns [[physiognomy]], or a technique by which a person's character or personality is deduced based on their outer appearance. Scot refers to this as a "doctrine of salvation" (''Phisionomia est doctrina salutis''), as it easily allows one to determine if a person is virtuous or evil.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Resnick|Resnick (2012)]], p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Resnick|Resnick (2012)]], p. 16, note 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The book is relatively short, comprising about sixty [[octavo]] pages.&lt;ref name=kay5 /&gt; The work is usually divided into around one hundred chapters, with the number of chapters and their divisions differing greatly depending on what manuscript is being consulted.&lt;ref name=thorn87&gt;[[#Thorndike|Thorndike (1965)]], p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the chapter headings vary across manuscripts, scholars are in agreement that the work is made up of three distinct sections. The first of these deals with the concepts of procreation and generation, largely according to the doctrines of [[Aristotle]] and [[Galen]].&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;[[#Baynes|Baynes &amp; Smith (1891)]], p. 491.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=contents&gt;[[#Brown|Brown (1897)]], p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; This section opens by stressing the important influence of the stars before it deals with topics concerning human [[sexual intercourse]]. The book then moves onto the topics of conception and birth, and the author then explores the physical signs of pregnancy. The final two chapters of this section deal with animals; the penultimate chapter focuses on "animals ''in genere et in specie''" (i.e. in regards to genus and species),{{#tag:ref|In [[Aristotle's biology|his biology]], Aristotle used the term γένος (génos) to mean a general 'kind' and εἶδος (eidos) to mean a specific [[Hylomorphism|form]] within a kind. For instance, "bird" would be a ''génos'', whereas an eagle would be an ''eidos''. ''Génos''and ''eidos'' were later translated into Latin as "genus" and "species", though they do not correspond to the [[Linnean taxonomy|Linnean terms]] thus named.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leroi|Leroi (2014)]], pp. 88{{en dash}}90.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that Scot was writing before the Linnean terms were developed, his use of the words "genus" and "species" retain their Aristotelian meanings.|group="nb"}} while the final details an idiosyncratic system for differentiating the various types of animals.&lt;ref name=thorn8788&gt;[[#Thorndike|Thorndike (1965)]], pp. 87{{en dash}}88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second section begins to focus specifically on physiognomy, considering different organs and body regions that index the "character and faculties" of individuals.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name=contents /&gt;&lt;ref name=thorn88&gt;[[#Thorndike|Thorndike (1965)]], p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Early chapters in this portion of the book are written in a medical style, and they detail signs in regards to "temperate and healthy bod[ies] ... repletion of bad [[Humorism|humours]] and excess of blood, cholera, phlegm, and melancholy", before turning to particular sections of the body.&lt;ref name=thorn88 /&gt; Several following chapters discuss [[Dream interpretation|dreams and their meanings]]. Scot argues that dreams are: true or false; represent past, present, or future events; or are entirely meaningless.&lt;ref name=thorn89&gt;[[#Thorndike|Thorndike (1965)]], p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The second section comes to an end with chapters concerning [[augury|auguries]] and sneezes, respectively.&lt;ref name=thorn90&gt;[[#Thorndike|Thorndike (1965)]], p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third and final section covers body parts, and explicates what the characteristics of these portions may reveal about the nature of the person in question.&lt;ref name=contents /&gt; The final chapter in this section warns the would-be physiognomist to withhold judgement based solely on one part of their body, but rather to "tend always to a general judgement based on the majority of all [the person's] members."&lt;ref name=thorn91&gt;[[#Thorndike|Thorndike (1965)]], p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because another part which has not been consulted may readily counter a conclusion suggested by a part that has. Scot also argues that a physiognomist should take into account a person's "age, long residence in one place, long social usage, excessive prevalence of the humours of his complexion beyond what is customary, accidental sickness, violence, accidents contrary to nature, and a defect of one of the five natural senses."&lt;ref name=thorn91 /&gt;

=== Sources ===

According to the physiognomy scholar Martin Porter, the ''Liber physiognomiae'' is a "distinctly Aristotelian" compendium of "the more Arabic influenced 'medical' aspects of natural philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Porter|Porter (2005)]], p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Porter|Porter (2005)]], p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it seems likely that Scot made use of several Aristotelian and [[Pseudo-Aristotle|Pseudo-Aristotelian]] works in the writing of the ''Liber physiognomiae'', many of which were derived from Arabic copies. The first of these is an Arabic translation of the ''[[History of Animals|Historia Animalium]]''.&lt;ref name=brown38 /&gt; The second is the ''[[Secretum Secretorum|Kitāb Sirr al-Asrār]]'' ({{lang-ar|كتاب سر الأسرار}}; known in Latin as the ''Secreta Secretorum''), an Arabic text that purports to be a letter from Aristotle to his student [[Alexander the Great]] on a range of topics, including physiognomy.&lt;ref name=brown3237&gt;[[#Brown|Brown (1897)]], pp. 32{{en dash}}37.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|James Wood Brown argues it is "beyond question" that Scot used the Latin-translation of this text, the ''Secretum Secretorum'', in writing the ''Liber physiognomiae''; Haskins, on the other hand, argues that Scot's work is related to the Latin version only "through a common Arabic source".&lt;ref name=haskins262 /&gt;&lt;ref name=brown3237 /&gt; Lynn Thorndike seems to favor Haskins hypothesis, aruging "Michael, himself a translator of long standing from the Arabic, could have made direct use of the Arabic text ... Other evidence makes it more likely that Philip knew of Michael's ''Physiognomy'' and that his translation of ''Secreta secretorum'' was subsequent to it."&lt;ref name="thorn91" /&gt;|group="nb"}} The third of these works is ''[[Physiognomonics]]'', also [[Pseudepigrapha|attributed]] to Aristotle and, as the title suggests, also about physiognomy; the influence of this Pseudo-Aristotelian work, according to Haskins, is "limited to the preface" of the ''Liber physiognomiae''.&lt;ref name=haskins262 /&gt;&lt;ref name=brown38&gt;[[#Brown|Brown (1897)]], p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Scot probably used the original Greek version of ''Physiognomonics'' to write his book.{{#tag:ref|Because it is believed that the first Latin version of the ''Physiognomonics'' was translated directly from the original Greek by Bartholomew of Messina several years after Scot's ''Liber physiognomiae'' was written,&lt;ref name=brown38 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Knuuttila|Knuuttila &amp; Sihvola (2013)]], p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and because no Arabic translation of the work is known to exist, the fact that several passages in Scot's book correspond to passages from Bartholomew of Messina's Latin version of the ''Physiognomonics'' suggests that the two were working from the same (Greek) source. This is evidence that Scot had a working knowledge of Greek.&lt;ref name=brown38 /&gt;|group="nb"}} The historian [[Charles Homer Haskins]] argues that the ''Liber physiognomiae'' also "makes free use" of [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi]] (also known as Rhazes) and shows "some affinities" with [[Trotula]] texts and writers of the [[Schola Medica Salernitana]] (a [[medical school]] located in the Italian town of [[Salerno]]).&lt;ref name=haskins262&gt;[[#Haskins|Haskins (1921)]], p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication history and popularity ==

[[File:Frederick II and eagle.jpg|thumb|upright|The work was dedicated to [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]].]]

The work was written sometime in the early 13th century, and is explicitly dedicated to [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]. The scholar James Wood Brown argues that the book was likely written for the soon-to-be [[Holy Roman Emperor]] Frederick II in AD 1209 on the occasion of his wedding to [[Constance of Aragon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brown|Brown (1897)]], p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Brown also adds, "No date suits this publication so well as 1209, and nothing but the urgent desire of Court and people that the marriage should prove fruitful can explain, one might add excuse, some passages of almost [[Fescennine Verses|fescennine]] license which it contains."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brown|Brown (1897)]], pp. 30{{en dash}}31.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy and religion scholar Irven Resnick argues that the work was given to Frederick so that "the emperor [might be able] to distinguish, from outward appearances, trustworthy and wise counselors from their opposite numbers."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Resnick|Resnick (2012)]], pp. 15{{en dash}}16.&lt;/ref&gt;

While manuscripts of the ''Liber quatuor distinctionum'' and the ''Liber particularis'' exist, the ''Liber physiognomiae'' was the only book from the ''Liber introductorius'' trilogy to be professionally printed, with a first print of the book being released in 1477.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thorndike|Thorndike (1965)]], p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=turner/&gt; Between the date of its official printing and 1660, the work was reprinted eighteen times in many languages; this popularity of the text led Rudolf Hirsch (a book scholar) in 1950 to call the book one of the Middle Ages' "best sellers".&lt;ref name=turner&gt;[[#Turner|Turner (1911)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hirsch|Hirsch (1950)]], p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of reprints and its wide circulation is attributed in large part to the advent of the [[printing press]] in 1440.&lt;ref name=contents /&gt; Among the many reprints, there is little evidence of textual changes, which is unique for manuscripts published and then transmitted in the fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hellinga|Hellinga (1998)]], p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Liber physiognomiae'' was often bundled with other, topically-similar texts. For instance, some copies of Scot's book were combined with a work by [[Pseudepigrapha|pseudo-]][[Albertus Magnus]] entitled ''De secretis mulierum'' (''Concerning the Secrets of Women''), which, according to the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', suggests the opinion of the time was that Scot "dealt with forbidden subjects, or at least subjects better left to medical science."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stephen|Stephen (1897)]], p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Extracts from the ''Liber physiognomiae'' also appear in many early printed versions of Johannes de Ketham's medical treatise ''[[Fasciculus Medicinae]]'' (although this is not the case for all early copies).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Porter|Porter (2005)]], p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 1515 a compendium titled ''Phisionomia Aristotellis, cum commanto Micaelis Scoti'' was published, which featured the ''Liber physiognomiae'' of Scot, alongside physiognomical works by Aristotle and [[Bartolomeo della Rocca]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Porter|Porter (2005)]], p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

According to Porter, Scot's ''Liber physiognomiae'' was influential for three main reasons: First, Scot developed a number of physiognomical [[aphorism]]s.&lt;ref name=point1&gt;[[#Porter|Porter (2005)]], pp. 69{{en dash}}70.&lt;/ref&gt; Given the popularity of the ''Liber physiognomiae'', Scot's new formulations and ideas, according to Porter, "introduce[d] some fundamental changes into the structure and nature of the physiognomical aphorism."&lt;ref name=point2/&gt; (Effectively, what Scot did was add new meanings to various physical features, making the physiognomical signs discussed in the ''Liber physiognomiae'' more complex and, as Porter writes, "[[wiktionary:polyvalent|polyvalent]].")&lt;ref name=point1/&gt; Second, Scot developed a "stronger conceptual link between physiognomy, issues of hereditary, embryology, and generation, which he articulated through astrological ideas of conception."&lt;ref name=point2/&gt; Porter argues that this was done because the book was written by Scot to help Frederick II pick a suitable wife (and thus, by extension, produce a suitable heir).&lt;ref name=point2&gt;[[#Porter|Porter (2005)]], p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Third and finally, Scot's ''Liber physiognomiae'' seems to be the first physiognomical work that takes smell into account. According to Porter, this "totalization" of physiognomy{{em dash}}that is, connecting it to a variety of subjects like reproduction and sense perception{{em dash}}was the most dramatic change that occurred in the way that physiognomy was practiced "as it developed in the period between [[classical Athens]] and late fifteenth-century Europe".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Porter|Porter (2005)]], pp. 70{{en dash}}71.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Low-power broadcasting''' refers to a [[radio station|broadcast station]] operating at a low [[electrical power]] to a smaller service area than "full power" stations within the same region, but often distinguished from "micropower broadcasting" (more commonly "[[microbroadcasting]]") and [[broadcast translator]]s. '''LPAM''', '''LPFM''' and '''LPTV''' are in various levels of use across the world, varying widely based on the [[law]]s and their [[enforcement]].

==Canada==
Radio communications in Canada are regulated by the Radio Communications and Broadcasting Regulatory Branch, a branch of [[Industry Canada]], in conjunction with the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC). Interested parties must apply for both a certificate from Industry Canada and a license from CRTC in order to operate a radio station. Industry Canada manages the technicalities of spectrum space and technological requirements whereas content regulation is conducted more so by CRTC.

LPFM is broken up into two classes in Canada, Low (50 watts) and Very Low (10 watts). The transmitters therefore range from 1 to 50 watts, as opposed to 1 to 100 watts in the U.S. {{as of|2000}}, 500 licenses (very low and low-power FM) have been issued. These transmitters are generally only allowed in remote areas.

Stations in the low-power class are subject to the same CRTC licensing requirements, and will generally follow the same [[call signs in Canada|call sign]] format, as full-power stations. Stations in the very low-power class formerly had to have CRTC licenses as well, although a series of CRTC regulation changes in the early 2000s exempted most such stations from licensing; a station in this class will usually not have a conventional call sign, but will instead be identified in a naming format consisting of a four-digit number preceded by the letters CH for a television station or VF for a radio station.

The regulation of spectrum space is strict in Canada, as well having restrictions on second and third adjacent channels, along with other protections for AM and FM commercial radio. In addition, because there have been a few cases that found that FM frequencies have caused interference to the aeronautical navigation and communications (NAV/COM) spectrum (though evidence is not very concrete presently), [[pirate broadcasting|pirate radio]] regulation has remained very strict as well. However, the two regulating bodies do have certain exemptions. For example, low-power announcement transmitters that meet the requirement of Broadcasting Equipment Technical Standards 1, Limited Duration Special Events Distribution Undertakings, Temporary Resource Development Distribution Undertakings, and Public Emergency Radio Undertakings are a few instances, which according to certain criteria, may be exempt from certificate/license requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author = Industry Canada. Radiocommunications and Broadcasting Regulatory Branch, Spectrum and Telecommunications Management.|date = 2000|title = Frequently asked questions on low power FM broadcasting (RIC-40) |location = Ottawa, Canada|publisher =  Spectrum Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, there is no formal transmission power below which a television transmitter is broadcasting at low power. Industry Canada, in most cases, considers a television transmitter to be low-power if the noise-limited bounding contours are less than 20&amp;nbsp;km from the antenna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/vwapj/bpr10-i1.pdf/$FILE/bpr10-i1.pdf|title = Part 10: Application and Procedures and Rules for Digital Television (DTV) Undertakings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
In [[New Zealand]] residents are allowed to broadcast licence free-of-charge at a maximum of 1 watt [[EIRP]] in the FM guardbands from 87.6 to 88.3 and from 106.7 to 107.7&amp;nbsp;MHz under a General User Radio License (GURL), which is issued by Radio [[Spectrum management|Spectrum Management]], managed by the [[Ministry of Economic Development (New Zealand)|Ministry of Economic Development]]. Prior to June 2010, the lower band was located between 88.1 and 88.8 and a maximum of 500&amp;nbsp;mW EIRP allowed. Broadcasters on these frequencies are required to cease operations if they interfere with other, licensed broadcasters and have no protection from interference from other licensed or unlicensed broadcasters. Contact details must also be broadcast every hour.&lt;ref name=NZRSM/&gt;

Further restrictions are in place for the protection of aeronautical services.  Use of the following frequencies is not permitted within certain boundaries approaching Auckland and Wellington airports:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rsm.govt.nz/about-rsm/pdf-and-documents-library/spectrum-policy/official-information-notices-gazette/gurl-notices/low-power-fm-broadcasting/radiocommunications-regulations-general-user-radio-licence-for-low-power-fm-broadcasting-notice-2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 107.5 to 107.7 FM and 107.0 to 107.3, respectively.

There exists a 25&amp;nbsp;km [[broadcast translator]] rule: one licensee may operate two transmitters anywhere (close together), but a third transmitter must be at least 25&amp;nbsp;km away from at least one of the first two transmitters.&lt;ref name=NZRSM&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.rsm.govt.nz/cms/licensees/types-of-licence/general-user-licences/low-power-fm-broadcasting|title = Radiocommunications Regulations (General User Licence for Low Power FM Broadcasting) Notice 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are efforts on self-regulation of the broadcasters themselves. The NZRSM Radio Inspectors do, however, regularly monitor and make random unannounced visits to broadcasters, and will impose fines for violations of the regulations. New broadcasters are also subject to an initial compulsory inspection.

==United Kingdom==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
Temporary low-power stations are allowed at times via a [[Restricted Service Licence]]. Since 2001, long-term LPFM licences have been available in remote areas of the country. These are currently used for many establishments, including [[military base]]s, universities and hospitals with fixed boundaries.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==United States==

===FM radio===
Low Power FM (LPFM) is a [[non-commercial educational]] broadcast service. LPFM licenses may be issued to non-commercial educational entities, and public safety and transportation organizations. Individuals and holders of other types of broadcast licenses are not eligible to hold an LPFM license.

====LPFM classes====
* Class L1 (LP100) is to 100 [[watt]]s [[effective radiated power]] (ERP). ({{CodeFedReg|47|73|811}})
* Class L2 (L10) is at least 1 and up to 10 watts ERP. ({{CodeFedReg|47|73|811}})

In addition, Class D educational licenses exist for stations of 10 watts [[transmitter power output]] (TPO) or less, regardless of ERP. These stations are all grandfathered operations, as no new licenses of this type have been issued since 1978, except in Alaska. They are not considered to be LPFM stations, although they operate noncommercially and have similar coverage areas to Class L2 stations.

====Legislation====

=====Origins of LPFM=====
In January 2000, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] established Low Power FM (LPFM) as a new designated class of radio station. These stations were allowed to operate at 1–10 or 50–100 watts of power, compared to the minimum requirement for commercial stations at 100 watts. ({{CodeFedReg|47|73|211}}). Originally, it was supported by activists and groups and figures associated with [[Progressivism in the United States|American progressivism]]; music artists (such as [[Bonnie Raitt]]); religious leaders/churches (such as the [[United Church of Christ]]); and educators (for example, [[American Library Association]], the [[Communication Workers of America]] [[trade union|labor union]], the [[National League of Cities]].

The original purpose of LPFM was to serve as an alternative to "[[radio homogenization]]", as described in the ''J&amp;MC Quarterly Journal'', as "... Necessary to offset the growing consolidation of station ownership in the wake of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which removed caps on radio ownership, as well as the decline of locally produced radio programming."&lt;ref name="Class D to LPFM"&gt;{{cite journal|author1 = Alan G. Stavisky|author2 = Robert K. Avery|author3 =  Helena Vanhala|title = From Class D to LPFM: The High-Powered Politics of Low-Power Radio|journal =  Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|volume = 78|date = 2001|pages = 340–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main opposition to LPFMs came from the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] (NAB), which opposed the act on grounds to "maintain spectrum integrity" for commercial broadcasting, according to NAB President Edward O. Fritts.&lt;ref name="Class D to LPFM"/&gt;

=====Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act of 2000=====&lt;!-- linked from "National Association of Broadcasters" --&gt;
Pressure from the National Association of Broadcasters urged [[United States Congress|Congress]] to slip the Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act of 2000 into a general spending bill that circulated through Congress. President [[Bill Clinton]] signed the bill in December 2000, albeit reluctantly{{Weasel inline|date=November 2018}}. The actual bill that went through Congress [http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/?&amp;dbname=cp106&amp;sid=cp106nfZjS&amp;refer=&amp;r_n=hr567.106&amp;item=&amp;sel=TOC_12219&amp; ] was meant to tighten standards for LPFM stations, in an effort to make it harder for stations to be approved in order to protect full-power FM stations had these provisions:
# The FCC has the ability and jurisdiction to license LPFM stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = 1999|title = H.R. 3439 [106th]: Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act of 2000|access-date = February 12, 2008|url = http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h106-3439&amp;tab=summary}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Third adjacent channel interference protections require LPFM stations to be separated by at least 0.6&amp;nbsp;MHz from all other stations with the intent of preventing signal interference.
# Applicants who have engaged in the unlicensed operation of any station cannot receive LPFM licenses.
# The FCC agreed to commission studies on the interference effects and economic impact of LPFM on full-power stations (the findings, later published in the ''[[MITRE Corporation]] Report'', suggest that third adjacent channel interference protections may not be necessary).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Radio Magazine|date = March 1, 2004|title = FCC Reports LPFM Interference Findings to Congress|access-date = March 3, 2008|url = http://www.mediaaccess.org/programs/lpfm/RADIOmagazine.pdf|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409100247/http://www.mediaaccess.org/programs/lpfm/RADIOmagazine.pdf|archivedate = April 9, 2008|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This act basically shifted policy making from the FCC to Congress, which was considered an insult against the FCC. (Stavisky, Alan G., Robert K. Avery, and Helena Vanhala. "From Class D to LPFM: The High-Powered Politics of Low-Power Radio." Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly 78 (2001): 340–54.)

=====Local Community Radio Act of 2005=====
The Local Community Radio Act of 2005 was introduced by Senators [[John McCain]], [[Maria Cantwell]] and [[Patrick Leahy]]. After the FCC complied with the provisions of the Radio Broadcasting Act of 2000 by commissioning [http://www.recnet.net/mitre/2.pdf the MITRE Report] to test if there was significant interference from LPFM stations on the full-power stations, the study showed that the interference of LPFM is minimal and would not have a significant effect on other stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.current.org/tech/tech0314lpfm.html Current.org|title = Mitre study on LPFM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110525090155/http://www.current.org/tech/tech0314lpfm.html|archivedate = 2011-05-25|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sen. Leahy, "This bill will open up the airwaves to truly local broadcasting while protecting full-power broadcasters from unreasonable interference and preserving important services such as reading services for the blind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressOffice.PressReleases&amp;ContentRecord_id=8904246a-cd92-489c-81b1-48d8eddc4298&amp;Region_id=&amp;Issue_id=|title = United States Senator John McCain :: Press Office :&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Local Community Radio Act of 2007=====
Sponsored in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] by Congressmen [[Mike Doyle (Pennsylvania politician)|Mike Doyle]] and [[Lee Terry]] and in the [[United States Senate]] by Senators Maria Cantwell and John McCain, the Local Community Radio Act of 2007 failed to be voted on. The House bill, H.R. 2802, was referred to the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet on June 21, 2007.&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"&gt;{{cite web|date = 2007|title = H.R. 2802: Local Community Radio Act of 2007|access-date = February 12, 2008|url = http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-2802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the bill was not passed in FY 2007, the bill was removed from the docket as ''Never Passed''.

=====Local Community Radio Act of 2009=====
This bill was an update of the Local Community Radio Act of 2007. It would have required the FCC to alter current rules in order to get rid of the minimum distance separation between low-power FM stations and third-adjacent channel stations.&lt;ref name="ww-111hr1147"&gt;{{cite web|date = 2009|title = H.R. 1147, The Local Community Radio Act of 2009|access-date =  May 23, 2009|url = http://www.washingtonwatch.com/bills/show/111_HR_1147.html#toc2|publisher = Washington Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, there was a minimum distance requirement; however the FCC found that LPFM stations did not cause any interference on third-adjacent channel stations, thus eliminating the need for such a requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = RADIO magazine - The Radio Technology Leader|date = 2004|title = FCC Reports LPFM Interference Findings to Congress|access-date = May 24, 2009|url = http://www.mediaaccess.org/programs/lpfm/RADIOmagazine.pdf|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081012040159/http://www.mediaaccess.org/programs/lpfm/RADIOmagazine.pdf|archivedate = October 12, 2008|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Local Community Radio Act of 2009 also would have required that the FCC keep the rules that offer interference protection to third-adjacent channels that offer a [[radio reading service]] (the reading of newspapers, books or magazines for those who are blind or hearing impaired).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website = KPBS Radio Reading Service|title = About|access-date = May 23, 2009|url = http://kpbsreadingservice.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This protection will ensure that such channels are not subject to possible interference by LPFM stations.&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"/&gt;

The final part of the bill required that when giving out licenses to FM stations, the FCC must make sure that these licenses are also available to LPFM stations and that licensing decisions are made with regard to local community needs.&lt;ref name="ww-111hr1147"/&gt; The bill had unanimous bipartisan support from FCC leadership. It was passed by the House and referred to the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ4TC9Aqjfc|title=FCC: Unanimous, bipartisan support for LPFM|date=September 18, 2009|author=[[United States Congress]]|publisher=[[Free Press (organization)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Local Community Radio Act of 2010=====
The Local Community Radio Act of 2010 (based upon the legislation originally introduced in 2005) was signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]] on January 4, 2011 as {{USPL|111|371}}, after passage in the House on December 17, 2010, and the U.S. Senate on December 18, 2010. In a statement after the bill became law, Federal Communications Commission chairman [[Julius Genachowski]] said, "Low power FM stations are small, but they make a giant contribution to local community programming. This important law eliminates the unnecessary restrictions that kept these local stations off the air in cities and towns across the country." The Act states that the Federal Communications Commission, when licensing new FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations, should ensure that licenses are available to FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations; such decisions are made based on the needs of the local community; and FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations remain equal in status and secondary to existing and modified full-service FM stations.

In general, the FCC was to modify its rules to eliminate third-adjacent minimum distance separation requirements between low-power FM stations; and full-service FM stations, FM translator stations, and FM booster stations.

====Arguments for LPFM====
*[[Free Press (organization)|Free Press]], a non-partisan advocacy organization pushing for media reform, specifically in promoting "diversity and independent media ownership, strong public media, and universal access to communications,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper = Free Press|date = 2008|title = Local Radio Now|access-date =  February 12, 2008|url = http://www.freepress.net/lpfm/}}&lt;/ref&gt; voiced its support of LPFM for a variety of reasons:
** It strengthens community identity.
** It creates an outlet for amateur musicians to get their music heard.
** It creates diversity on the air because women and racial minorities are represented.
** It creates an opportunity for young people, especially college students, who are interested in radio to learn about the business.
** It provides farmers with up to date agricultural information.
*[[Prometheus Radio Project]], a non-profit organization that "builds, supports, and advocates for community radio stations which empower participatory community voices and movements for social change,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website = Prometheus Radio Project|date = 2009|title = About Prometheus Radio Project|access-date = February 10, 2011|url = http://www.prometheusradio.org/about_us}}&lt;/ref&gt; also supported LPFM, citing these reasons:
** The media should not limit democratic participation but should provide a way for communities and movements to express themselves
** Public airwaves shouldn't be concentrated in private/corporate hands
** Low Power FM gives a voice to communities
** Low Power FM needs to be protected from big broadcasters

A ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = B. Stelter|date = January 11, 2011|title = Low-Power FM Radio to Gain Space on the Dial|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/arts/25radio.html?_r=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on a LPFM station called KOCZ highlights a number of key arguments for LPFM:
* "In Louisiana, a large African-American community appreciate how LPFM plays a genre of music called [[zydeco]], a potent blend of [[Cajun music|Cajun]], [[rhythm and blues]] and, among a younger generation, [[hip-hop]], often features accordion and washboard.“
* LPFM influences commercial radio to offer listeners a wider range of music. “Commercial stations had started playing more zydeco since KOCZ started broadcasting in 2002. 'They know that we make them better,' an advocate said.”
* Because LPFM is non-commercial, schools and organizations are able to promote many community service-related projects that help better the local neighborhood. "KOCZ is licensed to the Southern Development Foundation, a civil rights group that grants scholarships and runs a business incubator but has fallen on hard times. The foundation treats the station as a 24-hour form of community outreach. "
* LPFM promotes a very close community. "A woman walked into the station ... asked for an announcement to be broadcast about her lost dog... 'She was able to get her dog back the next day’”
* LPFM is crucial for small communities in times of emergencies. “A low power FM radio station can stay on the air even if the power goes out. Low power FM saved lives during Katrina.”

Former President Bill Clinton is a known advocate of LPFM saying it is "giving voice to the voiceless", including schools, community groups, churches, and ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Mike Janssen|date = January 15, 2001|title = Intervention by Congress slashes LPFM licensing 80%|newspaper = Current|access-date = February 11, 2008|url = http://www.current.org/tech/tech0101lpfm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown Paper Tickets CEO Steve Butcher supports LPFM, stating in a letter to the FCC, "We hear from event producers frequently who can't afford radio ad buys on commercial stations. These local entrepreneurs can afford underwriting on smaller stations that can help build awareness about their events."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website = Brown Paper Tickets|date = September 13, 2011|title = Brown Paper Tickets CEO Makes Voice Heard for Low Power FM|access-date = September 13, 2011|url = http://www.brownpapertickets.com/pressrelease/100008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LPFM stations are considered to be affordable compared to an average FM station, whose operating costs can run up to a million dollars, and could only afforded by businesses and the very wealthy. An antenna and transmitter can cost between $2,000 and $5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website = HowStuffWorks|date = 2000|title = What is low-power FM LPFM?|access-date = February 12, 2008|url = http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/question330.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arguments against LPFM====
* Signal interference on FM station – High-power FM stations express concern that LPFM stations may cause interference with their signals if third adjacent-channel interference protections are not observed. While the Mitre Report suggests that the likelihood for interference is not as threatening as previously thought, high-power FM stations question the methodology, scope and validity of the study and its results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LPFM Report Fatally Flawed |work=Radio TechCheck |publisher=[[National Association of Broadcasters]] |date=October 20, 2003 |url=http://www.nab.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Search&amp;template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=4666 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114101516/http://www.nab.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Search&amp;template=%2FCM%2FHTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=4666 |archivedate=January 14, 2009 |access-date=October 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* FM translators – These devices allow a radio station to rebroadcast its signal to reach a greater area. FM translators could benefit religious broadcasters wishing to reach a larger audience, as well as many AM radio stations who, due to [[Ionospheric reflection|ionospheric refraction]], are required to emit weaker signals during the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Ron Whittaker|date = June 14, 2007|title = Elements of Mass Communication: AM FM Waves and Sound|access-date = February 12, 2008|url = http://www.cybercollege.com/frtv/frtv017.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; FM translators are low-power, so compete with LPFM for limited space on the airwaves.
* In some states, the local [[Department of Transportation]] operates large networks of LPFM stations that act as [[highway advisory radio]] stations – a service traditionally operated at the fringes of the [[amplitude modulation|AM]] band – restricting the number of available channels{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} (these systems can be licensed to the entire AM band, but the LPFM service provides considerably greater coverage at 100 watts than the 10-watt limit on AM – hence the considerable appeal for government agencies).
* Some investors in radio believe LPFM services prevent the development of [[digital radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Factsheets|access-date = May 29, 2008|url = http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Factsheets?lpfmfact032900.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[NPR]] is a major opponent to low-power FM. Their stance is that allowing more flexible rules for LPFM would burden other stations by forcing them to deal with interference problems and because full-power broadcasters reach a broader audience and provide a greater service, they should be favored regarding spectrum availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Everhart |first=Karen |title=Pubradio rejects higher status for low-power |newspaper=[[Current (newspaper)|Current]] |date=May 12, 2008 |url=http://www.current.org/fcc/fcc0808lpfm.shtml |access-date=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Everhart |first=Karen |author2=jonathan  |title=Once again NPR opposes expansion of low-power FM |publisher=reclaimthemedia.org |date=May 21, 2008 |url=http://www.reclaimthemedia.org/grassroots_media/once_again_npr_opposes_expansi%3D5996 |access-date=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The National Association of Broadcasters is the other major source of opposition. Its stance is that full-power FM broadcasters “enhance localism” by providing community-responsive information such as emergency information. Allowing low-power FM stations to have equal spectrum rights could be detrimental to these necessary programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=MacBride |first=Marsha J. |last2=Timmerman |first2=Jerianne |last3=Bobeck |first3=Ann W. |title=Comments of the National Association of Broadcasters |work=Before the FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION |format=PDF |publisher=National Association of Broadcasters |date=August 22, 2005 |url=http://www.nab.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Search§ion=20055&amp;template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentFileID=367 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114112638/http://www.nab.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Search%C2%A7ion=20055&amp;template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentFileID=367 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 14, 2009 |access-date=October 14, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====LPFM vs. broadcast translators====
{{See also|Broadcast relay station#Great Translator Invasion of 2003}}
Unlike the former [[list of broadcast station classes#FM|FM class D]] license, an LPFM station has no priority over broadcast translators in the allocation of available spectrum. This is problematic insofar as the regulations for [[broadcast translator]]s exempts non-commercial stations from the requirement that translators be within the coverage area of the original station that they rebroadcast. However, this provision only affects translators in the non-commercial portion of the band.  Stations in the commercial part of the spectrum must be fed over the air unless they are within the actual service area of the primary station.  Since the translator window of 2003 was only open for commercial channels, the use of directly-fed via satellite FM translators, commonly called "Satellators", was never a factor in the 2003 window.

The FCC licensing window for new translator applications in 2003 resulted in over 13,000 applications being filed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.radioworld.com/article/translator-39flood39-causes-concern/16974 |title=Translator 'Flood' Causes Concern |date=10 September 2003 |author=Naina Narayana Chernoff |accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of them coming from a few religious broadcasters.  However even though all translators on commercial frequencies must be fed by a direct, over-the-air source, regardless of who owns the translator per FCC rule 74.1231(b),&lt;ref&gt;{{CodeFedReg|47|74|1231|(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt; the actual over-the-air source (the primary station) can be satellite fed, just as commercial stations can be fed by satellite. This leads to programming from a single station (retransmitted by many others) ending up on several hundred different translators. One station cannot apply for hundreds or thousands of translators nationwide, using automated means to generate license applications for all available channels, unless all of their applications are exclusively on the non-commercial part of the broadcast band (88–91.9&amp;nbsp;MHz). ({{CodeFedReg|47|74|1231(b)}}) As with any new service that shares the FM spectrum, when translators are added to an area, they can reduce or eliminate the availability of channels both for new LPFM applicants and for relocation of any existing LPFM stations displaced by full-service broadcasters. Unlike an LPFM station, a translator is not required to (and legally not authorized to) originate any local content except as permitted by {{CodeFedReg|47|74|1231|(g)}}.  Thus there is competition for spectrum in some locations between the LPFM service and the FM translator service.

In May 2018, several groups supporting community-based low-power FM stations filed objections with the FCC, citing the [[Local Community Radio Act]], accusing it of favoring existing station coverage expansion with translator licenses - "a spectrum grab" - over new LPFM spectrum licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ashworth|first1=Susan|title=LPFM Advocates File Objections to Nearly 1,000 Applications|url=https://www.radioworld.com/news-and-business/lpfm-advocates-file-objections-to-nearly-1000-applications|website=Radio World|accessdate=28 May 2018|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jacobson|first1=Adam|title=Are Hundreds Of Pending FM Translators In Jeopardy? {{!}} Radio &amp; Television Business Report|url=https://www.rbr.com/local-comm-radio-act/|website=www.rbr.com|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prometheus May 2018 translator objections"&gt;{{cite web|title=Low-power FM radio advocates file 1,000 Objections with FCC {{!}} Prometheus Radio Project|url=https://www.prometheusradio.org/InformalObjections20180516|website=www.prometheusradio.org|accessdate=28 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AM radio===
{{see also|AM broadcasting#Microbroadcasting}}
The acronym 'LPAM' is not a legal term in the United States and is only used in this article as a (conventional) abbreviation. Unlike LPFM stations, which have legal and regulatory status, FCC rules do not define "LPAM" nor issue licenses for low-power AM transmission. LPAM is only an acronym applied to licensed low-power AM operations and to Part 15 transmissions as well.

Any "low power AM" in FCC licensing for stations in the United States is the requirement for higher-power licensed AM stations to reduce their transmit power at nighttime or post-sunset / pre-sunrise as part of their FCC broadcast authorization. There is a category ''Class&amp;nbsp;D'' for AM broadcast licenses, which limited stations to daytime-only transmission before regulations changed in the 1980s. Many, but not all, Class&amp;nbsp;D stations have been granted authority to broadcast at night with enough power to be heard within a few miles of their transmitters.

Other LPAM operations are known as [[Travelers' Information Stations]] (TIS), sometimes also called highway advisory radio (HAR). Authorized under FCC Part 90.242, these are stations licensed to local transportation departments or other governmental or quasi-governmental agencies to provide bulletins to motorists regarding traffic conditions. These are often near highways and airports, and occasionally other tourism attractions such as [[national park]]s. Some are used by chemical and nuclear facilities for emergency evacuation information systems, others by public safety entities for mobile operations.

Music is not allowed on TIS/HAR stations and they are restricted to only 3&amp;nbsp;kHz wide, "[[High fidelity|low-fidelity audio]]" as well, compared to the 10&amp;nbsp;kHz audio for standard AM broadcasters and 15&amp;nbsp;kHz audio permitted on FM stations. (Modern AM stations in the US actually restrict their audio to 5&amp;nbsp;kHz down to 2.5&amp;nbsp;kHz - roughly the same as to TIS stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radioworld.com/tech-and-gear/5-khz-audio-bandwidth-on-am|title=5 kHz Audio Bandwidth on AM|author=|date=|website=radioworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Travelers' Information Stations|TIS]] transmissions are normally authorized for 10&amp;nbsp;Watts or less, although some higher authorizations exist, primarily in locations where emergency evacuation may become necessary. The 60&amp;nbsp;Watt TIS stations on 1640 and 1680&amp;nbsp;kHz at [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]] have the highest licensed power among full-time TIS stations.&lt;ref&gt;http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/letterPdf/LetterPdfController?licId=1236825&amp;letterVersionId=52&amp;autoLetterId=0&amp;letterCode=AZ&amp;radioServiceCode=PW&amp;op=LetterPdf&amp;licSide=Y&amp;letterTo=L%20%20%20%20&amp;archive=nul&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
There are more than 2,450 licensed low-power television (LPTV) stations in the U.S., which are located in markets of all sizes, from [[New York City]] (five stations, though more exist in the market from other [[city of license|cities of license]]) down to [[Junction City, Kansas]] (two stations).{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

LPTV (-LP) and LPTV Digital (-LD) are common in the U.S., Canada and most of the [[Americas]], where most stations originate their own programming. Stations that do not originate their own programming are designated as [[broadcast relay station#translator stations|translator]]s (-TX). The Community Broadcasters Act of 1998 directed the FCC to create a classification of LPTV licenses called [[Class A television service|Class A]] (-CA). Digital low-power and Class-A television stations have an ERP limit of 3,000 watts (3&amp;nbsp;kW) for VHF, and 15 kilowatts for UHF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fcc.gov/mb/video/files/afcce.ppt|title = FCC Slideshow, slide 56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LPTV service is considered a secondary service by the FCC, which means the licensee is not guaranteed protection from interference or displacement. An LPTV station must accept harmful interference from full-service television stations and may not cause harmful interference to any full-service television station (the FCC defines interference levels deemed to be "harmful"). The problem with potential displacement was made evident during the [[Digital television transition in the United States|transition of broadcasting in the United States from analog to digital]]. All television stations operating on UHF channels 52 and above were required to move to channel 51 or below. Full-service stations were guaranteed a place to land in the new compressed band while LPTV stations operating on channels 52 and above were required to either find their own channel or lose their license.

====Class A LPTV stations====
The FCC provided a one-time filing opportunity for existing LPTV stations to become Class A stations. The designation was only available to LPTV stations that were producing two hours per week of local programming. Class A stations had to maintain a production studio within their Grade B contour, and comply with many of the requirements placed on full-service television stations. This allowed them to obtain protected channel status.

====Must-carry====
One of the key distinctions between full-service television stations and low-power stations is [[cable television]] and [[direct broadcast satellite]] (DBS) carriage. Full-service stations are guaranteed carriage in their local [[media market|television market]] through "[[must-carry]]" whereas LPTV stations are not. In 2008, there was an effort put forward by FCC chairman Kevin Martin to grant must-carry rights to Class A LPTV stations. The effort failed due to a lack of support from the other FCC Commissioners.

====Network affiliates====
Though many low-power television stations are either unaffiliated, or broadcast programming from small networks meant for their use, some LPTV stations are affiliated with major broadcast networks like [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[The CW]] or [[MyNetworkTV]]. Examples include in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] with [[NBC]] on [[WBTS-LD]], [[Youngstown, Ohio]], where a pair of LPTV stations based at [[WYFX-LD]] broadcast Fox programming, along with the [[digital subchannel]] of the co-owned [[CBS]] affiliate, [[WKBN-TV]], or in the [[Lima, Ohio]] area, whose low-power stations are affiliates of major networks, such as [[CBS]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].

====Digital transition====
On July 15, 2011, the FCC issued an order to low-power broadcasters that effectively requires all remaining television transmitters to vacate channels 52 to 69 by December 31, 2011. In that same order, the FCC effectively required all remaining analog transmitters to have shut down by March 29, 2016.

Unlike AM and FM, unlicensed use of television bands is prohibited for broadcasting. The [[amateur television]] channels do allow for some very limited non-entertainment transmissions however, with some [[repeater]]s airing [[NASA TV]] during [[Space Shuttle]] [[Space exploration|mission]]s when they are not in local use.

The low-power television industry was represented by the Community Broadcasters Association (CBA), which held its annual convention each year in October and an annual meeting each year in April at the National Association of Broadcasters Convention in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. The meeting was always held on the Monday night of the NAB convention in Ballroom B of the [[Las Vegas Hilton]] and was open to anyone interested in the low-power television industry.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} On August 13, 2009, the CBA announced in a statement that it would shut down after 20 years of representing LPTV stations. One reason given was the "restrictive regulations that kept the Class A and LPTV industry from realizing its potential". Another was the inability to reach most viewers, partly due to [[Multichannel Video Programming Distributor]]s refusing to carry these channels. In addition, Amy Brown, former CBA executive director, said, "some 40% of Class A and LPTV station operators believe they will have to shut down in the next year if they are not helped through the digital transition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/327560-Community_Broadcasters_Association_to_Shutter.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=digital+tv|title=Community Broadcasters Association to Shutter|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=2009-08-13|accessdate=2009-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, the FCC released its Notices of Proposed Rules for Digital Radio. The Commission reaffirms its commitment to provide broadcasters with the opportunity to take advantage of [[digital audio broadcasting]] (DAB) technology, proposed criteria for evaluating models and systems, such as the In Band On Channel (IBOC) system, and inquired on the needs for a mandatory DAB transmission standard.

In section 39 of the Notice, the FCC inquires as how to balance incentives for broadcasters to switch to digital systems with incumbents of new entrance opportunities, stating that they “seek analyses of the minimum power levels that would preserve service within protected service areas in an all-digital environment, and alternatively, the levels that would not result in significant disruptions to current listening patterns.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website = Prometheus Radio Project, Initials|date = February 12, 2006|title =  Review of fcc proposed rules for digital radio and impact for lpfm|url = http://prometheusradio.org/node/139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DAB system that has been identified as the best fit for LPFM is IBOC system. This is a hybrid system that uses existing frequencies and can operate carrying digital information along with analog broadcast signal on the sidebands. However, the digital carriers require the bandwidth to be widened, which would cause interference to stations on the first adjacent channel. If LPFM adopts IBOC, then LPFM would also need to accept a second adjacent channel restriction between two LPFM stations, as there is a potential that the sidebands of two LPFM stations would overlap causing interference. Currently, imposing a second adjacent channel restriction would impact less than 10 LPFM stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Michelle Eyre|date = September 21, 2008|title =  A Comparitive[sic] overview of digital audio broadcasting (dab) systems|url = http://home.recnet.com/dab}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marcoule Nuclear Site''' ({{lang-fr|Site nucléaire de Marcoule}}) is a nuclear facility in the [[Chusclan]] and [[Codolet]] [[Commune of France|commune]]s, near [[Bagnols-sur-Cèze]] in the [[Gard]] [[French Department|department]] of [[France]], which is in the tourist, wine and agricultural [[Côtes-du-Rhône]] region. The plant is around 25&amp;nbsp;km north west of [[Avignon]], on the banks of the [[Rhone]].

Operational since 1956, Marcoule is a gigantic site run by the atomic energy organization [[Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique]] (CEA) and [[Areva NC]] and is known as CEA VALRHO Marcoule. The first industrial and military [[plutonium]] experiments took place in Marcoule. Diversification of the site was started in the 1970s with the creation of the [[Phénix]] prototype [[fast breeder]] reactor, which was operational until 2009, and is nowadays an important site for [[decommissioning nuclear facilities]] activities. {{Asof|2016}} the Phénix reactor may be succeeded by the [[sodium-cooled fast reactor]] [[ASTRID (reactor)|ASTRID]] (Advanced Sodium Technical Reactor for Industrial Demonstration) foreseen to become operational in the 2030s.&lt;ref name=asahi-20160922&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201609220057.html |title=Ministries spar as Japan focuses on fast reactor project in France |newspaper= [[Asahi Shimbun]] |date=22 September 2016 |accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1995, the MELOX factory has been producing [[MOX]] from a mix of uranium and plutonium oxides. MOX is used to recycle plutonium from nuclear fuel; this plutonium comes from the [[COGEMA La Hague site]].

The ''ATelier Alpha et Laboratoires pour ANalyses, Transuraniens et Etudes de retraitement'' (ATALANTE) is a CEA laboratory investigating the issues of [[nuclear reprocessing]] of [[nuclear fuel]] and of [[radioactive waste]].

==Reactors==
The site housed a number of the first generation French [[UNGG reactor]]s, all of which have been shut down. Since then, it has also operated two [[heavy water reactor]]s to produce [[tritium]].  Cooling for all of the plants comes from the [[Rhône River|Rhône]] river.

A science museum for the general public, Visiatome Marcoule, devoted to energy issues is located by the Marcoule site.

While most facilities are located at the main Marcoule site, a small number of facilities at Pierrelatte (located close at the [[Tricastin Nuclear Power Plant#Tricastin Nuclear Site|Tricastin Nuclear Site]]) do also belong to the Marcoule Nuclear Site.

In 2007 over 500 million euros was spent supporting the work of the 30 laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{fr}http://www-marcoule.cea.fr/home/liblocal/docs/UCAP/PORTAIL/Plaquette%20CEA%20Marcoule%20en%20bref.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A MAPS program features several interrelated and defined capital projects, funded by a temporary sales tax (allowing projects to be paid for in cash, without incurring debt), administered by a separate dedicated city staff funded by the sales tax, and supervised by a volunteer citizens oversight committee.

In some ways, a MAPS program is similar to a [[Local option sales tax]].  However, taxes collected by a MAPS program do not go to a city's general fund, but are instead deposited into a trust dedicated to the specific projects identified in the taxes' enabling ordinance.  Additionally, MAPS programs are only indirectly controlled by a city's elected governance body; a citizens oversight committee provides direct oversight, which is also established by the enabling ordinance.

==Features of a MAPS program==
The key features of the original program were designed to provide accountability to the citizens of the community as well as provide a funding mechanism for capital projects without using a city's general revenue funds, and included:
* Several capital projects, each designed to appeal to a variety of demographic groups within the city, while at the same time having "those projects geographically close to each other to create a synergy of activity for people."&lt;ref name=Norick&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.okgazette.com/oklahoma/article-4194-former-mayor-ron-norick-discusses-how-current-maps-proposal-differs-from-first.html|title=Former Mayor Ron Norick discusses how current MAPS proposal differs from first|author=Scott Cooper|date=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* The overall program would be funded by a dedicated, multi-year sales tax with a start date and end date
* Projects would be paid for in cash, without incurring debt; with this "pay as you go" approach, construction does not start until the cost of the project has been collected; money is in an interest bearing bank account and not deposited in the city's general fund.
* The Program would be overseen by a volunteer citizens advisory committee, whose recommendations for architects, plans and construction documents, contractors, and change-orders would be forwarded to city council for approval   
* Projects would be administered by a separate and dedicated city staff, hired specifically for the term of the program, with salaries and expenses a component of program costs, paid from sales tax revenue   
* Each project would be allocated an endowment sufficient to operate and maintain the building without additional cost to the city's general fund

A common challenge of "pay as you go" programs such as MAPS is that, because the lead-up time while accumulating the needed funds can be lengthy, specific projects of the program "are often are scuttled when administrations change and new leaders want their own signature projects... Oklahoma City was able to avoid this pitfall ‹because the city› changes mayors, but not strategies."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.placemakingchicago.com/places/oklahoma-city.asp | title=Placemaking Chicago: Oklahoma City | author=Evan Severs | date=April 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Because the voters approved a multi-year temporary sales tax that was dedicated to multiple specific projects that together had significant public support, and because the infrastructure to support the program and its projects was also temporary with dedicated funding from the sales tax, a change in elected officials has not been sufficient to change the scope of the program.

A key to success is the feature of multiple projects; while each project taken individually might not have sufficient support for individual funding, when taken as a group, the package has sufficient support for funding.  Said another way, it is important to "bundle projects to enhance community buy-in."&lt;ref name=lessons&gt;

==History==
In many ways the [[early 1980s recession]] in the United States began in Oklahoma City with the collapse of the [[Penn Square Bank]].  This subsequent collapse of the state's energy business and failure of additional financial institutions, lead to a significant out-migration and excess capacity in real estate.  The resulting lack of infrastructure investment in the inner city proved to be a factor in the city's inability to attract new business.&lt;ref name=renewal&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.brownfieldrenewal.com/renewal-award-project-economic_impact-city_of_oklahoma_city___metropolitan_area_projects-1.html | title=The Renewal Rewards: Economic Impact - City of Oklahoma City - Metropolitan Area Projects | publisher=Redevelopment and Renewal Magazine |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1990s some Oklahoma City interests were concerned about what they perceived as civic decline. In 1992, after the city lost a contract to house a new maintenance facility for [[United Airlines]] to [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] because the airline considered Indianapolis to have a better [[standard of living]] and [[quality of life]], then-mayor [[Ron Norick]] and the [[Greater Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce]] proposed MAPS as a measure to improve the city's economy and attractiveness as a tourist destination.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lnbBNr5ZzwUC&amp;pg=PT234&amp;dq=%22metropolitan+area+projects+plan%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22metropolitan%20area%20projects%20plan%22&amp;f=false|title=Civic revolutionaries: igniting the passion for change in America's communities|author1=Douglas C.

City residents were initially skeptical over funding the public projects through a sales tax increase, and as late as a month before the tax [[referendum]] opposed the plan by a 20% margin.  However, the plan did pass by a slim margin in a vote in December, 1993.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;  During the five year tax period the city raised nearly $310 million in direct taxes, plus $52 million of income on the tax money it had deposited.  The tax was extended with voter approval for an additional six months to raise enough money to complete all of the projects, and construction continued until 2004.

Encouraged by the success of MAPS, city leaders proposed and adopted "MAPS for Kids", a public school improvement program.  In December 2009 the city approved a third program, "[[Metropolitan Area Projects Plan 3|MAPS 3]]", which would build $777 million in further improvements paid for by a similar sales tax increase.

==Oklahoma City MAPS initiative==
The MAPS initiatives in Oklahoma City, to date, consist of three major programs: The original MAPS program, MAPS for Kids, and MAPS 3.

===MAPS===
The original '''Metropolitan Area Projects Plan''', or '''[http://www.okc.gov/maps MAPS]''', was a $350 million [[public works]] and [[redevelopment]] project in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]] during the middle to late 1990s, funded by a temporary, five year, voter-approved [[sales tax]] increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Greater Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce|url=http://www.okcchamber.com/index.php?submenu=ChamberHistory&amp;src=gendocs&amp;ref=ChamberHistory&amp;category=About|title=Chamber History}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The various MAPS projects were believed to be capable of improving the economy and attractiveness of this ‹downtown› core and having a profound impact on proximal areas;"&lt;ref name=renewal /&gt; the common theme of the projects was downtown redevelopment.  The original MAPS program comprised nine projects that took 10 years to complete, and were chosen to appeal to a wide variety of city residents and also revitalize the city's downtown: 
*renovations to the [[Civic Center Music Hall]] including the 2,500 seat Thelma Gaylord Performing Arts Theater, the 290 seat Freedie Little Theater, the 100 seat City Space Theater, the 5,000 sf Minders Hall of Mirrors, and the 3,100 sf Joel Levine Rehearsal Hall.  
*renovations to [[Cox Convention Center|The Myriad (now the Cox Convention Center)]] including a 100,000 sf expansion of the convention space. The Cox center also includes a 15,000 seat multi-purpose arena that was home to the [[Oklahoma City Barons]] hockey team (the top farm team of the [[Edmonton Oilers]]). 
*renovations to the [[Oklahoma State Fairgrounds]] 
*construction of the [[Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark]] home of the [[Oklahoma City Dodgers]], the Triple-A affiliate of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] Major League Baseball team. The park has seating for up to 13,066 fans and currently utilizes a seating capacity of 9,000 for Dodgers games. 
*construction of the 18,203 seat Ford Center (now called the [[Chesapeake Energy Arena]]), an indoor multipurpose sports arena.  The arena was completed for several years before it became an important aspect of plans in 2006 through 2008 by local businessman [[Clay Bennett (businessman)|Clay Bennett]], who lead the purchase of the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], and later moved the basketball team to Oklahoma City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/basketball/278203_okcity20.html|publisher=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|title=Oklahoma City is positively giddy:'Looks like we might be getting y'all's team'|author=Mike Lewis|date=2006-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NBA team is now called the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]].
*construction of the "[[Bricktown (Oklahoma City)|Bricktown]] Canal" which provided a core investment to transform a former [[warehouse district]] into an entertainment district; with "recreation activities available in Bricktown are currently ‹2009› estimated to draw 2.9 million visits annually"&lt;ref name=impact&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greateroklahomacity.com/clientuploads/pdf/MAPS_Impact_Study_Executive_Summary.pdf | title=Executive Summary: Impact Analysis of Oklahoma City's MAPS and other Significant Central City Investments, Revised |author1=Larkin Warner  |author2=Eric Long  |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher=Greater Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce | date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}}
*construction of a [[riverfront]] and recreational dams on the [[North Canadian River]] (this section of the river has been renamed the Oklahoma River, its lower section is known as the [http://boathousedistrict.org Boathouse District], the headquarters for [[USACK|USA Canoe/Kayak]] and a training center for [[USRowing]])
*a new Library/learning Center, later called the [http://www.Mls.lib.ok.us/Mls/mls_library/dn.htm Ronald J. Norick Downtown Library], a four-story main library to replace a facility that had been built in 1951
*development of the [[Oklahoma Spirit Trolleys]], a [[tourist trolley|trolley-replica bus]] network

===MAPS for Kids===
The second MAPS program, called [http://www.okc.gov/ocmaps MAPS for Kids], was a $700 million initiative to improve schools in the various school districts whose boundaries coincided with the City of Oklahoma City.  Oklahoma has school districts whose boundaries have nothing to do with the boundaries of any other political subdivision.  At the time the original MAPS tax was expiring, the [[Oklahoma City Public Schools]] system was struggling with little political capital.  "They could not pass bond issues, and the school buildings were falling apart as a result."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url=http://americaninfrastructuremag.com/summer-2012-24.php | title=Oklahoma City Invests in New Urban Infrastructure | author=Mick Cornett | publisher=American Infrastructure,  Peninsula Publishing, Inc. | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714142117/http://americaninfrastructuremag.com/summer-2012-24.php | archivedate=2014-07-14 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then mayor [[Kirk Humphreys]] proposed a second MAPS program to repair more than 100 area schools.  With the addition of a $180-million bond issue and an eye on addressing childhood obesity issues, new gymnasiums were added to all of the Oklahoma City District's elementary schools. The program was approved by voters in 2001. This temporary sales tax was collected for seven years, with 70 percent disbursed to the Oklahoma City School District and 30 percent to 23 Suburban School Districts.

===MAPS 3===
{{main|Metropolitan Area Projects Plan 3}}
[http://www.okc.gov/maps3 MAPS 3] is a $777 million program, approved by voters in 2009 with 54% of the vote (the same percentage as the Original MAPS.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsok.com/maps3 | title=MAPS 3 Oklahoma City | publisher=NewsOK.com | accessdate=27 Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The one-cent sales tax initiative began in April 2010 and ends in December 2017.  After a year of public meetings organized by Mayor [[Mick Cornett]], there developed a consensus that a future MAPS program should focus on projects that improved the [[Quality of Life]] in Oklahoma City.  Hundreds of citizens suggested projects to be considered; through a series of public meetings eight projects were eventually selected to be included in the MAPS 3 proposal.
*New Downtown Convention Center
*New Downtown Public Park - 70 acres, including festival areas
*New Modern Streetcar/Transit system and an inter-modal transit hub
*New Senior Health and Wellness Centers; multiple structures in various parts of the city designed to encourage healthy lifestyles and serve as a gathering place for active seniors
*Improvements to the Oklahoma River including a whitewater training facility and various upgrades to the world-class rowing racecourse
*Improvements to the Oklahoma State Fair Grounds including replacing public event buildings
*Expansion of Trails system that interconnects the city's major parks for walking and biking 
*Expansion of neighborhood sidewalks to create a more walkable community
Recognizing that the city's economy may fluctuate during the time of the sales tax collection, and that there may be unforeseen project contingencies, the program also has a significant Infrastructure/Contingency component.

The public forum process used to identify projects to be included in the MAPS 3 program established enough public political support to overcome an effort by a newly elected city council person who attempted to derail the original MAPS 3 proposal. An initiative petition was filed that would have eliminated the Convention Center and ended the Sales tax earlier.  This council person also ran for Mayor, with MAPS being a major factor in the election. Mayor Cornett was re-elected for an unprecedented 4th term with 65.7% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://newsok.com/oklahoma-citys-mick-cornett-wins-fourth-term-as-mayor/article/3940020 | title=Oklahoma City's Mick Cornett wins fourth term as mayor | publisher=Daily Oklahoman | date=4 Mar 2014 | author=William Crum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact of MAPS in Oklahoma City===
The MAPS programs have had significant impact in Oklahoma City, both economically and from a quality of life standpoint. In the 20 years since its inception "nearly $5 billion in economic impact can be attributed to the original MAPS program. This represents a nearly 10-fold return on the city's original investment." &lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url=http://www.greateroklahomacity.com/clientuploads/pdf/economic%20forecast%202014.pdf | title=2014 Greater Oklahoma City Economic Forecast |author1=Russell Evans |author2=Eric Long | date=2014 | page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As was recently reported in a Wichita newspaper, 
"From quirky festivals and dozens of restaurants to outdoor recreation and romantic riverboat rides, a revitalized downtown Oklahoma City boasts so many attractions it is quickly becoming a favorite weekend destination for Oklahomans and Kansans alike." &lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news | url=http://www.kansas.com/2014/05/17/3461812/okc-offers-more-activities-than.html#storylink=cpy | author =Andi Atwatwer | title=OKC offers More Activities than you'd Think | date=2014-05-17 | publisher=The Wichita Eagle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is arguable that in terms of associated investment, hotels segment represent the largest impact of the original MAPS.   "In 1992-93 when the city's leaders developed the plans for the MAPS investments, there was only one significant hotel operating in downtown Oklahoma City. What is now the Sheraton had nearly 400 rooms but was in need of upgrading. By 2008, there were seven significant hotels in the Downtown CBD and Bricktown with a total of about 1,600 rooms."&lt;ref name=impact /&gt;{{rp|15}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13907">[[File:MST Technology.png|thumb|300 px|Principle of the MST Technology: 
MST is performed in thin capillaries in free solution thus providing close-to-native conditions (immobilization free in any buffer, even in complex bioliquids) and a maintenance free instrument. When performing an MST experiment, a microscopic temperature gradient is induced by an infrared laser, and TRIC as well as thermophoresis are detected. TRIC depends on the fluorophore's microenvironment, which is typically changed in binding events. Thermophoresis, the movement of the molecule in the temperature gradient, depends on three parameters that typically change upon interaction. Thus, the overall MST signal is plotted against the ligand concentration to obtain a dose-response curve, from which the binding affinity can be deduced.]]
'''Microscale thermophoresis''' ('''MST''') is a technology for the [[Biophysics|biophysical]] analysis of interactions between [[biomolecules]]. Microscale [[thermophoresis]] is based on the detection of a temperature-induced change in fluorescence of a target as a function of the concentration of a non-fluorescent ligand. The observed change in fluorescence is based on two distinct effects. On the one hand it is based on a temperature related intensity change (TRIC) of the fluorescenct probe, which can be affected by binding events. On the other hand it is based on [[thermophoresis]], the directed movement of particles in a microscopic [[temperature gradient]].  Any change of the chemical microenvironment of the fluorescent probe, as well as changes in the [[solvation shell#Hydration shells of proteins|hydration shell]] of biomolecules result in a relative change of the fluorescence detected when a temperature gradient is applied and can be used to determine [[dissociation constant|binding affinities]]. MST allows measurement of interactions directly in solution without the need of immobilization to a surface (immobilization-free technology).

== Technology ==
MST is based on the quantifiable detection of a fluorescence change in a sample when a temperature change is applied. The fluorescence of a target molecule can be extrinsic or intrinsic (aromatic [[amino acid]]s) and is altered in temperature gradients due to two distinct effects. On the one hand temperature related intensity change (TRIC), which describes the intrinsic property of [[fluorophore]]s to change their fluorescence intensity as a function of temperature. The extent of the change in fluorescence intensity is affected by the chemical environment of the fluorescent probe, which can be altered in binding events due to [[conformational change]]s or proximity of [[ligand]]s.&lt;ref name="Baaske" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Gupta|first=Amit J. |last2=Duhr |first2=Stefan |last3=Baaske |first3=Philipp | name-list-format = vanc |title=Microscale Thermophoresis (MST)|date=2018 |journal=Encyclopedia of Biophysics|pages=1–5|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-35943-9_10063-1|isbn=9783642359439}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand MST is also based on the directed movement of molecules along temperature gradients, an effect termed thermophoresis. A spatial temperature difference ΔT leads to a change in molecule concentration in the region of elevated temperature, quantified by the Soret coefficient S&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;:c&lt;sub&gt;hot&lt;/sub&gt;/c&lt;sub&gt;cold&lt;/sub&gt; = exp(-S&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; ΔT).&lt;ref name=Duhr1&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Duhr S, Braun D | title = Why molecules move along a temperature gradient | journal = Proc.

The first term in this equation c∂F/∂T describes TRIC as a change in fluorscence intensity (F) as a function of temperature (T), whereas the second term F∂c/∂T describes thermophoresis as the change in particle concentration (c) as a function of temperature. Thermophoresis depends on the interface between molecule and solvent. Under constant buffer conditions, thermophoresis probes the size, charge and solvation entropy of the molecules. The thermophoresis of a fluorescently labeled molecule A typically differs significantly from the thermophoresis of a molecule-target complex AT due to size, charge and solvation entropy differences. This difference in the molecule's thermophoresis is used to quantify the binding in titration experiments under constant buffer conditions.

The thermophoretic movement of the fluorescently labelled molecule is measured by monitoring the [[fluorescence]] distribution F inside a capillary. The microscopic temperature gradient is generated by an IR-Laser, which is focused into the capillary and is strongly absorbed by water. The temperature of the aqueous solution in the laser spot is raised by ΔT=1-10 K. Before the IR-Laser is switched on a homogeneous fluorescence distribution F&lt;sub&gt;cold&lt;/sub&gt; is observed inside the capillary. When the IR-Laser is switched on, two effects, occur on the same time-scale, contributing to the new fluorescence distribution F&lt;sub&gt;hot&lt;/sub&gt;. The thermal relaxation induces a binding-dependent drop in the fluorescence of the dye due to its local environmental-dependent response to the temperature jump (TRIC). At the same time molecules typically move from the locally heated region to the outer cold regions. The local concentration of molecules decreases in the heated region until it reaches a steady-state distribution.

While the mass [[diffusion]] D dictates the kinetics of depletion, S&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; determines the steady-state concentration ratio c&lt;sub&gt;hot&lt;/sub&gt;/c&lt;sub&gt;cold&lt;/sub&gt;=exp(-S&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; ΔT) ≈ 1-S&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; ΔT under a temperature increase ΔT. The normalized fluorescence F&lt;sub&gt;norm&lt;/sub&gt;=F&lt;sub&gt;hot&lt;/sub&gt;/F&lt;sub&gt;cold&lt;/sub&gt; measures mainly this concentration ratio, in addition to TRIC ∂F/∂T. In the linear approximation we find: F&lt;sub&gt;norm&lt;/sub&gt;=1+(∂F/∂T-S&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;)ΔT. Due to the linearity of the fluorescence intensity and the thermophoretic depletion, the normalized fluorescence from the unbound molecule F&lt;sub&gt;norm&lt;/sub&gt;(A) and the bound complex F&lt;sub&gt;norm&lt;/sub&gt;(AT) superpose linearly. By denoting x the fraction of molecules bound to targets, the changing fluorescence signal during the titration of target T is given by: F&lt;sub&gt;norm&lt;/sub&gt;=(1-x) F&lt;sub&gt;norm&lt;/sub&gt;(A)+x F&lt;sub&gt;norm&lt;/sub&gt;(AT).&lt;ref name="Baaske"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baaske P, Wienken CJ, Reineck P, Duhr S, Braun D | title = Optical thermophoresis for quantifying the buffer dependence of aptamer binding | journal = Angew.

Quantitative binding parameters are obtained by using a serial dilution of the binding substrate. By plotting F&lt;sub&gt;norm&lt;/sub&gt; against the logarithm of the different concentrations of the dilution series, a sigmoidal binding curve is obtained.

'''Nazareth College''' is a [[coeducational]], [[Private colleges|private]], religiously independent college in [[Pittsford, New York|Pittsford]], a suburb of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]]. Founded by the [[Sisters of St. Joseph]] in 1924, the college offers more than 60 undergraduate majors &lt;ref&gt;[https://www2.naz.edu/academics]&lt;/ref&gt;and 24 graduate programs. Alumni and locals commonly refer to the school as "Naz" for short. 

==History==
[[File:Nazareth College.JPG|thumbnail|right|Golisano Academic Center, Nazareth College]]

===Founding===
At the request of [[Thomas Francis Hickey (bishop)|Bishop Thomas Francis Hickey]] of Rochester, five [http://www.ssjrochester.org/ Sisters of St. Joseph] founded Nazareth College of Rochester in 1924. The first class was composed of 25 young women who began their studies in a large mansion on Lake Avenue in [[Rochester, New York]]. The original mansion that housed the college was known as "the Glass House." At that time, the college offered Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees, each with a [[liberal arts]] core. In response to increasing enrollment, the college moved to a larger facility in 1928 at [https://www.flickr.com/photos/nazareth_college/12190480324/ 402 Augustine Street].

===Move to East Avenue===
In January 1942, the college moved to its present campus on East Avenue in the suburb of [[Pittsford (village), New York|Pittsford]]. In the 1950s, the college responded to the need for graduate study by adding majors and by the 1970s offered programs in teacher education and social work.  Study abroad programs and intercollegiate sports were also added in the 1970s. During this time, the college became co-educational and independent of the Roman Catholic Church. 

Nazareth competed in men’s intercollegiate athletics for the first time in 1977. The official nickname of the sports teams became the Golden Flyers — golden for the Nazareth color, and flyers for the bird-like symbol that is part of the old Nazareth logo. Today, Nazareth supports 25 varsity teams. The most recent sport, added in 2018, is women's ice hockey.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www2.naz.edu/news/2017/June/331/chris-baudo-named-women-s-hockey-coach-at-nazareth-college].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion===
In the early 2000s, the college purchased adjacent land from the Sisters of St. Joseph, including the former Motherhouse and Infirmary. This acquisition doubled the campus size to its current 150 acres.  As a result of support from college benefactors (including Tom Golisano, the founder of Paychex), the Motherhouse became the Golisano Academic Center. The Infirmary became George Hall, a residence hall that also houses a coffeehouse and late night study area. The decade of the 2000s also saw the construction of additional student housing, including Portka Hall, Clock Tower Commons, and the Lyons and Breen apartment buildings.

In 2003, 30 years after becoming religiously independent, Nazareth College was removed from ''The Official Catholic Directory,'' having been declared no longer a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] institution by [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester|Rochester Bishop]] Matthew H. Clark. It was the second time since [[Pope John Paul II]] issued [[Ex Corde Ecclesiae]], the apostolic constitution on Catholic universities in 1990, a bishop declared a historically Catholic college or university to be not Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.catholicculture.org/library/view.cfm?recnum=4674
|title = New York Archdiocese Says Marist College 'No Longer Catholic'|accessdate = 2007-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Nazareth added Peckham Hall, the Integrated Center for Math and Science. Named after lead donors Nancy and Larry Peckham, the $30 million facility supports majors in math and science fields, as well as education programs. It also provides important learning facilities for students in health and human services programs.

*The Golisano Academic Center was built in 1927. It is the oldest and largest building on campus, once serving as the "motherhouse" for the Sisters of St. Joseph. It was purchased from the Sisters of St. Joseph in 2003 and is now used for academic and administrative purposes. Features of the Center include the ornate Linehan Chapel and Cafe Sorelle. 
*Nazareth's Integrated Center for Math and Science, Peckham Hall, opened in fall 2012, and led to Nazareth ranking among the top 20 science labs nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=best-science-lab-facilities&lt;/ref&gt; The center features multi-purpose research spaces (including state-of-the-art labs and classrooms), a range of support services, and a variety of student centers. It is also the first project on campus to achieve a Leadership in Energy &amp; Environmental Design (LEED)-certified green building rating.
*The Nazareth College Arts Center, which houses the departments of Theatre Arts, Music, and Art, has entertained almost three million people at performances since it opened in 1967. The Arts Center was renovated in September 2009 to become a dance and performance venue. The 2010 Princeton Review names Nazareth College the 6th Best College Theater in the country (up from #9 in 2009.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naz.edu/news/popular-discovery-channel-host-jeff-lieberman-to-lecture-at-nazareth-college-october-23|title=Nazareth College|publisher=|accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fall foliage, Nazareth College.JPG|thumb|Fall foliage, Nazareth College]]
*On-campus clinics for speech and hearing, reading and physical therapy allow students to gain practical experience, and are also open to the Rochester community.
*Although Nazareth College has been independent since the 1970s, the legacy of the Sisters of St. Joseph is honored by the Meditation Garden located next to Golisano, which includes a labyrinth, benches, and a statue of Mary which once stood on the grounds of Smyth Hall.
*A network of underground tunnels connects many buildings on campus, allowing students and employees to avoid the cold and snow of upstate New York winters.

===Hickey Center for Interfaith Studies and Dialogue===
The Center for Interfaith Studies and Dialogue (CISD) at Nazareth College was founded in 2005. In 2011, International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT) of Herndon, Virginia offered Nazareth a major gift, provided it was matched by local donors. Brian and Jean Hickey matched this gift, resulting in renaming the center the Hickey Center for Interfaith Studies and Dialogue at Nazareth College. The endowed chair of the Center was left to the IIIT, and they selected Dr. Muhammad Shafiq, who was imam of the Islamic Center of Rochester, the Rochester metropolitan area's largest mosque. The Center is part of Nazareth’s College of Arts and Sciences and located in the Golisano Academic Center. Dr. Muhammad Shafiq is the executive director of the Hickey Center for Interfaith Studies and Dialogue and a professor of Islamic and [[religious studies]] at the college.

===Casa Italiana===
The Casa Italiana (Italian House)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www2.naz.edu/casa-italiana]&lt;/ref&gt; is a center of [[Italian language]], [[Italian literature|literature]], and [[Italian culture|culture]]. It serves as a cultural center for the college and the [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] metropolitan area. Built with the help of the [[Italian-American]] community of greater Rochester in 1978, the Casa promotes traditional and contemporary Italian culture, explores the Italian-American experience, and seeks to enhance exchanges between the [[United States]] and [[Italy]].  The reading room at the Casa provides the college and the community with language and culture resources, and the classroom provides an environment in which students and community members can study the Italian language.

'''Oculolinctus''', also known as '''"worming"''' or '''eyeball-licking fetishism''', refers to the  [[Paraphilia|paraphilic]] practice of licking [[eyeball]]s for erotic gratification. In mid-2013, English-language newspapers reported that this fetish had allegedly become popular in [[Japan]], where it was referred to as {{nihongo|''Gankyū name purei''|眼球舐めプレイ|4 = "eyeball licking play"}}.&lt;ref&gt;2013-06-07, [http://news.merumo.ne.jp/article/genre/1249531 小学生に眼球なめ変態プレイが大流行], 読めるモ&lt;/ref&gt; However, other media have reported that the existence of this practice is a [[hoax]] based on a story in a Japanese [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://no1.fccj.ne.jp/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=954 LICK THIS! Mark Schreiber ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57597395-1/blind-spot-how-a-hoax-about-eye-licking-went-global/|title=Blind spot: How a hoax about eye licking went global|publisher=[[CNET]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many of the originally reporting articles were corrected&lt;ref name="Moye" /&gt; or [[Retraction|retracted]]&lt;ref name="Heritage" /&gt; as being possibly a hoax.

==Characteristics==
In 2013, oculolinctus reportedly became popular among teenagers in Japan, causing a significant rise in eye infections. According to a retracted article by ''[[The Guardian]]'', eyeball-licking was "seen as a new [[Baseball metaphors for sex|second-base]]; the thing you graduate to when kissing gets boring", possibly due to it being featured in a music video by the Japanese band [[Born (band)|Born]].&lt;ref name="Heritage"&gt;{{cite news|last=Heritage|first=Stuart|title=Eyeball-licking: the fetish that is making Japanese teenagers sick|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2013/jun/14/eyeball-licking-fetish-japanese-teenagers-sick|accessdate=14 June 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further reports, e.g. in an article by the Huffington Post later corrected as a possible hoax, showed an increase in Japanese schoolchildren wearing eyepatches due to eye infections arising from the act, with one school finding one third of 12-year-old students admitting to engaging in oculolinctus.&lt;ref name="Moye"&gt;David Moye, 2013-06-12, "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/12/eyeball-licking-pinkeye_n_3423985.html Eyeball Licking Causing Pinkeye In Japan]", ''The Huffington Post'' (later corrected as a hoax)&lt;/ref&gt; There are also accounts of this practice in the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]].&lt;ref name=Waxman&gt;{{cite web|last=Waxman|first=Olivia B.|title=Eyeball-Licking Fetish Isn’t Just Disgusting, It Spreads Pink Eye|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/06/14/eyeball-licking-fetish-isnt-just-disgusting-it-spreads-pink-eye-too/|publisher=[[TIME]]|accessdate=14 June 2013|date=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks of licking an eyeball==
The practice is associated with significant health risks, as [[tongue]]s are coated with a film of microorganisms, which may cause infections in the eye, such as [[conjunctivitis]], [[herpes]] and [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]]. It also carries the risk of [[corneal abrasion]]&lt;ref name="Heritage" /&gt; and corneal ulcers.&lt;ref name=Narcisse&gt;{{cite web|last=Narcisse|first=Quenton|title=Eyeball Licking: Japan's Craziest New Fetish|url=http://mashable.com/2013/06/14/eyeball-licking/|publisher=[[Mashable]]|accessdate=14 June 2013|date=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oral bacteria on the tongue can potentially enter corneal scratches caused by licking the eye, which then lead to infection.&lt;ref&gt;Ashik Siddique, 2013-06-12, "[http://www.medicaldaily.com/articles/16481/20130612/eyeball-licking-oculolinctus-japanese-teenagers-spreads-pink-eye.htm Eyeball Licking ‘Oculolinctus’ Fetish Spreads Pink Eye Among Japanese Preteens]", ''Medical Daily''&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, there is also the risk of [[blindness]] from the resulting infections, as well as [[styes]]. The difference in bacteria between the eye and mouth is why it is no longer recommended to lick [[contact lens]]es before they are inserted into one's eye.&lt;ref name="Waxman" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19050">A '''radioactive tracer''', or '''radioactive label''', is a [[chemical compound]] in which one or more atoms have been replaced by a [[radionuclide]] so by virtue of its [[radioactive decay]] it can be used to explore the mechanism of chemical reactions by tracing the path that the radioisotope follows from reactants to products. '''Radiolabeling''' is thus the radioactive form of [[isotopic labeling]].

Radioisotopes of [[hydrogen]], [[carbon]], [[phosphorus]], [[sulfur]], and [[iodine]] have been used extensively to trace the path of [[biochemistry|biochemical reactions]]. A radioactive tracer can also be used to track the distribution of a substance within a natural system such as a [[cell (biology)|cell]] or [[tissue (biology)|tissue]],&lt;ref name=rennie-99&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rennie M |title=An introduction to the use of tracers in nutrition and metabolism |journal=Proc Nutr Soc |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=935–44 |year=1999 |pmid=10817161 |doi=10.1017/S002966519900124X}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a [[flow tracer]] to track [[fluid dynamics|fluid flow]]. Radioactive tracers are also used to determine the location of fractures created by [[hydraulic fracturing]] in natural gas production.&lt;ref name="Reis_iodine"&gt;Reis, John C. (1976). ''Environmental Control in Petroleum Engineering.'' Gulf Professional Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Radioactive tracers form the basis of a variety of imaging systems, such as, [[PET scan]]s, [[SPECT scan]]s and [[Technetium-99m|technetium scan]]s. [[Radiocarbon dating]] uses the naturally occurring [[carbon-14]] isotope as an [[isotopic label]].

==Methodology==
[[Isotope]]s of a [[chemical element]] differ only in the mass number. For example, the isotopes of [[hydrogen]] can be written as [[hydrogen|&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H]], [[deuterium|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H]] and [[tritium|&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]], with the mass number at top left. When the [[atomic nucleus]] of an isotope is unstable, compounds containing this isotope are [[radioactive]]. [[Tritium]] is an example of a radioactive isotope.

The principle behind the use of radioactive tracers is that an [[atom]] in a [[chemical compound]] is replaced by another atom, of the same chemical element. The substituting atom, however, is a radioactive isotope. This process is often called radioactive labeling. The power of the technique is due to the fact that radioactive decay is much more energetic than chemical reactions. Therefore, the radioactive isotope can be present in low concentration and its presence detected by sensitive [[radiation detector]]s such as [[Geiger counter]]s and [[scintillation counter]]s. [[George de Hevesy]] won the 1943 [[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]] "for his work on the use of isotopes as tracers in the study of chemical processes".

There are two main ways in which radioactive tracers are used
# When a labeled chemical compound undergoes chemical reactions one or more of the products will contain the radioactive label. Analysis of what happens to the radioactive isotope provides detailed information on the mechanism of the chemical reaction.
# A radioactive compound is introduced into a living organism and the radio-isotope provides a means to construct an image showing the way in which that compound and its reaction products are distributed around the organism.

== Production ==
The commonly used radioisotopes have short [[half life|half lives]] and so do not occur in nature. They are produced by [[nuclear reaction]]s. One of the most important processes is absorption of a  neutron by an atomic nucleus, in which the mass number of the element concerned increases by 1 for each neutron absorbed. For example,
:[[carbon|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]] + [[neutron|n]] → [[carbon|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C]]
In this case the atomic mass increases, but the element is unchanged. In other cases the product nucleus is unstable and decays, typically emitting protons, electrons ([[beta particle]]) or [[alpha particle]]s. When a nucleus loses a proton the [[atomic number]] decreases by 1. For example,
:[[sulfur|&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;S]] + [[neutron|n]] → [[phosphorus|&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;P]] + [[proton|p]]
Neutron irradiation is performed in a [[nuclear reactor]]. The other main method used to synthesize radioisotopes is proton bombardment. The proton are accelerated to high energy either in a [[cyclotron]] or a [[linear accelerator]].&lt;ref name=fowler/&gt;

==Tracer Isotopes==

===Hydrogen===
[[Tritium]] is produced by neutron irradiation of [[lithium|&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Li]]
:[[lithium|&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Li]] + [[neutron|n]] → [[Helium|&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He]] + [[tritium|&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]]
Tritium has a [[half-life]] 4,500±8 days (approximately 12.32 years),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=L. L. Lucas |author2=M. P. Unterweger |year=2000 |title=Comprehensive Review and Critical Evaluation of the Half-Life of Tritium |url=http://nvl.nist.gov/pub/nistpubs/jres/105/4/j54luc2.pdf |journal=[[Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |volume=105 |issue=4 |pages=541 |doi=10.6028/jres.105.043 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017042101/http://nvl.nist.gov/pub/nistpubs/jres/105/4/j54luc2.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it decays by [[beta decay]]. The [[electron]]s produced have an average energy of 5.7 keV. Because the emitted electrons have relatively low energy, the detection efficiency by scintillation counting is rather low. However, hydrogen atoms are present in all organic compounds, so tritium is frequently used as a tracer in [[biochemistry|biochemical]] studies.

===Carbon===
[[Carbon-11|&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]] decays by [[positron emission]] with a half-life of ca. 20 min.  [[carbon-11|&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]] is one of the isotopes often used in [[positron emission tomography]].&lt;ref name=fowler&gt;Fowler J. S. and Wolf A. P. (1982) The synthesis of carbon-11, fluorine-18 and nitrogen-13 labeled radiotracers for biomedical applications. Nucl. Sci. Ser. Natl Acad. Sci. Natl Res. Council Monogr. 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carbon-14|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C]] decays by beta-decay, with a half-life of 5730 y. It is continuously produced in the upper atmosphere of the earth so it occurs at a trace level in the environment. However, it is not practical to use naturally-occurring [[carbon-14|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C]] for tracer studies. Instead it is made by neutron irradiation of the isotope [[carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]] which occurs naturally in carbon at about the 1.1% level. [[carbon-14|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C]] has been used extensively to trace the progress of organic molecules through metabolic pathways.

=== Nitrogen ===
[[nitrogen|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;N]] decays by [[positron emission]] with a half-life of 9.97 min. It is produced by the nuclear reaction
:[[proton|&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H]] + [[oxygen|&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O]] → [[nitrogen|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;N]] + [[alpha particle|&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He]]
[[nitrogen|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;N]] is used in [[positron emission tomography]] (PET scan).

=== Oxygen ===
[[oxygen|&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;O]] decays by positron emission with a half-life of 122 sec. It is used in positron emission tomography

=== Fluorine ===
[[fluorine|&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]] decays by emission with a half-life of 109 min. It is made by proton bombardment of [[oxygen|&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]] in a cyclotron or [[linear particle accelerator]]. It is an important isotope in the [[Radiopharmacology|radiopharmaceutical]] industry. It is used to make labeled [[fluorodeoxyglucose]] (FDG) for application in PET scans.&lt;ref name=fowler/&gt;

===Phosphorus===
[[phosphorus-32|&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;P]] is made by neutron bombardment of [[sulfur|&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;S]]
:[[sulfur|&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;S]] + [[neutron|n]] → [[phosphorus-32|&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;P]] + [[proton|p]]
It decays by beta decay with a half-life of 14.29 days. It is commonly used to study protein phosphorylation by [[kinases]] in biochemistry.

[[phosphorus-33|&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;P]] is made in relatively low yield by neutron bombardment of [[phosphorus|&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P]]. It is also a beta-emitter, with a half-life of 25.4 days. Though more expensive than [[phosphorus-32|&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;P]], the emitted electrons are less energetic, permitting better resolution in, for example, DNA sequencing.

Both isotopes are useful for labeling [[nucleotide]]s and other species that contain a [[phosphate]] group.

===Sulfur===
[[Sulfur-35|&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;S]] is made by neutron bombardment of [[chlorine|&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;Cl]]  
:[[chlorine-35|&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;Cl]] + [[neutron|n]] → [[Sulfur-35|&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;S]] + [[proton|p]]
It decays by beta-decay with a half-life of 87.51 days. It is used to label the sulfur-containing [[amino-acid]]s [[methionine]] and [[cysteine]]. When a sulfur atom replaces an oxygen atom in a [[phosphate]] group on a [[nucleotide]] a [[thiophosphate]] is produced, so &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;S can also be used to trace a phosphate group.

===Technetium===
{{main|technetium-99m}}
[[Technetium-99m|&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc]] is a very versatile radioisotope, and is the most commonly used radioisotope tracer in medicine. It is easy to produce in a [[technetium-99m generator]], by decay of [[molybdenum|&lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Mo]]. 
:[[molybdenum|&lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Mo]] → [[Technetium-99m|&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc]] + {{Subatomic particle|Electron-}} + {{Subatomic particle|Electron antineutrino}}
The molybdenum isotope has a half-life of approximately 66 hours (2.75 days), so the generator has a useful life of about two weeks. Most commercial [[Technetium-99m|&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc]] generators use [[column chromatography]], in which [[molybdenum|&lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Mo]] in the form of molybdate, MoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; is adsorbed onto acid alumina (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). When the [[molybdenum|&lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Mo]] decays it forms [[pertechnetate]] TcO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, which because of its single charge is less tightly bound to the alumina. Pulling normal saline solution through the column of immobilized [[molybdenum|&lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Mo]] elutes the soluble [[Technetium-99m|&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc]], resulting in a saline solution containing the [[Technetium-99m|&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc]] as the dissolved sodium salt of the pertechnetate. The pertechnetate is treated with a [[reducing agent]] such as [[tin|Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] and a [[ligand]]. Different ligands form [[coordination complex]]es which give the technetium enhanced affinity for particular sites in the human body.

[[Technetium-99m|&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc]] decays by gamma emission, with a half-life: 6.01 hours. The short half-life ensures that the body-concentration of the radioisotope falls effectively to zero in a few days.

===Iodine===
{{main|Isotopes of iodine}}
[[Isotopes of iodine|&lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;I]] is produced by proton irradiation of &lt;sup&gt;124&lt;/sup&gt;[[xenon|Xe]]. The [[caesium]] isotope produced is unstable and decays to [[Isotopes of iodine|&lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;I]]. The isotope is usually supplied as the iodide and hypoiodate in dilute sodium hydroxide solution, at high isotopic purity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mds.nordion.com/documents/products/I-123_Solu_Can.pdf I-123 fact sheet]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;I has also been produced at Oak Ridge National Laboratories by proton bombardment of [[tellurium|&lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;Te]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =  Hupf | first1 =H.B.  | last2 = Eldridge  | first2 =J.S.  | last3 = Beaver  | first3 =J.E.  | year = 1968 | title = Production of Iodine-123 for medical applications  | journal = The International Journal of Applied Radiation and Isotopes | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 345–346  | doi = 10.1016/0020-708X(68)90178-6 | pmid=5650883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isotopes of iodine|&lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;I]] decays by [[electron capture]] with a half-life of 13.22 hours. The emitted 159 [[keV]] [[gamma radiation|gamma ray]] is used in [[single photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT). A 127 keV gamma ray is also emitted.

[[Isotopes of iodine|&lt;sup&gt;125&lt;/sup&gt;I]] is frequently used in [[radioimmunoassay]]s because of its relatively long half-life (59 days) and ability to be detected with high sensitivity by gamma counters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilby|first1=ED|author2=Jeffcoate, Edwards  |title=125-Iodine tracers for steroid radioimmunoassay.|journal=Journal of Endocrinology|date=July 1973|pages=xx|volume=58|issue=1|pmid=4578967 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isotopes of iodine|&lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I]] is present in the environment as a result of the testing of [[nuclear weapons]] in the atmosphere. It was also produced in the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] and [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] disasters. &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I decays with a [[half-life]] of 15.7 million years, with low-energy [[beta particle|beta]] and [[gamma ray|gamma]] emissions. It is not used as a tracer, though its presence in living organisms, including human beings, can be characterized by measurement of the gamma rays.

=== Other isotopes ===
{{main|radiopharmacology}}
Many other isotopes have been used in specialized radiopharmacological studies. The most widely used is [[gallium|&lt;sup&gt;67&lt;/sup&gt;Ga]] for [[gallium scan]]s. [[gallium|&lt;sup&gt;67&lt;/sup&gt;Ga]] is used because, like [[technetium-99m|&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc]], it is a gamma-ray emitter and various ligands can be attached to the Ga&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ion, forming a [[coordination complex]] which may have selective affinity for particular sites in the human body.

An extensive list of radioactive tracers used in hydraulic fracturing can be found below.

==Application==
{{See also|Nuclear medicine|List of PET radiotracers|Radionuclides associated with hydraulic fracturing}}
In [[metabolism]] research, [[Tritium]] and [[carbon-14|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C]]-labeled glucose are commonly used in [[glucose clamp technique|glucose clamps]] to measure rates of [[glucose uptake]], [[fatty acid synthesis]], and other metabolic processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kraegen EW, Jenkins AB, Storlien LH, Chisholm DJ |title=Tracer studies of in vivo insulin action and glucose metabolism in individual peripheral tissues.|journal=Horm Metab Res Suppl. |year=1990|volume=24|pages=41–8|pmid=2272625 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While radioactive tracers are sometimes still used in human studies, [[stable isotope]] tracers such as [[carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]] are more commonly used in current human clamp studies. Radioactive tracers are also used to study [[lipoprotein]] metabolism in humans and experimental animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1097/00075197-200409000-00007|last=Magkos|first1=F|author2=Sidossis |title=Measuring very low density lipoprotein-triglyceride kinetics in man in vivo: how different the various methods really are.|journal=Curr Opin Clin Nutr Metab Care|date=September 2004|volume=7|issue=5|pages=547–55|pmid=15295275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medicine]], tracers are applied in a number of tests, such as [[technetium-99|&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc]] in [[autoradiography]] and [[nuclear medicine]], including [[SPECT|single photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT), [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) and [[Gamma camera|scintigraphy]]. The [[urea breath test]] for [[helicobacter pylori]] commonly used a dose of [[carbon-14|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C]] labeled urea to detect h. pylori infection. If the labeled urea was metabolized by h. pylori in the stomach, the patient's breath would contain labeled carbon dioxide. In recent years, the use of substances enriched in the non-radioactive isotope [[carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]] has become the preferred method, avoiding patient exposure to radioactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peeters|first1=M|title=Urea breath test: a diagnostic tool in the management of Helicobacter pylori-related gastrointestinal diseases|journal=Acta Gastroenterol Belg|year=1998|volume=61|issue=3|pages=332–5|pmid=9795467 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[hydraulic fracturing]], radioactive tracer isotopes are injected with hydraulic fracturing fluid to determine the injection profile and location of created fractures.&lt;ref name="Reis_iodine" /&gt;  Tracers with different half-lives are used for each stage of hydraulic fracturing. In the United States amounts per injection of radionuclide are listed in the US [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) guidelines.&lt;ref name="NRC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1556/v14/#_1_26 |title=Consolidated Guidance About Materials Licenses: Program-Specific Guidance About Well Logging, Tracer, and Field Flood Study Licenses (NUREG-1556, Volume 14) |vauthors=Whitten JE, Courtemanche SR, Jones AR, Penrod RE, Fogl DB,((Division of Industrial and Medical Nuclear Safety, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards)) |quote=labeled Frac Sand...Sc-46, Br-82, Ag-110m, Sb-124, Ir-192 |date=June 2000 |publisher=US Nuclear Regulatory Commission|accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the NRC, some of the most commonly used tracers include [[antimony-124]], [[bromine-82]], [[iodine-125]], [[iodine-131]], [[iridium-192]], and [[scandium-46]].&lt;ref name="NRC"/&gt; A 2003 publication by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] confirms the frequent use of most of the tracers above, and says that [[manganese-56]], [[sodium-24]], [[technetium-99m]], [[silver-110m]], [[argon-41]], and [[xenon-133]] are also used extensively because they are easily identified and measured.&lt;ref name="IAEA 2003"&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1171_web.pdf|title=Radiation Protection and the Management of Radioactive Waste in the Oil and Gas Industry |date=2003 |publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency |accessdate=20 May 2012|format = PDF | pages = 39–40 |quote=Beta emitters, including &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C, may be used when it is feasible to use sampling techniques to detect the presence of the radiotracer, or when changes in activity concentration can be used as indicators of the properties of interest in the system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5799">'''Rich Donovan''' is a global expert in business development issues surrounding disability and accessibility. He is best known for creating financial instruments that track the intersection of corporate profitability with corporate commitment to disability hiring and best practices. His Return On Disability Index is reported on Bloomberg and has been used as the basis of an Exchange Traded Note (ETN) by [[Barclay’s Bank]] on the [[NYSE Arca]] Stock Exchange.

==Accessibility and Finance Work==

===Development of the Return on Disability Index===

Rich Donovan is a founder of several research and advisory companies that have foregrounded the business case for companies and governments to act on the disability market. In 2008, he founded what is now called '''The Return on Disability Group''' to build metric and models that allow for analysis of corporate activity which help assess how well businesses engage customers and employees with disabilities. The organization’s "Return on Disability Reports" and other models helps companies understand their performance across disability factors that are linked directly to profitability. As well they produce the Return on Disability Indices for the U.S. and Canada markets. These financial tools "recognize public companies that are outperforming in the disability market."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rod-group.com/rod-report/companies |title=The RoD Report |publisher=The Return on Disability Group |access-date=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The RoD US 100 and the RoD Canada 50, are published daily by Bloomberg LP. The indices track the shares of the 100 firms that deal best with disabled people. The Economist notes that in the five years to 2012 the US index had outperformed the broader stock market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21562229 |date=September 8, 2012|title=Disability and business: The new green |publisher=[[The Economist]] |access-date=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LIME===
In 2006, Rich Donovan founded Lime Connect.   Lime Connect is an organization whose goal is to find employment for people with disabilities.   The idea with Lime Connect is: “to connect with the brightest people with disabilities from all disciplines. Results have been stellar, with the Lime Connect Fellowship Program placing 20 young stars in 2011 alone, six of whom were hired by Google.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.essentialaccessibility.com/newsletter/march/feature.html |title=Disability: From Redheaded Stepchild to Golden Girl |publisher=Essential Accessibility |first1=Rich|last1=Donovan|access-date=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other companies Lime has partnered with include PepsiCo, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, IBM, and TD Bank.&lt;ref name =Carleton&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21562229 |date=2014 |title=Rich Donovan |work=Accessibility Summit: Speaker List |publisher=[[Carleton University]] |access-date=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fundamental Concepts===

As one of the early progenitors of the business case for accessibility, Donovan has focused on the following:

* Strategic road maps for companies to do accessibility well. What works within their strategic frameworks.
* What accessibility practices drive value at specific companies that, in turn, drive investor returns
* the notion of Shared value so that the next ten years of growth will come from non-traditional markets such as people with disabilities

==Personal Life and Professional Development==

===Education===

Donovan received his BBA in Finance from the Schulich School of Business at York University (1993 - 1997) and his MBA from Columbia Business School (2000 – 2002). He worked successfully as a trader for Merrill Lynch. Donovan is an avid sailor and father of a son, Maverick, along with his wife, Jenn. He has cerebral palsy.&lt;ref name=Carleton/&gt;

A radio detecting [[Antenna (radio)|aerial]] is placed on top of a cliff,&lt;ref name="BoltonSlee"/&gt; which detects electromagnetic waves coming directly from the source and waves reflected off the water surface.&lt;ref name="CSIRO"/&gt; The two sets of waves are then combined to form an interference pattern such as that produced by two separate aerials.&lt;ref name="CSIRO"/&gt; The reflected wavefront travels an additional distance {{math|2h sin(i)}} before reaching the detector where h and i are the height of the cliff and the inclination of the incoming wavefront respectively.&lt;ref name="GossMcGee"&gt;{{Cite book

The interference patterns for a sea interferometer commence sharply as soon as the source rises above the horizon, instead of fading in gradually as for a normal interferometer.&lt;ref name="BoltonSlee"/&gt; Since it consists of just one detector, there is no need for connecting cables or for [[preamplifier]]s.&lt;ref name="GossMcGee"/&gt; A sea interferometer also has double the sensitivity of a pair of detectors set up to the same separation.&lt;ref name="GossMcGee"/&gt; Sea interferometry greatly increases the [[angular resolution|resolving power]] of the instrument.&lt;ref name="BoltonSlee"/&gt;

The quality of data obtained by a sea interferometer is affected by a number of factors. Waves on the water surface and variable refraction adversely affect the signal, and the curvature of the [[Earth]]'s surface must be taken into account.&lt;ref name="BoltonSlee"/&gt; These difficulties can be overcome by observing for extended periods, and calibrating the instrument on sources of known position.&lt;ref name="BoltonSlee"/&gt;

The '''Stone Age Institute''' is an independent research center dedicated to the [[archeology|archaeological]] study of human origins and technological development. The institute conducts research and education in human origins studies, publishes books and articles, and mentors prospective scientists The institute is housed in a {{convert|11400|sqft|m2|sing=on}} facility located on a {{convert|30|acre|m2|adj=on}} rural site outside [[Bloomington, Indiana]]. 

The Stone Age Institute is an autonomous research facility, but it has strong ties with [[Indiana University]], especially CRAFT (the [[Center for Research into the Anthropological Foundations of Technology]]) and the Human Evolutionary Studies Program.

The facility includes a research library on early prehistory and an extensive artifact collection donated by the late [[J. Desmond Clark]], professor of Anthropology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

[[Image:Sapta Chakra, 1899.jpg|220px|thumb|right|The subtle body in Indian mysticism, from a [[Yoga]] manuscript in Braj Bhasa language, 1899, now in the British Library.]]

A '''subtle body''' is one of a series of psycho-spiritual constituents of living beings, according to various [[esotericism|esoteric]], [[occultism|occult]], and [[mysticism|mystical]] teachings. According to such beliefs each subtle body corresponds to a subtle [[plane of existence]], in a [[hierarchy]] or [[great chain of being]] that culminates in the physical form.

According to ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', one of the most sacred texts of [[Hinduism]], the subtle body is composed of mind, intelligence and ego, which controls the gross physical body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vedabase.com/en/bg/13/6-7|title=Bg 13.6-7|first=|last=pnd|date=15 July 2011|website=www.vedabase.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503130040/http://www.vedabase.com/en/bg/13/6-7|archivedate=3 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known in other different spiritual traditions: "the most sacred body" (''wujud al-aqdas'') and "true and genuine body" (''jism asli haqiqi'') in [[Sufism]], "the diamond body" in [[Taoism]] and [[Vajrayana]], "the light body" or "[[rainbow body]]" in [[Tibetan Buddhism]], "the body of bliss" in [[Kriya Yoga]], and "the immortal body" (''soma athanaton'') in [[Hermeticism]].&lt;ref&gt;White.&lt;/ref&gt; The various attributes of the subtle body are frequently described in terms of often obscure [[symbol]]ism: Tantra features references to the sun and moon as well as various Indian rivers and deities, while Taoist alchemy speaks of [[dantian|cauldrons]] and cinnabar fields.

==History of the term==
The expression "subtile body" appears suddenly in English literature in about 1650, appears erratically until it ceased to be used by about 1840.  At that time, the more common term "subtle body" comes into use.  The latter expression gradually gains in currency through the nineteenth century, and begins a sharp increase in usage from about 1940 until the present time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Google N-Gram|title=N-Gram Analysis, "subtile body, subtle body"|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=subtile+body%2Csubtle+body&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1500&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2Csubtile%20body%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bsubtile%20body%3B%2Cc0%3B%3Bsubtile%20Body%3B%2Cc0%3B.t4%3B%2Csubtle%20body%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bsubtle%20body%3B%2Cc0%3B%3Bsubtle%20Body%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BSubtle%20Body%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BSubtle%20body%3B%2Cc0|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research is needed to clarify the actual authors who used the phrase, and what they meant by it.  But the word may have a connection with the Sanskrit Sūkṣma (subtle, unmanifest, dormant) Śarīra (body) which is described in the Vedas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Three Bodies Doctrine (Vedanta)#Suksma sarira - subtle body]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Acupuncture chart 300px.jpg|thumb|200px|''Drawing showing the circulation of Qi energy, Ming Dynasty'']]

The [[Yoga|Yogic]], [[tantra|Tantric]] and other systems of [[Hinduism]], [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhism]], as well as Chinese [[Taoist alchemy]] contain theories of subtle physiology having a number of focal points ([[chakra]]s, [[acupuncture points]]) connected by a series of channels ([[Nadi (yoga)|nadis]], [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]]) that convey subtle breath ([[prana]], vayu, [[Qi|ch'i, ki]], [[lung (Tibetan Buddhism)|lung]]).

These invisible channels and points are understood to determine the characteristics of the visible physical form. By understanding and mastering the subtlest levels of reality one gains mastery over the physical realm. Through practice of various breathing and visualization exercises one is able to manipulate and direct the flow of vital force, to achieve supernormal powers ''(''[[Sanskrit]]: ''[[siddhi]]s)'' and attain higher [[Altered state of consciousness|states of consciousness]], [[immortality]], or [[Moksha|liberation]].

=== Hinduism ===
[[File:SahajaSubtleSystem.svg|thumb|An illustration of a subtle body system of seven chakras commonly adopted by contemporary yoga.]]
Early mentions of subtle body ([[Sanskrit]]: ''sūkṣma śarīra'') concepts appear in the Upanishads, particularly the earliest known theory appears in the [[Taittiriya Upanishad]]'s (circa 4th or 5th centuries BCE) theory of five bodies or selves.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The Taittiriya differentiates between five increasingly subtle body/selves: &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
* The ''anna-maya'' ("food body", physical body/self), 
* The ''prana-maya'' (body made of vital breath or [[prana]]), 
* The ''mano-maya'' (body made of mind), 
* The ''[[Vijñāna|vijñana]]-maya'' (body made of consciousness)
* The ''ananda-maya'' (bliss body). 
The Taittiriya also contains passages which suggests a theory of a subtle internal anatomy which includes the concept of a central channel ([[Nadi (yoga)|nadi]]).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In later Vedic texts called [[Samhita|samhitas]] and [[Brahmana|brahmanas]] one also finds a theory of five "winds" or "breaths" (''vayus, [[Prana|pranas]]''):&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Prāṇa'', associated with inhalation
* ''Apāna'', associated with exhalation
* ''Uḍāna'', associated with distribution of breath within the body
* ''Samāna'', associated with digestion
* ''Vyāna'', associated with excretion of waste
A millennium later, these concepts were adapted and refined by various spiritual traditions. The similar concept of the {{IAST|Liṅga Śarīra}} is seen as the vehicle of consciousness in later [[Samkhya]], [[Vedanta]], and [[Yoga]], and is propelled by past-life tendencies, or ''[[bhava]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Gerald. ''Classical Samkhya'' p.242&lt;/ref&gt; Linga can be translated as "characteristic mark" or "impermanence" and the term [[Sarira (Vedanta)]] as "form" or "mold".&lt;ref&gt;Purucker, Gottfried. ''The Occult Glossary''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Karana'' or "instrument" is a synonymous term. In the Classical Samkhya system of [[Isvarakrsna]] (ca. 4th century CE), the ''Lińga'' is the characteristic mark of the transmigrating entity. It consists of twenty-five [[tattva]]s from eternal consciousness down to the five organs of sense, five of activity (''buddindriya'' or ''jñānendriya'', and  ''karmendriya'' respectively) and the five subtle elements that are the objects of sense (''tanmatras'') The ''Samkhyakarika'' says:{{quote|The subtle body (''linga''), previously arisen, unconfined, constant, inclusive of the great one (''mahat'') etc , through the subtle elements, not having enjoyment, transmigrates, (because of) being endowed with ''bhavas'' ("conditions" or "dispositions").

As a picture (does) not (exist) without a support, or as a shadow (does) not (exist) without a post and so forth; so too the instrument (''linga'' or ''karana'') does not exist without that which is specific (i.e. a subtle body).&lt;ref&gt;Samkhyakarika, transl. Gerald Larson, vv 60-81, ''Classical Samkhya'' p.268.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The classical [[Vedanta]] tradition developed the theory of the five bodies into the theory of the [[Kosha|koshas]] "sheaths" or "coverings" which surround and obscure the self ([[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]]). In classical Vedanta these are seen as obstacles to realization and traditions like Shankara's [[Advaita Vedanta]] had little interest in working with the subtle body.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 34, 37&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tantra]] traditions meanwhile ([[Shaivism|Shaiva]] [[Kaula (Hinduism)|Kaula]] and Buddhist yoga), the subtle body was seen in a more positive light, offering potential for yogic practices which could lead to liberation.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Tantric traditions contain the most complex theories of the subtle body, with sophisticated descriptions of energy [[Nadi (yoga)|nadis]] (literally "stream or river", channels through which ''vayu'' and ''prana'' flows) and [[chakra]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (lit. "circles") which are points of focus where nadis meet.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; The main channels, shared by both Hindu and Buddhist systems, are the central (in Hindu systems: ''susumna''; in Buddhist: ''avadhuti''), left and right (in Hindu systems: ''ida'' and ''pingala''; Buddhist: ''lalana'' and ''rasana'').&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Further subsidiary channels are said to radiate outwards from the chakras, where the main channels meet. There are various chakra systems depending on the [[tantra]]; the ''Netra tantra'' describes six chakras, the ''Kaulajñana-nirnay''a describes eight, and the ''Kubjikamata Tantra'' describes seven (the most widely known set of chakras).&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, Indian subtle body terminology was adopted by the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] of [[Madame Blavatsky]].

The modern Indian spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] stated that the subtle body "is the vehicle of desires and vital forces,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). ''Discourses''. '''2'''. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. p. 145. {{ISBN|978-1880619094}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He held that the subtle body is one of three bodies with which the soul must cease to identify in order to realize God.&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). ''Discourses''. '''2'''. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. p. 144. {{ISBN|978-1880619094}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
[[Image:Chakras and energy channels 2 (3749594497).jpg|thumb|200px|A Tibetan illustration of the subtle body showing the central channel and two side channels as well as five chakras.]]

In [[Buddhist Tantra]], the subtle body is termed the ‘innate body’
(''nija-deha'') or the ‘uncommon means body’ (''asadhdrana-upayadeha'').&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Wayman, Alex; Yoga of the Guhyasamajatantra: The arcane lore of forty verses : a Buddhist Tantra commentary, 1977, page 65.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also called ''sūkṣma śarīra'', rendered in Tibetan as ''traway-lu'' (transliterated ''phra ba’i lus''). &lt;ref&gt;Lama Willa B Miller. Reviews: Investigating the Subtle Body. {{cite web |url=https://www.lionsroar.com/reviews-investigating-the-subtle-body/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-03-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319151239/https://www.lionsroar.com/reviews-investigating-the-subtle-body/ |archivedate=19 March 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The subtle body consists of thousands of subtle energy channels ([[nadis]]), which are conduits for energies or "winds" ([[Lung (Tibetan Buddhism)|lung]] or [[prana]]) and converge at [[chakras]].&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;  
According to Dagsay Tulku Rinpoche, there are three mains channels (''nadis''), central, left and right; "their beginning point is located between a person's eyebrows. From there, they run upward to the crown chakra. The passage then parallels the spine, running through all seven chakras - the centers of subtle energy - and ending about two inches below the belly button."&lt;ref&gt;Dagsay Tulku Rinpoche, The Practice of Tibetan Meditation: Exercises, Visualizations, and Mantras for Health and Well-being. Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co, 2002, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; 

Buddhist tantras generally describe four or five chakras in the shape of a lotus with varying petals. For example, the [[Hevajra Tantra]] (8th century) states:&lt;blockquote&gt;In the Center [i.e. cakra] of Creation [at the sexual organ] a sixty-four petal lotus. In the Center of Essential Nature [at the heart] an eight petal lotus. In the Center of Enjoyment [at the throat] a sixteen petal lotus. In the Center of Great Bliss [at the top of the head] a thirty-two petal lotus.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In contrast, the historically later [[Kalachakra|Kalachakra tantra]] describes six chakras.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

In [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, liberation is achieved through subtle body processes during [[Deity yoga|Completion Stage]] practices such as the [[Six Yogas of Naropa|Six yogas of Naropa]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Western esotericism ==
=== Theosophy ===

[[H. P. Blavatsky]]'s [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] teaching represented the convergence of 19th century Western occultism, Eastern philosophy, religion, science, and mysticism. ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'', and ''[[The Key to Theosophy]]'' combined the [[vedanta|Vedantic]] concept of five [[kosha]]s with Western esoteric traditions (particularly [[Neoplatonism]]).  She refers to three subtle bodies:

* ''[[Linga sarira|Linga Sharira]]'' - the Double or [[Astral body]]
* ''Mayavi-rupa'' - the "Illusion-body"
* ''Causal Body'' - the vehicle of the higher Mind

The ''Linga Sharira'' is the invisible double of the human body, elsewhere referred to as the [[etheric body]], [[doppelgänger]] or bioplasmic body and serves as a model or matrix of the physical body, which conforms to the shape, appearance and condition of his "double". The linga sarira can be separated or projected a limited distance from the body. When separated from the body it can be wounded by sharp objects. When it returns to the physical frame, the wound will be reflected in the physical counterpart, a phenomenon called "repercussion". At death, it is discarded together with the physical body and eventually disintegrates or decomposes.

The mayavi-rupa is dual in its functions, being:
"the vehicle both of thought and of the animal passions and desires, drawing at one and the same time from the lowest terrestrial manas (mind) and Kama, the element of desire".&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Blavatsky, "Astral Bodies, or Doppelgangers". ''Collected Writings'' X, pp. 217–220&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher part of this body, containing the spiritual elements gathered during life, merges after death entirely into the causal body; while the lower part, containing the animal elements, forms the Kama-rupa, the source of "spooks" or [[ghost|apparitions]] of the dead.

[[File:First Principles of Thesophy 066.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Vehicles of the Soul according to the Theosophist [[Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa]].]]

[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] was further systematized in the writings of [[C.W. Leadbeater]] and [[Annie Besant]]. For example, they divided Blavatsky's dual mayavi-rupa into two different bodies: the emotional and the mental bodies.  They also redefined some terms. The Linga Sarira (sometimes called astral body by Blavatsky) was denominated by [[Annie Besant]]&lt;ref&gt;Annie Besant, ''The Ancient Wisdom'', 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Etheric body|Etheric double]]. [[C.W. Leadbeater]], regarding the emotional body as the seat of the [[Kama (Theosophy)|kamic]] principle of Blavatsky's constitution, denominated it [[astral body]]. Therefore, the subtle bodies in a human being are:

* [[Etheric body]] (vehicle of [[prana]])
* [[Astral body|Emotional or astral body]] (vehicle of desires and emotions)
* [[Mental body]] (vehicle of the concrete or lower mind)
* [[Causal body]] (vehicle of the abstract or higher mind)

Each "body" has its own [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] and set of [[chakra]]s, and corresponds to a particular [[Plane (cosmology)|plane of existence]].

[[Image:Cosmicman.jpg|thumb|116px|left|The Subtle body and the cosmic man, Nepal 1600s]]

=== Post-theosophists ===

The later Theosophical arrangement was taken up by [[Alice Bailey]], and from there found its way (with variations) into the New Age worldview. It is also associated with the human [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] observed through [[Kirlian photography]] and [[Walter John Kilner|Kilner screens]]. The [[Anthroposophy|anthroposophical view of the human being]] found in [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s [[Anthroposophical]] teachings usually referred to only the Etheric and Astral Bodies. However, Steiner also used a threefold classification of body, soul, and spirit as well as a sevenfold and a ninefold description.

[[Max Heindel]] divided the subtle body into: [[Etheric body|Vital Body]] made of Ether, our instrument for specializing the vital energy of the sun, seen by clairvoyant vision to extend about an inch and a half outside the body; the [[Desire body]], which is our emotional nature and pervades both the vital and dense bodies, seen by clairvoyant vision to extend about 16&amp;nbsp;inches outside our visible body, related to the [[Astral plane|Desire World]]; and the [[Mental body]], which functions like a mirror, reflects the outer world and enables the Ego to transmit its commands as thought, word and action. The human being is seen as a threefold Spirit, possessing a Mind by which he governs the threefold Body that he transmutes into a threefold [[Soul]]. The Human Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the desire body to be transmuted into the Emotional Soul; the Life Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the vital body to be transmuted into the Intellectual Soul; the Divine Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the dense body to be transmuted into the Conscious Soul.

[[Samael Aun Weor]] wrote extensively on the subtle vehicles, organizing them in accordance with the [[kabbalah|kabbalistic]] [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]. The common person only contains the lunar vehicles of emotion ([[astral body]]), thought ([[mental body]]), and will ([[causal body]]), concentrations of the collective animalistic intelligence, the evolution of the Essence through the mineral, plant and animal kingdoms. Becoming human means to have a soul, a Solar Astral Body, Solar Mental Body and Solar Causal Body. These bodies are constructed through a form of [[Tantra]] called [[White tantrism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Samael Aun Weor |authorlink=Samael Aun Weor |title=Types of Spiritual Schools |url=http://www.gnosticteachings.org/content/view/417/64/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531203308/http://www.gnosticteachings.org/content/view/417/64/ |archivedate=31 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }} Note: The "[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927012401/http://www.gnosticteachings.org/component/option,com_glossary/func,view/Itemid,10077/catid,101/term,Ego/ ego]" referred to by Samael Aun Weor is not used in the same context as it is used other esoteric schools.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Brennan]]'s account of the subtle bodies in her books ''Hands of Light'' and ''Light Emerging'' refers to the subtle bodies as "layers" in the "Human Energy Field" or aura. Causality proceeds downwards: each of the layers has its own characteristics and can have its own expression of disease, requiring individual healing. As with the Adyar arrangement, each body or aura also has its own complement of chakras, which interrelate to those in the other layers.

Michal Levin describes the relationship between the energy bodies and the chakras in her book Meditation, Path to the Deepest Self.

=== Fourth Way ===

An interesting variant on the concept of subtle bodies is found in both Alchemical Taoism and the "[[Fourth Way]]" teachings of [[Gurdjieff]] and [[Ouspensky]], where it is said that one can create a subtle body, and hence achieve post-mortem immortality, through spiritual or yogic exercises. The "soul" then is not something one is born with, but something that one has to develop through esoteric practice.

According to (Rosenthal, 1997) "In Gurdjieff's cosmology our nature is tripartite and is composed of the physical (planetary), emotional (astral) and mental (spiritual) bodies; in each person one of these three bodies ultimately achieves dominance." The Fourth way as taught by [[Gurdjieff]] and [[Ouspensky]] is a philosophy of developing the divine body which is gained when one has complete understanding and self perfection. The ultimate task of the fourth way teachings is to harmoniously develop the four bodies into a single way.&lt;ref&gt;Bernice Glatzer Rosenthal ''The occult in Russian and Soviet culture'' 1997, p. 361&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aleister Crowley and the Body of Light ==

The work of the ''Body of Light'' was part of English author and [[occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]]'s system of [[Magick (Aleister Crowley)|magick]], saying in his ''[[Magick (Book 4)]]'' that it must be developed by rigid discipline, including rituals and the "assumption of god-forms", as well as by practice and experience.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aleister Crowley]] ''[[Magick (Book 4)]]'', [[Samuel Weiser]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From Crowley's ''[[Magick Without Tears]]'' (Ch. 81):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''One passes through the veil of the exterior world (which, as in Yoga, but in another sense, becomes "unreal" by comparison as one passes beyond) one creates a subtle body (instrument is a better term) called the body of Light; this one develops and controls; it gains new powers as one progresses, usually by means of what is called "initiation:" finally, one carries on almost one's whole life in this Body of Light, and achieves in its own way the mastery of the Universe.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It describes the practice of people who are [[Homelessness|homeless]] or otherwise disadvantaged in society, trading sex for food, a place to sleep, or other [[basic needs]], or for [[Recreational drug use|drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flowers|first=R.

Some thinkers suggest that people are motivated to prostitute themselves because it is familiar&amp;nbsp;– specifically to victims of [[child sexual abuse]].&lt;ref name=Mallon/&gt; Other researchers state that, while some see it as a normal job, the vast majority want to get out of the industry given the potential for disease and dangerous clients.&lt;ref name=FarleyIQ/&gt;

==Prevalence==
Survival sex is common throughout the world, and has been extensively studied in many countries including the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], the [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[New Zealand]], [[Colombia]], [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Research on AIDS: knowledge, attitudes and practices among street youth | last=Barker | first=G. | journal=Children Worldwide:  International Catholic Child Bureau | year=1993 | volume=20 | issue=2–3 | pages=41–42 | pmid=12179310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers estimate that of [[homeless youth]] in [[North America]], one in three has engaged in survival sex. In one study of homeless youth in [[Los Angeles]], about one-third of females and half of males said they had engaged in survival sex.&lt;ref name="Flowers 2010 110–112"&gt;{{cite book|last=Flowers|first=R. Barri|title=Street kids: the lives of runaway and thrownaway teens|year=2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-4137-2|pages=110–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likelihood increases with the number of days the youth has been homeless, experience of being victimized, engaging in criminal behaviour, using illegal substances, attempting [[suicide]], being [[pregnant]] and having an [[Sexually transmitted infection|STI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neinstein|first=Lawrence S., and Catherine Gordon, Debra Katzman and David Rosen|title=Adolescent Health Care: A Practical Guide|year=2007|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-9256-1|pages=974|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&amp;linkCode=qs&amp;keywords=0781792568}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greene|first=J.M., S.T. Ennett, and C.L. Ringwalt|title=Prevalence and correlates of survival sex among runaway and homeless youth|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=89|issue=9|year=1999|pages=1406–1409|doi=10.2105/AJPH.89.9.1406|pmc=1508758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[LGBT|Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender]] street children are three times likelier to engage in survival sex compared with their heterosexual counterparts, according to one study. Another found that [[transgender]] youth are most likely of all to engage in survival sex.&lt;ref name="Flowers 2010 110–112"/&gt;

Survival sex is common in [[refugee camp]]s. In [[internally displaced persons]] camps in northern [[Uganda]], where 1.4 million civilians have been displaced by conflict between Ugandan government forces and the militant [[Lord's Resistance Army]], [[Human Rights Watch]] reported in 2005 that displaced women and girls were engaging in survival sex with other camp residents, local defense personnel, and Ugandan government soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Human Rights Watch|title=The Less They Know, the Better: Abstinence Only HIV/AIDS Programs in Uganda|year=2005|publisher=Human Rights Watch|location=New York|pages=55|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jDXEynHopkgC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=survival+sex#v=onepage&amp;q=survival%20sex&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivations==
Some researchers say that [[street children]] do not always see survival sex as exploitative: rather, they sometimes characterize it as the "beginning of a potential relationship." Given that one of the strongest predictors of engagement in survival sex is a prior history of [[sexual abuse]] by adult caregivers, some researchers theorize that rather than being driven to survival sex out of desperation, street children might be reproducing familiar behaviour and relationship patterns.&lt;ref name=Mallon&gt;{{cite book|last=Mallon|first=Gerald P., Peg McCartt Hess|title=Child Welfare for the Twenty-first Century: A Handbook of Practices, Policies, and Programs|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-231-13072-1|pages=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers maintain that people only engage in survival sex when they have no other options. Psychologist and anti-prostitution activist [[Melissa Farley]], writing in the [[New York Times]], says that prostitution is nearly always coercive and lacking in full consent. She says this is the biggest issue, not simple inequalities between buyers and sellers, nor health and safety risks. Farley says women rarely have viable alternative means of paying for the basic needs of themselves and their loved ones. Farley argues that even having the "job option" is immoral because it will most likely hurt women who are very vulnerable (psychologically, economically, or otherwise). Farley says for women looking to survive, the experience can be [[traumatizing]], and she describes it as "Becoming objects for [[masturbation]]". She also warns that the men who pay for prostitution the most are usually the most violent towards women.&lt;ref name=FarleyIQ&gt;[http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/c-prostitution-facts.html Prostitution Research and Education: Intelligence Squared Debate on "It's wrong to pay for sex"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001155723/http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/c-prostitution-facts.html |date=2012-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Farley, research suggests that very few prostitutes (she estimates that only 5% of women) make the choice freely. She says that most women in prostitution, including those working for [[escort service]]s, have been [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused as children]]. Farley claims that a majority of prostitutes would like to leave the industry.&lt;ref name=FarleyNYT&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/12/opinion/12farley.html?em&amp;ex=1205467200&amp;en=1fedfb27c3116307&amp;ei=5087%0A |title=The myth of the victimless crime |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=2008-03-12 |accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Herbert echoed a similar opinion, also in the New York Times. Herbert says "Those who think that most of the women in prostitution want to be there are deluded... the world of the prostitute is typically filled with pimps, sadists, psychopaths, drug addicts, violent criminals and disease."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/27/opinion/27herbert.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1310946059-1B1xmETcRvMXHJWoGBy82w |title=Today's hidden slave trade |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=2007-10-27 |accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outreach and law enforcement==
{{globalize|date=February 2014}}
[[File:Homeless children in US 2006-10.png|thumb|Homeless children in the US grew from 1.2 million in 2007 to 1.6 million in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Bassuk, E.L., ''et al.'' (2011) [http://www.homelesschildrenamerica.org/media/NCFH_AmericaOutcast2010_web.pdf ''America’s Youngest Outcasts: 2010''] (Needham, MA: The National Center on Family Homelessness) page 20&lt;/ref&gt;]]

US municipalities such as [[Boston]] and [[Dallas]] have noticed a sharp increase in [[Runaway (dependent)|runaways]] engaging in survival sex since 1999. Dallas established a special group home for counseling, from which 75% of the underage girls who receive treatment do not return to prostitution. Congress nearly approved a program for cities to create pilot programs modeled on the Dallas system in 2007, but never appropriated the necessary funds. The Department of Justice has yet to study the number of children involved in prostitution even though they were authorized by Congress to do so in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Urbina, I. (October 26, 2009) [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/us/27runaways.html?pagewanted=all "Running in the Shadows: For Runaways, Sex Buys Survival"] ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Center for Problem Oriented Policing claims, "there is no consensus on whether the practice is widespread," and recommends that runaways should be questioned about sexual abuse but not consensual sex, survival sex, or prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;Dedel, K. (2006) ''[http://www.popcenter.org/problems/runaways/ Juvenile Runaways]'' Guide No. 37 (Madison, Wisconsin: Center for Problem Oriented Policing) pp. 1 and [http://www.popcenter.org/problems/runaways/3 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[National Alliance to End Homelessness]], outreach services to help sexually exploited youth should focus on the locations where they congregate and are approached by [[pimp]]s for exploitation, including public spaces such as malls and schools, and the internet. Outreach workers need to develop a close professional relationship with law enforcement to learn about trends and locations, but should carefully avoid compromising their independence or the confidentiality of their clients. Local law enforcement should target pimps and customers (janes or johns) and not the victims (youth and young adult prostitutes) for prosecution to be effective. Partnerships between nonprofit programs and law enforcement can help offer survival sex worker victims community-based services and housing when they are picked up by police officers.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Alliance to End Homelessness]] (2009) ''[http://www.endhomelessness.org/files/2559_file_Sexual_Exploitation_of_Homeless_Youth_10_2009.pdf Homeless Youth and Sexual Exploitation: Research Findings and Practice Implications]'' (Washington, DC: endhomelessness.org)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[ECPAT|ECPAT International]], when sex industry women and children victims are held in police custody or remand homes, denied freedom and access to information, or abused by police, they are encouraged to lie about their situation and try to escape, so community assistance services are substantially less useful. Similar failures occur when court procedures do not allow victim testimony or representation or, when they do, are neither victim-friendly nor children-friendly; or when decisions on children's futures seldom include the opinions of children, or when the right to privacy is violated by media reporting, or by stigmatization of and discrimination against children exploited in prostitution. Governments have the duty to provide services to children, but sharing that duty with nonprofits by coordination, monitoring, and support, especially with respect to periodic review of placement, is likely to have the best results. Protection measures for children at all stages of the legal process has not been sufficiently implemented through children-friendly courts, justice systems and law enforcement agencies. Decriminalization of children exploited in prostitution is a substantial gap in addressing survival sex worldwide. Successful law enforcement partnerships have included a campaign of brothel-based prostitutes who policed the recruitment of under-age girls in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;Ennew, J.

'''Tacet''' is [[Latin]] which translates literally into English as "(it) is silent" (pronounced: {{IPA|/ˈte.sət/}}, {{IPA|/ˈtæ.sət/}}; or {{IPA|/ˈtɑ.ˌkɛt/}}).&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Tacet|accessdate=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a musical term to indicate that an instrument or voice does not sound, also known as a [[rest (music)|rest]]. In vocal polyphony and in orchestral scores, it usually indicates a long period of time, typically an entire [[Movement (music)|movement]]. In more modern music such as [[jazz]], tacet tends to mark considerably shorter breaks. '''Multirests''', or multiple-measure rests, are rests which last multiple [[bar (music)|measures]] (or multiple rests, each of which lasts an entire measure).

A word by which the performer is to understand that the instrument with the name of which it is conjoined is to be silent: a ''Violino Tacet''; the violin is not to play: ''Oboe Tacet''; the oboe is silent.|[[Thomas Busby (composer)|Thomas Busby]] (1827)&lt;ref&gt;Busby, Thomas (1827).

Snider. {{pre-ISBN}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was common for early [[Symphony|symphonies]] to leave out the [[brass instrument|brass]] or [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] in certain movements, especially in slow (second) movements, and this is the instruction given in the parts for the player to wait until the end of the movement.

[[File:15 bars multirest.png|thumb|How multirests are now notated, known as the H-bar (which may be narrow, leaving room for things such as an [[anacrusis]] to be written in)]]

It is also commonly used in [[accompaniment]] music to indicate that the instrument does not play on a certain run through a portion of the music, i.e., "Tacet 1st time." The phrase ''tacet al fine'' is used to indicate that the performer should remain silent for the remainder of the piece (or portion thereof), and need not, for example, count rests.

Tacet may be appropriate when a particular instrument/voice/section, "is to rest for an entire section, movement, or composition."&lt;ref&gt;McGrain, Mark (1990). ''Music Notation'', p.126. Hal Leonard. {{ISBN|9781476867052}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Partial rests, of course, in every case must be written in. Even though it means 'silent,' the term ''tacet''...is not a wise substitution for a lengthy rest within a movement...The term ''tacet'', therefore, should be used ''only'' to indicate that a player rests throughout an ''entire movement''. In printed music this would be indicated:"&lt;ref&gt;[[Gardner Read|Read, Gardner]] (1969/1979). ''Music Notation: A Manual of Modern Practice'', p.435-7. 2nd edition.

==Uses of tacet==
The earliest known usage of the term is 1724.&lt;ref name="MW"/&gt;

A unique usage of this term is in [[John Cage|John Cage's]] 1952 composition [[4′33″]].  A tacet is indicated for all three movements, for all instruments.  The piece lasts a total of 4 minutes and 33 seconds, without a note being played.

A '''tautonym''' is a [[scientific name]] of a species in which both parts of the name have the same spelling, for example ''[[Rattus rattus]]''. The first part of the name is the name of the genus and the  second part is referred to as the ''specific epithet'' in the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' and the ''specific name'' in the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]''.

Tautonymy (i.e., the usage of tautonymous names) is permissible in zoological nomenclature (see [[List of tautonyms]] for examples). In past editions of the zoological Code, the term tautonym was used, but it has now been replaced by the more inclusive "tautonymous names"; these include trinomial names such as ''[[Gorilla gorilla gorilla]]'', and ''[[Bison bison bison]]''.

For animals, a tautonym implicitly indicates that the species is the [[type species|type]] of its genus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iczn.org/iczn/index.jsp ICZN. Chapter 15 Art. 68a]&lt;/ref&gt; This can also be indicated by a species name with the specific epithet ''typus'' or ''typicus'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iczn.org/iczn/index.jsp ICZN. Chapter 15 Art. 68c]&lt;/ref&gt; although more commonly the [[type species]] is designated another way.

==Botanical nomenclature==

In the current rules for [[botanical nomenclature]] (which apply retroactively), tautonyms are explicitly prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art23#23.4 |title=Article 23.4 |date=2012 |work=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) |publisher=International Association for Plant Taxonomy|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of a botanical tautonym is 'Larix larix'. The earliest name for the [[European Larch|European larch]] is ''Pinus larix'' L. (1753) but [[Gustav Karl Wilhelm Hermann Karsten]] did not agree with the placement of the species in ''[[Pinus]]'' and decided to move it to ''[[Larix]]'' in 1880. His proposed name created a tautonym. Under rules first established in 1906, which are applied retroactively, 'Larix larix' does not and cannot exist (as a formal name). In such a case either the next earliest validly published name must be found, in this case ''[[Larix decidua]]'' Mill. (1768), or (in its absence) a new epithet must be published.

However, it is allowed for both parts of the name of a species to mean the same ([[pleonasm]]), without being identical in spelling. For instance, ''Arctostaphylos uva-ursi'' means [[bearberry]] twice, in Greek and Latin respectively; ''Picea omorica'' uses the Latin and Serbian terms for a [[pine]].

Instances that repeat the genus name with a slight modification, such as ''Lycopersicon lycopersicum'' (Greek and Latinized Greek, a rejected name for the [[tomato]]) and ''[[Ziziphus zizyphus]]'', have been contentious, but are in accord with the Code of Nomenclature.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Kirkbride, J.H. |author2=Wiersema, J.H. |author3=Turland, N.J. |year=2006 |title=(1753) Proposal to conserve the name ''Ziziphus jujuba'' against ''Z. zizyphus'' (Rhamnaceae) |journal=Taxon |volume=55 |issue=4 |pages=1049–1050 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/iapt/tax/2006/00000055/00000004/art00039}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title}}
'''''Thought-Forms: A Record of Clairvoyant Investigation''''' is a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] book compiled by the members of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society]] [[Annie Besant|A. Besant]] and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C. W. Leadbeater]]. It was originally published in 1901 in London.{{sfn|Melton|2001b|p=1566}}{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=248}} From the standpoint of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], it tells regarding visualization of thoughts, experiences, emotions and music. Drawings of the "thought-forms" were performed by painters Varley, Prince, and McFarlane.{{sfnm|Gettings|1978|1p=136|Tillett|1986|2p=224}}{{refn|group=note|According to [[Vladimir Trefilov|Trefilov]], Theosophy, unlike an academic science, "views the whole world as a manifestation of thought in all categories of matter. [[Occultism|Occult science]] know about the existence of higher types of rarefied matter. Man is in no way limited by the physical world alone."{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=234}} [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|Radhakrishnan]] wrote, "There are [[Plane (esotericism)|other worlds]] than that which our senses reveal to us, [[clairvoyance|other senses]] than those which we share with the lower animals, other forces than those of material nature."{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|2008|p=373}} Thus, it is necessary to develop the "new senses" in order to "perceive thought-forms."{{sfn|Ellwood|1986|p=117}} Academic science explains the visualization of sensations of a mentally healthy person by a phenomenon of the [[synesthesia]].{{sfn|Britannica}}}}

== From history of compilation ==
This book has become the result of the joint work of the authors, which began in 1895, when they had started an investigation of "the subtle matter of the universe."{{sfn|Wessinger}} They were interested the work of the human mind as, according their claim, this work "extrudes into the external world" the thought-forms.{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}}

In September 1896, Besant reported in [[Lucifer (magazine)|''Lucifer'']] that "two clairvoyant Theosophists" (whose personalities were not disclosed in the journal, although some members of the Society knew about them) had started "observing the substance of thought." Her article named ''Thought-Forms''{{refn|group=note|Leadbeater does not appear here as a co-author of Besant, nevertheless, according to [[Olav Hammer|Hammer]], after [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky's]] death, it was he who became the main ideologist of the "second generation" of the Theosophists.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=509}}}} was accompanied by four pages of pictures of diverse thought-forms which the investigators "had observed and described to an artist."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}}{{refn|group=note|A tradition of "seeing thoughts" already existed in [[spiritualism]]. Dr. Baraduc, a famous French psychiatrist, had informed the "Acadamie de Medecine" in 1896 that he had succeeded to photograph thoughts.{{sfn|Melton|2001b|p=1565}}{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=990}}}} The colour sketches of the unknown performance were depicting: on the first plate—thought-forms of "devotion," "sacrifice," and "devotional," on the second one—three types of "anger," on the third one—three types of "love" ("undirected," "directed," and "grasping"), and on the fourth one—thought-forms of "jealousy," "intellect," and "ambition."{{sfn|Index}} Besant gave the article scientific coloring, not forgetting to mention [[Wilhelm Röntgen|Röntgen]], Baraduc,{{sfn|Melton|2001a}} [[Carl Reichenbach|Reichenbach]], "vibrations and the ether."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}}

This "small but influential book",{{refn|group=note|According to the scholars of religious studies, the authors of the ''Encyclopedia of Women and Religion in North America.''{{sfn|Keller|2006}}}} which contains color pictures of thought-forms that the authors said are created "in subtle spirit-matter," was published in 1901. The book affirms that "the quality" of thoughts influences the life experience of their creator, and that they "can affect" other people.{{sfn|Keller|2006|p=755}}{{refn|group=note|As Leadbeater noted, "books are specially strong centres of thought-forms, and their unnoticed influence in a man's life is often a powerful one."{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 15}}}}

== Basic concepts ==
=== Meaning of color ===
[[File:Colorchart.jpg|thumb|left|160px|&lt;center&gt;Frontispiece. The meanings of colours.&lt;/center&gt;]]
The authors write that they, like many theosophists, are convinced that "thoughts are things," and the task of their book is to help the reader understand this.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=16}}{{refn|group=note|[[Gary Lachman|Lachman]] noted that it is "the central maxim of ''Thought-Forms.''"{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}}} The frontispiece of the book contains a table "The meanings of colours" of thought-forms and [[Aura (paranormal)|human aura]] associated with feelings and emotions, beginning with "High Spirituality" (light blue—in the upper left corner) and ending by "Malice" (black—in the lower right corner), 25 colors in all.{{refn|group=note|See the frontispiece of ''Thought-Forms,'' 1901. For comparison, see table "Auric Colors and Their Meanings"{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|pp=64–66}} and Ch. "Colours."{{sfn|Powell|1927|loc=Ch. 3}}}}{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}{{sfn|Писарева|2010|p=29}}{{refn|group=note|"Every thought form bears the same color that it would possess if it had been retained in the body of the aura itself."{{sfn|Atkinson|2011|p=34}}}} The authors argue that human aura is "the outer part of the cloud-like substance of his higher bodies, interpenetrating each other, and extending beyond the confines of his physical body."{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=55}} The [[Mental body|mental]] and [[Astral body|desire]] bodies (two human higher bodies) are "those chiefly concerned with the appearance of what are called thought-forms."{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=17|Johnston|2012|2p=158}}{{refn|group=note|[[Robert Ellwood|Ellwood]] wrote that, according to theosophy, "auras may be made up of a complex combination of etheric, astral, and mental matter which the clairvoyant is able to perceive, although the most significant ones originate on the border of the mental and astral planes, where the activity of the former is reflected in the configurations of astral matter. When comparable patterns appear as a 'cloud' above or near a person, they may be called 'thought-forms' and as such have been reported in theosophical literature."{{sfn|Ellwood|1986|p=115}}}}{{refn|group=note|Thought-forms are created from the same matter from which the aura is formed, and have the same general properties, in particular, color. Knowledge of the properties of an aura of man is necessary for a proper "understanding of the nature of the thought-forms."{{sfn|Atkinson|2011|p=31}} According to Powell, the term "thought-forms" is "not wholly accurate," because in the overwhelming majority of cases they are being formed by both astral and mental bodies. It would be more correct to call them ''thought-emotion forms.''{{sfn|Powell|1927|pp=43, 55}} Gettings wrote that in studying the illustrations from this book "one cannot help observing that they do not really relate to thought so much as to feeling – they are really emotion forms rather than thought forms."{{sfn|Gettings|1987|p=47}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Tillett, "Whether or not there is scientific validity in claims about the aura, it remains significant that Leadbeater's descriptions (given initially in an article [''The Aura''] in ''[[The Theosophist]]'' in [December] 1895{{sfn|IndexT}}) have been more or less repeated by later researchers, both scientific and occult. The earliest scientific study of the aura [''The Human Atmosphere,'' 1911] was published by [[Walter John Kilner]]."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=953}}}}

=== Three principles and three classes ===
The book states that "the production of all thought-forms" is based on three major principles:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# Quality of thought determines colour.
# Nature of thought determines form.
# Definiteness of thought determines clearness of outline.{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=31|Писарева|2010|2p=29|Jones|2012|3p=54}}{{refn|group=note|[[Alice Bailey|Bailey]] has contraposed the "clear and well-defined, pulsating with the spirit of service" thought-forms of the initiated occultist with the "disjointed, unconnected, and uncorrelated" thought-forms created by the "mass of men."{{sfn|Bailey|2012|p=87}} As Powell wrote, many people go through life, literally tightly locked in their own cells, which they themselves have built, "surrounded by masses of forms created by their habitual thoughts."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=47}} Leadbeater noted later that most people can not free themselves from the influence "of the great crowd of thought-forms which constitute [preconceived] public opinion; and because of those they never really see the truth at all."{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 10}}}}{{refn|group=note|"Thought-forms, or 'an artificial [[elemental]]s,' have a huge impact on the earthly life of people, performing certain functions depending on the desires and direction of the thought that created them."{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=237}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The authors define the following three classes of thought-forms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# That which takes the image of the thinker. When a man thinks of himself as in some distant place, or wishes earnestly to be in that place, he makes a thought-form in his own image which appears there.
# That which takes the image of some material object. [The painter who forms a conception of his future picture builds it up out of the matter of his mental body, and then projects it into space in front of him, keeps it before his mind's eye, and copies it. The novelist in the same way builds images of his character in mental matter, and by the exercise of his will moves these puppets from one position or grouping to another, so that the plot of his story is literally acted out before him.]{{refn|group=note|A comparison of the thought-forms of literary heroes with marionettes, Leadbeater repeated in 1913 in his next Theosophical book.{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 6}}}}
# That which takes a form entirely its own,{{refn|group=note|Pisareva wrote that the thought-forms belonged to this category may be named the "symbolic forms."{{sfn|Писарева|2010|p=27}}}} expressing its inherent qualities in the matter which it draws round it. [Those of which we here give specimens are almost wholly of that class.]{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=36|Писарева|2010|2p=26}}{{sfn|Harris}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Examples of thought-forms ==
[[File:Form16.jpg|thumb|left|160px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 16. Self-Renunciation.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=44}}{{refn|group=note|It's like "a pale blue lotus."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=225}} Blue color expresses "spirituality."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=66}} "A thought of definite, well-sustained devotion may assume a form closely resembling a flower."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=57}} The more purified desires and thoughts of man, the more "radiant and beautiful" are his thought-forms which he create.{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
"To paint in earth's dull colours the forms clothed in the living light of other worlds, — Besant writes in the foreword, — is a hard and thankless task." The authors claim that the images in the book "are not imaginary forms, prepared as some dreamer thinks that they ought to appear." Rather, "they
are representations of forms actually observed as thrown off by ordinary men and women." And the authors sincerely hope that they will force the reader "realise the nature and power of his thoughts, acting as a stimulus to the noble, a curb on the base."{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1pp=6, 39|Breen|2014|2p=110}}

=== Created by emotions ===
[[File:Form13.jpg|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 13. Grasping Animal Affection.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=43}}{{refn|group=note|It's like "brown-red swirls."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}} "Thoughts of a greedy, lustful, or malicious character appear differently from those of a noble, selfless, loving nature."{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}}}{{refn|group=note|"Thoughts in which selfishness or greed are prominent usually take a hooked form, the hooks in some case actually clawing round the object desired."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=56}} Leadbeater has compared similar thought-forms with the "[[grappling hook]]s."{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 8}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
In Fig. 13 shows the thought-form created by "a strong craving for personal possession." Its color has dull unpleasing hue "deadened with the heavy tint indicative of selfishness." The curving hooks are its especially characteristic. Creator this thought-form had never "conception of the self-sacrificing love which pours itself out in joyous service," no thinking of return.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=44}}{{refn|group=note|Tillett saw here only the "brown-red swirls."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}} An especially powerful class of this kind of thought-forms takes on "the appearance of a nebulous octopus, with long, winding, clinging tentacles, striving to wrap around the other person," and to drag him toward the aura of creator.{{sfn|Atkinson|2011|p=33}}}}{{refn|group=note|"A gross sensual love will be a dull and heavy crimson"... The mutual influence of thoughts is like "adding fuel to the fire." If someone for a long time is fraught with low thoughts, then into his mind will pour such a vicious stream that he will be horrified if he understands what he is doing with himself.{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|pp=65, 84}} According to Leadbeater, do not need to collect photos of actresses [and actors], as "they always attract the most undesirable thought-forms from hosts of impure-minded people."{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 15}}}}
[[File:Form19.jpg|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 19. The Intention to Know.{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=51|Gettings|1987|2p=48|Breen|2014|3p=112}}{{refn|group=note|"I asked him when he saw this curious shape."{{sfn|Jinarajadasa|2003}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
The authors write that a form in Fig. 19 at the top is a specific thought-form which had accompanied a question demonstrating deep thought and penetration. The first variant of the answer did not fully satisfy the questioner, and his desire to achieve a full and comprehensive answer was expressed in the fact that his "thought-form deepened in colour and changed into the second of the two shapes (in Fig. 19 below), resembling a corkscrew even more closely than before."{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=51}}{{refn|group=note|[[Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa|Jinarajadasa]] informed that on his question to Leadbeater "when he saw this curious shape" he answered that it is a creation of Mr. [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|Sinnett]], "who tried to 'worm' things out of him, when he appeared to be holding back some knowledge which Mr. Sinnett wanted."{{sfn|Jinarajadasa|2003}}}}{{refn|group=note|"Orange, of a bright shade, represents pride and ambition. Yellow, in its various shades, represents intellectual power."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=65}} Gold colour "indicates pure intellect applied to philosophy or mathematics."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=12}}}}
[[File:Forms22-23.jpg|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 22, 23. Murderous Rage and Sustained Anger.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=53}}{{refn|group=note|It's like "a bright red spike."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|pp=224–225}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
Fig. 22 and 23 are thought-forms of a "murderous rage" (on the right) and a "sustained anger" (on the left). The first form was taken "from the aura of a rough and partially intoxicated man in the [[East End]] of London," when he was knocking down a woman; a flare flashed in her direction, triggering an explosion of horror—she recognized that one would be struck. In the same illustration drawned a "stiletto-like dart" directed to the lower left corner: it is a thought "of steady anger, intense and desiring vengeance, of the quality of murder, sustained through years, and directed against a person who had inflicted a deep injury on the one who sent it forth."{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=53}}{{refn|group=note|Tillett has seen on the left "a bright red spike."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}} Sustained anger takes the form of "a sharp, red stiletto."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=58}} The thought-form of anger has a color of black and red, with characteristic flares.{{sfn|Atkinson|2011|p=34}}}}{{refn|group=note|Red color seen in the form of bright red flares like the lightning flash shows anger. These are "usually shown on a black background in the case of anger arising from hatred or malice."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|pp=64–65}}}}
[[File:Sudden Fright.jpg|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 27. Sudden Fright.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=55}}{{refn|group=note|It's like "a cloud of red-grey crescents."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=225}} "''Sudden Fright'' appears as a series of grey and red crescent shapes bursting out of the aura."{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:Greed for alcohol - Annie Besant Thought Form - Project Gutenberg eText 16269.PNG|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 29. Greed for Drink.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=56}}{{refn|group=note|"The craving for alcohol produced undesirable brown-red hooks."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=225}}}}{{refn|group=note|"The thought of the desire for drink could not enter the body of a purely temperate man. It would strike upon his astral body, but it could not penetrate and it would then return to the sender."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=49}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
The authors state that when a person is suddenly frightened, then has a place the effect shown in Fig. 27. It is emphasized that "all the crescents" on the right, which apparently have been emitted earlier than others, do not show anything other than "the livid grey of fear; but a moment later the man is already partially recovering from the shock, and beginning to feel angry that he allowed himself to be startled." The later crescents have changed to scarlet, and it evidences the "mingling of anger and fear," while the last crescent is quite scarlet, and it shows that "already the fright is entirely overcome, and only the annoyance remains."{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=55}}{{refn|group=note|According to Tillett, here you can see "a cloud of red-grey crescents."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=225}} Gray color of a specific shade, "almost that of a corpse", demonstrates "fear and terror." Red color shows anger.{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=64}}}}

=== Created by experiences ===
Beginning from Fig. 30, "the book changes course in an interesting way," moving from the illustrations of individual thoughts and emotions to the narrative of events.{{sfn|Breen|2014|pp=111–112}} Besant and Leadbeater write that occasioned by a "terrible accident" at sea, three thought-forms depicted in Fig. 30 "were seen simultaneously, arranged exactly as represented, though in the midst of indescribable confusion." The authors continue:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"They are instructive as showing how differently people are affected by sudden and serious danger. One form [on the right] shows nothing but an eruption of the livid grey of fear, rising out of a basis of utter selfishness: and unfortunately there were many such as this. The shattered appearance of the thought-form shows the violence and completeness of the explosion, which in turn indicates that the whole soul of that person was possessed with blind, frantic terror, and that the overpowering sense of personal danger excluded for the time every higher feeling."{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=57|Breen|2014|2p=112}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Form30.jpg|thumb|left|220px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 30. At a Shipwreck.{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=58|Breen|2014|2p=112}}{{refn|group=note|It's like "a grey-brown cloud [on the right]."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=225}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Lachman, the illustrations of thought-forms in the book are "very reminiscent of much [[Abstract art|abstract]] and [[Surrealism|surrealistic]] painting."{{sfn|Lachman|2008}} "This ushers in the visual heart of the book, featuring images that wouldn't look out of place hanging alongside early [[Kazimir Malevich|Malevich]] or [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]] abstractions."{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=112}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
The authors explain that the thought-form in Fig. 30 on the left shows an attempt to find "solace in prayer," and in this way overcome fear. This can be seen under a grayish-blue color, "which lifts itself hesitatingly upwards." Yet it is seen that judging by "the lower part of the thought-form, with its irregular outline and its falling fragments, that there is in reality almost as much fright here" as in the case on the right. Thus, one person has a chance to restore "self-control," while the other remains "an abject slave to overwhelming emotion." The thought-form at upper has been created by a member of the ship crew responsible for the lives of passengers, and it demonstrates a "very striking contrast" of the weakness manifesting in two forms from below. Herein shown "a powerful, clear-cut and definite thought, obviously full" of energy and determination. Orange color speaks of his confidence in ability to manage with the difficulty. The "brilliant yellow" means that his intellect is already at work upon the problem.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=57}}{{refn|group=note|Gray color of a specific shade demonstrates "fear and terror." Orange of a "bright shade, represents pride and ambition." Yellow, in its diverse tones, shows "intellectual power."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|pp=64, 65}}}} 
[[File:Form31.jpg|left|thumb|220px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 31. On the First Night.{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=59|Breen|2014|2p=112}}{{refn|group=note|"Figure 31 is another narrative piece."{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=112}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
Fig. 31 is another declarative piece, depicting "the thought-form of an actor while waiting to go upon the stage." The authors expound that the orange band indicates self-confidence,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"yet in spite of this there is a good deal of unavoidable uncertainty as to how this new play may strike the fickle public, and on the whole the doubt and fear overbalance the certainty and pride, for there is more of the pale grey than of the orange, and the whole thought-form vibrates like a flag flapping in a gale of wind." {{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=59|Breen|2014|2p=112}}{{refn|group=note|Gray color represents fear. Bright orange shows "pride and ambition."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|pp=64, 65}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the thought-form on the left in Fig. 34, as the authors explain, there is nothing but "the highest and most beautiful" feelings. At the base of the thought-form, you can see "a full expression of deep sympathy," the light green color shows the understanding of the suffering of the deceased's relatives and condolence with them, and the strip "of deeper green shows the attitude of the thinker towards the dead man himself." The dense rose-color shows love to both the deceased and the surrounding, while the upper part, consisting of a cone and stars above it, indicates a feeling in connection with thoughts of death: the blue express "its devotional aspect," while as "the violet shows the thought of, and the power to respond to, a noble ideal" and the ability to match, the stars reflect "the spiritual aspirations."{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=62}}{{refn|group=note|According to Gettings, the thought-form to the left is a spiritual one "which was a result of the highest meditation in the face of the loss of the loved one."{{sfn|Gettings|1987|p=47}} "Pale, luminous blue-green" shows deep sympathy and compassion. "Luminous lilac-blue, usually accompanied by sparkling golden stars" is associated with a high level of spirituality and noble aspirations. Rose color expresses selfless love.{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=12}}}} In the same figure, the thought-form on the right reflects nothing but only "profound depression, fear and selfishness."

The description of the event depicted in the book on Fig. 38, as noted a historian Breen, "anticipates the 1960s" as well with its conjunction of meditation and idealism: this thought-form was "generated by one who was trying, while sitting in [[meditation]], to fill his mind with an aspiration to enfold all mankind in order to draw them upward towards the high ideal which shone so clearly before his eyes."{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=67|Breen|2014|2p=113}} The ability of the authors to see the "vibrations of ideas, emotions,  and sounds" demonstrates, in his opinion, "a sort of [[spirit]]ual [[synesthesia]]" which transform the religious act into a [[Neurology|neurological]] phenomenon.{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=110}}

The authors write that the thought-form shown in Fig. 41 was accompanied by "the devotional aspiration" to that [[Logos]] may thus be manifested through the man in meditation. It is this religious feeling gives a "pale blue" shade to the five-pointed star. This form has been used "for many ages as a symbol of God manifest in man."{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=69}}{{refn|group=note|Thought-forms created by men who have "mind and emotion well under control and definitely trained in meditation, are clear, symmetrical objects."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=58}} Light blue color, of a "peculiarly clear and luminous shade, represents spirituality."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=66}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Breen, this thought-form looks like a kind of [[logo]]s in advertising: it can be easily taken as an old oil company sign, "competing with [[Esso]], [[British Petroleum]]and [[Royal Dutch Shell]]."{{sfn|Breen|2014|pp=112–113}} Nevertheless, according to Bailey, our solar system is the manifested "thought-form" of its Logos.{{sfn|Bailey|1925|p=556}}}}{{refn|group=note|The diversity of guises of thought-forms is almost endless.

Plate M showing the form created by music of [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] "depicts yellow, red, blue and green lines rising out of a church." This, as the authors explain, "signifies the movement of one of the parts of the melody, the four moving approximately together denoting the treble, alto, tenor and bass respectively." Moreover, "the scalloped edging surrounding the whole is the result of various flourishes and [[arpeggio]]s, and the floating crescents in the centre represent isolated or [[staccato]] chords."{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=77|Breen|2014|2p=110}}{{refn|group=note|Lachman named the musical forms of Besant and Leadbeater "the synaesthetic forms created by music."{{sfn|Lachman|2008}} In the first part of her article ''[[Occult or Exact Science?]]'' Blavatsky described in detail the multiple phenomena of color-sound vision.{{sfn|Blavatsky|1956|pp=57–58}}}}

According to professor [[Robert Ellwood|Ellwood]], the book by Besant and Leadbeater had a large influence on [[modern art]]. "It suggested, to a world moving rapidly beyond the literalism of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] art, the expression in painting of [[Surrealism|surreal]] forms and forces underlying, but different from, the visible world."{{sfn|Ellwood}} ''Thought-Forms'' demonstrated how the symbolism of "astral colors and forms" can express the specificity of "certain soul's and mental states." It had a great influence on [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]{{sfn|Kramer|1995}}{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}{{refn|group=note|The ideas which Kandinsky "elaborated in numerous notes and articles, including the now iconic text ''On the Spiritual in Art,'' were a combination of Besant and Leadbeater's theories on thought-forms, [[Rudolf Steiner|Steiner's]] considerations of colour, music, and vibration, [and] theories about synaesthesia."{{sfn|Johnston|2012|p=159}} Kandinsky "owned a German translation" (1908 edition) of the book ''Thought-Forms.''{{sfn|Gettings|1978|p=135}}}} as one of the essential factors that led to the "genius opening of new perspectives for painting."{{sfn|Бычков|2007|p=83}}{{refn|group=note|According to Lachman, one Kandinsky's painting in which the "influence of ''Thought-Forms'' is quite visible" is [http://www.wassilykandinsky.ru/work-186.php ''Woman in Moscow'' (1912).]{{sfn|Lachman|2008}} Also one of Kandinsky's paintings "is similar" to the musical form from the book of Besant and Leadbeater.{{sfn|Alvarenga|2011}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Jones, two Leadbeater's books are "relevant to [[František Kupka|Kupka's]] search for the immaterial: ''Clairvoyance'' (1899) and ''Thought-Forms'' (1901), co-written with Besant."{{sfn|Jones|2012|p=51}}}}

According to reminiscences by [[Leonid Sabaneyev|Sabaneyev]], besides ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]] interested a magazine ''Vestnik Theosofii,'' which published [from 1908] the translations of Besant and Leadbeater's works.{{sfn|Сабанеев|2000|p=63}}{{sfn|Архив ВТ}} Apparently, being impressed by theirs theosophical works, he once said that "strong, powerful thought creates a thought-form so intense that it, in addition to the will, flows into the consciousness of other people."{{sfn|Сабанеев|2000|p=307}}{{refn|group=note|According to an Ukrainian philosopher Julia Shabanova, a book ''Thought-Forms'' was being "discussed" by Alexander Scriabin and [[Jean Delville]], a Belgian [[symbolist]] painter.{{sfn|Шабанова}}}} The perform of the [[Part (music)|part]] of light in [[Prometheus: The Poem of Fire|''Prometheus'']] he imagined in the form of a radiance of some "luminous matter," which was supposed to fill the hall.{{sfn|Сабанеев|2000|p=70}}{{refn|group=note|"Scriabin introduced many Theosophical ideas into his compositions and also experimented with 'synesthesia,' the strange experience of 'hearing colors' and 'seeing music'."{{sfn|Lachman|2002}}}}{{refn|group=note|See also: [[Clavier à lumières]]}}

A historian Breen wrote that Besant and Leadbeater were well aware how annoying stuff may be their book for a "society that remained deeply conservative." In early January 1901, when this book was published, "[[Queen Victoria]] still ruled England. '[[Modernism]]' as a movement or even a concept did not exist. When we consider this world of 1901, – further wrote Breen, – it becomes difficult not to believe that Besant, Leadbeater and their milieu deserve a more prominent place in the annals of both abstract art and the history of modernism." As the art critic [[Hilton Kramer|Kramer]] has pointed, "what is particularly striking about the outlook of the artists primarily responsible for creating [[Abstract art|abstraction]] is their espousal of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|occult doctrine]]."{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=113}} [[W. B. Yeats|Yeats]], [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[Kazimir Malevich|Malevich]], Kandinsky, and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] were charmed by Theosophy.{{refn|group=note|[[Max Beckmann|Beckmann]] who was "impressed" by the book ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' he read in 1934 made several different sketches "on the theme" of its second volume ''Anthropogenesis.'' The album with these sketches is in the Washington [[National Gallery of Art|National Gallery]].{{sfn|Бычков|2009|p=171}}}} In the first decades of the twentieth century, it was a widespread "component of Western cultural life."{{sfn|Breen|2014|pp=113–114}}{{refn|group=note|"[[J. Robert Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]] famously quoted [[Vedas|Vedic scripture]]... when he witnessed the first atomic bomb blast. But in the context of figures like Besant and Ledbetter, Oppenheimer's fascination with Eastern [[mysticism]] seems less like a personal quirk and more like a thread in a larger tapestry: an interweaving of mysticism, technology, and art that began at the turn of the last century and is still with us in the twenty-first."{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=114}}}}

Thus, Besant and Ledbetter had played, summed up Breen, "a small but intriguing role in shaping the globalized culture... which weaves together [[Eastern world|East]] and [[Western world|West]], mysticism and rationalism, sound and sight."{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=114}}{{refn|group=note|According to [[Albert Goldman|Goldman]], [[Elvis Presley|Presley]] interested the books by Blavatsky "and those of her disciples" Besant and Leadbeater.{{sfn|Goldman|1981|p=366}} Leadbeater's ''Inner Life'' has belonged to his favourite books, and he often read from it "aloud before going on stage to perform."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=10}}}}{{See also|Synesthesia#Art}}

== Criticism ==
{{criticism section|date=July 2018}}
An academic science names the activities of such "investigators," as the authors of this book, "[[pseudoscience]]", because it based on a concept of the [[extrasensory perception]].{{sfn|Carroll|2003}} The belief in existence of thought-forms "remains influential today" for the Theosophists, followers of [[New Thought]], [[New Age]] and in [[Neopaganism|neopagan movements]], including [[Wicca]].{{sfn|Keller|2006|pp=755–756}}{{sfn|Wessinger|2013|p=44}}

[[File:Kingston-plant-spill-swanpond-tn2.jpg|thumb|A {{convert|25|ft|m|sing=on}} wall of coal [[fly ash]] contaminated with toxic heavy metals, resulting from the [[Kingston Fossil Plant coal fly ash slurry spill|release of 5.4 million cubic yards of coal fly ash]] slurry into the [[Emory River]], [[Tennessee]], and nearby land and water features, in December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dewan8|Dewan 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt; Testing showed significantly elevated levels of arsenic, copper, [[barium]], cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, nickel, and thallium in samples of slurry and river water.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dewan9|Dewan 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt; Cleanup costs may exceed $1.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Poovey|Poovey 2001]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''toxic heavy metal''' is any relatively dense [[metal]] or [[metalloid]] that is noted for its potential toxicity, especially in environmental contexts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sriv|Srivastava &amp; Goyal 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;2]]&lt;/ref&gt; The term has particular application to [[cadmium]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[lead]] and [[arsenic]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brath|Brathwaite &amp; Rabone 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;363]]&lt;/ref&gt; all of which appear in the [[World Health Organization]]'s list of 10 chemicals of major public concern. Other examples include [[manganese]], [[chromium]], [[cobalt]], [[nickel]], [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[selenium]], [[silver]], [[antimony]] and [[thallium]].{{cn|date=February 2017}}

[[Heavy metals]] are found naturally in the earth. They become concentrated as a result of human caused activities and can enter plant, animal, and human tissues via inhalation, diet, and manual handling. Then, they can bind to and interfere with the functioning of vital cellular components. The toxic effects of arsenic, mercury, and lead were known to the ancients, but methodical studies of the toxicity of some heavy metals appear to date from only 1868. In humans, heavy metal poisoning is generally treated by the administration of [[chelation|chelating agents]]. Some elements otherwise regarded as toxic heavy metals are essential, in small quantities, for human health.

== Contamination sources ==
[[File:Tetraethyllead-3D-balls.png|thumb|[[Tetraethyl lead]] is one of the most significant heavy metal contaminants in recent use.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wright|Wright 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;288]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Heavy metals are found naturally in the earth, and become concentrated as a result of human activities. Common sources are mining and industrial wastes; vehicle emissions; [[Lead–acid battery|lead-acid batteries]]; fertilisers; paints; treated woods; aging water supply infrastructure;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harvey|Harvey, Handley &amp; Taylor 2015]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[microplastics]] floating in the world's oceans.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Howell|Howell et al. 2012]]; [[#Cole|Cole et al. 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;2589‒2590]]&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenic, cadmium and lead may be present in children's toys at levels that exceed regulatory standards. Lead can be used in toys as a [[stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilizer]], color enhancer, or anti-corrosive agent. Cadmium is sometimes employed as a stabilizer, or to increase the mass and luster of toy jewelry. Arsenic is thought to be used in connection with coloring dyes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Finch|Finch, Hillyer &amp; Leopold 2015, pp.&amp;nbsp;849–850]]&lt;/ref&gt; Regular imbibers of [[Moonshine|illegally distilled alcohol]] may be exposed to arsenic or lead poisoning the source of which is arsenic-contaminated lead used to [[solder]] the distilling apparatus. [[Rat poison]] used in grain and [[Mash ingredients|mash]] stores may be another source of the arsenic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Aggrawal|Aggrawal 2014, p.&amp;nbsp;680]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lead is the most prevalent heavy metal contaminant.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Di Maio|Di Maio 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;527]]&lt;/ref&gt; As a component of [[tetraethyl lead]], {{chem|(CH|3|CH|2|)|4|Pb}}, it was used extensively in [[gasoline]] during the 1930s–1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lovei|Lovei 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;15]]&lt;/ref&gt; Lead levels in the aquatic environments of industrialised societies have been estimated to be two to three times those of pre-industrial levels.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Perry|Perry &amp; Vanderklein 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;336]]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the use of leaded gasoline was largely phased out in North America by 1996, soils next to roads built before this time retain high lead concentrations. Lead (from [[lead(II) azide]] or [[lead styphnate]] used in firearms) gradually accumulates at firearms training grounds, contaminating the local environment and exposing range employees to a risk of [[lead poisoning]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Houlton|Houlton 2014, p.&amp;nbsp;50]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Entry routes ==

Heavy metals enter plant, animal and human tissues via air inhalation, diet and manual handling. Motor vehicle emissions are a major source of airborne contaminants including arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, nickel, lead, antimony, vanadium, zinc, platinum, palladium and rhodium.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bala|Balasubramanian, He &amp; Wang 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;476]]&lt;/ref&gt; Water sources (groundwater, lakes, streams and rivers) can be polluted by heavy metals leaching from industrial and consumer waste; [[acid rain]] can exacerbate this process by releasing heavy metals trapped in soils.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wors|Worsztynowicz &amp; Mill 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;361]]&lt;/ref&gt; Plants are exposed to heavy metals through the uptake of water; animals eat these plants; ingestion of plant- and animal-based foods are the largest sources of heavy metals in humans.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Radojevic|Radojevic &amp; Bashkin 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;406]]&lt;/ref&gt; Absorption through skin contact, for example from contact with soil, or metal containing toys and jewelry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guney|first1=Mert|last2=Zagury|first2=Gerald J.|title=Bioaccessibility of As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Sb in Toys and Low-Cost Jewelry|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|date=4 January 2014|volume=48|issue=2|pages=1238–1246|doi=10.1021/es4036122|bibcode=2014EnST...48.1238G}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; is another potential source of heavy metal contamination.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Qu|Qu et al. 2014, p.&amp;nbsp;144]]&lt;/ref&gt; Toxic heavy metals can [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] in organisms as they are hard to [[Metabolism|metabolize]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pezzarossa|Pezzarossa, Gorini &amp; Petruzelli 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;94]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Detrimental effects ==

Heavy metals "can bind to vital cellular components, such as [[Protein#Structural proteins|structural proteins]], [[enzymes]], and [[nucleic acid]]s, and interfere with their functioning".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Landis|Lanids, Sofield &amp; Yu 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;269]]&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms and effects can vary according to the metal or metal compound, and the dose involved. Broadly, long-term exposure to toxic heavy metals can have carcinogenic, central and peripheral nervous system and circulatory effects. For humans, typical presentations associated with exposure to any of the "classical"&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nielen|Neilen &amp; Marvin 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;10]]&lt;/ref&gt; toxic heavy metals, or chromium (another toxic heavy metal) or arsenic (a metalloid), are shown in the table.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Afal|Afal &amp; Wiener 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The toxic effects of arsenic, mercury and lead were known to the ancients but methodical studies of the overall toxicity of heavy metals appear to date from only 1868. In that year, Wanklyn and Chapman speculated on the adverse effects of the heavy metals "arsenic, lead, copper, zinc, [[iron]] and [[manganese]]" in [[drinking water]]. They noted an "absence of investigation" and were reduced to "the necessity of pleading for the collection of data".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wanklyn|Wanklyn &amp; Chapman 1868, pp.&amp;nbsp;73–8]]; [[#Cameron|Cameron 1871, p.&amp;nbsp;484]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884, Blake described an apparent connection between toxicity and the atomic weight of an element.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Blake|Blake 1884]]&lt;/ref&gt; The following sections provide historical thumbnails for the "classical" toxic heavy metals (arsenic, mercury and lead) and some more recent examples (chromium and cadmium).

[[File:Orpiment mineral.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Orpiment]], a toxic arsenic mineral used in the tanning industry to remove hair from hides.]]

=== Arsenic ===

[[Arsenic]], as [[realgar]] ({{chem|As|4|S|4}}) and [[orpiment]] ({{chem|As|2|S|3}}), was known in ancient times. [[Strabo]] (64–50 BCE – c. AD 24?), a Greek geographer and historian,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dueck|Dueck 2000, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–3, 46, 53]]&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that only slaves were employed in realgar and orpiment mines since they would inevitably die from the toxic effects of the fumes given off from the ores. Arsenic-contaminated beer poisoned over 6,000 people in the Manchester area of England in 1900, and is thought to have killed at least 70 victims.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dyer|Dyer 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clare Luce]], American ambassador to Italy from 1953 to 1956, suffered from [[arsenic poisoning]]. Its source was traced to flaking arsenic-laden paint on the ceiling of her bedroom. She may also have eaten food contaminated by arsenic in flaking ceiling paint in the embassy dining room.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whorton|Whorton 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;356]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arsenic contamination of groundwater|Ground water contaminated by arsenic]], as of 2014, "is still poisoning millions of people in Asia".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Notman|Notman 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mercury ===
[[File:Saint Isaac's Cathedral in SPB.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]], in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia. The [[gold]]-mercury [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]] used to [[gilding|gild]] its dome caused numerous casualties among the workers involved.]]
{{see also|Mercury in fish}}

The first emperor of unified China, [[Qin Shi Huang]], it is reported, died of ingesting [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] pills that were intended to give him eternal life.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Zhao|Zhao, Zhu &amp; Sui 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "mad as a hatter" is likely a reference to [[mercury poisoning]] among [[milliner]]s (so-called "[[mad hatter disease]]"), as mercury-based compounds were once used in the manufacture of felt hats in the 18th and 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Waldron|Waldron 1983]]&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, gold amalgam (an alloy with mercury) was widely used in [[gilding]], leading to numerous casualties among the workers. It is estimated that during the construction of [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] alone, 60 workers died from the gilding of the main dome.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Emsley|Emsely 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;326]]&lt;/ref&gt; Outbreaks of [[methylmercury]] poisoning occurred in several places in Japan during the 1950s due to industrial discharges of mercury into rivers and coastal waters. The best-known instances were in [[Minamata]] and [[Niigata Prefecture|Niigata]]. In Minamata alone, more than 600 people died due to what became known as [[Minamata disease]]. More than 21,000 people filed claims with the Japanese government, of which almost 3000 became certified as having the disease. In 22 documented cases, pregnant women who consumed contaminated fish showed mild or no symptoms but gave birth to infants with severe developmental disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Davidson|Davidson, Myers &amp; Weiss 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;1025]]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[industrial Revolution]], mercury levels have tripled in many near-surface [[seawater]]s, especially around [[Iceland]] and [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#NS2014|New Scientist August 2014, p. 4]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lead ===

The adverse effects of [[lead]] were known to the ancients. In the 2nd century BC the Greek botanist [[Nicander]] described the [[colic]] and [[paralysis]] seen in lead-poisoned people.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pearce|Pearce 2007]]; [[#Needleman|Needleman 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pedanius Dioscorides|Dioscorides]], a Greek [[physician]] who is thought to have lived in the 1st century CE,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rogers|Rogers 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;41]]&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that lead "makes the mind give way". Lead was used extensively in [[Roman aqueducts]] from about 500 BC to 300 AD.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gilbert|Gilbert &amp; Weiss 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Caesar]]'s engineer, [[Vitruvius]], reported, "water is much more wholesome from earthenware pipes than from lead pipes. For it seems to be made injurious by lead, because [[white lead]] is produced by it, and this is said to be harmful to the human body."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Prioreschi|Prioreschi 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;279]]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Mongol]] period in China (1271−1368 AD), lead pollution due to silver smelting in the [[Yunnan]] region exceeded contamination levels from modern mining activities by nearly four times.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hillman|Hillman et al. 2015, pp.&amp;nbsp;3353–3354]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Up to one-sixth of China's arable land might be affected by heavy metal contamination.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hillman|Hillman et al. 2015, p.&amp;nbsp;3349]]&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} In the 17th and 18th centuries, people in [[Devon]] were afflicted by a condition referred to as [[Devon colic]]; this was discovered to be due to the imbibing of [[lead poisoning|lead-contaminated]] [[cider]]. In 2013, the [[World Health Organization]] estimated that lead poisoning resulted in 143,000 deaths, and "contribute[d] to 600,000 new cases of children with intellectual disabilities", each year.&lt;ref&gt;[[#WHO|World Health Organization 2013]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. city of [[Flint, Michigan]], lead contamination in drinking water has been [[Flint water crisis|an issue since 2014]]. The source of the contamination has been attributed to "corrosion in the lead and iron pipes that distribute water to city residents".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Torrice|Torrice 2016]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, drinking water lead levels in north-eastern [[Tasmania]], Australia, were reported to reach over 50 times national drinking water guidelines. The source of the contamination was attributed to "a combination of dilapidated drinking water infrastructure, including lead jointed pipelines, end-of-life polyvinyl chloride pipes and household plumbing".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harvey|Harvey, Handley &amp; Taylor 2015]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chromium ===
[[File:Potassium-chromate-sample.jpg|thumb|right|[[Potassium chromate]], a [[carcinogen]], is used in the dyeing of fabrics, and as a [[Tanning (leather)|tanning agent]] to produce [[leather]].]]

[[Chromium(III)]] compounds and [[chromium]] metal are not considered a health hazard, while the toxicity and carcinogenic properties of [[chromium(VI)]] have been known since at least the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Barcelous|Barceloux &amp; Barceloux 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, Newman described the elevated cancer risk of workers in a [[chromate]] dye company.&lt;ref&gt;[[#NewmanD|Newman 1890]]&lt;/ref&gt; Chromate-induced dermatitis was reported in aircraft workers during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Haines|Haines &amp; Nieboer 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;504]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, an outbreak of dermatitis, ranging from [[erythema]] to exudative [[eczema]], occurred amongst 60 automobile factory workers in England. The workers had been wet-sanding chromate-based primer paint that had been applied to car bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#National|National Research Council 1974, p.&amp;nbsp;68]]&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, chromium was released from the [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] [[Orica]] explosives plant on August 8, 2011. Up to 20 workers at the plant were exposed as were 70 nearby homes in [[Stockton, New South Wales|Stockton]]. The town was only notified three days after the release and the accident sparked a major public controversy, with Orica criticised for playing down the extent and possible risks of the leak, and the state Government attacked for their slow response to the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tovey|Tovey 2011]]; [[#Jones|Jones 2011]]; [[#OB|O'Brien &amp; Aston]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cadmium-crystal bar.jpg|thumb|left|99.999% purity cadmium bar and 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; cube.]]

=== Cadmium ===

[[Cadmium]] exposure is a phenomenon of the early 20th century, and onwards. In Japan in 1910, the [[Mitsui Mining and Smelting Company]] began discharging cadmium into the Jinzugawa river, as a byproduct of mining operations. Residents in the surrounding area subsequently consumed rice grown in cadmium-contaminated irrigation water. They experienced softening of the bones and kidney failure. The origin of these symptoms was not clear; possibilities raised at the time included "a regional or bacterial disease or lead poisoning".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Vallero|Vallero &amp; Letcher 2013, p.&amp;nbsp;240]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, cadmium was identified as the likely cause and in 1961 the source was directly linked to mining operations in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Vallero|Vallero &amp; Letcher 2013, pp.&amp;nbsp;239–241]]&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, cadmium was found in [[Walmart]] exclusive [[Miley Cyrus]] jewelry. Wal-Mart continued to sell the jewelry until May, when covert testing organised by [[Associated Press]] confirmed the original results.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pritchard|Pritchard 2010]]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010 cadmium was detected in the paint used on promotional drinking glasses for the movie [[Shrek Forever After]], sold by [[McDonald's Restaurants]], triggering a recall of 12 million glasses.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mulvihill|Mulvihill &amp; Pritchard 2010]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Remediation ==
[[File:Metal-EDTA.svg|thumb|right|170px|A metal EDTA anion. Pb displaces Ca in {{chem|Na|2|[CaEDTA]}} to give {{chem|Na|2|[PbEDTA]}}, which is passed out of the body in [[urine]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Csuros|Cs uros 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;124]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In humans, heavy metal poisoning is generally treated by the administration of [[Chelation|chelating agent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Blann|Blann &amp; Ahmed 2014, p.&amp;nbsp;465]]&lt;/ref&gt;
These are chemical compounds, such as {{chem|link=EDTA|CaNa|2 EDTA}} (calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate) that convert heavy metals to chemically inert forms that can be excreted without further interaction with the body. Chelates are not without side effects and can also remove beneficial metals from the body. Vitamin and mineral supplements are sometimes co-administered for this reason.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ACS|American Cancer Society 2008]]; [[#NCPC|National Capital Poison Center 2010]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Soils contaminated by heavy metals can be remediated by one or more of the following technologies: isolation; immobilization; toxicity reduction; physical separation; or extraction. ''Isolation'' involves the use of caps, membranes or below-ground barriers in an attempt to quarantine the contaminated soil. ''Immobilization'' aims to alter the properties of the soil so as to hinder the mobility of the heavy contaminants. ''Toxicity reduction'' attempts to oxidise or reduce the toxic heavy metal ions, via chemical or [[Phytoremediation|biological means]] into less toxic or mobile forms. ''Physical separation'' involves the removal of the contaminated soil and the separation of the metal contaminants by mechanical means. ''Extraction'' is an on or off-site process that uses chemicals, high-temperature volatization, or electrolysis to extract contaminants from soils. The process or processes used will vary according to contaminant and the characteristics of the site.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Evanko|Evanko &amp; Dzombak 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;1, 14–40]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==

Some elements otherwise regarded as toxic heavy metals are [[dietary element|essential]], in small quantities, for human health. These elements include vanadium, manganese, iron, cobalt, copper, zinc, selenium, strontium and molybdenum.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bánfalvi|Bánfalvi 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;12]]&lt;/ref&gt; A deficiency of these essential metals may increase susceptibility to heavy metal poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Chowdhury|Chowdhury 1987]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Truth to materials''' is a tenet of [[modern architecture]] (as opposed to [[postmodern architecture]]), which holds that any material should be used where it is most appropriate and its nature should not be hidden. Concrete, therefore, should not be painted and the means of its construction should be celebrated &amp;ndash; by, for instance, not sanding away marks left by timber shuttering (''[[béton brut]]'').  As another example, [[porcelain]] is infrequently used in the exterior facing of buildings, but one modern example is the [[Dakin Building]], [[Brisbane, California]]; therefore, the porcelain panels of this building have been left uncovered by any paint or preservative.

'''Victorian burlesque''', sometimes known as '''travesty''' or '''extravaganza''',&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'',  "the various genre terms were always applied freely", and by the 1860s their use had become "arbitrary and capricious": see [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque,"] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}.  In an 1896 article on Burlesque in ''The Theatre'', the three terms are used interchangeably: see Adams, W. Davenport. "Burlesque: Old ''v.'' New", ''The Theatre'', 1 March 1896, pp. 144–45&lt;/ref&gt; is a genre of theatrical entertainment that was popular in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] England and in the New York theatre of the mid 19th century. It is a form of [[parody music|parody]] in which a well-known opera or piece of classical theatre or ballet is adapted into a broad comic play, usually a musical play, usually risqué in style, mocking the theatrical and musical conventions and styles of the original work, and often quoting or [[pastiche|pastiching]] text or music from the original work. Victorian burlesque is one of several forms of [[burlesque]].

Like [[ballad opera]], burlesques featured musical scores drawing on a wide range of music, from popular contemporary songs to operatic arias, although later burlesques, from the 1880s, sometimes featured original scores.  Dance played an important part, and great attention was paid to the staging, costumes and other spectacular elements of stagecraft, as many of the pieces were staged as [[extravaganza]]s.  Many of the male roles were played by actresses as [[breeches role]]s, purposely to show off their physical charms, and some of the older female roles were taken by male actors.

Originally short, one-act pieces, burlesques were later full-length shows, occupying most or all of an evening's programme. Authors who wrote burlesques included [[J. R. Planché]], [[H. J. Byron]], [[G. R. Sims]], [[F. C. Burnand]], [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Fred Leslie]].

==History==
Burlesque theatre became popular around the beginning of the [[Victorian era]]. The word "burlesque" is derived from the Italian ''burla'', which means "ridicule or mockery".&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', which defines the word as "That species of literary composition, or of dramatic representation, which aims at exciting laughter by caricature of the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects; a literary or dramatic work of this kind."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baldick&gt;Baldick, Chris. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t56.e153 "Burlesque",] ''The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', Oxford University Press, 2008. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', Victorian burlesque was "related to and in part derived from [[pantomime]] and may be considered an extension of the introductory section of pantomime with the addition of gags and 'turns'."&lt;ref name=grove&gt;[[Erich Schwandt|Schwandt, Erich]] et al. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque",] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another antecedent was [[ballad opera]], in which new words were fitted to existing tunes.&lt;ref&gt;Moss,  Harold Gene. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/830406 "Popular Music and the Ballad Opera",] ''Journal of the American Musicological Society'', Vol. 26, No. 3 (Autumn, 1973), pp. 365–82, University of California Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:1831 Royal Olympic.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Olympic Theatre]], for which Planché wrote ''Olympic Revels'']]
[[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]] produced burlesques at the [[Olympic Theatre]] beginning in 1831 with ''Olympic Revels'' by [[J. R. Planché]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, W. Davenport. ''A Book of Burlesque'' (London: Henry and Co., 1891), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  In these pieces, comedy stemmed from the incongruity and absurdity of the grand classical subjects, with realistic historical dress and settings, being juxtaposed with the everyday modern activities portrayed by the actors. For example, ''Olympic Revels'' opens with the gods of Olympus in classical Greek dress playing [[whist]].&lt;ref&gt;Reinhardt, p. 541&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early burlesques, the words of the songs were written to popular music, as had been done earlier in ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]''.  Later in the Victorian era, burlesque mixed [[operetta]], [[music hall]] and [[revue]], and some of the large-scale burlesque spectacles were known as [[extravaganza]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[H. J. Byron]]'s 1863 ''Il trovatore'' parody, which was labelled "a burlesque extravaganza": see Marvin, Roberta Montemorra. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3878318 "Verdian Opera Burlesqued: A Glimpse into Mid-Victorian Theatrical Culture",] ''Cambridge Opera Journal'', Vol. 15, No. 1 (March 2003), p. 42, Cambridge University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The English style of burlesque was successfully launched in New York in the 1840s by the manager and comedian William Mitchell, who had opened his Olympic Theatre in December 1839. Like the London prototypes, his burlesques included characters with nonsensical names such as Wunsuponatyme and The King of Neverminditsnamia, and made fun of all kinds of music currently being presented in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Delmer D. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/779924 "Public Music Performances in New York City from 1800 to 1850",] ''Anuario Interamericano de Investigacion Musical'', Vol. 6 (1970), pp. 5–50, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike pantomime, which aimed at all ages and classes, burlesque was aimed at a narrower, highly literate audience;&lt;ref name=tls/&gt; some writers, such as the Brough brothers,&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Barnabas Brough]] and his brother [[William Brough (writer)|William Brough]] wrote successful burlesques, sometimes jointly and sometimes alone. Their burlesques include ''The Enchanted Isle'' (1848), ''Medea'' (1856), ''Masaniello'' (1857), ''The Sphinx'' (1849) and ''The Last Edition of Ivanhoe'' (1850). See Dereli, Cynthia. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3577 "Brough, Robert Barnabas (1828–1860)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; aimed at a conservative middle class audience, and [[H. J. Byron]]'s success was attributed to his skill in appealing to the lower middle classes.&lt;ref name=tls&gt;Speaight, George. "All froth and bubble", ''The Times Literary Supplement'', 1 October 1976, p. 1233&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most frequent subjects for burlesque were the plays of Shakespeare and grand opera. From the 1850s onwards, burlesquing of Italian, French and, later in the century, German opera was popular with London audiences. [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Il trovatore]]'' and ''[[La traviata]]'' received their British premieres in 1855 and 1856 respectively; British burlesques of them followed quickly.  ''Our Lady of the Cameleon'' by [[Leicester Silk Buckingham]] and ''Our Traviata'' by William F. Vandervell (both 1857) were followed by five different burlesque treatments of ''Il trovatore'', two of them by H. J. Byron: ''Ill Treated Trovatore, or the Mother the Maiden and the Musicianer'' (1863) and ''Il Trovatore or Larks with a Libretto'' (1880).&lt;ref name=marvin&gt;Marvin,  Roberta Montemorra. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3878318 "Verdian Opera Burlesqued: A Glimpse into Mid-Victorian Theatrical Culture",] ''Cambridge Opera Journal'', Vol. 15, No. 1 (March 2003), pp. 33–66, Cambridge University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operas of [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]], [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]] were burlesqued.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;&lt;ref name=marvin/&gt; In a 2003 study of the subject, Roberta Montemorra Marvin noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
By the 1880s, almost every truly popular opera had become the subject of a burlesque. Generally appearing after an opera's premiere or following a successful revival, they usually enjoyed local production runs, often for a month or longer. The popularity of stage burlesque in general and operatic burlesque in particular seems to have stemmed from the many ways in which it entertained a diverse group, and the manner in which it fed and fed on the circus-like or carnivalesque atmosphere of public Victorian London.&lt;ref name=marvin/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[W. S. Gilbert]] wrote five opera burlesques early in his career, beginning with ''[[Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack]]'' (1866), the most successful of which was ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'' (1868).&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1870s, [[Lydia Thompson]]'s burlesque troupe, with [[Willie Edouin]], became famous for their burlesques, by such authors as [[H. B. Farnie]] and [[Robert Reece]], both in Britain and the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, W. J., rev. J. Gilliland. "Thompson, Lydia (1838–1908)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2008 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shakespeare scholar [[Stanley Wells]] notes that although parodies of Shakespeare had appeared even in Shakespeare's lifetime, the heyday of Shakespearean burlesque was the Victorian era.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Stanley. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2867735 "Shakespearian Burlesques",] ''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol. 16, No. 1 (Winter, 1965), pp. 49–61, Folger Shakespeare Library in association with George Washington University, accessed 2 February 2011  {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells observes that the typical Victorian Shakespeare burlesque "takes a Shakespeare play as its point of departure and creates from it a mainly comic entertainment, often in ways that bear no relation to the original play."&lt;ref name=Wells55&gt;Wells, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;  Wells gives, as an example of the puns in the texts, the following: Macbeth and Banquo make their first entrance under an umbrella.  The witches greet them with "Hail! hail! hail!": Macbeth asks Banquo, "What mean these salutations, noble thane?" and is told "These showers of 'Hail' anticipate your 'reign'".&lt;ref name=Wells55/&gt;  Musically, Shakespearean burlesques were as varied as the others of the genre.  An 1859 burlesque of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' contained 23 musical numbers, some from opera, such as the serenade from ''[[Don Pasquale]]'', and some from traditional airs and popular songs of the day including "[[Buffalo Gals]]", and "Nix my Dolly".&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs,  Henry E., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2869557 "The Bard Debunked",] ''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol. 31, No. 2 (Summer, 1980), pp. 294–96, Folger Shakespeare Library in association with George Washington University, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Faustupto.jpg|right|thumb|Sheet music from ''[[Faust up to Date]]'']]
The dialogue for burlesques was generally written in rhyming couplets, or, less often, in other verse forms, such as blank verse; it was notable for its bad [[pun]]s.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;  For example, in ''[[Faust up to Date]]'' (1888), a couplet reads:
:Mephistopheles: "Along the Riviera dudes her praises sing."
:Walerlie: "Oh, did you Riviera such a thing?"&lt;ref&gt;Lubbock, Mark.  [http://www.theatrehistory.com/british/lightopera001.html "History of British musical theatre",] ''The Complete Book of Light Opera'', New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962, pp. 467–68&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Grove'', although "an almost indispensable element of burlesque was the display of attractive women dressed in tights, often in [[Breeches role|travesty roles]] ... the plays themselves did not normally tend to indecency."&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;  Some contemporary critics took a sterner view; in an 1885 article, the critic Thomas Heyward praised Planché ("fanciful and elegant") and Gilbert ("witty, never vulgar"), but wrote of the genre as a whole, "the flashy, 'leggy', burlesque, with its 'slangy' songs, loutish 'breakdowns', vulgar jests, paltry puns and witless grimacing at all that is graceful and poetic is simply odious. … Burlesque, insensate, spiritless and undiscriminating, demoralizes both the audience and the players. It debases the public taste."&lt;ref&gt;Heyward, Thomas, "Burlesque: Its Uses and Abuses", ''Tinsley's Magazine'', November 1885,  p. 477&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert expressed his own views on the worth of burlesque:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The question whether burlesque has a claim to rank as art is, I think, one of degree. Bad burlesque is as far removed from true art as is a bad picture. But burlesque in its higher development calls for high intellectual power on the part of its professors. [[Aristophanes]], [[Rabelais]], [[George Cruikshank|Geo Cruikshank]], the authors of the ''[[Rejected Addresses]]'', [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]], Planché were all in their respective lines professors of true burlesque.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, W. S., Letter to Blanche Reives, ''quoted'' in "Modern Burlesque", ''The Orchestra'', November 1880, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his 1859 [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]] burlesque ''Hi-A-Wa-Tha'', the American playwright Charles Walcot encapsulated the character of burlesque in the epilogue, addressed to the audience by [[Mrs. John Wood]] as Minnehaha:
:Ye who love extravaganza,
:Love to laugh at all things funny,
:Love the bold anachronism.
:And the work of paste and scissors,
:And "the unities" destruction,
:Nigger airs, old glees, and catches,
:Interspersed with gems of Op'ra,
:Jokes and puns, good, bad, and so-so, –
:Come and see this mutilation,
:This disgraceful Hiawatha, Mongrel, doggerel Hiawatha!&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Hewitt, Barnard. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3204686  "Mrs. John Wood and the Lost Art of Burlesque Acting",] ''Educational Theatre Journal'', Vol. 13, No. 2 (May, 1961), pp. 82–85, Johns Hopkins University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, ten years later, Gilbert gave an English viewpoint on burlesque, in his epilogue to ''[[The Pretty Druidess]]'':
:So for burlesque I plead. Forgive our rhymes;
:Forgive the jokes you've heard five thousand times;
:Forgive each breakdown, cellar-flap, and clog,&lt;ref&gt;Three types of dance popular in burlesque&lt;/ref&gt;
:Our low-bred songs – our slangy dialogue;
:And, above all – oh, ye with double barrel –
:Forgive the scantiness of our apparel! &lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender reversal and female sexuality==
[[File:The_High_Rollers_Extravaganza_Co._-_Bend_Her_-_c.1900.jpg|thumb|300px|American burlesque on ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Ben Hur]]'', c. 1900.]]
Actresses in burlesque would often play [[breeches role]]s, which were male roles played by women; likewise, men eventually began to play older female roles.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;Hall, Edith. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30222456 "Classical Mythology in the Victorian Popular Culture"], ''International Journal of the Classic Tradition'', 1999, vol. 5, issue 3, pp. 336–366, accessed 4 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  These reversals allowed viewers to distance themselves from the morality of the play, focusing more on joy and entertainment than catharsis, a definitive shift away from neoclassical ideas.&lt;ref name=Hall /&gt;

The depiction of female sexuality in Victorian burlesque was an example of the connection between women as performers and women as sexual objects in Victorian culture.&lt;ref name="Buszek"&gt;Buszek, Maria-Elena.  [http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=394dd17c-6070-4982-a2c4-2e5723826ac7%40sessionmgr104&amp;vid=5&amp;hid=115 "Representing 'Awarishness': Burlesque, Feminist Transgression, and the 19th-Century Pin-up"]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''The Drama Review'', 1999, vol. 43, issue 4, pp. 141–162, accessed 4 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the history of theatre the participation of women on stage has been questioned.  Victorian culture viewed paid female performance as being closely associated with prostitution, “a profession in which most women in the theatre dabbled, if not took on as a primary source of income.”&lt;ref name=Buszek /&gt;

==Gaiety Theatre==
[[Image:Florence St. John.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Florence St. John]] in ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'']]
Burlesque became the specialty of London's [[Royal Strand Theatre]] and [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] from the 1860s to the early 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Sherson, Erroll, "Lost London Playhouses", ''The Stage'', 28 June 1923, p. 21, one of a series of articles later published in a 1925 book of same name.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s and 1870s, burlesques were often one-act pieces running less than an hour and using [[pastiche]]s and parodies of popular songs, opera [[aria]]s and other music that the audience would readily recognize. [[Nellie Farren]] starred as the Gaiety Theatre's "principal boy" from 1868, and [[John D'Auban]] choreographed the burlesques there from 1868 to 1891.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Mr. D'Auban's 'Startrap' Jumps". ''The Times'', 17 April 1922, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tm&gt;Biographical file for John D'Auban, list of productions and theatres, [[The Theatre Museum]], London (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward O'Connor Terry]] joined the theatre in 1876. Early Gaiety burlesques included ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'' (1868, by Gilbert), ''The Bohemian G-yurl and the Unapproachable Pole'' (1877), ''Blue Beard'' (1882), ''Ariel'' (1883, by [[F. C. Burnand]]) and ''[[Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed]]'' (1883).

Beginning in the 1880s, when comedian-writer [[Fred Leslie]] joined the Gaiety, composers like [[Meyer Lutz]] and [[Osmond Carr]] contributed original music to the burlesques, which were extended to a full-length two- or three-act format.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Humour in the Seventies", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 February 1914, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; These later Gaiety burlesques starred Farren and Leslie.  They often included Leslie's [[libretti]], written under his pseudonym, "A. C. Torr",&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Maurice. 'The spark that lit the bonfire', in ''Gilbert and Sullivan News'' (London) Spring 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and were usually given an original score by Lutz: ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]'' (1885), ''[[Monte Cristo Jr.]]'' (1886), ''Pretty Esmeralda'' (1887), ''[[Frankenstein, or The Vampire's Victim]]'' (1887),&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead, pp. 14 and 55&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mazeppa'' and ''[[Faust up to Date]]'' (1888).  ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blase Roue|Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]'' (1889) made fun of the play ''[[Ruy Blas]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]].&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead, pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt;  The title was a pun, and the worse the pun, the more Victorian audiences were amused.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Donald J., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3825187 "The Uses of Victorian Laughter",] ''Victorian Studies'', Vol. 10, No. 2 (December 1966), pp. 145–76,  Indiana University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last Gaiety burlesques were ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'' (1890),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Archive/August/prog1detail1.htm |title=Programme for ''Carmen up to Data'' |access-date=10 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210092757/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Archive/August/prog1detail1.htm |archive-date=10 December 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, pp. 254–55&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cinder Ellen up too Late]]'' (1891), and ''Don Juan'' (1892, with lyrics by [[Adrian Ross]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead, pp. 63–64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cuttings&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Gaiety.htm Arthur Lloyd Music Hall site (on Gaiety) ''Cuttings''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080104132022/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Gaiety.htm |date=4 January 2008 }} accessed 01 Mar 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1890s, Farren retired, Leslie died, and musical burlesque went out of fashion in London, as the focus of the Gaiety and other burlesque theatres changed to the new genre of [[Edwardian musical comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, Kurt. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/38669 "Edwardes, George Joseph (1855–1915)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, [[Seymour Hicks]] declared that burlesque "is dead as a doornail and will never be revived." From her retirement, Nellie Farren endorsed this judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, W. Davenport. "Burlesque: Old ''v.'' New", ''The Theatre'', 1 March 1896, pp. 144–45&lt;/ref&gt;
