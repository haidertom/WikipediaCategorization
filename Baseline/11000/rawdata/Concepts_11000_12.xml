Hindu religious NGOs, including MHS, decided to form a special committee after the burial of Murthi according to Islamic rights, to study and make recommendations on the issues of conversions to Islam, namely grabbing of dead bodies and conversions of children. Mr.P. Waythamoorthy was made the Chairman of this special committee.However, after more cases of temple demolitions and conversions, this committee evolved and saw the formation of Hindraf in June 2007 with the involvement of religious NGO's, politicians and other Indian-based NGO's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religious Freedom and the Indian Community in Malaysia|last=Vaithilingam.

The '''2007 HINDRAF rally''' was a rally held in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]], on 25 November 2007. The rally organiser, the [[HINDRAF|Hindu Rights Action Force]], had called the protest over alleged discriminatory policies which favour ethnic [[Malaysian Malay|Malays]]. The rally was the second such street protest after the [[2007 Bersih rally]] in Kuala Lumpur on 10 November 2007. The rally started when a crowd estimated to be between 5,000 and 30,000 people gathered outside the [[Petronas Twin Towers]] at midnight, early Sunday morning.

At least 240 people were detained, but half of them were later released.

==Background==
'''Religious persecution''' has been formidable source of marginalization of the people of Indian origin in Malaysia.Between April to May 2006, [[Demolition of Hindu temples in Malaysia|several Hindu temples were demolished]] by city hall authorities in the country, accompanied by violence against Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930195228/http://www.malaysiakini.com/opinionsfeatures/52600 Temple row - a dab of sensibility please],''malaysiakini.com''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Noor|first=Farish Ahmad Noor|date=2008|title=The Hindu Rights Action Force (Hindraf) of Malaysia: Communitarianism Across Borders?|url=http://hdl.handle.net?10220/40159|journal=|volume=|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 April 2006, the Malaimel Sri Selva Kaliamman Temple in Kuala Lumpur was destroyed by the City Hall authorities because of violation of construction laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-malaysia-demolishes-century-old-hindu-temple-1025317 |title=Malaysia demolishes century-old Hindu temple |publisher=[[Daily News and Analysis]] |accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The president of the Consumers Association of Subang and Shah Alam in Selangor State has been helping to organize efforts to stop the local authorities in the Muslim dominated city of Shah Alam from demolishing a 107-year-old Hindu temple. The growing Islamization in Malaysia is a cause for concern to many Malaysians who follow minority religions such as Hinduism.On 11 May 2006, armed city hall officers from [[Kuala Lumpur]] forcefully demolished part of a 60-year-old suburban temple that serves more than 1,000 Hindus because i[[Kuala Lumpur|was built]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;ld illegally.Moreover, the demolition of the Seri Maha Mariamman Temple in Padang Jawa, Shah Alam just a few days before Deepavali which is most important Hindu festival of lights in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Karmveer|date=2013|title=Challenges to the Rights of Malaysians of Indian Descent|url=http://www.e-ir.info/2013/02/06/challenges-to-the-rights-of-malaysians-of-indian-descent|journal=E-International Relation|volume=|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Noor|first=Farish Ahmad Noor|date=2008|title=The Hindu Rights Action Force of Malaysia: Communication Borders?|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10220/40159|journal=|volume=|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only that, an interesting case was the attempted demolition of the Sri Kaliamman Temple just outside Angkasapuri, which is the headquarters for Radio Televisyen Malaysia (RTM).The temple was asked to evacuate for security reasons stating that it was a security risk. The President of Temple confirmed that it was authorized by a former Minister of Information that the temple which was built by the staff of RTM remain at its present location which is part of the land of Angkasapuri. As the leader of Hindu delegation in the Committee, he enquired with the National Security Council representatives at the meeting whether the surau or the proposed site for the RM5million new mosque in the Angkasapuri compound was open for the staff only or the public as well.He stated that if the public is allowed to visit this Islamic place of worship, then how does the question of security arise when the temple is outside the compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religious Freedom and Malaysian Indian|last=Vaithilingam .A|first=A.

The Hindu Rights Action Force or [[HINDRAF]], a coalition of several NGO's, have protested these demolitions by lodging complaints with the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]] but with no response.&lt;ref name="Finexp"&gt;[http://www.financialexpress.com/latest_full_story.php?content_id=128069 Hindu group protests 'temple cleansing' in Malaysia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704022731/http://www.financialexpress.com/latest_full_story.php?content_id=128069 |date=4 July 2007 }},''Financial Express''&lt;/ref&gt; Many Hindu advocacy groups have protested what they allege is a systematic plan of temple cleansing in Malaysia. The official reason given by the Malaysian government has been that the temples were built "illegally". However, several of the temples are centuries old.
According to a lawyer for [[HINDRAF]], a [[Hindu temple]] is demolished in [[Malaysia]] once every three weeks.

'''Affirmative Action Policy''' is to ensure the peace and stability in the pluralist society of Malaysia.It was found to address Malay grievances.The government introduced a

number of policies to improve the condition of the Bumiputeras in all sectors of life.In 1971 the New Economic Policy was launched, effectively imposing a regime of

positive discrimination for Malays in a variety of sectors from education and business to the bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Karmweer Singh|date=2013|title=Challenges to the Rights of Malaysians of Indian Descent|url=http://www.e-ir.info/2013/02/06/challenges-to-the-rights-of-malaysians-of-indian-descent|journal=E-INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS|volume=|pages=9|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later revisions of this, such as the New Development Plan

(1991-2000) as well as the New Vision Policy (2000-2010),all targeted the promotion of the local Malay population.Although, the NEP was meant to eliminate poverty in

rural sectors,it had bypassed the private plantation which included the rubber plantation that employed a large number of Indian labourers.Statistics clearly showed that

more than 75% of Indians were in 1970 classified as low wages labourers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Socio-Legal Study of the Indian Minority in Malaysia|last=Kananatu|first=Thaatchaayini|publisher=Institute of Ethnic Studies (KITA),(UKM)|year=2016|isbn=978-967-0741-20-8|location=Selangor, Malaysia|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; The socio-economic situation of the Indian Tamil plantation labour in particular was a major

concern of the Malaysian Indian Congress(MIC).After Independence,the MIC President Tun V.T.Sambanthan had established the National Land Finance plantations that

were facing fragmentation.Without government aid it was considered a gergantuan task,and plea was made to low wages,loss of jobs and homes due to the fragmentation

exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Socio-Legal Study of the Indian Minority in Malaysia|last=Kananatu|first=Thaatchaayini Kananatu|publisher=Institute of Ethnic Studies|year=2016|isbn=978-967-0741-20-8|location=Selangor, Malaysia|pages=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1974 MIC Bluebook,spearheaded by the MIC President V.Manickavasagam,contained key proposals which included increase of Indian share capital,ownership and

control achievement of racial balance in public employment,offer of Indian who were restricted under the Employment Act 1968 and abolish the Contract Labour

System,allotment of new housing and Introduction of a systematic academic scheme for Tamil schools are recommended under the Aziz Commission Report.&lt;ref name="Kananatu 2016 181"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Socio-Legal Study of the Indian Minority in Malaysia|last=Kananatu|first=Thaatchaayini|publisher=Institute of Ethnic Studies (KITA) (UKM)|year=2016|isbn=978-967-0741-20-8|location=Selangor, Malaysia|pages=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MIC

Bluebook proposals indicate the socioeconomic grievances faced by the Indian Tamil plantation labour. The early efforts made by the MIC,none of the Bluebook

recommendation were taken into consideration.Following the fragmentation and redevelopment of rubber plantation land,the mid-1980 onward witnessed the gradual

urbanization of the Indian Tamil Plantation labour and the continued disregard of this particular class-based group's grievances by government policy and poverty

reduction programmes.The situation was found to worsen when rubber plantation were bought over through Permodalan Nasional Berhad(PNB),a Malay trust agency.As

such,the complicity between the private corporations and government established an unequal bargaining position between the plantation corporations and the Indian

Tamil plantation labour.&lt;ref name="Kananatu 2016 181"/&gt;

Without adequate labour representation and political clout, the Indian Tamil plantation labour face serious socio-economic problems such as loss jobs,eviction from estate

homes and forced relocation to urban squatters.By the mid-1990s,it was reported that 70.5% of Indians were employed low-waged labour in agricultural, manufacturing

and industrial jobs.The forced urbanization had led to the constitution of an urban Indian underclass that as facing social and economic grievances such as urban

poverty,lack of education,unemployment and social problems such as the escalation of crime among youths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Socio- Legal Study of the Indian Minority in Malaysia|last=Kananatu|first=Thaatchaiyini|publisher=Institute of Ethnic Studies|year=2016|isbn=978-967-0741-20-8|location=Selangor, Malaysia|pages=181–182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development programmes initiated under the National

Development Policy(NDP) and the socioeconomic programmes under the NEP had failed to consider the socioeconomic situation of the Indian Tamil plantation labour as

it was outside purview of the race-basd affirmative action policy.

'''Political Representation'''.MIC is the biggest India political party and a constituent of the rulling coalition government at the centre since independence does not have

much political clout and has not been able to do anything substantial to improve the lot of the Indians.Indian non-governmental organizations(NGOs),community and self-help groups among the urban Indian middle class have attempted to solve the socio-economic problems faced by the former Indian Tamil plantation labour.However,

contemporary Indian civil society is generally divided due to differences in ideology.The class-based approach taken by community groups such as Alaigal and JERIT

have successfully mobilized the Indian Tamil Plantation labour to seek their legal rights against unlawful eviction from homes and to obtain adequate and fair

compensation for retrenchment from plantation jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Socio-Legal Study of the Indian Minority in Malaysia|last=Kananatu|first=Thaatchaayini|publisher=Institute of Ethnic Studies KITA, UKM|year=2016|isbn=978-967-0741-20-8|location=Selangor, Malaysia|pages=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The urban Indian middle class had lost confidence in the political elites of the MIC who was seen as having a weak

bargaining clout within the communal Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition.The race-based politics of the BN was seen to have failed in resolving the serious issues faced by

class based group among the Indians.

Moreover,the unresolved Kampung Medan incident in 2001, which was reported to be a series of clashes between the Indian and Malay residents in the poorer urban

settlement of Kampung Medan in the state of Selangor, had deeply affected both the urban Indian underclass as well as the urban Indian middle-class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Socio- Legal Study of the Indian Minority in Malaysia|last=Kananatu|first=Thaatchaiyini|publisher=Institute of Ethnic Studies (KITA) (UKM)|year=2016|isbn=978-967-0741-20-8|location=Selangor, Malaysia|pages=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of the

Malaysian Human Rights Commission to investigate the causes of the incident had further exacerbated the loss of confidence in the government.Indian civil society had

viewed the incident as a mob attack against the Malaysian Human Rights Commission for falling to hold an inquiry on the matter.The High Court in the case took a restrictive approach in inter receptivity to public policy reference to the victims of the Kampung Medan incident as being of Indian origin and of Tamil ethnicity,the court replied that: "Whatever one uses to describe those victims,it makes not a whit of a difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Socio-Legal Study of the Indian Minority in Malaysia|last=Kananatu|first=Thaatchaayini|publisher=Institute of Ethnic Studies|year=2016|isbn=978-967-0741-20-8|location=Selangor, Malaysia|pages=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judiciary disregarded the class based as well as the race based identity of the victims and only took into consideration the technically of legal procedural arguments.The judgement also meant that the victims of Kampong Medan did not have any further recourse to justice.

The issue of forced religious conversion has also been at the forefront. The trigger incidents were the 2007 series of legal cases involving the custody rights of non-

Muslim Indian mothers against the unilateral rights of their newly converted Muslims husbands to convert their children to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Noor|first=Farish Ahmad Noor|date=2008|title=The Hindu Right Action Force(Hindraf) of Malaysia: Communitarianism Border|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10220/40159|journal=|volume=|pages=25|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two legal battles that became a

serious concern among the Indians were Shamala's case in 2003, and Subashini's case in 2007.Inboth,h the cases, the originally Hindu husband converted to Islam and the

attempted to unilaterally convert their children to Islam without the non-Muslims wife's legal permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Socio-Legal Study of the Indian Minority in Malaysia|last=Kananatu|first=Thaatchaayini|publisher=Institute of Ethnic Studies (KITA)(UKM)|year=2016|isbn=978-967-0741-20-8|location=Selangor, Malaysia|pages=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many such cases of conversion to Islam either

voluntary or forced upon the ethnic Indian community, which has caused fear and apprehensions among the group.

==Petition to the United Kingdom==
[[Image:HINDRAFQueen.jpg|thumb|A HINDRAF activist carries a poster of [[Elizabeth II]] during the march to deliver their petition to the British [[High Commission]]]]

On 31 August 2007, the 50th anniversary of [[Malaysia]]'s independence, [[Waytha Moorthy Ponnusamy|P. Waytha Moorthy]], a HINDRAF lawyer filed a [[class action]] suit against the [[Government of the United Kingdom]] at The [[Royal Courts of Justice]] in [[London]] for US$4 trillion (US$1 million for every [[Malaysian Indian]]) for "withdrawing after granting independence and leaving us (Indians) unprotected and at the mercy of a majority Malay-Muslim government that has violated our rights as minority Indians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policewatchmalaysia.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1188457297&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=9&amp; |title=名古屋に住むコがネイルスクールに進学。 |publisher=Policewatchmalaysia.com |date= |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as guaranteed in the [[Constitution of Malaysia|Federal Constitution]] when independence was granted.&lt;ref name="T"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuppusamy |first=Baradan |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1687973,00.html |title=Facing Malaysia's Racial Issues |publisher=TIME |date=26 November 2007 |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawsuit is not only claiming 4 trillion [[Pound Sterling|British Pounds]] as compensation, it is also seeking to strike out [[Article 153 of the Malaysian Constitution]] which acknowledges the special position of Malays and the legitimate rights of other races, but is often seen as endorsement of [[Ketuanan Melayu|Malay Supremacy]] and for the court to declare that Malaysia is a [[secular state]] and not an [[Islamic state]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=39221 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211003316/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=39221 |archivedate=11 December 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as declared by former Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad|Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad]] who is partly Indian himself.

As the group, which represents mainly working class [[Indian Malaysian]]s, could not afford the legal fees required, a petition was circulated with 100,000 signatures to be presented to [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] to appoint a [[Queen's counsel]] to argue the case.&lt;ref name="T"/&gt; The purpose of the rally was to hand over a 100,000 signature memorandum to the [[British High Commission]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]].

HINDRAF organised the rally on Sunday, 25 November 2007 to submit the petition at the British [[High Commission]].

==Government roadblocks==
Malaysian police refused to grant a permit for the rally,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www5.malaysiakini.com/news/75027 |title=Malaysiakini (needs subscription) |access-date=6 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205220911/http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/75027 |archive-date=5 December 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and set up roadblocks in [[Klang Valley]] along roads leading up to the rally to screen motorists entering the city center and identify "troublemakers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.detikdaily.net/m3/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1204 |title=Detikdaily - Hindraf rally: Arrests, roadblocks will make it worse&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=6 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071125005115/http://www.detikdaily.net/m3/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1204 |archive-date=25 November 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also advised the public not to participate in the rally,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRxMhk9cD40|title=Hindraf rally: Cops warn of 'stern action'|work=YouTube|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and arrested three leaders of HINDRAF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEIE3N_DvXA|title=Another Hindraf lawyer arrested|work=YouTube|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many shops around Kuala Lumpur including [[Suria KLCC]] were closed on that day in fear of trouble from the rally.

One day before the rally, police arrested three HINDRAF lawyers, [[P. Uthayakumar]], [[P. Waytha Moorthy]] and V. Ganabatirau for sedition charges. Uthayakumar and Ganabatirau posted bail of 800 [[Malaysian ringgit]]s each, but Waytha Moorthy refused bail as a sign of protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=54188 |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603232003/http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=54188 |archive-date=3 June 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=6&amp;art_id=57494&amp;sid=16446487&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20071124&amp;fc=10 |title=China's Business Newspaper |publisher=The Standard |date= |accessdate=12 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916172221/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=6&amp;art_id=57494&amp;sid=16446487&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20071124&amp;fc=10 |archive-date=16 September 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianmalaysian.com/sound/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=777 |title=iMOL Archives - Hindraf: Let us hand petition and go home |publisher=Indianmalaysian.com |date= |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A House-Boat on the Styx''''' is a fantasy novel written by [[John Kendrick Bangs]] in 1895.

The original full title was ''A House-Boat on the Styx: Being Some Account of the Divers Doings of the Associated Shades''. The novel was first published by Harper Brothers in 1896 with illustrations by [[Peter Newell]] (24 plates).&lt;ref name=HDL&gt;[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001027045 Catalog record (New York: Harper, 1896)]. HathiTrust Digital Library. Retrieved 2016-08-04. &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; Contents and Illustrations, pp. v-viii, list 12 chapters and 24 plates. The illustrations are not credited but they are clearly signed by Peter Newell, the credited illustrator of the sequels.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==

The premise of the book is that everyone who has ever died (up to the time in which the book is set, which seems to be about the time of its publication) has gone to [[Styx (mythology)|Styx]], the river that circles the underworld.

The book begins with [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], ferryman of the Styx being startled&amp;mdash;and annoyed&amp;mdash;by the arrival of a [[houseboat]] on the Styx. At first afraid that the boat will put him out of business, he later finds out that he is actually to be appointed the boat's [[janitor]].

What follows are eleven more stories (for a total of twelve) which are set on the house boat. There is no central theme, and the purpose of the book appears to be as a literary [[thought experiment]] to see what would happen if various famous dead people were put in the same room with each other. Each chapter is a short story featuring various souls from history and mythology. In the twelfth chapter the house boat disappears, leading into the [[sequel]], ''[[The Pursuit of the House-Boat]]''.

==Notes==
''A House-Boat on the Styx'' appears to have no original fictional characters in it.  All are borrowed&amp;mdash;with varying degrees of licence&amp;mdash;from either history or mythology.

Bangs' idea of setting people in the afterlife (called [[Bangsian fantasy]] after his name) is quite similar to a book called ''[[God Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian]]'' by [[Kurt Vonnegut]].

Throughout the book, there is a running joke that Shakespeare didn't actually write any of his own plays, that they were actually ghostwritten by [[Sir Francis Bacon]], [[Sir Walter Raleigh]], and other contemporaries.  Will always tries to change the subject quickly when authorship comes into conversation.

''Heroes in Hell'', the first book in a series of [[fantasy]] short story collections by various authors, has a similar, albeit more modern, theme.

[[Philip José Farmer]]'s [[Riverworld]] series is similar in that the main characters are, for the most part, historical figures who are resurrected on a planet with one great river winding around it, and Farmer credited the book as one of his inspirations for the series.&lt;ref name="farmer1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=j7o9Cb-CzR8C&amp;pg=PA70#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Magic Labyrinth of Philip José Farmer], p. 70-71 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was on the ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' list of [[Publishers Weekly list of bestselling novels in the United States in the 1890s#1896|10 best-selling novels in the US, 1896]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9315">'''Address munging''' is the practice of disguising
an [[e-mail address]] to prevent it from being automatically collected by  unsolicited bulk e-mail providers. 
Address munging is intended to disguise an e-mail address in a way that prevents computer software from seeing the real address, or even any address at all, but still allows a human reader to reconstruct the original and contact the author: an email address such as, "&lt;nowiki&gt;no-one@example.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;", becomes "no-one at example dot com", for instance.

Any e-mail address posted in public is likely to be automatically collected by [[computer software]] used by bulk emailers (a process known as [[e-mail address harvesting|e-mail address scavenging]]). Addresses posted on [[webpage]]s, [[Usenet]] or [[chat rooms]] are particularly vulnerable to this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/alerts/spamalrt.htm Email Address Harvesting: How Spammers Reap What You Sow] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424083903/http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/alerts/spamalrt.htm |date=April 24, 2006 }}, Federal Trade Commission. URL accessed on 24 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Private e-mail sent between individuals is highly unlikely to be collected, but e-mail sent to a [[mailing list]] that is [[archive]]d and made available via the [[world wide web|web]], or passed onto a [[Usenet]] [[news server]] and made public, may eventually be scanned and collected.

==Disadvantages==
Disguising addresses makes it more difficult for people to send [[electronic mail|e-mail]] to each other. Many see it as an attempt to fix a symptom rather than solving the real problem of [[e-mail spam]], at the expense of causing problems for innocent users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interhack.net/pubs/munging-harmful/ Address Munging Considered Harmful], Matt Curtin&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are e-mail address harvesters who have found ways to read the munged email addresses.

The use of address munging on Usenet is contrary to the recommendations of RFC 1036 governing the format of Usenet posts, which requires a valid e-mail address be supplied in the From: field of the post. In practice, few people follow this recommendation strictly.&lt;ref&gt;See Usenet.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disguising e-mail addresses in a systematic manner (for example, user[at]domain[dot]com) offers little protection. For example, such addresses can be revealed through a simple [https://www.google.com/search?q=%22at+*+dot%22 Google Search].

Any impediment reduces the user's willingness to take the extra trouble to email the user. In contrast, well-maintained [[e-mail filtering]] on the user's end does not drive away potential correspondents. No spam filter is 100 percent immune to false positives, however, and the same potential correspondent that would have been deterred by address munging may instead end up wasting time on long letters that will merely disappear into junk mail folders.

For commercial entities, maintaining contact forms on web pages rather than publicizing e-mail addresses may be one way to ensure that incoming messages are relatively spam-free yet do not get lost. In conjunction with [[CAPTCHA]] fields, spam on such comment fields can be reduced to effectively zero, except that non-accessibility of CAPTCHAs bring exactly the same deterrent problems as address munging itself.

== Alternatives ==
As an alternative to address munging, there are several "transparent" techniques that allow people to post a valid e-mail address, but still make it difficult for automated recognition and collection of the address:

* "Transparent name mangling" involves replacing characters in the address with equivalent HTML references from the [[list of XML and HTML character entity references]], e.g. the '@' gets replaced by either 'U+0040' or '&amp;amp;#64; and the '.' gets replaced by either 'U+002E'or '&amp;amp;#46;' with the user knowing to take out the dashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crans.org/~raffo/email-munging.php|first=Daniele|last=Raffo|title=Email Munging|date=20 January 2015|accessdate=12 February 2015|website=Daniele Raffo}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Posting all or part of the e-mail address as an image,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hidden-email.com/ E-mail as an image]&lt;/ref&gt; for example, no-one[[File:At sign.svg|15px|@|link=]]example.com, where the at sign is disguised as an image, sometimes with the [[alt attribute|alternative text]] specified as "@" to allow copy-and-paste, but while altering the address to remain outside of typical [[regular expression]]s of spambots.
* Using a client-side form with the e-mail address as a CSS3 animated [[ASCII art|text logo]] captcha and shrinking it to normal size using inline [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://bugs.webkit.org/attachment.cgi?id=120792 Client-side contact form generator] (the generator requires JavaScript enabled, output for displaying emails requires [[Comparison of web browsers#Web technology support|CSS]])&lt;/ref&gt;
* Posting an e-mail address with the order of characters jumbled and restoring the order using CSS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bithack.se/pub/ PHP jumbler tool] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927091755/http://bithack.se/pub/ |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Building the link by [[client-side scripting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spamstop.org/spamtools/email JavaScript address script generator] (the generator requires [[HTTP cookie|cookies]] enabled, output for displaying emails requires [[Comparison of web browsers#JavaScript support|javascript]] enabled)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Using [[client-side scripting]] to produce a multi key email address encrypter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tonvanhattum.com.br/email_encrypter.php|first=Ton van|last=Hattum|title=Email Address on Your Site, SPAM Protection, Encrypting|date=13 March 2012|accessdate=22 February 2017|website=Ton van Hattum}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Using [[server-side scripting]] to run a contact form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.addressmunger.com/contact_form_generator PHP contact form generator]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of munging "&lt;nowiki&gt;user@example.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;" via client-side scripting would be:
&lt;source lang="javascript"&gt;
 &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
 var name = 'user';
 var at = '@';
 var domain = 'example.com';
 document.write(name + at + domain);
 &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
The use of images and scripts for address obfuscation can cause problems for people using [[screen reader]]s and users with disabilities,
and ignores users of text browsers like [[lynx (web browser)|lynx]] and [[w3m]], although being transparent means they don't disadvantage non-English speakers that cannot understand the plain text bound to a single language that is part of non-transparent munged addresses or instructions that accompany them.

According to a 2003 study by the [[Center for Democracy and Technology]], even the simplest "transparent name mangling" of e-mail addresses can be effective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spamhelp.org/articles/030319spamreport.pdf "Why Am I Getting All This Spam? Unsolicited Commercial E-mail Research Six Month Report" March 2003.] accessed 2016-09-12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdt.org/speech/spam/030319spamreport.shtml "Why Am I Getting All This Spam? Unsolicited Commercial E-mail Research Six Month Report" March 2003.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061218222622/http://www.cdt.org/speech/spam/030319spamreport.shtml |date=December 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Common methods of disguising addresses include:

{| class="wikitable"
!Disguised address
!Recovering the original address
|-
|no-one at example (dot) com
|Replace " at " with "@", and " (dot) " with "."
|-
|no-one@elpmaxe.com.invalid
|Reverse [[domain name]]: ''elpmaxe'' to ''example''&lt;br&gt;remove [[.invalid]]
|-
|moc.elpmaxe@eno-on
|Reverse the entire address
|-
|no-one@exampleREMOVEME.com
|Instructions in the address itself; remove REMOVEME.
|-
|no-one@exampleNOSPAM.com.invalid
|Remove NOSPAM and [[.invalid]] from the address.
|-
|n o - o n e @ e x a m p l e . c o m
|This is still readable, but the spaces between letters stop most automatic spambots.
|-
|no-one&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;@&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;example&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;com (as HTML)
|This is still readable and can be copied directly from webpages,&lt;br&gt;but stops many email harvesters.
|-
|''по-опе@ехатрlе.сот''
|Cannot be copied directly from Webpages, must be manually copied. All letters except l are [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] [[homoglyph]]s that are identical to Latin equivalents to the human eye but are perceived differently by most computers. (See also [[IDN homograph attack]] for more malicious use of this strategy.)
|}

The reserved [[top-level domain]] [[.invalid]] is appended to ensure that a real e-mail address is not inadvertently generated.

'''Anti-union violence''' is physical force intended to harm [[trade union|union]] officials, union organizers, union members, union sympathizers, or their families. It is most commonly used either during union organizing efforts, or during strikes. The aim most often is to prevent a union from forming, to destroy an existing union, or to reduce the effectiveness of a union or a particular strike action. If strikers prevent people or goods to enter or leave a workplace, violence may be used to allow people and goods to pass the picket line.

Violence against unions may be isolated, or may occur as part of a campaign that includes spying, [[intimidation]], impersonation, [[disinformation]], and [[sabotage]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Violence in [[labor unrest|labor disputes]] may be the result of unreasonable polarization, or miscalculation. It may be willful and provoked, or senseless and tragic. On some occasions, violence in labor disputes may be purposeful and calculated,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hunter, Violence and the labor movement, Macmillan, 1914 (1919 version), page 318&lt;/ref&gt; for example the hiring and deployment of [[goon squad]]s to assault strikers.

Incidents of violence during periods of labor unrest are sometimes perceived differently by different parties. It is sometimes a challenge to ascertain the truth about labor-related violence, and [[Union violence|incidents of violence committed by, or in the name of, unions or union workers have occurred]] as well.

== History ==

The practice of workers organizing, and meeting resistance for organizing, dates to antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;John Romer, ''Ancient Lives; the story of the Pharaoh's Tombmakers. London'': Phoenix Press, 1984, pp. 116-123 See also E.F. Wente, "A letter of complaint to the Vizier To", in ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'', 20, 1961 and W.F. Edgerton, "The strikes in Ramses III's Twenty-ninth year", ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'', 10, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first known individual killed by authorities for labor activities is likely Cinto Brandini, executed with nine others in 1345 Florence for attempting to organize woolcombers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James C. Docherty|first1=Sjaak van der Velden|title=Historical Dictionary of Organized Labor|date=2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=xxv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAdZaqTetVsC&amp;pg=PR25&amp;lpg=PR25|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study in 1969, the United States has had the bloodiest and most violent [[Labor history of the United States|labor history]] of any industrial nation in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taft and Philip Ross, "American Labor Violence: Its Causes, Character, and Outcome," The History of Violence in America: A Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, ed. Hugh Davis Graham and Ted Robert Gurr, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mass labor violence in the U.S. peaked in the early 20th century and has largely subsided since the 1940s.  But the deadly suppression of labor unions on a large scale persists into the new century, in the 2012 [[Marikana killings]] in South Africa, in the ongoing assassinations of [[Trade unions in Colombia|trade union members in Colombia]], and the South Korean government's response to [[Korean Confederation of Trade Unions]] protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Hyun|title=South Korea Labor Strikes Back|url=http://fpif.org/south-korean-labor-strikes-back/|accessdate=18 April 2016|publisher=Foreign Policy in Focus|date=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

Since unions are organized to achieve [[collective bargaining]] power to begin with, most union conflicts have been motivated primarily by economic issues (wages, working hours, safety conditions, work rules, etc.),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lalor|first1=John Joseph|title=Cyclopaedia of Political Science, Political Economy, and of the Political History of the United States, Volume 3|date=1890|publisher=C. E. Merrill &amp; Company|page=816|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K6g9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA816|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have engaged antagonists (employers, hired strikebreakers, replacement workers, local law enforcement) with economic goals in mind.  In some instances, however, other causes emerge.

===Race===

[[File:Randrebellion.png|right|thumb|French cartoon of the [[Rand Rebellion]] in South Africa, 1922]]

The 1887 [[Thibodaux massacre]] in [[Louisiana]], the 1899 [[Pana riot]] in southern [[Illinois]], and the 1911 [[Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway#1911 strike|Queen &amp; Crescent killings]] in [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]] are three examples of deliberate campaigns of murder against organized black workers in the American south, the first committed by landowners, the other two by white competitors.

In South Africa the 1922 [[Rand Rebellion]] also had underlying racial causes, taking on the slogan "''Workers of the world, unite and fight for a white South Africa!''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workmall.com/wfb2001/south_africa/south_africa_history_conflict_in_the_1920s.html|title=South Africa  Conflict in the 1920s - Flags, Maps, Economy, Geography, Climate, Natural Resources, Current Issues, International Agreements, Population, Social Statistics, Political System|work=workmall.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; before their strike grew to a small-scale rebellion at the cost of 200 lives.  The behavior of South African police in the [[1946 African Mine Workers' Union strike]] is said to have led to the formation of the [[Northern Rhodesian African Mineworkers' Union]] in 1949 as a cornerstone of the anti-apartheid movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The African Miners' Strike of 1946 |first=M. P. |last=Naicker |url=http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=4727l |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505153758/http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=4727l |archivedate=2016-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political power===

As with race, for some incidents there is no clear distinction between anti-union violence and political suppression.  Polish labor unions were centrally involved in workers’ uprisings and/or general strikes that challenged the sitting governments in [[Łódź insurrection (1905)|1905]], [[1923 Kraków riot|1923]], and [[1937 peasant strike in Poland|1937]].  In a similar way the [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934|strike of Asturian miners in 1934]], put down by right-wing Spanish government forces with great loss of life, amounted to an insurrection through work stoppage, not an economic labor action.   Unions continued to play a political and military role in the subsequent [[Spanish Civil War]].

Along with [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] in Spain, other totalitarian regimes in Europe brought their labor unions under government control, violently when necessary.  After coming to power as chancellor in January 1933, Adolf Hitler declared May Day a national holiday, then on May 2, 1933 unexpectedly moved to outlaw labor unions as part of the Nazi "[[Gleichschaltung|synchronization]]" process.   Major unions such as the [[Allgemeiner Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund]] were raided that day, their accounts seized, and their leaders (Gustav Schiefer, [[Wilhelm Leuschner]], Erich Luebbe) arrested and sent to concentration camps.  (The bodies of four murdered trade union officials in Duisburg were only found a year later, in April 1934.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gregor|first1=Neil|title=Nazism|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=296|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x9FFAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA296|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Every worker in the nation was then compelled to join the single party-controlled union, the [[German Labour Front]].  Similar coercive violence was exercised against labor unions in conquered nations, as in the Netherlands in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warmbrunn|first1=Werner|title=The Dutch Under German Occupation, 1940-1945|date=1963|publisher=Stanford University Press|page=136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ykWfAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA136|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of violence ==

Some anti-union violence appears to be random, such as an incident during the [[1912 Lawrence Textile Strike|1912 textile strike]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], in which a police officer fired into a crowd of strikers, killing [[Anna LoPizzo]].&lt;ref&gt;William Dudley Haywood, Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, 1929, page 249&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-union violence may be used as a means to intimidate others, as in the [[Frank Little (unionist)|hanging of union organizer Frank Little]] from a railroad trestle in [[Butte, Montana]]. A note was pinned to his body which said, "Others Take Notice! First And Last Warning!" The initial of the last names of seven well-known union activists in the Butte area were on the note, with the "L" for Frank Little circled.&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, pages 223-224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Carlson, Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, 1983, pages 17, 248-249&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-union violence may be abrupt and unanticipated. Three years after Frank Little was lynched, a strike by Butte miners was suppressed with gunfire when deputized mine guards suddenly fired upon unarmed picketers in the [[Anaconda Road Massacre]]. Seventeen were shot in the back as they tried to flee, and one man died.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Murphy, Mining cultures: men, women, and leisure in Butte, 1914-41, University of Illinois Press, 1997, page 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Other anti-union violence may seem orchestrated, as in 1914 when mine guards and the state militia fired into a tent colony of striking miners in Colorado, an incident that came to be known as the [[Ludlow Massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, H. "The Ludlow Massacre", A People's History of the United States. pgs 346–349&lt;/ref&gt; During that strike, the company hired the Baldwin Felts agency, which built an armored car so their agents could approach the strikers' tent colonies with impunity. The strikers called it the "Death Special". At the Forbes tent colony,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[The Death Special] opened fire, a protracted spurt that sent some six hundred bullets tearing through the thin tents. One of the shots struck miner Luka Vahernik, fifty, in the head, killing him instantly. Another striker, Marco Zamboni, eighteen ... suffered nine bullet wounds to his legs... One tent was later found to have about 150 bullet holes..."&lt;ref&gt;Scott Martelle, Blood Passion, Rutgers University Press, 2008, page 98&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sometimes, there is simultaneous violence on both sides. In an auto workers strike organised by [[Victor G. Reuther|Victor Reuther]] and others in 1937, "[u]nionists assembled rocks, steel hinges, and other objects to throw at the cops, and police organized [[tear gas]] attacks and mounted charges."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Lichtenstein, Walter Reuther: the most dangerous man in Detroit, University of Illinois Press, 1997, page 101&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been cases where violence has been perpetrated or encouraged by agents of management, intending it to be blamed on the union.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hunter, Violence and the labor movement, Macmillan, 1914 (1919 version), page 317&lt;/ref&gt;

== Violence by country ==

=== Europe ===

[[File:Strike in Brussels.jpg|thumb|upright|Depiction of the 1902 Belgium general strike, by Henri Meurnier]]

;Belgium
* the [[Belgian general strike of 1902]] was led by the coal miners of [[Liège (province)|Liège]], lasting 10 to 20 days and killing about 12

;Russia

;United Kingdom
* on 17 May 1869, a labor action of Welsh colliers (forcibly delivering the mine's new operator to the police station) developed into [[Mold, Flintshire#The Mold Riot|The Mold Riot]], a confrontation between a mob of 1500 workers and citizens, versus [[King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster)|King's Own Royal Regiment]].  When pelted with stones, the King's Own fired into the crowd, killing four

;United States
{{main|Anti-union violence in the United States}}{{See also|List of worker deaths in United States labor disputes}}

Historically, violence against unions in the United States has included attacks by detective and guard agencies, such as the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkertons]], [[Baldwin–Felts Detective Agency|Baldwin Felts]], [[William J. Burns International Detective Agency|Burns]], or [[Thiel Detective Service Company|Thiel]] detective agencies; citizens groups, such as the [[Citizens' Alliance]]; company guards; police; national guard; or even the military.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''From Blackjacks To Briefcases'', Robert Michael Smith states that during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, anti-union agencies "spawned violence and wreaked havoc" on the labor movement.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Morris Friedman]], detective agencies were themselves for-profit companies, and a "bitter struggle" between capital and labor could be counted upon to create "satisfaction and immense profit" for agencies such as the Pinkerton company.&lt;ref&gt;The Pinkerton Labor Spy, Morris Friedman, Wilshire Book Company, 1907, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Wellington Laidler wrote a book in 1913 detailing how one of the largest union busters in the United States, [[Corporations Auxiliary Company]], had a sales pitch offering the use of provocation and violence.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Wellington Laidler, Boycotts and the labor struggle economic and legal aspects, John Lane company, 1913, pages 291-292&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Lattimer massacre]], nineteen unarmed immigrant coal miners were suddenly gunned down at the Lattimer mine near [[Hazleton, Pennsylvania]], on September 10, 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, John W. ''Transitions: From Eastern Europe to Anthracite Community to College Classroom.'' Bloomington, Ind.: iUniverse, 2005. {{ISBN|0-595-33732-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Randall M. and Pencak, William. ''Pennsylvania: A History of the Commonwealth.'' State College, Penn.: Penn State Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-271-02214-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Colorado Labor Wars]], martial law was imposed by the Colorado National Guard in order to put down striking miners. A study of industrial violence in 1969 concluded, "There is no episode in American labor history in which violence was as systematically used by employers as in the Colorado labor war of 1903 and 1904."&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taft and Philip Ross, "American Labor Violence: Its Causes, Character, and Outcome," The History of Violence in America: A Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, ed. Hugh Davis Graham and Ted Robert Gurr, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, mine guards and the state militia fired into a tent colony of striking miners in Colorado, an incident that came to be known as the [[Ludlow Massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, H. "The Ludlow Massacre", A People's History of the United States. pgs 346–349&lt;/ref&gt; During that strike, the company hired the Baldwin Felts agency, which built an armored car so their agents could approach the strikers' tent colonies with impunity. The strikers called it the "Death Special". In 1917, [[Frank Little (unionist)|union organizer Frank Little]] was hanged from a railroad trestle in [[Butte, Montana]], with a note pinned to his body which carried a "warning" to other labor activists.&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, pages 223-224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Carlson, Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, 1983, pages 17, 248-249&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, during another coal strike in [[Colorado]], state police and mine guards fired pistols, rifles and a machine gun into a group of five hundred striking miners and their wives in what came to be called the [[Columbine Mine massacre|Columbine Mine Massacre]].

By the early 1900s, public tolerance for violence during labor disputes began to decrease. Yet violence involving strikebreaking troops and armed guards continued into the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; Legislation related to employer strategies such as violent strike breaking would have to wait until after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1950s, employers began to embrace new methods of managing workers and unions which were still effective, but much more subtle.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Canada
* With casualties as one indication of its national history, a union pamphlet published in 2006 counted a total of 24 "Canadian Labour Martyrs" since 1903, a number that includes Joseph Mairs of the Vancouver Island War of 1912-14, coal miner [[Albert Goodwin]] killed in 1918, miner [[William Davis (miner)|Bill Davis]] of Nova Scotia (namesake of the [[William Davis Miners' Memorial Day]]), and the 1929 case of [[Rosvall and Voutilainen]] in [[Thunder Bay, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Pamphlet of Canadian Labour Martyrs|url=http://iww.ca/?p=225|website=International Workers of the World Canada|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Rosvall and Voutilainen were murdered for their pro-union efforts resulting in the authorities in Thunder Bay conducting a major cover up in an attempt to conceal the truth.  Thunder Bay remains a hot bed of anti-union violence against pro-union individuals resulting in Thunder Bay being labelled the Capital of Anti-union Violence of Canada.

;Mexico
* the [[Cananea strike]] of organized mine workers in June 1906, and the [[Río Blanco strike]] of unionized textile workers in January 1907, became two linked symbols of the corruption and civil repression of the administration of Mexican president [[Porfirio Díaz]].  They became "household words for hundreds of thousands of Mexicans".&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of Latin America, by Leslie Bethell, Cambridge University Press, 1986, page 66&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central and South America ===

;Argentina
* approximately 1,500 striking rural workers were shot and killed by the [[Argentine Army]] in the [[Patagonia Rebelde|Patagonia Uprising]] between 1920 and 1922

;Bolivia
* government forces killed at least 19 striking mine workers in the [[Catavi Massacre]] of December 1942; the workers themselves counted 400 dead
* popular protests against the November 1, 1979 ''coup d'état'' of [[Alberto Natusch Busch]], protests led by the [[Central Obrera Boliviana]] (COB) trade union confederation, were met with [[All Saints' massacre|violence from the military]].  Perhaps 100 were killed, but the new government was overthrown within two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Asociación de Familiares de Detenidos Desaparecidos y Mártires por la Liberación Nacional (Bolivia), Fundación Solón, and Capítulo Boliviano de Derechos Humanos, Democracia y Desarrollo. ''Informe sobre las desapariciones forzadas en Bolivia''. La Paz: ASOFAMD, 2008. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

;Chile
* the [[Santa María School massacre]] was a [[massacre]] of striking nitrate miners, with wives and children, committed by the [[Chilean Army]] in [[Iquique]], [[Chile]] on December 21, 1907.  The number of victims has been estimated at 2,000

Ernie Abbott, the building's caretaker, was killed when he attempted to move the suitcase, which is believed to have contained three sticks of [[gelignite]] triggered by a [[mercury switch]].&lt;ref&gt;Minchin, William (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; To this day, the perpetrator has never been identified. Those elements of the New Zealand Police responsible for preventing and investigating such crimes were headquartered in the building across the street.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4217">In [[mathematical logic]], an '''axiom schema''' (plural: '''axiom schemata''' or '''axiom schemas''') generalizes the notion of [[axiom]].

==Formal definition==
An axiom schema is a [[well-formed formula|formula]] in the [[metalanguage]] of an [[axiomatic system]], in which one or more [[schematic variable]]s appear. These variables, which are metalinguistic constructs, stand for any [[First-order logic#Formation rules|term]] or [[first-order logic|subformula]] of the system, which may or may not be required to satisfy certain conditions. Often, such conditions require that certain variables be [[free variable|free]], or that certain variables not appear in the subformula or term{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}.

==Finite axiomatization==
Given that the number of possible subformulas or terms that can be inserted in place of a schematic variable is [[countably infinite]], an axiom schema stands for a countably infinite set of axioms. This set can usually be [[recursive definition|defined recursively]]. A theory that can be axiomatized without schemata is said to be ''finitely axiomatized''. Theories that can be finitely axiomatized are seen as a bit more metamathematically elegant, even if they are less practical for deductive work.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Examples==
Two very well known instances of axiom schemata are the:
* [[mathematical induction|induction]] schema that is part of [[Peano's axioms]] for the arithmetic of the [[natural number]]s;
* [[axiom schema of replacement]] that is part of the standard [[ZFC]] axiomatization of [[set theory]].
[[Czesław Ryll-Nardzewski]] proved that Peano arithmetic cannot be finitely axiomatized and [[Richard Montague]] proved that ZFC cannot be finitely axiomatized.&lt;ref&gt;Czesław Ryll-Nardzewski 1952; Richard Montague 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the axiom schemata cannot be eliminated from these theories. This is also the case for quite a few other axiomatic theories in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, etc.

==Finitely axiomatized theories==
All theorems of [[ZFC]] are also theorems of [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]], but the latter can be finitely axiomatized. The set theory [[New Foundations]] can be finitely axiomatized, but only with some loss of elegance.

==In higher-order logic==
Schematic variables in [[first-order logic]] are usually trivially eliminable in [[second-order logic]], because a schematic variable is often a placeholder for any [[property]] or [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] over the individuals of the theory. This is the case with the schemata of ''Induction'' and ''Replacement'' mentioned above. Higher-order logic allows quantified variables to range over all possible properties or relations.

A '''bathymetric chart''' is the submerged equivalent of an above-water [[topographic map]]. Bathymetric charts are designed to present accurate, measurable description and visual presentation of the submerged terrain. 

In an ideal case, the joining of a bathymetric chart and topographic map of the same [[Scale (measurement)|scale]] and [[Map projection|projection]] of the same geographic area would be seamless. The only difference would be that the values begin increasing after crossing the zero at the designated [[sea level]] [[datum (geodesy)|datum]]. Thus the topographic map's [[mountain]]s have the greatest values while the bathymetric chart's greatest depths have the greatest values. Simply put, the bathymetric chart is intended to show the land if overlying waters were removed in exactly the same manner as the topographic map.

A bathymetric chart differs from a [[Hydrography|hydrographic]] chart in that accurate presentation of the underwater features is the goal while safe [[navigation]] is the requirement for the hydrographic chart. A [[hydrographic chart]] will obscure the actual features to present a simplified version to aid [[sailor|mariners]] in avoiding underwater hazards.

Bathymetric surveys are a [[subset]] of the science of [[hydrography]]. They differ slightly from the [[Hydrographic survey|survey]]s required to produce the product of hydrography in its more limited application and as conducted by the national and international agencies tasked with producing [[chart]]s and [[publication]]s for safe navigation. That chart product is more accurately termed a navigation or hydrographic chart with a strong bias toward the presentation of essential safety information. 

Bathymetric surveys and charts are more closely tied to the science of [[oceanography]], particularly [[marine geology]], and [[underwater engineering]] or other specialized purposes.

Bathymetric charts can also be converted to [[topographic profile|bathymetric profiles]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5937">In [[category theory]], a branch of mathematics, a (left) '''Bousfield localization''' of a [[model category]] replaces the model structure with another model structure with the same cofibrations but with more weak equivalences.

Bousfield localization is named after [[Aldridge Bousfield]], who first introduced this technique in the context of localization of topological spaces and spectra.&lt;ref&gt;Aldridge Bousfield, ''[http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/math/MAT9580/v12/undervisningsmateriale/bousfield-topology-1979.pdf The localization of spectra with respect to homology]'', Topology vol 18 (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aldridge Bousfield, ''The localization of spaces with respect to homology'', Topology vol. 14 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model category structure of the Bousfield localization==
Given a [[class (mathematics)|class]] ''C'' of morphisms in a model category ''M'' the left Bousfield localization is a new model structure on the same category as before. Its equivalences, cofibrations and fibrations, respectively, are
* the ''C''-local equivalences
* the original cofibrations of ''M''
and (necessarily, since cofibrations and weak equivalences determine the fibrations)
* the maps having the [[right lifting property]] with respect to the cofibrations in ''M'' which are also ''C''-local equivalences.
In this definition, a ''C''-local equivalence is a map &lt;math&gt;f: X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; which, roughly speaking, does not make a difference when mapping to a ''C''-local object. More precisely, &lt;math&gt;f^* : map (Y, W) \to map (X, W)&lt;/math&gt;
is required to be a weak equivalence (of [[simplicial set]]s) for any ''C''-local object ''W''. An object ''W'' is called ''C''-local if it is fibrant (in ''M'') and 
:&lt;math&gt;s^* : map (B, W) \to map (A, W)&lt;/math&gt;
is a weak equivalence for ''all'' maps &lt;math&gt;f: A \to B&lt;/math&gt; in ''C''. The notation &lt;math&gt;map(-, -)&lt;/math&gt; is, for a general model category (not necessarily [[enriched category|enriched]] over simplicial sets) a certain simplicial set whose set of [[path component]]s agrees with morphisms in the [[homotopy category]] of ''M'':
:&lt;math&gt;\pi_0 (map(X, Y)) = Hom_{Ho(M)}(X, Y).&lt;/math&gt;
If ''M'' is a simplicial model category (such as, say, simplicial sets or topological spaces), then "map" above can be taken to be the derived simplicial mapping space of ''M''.

This description does not make any claim about the existence of this model structure, for which see below.

Dually, there is a notion of ''right Bousfield localization'', whose definition is obtained by replacing cofibrations by fibrations (and reversing directions of all arrows).

==Existence==
The left Bousfield localization model structure, as described above, is known to exist in various situations, provided that ''C'' is a set:
* ''M'' is left proper (i.e., the pushout of a weak equivalence along a cofibration is again a weak equivalence) and combinatorial
* ''M'' is left proper and cellular.
Combinatoriality and cellularity of a model category guarantee, in particular, a strong control over the cofibrations of ''M''.

Similarly, the right Bousfield localization exists if ''M'' is right proper and cellular or combinatorial and C is a set.

==Universal property==
The [[localization of a category|localization]] &lt;math&gt;C[W^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt; of an (ordinary) category ''C'' with respect to a class ''W'' of morphisms satisfies the following universal property:
* There is a functor &lt;math&gt;C \to C[W^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt; which sends all morphisms in ''W'' to isomorphisms.
* Any functor &lt;math&gt;C \to D&lt;/math&gt; that sends ''W'' to isomorphisms in ''D'' factors uniquely over the previously mentioned functor.

The Bousfield localization is the appropriate analogous notion for model categories, keeping in mind that isomorphisms in ordinary category theory are replaced by weak equivalences. That is, the (left) Bousfield localization &lt;math&gt;L_C M&lt;/math&gt; is such that
* There is a [[Quillen adjunction|left Quillen]] functor &lt;math&gt;M \to L_C M&lt;/math&gt; whose left derived functor sends all morphisms in ''C'' to weak equivalences.
* Any left Quillen functor &lt;math&gt;M \to N&lt;/math&gt; whose left derived functor sends ''C'' to weak equivalences factors uniquely through &lt;math&gt;M\to L_C M&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==

===Localization and completion of a spectrum===
Localization and completion of a spectrum at a prime number ''p'' are both examples of Bousfield localization, resulting in a [[local spectrum]]. For example, localizing the [[sphere spectrum]] ''S'' at ''p'', one obtains a [[local sphere]] &lt;math&gt;S_{(p)}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Stable model structure on spectra===
The [[stable homotopy category]] is the homotopy category (in the sense of model categories) of spectra, endowed with the stable model structure. The stable model structure is obtained as a left Bousfield localization of the level (or projective) model structure on spectra, whose weak equivalences (fibrations) are those maps which are weak equivalences (fibrations, respectively) in all levels.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hovey, ''[http://www.math.uiuc.edu/K-theory/0402/ Spectra and symmetric spectra in general model categories]'', Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra 165 (2001), section 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morita model structure on dg categories===
Morita model structure on the category of small dg categories is Bousfield localization of the standard model structure (the one for which the weak equivalences are the quasi-equivalences).

'''Brainwashing''' (also known as '''mind control''', '''menticide''', '''coercive persuasion''',  '''thought control''', '''thought reform''', and '''re-education''') is the concept that the [[human mind]] can be altered or controlled by certain [[psychological]] techniques. Brainwashing is said to reduce its subject’s ability to [[think]] critically or independently,&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Religion, Volume 2, Gyan Publishing House, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; to allow the introduction of new, unwanted thoughts and ideas into the subject’s mind,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell's Psychiatric Dictionary, Robert Jean Campbell, Oxford University Press, USA, 2004, page 403&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to change his or her attitudes, values, and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;The Dictionary of Psychology, Raymond J. Corsini, Psychology Press, 2002, page 127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kowal, D. M. (2000). Brainwashing. In A. E. LOVE (Ed.), Encyclopedia of psychology, vol. 1 (pp. 463-464). American Psychological Association. {{DOI|10.1037/10516-173}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The concept of brainwashing was originally developed in the 1950s to explain how the [[Chinese government]] appeared to make people cooperate with them. Advocates of the concept also looked at [[Nazi Germany]], at some criminal cases in the United States, and at the actions of [[Human trafficking|human traffickers]]. It was later applied by [[Margaret Singer]], [[Philip Zimbardo]] and some others in the [[anti-cult movement]] to explain conversions to some [[new religious movement]]s and other groups. This resulted in [[scientific]] and [[legal]] debate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Stuart|title=Media Coverage of Unconventional Religion: Any "Good News" for Minority Faiths?|journal=Review of Religious Research|date=December 1997|volume=39|issue=2|pages=101–115|doi=10.2307/3512176|jstor=3512176}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Eileen Barker]], [[James Richardson (sociologist)|James Richardson]], and other scholars, as well as legal experts, rejecting at least the popular understanding of brainwashing.&lt;ref name="Melton"&gt;{{cite web |first=J.

Other views have been expressed by scholars including: [[Dick Anthony]], [[Robert Cialdini]], [[Stanley A. Deetz]], [[Michael J. Freeman]], [[Robert Jay Lifton]],  [[Joost Meerloo]], [[Daniel Romanovsky]], [[Kathleen Taylor (biologist)|Kathleen Taylor]], [[Louis Jolyon West]], and [[Benjamin Zablocki]]. The concept of brainwashing is sometimes involved in legal cases, especially regarding [[child custody]]; and is also a major theme in [[science fiction]] and in criticism of modern [[political]] and  [[corporate culture]].  Although the term appears in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) of the American Psychiatric Association&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/DSM-5|title=DSM-5|last=American Psychiatric Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is not accepted as [[scientific fact]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = New Religious Movements: Challenge and Response|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bvem38QO9y0C|publisher = Routledge|date = 2012-12-06|isbn = 9781134636969|language = en|first = Frank|last = Usarski|page = 238|quote = ...there has been until now a lack of any convincing scientific evidence which can be applied in a generalised form to show that involvement in a New Religious Movement has any destructive consequences for the psyche of the individual concerned. ...

For example, {{lang|zh-Latn|[[:zh:心脏病|xīn zàng bìng]]}} means [[Cardiovascular disease]], but {{lang|zh-Latn|[[:zh:心理医生|xīn lǐ yī shēng]]}} means [[psychologist]], and {{lang|zh-Latn|[[:zh:市中心|shì zhōng xīn]]}} means [[Central business district]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' records the earliest known English-language usage of the word "brainwashing" in an article by newspaperman [[Edward Hunter (U.S. journalist)|Edward Hunter]], in ''Miami News'', published on 24 September 1950. Hunter was an outspoken [[Anti-communism|anticommunist]] and was said to be a [[CIA]] agent working undercover as a journalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marks |first=John |authorlink=John D.

The U.S. military and government laid charges of brainwashing in an effort to undermine  confessions made by POWs to war crimes, including [[Allegations of biological warfare in the Korean War|biological warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Endicott and Edward Hagerman, ''The United States and Biological Warfare: Secrets From the Early Cold War'' (Indiana University Press, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; After Chinese radio broadcasts claimed to quote [[Frank Schwable]], Chief of Staff of the [[1st Marine Aircraft Wing|First Marine Air Wing]] admitting to participating in germ warfare, United Nations commander Gen. [[Mark W. Clark]] asserted:&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1953/02/24/93602632.pdf "Clark Denounces Germ War Charges", 24 February 1953], accessed 16 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Whether these statements ever passed the lips of these unfortunate men is doubtful. If they did, however, too familiar are the mind-annihilating methods of these Communists in extorting whatever words they want .... The men themselves are not to blame, and they have my deepest sympathy for having been used in this abominable way.''

Beginning in 1953, [[Robert Jay Lifton]] interviewed American servicemen who had been POWs during the [[Korean War]] as well as priests, students, and teachers who had been held in prison in China after 1951. In addition to interviews with 25 Americans and Europeans, Lifton interviewed 15 Chinese citizens who had fled after having been subjected to indoctrination in Chinese universities.

In [[George Orwell]]'s 1949 [[dystopian]] novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' the main character is subjected to imprisonment, isolation, and torture in order to conform his thoughts and emotions to the wishes of the rulers of Orwell's fictional future [[totalitarian]] society. Orwell's vision influenced Hunter and is still reflected in the popular understanding of the concept of brainwashing.&lt;ref&gt;Psychiatry and Public Affairs, Leo H.

In the 1950s many American films were filmed that featured brainwashing of POWs, including ''[[The Rack (film)|The Rack]]'', ''[[The Bamboo Prison]]'', ''[[Toward the Unknown]]'', and ''[[The Fearmakers]]''. ''[[Forbidden Area]]'' told the story of Soviet secret agents who had been brainwashed through [[classical conditioning]] by their own government so they wouldn't reveal their identities. In 1962 ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (based on the 1959 novel by [[Richard Condon]]) "put brainwashing front and center" by featuring a plot by the Soviet government to take over the United States by use of a brainwashed presidential candidate.&lt;ref&gt;''Screen Enemies of the American Way: Political Paranoia About Nazis, Communists, Saboteurs, Terrorists and Body Snatching Aliens in Film and Television'', Fraser A.

Mind control remains an important theme in [[science fiction]]. Terry O'Brien comments: "Mind control is such a powerful image that if [[hypnotism]] did not exist, then something similar would have to have been invented: the plot device is too useful for any writer to ignore. The fear of mind control is equally as powerful an image."&lt;ref&gt;Terry O'Brien in ''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders, Volume 1'', Gary Westfahl editor, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; A subgenre is ''corporate mind control'', in which a future society is run by one or more business [[corporations]] that dominate society using [[advertising]] and [[mass media]] to control the population's thoughts and feelings.&lt;ref&gt;Per Schelde, ''Androids, Humanoids, and Other Science Fiction Monsters: Science and Soul in Science Fiction Films'', NYU Press, 1 July 1994, pages 169-175&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal and civil cases==
In 1974, [[Patty Hearst]], a member of the wealthy [[William Randolph Hearst|Hearst family]], was [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] by a left-wing group calling itself the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]]. After several weeks of captivity she agreed to join the group and took part in their activities.  In 1975, she was arrested and charged with bank robbery and use of a gun in committing a felony.  Her attorney, [[F. Lee Bailey]] argued in her trial  that she should not be held responsible for her actions since her treatment by her captors was the equivalent of the brainwashing of Korean War POWs. (See: [[diminished responsibility]].)  Hearst was found guilty, but her “brainwashing defense” brought the topic to renewed public attention in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Regulating Religion: Case Studies from Around the Globe, James T. Richardson, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, Dec 6, 2012, page 518&lt;/ref&gt; as did the 1969 to 1971 case of [[Charles Manson]], who was said to have brainwashed his followers to commit murder and other crimes.&lt;ref&gt;''Minds on Trial: Great Cases in Law and Psychology'', by Charles Patrick Ewing, Joseph T.

Bailey developed his case in conjunction with psychiatrist [[Louis Jolyon West]] and psychologist [[Margaret Singer]].  They had both studied the experiences of  Korean War POWs. In 1996 Singer published her theories in her best-selling book ''[[Cults in Our Midst]]''.&lt;ref name="refocus.org"&gt;[http://www.refocus.org/singerne.html ''Cults in Our Midst: The Continuing Fight Against Their Hidden Menace''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202034934/http://www.refocus.org/singerne.html |date=2 February 2015 }}, Margaret Thaler Singer, Jossey-Bass, publisher, April 2003, {{ISBN|0-7879-6741-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "clarke"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DouBAgAAQBAJ|title=Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements|isbn=9781134499700|last1=Clarke|first1=Peter|last2=Clarke|first2=Reader in Modern History Fellow Peter|date=March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/09/us/louis-j-west-74-psychiatrist-who-studied-extremes-dies.html|title=Louis J.

[[Italy]] has had controversy over the concept of ''[[plagio]]'', a crime consisting in an absolute psychological—and eventually physical—domination of a person. The effect is said to be the annihilation of the subject's [[freedom]] and [[self-determination]] and the consequent negation of his or her [[personality]]. The crime of plagio has rarely been prosecuted in Italy, and only one person was ever convicted. In 1981, an Italian court found that the concept is imprecise, lacks coherence, and is liable to arbitrary application.&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Usai “Profili penali dei condizionamenti mentali, Milano, 1996 {{ISBN|88-14-06071-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the twenty-first century, the concept of brainwashing was being applied "with some success" in  [[child custody]] and [[child sexual abuse]] cases.

In 2003, forensic psychologist [[Dick Anthony]] said that "no reasonable person would question that there are situations where people can be influenced against their best interests, but those arguments are evaluated on the basis of fact, not bogus expert testimony."&lt;ref name="Oldenburg"/&gt;  In 2016, Israeli anthropologist of religion and fellow at the [[Van Leer Jerusalem Institute]] Adam Klin-Oron said about then-proposed "anti-cult" legislation: 
:''In the 1980s there was a wave of ‘brainwashing’ claims, and then parliaments around the world examined the issue, courts around the world examined the issue, and reached a clear ruling: That there is no such thing as cults…that the people making these claims are often not experts on the issue. And in the end courts, including in Israel, rejected expert witnesses who claimed there is "brainwashing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/will-israels-first-anti-cult-legislation-harm-religious-freedom], ''[[Times of Israel]]&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;''&lt;/ref&gt;''

It is neither magical nor mystical, but a process that involves a set of basic social psychological principles. Conformity, compliance, persuasion, dissonance, reactance, guilt and fear arousal, modeling and identification are some of the staple social influence ingredients well studied in psychological experiments and field studies. In some combinations, they create a powerful crucible of extreme mental and behavioral [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] when synthesized with several other real-world factors, such as charismatic, authoritarian leaders, dominant ideologies, social isolation, physical debilitation, induced phobias, and extreme threats or promised rewards that are typically deceptively orchestrated, over an extended time period in settings where they are applied intensively. A body of social science evidence shows that when systematically practiced by state-sanctioned police, military or destructive cults, mind control can induce false confessions, create converts who willingly torture or kill 'invented enemies,' and engage indoctrinated members to work tirelessly, give up their money—and even their lives—for 'the cause.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he suggested that any human being is susceptible to such manipulation.&lt;ref name="Zimbardo 1997 14"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zimbardo |first=P |authorlink=Philip Zimbardo |url= http://www.csj.org/studyindex/studycult/study_zimbar.htm |page=14 |title=What messages are behind today's cults? |journal=Monitor on Psychology |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another adherent to this view, Jean-Marie Abgrall was heavily criticized by forensic psychologist Dick Anthony for employing a [[pseudo-scientific]] approach and lacking any evidence that anyone's [[worldview]] was substantially changed by these coercive methods.

Barker’s extensive enumerations showed that among the recruits who went so far as to attend two-day retreats (claimed to beMoonie’s most effective means of "brainwashing"), fewer than 25% joined the group for more than a week and only 5% remained full-time members one year later. And, of course, most contacts dropped out before attending a retreat. Of all those who visited a Moonie centre at least once, not one in two-hundred remained in the movement two years later.

===American Psychological Association on brainwashing===
{{Main article|APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Techniques of Persuasion and Control}}
In 1983, the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) asked Singer to chair a [[taskforce]] called the APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Techniques of Persuasion and Control (DIMPAC) to investigate whether brainwashing or coercive persuasion did indeed play a role in recruitment by NRMs.
&lt;ref&gt;
As archived at http://www.cesnur.org/testi/DIMPAC.htm, retrieved 2008-06-23
&lt;/ref&gt; It came to the following conclusion:&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Cults and [[large group awareness training]]s have generated considerable controversy because of their widespread use of deceptive and indirect techniques of persuasion and control. These techniques can compromise individual freedom, and their use has resulted in serious harm to thousands of individuals and families. This report reviews the literature on this subject, proposes a new way of conceptualizing influence techniques, explores the ethical ramifications of deceptive and indirect techniques of persuasion and control, and makes recommendations addressing the problems described in the report.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 11 May 1987, the APA's Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology (BSERP) rejected the DIMPAC report because the report "lacks the scientific rigor and evenhanded critical approach necessary for APA imprimatur", and concluded that "after much consideration, BSERP does not believe that we have sufficient information available to guide us in taking a position on this issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cesnur.org/testi/APA.htm |title=Memorandum |accessdate=2008-11-18 |author=American Psychological Association Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology (BSERP) |date=1987-05-11 |work=CESNUR: APA Memo of 1987 with Enclosures |publisher=CESNUR Center for Studies on New Religion |quote=BSERP thanks the Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control for its service but is unable to accept the report of the Task Force.

Russian historian [[Daniel Romanovsky]], who interviewed survivors and eyewitnesses in the 1970s, reported on what he called "[[Nazi]] brainwashing" of the people of [[Belarus]] by the occupying Germans during the [[Second World War]], which took place through both mass [[propaganda]] and intense re-education, especially in schools. Romanovsky noted that very soon most people had adopted the Nazi view that the Jews were an inferior race and were closely tied to the [[Soviet]] government, views that had not been at all common before the German occupation.&lt;ref&gt;''Nazi Europe and the Final Solution'', David Bankier, Israel Gutman, Berghahn Books, 2009, page 282-285.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gray Zones: Ambiguity and Compromise in the Holocaust and its Aftermath, Jonathan Petropoulos, John Roth, Berghahn Books, Jul 15, 2005, page 209&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Minsk Ghetto 1941-1943: Jewish Resistance and Soviet Internationalism, Barbara Epstein, University of California Press, 2008, page 295&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bringing the Dark Past to Light: The Reception of the Holocaust in Postcommunist Europe, John-Paul Himka, Joanna Beata Michlic, University of Nebraska Press, Jul 1, 2013, pages 74, 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/sc3/soviet_jews_exodus/English/Interview_s/InterviewRomanovsky.shtml Interview]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oU6WielZ_VoC&amp;pg=PA276#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=The Soviet Person as a Bystander of the Holocaust: The case of eastern Belorussia|first=Daniel|last=Romanovsky|page=276|title=Nazi Europe and the Final Solution|editor-first=David|editor-last=Bankier|editor2-first=Israel|editor2-last=Gutman|year=2009|publisher=Berghahn Books}}

[[Joost Meerloo]], a Dutch psychiatrist, was an early proponent of the concept of brainwashing. ("Menticide" is a [[neologism]] coined by him meaning: "killing of the mind.") Meerloo's view was influenced by his experiences during the German occupation of his country and his work with the Dutch government and the American military in the [[interrogation]] of accused [[Nazi war criminals]]. He later emigrated to the United States and taught at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Propaganda Studies, Jonathan Auerbach, Russ Castronovo, Oxford University Press, 2014, page 114&lt;/ref&gt; His best-selling 1956 book, ''The Rape of the Mind'', concludes by saying: 
:''The modern techniques of brainwashing and menticide—those perversions of psychology—can bring almost any man into submission and surrender. Many of the victims of thought control, brainwashing, and menticide that we have talked about were strong men whose minds and wills were broken and degraded. But although the totalitarians use their knowledge of the mind for vicious and unscrupulous purposes, our democratic society can and must use its knowledge to help man to grow, to guard his freedom, and to understand himself.'' &lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite web |author= [[Joost Meerloo|Meerloo, Joost]] |url=http://www.lermanet.com/scientology/mc-ch1.html |title=''The Rape of the Mind: The Psychology of Thought Control, Menticide, and Brainwashing'' |year=1956 |publisher=World Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have said that modern [[business corporation]]s practice mind control to create a work force that shares common values and culture.&lt;ref&gt;''Exploring Leadership: Individual, Organizational, and Societal Perspectives'', Richard Bolden, Beverley Hawkins, Jonathan Gosling, Scott Taylor, Oxford University Press, 30 June 2011, page 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have linked "corporate brainwashing" with [[globalization]], saying that corporations are attempting to create a worldwide [[Cultural homogenization|monocultural]] network of producers, consumers, and managers.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rise of the Anti-corporate Movement: Corporations and the People who Hate Them'', Evan Osborne, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; Modern educational systems have also been criticized, by both the left and the right, for contributing to corporate brainwashing.&lt;ref&gt;''More Money Than Brains: Why School Sucks, College is Crap, &amp; Idiots Think They're Right'', [[Laura Penny]], McClelland &amp; Stewart, 20 April 2010, page 63.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1992 book, ''Democracy in an Age of Corporate Colonization'', [[Stanley A. Deetz]] says that modern "[[self awareness]]" and "[[self improvement]]" programs provide corporations with even more effective tools to control the minds of employees than traditional brainwashing.&lt;ref&gt;''Democracy in an Age of Corporate Colonization: Developments in Communication and the Politics of Everyday Life'', Stanley Deetz, SUNY Press, 1 January 1992, page 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2000 book, ''Destroying the World to Save It: Aum Shinrikyo, Apocalyptic Violence, and the New Global Terrorism'', Robert Lifton applied his original ideas about thought reform to [[Aum Shinrikyo]] and the [[War on Terrorism]], concluding that in this context thought reform was possible without violence or physical coercion. He also pointed out that in their efforts against terrorism Western governments were also using some mind control techniques, including [[thought-terminating cliché]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Destroying the ''World to Save It: Aum Shinrikyo, Apocalyptic Violence, and the New Global Terrorism'', Owl Books, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 2004 [[popular science]] book, ''[[Brainwashing: The Science of Thought Control]]'', [[neuroscientist]] and [[physiologist]] [[Kathleen Taylor (biologist)|Kathleen Taylor]] reviewed the history of mind control theories, as well as notable incidents.

'''The C.A.N''' (Convenient, Attractive, Normal) '''approach''' to eating behavior reveals three different ways or strategies that [[consumer psychology]] can be used to provide an organized framework to help people make healthier food choices.  The C is for convenient, the A is for attractive, and the N is for normal.  The idea was researched and created by Brian Wansink, Director of the Cornell Food and Brand Lab and others at Cornell University.   The researchers reviewed over 100 studies and found three things help people choose healthier foods.  The food must be convenient (C), attractive (A) and normal (N), or CAN.  The idea behind the CAN approach is to make foods like fruits and vegetables visible and easy to reach (convenient), nicely displayed (attractive), and look like a good choice (normal).
In a study, published in Psychology and Marketing, showed that when fruit is put in a nice bowl in your home on the counter—it becomes more convenient, attractive, and normal to grab a banana or orange, rather than the chocolate ice cream in the hidden back of the freezer.  Therefore, the CAN idea helps make healthier eating choices easier.
The results of this study are intended to help consumers make healthier decisions by adjusting the way they select and serve their food. The authors suggest these organizational frameworks can be used to show how research can help transform consumer eating environments.

== C.A.N. Method in the media ==

An article on cbsnews.com describes the research as more helpful then willpower alone to help lose weight and eat healthier.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, C. (2015, May 6).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5161">'''Contemplative psychotherapy''' is an approach to psychotherapy that includes the use of personal contemplative practices and insights informed by the spiritual tradition of Buddhism.  Contemplative psychotherapy differs from other, more traditional methods of counseling in that the therapist brings to the therapeutic relationship qualities of [[mindfulness]] and [[Karuṇā|compassion]] in order to help clients access their fundamental goodness and natural wisdom. The practice of Contemplative Psychotherapy grew out of a dialogue between Tibetan Buddhist master [[Trungpa Rinpoche|Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche]] and Western psychologists and psychiatrists.  This discussion led to the opening of the Contemplative Psychotherapy Department at [[Naropa University]] in 1978 by Edward M. Podvoll, a psychiatrist, psychoanalyst and dedicated student of Trungpa.&lt;ref name=Kaklauskas&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Francis J. Kaklauskas|editor2=Susan Nimanheminda|editor3=Louis Hoffman|title=Brilliant Sanity: Buddhist Approaches to Psychotherapy|publisher=Universities of the Rockies Press|location=Colorado Springs, CO}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|ix}}

Contemplative psychotherapy may be said to have two parents: the 2,500-year-old wisdom tradition of Buddhism and the clinical traditions of Western Psychology, especially the Humanistic school.  Like all offspring it has much in common with both of its parents and yet is uniquely itself at the same time.  From Buddhism comes the practice of [[Mindfulness|mindfulness/awareness meditation]], together with a highly sophisticated understanding of the functioning of the mind in sanity and in confusion.  From Western psychology come the investigation of the stages of human development, a precise language for discussing mental disturbance and the intimate method of working with others known as "psychotherapy". The root teaching of the contemplative psychotherapy program is the notion of "brilliant sanity".  This means that we all have within us a natural dignity and wisdom. Practitioners of contemplative psychotherapy become experts at recognizing sanity within even the most confused and distorted states of mind and are trained to nurture this sanity in themselves and in their clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wegela|first=Karen Kissel|title=The Courage to be Present: Buddhism, Psychotherapy, and the Awakening of Natural Wisdom|year=2009|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston, MA|pages=175–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core ideas==

===Brilliant sanity===

The basic premise of contemplative psychotherapy rests on the notion of ''"brilliant sanity"'', which suggests that we all have within us a natural dignity and wisdom and that our basic nature is characterized by clarity, openness, and compassion. This wisdom may be temporarily covered over, but it is there and may be cultivated. Practitioners of contemplative psychotherapy become experts at recognizing sanity within even the most confused and distorted states of mind and are trained to nurture this sanity in themselves and in their clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wegela|first=Karen Kissel|title=Contemplative Psychotherapy: A Path of Uncovering Brilliant Sanity|journal=Journal of Contemplative Psychotherapy|year=1994|volume=IX|pages=27–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

===Contemplative practice===
Buddhist psychology emphasizes the primacy of immediate experience. In the training of a contemplative psychotherapist, theoretical training is balanced with experiential training. By studying and experiencing his or her own mind, the contemplative therapist can then study and experience accurately the mind of others while engaging in therapeutic practices. The study of one's own mind can be achieved through meditation practice and body/mind awareness disciplines.&lt;ref name=Kaklauskas/&gt;{{rp|vi–vii}}

===Maitri space awareness===

Space awareness practice is designed to intensify and familiarize oneself with different
emotional and psychological states: both the "wisdom" aspects and the confused aspects. Maitri space awareness practice, when integrated with sitting meditation within a community environment, can assist practitioners in recognizing their own patterns, become friendly toward themselves in different states of mind, and develop genuine humor and compassion toward themselves and others. This often leads to relaxation and fearlessness in working with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trungpa|first=Chogyam|title=The Sanity We Are Born With|year=2005|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston, MA|pages=165–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Body, speech and mind practice===

Contemplative psychotherapy makes use of the Body-Speech-Mind approach to clinical supervision as a way to bring the client, the client's world and the therapeutic relationship (as experienced by the contemplative psychotherapist) vividly into the group supervisory situation. This presence in turn is used to directly facilitate working with energetic and conceptual obstacles and provides a basis for subsequent therapeutic interventions.&lt;ref name=Kaklauskas/&gt;{{rp|175–194}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8118">In [[mathematics]], especially [[differential geometry]], the '''cotangent bundle''' of a [[smooth manifold]] is the [[vector bundle]] of all the [[cotangent space]]s at every point in the manifold. It may be described also as the [[dual bundle]] to the [[tangent bundle]].

== The cotangent sheaf ==
{{main|Cotangent sheaf}}

[[Smooth function|Smooth]] [[Fiber bundle|sections]] of the cotangent bundle are differential [[one-form]]s.

=== Definition of the cotangent sheaf ===
Let ''M'' be a [[Differentiable manifold|smooth manifold]] and let ''M''&amp;times;''M'' be the [[Cartesian product]] of ''M'' with itself.  The [[diagonal mapping]] &amp;Delta; sends a point ''p'' in ''M'' to the point (''p'',''p'') of ''M''&amp;times;''M''.  The image of &amp;Delta; is called the diagonal.  Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; be the [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] of [[germ (mathematics)|germs]] of smooth functions on ''M''&amp;times;''M'' which vanish on the diagonal.  Then the quotient sheaf &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}/\mathcal{I}^2&lt;/math&gt; consists of equivalence classes of functions which vanish on the diagonal modulo higher order terms.  The cotangent sheaf is the [[inverse image functor|pullback]] of this sheaf to ''M'':

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma T^*M=\Delta^*\left(\mathcal{I}/\mathcal{I}^2\right).&lt;/math&gt;

By [[Taylor's theorem]], this is a [[locally free sheaf]] of modules with respect to the sheaf of germs of smooth functions of ''M''.  Thus it defines a [[vector bundle]] on ''M'':  the '''cotangent bundle'''.

See also: [[bundle of principal parts]] (which generalizes the above constructions to higher orders.)

=== Contravariance in manifolds ===

A smooth morphism &lt;math&gt; \phi\colon M\to N&lt;/math&gt; of manifolds, induces a [[Pullback (differential geometry)|pullback sheaf]] &lt;math&gt;\phi^*T^*N&lt;/math&gt; on ''M''. There is an [[Pullback (differential geometry)#Pullback of cotangent vectors and 1-forms|induced map]] of vector bundles &lt;math&gt;\phi^*(T^*N)\to T^*M&lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples ==
Given a smooth manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; embedded into &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the vanishing locus of a smooth function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, we can define the cotangent bundle of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; as the set
:&lt;math&gt;\{(x,dx) \in T^*\mathbb{R}^n:f(x) = 0; df(x) = 0\}&lt;/math&gt;
For example, consider the 3-sphere given by the vanishing locus of &lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^4&lt;/math&gt;. Then, we can compute a presentation of its cotangent bundle as the set
:&lt;math&gt;\{(x,y,z,w,dx,dy,dz,dw) \in T^*(\mathbb{R}^4): x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 = 1, 2xdx + 2ydy + 2zdz + 2wdw = 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;

== The cotangent bundle as phase space ==

Since the cotangent bundle ''X''=''T''*''M'' is a [[vector bundle]], it can be regarded as a manifold in its own right.  Because of the manner in which the definition of ''T''*''M'' relates to the [[differential topology]] of the base space ''M'', ''X'' possesses a canonical one-form &amp;theta; (also [[tautological one-form]] or [[symplectic potential]]).  The [[exterior derivative]] of &amp;theta; is a [[symplectic form|symplectic 2-form]], out of which a non-degenerate [[volume form]] can be built for ''X''.  For example, as a result ''X'' is always an [[orientable]] manifold (meaning that the tangent bundle of ''X'' is an orientable vector bundle). A special set of [[coordinates]] can be defined on the cotangent bundle; these are called the [[canonical coordinates]]. Because cotangent bundles can be thought of as [[symplectic manifold]]s, any real function on the cotangent bundle can be interpreted to be a [[symplectic vector space|Hamiltonian]]; thus the cotangent bundle can be understood to be a [[phase space]] on which [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] plays out.

=== The tautological one-form ===
{{main|Tautological one-form}}

The cotangent bundle carries a tautological one-form &amp;theta; also known as the ''Poincaré'' ''1''-form or ''Liouville'' ''1''-form. (The form is also known as the ''canonical one-form'', although this can sometimes lead to confusion.) This means that if we regard ''T''*''M'' as a manifold in its own right, there is a canonical [[Section (fiber bundle)|section]] of the vector bundle ''T''*(''T''*''M'') over ''T''*''M''.

This section can be constructed in several ways.  The most elementary method is to use local coordinates.  Suppose that ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; are local coordinates on the base manifold ''M''.  In terms of these base coordinates, there are fibre coordinates ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;:  a one-form at a particular point of ''T''*''M'' has the form ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''dx''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; ([[Einstein summation convention]] implied).  So the manifold ''T''*''M'' itself carries local coordinates (''x''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;,''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) where the ''x'' are coordinates on the base and the ''p'' are coordinates in the fibre.  The canonical one-form is given in these coordinates by

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_{(x,p)}=\sum_{{\mathfrak i}=1}^n p_i \, dx^i.&lt;/math&gt;

Intrinsically, the value of the canonical one-form in each fixed point of ''T*M'' is given as a [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]].  Specifically, suppose that {{nowrap|&amp;pi; : ''T*M'' &amp;rarr; ''M''}} is the [[Projection (mathematics)|projection]] of the bundle. Taking a point in ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;*''M'' is the same as choosing of a point ''x'' in ''M'' and a one-form &amp;omega; at ''x'', and the tautological one-form &amp;theta; assigns to the point (''x'', &amp;omega;) the value

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_{(x,\omega)}=\pi^*\omega.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, for a vector ''v'' in the tangent bundle of the cotangent bundle, the application of the tautological one-form &amp;theta; to ''v'' at (''x'', &amp;omega;) is computed by projecting ''v'' into the tangent bundle at ''x'' using {{nowrap|''d''&amp;pi; : ''TT''*''M'' &amp;rarr; ''TM''}} and applying &amp;omega; to this projection.  Note that the tautological one-form is not a pullback of a one-form on the base ''M''.

=== Symplectic form ===

The cotangent bundle has a canonical [[symplectic form|symplectic 2-form]] on it, as an [[exterior derivative]] of the [[tautological one-form|tautological one-form]], the [[symplectic potential]]. Proving that this form is, indeed, symplectic can be done by noting that being symplectic is a local property: since the cotangent bundle is locally trivial, this definition need only be checked on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. But there the one form defined is the sum of &lt;math&gt;y_i\,dx_i&lt;/math&gt;, and the differential is the canonical symplectic form, the sum of &lt;math&gt;dy_i \land dx_i&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Phase space ===

If the manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; represents the set of possible positions in a [[dynamical system]], then the cotangent bundle &lt;math&gt;\!\,T^{*}\!M&lt;/math&gt; can be thought of as the set of possible ''positions'' and ''momenta''. For example, this is a way to describe the [[phase space]] of a pendulum. The state of the pendulum is determined by its position (an angle) and its momentum (or equivalently, its velocity, since its mass is not changing). The entire state space ''looks like'' a cylinder. The cylinder is the cotangent bundle of the circle. The above symplectic construction, along with an appropriate [[energy]] function, gives a complete determination of the physics of system. See [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] for more information, and the article on [[geodesic flow]] for an explicit construction of the Hamiltonian equations of motion.

==Background==
As a technique, the deprogramming that has been practiced over the last half century has been typically commissioned by relatives, often parents of adult offspring, who objected to the subject's membership in an organization or group. It has been compared to exorcisms in both methodology and manifestation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shupe | first1 = Anson D. | last2 = JR | first2 =  | last3 = Spielmann | first3 = Roger | last4 = Stigall | first4 = Sam | year = 1977 | title = Deprogramming: The New Exorcism | url = | journal = American Behavioral Scientist | volume = 20 | issue = 6| pages = 941–956 | doi = 10.1177/000276427702000609 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the process sometimes has been performed with tacit support of law enforcement and judicial officials.&lt;ref&gt;Bromley, David Melton, J. Gordon 2002. Cults, Religion, and Violence. West Nyack, NY, USA: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reflex"/&gt;  In response to a burgeoning number of [[new religious movement]]s in the 1970s in the United States, the "father of deprogramming", [[Ted Patrick]], introduced many of these techniques to a wider audience as a means to combat cults.&lt;ref name="Chryssides"&gt;{{cite book|title=Exploring New Religions|last=Chryssides|first=George|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|year=1999|isbn=0-8264-5959-5|pages=346–348}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chryssides, G.D. and B.E. Zeller. 2014. The Bloomsbury Companion to New Religious Movements: BLOOMSBURY PUBLISHING.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, deprogrammings have been carried out "by the thousands".&lt;ref name="reflex"&gt;James T Richardson "Reflexivity and objectivity in the study of controversial new religions  Religion Vol. 21, Iss. 4, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; For example, various [[atrocity stories]] served as justification for deprogramming of [[Unification Church]] members in the USA.&lt;ref name="Kurtz2007"&gt;[[Lester R. Kurtz|Kurtz, Lester R.]] ''Gods in the Global Village: The World's Religions in Sociological Perspective'' 2007, Pine Forge Press, {{ISBN|1-4129-2715-3}}, page 228&lt;/ref&gt;

As a technique for encouraging people to disassociate with groups with whom they have as consenting adults chosen to associate, deprogramming is a controversial practice. Even some cult critics have denounced it on legal and ethical grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Langone, Michael D., and Paul R. Martin. "Viewpoint: Deprogramming, Exit Counseling, and Ethics: Clarifying the Confusion." Christian Research Institute Journal (30 June 1994) [Winter 1993]: page 46 (Retrieved 26 April 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Similar actions, when done without force, have been referred to as "[[exit counseling]]". 
Sometimes the word ''deprogramming'' is used in a wider (and/or ironic or humorous sense), to mean the freeing of someone (often oneself) from any previously uncritically assimilated [[idea]]. According to [[Carol Giambalvo]], "exit cousellors are usually former cult members themselves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Giambalvo |first=Carol |year= 1992 |title= Exit Counseling: A Family Intervention |url= |location= |publisher= [[American Family Foundation]] |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various academics have commented on the practice. For example, as defined by James T. Richardson, [[UNLV]] Professor of Sociology and Judicial Studies and Director of the Grant Sawyer Center for Justice Studies, deprogramming is a "private, self-help process whereby participants in unpopular new religious movements (NRMs) were forcibly removed from the group, incarcerated, and put through radical resocialization processes that were supposed to result in their agreeing to leave the group."&lt;ref name="richardson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Richardson | first1 = James T | year = 2011 | title = Deprogramming: from private self-help to governmental organized repression | url = | journal = Crime, Law and Social Change | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 321–336 | doi=10.1007/s10611-011-9286-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law professor [[Douglas Laycock]], author of ''Religious Liberty: The free exercise clause'', wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Beginning in the 1970s, many parents responded to the initial conversion with "deprogramming." The essence of deprogramming was to physically abduct the convert, isolate him and physically restrain him, and barrage him with continuous arguments and attacks against his new religion, threatening to hold him forever until he agreed to leave it.&lt;ref&gt;Laycock, D. 2011. ''Religious Liberty: The free exercise clause''. W.B. Eerdmans Publishing Company. https://books.google.com/books?id=bEiwxUad97IC.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lawyer John LeMoult, writing in a law review journal, described such practices as the person subject to deprogramming being "seized, held against his will, subjected to mental, emotional, and even physical pressures until he renounces his beliefs", and compared this power to that of Nazis over their prisoners.&lt;ref name="holywars"/&gt; Legal scholar [[Dean M. Kelley]] called deprogramming "protracted spiritual gang-rape".&lt;ref&gt;Dean Kelley, "Deprogramming and Religious Liberty", ''Civil Liberties Review'' 23 (July/August 1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedures ==
There has never been a standard procedure among deprogrammers; descriptions in anecdotal reports, studies, and interviews with former deprogrammers vary greatly. Deprogrammers generally operate on the presumption that the people they are paid to extract from religious organizations are victims of [[mind control]] (or [[brainwashing]]). Books written by deprogrammers and [[exit counseling|exit counselor]]s say that the most essential part of freeing the mind of a person is to convince the subject that he or she had been under the mental control of others.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

[[Ted Patrick]], one of the pioneers of deprogramming, used a confrontational method, enlisting psychiatrists and psychologists to assist him in the deprogramming process.&lt;ref name="holywars"&gt;24 T. Marshall L. Rev. 359 (1998-1999) Holy Wars: Involuntary Deprogramming as a Weapon against Cults; McAllister, Shawn&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick was tried and convicted of multiple felonies related to kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment of deprogramming subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Polly J. Regulation of religious proselytism in the United States. ''Brigham Young University Law Review''. 2001 537-574.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sylvia Buford, an associate of Ted Patrick who has assisted him on many deprogrammings, described five stages of deprogramming:&lt;ref name="All Gods Children"&gt;(Stoner, C., &amp; Parke, J. (1977). [[All Gods Children (book)|All God's children: The cult experience - salvation or slavery?]] Radrior, PA: Chilton )&lt;/ref&gt;
#Discredit the figure of authority: the cult leader
#Present contradictions (ideology versus reality): "How can he preach love when he exploits people?" is an example.
#The breaking point: When a subject begins to listen to the deprogrammer; when reality begins to take precedence over ideology.
#Self-expression: When the subject begins to open up and voice gripes against the cult.
#Identification and transference: when the subject begins to identify with the deprogrammers, starts to think as an opponent of the cult rather than as a member.

=== Violence ===
The deprogramming accounts vary widely regarding the use of force, with the most dramatic accounts coming from deprogrammed people who returned to the group.

[[Steven Hassan]] in his book ''Releasing the Bonds'' spoke against coercive deprogramming methods using force or threats.

The deprogramming case observed by Dubrow-Eichel did not include any violence.

Sociologist [[Eileen Barker]] wrote in Watching for Violence:

{{quote|Although deprogramming has become less violent in the course of time ... Numerous testimonies by those who were subjected to a deprogramming describe how they were threatened with a gun, beaten, denied sleep and food and/or sexually assaulted. But one does not have to rely on the victims for stories of violence: [[Ted Patrick]], one of the most notorious deprogrammers used by CAGs (who has spent several terms in prison for his exploits) openly boasts about some of the violence he employed; in November 1987, [[Cyril Vosper]], a Committee member of the British cult-awareness group, [[Family Action Information Resource|FAIR]], was convicted in Munich of "causing bodily harm" in the course of one of his many deprogramming attempts; and a number of similar convictions are on record for prominent members of CAGs elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cesnur.org/2001/london2001/barker.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''Colombrito vs. Kelly'', the Court accepted the definition of deprogramming by J. Le Moult published in 1978 in the Fordham Law Review:

{{quote|Deprogrammers are people who, at the request of a parent or other close relative, will have a member of a religious sect seized, then hold him against his will and subject him to mental, emotional, and even physical pressures until he renounces his religious beliefs. Deprogrammers usually work for a fee, which may easily run as high as $25,000.

The deprogramming process begins with abduction. Often strong men muscle the subject into a car and take him to a place where he is cut off from everyone but his captors. He may be held against his will for upward of three weeks. Frequently, however, the initial deprogramming only last a few days. The subject's sleep is limited and he is told that he will not be released until his beliefs meet his captors' approval. Members of the deprogramming group, as well as members of the family, come into the room where the victim is held and barrage him with questions and denunciations until he recants his newly found religious beliefs.}}

Deprogrammer [[Carol Giambalvo]] writes in the 1998 text "Deprogramming to Thought Reform Consultation":

{{quote|It was believed that the hold of the brainwashing over the cognitive processes of a cult member needed to be broken – or "snapped" as some termed it – by means that would shock or frighten the cultist into thinking again. For that reason in some cases cult leader's pictures were burned or there were highly confrontational interactions between deprogrammers and cultist. What was often sought was an emotional response to the information, the shock, the fear, and the confrontation. There are horror stories – promoted most vehemently by the cults themselves – about restraint, beatings, and even rape. And we have to admit that we have met former members who have related to us their deprogramming experience – several of handcuffs, weapons wielded and sexual abuse. But thankfully, these are in the minority – and in our minds, never justified. Nevertheless, deprogramming helped to free many individuals held captive to destructive cults at a time when other alternatives did not seem viable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giambalvo, Carol]] (November 1998).

Retrieved January 28, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Effectiveness and harm==
Alan W. Gomes (chairman of the department of theology at Talbot School of Theology, [[Biola University]]) in his 2009 book ''Unmasking the Cults'' reports:
  
{{quote|While advocates of the deprogramming position have claimed high rates of success, studies show that natural attrition rates actually are higher than the success rate achieved through deprogramming.&lt;ref&gt;Gomes, Alan W., ''Unmasking the Cults'',
Zondervan Guide to Cults and Religious Movements, [[Zondervan]], 2009
{{ISBN|0-310-86455-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-310-86455-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Dialog Center International]] (DCI) a major [[Christian countercult movement|Christian counter-cult]] organization founded in 1973 by a [[Denmark|Danish]] professor of [[missiology]] and [[ecumenism|ecumenical]] [[theology]], Dr. [[Johannes Aagaard]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/2007/aagaard.htm Obituary, 23 March 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; rejects deprogramming, believing that it is counterproductive, ineffective, and can harm the relationship between a cult member and concerned family members.&lt;ref&gt;''Exploring New Religions'', [[George D. Chryssides]], Continuum International Publishing Group, 2001, {{ISBN|0-8264-5959-5}},  {{ISBN|978-0-8264-5959-6}}, pages 353-254&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of psychiatry Saul Levine suggests that it is doubtful that deprogramming helps many people and goes on to say that it actually causes harm to the victim by very nature of the deprogramming. For deprogramming to work, the victim must be convinced that they joined a religious group against their will. They then must renounce responsibility and accept that in some mysterious way that their minds were controlled.&lt;ref name="levine"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levine | first1 =  | year = 1979 | title = The Role of Psychiatry in the Phenomenon of Cults | url = | journal = Canada Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 24 | issue = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is Levine's professional opinion that once deprogrammed, a person would never be certain that they were really doing what they want. He states that deprogramming destroys a person's identity and is likely to create permanent anxiety about freedom of choice and leave the deprogrammed subject dependent upon the guidance and advice of others. "Fundamentally deprogramming denies choice and creates dependency.  It robs people of their sense of responsibility.  Instead of encouraging people to accept that they made a mistake, it encourages people to deny their actions and blame others."&lt;ref name="levine"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Understanding Cults and New Age Religions, by Irving Hexham, Karla Poewe, and J. I. Packer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==

Deprogramming activities often fall outside of the law. Government agencies have at times been aware and have taken part in deprogramming to enforce official views of "correct" beliefs and behaviors.&lt;ref name="richardson"/&gt;  This can involve "vigorous, even violent, efforts to dissuade people from participating in groups deemed unacceptable to the government" and have been "given legal sanction by the passage of laws that make illegal the activities or even the beliefs
of the unpopular movement or group being targeted".&lt;ref name="richardson"/&gt;

==Controversy and related issues==
{{See also|Mind control#Deprogramming and the anti-cult movement|l1=Mind control: Deprogramming and the anti-cult movement}}

In the United States, from the mid-1970s and throughout the 1980s [[mind control]] was a widely accepted theory in public opinion, and the vast majority of [[newspaper]] and [[magazine]] accounts of deprogrammings assumed that recruits' relatives were well justified to seek [[conservatorship]]s and to hire deprogrammers. It took nearly 20 years for public opinion to shift.&lt;ref name=Rusher/&gt;

One aspect that gradually became disturbing from a civil rights point of view, was that relatives would use deception or other ethically questionable methods—even kidnapping—to get the recruit into deprogrammers' hands, without allowing the person any recourse to a lawyer or psychiatrist of their own choosing. Previously, there would be a sanity hearing first, and only then a commitment to an asylum or involuntary therapy. But with deprogramming, judges routinely granted parents legal authority over their adult children without a hearing.

One of main objections raised to deprogramming (as well as to [[exit counseling]]) is the contention that they begin with a [[false premise]]. Lawyers for some groups who have lost members due to deprogramming, as well as some [[civil libertarian]]s, [[sociologist]]s and [[psychologist]]s, argue that it is not the religious groups but rather the deprogrammers who are the ones who deceive and manipulate people.

[[David G. Bromley|David Bromley]] and [[Anson Shupe]] wrote:
{{Quote|Deprogrammers are like [[Witchcraft#Colonial_North_America|the American colonials who persecuted "witches"]]: a confession, drawn up before the suspect was brought in for torturing and based on the judges' fantasies about witchcraft, was signed under duress and then treated as justification for the torture.&lt;ref&gt;Bromley, David G., and Shupe, Anson D., Jr. (1981) Strange Gods, The Great American Cult Scare. Boston: Beacon (pp. 198-204)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A number of factors contributed to the cessation of deprogramming:

Some of the deprogrammed adults sued the deprogrammers or the relatives who had hired them.  Also in 1987, psychologist [[Margaret Singer]] became unusable as an [[expert witness]] after the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) rejected her [[APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control|''Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control'']] (DIMPAC) report.&lt;ref name=APA_memo&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gmcjPkrGTQ8C&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;ots=335cDzpa_5&amp;dq=%22May%2011%2C%201987%22%20dimpac&amp;pg=PA54#v=onepage&amp;q=%22May%2011,%201987%22%20dimpac&amp;f=false May 11, 1987, APA MEMORANDUM]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] published a statement in 1977 which said:
{{quote|ACLU opposes the use of mental incompetency proceedings, temporary conservatorship, or denial of government protection as a method of depriving people of the free exercise of religion, at least with respect to people who have reached the age of majority. Mode of religious proselytizing or persuasion for a continued adherence that do not employ physical coercion or threat of same are protected by the free exercise of religion clause of the First Amendment against action of state laws or by state officials. The claim of free exercise may not be overcome by the contention that 'brainwashing' or 'mind control' has been used, in the absence of evidence that the above standards have been violated.}}

In the 1980s in the United States, namely in [[New York (state)|New York]] (Deprogramming Bill, 1981), [[Kansas]] (Deprogramming Bill, 1982), and [[Nebraska]] (conservatorship legislation for 1985), lawmakers unsuccessfully attempted to legalize involuntary deprogramming.

Rev. [[Sun Myung Moon]], founder of the [[Unification Church]] (many of whose members were targets of deprogramming) issued this statement in 1983:

{{quote|The methods involved in "deprogramming" are like those used in Communist concentration camps. Using parents and relatives to entrap members, "deprogrammers" commit grown adults to mental hospitals with the supposed "illness" of holding of a minority religious belief. Other typical deprogramming techniques include kidnapping, illegal detention, violence, psychological harassment, [[sleep deprivation]], inducement to use alcohol and drugs, sexual seduction and rape. By such threats, harassment and manipulation, professional "deprogrammers" force members to renounce their faith. Many people are injured physically and psychologically because of this criminal activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unification.net/1983/831125.html]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the 1990s, deprogrammer [[Rick Ross (consultant)|Rick Ross]] was sued by [[Jason Scott case|Jason Scott]], a former member of a Pentecostal group called the Life Tabernacle Church, after an unsuccessful deprogramming attempt. In 1995, the jury awarded Scott $875,000 in compensatory damages and $2,500,000 in punitive damages against Ross, which were later settled for $5,000 and 200 hours of services. More significantly, the jury also found that the leading anti-cult group known as the [[Cult Awareness Network]] was a co-conspirator in the crime and fined CAN $1,000,000 in punitive damages, forcing the group into [[bankruptcy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/2001/CAN/02/01.htm Scott vs. Ross, Workman, Simpson.] Retrieved May 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This case is often seen as effectively closing the door on the practice of involuntary deprogramming in the United States.&lt;ref name="holywars"/&gt;

==Referral and kickback system==
Anti-cult groups play a central role in maintaining the underground network of communications, referrals, transportation, and housing necessary for continued deprogramming.&lt;ref&gt;
Davis, D. and B. Hankins. 2003. New Religious Movements and Religious Liberty in America: Baylor University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups such as the [[Cult Awareness Network]] operated a referral scheme ([[Cult Awareness Network#NARDEC|NARDEC]]) in which they would refer people to deprogrammers in return for a 'kickback' in the form of a donation or as a commission.&lt;ref name="shupe2011"&gt;Shupe, A. and S.E.

==Victims==
In 1974, Kathy Crampton, whose abduction and deprogramming were televised across the US, went back to the [[Love Family]] group several days after her apparently successful deprogramming. Patrick was charged with kidnapping, but acquitted with the reasoning: "[w]here parents are, as here, of the reasonable and intelligent belief that they were not physically capable of recapturing their daughter from existing, imminent danger, then the defense of necessity transfers or transposes to the constituted agent, the person who acts upon their belief under such conditions. Here that agent is the Defendant [[Ted Patrick]]." ''(District Court of the United States 1974: 79; New York Times 1974).''

In 1980, Susan Wirth, a 35-year-old teacher living in San Francisco, was abducted by her parents to be deprogrammed in reaction to her leftist political views and activities.&lt;ref name=Rusher/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Daughter kidnapped over politics|date = July 2, 1980|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2002&amp;dat=19800702&amp;id=Q6wiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GLIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1677,212672|newspaper = [[Beaver County Times]]|accessdate = November 14, 2013|agency = [[Associated Press]]|page = A-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Patrick was paid $27,000 to carry out the deprogramming, which involved handcuffing her to a bed for two weeks and denying her food.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Garrard Postpage, ''Inquiries in bioethics'', 1993, Georgetwon University Press, {{ISBN|0-87840-538-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-87840-538-1}}, page 71&lt;/ref&gt;  She was later released and after returning to San Francisco spoke out against deprogramming but declined to press legal charges against her parents.&lt;ref&gt;"Feared kidnapped, she reconciles with mother", ''[[Merced Sun-Star]]'', July 29, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Patrick was convicted of conspiracy, kidnapping, and [[false imprisonment]] for abducting and attempting to deprogram Roberta McElfish, a 26-year-old Tucson waitress.&lt;ref name="nyt-08301980" /&gt; Patrick was sentenced to one year in prison and fined $5,000.&lt;ref name="nyt-09271980"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ted Patrick is sentenced in seizure of cult member|date=1980-09-27|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Stephanie Riethmiller, who lived in Ohio, was kidnapped by deprogrammers hired by her parents to end her lesbian relationship. She was held against her will and repeatedly raped. After her release she filed civil charges against her parents and the deprogrammers, which were dismissed in a trial that generated some controversy in the media.&lt;ref name=Rusher&gt;{{cite news|last=Rusher|first=William A.|title=Deprogramming A Disgrace To Free Society|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1891&amp;dat=19830528&amp;id=0KQfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LNYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4176,5893764|accessdate=14 November 2013|newspaper=Gadsden Times|date=28 May 1983|page=A4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Violence Against Lesbians and Gay Men'',

In 1990, Patrick attempted to deprogram Elma Miller, an [[Amish]] woman who had joined a liberal sect. He was hired by her husband to return her to him and the Amish church. Criminal charges of conspiracy were filed against Miller's husband, brother, and two others but were later dropped on her request to the prosecuting attorney.&lt;ref&gt;''Amish Woman Charges Deprogramming'', ''[[Pittsburg Press]]'', November 30, 1990, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Amish Woman Asks Prosecutor to Drop Charges on Kidnapping'', [[Madison Courier]]'', December 8, 1990, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exit counseling==
Deprogramming and exit counseling, sometimes seen as one and the same, are distinct approaches to convincing a person to leave a cult.{{explain|date=September 2018}}

Proponents of the distinction, however, state that deprogramming entails coercion and confinement, while exit counseling assures the subject of the freedom to leave at any time. Deprogramming typically costs $10,000 or more, mainly because of the expense of a security team. Exit counseling typically costs $2,000 to $4,000, including expenses, for a three- to five-day intervention, although cases requiring extensive research of little-known groups can cost much more (estimated in 1993). Deprogramming, especially when it fails, entails considerable legal and psychological risk (for example, a permanent alienation of the subject from his or her family). The psychological and legal risks in exit counseling are significantly reduced. Although deprogrammers do prepare families for the process, exit counselors tend to work with them directly, expecting those requesting the intervention to contribute more to the process; that is, exit counseling requires that families establish a reasonable and respectful level of communication with their loved one before the program itself can begin. Because deprogramming relies on coercion, which is illegal except in the case of conservatorship and is generally viewed as unethical, deprogrammers' critiques of the unethical practices of cults tend to be less credibility to the subject than the arguments of exit counselors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/cri/cri-jrnl/web/crj0121a.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Hassan]], author of the book ''[[Combatting Cult Mind Control]]'', states that he took part in a number of deprogrammings in the late 1970s, and has spoken out against them since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomofmind.com/stevehassan/refuting/ Refuting the Disinformation Attacks Put Forth by Destructive Cults and their Agents], by Steven Hassan&lt;/ref&gt; Hassan states that he has not participated in any deprogrammings since then, although on page 114 of ''Combatting'', Hassan states that deprogrammings should be kept as a last resort if all other attempts fail to transform the individual. Hassan is one of the major proponents of exit counseling as a form of intercession, and he refers to his method as "strategic intervention therapy".

The '''Dyad''' is a title used by the [[Pythagoreans]] for the number two, representing the principle of "twoness" or "otherness".

[[Numenius of Apamea]], a [[Neopythagoreanism|Neopythagorean]] philosopher in the latter 2nd century CE, said that [[Pythagoras]] gave the name of [[Monad (Greek philosophy)|Monad]] to God, and the name of Dyad to matter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chalcidius]] r.52, 5–24, as cited in {{cite book |author=Kahn, Charles N. |title=Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans: a brief history |publisher=Hackett Pub |location=Indianapolis, IN |year=2001 |isbn=0-87220-575-4 |oclc= |doi= |page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quotation needed|date=October 2010}} Aristotle equated matter as the formation of the elements (energies) into the material world as the static material was formed by the energies being acted upon by force or motion.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Later [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] Philosophers and [[idealism|idealists]] like [[Plotinus]] treated the dyad as a second cause ([[demiurge]]),{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} which was the divine mind ([[nous]]) that via a reflective nature{{Clarification needed|date=October 2010}} ([[Wikt:finite|finiteness]]) causes matter to "appear" or become perceivable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18316">'''Eastern philosophy in clinical psychology''' refers to the influence of Eastern philosophies on the practice of [[clinical psychology]] based on the idea that East and West are false dichotomies. Travel and trade along the [[Silk Road]] brought ancient texts and mind practices deep into the West.  Vedic psychology dates back  5000 years and forms the core of mental health counselling in the [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic medical]] tradition. The knowledge that enlightened [[Siddhartha Gautama]] was the self-management of mental [[suffering]] through [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] awareness practices. Humane interpersonal care of the mentally disturbed was practiced in the Middle East in the Middle Ages, and later in the West.&lt;ref&gt;MIND (2004) [http://www.mind.org.uk/Information/Factsheets/History+of+mental+health/Notes+on+the+History+of+Mental+Health+Care.htm Notes on the history of mental health care] ''Mind factsheets''&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the founders of clinical psychology were influenced by these ancient texts as translations began to reach Europe during the 19th century.

== Historical clinical psychologists ==
{{further|Islamic psychology}}

The historical practice of clinical psychology may be distinguished from the modern profession of clinical psychology. The Greek word ''psyche'' means 'breath' or 'soul', while ''-logy'' (from ''logos'', meaning 'speech') means 'study of'. [[Eros and Psyche|Psyche]] was the Greek goddess of the soul. An early use of the word [[clinic]] was to describe 'one who receives baptism on a sick bed' (Webster 1913).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dictionary.net/clinic.&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary use it usually describes another kind of cleansing and rebirth – a non-hospital, healthcare facility for rehabilitation in the community.

[[Patanjali]] was one of the founders of the yoga tradition, sometime between 200 and 400 BC (pre-dating Buddhist psychology) and a student of the [[Vedas]]. He developed the science of breath and mind and wrote his knowledge in the form of between 194 and 196 aphorisms called the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]. These remain one of the only scientific books written in poetic form. He is reputed to have used yoga therapeutically for anxiety, depression and mental disorders as common then as now.

[[File:Guru Rinpoche - Padmasambhava statue.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Padmasambhava|Padmasam-bhava]] developed Tibetan psychiatry]]
[[Padmasambhava]] was the 8th-century medicine Buddha of Tibet, called from the then Buddhist India to tame the Tibetans, and was instrumental in developing Tibetan psychiatric medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, T 'Tibetan buddhist medicine and psychiatry'  Samuel Wiser (1984) including charts of Tibetan psychopharmacology and translation of three chapters of the 8th Century text Gyu-Zhi&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetans were diplomats, counselors, traders, warriors and military tacticians in the Royal courts of East and West. Through these means they introduced arts of war and medicine to the west.

[[Rhazes]] was a Persian physician and scholar of the Middle Ages who had a profound effect on Western thought and medicine as well as the invention of alcohol and of sulfur drugs. He applied the psychology of self-esteem in clinical treatment of his patients (predating [[Nathaniel Branden]] by over a thousand years). He opened the first hospital ward for humane treatment of the mentally ill.

[[Avicenna]]'s ''Canon of Medicine'' was a standard medical text in many European universities for 500 years. He performed psychotherapy without conversing, by observing the movement of a patient's pulse as the patient recounted broken hearted anguish, reported in 'The Life and Work of Jalaluddin Rumi' by Afzal Iqbal, A. J. Arberry, page 94. His treatises have touched most of the Muslim circle of the sciences.

[[Jalaluddin Rumi]]'s view on psychotherapy was to embrace the dread, depression and anger as a blessing. Negative emotions were a bridge to a better life. This style of coping is illustrated in his guesthouse poem: 
::This being human is a guesthouse&lt;br&gt;every morning a new arrival a joy, a&lt;br&gt;depression, a meanness. Some momentary&lt;br&gt;awareness comes as an unexpected&lt;br&gt;visitor. Welcome and entertain them&lt;br&gt;all! Even if they're a crowd of sorrows&lt;br&gt;who violently sweep your house empty of&lt;br&gt;its furniture. Still treat each guest&lt;br&gt;honorably, He may be cleaning you out for&lt;br&gt;some new delight! The dark&lt;br&gt;thought, the shame, the malice meet them&lt;br&gt;at the door laughing and invite them in,&lt;br&gt;be grateful for whoever comes because&lt;br&gt;each has been sent as a guide from the&lt;br&gt;beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Rumi (1995) cited in Zokav (2001), p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] read the German translation of the works of [[Hayyim ben Joseph Vital]] (1542–1620). Vital was a 16th-century rabbi who had been [[Isaac Luria]]'s student, the great master of the theosophical [[Kabbalah]].  Freud read the French translation of the [[Zohar]]. He declared the material 'gold!' without acknowledging that source in his theories. His corpus was deeply influenced by his Jewish heritage and by the Jewish mysticism.&lt;ref&gt;Drob (1989); and, Drob (1998-2006).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jungsm.jpg|thumb|90px|[[Carl Jung]] integrated psychology with spirituality]] 
[[Carl Jung]] read the German translations by [[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]] of ''[[The Secret of the Golden Flower]]'', the I Ching. He also read the Kabbalah and drew on its sources for development of his theory of the archetypes.&lt;ref&gt;Drob (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Buber]]

[[Karen Horney]] studied Zen-Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Fromm ''et al.'' (1960, p. 78) states that Karen Horney "was intensely interested in Zen Buddhism during the last years of her life." Also see DeMartino (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fritz Perls]] studied [[Zen Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Wulf (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Typifying such a perspective, Perls once stated: We must lose our minds and come to our senses.

[[Erich Fromm]] collaborated with [[D. T. Suzuki]] in a 1957 workshop on "Zen Buddhism and Psychoanalysis";&lt;ref&gt;Fromm ''et al.''. (1960) is based on presentations given during the 1957 workshop.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote the foreword to a 1986 anthology of [[Nyanaponika Thera]]'s essays.&lt;ref&gt;See Nyanaponika ''et al'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Viktor Frankl]] was the founder of Logotherapy. He wrote ''From Death Camp to Existentialism'' (1959) drawing on concentration camp experience and Jewish mysticism.

[[Abraham Maslow]], an American-born Jew who struggled to make his way as a psychologist in an academic atmosphere which was not then ready to receive Jews. He believed his theories of motivation and self-actualization were, despite his avowed atheism, driven by a Jewish consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art.man.ac.uk/RELTHEOL/JEWISH/Silverman.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The Transpersonal psychology that Maslow founded is a blend of Eastern and Western mystic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Nielsen (1994-2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanislav Grof]] studied pre-industrial cosmologies including Egyptian and explored the significance of the posthumous journey of the soul in works such as ''Books of the Dead'' and ''The Human Encounter with Death''.&lt;ref&gt;Grof (1994a); Grof (1994b); Grof &amp; Halifax (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influential Western writers and translators ==
[[Baruch Spinoza]]'s legacy to psychology includes his holistic approach and determinism. He was alienated from his Jewish roots by [[Herem (censure)|excommunication]] and yet embedded in Jewish philosophy and mysticism, for example, 'The human mind cannot be absolutely destroyed with the body, but something of it remains, which is eternal. We feel and know by experience that we are eternal'. (Book V, Proposition 23).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070207080902/http://www.euronet.nl/~advaya/randomnotes.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; He distinguished between active emotions (those that are rationally understood) and passive emotions (those that are not). This predated Freud's popularization of the [[unconscious mind]]. His view, that emotions must be detached from external cause in order to master them, presages [[rational emotive therapy]]. His understanding of the workings of mind makes a bridge between religious mysticism and clinical psychology.

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] was deeply influenced by the first  translations of Hindu and Buddhist texts to reach the west in the 19th Century. His philosophy and methods of inquiry have many similarities to those traditions. His ideas foreshadowed and laid the groundwork for Darwin's theory of evolution and Freud's concepts of libido and unconscious [[Arthur Schopenhauer#Psychology|mind]]. He added empiricism to self-examination, which presaged Freud's interpersonal application in [[psychoanalysis]].

[[File:CAFRD.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Caroline Augusta Foley Rhys Davids|Caroline Rhys Davids]] wrote on [[Buddhism and psychology|Buddhist psychology]].]] 
[[Caroline Rhys Davids]] was a Pali scholar who translated original Pali texts in Buddhist Psychology. In 1914, she  wrote ''Buddhist Psychology: An Inquiry into the Analysis and Theory of Mind in Pali Literature''. Her teacher in Psychology was [[George Croom Robertson]], Scottish philosopher, editor of Mind from foundation in 1876 until 1891.

[[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]] was a translator of Chinese into German of the I Ching, Tao Te Ching and The Secret of the Golden Flower, with a forward written by Jung, a close personal friend.

[[File:Idries Shah.gif|thumb|100px|[[Idries Shah]] expanded Western knowledge of [[Sufism]]]]
[[Idries Shah]] was an  author in the Naqshbandi sufist tradition who wrote works on psychology and spirituality. Defined Sufism in a way that predated Islam and did not depend on the Qur'an.

[[Coleman Barks]] has translated ecstatic poems of [[Rumi]] and other mystic poets of Persia.

[[Jack Kornfield]] trained as a Buddhist monk in India and Southeast Asia, holds a PhD in clinical psychology and co-founded the [[Insight Meditation Society]] and the Spirit Rock Meditation Center. His books include ''Seeking the Heart of Wisdom'' (1987, co-authored with [[Joseph Goldstein (writer)|Joseph Goldstein]]), ''A Path with Heart'' (1993) and ''The Art of Forgiveness, Lovingkindness and Peace'' (2002).

[[Daniel Goleman]] taught psychology at Harvard, wrote on science for the New York Times and is the author of the best-selling ''Emotional Intelligence'' (1995) and ''Destructive Emotions: A Scientific Dialogue with the Dalai Lama'' (Bantam Books, 2003).

[[Thomas Cleary]] was a prolific translator of Buddhist, Taoist, Confucian and Muslim religious literature. First publication with his brother of the [[Blue Cliff Record]] in 1992.

== Contemporary clinicians ==
[[Marsha M. Linehan]] incorporates mindfulness techniques (particularly [[Zen]] practices) in her [[Dialectical Behavioral Therapy]] (DBT) which has been found to be particularly effective with Cluster-B personality disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Regarding Linehan's conscious use of Zen techniques, see, for instance, Linehan (1993a), p. 19, and  Linehan (1993b), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jon Kabat-Zinn]] incorporates Buddhist [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] techniques in his [[Mindfulness-based stress reduction|Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction]] (MBSR) program.&lt;ref&gt;Kabat-Zinn (1990), pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Epstein]] is the author of ''Thoughts Without a Thinker|Thoughts without a Thinker: Psychotherapy from a Buddhist Perspective'' (1995) and ''Going to Pieces Without Falling Apart'' (1998).&lt;ref&gt;[http://domanassa.org/blog/sitting-with-depression/ Sitting with Depression]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mordechai Rotenberg]] has adopted the [[Kabbalistic]]-[[Hasidic]] [[tzimtzum]] paradigm, which he believes has significant implications for clinical therapy. According to this paradigm, God's "self-contraction" to vacate space for the world serves as a model for human behavior and interaction. The tzimtzum model promotes a unique community-centric approach which contrasts starkly with the language of Western psychology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishpsychology.org/about2_e.php Rotenberg Center for Jewish Psychology]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:NewtonsLawOfUniversalGravitation.svg|thumb|right|200px|The theory of ''entropic gravity'' abides by [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] on Earth and at interplanetary distances but diverges from this classic nature at interstellar distances.]]

'''Entropic gravity''', also known as '''emergent gravity''', is a theory in modern physics that describes [[gravity]] as an ''[[entropic force]]''—a force with macro-scale homogeneity but which is subject to [[Quantum fluctuation|quantum-level]] disorder—and not a [[fundamental interaction]]. The theory, based on [[string theory]], [[black hole]] physics, and [[quantum information theory]], describes gravity as an ''emergent'' phenomenon that springs from the [[quantum entanglement]] of small bits of [[spacetime]] information. As such, entropic gravity is said to abide by the [[second law of thermodynamics]] under which the [[entropy]] of a physical system tends to increase over time.

At its simplest, the theory holds that when gravity becomes vanishingly weak—levels seen only at interstellar distances—it diverges from its classically understood nature and its strength begins to decay ''linearly with distance'' from a mass.

Entropic gravity provides the underlying framework to explain [[Modified Newtonian Dynamics]], or MOND, which holds that at a [[gravitational acceleration]] threshold of approximately {{val|1.2e-10}} m/s², gravitational strength begins to vary ''inversely'' (linearly) with distance from a mass rather than the normal [[inverse-square law]] of the distance. This is an exceedingly low threshold, measuring only 12&amp;nbsp;trillionths [[Standard gravity|gravity’s strength at earth’s surface]]; an object dropped from a height of one meter would fall for 36 hours were earth’s gravity this weak. It is also 3,000 times less than exists at the point where {{nowrap|''[[Voyager 1]]''}} crossed our solar system’s [[Heliosphere#Heliopause|heliopause]] and entered interstellar space.

The theory claims to be consistent with both the macro-level observations of [[Newtonian gravity]] as well as Einstein's [[general relativity|theory of general relativity]] and its gravitational distortion of spacetime. Importantly, the theory also explains (without invoking the existence of [[dark matter]] and its accompanying math featuring new [[free parameter]]s that are tweaked to obtain the desired outcome) why [[Galaxy rotation curve|galactic rotation curves]] differ from the profile expected with visible matter.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The theory of entropic gravity posits that what has been interpreted as unobserved dark matter is the product of quantum effects that can be regarded as a form of ''positive [[dark energy]]'' that lifts the [[vacuum energy]] of space from its ground state value. A central tenet of the theory is that the positive dark energy leads to a thermal-volume law contribution to entropy that overtakes the area law of [[anti-de Sitter space]] precisely at
the [[Hubble volume|cosmological horizon]].

The theory has been controversial within the physics community but has sparked research and experiments to test its validity.

==Origin==
The thermodynamic description of gravity has a history that goes back at least to research on [[black hole thermodynamics]] by [[Jacob Bekenstein|Bekenstein]] and [[Stephen Hawking|Hawking]] in the mid-1970s. These studies suggest a deep connection between [[gravity]] and thermodynamics, which describes the behavior of heat. In 1995, [[Theodore Jacobson|Jacobson]] demonstrated that the [[Einstein field equations]] describing relativistic gravitation can be derived by combining general thermodynamic considerations with the [[equivalence principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jacobson |first=Theodore|title=Thermodynamics of Spacetime: The Einstein Equation of State|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.1260|date=4 April 1995|pages=1260–1263|issue=7|volume=75|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|arxiv=gr-qc/9504004|bibcode=1995PhRvL..75.1260J|pmid=10060248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, other physicists, most notably [[Thanu Padmanabhan]], began to explore links between gravity and [[entropy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Padmanabhan|first=Thanu|title=Thermodynamical Aspects of Gravity: New insights|year=2010|pages=6901|issue=4|volume=73|journal=Rep.

==Erik Verlinde's theory==
In 2009, [[Erik Verlinde]] proposed a conceptual model that describes gravity as an entropic force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=van Calmthout|first=Martijn|title=Is Einstein een beetje achterhaald?|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/wetenschap/article1326775.ece/Is_Einstein_een_beetje_achterhaald|accessdate=6 September 2010|newspaper=de Volkskrant|date=12 December 2009|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He argues (similar to Jacobson's result) that gravity is a consequence of the "information associated with the positions of material bodies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=E.P. Verlinde |doi=10.1007/JHEP04(2011)029 |journal=JHEP |title=On the Origin of Gravity and the Laws of Newton |bibcode = 2011JHEP...04..029V |arxiv = 1001.0785 |volume=2011|issue=4 |pages=29 |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This model combines the thermodynamic approach to gravity with [[Gerard 't Hooft]]'s [[holographic principle]]. It implies that gravity is not a [[fundamental interaction]], but an [[emergent phenomenon]] which arises from the statistical behavior of microscopic [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] encoded on a holographic screen.  The paper drew a variety of responses from the scientific community. [[Andrew Strominger]], a string theorist at Harvard said "Some people have said it can't be right, others that it's right and we already knew it — that it’s right and profound, right and trivial."&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Overbye|first=Dennis|title=A Scientist Takes On Gravity|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/13/science/13gravity.html?_r=1|accessdate=6 September 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, Verlinde presented the further development of his ideas in a contribution to the Strings 2011 conference, including an explanation for the origin of dark matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.physics.uu.se/external/strings2011/presentations/5%20Friday/1220_Verlinde.pdf E.

Verlinde's article also attracted a large amount of media exposure,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20527443.800-the-entropy-force-a-new-direction-for-gravity.html?page=1 The entropy force: a new direction for gravity], [[New Scientist]], 20 January 2010, issue 2744&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2010/01/gravity-is-an-entropic-form-of-holographic-information/ Gravity is an entropic form of holographic information], ''[[Wired Magazine]]'', 20 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and led to immediate follow-up work in cosmology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1001.3237 |author1=Fu-Wen Shu |author2=Yungui Gong |title=Equipartition of energy and the first law of thermodynamics at the apparent horizon |year=2011 |doi=10.1142/S0218271811018883 |volume=20 |issue=4 |journal=International Journal of Modern Physics D |pages=553–559|bibcode = 2011IJMPD..20..553S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rong-Gen Cai |author2=Li-Ming Cao |author3=Nobuyoshi Ohta |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.81.061501 |journal=Phys.

==Derivation of the law of gravitation==
The law of gravitation is derived from classical statistical mechanics applied to the [[holographic principle]], that states that the description of a volume of space can be thought of as &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; bits of binary information, encoded on a boundary to that region, a closed surface of area &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. The information is evenly distributed on the surface with each bit requiring an area equal to &lt;math&gt;\ell_\text{P}^2&lt;/math&gt;, the so-called ''Planck area'', from which &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; can thus be computed:

:&lt;math&gt;N = \frac{A}{\ell_\text{P}^2} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ell_\text{P}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Planck length]]. The Planck length is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\ell_\text{P} = \sqrt\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[universal gravitational constant]], &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light, and &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the reduced [[Planck constant]]. When substituted in the equation for &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; we find:

:&lt;math&gt;N = \frac{A c^3}{\hbar G}&lt;/math&gt;

The statistical [[equipartition theorem]] defines the temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of a system with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; degrees of freedom in terms of its energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; such that:

:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2} N k_\text{B} T&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_\text{B}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]]. This is the [[mass–energy equivalence|equivalent energy]] for a mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; according to:

:&lt;math&gt;E = Mc^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The effective temperature experienced due to a uniform acceleration in a [[vacuum state|vacuum field]] according to the [[Unruh effect]] is:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\hbar a}{2\pi c k_\text{B}}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is that acceleration, which for a mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; would be attributed to a force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; according to [[Newton's second law]] of motion:

:&lt;math&gt;F = ma&lt;/math&gt;.

Taking the holographic screen to be a sphere of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the surface area would be given by:

:&lt;math&gt;A = 4\pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;.

From algebraic substitution of these into the above relations,  one derives from first principles [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;F = m \frac{2\pi c k_\text{B} T}{\hbar} = m \frac{4\pi c}{\hbar} \frac{E}{N} = m \frac{4\pi c^3}{\hbar} \frac{M}{N} = m 4\pi \frac{GM}{A} = G \frac{m M}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Criticism and experimental tests==

Entropic gravity, as proposed by Verlinde in his original article, reproduces the [[Einstein field equations]] and, in a Newtonian approximation, a 1/r potential for gravitational forces. Since its results do not differ from Newtonian gravity except in regions of extremely small gravitational fields, testing the theory with earth-based laboratory experiments doesn’t appear feasible. Spacecraft-based experiments performed at [[Lagrangian point]]s within our solar system would be expensive and challenging.

Even so, entropic gravity in its current form has been severely challenged on formal grounds. [[Matt Visser]] has shown&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Visser|first=Matt|title=Conservative entropic forces|journal=JHEP|volume=1110|issue=10|pages=140|arxiv=1108.5240|year=2011|doi=10.1007/JHEP10(2011)140}}, to appear in JHEP&lt;/ref&gt; that the attempt to model conservative forces in the general Newtonian case (i.e. for arbitrary potentials and an unlimited number of discrete masses) leads to unphysical requirements for the required entropy and involves an unnatural number of temperature baths of differing temperatures. Visser concludes:
{{quote|There is no reasonable doubt concerning the physical reality of entropic forces, and no reasonable doubt that classical (and semi-classical) general relativity is closely related to thermodynamics [52–55]. Based on the work of Jacobson [1–6], [[Thanu Padmanabhan]] [7– 12], and others, there are also good reasons to suspect a thermodynamic interpretation of the fully relativistic Einstein equations might be possible. Whether the specific proposals of Verlinde [26] are anywhere near as fundamental is yet to be seen — the rather baroque construction needed to accurately reproduce n-body Newtonian gravity in a Verlinde-like setting certainly gives one pause.}}

For the derivation of Einstein's equations from an entropic gravity perspective, Tower Wang shows &lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Wang |first=Tower |title=Modified entropic gravity revisited |eprint=1211.5722|class=hep-th |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the inclusion of energy-momentum conservation and cosmological homogeneity and isotropy requirements severely restrict a wide class of potential modifications of entropic gravity, some of which have been used to generalize entropic gravity beyond the singular case of an entropic model of Einstein's equations. Wang asserts that:
{{quote|As indicated by our results, the modified entropic gravity models of form (2), if not killed, should live in a very narrow room to assure the energy-momentum conservation and to accommodate a homogeneous isotropic universe.}}

Cosmological observations using available technology can be used to test the theory. On the basis of lensing by the galaxy cluster Abell 1689, Nieuwenhuizen concludes that EG is strongly ruled out unless additional (dark) matter like eV neutrinos is added.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=How Zwicky already ruled out modified gravity theories without dark matter|first=Theodorus M.|last=Nieuwenhuizen |journal=Fortschritte der Physik|volume=65|issue=6–8|page=1600050|doi=10.1002/prop.201600050|arxiv=1610.01543|date=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A team from [[Leiden Observatory]] statistically observing the [[Gravitational lens|lensing effect of gravitational fields]] at large distances from the centers of more than 33,000 galaxies, found that those gravitational fields were consistent with Verlinde's theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://phys.org/news/2016-12-verlinde-theory-gravity.html |title=Verlinde's new theory of gravity passes first test |date=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=First test of Verlinde's theory of Emergent Gravity using Weak Gravitational Lensing measurements |first1=Margot M. |last1=Brouwer |display-authors=etal |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume= 466|issue=to appear |date=11 December 2016 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stw3192 |arxiv=1612.03034 |pages=2547–2559|bibcode = 2017MNRAS.466.2547B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2116446-first-test-of-rival-to-einsteins-gravity-kills-off-dark-matter/|title=First test of rival to Einstein’s gravity kills off dark matter|date=15 December 2016|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using conventional gravitational theory, the fields implied by these observations (as well as from measured [[galaxy rotation curves]]) could only be ascribed to a particular distribution of [[dark matter]].

In June 2017, a study by [[Princeton University]] researcher Kris Pardo asserted that Verlinde's theory is inconsistent with the observed rotation velocities of [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]].&lt;ref name="QuantaMagazine2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Researchers Check Space-Time to See if It's Made of Quantum Bits | website=Quanta Magazine | date=2017-06-21 | url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/researchers-check-space-time-to-see-if-its-made-of-quantum-bits-20170621/ | access-date=2017-08-11 | quote=Emergent gravity successfully predicts the rotation velocities of the smallest galaxies in the sample.

[[Sabine Hossenfelder]] argues that "one should interpret these studies with caution" because "approximations must be made to arrive at [the tested] equation[s]" and it's not yet clear that the approximations are themselves correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2017/02/28/is-dark-matter-about-to-be-killed-by-emergent-gravity/ |title=Recent Claims Invalid: Emergent Gravity Might Deliver A Universe Without Dark Matter |last1=Hossenfelder |first1=Sabine |date=28 February 2017 |website=forbes.com |publisher=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entropic gravity and quantum coherence===
Another criticism of entropic gravity is that entropic processes should, as critics argue, break [[quantum coherence]]. Experiments with ultra-cold neutrons in the gravitational field of Earth are claimed to show that neutrons lie on discrete levels exactly as predicted by the [[Schrödinger equation]] considering the gravitation to be a conservative potential field without any decoherent factors. Archil Kobakhidze argues that this result disproves entropic gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kobakhidze |first=Archil |title= Gravity is not an entropic force |eprint=1009.5414 |journal= Physical Review D |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luboš Motl]] gives explanations of this position in his blog,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Motl|first1=Luboš|title=Why gravity can't be entropic|url=http://motls.blogspot.ru/2010/01/erik-verlinde-why-gravity-cant-be.html|website=The Reference Frame|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Motl|first1=Luboš|title=Once more: gravity is not an entropic force|url=http://motls.blogspot.ru/2011/08/once-more-gravity-is-not-entropic-force.html|website=The Reference Frame|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Chaichian et al. suggest a potential loophole in the argument in weak gravitational fields such as those affecting Earth-bound experiments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.4650.pdf On Gravity as an Entropic Force ArXiv 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43755">In [[mathematics]], '''fuzzy sets''' (aka '''uncertain sets''') are somewhat like [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] whose [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] have degrees of membership. Fuzzy sets were introduced independently by [[Lotfi Asker Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]]&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Zadeh (1965) [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~zadeh/papers/Fuzzy%20Sets-Information%20and%20Control-1965.pdf "Fuzzy sets"]. ''Information and Control'' 8 (3) 338–353.&lt;/ref&gt; and Dieter Klaua&lt;ref&gt;Klaua, D. (1965) Über einen Ansatz zur mehrwertigen Mengenlehre. Monatsb. Deutsch. Akad. Wiss. Berlin 7, 859–876. A recent in-depth analysis of this paper has been provided by {{Cite journal | last1 = Gottwald | first1 = S. | title = An early approach toward graded identity and graded membership in set theory | doi = 10.1016/j.fss.2009.12.005 | journal = Fuzzy Sets and Systems | volume = 161 | issue = 18 | pages = 2369–2379 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1965 as an extension of the classical notion of set.
At the same time, {{harvtxt|Salii|1965}} defined a more general kind of structure called an [[L-relation]], which he studied in an abstract algebraic context. Fuzzy relations, which are used now in different areas, such as [[linguistics]] {{harv|De Cock|Bodenhofer|Kerre|2000}}, [[Decision making|decision-making]] {{harv|Kuzmin|1982}}, and [[Cluster analysis|clustering]] {{harv|Bezdek|1978}}, are special cases of ''L''-relations when ''L'' is the [[unit interval]] [0, 1].

In classical [[set theory]], the membership of elements in a set is assessed in binary terms according to a [[Principle of bivalence|bivalent condition]] &amp;mdash; an element either belongs or does not belong to the set. By contrast, fuzzy set theory permits the gradual assessment of the membership of elements in a set; this is described with the aid of a [[Membership function (mathematics)|membership function]] valued in the real unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. Fuzzy sets generalize classical sets, since the [[indicator function]]s (aka characteristic functions) of classical sets are special cases of the membership functions of fuzzy sets, if the latter only take values 0 or 1.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;D. Dubois and H. Prade (1988) Fuzzy Sets and Systems. Academic Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In fuzzy set theory, classical bivalent sets are usually called [[Crisp set|''crisp'' sets]]. The fuzzy set theory can be used in a wide range of domains in which information is incomplete or imprecise, such as [[bioinformatics]].&lt;ref&gt;Lily R. Liang, Shiyong Lu, Xuena Wang, Yi Lu, Vinay Mandal, Dorrelyn Patacsil, and Deepak Kumar, "FM-test: A Fuzzy-Set-Theory-Based Approach to Differential Gene Expression Data Analysis", BMC Bioinformatics, 7 (Suppl 4): S7. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

A fuzzy set is a pair &lt;math&gt;(U, m)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a set and &lt;math&gt;m\colon U \rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; a membership function. 
The reference set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes denoted by &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;) is called '''universe of discourse''', and for each &lt;math&gt;x\in U,&lt;/math&gt; the value &lt;math&gt;m(x)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''grade''' of membership of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;(U,m)&lt;/math&gt;. 
The function &lt;math&gt;m = \mu(A)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''membership function''' of the fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A = (U, m)&lt;/math&gt;.

For a finite set &lt;math&gt;U=\{x_1,\dots,x_n\},&lt;/math&gt; the fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;(U, m)&lt;/math&gt; is often denoted by &lt;math&gt;\{m(x_1)/x_1,\dots,m(x_n)/x_n\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;x \in U.&lt;/math&gt; Then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is called 
* '''not included''' in the fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;(U,m)&lt;/math&gt; if {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;m(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;}} (no member), 
* '''fully included''' if {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;m(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;}} (full member), 
* '''partially included''' if {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; m(x) &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; (fuzzy member).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaai.org/aitopics/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AITopics/FuzzyLogic AAAI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805071058/http://www.aaai.org/aitopics/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AITopics/FuzzyLogic |date=2008-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The (crisp) set of all fuzzy sets on a universe &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is denoted with &lt;math&gt;SF(U)&lt;/math&gt; (or sometimes just &lt;math&gt;F(U)&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name="Beg20019" /&gt;

===Crisp sets related to a fuzzy set===
For any fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A = (U,m)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; the following crisp sets are defined:
* &lt;math&gt;A^{\ge\alpha} = A_\alpha = \{x \in U \mid m(x)\ge\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt; is called its '''α-cut''' (aka '''α-level set''') 
* &lt;math&gt;A^{&gt;\alpha} = A'_\alpha = \{x \in U \mid m(x)&gt;\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt; is called its '''strong α-cut''' (aka '''strong α-level set''') 
* &lt;math&gt;S(A) = Supp(A) = A^{&gt;0} = \{x \in U \mid m(x)&gt;0\}&lt;/math&gt; is called its '''support''' 
* &lt;math&gt;C(A) = Core(A) = A^{=1} = \{x \in U \mid m(x)=1\}&lt;/math&gt; is called its '''core''' (or sometimes '''kernel''' &lt;math&gt;Kern(A)&lt;/math&gt;).

Note that some authors understand 'kernel' in a different way, see below.

===Other definitions===
* A fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A = (U,m)&lt;/math&gt; is '''empty''' (&lt;math&gt;A = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;) [[iff]] (if and only if)
::[[Universal quantification#notation|&lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;]]&lt;math&gt; x \in U: \mu_A(x) = m(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

* Two fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are '''equal''' (&lt;math&gt;A = B&lt;/math&gt;) iff
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x \in U: \mu_A(x) = \mu_B(x)&lt;/math&gt;

* A fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is '''included''' in a fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B&lt;/math&gt;) iff
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x \in U: \mu_A(x) \le \mu_B(x)&lt;/math&gt;

* For any fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, any &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt;, having
::&lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x) = 0.5&lt;/math&gt; 
:is called a '''crossover point'''.

* For a given fuzzy set A any &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;A^{=\alpha} = \{x \in U | \mu_A(x) = \alpha\}&lt;/math&gt; is not empty, is called a '''level''' of A. 
The '''level set''' of A is the set of all levels α∈[0,1] representing distinct-cuts. It is the target set (aka codomain) of &lt;math&gt;\mu_A&lt;/math&gt;:
::&lt;math&gt;\Lambda_A = \{\alpha \in [0,1] \mid A^{=\alpha} \ne \varnothing\} = \{\alpha \in [0, 1] \mid\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Existential quantification|&lt;math&gt;\exist&lt;/math&gt;]]&lt;math&gt;x\in{U}: \mu_A(x) = \alpha\} = \mu_A(U)&lt;/math&gt;

* For a fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; its '''height''' is given by
::&lt;math&gt;Hgt(A) = sup \{\mu_A(x) \mid x\in{U}\}  = sup(\mu_A(U))&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;sup&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Infimum and supremum|supremum]], which does exist because 1 is an upper bound. If U is finite, we can simply replace the supremum by the maximum.

* A fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''normalized''' iff
::&lt;math&gt;Hgt(A) = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:In the finite case, where the supremum is a maximum, this means that at least one element of the fuzzy set has full membership. A non-empty fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; may be normalized with result &lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}&lt;/math&gt; by dividing the membership function of the fuzzy set by its height:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{\tilde{A}}(x) = \mu_A(x)/Hgt(A)&lt;/math&gt;
:Besides similarities this differs from the usual [[normalizing constant|normalization]] in that the normalizing constant is not a sum.

* For fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of real numbers (U ⊆ ℝ) having a core with [[Infimum and supremum|an upper and a lower bound]] the '''width''' is defined as
::&lt;math&gt;Width(A) = sup(Supp(A)) - inf(Supp(A))&lt;/math&gt;
:This does always exist for bounded a reference set U, especially if U is finite.
:In case that &lt;math&gt;Supp(A)&lt;/math&gt; is a finite or [[closed set]], the width is just
::&lt;math&gt;Width(A) = max(Supp(A)) - min(Supp(A))&lt;/math&gt;
:In the n-dimensional case (U ⊆ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;) the above can be replaced by the n-dimensional volume of &lt;math&gt;Supp(A)&lt;/math&gt;. 
:In general there must exist some [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] for instance by integration (e. g. [[Lebesgue integration]]) of &lt;math&gt;Supp(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

* A real fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (U ⊆ ℝ) is said to be '''convex''' (in fuzzy sense, not to be confused with a crisp [[convex set]]), iff
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x,y\in{U}, \forall\lambda\in[0,1]: \mu_A(\lambda{x} + (1-\lambda)y) \ge min(\mu_A(x),\mu_A(y))&lt;/math&gt;,
:or (if we assume x≤y, which is no restriction), equivalent, iff
::&lt;math&gt;\forall z \in [x,y]: \mu_A(z) \ge min(\mu_A(x),\mu_A(y))&lt;/math&gt;.
:In general, we may have to choose subsets Z of U and compare like follows:  
::&lt;math&gt;\forall z \in Z: \mu_A(z) \ge inf(\mu_A(\partial{Z}))&lt;/math&gt;,
:where &lt;math&gt;\partial{Z}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] of Z and &lt;math&gt;f(X) = \{f(x)|x \in X\}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Function (mathematics)#Image and preimage|image]] of a set ''X'' (here &lt;math&gt;\partial{Z}&lt;/math&gt;) under a function ''f'' (here &lt;math&gt;\mu_A&lt;/math&gt;).

===Fuzzy set operations===
{{main|Fuzzy set operations}}
In contrast to the complement of a fuzzy set, for which there is a very common definition, union and intersection do have some ambiguity.
* For a given fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; its '''complement''' &lt;math&gt;\neg{A}&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes denoted as &lt;math&gt;A^c&lt;/math&gt; or '''∁'''&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;) is defined by the following membership function:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{\neg{A}}(x) = 1 - \mu_A(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

* Let t be a [[t-norm]], and s the corresponding s-norm (aka t-conorm). For given fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; their '''intersection''' &lt;math&gt;A\cap{B}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\cap{B}}(x) = t(\mu_A(x),\mu_B(x))&lt;/math&gt;,
:and their '''union''' &lt;math&gt;A\cup{B}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\cup{B}}(x) = s(\mu_A(x),\mu_B(x))&lt;/math&gt;.

According to the definitions of t-norms, fuzzy sets inherit laws as [[Commutativity]], [[Monotonicity]], [[Associativity]] and for null and identity element (∅ and U, respectively). However, the union of a fuzzy set and its complement may not result in the full universe U, and the intersection of them may not give the empty set ∅. Intersection and union of a finite [[Indexed family|family]] of fuzzy sets can be defined by recursion, keeping associativity law in mind.

* If the standard negator &lt;math&gt;n(\alpha) = 1 - \alpha, \alpha \in [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by another [[t-norm#Non-standard negators|strong negator]], the fuzzy set difference may be generalized by
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{\neg{A}}(x) = n(\mu_A(x))&lt;/math&gt;. 
:The tripel of fuzzy intersection, union and complement build up a '''De Morgan Triplet''. Examples for fuzzy intersection/union pairs with standard negator can be derived from samples provided in the article about [[t-norm]]s.

:The fuzzy intersection is not idempotent in general, because the standard t-norm min is the only one which has this property. Using arithmetic multiplication a t-norm instead, this defines a specific fuzzy intersection operation not being idempotent. By this, iterating multiplication of a fuzzy set with itself is not trivial. It defines the '''m-th power''' of a fuzzy set which can be canonically generalized for non-integer exponents in the following way:

* For any fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu \in \R^+&lt;/math&gt; the ν-th power of A is defined by its membership function as follows:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A^{\nu}}(x) = \mu_{A}(x)^{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;
:Special case: Exponent is 2 (quadrature): For any fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; the '''concentration''' &lt;math&gt;CON(A) = A^2&lt;/math&gt; is defined via its membership function as follows:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{CON(A)}(x) = \mu_{A^2}(x) = \mu_{A}(x)^2&lt;/math&gt;
:With &lt;math&gt;0^0 := 1&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;A^0 = U&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A^1 = A&lt;/math&gt;.

* For given fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; the fuzzy set '''Difference''' &lt;math&gt;A \setminus B&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes denoted just &lt;math&gt; A - B&lt;/math&gt;) maybe defined straightforward via membership functions:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\setminus{B}}(x) = t(\mu_A(x),n(\mu_B(x)))&lt;/math&gt;,
:which means &lt;math&gt;A \setminus B = A \cap \neg{B}&lt;/math&gt;, e. g.:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\setminus{B}}(x) = min(\mu_A(x),1 - \mu_B(x))&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Mamoni Dhar: [http://www.sersc.org/journals/IJEIC/vol4_Is1/2.pdf Cardinality of Fuzzy Sets: An Overview], International Journal of Energy, Information and Communications Vol. 4, Issue 1, February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vemuri2014"&gt;N.R.

::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A-{B}}(x) = \mu_A(x) - t(\mu_A(x),\mu_B(x))&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Vemuri2014" /&gt;

* Proposals for symmetric fuzzy set differences have been done by Dubois and Prade (1980), either using the absulute:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\triangle{B}}(x) = |\mu_A(x) - \mu_B(x)|&lt;/math&gt;
:or, using a combination of just max, min, and standard negation:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\triangle{B}}(x) = max(min(\mu_A(x), 1 - \mu_B(x)), \,min(\mu_B(x), 1 - \mu_A(x)))&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Vemuri2014" /&gt;

:Axioms for definition of generalized symmetric differences analog to those for t-norms, t-conorms, and negators have been proposed by Vemur et al. (2014) with predecessors by Alsina et. al. (2005) and Bedregal et. al. (2009).&lt;ref name="Vemuri2014" /&gt;

* In contrast to crisp sets averaging operations can also be defined for fuzzy sets.

===Disjoint fuzzy sets===
In contrast to the general ambiguity of intersection and union operations, there is clearness for disjoint fuzzy sets:
Two fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; are '''disjoint''' iff
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_A(x) = 0 \lor \mu_B(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
which is equivalent to
:[[Existential quantification#Negation|&lt;math&gt;\nexists&lt;/math&gt;]] &lt;math&gt;x\in{U}: \mu_A(x) &gt; 0 \land \mu_B(x) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
and also equivalent to 
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: min(\mu_A(x),\mu_B(x)) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
We keep in mind that min/max is a t/s-norm pair, and any other will do the job here as well.

Fuzzy sets are disjoint, iff their supports are disjoint according to the standard definition for crisp sets.

For disjoint fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; any intersection will give ∅, and any union will give the same result, which is denoted as
:&lt;math&gt;A \dot{\cup} B = A \cup B&lt;/math&gt; 
with its membership function given by
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\dot{\cup}{B}}(x) = \mu_A(x) + \mu_B(x)&lt;/math&gt;
Note that only one of both summands is greater than zero.

For disjoint fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; the following holds true:
:&lt;math&gt;Supp(A \dot{\cup} B) = Supp(A) \,\dot{\cup}\, Supp(B)&lt;/math&gt;

This can be generalized to finite families of fuzzy sets as follows:
Given a family &lt;math&gt;A = (A_i)_{i\in{I}}&lt;/math&gt; of fuzzy sets with Index set I (e.g. I = {1,2,3,...n}). This family is '''(pairwise) disjoint''' iff
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}\,\exists i\in{I}: \mu_{A_i}(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

A family of fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A = (A_i)_{i\in{I}}&lt;/math&gt; is disjoint, iff the family of underlying supports &lt;math&gt;Supp \circ A = (Supp(A_i))_{i\in{I}}&lt;/math&gt; is disjoint in the standard sense for families of crisp sets.

Independend of the t/s-norm pair, intersection of a disjoint family of fuzzy sets will give ∅ again, while the union has no ambiguity:
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\bigcup\limits_{i\in{I}}} A_i = \bigcup_{i\in{I}} A_i&lt;/math&gt; 
with its membership function given by
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{\dot{\bigcup\limits_{i\in{I}}} A_i}(x) = \sum_{i\in{I}} \mu_{A_i}(x)&lt;/math&gt;
Again only one of the summands is greater than zero.

For disjoint families of fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A = (A_i)_{i\in{I}}&lt;/math&gt; the following holds true:
:&lt;math&gt;Supp(\dot{\bigcup\limits_{i\in{I}}} A_i) = \dot{\bigcup\limits_{i\in{I}}} Supp(A_i)&lt;/math&gt;

===Scalar Cardinality===
For a fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; with finite &lt;math&gt;Supp(A)&lt;/math&gt; (i. e. a 'finite fuzzy set'), its '''cardinality''' (aka '''scalar cardinality''' or '''sigma-count''') is given by
:&lt;math&gt;Card(A) = sc(A) = |A| = \sum_{x\in{U}} \mu_A(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
In case that U itself is a finite set, the '''relative cardinality''' is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;RelCard(A) = ||A|| = sc(A)/|U| = |A|/|U|&lt;/math&gt;.
This can be generalized for the divisor to be an non-empty fuzzy set: For fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A,G&lt;/math&gt; with G ≠ ∅, we can define the '''relative cardinality''' by:
:&lt;math&gt;RelCard(A,G) = sc(A|G) = sc(A\cap{G})/sc(G)&lt;/math&gt;,
which looks very similar to the expression for [[conditional probability]]&lt;!--and because of that, sc(A|G) is used instead of sc(A/G)- this in't **set** division, isn't it? --&gt;.
Note:
* &lt;math&gt;sc(G) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; here.
* The result may depend on the specific intersection (t-norm) chosen. 
* For &lt;math&gt;G = U&lt;/math&gt; the result is unambiguous and resembles the prior definition.

===Distance and Similarity===
For any fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; the membership function &lt;math&gt;\mu_A: U \to U&lt;/math&gt; can be regarded as a family &lt;math&gt;\mu_A = (\mu_A(x))_{x\in{U}} \in [0,1]^U&lt;/math&gt;. The latter is a [[metric space]] with several metrics &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; known. A metric can be derived from a [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] (vector norm) &lt;math&gt;\|\,\|&lt;/math&gt; via
:&lt;math&gt;d(\alpha,\beta) = \| \alpha - \beta \,\|&lt;/math&gt;.
For instance, if &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is finite, i. e. &lt;math&gt;U = \{x_1, x_2, ... x_n\}&lt;/math&gt;, such a metric may be defined by: 
:&lt;math&gt;d(\alpha,\beta) := max \{ |\alpha(x_i) - \beta(x_i)| \bigl\vert i=1..n \}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are sequences of real numbes between 0 and 1. 
For infinite &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, the maximum can be replaced by a supremum. 
Because fuzzy sets are unambiguously defined by their membership function, this metric can be used to measure distances between fuzzy sets on the same universe:
:&lt;math&gt;d(A,B) := d(\mu_A,\mu_B)&lt;/math&gt;,
which becomes in the above sample:
:&lt;math&gt;d(A,B) = max \{ |\mu_A(x_i) - \mu_B(x_i)| \bigl\vert i=1..n \}&lt;/math&gt;
Again for infinite &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; the maximum must be replaced by a supremum. Other distances (like the canonical 2-norm) may diverge, if infinite fuzzy sets are too different, e .g &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarity measures (here denoted by &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;) may then be derived from the distance, e. g. after a proposal by Koczy:
:&lt;math&gt;S = 1 / (1 + d(A,B))&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;d(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; is finite, &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; else, 
or after Williams an Steele:
:&lt;math&gt;S = exp(-\alpha{d(A,B)})&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;d(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; is finite, &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; else
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; is a steepness parameter and &lt;math&gt;exp(x) = e^x&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Beg20019"&gt;Ismat Beg, Samina Ashraf: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228744370_Similarity_measures_for_fuzzy_sets Similarity measures for fuzzy sets], at: Applied and Computational Mathematics, March 2009, available on Research Gate since November 23rd, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition for interval valued (rather 'fuzzy') similarity measures &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; is provided by Beg and Ashraf as well.&lt;ref name="Beg20019" /&gt;

===L-fuzzy sets===
Sometimes, more general variants of the notion of fuzzy set are used, with membership functions taking values in a (fixed or variable) [[algebraic structure|algebra]] or [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of a given kind; usually it is required that &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be at least a [[poset]] or [[lattice (order)|lattice]]. These are usually called '''''L''-fuzzy sets''', to distinguish them from those valued over the unit interval. The usual membership functions with values in [0,&amp;nbsp;1] are then called [0,&amp;nbsp;1]-valued membership functions. These kinds of generalizations were first considered in 1967 by [[Joseph Goguen]], who was a student of Zadeh.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Goguen|Goguen, Joseph A.]], 196, "''L''-fuzzy sets". ''Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications'' '''18''': 145–174&lt;/ref&gt; A classical corollary may be indicating truth and membership values by {f,t} instead of {0,1}.

An extension of fuzzy sets has been provided by Atanassov and Baruah. An '''intuitionistic fuzzy set''' (IFS) &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is characterized by two functions:
:1. &lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x)&lt;/math&gt; - degree of membership of x
:2. &lt;math&gt;\nu_A(x)&lt;/math&gt; - degree of non-membership of x
with functions &lt;math&gt;\mu_A, \nu_A: U \mapsto [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in U: \mu_A(x) + \nu_A(x) \le 1&lt;/math&gt;

This resembles a situation like some person denoted by &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; voting 
* for a proposal A (&lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x)=1, \nu_A(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;), 
* against it (&lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x)=0, \nu_A(x)=1&lt;/math&gt;), 
* or abstain from voting (&lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x)=\nu_A(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;).
After all, we have a percentage of approvals, a percentage of denials, and a percentage of abstentions.

For this situation, special 'intuitive fuzzy' negators, t- and s-norms can be provided. 
With &lt;math&gt;D^* = \{(\alpha,\beta) \in [0, 1]^2 \mid \alpha + \beta = 1 \}&lt;/math&gt; and by combining both functions to &lt;math&gt;(\mu_A,\nu_A): U \to D^*&lt;/math&gt; this situation resembles a special kind of L-fuzzy sets.

Once more, this has been expanded by defining '''picture fuzzy sets''' (PFS) as follows: A PFS A is characterized by three functions mapping U to [0, 1]: &lt;math&gt;\mu_A, \eta_A, \nu_A&lt;/math&gt;, 'degree of positive membership', 'degree of neutral membership', and 'degree of negative membership' respectively and additional condition &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in U: \mu_A(x) + \eta_A(x) + \nu_A(x) \le 1&lt;/math&gt;
This expands the voting sample above by an additional possibility 'refusal of voting'.

With &lt;math&gt;D^* = \{(\alpha,\beta,\gamma) \in [0, 1]^3 \mid \alpha + \beta + \gamma = 1 \}&lt;/math&gt; and special 'picture fuzzy' negators, t- and s-norms this resembles just another type of L-fuzzy sets.&lt;ref&gt;Bui Cong Cuong, Vladik Kreinovich, Roan Thi Ngan: [http://digitalcommons.utep.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2050&amp;context=cs_techrep A classification of representable t-norm operators for picture fuzzy sets], in: Departmental Technical Reports (CS).

== Fuzzy logic ==
{{main|Fuzzy logic}}

As an extension of the case of [[multi-valued logic]], valuations (&lt;math&gt;\mu : \mathit{V}_o \to \mathit{W}&lt;/math&gt;) of [[propositional variable]]s (&lt;math&gt;\mathit{V}_o&lt;/math&gt;) into a set of membership degrees (&lt;math&gt;\mathit{W}&lt;/math&gt;) can be thought of as [[membership function (mathematics)|membership functions]] mapping [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] into fuzzy sets (or more formally, into an ordered set of fuzzy pairs, called a fuzzy relation).  With these valuations, many-valued logic can be extended to allow for fuzzy [[premise]]s from which graded conclusions may be drawn.&lt;ref&gt;[[Siegfried Gottwald]], 2001. ''A Treatise on Many-Valued Logics''. Baldock, Hertfordshire, England: Research Studies Press Ltd., {{ISBN|978-0-86380-262-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This extension is sometimes called "fuzzy logic in the narrow sense" as opposed to "fuzzy logic in the wider sense," which originated in the [[engineering]] fields of [[automation|automated]] control and [[knowledge engineering]], and which encompasses many topics involving fuzzy sets and "approximated reasoning."&lt;ref&gt;"The concept of a linguistic variable and its application to approximate reasoning," ''Information Sciences'' '''8''': 199–249, 301–357; '''9''': 43–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Industrial applications of fuzzy sets in the context of "fuzzy logic in the wider sense" can be found at [[fuzzy logic]].

== Fuzzy number and interval ==
{{main|Fuzzy number}}
A '''fuzzy number''' is a convex, normalized fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;{\mathit{A}}\subseteq\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; of real numbers (U ⊆ ℝ) whose membership function is at least segmentally [[continuous function|continuous]]{{Clarify|date=September 2017}} and has the functional value &lt;math&gt;\mu_{A}(x)=1&lt;/math&gt; at at least one element.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because of the assumed convexity the maximum (of 1) is 
* either an interval: '''fuzzy interval''', its core is a crisp interval (mean interval) with lower bound

::&lt;math&gt;\min \,C(A) = \min(\{x \in \R \mid \mu_A(x)=1\})&lt;/math&gt; 
:and upper bound 
::&lt;math&gt;\max \,C(A) = \max(\{x \in \R \mid \mu_A(x)=1\})&lt;/math&gt;.
* or unique: '''fuzzy number''', its core is a [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]]; the location of the maximum is 
::℩ C(A) = ℩&lt;math&gt;x \in \R : \mu_A(x)=1&lt;/math&gt; (where ℩ reads as '[[Definite description#Mathematical logic|this]]');
:which will assign a 'sharp' number to the fuzzy number, in addition to fuzzyness parameters like &lt;math&gt;Width(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

Fuzzy numbers can be likened to the [[funfair]] game "guess your weight," where someone guesses the contestant's weight, with closer guesses being more correct, and where the guesser "wins" if he or she guesses near enough to the contestant's weight, with the actual weight being completely correct (mapping to 1 by the membership function).

A '''fuzzy interval''' is a fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;{\mathit{A}}\subseteq\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; with a core interval, i. e. a mean interval whose elements possess the membership function value &lt;math&gt;\mu_{A}(x)=1&lt;/math&gt;.
The latter means that fuzzy intervals are normalized fuzzy sets. As in fuzzy numbers, the membership function must be convex, normalized, at least segmentally [[continuous function|continuous]].&lt;ref&gt;"Fuzzy sets as a basis for a theory of possibility," ''Fuzzy Sets and Systems'' '''1''': 3&amp;ndash;28&lt;/ref&gt; Like crisp intervals, fuzzy intervals may reach infinity. The kernel &lt;math&gt;K(A) = Kern(A)&lt;/math&gt; of a fuzzy interval &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the 'inner' part, without the 'outbound' parts where the membership value is constant ad infinitum. In other words, the smallest subset of &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x)&lt;/math&gt; is constant outside of it, is defined as the kernel.

However, there are other concepts of fuzzy numbers and intervals as some authors do not insist on convexity.

==Fuzzy categories==
The use of [[Set theory|set membership]] as a key components of [[category theory]] can be generalized to fuzzy sets. This approach which initiated in 1968 shortly after the introduction of fuzzy set theory&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Goguen "Categories of fuzzy sets : applications of non-Cantorian set theory" PhD Thesis University of California, Berkeley, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; led to the development of "Goguen categories" in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Winter "Goguen Categories:A Categorical Approach to L-fuzzy Relations"  2007 [[Springer Verlag|Springer]] {{ISBN|9781402061639}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=goguencateg&gt;Michael Winter "Representation theory of Goguen categories" [[Fuzzy Sets and Systems]] Volume 138, Issue 1, 16 August 2003, Pages 85–126&lt;/ref&gt; In these categories, rather than using two valued set membership, more general intervals are used, and may be lattices as in  L-fuzzy sets.&lt;ref name=goguencateg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goguen, J.A., "L-fuzzy sets". Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications 18(1):145–174, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fuzzy relation equation ==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
The [[fuzzy relation equation]] is an equation of the form {{nowrap|1=''A'' · ''R'' = ''B''}}, where ''A'' and ''B'' are fuzzy sets, ''R'' is a fuzzy relation, and {{nowrap|''A'' · ''R''}} stands for the [[Function composition|composition]] of ''A'' with&amp;nbsp;''R'' {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

==Entropy==
A measure d of fuzzyness for fuzzy sets of universe &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; should fulfill the following conditions for all &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt;:
#&lt;math&gt;d(A) = 0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a crisp set: &lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x) \in \{0,\,1\}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;d(A)&lt;/math&gt; has a unique maximum iff &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in U: \mu_A(x) = 0.5&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;d(A) \ge d(B)&lt;/math&gt; iff 
:::&lt;math&gt;\mu_a(x) \le \mu_B(x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x) \le 0.5&lt;/math&gt; and 
:::&lt;math&gt;\mu_a(x) \ge \mu_B(x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x) \ge 0.5&lt;/math&gt;, 
::which means that B is 'crisper' than A.
#&lt;math&gt;d(\neg{A}) = d(A)&lt;/math&gt;   
In this case &lt;math&gt;d(A)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''entropy''' of the fuzzy set A.

For '''finite''' &lt;math&gt;U = \{x_1, x_2, ... x_n\}&lt;/math&gt; the entropy of a fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;d(A) = H(A) + H(\neg{A})&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt;H(A) = -k \sum_{i=1}^n \mu_A(x_i) \ln \mu_A(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;
or just
:&lt;math&gt;d(A) = -k \sum_{i=1}^n S(\mu_A(x_i))&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;S(x) = H_e(x)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Binary entropy function|Shannon's function]] (natural entropy function)
:&lt;math&gt;S(\alpha) = -\alpha \ln \alpha - (1-\alpha) \ln (1-\alpha), \alpha \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a constant depending on the measure unit and the logarithm base ([[e (mathematical constant)|here: e]]) used.
Physical interpretation of k is the [[Boltzmann constant]] k&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a fuzzy set with a '''continuous''' membership function (fuzzy variable). Then 
:&lt;math&gt;H(A) = -k \int_{- \infty}^\infty \operatorname{Cr} \lbrace A \geq t \rbrace \ln \operatorname{Cr} \lbrace A \geq t \rbrace \,dt&lt;/math&gt;
and its entropy is 
:&lt;math&gt;d(A) = -k \int_{- \infty}^\infty S(\operatorname{Cr} \lbrace A \geq t \rbrace )\,dt&lt;/math&gt;

==Extensions==
There are many mathematical constructions similar to or more general than fuzzy sets. Since fuzzy sets were introduced in 1965, a lot of new mathematical constructions and theories treating imprecision, inexactness, ambiguity, and uncertainty have been developed. Some of these constructions and theories are extensions of fuzzy set theory, while others try to mathematically model imprecision and uncertainty in a different way ({{harvnb|Burgin|Chunihin|1997}}; {{harvnb|Kerre|2001}}; Deschrijver and Kerre, 2003).

In [[thermodynamics]], the '''Helmholtz free energy''' is a [[thermodynamic potential]] that measures the useful [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] obtainable from a [[closed system|closed]] [[thermodynamic system]] at a constant [[temperature]] and [[volume]]. The negative of the change in the Helmholtz energy during a process is equal to the maximum amount of work that the system can perform in a thermodynamic process in which volume is held constant. If the volume were not held constant, part of this work would be performed as boundary work. This makes the Helmholtz energy useful for systems held at constant volume. Furthermore, at constant temperature, the Helmholtz energy is minimized at equilibrium.

In contrast, the [[Gibbs free energy]] or free enthalpy is most commonly used as a measure of thermodynamic potential (especially in [[chemistry]]) when it is inconvenient for applications that do not occur at constant pressure.  For example, in [[explosives]] research Helmholtz free energy is often used, since explosive reactions by their nature induce pressure changes. It is also frequently used to define fundamental [[equation of state|equations of state]] of pure substances.

The concept of free energy was developed by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], a German physician and physicist, and first presented in 1882 in a lecture called "On the thermodynamics of chemical processes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = von Helmholtz, H. | date = 1882 | title = Physical memoirs, selected and translated from foreign sources | publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the German word ''Arbeit'' (work), the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) recommends the symbol ''A'' and the name ''Helmholtz energy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Gold Book | publisher = [[IUPAC]] | url = http://goldbook.iupac.org/H02772.html | accessdate = 2012-08-19 | doi=10.1351/goldbook}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[physics]], the symbol ''F'' is also used in reference to ''free energy'' or ''Helmholtz function''.

==Definition==
The Helmholtz energy is defined as&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Ira. N. (1978). "''Physical Chemistry''" McGraw-Hill: University of Brooklyn.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A \equiv U- TS,&lt;/math&gt;

where

: ''A'' is the Helmholtz free energy ([[SI]]: [[joule]]s, [[Centimetre–gram–second system of units|CGS]]: [[erg]]s),
: ''U'' is the [[internal energy]] of the system (SI: joules, CGS: ergs),
: ''T'' is the absolute temperature ([[kelvin]]s) of the surroundings, modelled as a heat bath,
: ''S'' is the [[entropy]] of the system (SI: joules per kelvin, CGS: ergs per kelvin).

The Helmholtz energy is the [[Legendre transformation|Legendre transformation]] of the internal energy ''U'', in which temperature replaces entropy as the independent variable.

==Formal development==
The [[first law of thermodynamics]] in a closed system provides
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U = \delta Q\ + \delta W,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is the internal energy, &lt;math&gt;\delta Q&lt;/math&gt; is the energy added as heat, and &lt;math&gt;\delta W&lt;/math&gt; is the work done on the system. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] for a [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]] yields &lt;math&gt;\delta Q = T\,\mathrm{d}S&lt;/math&gt;. In case of a reversible change, the work done can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;\delta W = -p\,\mathrm{d}V&lt;/math&gt; (ignoring electrical and other non-''PV'' work):
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U = T\,\mathrm{d}S - p\,\mathrm{d}V.&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the product rule for differentiation to d(''TS'') = ''T'' d''S'' + ''S'' d''T'', it follows
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U = \mathrm{d}(TS) - S\,\mathrm{d}T - p\,\mathrm{d}V,&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}(U - TS) = -S\,\mathrm{d}T - p\,\mathrm{d}V.&lt;/math&gt;

The definition of ''A'' = ''U'' − ''TS'' enables to rewrite this as 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}A = -S\,\mathrm{d}T - p\,\mathrm{d}V.&lt;/math&gt;

Because ''A'' is a thermodynamic [[Functions of state|function of state]], this [[fundamental thermodynamic relation|relation]] is also valid for a process (without electrical work or composition change) that is not reversible, as long as the system pressure and temperature are uniform.&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Rohr2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidt-Rohr | first1 = K. | year = 2014 | title = Expansion Work without the External Pressure, and Thermodynamics in Terms of Quasistatic Irreversible Processes | doi = 10.1021/ed3008704 | journal = J. Chem. Educ. | volume = 91 | issue = | pages = 402–409 | bibcode = 2014JChEd..91..402S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minimum free energy and maximum work principles==
The laws of thermodynamics are most easily applicable to systems undergoing reversible processes or processes that begin and end in thermal equilibrium, although irreversible quasistatic processes or spontaneous processes in systems with uniform temperature and pressure (u''PT'' processes) can also be analyzed&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Rohr2014" /&gt; based on the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]] as shown further below. First, if we wish to describe phenomena like chemical reactions, it may be convenient to consider suitably chosen initial and final states in which the system is in (metastable) thermal equilibrium. If the system is kept at fixed volume and is in contact with a heat bath at some constant temperature, then we can reason as follows.

Since the thermodynamical variables of the system are well defined in the initial state and the final state, the internal energy increase &lt;math&gt;\Delta U&lt;/math&gt;, the [[entropy]] increase &lt;math&gt;\Delta S&lt;/math&gt;, and the total amount of work that can be extracted, performed by the system, &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, are well defined quantities. Conservation of energy implies

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U_\text{bath} + \Delta U + W = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The volume of the system is kept constant. This means that the volume of the heat bath does not change either, and we can conclude that the heat bath does not perform any work. This implies that the amount of heat that flows into the heat bath is given by

:&lt;math&gt;Q_\text{bath} = \Delta U_\text{bath} = -(\Delta U + W).&lt;/math&gt;

The heat bath remains in thermal equilibrium at temperature ''T'' no matter what the system does. Therefore, the entropy change of the heat bath is

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta S_\text{bath} = \frac{Q_\text{bath}}{T} = -\frac{\Delta U + W}{T}.&lt;/math&gt;

The total entropy change is thus given by

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta S_\text{bath} + \Delta S = -\frac{\Delta U - T\Delta S + W}{T}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the system is in thermal equilibrium with the heat bath in the initial and the final states, ''T'' is also the temperature of the system in these states. The fact that the system's temperature does not change allows us to express the numerator as the free energy change of the system:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta S_\text{bath} + \Delta S = -\frac{\Delta A + W}{T}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the total change in entropy must always be larger or equal to zero, we obtain the inequality

:&lt;math&gt;W \leq -\Delta A.&lt;/math&gt;

We see that the total amount of work that can be extracted in an isothermal process is limited by the free-energy decrease, and that increasing the free energy in a reversible process requires work to be done on the system. If no work is extracted from the system, then

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta A \leq 0,&lt;/math&gt;

and thus for a system kept at constant temperature and volume and not capable of performing electrical or other non-''PV'' work, the total free energy during a spontaneous change can only decrease.

This result seems to contradict the equation d''A'' = −''S'' d''T'' − ''P'' d''V'', as keeping ''T'' and ''V'' constant seems to imply d''A'' = 0, and hence ''A'' = constant. In reality there is no contradiction: In a simple one-component system, to which the validity of the equation d''A'' = −''S'' d''T'' − ''P'' d''V'' is restricted, no process can occur at constant ''T'' and ''V'', since there is a unique ''P''(''T'', ''V'') relation, and thus ''T'', ''V'', and ''P'' are all fixed. To allow for spontaneous processes at constant ''T'' and ''V'', one needs to enlarge the thermodynamical state space of the system. In case of a chemical reaction, one must allow for changes in the numbers ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; of particles of each type ''j''. The differential of the free energy then generalizes to

:&lt;math&gt;dA = -S\,dT - p\,dV + \sum_j \mu_j\,dN_j,&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;N_j&lt;/math&gt; are the numbers of particles of type ''j'', and the  &lt;math&gt;\mu_j&lt;/math&gt; are the corresponding [[chemical potential]]s. This equation is then again valid for both reversible and non-reversible u''PT''&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Rohr2014" /&gt; changes. In case of a spontaneous change at constant ''T'' and ''V'' without electrical work, the last term will thus be negative.

In case there are other external parameters, the above [[fundamental thermodynamic relation|relation]] further generalizes to

:&lt;math&gt;dA = -S\,dT - \sum_i X_i\,dx_i + \sum_j \mu_j\,dN_j.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; are the external variables, and the &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; the corresponding [[generalized forces]].

==Relation to the canonical partition function==
A system kept at constant volume, temperature, and particle number is described by the [[canonical ensemble]]. The probability to find the system in some energy eigenstate ''r'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;P_r = \frac{e^{-\beta E_r}}{Z},&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\beta \equiv \frac{1}{k T},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_r = \text{energy of eigenstate }r,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z = \sum_r e^{-\beta E_r}.&lt;/math&gt;

''Z'' is called the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] of the system. The fact that the system does not have a unique energy means that the various thermodynamical quantities must be defined as expectation values. In the thermodynamical limit of infinite system size, the relative fluctuations in these averages will go to zero.

The average internal energy of the system is the expectation value of the energy and can be expressed in terms of ''Z'' as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;U \equiv \langle E \rangle = \sum_r P_r E_r = -\frac{\partial \log Z}{\partial \beta}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the system is in state ''r'', then the generalized force corresponding to an external variable ''x'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;X_r = -\frac{\partial E_r}{\partial x}.&lt;/math&gt;

The thermal average of this can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;X = \sum_r P_r X_r = \frac{1}{\beta} \frac{\partial \log Z}{\partial x}.&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose that the system has one external variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Then changing the system's temperature parameter by &lt;math&gt;d\beta&lt;/math&gt; and the external variable by &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; will lead to a change in &lt;math&gt;\log Z&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;d(\log Z) = \frac{\partial\log Z}{\partial\beta}\,d\beta + \frac{\partial\log Z}{\partial x}\,dx = -U\,d\beta + \beta X\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

If we write &lt;math&gt;U\,d\beta&lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;U\,d\beta = d(\beta U) - \beta\, dU,&lt;/math&gt;

we get

:&lt;math&gt;d(\log Z) = -d(\beta U) + \beta\, dU + \beta X \,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the change in the internal energy is given by

:&lt;math&gt;dU = \frac{1}{\beta}\,d(\log Z + \beta U) - X\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

In the thermodynamic limit, the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]] should hold:

:&lt;math&gt;dU = T\, dS - X\, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

This then implies that the entropy of the system is given by

:&lt;math&gt;S = k\log Z + \frac{U}{T} + c,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is some constant. The value of ''c'' can be determined by considering the limit ''T'' → 0. In this limit the entropy becomes &lt;math&gt;S = k \log \Omega_0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Omega_0&lt;/math&gt; is the ground-state degeneracy. The partition function in this limit is &lt;math&gt;\Omega_0 e^{-\beta U_0}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;U_0&lt;/math&gt; is the ground-state energy. Thus, we see that &lt;math&gt;c = 0&lt;/math&gt; and that

:&lt;math&gt;A = -kT\log Z.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Relating free energy to other variables ===

Combining the definition of Helmholtz free energy

:&lt;math&gt;A = U - T S&lt;/math&gt;

along with the fundamental thermodynamic relation

&lt;math&gt;dA = -S\,dT - P\,dV + \mu\,dN,&lt;/math&gt;

one can find expressions for entropy, pressure and chemical potential:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theory.physics.manchester.ac.uk/~judith/stat_therm/node70.html|title=4.3 Entropy, Helmholtz Free Energy and the Partition Function|website=theory.physics.manchester.ac.uk|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S = -\bigg( \frac{\partial A}{\partial T} \bigg) \bigg|_{V,N}, \quad
P = -\bigg( \frac{\partial A}{\partial V} \bigg) \bigg|_{T,N}, \quad
\mu = \bigg( \frac{\partial A}{\partial N} \bigg) \bigg|_{T,V}.&lt;/math&gt;

These three equations, along with the free energy in terms of the partition function,

:&lt;math&gt;A = -kT\log Z,&lt;/math&gt;

allow an efficient way of calculating thermodynamic variables of interest given the partition function and are often used in density of state calculations. One can also do [[Legendre transformation]]s for different systems.  For example, for a system with a magnetic field or potential, it is true that

:&lt;math&gt;m = -\bigg( \frac{\partial A}{\partial B} \bigg) \bigg|_{T,N}, \quad
V = \bigg ( \frac{\partial A}{\partial Q} \bigg) \bigg|_{N,T}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Bogoliubov inequality==
Computing the free energy is an intractable problem for all but the simplest models in statistical physics. A powerful approximation method is [[mean-field theory]], which is a variational method based on the Bogoliubov inequality. This inequality can be formulated as follows.

Suppose we replace the real Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; of the model by a trial Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt;, which has different interactions and may depend on extra parameters that are not present in the original model. If we choose this trial Hamiltonian such that

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle\tilde{H}\right\rangle = \langle H \rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

where both averages are taken with respect to the canonical distribution defined by the trial Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;A \leq \tilde{A},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the free energy of the original Hamiltonian, and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}&lt;/math&gt; is the free energy of the trial Hamiltonian. By including a large number of parameters in the trial Hamiltonian and minimizing the free energy, we can expect to get a close approximation to the exact free energy.

The Bogoliubov inequality is often formulated in a slightly different but equivalent way. If we write the Hamiltonian as

:&lt;math&gt;H = H_0 + \Delta H,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is exactly solvable, then we can apply the above inequality by defining

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{H} = H_0 + \langle\Delta H\rangle_0.&lt;/math&gt;

Here we have defined &lt;math&gt;\langle X\rangle_0&lt;/math&gt; to be the average of ''X'' over the canonical ensemble defined by &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt; defined this way differs from &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; by a constant, we have in general

:&lt;math&gt;\langle X\rangle_0 = \langle X\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle\tilde{H}\right\rangle = \big\langle H_0 + \langle\Delta H\rangle \big\rangle = \langle H\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

and thus the inequality

:&lt;math&gt;A \leq \tilde{A}&lt;/math&gt;

holds. The free energy &lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}&lt;/math&gt; is the free energy of the model defined by &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; plus &lt;math&gt;\langle\Delta H\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. This means that

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{A} = \langle H_0\rangle_0 - T S_0 + \langle\Delta H\rangle_0 = \langle H\rangle_0 - T S_0,&lt;/math&gt;

and thus

:&lt;math&gt;A \leq \langle H\rangle_0 - T S_0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Proof===

For a classical model we can prove the Bogoliubov inequality as follows. We denote the canonical probability distributions for the Hamiltonian and the trial Hamiltonian by &lt;math&gt;P_{r}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{P}_{r}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. From [[Gibbs' inequality]] we know that:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{r} \tilde{P}_{r}\log\left(\tilde{P}_{r}\right)\geq \sum_{r} \tilde{P}_{r}\log\left(P_{r}\right) \,&lt;/math&gt;

holds. To see this, consider the difference between the left hand side and the right hand side. We can write this as:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{r} \tilde{P}_{r}\log\left(\frac{\tilde{P}_{r}}{P_{r}}\right) \,&lt;/math&gt;

Since

:&lt;math&gt;\log\left(x\right)\geq 1 - \frac{1}{x}\,&lt;/math&gt;

it follows that:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{r} \tilde{P}_{r}\log\left(\frac{\tilde{P}_{r}}{P_{r}}\right)\geq \sum_{r}\left(\tilde{P}_{r} - P_{r}\right) = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

where in the last step we have used that both probability distributions are normalized to 1.

We can write the inequality as:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle\log\left(\tilde{P}_{r}\right)\right\rangle\geq \left\langle\log\left(P_{r}\right)\right\rangle\,&lt;/math&gt;

where the averages are taken with respect to &lt;math&gt;\tilde{P}_{r}&lt;/math&gt;. If we now substitute in here the expressions for the probability distributions:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{r}=\frac{\exp\left[-\beta H\left(r\right)\right]}{Z}\,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{P}_{r}=\frac{\exp\left[-\beta\tilde{H}\left(r\right)\right]}{\tilde{Z}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle -\beta \tilde{H} - \log\left(\tilde{Z}\right)\right\rangle\geq \left\langle -\beta H - \log\left(Z\right)\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

Since the averages of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt; are, by assumption, identical we have:

:&lt;math&gt;A\leq\tilde{A}&lt;/math&gt;

Here we have used that the partition functions are constants with respect to taking averages and that the free energy is proportional to minus the logarithm of the partition function.

We can easily generalize this proof to the case of quantum mechanical models. We denote the eigenstates of &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\left|r\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. We denote the diagonal components of the density matrices for the canonical distributions for &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt; in this basis as:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{r}=\left\langle r\left|\frac{\exp\left[-\beta H\right]}{Z}\right|r\right\rangle\,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{P}_{r}=\left\langle r\left|\frac{\exp\left[-\beta\tilde{H}\right]}{\tilde{Z}}\right|r\right\rangle=\frac{\exp\left(-\beta\tilde{E}_{r}\right)}{\tilde{Z}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;\tilde{E}_{r}&lt;/math&gt; are the eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt;

We assume again that the averages of H and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt; in the canonical ensemble defined by &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt; are the same:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle\tilde{H}\right\rangle = \left\langle H\right\rangle \,&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle H\right\rangle = \sum_{r}\tilde{P}_{r}\left\langle r\left|H\right|r\right\rangle\,&lt;/math&gt;

The inequality

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{r} \tilde{P}_{r}\log\left(\tilde{P}_{r}\right)\geq \sum_{r} \tilde{P}_{r}\log\left(P_{r}\right) \,&lt;/math&gt;

still holds as both the &lt;math&gt;P_{r}&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;\tilde{P}_{r}&lt;/math&gt; sum to 1. On the l.h.s. we can replace:

:&lt;math&gt;\log\left(\tilde{P}_{r}\right)= -\beta \tilde{E}_{r} - \log\left(\tilde{Z}\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

On the right-hand side we can use the inequality

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle\exp\left(X\right)\right\rangle_{r}\geq\exp\left(\left\langle X\right\rangle_{r}\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;
where we have introduced the notation

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle Y\right\rangle_{r}\equiv\left\langle r\left|Y\right|r\right\rangle\,&lt;/math&gt;

for the expectation value of the operator Y in the state r. [[Jensen's inequality#Statistical physics|See here]] for a proof. Taking the logarithm of this inequality gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\log\left[\left\langle\exp\left(X\right)\right\rangle_{r}\right]\geq\left\langle X\right\rangle_{r}\,&lt;/math&gt;

This allows us to write:

:&lt;math&gt;\log\left(P_{r}\right)=\log\left[\left\langle\exp\left(-\beta H - \log\left(Z\right)\right)\right\rangle_{r}\right]\geq\left\langle -\beta H - \log\left(Z\right)\right\rangle_{r}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The fact that the averages of H and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt; are the same then leads to the same conclusion as in the classical case:

:&lt;math&gt;A\leq\tilde{A}&lt;/math&gt;

== Generalized Helmholtz energy ==

In the more general case, the mechanical term (''p'' d''V'') must be replaced by the product of volume, [[Stress (physics)|stress]], and an infinitesimal strain:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}A = V \sum_{ij} \sigma_{ij}\,\mathrm{d} \varepsilon_{ij} - S\,\mathrm{d}T + \sum_i \mu_i \,\mathrm{d}N_i,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the stress tensor, and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the strain tensor. In the case of linear [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] materials that obey [[Hooke's law]], the stress is related to the strain by

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij} = C_{ijkl}\varepsilon_{kl},&lt;/math&gt;

where we are now using [[Einstein notation]] for the tensors, in which repeated indices in a product are summed. We may integrate the expression for &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}A&lt;/math&gt; to obtain the Helmholtz energy:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 A &amp;= \frac{1}{2}VC_{ijkl}\varepsilon_{ij}\varepsilon_{kl} - ST + \sum_i \mu_i N_i \\
   &amp;= \frac{1}{2}V\sigma_{ij}\varepsilon_{ij} - ST + \sum_i \mu_i N_i.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Application to fundamental equations of state ==

The Helmholtz free energy function for a pure substance (together with its partial derivatives) can be used to determine all other thermodynamic properties for the substance. See, for example, the equations of state for [[water]], as given by the [[IAPWS]] in their [https://web.archive.org/web/20110726024808/http://www.iapws.org/relguide/IAPWS95-Rev.pdf IAPWS-95] release.

== Application to training autoencoders ==

S.|title=Autoencoders, minimum description length and Helmholtz free energy|journal=Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems|date=1994|pages=3–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; "derive an objective function for training [[autoencoder]]s based on the [[minimum description length]] (MDL) principle". "The description length of an input vector using a particular code is the sum of the code cost and reconstruction cost. [They] define this to be the energy of the code, for reasons that will become clear later. Given an input vector, [they] define the energy of a code to be the sum of the code cost and the reconstruction cost." The true expected combined cost is
:&lt;math&gt;F = \sum_i p_i E_i - H,&lt;/math&gt;
"which has exactly the form of Helmholtz free energy".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6379">In the branch of mathematics called [[category theory]], a '''hopfian object''' is an object ''A'' such that any [[epimorphism]] of ''A'' onto ''A'' is necessarily an [[automorphism]].  The [[duality (mathematics)|dual notion]] is that of a '''cohopfian object''', which is an object ''B'' such that every [[monomorphism]] from ''B'' into ''B'' is necessarily an automorphism.  The two conditions have been studied in the categories of [[group (mathematics)|group]]s, [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[module (mathematics)|module]]s, and [[topological spaces]].

The terms "hopfian" and "cohopfian" have arisen since the 1960s, and are said to be in honor of [[Heinz Hopf]] and his use of the concept of the hopfian group in his work on [[fundamental group]]s of surfaces. {{harv|Hazewinkel|2001|p=63}}

==Properties==
Both conditions may be viewed as types of [[finiteness condition]]s in their category.  For example, assuming [[ZFC|Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice]] and working in the [[category of sets]], the hopfian and cohopfian objects are precisely the [[finite set#Necessary and sufficient conditions for finiteness|finite set]]s.  From this it is easy to see that all finite groups, finite modules and finite rings are hopfian and cohopfian in their categories.

Hopfian objects and cohopfian objects have an elementary interaction with [[projective object]]s and [[injective object]]s.  The two results are:
*An injective hopfian object is cohopfian.
*A projective cohopfian object is hopfian.
The proof for the first statement is short: Let ''A'' be and injective hopfian object, and let ''f'' be an injective morphism from ''A'' to ''A''.  By injectivity, ''f'' factors through the identity map ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''A'', yielding a morphism ''g'' such that ''gf''=''I''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;.  As a result, ''g'' is a surjective morphism and hence an automorphism, and then ''f'' is necessarily the inverse automorphism to ''g''.  This proof can be dualized to prove the second statement.

==Hopfian and cohopfian groups==
{{main|hopfian group}}

==Hopfian and cohopfian modules==
Here are several basic results in the category of modules.  It is especially important to remember that ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; being hopfian or cohopfian as a module is different from ''R'' being hopfian or cohopfian as a ring.

* A [[Noetherian module]] is hopfian, and an [[Artinian module]] is cohopfian.
* The module ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; is hopfian if and only if ''R'' is a [[directly finite ring]].  Symmetrically, these two are also equivalent to the module &lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' being hopfian.
* In contrast with the above, the modules ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; or &lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' can be cohopfian or not in any combination.  An example of a ring cohopfian on one side but not the other side was given in {{harv|Varadarajan|1992}}.  However, if either of these two modules is cohopfian, ''R'' is hopfian on both sides (since ''R'' is projective as a left or right module) and directly finite.

==Hopfian and cohopfian rings==
The situation in the category of rings is quite different from the category of modules.  The reader should note that the morphisms in the category of rings with unity are required to preserve the identity, that is, to send 1 to 1.

* If ''R'' satisfies the [[ascending chain condition]] on ideals, then ''R'' is hopfian.  This can be proven by analogy with the fact for Noetherian modules.  The counterpart idea for "cohopfian" does not exist however, since if ''f'' is a ring homomorphism from ''R'' into ''R'' preserving identity, and the image of ''f'' is not ''R'', then the image is certainly not an ideal of ''R''.  In any case, this shows that a one sided Noetherian or Artinian ring is always hopfian.
* Any simple ring is hopfian, since the kernel of any endomorphism is an ideal, which is necessarily zero in a simple ring.  In contrast, in {{harv|Varadarajan|1992}}, and example of a non-cohopfian [[field (mathematics)|field]] was given.  
* The [[full linear ring]] End&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;(V) of a countable dimensional vector space is a hopfian ring which is not hopfian as a module, since it only has three ideals, but it is not directly finite.  The paper {{harv|Varadarajan|1992}} also gives an example of a cohopfian ring which is not cohopfian as a module.
* Also in {{harv|Varadarajan|1992}}, it is shown that for a [[Boolean ring]] ''R'' and its associated [[stone space#Stone spaces|Stone space]] ''X'', the ring ''R'' is hopfian in the category of rings if and only if ''X'' is cohopfian in the category of topological spaces, and ''R'' is cohopfian as a ring if and only if ''X'' is hopfian as a topological space.

== Hopfian and cohopfian topological spaces ==
* In {{harv|Varadarajan|1992}}, a series of results on compact manifolds are included.  Firstly, the only [[compact manifold]]s which are hopfian are finite [[discrete space]]s. Secondly, compact manifolds without boundary are always cohopfian.  Lastly, compact manifolds with nonempty boundary are not cohopfian.

      <comment>Hard incompatibilism is the "bad" thing here, not giving up belief in it (what Smilansky endorses).</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5259">'''Illusionism''' is a [[metaphysics|metaphysical theory]] first propounded by professor Saul Smilansky of the [[University of Haifa]].  It holds that people have illusory beliefs about [[free will]].{{sfn|Kane|2011|p=26}}  Furthermore, it holds that it is both of key importance and morally right that people not be disabused of these beliefs, because the illusion has benefits both to individuals and to society.{{sfn|Kane|2011|p=26}}{{sfn|Holroyd|2010|p=110}}  Belief in [[hard incompatibilism]], argues Smilansky, removes an individual's basis for a sense of self-worth in his or her own achievements.  It is "extremely damaging to our view of ourselves, to our sense of achievement, worth, and self-respect".{{sfn|Pereboom|2008|p=472}}

Neither compatibilism nor hard determinism are the whole story, according to Smilansky, and there exists an ''ultimate perspective'' in which ''some'' parts of compatibilism are valid and ''some'' parts of hard determinism are valid.{{sfn|Lenman|2002|p=4}}  However, Smilansky asserts, the nature of what he terms the ''fundamental dualism'' between hard determinism and compatibilism is a morally undesirable one, in that both beliefs, in their absolute forms, have adverse consequences.  The distinctions between choice and luck made by compatibilism are important, but wholly undermined by hard determinism.  But, conversely, hard determinism undermines the morally important notions of justice and respect, leaving them nothing more than "shallow" notions.{{sfn|Lenman|2002|p=6}}

Smilansky's thesis is considered a radical one,{{sfn|Kane|2011|p=26}} and other philosophers disagree with it.  Professor [[Derk Pereboom (philosopher)|Derk Pereboom]] of Cornell University, for example, disagrees that hard incompatibilism necessarily does away with self-worth, because to a large extent that sense of self-worth isn't related to will at all, let alone to free will.  Aspects of worthiness such as natural beauty, native physical ability, and intelligence are not voluntary.{{sfn|Pereboom|2008|p=472}}  Professor James Lenman of the University of Glasgow (at the time) takes a similar line, arguing that Smilansky's expression of the problems is overstated.  The problems that he presents are less fundamentally metaphysical than simply practical in nature.{{sfn|Lenman|2002|p=15–17}}

An '''internally displaced person''' ('''IDP''') is someone who is [[forced displacement|forced to flee]] his or her home but who remains within his or her country's borders. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Internally Displaced Persons|url=http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/internally-displaced-people.html|website=UNHCR|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often referred to as [[refugees]], although they do not fall within the [[Refugee#Legal definition|legal definitions]] of a refugee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=IJR Center|title=Who is a Refugee|url=http://www.ijrcenter.org/refugee-law/#Who_Is_a_Refugee}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Kibativillagers.jpg|thumb|Villagers fleeing gunfire in a camp for internally displaced persons during the [[2008 Nord-Kivu war]]]]

At the end of 2014, it was estimated there were 38.2 million IDPs worldwide, the highest level since 1989, the first year for which global statistics on IDPs are available.  The countries with the largest IDP populations were [[Syria]] (7.6 million), [[Colombia]] (6 million), [[Iraq]] (3.6 million), the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (2.8 million), [[Sudan]] (2.2 million), [[South Sudan]] (1.6 million), [[Pakistan]] (1.4 million), [[Nigeria]] (1.2 million) and [[Somalia]] (1.1 million).&lt;ref name="UNHCRtrends"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unhcr.org/556725e69.html |title=UNHCR – Global Trends –Forced Displacement in 2014 |publisher=UNHCR |date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] and [[UNHCR]] support monitoring and analysis of worldwide IDPs through the Geneva-based [[Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/publisher/IDMC.html IDMC at the UNHCR website]: "At the request of the United Nations, the Geneva-based IDMC runs an online database providing comprehensive information and analysis on internal displacement in some 50 countries."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Whereas '[[refugee]]' has an authoritative definition under the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|1951 Refugee Convention]], there is no universal legal definition of internally displaced persons (IDP); only a regional treaty for African countries (see [[Kampala Convention]]). However, a United Nations report, ''Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement'' uses the definition of: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border."&lt;ref name="Deng 1998"&gt;{{Cite book| first=Francis | last=Deng| contribution=The guiding principles on internal displacement| title=E/CN.4/1998/53/Add.l, February 11. New York, NY: United Nations| editor-first=| editor-last=| coeditors=| publisher=United Nations| place=New York| pages=| date=| year=| id= | contribution-url=http://www.reliefweb.int/ocha_ol/pub/idp_gp/idp.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the above stresses two important elements of internal displacement (coercion and the domestic/internal movement), it is important to note that, rather than a strict definition, the Guiding Principles offer "a descriptive identification of the category of persons whose needs are the concern of the Guiding Principles".&lt;ref&gt;KALIN, G. "Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. Annotations." The American Society of International Law &amp; The Brookings Institution Project on Internal Displacement. Studies in Transnational Legal Policy, No. 32, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the document "intentionally steers
toward flexibility rather than legal precision"&lt;ref&gt;VINCENT, M, "IDPs: rights and status", Forced Migration Review, August 2000, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; as the words "in particular" indicate that the list of reasons for displacement is not exhaustive. However, as Erin Mooney has pointed out, "global statistics on internal displacement generally count only IDPs uprooted by conflict and human rights violations. Moreover, a recent study has recommended that the IDP concept should be defined even more narrowly, to be limited to persons displaced by violence."&lt;ref&gt;MOONEY, E. "The Concept of Internal Displacement and the Case for Internally Displaced Persons as a Category of Concern." Refugee Survey Quarterly. (24) 3, 2005, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, despite the non-exhaustive reasons of internal displacement, many consider IDPs as those who would be defined as refugees if they were to cross an international border, hence, the term refugees in all but name is often applied to IDPs.

==IDP populations==
It is very difficult to get accurate figures for internally displaced persons because populations aren't constant. IDPs may be returning home while others are fleeing, others may periodically return to IDP camps to take advantage of humanitarian aid. While the case of IDPs in large camps such as those in Darfur, western Sudan, are relatively well-reported, it is very difficult to assess those IDPs who flee to larger towns and cities. It is necessary in many instances to supplement official figures with additional information obtained from operational humanitarian organizations on the ground.  Thus, the 24.5 million figure must be treated as an estimate.&lt;ref name='IDMC 2006'&gt;{{cite book | last = IDMC | first = | authorlink = | title = INTERNAL DISPLACEMENT Global Overview of Trends and Developments in 2006 | publisher = Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, Norwegian Refugee Council |date=April 2006 | location = Geneva | pages = | url = http://www.internal-displacement.org/assets/publications/2007/2007-global-overview2006-global-en.pdf  |format=PDF}}p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, most official figures only include those displaced by conflict or natural disasters.  [[Development-induced displacement|Development-induced]] IDPs often are not included in assessments. It has been estimated that between 70 and 80% of all IDPs are women and children.&lt;ref name="internal-displacement.org"&gt;{{cite book | last = IDMC | first = | authorlink = | title = INTERNAL DISPLACEMENT Global Overview of Trends and Developments in 2006 | publisher = Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, Norwegian Refugee Council |date=April 2006 | location = Geneva | pages = | url = http://www.internal-displacement.org/assets/publications/2007/2007-global-overview2006-global-en.pdf  |format=PDF}}p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

50% of internally displaced people and refugees were thought to be in urban areas in 2010, many of them in protracted displacement with little likelihood of ever returning home. A 2013 study found that these protracted urban displacements had not been given due weight by international aid and governance as historically they had focused on rural cam displacement responses.&lt;ref name="odi.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|first=Simone |last=Haysom|title= Sanctuary in the city? Reframing responses to protracted urban displacement, HPG Policy Briefs|url= http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/7533-sanctuary-city-responses-protracted-urban-displacement|website=odi.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study argues that this protracted urban displacement needs a fundamental change in the approach to those who are displaced and their host societies. They note that re-framing responses to urban displacement will also involve [[human rights and development]] actors and local and national governments. They call for a change in the narrative around the issue is needed to reflect ingenuity and fortitude displayed by displaced populations, the opportunities for self-sufficiency and safety represented by urban areas, and that the displaced can make a contribution to their host societies.&lt;ref name="odi.org.uk"/&gt;

===Notable IDP camps===
* There are many [[List of internally displaced persons camps in Nigeria|IDP camps in Nigeria]] and especially many [[Internally Displaced Person Camps in Borno|IDP camps in Borno State]].
* Until recently there were many [[Internally displaced persons in Sri Lanka#The camps|IDP camps in Sri Lanka]].

==Protection and assistance==
The problem of protecting and assisting IDPs is not a new issue.  In international law it is the responsibility of the government concerned to provide assistance and protection for the IDPs in their country.  However, as many of the displaced are a result of civil conflict and violence or where the authority of the central state is in doubt, there is no local authority willing to provide assistance and protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Goodwin-Gill, Guy S. |title=The refugee in international law |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |year=1996 |pages= |isbn=0-19-826019-9 |oclc= |doi=}}p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that some 5 million IDPs in 11 countries are "without any significant humanitarian assistance from their governments."&lt;ref name="internal-displacement.org"/&gt; Under these circumstances rehabilitation policies on humanitarian grounds should be aimed at reducing inequality of opportunity among these vulnerable groups by integrating them into local social services and allowing them access to jobs, education, and healthcare opportunities; otherwise new conflicts might break out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Das|first1=Tuhin K.|last2=Haldar|first2=Sushil K.|last3=Das Gupta|first3=Ivy|last4=Kundu|first4=Sangeeta|title=Deprivation of Internally Displaced Persons: Case Studies in India|date=August 2016|publisher=Power Publishers|location=India|isbn=978-93-85892-71-4|pages=130|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the case of refugees, there is no international humanitarian institution which has the overall responsibility of protecting and assisting the refugees as well as the internally displaced. A number of  organizations have stepped into the breach in specific circumstances.

===UNHCR===
The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) was mandated by General Assembly Resolution 428 (V) of 14 December 1950 to "lead and coordinate international action for the worldwide protection
of refugees and the resolution of refugee problems....guided by the 1951 United Nations [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] and its 1967 Protocol."&lt;ref name='UNHCR Mission`'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/publ/PUBL/4565a5742.pdf |title=Mission Statement |accessdate=2007-10-24 |publisher=UNHCR |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UNHCR has traditionally argued that it does not have a "general competence for IDPs" even though at least since 1972 it had relief and rehabillatation programs for those displaced within a country.  However, in cases where there is a specific request by the UN Secretary General and with the consent of the State concerned it has been willing to respond by assisting IDPs in a given instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Goodwin-Gill, Guy S. |title=The refugee in international law |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |year=1996 |pages= |isbn=0-19-826019-9 |oclc= |doi=}}p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005 it was helping some 5.6 million IDPs (out of over 25 million), but only about 1.1 million in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Roberta Cohen in {{cite book |author=Marsella, Anthony J. |title=Fear of Persecution: Global Human Rights, International Law, and Human Well-Being |publisher=Lexington Books |location=Lexington, Mass |year= 2007|pages= |url= https://www.google.com/books?id=YeSKaWWGGAAC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;vq=cohen&amp;sig=0nKLpuljq26B7RAl6qZqbYEvZ8Q#PPA15,M1|isbn=0-7391-1566-9 |oclc= |doi=}}p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Strengthening Protection of IDPs: The UN's Role|journal=Georgetown Journal of International Affairs|date=Winter–Spring 2006|first=Roberta|last=Cohen|volume=|issue=|pages=|id= |url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/articles/2006/winter_humanrights_cohen/Cohen_2006_GJIA.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-10-23 }} p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

===ICRC===
The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] has a mandate of ensuring the application of [[International Humanitarian Law]] as it affects civilians in the midst of armed conflict.  They have traditionally not distinguished between civilians who are internally displaced and those who remain in their homes.  In a 2006 policy statement, the ICRC stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ICRC's overall objective is to alleviate the suffering of people who are caught up in armed conflict and other situations of violence. To that end, the organization strives to provide effective and efficient assistance and protection for such persons, be they displaced or not, while taking into consideration the action of other humanitarian organizations.
On the basis of its long experience in different parts of the world, the ICRC has defined an operational approach towards the civilian population as a whole that is designed to meet the most urgent humanitarian needs of both displaced persons and local and host communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/idp-icrc-position-030706/$File/2006_IDPs_EN_ICRCExternalPosition.pdf |format=PDF|title= ICRC Position on Internally Displaced Persons|accessdate=2007-10-23 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, its Director of Operations has earlier recognized that IDPs "deprived of shelter and their habitual sources of food, water, medicine and money, they have different, and often more urgent, material needs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jean-Daniel |last=Tauxe |title=We Should Have Humanitarian Access to Displaced Civilians |date=2000-03-01 |publisher= |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2000/03/01/edtauxe.t.php |work=International Herald Tribune |pages= |accessdate=2007-10-24 |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125150508/http://www.iht.com/articles/2000/03/01/edtauxe.t.php |archivedate=November 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaborative approach===
The previous system set up internationally to address the needs of IDPs was referred to as the collaborative approach as the responsibility  for protecting and assisting IDPs was shared among the UN agencies, i.e. UNHCR, [[Unicef]], [[WFP]], [[UNDP]], [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]], the International Organization for Migration [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]], the ICRC and International [[NGOs]]. Coordination is the responsibility of the UN [[Emergency Relief Coordinator]] and the [[Humanitarian Coordinator]] in the country  concerned.&lt;ref name='IASC 2003'&gt;{{cite book| last =IASC| first =| authorlink =| title =Implementing the Collaborative Response to Situations of Internal Displacement| publisher =United Nations| date =September 2004| location =New York| pages =| url =http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004BE3B1/(httpInfoFiles)/9251510E3E5B6FC3C12572BF0029C267/$file/Global_Overview_2006.pdf| doi =| id =| isbn =| format =PDF| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071029221242/http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004BE3B1/(httpInfoFiles)/9251510E3E5B6FC3C12572BF0029C267/$file/Global_Overview_2006.pdf| archivedate =2007-10-29| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are assisted by the Inter-Agency Displacement Division, which was created in 2004 and is housed in the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ([[OCHA]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reliefweb.int/idp/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The original collaborative approach has come under increasing criticism. Roberta Cohen reports: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nearly every UN and independent evaluation has found the collaborative approach deficient when it comes to IDPs. To begin with, there is no real focus of responsibility in the field for assisting and protecting...There is also no predictability of action, as the different agencies are free to pick and choose the situations in which they wish to become involved on the basis of their respective mandates, resources, and interests. In every new emergency, no one knows for sure which agency or combination thereof will become involved.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Strengthening Protection of IDPs: The UN's Role|journal=Georgetown Journal of International Affairs|date=Winter–Spring 2006|first=Roberta|last=Cohen|volume=|issue=|pages=|id= |url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/articles/2006/winter_humanrights_cohen/Cohen_2006_GJIA.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-10-24 }}p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 2005 there was an attempt to fix the problem by giving sectoral responsibilities to different humanitarian agencies, most notably with the UNHCR taking on the responsibility for protection and the management of camps and emergency shelters.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2006"/&gt; The ''Forced Migration Review" stated that the "abnegation of responsibility is possible because there is no formal responsibility apportioned to agencies under the Collaborative Response, and thus no accountability when agencies renege on their promises."&lt;ref&gt;DAVIES, A. and MURRAY, M.W., "Implementation of the Collaborative Response in Liberia", Forced Migration Review. IDP Supplement. October 2005, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cluster approach==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
The cluster approach designates individual agencies as ‘sector leaders’ to coordinate operations in specific areas to try to plug those newly identified gaps. The cluster approach was conceived amid concerns about coordination and capacity that arose from the weak operational response to the crisis in Darfur in 2004 and 2005, and the critical findings of the Humanitarian Response Review (HRR) commissioned by the then ERC, Jan Egeland. Egeland called for strengthening leadership of the sectors, and introduced the concept of "clusters" at different levels (headquarters, regional, country and operational)’.

The cluster approach operates on the global and local levels. At the global level, the approach is meant to build up capacity in eleven key ‘gap’ areas by developing better surge capacity, ensuring consistent access to appropriately trained technical expertise and enhanced material stockpiles, and securing the increased engagement of all relevant humanitarian partners. At the field level, the cluster approach strengthens the coordination and response capacity by mobilizing clusters of humanitarian agencies (UN/Red Cross-Red Crescent/IOs/NGOs) to respond in particular sectors or areas of activity, each cluster having a clearly designated and accountable lead, as agreed by the HC and the Country Team. Designated lead agencies at the global level both participate directly in operations, but also coordinate with and oversee other organizations within their specific spheres, reporting the results up through a designated chain of command to the ERC at the summit. However, lead agencies are responsible as ‘providers of last resort’, which represents the commitment of cluster leads to do their utmost to ensure an adequate and appropriate response in their respective areas of responsibility. The cluster approach was part of a package of reforms accepted by the IASC in December 2005 and subsequently applied in eight chronic humanitarian crises and six sudden-onset emergencies. However, the reform was originally rolled out and evaluated in four countries: DRC, Liberia, Somalia and Uganda.

The clusters were originally concentrated on nine areas: 
# Logistics (WFP)
# [[Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC)|Emergency Telecommunications Cluster]] (WFP)
# Camp coordination and management (UNHCR for conflict-generated IDPs and IOM for natural disaster-generated IDPs)
# [[Shelter Cluster|Shelter]] ([[IFRC]] for natural disasters; UNHCR for conflict situations)
# Health (WHO)
# Nutrition (UNICEF)
# Water, sanitation, and hygiene promotion (UNICEF)
# Early recovery (UNDP); and
# Protection (UNHCR for conflict-generated IDPs, UNHCR, UNICEF, and OHCHR for natural disaster generated IDPs).

IASC Principles deemed it unnecessary to apply the cluster approach to four sectors where no significant gaps were detected: a) food, led by WFP; b) refugees, led by UNHCR; c) education, led by UNICEF; and d) agriculture, led by FAO.

The original nine clusters were later expanded to include agriculture and education.

==International law==
Unlike the case of refugees, there is no international universal treaty which applies specifically to IDPs. Only a regional treaty for African countries has been established (see [[Kampala Convention]]). Some other countries have advocated re-thinking the definitions and protections for refugees to apply to IDPs, but so far no solid actions have come to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Celik|first1=Ayse Betul|title=Transnationalization of Human Rights Norms and Its Impact on Internally Displaced Kurds|journal=Human Rights Quarterly|date=August 2005|volume=27|issue=3|pages=969–997|jstor=20069817|doi=10.1353/hrq.2005.0032}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=2617336|title=The New Refugees and the Old Treaty: Persecutors and Persecuted in the Twenty-First Century|first=Andrew I.|last=Schoenholtz|date=11 June 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing the gap, the UN Secretary-General, Boutros-Ghali appointed [[Francis Deng]] in 1992 as his representative for internally displaced persons.  Besides acting as an advocate for IDPs, Deng set out in 1994, at the request of the UN General Assembly to examine and bring together existing international laws which relating to the protection of IDPs.&lt;ref&gt;Roberta Cohen in {{cite book |author=Marsella, Anthony J. |title=Fear of Persecution: Global Human Rights, International Law, and Human Well-Being |publisher=Lexington Books |location=Lexington, Mass |year= 2007|pages= |url= https://www.google.com/books?id=YeSKaWWGGAAC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;vq=cohen&amp;sig=0nKLpuljq26B7RAl6qZqbYEvZ8Q#PPA15,M1|isbn=0-7391-1566-9 |oclc= |doi=}}p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  The result of this work was the document, ''Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement''.&lt;ref name="Deng 1998"/&gt;

The Guiding Principles lay out the responsibilities of states before displacement – that is, to prevent displacement – during and after displacement. They have been endorsed by the UN General Assembly, the African Commission on Human and People's Rights (ACHPR) and by the signatories to the 2006 [[Pact on Security, Stability and Development in the Great Lakes Region]], which include Sudan, DRC and Uganda.

The Guiding Principles, however, are non-binding. As Bahame Tom Nyanduga, Special Rapporteur on Refugees, IDPs and Asylum Seekers in Africa for the ACHPR has stated, "the absence of a binding international legal regime on internal displacement is a grave lacuna in international law."&lt;ref name='African IDPs'&gt;{{cite journal|title=The challenge of internal displacement in Africa|journal=Forced Migration Review|date=September 2004|first=Bahame Tom|last=Nyanduga|volume=21|issue=|pages=|id= |url=http://www.fmreview.org/FMRpdfs/FMR21/FMR21full.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2004 the Secretary-General of the UN showed the continuing concern of his office by  appointing Walter Kälin as his Representative on the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons.  Part of his mandate includes the promoting of the Guiding Principles.&lt;ref name='IDP Representative'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/english/issues/idp/mandate.htm |title=Mandate |accessdate=2007-10-24 |publisher=UNHCHR |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070807075712/http://www.ohchr.org/english/issues/idp/mandate.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Right of return ==
In so-called "post-conflict" situations, there has traditionally been an emphasis in the international community to seek to return to the pre-war status-quo.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;Sara Pantuliano (2009) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4409&amp;title=uncharted-territory-land-conflict-humanitarian-action Uncharted Territory: Land, Conflict and Humanitarian Action] [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, opinions are gradually changing, because violent conflict destroys political, economic and social structures and new structures develop as a result, quite often irreversibly.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; Furthermore, returning to the pre-war status-quo may actually be undesirable if pre-war structures led to the conflict in the first place, or prevented its early resolution. IDPs' and [[refugees]]' right of return can represent one of the most complex aspects of this issue.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

Normally, pressure is applied by the [[international community]] and [[humanitarian organization]] to ensure displaced people are able to return to their areas of origin and the same property.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; The UN Principles for Housing and Property Restitution for Refugees and IDPs, otherwise known as the Pinheiro Principles, provides guidance on the management of the technical and legal aspects of housing, land and property (HLP) restitution.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; [[Restitution]] rights are of key importance to IDPs and refugees around the world, and important to try preventing aggressors benefiting from conflict.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; However, without a clear understanding of each local context, full restitution rights can be unworkable and fail to protect the people it is designed to protect for the following reasons, refugees and IDPs:&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;
* may never have had property (e.g. in Afghanistan);
* cannot access what property they have (Colombia, Guatemala, South Africa and Sudan);
* ownership is unclear as families have expanded or split and division of the land becomes an issue;
* death of owner may leave dependents without clear claim to the land;
* people settled on the land know it is not theirs but have nowhere else to go (as in Colombia, Rwanda and Timor-Leste); and
* have competing claims with others, including the state and its foreign or local business partners (as in Aceh, Angola, Colombia, Liberia and Sudan)

Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] stress the need for [[humanitarian organization]] to develop a greater expertise in these issues, using experts who have a knowledge in both humanitarian and land and property issues and so provide better advice to state actors seeking to resolve these issues.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; The ODI calls on humanitarian agencies to develop an awareness of sustainable reintegration as part of their emphasis on returning IDPs and refugees home.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; Legal advice needs to be provided to all parties involved even if a framework is created in which to resolve these issues.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

[[File:Landfill gas collection from capped landfill area.jpg|thumb|Landfill gas collection from capped landfill area]]

'''[[Landfill gas]] utilization''' is a process of gathering, processing, and treating the [[methane]] gas emitted from decomposing garbage to produce electricity, heat, fuels, and various chemical compounds. The number of landfill gas projects, which convert the gas into power, went from 399 in 2005 to 519 in 2009 in the United Kingdom, according to the Environment Agency. These projects are popular because they control energy costs and reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. These projects collect the methane gas and treat it, so it can be used for electricity or upgraded to pipeline-grade gas.  These projects power homes, buildings, and vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Landfill Projects on the rise|publisher=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/energy/2010-02-24-landfill-energy_N.htm|accessdate=2010-04-25 | first=Wendy | last=Koch | date=2010-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Landfill gas]] (LFG) is generated through the degradation of [[municipal solid waste]] (MSW) and other biodegradable waste, by [[microorganisms]]. Aerobic conditions, presence of oxygen, leads to predominately {{CO2}} emissions. In anaerobic conditions, as is typical of landfills, methane and {{CO2}} are produced in a ratio of 60:40. [[Methane]] ({{chem|CH|4}}) is the important component of landfill gas as it has a calorific value of 33.95 MJ/Nm^3 which gives rise to energy generation benefits.&lt;ref name="SEPA"&gt;Scottish Environment Protection Agency. Guidance on Landfill Gas Flaring. November 2002. Web. &lt;http://www.sepa.org.uk/waste/waste_regulation/idoc.ashx?docid=d2a6df2b-8ea9-4326-af87-e6803f769d47&amp;version=-1&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of methane that is produced varies significantly based on composition of the waste. Most of the methane produced in MSW landfills is derived from food waste, composite paper, and corrugated cardboard which comprise 19.4 ± 5.5%, 21.9 ± 5.2%, and 20.9 ± 7.1% respectively on average of MSW landfills in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Staley, Bryan, Morton Barlaz, and Morton Barlaz. "Composition of Municipal Solid Waste in the United States and Implications for Carbon Sequestration and Methane Yield." Journal of Environmental Engineering, 135.10 (2009): 901-909.&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of landfill gas production varies with the age of the landfill. There are 4 common phases that a section of a MSW landfill undergoes after placement. Typically, in a large landfill, different areas of the site will be at different stages simultaneously. The landfill gas production rate will reach a maximum at around 5&amp;nbsp;years and start to decline.&lt;ref&gt;Whittington, H. "Electricity Generation: Options for Reduction in Carbon Emissions." , 360.1797 (2002): 1653-1668. .&lt;/ref&gt;  Landfill gas follows first-order kinetic decay after decline begins with a k-value ranging 0.02 yr-1 for arid conditions and 0.065 yr-1 for wet conditions.&lt;ref name="Landfill Gas Modeling"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. "Landfill Gas Modeling." LFG Energy Project Development Handbook. 30 January 2009. Web. 26 November 2009. &lt;http://www.epa.gov/lmop/res/handbook.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Landfill Methane Outreach Program (LMOP) provides first order decay model to aid in the determination of landfill gas production named LandGEM (Landfill Gas Emissions Model).&lt;ref name="Landfill Gas Modeling"/&gt; Typically, gas extraction rates from a municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill range from 25 to 10000&amp;nbsp;m³/h where Landfill sites typically range from 100,000&amp;nbsp;m³ to 10&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;m³.&lt;ref name="SEPA"/&gt;  MSW landfill gas typically has roughly 45 to 60% methane and 40 to 60% carbon dioxide, depending on the amount of air introduced to the site through active gas extraction.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. "Landfill Gas Energy Basics." LFG Energy Project Development Handbook. 16 February 2009. Web. 26 November 2009. &lt;http://www.epa.gov/lmop/res/handbook.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many other minor components that comprises roughly 1% which includes {{chem|H|2|S}}, {{chem|NO|x}}, {{chem|SO|2}}, {{chem|CO}}, [[non-methane volatile organic compound]]s (NMVOCs), [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs), [[polychlorinated dibenzodioxins]] (PCDDs), [[polychlorinated dibenzofurans]] (PCDFs), etc. All of the aforementioned agents are harmful to human health at high doses.&lt;ref name="SEPA"/&gt;

"An Overview of Landfill Gas Energy in the United States." Landfill Methane Outreach Program, June 2009. Web. 26 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;]] 

Landfill gas collection is typically accomplished through the installation of wells installed vertically and/or horizontally in the waste mass.  Design heuristics for vertical wells call for about one well per acre of landfill surface, whereas horizontal wells are normally spaced about 50 to 200 feet apart on center.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. "Project Technology Options." LFG Energy Project Development Handbook. 9 September 2009. Web. 26 November 2009. &lt;http://www.epa.gov/lmop/res/handbook.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Efficient gas collection can be accomplished at both open and closed landfills, but closed landfills have systems that are more efficient, owing to greater deployment of collection infrastructure since active filling is not occurring.  On average, closed landfills have gas collection systems that capture about 84% of produced gas, compared to about 67% for open landfills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Estimates of solid waste disposal rates and reduction targets for landfill gas emissions|url = http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate2804.html|journal = Nature Climate Change|date = 2015-09-21|issn = 1758-6798|volume = advance online publication|doi = 10.1038/nclimate2804|language = en|first = Jon T.|last = Powell|first2 = Timothy G.|last2 = Townsend|first3 = Julie B.|last3 = Zimmerman}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Landfill gas can also be extracted through horizontal trenches instead of vertical wells. Both systems are effective at collecting. Landfill gas is extracted and piped to a main collection header, where it is sent to be treated or flared. The main collection header can be connected to the leachate collection system to collect condensate forming in the pipes. A blower is needed to pull the gas from the collection wells to the collection header and further downstream. A {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} landfill gas collection system with a flare designed for a 600&amp;nbsp;ft³/min extraction rate is estimated to cost $991,000 (approximately $24,000 per acre) with annual operation and maintenance costs of $166,000 per year at $2,250 per well, $4,500 per flare and $44,500 per year to operate the blower (2008). LMOP provides a software model to predict collection system costs.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt;

=== Flaring ===
[[File:Open (left) and enclosed (right) flare.JPG|thumb|alt= Open_(left)_and_enclosed_(right)_flare.JPG|Flares: Open (left) and enclosed (right) flare.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt;]]

If gas extraction rates do not warrant direct use or electricity generation, the gas can be flared off. One hundred&amp;nbsp;m³/h is a practical threshold for flaring in the US. In the U.K, gas engines are used with a capacity of less than 100m3/h.&lt;ref name="SEPA"/&gt; Flares are useful in all landfill gas systems as they can help control excess gas extraction spikes and maintenance down periods. In the U.K and EU enclosed flares are mandatory at modern landfill sites. Flares can be either open or enclosed. Enclosed flares are typically more expensive, but they provide high combustion temperatures and specific residence times as well as limit noise and light pollution. Some US states require the use of enclosed flares over open flares. Higher combustion temperatures and residence times destroy unwanted constituents such as un-burnt hydrocarbons. General accepted values are an exhaust gas temperature of 1000°C with a retention time of '''0,3 seconds''' which is said to result in greater than 98% destruction efficiency.

=== Landfill gas treatment ===
Landfill gas must be treated to remove impurities, condensate, and particulates. The treatment system depends on the end use. Minimal treatment is needed for the direct use of gas in boiler, furnaces, or kilns. Using the gas in electricity generation typically requires more in-depth treatment. Treatment systems are divided into primary and secondary treatment processing. Primary processing systems remove moisture and particulates. Gas cooling and compression are common in primary processing. Secondary treatment systems employ multiple cleanup processes, physical and chemical, depending on the specifications of the end use. Two constituents that may need to be removed are [[siloxanes]] and [[sulfur compounds]], which are damaging to equipment and significantly increase maintenance cost. Adsorption and absorption are the most common technologies used in secondary treatment processing.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt;

== Use of landfill gas ==
=== Direct use ===
==== Boiler, dryer, and process heater ====
[[File:Boiler retrofitted to accept landfill gas.JPG|thumb|alt= Boiler_retrofitted_to_accept_landfill_gas.JPG|Boiler retrofitted to accept landfill gas.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt;]]

Pipelines transmit gas to boilers, dryers, or kilns, where it is used much in the same way as natural gas. Landfill gas is cheaper than natural gas and holds about half the heating value at 16,785 – 20,495 kJ/m3 (450 – 550 Btu/ft3) as compared to 35,406 kJ/m3 (950 Btu/ft3) of natural gas.&lt;ref name="Hydrogen Addition"&gt;Bade Shrestha, S.O, G Narayanan, and G Narayanan. "Landfill Gas with Hydrogen Addition a Fuel for SI Engines." Fuel, 87.17/18 (2008): 3616-3626.&lt;/ref&gt; Boilers, dryers, and kilns are used often because they maximize use of the gas, limited treatment is needed, and the gas can be mixed with other fuels. Boilers use the gas to transform water into steam for use in various applications. For boilers, about 8,000 to 10,000&amp;nbsp;pounds per hour of steam can be generated for every 1&amp;nbsp;million metric tons of waste-in-place at the landfill.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt; Most direct use projects use boilers. [[General Motors]] saves $500,000 on energy costs per year at each of the four plants owned by General Motors that has implemented landfill gas boilers.&lt;ref name="boilers"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. "Adapting Boilers to Utilize Landfill Gas: An Environmentally and Economically Beneficial Opportunity." September 2008. Web. 26 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Disadvantages of Boilers, dryers, and kilns are that they need to be [[retrofitted]] in order to accept the gas and the end user has to be nearby (within roughly 5&amp;nbsp;miles) as pipelines will need to be built.

==== Infrared heaters, greenhouses, artisan studios ====
In situations with low gas extraction rates, the gas can go to power infrared heaters in buildings local to the landfill, provide heat and power to local greenhouses, and power the energy intensive activities of a studio engaged in pottery, metalworking or glass-blowing. Heat is fairly inexpensive to employ with the use of a boiler. A microturbine would be needed to provide power in low gas extraction rate situations.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt;

==== Leachate evaporation ====
[[File:Leachate evaporation system.JPG|thumb|alt= Leachate_evaporation_system.JPG|[[Leachate]] evaporation system.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt;]]

The gas coming from the landfill can be used to evaporate [[leachate]] in situations where leachate is fairly expensive to treat. The system to evaporate the leachate costs $300,000 to $500,000 to put in place with operations and maintenance costs of $70,000 to $95,000 per year. A 30,000&amp;nbsp;gallons per day evaporator costs $.05 - $.06 per gallon. The cost per gallon increases as the evaporator size decreases. A 10,000&amp;nbsp;gallons per day evaporator costs $.18 - $.20 per gallon.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt; Estimates are in 2007&amp;nbsp;dollars.

==== Pipeline-quality gas, CNG, LNG ====
[[File:Gas separator membrane skid for PSA process of landfill gas.jpg|thumb|Gas separator membrane skid used in membrane separation process to extract carbon dioxide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=SWANA 2012 Excellence Award Application "Landfill Gas Control" Seneca Landfill, Inc|url=https://swana.org/Portals/0/Awards/2012Noms/Landfill_Gas_Control_silver.pdf|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Landfill gas can be converted to high-Btu gas by reducing its carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and oxygen content. The high-Btu gas can be piped into existing natural gas pipelines or in the form of CNG ([[compressed natural gas]]) or LNG ([[liquid natural gas]]). CNG and LNG can be used on site to power hauling trucks or equipment or sold commercially. Three commonly used methods to extract the carbon dioxide from the gas are membrane separation, molecular sieve, and amine scrubbing. Oxygen and nitrogen are controlled by the proper design and operation of the landfill since the primary cause for oxygen or nitrogen in the gas is intrusion from outside into the landfill because of a difference in pressure. The high-Btu processing equipment can be expected to cost $2,600 to $4,300 per standard cubic foot per minute (scfm) of landfill gas. Annual costs range from $875,000 to $3.5&amp;nbsp;million to operate, maintain and provide electricity to.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt; Costs depend on quality of the end product gas as well as the size of the project. The first landfill gas to LNG facility in the United States was the [[Frank R. Bowerman Landfill]] in [[Orange County, California]]. The same process is used for the conversion to CNG, but on a smaller scale. The CNG project at [[Puente Hills Landfill]] in Los Angeles has realized $1.40 per gallon of gasoline equivalent with the flow rate of 250 scfm.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt; Cost per gallon equivalent reduces as the flow rate of gas increases. LNG can be produced through the liquidfication of CNG. However, the oxygen content needs to be reduced to be under 0.5% to avoid explosion concerns, the carbon dioxide content must be as close to zero as possible to avoid freezing problems encountered in the production, and nitrogen must be reduced enough to achieve at least 96% methane. A $20&amp;nbsp;million facility is estimated to achieve $0.65/gallon for a plant producing 15,000&amp;nbsp;gallons/day of LNG (3,000 scfm).&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt; Estimates are in 2007&amp;nbsp;dollars.

=== Electricity generation ===
If the landfill gas extraction rate is large enough, a gas turbine or internal combustion engine could be used to produce electricity to sell commercially or use on site.

==== Reciprocating piston engine ====
[[File:IC engines.JPG|thumb|alt= IC_engines.JPG| Internal combustion engines to generate electricity.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt;]]

More than 70 percent of all landfill electricity projects use [[Reciprocating engine|reciprocating piston (RP) engines]], a [[Internal combustion engine|form of internal combustion engine]], because of relatively low cost, high efficiency, and good size match with most landfills. RP engines usually achieve an efficiency of 25 to 35 percent with landfill gas. However, RP engines can be added or removed to follow gas trends. Each engine can achieve 150kW to 3&amp;nbsp;MW, depending on the gas flow. An RP engine (less than 1&amp;nbsp;MW) can typically cost $2,300 per kW with annual operation and maintenance costs of $210 per kW. An RP engine (greater than 800&amp;nbsp;kW) can typically cost $1,700 per kW with annual operation and maintenance costs of $180 per kW.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt; Estimates are in 2010&amp;nbsp;dollars.

==== Gas turbine ====
[[File:Gas turbines.JPG|thumb|alt= Gas_turbines.JPG|Gas turbines that utilize landfill gas.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt;]]

[[Gas turbine|Gas turbines]], another form of internal combustion engine, usually meet an efficiency of 20 to 28 percent at full load with landfill gas. Efficiencies drop when the turbine is operating at partial load. Gas turbines have relatively low maintenance costs and nitrogen oxide emissions when compared to RP engines. Gas turbines require high gas compression, which uses more electricity to compress, therefore reducing the efficiency. Gas turbines are also more resistant to corrosive damage than RP engines. Gas turbines need a minimum of 1,300 cfm and typically exceed 2,100 cfm and can generate 1 to 10&amp;nbsp;MW. A gas turbine (greater than 3&amp;nbsp;MW) can typically cost $1,400 per kW with annual operation and maintenance costs of $130 per kW.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt;  Estimates are in 2010&amp;nbsp;dollars.

==== Microturbine ====
Microturbines can produce electricity with lower amounts of landfill gas than gas turbines or RP engines.  Microturbines can operate between 20 and 200 cfm and emit less nitrogen oxides than RP engines. Also, they can function with less methane content (as little as 35 percent). Microturbines require extensive gas treatment and come in sizes of 30, 70, and 250&amp;nbsp;kW. A microturbine (less than 1&amp;nbsp;MW) can typically cost $5,500 per kW with annual operation and maintenance costs of $380 per kW.&lt;ref name="LMOP Project Tech Options"/&gt; Estimates are in 2010&amp;nbsp;dollars.

==== Fuel cell ====
Research has been performed indicating that molten carbonate [[Fuel cell|fuel cells]] could be fueled by landfill gas. Molten carbonate fuel cells require less purity than typical fuel cells, but still require extensive treatment. The separation of acid gases (HCl, HF, and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), VOC oxidation (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S removal) and siloxane removal are required for molten carbonate fuel cells.&lt;ref&gt;Urban, W, H Lohmann, J.I. Salazar Gomez, H Lohmann, and J.I. Salazar Gomez. "Catalytically Upgraded Landfill Gas as a Cost-effective Alternative for Fuel Cells." Journal of Power Sources, 193.1 (2009): 359-366.&lt;/ref&gt; Fuel cells are typically run on hydrogen and hydrogen can be produced from landfill gas. Hydrogen used in fuel cells have zero emissions, high efficiency, and low maintenance costs.&lt;ref name="Hydrogen Addition"/&gt;

[[File:States with RPS.JPG|thumb|alt= States_with_RPS.JPG|States with Renewable Portfolio Standard.&lt;ref name="state rps"/&gt;]]

Various landfill gas project incentives exist for United States projects at the federal and state level. The [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]], [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]], and [[Department of Commerce]] all provide federal incentives for landfill gas projects. Typically, incentives are in the form of tax credits, bonds, or grants. For example, the Renewable Electricity Production Tax Credit (PTC) gives a corporate tax credit of 1.1&amp;nbsp;cents per kWh for landfill projects above 150&amp;nbsp;kW.&lt;ref name="Fed Resources"&gt;"EPA - LMOP - Funding Guide: Federal Resources." U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Web. 8 November 2009. &lt;http://www.epa.gov/lmop/res/guide/federal.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Various states and private foundations give incentives to landfill gas projects. A Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) is a legislative requirement for utilities to sell or generate a percentage of their electricity from renewable sources including landfill gas. Some states require all utilities to comply, while others require only public utilities to comply.&lt;ref name="state rps"&gt;"EPA - LMOP - Funding Guide: State Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS)." U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Web. 8 November 2009. &lt; http://www.epa.gov/lmop/res/guide/state_rps.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. September 2007. Web. 26 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 2005, 166&amp;nbsp;million tons of MSW were discarded to landfills in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, P. Ozge, Joseph Decarolis, Susan Thorneloe, Joseph Decarolis, and Susan Thorneloe. "Is It Better to Burn or Bury Waste for Clean Electricity Generation?." Environmental Science &amp; Technology, 43.6 (2009): 1711-1717.&lt;/ref&gt;  Roughly 120&amp;nbsp;kg of methane is generated from every ton of MSW. Methane has a [[global warming]] potential of 23 times more effective of a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide on a 100-year time horizon. It is estimated that more than 10% of all global anthropogenic methane emissions are from landfills.&lt;ref&gt;Lohila, Annalea, Tuomas Laurila, Juha-Pekka Tuovinen, Mika Aurela, Juha Hatakka, Tea Thum, Mari Pihlatie, Janne Rinne, Timo Vesala, Tuomas Laurila, Juha-Pekka Tuovinen, Mika Aurela, Juha Hatakka, Tea Thum, Mari Pihlatie, Janne Rinne, and Timo Vesala. "Micrometeorological Measurements of Methane and Carbon Dioxide Fluxes at a Municipal Landfill." Environmental Science &amp; Technology, 41.8 (2007): 2717-2722.&lt;/ref&gt; Landfill gas projects help aid in the reduction of methane emissions. However, landfill gas collection systems do not collect all the gas generated. Around 4 to 10 percent of landfill gas escapes the collection system of a typical landfill with a gas collection system.&lt;ref name="Benefits"&gt;”Environmental Protection Agency LMOP: Benefits of Energy.” U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Web. 27 November 2009. &lt;http://www.epa.gov/lmop/benefits.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of landfill gas is considered a [[green fuel]] source because it offsets the use of environmentally damaging fuels such as oil or [[natural gas]], destroys the heat-trapping gas methane, and the gas is generated by deposits of waste that are already in place. 450 of the 2,300 landfills in the United States have operational landfill gas utilization projects as of 2007. LMOP has estimated that approximately 520 landfills that currently exist could use landfill gas (enough to power 700,000 homes). Landfill gas projects also decrease local pollution, and create jobs, revenues and cost savings.&lt;ref name="Benefits"/&gt;  Of the roughly 450 landfill gas projects operational in 2007, 11&amp;nbsp;billion kWh of electricity was generated and 78&amp;nbsp;billion cubic feet of gas was supplied to end users. These totals amount to roughly {{convert|17500000|acre|ha}} of pine or fir forests or annual emissions from 14,000,000 passenger vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

{{Algebraic structures |lattice}}
{{stack|{{Binary relations}}}}

A '''lattice''' is an abstract structure studied in the [[mathematics|mathematical]] subdisciplines of [[order theory]] and [[abstract algebra]]. It consists of a [[partially ordered set]] in which every two elements have a unique [[supremum]] (also called a least upper bound or [[Join and meet|join]]) and a unique [[infimum]] (also called a greatest lower bound or [[Join and meet|meet]]). An example is given by the [[natural number]]s, partially ordered by [[divisibility]], for which the unique supremum is the [[least common multiple]] and the unique infimum is the [[greatest common divisor]].

Lattices can also be characterized as [[algebraic structure]]s satisfying certain [[axiom]]atic [[Identity (mathematics)|identities]]. Since the two definitions are equivalent, lattice theory draws on both [[order theory]] and [[universal algebra]]. [[Semilattice]]s include lattices, which in turn include [[Heyting algebra|Heyting]] and [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s. These "lattice-like" structures all admit [[order theory|order-theoretic]] as well as algebraic descriptions.

== Lattices as partially ordered sets ==
&lt;!---joined into examples section: [[File:Lattice of partitions of an order 4 set.svg|thumb|360px|The name "lattice" is suggested by the form of the [[Hasse diagram]] depicting it. Shown here is the lattice of [[partition (set theory)|partition]]s of a four-element set&amp;nbsp;{{nowrap|{1, 2, 3, 4},}} ordered by the relation "is a refinement of".]]---&gt;

If {{nowrap|(''L'', ≤)}} is a [[partially ordered set]] (poset), and {{nowrap|''S'' ⊆ ''L''}} is an arbitrary subset, then an element {{nowrap|''u'' ∈ ''L''}} is said to be an '''upper bound''' of ''S'' if {{nowrap|''s'' ≤ ''u''}} for each {{nowrap|''s'' ∈ ''S''}}. A set may have many upper bounds, or none at all. An upper bound ''u'' of ''S'' is said to be its '''least upper bound''', or '''[[Join (mathematics)|join]]''', or '''supremum''', if {{nowrap|''u'' ≤ ''x''}} for each upper bound ''x'' of ''S''. A set need not have a least upper bound, but it cannot have more than one. [[duality (order theory)|Dually]], {{nowrap|''l'' ∈ ''L''}} is said to be a '''lower bound''' of ''S'' if {{nowrap|''l'' ≤ ''s''}} for each {{nowrap|''s'' ∈ ''S''}}. A lower bound ''l'' of ''S'' is said to be its '''greatest lower bound''', or '''[[meet (mathematics)|meet]]''', or '''infimum''', if {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''l''}} for each lower bound ''x'' of ''S''. A set may have many lower bounds, or none at all, but can have at most one greatest lower bound.

A partially ordered set {{nowrap|(''L'', ≤)}} is called a '''[[join-semilattice]]''' if each two-element subset {{nowrap|{''a'', ''b''} ⊆ ''L''}} has a join (i.e. least upper bound), and is called a '''[[meet-semilattice]]''' if each two-element subset has a meet (i.e. greatest lower bound), denoted by {{nowrap|''a'' ∨ ''b''}} and {{nowrap|''a'' ∧ ''b''}} respectively. {{nowrap|(''L'', ≤)}} is called a '''lattice''' if it is both a join- and a meet-semilattice. 
This definition makes ∨ and ∧ [[binary operation]]s. Both operations are monotone with respect to the order: {{nowrap|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{nowrap|''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} implies that {{nowrap|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{nowrap|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

It follows by an [[mathematical induction|induction]] argument that every non-empty finite subset of a lattice has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound. With additional assumptions, further conclusions may be possible; ''see'' [[Completeness (order theory)]] for more discussion of this subject. That article also discusses how one may rephrase the above definition in terms of the existence of suitable [[Galois connection]]s between related partially ordered sets — an approach of special interest for the [[category theory|category theoretic]] approach to lattices, and for [[formal concept analysis]].

A '''bounded lattice''' is a lattice that additionally has a '''[[greatest element|greatest]]''' element (also called '''maximum''', or '''top''' element, and denoted by 1, or by &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt;) and a '''[[least element|least]]''' element (also called '''minimum''', or '''bottom''', denoted by 0 or by &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt;), which satisfy
: 0 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 1 for every ''x'' in ''L''.
Every lattice can be embedded into a bounded lattice by adding an artificial greatest and least element, and every non-empty finite lattice is bounded, by taking the join (resp., meet) of all elements, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\bigvee L=a_1\lor\cdots\lor a_n&lt;/math&gt; (resp.&lt;math&gt;\bigwedge L=a_1\land\cdots\land a_n&lt;/math&gt;) where &lt;math&gt;L=\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}&lt;/math&gt;.

A partially ordered set is a bounded lattice if and only if every finite set of elements (including the empty set) has a join and a meet. For every element ''x'' of a poset it is trivially true (it is a [[vacuous truth]]) that 
&lt;math&gt;\forall a\in\varnothing :  x \le a&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;\forall a\in\varnothing :  a \le x&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore every element of a poset is both an upper bound and a lower bound of the empty set.  This implies that the join of an empty set is the least element &lt;math&gt;\bigvee\varnothing=0&lt;/math&gt;, and the meet of the empty set is the greatest element &lt;math&gt;\bigwedge\varnothing=1&lt;/math&gt;. This is consistent with the associativity and commutativity of meet and join: the join of a union of finite sets is equal to the join of the joins of the sets, and dually, the meet of a union of finite sets is equal to the meet of the meets of the sets, i.e., for finite subsets ''A'' and ''B'' of a poset ''L'',

:&lt;math&gt;\bigvee \left( A \cup B \right)= \left( \bigvee A \right) \vee \left( \bigvee B \right)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\bigwedge \left( A \cup B \right)= \left(\bigwedge A \right) \wedge \left( \bigwedge B \right)&lt;/math&gt;

hold. Taking ''B'' to be the empty set,

:&lt;math&gt;\bigvee \left( A \cup \emptyset \right)
= \left( \bigvee A \right) \vee \left( \bigvee \emptyset \right)
= \left( \bigvee A \right) \vee 0
= \bigvee A&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\bigwedge \left( A \cup \emptyset \right)
= \left( \bigwedge A \right) \wedge \left( \bigwedge \emptyset \right)
= \left( \bigwedge A \right) \wedge 1
= \bigwedge A&lt;/math&gt;

which is consistent with the fact that &lt;math&gt;A \cup \emptyset = A&lt;/math&gt;.

A lattice element ''y'' is said to '''[[covering relation|cover]]''' another element ''x'', if {{nowrap|''y'' &gt; ''x''}}, but there does not exist a ''z'' such that {{nowrap|''y'' &gt; ''z'' &gt; ''x''}}.
Here, {{nowrap|''y'' &gt; ''x''}} means {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} and {{nowrap|''x'' ≠ ''y''}}.

A lattice {{nowrap|(''L'', ≤)}} is called '''[[Graded poset|graded]]''', sometimes '''ranked''' (but see [[Ranked poset]] for an alternative meaning), if it can be equipped with a '''rank function''' ''r'' from ''L'' to ℕ, sometimes to ℤ, compatible with the ordering (so {{nowrap|''r''(''x'') &amp;lt; ''r''(''y'')}} whenever {{nowrap|''x'' &amp;lt; ''y''}}) such that whenever ''y'' covers ''x'', then {{nowrap|1=''r''(''y'') = ''r''(''x'') + 1}}.  The value of the rank function for a lattice element is called its '''rank'''.

Given a subset of a lattice, {{nowrap|''H'' ⊂ ''L''}}, meet and join restrict to [[partial function]]s – they are undefined if their value is not in the subset ''H''. The resulting structure on ''H'' is called a '''{{visible anchor|partial lattice}}'''. In addition to this extrinsic definition as a subset of some other algebraic structure (a lattice), a partial lattice can also be intrinsically defined as a set with two partial binary operations satisfying certain axioms.{{sfn|Grätzer|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SoGLVCPuOz0C&amp;pg=PA52 52]}}

== Lattices as algebraic structures ==

===General lattice===
An [[algebraic structure]] {{nowrap|(''L'', ∨, ∧)}}, consisting of a set ''L'' and two binary [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]] ∨, and ∧, on ''L'' is a '''lattice''' if the following axiomatic identities hold for all elements ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' of ''L''.

{| style="margin:0em" cellpadding=0 border=0 cellspacing=0
|
;[[commutative property|Commutative laws]]
:''a'' ∨ ''b'' = ''b'' ∨ ''a'',
:''a'' ∧ ''b'' = ''b'' ∧ ''a''.
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|
;[[Associative property|Associative laws]]
:''a'' ∨ (''b'' ∨ ''c'') = (''a'' ∨ ''b'') ∨ ''c'',
:''a'' ∧ (''b'' ∧ ''c'') = (''a'' ∧ ''b'') ∧ ''c''.
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|
;[[Absorption law]]s:
:''a'' ∨ (''a'' ∧ ''b'') = ''a'',
:''a'' ∧ (''a'' ∨ ''b'') = ''a''.
|}

The following two identities are also usually regarded as axioms, even though they follow from the two absorption laws taken together.&lt;ref group=note&gt;{{nowrap|1=''a'' ∨ ''a'' = ''a'' ∨ (''a'' ∧ (''a'' ∨ ''a'')) = ''a''}}, and dually for the other idempotent law. {{Citation | last1=Dedekind | first1=Richard | author1-link=Richard Dedekind | title=Über Zerlegungen von Zahlen durch ihre grössten gemeinsamen Teiler | year=1897 | journal=Braunschweiger Festschrift | pages=1–40}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Idempotence|Idempotent laws]]
:''a'' ∨ ''a'' = ''a'',
:''a'' ∧ ''a'' = ''a''.

These axioms assert that both {{nowrap|(''L'', ∨)}} and {{nowrap|(''L'', ∧)}} are [[semilattice]]s. The absorption laws, the only axioms above in which both meet and join appear, distinguish a lattice from an arbitrary pair of semilattices and assure that the two semilattices interact appropriately. In particular, each semilattice is the [[Duality (order theory)|dual]] of the other.

===Bounded lattice===
A '''bounded lattice''' is an algebraic structure of the form {{nowrap|(''L'', ∨, ∧, 0, 1)}} such that {{nowrap|(''L'', ∨, ∧)}} is a lattice, 0 (the lattice's bottom) is the [[identity element]] for the join operation ∨, and 1 (the lattice's top) is the identity element for the meet operation ∧.

;[[Identity (mathematics)|Identity laws]]
:''a'' ∨ 0 = ''a'',
:''a'' ∧ 1 = ''a''.

See [[semilattice]] for further details.

===Connection to other algebraic structures===
Lattices have some connections to the family of [[magma (algebra)|group-like algebraic structures]]. Because meet and join both commute and associate, a lattice can be viewed as consisting of two commutative [[semigroups]] having the same domain. For a bounded lattice, these semigroups are in fact commutative [[monoid]]s. The [[absorption law]] is the only defining identity that is peculiar to lattice theory.

By commutativity and associativity one can think of join and meet as binary operations that are defined on non-empty finite sets, rather than on elements. In a bounded lattice the empty join and the empty meet can also be defined (as 0 and 1, respectively). This makes bounded lattices somewhat more natural than general lattices, and many authors require all lattices to be bounded.

The algebraic interpretation of lattices plays an essential role in [[universal algebra]].

== Connection between the two definitions ==
An order-theoretic lattice gives rise to the two binary operations ∨ and ∧. Since the commutative, associative and absorption laws can easily be verified for these operations, they make {{nowrap|(''L'', ∨, ∧)}} into a lattice in the algebraic sense.

The converse is also true. Given an algebraically defined lattice {{nowrap|(''L'', ∨, ∧)}}, one can define a partial order ≤ on ''L'' by setting
: {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''b''}} if  {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''a'' ∧ ''b''}}, or
: {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''b''}} if  {{nowrap|1=''b'' = ''a'' ∨ ''b''}},
for all elements ''a'' and ''b'' from ''L''. The laws of absorption ensure that both definitions are equivalent:

''a'' = ''a'' ∧ ''b'' implies ''b'' = ''b'' ∨ (''b'' ∧ ''a'') = (''a'' ∧ ''b'') ∨ ''b'' = ''a'' ∨ ''b''

and dually for the other direction.

One can now check that the relation ≤ introduced in this way defines a partial ordering within which binary meets and joins are given through the original operations ∨ and ∧.

Since the two definitions of a lattice are equivalent, one may freely invoke aspects of either definition in any way that suits the purpose at hand.

* For any set ''A'', the collection of all subsets of ''A'' (called the [[power set]] of ''A'') can be ordered via [[subset|subset inclusion]] to obtain a lattice bounded by ''A'' itself and the null set. Set [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[union (set theory)|union]] interpret meet and join, respectively (see pic.1).
* For any set ''A'', the collection of all finite subsets of ''A'', ordered by inclusion, is also a lattice, and will be bounded if and only if ''A'' is finite.
* For any set ''A'', the collection of all [[partition of a set|partition]]s of ''A'', ordered by [[partition of a set|refinement]], is a lattice (see pic.3).
* The [[natural number|positive integers]] in their usual order form a lattice, under the operations of "min" and "max". 1 is bottom; there is no top (see pic.4).
* The [[Cartesian square]] of the natural numbers, ordered so that {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'') ≤ (''c'', ''d'')}} if {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''c''}} and {{nowrap|''b'' ≤ ''d''}}. The pair {{nowrap|(0, 0)}} is the bottom element; there is no top (see pic.5).
* The natural numbers also form a lattice under the operations of taking the [[greatest common divisor]] and [[least common multiple]], with [[divisibility]] as the order relation: {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''b''}} if ''a'' divides ''b''. 1 is bottom; 0 is top. Pic.2 shows a finite sublattice.
* Every [[complete lattice]] (also see [[#Completeness|below]]) is a (rather specific) bounded lattice. This class gives rise to a broad range of practical [[Complete lattice#Examples|examples]].
* The set of [[compact element]]s of an [[arithmetic lattice|arithmetic]] complete lattice is a lattice with a least element, where the lattice operations are given by restricting the respective operations of the arithmetic lattice. This is the specific property which distinguishes arithmetic lattices from [[algebraic lattice]]s, for which the compacts do only form a [[semilattice|join-semilattice]]. Both of these classes of complete lattices are studied in [[domain theory]].

Most partial ordered sets are not lattices, including the following.

* A discrete poset, meaning a poset such that {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} implies {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''y''}}, is a lattice if and only if it has at most one element.  In particular the two-element discrete poset is not a lattice.
* Although the set {{nowrap|{1, 2, 3, 6}{{null}}}} partially ordered by divisibility is a lattice, the set {{nowrap|{1, 2, 3}{{null}}}} so ordered is not a lattice because the pair 2, 3 lacks a join, and it lacks a meet in {{nowrap|{2, 3, 6}.}}
* The set {{nowrap|{1, 2, 3, 12, 18, 36}{{null}}}} partially ordered by divisibility is not a lattice.  Every pair of elements has an upper bound and a lower bound, but the pair 2, 3 has three upper bounds, namely 12, 18, and 36, none of which is the least of those three under divisibility (12 and 18 do not divide each other).  Likewise the pair 12, 18 has three lower bounds, namely 1, 2, and 3, none of which is the greatest of those three under divisibility (2 and 3 do not divide each other).

== Morphisms of lattices ==
[[File:Monotonic but nonhomomorphic map between lattices.gif|thumb|'''Pic.9:''' Monotonic map ''f'' between lattices that preserves neither joins nor meets, since {{nowrap|''f''(''u'') ∨ ''f''(''v'')}} {{nowrap|1== ''u''′ ∨ ''u''′}} {{nowrap|1== ''u''′ ≠ 1′}} {{nowrap|1== ''f''(1) = ''f''(''u'' ∨ ''v'')}} and {{nowrap|''f''(''u'') ∧ ''f''(''v'')}} {{nowrap|1== ''u''′ ∧ ''u''′}} {{nowrap|1== ''u''′ ≠ 0′}} {{nowrap|1== ''f''(0) = ''f''(''u'' ∧ ''v'')}}.]]
The appropriate notion of a [[morphism]] between two lattices flows easily from the [[#Lattices as algebraic structures|above]] algebraic definition. Given two lattices {{nowrap|(''L'', ∨&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;, ∧&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{nowrap|(''M'', ∨&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;, ∧&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, a '''lattice homomorphism''' from ''L'' to ''M'' is a function {{nowrap|''f'' : ''L'' → ''M''}} such that for all {{nowrap|''a'', ''b'' ∈ ''L''}}:

: ''f''(''a'' ∨&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; ''b'') = ''f''(''a'') ∨&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f''(''b''), and
: ''f''(''a'' ∧&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; ''b'') = ''f''(''a'') ∧&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f''(''b'').

Thus ''f'' is a [[homomorphism]] of the two underlying [[semilattice]]s. When lattices with more structure are considered, the morphisms should "respect" the extra structure, too. In particular, a '''bounded-lattice homomorphism''' (usually called just "lattice homomorphism") ''f'' between two bounded lattices ''L'' and ''M'' should also have the following property:

: ''f''(0&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; , and
: ''f''(1&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; .

In the order-theoretic formulation, these conditions just state that a homomorphism of lattices is a function [[limit preserving function (order theory)|preserving]] binary meets and joins. For bounded lattices, preservation of least and greatest elements is just preservation of join and meet of the empty set.

Any homomorphism of lattices is necessarily [[monotone function|monotone]] with respect to the associated ordering relation; see [[limit preserving function (order theory)|preservation of limits]]. The converse is not true: monotonicity by no means implies the required preservation of meets and joins (see pic.9), although an [[Monotonic function|order-preserving]] [[bijection]] is a homomorphism if its [[inverse function|inverse]] is also order-preserving.

Given the standard definition of [[isomorphism]]s as invertible morphisms, a ''lattice isomorphism'' is just a [[bijective]] lattice homomorphism. Similarly, a ''lattice endomorphism'' is a lattice homomorphism from a lattice to itself, and a ''lattice automorphism'' is a bijective lattice endomorphism.  Lattices and their homomorphisms form a [[category theory|category]].

== Sublattices ==
A ''sublattice'' of a lattice ''L'' is a nonempty subset of ''L'' that is a lattice with the same meet and join operations as ''L''.  That is, if ''L'' is a lattice and {{nowrap|''M'' ≠ &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;}} is a subset of ''L'' such that for every pair of elements ''a'', ''b'' in ''M'' both {{nowrap|''a'' ∧ ''b''}} and {{nowrap|''a'' ∨ ''b''}} are in ''M'', then ''M'' is a sublattice of ''L''.&lt;ref&gt;Burris, Stanley N., and H.P. Sankappanavar, H. P., 1981. [http://www.thoralf.uwaterloo.ca/htdocs/ualg.html ''A Course in Universal Algebra''.]  Springer-Verlag. {{isbn|3-540-90578-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A sublattice ''M'' of a lattice ''L'' is a ''convex sublattice'' of ''L'', if {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''z'' ≤ ''y''}} and ''x'', ''y'' in ''M'' implies that ''z'' belongs to ''M'', for all elements ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in ''L''.

== Properties of lattices ==
{{further|Map of lattices}}
We now introduce a number of important properties that lead to interesting special classes of lattices. One, boundedness, has already been discussed.

=== Completeness ===
{{main|Complete lattice}}
A poset is called a '''complete lattice''' if ''all'' its subsets have both a join and a meet. In particular, every complete lattice is a bounded lattice. While bounded lattice homomorphisms in general preserve only finite joins and meets, complete lattice homomorphisms are required to preserve arbitrary joins and meets.

Every poset that is a complete semilattice is also a complete lattice. Related to this result is the interesting phenomenon that there are various competing notions of homomorphism for this class of posets, depending on whether they are seen as complete lattices, complete join-semilattices, complete meet-semilattices, or as join-complete or meet-complete lattices.

Note that "partial lattice" is not the opposite of "complete lattice" – rather, "partial lattice", "lattice", and "complete lattice" are increasingly restrictive definitions.

=== Conditional completeness ===
A '''conditionally complete lattice''' is a lattice in which every ''nonempty'' subset ''that has an upper bound'' has a join (i.e., a least upper bound).  Such lattices provide the most direct generalization of the [[completeness axiom]] of the [[real number]]s.  A conditionally complete lattice is either a complete lattice, or a complete lattice without its maximum element 1, its minimum element 0, or both.

=== Distributivity ===
{| style="float:right"
|-
| [[File:N 5 mit Beschriftung.svg|thumb|x150px|'''Pic.11:''' Smallest non-modular (and hence non-distributive) lattice N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;br&gt;The labelled elements violate the distributivity equation {{nowrap|1=''c'' ∧ (''a'' ∨ ''b'') = (''c'' ∧ ''a'') ∨ (''c'' ∧ ''b'')}}, but satisfy its dual {{nowrap|1=''c'' ∨ (''a'' ∧ ''b'') = (''c'' ∨ ''a'') ∧ (''c'' ∨ ''b'')}}.]]
|}
{| style="float:right"
|-
| [[File:M 3 mit Beschriftung.svg|thumb|x150px|'''Pic.10:''' Smallest non-distributive (but modular) lattice M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
|}
{{main|Distributive lattice}}
Since lattices come with two binary operations, it is natural to ask whether one of them [[distributivity|distributes]] over the other, i.e. whether one or the other of the following [[duality (order theory)|dual]] laws holds for every three elements ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' of ''L'':

;Distributivity of ∨ over ∧
: ''a'' ∨ (''b'' ∧ ''c'') = (''a'' ∨ ''b'') ∧ (''a'' ∨ ''c'').
;Distributivity of ∧ over ∨
: ''a'' ∧ (''b'' ∨ ''c'') = (''a'' ∧ ''b'') ∨ (''a'' ∧ ''c'').

A lattice that satisfies the first or, equivalently (as it turns out), the second axiom, is called a '''distributive lattice'''.
The only non-distributive lattices with fewer than 6 elements are called M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Davey|Priestley|2002}}, Exercise 4.1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vVVTxeuiyvQC&amp;pg=PA104 p.&amp;nbsp;104].&lt;/ref&gt; they are shown in picture 10 and 11, respectively. A lattice is distributive if and only if it doesn't have a [[#Sublattices|sublattice]] isomorphic to M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Davey.Priestley.2002.10.6"&gt;{{harvtxt|Davey|Priestley|2002}}, Theorem 4.10, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vVVTxeuiyvQC&amp;pg=PA89 p.&amp;nbsp;89].&lt;/ref&gt; Each distributive lattice is isomorphic to a lattice of sets (with union and intersection as join and meet, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Davey|Priestley|2002}}, Theorem 10.21, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vVVTxeuiyvQC&amp;pg=PA238 pp.&amp;nbsp;238–239].&lt;/ref&gt;

For an overview of stronger notions of distributivity which are appropriate for complete lattices and which are used to define more special classes of lattices such as [[complete Heyting algebra|frames]] and [[completely distributive lattice]]s, see [[distributivity (order theory)|distributivity in order theory]].

===Modularity===
{{main|Modular lattice}}
For some applications the distributivity condition is too strong, and the following weaker property is often useful. A lattice {{nowrap|(''L'', ∨, ∧)}} is '''modular''' if, for all elements ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' of ''L'', the following identity holds.
;'''Modular identity''': (''a'' ∧ ''c'') ∨ (''b'' ∧ ''c'') = [(''a'' ∧ ''c'') ∨ ''b''] ∧ ''c''.
This condition is equivalent to the following axiom.
;'''Modular law''': {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''c''}} implies {{nowrap|1=''a'' ∨ (''b'' ∧ ''c'') = (''a'' ∨ ''b'') ∧ ''c''}}.
A lattice is modular if and only if it doesn't have a [[#Sublattices|sublattice]] isomorphic to N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (shown in pic.11).&lt;ref name="Davey.Priestley.2002.10.6"/&gt; 
Besides distributive lattices, examples of modular lattices are the lattice of [[two-sided ideal]]s of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], the lattice of submodules of a [[module (mathematics)|module]], and the lattice of [[normal subgroup]]s of a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. The [[Subsumption lattice|set of first-order terms]] with the ordering "''is more specific than''" is a non-modular lattice used in [[automated reasoning]].

===Semimodularity===
{{main|Semimodular lattice}}
A finite lattice is modular if and only if it is both upper and lower [[semimodular lattice|semimodular]]. For a graded lattice, (upper) semimodularity is equivalent to the following condition on the rank function ''r'':
:''r''(''x'') + ''r''(''y'') ≥ ''r''(''x'' ∧ ''y'') + ''r''(''x'' ∨ ''y'').
Another equivalent (for graded lattices) condition is Birkhoff's condition:
: for each ''x'' and ''y'' in ''L'', if ''x'' and ''y'' both cover {{nowrap|''x'' ∧ ''y''}}, then {{nowrap|''x'' ∨ ''y''}} covers both ''x'' and ''y''.

A lattice is called lower semimodular if its dual is semimodular. For finite lattices this means that the previous conditions hold with ∨ and ∧ exchanged, "covers" exchanged with "is covered by", and inequalities reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Stanley | first=Richard P | authorlink=Richard P. Stanley | title=Enumerative Combinatorics (vol. 1) | publisher=Cambridge University Press | pages=103–104 | isbn=0-521-66351-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continuity and algebraicity ===

In [[domain theory]], it is natural to seek to approximate the elements in a partial order by "much simpler" elements. This leads to the class of [[continuous poset]]s, consisting of posets where every element can be obtained as the supremum of a [[directed set]] of elements that are [[way-below relation|way-below]] the element. If one can additionally restrict these to the [[compact element]]s of a poset for obtaining these directed sets, then the poset is even [[algebraic poset|algebraic]]. Both concepts can be applied to lattices as follows:

* A '''continuous lattice''' is a complete lattice that is continuous as a poset.
* An '''[[algebraic lattice]]''' is a complete lattice that is algebraic as a poset.

Both of these classes have interesting properties. For example, continuous lattices can be characterized as algebraic structures (with infinitary operations) satisfying certain identities. While such a characterization is not known for algebraic lattices, they can be described "syntactically" via [[Scott information system]]s.

=== Complements and pseudo-complements ===
Let ''L'' be a bounded lattice with greatest element 1 and least element 0. Two elements ''x'' and ''y'' of ''L'' are '''complements''' of each other if and only if:

: {{nowrap|1=''x'' ∨ ''y'' = 1}} and {{nowrap|1=''x'' ∧ ''y'' = 0}}.

In general, some elements of a bounded lattice might not have a complement, and others might have more than one complement. For example, the set {0, ½, 1} with its usual ordering is a bounded lattice, and ½ does not have a complement. In the bounded lattice N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, the element ''a'' has two complements, viz. ''b'' and ''c'' (see Pic.11). A bounded lattice for which every element has a complement is called a [[complemented lattice]]. 

A complemented lattice that is also distributive is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]. For a distributive lattice, the complement of ''x'', when it exists, is unique.

In the case the complement is unique, we write {{nowrap|1=¬''x'' = ''y''}} and equivalently, {{nowrap|1=¬''y'' = ''x''}}. The corresponding unary [[Operation (mathematics)|operation]] over ''L'', called complementation, introduces an analogue of logical [[negation]] into lattice theory.

[[Heyting algebra]]s are an example of distributive lattices where some members might be lacking complements. Every element ''x'' of a Heyting algebra has, on the other hand, a ''pseudo-complement'', also denoted ¬''x''. The pseudo-complement is the greatest element ''y'' such that {{nowrap|1=''x'' ∧ ''y'' = 0}}. If the pseudo-complement of every element of a Heyting algebra is in fact a complement, then the Heyting algebra is in fact a Boolean algebra.

=== Jordan–Dedekind chain condition ===
A '''chain''' from ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a set &lt;math&gt;\{ x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x_0 &lt; x_1 &lt; x_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; x_n&lt;/math&gt;.
The '''length''' of this chain is ''n'', or one less than its number of elements. A chain is '''maximal''' if ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; covers ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt; 
for all {{nowrap|1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n''}}.

If for any pair, ''x'' and ''y'', where {{nowrap|''x'' &lt; ''y''}}, all maximal chains from ''x'' to ''y'' have the same length, then the lattice is said to satisfy the '''Jordan–Dedekind chain condition'''.

== Free lattices ==
{{main|Free lattice}}
Any set ''X'' may be used to generate the '''free semilattice''' ''FX''. The free semilattice is defined to consist of all of the finite subsets of ''X'', with the semilattice operation given by ordinary [[set union]].  The free semilattice has the [[universal property]]. For the '''free lattice''' over a set ''X'', [[Philip M. Whitman|Whitman]] gave a construction based on polynomials over ''X''{{'}}s members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Philip Whitman | title=Free Lattices I | journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] | volume=42 |  pages=325–329 |  year=1941 | doi=10.2307/1969001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Philip Whitman | title=Free Lattices II | journal=Annals of Mathematics | volume=43 |  pages=104–115 |  year=1942 | doi=10.2307/1968883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Important lattice-theoretic notions ==
We now define some order-theoretic notions of importance to lattice theory. In the following, let ''x'' be an element of some lattice ''L''. If ''L'' has a bottom element 0, {{nowrap|''x'' ≠ 0}} is sometimes required. ''x'' is called:
*'''Join irreducible''' if {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''a'' ∨ ''b''}} implies {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''a''}} or {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''b''}} for all ''a'', ''b'' in ''L''. When the first condition is generalized to arbitrary joins &lt;math&gt;\bigvee_{i \in I} a_i&lt;/math&gt;, ''x'' is called '''completely join irreducible''' (or ∨-irreducible). The dual notion is '''meet irreducibility''' (∧-irreducible). For example, in pic.2, the elements 2, 3, 4, and 5 are join irreducible, while 12, 15, 20, and 30 are meet irreducible. In the lattice of [[real numbers]] with the usual order, each element is join irreducible, but none is completely join irreducible.
*'''Join prime''' if {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''a'' ∨ ''b''}} implies {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''a''}} or {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''b''}}. This too can be generalized to obtain the notion '''completely join prime'''. The dual notion is '''meet prime'''. Every join-prime element is also join irreducible, and every meet-prime element is also meet irreducible. The converse holds if ''L'' is distributive.

Let ''L'' have a bottom element 0. An element ''x'' of ''L'' is an [[atom (order theory)|atom]] if {{nowrap|0 &lt; ''x''}} and there exists no element ''y'' of ''L'' such that {{nowrap|0 &lt; ''y'' &lt; ''x''}}. Then ''L'' is called:
* [[atomic (order theory)|Atomic]] if for every nonzero element ''x'' of ''L'', there exists an atom ''a'' of ''L'' such that {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''x''}};
* [[atomic (order theory)|Atomistic]] if every element of ''L'' is a [[supremum]] of atoms.

The notions of [[ideal (order theory)|ideal]]s and the dual notion of [[filter (mathematics)|filters]] refer to particular kinds of [[subset]]s of a partially ordered set, and are therefore important for lattice theory. Details can be found in the respective entries.

'''Legal archaeology''' is an area of legal scholarship "involving detailed historical reconstruction and analysis of important cases." &lt;ref name = &gt;Charles L. Knapp, Nathan M. Crystal, and Harry G. Prince, ''Problems in Contract Law: Cases and Materials: Fifth Edition'', pp. 749-50, Aspen Publishers, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

While most legal scholars confine their research to published opinions of court cases, legal archaeologists examine the historical and social context in which a court case was decided. These facts may show what social and cultural forces were at work in a particular case. Professors can use legal archaeology to "sensitize students as to how inequality, specifically with regard to race, gender and class affects what occurs throughout the cases they study." &lt;ref name = Vogel&gt;Joan Vogel, ''Cases in Context: Lake Champlain Wars, Gentrification, and Ploof v. Putnam'', 45 St. Louis U. L. J. 791, 792.&lt;/ref&gt; A legal archaeologist might also research biographical material on the judges, attorneys, and parties to a court case. Such information might show whether a judge held particular biases in a case, or if one party had superior legal representation that caused the party to prevail in a case. &lt;ref name = Maute&gt;Judith Maute, ''Response: The Values of Legal Archaeology'', 2000 Utah L. Rev. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Making a mountain out of a molehill''' is an [[idiom]] referring to over-reactive, histrionic behaviour where a person makes too much of a minor issue. It seems to have come into existence in the 16th century.

==Metaphor==
[[File:Molehill Country - geograph.org.uk - 140468.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Molehills at the foot of a Scottish mountain]]

The idiom is a [[metaphor]] for the common [[behaviour]] of responding disproportionately to something - usually an adverse circumstance. One who ''"makes a mountain out of a molehill"'' is said to be greatly exaggerating the severity of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/make-a-mountain-out-of-a-molehill Cambridge Advanced Learner’s Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[cognitive psychology]], this form of [[cognitive distortion|distortion]] is called [[Exaggeration|magnification]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Cognitive Behavioral Workbook for Depression |page=106 |author=William J. Knaus, Albert Ellis  |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p_3PYxltgXoC&amp;pg=PA106}}&lt;/ref&gt; or overreacting. The phrase itself is so common that a study by psychologists found that with respect to familiarity and image value, it ranks high among the 203 common sayings they tested.&lt;ref name=Visual&gt;Kenneth L. Higbee and Richard J. Millard, ''Visual imagery and familiarity ratings for 203 sayings'', Am. J. Psychiatry, Summer 1983, Vol. 96, No. 2, pp. 211–22; found at [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1422812 JSTOR website]. Retrieved January 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar idioms include 'Much ado about nothing' and 'Making a song and dance about nothing'. The meaning finds its opposite in the fable about [[The Mountain in Labour|the mountain in labour]] that gives birth to a mouse. In the former too much is made of little; in the latter one is led to expect much, but with too little result. The two appear to converge in [[William Caxton]]'s translation of the fable (1484), where he makes of the mountain ''a hylle whiche beganne to tremble and shake by cause of the molle whiche delved it''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/caxton/25.htm |title=2.5. Of the Montayn whiche shoke (Caxton's Aesop) |publisher=Mythfolklore.net |date= |accessdate=2013-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, he mimics the meaning of the fable by turning a mountain into a molehill. It was in the context of this bringing together of the two ideas that the English idiom grew.

==Origin==
The earliest recorded use of the [[alliteration|alliterative]] phrase making a mountain out of a molehill dates from 1548. The word for the animal involved was less than two hundred years old by then. Previous to that the [[Mole (animal)|mole]] had been known by its [[Old English]] name ''wand'', which had slowly changed to 'want'. A [[molehill]] was known as a 'wantitump', a word that continued in dialect use for centuries more.&lt;ref&gt;J.O.Halliwell, ''A Dictionary of Archaic and Provincial Words'', London 1847&lt;/ref&gt; The former name of want was then replaced by ''mold(e)warp'' (meaning earth-thrower),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/moldwarp?s=t|title=moldwarp |publisher=dictionary.com |accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a shortened version of which (''molle'') began to appear in the later 14th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mole |title=mole |publisher=dictionary.com |accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the word molehill in the first half of the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/molehill|title=molehill |publisher=dictionary.com |accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idiom is found in [[Nicholas Udall]]'s translation of ''[[The first tome or volume of the Paraphrase of Erasmus vpon the newe testamente]]'' (1548) in the statement that "The Sophistes of Grece coulde through their copiousness make an Elephant of a flye, and a mountaine of a mollehill."  The comparison of the elephant with a fly (''elephantem ex musca facere'') is an old Latin proverb that Erasmus recorded in his collection of such phrases, the [[Adagia]],&lt;ref&gt;1.9.69, [http://widgets.bestmoodle.net/scriptdata/adagia_animals_data.html Erasmian animal idioms]&lt;/ref&gt; European variations on which persist. The mountain and molehill seem to have been added by Udall&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/14/magazine/on-language.html?pagewanted=1 |title=On Language – The Earth Makes Its Move | author=William Safire |date=June 14, 1987 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the phrase has continued in popular use ever since. If the idiom was not coined by Udall himself, the linguistic evidence above suggests that it cannot have been in existence long.

'''Mathematical exposure modeling''' is an indirect method of determining [[exposure assessment|exposure]], particularly for human exposure to [[pollution|environmental contaminants]].  It is useful when direct measurement of pollutant concentration is not feasible because direct measurement sometimes requires skilled professionals and complex, expensive laboratory equipment.  The ability to make inferences in the absence of direct measurements, makes exposure modeling a powerful tool for predicting exposures by exploring hypothetical situations.  It allows researchers to ask [[sensitivity analysis|"what if"]] questions about exposure scenarios.

== Modeling indoor air ==

Mathematical modeling is commonly used to determine human exposure to indoor air pollution.  Studies have shown that humans spend about 90% of their time indoors, and contaminant levels may be as high or higher inside than outside, due to the presence of multiple indoor contaminant sources, in combination with poor ventilation.  Indoor air modeling requires information on a number of parameters including the air exchange rate, [[Deposition (Aerosol physics)|deposition rate]], source emission rate, and physical volume of the indoor setting.  Indoor environments can basically be thought of as [[closed systems]], so models describing them are usually based on the "[[mass balance]]" equation.  It is also assumed that a pollutant emitted into an indoor environment instantly spreads uniformly throughout the system, so that the concentration is the same at any point in space at any point in time.  Mathematically, the total pollutant mass emitted inside a chamber during time T can be expressed as&lt;br&gt;
::G&lt;sub&gt;source&lt;/sub&gt;(T) = &lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{T} g(t)\, dt&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::G&lt;sub&gt;source&lt;/sub&gt;(T) = total mass contributed by the source over time T (e.g., mg)
::g(t) = emission flow rate as a function of time t (e.g., mg/min)

The total mass lost during time T can be expressed as&lt;br&gt;
::Q&lt;sub&gt;lost&lt;/sub&gt;(T) = &lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{T} wx(t)\, dt&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::Q&lt;sub&gt;lost&lt;/sub&gt;(T) = total mass lost from the chamber over time T (e.g., mg)
::x(t) = concentration of pollutant in the air exiting the chamber (e.g., mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
::w = flow rate of air exiting the chamber (e.g., m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/min)

Following the principle of the "mass balance" equation, the total mass in the chamber at time T, is the difference between the two equations above, mass generated during time T minus mass lost during time T.  This value may also be calculated from the equation&lt;br&gt;
::Total mass inside the chamber at time T = vx(T)

== Modeling human exposure to air pollution ==
There are two critical pieces of information that are needed to calculate human exposure.  These include data on 1) the whereabouts of the individual or individuals being exposed and 2) the concentration of the pollutants in the different locations.  This can be expressed mathematically as the sum of the products of time spent by a person in those different locations by the time-averaged [[air pollutant concentrations]] occurring in those locations.&lt;br&gt;
::E&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^m&lt;/math&gt; C&lt;sub&gt;''pi''&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;''pi''&lt;/sub&gt;
:where
::T&lt;sub&gt;''pi''&lt;/sub&gt; is the time spent by person ''p'' in microenvironment ''i'', and C&lt;sub&gt;''pi''&lt;/sub&gt; is the concentration of the air pollutant that person ''p'' experiences in microenvironment ''i'', E&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is the integrated exposure for person ''p'' and ''m'' is the number of different microenvironments.

As mentioned above, knowing the whereabouts of the individual or individuals, is very important when trying to determine air pollution exposure.  In the absence of data obtained from direct observation, human activity pattern data may be used.  This data can be found in several reports conducted by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]].  The data was collected through the National Human Activity Pattern Survey (NHAPS), and contains a representative cross-section of 24-hour daily activity patterns.  This data can be used to create inhalation exposure models which can serve as useful public health tools for [[epidemiology]], education, intervention, [[risk assessment]], and creation of air quality guidelines.

The '''Mayfair Exponential Game System''' or '''MEGS''' is a [[role-playing game system|rules system]] developed for [[role-playing games]]. The name was what fans called the game system for ''[[DC Heroes]]'', which was later used for ''[[Underground (role playing game)|Underground]]'' (1993).&lt;ref name="designers"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers &amp; Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is noteworthy for its use of an exponential system for measuring nearly everything in the game.  This system makes it possible to have both cosmically-powered characters and ordinary human characters meaningfully interact within the same universe.  For example, in ''[[DC Heroes]]'', the first game to use MEGS, [[Superman]]'s strength is several [[orders of magnitude]] more than [[Batman]]'s.  With the MEGS system, however, this large difference in strength is scaled down.  So, while Superman would still have a clear advantage in a brawl, Batman is at least able to hold out for a while, mirroring how superhero combat often operates in [[comic books]].

==History==
MEGS was originally developed for the company [[Mayfair Games]] for the modern [[superhero]] RPG ''[[DC Heroes]]''.  The system was heavily modified for Mayfair's [[cyberpunk]] war veteran RPG ''[[Underground (role playing game)|Underground]]''.  The original incarnation of [[Pulsar Games]] licensed MEGS from Mayfair Games and used it in their modern superhero RPG ''[[Blood of Heroes (role-playing game)|Blood of Heroes]]''.  ''Blood of Heroes'' is very similar to ''DC Heroes'', mostly replacing the superheroes created by [[DC Comics]] with new ones for the ''Blood of Heroes'' universe.

==Mechanics==
All measurements in MEGS are done using a [[logarithmic scale]].  The units on this scale are called "Attribute Points" or "APs" in the superhero games and simply "Units" in Underground, with each unit on the scale represents exponentially increasing values for length, weight, time, etc.  Because of the nature of logarithms and exponents, 0 APs/Units is a meaningful, positive value.  Indeed, even negative APs/Units still represent positive values, though exponentially smaller, down to -100 APs, which is defined as absolute zero for all units.

In the superhero games, 1 AP corresponds to 8 seconds, {{convert|20|ft|m}}, {{convert|100|lb|kg}}, {{convert|2|cuft|L}}, [[USD|$]]50, or a typed [[Page (paper)|page]] of information.  A single increase of an AP roughly doubles the value, so 2 APs of weight is about 200 pounds, while 6 APs of weight is about 3200 pounds, or about 1.5 [[ton]]s.  

In Underground, 1 Unit corresponds to 5 seconds, {{convert|12|ft|m}}, {{convert|125|lb|kg}}, {{convert|64|cuft|L}}, or a bit more than a [[paragraph]] of text.  An increase of 3 Units represents a doubling of the related value, so 4 Units of weight is about 250 pounds, while 7 Units of weight is about 500 pounds.

Multiplication and division of raw values are simplified to addition and subtraction on a logarithmic scale, so the MEGS scale functions essentially the same way that [[slide rules]] do.  For example, raw distance travelled is normally calculated by multiplying raw speed by raw time.  In MEGS, speed and time in APs/Units are simply added together to yield the distance travelled in APs/Units.  So a car traveling at a speed of 5 APs (about 55 MPH) for 9 APs of time (about 34 minutes) will travel 5+9=14 APs of distance (about 31 miles).  The results of other important game events can be determined in similar ways, such as calculating the distance an object can be thrown (the [[player character|PC]]'s strength score minus the weight of the object).

'''Media art history''' is an interdisciplinary field of research that explores the current developments as well as the history and genealogy of [[new media art]], [[digital art]], and [[electronic art]].&lt;ref&gt;Cubitt, Sean and Paul Thomas. eds. 2013. Relive: Media Art Histories. Cambridge/Mass.: MIT-Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grau, Oliver. ed. 2007. MediaArtHistories. Cambridge: MIT-Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frieling, Rudolf and Dieter Daniels. eds. 2004. Media Art Net 1: Survey of Media Art. New York/Vienna: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; On the one hand, media art histories addresses the contemporary interplay of art, technology, and science.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Stephen. 2002. Information Arts. Intersections of Art, Science, and Technology Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Stephen. 2010. Art + Science Now. London: Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Linda. 1983. The Fourth Dimension and Non - Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art . Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other, it aims to reveal the historical relationships and aspects of the ‘afterlife’ ([[Aby Warburg]]) in new media art by means of a historical comparative approach. This strand of research encompasses questions of the history of media and perception, of so-called archetypes,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;Grau, Oliver. 2003. Virtual Art: From Illusion to Immersion. Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as those of [[iconography]] and the [[history of ideas]]. Moreover, one of the main agendas of media art histories is to point out the role of digital technologies for contemporary, post-industrial societies and to counteract the marginalization of according art practices and art objects: ″Digital technology has fundamentally changed the way art is made. Over the last forty years, media art has become a significant part of our networked information society. Although there are well-attended international festivals, collaborative research projects, exhibitions and database documentation resources, media art research is still marginal in universities, museums and archives. It remains largely under-resourced in our core cultural institutions.″&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mediaarthistory.org/declaration&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[new media art]] itself is of great importance to the field.&lt;ref&gt;Rush, Michael. 2005. New Media in Art. London: Thames &amp; Hudson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tribe, Mark, Reena Jana and Uta Grosenick. 2006. New Media Art. Köln: Taschen.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shanken, Edward A. 2009. Art and Electronic Media. London: Phaidon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Christiane. 2003. Digital Art. New York: Thames and Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; New media art is an umbrella term that encompasses art forms that are produced, modified and transmitted by means of [[Digital technology|digital technologies]] or, in a broader sense, make use of ‘new’ and emerging technologies that originate from a scientific, military or industrial context. The majority of authors that try to ‘delineate’ the aesthetic object of new media art emphasize aspects of [[interactivity]], processuality, [[multimedia]], and [[real time (media)|real time]]. The focus of new media art lies in the cultural, political, and social implications as well as the aesthetic possibilities – more or less its ‘media-specificity’ – of digital media. Consequently, scholars recognize the function of media technologies in New Media Art not only as a ‘carrier’ of meaning, but instead as a means that fundamentally shapes the very meaning of the artwork itself.

Furthermore, the field of new media art is increasingly influenced by new technologies that surmount a traditional understanding of (art) media. This becomes apparent in regards to technologies that originate from the field of biotechnology and life science and that are employed in artistic practices such as bio art, genetic art, and transgenic art. Consequently, the term new media art does not imply a steady ‘genre’ of art production. Instead, it is a field that emphasizes new technologies (in order to establish an explicit difference with traditional art media and genres). The list of genres that are commonly subsumed under the label of new media art illustrates its broad scope and includes, among others, virtual art.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Frank. 2007.

== Resources and research projects ==

Since the end of the 1990s, the first online databases came into being, as exemplified by the university-based Archive of Digital Art,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalartarchive.at/nc/home.html&lt;/ref&gt; Rhizome&lt;ref&gt;http://rhizome.org/&lt;/ref&gt; platform located in New York, Netzspannung&lt;ref&gt;http://netzspannung.org/&lt;/ref&gt; (until 2005), the database project Compart&lt;ref&gt;http://dada.compart-bremen.de/&lt;/ref&gt; in which early phase of Digital Art is addressed, and the collaborative online platform Monoskop.&lt;ref&gt;http://monoskop.org/Monoskop&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of institutional resources, media art histories spans diverse organisations, archives, research centres as well as private initiatives. Already at this early stage in the development of the field, the actors of media art histories were connected by way of digital communication, especially by so-called mailing lists such as [[Nettime]] or Rohrpost, both channels of communication that remain prime resources for the new media art community.

In the last few years, there was a significant increase of festivals and conferences dedicated to new media art, though the dominant festivals in the field continue to be the [[Ars Electronica]], the [[Transmediale]], the [[Inter-Society for the Electronic Arts|ISEA]] (Inter-Society for the Electronic Arts), and [[SIGGRAPH]] (Special Interest Group on Graphics and Interactive Techniques). To this day, museums and research facilities specializing in New Media Art are the exception. Nevertheless, [[ZKM]] (Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie) or specific focuses in collections (including the [[Whitney Museum]], the [[New York Museum of Modern Art]], or the [[Walker Art Center]]) serve as important spaces for exchange. Beyond museums that reach a wider audience, there are more and more smaller museums and galleries that focus on new media art (such as the Berlin-based DAM – Digital Art Museum).  Additionally, archives in which are exhibited artifacts situated at the intersection of the histories of media, art, and technology are important resources, including collections such as that of Werner Nekes or those cabinets of wonder and curiosity incorporated in art history museums.

Even given this increase in festivals, however, a variety of significant research initiatives have been discontinued.  These include the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Media.Art.Research, the Daniel Langlois Foundation for Art, Science and Technology,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/&lt;/ref&gt; and Media Art Net.  This difficulty in establishing sustainable funding structures as well as support for access to shared data for the scientific research of new media art was made public and addressed by the [http://www.mediaarthistory.org/declaration Liverpool Declaration]. Scholars and artists based at institutions all over the globe signed the declaration in a call to develop systematic strategies to fulfill the task that digital culture and its research demands in the 21st Century.&lt;ref&gt;Signatories are, among others, Sean CUBITT, Goldsmith; Oliver GRAU, Danube U; Ross HARLEY, UNSW Sydney;  Christiane PAUL, New School, New York; Diana DOMINGUES, Universidade de Brasília; Horst BREDEKAMP, Humboldt-University Berlin; Barbara Maria STAFFORD, Georgia Tech; Frieder NAKE, University of Bremen; Peter WEIBEL, ZKM; Roy ASCOTT, University of Plymouth, Sir Nicholas SEROTA, Tate; Martin WARNKE, Leuphana University, Mike STUBBS, FACT Liverpool; Benjamin WEIL, LABORAL; Andreas BROECKMANN, Leuphana Arts Program; Jeffrey SHAW, City University Hong Kong; Eduardo KAC, Chicago Arts Institute; Christa SOMMERER, University of Art Linz; Alex ADRIAANSENS, Institute for the Unstable Media, Lanfranco ACETI, Sabanci U; Howard BESSER, NYU’s  Tisch School of the Arts, Ianina PRUDENKO, National Univ.

Already in the late 1990s it became clear, that media art research is spread over many disciplines and the need became urgent to give it common ground: Therefore, at Humboldt University Berlin Oliver Grau in Cooperation with Roger Malina, Leonardo and Sara Diamond, Banff Center developed the international Conference Series on the Histories of MediaArt, Science and Technology, which was started in 2005 through a collective process, involving more than 10 disciplines related to media art. The world conference series attempts to foster the exchange between these different disciplines and their various actors. To date, the conference took place six times with Re-fresh (Banff 2005), Re-place (Berlin 2007), Re-live (Melbourne 2009), Re-wire (Liverpool 2011), Re-new (Riga 2013), Re-create (Montreal 2015), upcoming Vienna/Krems ad Donau (2017). Documentation of the meanwhile more than 2000 papers and applications can be found on MediaArtHistory.org [http://www.mediaarthistory.org/]

== Focus of research ==

Several scholars in the field of media art history claim that there is still a considerable lack of knowledge regarding the origins of visual and audio-visual media.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Grau, Oliver. Introduction. In MediaArtHistories, edited by Oliver Grau, 1-14. Cambridge: MIT Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, it is the objective of media art histories to expand the historically informed knowledge of current media cultures with its developments and detours – the field is driven by the idea of a ‘deep time of the media’ (S. Zielinski).

Hence, scholars stress that the technological advances in current media cultures are best understood on the backdrop of an extensive media and art history. Contributions to this field are widespread and include, among others, researchers who have disciplinary focuses such as the history of science ([[Lorraine Daston]], Timothy Lenoir), art history and image science ([[Oliver Grau]], [[Barbara Stafford]], Dieter Daniels, Slavko Kacunko, [[Edward A. Shanken]], Gunalan Nadarajan, Linda Henderson, Andreas Broeckmann, [[Jonathan Crary]], [[Horst Bredekamp]], [[Peter Weibel]], [[Hans Belting]]), [[media studies]] and [[media archaeology]] ([[Friedrich Kittler]], [[Erkki Huhtamo]], [[Jussi Parikka]], [[ Wolfgang Ernst (media theorist)|Wolfgang Ernst]], [[Siegfried Zielinski]], Stephan Oettermann, [[Lev Manovich]]), [[sound studies]] ([[Douglas Kahn]]), [[film studies]] (Sean Cubitt, Ryszard Kluszczyński), as well as [[computer science]] ([[Frieder Nake]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38982">'''Body shape''' refers to the many physical attributes of the [[human body]] that make up its appearance, including size and countenance. [[Body shape]] has come to imply not only sexual/reproductive ability, but [[Wellness (medicine)|wellness]] and [[physical fitness|fitness]]. In the [[Western culture|West]], slenderness is associated with happiness, success, youth, and social acceptability. Being [[overweight]] is associated with laziness. The media promote a weight-conscious standard for women more often than for men.&lt;ref name="Sex Roles"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Silverstein, Perdue, Peterson, and Kelly|title=The role of the mass media in promoting a thin standard of bodily attractiveness for women|journal=Sex Roles|year=1986|volume=14|issue=9–10|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/rn84077187531j83/|accessdate=11 April 2012|doi=10.1007/BF00287452|pages=519–532}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Deviance from these norms result in social consequences.&lt;ref name=SG&gt;{{cite book|last=Grogan|first=Sarah|title=Body Image Understanding body dissatisfaction in men, women, and Children|year=2008|publisher=Psychology Press|edition= Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media perpetuate this ideal in various ways, particularly glorifying and focusing on thin actors and actresses, models, and other public figures while avoiding the use or image of overweight individuals.

It has been stated that the increase in [[eating disorder]]s over the past several decades has coincided with an overall decrease (pound-wise) in women's [[ideal body weight]] portrayed by the [[mass media]].&lt;ref name="No Longer Just a Pretty Face" /&gt; A group of researchers examined the magazines [[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]], [[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]], [[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]], and [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] from 1959 to 1999.  [[Fashion model]]s became increasingly thinner during the 1980s and 1990s, making [[The Thin Ideal|the thin ideal]] even more difficult for women to achieve.  Photos depicting the models' entire bodies significantly increased in number from the 1960s to the 1990s.  From 1995 to 1999 models were dressed in far more revealing outfits than they were from 1959 to 1963.&lt;ref name="No Longer Just a Pretty Face"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sypeck|first=Mia Foley|author2=Gray, James J. |author3= Ahrens, Anthony H.|title=No Longer Just a Pretty Face: Fashion Magazines' Depictions of Ideal Female Beauty from 1959 to 1999|journal=International Journal of Eating Disorders|date=November 2004|volume=36|issue=3|pages=342–347|pmid=15478132|doi=10.1002/eat.20039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Women's magazine]]s have been criticized for their conflicting messages, with an emphasis on [[food]], [[cooking]], [[child rearing]], and entertaining.  75% of women's magazines contain at least one ad or article about how to alter one's appearance through [[cosmetic surgery]], [[Dieting|diet]], or [[exercise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Malkin, Wornian, Chrisler|title=Women and Weight: Gendered Messages on Magazine Covers|journal=Sex Roles|year=1999|volume=40|doi=10.1023/A:1018848332464|pages=647–655}}&lt;/ref&gt; 25% of the women's magazines surveyed included tips for dieting or messages about weight loss.  Many women's magazines focus on how to lead a better life by improving physical appearance.

Much of the research pertaining to how the media effects body image examines the change in models and magazine articles over time. Garner, Garfinkel, Schwartz, and Thompson paid particular attention to the difference in body shape of Playboy centerfolds over a 20-year period. They found that over the years, the body mass, bust, and hip measurements decreased; however, the height increased.  They also determined that the Playboy centerfolds were 13%-19% lower than the normal body weight for women of their age (Cusumano, Thompson 1997). Other studies found that over the years, magazines like Seventeen, YM, and Cosmopolitan all had an increase in articles pertaining to diet and exercise. Anderson and DiDomenico (1992) compared women's and men's popular magazines and found that diet and exercise articles appeared more than 10 times as much in women's magazines than men's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthpsych.psy.vanderbilt.edu/2009/BodyImageMedia.htm|title=Effects of the Media on Body Image|last=Kovar|first=Allie|date=30 April 2009|website=Vanderbilt Psychology Department|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models==
Modeling and fashion industries have come under fire in recent years for embracing and promoting an ultra-thin appearance, giving "unhealthy stigma".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/summer-rayne-oakes/the-skinny-of-fashions-body-image-issue_b_3308004.html|title=The Skinny of Fashion's Body-Image Issue|last=Oakes|first=Summer|date=22 May 2013|website=Huffington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a data research done by Might Goods using 3,000 models from 20 leading model agencies, 94% of the models are underweight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mightygoods.com/underweight-fashion-models|title=94% of All Fashion Models are underweight|last=|first=|date=11 September 2017|website=Mighty Goods|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in a recent study conducted by Jennifer Brenner and Joseph Cunningham, it was observed that the majority of female models were underweight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brenner|first=Jennifer B.|last2=Cunningham|first2=Joseph G.|date=1992-10-01|title=Gender differences in eating attitudes, body concept, and self-esteem among models|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00289949|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=27|issue=7-8|pages=413–437|doi=10.1007/BF00289949|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The average American female fashion model begins working in the modeling business at ages 13–17 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/220912/average-age-for-models-to-start-in-the-business/|title=Models - average age for starting in the business {{!}} Survey 2011|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average female model in the United States weighs in ranging from 90 pounds to 120 pounds  and an average of 5'8" to 5'11" tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/maceyjforonda/street-style-surveys-what-are-the-ideal-stats-for-a-fashion|title=Street Style Surveys: What Are The Ideal Stats For A Fashion Model?|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the average weight of a female is 168.5 pounds, and the average height for females is 5'4".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/body-measurements.htm|title=FastStats|date=2017-08-14|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the AMA (American Medical Association), thin models on the catwalk as well as social media and fashion photography lead to unrealistic body expectations, which in turn could lead to eating disorders and other emotional problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=Viewpoints&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchResultsType=SingleTab&amp;searchType=TopicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=42&amp;docId=GALE%7CEJ3010659244&amp;docType=Viewpoint+essay&amp;sort=Relevance&amp;contentSegment=&amp;prodId=OVIC&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CEJ3010659244&amp;topicId=00000000LVXR&amp;searchId=&amp;userGroupName=uiuc_oak&amp;inPS=true&amp;u=uiuc_oak&amp;authCount=1|title=Gale - Enter Product Login|website=go.galegroup.com|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the mass advertisement promoting thin body, plastic surgery and cosmetic surgery, women and young girls are being bombarded with this very idea of achieving thin body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://centerforchange.com/battling-bodies-understanding-overcoming-negative-body-images|title=Battling Our Bodies: Understanding and Overcoming Negative Body Images|last=Hawkins|first=Nicole|date=August 2014|website=Center For Change|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue is being control by some countries such as Israel and France in which they regulate the body mass indexes of models and let the public know whether the ad images is manipulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.racked.com/2017/9/6/16263360/lvmh-kering-skinny-model-ban|title=This isn't the answer to fashion's body image issues|last=Lieber|first=Chavie|date=6 September 2017|website=Racked|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photoshop is, "the altering (a photographic image) with Photoshop software or other image-editing software especially in a way that distorts reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/photoshop|title=Definition of PHOTOSHOP|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aerie, the lingerie line for American Eagle, began the campaign Aerie Real in which models were no longer photoshopped. A 2016 study showed that some women showed a smaller decrease in body satisfaction when seeing the photos of women untouched in comparison to the greater decrease in body satisfaction when seeing previous photos that were retouched.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Convertino|first=Alexandra D|last2=Rodgers|first2=Rachel F|last3=Franko|first3=Debra L|last4=Jodoin|first4=Adriana|title=An evaluation of the Aerie Real campaign: Potential for promoting positive body image?|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1359105316680022|journal=Journal of Health Psychology|doi=10.1177/1359105316680022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many well-known magazines have been called out for photoshopping, a few examples being ''AdWeek, InStyle, Modeliste Magazine, and Fashion Magazine.'' Celebrities have recently commented on changes that were made of their photos by such magazines. In 2015, Zendaya, a current 21 year old actress, singer, and dancer, posted two pictures side by side of her magazine photoshoot calling out the changes that were made by the magazine, Modeliste Magazine. She stated that, "There are the things that make women self conscious, that create the unrealistic ideals of beauty that we have".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/708613/zendaya-gets-photoshopped-singer-slams-magazine-for-promoting-unrealistic-beauty-ideals|title=Zendaya Slams Magazine for Photoshopping Her Pics|work=E!

Victoria's Secret puts on an annually televised Fashion Show in which its beautiful models walk down the runway in lingerie and latest releases for PINK, the clothing store of Victoria's Secret. In the televised showing, the models usually include how they prepared for the Fashion Show by showing clips of working out and dieting to prepare for the big day. A study published in 2013 analyzed the responses viewers were tweeting during the showing. Viewers discussed food, weight, eating disorders, and self-harm. The results of this study showed that vulnerable viewers could experience negative affect, or even engage in harmful behaviors, during or after viewing the show or others like it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-09-01|title=Suffering by comparison: Twitter users' reactions to the Victoria&amp;#x27;s Secret Fashion Show|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1740144513000594|journal=Body Image|language=en|volume=10|issue=4|pages=648–652|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2013.05.001|issn=1740-1445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
In 28 [[primetime]] [[Situation comedy|situational comedies]] analyzed by researchers in 2002, 33% of the central female characters were below average weight.  As the thinness of a female character increased, the number of compliments she received from men did as well. Research has shown below average weight female characters are over represented, while above average weight female characters are underrepresented in situational comedies as compared to the norms of the US population. Primetime television shows that appeal to a primarily  [[female]] audience, such as [[Friends (TV series)|Friends]] or [[Ally McBeal]] are helmed by young, attractive, and thin women.  Extremely skinny or [[Emaciation|emaciated]] women are shown on [[fashion industry]] related shows, like [[House of Style]].&lt;ref name="Hegemonic Depictions"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henriks|first=Alexandra|title=Examining the effects of hegemonic depictions of female bodies on television: a call for theory and programmatic research|journal=Critical Studies in Media Communication|date=9 November 2010|volume=19|issue=1|pages=106–123|doi=10.1080/07393180216550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Male characters often negatively comment on average and above average weight females' body shapes and weights and audiences usually react by laughing.  Male characters are not immune to unfair representation.  33% of male characters were below average weight and 13% were above average weight.  By comparison, approximately 30% of men in the US are overweight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Fouts, Gregory  |author2=Vaughan, Kimberely |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Television Situation Comedies: Male Weight, Negative References, and Audience Reactions|journal=Sex Roles|date=June 2002|volume=46|issue=11/12|pages=439–442|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/vux1891n61umjl2g/|accessdate=9 March 2012|doi=10.1023/A:1020469715532}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2003 a study was conducted on ten top-rated American primetime fictional television programs.  33% of female television characters were underweight.&lt;ref name="Overweight and Obese"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Greenberg, Eastin, Hofschire, Lachlan, and Brownell|title=Portrayals of Overweight and Obese Individuals on Commercial Television|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=August 2003|volume=93|issue=8|url=http://www.yaleruddcenter.org/resources/upload/docs/what/bias/portrayals-of-overweight-and-obese-individuals.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2012|doi=10.2105/ajph.93.8.1342|pages=1342–1348|pmid=12893625|pmc=1447967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study was done of 10 primetime television programs on each of the 6 major [[TV network]]s ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[UPN]], [[NBC]], and [[WB Television Network|WB]]) with the largest [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen audience ratings]] during the 1999–2000 season.  Of the 1018 characters on all of the shows 14% of females and 24% of males were overweight or obese.  These numbers represent less than half the percentage of overweight or obese males and females in the general population.  Overweight female characters were less likely to be considered attractive, display physical affection, or to connect with romantic partners.  Overweight males characters were less likely to interact with friends or romantic partners and less likely to talk about dating.  Overweight males characters were often shown eating.  These statistics are representative of the fat stigmatization present in many US television programs.&lt;ref name="Portrayals of Overweight and Obese Individuals on TV"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Greenberg, Eastin, Hofschire, Lachlan, and Brownell|title=Portrayals of Overweights and Obese Individuals on Commercial Televisions|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=August 2003|volume=93|issue=8|doi=10.2105/ajph.93.8.1342|pages=1342–1348|pmid=12893625|pmc=1447967}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small number of fat female television characters that do exist are consistently depicted in relation to thinner, highly [[sexualized]] female characters.  These characters are used as props, against which thinner women are compared, judged and valued.

A study in Fiji showed that the introduction of western television had a detrimental effect on young women's perceptions and eating behaviors. Three fourths of the girls in the study reported feeling fat after prolonged exposure to western television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Becker|first1=A.E.|title=Television, disordered eating, and young women in Fiji: negotiating body image and identity during rapid social change|journal=Culture, Medicine, and Psychiatry|date=2004|volume=28 4|pages=533–59|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, analysts sampled 135 scenes featuring overweight individuals from popular television programs and movies and coded for [[Anti-fat bias|anti-fat]] humor. The majority of anti-fat humor found was verbal and directed at the individual in their presence, with no regard for their feelings.&lt;ref name="Obesity TV/Movies"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Himes and Thompson|title=Fat Stigmatization in Television Shows and Movies: A Content Analysis|journal=Obesity|year=2007|volume=15|pages=712–718|url=http://www.nature.com/oby/journal/v15/n3/full/oby2007635a.html|issue=3|doi=10.1038/oby.2007.635}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Self-deprecation|Self-deprecating]] fat comments were much less common than those about or directed at another person.  Male character were three times more likely to engaged in fat commentary than female characters.  Media programs containing fat stigmatization content often are popular and have high ratings, suggesting that the general public finds it acceptable to overlook such remarks in the context of the story.&lt;ref name="Obesity TV/Movies" /&gt;

According to Renee Hobbs, EdD, associate professor of communications at Temple University, the average teen girl gets about 180 minutes of media exposure daily and only about 10 minutes of parental interaction a day. Girls often take drastic measures in an attempt to become like the media images they view. Many end up with very low self-esteem and dangerous eating disorders.  Elissa Gittes, MD, a pediatrician in the division of adolescent medicine at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh says "We're seeing girls at younger ages starting to be dissatisfied with their bodies, proactively trying to change them, and feeling like they need to emulate something different than what their bodies can do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/helping-girls-with-body-image#1|title=Helping Girls With Body Image|last=Heubeck|first=Elizabeth|date=|website=WebMD|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video games==
In 2009 a content analysis of 150 top-selling [[video game]]s found that games rated for children depicted female characters as significantly thinner than female characters in games rated for adults. Females in video games had significantly larger heads, but smaller chest sizes, waists, and hips than the average American woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Martins, Williams, Harrison, and Ratan|title=A Content Analysis of Female Body Imagery in Video Games|journal=Sex Roles|year=2009|doi=10.1007/s11199-009-9682-9|volume=61|pages=824–836}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a study showed that after playing video games, both female and male college-aged participants had significantly lower body esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barlett|first=Christopher P.|last2=Harris|first2=Richard J.|date=2008-10-01|title=The Impact of Body Emphasizing Video Games on Body Image Concerns in Men and Women|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-008-9457-8|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=59|issue=7–8|pages=586–601|doi=10.1007/s11199-008-9457-8|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The muscular male body in mass media and video is the cause of many symptoms such as body dissatisfaction and body esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barlelt|first=Christopher|date=2008|title=Meta-Analyses of the Effects of Media Images on Men's Body-image Concerns|url=https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.2008.27.3.279|journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|volume= 27|pages= 279–310|via=Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, adolescent boys age 13-18 spend nine hours on average playing video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barlett|first=Christopher|date=May 2008|title=The Impact of Body Emphasizing Video Games on Body Image Concerns in Men and Women|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-008-9457-8|journal=Sex Roles|volume= 59| issue = 7-8|pages= 586–601|via=Springer Link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure to these unattainable avatars within video games lead to higher body dissatisfaction, and in turn lead to many other social and psychology problems. Garner reported that 41% of teenage 13–19 years old boys were found to be dissatisfied with their overall body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/199702/body-image-in-america-survey-results|title=Body Image in America: Survey Results|last=Garner|first=David|date=1 February 1997|website=Psychology Today|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A research done by Zeely Sylvia from Bridgewater State University found that: players who played game with character who had a more average body size and shape would display less  body esteem concern than players who played with unrealistic muscular body character. The research concludes that muscularity concerns play a large role in the construct of male body image, and may have a substantial influence on male body esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sylvia|first=Zeely|date=2013|title=Virtual Ideals|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1262&amp;context=undergrad_rev|journal=The Effect of Video Game Play On Male Body Image|volume= 9|pages= 165–166|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-fiction media==
In 2001, British newspaper ''The Independent'' wrote about the silhouette of American TV stars like [[Calista Flockhart]] and [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] and compared it to that of the women in Pop group [[Destiny's Child]] saying, "The lollipop silhouette long-favoured by the female stars of American sitcoms, which involves disproportionately large heads wobbling atop stick-thin bodies does not say rich and it doesn't say clever. It says take me to a clinic. The New Athleticism, however, sends out a rather different set of messages: strong, confident, independent woman."&lt;ref name=SG/&gt;

[[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[Richard Carmona]] speaks of obesity as the "terror within" and says "unless we do something about it, the magnitude of the dilemma will dwarf [[9/11|9–11]] or any other terrorist attempt." The news media has been criticized for its alarmist and overly dramatized reporting on the issue of weight and obesity.  By using key words such as "war" or "epidemic" in their reporting, the news media attracts greater attention to the issue.  News reports likely reinforce the stigma of fat bodies, linking them to disease and likening fatness to a health behavior instead of an inalterable trait.&lt;ref name="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0838.2004.00399.x-i1/pdf"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Saguy and Almeling|title=Fat in the Fire? Science, the News Media, and the ''Obesity Epidemic''|journal=Sociological Forum|date=26 October 2007|volume=23|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011 nationally syndicated columnist [[Michael Kinsley]], the founding editor of [[Slate (magazine)|Slate magazine]], wrote harshly critical remarks about [[New Jersey]] governor [[Chris Christie]] and his weight. Kinsley wrote "New Jersey Governor Chris Christie cannot be president: He is just too fat . . .why should Christie's weight be more than we can bear in a president? Why should it even be a legitimate issue if he runs? One reason is that a presidential candidate should be judged on behavior and character . . . Perhaps Christie is the one to help us get our national appetites under control. But it would help if he got his own under control first."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Michael|first=Kinsley|title=Requiem for a Governor Before He's in the Ring: Michael Kinsley|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-30/requiem-for-a-governor-before-he-s-in-the-ring-michael-kinsley.html|publisher=Bloomberg News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children's media==
A content analysis done of children's videos and books found that 72% of videos and 7.5% of books placed emphasis on physical attractiveness.  In 60% of videos, a character's love for another depends on physical appearance and attractiveness. Examples include [[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]], where the prince invites maidens to the ball to select a bride and [[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]], where the Beast falls in love with Belle purely based upon her physical appearance.  In 72% of videos and 10% of books characters with thin bodies have desirable traits.  In 84% of videos and 10% of books female physical attractiveness is associated with kindness, sociability, and happiness.  While 60% of videos portray female thinness, only 32% show male muscularity.  No physical attraction is shown between a slender character and an obese character, with the exception of Beauty and the Beast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook-Cottone|first=Catherine|date=28 Mar 2018|title=Eating Disorders|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10640266.2018.1451684|journal=The journal of treatment and prevention|volume= 26|pages= 105–106|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in 2010 involved one hundred and twenty one girls age 3-6 to determine the effects of brief exposure to appearance‐related media on young girls' body image. The exposure ended up not affecting body dissatisfaction. Although nearly all the girls did like how they looked ⅓ would change one physical thing and half were worried of becoming fat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Sharon|last2=Tantleff-Dunn|first2=Stacey|date=2010-06-01|title=Am I too fat to be a princess?

In 64% of children's videos and 20% of books obesity is related to negative traits.  Obese characters are often shown as evil, unfriendly, cruel, and unattractive. Ursula from [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]] is an obese, unattractive octopus.  In 40% of videos and 20% of books at least one obese character is disliked by others.  Obese characters are shown thinking about food or depicted in setting related to food in 52% of videos and 20% of books.  Children's media is perpetuating the "what is beautiful is good" stereotype through its portrayals of thin and obese characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Herbozo, Tantleff-Dunn, Gokee-Larose, and Thompson|title=Beauty and Thinness Messages in Children's Media: A Content Analysis|journal=Eating Disorders: The Journal of Treatment &amp; Prevention|year=2004|volume=12|issue=1|pages=21–34|doi=10.1080/10640260490267742|pmid=16864302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social Media==
Social media consists of websites like Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, Pinterest and Facebook enable users to produce and share content. Thinspiration images that promote the idealization of thinness and pro-eating disorder websites are becoming increasingly more prevalent throughout social media. Pro-eating disorder (i.e. pro-ana and pro-bulimia) websites are forms of social media where  individuals can share advice and images that encourage their peers to engage in eating disorder behaviors. These websites have been shown to have deleterious effects because they communicate to the viewer that the thin ideal is something that is not only attainable but also necessary. Women are more likely to compare themselves online when they feel the need to improve their appearance. Women with low self-esteem are more likely to feel dissatisfied after comparing themselves to images on social and women who struggle with preexisting eating disorders may exacerbate them through social media fueled body comparison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perloff|first1=Richard M.|title=Social Media Effects on Young Women's Body Image Concerns: Theoretical Perspectives and an Agenda for Research|journal=Sex Roles|date=29 May 2014|volume=71|issue=11-12|pages=363–377|doi=10.1007/s11199-014-0384-6|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study on college women in the US concluded that women who spent a significant amount of time on Facebook had increased body dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eckler|first1=Petya|last2=Kalyango|first2=Yusuf|last3=Paasch|first3=Ellen|title=Facebook use and negative body image among U.S. college women|journal=Women &amp; Health|date=2 March 2016|volume=57|issue=2|pages=249–267|doi=10.1080/03630242.2016.1159268|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lasting effects on viewers==
"A study of 6,928 girls ages 9 to 14 years old found that the desire to emulate the appearance of females on television, in movies, and in magazines was predictive of beginning purging behavior at least on a monthly basis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrie|first1=Z.|last2=Sullivan|first2=E.A.|last3=Davies|first3=P.S.W.|last4=Hill|first4=R.J.|title=Media Influence on the Body Image of Children and Adolescents, Eating Disorders|journal=Eating Disorders: The Journal of Treatment &amp; Prevention|date=2006|volume=14|issue=5|pages=355–364|doi=10.1080/10640260600952506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 92% of women feel pressure to conform to the standards of beauty which the media perpetuates.  After viewing images of women with "ideal" body weights, 95% of women overestimate their body size and 40% overestimate the size of their waist, hips, cheeks, or thighs.  Those with [[eating disorder]]s, such as [[anorexia nervosa]] or [[bulimia nervosa]], show a significant increase in overestimation of body size after viewing such images.  Similarly males who are exposed to body-related advertisements show an increase in body dissatisfaction and depression.&lt;ref name="Hegemonic Depictions" /&gt;  Men shown advertisements containing images of exceptionally muscular men were shown to be dissatisfied with their own musculature, not their body fat, after viewing such advertisements.  This finding is consistent with previous evidence that states muscularity is more important than body fat in men's body satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Muscle Dysmorphia"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Leit, Gray, and Pope|title=The Media's Representation of the Ideal Male Body: A Cause for Muscle Dysmorphia?|journal=International Journal of Eating Disorders|year=2002|volume=31|issue=3|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eat.10019/pdf|doi=10.1002/eat.10019|pages=334–338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The correlation between media image and body image has been proven; in one study, among European American and African American girls ages 7 – 12, greater overall television exposure predicted both a thinner ideal adult body shape and a higher level of disordered eating one year later. Adolescent girls are the most strongly affected demographic; "More and more 12-year-old girls are going on diets because they believe what you weigh determines your worth," Cutler observed. "When all you see is a body type that only two percent of the population has, it's difficult to remember what's real and what's reasonable to expect of yourself and everyone else." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hamilton.edu/news/story/the-medias-effect-on-womens-body-image&lt;/ref&gt;

Put simply, the beauty ideal in American culture is: thin. "Large populations of 'average' girls do not demonstrate clinically diagnosable eating disorders—pathologies that the culture marks as extreme and unhealthy—but rather an entirely normative obsession with body shape and size," Cutler said. "This ongoing concern is accepted as a completely normal and even inevitable part of being a modern girl. I think we need to change that."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hamilton.edu/news/story/the-medias-effect-on-womens-body-image|title=The Media's Effect on Women's Body Image|last=Ossola|first=Alexandra|date=1 September 2010|website=Hamilton|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young adults and teens are very vulnerable to addict of social media usage because they do not know different life, world, and functioning without it. "Teens and young adults are considered particularly at risk. They're a generation raised on the internet, social media, and digital technology so these things are integral, indispensable parts of their lives. Young people also are impressionable, eager for acceptance, and relatively inexperienced, which can cloud judgment." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Good, Bad, and In-between of Social Media|url=https://carrierclinic.org/resources/good-bad-in-between-of-social-media/|website=carrierclinic.org|publisher=carrierclinic.org|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Statistics And Interesting Facts:'''

1.) More than 40% of consumers say that information found via social media affects the way they deal with their health.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://getreferralmd.com/2013/09/healthcare-social-media-statistics/|title=24 Outstanding Statistics &amp; Figures on How Social Media has Impacted the Health Care Industry|last=Honigman|first=Brian|date=2018|website=ReferralMD|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2.) 90% of respondents from 18 to 24 years of age said they would trust medical information shared by others on their social media networks.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

3.) 18 to 24 year olds are more than 2x as likely than 45 to 54 year olds to use social media for health-related discussions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

4.) 19% of smartphone owners have at least one health app on their phone. Exercise, diet, and weight apps are the most popular types.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

5.)  41% of people said social media would affect their choice of a specific doctor, hospital, or medical facility.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Several studies have shown that race and ethnicity can affect the way women perceive body image.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lovejoy|first=Meg|date=2001|title=Disturbances in the Social Body: Differences in Body Image and Eating Problems among African American and White Women|url=http://electra.lmu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edsjsr&amp;AN=edsjsr.3081846&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|journal=Gender and Society|volume=15 |issue=2|pages=239–261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hesse-Biber, et al.|first=Sharlene|date=Nov 2017|title=Racial Identity and Body Image Among Black Female College Students Attending Predominately White Colleges.|url=http://electra.lmu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edb&amp;AN=55457070&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|journal=Sex Roles|volume=63| issue = 9-10|pages=697–711|via=Complementary Index}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poran|first=Maya, A.|date=2006|title=The politics of protection: body image, social pressures, and the misrepresentation of young Black women|url=http://electra.lmu.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edsggo&amp;AN=edsgcl.157839568&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|journal=Sex Roles|volume=55|pages=739–755|via=General OneFile}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women of color often have different perceptions of body image than white women—a difference that may be linked to cultural differences such as family and community experiences and racial or ethnic pride, and other differences such as childhood influences (e.g., school environment).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ultimately, these differences may have lasting effects on the ways in which white and non-white women are affected by media depictions and cultural ideals of body image and beauty.

Lovejoy finds in her research—which compares the perceptions of body image and eating disorders in black and white women through a literature review—that the strategies (e.g., resistance to mainstream beauty ideals) that black women use to challenge mainstream depictions of female bodies and develop positive self-valuations are often strengthened through support from other black women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These same types of supportive communities were not replicated in the same way for white women in the literature. Lovejoy argues that this difference in support can influence the way black and white women are affected by damaging ideals of body image and beauty. Namely, black women may be less susceptible to these damaging ideals than white women as a result of strong support within their communities.

However, such research does not suggest that black women are not affected by damaging ideals of body image and beauty. Maya A. Poran finds that "[c]ontrary to popular theories that propose that Black women are protected by a 'Black Culture' that buffers them from negative effects of body representations—thereby leaving them with higher body esteem," black women in her study did experience "(1) pressures to be thin, (2) pressures from the preferences of men of diverse ethnicities, (3) competition with other Black women in the realms of beauty, and (4) a strong sense of being misrepresented by media images of thin Black women." &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Therefore, while it is important to recognize the contribution of supportive communities on the positive self-valuation that some black women may experience, it is important that this not obscure the damaging impact that harmful ideals of body image and beauty may have on black women.

'''Negative pledge''' is a provision in a [[contract]] which prohibits a party to the contract from creating any [[security interest]]s over certain property specified in the provision.

Negative pledges often appear in security documents, where they operate to prohibit the person who is granting the security interest from creating any other security interests over the same property, which might compete with (or rank ''[[pari passu]]'' with) the security of the first [[secured creditor]] under the security document in which the negative pledge appears.

In Australia, negative pledge lending took off after a substantial deal by [[Hanson Australia|Pioneer Concrete]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[[Trevor Sykes]], ''The Bold Riders'', second edition, 1996, {{ISBN|1-86448-184-6}}, pages 7-10&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a new way of lending, which allowed the banks to lend to corporations, something previously the domain of life insurers.

Negative pledge clauses are almost universal in modern unsecured commercial loan documents. The purpose is to ensure that a borrower, having taken out an [[unsecured loan]], cannot subsequently take out another loan with a different lender, securing the subsequent loan on the specified assets. If the borrower could do this, the original lender would be disadvantaged because the subsequent lender would have first call on the assets in an [[event of default]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7159">[[File:LimSup.svg|right|thumb|300px|Oscillation of a sequence (shown in blue) is the difference between the limit superior and limit inferior of the sequence.]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''oscillation''' of a function or a sequence is a number that quantifies how much a sequence or function varies between its extreme values as it approaches infinity or a point. As is the case with [[limit (mathematics)|limit]]s there are several definitions that put the intuitive concept into a form suitable for a mathematical treatment: oscillation of a [[sequence]] of [[real number]]s, oscillation of a real valued [[function (mathematics)|function]] at a point, and oscillation of a function on an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] (or [[open set]]).

==Definitions==

===Oscillation of a sequence===
Let &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of real numbers. The oscillation &lt;math&gt;\omega(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; of that sequence is defined as the difference (possibly infinite) between the [[limit superior and limit inferior]] of &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega(a_n) = \limsup_{n\to\infty} a_n - \liminf_{n\to\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt;.

The oscillation is zero if and only if the sequence converges. It is undefined if &lt;math&gt;\limsup_{n\to\infty}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\liminf_{n\to\infty}&lt;/math&gt; are both equal to +∞ or both equal to −∞, that is, if the sequence tends to +∞ or −∞.

===Oscillation of a function on an open set===
Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be a real-valued function of a real variable.  The oscillation of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on an interval &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; in its domain is the difference between the [[supremum]] and [[infimum]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_f(I) = \sup_{x\in I} f(x) - \inf_{x\in I} f(x).&lt;/math&gt;
More generally, if &lt;math&gt;f:X\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a function on a [[topological space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (such as a [[metric space]]), then the oscillation of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on an [[open set]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_f(U) = \sup_{x\in U} f(x) - \inf_{x\in U}f(x).&lt;/math&gt;

===Oscillation of a function at a point===
The oscillation of a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; of a real variable at a point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the limit as &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\to 0&lt;/math&gt; of the oscillation of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_f(x_0) = \lim_{\epsilon\to 0} \omega_f(x_0-\epsilon,x_0+\epsilon).&lt;/math&gt;
This is the same as the difference between the limit superior and limit inferior of the function at &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, ''provided'' the point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is not excluded from the limits.

More generally, if &lt;math&gt;f:X\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a real-valued function on a [[metric space]], then the oscillation is
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_f(x_0) = \lim_{\epsilon\to 0} \omega_f(B_\epsilon(x_0)).&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
[[File:The function sin(1 over x).svg|thumb|sin (1/''x'') (the [[topologist's sine curve]]) has oscillation 2 at ''x'' = 0, and 0 elsewhere.]]
*1/''x'' has oscillation ∞ at ''x'' = 0, and oscillation 0 at other finite ''x'' and at −∞ and +∞.
*sin (1/''x'') (the [[topologist's sine curve]]) has oscillation 2 at ''x'' = 0, and 0 elsewhere.
*sin ''x'' has oscillation 0 at every finite ''x'', and 2 at −∞ and +∞.
*The sequence 1, &amp;minus;1, 1, &amp;minus;1, 1, &amp;minus;1, ... has oscillation 2.

In the last example the sequence is [[Frequency|periodic]], and any sequence that is periodic without being constant will have non-zero oscillation. However, non-zero oscillation does not usually indicate periodicity.

Geometrically, the graph of an oscillating function on the real numbers follows some  path in the ''xy''-plane, without settling into ever-smaller regions. In [[well-behaved]] cases the path might look like a loop coming back on itself, that is, periodic behaviour; in the worst cases quite irregular movement covering a whole region.

== Continuity ==
Oscillation can be used to define [[continuous function|continuity of a function]], and is easily equivalent to the usual ''ε''-''δ'' definition (in the case of functions defined everywhere on the real line): a function ƒ is continuous at a point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if the oscillation is zero;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://ramanujan.math.trinity.edu/wtrench/texts/TRENCH_REAL_ANALYSIS.PDF Introduction to Real Analysis],'' updated April 2010, William F. Trench, Theorem 3.5.2, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; in symbols, &lt;math&gt;\omega_f(x_0) = 0.&lt;/math&gt; A benefit of this definition is that it ''quantifies'' discontinuity: the oscillation gives how ''much'' the function is discontinuous at a point.

For example, in the [[classification of discontinuities]]:
* in a removable discontinuity, the distance that the value of the function is off by is the oscillation;
* in a jump discontinuity, the size of the jump is the oscillation (assuming that the value ''at'' the point lies between these limits from the two sides);
* in an essential discontinuity, oscillation measures the failure of a limit to exist.

This definition is useful in [[descriptive set theory]] to study the set of discontinuities and continuous points – the continuous points are the intersection of the sets where the oscillation is less than ''ε'' (hence a [[G-delta set|G&lt;sub&gt;δ&lt;/sub&gt; set]]) – and gives a very quick proof of one direction of the [[Lebesgue integrability condition]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://ramanujan.math.trinity.edu/wtrench/texts/TRENCH_REAL_ANALYSIS.PDF Introduction to Real Analysis],'' updated April 2010, William F. Trench, 3.5 "A More Advanced Look at the Existence of the Proper Riemann Integral", pp. 171–177&lt;/ref&gt;

The oscillation is equivalence to the ''ε''-''δ'' definition by a simple re-arrangement, and by using a limit ([[lim sup]], [[lim inf]]) to define oscillation: if (at a given point) for a given ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; there is no ''δ'' that satisfies the ''ε''-''δ'' definition, then the oscillation is at least ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and conversely if for every ''ε'' there is a desired ''δ,'' the oscillation is 0. The oscillation definition can be naturally generalized to maps from a topological space to a metric space.

==Generalizations==
More generally, if ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is a function from a [[topological space]] ''X'' into a [[metric space]] ''Y'', then the '''oscillation of ''f''''' is defined at each ''x'' ∈ ''X'' by

:&lt;math&gt;\omega(x) = \inf\left\{\mathrm{diam}(f(U))\mid U\mathrm{\ is\ a\  neighborhood\ of\ }x\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Pirate Parties International''' ('''PPI''') is a not-for-profit international non-governmental organisation with its headquarters in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name="www.presseurop.eu"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/news-brief-cover/234921-pirate-international-born |title = The Pirate International is born |publisher = [[Presseurop]] |date = 2010-04-20 |accessdate = 2010-05-17 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110102054618/http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/news-brief-cover/234921-pirate-international-born |archive-date = 2011-01-02 |dead-url = yes |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Formed in 2010, it serves as a worldwide organisation  for [[Pirate Party|Pirate Parties]], currently representing members from 42 countries. The Pirate Parties are political incarnations of the freedom of expression movement, trying to achieve their goals by the means of the established political system rather than through activism. In 2017 PPI had been granted special [[consultative status]] to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/press/en/2017/ecosoc6843.doc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==

The PPI statutes&lt;ref name=PPIStat&gt;{{cite web | title = Pirate Parties International Statutes |url = http://int.piratenpartei.de/wiki/images/a/a6/Statutes_of_the_Pirate_Parties_International.pdf | format = PDF |accessdate=2010-10-07 |date=2010-04-18 | publisher = Pirate Parties International}}&lt;/ref&gt; give its purposes as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;to help establish, to support and promote, and to maintain communication and co-operation between pirate parties around the world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The PPI advocate on the international level for the promotion of the goals its Members share such as protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the digital age, consumer and authors rights oriented reform of copyright and related rights, support of information privacy, transparency and free access to information.

The name "Pirates" itself is a reappropriation of the title that was given to internet users by the representatives of the music and film industry, and does not refer to any illegal activity.

== History ==
The first Pirate party was the Swedish [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Piratpartiet]], founded on 1 January 2006.
Other parties and groups were formed in [[Pirate Party of Austria|Austria]], [[Pirate Party of Canada|Canada]], [[Pirate Party (Denmark)|Denmark]], [[Pirate Party (Finland)|Finland]], [[Pirate Party Germany|Germany]], Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain.  In 2007, representatives of these parties met in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] to form an alliance and plan for the [[European Parliament election, 2009|2009 European Parliament elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://torrentfreak.com/pirates-gather-at-first-international-pirate-party-conference/ |title=Pirates Gather at First International Pirate Party Conference |author=Ben Jones |publisher=TorrentFreak |date=2007-06-09 |accessdate=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further conferences were held in 2008 in [[Berlin]] and [[Uppsala]], the latter leading to the "Uppsala Declaration" of a basic platform for the elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.piratpartiet.se/nyheter/european_pirate_platform_2009 |title=The Uppsala Declaration or European Pirate Parties Declaration of a basic platform for the European Parliamentary Election of 2009 |publisher=Piratpartiet |date=2008-07-02 |accessdate=2010-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908223042/http://www.piratpartiet.se/nyheter/european_pirate_platform_2009 |archivedate=2010-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, [[Andrew Norton (Pirate Party)|Andrew Norton]] (United States) was appointed as coordinator of the PPI collective. In August 2009 he stepped down&lt;ref name="Norton"&gt;{{cite mailing list |url=http://lists.pirateweb.net/pipermail/pp.international.general/2009-August/003775.html |title=Signing off |date=2009-08-02 |accessdate=2009-09-07 |mailinglist=pp.int.general |last=Norton |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Norton (Pirate Party)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and passed the function of coordinator over to the "coreteam" led by [[Patrick Mächler]] and [[Samir Allioui]].&lt;ref name="pp-international.net"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pp-international.net/node/467 | title = Patrick Mächler steps down - Jerry Weyer Steps up!| accessdate = 2010-05-12 | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the original Pirate Party won 7.1% of the vote&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8089102.stm 
| title = Swedish pirates capture EU seat | date = 2008-06-08| accessdate = 2011-09-26

in Sweden's [[European Parliament]] elections and won two of Sweden's twenty [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] seats, inspired by a surge in membership following the trial and conviction of three members of the ideologically aligned [[The Pirate Bay|Pirate Bay]] a year earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 18 April 2010, the Pirate Parties International was formally founded in Brussels at the PPI Conference from April 16 to 18.&lt;ref name="www.presseurop.eu"/&gt;

=== The Uppsala Declaration ===
At the 2009 conference of Pirate Parties International in [[Uppsala]] (Sweden), European Pirate parties agreed on a common declaration of the parties' goals for the upcoming [[European Parliament election, 2009|election of the European Parliament]].&lt;ref name='ppse_uppsala'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.piratpartiet.se/nyheter/european_pirate_platform_2009 | title = European Pirate Platform 2009 | accessdate = 2012-04-05 | publisher = [[Pirate Party (Sweden)]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100908223042/http://www.piratpartiet.se/nyheter/european_pirate_platform_2009 | archivedate = 2010-09-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='ppde_wiki_uppsala'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/Uppsala-Deklaration | title = Uppsala-Deklaration | accessdate = 2012-04-05 | date = 2010-07-29 | work = Piratenwiki | publisher = [[Pirate Party Germany]] | language = German, English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Central issues of the declaration are:

* reform of [[copyright]], exemption of non-commercial activity from copyright regulation, reduction of the duration of copyright protections; banning of [[Digital rights management|DRM]] technologies, opposition to media or hardware levies;
* reform of [[patent law]], particularly stating that patents on life (including patents on seeds and on genes) and [[software patent debate|software]] should not be allowed;
* strengthening civil rights, transparent government, speedy and fair trial, [[freedom of speech]] and expansion of the right to anonymity in communication.

=== The Prague Declaration ===
At 2012 conference of Pirate Parties International in [[Prague]] (Czech Republic), European Pirate parties agreed to run in the elections to the European Parliament in the year 2014 with a common program as well as establish a [[European political party]]. The declaration&lt;ref name="prague"&gt;[http://ppeu.net/?p=339 The Prague Declaration]&lt;/ref&gt; has been followed by conferences in [[Potsdam]] and [[Barcelona]] to work on the structure of the legal body to come and the statutes for it.

=== Resignations ===
In February 2015, [[Pirate Party Australia]] resigned from PPI due to serious disagreement with the direction and management of the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://lists.pirateweb.net/pipermail/pp.international.general/2015-February/015834.html | accessdate=2015-02-11 | date=2015-02-11 | title = Pirate Party Australia resigns from PPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, [[Pirate Party UK]] also resigned&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/editor/ppuk-leaves-ppi | accessdate=2015-02-25 | date=2015-02-25 | title =  PPUK leaves PPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March the [[Pirate Party (Belgium)|Belgian Pirate Party]] suspended its membership within PPI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://piratetimes.net/ppbe-suspends-their-ppi-membership/ | accessdate=2015-03-08 | date = 2015-03-04 | title = PPBE suspends their PPI membership}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April 2015, the [[Pirate Party of Iceland]] voted overwhelmingly to leave PPI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://piratetimes.net/icelandic-pirates-ppis-vote-to-leave-ppi-and-birgitta-only-politician-to-increase-in-trust/ | accessdate=2015-04-20 | date = 2015-04-20 | title = Icelandic Pirates: PPIS Vote to Leave PPI and Birgitta only Politician to increase in Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; A member of the executive, Arnaldur Sigurðarson, reported a 96.56% vote in favour of leaving, adding: “PPI has been pretty much useless when it comes to its objectives which should be to encourage international cooperation between Pirate Parties.”

In May 2015, the [[Pirate Party of Sweden]] resolved with a significant majority to leave PPI, cancelling their observer status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://mote.piratpartiet.se/showthread.php?t=40246 | accessdate=2015-05-10 | date = 2015-05-10 | title = Motion P01: Proposition ang. att lämna observatörsmedlemskapet i PPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, the [[Pirate Party of Canada]] officially withdrew from Pirate Parties International citing ongoing troubles with the organization as well as a failure to adequately provide any accomplishments over its history.

== Structure ==
The PPI is governed by a board, formerly led by two co-chairs,&lt;ref&gt;Pirate Parties International Statutes, Article XIII.&lt;/ref&gt; and since Warsaw conference of 2015 by a chair and a vice-chair. Policy, governance, and applications for membership are the responsibility of the PPI General Assembly which must convene at least once per year.&lt;ref&gt;Pirate Parties International Statutes, Articles IX - XI.&lt;/ref&gt; By the current rules, board members are elected for a two-year term, half of the board being elected every year.

{{Rights |By claimant}}

'''Plant rights''' are [[rights]] to which [[plant]]s may be entitled. Such issues are often raised in connection with discussions about [[human rights]], [[animal rights]], [[Biocentrism (ethics)|biocentrism]], or [[sentiocentrism]].

==Philosophy==
[[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Erewhon]]'' contains a chapter, "The Views of an Erewhonian Philosopher Concerning the Rights of Vegetables".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-ButErew-ButErew-c27.html|chapter=The Views of an Erewhonian Philosopher Concerning the Rights of Vegetables|title=Erewhon|author=Butler, Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the question of whether animal rights can be extended to plants, animal rights philosopher [[Tom Regan]] argues that animals acquire rights due to being aware, what he calls "subjects-of-a-life". He argues that this does not apply to plants, and that even if plants did have rights, abstaining from eating meat would still be moral due to the use of plants to rear animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Regan|first=Tom|title=Animal rights, human wrongs: an introduction to moral philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AmBksH1k2RMC&amp;pg=PA101|year=2003|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=0-7425-3354-9|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to philosopher [[Michael Marder]], the idea that plants should have rights derives from "plant subjectivity", which is distinct from human personhood.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/01/2013120141156284755.html&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Paul Taylor (philosopher)|Paul Taylor]] holds that all life has [[inherent worth]] and argues for respect for plants, but does not assign them rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vesilind|first1=P. Aarne|last2=Gunn|first2=Alastair S.|title=Engineering, ethics, and the environment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aFaNf3XdJjIC&amp;pg=PA94|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-58918-5|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher D. Stone, the son of [[investigative journalism|investigative journalist]] [[I.&amp;nbsp;F.&amp;nbsp;Stone]], proposed in a 1972 paper titled "Should Trees Have Standing?" that if corporations are assigned rights, so should natural objects such as trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stone|first=Christopher D.|title=Should Trees Have Standing? Law, Morality, and the Environment|edition=Third|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-973607-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stone|first=Christopher D.|year=1972|title=Should Trees Have Standing--Toward Legal Rights for Natural Objects|journal=Southern California Law Review|volume=45|pages=450–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- If you feel that this paragraph should be deleted, please explain why on the article talk page. --&gt;Whilst not appealing directly to "rights", Matthew Hall has argued that plants should be included within the realm of human moral consideration. His "Plants as Persons: A Philosophical Botany" discusses the moral background of plants in western philosophy and contrasts this with other traditions, including indigenous cultures, which recognise plants as persons—active, intelligent beings that are appropriate recipients of respect and care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Matthew|title=Plants as Persons: A Philosophical Botany|year=2011|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=1-4384-3428-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hall backs up his call for the ethical consideration of plants with arguments based on [[plant neurobiology]], which says that plants are autonomous, perceptive organisms capable of complex, adaptive behaviours, including the recognition of self/non-self.

==Scientific arguments==
In the study of [[plant physiology]], plants are understood to have mechanisms by which they recognize environmental changes. This definition of [[Plant perception (physiology)|plant perception]] differs from the notion that plants are capable of feeling emotions, an idea also called [[plant perception (paranormal)|plant perception]]. The latter concept, along with [[plant intelligence]], can be traced to 1848, when [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]], a German [[experimental psychologist]], suggested that plants are capable of [[emotion]]s, and that one could promote healthy growth with talk, attention, and affection.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Heidelberger ''Nature from within: Gustav Theodor Fechner and his psychophysical worldview'' 2004, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Swiss Federal Ethics Committee on Non-Human Biotechnology analyzed scientific data on plants, and concluded in 2009 that plants are entitled to a certain amount of "dignity", but "dignity of plants is not an absolute value."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The dignity of plants|journal=Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior|first=Florianne|last=Koechlin|date=January 2009|volume=4|issue=1|pages=78–79|doi=10.4161/psb.4.1.7315|pmid=19568336|pmc=2634081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The single-issue Party for Plants entered candidates in the 2010 parliamentary election in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/idINTRE62S2HA20100329|title=Plant rights party to contest next Dutch election|date=March 29, 2010|accessdate=August 7, 2010|publisher=Reuters|first=Ben|last=Berkowitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; It focuses on topics such as climate, biodiversity and sustainability in general. Such concerns have been criticized as evidence that modern culture is "causing us to lose the ability to think critically and distinguish serious from frivolous ethical concerns".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Silent Scream of the Asparagus|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/015/065njdoe.asp|author=Smith, Wesley J.|date=May 12, 2008|volume=13|issue=33|publisher=Weekly Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Legal arguments==
[[File:Justice William O Douglas.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Justice [[William O. Douglas]], author of a noted dissent about the legal standing of plants]]
In his dissent to the 1972 ''[[Sierra Club v. Morton]]'' decision by the [[United States Supreme Court]], Justice [[William O. Douglas]] wrote about whether plants might have [[standing (law)|legal standing]]:
{{quote|Inanimate objects are sometimes parties in litigation. A ship has a legal personality, a fiction found useful for maritime purposes... So it should be as respects valleys, alpine meadows, rivers, lakes, estuaries, beaches, ridges, groves of trees, swampland, or even air that feels the destructive pressures of modern technology and modern life...The voice of the inanimate object, therefore, should not be stilled.}}

The [[Swiss Constitution]] contains a provision requiring "account to be taken of the dignity of creation when handling animals, plants and other organisms", and the [[Swiss government]] has conducted ethical studies pertaining to how the dignity of plants is to be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The dignity of plants|pmc=2634081|author=Florianne Koechlin|publisher=Plant Signal Behav.|date=January 2009|volume=4|issue=1|pages=78–79|pmid=19568336|doi=10.4161/psb.4.1.7315}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2012, a river in New Zealand, including the plants and other organisms contained within its boundaries, was legally declared a person with standing (via guardians) to bring legal actions to protect its interests.&lt;ref&gt;Vines T, Bruce A Faunce TA. 'Planetary Medicine and the Waitangi Tribunal Whanganui River Report.' Journal of Law and Medicine 2013; 20: 528 available at: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2235935 (accessed 28 March 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular arguments==
When challenged by [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] to become [[vegetarian]], [[Timothy McVeigh]] argued that "plants are alive too, they react to stimuli (including pain); have circulation systems, etc".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.furcommission.com/news/newsF02x.htm|title=McVeigh to PeTA: "Where Do You Draw the Line?"|publisher=Fur Commission|date=May 7, 2001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922060922/http://furcommission.com/news/newsF02x.htm|archivedate=September 22, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/71380695.html?dids=71380695:71380695&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+17%2C+2001&amp;author=Lloyd+Grove+Washington+Post+Staff+Writer&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=The+Reliable+Source&amp;pqatl=google|title=The Reliable Source|publisher=Washington Post|first=Lloyd|last=Grove|authorlink=Lloyd Grove|page=C3|date=April 17, 2001|accessdate=August 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Animal Liberation Front]] argues that there is no evidence that plants can experience pain, and that to the extent they respond to stimuli, it is like a device such as a [[thermostat]] responding to sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.animalliberationfront.com/Philosophy/Morality/Biology/InsectAR.htm#faq42|chapter=Isn't it hypocritical to kill and eat plants?|title=FAQs Insects, Plants|publisher=Animal Liberation Front}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facts == 
The defendant, Susan Savage, threw a beer over another woman, Tracey Beal, who was a former girlfriend of Mrs Savage's husband, in a pub on the evening of 31 March 1989. Mrs Savage had in her hand a full pint of beer before she threw the content over Miss Beal; in doing so the glass slipped from Savage's hand and cut Beal's wrist. The defendant claimed that she had only intended to throw the contents of the beer. It was never her intention or her realization that there was risk of injury in her action. The jury by their verdict concluded that Mrs Savage had deliberately thrown not only the beer but the glass at Miss Beal or while throwing the beer, the glass had slipped off her grip and had struck injured Miss Beal. In any of this instance, the jury concluded there was Mrs Savage had no intention that the glass would injure Miss Beal. Mrs Savage was convicted under s20 of [[Offences against the Person Act 1861|Offences against the Person Act 1861 (OAPA 1861)]] 1861.

== Judgment ==
The [[Court of Appeal]] quashed the conviction of s20 by substituting it with a conviction under s47 OAPA 1861 [[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm]]. Mrs Savage appealed this decision to the [[House of Lords]] which dismissed her appeal.

The '''red grouse''', ''Lagopus lagopus scotica'', is a medium-sized bird of the [[grouse]] family which is found in [[Calluna|heather]] [[moorland]] in [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]]. It is usually classified as a subspecies of the [[willow ptarmigan]] but is sometimes considered to be a separate species, ''Lagopus scotica''. It is also known as the '''moorcock''', '''moorfowl''' or '''moorbird'''. ''Lagopus'' is derived from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc-Latn|lagos}} ({{lang|grc|λαγος}}), meaning "[[hare]]", + {{lang|grc-Latn|pous}} ({{lang|grc|πους}}), "foot", in reference to the feathered feet and toes typical of this cold-adapted genus, and ''scoticus'' is "of Scotland".&lt;ref name= job90&gt;{{cite book | last= Jobling | first= James A | year= 2010| title= The Helm Dictionary of Scientific Bird Names | publisher = Christopher Helm | location = London | isbn = 978-1-4081-2501-4 |pages =217, 351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The red grouse is widely known as the logo of [[The Famous Grouse]] [[whisky]] and an animated bird is a character in a series of its adverts. The red grouse is also the emblem of the journal ''[[British Birds (magazine)|British Birds]]''.

[[File:Lagopede d'Ecosse MHNT.jpg|thumb|Red grouse eggs]]

==Description==
The red grouse is differentiated from the [[willow ptarmigan]] and [[rock ptarmigan]] by its plumage being reddish brown, and not having a white winter plumage. The tail is black and the legs are white. There are white stripes on the underwing and red combs over the eye. Females are less reddish than the males and have less conspicuous combs. Young birds are duller and lack the red combs.

Birds in Ireland are sometimes thought to belong to a separate subspecies ''L. l. hibernica''. They are slightly paler than those in Britain and the females have yellower plumage with more finely barred underparts. This may be an adaptation to [[camouflage]] them in moorland with higher grass and sedge content and less heather.

It is identified by its {{'}}''chut!chut!chut!chut!chut!chuttt....''{{'}} call, or the {{'}}''Goback, goback, goback''{{'}} vocalisation. The wings make a whirring sound when the bird is disturbed from a resting place.

Grouse populations display periodic cycling, where the population builds up to very high densities only to crash a few years later, and then recover. The main driver of this cyclic pattern is thought to be the parasitic [[nematode]] worm ''[[Trichostrongylus tenuis]]''.

However, in his book,&lt;ref&gt;Wynne Edwards, V. C. ''Evolution through Group Selection'' 1986 Blackwell Scientific Publications Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; [[V. C. Wynne-Edwards]] suggests that the primary reason for mortality in grouse population is [[homeostasis]] depending largely on food availability and that the 'Grouse disease', due to the parasitic worm ''Trichostrongylus tenuis'' is a mistaken diagnosis of the after effects of social exclusion.

==Distribution and habitat==
The red grouse is [[endemism in birds|endemic]] to the [[British Isles]]; it has developed in isolation from other subspecies of the willow ptarmigan which are widespread in northern parts of [[Eurasia]] and North America.

It is found across most parts of [[Scotland]], including [[Orkney]], [[Shetland]] and most of the [[Outer Hebrides]]. They are only absent from urban areas, such as in the [[Central Belt]].

In Wales there are strong populations in places but their range has retracted. They are now largely absent from the far south, their main strongholds being [[Snowdonia]], the [[Brecon Beacons]] and the [[Cambrian Mountains]]. There are reports of Welsh birds crossing the [[Bristol Channel]] to [[Exmoor]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In [[England]] it is mainly found in the north – places such as the [[Lake District]], [[Northumberland]], [[County Durham]], much of [[Yorkshire]], the [[Pennines]] and the [[Peak District]], as far south as the [[Staffordshire Moorlands]]. There is an isolated introduced population on [[Dartmoor]], and overspill Welsh birds visit the [[Shropshire Hills]] such as [[Long Mynd]], where they breed. The Exmoor population would now appear to be extinct, with the last birds sighted as recently as 2005. An introduced population in [[Suffolk]] died out by the early 20th century, though a population on [[Cannock Chase]] in [[Staffordshire]] lasted longer.

In Ireland it is found locally in most parts of the country: it is commonest in [[County Mayo|Mayo]], where the population is increasing,&lt;ref&gt;''Irish Birds'' Vol. 8 (2005-6) p.258&lt;/ref&gt; and on the [[County Antrim|Antrim]] plateau, with other healthy populations in the [[Slieve Bloom]] mountains and the [[Knockmealdown]] mountains;&lt;ref&gt;''Irish Birds'' Vol.9 (2009) p.74&lt;/ref&gt; a few pairs still breed in south [[County Dublin]].

The small population in the [[Isle of Man]] is mostly concentrated in the southern hills but conservation work is ongoing throughout the uplands to ensure the species' continued viability.

Its typical habitat is upland heather moors away from trees. It can also be found in some low-lying bogs and birds may visit farmland during hard weather.

The British population is estimated at about 250,000 pairs with around 1–5,000 pairs in Ireland. Numbers have declined in recent years and birds are now absent in areas where they were once common. Reasons for the decline include loss of heather due to [[overgrazing]], creation of new [[conifer]] [[plantation]]s and a decline in the number of upland gamekeepers. Some predators such as the [[hen harrier]] feed on grouse and there is ongoing controversy as to what effect these have on grouse numbers.

Red grouse have been introduced to the [[Hautes Fagnes]] region of [[Belgium]] but the population there died out in the early 1970s.

==Behaviour==

===Diet===
The red grouse is herbivorous and feeds mainly on the shoots, seeds and flowers of heather. It will also feed on berries, [[cereal]] crops and sometimes insects.

===Breeding===
The birds begin to form pairs during the autumn and males become increasingly territorial as winter progresses. The nest is a shallow scrape up to 20&amp;nbsp;cm across which is lined with vegetation. About six to nine eggs are laid, mainly during April and May. They are oval, glossy and pale yellow with dark brown blotches. The eggs are incubated for 19 to 25 days, the chicks can fly after 12 to 13 days after hatching and are fully grown after 30 to 35 days.

==Conservation==
[[Member States of the European Union]] are obliged by virtue of Council Directive 2009/147/EC&lt;ref&gt;Codified version, replacing Council Directive 79/409/EC&lt;/ref&gt; on the conservation of wild birds (popularly called the Birds Directive) to take the requisite measures for the protection of the red grouse; but as it is a species to which Annex II of the Directive applies, Article 7 permits hunting under national law, provided population levels are not threatened as a result. In 2002 Ireland was found by the [[European Court of Justice]] to be in breach of its obligations under the earlier Directive to protect the red grouse, in that it had allowed a crucial breeding ground to become degraded through overgrazing by sheep.&lt;ref&gt;Case C-117/00 ''Commission v Ireland'' Judgement of 13 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation measures taken on foot of the judgment have seen the population in the area double from 400 to 800.

==As a game bird==
{{see also|Driven grouse shooting}}
[[Image:Heather burning.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Controlled burning of heather, on a Derbyshire grouse moor]]
The red grouse is considered a game bird and is shot in large numbers during the shooting season which traditionally starts on August 12, known as the [[Glorious Twelfth]]. There is a keen competition among some London restaurants to serve freshly killed grouse on August 12, with the birds being flown from the moors and cooked within hours.

[[File:Grouse grit.jpg|thumb|left|Grouse grit]]
Shooting can take the form of 'walked up' (where shooters walk across the moor to flush grouse and take a shot) or '[[Driven grouse shooting|driven]]' (where grouse are driven, often in large numbers, by 'beaters' towards the guns who are hiding behind a line of 'butts'). Many moors are managed to increase the density of grouse. Areas of heather are subjected to controlled burning; this allows fresh young shoots to regenerate, which are favoured by the grouse. Extensive predator control, including illegal killing of raptors,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snh.org.uk/pdfs/publications/commissioned_reports/982.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is a feature of grouse moor management: foxes, stoats and crows are usually heavily controlled on grouse moors. The extent to which it occurs on grouse moors is hotly contested between conservation groups and shooting interests, and the subject generates a lot of media attention in relation to grouse moors and shooting.

In recent decades the practice of using medicated grit and direct dosing of birds against an endoparasite, the strongyle worm or threadworm (''[[Trichostrongylus tenuis]]''), has become part of the management regime on many moors.

== As food ==
The flavour of grouse, like most game birds, develops if the bird is hung for a few days after shooting and before eating. [[Roast]]ing is the most common way to cook a grouse.

''[[The Cookery Book of Lady Clark of Tillypronie]]'' (1909) has 11 recipes for using grouse. The recipe "To cook old birds" runs as follows:&lt;ref name=Tillypronie&gt;{{cite book | title=The Cookery Book of Lady Clark of Tillypronie | publisher=Constable and Co. | year=1909| author=Frere, Catherine Frances (arranged and edited by)|pages=142–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Old grouse are not fit for cooking till the feathers pull very loosely from the "apron". When "high", put a piece of bread inside them while roasting; take out the bread before dishing, and throw it away. A good gravy should be served with them in a boat, none in the dish, but put the birds on a toast when bread is plentiful.|Lady Clark of Tillypronie&lt;ref name=Tillypronie/&gt;}}

==Scientific study==
Because of their economic and social importance and some interesting aspects of their biology, red grouse have been widely studied. They were the subject of some of the earliest studies of population biology in birds, as detailed in '' The Grouse in Health and in Disease'' by [[Simon Fraser, 14th Lord Lovat|Lord Lovat]] in 1911. Since the mid-20th century they have been subject to ongoing study by many organisations and individuals. Much work has been conducted by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology in the eastern [[Cairngorms]], and by the [[Game &amp; Wildlife Conservation Trust]] in the Central Highlands. There are a wide range of research activities still going on today and a wealth of published literature exists on all aspects of grouse biology.

==Parasites and viruses==

The red grouse may be infected by parasites and viruses which severely affect populations. [[Strongylosis]] or 'grouse disease' is caused by the [[strongyle worm]], which induces damage and internal bleeding after burrowing into the [[cecum]]. This [[endoparasite]] is often eaten with the tops of young [[Calluna|heather]] shoots and can lead to mortality and poor condition, including a decrease in the bird's ability to control the scent it emits.

[[Louping ill virus]] is a [[flavivirus]] (RNA virus), also known as sheep encephalomyelitis virus. Flaviviruses are transmitted by arthropods, and louping ill virus is transmitted by ticks. In red grouse, this virus can cause mortality as high as 78%.&lt;ref name="Gilbert2004" /&gt; The main tick vector is the sheep tick ''[[Ixodes ricinus]]''. Although traditionally tick-borne diseases are thought to be caused when the parasite bites its host, it has been shown that red grouse chicks can be affected when they eat ticks with which they come into contact.&lt;ref name="Gilbert2004"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gilbert | first1 = L. | last2 = Jones | first2 = L. D. | last3 = Laurenson | first3 = M. K. | last4 = Gould | first4 = E. A. | last5 = Reid | first5 = H. W. | last6 = Hudson | first6 = P.

'''Satellite delay''' is the noticeable [[latency (engineering)|latency]] which occurs due to the [[speed of light]], when sending data to and from satellites, especially the much further out [[geosynchronous satellite]]s.  Bouncing a signal off one geosynchronous satellite takes about a quarter of a second, which is enough to be noticeable, but relaying data between 2 or 3 such satellites increases the delay further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Elbert |first1=Bruce R. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9k5s2-mMKgC&amp;dq |title=The Satellite Communication Applications Handbook |publisher=Artech House |year=2004 |isbn=978-1580538084 |accessdate=2014-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Secret Santa''' is a [[Western culture|Western]] [[Christmas]] tradition in which members of a group or community are randomly assigned a person to whom they give a [[gift]].  The identity of the gift giver is a secret not to be revealed until after the gift is opened. 

Deriving from the [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition, the ritual is known as ''Secret Santa'' in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]]; as ''Kris Kringel'' or ''Kris Kindle'' (''Christkindl'') in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]; as ''Wichteln, Secret Santa'', ''Kris Kringle'', ''Chris Kindle'' (''Christkindl'') or Engerl-Bengerl in parts of [[Austria]]; as ''Secret Santa'' or ''Kris Kringle'' in [[Canada]] and [[Australia]]; as ''Secret Santa'', ''Kris Kringle'', or ''Monito-monita'' in the [[Philippines]]; as ''Angelito'' in the [[Dominican Republic]]; and as "Wichteln" in Germany. "Wichteln" is what a "Wichtel", a wight, does, a good deed. In [[Poland]], the tradition is celebrated on the day of 6 December (Mikołajki),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obliczakultury.pl/publicystyka/obyczaje-swiata/1506-mikolajki-6-grudnia|title=Oblicza Kultury - Mikołajki - 6 grudnia - Obyczaje świata|author=Magda Goetz|work=Oblicza Kultury}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mowimyjak.pl/styl-zycia/uroczystosci/kim-jest-sw-mikoaj-skad-sie-wzia-zwyczaj-kupowania-prezentow-na-6-grudnia,87_34412.html|title=Mikołajki.

Exceptions are the UK (where the traditional gift-bringer is [[Father Christmas]]) and the Philippines (which has the [[Three Kings]]). [[Spain]], [[Portugal]] and most places in [[Latin America]] use ''amigo secreto'' (secret friend) or ''amigo invisible/invisível'' (invisible friend). In [[Israel]], this game is called ''גמד וענק'' (A Dwarf and a Giant) and is mostly played during [[Purim]].

The term ''Pollyanna''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sassysanta.com/pollyanna/|title=Pollyanna Gift Exchange|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used in [[Southeastern Pennsylvania]] and [[South Jersey]].

==Variations==

=== Thieving Secret Santa/Stealing Secret Santa/White Elephant/Yankee Swap ===

{{main|White elephant gift exchange}}
In this version, participants (players) bring one gift each which is potentially suitable or interesting to any of the other participants. The gifts should be wrapped in such a way as to disguise their nature. Ideally, the provider of each gift should not be disclosed when setting up the game. Players take turns, and can either open a new gift, or steal a previously opened gift. This game is more commonly known as the [[white elephant gift exchange]], or Yankee Swap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071223/NEWS/712230338 |title=Yankee Swappers play gift game |publisher=CapeCodOnline.com |date=23 December 2007 |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify credibility|date=December 2013}}

===Guessing===

Each participant brings a gift for their assigned person, with a letter. This letter may or may not have hints on who the giver might be, depending on the rules participants have established. Each receiver must guess who made the gift.

===Secret Casino Santa===
In this version, each person buys a gift for specific amount, not for anyone specifically. Each person also puts in a specific amount of money into a pot. Who goes first in gift selection can be determined by random selection. The options are:

*Option A: Choose a gift
*Option B: Do not choose a gift, and go for Money.
*Option C: Put your name in to win all the unwanted gifts by those who went for Option B.

At the end, the gifts that were chosen are opened and the winner of the money and leftover gifts are drawn.

===Conspiracy Santa===
In this version, participants engage in a "conspiracy" where all participants work together to select a gift for a single participant without that participant's direct involvement or knowledge. Many such individual "conspiracies" run concurrently, one for each participant. Email threads or web apps are commonly used to manage each "conspiracy" until a consensus is made, wherein the gift is purchased by a decided upon participant and given at a later date. A common theme of Conspiracy Santa is collectively learning about participants, making it popular for workplaces and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2472555,00.asp |title=Sick of Secret Santa? Try Conspiracy Santa |publisher=PCMag.com |date=21 November 2014 |accessdate=2014-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secret Santa Online ===
The tradition of Secret Santa is becoming increasingly popular in online communities. 

On the one hand there are several ''Secret Santa Generators'' that tell every participant in a group for whom to buy a gift. This is especially useful for groups who can't meet in person to draw the names from a hat or bowl before the Secret Santa event. Popular ''Secret Santa Generators'' are:
* [https://www.drawnames.com/ DrawNames]: a simple email based Secret Santa Generator (supports multiple languages)
* [https://www.elfster.com/ elfster]: a combination of a Secret Santa Generator and an online shop to buy the Secret Santa gift (products on the US shop of Amazon.com). This also lets people RSVP to the invitations that are sent out to their name
* [https://www.pikkado.com/ Pikkado]: a free and very complete tool to successfully organize a Secret Santa gift exchange. (supports multiple languages: EN, ES, FR, PT)
*[https://wichtelmania.com/en/ Wichtelmania]: a Secret Santa Generator without email registration (based on secret links that can be sent to the participants using WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, ... or email)
* [https://www.easysanta.com Easy Santa]: a Secret Santa Generator available on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[IOS]] where users register through the mobile phone and the draws are made and consulted also through the mobile phone. It supports 25 languages and works in most countries.
* [https://www.my-secret-santa.org My Secret Santa]: a full mobile Secret Santa Generator (no installation) to manage from 3 to thousands of participants and providing functionalities like: 1 to 5 draws per participant, custom design, anonymous messages exchanges between participants, vocal message to santa / whishlist sharing, gif ideas.
* [https://www.partylabz.com/secretsanta PartyLabz]: a Secret Santa Generator within online RSVP website. You can create an event and add a Secret Santa tab there. To be able to play, participants need to [[RSVP (invitations)|RSVP]] to the event. Then the host initiates Secret Santa game (the service randomly draws names and sends emails). The participants can anonymously send message or notify the host about sending or receiving a gift.
* [https://secret-santa.team Secret-Santa.team]: a Secret Santa application to start a Secret Santa with your team. Connect your application (Slack and Discord supported at the moment), select the participants and validates. The service will randomly draw users and send them a private message in their application to inform them of their peer name. Totally free, without ads, and no privacy data storage nor usage.
On the other hand there are communities like [https://www.redditgifts.com/ redditgifts] where you don't know the person for whom you buy a gift or from whom you receive a gift.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14247">'''Self-complexity''' is a person’s perceived knowledge of herself or himself, based upon the number of distinct cognitive structures, or self-aspects, they believe themselves to possess. These self-aspects can include context-dependent social roles, relationships, activities, superordinate traits, and goals of the individual,&lt;ref name="Linville85"&gt;Linville, P.W. (1985). Self-complexity and affective extremity: Don’t put all your eggs in one cognitive basket. Social Cognition, 3, 94-120.&lt;/ref&gt; which combine to form the larger, associative network of their [[self-concept]].&lt;ref name="Linville87"&gt;Linville, P.W. (1987). Self-complexity as a cognitive buffer against stress-related illness and depression. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 52(4), 663-676.&lt;/ref&gt; According to self-complexity theory, an individual who has a number of self-aspects that are unique in their attributes will have greater self-complexity than one who has only a few self-aspects, or whose self-aspects are closely associated to one another.&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt; In other words, self-complexity may invoke the question, “How full is the self-concept”?&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Brown, J.D. (1998). The self. New York, NY: Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The self-complexity model==
The term self-complexity was first coined by psychologist Patricia Linville (1985, 1987), who also developed a model for the concept. Linville’s model for self-complexity suggests that self-aspects are “activated” in the context of a relevant experience,&lt;ref name="Linville85" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt; and it is these experiences that impact how particular self-aspects are viewed. If an individual experiences a favourable event towards which they feel positively, self-aspects that have been activated by the experience will be associated with positive feelings. In contrast, self-aspects will be associated with negative thoughts and feelings when they are activated by unfavourable experiences. In addition, the more similar self-aspects are to one another, the more likely it will be for the thoughts and feelings associated with one self-aspect to “spillover”, influencing the thoughts and feelings linked to other, overlapping self-aspects.&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt; Consequently, the self-complexity model suggests that highly self-complex individuals who possess the greatest number of distinct self-aspects will be less vulnerable to swings in affect and self-appraisal in response to life events, relative to individuals who possess limited and/or indistinct self-aspects (i.e., low self-complexity).&lt;ref name="Linville85" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt; This is due to the fact that highly self-complex individuals are suspected of being better able to [[Compartmentalization (psychology)|compartmentalize]] their life events,&lt;ref name="Ryan"&gt;Ryan, R.M., LaGuardia, J.G., &amp; Rawsthorne, L.J. (2005). Self-complexity and the authenticity of self-aspects: Effects on well being and resilience to stressful events. North American Journal of Psychology,7(3), 431-448.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Showers"&gt;Showers, C. (1992). Compartmentalization of positive and negative self-knowledge: Keeping bad apples out of the bunch. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 62(6), 1036-1049.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as having a smaller proportion of their self-aspects affected by any salient emotional event, whether positive or negative.&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt; In essence, after receiving any form of self-relevant feedback individuals high in self-complexity will have less of their self-concept represented, and as a result will exhibit less extreme affective responses.&lt;ref name="Linville85" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryan" /&gt;

==Approaches==

===Developmental perspective===
A variety of different views are held concerning the nature of self-complexity. From a developmental perspective, self-complexity is viewed as one of the primary features of development, and it is thought to increase with age.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans, D.W. (1994). Self-complexity and its relation to development, symptomatology and self-perception during adolescence. Child Psychiatry and Human Development, 24(3), 173-182.&lt;/ref&gt; Young children are believed to possess relatively few and undifferentiated self-aspects (i.e., low self-complexity), resulting in a simplified self-concept. As children grow in terms of their physical, social, and cognitive selves, they should attain the cognitive capacity necessary to identify a greater number of distinct self-aspects (i.e., increasing self-complexity) and thus reflect a more developed, multi-faceted self-concept.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt; The developmentalist perspective would therefore expect older children to have not only a greater number of self-aspects in comparison to younger children, but also to have less interrelation between their self-aspects. The perspective also stresses the need to examine other indices of development, including identity status, cognitive developmental level, and ego development,&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt; as factors that have the potential to provide an enhanced understanding of self-complexity development.

===Clinical and personality perspectives===
Contrary to the developmental viewpoint, clinical and personality perspectives focus predominantly upon the potential protective factors of self-complexity that carry into adulthood.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt; Specifically, the perspective suggests that highly self-complex individuals are at less risk for [[major depressive disorder|depression]]&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt; and psychopathologies,&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt;  such as [[borderline personality disorder]],&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;Parker, A.G., Boldero, J.M., &amp; Bell, R.C. (2006). Borderline personality disorder features: The role of self-discrepancies and self-complexity. Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, and Practice, 79(3), 309-321.&lt;/ref&gt; because they can compensate for their negatively affected self-aspects by focusing on their unaffected self-aspects, thus preserving their global self-worth.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt; In comparisons of clinical and normal adolescent populations, the self-concept domains of psychiatric inpatients are often found to be significantly more interrelated, suggesting low self-complexity.&lt;ref name="EvansII"&gt;Evans, D.W., Noam, G.G., Wertleib, D., Paget, K.F., &amp; Wolf, M. (1994). Self-perception and adolescent psychopathology: A clinical-developmental perspective. [[American Journal of Orthopsychiatry]], 64(2), 293-300.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, clinical and personality perspectives not only consider low self-complexity as a factor in psychopathology, they also infer that individuals with psychopathologies may be delayed in the normal development of self-complexity.&lt;ref name="EvansII" /&gt;

==Implications for high vs. low self-complexity==
In accordance with clinical and personality perspectives, variations in self-complexity are suggested to be factors that either contribute to, or protect against damages to individuals’ physical and mental well-being.&lt;ref name="Linville85" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt; In particular, individual differences in self-complexity are predictive of emotional stability and reactivity to [[stress (biology)|stress]],&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rafaeli-Mor"&gt;Rafaeli-Mor, E., Gotlib, I.H., &amp; Revelle, W. (1998). The meaning and measurement of self-complexity. Personality and Individual Differences, 27(2), 341-356.&lt;/ref&gt; which can moderate depression, physical illnesses, and [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref name="McConnell"&gt;McConnell, A.R., Strain, L.M., Brown, C.M.,&amp; Rydell, R.J. (2009). The simple life: On the benefits of low self-complexity. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 35(7), 823-835.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits of high self-complexity===
According to Linville, individuals who possess high self-complexity may use their unaffected self-aspects as cognitive buffers,&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt; protecting against negative affects/self-appraisals and the health consequences associated with these stressors. For example, a woman who considers herself a successful lawyer, mother, wife and friend may experience less negative affects and self-appraisals, following a divorce, compared to a woman whose self-aspects were limited to her being a successful lawyer and wife, because the former retains a number of diverse self-aspects on which she can rely.&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt; Furthermore, if another woman’s self-aspect as a wife was closely associated with her self-aspect as a lawyer (if, for example, her husband was also a lawyer) her affectivity could be even more severely impacted due to the spillover process,&lt;ref name="Linville85" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt; leading to heightened feelings of inadequacy and stress. In this vein, high self-complexity could be considered a buffer against threats to a particular domain of self-aspects, while low self-complexity could be viewed as a [[wikt:diathesis|diathesis]] for stress-related disorders and depression; the majority of an individual’s self-aspects would be negatively affected by stressful life events.&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt;

===Benefits of low self-complexity===
As an alternative to the conclusions above, other members in the field of psychology consider low self-complexity to benefit individuals’ well-being in select scenarios.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McConnell" /&gt; Despite the fact that  highly self-complex individuals are capable of limiting their affective reactivity to negative events,&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt; this same emotional restraint is observed in reaction to positive events.&lt;ref name="McConnell"/&gt; Therefore, in comparison to highly self-complex individuals, individuals who are low in self-complexity, but who generally experience positive life events are likely to experience increased positive affect, enhancing well-being and self-esteem and deterring the effects of depression and physical illness that are typically stress-induced.&lt;ref name="McConnell" /&gt; This effect is especially likely if low self-complexity individuals believe they possess an extensive social support network and desirable personality characteristics.&lt;ref name="McConnell" /&gt;
Moreover, although high self-complexity allows numerous, differentiated self-aspects to diffuse the damage incurred by one or more self-aspects in undesirable experiences, the possession of multiple, unrelated self-aspects can be viewed as a fragmentation of one’s self-concept.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rafaeli-MorII"&gt;Rafaeli-Mor, E., &amp; Steinberg, J. (2002). Self-complexity and well-being: A review and research synthesis. Personality and Social Psychology Review, 6(1), 31-58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Donahue"&gt;Donahue, E.M., Robins, R.W., Roberts, B.W., &amp; John, O.P. (1993). The divided self: Concurrent and longitudinal effects of psychological adjustment and social roles on self-concept differentiation. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 64(5), 834-846.&lt;/ref&gt; From this stance, highly self-complex individuals may suffer the strain of [[role conflict]], identity uncertainty, and/or identity competition&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt; (e.g., determined businesswoman vs. nurturing mother), all of which have been known to enhance depression, [[neuroticism]], and low self-esteem&lt;ref name="Donahue" /&gt; and can ultimately lead to chronic, low-level stress as a result of everyday hassle.&lt;ref name="Ryan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Showers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rafaeli-MorII" /&gt; In light of these arguments, it is suggested that high self-complexity is beneficial only to the extent that one’s various self-aspects remain distinct, yet integrated with one another.&lt;ref name="Woolfolk"&gt;Woolfolk, R.L., Novalany, J.G., Allen, M.A., &amp; Polino, M. (1995). Self-complexity, self-evaluation, and depression: An examination of form and content within the self-schema. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 68, 1108-1120.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future of the self-complexity model==
Linville’s model for self-complexity has been widespread in the research community since the time of its inception in 1985. Given the influence and popularity of her model for explaining personality complexity and its relation to well-being, numerous criticisms and alternative suggestions have been made to improve upon the model’s consistency, reliability, and validity.&lt;ref name="Rafaeli-Mor" /&gt;

===Criticisms===
In terms of criticisms, research has found that the buffering effect of high self-complexity, as proposed by Linville,&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt; receives mixed support at best.&lt;ref name="Ryan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rafaeli-MorII" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solomon"&gt;Solomon, A., &amp; Haaga, David A.F. (2003). Reconsideration of self-complexity as a buffer against depression. Cognitive Therapy and Research 27(5), 579-591.&lt;/ref&gt; Other criticisms have focused upon Linville’s choice to operationally define self-complexity as a combination of the number and differentiation of self-aspects; many believe that variations in well-being could be better accounted for if the two factors were considered separately, rather than as one entity in self-complexity theory.&lt;ref name="Rafaeli-Mor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solomon" /&gt;

===Suggested alternatives===									
Recent alternatives suggest that it is not the complexity of an individual, that is, the number and distinctiveness of their self-aspects, which moderates well-being, but rather the authenticity of one’s self-aspects.&lt;ref name="Ryan" /&gt; This emphasizes the potential prominence of [[self-determination theory]] (SDT), which focuses upon the authentication of behaviours, values, and self-presentations as an integral feature to personal well-being.&lt;ref name="Ryan" /&gt; The concept of possible self-complexity has also been addressed to consider how this factor could mediate reactions to feedback regarding future, rather than present goals of an individual.&lt;ref name="Niedenthal"&gt;Niedenthal, P. M., Setterlund, M. B., &amp; Wherry, M. B. (1992). Possible self-complexity and affective reactions to goal-relevant evaluation. Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology, 63(1), 5-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''single responsibility principle''' is a computer programming principle that states that every [[Modular programming|module]] or [[Class (computer programming)|class]] should have responsibility over a single part of the [[Software feature|functionality]] provided by the [[software]], and that responsibility should be entirely [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|encapsulated]] by the class. All its [[Service (systems architecture)|services]] should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility. [[Robert C. Martin]] expresses the principle as, "A class should have only one reason to change,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Robert C.|authorlink = Robert Cecil Martin|title=Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2003|isbn=978-0135974445|page=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0HYhAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; although, because of confusion around the word "reason" he more recently stated "This principle is about people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Single Responsibility Principle |publisher=ArticleS.UncleBob |year=2014 |url=https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2014/05/08/SingleReponsibilityPrinciple.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term was introduced by [[Robert Cecil Martin|Robert C. Martin]] in an article by the same name as part of his ''Principles of Object Oriented Design'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Principles of OOD |publisher=ArticleS.UncleBob |year=2005 |url=http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod}}&lt;/ref&gt; made popular by his book ''Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|2003|pp=95-98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin described it as being based on the principle of [[Cohesion (computer science)|cohesion]], as described by [[Tom DeMarco]] in his book ''Structured Analysis and System Specification'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = DeMarco |first = Tom. |authorlink = Tom DeMarco |title = Structured Analysis and System Specification |publisher = [[Prentice Hall]] |year = 1979 |isbn = 0-13-854380-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Meilir Page-Jones in ''The Practical Guide to Structured Systems Design''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Page-Jones|first = Meilir |authorlink = Meilir Page-Jones |title = The Practical Guide to Structured Systems Design |publisher = [[Yourdon Press Computing Series]] |year = 1988 |isbn = 978-8120314825|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 [[Robert Cecil Martin|Robert C. Martin]] wrote a blog post entitled [https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2014/05/08/SingleReponsibilityPrinciple.html The Single Responsibility Principle] with a goal to clarify what was meant by the phrase "reason for change."

==Example==
Martin defines a responsibility as a ''reason to change'', and concludes that a class or module should have one, and only one, reason to be changed (i.e. rewritten). As an example, consider a module that compiles and prints a report. Imagine such a module can be changed for two reasons. First, the content of the report could change. Second, the format of the report could change. These two things change for very different causes; one substantive, and one cosmetic. The single responsibility principle says that these two aspects of the problem are really two separate responsibilities, and should therefore be in separate classes or modules. It would be a bad design to couple two things that change for different reasons at different times.

The reason it is important to keep a class focused on a single concern is that it makes the class more robust. Continuing with the foregoing example, if there is a change to the report compilation process, there is greater danger that the printing code will break if it is part of the same class.

A '''soap shaker''' is a box entirely made from wire metal [[mesh]] with a handle. The box may be opened so as to be able to place in this box a piece or pieces of [[bar soap]]. These may be pieces that have become too small to be used as hand soap.

The box may now be securely closed. Held by its handle the box may be vigorously shaken in a water filled [[bucket]] or other container. The shaking will move the water through the box. The result is that the water will become soapy, rich with [[Foam|suds]] to be used for all kinds of cleaning purposes. This way even small pieces of bar soap could be re-used and are not wasted.

The use of a soap shaker was common early to mid 20th century. The invention and sale of powdered or liquid soap diminished its use.

{{Sociology}}
{{Psychology sidebar}}

From a [[Sociology|sociological]] perspective, '''social norms''' are informal understandings that govern the behavior of members of a society.&lt;ref name="marshall"&gt;Marshall, G. ''Oxford Dictionary of Sociology''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social psychology]] recognizes smaller group units, such as a team or an office, may also endorse norms separately or in addition to cultural or societal expectations.&lt;ref name="jackson"&gt;Jackson, J. (1965). "Structural characteristics of norms". In I.D. Steiner &amp; M. Fishbein (Eds.), ''Current studies in social psychology'' (pp. 301-309).&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, norms are regarded as collective representations of acceptable group conduct as well as individual perceptions of particular group conduct.&lt;ref name="lapinski &amp; rimal"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lapinski | first1 = M. K. | last2 = Rimal | first2 = R. N. | year = 2005 | title = An explication of social norms | url = | journal = Communication Theory | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 127–147 | doi=10.1093/ct/15.2.127}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be viewed as cultural products (including values, customs, and traditions)&lt;ref name="shetif"&gt;Sherif, M. (1936). ''The psychology of social norms''. NewYork: Harper.&lt;/ref&gt; which represent individuals' basic knowledge of what others do and think that they should do.&lt;ref name="cialdini"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cialdini | first1 = R. D. | year = 2003 | title = Crafting normative messages to protect the environment | url = http://www.psychologicalscience.org/pdf/cialdini.pdf| journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 12 | issue = 4| pages = 105–109 | doi=10.1111/1467-8721.01242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, in the field of social psychology, the roles of norms are emphasized which can guide behavior in a certain situation or environment as "mental representations of appropriate behavior".&lt;ref name="aarts &amp; dijksterhuis/"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aarts | first1 = H. | last2 = Dijksterhuis | first2 = A. | year = 2003 | title = The silence of the library: Environment, situational norm, and social behavior | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 84 | issue = 1| pages = 18–28 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.84.1.18| pmid = 12518968 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it has been shown that normative messages can promote pro-social behavior, including decreasing alcohol use&lt;ref name="collins, carey, &amp; sliwinski"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Collins | first1 = S. E. | last2 = Carey | first2 = K. B. | last3 = Sliwinski | first3 = M. J. | year = 2002 | title = Mailed personalized normative feedback as a brief intervention for at-risk college drinkers | url = | journal = Journal of the Studies of Alcohol | volume = 63 | issue = 5| pages = 559–567 | doi=10.15288/jsa.2002.63.559}}&lt;/ref&gt; and increasing voter turnout.&lt;ref name="gerber &amp; rogers"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gerber | first1 = A. S. | last2 = Rogers | first2 = T. | year = 2009 | title = Descriptive social norms and motivation to vote: everybody's voting and so should you | url = | journal = The Journal of Politics | volume = 71 | issue = 1| pages = 178–191 | doi=10.1017/s0022381608090117| citeseerx = 10.1.1.691.37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the psychological definition of social norms' behavioral component, norms have two dimensions: how much a behaviour is exhibited, and how much the group approves of that behavior.&lt;ref name="jackson" /&gt; Both of these dimensions can be used in normative messages to alter norms and subsequently alter behaviors; for example, a message can target the former dimension by describing high levels of voter turnout in order to encourage more turnout. At the same time, norms also can be changed contingent on the observed behavior of others (how much behavior is exhibited).

== Behavior  ==
Norms running counter to the behaviors of the overarching society or culture may be transmitted and maintained within small subgroups of society. For example, Crandall (1988) noted that certain groups (e.g., [[cheerleading]] squads, dance troupes, sports teams, sororities) have a rate of [[bulimia]], a publicly recognized life-threatening disease, that is much higher than society as a whole. Social norms have a way of maintaining order and organizing groups.&lt;ref name="haung"&gt;Haung, Peter, Wu, Ho-Mou. "More Order without More Law: A Theory of Social Norms and Organizational Cultures". (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social control ==
Although not considered to be formal laws within society, norms still work to promote a great deal of [[social control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Druzin|first=Bryan|title=Using Social Norms as a Substitute for Law|url=https://works.bepress.com/bryan_druzin/16/|journal=Albany Law Review|volume=78|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are statements that regulate conduct. The cultural phenomenon that is the norm is the prescriber of acceptable behavior in specific instances. Ranging in variations depending on culture, race, religion, and geographical location, it is the foundation of the terms some know acceptable as not to injure others, the golden rule, and to keep promises that have been pledged.&lt;ref&gt;Hechter, Michael et al., eds.. "Introduction". ''Social Norms''. Ed. Michael Hechter et al.. Russell Sage Foundation, 2001. xi–xx.&lt;/ref&gt; Without them, there would be a world without consensus, common ground, or restrictions. Even though the law and a state's legislation is not intended to control social norms, society and the law are inherently linked and one dictates the other. This is why it has been said that the language used in some legislation is controlling and dictating for what should or should not be accepted. For example, the criminalisation of familial sexual relations is said to protect those that are vulnerable, however even consenting adults cannot have sexual relationships with their relatives. The language surrounding these laws conveys the message that such acts are supposedly immoral and should be condemned, even though there is no actual victim in these consenting relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0964663913502068?legid=spsls%3B23%2F1%2F113&amp;patientinform-links=yes|title= The Synthetic Necessary Truth Behind New Labour's Criminalisation of Incest| doi=10.1177/0964663913502068 | volume=23|journal=Social &amp; Legal Studies|pages=113–130|year= 2013|last1= Roffee|first1= James A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social norms can be enforced formally (e.g., through sanctions) or informally (e.g., through [[body language]] and non-verbal communication cues.) Because individuals often derive physical or psychological resources from group membership, groups are said to control ''discretionary stimuli''; groups can withhold or give out more resources in response to members' adherence to group norms, effectively controlling member behavior through rewards and operant conditioning.&lt;ref name="hackman"&gt;Hackman, J.R. (1992). "Group influences on individuals in organizations". In M.D. Dunnette &amp; L.M. Hough (Eds.), ''Handbook of industrial and organizational psychology'' (Vol. 3). Palo Alto: Consulting Psychologists Press, 234-245.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social psychology]] research has found the more an individual values group-controlled resources or the more an individual sees group membership as central to his definition of self, the more likely he is to conform.&lt;ref name="hackman" /&gt; Social norms also allow an individual to assess what behaviors the group deems important to its existence or survival, since they represent a codification of belief; groups generally do not punish members or create norms over actions which they care little about.&lt;ref name="hackman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="feldman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feldman | first1 = D.C. | year = 1984| title = The development and enforcement of group norms | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 47–55 | doi=10.2307/258231| jstor = 258231 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Norms in every culture create [[conformity]] that allows for people to become [[socialization|socialized]] to the culture in which they live.&lt;ref name="marshall" /&gt; 
 
As social beings, individuals learn when and where it is appropriate to say certain things, to use certain words, to discuss certain topics or wear certain clothes, and when it is not.  Thus, knowledge about [[cultural]] norms is important for [[wikt:impression|impression]]s,&lt;ref name="kamau"&gt;Kamau, C. (2009) Strategizing impression management in corporations: cultural knowledge as capital. In D. Harorimana (Ed) Cultural implications of knowledge sharing, management and transfer: identifying competitive advantage. Chapter 4. Information Science Reference. {{ISBN|978-1-60566-790-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is an individual's regulation of their nonverbal behavior.  One also comes to know through experience what types of people he/she can and cannot discuss certain topics with or wear certain types of dress around. Typically, this knowledge is derived through experience (i.e. social norms are learned through [[social interaction]]).&lt;ref name="kamau" /&gt; Wearing a suit to a job interview in order to give a great first impression represents a common example of a social norm in the [[White-collar worker|white collar work force]].

== Sociology ==
For [[Talcott Parsons]] of the [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] school, norms dictate the interactions of people in all social encounters. On the other hand, [[Karl Marx]] believed that norms are used to promote the creation of [[role]]s in society which allows for people of different levels of [[social class]] structure to be able to function properly.&lt;ref name="marshall" /&gt; Marx claims that this power dynamic creates [[social order]].

[[Heinrich Popitz]] is convinced that the establishment of social norms, that make the future actions of alter foreseeable for ego, solves the problem of [[contingency (philosophy)|contingency]] ([[Niklas Luhmann]]). In this way, ego can count on those actions as if they would already have been performed and does not have to wait for their actual execution; social interaction is thus accelerated. Important factors in the standardization of behavior are sanctions&lt;ref&gt;See The International Handbook of Sociology, ed. by Stella R. Quah and Arnaud Sales, Sage 2000, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; and social roles.

== Emergence and transmission==
Rulemaking is one of the basic impulses humans have for organizing and simplifying actions. Everyday there are new rules put into place, as well as old rules that are more structured whether it be for a group or an individual. Yet, not only do humans make rules, they strive on finding the rules that come eye to eye about how the world works.&lt;ref&gt;Jasso, Guillermina. "RULE FINDING ABOUT RULE MAKING: COMPARISON PROCESSES AND THE MAKING OF RULES". ''Social Norms''. Ed. Michael Hechter and Karl-Dieter Opp. Russell Sage Foundation, 2001. 348–393.&lt;/ref&gt; These rules, once accepted by an individual or a group after trial and error, then become a norm.

Groups may adopt norms through a variety of ways. Norms can arise formally, where groups explicitly outline and implement behavioral expectations.  Laws or club rules serve as an example of this.&lt;ref name="kendall"&gt;Kendall, D. (2011) ''Sociology in our times''&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of these norms we follow 'naturally' such as driving on the right side of the road in the US and on the left side in the UK, or not speeding in order to avoid a ticket. Many formal norms serve to provide safety to the general public.

However, social norms are much more likely to develop informally, emerging gradually as a result of repeated use of discretionary stimuli to control behavior.&lt;ref name="hackman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chong"&gt;Chong, D. (2000) ''Rational lives: norms and values in politics and society''&lt;/ref&gt; Not necessarily laws set in writing, informal norms represent generally accepted and widely sanctioned routines that people follow in everyday life.&lt;ref name="gerber"&gt;Gerber, L. &amp; Macionis, J. (2011) ''Sociology'', 7th Canadian ed., p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; These informal norms, if broken, may not invite formal legal punishments or sanctions, but instead encourage reprimands, warnings, or [[othering]]; [[incest]], for example, is generally thought of as wrong in society, but many jurisdictions do not legally prohibit it.

===Transfer of norms between groups===
Individuals may also import norms from a previous organization to their new group, which can get adopted over time.&lt;ref name="feldman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bm"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bettenhausen | first1 = K. | last2 = Murnighan | first2 = J.K. | year = 1985 | title = The emergence of norms in competitive decision-making groups | url = | journal = Administrative Science Quarterly | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 350–372 | doi=10.2307/2392667| jstor = 2392667 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without a clear indication of how to act, people typically rely on their past history to determine the best course forward; what was successful before may serve them well again. In a group, individuals may all import different histories or [[Behavioral script|scripts]] about appropriate behaviors; common experience over time will lead the group to define as a whole its take on the right action, usually with the integration of several members' schemas.&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; Under the importation paradigm, norm formation occurs subtly and swiftly&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; whereas with formal or informal development of norms may take longer.

Groups internalize norms by accepting them as reasonable and proper standards for behaviour within the group. Once firmly established, a norm becomes a part of the group's operational structure and hence more difficult to change. While possible for newcomers to a group to change its norms, it is much more likely that the new individual will adopt the group's norms, values, and perspectives, rather than the other way around.&lt;ref name="hackman" /&gt;

== Deviance from social norms ==
[[File:Normal is a bad word.jpg|thumb|250px|"Normal is a bad word", a [[Graffiti|graffito]] in [[Ljubljana]], Slovenia]]
[[Deviance (sociology)|Deviance]] is defined as "nonconformity to a set of norms that are accepted by a significant number of people in a community or society."&lt;ref name="appelbaum"&gt;Appelbaum, R. P., Carr, D., Duneir, M., &amp; Giddens, A. (2009). "Confomity, Deviance, and Crime." Introduction to Sociology, New York, NY: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;  More simply put, if group members do not follow a norm, they become labeled as a deviant. In the sociological literature, this can often lead to them being considered outcasts of society. Yet, deviant behavior amongst children is somewhat expected. Except the idea of this deviance manifesting as a criminal action, the social tolerance given in the example of the child is quickly withdrawn against the criminal. Crime is considered one of the most extreme forms of deviancy according to scholar Clifford R. Shaw.&lt;ref&gt;Dobbert, Duane L., and Thomas X. Mackey. "Chapter 12: Clifford Shaw and Henry McKay." ''Deviance: Theories on Behaviors That Defy Social Norms''. N.p.: n.p., n.d. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; What is considered "normal" is relative to the location of the [[culture]] in which the [[social interaction]] is taking place.  In psychology, an individual who routinely disobeys group norms runs the risk of turning into the "institutionalized deviant." Similar to the sociological definition, institutionalized deviants may be judged by other group members for their failure to adhere to norms.  At first, group members may increase pressure on a non-conformist, attempting to engage the individual in conversation or explicate why he or she should follow their behavioral expectations. The role in which one decides on whether or not to behave is largely determined on how their actions will affect others.&lt;ref&gt;Drobak, John N. "1. The Role of Social Variables." ''Norms and the Law''. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2006. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Especially with new members who perhaps do not know any better, groups may use discretionary stimuli to bring an individual's behavior back into line. Over time, however, if a member continues to disobey, the group will give up on him as a lost cause; while the group may not necessarily revoke his membership, they may give him only superficial consideration.&lt;ref name="hackman" /&gt; If a worker is late to a meeting, for example, violating the office norm of punctuality, a boss or other co-worker may wait for the individual to arrive and pull him aside later to ask what happened. If the behavior continues, eventually the group may begin meetings without him since the individual "is always late."  The group generalizes the individual's disobedience and promptly dismisses it, thereby reducing the member's influence and footing in future group disagreements.

Group tolerance for deviation varies across membership; not all group members receive the same treatment for norm violations. Individuals may build up a "reserve" of good behavior through [[conformity]], which they can borrow against later.  These ''[[idiosyncrasy credit]]s'' provide a theoretical currency for understanding variations in group behavioral expectations.&lt;ref name="hollander"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hollander | first1 = E.P. | year = 1958 | title = Conformity, status, and idiosyncrasy credit | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 65 | issue = 2| pages = 117–127 | doi=10.1037/h0042501}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A teacher, for example, may more easily forgive a straight-A student for misbehaving—who has past "good credit" saved up—than a repeatedly disruptive student.  While past performance can help build idiosyncrasy credits, some group members have a higher balance to start with.&lt;ref name="hollander" /&gt; Individuals can import idiosyncrasy credits from another group; childhood movie stars, for example, who enroll in college, may experience more leeway in adopting school norms than other incoming freshmen.   Finally, [[leaders]] or individuals in other high-status positions may begin with more credits and be appear to be "above the rules" at times.&lt;ref name="hackman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hollander" /&gt; Even their idiosyncrasy credits are not bottomless, however; while held to a more lenient standard than the average member, leaders may still face group rejection if their disobedience becomes too extreme.

Deviance also causes multiple emotions one experiences when going against a norm. One of those emotions can be widely attributed to guilt. This emotion is connected to the ethics of duty which in turn becomes a primary object of moral obligation. Guilt is followed by an action that is questioned after its doing.&lt;ref&gt;Greenspan, Patricia S. "Chapter 4: Moral Residues." ''Practical Guilt: Moral Dilemmas, Emotions, and Social Norms''. N.p.: Oxford UP, 1995. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be described as something negative to the self as well as a negative state of feeling. Used in both instances, it is both an unpleasant feeling as well as a form of self-punishment. Using the metaphor of "dirty hands",&lt;ref&gt;Greenspan, Patricia S. "Chapter 6: Basing Ethics on Emotion." ''Practical Guilt: Moral Dilemmas, Emotions, and Social Norms''&lt;/ref&gt; it is the staining or tainting of oneself and therefore having to self cleanse away the filth. It is a form of reparation that confronts oneself as well as submitting to the possibility of anger and punishment from others. Guilt is a point in both action and feeling that acts as a stimulus for further "honorable" actions.

=== Operant conditioning ===
The probability of these actions that are committed are coined to [[B. F. Skinner]], that states that [[operant conditioning]] plays a role in the process of social norm. Operant conditioning is the increase that an action will occur again by increasing the reinforced response. This process is that of reward and punishment or trial and error. Hand in hand with deviance, the consequences of one’s behavior, whether positive or negative, will determine the probability of reoccurrence as well as the push towards regulating one’s decisions in the future. Containing five sub categories, this conditioning treatment is an influence in the actions one commits and the feelings one experiences afterwards. In the case of social deviance, an individual who has gone against a norm will feel the negative connotation that comes with defying the conditioning that was taught therefore indicating negative reinforcement.  A perfect example is that of a little girl painting on the wall of the house as she seeks her mother’s approval of her artistic work. When the child witnesses the mother putting her in a "time out", she realizes that if she were to paint on the wall again, it will lead to punishment therefore causing her to notice her negative reinforcement. Which then makes the probability of her painting the wall again, decrease immensely. He also states that humans are conditioned from a very young age on how to behave and how to act with those around us considering the outside influences of the society and location one is in.&lt;ref&gt;Dobbert, Duane L., and Thomas X. Mackey. "Chapter 9: B.F. Skinner." ''Deviance: Theories on Behaviors That Defy Social Norms''. N.p.: n.p., n.d. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Built to blend into the ambiance and attitude around us, deviance is a frowned upon action.

== Focus theory of normative conduct ==
[[Robert Cialdini|Cialdini]], Reno, and Kallgren developed the focus theory of normative conduct to describe how individuals implicitly juggle multiple behavioral expectations at once; expanding on conflicting prior beliefs about whether cultural, situational or personal norms motivate action, the researchers suggested the focus of an individual’s attention will dictate what behavioral expectation they follow.&lt;ref name="cialdini 1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cialdini | first1 = R.B. | last2 = Reno | first2 = R.R. | last3 = Kallgren | first3 = C.A. | year = 1990 | title = A focus theory of normative conduct: Recycling the concept of norms to reduce littering in public places | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 58 | issue = 6| pages = 1015–1026 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.58.6.1015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

===Descriptive versus injunctive===
Descriptive norms depict what happens, while injunctive norms describe what ''should'' happen. Cialdini, Reno, and Kallgren (1990) define a descriptive norm as people's perceptions of what is commonly done in specific situations; it signifies what most people do, without assigning judgment. The absence of trash on the ground in a parking lot, for example, transmits the descriptive norm that most people there do not [[litter]].&lt;ref name="cialdini 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cialdini 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cialdini | first1 = R | year = 2007 | title = Descriptive social norms as underappreciated sources of social control | url = | journal = Psychometrika | volume = 72 | issue = 2| pages = 263–268 | doi=10.1007/s11336-006-1560-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Injunctive norm, on the other hand, transmits group approval about a particular behavior; it dictates how an individual ''should'' behave.&lt;ref name="cialdini 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cialdini 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="schultz"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schultz | first1 = Nolan | last2 = Cialdini | first2 = Goldstein | last3 = Griskevicius | first3 =  | year = 2007 | title = The constructive, destructive, and reconstructive power of social norms | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 18 | issue = 5| pages = 429–434 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01917.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rivis"&gt;Rivis, Amanda, Sheeran, Paschal. "Descriptive Norms as an Additional Predictor in the Theory of Planned Behaviour: A Meta-Analysis". 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Watching another person pick up trash off the ground and throw it out, a group member may pick up on the injunctive norm that he ought to not litter.

===Prescriptive and proscriptive===
Prescriptive norms are unwritten rules that are understood and followed by society and indicate what we should do.&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = K.L. | last2 = Lizzio | first2 = A.J. | last3 = Zauner | first3 = S. | last4 = Gallois | first4 = C. | year = 2001| title = Social rules for managing attempted interpersonal domination in the workplace: Influence of status and gender | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 44 | issue = 3/4| pages = 129–154 | doi=10.1023/a:1010998802612}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Expressing gratitude or writing a Thank You card when someone gives you a gift represents a prescriptive norm in American culture. Proscriptive norms, in contrast, comprise the other end of the same spectrum; they are similarly society's unwritten rules about what one should not do.&lt;ref name="wilson" /&gt; These norms can vary between cultures; while an acceptable greeting in some European countries, kissing a stranger on the cheek constitutes a proscriptive norm in the United States.

===Subjective===
Subjective norm is determined by beliefs about the extent to which important others want them to perform a behavior. Social influences are conceptualized in terms of the pressure that people perceive from important others to perform, or not to perform, a behavior.&lt;ref name="rivis" /&gt;

== Mathematical representations ==
Over the last few decades, several theorists have attempted to explain social norms from a more theoretical point of view.  By quantifying behavioral expectations graphically or attempting to plot the logic behind adherence, theorists hoped to be able to predict whether or not individuals would conform. The return potential model and game theory provide a slightly more economic conceptualization of norms, suggesting individuals can calculate the cost or benefit behind possible behavioral outcomes. Under these theoretical frameworks, choosing to obey or violate norms becomes a more deliberate, quantifiable decision.

===Return potential model===
[[File:Return Potential Model, Jackson, 1965.jpeg|thumb|Figure 1. The return potential model (reproduced from Jackson, 1965).]]
Developed in the 1960s, the return potential model provides a method for plotting and visualizing group norms. In the regular coordinate plane, the amount of behavior exhibited is plotted on the X-axis (label ''a'' in [http://www.tau.ac.il/~toury/works/GT-Role-Norms.htm Figure 1]) while the amount of group acceptance or approval gets plotted on the Y-axis (''b'' in Figure 1).&lt;ref name="jackson"/&gt; The graph represents the potential return or positive outcome to an individual for a given behavioral norm.  Theoretically, one could plot a point for each increment of behavior how much the group likes or dislikes that action. For example, it may be the case that among first-year graduate students, strong social norms around how many daily cups of coffee you drink exist. If the return curve in Figure 1 correctly displays the example social norm, we can see that if someone drinks 0 cups of coffee a day, the group strongly disapproves. The group does not approve of member behavior until someone hits four cups of coffee a day; the graduate students (as represented by the return curve) find it excessive to drink more than seven cups, however, as the approval again dips below zero. As exhibited by the coffee example, the return potential model displays for each increment of behavior how much group approval one can anticipate.

:'''Point of maximum return.''' The point with the greatest y-coordinate is called the point of maximum return, as it represents the amount of behavior the group likes the best.&lt;ref name="jackson"/&gt; While ''c'' in Figure 1 is labeling the return curve in general, the highlighted point just above it at X=6, represents the point of maximum return. Extending our above example, the point of maximum return for first-year graduate students would be 6 cups of coffee; they receive the most social approval for drinking exactly that many cups.  Any more or any fewer cups would decrease the approval.

:'''Range of tolerable behavior.''' Label ''d'' represents the range of tolerable behavior, or the amount of action the group finds acceptable.&lt;ref name="jackson"/&gt; It encompasses all the positive area under the curve. In Figure 1, the range of tolerable behavior extends is 3, as the group approves of all behavior from 4 to 7 and 7-4=3. Carrying over our coffee example again, we can see that first-years only approve of having a limited number of cups of coffee (between 4 and 7); more than 7 cups or fewer than 4 would fall outside the range of tolerable behavior.  Norms can have a narrower or wider range of tolerable behavior. Typically, a narrower range of behavior indicates a behavior with greater consequences to the group.&lt;ref name="hackman"/&gt;

:'''Intensity.''' The intensity of the norm tells how much the group cares about the norm, or how much group affect is at stake to be won or lost.  It is represented in the return potential model by the total amount of area subsumed by the curve, regardless of whether the area is positive or negative.&lt;ref name="jackson"/&gt; A norm with low intensity would not vary far from the x-axis; the amount of approval or disapproval for given behaviors would be closer to zero. A high-intensity norm, however, would have more extreme approval ratings. In Figure 1, the intensity of the norm appears high, as few behaviors invoke a rating of indifference.

:'''Crystallization.''' Finally, norm crystallization refers to how much variance exists within the curve; translated from the theoretical back to the actual norm, it shows how much agreement exists between group members about the approval for a given amount of behavior.&lt;ref name="jackson" /&gt; It may be that some members believe the norm more central to group functioning than others. A group norm like how many cups of coffee first years should drink would probably have low crystallization, since a lot of individuals have varying beliefs about the appropriate amount of caffeine to imbibe; in contrast, the norm of not plagiarizing another student's work would likely have high crystallization, as people uniformly agree on the behavior's unacceptability. Showing the overall group norm, the return potential model in Figure 1 does not indicate the crystallization. However, a return potential model that plotted individual data points alongside the cumulative norm could demonstrate the variance and allow us to deduce crystallization.

===Game theory===
{{Main|Game theory}}
Another general formal framework that can be used to represent the essential elements of the social situation surrounding a norm is the [[repeated game]] of game theory. Rational choice, a branch of game theory, deals with the relations and actions socially committed among rational agents.&lt;ref&gt;Voss, Thomas. Game-Theoretical Perspectives on the Emergence of Social Norms. Social Norms, 2001, p.105.&lt;/ref&gt; A norm gives a person a [[rule of thumb]] for how they should behave. However, a [[rationality|rational]] person only acts according to the rule if it is optimal for them. The situation can be described as follows. A norm gives an [[Expectation (epistemic)|expectation]] of how other people act in a given situation (macro). A person acts optimally given the expectation (micro). For a norm to be [[Structural stability|stable]], people's actions must reconstitute the expectation without change (micro-macro feedback loop). A set of such correct stable expectations is known as a [[Nash equilibrium]]. Thus, a stable norm must constitute a Nash equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cristina Bicchieri|Bicchieri, Cristina]]. 2006. The Grammar of Society: The Nature and Dynamics of Social Norms, New York: Cambridge University Press, Ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In the Nash equilibrium, no one actor has any positive incentive in individually deviating from a certain action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Social norms will be implemented if the actions of that specific norm come into agreement by the support of the Nash equilibrium in the majority of the game theoretical approaches.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Voss 2001, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

From a game-theoretical point of view, there are two [[explanation]]s for the vast variety of norms that exist throughout the world. One is the difference in games. Different parts of the world may give different environmental contexts and different people may have different values, which may result in a difference in games. The other is [[equilibrium selection]] not explicable by the game itself. Equilibrium selection is closely related to [[Coordination game|coordination]]. For a simple example, driving is common throughout the world, but in some countries people drive on the right and in other countries people drive on the left (see [[coordination game]]). A framework called comparative [[institutional analysis]] is proposed to deal with the game theoretical structural understanding of the variety of social norms.

In [[Buddhism]], a '''sotāpanna''' ([[Pali]]), '''srotāpanna''' ([[Sanskrit]]; {{zh|p=rùliú|t=入流}}, [[Tibetan alphabet|Tibetan]]: རྒྱུན་ཞུགས་, [[Wylie transliteration|Wylie]]: ''rgyun zhugs''&lt;ref&gt;Meditative States in Tibetan Buddhism By Lati Rinpoche, Denma Locho Rinpoche, Leah Zahler, Jeffrey Hopkins. pg 63&lt;/ref&gt;), "stream-winner",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/glossary.html#sotapanna|title=A Glossary of Pali and Buddhist Terms|publisher=[[Access to Insight]]|accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "stream-entrant"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Snyder|first1=David|title=Definition of a Buddhist|url=http://www.thedhamma.com/definition.htm|website=The Dhamma}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a person who has seen the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] and consequently, has dropped the first three [[Fetter (Buddhism)|fetters]] (''saŋyojana'') that bind a being to rebirth, namely self-view (''sakkāya-ditthi''), clinging to rites and rituals (''sīlabbata-parāmāsa''), and skeptical indecision ([[Vicikitsa]]).

The word ''sotāpanna'' literally means "one who entered (''āpanna'') the stream (''sota'')", after a metaphor which calls the [[Noble Eightfold Path|noble eightfold path]] a stream which leads to [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nibbāna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro|title=Intro the Stream: A Study Guide on the First Stage of Awakening|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/into_the_stream.html|website=Access to Insight|quote="Very good, Sariputta! Very good! This noble eightfold path — right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration — is the stream."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entering the stream (''sotāpatti'') is the first of the [[four stages of enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sujato|first1=Bhikkhu|title=A Swift Pair of Messengers|url=http://santipada.org/aswiftpairofmessengers/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/A_Swift_Pair_of_Messengers_Bhikkhu_Sujato.html|website=Santipada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attainment==

The first moment of the attainment is termed the path of stream-entry (''sotāpatti-magga''), which cuts through the first three fetters. The person who experiences it is called a stream-winner (''sotāpanna'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/khema/allofus.html |title=All of Us|accessdate=2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Sister Ayya Khema}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/waytoend.html|title= The Noble Eightfold Path|accessdate=2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Bhikkhu Bodhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sotāpanna is said to attain an intuitive grasp of the dharma,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tan|first1=Piya|title=Sarakani Sutta 1|url=http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/3.6-Sarakani-S-1-s55.24-piya.pdf|website=The Dharmafarers|accessdate=25 June 2015|quote=Even these great sal trees,43 Mahanama, if they could understand what is well spoken and what is ill spoken, I would declare them to be streamwinners, no longer bound to the lower world, of fixed destiny, sure of awakening!}}&lt;/ref&gt; this [[Prajñā (Buddhism)|wisdom]] being called [[Noble Eightfold Path#Right view|right view]] (''sammā diṭṭhi'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro|title=Maha-cattarisaka Sutta: The Great Forty|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.117.than.html|website=Access to Insight|quote="And what is the right view that is noble, without effluents, transcendent, a factor of the path? The discernment, the faculty of discernment, the strength of discernment, analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening, the path factor of right view[1] in one developing the noble path whose mind is noble, whose mind is without effluents, who is fully possessed of the noble path. This is the right view that is noble, without effluents, transcendent, a factor of the path.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has unshakable confidence in the [[Buddha]], [[Dharma]], and [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]. The Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, sometimes taken to be the [[Three Jewels|triple refuge]], are at other times listed as being objects of recollection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tan|first1=Piya|title=(Agata,phala) Mahanama Sutta|url=http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/15.3-Agataphala-Mahanama-S-a6.10-piya.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general though, confirmed confidence in the ''Buddha''', ''Dharma'' and ''Sangha'', respectively, is considered to be one of the four limbs of stream-winning (''sotāpannassa angāni'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro|title=Nandiya Sutta: To Nandiya|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn55/sn55.040.than.html|quote=There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Awakened One...Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Dhamma...Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Sangha...|website=Access to Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nyanatiloka|first1=Maha Thera|title=Sotapannassa angani|url=http://www.dhammawiki.com/index.php?title=Sotapannassa_angani|website=Dhamma Wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sotapanna is said to have "opened the eye of the Dhamma" (''dhammacakka''), because they have realized that whatever arises will cease (impermanence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro|title=Upatissa-pasine: Upatissa's (Sariputta's) Question|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/vin/mv/mv.01.23.01-10.than.html|website=Access to Insight|accessdate=25 June 2015|quote=Then to Sariputta the wanderer, as he heard this Dhamma exposition, there arose the dustless, stainless Dhamma eye: "Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their conviction in the true dharma would be unshakable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tan|first1=Piya|title=Sarakani Sutta 1|url=http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/3.6-Sarakani-S-1-s55.24-piya.pdf|website=The Dharmafarers|accessdate=25 June 2015|quote=11 The 4 qualities of a streamwinner: (1) unshakable faith in the Buddha, (2) in the Dharma, and (3) in the Sangha; and (4) moral virtue dear to the saints.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have had their first glimpse of the unconditioned element, the ''asankhata'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nyanatiloka|first1=Maha Thera|title=Manual of Buddhist Terms and Doctrines|url=http://www.dhammawiki.com/index.php?title=Asankhata|website=Dhamma Wiki|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they see the [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|goal]], in the moment of the fruition of their path (magga-phala). Whereas the stream-entrant has seen nibbāna and, thus has verified confidence in it, the [[Arhat|arahant]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro|title=Sekha Sutta: The Learner|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn48/sn48.053.than.html|website=Access to Insight|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; can drink fully of its waters, so to speak, to use a simile from the Kosambi Sutta (SN 12.68) — of a "well", encountered along a desert road.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro|title=Kosambi Sutta: At Kosambi (On Knowing Dependent Co-arising)|url="My friend, although I have seen properly with right discernment, as it actually is present, that 'The cessation of becoming is Unbinding,' still I am not an arahant whose fermentations are ended. [2] It's as if there were a well along a road in a desert, with neither rope nor water bucket. A man would come along overcome by heat, oppressed by the heat, exhausted, dehydrated, &amp; thirsty. He would look into the well and would have knowledge of 'water,' but he would not dwell touching it with his body. [3] In the same way, although I have seen properly with right discernment, as it actually is present, that 'The cessation of becoming is Unbinding,' still I am not an arahant whose fermentations are ended."|website=Access to Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sotapanna "may state this about himself: 'Hell is ended; animal wombs are ended; the state of the hungry shades is ended; states of deprivation, destitution, the bad bourns are ended! I am a stream-winner, steadfast, never again destined for states of woe, headed for self-awakening!'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro|title=Vera Sutta: Animosity|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an10/an10.092.than.html|website=Access to Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the remaining three paths, namely: once-return (sakadāgāmin), non-return (anāgāmin), and sainthood (arahatta) become 'destined' (''sammatta niyāma'') for the stream-entrant.  Their enlightenment as a disciple (''ariya-sāvaka'') becomes inevitable within seven lives transmigrating among gods and humans;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thera|first1=Piyadassi|title=Ratana Sutta|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/snp/snp.2.01.piya.html|website=Access to Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tan|first1=Piya|title=Velama Sutta|url=http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/16.6-Velama-S-a9.20-piya.pdf|website=The Dharmafarers|quote=Furthermore, Sariputta, here a certain person fulfills moral virtue, but gains only limited concentration, gains only limited wisdom.20 With the total destruction of the three fetters, he is a seven-at-most,21 having re-arisen and wandered amongst gods and humans for seven lives at the most, makes an end of suffering.22}}&lt;/ref&gt; if they are diligent (''appamatta'', ''appamāda'') in the practice of the Teacher's (''satthāra'') message, they may fully awaken within their present life. They have very little future suffering to undergo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro|title=Nakhasikha Sutta|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn13/sn13.001.than.html|website=Access to Insight|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pāli Canon|early Buddhist texts]] (e.g. the Ratana Sutta) say that a stream-entrant will no longer be born in the animal womb, or hell realms; nor as a hungry ghost. The pathways to unfortunate rebirth destinations (''duggati'') have been closed to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro|title=Cakkhu Sutta|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn25/sn25.001.than.html|website=Access to Insight|accessdate=25 June 2015|quote=He is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell, in the animal womb, or in the realm of hungry shades. He is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream-entry.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Three fetters===
In the [[Pali Canon]], the qualities of a sotāpanna are described as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.than.html|title=Alagaddupama Sutta|accessdate=2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|…those monks who have abandoned the three fetters, are all stream-winners, steadfast, never again destined for states of woe, headed for self-awakening. This is how the Dharma well-proclaimed by me is clear, open, evident, stripped of rags.|Alagaddupama Sutta}}

The three fetters which the sotāpanna eradicates are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/stream2.html|title=Stream Entry|accessdate=2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/waytoend.html|title=The Noble Eightfold Path|accessdate=2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Self-view''' — The view of substance, or that what is compounded (''sankhata'') could be eternal in the [[Skandha#The five skandhas|five aggregates]] (form, feelings, perception, intentions, cognizance), and thus possessed or owned as [[Ātman (Buddhism)|'I']], 'me', or 'mine'. A sotāpanna doesn't actually have a view about self (''sakkāya-ditthi''), as that doctrine is proclaimed to be a subtle form of clinging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.011.ntbb.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Clinging to rites and rituals''' - Eradication of the view that one becomes pure simply through performing rituals (animal sacrifices, [[Ritual purification|ablutions]], chanting, etc.) or adhering to rigid [[moralism]] or relying on a god for non-causal delivery (''issara nimmāna''). Rites and rituals now function more to obscure, than to support the right view of the sotāpanna's now opened dharma eye. The sotāpanna realizes that deliverance can be won only through the practice of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]. It is the elimination of the notion that there are shortcuts to perfecting all virtues.
# '''Skeptical doubt''' - Doubt about the Buddha, his teaching (Dharma), and his community (Sangha) is eradicated because the sotāpanna personally experiences the true nature of reality through insight, and this insight confirms the accuracy of the Buddha’s teaching. Seeing removes doubt, because the sight is a form of vision (''dassana''), that allows one to know (''ñāṇa'').

===Defilements===
According to the Pali Commentary, six types of defilement would be eventually abandoned by a sotāpanna, and no major transgressions:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nyanaponika/wheel061.html|title=The Simile of the Cloth &amp; The Discourse on Effacement|accessdate=2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Nyanaponika Thera}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Envy
#Jealousy
#Hypocrisy
#Fraud
#Denigration
#Domineering

===Rebirth===
A sotāpanna will be safe from falling into the states of misery (they will not be born as an animal, [[ghost]], or hell being). Their lust, hatred and delusion will not be strong enough to cause rebirth in the lower realms. A sotāpanna will have to be reborn at most only seven more times in the human or heavenly worlds before attaining nibbāna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel277.html|title=Transcendental Dependent Arising|accessdate=2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Bhikkhu Bodhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not necessary for a sotāpanna to be reborn seven more times before attaining nibbāna, as an ardent practitioner may progress to the higher stages in the same life in which he/she reaches the Sotāpanna level by making an aspiration and persistent effort to reach the final goal of nibbāna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/gunaratana/wheel351.html|title=The Jhanas|accessdate=2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Henepola Gunaratana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Buddha, there are three types of sotapannas classifiable according to their possible rebirths:
(1) "If a man, after the disappearance of the 3 fetters (personality-belief, skeptical doubt, attachment to rules and rituals;(samyojana), has entered the stream (to Nibbāna), he is no more subject to rebirth in lower worlds, is firmly established, destined to full enlightenment. After having passed amongst the heavenly and human beings only seven times more through the round of rebirths, he puts an end to suffering. Such a man is called 'one with 7 births at the utmost' (sattakkhattu-parama).
(2) "If a man, after the disappearance of the 3 fetters.... is destined to full enlightenment, he, after having passed among noble families two or three times through the round of rebirths, puts an end to suffering. Such a man is called 'one passing from one noble family to another' (kolankola).
(3) "If a man, after the disappearance of the 3 fetters.... is destined to full enlightenment, he, after having only once more returned to human existence, puts an end to suffering. Such a man is called 'one germinating only once more' (eka-bījī).
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sotapanna|url=http://www.dhammawiki.com/index.php?title=Sotapanna|website=Dhamma Wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Six actions that are not committed===
A sotāpanna will not commit six wrong actions:

#Murdering one's own mother.
#Murdering one's own father.
#Murdering an [[Arahant (Buddhism)|arahant]].
#Maliciously injuring the Buddha to the point of drawing blood.
#Deliberately creating a schism in the monastic community.
#Taking another Teacher [besides Buddha].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tan|first1=Piya|title=Bahu Dhatuka Sutta|url=http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/29.1a-Bahudhatuka-S-m115-piya.pdf|website=The Dharmafarers|accessdate=25 June 2015|quote=(4) He understands that it is impossible, there is no chance, that an individual attained to right view, would deprive his mother of life—this is not possible.41 And he understands that it is possible, there is the chance, that an ordinary worldling, would deprive his mother of life—this is possible. (5) He understands that it is impossible, there is no chance, that [65] an individual attained to right view, would deprive his father of life—this is not possible. And he understands that it is possible, there is the chance, that an ordinary worldling, would deprive his father of life—this is possible. (6) He understands that it is impossible, there is no chance, that an individual attained to right view, would deprive an arhat of life—this is not possible. And he understands that it is possible, there is the chance, that an ordinary worldling, would deprive an arhat of life—this is possible. (7) He understands that it is impossible, there is no chance, that an individual attained to right view, would draw the Tathagata’s blood—this is not possible. And he understands that it is possible, there is the chance, that an ordinary worldling, would draw the Tathagata’s blood—this is possible. (8) He understands that it is impossible, there is no chance, that an individual attained to right view, would divide the monastic order [the Sangha]—this is not possible. And he understands that it is possible, there is the chance, that an ordinary worldling, would divide the monastic order—this is possible. (9) He understands that it is impossible, there is no chance, that an individual attained to right view, would proclaim another Teacher—this is not possible.42 And he understands that it is possible, there is the chance, that an ordinary worldling, would declare another Teacher—this is possible.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textual references==

===Suttas===
The Buddha spoke favorably about the sotapanna on many occasions, and even though it is (only) the first of ''ariya sangha'' members, he or she is welcomed by all other sangha-members for he or she practices for the benefit and welfare of many. In the literature, the ''arya sangha'' is described as "the four" when taken as pairs, and as "the eight" when taken as individual types. This refers to the four supra-mundane fruits (attainments: "phala") and the corresponding four supra-mundane paths (of those practicing to attain those fruits: "magga").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/sangha.html|title=Sangha|accessdate=2010-08-22|publisher=Access to Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|"The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples who have practiced well... who have practiced straight-forwardly... who have practiced methodically... who have practiced masterfully — in other words, the four types [of noble disciples] when taken as pairs, the eight when taken as individual types — they are the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples: worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect, the incomparable field of merit for the world."|[[Anguttara Nikaya]], 11.12}}

This is called "the recollection of the Sangha" (''sanghanussati''). It can also be interpreted as, "They are the Blessed One's disciples, who have practiced well, who have practiced directly, who have practiced insight-fully, those who practice with integrity (to share what they have learned with others). They give occasion for incomparable goodness to arise in the world because gifts to them bear great fruit and benefit to the giver.
The fifty-fifth Samyutta of the [[Samyutta Nikaya]] is called the Sotāpatti-saṃyutta, and concerns sotapannas and their attainment. In the discourse-numbers (of that chapter) 1-4, 6-9, 11-14, 16-20, 22-36, 39-49, 51, 53, 54, sotapannas are praised as Sangha members by and to: the sick, lay followers, people on their deathbed, bhikkhunis, bhikkhus, and devas, and end up becoming the well-being and benefit of many.

===Dhammapada===
From '''[[Dhammapada]]''' verse 178:

:'''Sole dominion over the earth,'''
:'''going to heaven,'''
:'''lordship over all worlds:'''
:'''the fruit of stream-entry'''
:'''excels them.'''

According to Mahāyāna Master [[Bhikshu]] [[Hsuan Hua]]'s Commentary on the [[Diamond Sutra|Vajra Sutra]], 
{{quote|A Shrotaapanna is a first stage [[Arhat]]. Certification to the first fruit of Arhatship, which is within the [[Hinayana|Small Vehicle]], comes when the eighty-eight categories of view delusions are smashed." p. 77 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://online.sfsu.edu/%7Erone/Buddhism/BTTStexts/ps.vajra.02.020503.screen.pdf|title=The Vajra Prajna Paramita Sutra - A General Explanation|accessdate=2009-09-16|publisher=Buddhist Text Translation Society|last=Venerable Master Hsuan Hua}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Venerable Hsuan Hua continues, 
{{quote|The first fruit is that of Srotāpanna, a Sanskrit word which means "One Who Has Entered the Flow." He opposes the flow of common people's six dusts and enters the flow of the sage's dharma-nature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60578">'''Supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics''' or '''stochastics''' ('''STS''') is an exact theory of [[Stochastic differential equation|stochastic (partial) differential equations]] (SDEs), the class of mathematical models with the widest applicability covering, in particular, all continuous time [[dynamical system]]s, with and without noise. The main utility of the theory from the physical point of view is a rigorous theoretical explanation of the ubiquitous spontaneous long-range dynamical behavior that manifests itself across disciplines via such phenomena as [[Pink noise|1/f]], [[Flicker noise|flicker]], and [[crackling noise|crackling]] noises and the power-law statistics, or [[Zipf's law]], of instantonic processes like earthquakes and neuroavalanches. From the mathematical point of view, STS is interesting because it bridges the two major parts of mathematical physics – the [[dynamical systems theory]] and [[Topological quantum field theories|topological field theories]]. Besides these and related disciplines such as [[algebraic topology]] and [[Quantum field theory|supersymmetric field theories]], STS is also connected with the traditional theory of [[stochastic differential equation]]s and the theory of pseudo-Hermitian operators.

The theory begun with the application of [[BRST quantization|BRST]] gauge fixing procedure to Langevin SDEs,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; that was later adapted to [[classical mechanics]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niemi|first=A.

The main idea of the theory is to study, instead of trajectories, the SDE-defined temporal evolution of [[differential form]]s. This evolution has an intrinsic BRST or topological supersymmetry representing the preservation of topology and/or the concept of proximity in the [[phase space]] by continuous time dynamics. The theory identifies a model as [[Chaos theory|chaotic]], in the generalized, stochastic sense, if its ground state is not supersymmetric, i.e., if the supersymmetry is broken spontaneously. Accordingly, the emergent long-range behavior that always accompanies dynamical chaos and its derivatives such as [[turbulence]] and [[self-organized criticality]] can be understood as a consequence of the [[Goldstone theorem]].

== History and relation to other theories ==

The first relation between supersymmetry and stochastic dynamics was established by [[Giorgio Parisi]] and Nicolas Sourlas&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parisi|first=G.|last2=Sourlas|first2=N.|date=1979|title=Random Magnetic Fields, Supersymmetry, and Negative Dimensions|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=43|issue=11|pages=744–745|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.43.744|bibcode=1979PhRvL..43..744P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parisi|first=G.|title=Supersymmetric field theories and stochastic differential equations|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0550321382905387|journal=Nuclear Physics B|language=en|volume=206|issue=2|pages=321–332|doi=10.1016/0550-3213(82)90538-7|year=1982|bibcode=1982NuPhB.206..321P}}&lt;/ref&gt; who demonstrated that the application of the [[BRST quantization|BRST]] gauge fixing procedure to Langevin SDEs, i.e., to SDEs with linear phase spaces, gradient flow vector fields, and additive noises, results in N=2 supersymmetric models. Since then, the so-emerged supersymmetry of Langevin SDEs has been studied rather extensively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cecotti|first=S|last2=Girardello|first2=L|date=1983-01-01|title=Stochastic and parastochastic aspects of supersymmetric functional measures: A new non-perturbative approach to supersymmetry|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003491683901720|journal=Annals of Physics|volume=145|issue=1|pages=81–99|doi=10.1016/0003-4916(83)90172-0|bibcode=1983AnPhy.145...81C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zinn-Justin|first=J.|date=1986-09-29|title=Renormalization and stochastic quantization|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0550321386905924|journal=Nuclear Physics B|volume=275|issue=1|pages=135–159|doi=10.1016/0550-3213(86)90592-4|bibcode=1986NuPhB.275..135Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dijkgraaf|first=R.|last2=Orlando|first2=D.|last3=Reffert|first3=S.|date=2010-01-11|title=Relating field theories via stochastic quantization|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0550321309003836|journal=Nuclear Physics B|volume=824|issue=3|pages=365–386|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2009.07.018|via=|bibcode=2010NuPhB.824..365D|arxiv=0903.0732}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kurchan|first=J.|date=1992-07-01|title=Supersymmetry in spin glass dynamics|journal=Journal de Physique I|language=en|volume=2|issue=7|pages=1333–1352|doi=10.1051/jp1:1992214|issn=1155-4304|bibcode=1992JPhy1...2.1333K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Relations between this supersymmetry and a few physical concepts have been established including the [[Fluctuation-dissipation theorem|fluctuation dissipation theorems]],&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; [[Jarzynski equality]],&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Mallick|first=K.|last2=Moshe|first2=M.|last3=Orland|first3=H.|date=2007-11-13|title=Supersymmetry and Nonequilibrium Work Relations|eprint=0711.2059|class=cond-mat.stat-mech}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Onsager reciprocal relations|Onsager principle of microscopic reversibility]],&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gozzi|first=E.|date=1984|title=Onsager principle of microscopic reversibility and supersymmetry|journal=Physical Review D|volume=30|issue=6|pages=1218–1227|doi=10.1103/physrevd.30.1218|bibcode=1984PhRvD..30.1218G}}&lt;/ref&gt; solutions of Fokker-Planck equations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernstein|first=M.|date=1984|title=Supersymmetry and the Bistable Fokker-Planck Equation|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=52|issue=22|pages=1933–1935|doi=10.1103/physrevlett.52.1933|bibcode=1984PhRvL..52.1933B}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[self-organization]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olemskoi|first=A.

Real dynamical systems, however, are never purely Langevin or classical mechanical. In addition, physically meaningful Langevin SDEs never break supersymmetry spontaneously. Therefore, for the purpose of the identification of the spontaneous supersymmetry breaking as [[Chaos theory|dynamical chaos]], the generalization of the Parisi-Sourlas approach to SDEs of general form is needed. This generalization could come only after a rigorous formulation of the theory of pseudo-Hermitian operators&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mostafazadeh|first=A.|date=2002-07-19|title=Pseudo-Hermiticity versus PT-symmetry III: Equivalence of pseudo-Hermiticity and the presence of antilinear symmetries|journal=Journal of Mathematical Physics|volume=43|issue=8|pages=3944–3951|doi=10.1063/1.1489072|issn=0022-2488|bibcode=2002JMP....43.3944M|arxiv=math-ph/0203005}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the stochastic evolution operator is pseudo-Hermitian in the general case. Such generalization&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; showed that all SDEs possess N=1 BRST or topological supersymmetry (TS) and this finding completes the story of relation between supersymmetry and SDEs.

In parallel to the BRST procedure approach to SDEs, mathematicians working in the [[dynamical systems theory]] introduced and studied the concept of generalized transfer operator defined for random dynamical systems.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2002|title=Dynamical Zeta Functions and Transfer Operators|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200208/fea-ruelle.pdf|journal=Notices of the AMS|volume=49|issue=8|pages=887|author=Reulle, D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruelle|first=D.|date=1990-12-01|title=An extension of the theory of Fredholm determinants|journal=Publications Mathématiques de l'Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques|language=en|volume=72|issue=1|pages=175–193|doi=10.1007/bf02699133|issn=0073-8301}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept underlies the most important object of the STS, the stochastic evolution operator, and provides it with a solid mathematical meaning.

== Parisi–Sourlas approach to Langevin SDEs ==
In the context of supersymmetric approach to stochastic dynamics, the term Langevin SDEs denotes SDEs with Euclidean phase space, &lt;math&gt; X = \mathbb{R}^n &lt;/math&gt;, gradient flow vector field, and additive [[Gaussian process|Gaussian]] [[white noise]],

&lt;math display="block"&gt; \dot x(t) = - \partial U(x(t))+(2\Theta)^{1/2} \xi(t),&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt; x\in X &lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt; \xi \in \mathbb{R}^n &lt;/math&gt;is the noise variable, &lt;math&gt; \Theta &lt;/math&gt; is the noise intensity, and &lt;math&gt; \partial U(x)&lt;/math&gt;, which in coordinates &lt;math&gt; (\partial U(x))^i \equiv \delta^{ij}\partial_jU(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \partial_i U(x) \equiv \partial U(x)/\partial x^i&lt;/math&gt;, is the gradient flow vector field with &lt;math&gt; U(x)&lt;/math&gt; being the Langevin function often interpreted as the energy of the purely dissipative stochastic dynamical system.

The Parisi-Sourlas method is a way of construction of the [[Path integral formulation|path integral]] representation of the Langevin SDE. It can be thought of as a [[BRST quantization|BRST]] gauge fixing procedure that uses the Langevin SDE as a gauge condition. Namely, one considers the following functional integral,

&lt;math display="block"&gt;
{\mathcal W} = \left\langle\int \dots \int J \left(\prod\nolimits_\tau \delta(\dot x(\tau) - {\mathcal F}(x(\tau)))\right)Dx \right\rangle_\text{noise} ,
&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt; \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; denotes the r.h.s. of the Langevin SDE, &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \langle \cdot \rangle_\text{noise} \equiv \int \dots \int \cdot P(\xi) D\xi &lt;/math&gt; is the operation of stochastic averaging with &lt;math&gt; P(\xi) \propto e^{- \int_{t'}^t d\tau \xi^2(\tau)/2} &lt;/math&gt; being the normalized distribution of noise configurations,

&lt;math&gt; 
\textstyle J = \operatorname{Det} \frac{\delta(\dot x (\tau) - {\mathcal F} (x(\tau)))}{\delta x (\tau')}
&lt;/math&gt;

is the Jacobian of the corresponding functional derivative, and the path integration is over all closed paths, &lt;math&gt; x(t)=x(t') &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; t'&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt; t&gt;t'&lt;/math&gt;are the initial and final moments of temporal evolution.

=== Topological interpretation ===
Topological aspects of the Parisi-Sourlas construction can be briefly outlined in the following manner.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The delta-functional, i.e., the collection of the infinite number of delta-functions, ensures that only solutions of the Langevin SDE contribute to &lt;math&gt; \mathcal W&lt;/math&gt;. In the context of BRST procedure, these solutions can be viewed as [[Gribov copies]]. Each solution contributes either positive or negative unity: &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
{\mathcal W} = \textstyle \left\langle I_N(\xi)\right\rangle_\text{noise}
&lt;/math&gt;with &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
I_N(\xi) = \sum_\text{solutions} \operatorname{sign}J
&lt;/math&gt;  being the index of the so-called Nicolai map, &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \xi = (\dot x + \partial U)/(2\Theta)^{1/2} &lt;/math&gt;, which in this case is the map from the space of closed paths in &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
X
&lt;/math&gt; to the space of noise configurations, a map that provides a noise configuration at which a given closed path is a solution of the Langevin SDE. &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
I_N(\xi)
&lt;/math&gt; can be viewed as a realization of [[Poincaré–Hopf theorem]] on the infinite-dimensional space of close paths with the Langevin SDE playing the role of the vector field and with the solutions of Langevin SDE playing the role of the critical points with index &lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{sign}J
&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
I_N(\xi)
&lt;/math&gt; is independent of the noise configuration because it is of topological character. The same it true for its stochastic average, &lt;math&gt; \mathcal W&lt;/math&gt;, which is not the partition function of the model but, instead, its [[Witten index]].

=== Path integral representation ===
With the help of a standard field theoretic technique that involves introduction of additional field called Lagrange multiplier, &lt;math&gt; B&lt;/math&gt;, and a pair of fermionic fields called [[Faddeev–Popov ghost]]s,  &lt;math&gt; \chi, \bar\chi&lt;/math&gt;, the Witten index can be given the following form,

&lt;math display="block"&gt;
{\mathcal W} = \int\dots\int_{p.b.c.} e^{(Q,\Psi)}D\Phi,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \Phi &lt;/math&gt; denotes collection of all the fields, p.b.c. stands for periodic boundary conditions, the so-called gauge fermion, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \Psi = \int_{t'}^td\tau (\imath_{\dot x} - \bar d)(\tau)&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \imath_{\dot x} = i \bar\chi_j\dot x^j &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \textstyle \bar d = - i \bar\chi_j\delta^{jk}(\partial_kU + \Theta  i B_k)&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[BRST quantization|BRST symmetry]] defined via its action on arbitrary functional &lt;math&gt;A(\Phi)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt; (Q, A(\Phi)) = \textstyle \int _{t'}^td\tau(\chi^i(\tau)\delta/\delta x^i(\tau) + B_i(\tau)\delta/\delta \bar\chi_i(\tau)) A(\Phi) &lt;/math&gt;. In the [[BRST quantization|BRST]] formalism, the Q-exact pieces like, &lt;math&gt;(Q,\Psi)&lt;/math&gt;, serve as gauge fixing tools. Therefore, the path integral expression for &lt;math&gt; \mathcal W&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as a model whose action contains nothing else but the gauge fixing term. This is a definitive feature of [[topological quantum field theory|Witten-type topological field theories]] and in this particular case of BRST procedure approach to SDEs, the BRST symmetry can be also recognized as the topological supersymmetry.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A common way to explain the BRST procedure is to say that the BRST symmetry generates the fermionic version of the gauge transformations, whereas its overall effect on the path integral is to limit the integration only to configurations that satisfy a specified gauge condition. This interpretation also applies to Parisi-Sourlas approach with the deformations of the trajectory and the Langevin SDE playing the roles of the gauge transformations and the gauge condition respectively.

=== Operator representation ===
Physical fermions in the high-energy physics and condensed matter models have antiperiodic boundary conditions in time. The unconventional periodic boundary conditions for fermions in the path integral expression for the Witten index is the origin of the topological character of this object. These boundary conditions reveal themselves in the operator representation of the Witten index as the alternating sign operator,&lt;math display="block"&gt;
{\mathcal W}  = \operatorname{Tr}(-1)^{\hat n} \hat {\mathcal M}_{tt'},
&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\hat n &lt;/math&gt;  is the operator of the number of ghosts/fermions and the finite-time stochastic evolution operator (SEO), &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \hat{\mathcal M }_{tt'} = e^{- (t-t')\hat H }&lt;/math&gt;, where, &lt;math display="block"&gt; \hat H = \hat L_{-\partial U} - \Theta \hat \triangle= [\hat d, \hat{\bar d}],&lt;/math&gt;is the infinitesimal SEO with &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat{L} &lt;/math&gt; being the Lie derivative along the subscript vector field, &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \hat \triangle&lt;/math&gt; being the Laplacian, &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat{d} = \chi^i \partial/\partial x^i &lt;/math&gt; being the [[exterior derivative]], which is the operator representative of the TS, and  &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat{\bar d} = - (i\hat{\bar\chi}_i) \delta^{ij} ( \partial_jU + \Theta (i\hat B_j)) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;i {\hat B}_j = \partial/ \partial x^j&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;i{\hat{\bar \chi}}_j = \partial/ \partial \chi^j&lt;/math&gt; are bosonic and fermionic momenta, and with square brackets denoting bi-graded commutator, i.e., it is an anticommutator if both operators are fermionic (contain odd total number of &lt;math&gt; \chi &lt;/math&gt;'s and &lt;math&gt; \hat {\bar \chi} &lt;/math&gt;'s) and a commutator otherwise. The exterior derivative and &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat{\bar d} &lt;/math&gt; are [[supercharge]]s. They are [[nilpotent]], e.g., &lt;math&gt;\hat d^2=0&lt;/math&gt;, and commutative with the SEO. In other words, Langevin SDEs possess N=2 supersymmetry. The fact that &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat{\bar d} &lt;/math&gt; is a supercharge is accidental. For SDEs of arbitrary form, this is not true.

=== Hilbert space ===
The wavefunctions are functions not only of the bosonic variables, &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, but also of the [[Grassmann number]]s or fermions, &lt;math&gt;\chi\in TX&lt;/math&gt;, from the tangent space of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. The wavefunctions can be viewed as [[differential form]]s on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with the fermions playing the role of the differentials &lt;math&gt;\chi\equiv dx\wedge&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The concept of infinitesimal SEO generalizes the [[Fokker–Planck equation|Fokker–Planck operator]], which is essentially the SEO acting on top differential forms that have the meaning of the total [[probability distribution]]s. Differential forms of lesser degree can be interpreted, at least locally on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, as [[conditional probability distribution]]s.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ovchinnikov|first=I.V.|date=2013-01-15|title=Topological field theory of dynamical systems.

Without it, the Witten index representing the most fundamental object of the model—the partition function of the noise—would not exist and the dynamical partition function would not represent the number of fixed points of the SDE ([[#Spontaneous supersymmetry breaking and chaos|see below]]). The most general understanding of the wavefunctions is the coordinate-free objects that contain information not only on trajectories but also on the evolution of the differentials and/or [[Lyapunov exponent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graham|first=R.|date=1988|title=Lyapunov Exponents and Supersymmetry of Stochastic Dynamical Systems|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0295-5075/5/i=2/a=002|journal=EPL|language=en|volume=5|issue=2|pages=101–106|doi=10.1209/0295-5075/5/2/002|issn=0295-5075|bibcode=1988EL......5..101G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation to nonlinear sigma model and algebraic topology ==
In Ref.,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; a model has been introduced that can be viewed as a 1D prototype of the topological nonlinear sigma models (TNSM),&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; a subclass of the [[topological quantum field theory|Witten-type topological field theories]]. The 1D TNSM is defined for [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian phase spaces]] while for Euclidean phase spaces it reduces to the Parisi-Sourlas model. Its key difference from STS is the diffusion operator which is the [[Hodge Laplacian]] for 1D TNSM and &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat  L_{e_a} \hat  L_{e_a} &lt;/math&gt;for STS . This difference in unimportant in the context of relation between STS and algebraic topology, the relation established by the theory of 1D TNSM (see, e.g., Refs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;).

The model is defined by the following evolution operator &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \hat H = \hat L_{-\partial U} + \Theta[\hat d, \hat{d}^\dagger]&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math display="inline"&gt; (\partial U)^i = g^{ij}\partial_j U&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math display="inline"&gt; g&lt;/math&gt; being the metric, &lt;math display="inline"&gt; [\hat d, \hat{d}^\dagger]&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hodge Laplacian]], and the [[differential form]]s from the [[exterior algebra]] of the phase space, &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \Omega(X)&lt;/math&gt;, are viewed as wavefunctions. There exists a similarity transformation, &lt;math&gt;\hat H \to {\hat H}_U = e^{U/2\Theta} \hat H e^{- U/2\Theta} &lt;/math&gt;, that brings the evolution operator to the explicitly Hermitian form &lt;math&gt;{\hat H}_U = \Theta [\hat d_U, \hat d_U^\dagger] &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\hat d_U = e^{U/2\Theta} \hat d e^{-U/2\Theta} = 
\chi^i(\partial/\partial x^i - \partial_i U /2\Theta)   &lt;/math&gt;. In the Euclidean case, &lt;math&gt;{\hat H}_U &lt;/math&gt; is the Hamiltonian of a N=2 [[supersymmetric quantum mechanics]]. One can introduce two Hermitian operators, &lt;math&gt;\hat q_1 = (\hat d_U + \hat d_U^\dagger) /2^{1/2}   &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat q_2 = i (\hat d_U - \hat d_U^\dagger) /2^{1/2}   &lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;{\hat H}_U = \Theta \hat q_1^2 = \Theta \hat q_2^2 &lt;/math&gt; . This demonstrates that the spectrum of &lt;math&gt;{\hat H}_U &lt;/math&gt; and/or &lt;math&gt;{\hat H} &lt;/math&gt; is real and nonnegative. This is also true for SEOs of Langevin SDEs. For the SDEs of arbitrary form, however, this is no longer true as the eigenvalues of the SEO can be negative and even complex, which actually allows for the TS to be broken spontanenously.

The following properties of the evolution operator of 1D TNSM hold even for the SEO of the SDEs of arbitrary form. The evolution operator commutes with the operator of the degree of differential forms. As a result, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \hat H  = \hat H^{(\dim X)} \oplus \dots \oplus \hat H^{(0)} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat H^{(k)} = \hat H |_{\Omega^{(k)}} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \Omega^{(n)}(X) &lt;/math&gt; is the space of differential forms of degree &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, due to the presence of TS, &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \Omega(X)={\mathcal H} \oplus {\mathcal N} \oplus (\hat d {\mathcal N})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math display="inline"&gt; {\mathcal H}&lt;/math&gt; are the supersymmetric eigenstates, &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \theta's&lt;/math&gt;, non-trivial in [[de Rham cohomology]] whereas the rest are the pairs of non-supersymmetric eigenstates of the form &lt;math display="inline"&gt; |\vartheta\rangle &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \hat d |\vartheta\rangle &lt;/math&gt;. All supersymmetric eigenstates have exactly zero eigenvalue and, barring accidental situations, all non-supersymmetric states have non-zero eigenvalues. Non-supersymmetric pairs of eigenstates do not contribute to the Witten index, which equals the difference in the numbers of the supersymmetric states of even and odd degrees, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
{\mathcal W}  = \#\{\text{even }\theta's\} - \#\{\text{odd }\theta's\}.
&lt;/math&gt;For compact &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;, each de Rham cohomology class provides one supersymmetric eigenstate and the Witten index equals the Euler characteristic of the phase space.

==  BRST procedure for SDEs of arbitrary form ==
The Parisi-Sourlas method of BRST procedure approach to Langevin SDEs have also been adapted to classical mechanics,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; stochastic generalization of classical mechanics,&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; higher order Langevin SDEs,&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kleinert|first=H.|last2=Shabanov|first2=S. V.|date=1997-10-27|title=Supersymmetry in stochastic processes with higher-order time derivatives|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375960197006609|journal=Physics Letters A|volume=235|issue=2|pages=105–112|doi=10.1016/s0375-9601(97)00660-9|via=|bibcode=1997PhLA..235..105K|arxiv=quant-ph/9705042}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, more recently, to SDEs of arbitrary form.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; While there exist standard techniques that allow to consider models with colored noises, higher-dimensional "base spaces" described by partial SDEs etc., the key elements of STS can be discussed using the following basic class of SDEs,   &lt;math display="block"&gt; \dot x(t) = F(x(t))+(2\Theta)^{1/2}e_a(x(t))\xi^a(t),&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x\in X &lt;/math&gt; is a point in the phase space assumed for simplicity a [[Closed manifold|closed]] [[topological manifold]], &lt;math&gt; F(x)\in TX_x &lt;/math&gt; is a sufficiently smooth [[vector field]], called flow vector field, from the [[tangent space]] of &lt;math&gt; X&lt;/math&gt;, and  &lt;math&gt; e_a \in TX, a=1, \ldots, \dim X &lt;/math&gt;  is a set of sufficiently smooth vector fields that specify how the system is coupled to the noise, which is called [[Additive noise|additive]]/[[Multiplicative noise|multiplicative]] depending on whether &lt;math&gt; e_a &lt;/math&gt;'s are independent/dependent on the position on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Ambiguity of path integral representation and Ito–Stratonovich dilemma ===
BRST gauge fixing procedure goes along the same lines as in case of Langevin SDEs. The topological interpretation of the BRST procedure is just the same and the path integral representation of the Witten index is defined by the gauge fermion, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \Psi&lt;/math&gt;, given by the same expression but with the generalized version of&lt;math display="inline"&gt; \textstyle \bar d = \imath_{F} - \Theta \imath_{e_a} (Q,\imath_{e_a})&lt;/math&gt;. There is one important subtlety, however, that appears on the way to the operator representation of the model. Unlike for Langevin SDEs, classical mechanics, and other SDEs with additive noises, the path integral representation of the finite-time SEO is an ambiguous object. This ambiguity originates from non-commutativity of momenta and position operators, e.g., &lt;math&gt; \hat B \hat x \ne  \hat x \hat B &lt;/math&gt;. As a result, &lt;math&gt; B(\tau) x(\tau)  &lt;/math&gt; in the path integral representation has a whole one-parameter family of possible interpretations in the operator representation, &lt;math&gt; (\alpha \hat B \hat x + (1-\alpha)\hat x \hat B)|\psi(\tau)\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; |\psi(\tau)\rangle  &lt;/math&gt; denotes an arbitrary wavefunction. Accordingly, there is a whole &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-family of infinitesimal SEOs,   &lt;math display="block"&gt; \hat H_\alpha = \hat L_F - \Theta\hat L_{e_a} \hat L_{e_a}= [\hat d, \hat{\bar d}_\alpha],&lt;/math&gt;with  &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat{\bar d}_\alpha = \hat{\imath}_{F_\alpha} - \Theta \hat{\imath}_{e_a}\hat  L_{e_a} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{\imath}_{F_\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; being the [[interior multiplication]] by the subscript vector field, and the "shifted" flow vector field being &lt;math&gt; \textstyle F_\alpha = F - \Theta(2\alpha-1)(e_a\cdot\partial) e_a &lt;/math&gt;. Noteworthy, unlike in Langevin SDEs, &lt;math&gt;\hat {\bar d}_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is not a [[supercharge]] and STS cannot be identified as a N=2 supersymmetric theory in the general case.

The path integral representation of stochastic dynamics is equivalent to the traditional understanding of SDEs as of a continuous time limit of [[stochastic difference equation]]s where different choices of parameter &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; are called "interpretations" of SDEs. The choice &lt;math&gt; \alpha=1/2  &lt;/math&gt;, for which &lt;math&gt; \textstyle F_{1/2} = F &lt;/math&gt; and which is known in quantum theory as [[Wigner–Weyl transform|Weyl symmetrization]] rule, is known as the [[Stratonovich integral|Stratonovich interpretation]], whereas &lt;math&gt; \alpha=1  &lt;/math&gt; as the [[Itô calculus|Ito interpretation]]. While in quantum theory the Weyl symmetrization is preferred because it guaranties hermiticity of Hamiltonians, in STS the Weyl-Stratonovich approach is preferred because it corresponds to the most natural mathematical meaning of the finite-time SEO discussed [[Supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics#Supersymmetric theory of SDEs without BRST quantization|below]]—the stochastically averaged pullback induced by the SDE-defined diffeomorphisms.

=== Eigensystem of stochastic evolution operator ===

[[File:Possible types of spectra of SEO of STS 3 sphere.png|thumb|The three possible types of SEO spectra on a 3D sphere.

Vertical arrowed lines visualize supersymmetry operator.]]

As compared to the SEO of Langevin SDEs, the SEO of a general form SDE is pseudo-Hermitian.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As a result, the eigenvalues of non-supersymmetric eigenstates are not restricted to be real positive, whereas the eigenvalues of supersymmetric eigenstates are still exactly zero. Just like for Langevin SDEs and nonlinear sigma model, the structure of the eigensystem of the SEO reestablishes the topological character of the Witten index: the contributions from the non-supersymmetric pairs of eigenstates vanish and only supersymmetric states contribute the [[Euler characteristic]] of (closed) &lt;math&gt; X&lt;/math&gt;. Among other properties of the SEO spectra is that &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat H^{(\operatorname{dim} X)} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat H^{(0)} &lt;/math&gt; never break TS, i.e., &lt;math&gt; \textstyle Re (\operatorname{spec} \hat H^{(\operatorname{dim} X)}) \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;. As a result, there are three major types of the SEO spectra presented in the figure on the right. The two types that have negative (real parts of) eigenvalues correspond to the spontaneously broken TS.  All types of the SEO spectra are realizable as can be established, e.g., from the exact relation between the theory of [[Dynamo theory#Kinematic dynamo theory|kinematic dynamo]] and STS.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

==  STS without BRST procedure   ==
===  The mathematical meaning of stochastic evolution operator  ===
The finite-time SEO can be obtained in another, more mathematical way based on the idea to study the SDE-induced actions on differential forms directly, without going through the BRST gauge fixing procedure. The so-obtained finite-time SEO is known in [[dynamical systems theory]] as the generalized transfer operator&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; and it has also been used in the classical theory of SDEs (see, e.g., Refs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stochastic differential geometry at Saint-Flour|last=Ancona|first=A.|last2=Elworthy|first2=K. D.|last3=Emery|first3=M.|last4=Kunita|first4=H.|date=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783642341700|location=|pages=|oclc=811000422}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stochastic flows and stochastic differential equations|last=Kunita|first=H.|date=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521599252|location=|pages=|oclc=36864963}}&lt;/ref&gt; ). The contribution to this construction from STS&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; is the exposition of the supersymmetric structure underlying it and establishing its relation to the BRST procedure for SDEs.

Namely, for any configuration of the noise, &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, and an initial condition, &lt;math&gt;x(t')=x'\in X&lt;/math&gt;, SDE defines a unique solution/trajectory, &lt;math&gt;x(t)\in X&lt;/math&gt;. Even for noise configurations that are non-differentiable with respect to time, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, the solution is differentiable with respect to the initial condition, &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slavík|first=A.|title=Generalized differential equations: Differentiability of solutions with respect to initial conditions and parameters|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022247X13000449|journal=Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications|language=en|volume=402|issue=1|pages=261–274|doi=10.1016/j.jmaa.2013.01.027|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, SDE defines the family of the noise-configuration-dependent [[diffeomorphism]]s of the phase space to itself, &lt;math&gt;M_{tt'}:X\to X&lt;/math&gt;. This object can be understood as a collection and/or definition of all the noise-configuration-dependent trajectories, &lt;math&gt;x(t) = M_{tt'}(x')&lt;/math&gt;. The diffeomorphisms induce actions or [[Pullback (differential geometry)#Pullback of differential forms|pullbacks]], &lt;math&gt; \textstyle M^*_{t't}:\Omega(X)\to\Omega(X) &lt;/math&gt;. Unlike, say, trajectories in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, pullbacks are linear objects even for nonlinear &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Linear objects can be averaged and averaging &lt;math&gt; M^*_{t't}&lt;/math&gt; over the noise configurations, &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, results in the finite-time SEO which is unique and corresponds to the Weyl-Stratonovich interpretation of the BRST procedure approach to SDEs, &lt;math&gt; \hat{\mathcal M }_{tt'} = \langle M^*_{t't} \rangle_\text{noise}=e^{-(t-t')\hat H_{1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Within this definition of the finite-time SEO, the Witten index can be recognized as the sharp trace of the generalized transfer operator.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  It also links the Witten index to the [[Lefschetz fixed-point theorem|Lefschetz index]],&lt;math display="inline"&gt;
\textstyle I_L=\operatorname{Tr} (-1)^{\hat n} M_{t't}^*= \sum_{x\in \operatorname{fix} M_{tt'}} \operatorname{sign} \operatorname{det} (\delta_j^i -\partial M_{tt'}^i(x) /\partial x^j)
&lt;/math&gt;, a topological constant that equals the [[Euler characteristic]] of the (closed) phase space. Namely, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
\textstyle {\mathcal W} = \operatorname{Tr} (-1)^{\hat n} \langle M_{t't}^* \rangle_\text{noise} = \langle \operatorname{Tr} (-1)^{\hat n} M_{t't}^* \rangle_\text{noise} = I_{L}
&lt;/math&gt;.

===  The meaning of supersymmetry and the butterfly effect ===
The N=2 supersymmetry of Langevin SDEs has been linked to the [[Onsager reciprocal relations|Onsager principle of microscopic reversibility]]&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; and [[Jarzynski equality]].&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; In classical mechanics, a relation between the corresponding N=2 supersymmetry and [[ergodicity]] has been proposed.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; In general form SDEs, where physical arguments may not be applicable, a lower level explanation of the TS is available. This explanation is based on understanding of the finite-time SEO as a stochastically averaged pullback of the SDE-defined diffeomorphisms (see subsection above). In this picture, the question of why any SDE has TS is the same as the question of why [[exterior derivative]] commutes with the pullback of any diffeomorphism. The answer to this question is differentiability of the corresponding map.  In other words, the presence of TS is the algebraic version of the statement that continuous-time flow preserves continuity of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Two initially close points will remain close during evolution, which is just yet another way of saying that &lt;math&gt;M_{tt'}&lt;/math&gt; is a diffeomorphism.

In deterministic chaotic models, initially close points can part in the limit of infinitely long temporal evolution. This is the famous [[butterfly effect]], which is equivalent to the statement that &lt;math&gt;M_{tt'}&lt;/math&gt; losses differentiability in this limit. In algebraic representation of dynamics, the evolution in the infinitely long time limit is described by the ground state of the SEO and the butterfly effect is equivalent to the spontaneous breakdown of TS, i.e., to the situation when the ground state is not supersymmetric. Noteworthy, unlike traditional understanding of deterministic chaotic dynamics, the spontaneous breakdown of TS works also for stochastic cases. This is the most important generalization because deterministic dynamics is, in fact, a mathematical idealization. Real dynamical systems cannot be isolated from their environments and thus always experience stochastic influence.

== Spontaneous supersymmetry breaking and dynamical chaos ==

BRST gauge fixing procedure applied to SDEs leads directly to the Witten index. The Witten index is of topological character and it does not respond to any perturbation. In particular, all response correlators calculated using the Witten index vanish. This fact has a physical interpretation within the STS: the physical meaning of the Witten index is the partition function of the noise&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and since there is no backaction from the dynamical system to the noise, the Witten index has no information on the details of the SDE. In contrast, the information on the details of the model is contained in the other trace-like object of the theory, the dynamical partition function, &lt;math display="block"&gt; {\mathcal Z}_{tt'} = \int\dots\int_{a.p.b.c.} e^{(Q,\Psi)}D\Phi = \operatorname{Tr} \hat {\mathcal M}_{tt'},&lt;/math&gt;where a.p.b.c. denotes antiperiodic boundary conditions for the fermionic fields and periodic boundary conditions for bosonic fields. In the standard manner, the dynamical partition function can be promoted to the [[generating function]]al by coupling the model to external probing fields.

For a wide class of models, dynamical partition function provides lower bound for the stochastically averaged number of fixed points of the SDE-defined diffeomorphisms,&lt;math display="block"&gt; \left.{\mathcal Z}_{tt'}\right|_{t-t'\to\infty} = \sum\nolimits_{p} e^{-(t-t'){\mathsf E}_p} \le  \langle 
\#\{\text{fixed points of } M_{t't}\} \rangle_\text{noise} \propto e^{(t-t')S} .&lt;/math&gt;Here, index &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; runs over "physical states", i.e., the eigenstates that grow fastest with the rate of the exponential growth given as,&lt;math display="inline"&gt; \Gamma_g = - \min_\alpha \operatorname{Re} {\mathsf E}_\alpha \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;, and parameter &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; can be viewed as stochastic version of dynamical entropy such as [[topological entropy]]. Positive entropy is one of the key signatures of deterministic chaos. Therefore, the situation with positive &lt;math&gt; \Gamma_g &lt;/math&gt; must be identified as chaotic in the generalized, stochastic sense as it implies positive entropy: &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt; \Gamma_g \le S &lt;/math&gt;. At the same time, positive &lt;math&gt; \Gamma_g &lt;/math&gt; implies that TS is broken spontaneously, that is, the ground state in not supersymmetric because its eigenvalue is not zero. In other words, positive dynamical entropy is a reason to identify spontaneous TS breaking as the stochastic generalization of the concept of dynamical chaos. Noteworthy, Langevin SDEs are never chaotic because the spectrum of their SEO is real non-negative.

The complete list of reasons why spontaneous TS breaking must be viewed as the stochastic generalization of the concept of dynamical chaos is as follows. 
* Positive dynamical entropy.
* According to the [[Goldstone's theorem]], spontaneous TS breaking must tailor a long-range dynamical behavior, one of the manifestations of which is the [[butterfly effect]] discussed above in the context of the meaning of TS.
* From the properties of the eigensystem of SEO, TS can be spontaneously broken only if &lt;math&gt; \dim X \ge 3 &lt;/math&gt;. This conclusion can be viewed as the stochastic generalization of the [[Poincaré–Bendixson theorem|Poincare–Bendixson theorem]] for deterministic chaos.
* In the deterministic case, [[Integrable system|integrable models in the sense of dynamical systems]] have well-defined global  [[Stable manifold|stable and unstable manifolds]] of &lt;math&gt; F &lt;/math&gt;. The bras/kets of the global ground states of such models are the Poincare duals of the global stable/unstable manifolds. These ground states are supersymmetric so that TS is not broken spontaneously. On the contrary, when the model is non-integrable or chaotic, its global (un)stable manifolds are not well-defined topological manifolds, but rather have a fractal, self-recurrent structure that can be captured using the concept of branching manifolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The topology of chaos : Alice in stretch and squeezeland|last=Gilmore|first=R.|last2=Lefranc|first2=M.|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-VCH|isbn=9783527410675|location=|pages=|oclc=967841676}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wavefunctions that can represent such manifolds cannot be supersymmetric. Therefore, TS breaking is intrinsically related to the concept of non-integrability in the sense of dynamical systems, which is actually yet another widely accepted definition of deterministic chaos.
All the above features of TS breaking work for both deterministic and stochastic models. This is in contrast with the traditional [[Chaos theory|deterministic chaos]] whose trajectory-based properties such as the [[topological mixing]] cannot in principle be generalized to stochastic case because, just like in quantum dynamics, all trajectories are possible in the presence of noise and, say, the topological mixing property is satisfied trivially by all models with non-zero noise intensity.

== STS as a topological field theory ==
[[File:STS Explanation of Instanton Matrix Element.png|thumb|The square '''acbd''' represents an instanton, i.e, the family of trajectories of deterministic flow (dotted arrowed curves) leading from one critical point (b) to another (a). The bra/ket (&lt;math&gt;\langle a|&lt;/math&gt;/&lt;math&gt;|b\rangle&lt;/math&gt;) of the locally supersymmetric ground states (vacua) corresponding to these critical points are the Poincare duals of the local unstable/stable manifolds. Operators &lt;math&gt;\hat O_{1,2}&lt;/math&gt; are Poincare duals of vertical/horizontal lines. The value of the instantonic matrix element is the intersection number (the difference in the numbers of positive (black) and negative (white) intersections). It is invariant under the temporal evolution due to the flow, &lt;math&gt;\hat O_1(0) \to \hat O_1(t)&lt;/math&gt; .|alt=Instantoic matrix elemtent as an intersention number]]The topological sector of STS can be recognized as a member of the Witten-type [[Topological quantum field theory|topological field theories]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In other words, some objects in STS are of topological character with the Witten index being the most famous example. There are other classes of topological objects. One class of objects is related to [[instanton]]s, i.e., transient dynamics. Crumpling paper, protein folding, and many other nonlinear dynamical processes in response to quenches, i.e., to external (sudden) changes of parameters, can be recognized as instantonic dynamics. From the mathematical point of view, instantons are families of solutions of deterministic equations of motion, &lt;math&gt;\dot x = F &lt;/math&gt;, that lead from, say, less stable fixed point of &lt;math&gt; F &lt;/math&gt; to a more stable fixed point. Certain matrix elements calculated on instantons are of topological nature. An example of such matrix elements can be defined for a pair of critical points, &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; b &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; being more stable than &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math display="block"&gt; \left.\int\dots\int_{x(\pm\infty)=a,b} \left(\prod\nolimits_i O_i(t_i)\right)e^{({\mathcal Q},\Psi)} D\Phi  \right|_{\Theta\to0} = \langle a | {\mathcal T}\left(\prod\nolimits_i \hat O_i(t_i)\right) | b \rangle. &lt;/math&gt;Here &lt;math&gt; \langle a | &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; | b \rangle &lt;/math&gt; are the bra and ket of the corresponding perturbative supersymmetric ground states, or vacua, which are the Poincare duals of the local stable and unstable manifolds of the corresponding critical point; &lt;math&gt; {\mathcal T} &lt;/math&gt; denotes chronological ordering; &lt;math&gt; O &lt;/math&gt;'s are observables that are the Poincare duals of some closed submanifolds in &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt; \hat O(t) = \hat {\mathcal M}_{t_0 t} \hat O \hat {\mathcal M}_{t, t_0} &lt;/math&gt; are the observables in the Heisenberg representation with &lt;math&gt; t_0 &lt;/math&gt; being an unimportant reference time moment. The critical points have different indexes of stability so that the states &lt;math&gt;|a\rangle &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|b\rangle &lt;/math&gt; are topologically inequivalent as they represent unstable manifolds of different dimensionalities. The above matrix elements are independent of &lt;math&gt; t_i's &lt;/math&gt; as they actually represent the intersection number of &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;-manifolds on the instanton as exemplified in the figure.

The above instantonic matrix elements are exact only in the deterministic limit. In the general stochastic case, one can consider global supersymmetric states, &lt;math&gt; \theta&lt;/math&gt;'s, from the [[De Rham cohomology]] classes of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and observables, &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt;, that are Poincare duals of [[closed manifold]]s non-trivial in [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. The following matrix elements, &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \langle \theta_\alpha | {\mathcal T}\left(\prod\nolimits_i \hat \gamma_i(t_i)\right) | \theta_\beta \rangle, &lt;/math&gt; are topological invariants representative of the structure of De Rham [[cohomology ring]] of &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;.

== Applications ==
Supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics can be interesting in different ways. For example, STS offers a promising realization of the concept of [[supersymmetry]]. In general, there are two major problems in the context of supersymmetry. The first is establishing connections between this mathematical entity and the real world. Within STS, supersymmetry is the most common symmetry in nature because it is pertinent to all continuous time dynamical systems. The second is the [[Supersymmetry breaking|spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry]]. This problem is particularly important for particle physics because supersymmetry of [[elementary particle]]s, if exists at extremely short scale, must be broken spontaneously at large scale. This problem is nontrivial because supersymmetries are hard to break spontaneously, the very reason behind the introduction of [[Soft SUSY breaking|soft or explicit supersymmetry breaking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chung|first=D.

A few more specific applications of STS are as follows.

=== Classification of stochastic dynamics ===

[[File:STS Phase Diagram.png|thumb|Stochastic dynamical systems can be classified according to whether TS is spontaneously broken or not (ordered/symmetric) and whether the flow vector field is integrable or non-integrable (chaotic). Symmetric phase can be identified as thermal equilibrium (T). Ordered non-integrable phase can be called chaos (C) because it hosts conventional deterministic chaos. Ordered integrable phase can be called noise-induced chaos (N) because TS broking involves antiinstantons that disappear in the deterministic limit. The N''-''phase is also known in the literature as self-organized criticality.]]

STS provides classification for stochastic models depending on whether TS is broken and integrability of flow vector field. In can be exemplified as a part of the general phase diagram at the [[Edge of chaos|border of chaos]] (see figure on the right). The phase diagram has the following properties:   
* For physical models, TS gets restored eventually with the increase of noise intensity. 
* Symmetric phase can be called thermal equilibrium or T-phase because the ground state is the supersymmetric state of steady-state total probability distribution. 
* In the deterministic limit, ordered phase is equivalent to deterministic chaotic dynamics with non-integrable flow. 
* Ordered non-integrable phase can be called chaos or C-phase because ordinary deterministic chaos belongs to it. 
* Ordered integrable phase can be called noise-induced chaos or N-phase because it disappears in the deterministic limit. TS is broken by the condensation of (anti-)instantons (see below).   
* At stronger noises, the sharp N-C boundary must smear out into a crossover because (anti-)instantons lose their individuality and it is hard for an external observer to tell one tunneling process from another.

=== Demystification of self-organized criticality ===
Many sudden (or instantonic) processes in nature, such as, e.g., [[crackling noise]], exhibit scale-free statistics often called the [[Zipf's law]]. As an explanation for this peculiar spontaneous dynamical behavior, it was proposed to believe that some stochastic dynamical systems have a tendency to self-tune themselves into a [[Critical point (physics)|critical point]], the phenomenological approach known as [[self-organized criticality]] (SOC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watkins|first=N.

Specifically, the definitive feature of the N-phase is the peculiar mechanism of the TS breaking. Unlike in the C-phase, where the TS is broken by the non-integrability of the flow, in the ''N''-phase, the TS is spontaneously broken due to the condensation of the configurations of instantons and noise-induced antiinstantons, i.e., time-reversed instantons. These processes can be roughly interpreted as the noise-induced tunneling events between, e.g., different attractors. Qualitatively, the dynamics in the ''N''-phase appears to an external observer as a sequence of sudden jumps or "avalanches" that must exhibit a scale-free behavior/statistics as a result of the [[Goldstone theorem]]. This picture of dynamics in the N-phase is exactly the dynamical behavior that the concept of SOC was designed to explain. In contrast with the original understanding of SOC,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bak|first=P.|last2=Tang|first2=C.|last3=Wiesenfeld|first3=K.|date=1987|title=Self-organized criticality: An explanation of the 1/f noise|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=59|issue=4|pages=381–384|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.381|pmid=10035754|bibcode=1987PhRvL..59..381B}}&lt;/ref&gt; its STS interpretation has little to do with the traditional [[critical phenomena]] theory where scale-free behavior is associated with unstable fixed points of the [[renormalization group]] flow.

=== Kinematic dynamo theory ===
Magnetohydrodynamical phenomenon of  [[Dynamo theory#Kinematic dynamo theory|kinematic dynamo]] can also be identified as the spontaneous breakdown of TS.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ovchinnikov|first=I.V.|last2=Ensslin|first2=T. A.|date=2016|title=Kinematic dynamo, supersymmetry breaking, and chaos|journal=Physical Review D|volume=93|issue=8|pages=085023|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.93.085023|bibcode=2016PhRvD..93h5023O|arxiv=1512.01651}}&lt;/ref&gt; This result follows from equivalence between the evolution operator of the magnetic field and the SEO of the corresponding SDE describing the flow of the background matter. The so emerged ''STS-kinematic dynamo'' correspondence proves, in particular, that both types of TS breaking spectra are possible, with the real and complex ground state eigenvalues, because kinematic dynamo with both types of the fastest growing eigenmodes are known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bouya|first=I.|last2=Dormy|first2=E.|date=2013-03-01|title=Revisiting the ABC flow dynamo|journal=Physics of Fluids|volume=25|issue=3|pages=037103–037103–10|doi=10.1063/1.4795546|issn=1070-6631|bibcode=2013PhFl...25c7103B|arxiv=1206.5186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transient dynamics ===
It is well known that various types of transient dynamics, such as quenches, exhibit spontaneous long-range behavior. In case of quenches across phase transitions, this behavior is often attributed to the proximity of criticality. At the same time, other quenches, not across a phase transition, are also known to exhibit long-range characteristics with the best known examples being the [[Barkhausen effect]] and other realizations of the concept of [[crackling noise]]. It is intuitively appealing that theoretical explanation for the scale-free behavior in quenches must be the same disregard whether the quench is across a phase transition or not. STS offers such an explanation. Namely, transient dynamics is essentially a composite instanton and TS is intrinsically broken within instantons. Even though TS breaking within instantons is not exactly the phenomenon of the spontaneous breakdown of a symmetry by a global ground state, this effective TS breaking must also result in a scale-free behavior. This understanding is supported by the fact that condensed instantons lead to appearance of logarithms in the correlation functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frenkel|first=E.|last2=Losev|first2=A.|last3=Nekrasov|first3=N.|title=Notes on instantons in topological field theory and beyond|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0920563207004161|journal=Nuclear Physics B: Proceedings Supplements|language=en|volume=171|pages=215–230|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysbps.2007.06.013|year=2007|bibcode=2007NuPhS.171..215F|arxiv=hep-th/0702137}}&lt;/ref&gt; This picture of transient dynamics explains computational efficiency of the digital memcomputing machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Di Ventra|first=M.|last2=Traversa|first2=F.

=== Low energy effective theories for dynamical chaos  ===
In physics, spontaneous symmetry breaking is known as "ordering". For example, the spontaneous breakdown of translational symmetry in a liquid is the mathematical essence of crystallization or spatial "ordering" of molecules into a lattice. Therefore, spontaneous TS breaking picture of chaotic dynamics is in a certain sense opposite to the semantics of word "chaos". Due to its temporal character, it is actually [[Chronos]], not [[Chaos (mythology)|Chaos]], that appears to be the [[Greek primordial deities|primordial Greek deity]] closest in its spirit to the TS breaking order. Perhaps, a more accurate identifier than "chaos" should be coined for TS breaking in the future. As of this moment, this qualitatively new understanding of dynamical chaos already points into a research direction that may lead to resolutions of some important problems such as turbulence and neurodynamics. Namely, as in case of any other "ordering", a simplified yet accurate description of chaotic dynamics can be achieved in terms of the low-energy effective theory for an [[Phase transitions#Order parameters|order parameter]]. While the low-energy [[Effective action|effective description]] of chaotic dynamics may be very case specific, its order parameter must always be a representative of the gapless fermions or goldstinos of the spontaneously broken TS.

'''Thermal hydrolysis''' is a process used for treating [[industrial waste]], [[municipal solid waste]] and [[sewage sludge]].

==Description==
Thermal hydrolysis is a two-stage process combining high-pressure boiling of [[waste]] or [[sludge]] followed by a rapid decompression. This combined action sterilizes the sludge and makes it more biodegradable, which improves digestion performance. Sterilization destroys pathogens in the sludge resulting in it exceeding the stringent requirements for land application (agriculture).&lt;ref name=WaterWorld&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barber |first=Bill |last2=Lancaster |first2=Rick |last3=Kleiven |first3=Harald |title=Thermal Hydrolysis: The Missing Ingredient for Better Biosolids? |url=http://www.waterworld.com/articles/wwi/print/volume-27/issue-4/editorial-focus/slidge-processing-biosolids/thermal-hydrolysis-the-missing-ingredient.html |journal=Water World |volume=27 |issue=4 |date=2012-09-01 |accessdate=2014-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the treatment adjusts the [[rheology]] to such an extent that loading rates to sludge [[anaerobic digesters]] can be doubled, and also dewaterability of the sludge is significantly improved.&lt;ref name=JHazMat&gt;{{cite journal |last=Neyens |first=Elisabeth |last2=Baeyens |first2=Jan |title=A review of thermal sludge pre-treatment processes to improve dewaterability |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389402003205 |journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials |volume=B98|pages=51–57 |date=2003 |accessdate=2017-02-23 |doi=10.1016/S0304-3894(02)00320-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WaterResearch&gt;{{cite journal |last=Skinner |first=Samuel |last2=Studer |first2=Lindsay |last3=Dixon |first3=David |last4=Hillis |first4=Peter |last5=Rees |first5=Catherine |last6=Wall |first6=Rachael |last7=Cavalida |first7=Raul |last8=Usher |first8=Shane |last9=Stickland |first9=Anthony |last10=Scales |first10=Peter |title=Quantification of wastewater sludge dewatering |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277133349 |journal=Water Research |volume=82|pages=2–13 |date=2015 |accessdate=2017-02-23 |doi=10.1016/j.watres.2015.04.045|pmid=26003332 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first full-scale application of this process for sewage sludge was installed in [[Hamar]], Norway in 1996. Since then, there have been over 30 additional installations globally.&lt;ref name=WaterWorld/&gt;

[[File:AGMA Clepsydre.jpg|thumb|A display of two outflow water clocks from the Ancient Agora Museum in Athens. The top is an original from the late 5th century BC. The bottom is a reconstruction of a clay original.]]

A '''water clock ''' or '''clepsydra''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:κλεψύδρα|κλεψύδρα]] from κλέπτειν ''kleptein'', 'to steal';  ὕδωρ  ''hydor'', 'water') is any [[timepiece]] in which time is measured by the regulated flow of liquid into (inflow type) or out from (outflow type) a vessel where the amount is then measured.

Water clocks are one of the oldest time-measuring instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turner|1984|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where and when they were first invented is not known, and given their great antiquity it may never be. The bowl-shaped outflow is the simplest form of a water clock and is known to have existed in [[Babylon]] and in [[Egypt]] around the 16th century BCE. Other regions of the world, including [[India]] and [[China]], also have early evidence of water clocks, but the earliest dates are less certain. Some authors, however, claim that water clocks appeared in China as early as 4000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cowan|1958|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern timepieces are called "water clocks" but work differently from the ancient ones. Their timekeeping is governed by a [[pendulum]], but they use water for other purposes, such as providing the power needed to drive the clock by using a [[water wheel]] or something similar, or by having water in their displays.

The Greeks and Romans advanced water clock design to include the inflow clepsydra with an early feedback system, gearing, and [[escapement]] mechanism, which were connected to fanciful [[Automaton|automata]] and resulted in improved accuracy. Further advances were made in [[Byzantium]], Syria and Mesopotamia, where increasingly accurate water clocks incorporated complex segmental and [[epicyclic gearing]], [[water wheel]]s, and [[Program (machine)|programmability]], advances which eventually made their way to [[Europe]]. Independently, the Chinese developed their own advanced water clocks, incorporating gears, escapement mechanisms, and water wheels, passing their ideas on to [[Korea]] and [[Japan]] {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}.

Some water clock designs were developed independently and some knowledge was transferred through the spread of trade. These early water clocks were calibrated with a [[sundial]]. While never reaching a level of accuracy comparable to today's standards of timekeeping, the water clock was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for millennia, until it was replaced by more accurate [[pendulum clock]]s in 17th-century Europe.

A water clock uses a flow of water to measure time. If viscosity is neglected, the physical principle required to study such clocks is [[Torricelli's law]]. There are two types of water clocks: inflow and outflow. In an outflow water clock, a container is filled with water, and the water is drained slowly and evenly out of the container. This container has markings that are used to show the passage of time. As the water leaves the container, an observer can see where the water is level with the lines and tell how much time has passed. An inflow water clock works in basically the same way, except instead of flowing out of the container, the water is filling up the marked container. As the container fills, the observer can see where the water meets the lines and tell how much time has passed.

In [[ancient China]], as well as throughout East Asia, water clocks were very important in the study of [[astronomy]] and [[astrology]]. The oldest written reference dates the use of the water-clock in China to the 6th century BCE.&lt;ref name=needham479&gt;{{Harvnb|Needham|2000|p=479}}&lt;/ref&gt; From about 200 BCE onwards, the outflow clepsydra was replaced almost everywhere in China by the inflow type with an indicator-rod borne on a float.&lt;ref name=needham479/&gt; The Han dynasty philosopher and politician [[Huan Tan]] (40 BCE – 30 CE), a Secretary at the Court in charge of clepsydrae, wrote that he had to compare clepsydrae with sundials because of how temperature and humidity affected their accuracy, demonstrating that the effects of evaporation, as well as of temperature on the speed at which water flows, were known at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Needham|1995|pp=321–322}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 976, the Song dynasty military engineer and astronomer [[Zhang Sixun]] addressed the problem of the water in clepsydrae freezing in cold weather by using liquid mercury instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Needham|2000|pp=469–471}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, instead of using water, the early Ming Dynasty engineer Zhan Xiyuan (c. 1360-1380) created a sand-driven wheel clock, improved upon by Zhou Shuxue (c. 1530-1558).&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2"&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986). ''Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4, Physics and Physical Technology, Part 2, Mechanical Engineering''. Taipei: Caves Books Ltd. Pages 510–511.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of clepsydrae to drive mechanisms [[Armillary sphere|illustrating astronomical phenomena]] began with the Han Dynasty polymath [[Zhang Heng]] (78-139) in 117, who also employed a [[waterwheel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Needham|2000|loc=pps. 30, 532}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zhang Heng]] was the first in China to add an extra compensating tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel, which solved the problem of the falling [[pressure head]] in the reservoir tank.&lt;ref name="needham479"/&gt; Zhang's ingenuity led to the creation by the Tang dynasty mathematician and engineer [[Yi Xing]] (683–727) and Liang Lingzan in 725 of a clock driven by a waterwheel linkwork [[escapement]] mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Needham|2000|loc=pps. 471, 490, 532}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same mechanism would be used by the Song dynasty polymath [[Su Song]] (1020–1101) in 1088 to power his [[astronomical clock]] tower, as well as a [[chain drive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Needham|2000|p=462}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Su Song]]'s clock tower, over {{convert|30|ft|m}} tall, possessed a [[bronze]] power-driven armillary sphere for observations, an automatically rotating [[celestial globe]], and five front panels with doors that permitted the viewing of changing [[mannequin]]s which rang bells or gongs, and held tablets indicating the hour or other special times of the day. In the 2000s, in [[Beijing]]'s [[Gulou and Zhonglou (Beijing)|Drum Tower]] an outflow clepsydra is operational and displayed for tourists. It is connected to automata so that every quarter-hour a small brass statue of a man claps his cymbals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:CIMG1106_Clepshydra_in_Drum_Tower,_Beijing_august_2007.JPG|title=Clepsydra in the Drum Tower, Beijing, China|first=|last=Ellywa|date=1 August 2007|publisher=|via=Wikimedia Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

N. Kameswara Rao suggested that pots excavated from [[Mohenjo daro]] may have been used as water clocks.

''Ghati'' or ''Kapala'' (clepsydra or water clock) is referred to in [[Jyotisha]] [[Vedanga]], where the amount of water that measures a nadika (24 minutes) is mentioned. A more developed form of the clepsydra is described in chapter xiii, 23 of the ''Suryasiddhanta.''&lt;ref&gt;"A copper vessel (in the shape of the lower half of the water jar) which has a small hole in its bottom and being placed upon clean water in a basin sinks exactly 60 times in a day and at night." - chapter xiii, 23 of the ''Suryasiddhanta''.&lt;/ref&gt;
At [[Nalanda]], a [[Buddhist]] university, four hours a day and four hours at night were measured by a water clock, which consisted of a copper bowl holding two large floats in a larger bowl filled with water. The bowl was filled with water from a small hole at its bottom; it sank when completely filled and was marked by the beating of a drum at daytime. The amount of water added varied with the seasons and this clock was operated by the students of the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Scharfe | first = Hartmut | title = Education in Ancient India | year = 2002 | publisher = Brill Academic Publishers | location = Leiden | isbn = 90-04-12556-6 | pages = 171}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The description of a water clock in astrologer Varahimira's ''Pancasiddhantika'' (505) adds further detail to the account given in the ''Suryasiddhanta''. The description given by mathematician [[Brahmagupta]] in his work ''Brahmasphutasiddhanta'' matches with that given in the ''Suryasiddhanta''. Astronomer Lallacharya describes this instrument in detail.&lt;ref&gt;"A copper vessel weighing 10 palas, 6 angulas in height and twice as much in breadth at the mouth--this vessel of the capacity of 60 palas of water and hemispherical in form is called a ghati." This copper vessel, which was bored with a needle and made of 3 1/8 masas of gold and 4 angulas long, gets filled in one nadika."&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the dimensions were determined by experiment.

In Babylon, water clocks were of the outflow type and were cylindrical in shape. Use of the water clock as an aid to astronomical calculations dates back to the [[First Babylonian Dynasty|Old Babylonian period]] (''c.'' '''2000 BCE'''–''c.'' 1600 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pingree | first = David | authorlink = David Pingree | editor = Stephanie Dalley |editorlink=Stephanie Dalley| title = The Legacy of Mesopotamia | year = 1998 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | isbn = 0-19-814946-8 | pages = 125–126 | chapter = Legacies in Astronomy and Celestial Omens}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are no surviving water clocks from the Mesopotamian region, most evidence of their existence comes from writings on [[clay tablet]]s. Two collections of tablets, for example, are the ''Enuma-Anu-Enlil'' (1600–1200 BCE) and the ''[[MUL.APIN]]'' (7th century BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Evans | first = James | title = The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy | year = 1998 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | isbn = 0-19-509539-1 | pages = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these tablets, water clocks are used in reference to payment of the night and day watches (guards).

These clocks were unique, as they did not have an indicator such as hands (as are typically used today) or grooved notches (as were used in Egypt). Instead, these clocks measured time "by the weight of water flowing from" it.&lt;ref name=neugebauer&gt;{{Harvnb|Neugebauer|1947|pp=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The volume was measured in capacity units called ''qa''. The weight, ''mana'' (the Greek unit for about one pound), is the weight of water in a water clock.

In Babylonian times, time was measured with temporal hours. So, as seasons changed, so did the length of a day. "To define the length of a 'night watch' at the summer solstice, one had to pour two mana of water into a cylindrical clepsydra; its emptying indicated the end of the watch. One-sixth of a mana had to be added each succeeding half-month. At equinox, three mana had to be emptied in order to correspond to one watch, and four mana were emptied for each watch of the winter solstitial night."&lt;ref name=neugebauer/&gt;

The oldest water clock of which there is physical evidence dates to ''c.''

There were twelve separate columns with consistently spaced markings on the inside to measure the passage of "hours" as the water level reached them. The columns were for each of the twelve [[month]]s to allow for the variations of the seasonal hours. These clocks were used by priests to determine the time at night so that the temple rites and sacrifices could be performed at the correct hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cotterell|Kamminga|1990|p.=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; These clocks may have been used in daylight as well.

According to [[Callisthenes]], the [[Persia]]ns were using water clocks in '''328 BC''' to ensure a just and exact distribution of water from [[qanat]]s to their shareholders for agricultural irrigation. The use of water clocks in [[Iran]], especially in [[Zibad]], dates back to 500BC.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Later they were also used to determine the exact holy days of pre-Islamic religions, such as the ''[[Nowruz]]'', ''Chelah'', or ''[[Yaldā]]'' - the shortest, longest, and equal-length days and nights of the years. The water clocks used in Iran were one of the most practical ancient tools for timing the yearly calendar.&lt;ref name=Qanat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftabir.com/articles/view/science_education/technical/c3c1183387267p1.php|title=Conference of Qanat in Iran - water clock in Persia 1383|website=www.aftabir.com|language=Persian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.farheekhtegan.ir/newspaper/pagepdf/16545&lt;/ref&gt;
The water clock, or ''Fenjaan'', was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for calculating the amount or the time that a farmer must take water from a [[qanat]] or well for irrigation, until it was replaced by more accurate current clocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parssea.org/?p=2734|title=ساعت آبی پنگان در ایران بیش از  ۲۴۰۰ سال کاربرد دارد. - پژوهشهای ایرانی|website=parssea.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vista.ir/article/265134|title=قنات میراث فرهنگی و علمی ایرانیان|first=|last=vista.ir|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persian water clocks were a practical and useful tool for the qanat's shareholders to calculate the length of time they could divert water to their farm. The qanat(Kariz) was the only water source for agriculture and irrigation so a just and fair water distribution was very important. Therefore, a very fair and clever old person was elected to be the manager of the water clock(MirAab), and at least two full-time managers were needed to control and observe the number of fenjaans and announce the exact time during the days and nights.&lt;ref name="amordadnews.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://amordadnews.com/neveshtehNamyesh.aspx?NId=6010|title=water clock in persia|work=amordadnews.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429163019/http://amordadnews.com/neveshtehNamyesh.aspx?NId=6010|archivedate=2014-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fenjaan consisted of a large pot full of water and a bowl with a small hole in the center. When the bowl became full of water, it would sink into the pot, and the manager would empty the bowl and again put it on the top of the water in the pot. He would record the number of times the bowl sank by putting small stones into a jar.&lt;ref name="amordadnews.com"/&gt; The place where the clock was situated, and its managers, were collectively known as ''[[khaneh Fenjaan]]''. Usually this would be the top floor of a public-house, with west- and east-facing windows to show the time of Sunset and Sunrise. There was also another time-keeping tool named a ''staryab'' or [[astrolabe]], but it was mostly used for superstitious beliefs and was not practical for use as a farmers' calendar. The Zeebad Gonabad water clock was in use until 1965{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} when it was substituted by modern clocks.&lt;ref name=Qanat/&gt;

[[File:Clepsydra-Diagram-Fancy.jpeg|thumb|left|An early 19th-century illustration&lt;ref&gt;This engraving is taken from "Rees's Clocks, Watches, and Chronometers 1819-20.

The hour indicator ascends as water flows in. Also, a series of gears rotate a cylinder to correspond to the temporal hours.]]

The word "[[wiktionary:κλεψύδρα#Ancient Greek|clepsydra]]" comes from the Greek meaning "water thief".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levy |first=Janey |year=2004 |title=Keeping Time Through the Ages: The History of Tools Used to Measure Time |publisher=Rosen Classroom |isbn=9780823989171 |page=11 |quote=The Greeks named the water clock 'clepsydra' (KLEP-suh-druh), which means 'water thief'.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks considerably advanced the water clock by tackling the problem of the diminishing flow. They introduced several types of the inflow clepsydra, one of which included the earliest feedback control system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Goodenow|Orr|Ross|2007|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ctesibius]] invented an indicator system typical for later clocks such as the dial and pointer.&lt;ref name="John G. Landels 35"&gt;John G. Landels: "Water-Clocks and Time Measurement in Classical Antiquity", "Endeavour", Vol. 3, No. 1 (1979), pp. 32-37 (35)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] engineer [[Vitruvius]] described early alarm clocks, working with gongs or trumpets.&lt;ref name="John G. Landels 35"/&gt; A commonly used water clock was the simple outflow clepsydra. This small earthenware vessel had a hole in its side near the base. In both Greek and Roman times, this type of clepsydra was used in courts for allocating periods of time to speakers. In important cases, such as when a person's life was at stake, it was filled completely, but for more minor cases, only partially. If proceedings were interrupted for any reason, such as to examine documents, the hole in the clepsydra was stopped with wax until the speaker was able to resume his pleading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|1981|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Clepsydra Spring House of the Acropolis====
Just northeast of the entrance to the [[Acropolis of Athens]] there was a famous natural spring named Clepsydra. It is mentioned by [[Aristophanes]] in ''[[Lysistrata]]'' (lines 910-913) and other ancient literary sources. A fountain house was build on the site ca. 470-460 BCE. It was of simple rectangular construction with a draw-basin and paved court.

====Clepsydrae for Keeping Time====
In the 4th century BCE, the clepsydra is known to have been used as a stop-watch for imposing a time limit on clients' visits in [[Athens|Athenian]] brothels.&lt;ref name="John G. Landels 32"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Landels|first=John G.|title=Water-Clocks and Time Measurement in Classical Antiquity|journal=Endeavour|volume=3|issue=1|year=1979|page=33|doi=10.1016/0160-9327(79)90007-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slightly later, in the early 3rd century BCE, the [[Hellenistic]] physician Herophilos employed a portable clepsydra on his house visits in [[Alexandria]] for measuring his patients' pulse-beats. By comparing the rate by age group with empirically obtained data sets, he was able to determine the intensity of the disorder.&lt;ref name="John G. Landels 32"/&gt;

Between 270 BCE and 500 CE, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] ([[Ctesibius]], [[Hero of Alexandria]], [[Archimedes]]) and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[horology|horologists]] and [[astronomer]]s were developing more elaborate mechanized water clocks. The added complexity was aimed at regulating the flow and at providing fancier displays of the passage of time. For example, some water clocks rang [[bell (instrument)|bell]]s and [[gong]]s, while others opened doors and windows to show figurines of people, or moved pointers, and dials. Some even displayed [[astrology|astrological]] models of the universe. The 3rd century BCE engineer [[Philo of Byzantium]] referred in his works to water clocks already fitted with an escapement mechanism, the earliest known of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|2000|pp=356f.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest achievement of the invention of clepsydrae during this time, however, was by Ctesibius with his incorporation of gears and a dial indicator to automatically show the time as the lengths of the days changed throughout the year, because of the temporal timekeeping used during his day. Also, a Greek astronomer, [[Andronicus of Cyrrhus]], supervised the construction of his Horologion, known today as the [[Tower of the Winds]], in the [[Athens]] marketplace (or [[agora]]) in the first half of the 1st century BCE. This [[octagon]]al [[clocktower]] showed scholars and shoppers both [[sundial]]s and mechanical hour indicators. It featured a 24-[[Hour#History|hour]] mechanized clepsydra and indicators for the eight winds from which the tower got its name, and it displayed the [[season]]s of the year and astrological dates and periods.

===Medieval Islamic world===
[[File:Al-jazari elephant clock.png|thumb|left|[[Al-Jazari]]'s [[Elephant clock|elephant water clock]] (1206).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = ibn al-Razzaz al-Jazari | authorlink = al-Jazari | others = Translated and annotated by [[Donald Routledge Hill]] | title = The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices | year = 1974 | publisher = D.

In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] (632-1280), the use of water clocks has its roots from Archimedes during the rise of [[Alexandria]] in [[Egypt]] and continues on through [[Byzantium]]. The water clocks by Persian engineer [[Al-Jazari]], however, are credited for going "well beyond anything" that had preceded them. In al-Jazari's 1206 treatise, he describes one of his water clocks, the [[elephant clock]]. The clock recorded the passage of temporal hours, which meant that the rate of flow had to be changed daily to match the uneven length of days throughout the year. To accomplish this, the clock had two tanks, the top tank was connected to the time indicating mechanisms and the bottom was connected to the [[Regulator (automatic control)|flow control regulator]]. Basically, at daybreak the tap was opened and water flowed from the top tank to the bottom tank via a float regulator that maintained a constant pressure in the receiving tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|al-Hassan|Hill|1986|pp=57–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clock of al Jazari before 1206.jpg|thumb|Water-powered automatic [[castle clock]] of [[Al-Jazari]], 12th century.]]

The most sophisticated water-powered [[astronomical clock]] was [[Al-Jazari]]'s [[castle clock]], considered by some to be an early example of a programmable [[analog computer]], in 1206.&lt;ref name="Ancient Discoveries"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ancient Discoveries, Episode 11: Ancient Robots |publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxjbaQl0ad8 |accessdate=2008-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301151115/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxjbaQl0ad8 |archivedate=March 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a complex device that was about {{convert|11|ft|m}} high, and had multiple functions alongside timekeeping. It included a display of the [[zodiac]] and the solar and lunar orbits, and a pointer in the shape of the crescent moon which traveled across the top of a gateway, moved by a hidden cart and causing automatic doors to open, each revealing a mannequin, every hour.&lt;ref&gt;Howard R.

The first water clocks to employ complex segmental and [[epicyclic gearing]] was invented earlier by the [[Arab]] engineer [[al-Muradi|Ibn Khalaf al-Muradi]] in [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Iberia]] c. 1000. His water clocks were driven by [[water wheel]]s, as was also the case for several Chinese water clocks in the 11th century.&lt;ref name=Hassan/&gt; Comparable water clocks were built in [[Damascus]] and [[Fes, Morocco|Fez]]. The latter ([[Dar al-Magana]]) remains until today and its mechanism has been reconstructed. The first European clock to employ these complex gears was the astronomical clock created by [[Giovanni Dondi dell'Orologio|Giovanni de Dondi]] in c. 1365. Like the Chinese, Arab engineers at the time also developed an [[escapement]] mechanism which they employed in some of their water clocks. The escapement mechanism was in the form of a constant-head system, while heavy floats were used as weights.&lt;ref name=Hassan&gt;[[Ahmad Y Hassan|Hassan, Ahmad Y]], [http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%2071.htm Transfer Of Islamic Technology To The West, Part II: Transmission Of Islamic Engineering], ''History of Science and Technology in Islam''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Korea===
[[File:Korean Waterclock.jpg|thumb|right|An incomplete scaled-down model of Jang Yeong-sil's self-striking water clock]]
In 1434 during the Choson (or [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]]) Dynasty, Chang Yongsil (or [[Jang Young Sil]]) (장영실 in Korean), Palace Guard and later Chief Court Engineer, constructed the [[Jagyeongnu]] (self-striking water clock or striking clepsydra) for [[King Sejong]]. What made the Jagyeongnu self-striking (or automatic) was the use of jack-work mechanisms, by which three wooden figures (jacks) struck objects to signal the time. This innovation no longer required the reliance of human workers, known as "rooster men", to constantly replenish it. By 1554, the water clock spread from Korea to [[Japan]]. Water clocks were used and improved upon throughout Asia well into the 15th century.

==Modern designs==
[[File:Modern water clock.JPG|thumb|left|Bernard Gitton's Time-Flow clock, showing a time of 4:06]]
Only a few modern water clocks exist today. In 1979, French scientist [[Bernard Gitton]] began creating his Time-Flow Clocks, which are a modern-day approach to the historical version. His unique glass tube designs can be found in over 30 locations throughout the world, including one at [[NEMO (museum)|NEMO Science Museum]] in [[Amsterdam]], [[Europa-Center]]'s The Clock of Flowing Time in [[Berlin]], Centre Commercial Milenis in Guadeloupe, the [[Water clock (Indianapolis)|Giant Water Clock]] at [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]] in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], the [[Abbotsford International Airport]] (formerly at [[Sevenoaks Shopping Centre]]) in [[Abbotsford, British Columbia]], and the Shopping Iguatemi in [[São Paulo]] and [[Porto Alegre]], [[Brazil]].

Gitton's design relies on gravity powering multiple [[siphon]]s in the same principle as the [[Pythagorean cup]]; for example, after the water level in the minute or hour display tubes is reached, an overflow tube starts to act as a siphon and thus empties the display tube. Actual time keeping is done by a calibrated pendulum powered by a water stream piped from the clock's reservoir. The pendulum has a carefully constructed container attached to it; this measures the water that is then poured into the display system. This means that strictly speaking these are not water clocks. The water is used to power the pendulum and to show the time in the display system. There are other modern designs of water clocks, including the [[Royal Gorge]] water clock in [[Colorado]], the Woodgrove Mall in [[Nanaimo]], [[British Columbia]], and the [[Hornsby Water Clock]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].

==Temperature, water viscosity, and clock accuracy==
When viscosity can be neglected, the outflow rate of the water is governed by [[Torricelli's law]], or more generally, by [[Bernoulli's principle]]. [[Viscosity]] will dominate the outflow rate if the water flows out through a nozzle that is sufficiently long and thin, as given by the [[Hagen–Poiseuille equation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Goodenow|Orr|Ross|2007|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately, the flow rate is for such design [[inversely proportional]] to the viscosity, which depends on the [[temperature]]. [[Liquid]]s generally become less viscous as the temperature increases. In the case of water, the viscosity varies by a factor of about seven between zero and 100 degrees Celsius. Thus, a water clock with such a nozzle would run about seven times faster at 100&amp;nbsp;°C than at 0&amp;nbsp;°C. Water is about 25 percent more viscous at 20&amp;nbsp;°C than at 30&amp;nbsp;°C, and a variation in temperature of one degree Celsius, in this "[[room temperature]]" range, produces a change of viscosity of about two percent.&lt;ref&gt;[[CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics]], page F-36&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a water clock with such a nozzle that keeps good time at some given temperature would gain or lose about half an hour per day if it were one degree Celsius warmer or cooler. To make it keep time within one minute per day would require its temperature to be controlled within {{frac|30}}°C (about {{frac|17}}° Fahrenheit). There is no evidence that this was done in antiquity, so ancient water clocks with sufficiently thin and long nozzles (unlike the modern pendulum-controlled one described above) cannot have been reliably accurate by modern standards.  Note, however, that while modern timepieces may not be reset for long periods, water clocks were likely reset every day, when refilled, based on a sundial, so the cumulative error would not have been great.

'''Åke Green''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈoːkɛ ˈɡreːn|lang}}; born 3 June 1941) is a Swedish [[Pentecostal]] [[Christian]] pastor who was prosecuted, but [[acquitted]], under Sweden's law against [[hate speech]] because of critical opinions on [[homosexuality]] in his [[sermon]]s. The [[Judicial system of Sweden#Courts|district court]] found him guilty and sentenced him to one month in prison. The sentence was appealed to the court of appeals ([[hovrätt]]). On 11 February 2005, the [[Göta Court of Appeal]] overturned the decision and acquitted Åke Green. On 9 March, the [[Prosecutor-General of Sweden|Prosecutor-General]] (''Riksåklagaren'') appealed this decision to the [[Supreme Court of Sweden|Supreme Court]], which on 29 November also acquitted.

The Supreme Court stated that Åke Green had violated Swedish law as it currently stands regarding agitation against groups, and that the constitutionally guaranteed [[freedom of expression]] as well as [[freedom of religion]] does not protect him. However, the  Supreme Court also stated that the  [[freedom of expression]] as well as [[freedom of religion]] provided by the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which is superior to normal Swedish law according to the lex superior principle regarding the [[ECHR]] found in the Instrument of Government (Regeringsformen) 2:19, gives him protection, since  jurisprudence  shows that a conviction would probably not be upheld by the [[European Court of Justice|European Court]].&lt;ref name="TheLocal29"&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/2590/20051129/ The Local, 29 Nov 2005: Åke Green cleared over gay sermon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SupCourt"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120218220008/http://www.domstol.se/Domstolar/hogstadomstolen/Avgoranden/2005/Dom_pa_engelska_B_1050-05.pdf Judgment of the Supreme court of Sweden]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hogstadomstolen.se/pressmeddelanden.htm |title=Supreme court press release 2005-11-29 (In Swedish) |accessdate=2006-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217161725/http://www.hogstadomstolen.se/pressmeddelanden.htm |archivedate=17 February 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In 2002, the [[Riksdag]] included references to sexual orientation in a list of groups protected against persecution in the form of threats and expressions of disdain. The list appears in a section of Swedish [[criminal law]] (''Brottsbalken'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sweden.gov.se/content/1/c4/15/36/d74ceabc.pdf The Swedish Penal Code (English), chapter 16, section 8]&lt;/ref&gt; known as The Act on Agitation Against a National or Ethnic Group (''Lagen om hets mot folkgrupp'').

== The sermon ==
At his church in [[Borgholm]], Green delivered a sermon&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eaec.org/bibleanswers/ake_green_sermon.htm&lt;/ref&gt; in which he described "sexual perversions" (referencing homosexuality) as "abnormal, a horrible [[cancer]]ous [[tumor]] in the body of society."  He also said that a person cannot be a Christian and a homosexual at the same time.

Green had invited members of the media to attend the sermon, but none were present when he preached it in the presence of about fifty listeners. He wrote a summary of the sermon, including the above-mentioned quotes, which was printed in the local newspaper Ölandsbladet. A representative of nearby [[Kalmar]]'s [[RFSL]], an [[LGBT]] equal rights organization, reported the sermon to the police and the controversy began.&lt;ref&gt;Den svenska politiken - Struktur, processer och resultat. Henry Bäck, Torbjörn Larsson, 2006. p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The [[Judicial system of Sweden#Courts|district court]] found Åke Green guilty and sentenced him to one month in prison. The sentence was appealed to the court of appeals ([[hovrätt]]) and Green's lawyer maintained his client's religious freedom had been violated. On 11 February 2005 Göta hovrätt overturned the decision and acquitted Åke Green. On 9 March, the [[Prosecutor-General of Sweden|Prosecutor-General]] (''Riksåklagaren'') appealed this decision to the [[Supreme Court of Sweden|Supreme Court]], which on 29 November also acquitted him.

The Supreme Court stated that Åke Green had violated Swedish hate speech law (''Lagen om hets mot folkgrupp'').  A conviction would probably not be upheld by the [[European Court of Human Rights|European Court]]&lt;ref name="TheLocal29"/&gt; considering Article 9 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which covers freedom of religion. After a discussion of the [[case law]] regarding Article 9 and 10 the court stated: "Under these circumstances, it is likely that the European Court, in a determination of the restriction of Åke Green’s right to preach his Biblically based opinion that a judgment of conviction would constitute, would find that this restriction is not proportionate, and would therefore be a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights."&lt;ref name="SupCourt"/&gt;

The sentence has raised a controversy all around the world, with disputes between those who see it as a victory for [[human rights]] and freedom from intolerance, and those who see it as an attack on [[freedom of religion|religious freedom]] and the right to [[freedom of speech|free speech]], which in themselves are both regarded as [[human right]]s.

Green became a cause celebre for [[Homophobia|anti-gay]] preacher [[Fred Phelps]], who has labelled anyone who held the belief that [[God]] could love non-elect [[sin]]ners as being eternally [[damnation|damned]]. Nonetheless, Phelps installed a monument praising Green on his website. (All of the other "monuments" to people on Phelps' sites actually express joy at the death of that person.) Phelps also launched a new website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godhatessweden.com God Hates Sweden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050105032032/http://www.godhatessweden.com/ |date=5 January 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (GodHatesSweden.com) partially in tribute to Green. Green subsequently denounced Phelps.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=818&amp;date=20050107&lt;/ref&gt; "I think it is appalling that people say things like that," Green said, "it is extremely unpleasant." In response, Phelps and his organization, the [[Westboro Baptist Church]], denounced Green as a traitor and an ingrate, and he later removed the Green tribute from his website.

Åke Green was also supported by [[Ulf Ekman]] of [[Livets Ord]] and [[Robert Vesterlund]]'s ''[[Info-14]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Responding to the sentence, Sören Andersson, the president of [[Swedish Federation for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights]] (RFSL), said that religious freedom could never be used as a reason to persecute people.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelocal.se/2590/20051129/ Åke Green cleared over gay sermon&lt;/ref&gt;

== Temperance organisations==
In the beginning of 2008 the organisation [[IOGT-NTO]], a Swedish [[temperance movement|temperance]] movement, decided to withdraw Åke Green's membership, stating that his statements about homosexuality conflict with IOGT-NTO's bylaws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iogt.se/templates/NewsPageSmall____15743.aspx (Swedish) IOGT-NTO's decision to exclude Åke Green]&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, Green became an adherent of the Christian temperance movement, the [[Blue ribbon#Other symbols|Blue Ribbon]]. He was involved in another controversy following the announcement that he was to hold a speech at a common manifestation together with the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] on 1 May 2008, in [[Vänersborg]]. The Social Democrats excluded members of the Blue Ribbon, including Green, after several protests,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ttela.se/?article=38461 (Swedish) "Åke Green no longer welcome", story published in local paper TTELA]&lt;/ref&gt; some of which were published in Vänersborgs local newspaper, ''TTELA''.
